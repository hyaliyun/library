Clarke's Space Odyssey, Monoliths are machines built by an unseen extraterrestrial species. In the series of novels (and the films based on these), three Monoliths are discovered in the Solar System by hominids and humans. The response of the characters to their discovery drives the plot of the series. It also influences the fictional history of the series, particularly by encouraging humankind to progress with technological development and space travel. The first Monolith appears at the beginning of the story, set in prehistoric times. It is discovered by a group of hominids and somehow triggers a considerable shift in evolution, starting with the ability to use tools and weaponry. It is later revealed that thousands of other monoliths exist elsewhere in the Solar System. Origins The extraterrestrial species that built the Monoliths is never described in much detail, but some knowledge of its existence is given to Dave Bowman after he is transported by the stargate to the \\"cosmic zoo\\", as detailed in the 1968 novel 2001: A Space Odyssey and its 1982 sequel, 2010: The Year we make contact. The existence of this species is only hypothesized by the rest of humanity, but it is obvious because the Monolith was immediately identified as an artifact of non-human origin. The extraterrestrial species that built the Monoliths developed intergalactic travel millions or perhaps billions of years before the present time. In the novels, Clarke refers to them as the \\"Firstborn\\" (not to be confused with the identically-named race in Arthur C. Clarke's and Stephen Baxter's Time Odyssey series) since they were quite possibly the first sapient species to possess a significant capability of interstellar travel. Members of this species explored the universe in the search of knowledge, especially knowledge about other intelligent species. While these early explorers discovered that life was quite common, they observed that intelligent life was often stunted in its development, or else died out prematurely. Hence, they set about fostering it. The Firstborn were in many ways physically different from human beings, though from another point of view they were fundamentally the same: they were creatures made of \\"flesh and blood\\", and hence, like human beings, they were mortal. However, the evolutionary development projects they began would by their nature require very long timespans to complete, far longer than the lifetimes of their creators. Therefore, the aliens created increasingly complex automated machines to oversee and carry out their projects over the eons. When they encountered a living world that had features in favor of the evolution of intelligent life, they left behind the monoliths as remote observers that were also capable of taking a variety of actions according to the wishes of their creators. One such planet, encountered when it was still quite young, was Earth. They also observed Jupiter and its watery moon, Europa. The decaying ecology of Mars was also visited, but passed over in favor of more fruitful locations like Earth. The aliens left behind three Monoliths to observe and enact their plan to encourage humans to pursue technology and space travel. As described in Clarke's novel, the Firstborn discovered later how to transfer their consciousness onto computers, and thus they became thinking machines. In the end, they surpassed even this achievement, and were able to transfer entirely from physical to non-corporeal forms‚Äîthe \\"Lords of the Galaxy\\"‚Äîomniscient, immortal, and capable of travelling at great speeds. The Firstborn had abandoned physical form, but their creations, the Monoliths, remained, and these continued to carry out their original assignments.  Tycho Magnetic Anomalies  The term \\"Tycho Magnetic Anomaly\\" is something of a misnomer when referring to \\"TMA-0\\" and \\"TMA-2\\", since neither of these is found on the Moon (let alone in Tycho Crater) and neither one of them emits any significant magnetic field, as described in the novel 2010: Odyssey Two (the characters in some of the novels refer to this anomalous nomenclature quizzically). In the novel, the Russian crewmen of the spaceship Alexei Leonov refer to TMA-2 as \\"Zagadka\\" (from the Russian word for \\"enigma\\", \\"mystery\\", or \\"riddle\\"). =Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1= The name Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-1 (also known as TMA-1) refers to the strong magnetic field found somewhere in the lunar Crater Tycho by an American scientific satellite. Astronauts find that this magnetic anomaly is caused by an alien Monolith buried about 15 meters below the surface. In the novel, when the Monolith is excavated and examined, it is found to be a black cuboid whose sides extend in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (1¬≤ : 2¬≤ : 3¬≤) and is sitting on a platform of the same material above undisturbed rock. Clarke suggests that this sequence or ratio extends past the three known spatial dimensions into much higher dimensions. TMA-1 was dug up during the lunar night, but after sunrise and its exposure to direct sunlight, TMA-1 emits a single powerful burst of radio waves ‚Äì aimed at Iapetus (a moon of Saturn) in the novel, and aimed at Jupiter in the motion picture. Its powerful magnetic field disappears immediately. In the novel, some scientists speculate that its magnetic field came from large electric currents, circulating in a system of superconductors for millions of years as an energy-storage mechanism. All of that electric power was expended in the one radio signal. =Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-2= An identical (except in size) object was found later, orbiting Jupiter (on a moon of Saturn in the book, although this was changed to Jupiter in the sequel book, 2010: Odyssey Two). This object was dubbed \\"TMA-2\\", a term that the book calls \\"doubly inappropriate\\": it had no magnetic field, and was millions of miles from Tycho (TMA-2 was often referred to as \\"Big Brother\\" due to David Bowman's comments on its immense size). In 3001: The Final Odyssey, HAL and Bowman destroy TMA-2 with a computer virus after it is learned that its superiors are sending an order to destroy humanity. =Tycho Magnetic Anomaly-0= In the year 2513, the first Monolith to be encountered by humankind's prehistoric evolutionary predecessors (the ones featured in the first novel) was found in Olduvai Gorge, buried in ancient rock, and was retroactively dubbed \\"TMA-0\\".  Other Monoliths  Other than the Monoliths bearing TMA labels, there are many other Monoliths that are seen in the series. In two instances, millions of Monoliths are generated for a limited time purpose. The first, in 2010: Odyssey Two, Monoliths are generated to transform Jupiter into a star, subsequently named Lucifer. The second, in 3001: The Final Odyssey, are generated to block both the Earth and human-settled Ganymede from their primary star in an attempt to destroy the humans. =The Great Wall= A large Monolith standing on its side on Europa is confirmed in 2061, though its existence is first implied in the second book. It is nicknamed the Great Wall after the Great Wall of China, due to its horizontal orientation. It is believed to be watching over the Europans in a manner similar to TMA-0 in the first book. Halman mentions that it was damaged by the impact of Mount Zeus, which is discovered to be a single vast diamond, a shard from Jupiter's core that struck Europa's surface some time following Jupiter's transformation. =Minilith= A small Monolith appears before Heywood Floyd in 2061 on board the Galaxy spacecraft. He nicknames it \\"Minilith\\" for its small size compared to other observed Monoliths. At the end of the book it is explained that Halman used the Minilith to replicate Heywood Floyd's consciousness to help him uncover the Monolith's operations. Appearance and capabilities In the movies, all the Monoliths are black, extremely flat, non-reflective rectangular solids. In the first novel, the monolith on the African savannah was transparent and \\"it was not easy to see except when the morning sun glinted on its edges\\", but became less transparent when active and was described as a crystal. Also, the final monolith is described as a transparent crystal that becomes less transparent when active. In the novels (not in the films), the dimensions of the monoliths are in the precise ratio of 1 : 4 : 9 (the squares of the first three positive integers). These dimensions are the main source of debate about the simple external design of the Monoliths. It is suggested in the 2001 novel that this number series does not stop at three dimensions.Clarke A (1968). 2001: A Space Odyssey, Signet. \\"How obvious‚Äîhow necessary‚Äîwas that mathematical ratio of its sides, the quadratic sequence 1:4:9! And how naive to have imagined that the series ended at this point, in only three dimensions!\\" The Monoliths come in several different sizes: TMA-0 and TMA-1 are both about 11 feet long and TMA-2 is two kilometres long on its longest axis, whereas the Monolith on Europa is considerably larger. They may be able to assume any size, because in 2010: Odyssey Two, the Star Child, created from the astronaut Dave Bowman, cryptically notes that the Monolith is actually one size ‚Äì \\"as large as necessary\\". The Monoliths are extremely long-lived and reliable machines, able to survive for millions of years buried in the ground or resisting meteorite impacts and radiation in space with no apparent damage. The two Monoliths recovered and examined by humans are virtually indestructible and impenetrable, resisting all attempts to analyse their composition or internal structure right up to the end of the series. Dr. Heywood Floyd proposes they have some sort of force shield, an impression he gets from touching it; this hypothesis is later accepted as probable because the Monoliths resist destructive testing beyond the theoretical limits of material strength. However, they are not completely indestructible: TMA-4 has suffered from damage caused by a giant meteorite of solid diamond that collided with Europa in 2061: Odyssey Three. In the final book, 3001: The Final Odyssey, all three Monoliths known to humankind are deactivated by being infected with a powerful computer virus. While it is unclear what the composition of the Monoliths is, they clearly have mass, which is about the only observation that can be made. In the novel 2010, the crewmen of the spaceship Alexei Leonov measure the mass of TMA-2 and find that it has a density slightly higher than that of air. The masses of TMA-0 and TMA-1 are never revealed by Clarke. In 2001, TMA-2 opens up a stargate that takes Dave Bowman on a trip across the universe at faster- than-light speeds, and with as much acceleration as the creators of the stargate wish. In 2010 and again in 3001, TMA-2 teleports itself. TMA-2 replicates itself by a form of symmetrical binary fission and exponential growth to create thousands or millions of identical Monoliths in just a matter of days. In 2010, the many units act to increase the density of Jupiter until stellar ignition is carried out, converting the planet into a miniature star. In 3001, millions of copies of TMA-2 assemble themselves into two megastructure disks that attempt to block the Sun from Earth and from its colonies in the Jovian system. The Monoliths are clearly described in the novels as controlled by an internal computer, like Von Neumann machines. In 2061, the consciousness of Dave Bowman, HAL-9000, and Dr. Floyd become incorporated as computer programs in TMA-2 as their new home. TMA-2 then observes the development of the Europans and guards them from any interplanetary (i.e. human) interference. Both TMA-1 and TMA-2 produce occasional, powerful, directional radio transmissions. TMA-2 sends a radio transmission towards a star system about 450 light years away in the 22nd century. However, only TMA-1 ever exhibited any strong magnetic fields. Actions The TMA-2 Monolith had judged that it would be desirable to nurture the primitive Europans by preventing the eventual freezing of their moon, and to keep humanity separated from them. TMA-2 thus converted Jupiter into a new star (dubbed \\"Lucifer\\", meaning \\"light-bringer\\") to warm Europa into more habitable conditions ‚Äì at the cost of exterminating the Jovians, ocean-like creatures who swam through the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. The Jovians were judged too primitive, as due to their environment they had no hope of ever developing to become an advanced civilization. TMA-2 also apparently decided, in the early 21st century, that humanity was a failed species and that it was possibly necessary to destroy them. Apparently the TMA-2 Monolith was allowed to destroy primitive species at its own discretion, but needed the authorisation of a \\"superior\\" to destroy an advanced spaceflight-capable civilisation such as humanity. This \\"superior\\" was a Monolith located in a distant star system, but even the Monoliths were limited by the speed of light in their interstellar communications. Thus it took 450 years for the message sent by TMA-2 to reach its \\"superior\\", which then sent a message giving permission to destroy humanity, which took another 450 years to return to the Sol system in the year 3001. Due to the efforts of Frank Poole and the Europa team on Earth, the ascended Dave Bowman and AI HAL (now fused as one being \\"Halman\\" in the Monolith's computational matrix) were able to introduce a subtle computer virus into TMA-2 which destroyed it before it could render the human race extinct. The Firstborn did not appear to have abandoned all interest in the evolutionary experiments overseen by the ancient Monoliths. The Monoliths' communications are said to be limited by the speed of light, but Dave Bowman is sent on an interstellar journey at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Bowman is apparently transformed into the Star Child, not by the Monoliths, but by the Firstborn (both Kubrick and Clarke have similarly stated that Bowman was transformed by non-corporeal aliens, not the Monoliths). They also subsequently transform HAL in 2010, to give Bowman a companion. The epilogue to 3001: The Final Odyssey reveals that the Firstborn had been monitoring humanity's final confrontation with the Monoliths in the Sol system, but chose not to intervene. Unlike the TMA-2 Monolith, whose judgment of humanity was based on its social progress by the year 2001, the Firstborn considered the more peaceful and responsible humanity of the year 3001 worthy of survival, or at least not a threat to the Europans. Their assessment seems to prove true, as subsequently Frank Poole and the other humans land on Europa and attempt to start peaceful relations with the primitive native Europans. Design The first design for the Monolith for the 2001 film was a tetrahedral pyramid. This was taken from the 1951 short story \\"The Sentinel\\" that the first story was based on.https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/07/unseen-images-2011-space- odyssey-making A London firm was approached to provide a plexiglass pyramid, and due to construction constraints they recommended a flat slab shape. Kubrick approved, but was disappointed with the glassy appearance of the prop on set, leading art director Anthony Masters to suggest making the monolith black. Replicas Monolith replica at HAL 2001 A variety of replicas has been exposed in a number places as a tribute to the movie. Hackers at Large, 2001. During the Dutch hacker conference HAL, a replica of the monolith was erected. √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, 2020. In June 2020, a 4.5 meters tall wood- made replica was found in the main courtyard of ENS.

Domestic career Farhat made his senior debut aged 15 in a one-day match for Karachi City against Malaysia, together with three other players who went on to play Test cricket (Taufeeq Umar, Bazid Khan and Kamran Akmal). He continued to score heavily in the domestic competitions and a century in a practise game against the visiting Indian team was rewarded with a place in the squad to take on India in the Test series in 2006. He was the leading run-scorer for Habib Bank Limited in the 2017‚Äì18 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, with 494 runs in ten matches. He was also the leading run-scorer for Habib Bank Limited in the 2018‚Äì19 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, with 744 runs in eleven matches. In September 2019, he was named in Balochistan's squad for the 2019‚Äì20 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy tournament. International career Three years later, in February 2001, Farhat made his One Day International debut, against New Zealand in Auckland, scoring 20 runs in a chase of 150 to win. After the tour of New Zealand, where Farhat played three Tests and three ODIs, he was sent back to domestic cricket before returning against Australia in the third Test of the 2002‚Äì03 series, where he made 30 and 22 in an innings defeat. However, he was retained for the home two-Test series against South Africa in 2003‚Äì04, where he scored 235 runs including a maiden Test century in a 1‚Äì0 series win, second behind fellow opener Taufeeq Umar. A month later, Farhat played in an ODI-only series against New Zealand, which Pakistan won 5‚Äì0, and Farhat made three fifties along with his second international century, ending with 348 runs at a batting average of 69.60, once again the second-highest number of runs ‚Äì this time behind Yasir Hameed. The season was rounded off with another century, this time against India, where he made 101 to help Pakistan gain a 202-run first- innings lead and eventually won the match by nine wickets. However, Farhat tallied 81 runs in the other two matches, which Pakistan lost to lose the series 1‚Äì2. Farhat was less impressive the following season, however, and in four Tests, two against Sri Lanka and two against Australia, he only passed fifty twice, ending the season with 199 runs at 24.87 before the selectors left him out for the third Test of the series with Australia. In September 2004, just before the 2004‚Äì2005 season, he had been dropped from the ODI side following the 2004 Champions Trophy, as he had failed to pass 40 with any of his last ten innings, and that included 38 not out against the non-Test nation of Kenya, 20 against ODI debutants Hong Kong and 24 against Bangladesh. He returned to Test cricket in style against India, with an important half century in the deciding third Test at Karachi. He scored a brilliant unbeaten century in the final test against New Zealand in 2009.

He is primarily an Opening batsman who plays in the Pakistan national cricket team in Test cricket, One Day International and Twenty20 cricket formats.He was best known for his big hitting. He was also Fakhr e Pir Mahal. Domestic career In 2008, Nazir signed for the Indian Cricket League and played for the Lahore Badshahs. He scored 111 runs not out, off just 44 deliveries, against the Hyderabad Heroes in the third of the best of three finals of the tournament and helped his team achieve victory. After signing up for the Indian Cricket League, his chances of ever playing again for Pakistan looked slim. However, on 2 February 2009, a Pakistani court suspended the ban on Indian Cricket League players, which paved the way for Nazir to make a return to the One Day International and Twenty20 squad during their tour of Sri Lanka in August 2009. Since then, he has played two National T20 cups. He was selected for the Hong Kong Sixes tournament 2010 in Hong Kong as a member of Pakistani squad. The final match, which was in Pakistan's favour, was lost due to Imran Nazir's bowling. 46 runs was required from the last 8-ball over but Imran Nazir gave away 48 runs in 7 balls. In Twenty20 games he has a bowling average of 1.00 and in his 8 deliveries he has 3 wickets a strike rate of less than 3. He has also played for Dhaka Dynamites in Bangladesh's NCL T20 Bangladesh.

His highest score is 58 and he has scored 2 half centuries in this tournament and has hit twenty one 4s and nine 6s. He has played for Lahore Qalandars in 2018 Abu Dhabi T20 Trophy. International career Nazir made his debut in Test cricket in March 1999 against Sri Lanka at Lahore in Pakistan, and his One Day International debut against the same opposition at Visakhapatnam in India. He played in 8 Test matches between 1999‚Äì2002 and secured a spot in the Pakistan squad since 2002. He also played in One Day International arena, but he could never cement his place in the squad. The emergence of several Pakistan opening batsmen such as Imran Farhat, Mohammad Hafeez, Yasir Hameed, Taufeeq Umar, and Salman Butt kept him out of the national side. However, he displayed excellent cricketing performances in first-class cricket. Nazir made his return to the national team in the second One Day International against South Africa in February 2007 during Pakistan's tour of South Africa. He impressed the Pakistan national selectors with his innings of 57 runs from just 39 deliveries, though he struggled to score runs during the rest of the tournament. Nazir was named in Pakistan's squad for the 2007 World Cup. He scored 160 runs against Zimbabwe in Pakistan's last match during the 2007 Cricket World Cup, after being knocked out by Ireland. It was the second highest score by a Pakistani batsman and the eighth highest score by any batsman in World Cup history and his 8 sixes equalled the World Cup record of Australian batsman, Ricky Ponting. It was also the highest runs he scored in List A cricket. He now remains a regular member of Pakistan's Twenty20 squads. He was given another chance against New Zealand int two T20I's held in Dubai which Pakistan won 2‚Äì0. Next time, he was given a chance against Australia in only T20I in Australia but could not bat much. He showed the same form against England in February 2010 in two T2OI's and was consequently dropped from the Pakistani side. Nazir was recalled to the Pakistan team in September 2012 for the Twenty20 series against Australia and the following ICC World Twenty20 which was held in Sri Lanka. He scored 153 runs in 6 matches with a reasonable average of 25.50 and with a marvelous strike rate of 150.00 which included a match winning innings of 72 against Bangladesh.

On 1 July 2018, Malik also became the first Asian batsman to score 2,000 runs in T20Is, and third overall and first player to play 100 T20Is in the world. In August 2018, during the 2018 Caribbean Premier League tournament, he became the fourth batsman to score 8,000 runs in T20s. In July 2019, following Pakistan's last match in the 2019 Cricket World Cup, Shoaib announced his retirement from ODI cricket. On 10 October 2020, in the 2020‚Äì21 National T20 Cup, Shoaib Malik became the first Pakistani batsman to score 10,000 runs in Twenty20 cricket, doing so in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's match against Balochistan.  Early career  Malik was born in Sialkot. He first played tape-ball cricket in the streets as a child. He began playing cricket seriously in 1993/94 when he attended Imran Khan's coaching clinics in Sialkot. He began as a batsman, and developed his bowling later. He used to get in trouble with his family for playing cricket, as they wanted him to focus on his education. In 1996, Malik attended trials for the U-15 World Cup. He was selected in the squad for his bowling. In May 2001, Malik's bowling action was inspected. The PCB group of bowling advisers concluded that his stock off-spinner was legal, although his delivery going the other way was not. He was encouraged to concentrate on his off-spin and to practice bowling his other delivery without bending his arm. In a One Day International (ODI) match against England in June 2001, Malik suffered a fractured right shoulder after falling awkwardly while attempting to take a catch. Malik was approached by Gloucestershire County Cricket Club in July 2003 to act as a replacement for Ian Harvey, who was on international duty with Australia. John Bracewell, the club's director of cricket, commented that he was \\"excited by the prospect of signing an international spinning all-rounder to replace Ian during the Cheltenham Festival and the C&G; semi-finals. He will add a new and refreshing dimension to the sq¬≠uad ... which is in keeping with our playing philosophy to both win and entertain\\". He sufficiently impressed in two County Championship and three one-day matches that resulted in renewing of his contract for the 2004 season. Mark Alleyne, the club's head coach, remarked that \\"Shoaib did very well for us last year in the short time he was with us and fitted in very well. He is a gifted all-rounder who is worthy of a place in either discipline and as a 21-year-old, he can only get better and I am really pleased at having him in my squad¬≠\\". Over the course of his two seasons at Gloucestershire, Malik played eight first-class matches, scoring 214 runs at an average of 17.83 with two fifties and taking 15 wickets at an average of 45.06, with best bowling figures of 3/76. He also played twelve one-day matches, scoring 345 runs at an average of 43.12 with three fifties and taking 10 wickets at an average of 47.60, with best bowling figures of 3/28. In October 2004, Malik was reported to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for having a \\"potentially flawed bowling action\\"; eight months later, his action was cleared. In the intervening period, Malik was used mainly as a batsman. He was also given a one-Test ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board after admitting to deliberately losing a Twenty20 match for the Sialkot Stallions against Karachi Zebras to knock Lahore Eagles out of the 2004‚Äì05 ABN-AMRO Twenty-20 Cup. The inquiry concluded that the incident \\"damaged Pakistan's cricketing image and had shown disrespect to the crowd\\", but that \\"his actions were not part of any match-fixing with no financial implications, but were an immature attempt to express his disappointment at earlier decisions in the competition that he felt went against his side\\". During his Test career, Malik has batted at 5 different positions and has the unusual record of batting at every position except 11th in ODIs. Pakistan's problems in finding a reliable opening pair have led to Malik being used as an opener in Test and ODI matches. In Test cricket, he made a big impression with his match-saving innings against Sri Lanka in 2006, during which he batted for the whole day and finished with 148 runs not out. His bowling has been effective at times, especially in one-day cricket where his best bowling figures are four wickets for 19 runs (4/19) in addition to many 3-wicket hauls. On the international stage Malik struggled in England. In 12 ODIs across four tours between 2001 and 2006 he scored 98 runs at an average of 8.16, with just two scores above 20, far below his career ODI average of 34.35. Of players who have played at least eight ODIs in England, Malik's is the furthest below his overall average. His knock of 128 against India at Centurion in 2009 was later nominated to be one of the Best ODI Batting Performance of the year by ESPNcricinfo. Pakistan captaincy Shoaib Malik playing against New Zealand at Dunedin, 2009 Following Inzamam-ul-Haq's resignation as Pakistan captain after the 2007 World Cup, Malik was put forward as one of the names for the captaincy along with Younis Khan and Mohammad Yousuf. After Younus Khan's rejection, Malik was the popular choice as a younger player and was seen to represent a fresh start after the Inzamam era. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo for the 2007 T20I World Cup. Pakistan's coach, Bob Woolmer, was a strong advocate of Malik's case to become captain; in Woolmer's opinion Malik was \\"the sharpest tactical tack among his group ... a real presence on the field\\". Former skipper Imran Khan also backed Malik for the role, stating \\"He appears to have a good cricket brain and could turn out to be a very good choice for Pakistan cricket\\". Malik was appointed captain on 19 April 2007 by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), his experience considering his relatively young age and consistent performances were cited as other reasons for his appointment. At the age of just 25, he was Pakistan's fourth youngest captain. In Malik's first series as captain, Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka 2‚Äì1 in an ODI series in Abu Dhabi. His next assignments were home Test and ODI series against South Africa, which Pakistan lost 1‚Äì0 and 3‚Äì2 respectively. 3‚Äì2 was the score in favour of India when Pakistan subsequently played an ODI series against their arch-rivals. Malik hit 89 and took three wickets in the final match, which Pakistan won by 31 runs. Malik's captaincy lasted two years. A report by the coach and manager criticised his leadership, claiming that Malik was \\"a loner, aloof and involved in his own little world, which is OK but not when the team required a fully committed captain We do not see any meaningful communication between players and captain other than his five-minute talk during the team meeting\\". Younis Khan took over as captain on 27 January 2009 after a poor performance against Sri Lanka saw Malik step down. In his two-year tenure as captain, Malik led his country in three Tests, losing two and drawing one, and 36 ODIs, of which Pakistan won 24, and 17 T20Is, winning 12. When Pakistan were touring South Africa in December 2018-February 2019, Sarfraz Ahmed, the current captain banned for under ICC for racistal comments on SA player Andile Phehlukwayo, Malik had taken charge for his limited overs till that tour 2 ODIs and 3 T20Is. Post-captaincy In March 2010, Shoaib Malik was given a one-year ban from the national team by the PCB, who charged him for infighting within the team. It was part of a dramatic cull of players after Pakistan's winless tour of Australia, resulting in the fining or banning of seven players. Two months later Lancashire County Cricket Club approached Malik to play for them during Twenty20 Cup. He agreed, saying \\"When Lancashire approached me to come and play for them I didn't hesitate in saying yes. I love playing cricket in England and the opportunity to play with a club of Lancashire's reputation was too good to pass up\\". On 29 May 2010, Malik's ban was overturned and his Rs 2 million fine halved. He was subsequently named in the MSL 2019 squad, and as a result, Malik pulled out of his contract with Lancashire. Pakistan did not make the final of the four-team tournament, and Malik played in two matches, amassing 47 runs. Mailk was in Pakistan's squad to play Australia and England in England in June‚ÄìAugust 2010, but was dropped from the side. A regular in the ODI side, over the previously 12 months he had averaged around 30 with the bat in ODIs, and excluding one score over 50, his batting average hovered around 20. Mohsin Khan, Pakistan's chairman of selectors, cited Malik's poor recent form as the reason for dropping him. After Malik's comeback to international cricket in 2015, he was an integral part of the Pakistan squad who were crowned champions of the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 by defeating arch-rivals India in the final. In April 2018, he was named in the Rest of the World XI squad for the one-off T20I against the West Indies, to be played at Lord's on 31 May 2018. In August 2018, he was one of thirty-three players to be awarded a central contract for the 2018‚Äì19 season by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Comilla Victorians team, following the draft for the 2018‚Äì19 Bangladesh Premier League. In April 2019, he was named in Pakistan's squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. He had a horrible World Cup campaign, with only 8 runs from 3 matches, with two golden ducks, and took only 1 wicket with the ball, and was even dropped from the team. Following the Cricket World Cup, Shoaib retired from ODI cricket. In June 2020, he was named in a 29-man squad for Pakistan's tour to England during the COVID-19 pandemic. Playing style According to Cricinfo's Osman Samiuddin: Malik is regarded as a flexible player. He is capable of hitting big shots but is also capable of rotating the strike with good placement. He has a strike rate of 80.4 runs per 100 balls, which compares favourably to players such as Rahul Dravid and Inzamam ul-Haq. His most brazen display of \\"power hitting\\" came in 2003 against South Africa when he scored 82 from 41 balls. As is required of most modern players, he also has displayed good defensive batting at times. With Shoaib Malik Pakistan has become only country to have three batsman in T20I who have scored more than 1,500 runs. These are Umar Akmal, Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik.He is currently the leading Run scorer for Pakistan in T20 internationals with more than 2,000 Runs (as of 7 Nov 2018). =Domestic cricket= Shoaib Malik was captain of the now defunct Sialkot Stallions. He led them to a world record 8 domestic T20 titles with the last one coming on 18 May 2015. In April 2018, he was named as the captain of Punjab's squad for the 2018 Pakistan Cup. T20 franchise cricket =Pakistan Super League= Shoaib Malik was appointed the captain of the Karachi Kings in the first PSL tournament. His team under his captaincy won only two matches in the whole tournament which also affected his own performance. In the last match, he handed over the captaincy to Ravi Bopara and appeared as a player in the match. He was retained by the kings for the second season. He had a much better season compared to the first one, as he scored runs in crucial matches and ended the season as third highest-runs scorer for his side, scoring 202 runs in 10 innings. In third season, he joined new PSL franchise Multan Sultans as their captain. He led his team well during the first part of the tournament but couldn't maintain the form when it mattered the most, as a result finished the tournament at 5th place. He had a good tournament with bat as well, scoring 224 runs across 8 innings with a strike rate of 124.44. As a result of the termination of the Multan Sultans franchise before the fourth season of the PSL due to fee-payment issues, the PCB created a new team up for bidding, temporarily named as The Sixth Team, of which Malik is was assigned the role of captain. After being demoted from Platinum category to Diamond Category and after being released by Multan Sultans, Shoaib Malik was picked by Peshawar Zalmi in the 2020 Pakistan Super League players draft and will play in the 2020 Pakistan Super League representing Peshawar Zalmi as an all-rounder. =Other leagues= In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Vancouver Knights franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. In November 2019, he was selected to play for Rajshahi Royals in the 2019-20 Bangladesh Premier League. Personal life Shoaib with his wife, Sania Mirza, 2012 On 12 April 2010, he married Indian Tennis player Sania Mirza in a traditional Hyderabadi Muslim wedding ceremony at the Taj Krishna Hotel in Hyderabad, India followed by Pakistani wedding customs. Their Walima ceremony was held in Sialkot, Pakistan. Their wedding received media and online attention across the world. The couple announced their first pregnancy via social media on 23 April 2018. Their first child, a boy, was born on 30 October 2018. His first marriage was with Ayesha Siddiqui (Maha Siddiqui).

He was the youngest son of the 1st Duke. He did not marry, and the dukedom expired with him, although the earldom was inherited by a cousin, Lieutenant-General John Egerton. A pioneer of canal construction, he is famed as the \\"father of British inland navigation\\", who commissioned the Bridgewater Canal‚Äîoften said to be the first true canal in Britain, and the modern world. The canal was built for him by his agent John Gilbert with advice from James Brindley to service his coal mines at Worsley, in Lancashire. Life Bridgewater, the younger son of Scroop Egerton, 1st Duke of Bridgewater, was born on the 21 May 1736. Upon the death of their father in 1745, his elder brother inherited the title to become John Egerton, 2nd Duke of Bridgewater. He died only three years later, and Francis succeeded to the dukedom at the age of twelve, becoming 3rd Duke of Bridgewater and 6th Earl of Bridgewater. As a child Francis was sickly and of such unpromising intellectual capacity that at one time the idea of cutting the entail was seriously entertained by his mother. Despite this, after some education, Francis began to exhibit business acumen and developed several business interests in North-West England. Shortly after attaining his majority he became engaged to the society beauty the Dowager Duchess of Hamilton, but her refusal to give up the acquaintance of her sister, Lady Coventry, led to the breaking off of the match. Thereupon the Duke broke up his London establishment, and retired to his estate at Worsley where he devoted himself to the making of canals. =Canals= The Bridgewater Canal from Worsley to Manchester which he constructed to transport coal obtained on his estates is usually cited as the first modern British canal as opposed to a river navigation‚Äîalthough the Sankey Canal is a rival to this claim, projected as a \\"navigation\\", but built as a true canal. The construction of Bridgewater's canal, with its aqueduct across the River Irwell, was carried out by James Brindley, the celebrated engineer. The completion of his first canal led the duke to undertake a more ambitious work. In 1762 he obtained parliamentary powers to provide an improved waterway between Liverpool and Manchester by means of a canal. The difficulties encountered in its execution were still more formidable than those of the Worsley canal, involving carrying it across Sale Moor Moss. But the genius of John Gilbert, his agent and Brindley, his engineer, proved superior to all obstacles although at one period the duke's financial resources were almost exhausted, the work was carried to a triumphant conclusion. Both canals were completed by the time Bridgewater was thirty-six years of age, and the remainder of his life was spent in extending them and in improving his estates. During the latter years of his life he derived a princely income from the success of his enterprise. Although a supporter of Pitt's administration, he took no prominent part in politics. =Wealth= Memorial to the 3rd Duke of Bridgewater in the Bridgewater Chapel at St. Peter and St. Paul Church, Little Gaddesden, where many Egerton family members are buried The duke accumulated great wealth through his canal and coal interests. His annual income was said to have exceeded ¬£80,000. The family owned other estates: Belton House, a small Sussex estate and the Old House and, 6,000 acres (24 km¬≤) at Ashridge. On leaving his Brackley and Worsley estates, the duke had an annual income in taxes and duties of ¬£75,000 (estimated in 1997 as ¬£2,360,000). The father of the first duke had bought Cleveland House in St James, London, which was rebuilt to the designs of Sir Charles Barry in 1840 and renamed Bridgewater House in 1854 for Lord Ellesmere, heir of the 3rd Duke. With the Bridgewater fortune exceeding ¬£2,000,000, the duke, the richest nobleman in England, set about rebuilding Ashridge. He began to pull the old buildings down, but he died before his plans could be completed, leaving his heir with nothing but rubble. He was the leading member of the syndicate which purchased and partly resold the famous Orleans Collection, from the banker Jeremiah Harman in 1789. He acquired an art collection valued at ¬£150,000 (estimated in 1997 about ¬£4.75 million). It was composed of several old master paintings including Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto. It was inherited by his heir, 1st Duke of Sutherland. Most of his purchases are still held by the Egerton family. Legacy and memorials The duke died unmarried on 8 March 1803, and the ducal title became extinct although the Earldom of Bridgewater passed to a cousin, Lieutenant-General John Egerton, who became 7th Earl). The 3rd Duke of Bridgewater was buried in the Egerton family vault in the Church of St Peter and St Paul in Little Gaddesden, close to Ashridge. By his will the duke devised his canals and estates on trust, under which his nephew, the 2nd Marquess of Stafford (afterwards 1st Duke of Sutherland), became the first beneficiary, and next his son Lord Francis Leveson-Gower (afterwards 1st Earl of Ellesmere) and his issue. In order that the trust should last as long as possible, an extraordinary use was made of the legal rule that property may be settled for the duration of lives in being and twenty-one years after. The legatees were a great number of persons connected with the duke and their living issue, plus all peers who had taken their seats in the House of Lords on or before the duke's decease. The last of the peers died in 1857, but one of the commoners survived till 19 October 1883, and so the trust did not expire until 19 October 1903, when the whole property passed to the undivided control of Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere. The canals had by then been transferred to the Bridgewater Navigation Company in 1872, by whom they were sold in 1887 to the Manchester Ship Canal Company. The duke is commemorated in a number of locations around Britain. A marble wall monument in Little Gaddesden Church is dedicated to his memory, and on the nearby Ashridge Estate, the Bridgewater Monument was erected in 1832 'in honour of Francis, Third duke of Bridgewater, \\"Father of Inland Navigation\\"'. The Bridgewater Canal in North West England, still in existence today, bears the Duke's name. In the 1830s, the possibility was discussed of raising a memorial to the Canal Duke in Manchester, but at the time public statuary was relatively unknown outside London. Illustrations exist of unrealised 1836 proposal by William Fairbairn to build a Bridgewater Crescent at the eastern end of Piccadilly in Manchester, to be adorned with a statue of the Duke of Bridgewater. To date, no statue has been erected in Manchester to commemorate the Canal Duke. A 1788 portrait drawing of the Duke of Bridgewater by William Marshall Craig was engraved by Edward Scriven in 1835; prints are held in the National Portrait Gallery, London and the Scottish National Gallery in Edinburgh. Two Wax medallion portraits of the Duke by Peter Rouw dating from 1803 are held at the National Portrait Gallery and at Tatton Hall in Cheshire. Francis Egerton is depicted in one of The Manchester Murals painted by Ford Madox Brown between 1879 and 1893. The Opening of the Bridgewater Canal A.D. 1761 shows the Duke of Bridgewater standing on a barge decorated with flags of his coat of arms, alongside engineer James Brindley, observing the launch of the first coal barges on his new canal. In 1905, Francis Egerton, 3rd Earl of Ellesmere erected a fountain in Worsley Green, Salford, in memory of the Duke of Bridgewater, after a former factory built by the duke there was demolished. In 1996, a new concert hall named after the duke was opened in Manchester, the Bridgewater Hall ‚Äî although the hall is actually situated next to the adjoining Rochdale Canal.

Since this ruling, there have been no criminal laws regulating abortion in Canada.  Background  Prior to this ruling, section 251(4) of the Criminal Code,RSC 1970, c C-34. Now Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 s 287. allowed for abortions to be performed solely at accredited hospitals with the proper certification of approval from the hospital's Therapeutic Abortion Committee. Three doctors, Dr. Henry Morgentaler, Dr. Leslie Frank Smoling and Dr. Robert Scott, set up an abortion clinic in Toronto for the purpose of performing abortions on women who had not received certification from the Therapeutic Abortion Committee, as required under subsection 251(4) of the Criminal Code. In so doing, they were attempting to bring public attention to their cause, claiming a woman should have complete control over the decision on whether to have an abortion. Morgentaler had previously challenged the abortion law at the Supreme Court in the pre-Charter case of Morgentaler v R,[1976] 1 SCR 616. in which the Court denied having the judicial authority to strike down the law. The Court of Appeal for Ontario found in favour of the government. On appeal, the main issue put before the Court was whether section 251 violated section 7 of the Charter. A secondary issue put to the Court was whether the creation of anti-abortion law was ultra vires (\\"outside the power\\") of the federal government's authority to create law.  Ruling  The Court ruled 5 to 2 that the law violated section 7 and could not be saved under section 1. Morgentaler's previous acquittal was restored. There were three different opinions given by the majority, none having achieved more than two signatures. As such, no Morgentaler precedent is binding. = Dickson = Perhaps the most prominent majority opinion was that of Dickson CJ, with Lamer J (as he then was) concurring. Dickson began by examining section 7. He found that section 251 forced some women to carry a fetus irrespective of her own \\"priorities and aspirations\\". This was a clear infringement of security of person. He found a further violation due to the delay created by the mandatory certification procedure which put the women at higher risk of physical harm and caused harm to their psychological integrity. Following a standard section 7 analysis, Dickson examined whether the violation accorded with the principles of fundamental justice. He found that it did not because the excessive requirements prevented smaller hospitals from providing such services thus preventing many women from even applying for certification. Moreover, he found that the administrative system failed to provide adequate evaluation criteria which allowed the committees to grant or deny therapeutic abortions arbitrarily. Dickson found that the violation could not be justified under section 1, focusing on the means chosen by the government to achieve its objectives. In the end, the law failed on every step of the proportionality test. First, he found the administrative process was often unfair and arbitrary. Second, the resultant impairment of the women's rights was beyond what was necessary to evaluate their case. Third, the effect of the impairment far outweighed the importance of the law's objective. = Beetz = Beetz J, joined by Estey J, wrote a second opinion finding the abortion law invalid. In it, Beetz noted that by adopting section 251(4), the government acknowledged that the interest of the state to protect the woman is greater than its interest to protect the fetus when \\"the continuation of the pregnancy of such female person would or would be likely to endanger her life or health\\". The Justice's reasoning closely resembled that of the Chief Justice. He found a violation of section 7 as the procedural requirements of section 251 were \\"manifestly unfair\\". Beetz's reasoning in the section 1 analysis was also similar to that of Dickson. He found that the objective had no rational connection to the means, meaning the law could not be justified. He also speculated that if the government were to enact a new abortion law, this law would require a higher degree of danger to the woman in the later months rather than the early months for an abortion to be allowed. In this case, it could be sufficiently justifiable under section 1. In examining whether the law was ultra vires, Beetz examined sections 91 and 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867. He decided that the law was within the power of the federal government on account that the committee was not given any power over any provincial jurisdiction under section 91 nor did it function in any sort of judicial manner under section 96. = Wilson = Wilson J wrote her own concurring opinion taking a significantly different approach. She held that section 251 violates two rights: liberty and security of person. She emphasized how section 251 violated a woman's personal autonomy by preventing her from making decisions affecting her and her fetus' life. To Wilson, a woman's decision to abort her fetus is one that is so profound on so many levels it goes beyond being a medical decision and becomes a social and ethical one as well. By removing the women's ability to make the decision and giving it to a committee would be a clear violation of their liberty and security of person. Wilson scathingly noted the state is effectively taking control of a woman's capacity to reproduce. Wilson went on to agree with the other judges that section 251 (prohibiting the performance of an abortion except under certain circumstances) is procedurally unfair, adding that the violation of section 7 also has the effect of violating section 2(a) of the Charter (freedom of conscience) in that the requirements for a woman to be permitted to obtain an abortion legally (or for a doctor to legally perform one) were in many cases so onerous or effectively impossible that they were \\"resulting in a failure to comply with the principles of fundamental justice\\". The decision to abort is primarily a moral one, she noted, and therefore by preventing her from doing so, the decision violates a woman's right to conscientiously-held beliefs. With the abortion law, the government was supporting one conscientiously-held belief at the expense of another, and in effect, was treating women as a means to an end and depriving them of their \\"essential humanity\\". Wilson also stated that In her analysis of section 1, Wilson noted the value placed on the fetus is proportional to its stage of gestation and the legislation must take that into account. However, here, the law cannot be justified because it takes the decision-making power away from the woman absolutely and therefore cannot pass the proportionality test. Dissent A dissent was written by McIntyre J, with La Forest J concurring. McIntyre found that there was no right to an abortion under section 7 nor under other laws. His argument was based on the role of judicial review and how the courts must not go about creating rights not explicitly found in the Charter nor interpret Charter rights to protect interests that the rights were not initially intending to protect. He said that nowhere in any constitutional texts, history or philosophies is there support for any such rights. Furthermore, there is no societal consensus that these interests should be protected either. Even if a right could be found, said McIntyre, the case would not have been sufficient to prove a violation. The provisions of section 251(4) cannot be said to be \\"manifestly unfair\\" on the basis that some women do not have access. The problems with administrative procedure are external to the legislation and cannot be the basis of a violation. Aftermath When the decision was announced, it was sometimes reported to be more broad than it was; the decision did not declare a constitutional right to abortion nor \\"freedom of choice\\". The Progressive Conservative government of Prime Minister Mulroney made two attempts to pass a new abortion law. The first proposal, in the spring of 1988, did not pass the House of Commons. The second attempt, introduced by the Minister of Justice as Bill C-43 in late 1989, would be defeated on a tie vote by the time it came to third reading in Senate on January 31, 1991, leaving Canada without criminal legislation governing abortion. The Criminal Code still contains the abortion provision struck down by the Supreme Court, now as section 287.

Guardian resembles an earlier Kirby and Simon character Captain America (first published 13 months earlier by Marvel Comics) where he had no super powers and carried an indestructible shield. In the Arrowverse series Supergirl, James Olsen who was portrayed by Mehcad Brooks became the superhero Guardian. However James Harper appeared in the first season as a marine colonel portrayed by Eddie McClintock.  Publication history  He first appeared in Star-Spangled Comics #7 (April 1942) and was created by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon. Fictional character biography =Jim Harper= Guardian (Jim Harper) and the Newsboy Legion's debut. Jim Harper is a police officer in Metropolis' Suicide Slum who becomes a vigilante to catch crooks that the law could not prosecute, describing himself as guarding society from criminals. He was trained to fighting condition by ex-boxer Joe Morgan (the same man who trained two other mystery men, Wildcat and the first Atom). He doesn't have superpowers, but he carries a bulletproof shield. He's aided by a group of boys known as the Newsboy Legion, to whom he is, literally, a guardian, having volunteered to take them in rather than allowing them to be sent to prison; he does so on the grounds that they're basically good kids who just needed a chance. The Legion grows up to become the heads of the Cadmus Project, subsequently saving Harper's life by transferring his mind from his old, dying body into a younger clone of himself. It's later revealed that Jim Harper is the great-uncle of Roy Harper, who becomes Green Arrow's sidekick under the name of \\"Speedy\\".Superboy #82 (January 2001) DC Comics. Other relatives include his niece Roberta \\"Famous Bobby\\" Harper, who is briefly a member of the second Newsboy LegionGuardians of Metropolis #1 (November 1994) DC Comics and Jamie Harper, his grandniece working for the Gotham City Police Department. She works as Robin's personal contact in the GCPD, similar to the role Commissioner James Gordon plays for Batman.Detective Comics #817 (May 2006) DC Comics After helping Robin and Jason Bard expose two dirty cops in the GCPD, Jamie Harper is promoted to Detective Specialist and transfers to the Metropolis Science Police.Superman #687 (June 2009) DC Comics. =Golden Guardian= In Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen #135 (January 1971), Jack Kirby reintroduces the boys of the now grown-up Newsboy Legion as supporting characters connected with the DNA Project (later Project Cadmus), a genetics research laboratory. One of the Project's experiments is a clone of the late Jim Harper, who takes up his predecessor's role, and becomes the Project's Head of Security as the Golden Guardian. Post-Crisis this character is simply known as the Guardian. Harper remains Cadmus' Head of Security even after the former Newsboys leave. Eventually, he too is killed, although another clone is created and rapidly aged to adulthood, retaining all his predecessor's memories. This Guardian disappears along with the rest of Cadmus following an altercation with Amanda Waller and President Luthor, and his whereabouts are unknown.  Post-Infinite Crisis  Following Infinite Crisis, the Guardian clone's backstory was retconned. As Dubbilex explains to Jimmy Olsen, Jim Harper was not killed in the line of duty, but shot by Cadmus' first head of security, Jonathan Drew, upon discovering the clone was already being created. It's also revealed that the original Guardian clone had left Cadmus early on, and was now living in the town of Warpath on the Mexican border, where he assisted Sheriff Greg Saunders. Subsequent appearances of the Guardian had been new clones, each of which died within a year.Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen one-shot (October 2008) The original Guardian clone has decided to move to Metropolis with Gwen, his adopted daughter (in fact, an adolescent female clone of himself that he rescued), during the New Krypton storyline.Adventure Comics Special #1 (January 2009) DC Comics Science Police team leaders DuBarry and Daniels, along with several prison guards, are killed during the events of New Krypton when a team of Kandorians led by Commander Gor assault Stryker's Island and demand custody of Parasite.Superman #682 (January 2009).

The issues of Detective Comics published during the One Year Later event, reveals that Harper has a grandniece, Jamie,Detective Comics #819 formerly a detective of Gotham City Police Department and a former associate of Robin III. The Guardian later travels to the JLA Watchtower to warn the Justice League after finding a teleportation device in Metropolis. While on the Watchtower, the heroes are attacked by Prometheus, who blinds the Guardian. In the aftermath of the attack, Guardian and Mon-El are recruited by Kimiyo Hoshi to join the Justice League.Justice League of America (vol. 2) #41 (January 2010) On his first and only mission with the team, the Guardian helps battle Doctor Impossible's gang of villains. After a mere three issues, the Guardian was written out of the book due to writer James Robinson's desire to work with a smaller cast. Following the events of War of the Supermen, Harper abandons his role as the Guardian and takes Jamie (now pregnant with Mon-El's child) off to an unknown destination.War of the Supermen #4 =Mal Duncan= In Teen Titans #44 (November 1976), the previously uncostumed Titan Mal Duncan takes the name of the Guardian, wearing the original's outfit and an exoskeleton with strength augmenting abilities. The two Guardians finally meet in Superman Family #s 191-193 (Sept 78-Feb 79), when Mal helps rescue the Harper clone from Adam, an evil clone created using genetic material from both Harper and Dubbilex who have taken control of the DNA Project. The Crisis on Infinite Earths removes Duncan's career as the Guardian, although he does appear briefly in his Guardian costume during the Crisis itself. Mal makes appearances in the first two seasons of Young Justice. Mal is shown to be the boyfriend and later fianc√© of Bumblebee. He takes the identity of Guardian (after Jim Harper) in order to protect the Hall of Justice from an attack. =Jake Jordan= In 2005, Grant Morrison's Seven Soldiers megaseries introduced a new character based on the original Guardian, Jake Jordan the Manhattan Guardian. Powers and abilities The Guardian possesses exceptional combat and tactical skills. He was trained in many forms of fighting, and excelled at gymnastics, thinking quickly on his feet, and deduction. His only weapons are his golden helmet and shield. Guardian often used a customized motorcycle equipped with autopilot and a set of video cameras filming from various angles and recorded on videodisc. The Harper clone possesses enhanced strength and reflexes, and an accelerated healing factor. The Harper clone's exact strength level is unknown but has demonstrated the ability to hurt Superboy (who he trained in hand-to-hand combat) and Kryptonians from Kandor. As an agent of Cadmus, Jim Harper also has access to the wondrous Whiz Wagon. The Hairies (a super-advanced tribe of techno-wizards, originally genetic creations of Donovan, who left Cadmus) built the Whiz Wagon to handle every situation. It can adapt to every terrain, fly, and even go underwater. The Wagon can be remote controlled or pre- programmed and is equipped with a set of powerful weapons and various gadgets. Other versions * In the Frank Miller graphic novel Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again, the Guardian is one of the superheroes killed by Dick Grayson. It is implied that he had a daughter with Lois Lane named Lana Harper-Lane, a television reporter. * The Guardian's golden shield survives to the alternative future of the 853rd century; it is kept by that timeline's Batman.Superman/Batman #79 * A bearded version of Guardian exists on the post- Flashpoint Earth-23 as a member of a predominantly African American Justice League. In other media =Television= James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks) as Guardian in The CW's Supergirl * A teenaged version of Guardian appears as a supervillain under the name of Private H.I.V.E. in the Teen Titans animated series voiced by Greg Cipes. As his name implies, he is a student of the H.I.V.E. Academy (as opposed to Cadmus) and is a member of the show's version of the Fearsome Five. Private H.I.V.E. possesses an identical costume and shield to Guardian's albeit with a H.I.V.E. crest located on his chest, belt and the center of the shield. Like Guardian, Private H.I.V.E is extremely disciplined and militaristic, often ending sentences with the word \\"Sir\\". Young Justice episode \\"Independence Day\\" Pt. 1. * Guardian appears in Young Justice voiced by Crispin Freeman. In the two-part episode \\"Independence Day\\", he is shown as a member of Project Cadmus but Aqualad mentions that he is a known superhero as well. Guardian ends up fighting Robin, Aqualad, and Kid Flash in the sub-levels of the Cadmus Building when he is mind-controlled into doing it by one of Dubbilexs' Gene-gnomes on Mark Desmond's orders. He was with Desmond and Dubbilex when they corner Robin, Aqualad, and Kid Flash in the room where Superboy was being held. When Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash and Superboy end up near the main floor of the Cadmus building, Dubbilex has the Gene-gnome remove its control on Guardian, who then vows to deal with Desmond only for Mark to arrive and drink a formula that turns him into Blockbuster and knock Guardian down. After Blockbuster is defeated by Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash and Superboy and is then taken away by some of the Justice League members, Guardian takes over the Cadmus Building planning to make it into a gentler version of Cadmus along with Dubbilex and Doctor Amanda Spence. In the episode \\"Agendas\\", he is questioned as to his resemblance to Red Arrow (Roy Harper) to which Guardian states that he was Red Arrow's uncle. After it is revealed that Red Arrow is a clone of Roy Harper, and that the original Roy had been captured years ago as seen in \\"Auld Acquaintances\\", Guardian is mentioned by Batman to be tracking down the original. Unfortunately for the Justice League, the Light compromised Guardian and the other Project Cadmus members to steal their store of clones, including the original Roy Harper‚Äîcryogenically frozen and minus one arm. Between seasons one and two, Red Arrow learns that Jim is also a clone of Roy Harper. In the episode \\"Salvage\\", Guardian accompanies Green Arrow, Black Canary, Nightwing, and Kid Flash into holding an intervention for Red Arrow (who is still looking for the original Speedy). Jim (clone) tells Roy (clone) that Cadmus policy was to destroy source material and that he has to honor the original Roy. Roy's clone refuses and continues to look for Speedy (original Roy Harper). Guardian even admits that he is not sure who his identity of Jim Harper was. In the episode \\"Cornered\\", Mal Duncan officially takes over as the new Guardian after finding Jim Harper's costume and shield in the Hall of Justice during an attack. In Young Justice: Outsiders, Nightwing calls on Jim, the original Roy, and Red Arrow who now goes by Will for help in freeing meta-humans. Each Harper is shown to have a unique personality but fight well together, they even seem to regard each other as family. * James Harper appears in the Supergirl episode \\"Manhunter\\", portrayed by Eddie McClintock. In this episode, Harper is a colonel in the United States Marine Corps, and arrives with Lucy Lane to investigate the disappearance of Hank Henshaw and his subsequent replacement by the Martian Manhunter. Harper tries to take both the Martian Manhunter and Alex Danvers (DEO agent and foster sister of Supergirl) to be experimented on at Project Cadmus only to be thwarted by Supergirl and Lucy Lane. At the end of the episode, Martian Manhunter erases Harper's memories of the event and learns that Alex's father is also at Project Cadmus. ** It was announced by executive producer Andrew Kreisberg that James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks) would become Guardian in Season 2. In the Supergirl episode \\"Changing\\", after Olsen helps battle Parasite while wearing a specially designed suit and wielding the shield created for him so he could be a hero, reveals Guardian as his chosen code name. A vigilante later uses Guardian as a scapegoat to kill murderers let go on technicalities; however, James manages to get the impostor arrested. ** A second, alternate version of James Olsen's Guardian appears in \\"Crisis on Earth-X, Part 1\\";https://www.cbr.com/arrowverse-crisis-on-earth-james-olsen- guardian-dead/ the Guardian of Earth-X is a member of the Freedom Fighters and wears a costume patterned after the American flag. He is tasked with protecting a temporal gateway from the New Reichsmen, but is killed by the Earth-X Nazi F√ºhrer Oliver Queen. =Film= In Man of Steel, Colonel Nathan Hardy (portrayed by Christopher Meloni) of the USAF uses the codename \\"Guardian\\". He assists Kal-El battle Kryptonian villains Faora-Ul in Smallville earning both sides mutual respect. During the Black Zero's attack on Metropolis, along with Lois Lane and Emil Hamilton, they reverse engineer Kal's rocket into a Phantom-Drive, sending General Zod's forces back into the Phantom Zone. Upon collision, the blast sucks Black Zero, Faora, Hardy and Hamilton into the Zone and sends Lois out of the Helicopter. =Web series= Guardian (Mal Duncan) appears in DC Super Hero Girls. He is seen as one of the background students of Super Hero High.

The Fortran 2008 standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010) now includes coarrays (spelled without hyphen), as decided at the May 2005 meeting of the ISO Fortran Committee; the syntax in the Fortran 2008 standard is slightly different from the original CAF proposal. A CAF program is interpreted as if it were replicated a number of times and all copies were executed asynchronously. Each copy has its own set of data objects and is termed an image. The array syntax of Fortran is extended with additional trailing subscripts in square brackets to provide a concise representation of references to data that is spread across images. The CAF extension was implemented in some Fortran compilers such as those from Cray (since release 3.1). Since the inclusion of coarrays in the Fortran 2008 standard, the number of implementations is growing. The first open-source compiler which implemented coarrays as specified in the Fortran 2008 standard for Linux architectures is G95. Currently, GNU Fortran provides wide coverage of Fortran's coarray features in single- and multi-image configuration (the latter based on the OpenCoarrays library). Another implementation of coarrays and related parallel extensions from Fortran 2008 is available in the OpenUH compiler (a branch of Open64) developed at the University of Houston. Implementation in compilers CAF is often implemented on top of a Message Passing Interface (MPI) library for portability. Some implementations, such as the ones available in the GNU Fortran and OpenUH compilers, may run on top of other low-level layers (for example, GASNet) designed for supporting partitioned global address space languages. Examples A simple example is given below. CAF is used in CGPACK, an open source package for simulating polycrystalline materials developed at the University of Bristol. A. Shterenlikht, Fortran coarray library for 3D cellular automata microstructure simulation , (2013) In Proc. 7th PGAS conf, Eds. M. Weiland, A. Jackson, N.

Note: \\"name\\" is the local variable while \\"name[]\\" accesses the ! variable in a specific image; \\"name[this_image()]\\" is the same as \\"name\\". !

I/O from all images, executing in any order, but each record written is intact. write(*,'(3a,i0)') 'Hello ',trim(name),' from image ', this_image() end program Hello_world The program above scales poorly because the loop that distributes information executes sequentially. Writing scalable programs often requires a sophisticated understanding of parallel algorithms, a detailed knowledge of the underlying network characteristics, and special tuning for application characteristics such as the size of data transfers. For most application developers, letting the compiler or runtime library decide the best algorithm proves more robust and high-performing. Fortran 2018 will offer collective communication subroutines that empower compiler and runtime library teams to encapsulate efficient parallel algorithms for collective communication and distributed computation in a set of collective subroutines. These subroutines and other new parallel programming features are summarized in a technical specification TS 18508 Additional Parallel Features in Fortran that the Fortran standards committee has voted to incorporate into Fortran 2018. These enable the user to write a more efficient version of the above algorithm program Hello_World implicit none character(len=20) :: name[*] ! scalar coarray, one \\"name\\" for each image. ! Note: \\"name\\" is the local variable while \\"name[]\\" accesses the ! variable in a specific image; \\"name[this_image()]\\" is the same as \\"name\\". !

Distribute information to all images call co_broadcast(name,source_image=1) ! I/O from all images, executing in any order, but each record written is intact. write(*,'(3a,i0)') 'Hello ',trim(name),' from image ', this_image() end program Hello_world where the lack of explicit synchronization offers the potential for higher performance due to less coordination between the images. Furthermore, TS 18508 guarantees that \\"A transfer from an image cannot occur before the collective subroutine has been invoked on that image.\\" This implies some partial synchronization inside co_broadcast, but could be higher performing than the \\"sync all\\" in the prior example. TS 18508 also incorporates several other new features that address issues targeted by the CAF 2.0 effort described below. Examples include teams of images and events. An alternate perspective In 2011, Rice University pursued an alternate vision of coarray extensions for the Fortran language. Their perspective is that the Fortran 2008 standard committee's design choices were shaped more by the desire to introduce as few modifications to the language as possible than to assemble the best set of extensions to support parallel programming. In their view, both Numrich and Reid's original design and the coarray extensions proposed for Fortran 2008 suffer from the following shortcomings: * There is no support for processor subsets; for instance, coarrays must be allocated over all images. * The coarray extensions lack any notion of global pointers, which are essential for creating and manipulating any kind of linked data structure. * Reliance on named critical sections for mutual exclusion hinders scalable parallelism by associating mutual exclusion with code regions rather than data objects. * Fortran 2008's sync images statement does not provide a safe synchronization space. As a result, synchronization operations in user's code that are pending when a library call is made can interfere with synchronization in the library call. * There are no mechanisms to avoid or tolerate latency when manipulating data on remote images. * There is no support for collective communication. To address these shortcomings, the Rice University group is developing a clean-slate redesign of the Coarray Fortran programming model. Rice's new design for Coarray Fortran, which they call Coarray Fortran 2.0, is an expressive set of coarray-based extensions to Fortran designed to provide a productive parallel programming model. Compared to Fortran 2008, Rice's new coarray-based language extensions include some additional features: * process subsets known as teams, which support coarrays, collective communication, and relative indexing of process images for pair- wise operations, * topologies, which augment teams with a logical communication structure, * dynamic allocation/deallocation of coarrays and other shared data, * team-based coarray allocation and deallocation, * global pointers in support of dynamic data structures, * support for latency hiding and avoidance, and ** asynchronous copies, ** asynchronous collective operations, and ** function shipping. * enhanced support for synchronization for fine-grain control over program execution. ** safe and scalable support for mutual exclusion, including locks and lock sets, ** events, which provide a safe space for point-to-point synchronization, ** cofence, which forces local completion of asynchronous operations, ** finish, a barrier-like SPMD construct that forces completion of asynchronous operations across a team, See also * Array programming * Chapel * Fortress * Parallel computing * Partitioned global address space * Unified Parallel C * X10 References =General= * Co-Array Fortran homepage (Not working anymore) * ISO Fortran Committee * ANSI/INCITS Fortran Committee * Instructional videos on CAF in the Fortran Standard by John Reid (see Appendix B) * Coarray in GNU Fortran * CoarrayLib in GNU Fortran * OpenCoarrays library * NAG Fortran Compiler Category:Fortran programming language family ","title":"Coarray Fortran"},{"id":"899199","text":"The 2004 MTV Movie Awards were held June 5, 2004, and were hosted by Lindsay Lohan and featured performances by Beastie Boys, D12 and Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

He gained fame as one of the most successful bowlers in Twenty20 cricket finishing as the leading wicket taker and bowler in both the 2007 and 2009 Twenty20 World Championship tournaments. Umar Gul was the second-highest wicket-taker in Twenty20 International cricket, with 74 dismissals, behind Saeed Ajmal. He won the Twenty20 International Performance of the Year 2013. On 16 October 2020, after the final group-stage match of the 2020‚Äì21 National T20 Cup, Gul retired from all forms of cricket following a career that spanned twenty years.  Personal life  Gul was born on 14 April 1984 in Peshawar, Pakistan in a middle-class family and frequently played tape-ball cricket. He was encouraged by his friends to become an international cricketer as they saw his excellent bowling. In October 2010, Gul was married to a Dubai based doctor. Umar Gul's daughter, Rehab Umar, was born in May 2012. In the same month, Pakistan Army Commandos mistakenly raided Umar Gul's house in Peshawar and arrested his brother Meeraj Gul on the charge of hiding a wanted militant. However, the commandos later on apologized to Meeraj.

Gul had signed a one-year contract with Gloucestershire to play in 2007, but the Pakistan Cricket Board failed to give them their permission. In April 2018, he was named in Baluchistan's squad for the 2018 Pakistan Cup. In March 2019, he was named as the captain of Sindh's squad for the 2019 Pakistan Cup. In September 2019, he was named in Balochistan's squad for the 2019‚Äì20 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy tournament. International career =Early years= Gul was first called up for the team in April 2003, playing four one-day matches at the Cherry Blossom Sharjah Cup against Zimbabwe, Kenya and Sri Lanka, where he took four wickets, and he was in and out of the one-day team after that tournament. However, he played the whole of the 2003 home series against Bangladesh, making his Test debut and taking 15 wickets in the three Tests, and took the second-most wickets of any Pakistani bowler in the series, behind Shabbir Ahmed with 17. However, Shoaib Akhtar, who took 13 in third place, only played two of the Tests. Gul was retained for the ODIs against Bangladesh, taking a List A best five for 17 in nine overs in the third match, and ended with 11 wickets in the 5‚Äì0 series win. However, he could still not command a regular spot, playing three of Pakistan's nine next ODIs before finally getting dropped after one for 36 against New Zealand. =Test cricket= He was recalled and played two Tests after that taking four wickets in a drawn Test against New Zealand before coming in as replacement for Shabbir Ahmed in the second Test of the three-Test series against India. After coming on as first-change bowler, Gul dismissed Virender Sehwag in his second over, and then bowled unchanged for 12 overs either side of lunch to take five Indian top order wickets ‚Äì including Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar, who both had Test batting averages above 50, as did Sehwag. Gul finished with five for 31 in his spell, earning him commendation from Cricinfo journalist Dileep Premachandran, who praised his \\"control of line and length\\", and he was also named Man of the Match despite conceding runs at five an over in the second innings in a nine-wicket win. After a length injury lay-off, which kept him out of international cricket for nearly two years, Gul returned to the Pakistan fold in 2006. Firstly with quiet away series against Sri Lanka then followed by a tour to England in 2006. Gul was quickly made the lead bowler in the side due to the injuries to other front line bowlers. Gul to 18 wickets in four tests, justifying the selectors faith in him. Later in 2006, against West Indies at home, Gul had perhaps his most successful test series. He took 16 wickets in 3 tests, including notable spells of reverse swing bowling. He was responsible for breaking Ramnaresh Sarwan's toe with a dipping yorker. In February 2009, Gul recorded his best test figures in the Pakistan team, taking 6 for 135 on a flat pitch. In July 2010, Pakistan faced England at Trent Bridge and were 147/9 in their first innings. Gul scored 30* before the day was called off due to bad light. He returned the next day with Mohammad Asif and batted with intent to add another 35 runs in five overs. This saw Pakistan avoid the follow-on against England and therefore survive an innings defeat. Gul then suffered a hamstring injury in the second test when he was touring England in 2010 he was ruled out for three weeks that meant he would miss the remaining two tests. However Gul managed to recover and became fit enough to play in the fourth test However they decided to rest Gul for the final test match despite the fact that he had recovered quicker than expected. His next chance to play test cricket came against South Africa in November 2010 when he took 3 wickets in a first innings and triggered a South African collapse of 380 on a flat wicket. He took the crucial wicket with an excellent inswinger against AB de Villiers. = Twenty20 Internationals= With injuries limiting Gul's test cricket participation, he made a distinct change to his bowling set-up, making a focus on bowling in the late overs of T20. He got his opportunity with the absence of Shoaib Akhtar and Abdul Razzaq in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 held in South Africa. He bowled from the 13th over onwards and finished the tournament with 13 wickets, becoming the leading wicket taker ahead of Shahid Afridi and RP Singh. He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo for the 2007 T20I World Cup.http://www.espncricinfo.com/twenty20wc/content/story/312486.html For his performances in 2007, he was named in the World T20I XI by Cricinfo.http://www.espncricinfo.com/review2007/content/story/328571.html In the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, he performed well, earning the mantle from at least one pundit of \\"the outstanding seam bowler of the World Twenty20\\".Booth, Lawrence. \\"Myths; And stereotypes.\\" The Spin, 30 June 2009. His five-wicket haul for just six runs, when Pakistan defeated New Zealand, won especial acclaim. The spell made him the first bowler in history to take a five wickets in a Twenty20 international, and he held the record of best T20 bowling figure until 8 August 2011, when surpassed by Ajantha Mendis (6/16). Mutterings were made about a possible correlation between ball tampering and the exorbitant amounts of reverse-swing he was able to extract, but he denied them categorically: \\"whenever an Asian bowler performs and uses the reverse-swing, the Western cricketing countries raise the issue of ball-tampering against them.\\"Quoted in Booth 2009. The spell was voted as the best T20I bowling performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo.http://www.espncricinfo.com/awards2009/content/story/448899.html He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament' by Cricinfo for the 2009 T20I World Cup.http://www.espncricinfo.com/wt202009/content/story/410204.html His spell was of 4 for 8 against Australia at Dubai was also nominated to be one of the Best T20I Bowling Performance of the year by ESPNCricinfo.http://www.espncricinfo.com/awards2009/content/story/448517.html He was also part of the Pakistan team that lifted the trophy at Lord's while also finishing as the leading wicket taker of the tournament for the second consecutive time.ICC World Twenty20, 2009; Cricinfo.com; 22 June 2009 He gained a lot of wickets bowled, in particular with late reverse swinging yorkers, which dip late to slide under the bat and leave little room for batsmen to maneuver the ball. Consequently, he has also an excellent economy rate in this format of the game. Internationally, Gul has taken 47 wickets in 32 games at an average of 14.65. He is the second leading wicket-taker in Twenty20 Internationals behind teammate Shahid Afridi. = One Day Internationals = Gul appeared in all three of Pakistan's group matches in the 2007 World Cup taking four wickets with an economy rate of 3.13, only Shane Bond of those to deliver 100 balls was more economical.

He returned to play two games at the 2004‚Äì05 Faysal Bank T20 Cup, and played some matches for Pakistan A and a Pakistan XI in warm-up games before the Test matches against England the following season, but he was not selected for the matches and has instead played three matches with Peshawar at the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy. Shortly after making a six-month come-back from a shoulder injury in July 2010 Gul picked up a hamstring injury against England in August but it wasn't too serious and he only missed the two Test matches.  Batting-skills  Despite being a bowler, Gul can perform well as a lower order batsman and has proved his ability as a quick.run-picker His finest moment with the bat came in a test match against England in August 2010 when Pakistan were at 103/7 and Gul came into bat at 8. He scored 29 off 30 deliveries, and when play ended that day, two more wickets had fallen and the team were at 148/9.

He has played international cricket for the Zimbabwe cricket team in all three formats of the game. He also played for Midlands in the Logan Cup. Early career Sibanda is a right-handed opening batsman and showed potential as a teenager, graduating from the Zimbabwe Cricket Academy and being fast-tracked into the national team. He grew up in Highfields, Harare and was spotted early on by developmental coaches, and earned a scholarship to Churchill Boys High. He currently plays domestic cricket for Mid West Rhinos International career He made his ODI debut in 2003 against the West Indies and made 58. Sibanda however struggled at international level from there on in, not scoring another half century for 18 innings, making at one stage 3 consecutive ducks. In May 2005 his place in the national team came under threat by the imminent return of the 'rebel' Zimbabwean cricketers who walked out on the team in a dispute with Zimbabwe Cricket. The return was unsuccessful and Sibanda again became a regular at the top of the order for Zimbabwe, making his maiden ODI hundred in 2006 against Bermuda in the Caribbean Tri Nations Tournament. He made a return to international cricket (although he denied ever retiring ) for the Africa XI in the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup. He played in two of the three ODIs, scoring 80 runs at an average of 40.00. Although Sibanda wasn't playing initially in the 2011 Cricket World Cup and injury to Sean Williams meant a call-up for him. He scored 61 off 57 balls in an innings that included 7 fours.

He was born in 1975 in Salisbury - now Harare. Gripper was a somewhat solid opening batsman, who once spent four hours 23 minutes inching his way to 28 in a match against England A. However, his off-spin bowling has also proved useful, and in first-class cricket he may fairly be considered an all-rounder, with his batting average above 33 and his bowling average below 32. Gripper made his first-class debut for a Matabeleland Invitation XI during Worcestershire's 1996/97 tour of Zimbabwe, by scoring 45. However, he did not play another match at that level until the aforementioned game against England A in February 1999. Gripper made his Test match debut in October 1999 against Australia at Harare; the selectors' decision was somewhat surprising since at the time Gripper had still not recorded a first-class century. He made 60 in the second innings. His maiden Test hundred came against Bangladesh in 2001, as Zimbabwe piled up 542/7 declared. Although only taking six wickets in his test career, he will be forever remembered as the bowler who dismissed Matthew Hayden for 380 runs (Second highest runs scored in a Test Match) in the 1st Test between Australia v Zimbabwe at Perth in October 2003. He has played domestic cricket for Matabeleland, Manicaland and Mashonaland, and it was for the latter that he made his highest first-class score - 234 against Manicaland, which performance brought him a recall to the Zimbabwe team for the 2003/04 tour of Australia. He also played two seasons for Cranleigh Cricket Club in Surrey (1999 and 2004) totalling over 1,400 1st XI runs and 68 wickets. He currently lives and works in Harare and has a family of two children.

He is serving as the Head Coach of Tanzania national cricket team. Widely regarded as the greatest Kenyan cricketer ever, Tikolo has scored the most runs and taken the second most wickets for the team in One Day Internationals. Family Tikolo came from a cricketing family with his oldest brother Tom being a former captain of Kenya while his other brother David Tikolo played in the 1996 Cricket World Cup.He was the best among all cricketers from his country  Domestic career  Tikolo is a right-handed middle order batsman and part-time right-arm medium pace and off-spin bowler. Tikolo has previously represented Border in South African domestic cricket and has also spent time playing in England and Bangladesh. Most recently he has been playing club cricket in England and in Kenya he plays for Swamibapa Cricket Club in Nairobi. In 2005 Tikolo was signed by Haverigg to play cricket in England. In 2008 Tikolo was selected as captain of The Eastern Aces in Kenya's Domestic Tournament, the Sahara Elite League International career In 1996 Cricket World Cup, Tikolo made his ODI debut for Kenya. Coming in at 3 for his maiden innings Tikolo made 65 against India. Tikolo went on to play a couple more impressive innings in the Cup, top scoring for his side with 29 in their historic victory over West Indies at Pune and 96 against Sri Lanka at Kandy. Tikolo further enhanced his reputation as Kenya's premier batsman with 147 against Bangladesh in the 1997 ICC Trophy final. The innings gave them official ODI status and booked Kenya's place in England for the 1999 Cricket World Cup. It was another successful World Cup for Tikolo as he made a pair of 50's against India and England. In 2002 Tikolo was named as the new Kenyan captain and led from the front in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with innings of 93 and 69. Tikolo led the Kenyan national side during their run to the semi finals of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. This was a huge feat for a country that has not even been granted Test status, which is still rated as the best performance by Kenya in international arena. After a poor 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, he quit as captain and instead led a players' strike in protest of internal politics. The strike forced a new regime and he returned as captain. In 2007 he became the first player from a non Test playing country to appear in 100 ODI games and also 2,500 ODI runs. His last appearance as captain, was the 2009 ICC World Cup Qualifier, where Kenya secured place for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. In August 2010, months after walking out on the team and indicating he would not play international cricket again, Tikolo announced his availability for the 2011 World Cup. He announced his retirement after the World Cup but returned at age of 42 when he was recalled for 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in UAE. Tikolo has also represented an Africa XI against an Asia XI. Tikolo's dominance of Kenyan cricket, is well highlighted that as of January 2007 he possessed six of the nine highest scores by a Kenyan batsman in ODI cricket. Tikolo has made three ODI centuries; 106* against Bangladesh, 111 against Bermuda and 102 against Zimbabwe. He has been dismissed in the 90s on three occasions.  Coaching career  In July 2012 it was announced that Tikolo had been appointed the batting coach of the Ugandan national team but in May 2013, he was coach of Kenya national under-19 cricket team and his first assignment was at the ICC under-19 World Cup Africa qualifiers. During that tenure, Uganda won the T20 African Premier League and qualified for the World Cricket League Division II. He was named interim coach of Kenya national cricket team when he replaced Robin Brown as head coach after Kenya's failure to qualify for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20. In May 2016, Tikolo was appointed as head coach of the Uganda national cricket team ahead of World Cricket League Division Three and is scheduled to take place in 2017. He is serving as the Head Coach of the team.

Bren's net worth is $17 billion, making him number 32 on the 2020 Forbes 400 list. Early life and education Bren is the son of Marion (Newbert) and Milton Bren.Ronnie and Nancy: Their Path to the White House-- 1911 to 1980 By Bob Colacello retrieved January 14, 2012 His father Milton was a naval officer, talent agent, and successful movie producer while his mother Marion was a prominent civic leader. His mother was of partial Irish descent while his father was of Jewish descent. His parents divorced in 1948. Bren's father remarried in 1948 to Academy Award-winning actress Claire Trevor. His mother remarried in 1953 to steel business man Earle M. Jorgensen. Bren graduated from the University of Washington where he received a bachelor's degree in business administration and economics. He tried out for the 1956 Olympic ski team but did not qualify following an injury. After college, he served as an officer in the United States Marine Corps. Business career Bren built his first house in Newport Beach with a $10,000 loan in 1958. He began his business career in 1958 when he founded the Bren Company, which built homes in Orange County, California. In 1963, he and two others started the Mission Viejo Company (MVC) and purchased 10,000 acres to plan and develop the city of Mission Viejo, California. Bren was President of MVC from 1963 to 1967. International Paper bought the Bren Co. for $34 million in 1970, then sold it back to Bren for $22 million in 1972 following the recession. Bren took the proceeds and in 1977 joined a group of investors to purchase the 146-year-old Irvine Company. Bren was the largest shareholder of the resulting consortium, owning 34.3% of the company and received the title of Vice-chair of the board. By 1983, he was the majority owner of the firm and was elected chairman of the board. By 1996, he had bought out all outstanding shares to become the sole owner. By 2005, OC Weekly wrote that Bren \\"wields more power than Howard Hughes ever did, probably as much as any man in America over a concentrated region‚Äîdetermining not only how people live and shop but who governs them.\\" In 2006 the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"[s]imply put, Orange County looks like Orange County...because of the influence of [Donald Bren].\\" In an interview in 2011, Bren summarized his real estate investment strategy: \\"What I learned was that when you hold property over the long term, you're able to create better values and you have something tangible to show for it.\\" Forbes, in its 2019 edition of \\"The 400 Richest Americans\\", ranked Bren as the wealthiest real estate developer in the US and 32nd \\"Richest American\\" with an estimated net worth of $17 billion. It is believed that the Irvine Company owns more than 120,000,000 ft.¬≤ of real estate ‚Äì the majority of which is located in Southern California. The company's holdings include several hotels, marinas, golf courses, 550 office buildings, 125 apartment complexes and more than 40 shopping centers. He currently owns a 97% stake in the Met Life building in Manhattan. Philanthropy In 2008, BusinessWeek named Bren one of the top ten philanthropists in the nation, with his contributions to various causes such as education, conservation and research among other areas exceeding $1 billion. In 2010, Bren was honored with the National Philanthropy Day of Orange County \\"Donald Bren Legacy of Giving Award.\\" At the time Bren spoke about his work in philanthropy, saying that \\"I do try to bring the same level of attention to both my philanthropic and business ventures.\\" =Education= Bren has donated more than $200 million to support programs in K-12 public schools and higher education institutions in Southern California. Many of Bren's contributions have benefited universities in California, including the University of California, Irvine, University of California, Santa Barbara, and Chapman University. At the University of California, Bren \\"has contributed more to support endowed chairs than any other single donor in UC's history.\\" Privately and through the Donald Bren Charitable Trust, he has directed contributions to support its faculty and programs. At UC Irvine, the Bren Events Center, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and the recently built Donald Bren Hall are named after him, honoring his patronage of the school. The University also named its Claire Trevor School of the Arts after his stepmother. Additionally, UC Santa Barbara named Bren Hall and the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management, a graduate school, after him as well. Bren made a donation to the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management to \\"enhance and strengthen the school's core interdisciplinary programs, personnel, and special activities.\\" When commenting about the continued support from Bren, UC Santa Barbara Chancellor Henry T. Yang said, \\"Bren's vision for developing a peerless, world-leading institution offering an interdisciplinary program of environmental science, management, and policy has been a tremendous source of inspiration and leadership for the Bren School.\\" In August 2007, Bren pledged $20 million to the recently established UC Irvine School of Law. The purpose of the gift was to establish an endowment to help recruit and support a nationally recognized dean and 11 distinguished law scholars, and also to provide the dean with discretionary start-up funding. In recognition of the gift, the school was initially named the UC Irvine Donald Bren School of Law. In 2008 an agreement was reached between Bren and the University that the school would not bear his name. Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school, said, \\"We are deeply grateful for the Bren gift, but it was decided between the chancellor and Mr. Bren that our name should be parallel to other UC schools.\\" Bren, a trustee at the California Institute of Technology, supported new faculty as Bren Scholars and endowed five Bren Professorships.

The funds were used to endow two academic chairs focusing on ethics & leadership and innovation & transformation. In addition to higher education, Bren has also contributed significantly to K-12 public schools in California. He has supported THINK Together, a provider of after-school services for K-12 students in Southern California. Bren first donated to this organization in 2001 with a contribution that helped the after-school program expand its services to 40 schools in the Santa Ana district. According to officials, the contribution would benefit more than 10,000 students over 10 years. In 2006, Bren also made a contribution to the Irvine Unified School District in Irvine, California, in the amount of $20 million. This donation would be used by the district to hire art, music and science teachers. The funding would benefit students in grades fourth through sixth over a 10-year period, giving them access to music, arts and science programs. This contribution is in addition to the $25 million that Bren provided to Irvine schools in 2000. According to Tim Shaw, former chief executive officer of the Irvine Public Schools Foundation, the annual gift \\"seeded the strong public support of elementary arts, music and science instruction.\\" =Conservation= In March 2009, he was ranked 9th in The (London) Sunday Times' \\"Green Rich List\\"- a list of the 100 wealthiest people, who have either invested in green technology/businesses or made large contributions to environmental causes. Bren's placement on the list was due to his $20 million in donations to UC Santa Barbara's School of Environmental Science. Throughout a 30-year time span, Bren donated of land to be used for parks, greenways, recreation and wilderness preserves. The donated land fulfills Bren's plans and commitment to preserve more than 50-percent of historic Irvine Ranch of . Of this, were designated as the Irvine Ranch National Natural Landmark. During the 2006 ceremony at Crystal Cove State Park to celebrate this designation, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said \\"it is really a spectacular gift that [Bren's] given to [California]. Donald Bren is...the ultimate of generosity. Not only what he contributes to the environment, but what he contributes continuously to the community, if it is in education, if it is in arts, if it is music, if it is the environment, the 10s of millions of dollars he's invested in the environment, to protect the environment. He's an extraordinary man.\\" In 2008, the state of California also designated the land as the first California Natural Landmark because of the land's ecological value. The protected land, once a part of Irvine Ranch, is operated by The Irvine Ranch Conservancy. Recently, Bren completed his pledge to set aside more than 50,000 acres of the original 93,000-acre ranch as open space by designating 20,000 acres (81 km2) to Orange County, California, as an open-space and parklands gift in June 2010. The gift was accepted in a unanimous decision by the Orange County Board of Supervisors and was the largest donation of private property to public ownership in Orange County history. In a ceremony in the same year, he was recognized for donating more than 20,000 acres of pristine wilderness that he gave to Orange County, asking only that it remain open space forever. In August 2014, the Irvine Company announced plans to donate and preserve 2,500 additional acres of land previously approved for housing, bringing the preserved lands of the Irvine Ranch to 60%. Gale Norton, former U.S. Secretary of the Interior, speaking about Bren's history of land donations, said, \\"The Irvine Ranch illustrates what cooperative conservation is all about. A conservation-minded corporate citizen is working hand-in-hand with federal and state agencies, The Nature Conservancy, local communities, private citizens and other partners to thoughtfully and purposefully create an environment where both people and wildlife can thrive.\\" =Research= In 2007, Bren made a $2.5 million commitment to the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla, California. The contribution established The Donald Bren Presidential Chair and the money donated was used to support research conducted by the Institute such as cancer, neurodegeneration, diabetes, and childhood diseases among others. From a 2011 interview, solar energy is one of the areas he is exploring for a future philanthropic gift. Bren said, \\"It's my view that solar energy may be the ultimate solution for energy for most of the world. I believe, based on what little I know about it, that there is a possibility of a breakthrough.\\" Awards and honors In 2006 the Los Angeles Times named Bren as both the most powerful and wealthiest person in Southern California, and the Orange County Business Journal named him \\"Businessperson of the Year\\" based on the company's office expansion, new building construction, and Bren being recognized for his conservation efforts by the federal government. In 2011 the Urban Land Institute awarded Bren its first Vanguard Award, calling him \\"one of the most consequential developers in American history.\\" In 2014 he was named on OC Register's list of the 100 most influential people in Orange County. In 2004 Bren received the University of California Presidential Medal, the University's highest honor, because of his financial support throughout the years which at the time was more than $43 million. During the award ceremony, former UC President, Robert Dynes said, \\"[Bren's] passionate philanthropy and commitment to educational excellence have helped strengthen the university.\\" In 1998, Bren received the Marine Corps University Foundation's Semper Fidelis Award, which recognizes a distinguished American leader whose commitment to personal and professional excellence embodies those qualities of leadership and character uniquely associated with the United States Marine Corps. Past award recipients include former President George H.W. Bush and former Secretary of State George P. Schultz. The Foundation also presented Bren with its most prestigious award in 2003, the General Leonard F. Chapman Medallion named in honor of the 24th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. Bren serves on the board of trustees at Caltech and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He was elected a Fellow with the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2007 in the category of Business, Corporate and Philanthropic Leadership. Personal life Bren has been married three times: *His first marriage was to Diane Bren and they had three children:Orange County Weekly: \\"Steven Bren, Son of Billionaire Irvine Co.

Bren keeps a low public profile and as he explains, \\"I'm not a public official. I'm a businessman, I'm a builder, I'm a planner... And if I feel that I've done the job well, that's the satisfaction I get, not from doing interviews or being more public.\\" OC Weekly described Bren in 2005 as \\"one of the nation's least public billionaires\\", who guards his privacy \\"jealously\\". The Los Angeles Times that year canceled a pending article discussing how the fictional Caleb Nichol of the popular television show The O.C. was based on Bren, allegedly because the Irvine Company threatened to withdraw advertising. The Times denied the allegation and stated that the story was canceled for timing reasons. Politics Bren is a supporter of Republicans. He backed Pete Wilson's Senate and gubernatorial campaigns. He has also long supported Democrat Dianne Feinstein, whom he calls \\"a great senator for California.\\" References External links *Biography at the Irvine Company *Donald Bren, Chairman of the Board of the Irvine Company *Biography at UCI's Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences *Donald Bren: Southern California's richest man in his own words by Los Angeles Times Category:1933 births Category:Living people Category:American billionaires Category:American philanthropists Category:American real estate businesspeople Category:Businesspeople from California Category:Philanthropists from California Category:California Institute of Technology trustees Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:United States Marines Category:University of Washington Foster School of Business alumni Category:American people of Irish descent Category:American people of Jewish descent Category:American Episcopalians Category:Real estate and property developers Category:People from Newport Beach, California Category:California Republicans ","title":"Donald Bren"},{"id":"899228","text":"Williamsford is a village on the North Saugeen River in Grey County, Ontario, Canada (Chatsworth Township). It has a general store, Pie Company, post office, a bookstore and restaurant housed in a historic grain mill. A small dam controls the North Saugeen River. It has several churches, and a community cemetery. It is located on Highway 6 between Durham and Owen Sound. The village of Williamsford was first surveyed in 1858 comprising 400 acres in preparation for a railway which was to run from Toronto to Owen Sound. Each township was to contribute $40,000 to its construction. The post office was built in 1847 and the general store was built in the late 1800s.  Recreation  At the south end of the village sits the community centre grounds. The grounds contain a playground, a baseball diamond and a newly built curling rink. The curling rink which was completed in 2010 consists of a lounge and two rinks. The community was previously served by a hockey arena with the original attached curling rink. The arena was planned in 1954 and opened officially in 1956 and was torn down in 2008. Transportation Ontario Highway 6 passes through the Williamsford. The community is served by Kasper Transportation's Owen Sound to Guelph intercity bus route, which began operating in January 2020 with a fourteen-seat passenger van. There are two buses in each direction on Monday to Saturday, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.

In rare instances the sting may result in cardiac arrest and death. The most common jellyfish involved is the Carukia barnesi, a species of Irukandji jellyfish. Those stung may experience severe or even excruciating pain. The syndrome was given its name in 1952 by Hugo Flecker, after the Aboriginal Irukandji people who live in Palm Cove, north of Cairns, Queensland, Australia, where stings are common. Signs and symptoms Most stings occur during the summer wet season in October‚ÄìMay in North Queensland, with different seasonal patterns elsewhere. Because jellyfish are very small, the venom is only injected through the tips of the nematocysts (the cnidocysts) rather than the entire lengths; as a result the sting may barely be noticed at first. It has been described as feeling like little more than a mosquito bite. The symptoms, however, gradually become apparent and then more and more intense in the subsequent 5 to 120 minutes (30 minutes on average). Irukandji syndrome includes an array of systemic symptoms, including severe headache, backache, muscle pains, chest and abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, sweating, anxiety, hypertension, tachycardia and pulmonary edema. Symptoms generally improve in four to 30 hours, but may take up to two weeks to resolve completely. =Toxicity= When properly treated, a single sting is almost never fatal; however, two people in Australia are believed to have died from Irukandji stings, which has greatly increased public awareness of Irukandji syndrome. It is unknown how many other deaths from Irukandji syndrome have been wrongly attributed to other causes. Pathophysiology The exact mechanism of action of the venom is unknown, but catecholamine excess may be an underlying mechanism in severe cases. Animal studies appear to confirm a relationship between envenoming and an increase in circulating noradrenaline and adrenaline. Treatment Similar to other box jellyfish stings, first aid consists of flushing the area with vinegar to neutralize the tentacle stinging apparatus. As no antivenom is available, treatment is largely supportive, with analgesia being the mainstay of management. Nitroglycerin, a common drug used for cardiac conditions, is utilised by medical personnel to minimise the risk of pulmonary edema and to reduce hypertension. Antihistamines may be of benefit for pain relief, but most cases require intravenous opioid analgesia. Fentanyl or morphine are usually chosen. Pethidine (meperidine, brand name Demerol in the US) should be avoided, as large doses are often required for pain relief and in this situation significant adverse effects from the pethidine metabolite norpethidine may occur. Magnesium sulfate has been proposed as a treatment for Irukandji syndrome after being apparently successfully used in one case. Early evidence suggested a benefit; however, according to a later report, a series of three patients failed to show any improvement with magnesium; the author emphasized the experimental status of this treatment. Some preliminary laboratory experiments using the venom extracted from Malo maxima (the 'Broome Irukandji') on rat cardiovascular tissue in vitro has suggested that magnesium does in fact block many of the actions of this venom. Epidemiology Reports of Irukandji syndrome have come from Australia, the United States (Hawaii and Florida), the French Antilles, Bonaire, the Caribbean, Timor Leste and Papua New Guinea. Cubozoan species other than Carukia barnesi are presumed to be responsible for envenomations outside Australia. History In 1964 Jack Barnes confirmed the cause of the syndrome was a sting from a small box jellyfish: the Irukandji jellyfish, which can fire venom-filled stingers out of its body and into passing victims. To prove that the jellyfish was the cause of the syndrome, he captured one and deliberately stung himself while his son Nick and a local lifeguard then observed the resulting symptoms (before rushing him to the ICU). Other cubozoans possibly can cause Irukandji syndrome; those positively identified include Carukia barnesi, Alatina cf. mordens, Alatina alata, Malo maximus, Malo kingi, Carybdea xaymacana, Keesingia gigas, an as-yet unnamed \\"fire jelly\\", and another unnamed species. Media portrayals A 2005 Discovery Channel program, Killer Jellyfish, portrayed the severity of the pain from an Irukandji jellyfish sting when two Australian researchers (Jamie Seymour and Teresa Carrette) were stung. Another program aired on the Discovery Channel, Stings, Fangs and Spines, featured a 20-minute spot on Irukandji syndrome. In the segment, a young Australian woman was stung and developed a severe case. A 2007 fictional Sea Patrol episode (S1, E4) involves two crew members of HMAS Hammersley being stung by an Irukandji jellyfish. On the television program Super Animal, a woman compared her experience with Irukandji syndrome to the pain from childbirth. Steve Backshall reports with accounts from victims of Irukandji stings on his ITV wildlife series Fierce in 2016.

He now serves as the President of the Iranian Judo Federation. World Judo Championships He won the gold medal in two World Judo Championships, the first one in 2001 in Munich, Germany, and the second in 2003 in Osaka, Japan. He also won bronze medal in the 2005 World Judo Championships in Cairo, Egypt and 2007 World Judo Championships in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Athens Olympic Games; controversy Arash Miresmaili was the favourite for the gold medal in the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he was the flag bearer for Iran at the opening ceremonies. Slated to fight Israeli judoka competitor Ehud Vaks in the first round, Miresmaili was disqualified from competing because he was above the permissible weight limit for his class. He was more than two kilos - four pounds - over the 66-kilogram weight limit. It was claimed that Miresmaili deliberately set out to be disqualified, rather than compete against an Israeli, which was understood from Miresmaili's own comments: \\"Although I have trained for months and was in good shape I refused to fight my Israeli opponent to sympathise with the suffering of the people of Palestine and I do not feel upset at all.\\" Judo officials questioned how such an experienced two-time world champion competitor could have made such a basic error. There was precedent for Miresmaeili's actions, in the sport of judo. At the 2001 World Judo Championships, Iranian Mahed Malekmohammdi refused to face Israeli judoka Yoel Razvozov. Similarly, Iranian judoka Masoud Haji Akhoundzade pulled out of a bout against Israeli lightweight Zvi Shafran. An Iran National Olympic Committee spokesman said it was Iran's \\"general policy\\" to avoid competing against Israeli athletes, and that Miresmaeili had just followed Iran's protocol. Comments from Iranian officials and politicians supported this understanding. The Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted then Iranian President Mohammad Khatami as saying that Miresmaeili's actions would be \\"recorded in the history of Iranian glories,\\" and that the nation considered him to be \\"the champion of the 2004 Olympic Games.\\" Iranian Olympic team chairman Nassrollah Sajadi told the Shargh newspaper that the government should give the athlete $115,000 for his action, the amount the Iranian government awards gold medal winning athletes. Then-mayor of Tehran and former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that though Miresmaeili \\"did not get a gold medal, he earned eternal honor by his refusal\\". Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel, the speaker of Iran's parliament, congratulated Miresmaeili, calling his refusal to compete a \\"brave decision,\\" and saying that \\"Your disqualification because of supporting Palestine would promote your position in the heart of Muslims.\\" Vaks said \\"I don't think they (Iran) have the right not to acknowledge us. Israel is a democracy, and Iran isn't. But sport is linked to politics... Maybe the next Olympics will be better.\\" On August 18, 2004, the International Judo Federation (IJF), which had set up a commission to investigate whether Miresmaeili deliberately missed weight so he would not have to face Vaks, concluded he had no intention to avoid competing against an Israeli. After a hearing which included the president of Iran's judo federation, the commission concluded that Miresmaeili said he had no pre-planned intentions for not competing and that \\"he made no statement of any sort to any press,\\" according to an IJF statement. The only issue that remained was that Miresmaeili was overweight on the weigh-in day, the IJF said, and as it has no rule for penalizing overweight athletes, it decided not to take any action against him. On September 8, 2004, Iran's official press agency announced the government had given Miresmaili $125,000, the same amount awarded to Iran's two Athens gold medalists.  Denial of entry to election of Iran's Judo Federation  In the summer of 2009, prior to the controversial Iranian presidential elections, Miresmaeili chose to support the candidacy of Mohsen Rezaee, one of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's rivals. Rezaei appointed Miresmaeili as his campaign chief for Sports Committee. After being appointed, during a press conference, Miresmaeili stated that if Rezaee were elected as president, there would be no more place for Iranian sports officials who have been appointed for political purposes, as opposed to their knowledge and capabilities. His backing of Rezaee and his remarks did not sit well with the conservative backers of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the Iranian Sports Federation and elsewhere. They also drew immediate and harsh condemnation from the former Chief of Iran's Sports Federation, Mohammed Aliabadi. Since then, the effort to punish and sideline Miresmaeili went as far as denying him entry to an election event of Iran's Judo Federation held on Jan 2, 2009. Miresmaeili tried very hard to gain entry into the event, and was denied entry by the security guards. This angered Miresmaeili to the point where he called a press conference that day, during which he stated that he was very sorry for sports in Iran and that he was officially done with the Iranian Judo, but that they could not kill his love for Judo. As the President of the Iranian Judo Federation In 2019, Miresmaili was elected as the President of the Iranian Judo Federation for a four-year term by receiving 32 votes out of 43 votes.https://www.judoinside.com/news/3252/Arash_Miresmaeili_elected_as_President_of_Iranian_Judo_Federation See also *Boycotts of Israel in individual sports References External links * Mystery over Iran judo Web Site * Mystery over Iran judo 'protest' on BBC NEWS.

This allows eliminating named variables. The language was introduced in Backus's 1977 Turing Award paper, \\"Can Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style?\\", subtitled \\"a functional style and its algebra of programs.\\" The paper sparked interest in functional programming research, eventually leading to modern functional languages, and not the function-level paradigm Backus had hoped. In his Turing award paper, Backus described how the FP style is different from languages based on the lamba calculus: FP itself never found much use outside of academia. In the 1980s Backus created a successor language, FL, which remained a research project.  Overview  The values that FP programs map into one another comprise a set which is closed under sequence formation: if x1,...,xn are values, then the sequence „Äàx1,...,xn„Äâ is also a value These values can be built from any set of atoms: booleans, integers, reals, characters, etc.: boolean : {T, F} integer : {0,1,2,...,‚àû} character : {'a','b','c',...} symbol : {x,y,...} ‚ä• is the undefined value, or bottom. Sequences are bottom-preserving: „Äàx1,...,‚ä•,...,xn„Äâ = ‚ä• FP programs are functions f that each map a single value x into another: f:x represents the value that results from applying the function f to the value x Functions are either primitive (i.e., provided with the FP environment) or are built from the primitives by program-forming operations (also called functionals). An example of primitive function is constant, which transforms a value x into the constant-valued function xÃÑ. Functions are strict: f:‚ä• = ‚ä• Another example of a primitive function is the selector function family, denoted by 1,2,... where: i:„Äàx1,...,xn„Äâ = xi if 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n = ‚ä• otherwise Functionals In contrast to primitive functions, functionals operate on other functions. For example, some functions have a unit value, such as 0 for addition and 1 for multiplication. The functional unit produces such a value when applied to a function f that has one: unit + = 0 unit √ó = 1 unit foo = ‚ä• These are the core functionals of FP: composition f‚àòg where f‚àòg:x = f:(g:x) construction [f1,...,fn] where [f1,...,fn]:x = „Äàf1:x,...,fn:x„Äâ condition (h ‚áí f;g) where (h ‚áí f;g):x = f:x if h:x = T = g:x if h:x = F = ‚ä• otherwise apply-to-all Œ±f where Œ±f:„Äàx1,...,xn„Äâ = „Äàf:x1,...,f:xn„Äâ insert-right /f where /f:„Äàx„Äâ = x and /f:„Äàx1,x2,...,xn„Äâ = f:„Äàx1,/f:„Äàx2,...,xn„Äâ„Äâ and /f:„Äà „Äâ = unit f insert-left \\\\f where \\\\f:„Äàx„Äâ = x and \\\\f:„Äàx1,x2,...,xn„Äâ = f:„Äà\\\\f:„Äàx1,...,xn-1„Äâ,xn„Äâ and \\\\f:„Äà „Äâ = unit f Equational functions In addition to being constructed from primitives by functionals, a function may be defined recursively by an equation, the simplest kind being: f ‚â° Ef where Ef is an expression built from primitives, other defined functions, and the function symbol f itself, using functionals. FP84 FP84 is an extension of FP to include infinite sequences, programmer-defined combining forms (analogous to those that Backus himself added to FL, his successor to FP), and lazy evaluation. Unlike FFP, another one of Backus' own variations on FP, FP84 makes a clear distinction between objects and functions: i.e., the latter are no longer represented by sequences of the former. FP84's extensions are accomplished by removing the FP restriction that sequence construction be applied only to non-‚ä• objects: in FP84 the entire universe of expressions (including those whose meaning is ‚ä•) is closed under sequence construction. FP84's semantics are embodied in an underlying algebra of programs, a set of function-level equalities that may be used to manipulate and reason about programs.

Bishopston is around Gloucester Road (A38), the main northern arterial road in the city. The ward includes St Bonaventures and Ashley Down parishes, as well as part of Horfield. It is linked with KV Kuppam in Tamil Nadu, India. Politics Bishopston is in the Bristol West parliamentary constituency and elects two City Councillors. Its MP is Labour's Thangam Debbonaire and its councillors are Labour's Tom Brook and the Green Party's Eleanor Combley.  Areas within the council ward  = Bishopston = Bishopston is named after the bishop of the local diocese who controversially sold off the church's land to private developers in the early 19th century. The sale was even raised as an issue in the House of Commons. The parish of Bishopston was then created in July 1862 with a population of 1300 and expanding to 9140 in the Census 1901. In the Census 2001 Bishopston registered a resident population of 11,996. The district is part of the Bristol built-up area, having been swallowed by the growing city, running directly into the surrounding districts of Redland, Ashley Down, Horfield and Henleaze. The area has a relatively large student population, with 21% of the over-16 population in education compared to 8.4% in Bristol and 5.1% in England and Wales. Some of the location filming for the cult BBC sitcom The Young Ones was done in Codrington Road and elsewhere. The external shots for the famous \\"bank-robbing\\" scene in the last episode were filmed outside the now closed Bristol North Swimming Baths on Gloucester Road. Bristol North swimming baths and The Bristol Flyer Pub Bishopston was the home of two Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physicists. In 1933 Paul Dirac, who attended the Bishop Road Primary School, just a few hundred metres from where he lived on Monk Road, won the prize after his contributions to quantum mechanics. In 1950 Cecil Frank Powell won the prestigious award for contributions to Physics (specifically, for his development of the photographic method of studying nuclear processes and his discoveries regarding mesons made with this method). Bishopston was home to television presenter Adam Hart-Davis and psychologist Susan Blackmore. The area has produced many musicians of note Robert \\"3D\\" Del Naja and Daddy G of Massive Attack. DJ Collective Stanton Warriors and International DJ Nick Warren. Juventus and Italian footballer Alessandro Del Piero also lived in the district for a period as a child when his father worked as a restaurateur in the thriving Italian community that lives there. The famous film star Cary Grant (real name Archibald Alexander Leach) attended Bishop Road School in Bishopston. As a child he lived nearby in Hughenden Road next to Horfield Common, where there is a blue plaque to commemorate him. Bishopston has two primary schools, St. Bonaventure's Catholic Primary School which served the huge Italian Irish and South American Catholic community and Bishop Road Primary School COE which was a secondary school up until the mid 1980s and served children of the Anglican faith and drew in children from the Asian and Jamaican community in St Paul's and Montpellier. Gloucester Road, the main route through Bishopston, is known for its independent shops. The main artery, Gloucester Road well known for its pubs and restaurants, and one of the last remaining local high streets in the country, is well used by local residents. In addition to the independently run shops such as Scoopaway, La Ruca, Gardener's Patch and Harvest, recent years has seen several supermarket chains opening stores in the area. This, and the range of fairly traded and local goods available, has made it popular with ecologically minded shoppers. Bishopston is home to Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, located off Nevil Road. The ground's capacity has been increased to hold international cricket matches. The David Thomas Memorial church, in neighbouring St Andrews, was erected between 1879 and 1881 but was demolished in 1987, destroying most of a Gothic fantasy by Stuart Coleman. The building still retains a thin octagonal spire and west front but the massive halls, apse and rib vaults have now gone, and have been replaced by flats by Stride Treglown. = Ashley Down = The area of Ashley Down is divided between the Bishopston and Ashley wards of the city of Bristol. The Brunel campus of City of Bristol College lies within the Bishopston ward as does the Brunel Field site of Ashley Down Junior School, which opened in 2011. = Horfield = A section of Horfield also lies within the boundaries of the Bishopston ward. Part of Horfield Common, as well as the Memorial Stadium, home of Bristol Rovers lies within the ward. Education Bishopston is the location of Bishop Road Primary School, which opened in 1900, and is the largest primary school in Bristol, notable for having educated Cary Grant and Paul Dirac.

In local government terms it is the northernmost suburb of Porirua City. It is 12 km north of the Porirua City Centre on State Highway 1 (SH1), and 30 km north of central Wellington. In MƒÅori, the words puke rua literally mean two hills but it is not clear to which hills the name refers. Pukerua Bay had a population of 1,896 at the 2013 New Zealand census, an increase of 171 people since the 2006 census. There were 942 males and 954 females. 93.2% were European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 9.9% were MƒÅori, 2.3% were Pacific peoples and 1.6% were Asian. History The earliest people known to have lived in the area around Pukerua Bay were the Ngati Iri MƒÅori tribe and later the Muaupoko, who built Waimapihi PƒÅ near today's seaward end of Rawhiti Road. Pukerua Bay was on the main road for MƒÅori travellers going north or south. About 1822, it was invaded from Kapiti Island by Te Rauparaha and his Ngati Toa people. According to oral tradition, the Muaupoko people fled up the gorge of the Waimapihi stream (on the Ohariu Fault line), abandoning their treasures on the way. The land blocks originally surveyed (Wairaka in the west, Waimapihi and Pukerua in the east) were sold to settlers from Europe for farming in the late 19th century. Charles Gray was the first resident to subdivide and sell residential sections in Pukerua Bay, in the early 20th century. Pukerua Bay's development history is curious because the railway went through it (1886) for years before there was good road access (1940), so it grew at first on the waterfront as a weekend destination. The original railway station was named \\"Pukerua\\" until it was changed briefly to Waimapihi in the 1920s and then to \\"Pukerua Bay\\" to avoid confusion with \\"Pukerau\\" in the South Island. By the end of the 1920s, Pukerua Bay numbered 100 houses, a small school on land donated by Charles Gray, and a few small stores. Electricity was put through from Plimmerton to Pukerua Bay in 1927 and in 1928 the track between Plimmerton and Pukerua Bay was formed into a narrow road. The beach remained the main attraction for weekend visitors from Wellington (by steam train) as there was still no highway and no bridge at Paremata. Most of the clifftop development dates from after World War II and Pukerua Bay has its own branch of the Returned Services Association. Pukerua Bay experienced significant growth in the 1950s and 1960s, being connected to Wellington via the (by then double-tracked) railway line and accessible from north and south via SH1. In 1973, Pukerua Bay joined Porirua City Council to get the issues of water and sewerage connection addressed. Growth continued in the 1970s with the Sea Vista Drive subdivision and soon the fact that SH1, with increasing traffic, was going through the middle of Pukerua Bay became an issue. In 1989, an over-bridge over SH1 was opened, after continued lobbying by local residents, which included continually walking across the pedestrian crossing to hold up traffic. Localities The majority of Pukerua Bay is situated in a saddle between hills, about 60-90m above sea level, offering sea views (and views of Kapiti Island and occasionally Mounts Taranaki and Ruapehu to the north) from many houses. The Kaikoura range on the South Island including Mt Tapuaenuku can be seen from some places at the southern end of the township. The coast around Pukerua Bay is fairly steep, with only a few houses nestled in a row behind the two sandy beach areas. The surrounding hills are mainly farm land used for sheep and cattle grazing, providing a rural backdrop to the east and west. The area to the south, along SH1, turns into Taupo Swamp towards Plimmerton. Pukerua Bay's main residential areas are along Rawhiti Road, west of SH1, the central clifftop, Sea Vista Drive east of SH1 and the beach frontage extending east (Brendan Beach) and west of Beach Road. There is a pedestrian bridge over SH1 near Wairaka Road's Kindergarten and pre-school and the school's back entrance (the main entrance is on Rawhiti Road). There are two walks between Pukerua Bay and Plimmerton (5 km south), one around the rocky coast, and one inland (part of a longer cycleway) parallel to the railway. The inland route is pre-European ‚Äì it was traditionally known as te taua tapu (the sacred war-party). The cycleway is known as Te Ara Harakeke (the flax road). The coastal route goes past Marble Arch (Te Ana Puta) to Wairaka Rock on an uninhabited part of Pukerua Bay, the only, mainland home of Whitaker's Skink (Cyclodina whitakeri), an icon of the bay. According to legend, the rock is the petrified wife of culture hero Haunui-a-Nanaia, who pursued her from Mahia Peninsula, naming places on the way including Manawatu, Ohau and Turakina.

It was also the official emblem of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1918 and of the Republic of Belarus from 1991 to 1995. On May 14, 2007 the Pahonia was declared cultural heritage of Belarus. History =Grand Duchy of Lithuania= The charging knight first emerged as a state emblem in the region in 1329 on the seal of duke Alexander Michailovich of Pskov. He was the deputy of Gediminas of Lithuania to Pskov which was a part of Grand Duchy of Lithuania at that time. At the same time duke Narimantas of Polotsk used Pahonia on his seal as well. These facts illustrate that it is the most probable that Pahonia was already in use as a state symbol of Lithuania at least in 1329. However, by Gustyn Chronicle duke Vytenis of Lithuania (1293‚Äì1316) \\"began ruling on Lithuania and designed a coat of arms and a seal for himself and for Lithuania: armed knight riding on a horse; this symbol at present time is called Pahonia\\" (quote by \\"Chronicles about Pahonia's birth\\"). The symbol of the charging knight on horseback passed down through the generations: from Algirdas to his son, Grand Duke Jogaila (ruled 1377 ‚Äì 1392), then to Grand Duke Vytautas (ruled 1392 ‚Äì 1430) and to others. By the 14th century, the charging knight on horseback with a sword had begun to feature in an heraldic shield, first in Jogaila's's seal in 1386 or 1387, and also in the seal of Vytautas in 1401. As early as the 15th century, the heraldic charging knight on horseback became the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and of its central part ‚Äì the Duchy of Lithuania. 16th-century documents refer to it using the Polish term Pogo≈Ñ. At first, the charging knight might appear riding either left or right; and sometimes he held a lance. But as of the first half of the 15th century, all depictions show him riding towards the left (as seen by the viewer), with a sword in his raised hand and a shield in the left hand.

The livery colors became fixed: a white (silver) charging knight on a red field of the heraldic shield. The charging knight at this time bore a blue shield, and set against the blue field appeared a double (gold) cross. The coat of arms featured the Grand Duke's headgear on the crest. At first, the charging knight showed the figure of the ruler of the country, but with time it came to be understood and interpreted as that of a riding knight chasing an intruder out of his native country. Such an understanding became especially popular in the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century. The explanation has a sound historical foundation. We know that at the Battle of Grunwald (1410), where the united Polish‚ÄìLithuanian army crushed the army of the Teutonic Knights (thus putting an end to the Knights' eastward expansion) thirty Lithuanian and Ruthenian regiments out of a total of forty fought under banners flying the sign of the Pahonia. With minor stylistic changes, the Pahonia coat of arms remained the state symbol of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until 1795, when the Russian Empire annexed and extinguished the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth in the Third Partition of Poland. = Russian Empire = File:Vilnia, Antokal, Pahonia. –í—ñ–ª—å–Ω—è, –ê–Ω—Ç–æ–∫–∞–ª—å, –ü–∞–≥–æ–Ω—è (K.

After the first partition of Poland and Lithuania, Catherine the Great gave the Pahonia coat of arms to several towns in the newly acquired ethnic Belarusian and Latgallian territories, including Daugavpils, Ludza, Sebezh, Polacak, Nevel, Haradok, Viciebsk, Surazh, Velizh. The motive for this was that this territory once belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The Pahonia was the coat of arms of the Vilna Governorate following the incorporation of Vilnius and surrounding lands into the Russian Empire. Pahonia statues placed on white columns greeted visitors at the entrances to the city from 1818 until 1840, when the statues were replaced with two-headed eagles ‚Äì the state symbol of the Russian Empire. Uprisings to restore the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth like the 1830‚Äì31 November Uprising and 1863‚Äì64 January Uprising saw the Pahonia used as a symbol of rebellion against the Russian Empire. During the 19th century Lithuanian National Revival, Simonas Daukantas introduced the term wytis in reference to the Pahonia for the first time in a historical work on Lithuanian culture called BudƒÖ Senowƒôs Lietuwi√ª kalneniu ir ≈ªemaiti√ª (1846). The etymology of this particular name is not universally accepted; it is either a direct translation of the Polish Pogo≈Ñ, a common noun constructed from the Lithuanian verb vyti (\\"to chase\\") or, less likely, a derivative from the East Slavic title of the knight, vytiaz'. The earliest known Lithuanian name for the symbol is a 17th-century translation of Pogonia by Konstantinas Sirvydas as Waikimas (\\"Vaikymas\\", according to contemporary Lithuanian spelling), which was used until the 19th century together with Pagaunia (in Lithuanian, \\"pagauti\\" means \\"to catch\\").Lietuvi≈°koje XVIIIa. pabaigos ‚Äì XIXa. literat≈´roje valstybƒós herbas, galima sakyti, vadintas tik Vaikymu, kuris neabejotinai yra lenki≈°kojo Pogonia atitikmuo = Belarusian Democratic Republic = The Pahonia appeared on the state seal of the Belarusian Democratic Republic for a short period between 1918 and 1919. West Belarus became part of interwar Poland, and the Pahonia was used as the symbol of several provinces of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania, namely the Polesie Voivodeship, the Wilno Voivodeship, and the Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship. It was also used by West Belarusian separatist organizations.

Variants were used by Lithuania's independence movement during the perestroika period. Its use was legalised by Lithuania's Soviet authorities in 1988. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union and restored all of its pre-World War II state symbols, including the historic coat of arms. On September 4, 1991, a new design by Arvydas Ka≈ædailis was approved based on recommendations of a special heraldic committee. The new design replaced interwar versions, harkening back to earlier variants used by the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It re-established its original colors but placed the horse and rider in an ostensibly more \\"defensive\\" posture, airs above the ground rather than leaping forward and sword simply elevated rather than ready to strike. Presidential Palace. In 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Pahonia became the coat of arms of the independent Republic of Belarus. The official design of the 1991 coat of arms of Belarus was created by a team of artists led by Jauhien Kulik and Uladzimir Krukouski basing on various Medieval designs of the Pahonia as the coat of arms of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

Since then the Pahonia has served as one of the symbols of the anti-Lukashenko opposition in Belarus. In 2004, Lithuania's Seimas confirmed an historical flag of Lithuania depicting the Pahonia on a rectangular red background, recalling the old battle flags of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The flag does not replace the yellow-green-red tri-color national flag of Lithuania. It is used on special occasions and buildings of historic significance. It is currently proposed that a larger version of the coat of arms be adopted. It would feature a line from \\"Tauti≈°ka giesmƒó\\", the national anthem of Lithuania, \\"Vienybƒó te≈æydi\\" (\\"May unity blossom\\"). The Seimas already uses a larger version of the coat of arms with this phrase as its motto, along with two supporters: the dexter one a griffin argent beaked and membered or, langued gules, and the sinister one a unicorn argent, armed and unguled or, langued gules, and the ducal hat on top of the shield. The President of Lithuania uses the shield and supporters only.

Consolidated Edison, Inc., commonly known as Con Edison (stylized as conEdison) or ConEd, is one of the largest investor-owned energy companies in the United States, with approximately $12 billion in annual revenues as of 2017, and over $48 billion in assets. The company provides a wide range of energy-related products and services to its customers through its subsidiaries: *Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., (CECONY), a regulated utility providing electric and gas service in New York City and Westchester County, New York, and steam service in the borough of Manhattan; *Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc., a regulated utility serving customers in a area in southeastern New York and northern New Jersey; *Con Edison Solutions, an energy services company; *Con Edison Energy, a wholesale energy services company; *Con Edison Development, a company that owns and operates renewable and energy infrastructure projects, and, *Con Edison Transmission, Inc., which invests in electric and natural gas transmission projects.

A year later, it was listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Due to the Board of Aldermen's authority to grant franchises in the City of New York in the early to mid 1800s, interaction with Tammany Hall was required to expand business. By William M. Tweed's reign in the late 1860s as the Boss of Tammany Hall, the power to authorize franchises lay with the County Board of Supervisors, of which Tweed had been a member. By 1871, Tweed was a member of the board of the Harlem Gas Light Company, a precursor to the Consolidated Edison Company. In 1884, six gas companies combined into the Consolidated Gas Company. The New York Steam Company began providing service in lower Manhattan in 1882. Today, Con Edison operates the largest commercial steam system in the world, providing steam service to nearly 1,600 commercial and residential establishments in Manhattan from Battery Park to 96th Street. Con Edison's electric business also dates back to 1882, when Thomas Edison‚Äôs Edison Illuminating Company of New York began supplying electricity to 59 customers in a square-mile area in lower Manhattan. After the \\"war of currents\\", there were more than 30 companies generating and distributing electricity in New York City and Westchester County. But by 1920 there were far fewer, and the New York Edison Company (then part of Consolidated Gas) was clearly the leader. In 1936, with electric sales far outstripping gas sales, the company incorporated and the name was changed to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. The years that followed brought further amalgamations as Consolidated Edison acquired or merged with more than a dozen companies between 1936 and 1960. Con Edison today is the result of acquisitions, dissolutions and mergers of more than 170 individual electric, gas and steam companies. Consolidated Edison acquired land on the Hudson River in Buchanan, NY, in 1954 for the Indian Point nuclear power plant. The first reactor (Indian Point 1) began generating power on September 16, 1962. The reactor was shut down on October 31, 1974, because the emergency core cooling system did not meet regulatory requirements. The company built two more reactors at Indian Point during the 1970s: Indian Point 2 and 3. Indian Point 3 was sold to the New York Power Authority in 1975. Entergy acquired Indian Point 2 in November 2000, nine months after a steam generator leak. With the sale of Indian Point 2, the last power plant it owned, Consolidated Edison, Inc. became primarily an energy distributor. On January 1, 1998, following the deregulation of the utility industry in New York state, a holding company, Consolidated Edison, Inc., was formed. It is one of the nation's largest investor-owned energy companies, with approximately $13 billion in annual revenues and $47 billion in assets. The company provides a wide range of energy-related products and services to its customers through two regulated utility subsidiaries and three competitive energy businesses. Under a number of corporate names, the company has been traded on the NYSE without interruption since 1824‚Äîlonger than any other NYSE stock. Its largest subsidiary, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. provides electric, gas and steam service to more than 3 million customers in New York City and Westchester County, New York, an area of with a population of nearly 9 million. Also in 1998, Consolidated Edison, Inc. acquired Orange & Rockland Utilities, which is operated separately. Systems = Clean energy = To date, Con Edison has invested $3 billion in solar and wind projects. In September 2017 it was announced that the company would invest $1.25 billion in ‚Äúrenewable energy production facilities over the next three years.‚Äù The company's ‚Äúrenewable portfolio‚Äù contains more than 1.5 gigawatts of operating capacity. Seventy-five percent of that capacity comes from solar energy. Clean energy accounts for around eight percent of the company's earnings, as of fall 2017. To support electric vehicles, Con Edison partnered with the company FleetCarma to provide $500 in rewards to owners of electric vehicles in New York City and Westchester County, New York. Through this program, Con Edison pays customers to charge their vehicles when energy demand is low. =Electrical= The Con Edison electrical transmission system utilizes voltages of 138 kilovolts (kV), 345 kV, and 500 kV. The company has two 345 kV interconnections with upstate New York that enable it to import power from Hydro-Qu√©bec in Canada and one 345 kV interconnection each with Public Service Electric and Gas in New Jersey and Long Island. Con Edison is also interconnected with Public Service Electric and Gas via the Branchburg-Ramapo 500 kV line. Con Ed's distribution voltages are 33 kV, 27 kV, 13 kV, and 4 kV. The of underground cable in the Con Edison system could wrap around the Earth 3.6 times. Nearly of overhead electric wires complement the underground system‚Äîenough cable to stretch between New York and Los Angeles 13 times. =Gas= The Con Edison gas system has nearly of pipes‚Äîif laid end to end, long enough to reach Paris and back to New York City, and serves Westchester County, the Bronx, Manhattan and parts of Queens. Gas service in Brooklyn, Staten Island and the rest of Queens is provided by National Grid USA's New York City operations, with the exception of the Rockaway peninsula, which is serviced by National Grid's Long Island operations. The average volume of gas that travels through Con Edison's gas system annually could fill the Empire State Building nearly 6,100 times. =Steam= Con Edison produces 30 billion pounds of steam each year through its seven power plants which boil water to before distributing it to hundreds of buildings in the New York City steam system, which is the biggest district steam system in the world. Steam traveling through the system is used to heat and cool some of New York's most famous addresses, including the United Nations complex, the Empire State Building, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Programs and resources ConEd offers a variety of programs and resources for its customers and stakeholders, organized in such categories as, \\"For Renters\\", \\"For Residential Owners\\", \\"For Small & Medium Businesses\\", \\"For Commercial & Industrial\\", \\"Business Partners\\", \\"Investors\\", \\"Community Affairs\\", and \\"Municipalities\\".

Major accidents and incidents * 1977: All of New York City, with the exception of the Rockaways - which get their power from the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCo) - was blacked out overnight on July 13 and 14, due to lightning strikes on a number of sub-stations and the resulting failures of interconnects in the power grid. * 1989: A steam pipe explosion in Gramercy Park killed three, injured 24, and required the evacuation of a damaged apartment building due to high levels of asbestos in the air. Workers had failed to drain water from the pipe before turning the steam on. The utility also eventually pleaded guilty to lying about the absence of asbestos contamination, and paid a $2 million fine. * 2004: In Manhattan, stray voltage killed a woman walking her dog in the East Village when she stepped on an electrified metal plate. * 2006: After the blackout in Queens, the company was criticized by public officials for a poor record in the restoration of service to its customers.Chan, Sewell. \\"Con Edison Is Ordered to Return $18 Million to Customers\\" The New York Times (November 7, 2007) * 2007: On July 18, an explosion occurred in midtown Manhattan near Grand Central Terminal when an 83-year-old Con Edison steam pipe failed, resulting in one death, over 40 injuries, as well as subway and surface disruptions. * 2007: The day before Thanksgiving, an explosion critically burned Queens resident Kunta Oza when an 80-year-old cast iron gas main ruptured. Oza died on Thanksgiving Day, and her family later settled with Con Edison for $3.75 million. * 2009: Another gas explosion claimed a life in Queens while Con Edison personnel were on the scene. There was a leak in a manhole and a fault in an electrical feeder at the same time. The fault in the feeder caused the explosion due to the sparks being generated. When the mechanic opened the manhole more oxygen entered and the explosion took place. Due to that event, Con Edison has changed its procedure on outside gas leak calls. * 2012: ** On October 29, flooding from Hurricane Sandy caused a transformer explosion at a Con-Ed plant on New York City's East Side. ** During the storm, Con Edison used social media to get outage and restoration information out to customers.

The incident caused a large portion of the sky in the surrounding area to be lit up by blue light that was caused by arc flashes, in which light-emitting atoms of excited gas, called plasma, are projected into the air. The arc flashes probably lasted only a few minutes, but because of meteorological conditions which caused them to be refracted, they were seen across a large portion of the New York City metropolitan area.Staff (December 28, 2018) \\"'Electrical arc' turns night sky blue in NYC\\" WABC-TV Eyewitness News There was no explosion or fire connected to the electrical surge, and no reported injuries. The New York Police Department reported that 911 calls increased from 500 in the half-hour before the event to over 3,200 in the 30 minutes afterwards. ConEd is investigating the cause of the surge in equipment that was intended to monitor voltage in the electrical sub-station, but suspects that the problem was a malfunctioning of its relay system. The lights were nicknamed the \\"Astoria Borealis\\" on Twitter.Gold, Michael (December 28, 2018) \\"How an Explosion (Not Aliens) Turned New York‚Äôs Night Sky an Electric Blue\\" The New York Times *2019: On the night of July 13 a significant portion of Manhattan saw a blackout due to a Consolidated Edison cable that burnt out in a transformer on West End Avenue. The blackout, which lasted for about three hours, shut down a number of subway stations, much of the West Side from the 40s to 72nd Street, parts of Times Square and Rockefeller Center, and other areas, resulting in an estimated 73,000 customers losing power. The outage fell on the anniversary of the 1977 blackout which most of the city lost power. *2020: During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, 170 Consolidated Edison employees tested positive for COVID-19 and three died. Consolidated Edison said they would not shut off service due to non-payment related to the health crisis and would waive any new late-payment charges for customers. Bribery prosecution On January 14, 2009, eleven Con Edison supervisors were arrested for demanding more than $1 million in kickbacks related to work done by a construction company that was repairing the midtown steam pipe eruption of 2007. According to federal prosecutors, the employees had approved payment for work that was unnecessary or not performed, and promised faster payment for some work performed by the construction company in exchange for the bribes. The FBI had two retired Con Edison employees and the president of the construction company wear recording devices that recorded the suspects demanding bribes of between $1000 to $5000. Later that year Con Edison sued Brendan Maher, one of the construction supervisors who was arrested and later admitted taking bribes that the utility company claimed amounted to $10,000. In April 2016, Con Edison agreed to pay over $171 million, about 1.5% of its annual revenue, back to its customers in compensation for harm resulting from the bribery. The Public Service Commission had found that Con Edison failed to supervise the employees. Con Edison admitted no wrongdoing. Honors and criticism In March 2002, Fortune magazine named the company as one of \\"America's Most Admired Companies\\" in the publication's newest corporate ranking survey. In 2003, Con Edison ranked second on the top ten list for electric and gas utilities. In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign released a report criticizing ConEd for spending $1.8 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008‚Äì2010, instead getting $127 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $4.2 billion, and increasing executive pay by 82% to $17.4 million in 2010 for its top five executives. In 2014, Con Edison was named the #1 utility and #16 overall among corporations, in Newsweeks Green Rankings, and one of the 50 best companies for Latinas by Latina Style Magazine. In its \\"Best of the Best\\" issue in 2015, Hispanic Network Magazine named the company a top employer among energy, gas, and oil companies. Con Edison was also selected as one of the top regional utilities by DiversityInc magazine in 2014. In 2016, the company was listed among America's best large employers by Forbes.  Adaptive re-use of former Con Ed buildings  A former Con Edison building on West 53rd Street in Manhattan was converted first into the studio for the television game show Let's Make a Deal, and later into a recording studio called \\"The Power Station\\" because of its Edison history. In 1996, the studio was renamed Avatar Studios. In 1978, Con Edison sold the Excelsior Power Company Building, a former substation on Gold Street in Manhattan's Financial District. It was renovated into an apartment building, and became a New York City designated landmark in 2016.

The work was written around 1912‚Äì1913. Although its nickname was not invented by Scriabin (unlike the nickname White Mass given to his Seventh Sonata), he approved of it.  Structure and content  The ninth sonata is a single movement. It typically lasts 8‚Äì10 minutes, and is marked as follows: #Moderato quasi andante ‚Äì Molto meno vivo ‚Äì Allegro molto ‚Äì Alla marcia ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Presto ‚Äì Tempo primo Like Scriabin's other late works, the piece is highly chromatic. The Black Mass Sonata is particularly dissonant because many of its themes are based around an interval of a minor ninth, one of the most unstable sounds. Its marking 'legendaire' exactly captures the sense of distant mysterious wailing which grows in force and menace.(1997), Ashkenazy notes, p6 The opening theme is constantly transformed, from the early trill arpeggio's sounding unsettling and then completely shifting, eventually tumbling in rapid cascades into a grotesque march. Scriabin builds a continuous structure of mounting complexity and tension, and pursues the combination of themes with unusual tenacity, eventually reaching a climax as harsh as anything in his music. The piece ends with the original theme reinstated. Like Scriabin's other sonatas, it is both technically and musically highly demanding for the pianist, sometimes extending to three staves as opposed to the standard two used in piano music.  Recordings  One of Scriabin's better-known works, the ninth sonata has been recorded and performed extensively, notably by Vladimir Horowitz, Vladimir Sofronitsky, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Sviatoslav Richter, Andrej HoteevDiscographie , Garrick Ohlsson, and Burkard Schliessmann.

As one of the late piano sonatas of Scriabin's career, the music is highly chromatic and almost atonal. George Perle says that, \\"the primary set upon which the Seventh Sonata is based,\\" is, in linear order as spelled by Scriabin, E, F, G, A, B, C, D, and that the mystic chord may be derived from the quartal spelling of this set (with D and without G).Perle, George (1991). Serial Composition and Atonality, p.41. University of California. . Background The White Mass is closely related to its predecessor, the sixth sonata. Both works were written in 1911-12 and have structurally and stylistically more in common than any other pair of Scriabin sonatas.(1994), Taub notes, p. 6 Scriabin reportedly feared the sixth sonata, considering the work to be corrupted by demonic forces and going so far as to refuse to play the work in public.(1997), Ashkenazy notes, p. 6 Scriabin composed his seventh sonata as an exorcism against the darkness of the sixth sonata, subtitling the work White Mass in order to reflect its celestial nature. He intended the mood of the piece to be ecstatic, evoking images of winged flight, voluptuous rapture and overwhelming forces. The composer was especially fond of the piece, probably due to its messianic context and perfected structure, which features more contrast, rhythmic and dynamic, than most of his work. Like the second sonata however, the White Mass gave him a great deal of trouble during its composition. The White Mass Sonata is not structurally directly related to Scriabin's ninth sonata, which was composed in 1912-13 and would later earn the nickname Black Mass Sonata. Structure and content The piece consists of a single movement, lasting around 10‚Äì13 minutes, and is marked \\"Allegro,\\" although the \\"Allegro\\" marking was added later by the publisher. The original tempo marking in Scriabin's hand at the top of the autograph score is \\"Proph√©tique.\\" Additional markings provide clues to the different moods Scriabin intended to convey throughout the work, such as \\"myst√©rieusement sonore\\" (mysteriously sonorous), or \\"avec une sombre majest√©\\" (with a dark majesty). Like the sixth, the seventh sonata is full of violent contrasts, complex counterpoint, advanced tritonal harmonies, and rippling, incandescent arpeggios. The theme marked \\"avec une c√©leste volupt√©\\" (with a heavenly voluptuousness) melodically presents a harmony that recurs throughout the sonata. Another recurring harmony is presented by the theme marked \\"√©tincelant\\" (sparkling). Passages throughout the sonata imitate lightning, clouds of perfume, and distant bells. The chords imitating the ringing of bells were a favourite of Scriabin's, and they provide another harmony that recurs throughout the work (two minor thirds separated by a minor sixth). According to Leonid Sabaneyev, when Scriabin himself played these chords, the ringing sounded from near and afar at the same time; a part of them sounded very real, while another sounded like an echo.Sabaneev (2005), p. 169 There is also a significant five-octave arpeggiated chord at the end, representing a flash of blinding light. The music that follows surges upward in register until the end of the sonata where it dissipates, representing \\"enervation and nonexistence after the act of love.\\" Performance history The White Mass sonata is one of Scriabin's most advanced works. Notable Scriabin masters such as Vladimir Horowitz and Vladimir Sofronitsky did not play or record the piece. However, Sviatoslav Richter performed it a number of times throughout his career, and played it on tours as late as 1994.http://trovar.com/str/discs/scri.html See also *Synthetic chord *Romantic music *20th-century classical music Notes References  External links * * Sonata no 7 performed by Jonathan Powell in Kiev, 30 March 2010 Category:1911 compositions Piano Sonata 07 ","title":"Piano Sonata No. 7 (Scriabin)"},{"id":"899314","text":"The Piano Sonata No. 8, Op. 66, by Alexander Scriabin, was composed between 1912 and 1913. As one of Scriabin's late piano sonatas, the eighth sonata is highly atonal, though arguably less dissonant than some of his other late works. Like Scriabin's other late piano sonatas, the eighth sonata reflects the composer's mystical interests.http://www.allmusic.com/composition/piano- sonata-no-8-op-66-mc0002365693 Scriabin saw some parts of this sonata, which, like the sixth sonata, he never performed in public, as \\"the most tragic episode of my creative work\\". Structure and content The eighth sonata consists of a single movement, and performances range from 10 minutes (Michael Ponti) to 15 minutes (Dmitri Alexeev). #Lento - Allegro agitato This piece is regarded as one of Scriabin's more musically difficult sonatas. It is the longest of Scriabin's sonatas by pages, and many passages are written on three and four staves to a system, as opposed to the typical two staves, to accommodate the complex counterpart and large intervallic spaces. The character of the eighth sonata is perhaps consciously less extreme than that of the Sixth and Seventh, with fewer aggressive dissonances than the former and climaxes that do not explode with the extreme reckless energy of the latter. The eighth sonata begins with almost disquieting placidity as a series of muted bell-like chords are sounded. This languid episode deciduates quite quickly into passages of agitated energy. There are none of the characteristic instructions common in Scriabin's other late sonatas. The furthest he goes is the word \\"Tragique\\" to indicate moments of distressed apathy and futility. In other respects, this is one of Scriabin's more formally experimental sonatas. It is rather episodic, with passages appearing at times to be sewn together almost arbitrarily, like the \\"presto\\" section which begins with staccato chords 'bouncing away' from the previous theme. There are definite moments of serenity (indeed this is the prevailing mood of the sonata), but a large portion of the music seems urgent and fervid. The composer Boris Asafiev argued that the themes in the piece represent natural elements http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dw.asp?dc=W8643_GBAJY9613204 Like his sixth sonata, Scriabin never performed this sonata in public. He considered parts of it \\"the most tragic episode of my creative work\\", and described its harmony as \\"drawn from nature, as if it had never existed before\\".

Construction on the canal began in 1825 and was completed in 1845 at a cost to the state government of $8,062,680.07. At its peak, it included 19 aqueducts, three guard locks, 103 canal locks, multiple feeder canals, and a few man-made water reservoirs. The canal climbed above Lake Erie and above the Ohio River to reach a topographical peak called the Loramie Summit, which extended between New Bremen, Ohio to lock 1-S in Lockington, north of Piqua, Ohio. Boats up to 80 feet long were towed along the canal by mules, horses, and oxen walking on a prepared towpath along the bank, at a rate of four to five miles per hour. Miami and Erie Canal, at Rupps Store, Waterville, Ohio, 1888 Due to competition from railroads, which began to be built in the area in the 1850s, the commercial use of the canal gradually declined during the late 19th century. It was permanently abandoned for commercial use in 1913 after a historic flood in Ohio severely damaged it. Only a small fraction of the canal survives today, along with its towpath and locks. Background The canal figures prominently in this 1841 lithograph view of Cincinnati When Ohio became a state in 1803, transportation to and within the state was difficult; settlers largely moved themselves and their goods on rivers and Lake Erie, for most roads were poor. In addition, Ohio was geographically separated from the East Coast by the barrier of the Appalachian Mountains. This made life difficult for early citizens because goods from the Atlantic Coast and Europe were difficult to obtain and often very expensive due to transportation costs. For the same reasons, it was difficult for Ohio businessmen and farmers to sell their products to markets outside the state. Some entrepreneurs began to ship goods from Ohio down the Ohio River to New Orleans, by sailing ship and keelboats, but the journey was long and costly. Even after steamboats arrived, it was difficult to return vessels upriver. High shipping costs severely limited trade and population growth in the state, especially in areas far from natural waterways such as Lake Erie or the Ohio River, which bounded the state on the north and south, respectively.Prof. J.E. Hagerty, C.P. McClelland and C.C. Huntington History of the Ohio Canals: Their Construction, Cost, Use and Partial Abandonment (Columbus, Ohio: the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society, 1905) To overcome these obstacles, many people, including George Washington and several other politicians, expressed early support for a national canal system to connect many of the country's waterways. In 1807, Senator Thomas Worthington of Ohio (who later became governor) asked the Secretary of the Treasury for funds to improve roads and build canals in Ohio, yet did not have much success. At the time, many prominent leaders in the Democratic Republican party believed that such improvements should be built not by the national government but by the individual states. The United States Congress approved national canal legislation in 1817, 1822, and 1830, but each bill was vetoed by the sitting president. Consequently, the burden of building canals passed to the states. The Erie Canal in New York proved to be an early success after it was completed in 1825.Randolph C. Downes, Canal Days: Lucas County Historical Series Volume II. (Maumee Valley Historical Society. Toledo, Ohio. 1968) The Ohio House and Senate had worked for two decades to pass legislation authorizing a canal, gaining success with the Act of February 4, 1825, which finally approved the construction of the Ohio canal system. The canal was largely state-funded, using money acquired from selling off land near where the canals were to be dug. The state government planned and built two canals in the state: the Miami and Erie Canal, from Cincinnati to Toledo, connecting the Ohio River and Lake Erie; and the Ohio and Erie Canal, which connected Cleveland, another lake port, to Portsmouth, Ohio, on the Ohio River. This system provided the interior of Ohio with new travel routes that effectively extended to the major Atlantic port of New York City, as merchants could ship goods through Lake Erie, the Erie Canal, and the Hudson River to New York. Construction Because Ohio is not entirely flat, the system of locks had to be designed to act as a staircase so boats could navigate the difference in elevation. To supply water for the canal, manmade reservoirs such as Grand Lake St. Marys and Lake Loramie in Shelby County were constructed, along with several feeder canals. Indian Lake in Logan County was greatly enlarged to provide a steadier supply of water for the Sidney feeder canal. Branch canals were built to serve as extensions from the main canal. The Warren County Canal, was a branch canal constructed from the Miami and Erie Canal at Middletown to Lebanon. This branch was opened in 1840, but remained in operation less than 15 years before being abandoned. A short branch, the Sidney or Port Jefferson feeder canal ran up the Miami Valley from Lockington through Sidney to a dam just upstream from Port Jefferson. The following list includes measurement standards for the canal, although these varied by region of the state. * water depth. * wide at water level. * wide towpath in addition to mandated outer slopes. * All slopes are horizontal to . perpendicular. * The canal could accommodate boats up to long and wide. < Decline and abandonment Interior of one of the Lockington Locks. Braces have been installed to prevent the lock from caving in The Miami and Erie never proved to be as profitable as the state government had hoped, as within several years of being completed to Lake Erie it had to compete with railroads. These offered greater speed and capacity for both passengers and goods. Factors limiting the canal's success included the lower population and level of economic development in Ohio, compared to that of New York when its canal was completed. Second, while New York had one canal that was located at the bottleneck of Great Lakes trade, Ohio had two canals, which spread usage too thinly. Third, was the expense of building and maintaining the canals. While the Erie Canal was 363 miles in length, with an elevation change of 700 feet, the combined length of Ohio's canals was 557 miles, with an elevation change of 2,096 feet. Compared to operations of the Erie Canal, the Ohio canal system had less trade and fewer passengers, while it had to operate over a longer length, and at a greater expense. The canal was completed just before most of the railroads in Ohio were built, and it had to compete directly with railroads for the remainder of its operation. Due to the canal freezing over in the winter, as well as the slowness of the boats, the canal was less practical than railroads, especially for perishable goods and passenger traffic. Although the canal services were often cheaper than the railroads, particularly for bulk cargoes such as grain and salted pork, the canal had largely ceased to operate by 1906. The catastrophic Great Dayton Flood of 1913 and the subsequent flood control measures constructed by the Miami Conservancy District destroyed much of the canal infrastructure along the southern portion of the route, where it paralleled the Great Miami River. The canal was permanently abandoned. What was not destroyed was no longer maintained, and slowly many of the remaining locks and sections of canal were destroyed, with the open canal filled in. Much of the original towpath was redeveloped as the right-of-way for the Cincinnati and Lake Erie Railroad, an electric interurban streetcar that operated until 1938. Part of the right-of-way was converted to the Wright-Lockland Highway (now part of Interstate 75). From 1920 to 1925, six million dollars was spent to use the bed of the canal to build a downtown subway in Cincinnati. The surface was later paved over to form Central Parkway, as funds ran out before the Cincinnati Subway could be completed. In the central and northern regions, a large portion of the canal was destroyed when it was filled in to create parts of I-75, U.S. Route 24, and State Route 25.. Some smaller portions of right-of-way have been converted to bike trails for recreational and local commuting use. Legacy Barge General Harrison of Piqua on the canal in the Piqua, Ohio, Historical Area, in July 2006. Note the captain steering the canal boat and the towing mule on the towpath on the far side. The canal is wide enough to permit two barges to pass. Although urban development has destroyed most vestiges of the canal, some locks and sections of the waterway have survived. One of the original locks (#17) is located in the Carillon Historical Park in Dayton. An unrestored but complete lock (#15) is located just off Main Street (State Route 571) in Tipp City. Remains of the Excello lock are located in the Butler County Excello Locks Park near the intersection of State Route 73 and South Hamilton Middletown Road in Lemon Township. The massive west abutment of the Old Nine-mile Aqueduct over the Great Miami River is still present approximately upstream of the Taylorsville Dam east of Vandalia (Montgomery County). The abutment terminates a fairly intact canal segment that extends at least north to Tipp City. This segment includes an intact concrete weir near the abandoned Vandalia water treatment plant (aka \\"Tadmore Station\\") and a ruined lock (#16, \\"Picayune\\") about halfway to Tipp City along Canal Road. On the canal's southern end, a drained section is located in St. Bernard, Ohio's Ludlow Park, where the canal bed is still visible. The canal remains in water (and navigable for canoes or kayaks) in the rural region between Delphos and St. Marys, Ohio. South of St. Mary's, it has degraded to form a shallow ditch in most places, with some ruined locks remaining. From north to south along State Route 66, sections of the original canal are visible in Delphos, at a small historic park located at the Deep Cut in Spencerville, Lock Two (a hamlet mostly consisting of period brick buildings), New Bremen, Minster, Fort Loramie, and Piqua. The Miami and Erie Canal Deep Cut was designated in 1964 as a U.S. National Historic Landmark near Spencerville. The Piqua Historical Area features a replica canal boat and other related items. Anthony Wayne Trail (part of U.S. Route 24 and State Route 25) in and around Toledo, originally named Canal Boulevard, was built on the canal right-of-way, and various relics of the canal survive along the corridor. Much of the canal corridor continues as a prosperous manufacturing area; today Interstate 75 and railroads provide the chief transportation means. An historical reenactment of the Miami-Erie canal days is held during summer and early fall months at Providence Metropark along the Maumee River just west of Toledo near Grand Rapids. Historical actors dress and act as if it is 1876 during the months of May‚ÄìOctober. Two mules pull the canal boat titled The Volunteer, while workers man the tiller and provide commentary to the passengers. Providence Metroparks boasts using original lock 44 as part of the tour.

He succeeded his father, William Allen White, as editor and publisher of the Emporia Gazette in 1944. Among White's most noteworthy books are They Were Expendable and Lost Boundaries, which was adapted into the film Lost Boundaries. Personal life William Lindsay White was the only son of William Allen and Sallie White, born in Emporia, Kansas on June 17, 1900. He had a younger sister, Mary, who was killed in a horse-riding accident at the age of 16 in May 1921. White grew up in Emporia, and worked as a teenager as a reporter for the Gazette. He attended the nearby University of Kansas, and then transferred to and graduated from Harvard College in 1924. He participated in the theatrical activities of the Hasty Pudding Club while at Harvard, co-authoring the book and lyrics of the organization's 1924 show. The elder White groomed his only surviving child for work in journalism, hoping for his son to succeed him as editor of the Emporia Gazette. He took his 18-year-old son to France to witness the signing of the Treaty of Versailles ending World War I. William Allen White eventually persuaded his son to return to Emporia. Shortly before his father's death in 1944, William Lindsay White took over the Emporia Gazette. White attended Harvard and there picked up an English accent. Upon his return to Emporia, he wore a monocle and was one of the best-dressed men in the nation. His wife, Kathrine, born in Cawker City, Kansas, worked on the editorial staff at Time magazine before her marriage. They wed on April 29, 1931, in St. Thomas Church on Fifth Avenue in New York City. The couple maintained a residence in Emporia, they also had a brownstone in New York City in which they lived for half the year. White died of cancer in 1973 in Newman Memorial County Hospital in Emporia. His widow and a daughter survived him. Just before his death, the Emporia city commission renamed the 1940 Civic Auditorium in his honor. After his death, a memorial fund was established in his name to plant more trees in Emporia. By the turn of the century, more than 300 trees had been planted with money from this fund. There is also a bronze bust and a sample of his writing in White Memorial Park at Sixth Avenue and Merchant Street in Emporia. Career He served as associate publisher of the Gazette in the early 1930s. White worked for the Washington Post in 1935 and for Fortune magazine in 1937. In 1939 he became a war correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System and a consortium of 40 newspaper. The National Headliners Club awarded him its prize for best European broadcast of the year for his editorial \\"The Last Christmas Tree\\" from the Mannerheim Line in Finland in 1940. He reported from London in 1940-41 for the North American Newspaper Association and Readers Digest. In 1942 he became Roving Editor for Readers Digest. As editor and publisher of the Emporia Gazette beginning in 1944, White fought many battles with the city. When the old courthouse needed repairs, the city decided to build a new one instead. White led a campaign to repair the old courthouse and lost. He later angered the local chamber of commerce by opposing tax breaks for companies that relocated to Emporia. He opposed urban renewal schemes that benefited real estate interests and merchants in downtown Emporia rather than the poor in need of housing. White was also a radio correspondent for CBS News, sometimes filling in for Edward R. Murrow. For most of his later career, William Lindsay White was Roving Editor for Reader's Digest and published numerous articles in that magazine. White was also actively involved in politics. He served in the Kansas House of Representatives in 1931-32.Kansas State Library-Kansas Legislators Past and Present database White also drummed up support for Dwight D. Eisenhower's run for the Presidency in 1952 and supported his friend Richard Nixon's presidential campaign. When Bob Dole first ran for the United States Senate, White threw a dinner party at the Broadview Hotel and invited most of the Eastern Kansas Republican leaders. The dinner was pivotal to the success of Dole's first campaign. He wrote 14 books during the course of his career, beginning in 1938 with What People Said (1938), which examined the Kansas bond scandal. In 1944, the New York Times described three of his earliest titles as best-sellers: They Were Expendable, Queens Die Proudly, and Journey for Margaret. All were based on his experience as a war correspondent. Three of his books were adapted into feature Hollywood films: They Were Expendable, Journey for Margaret, and Lost Boundaries, based on the true story of Dr. Albert C. Johnston and his African Americans family passing as white in New England. They Were Expendable was a Book of the Month Club selection, as well. He served for a time as an overseer of Harvard. He was elected to the board of the American Civil Liberties Union in 1950. He became an officer of a group formed to aid Russian refugees in 1951, the American Committee for Freedom for the Peoples of the U.S.S.R.

The church and rectory were included as contributing properties in the Jackson Park Historic District that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. St. Patrick's Church is located two blocks away from St. Mary's Church. The reason for the close proximity of the two parishes was that St. Mary was originally built for service to German families of Dubuque, and St. Patrick's provided services for the Irish settlers to Dubuque. History Rectory The parish was founded in 1852 as a mission of St. Raphael Cathedral. The parish buildings were built on land that Bishop Mathias Loras had purchased when it was offered for sale by the Federal government. Originally, a wood frame building was used as a church building, and was located at what is now the front of the rectory. The first church was dedicated by Bishop Loras in 1853. St. Patrick's became an independent parish five years later when the Rev. Patrick McCabe was assigned as the first resident pastor. The cornerstone of the present brick church was laid in 1877, and the building dedicated on August 15, 1878. In 1928, the Rev. J.J. Hanley remodeled and enlarged the church. St. Patrick Church was originally built for service to the Irish settlers of Dubuque and while the parish has maintained a healthy respect for its Irish heritage over its many years of service, the parish now specializes in service to the Hispanic residents of Dubuque. The parish offers a Spanish Mass on Sundays, and the offices of Hispanic ministry are also located at the parish. From 1995 to 2008 a pastoral administrator led the St. Patrick's congregation. During that same time, from 1999 to 2010, St. Patrick's was clustered with St. Mary's Parish. St. Mary's closed in May 2010 and St. Patrick's was clustered with St. Raphael's Cathedral at that time. Architecture A view of the church from behind St. Patrick's Church was designed by Dubuque architect John Keenan in the Gothic Revival style. It is a brick structure built on a Dubuque stone foundation. It features a central tower that is capped with a crown. The main entrance has been altered in subsequent years, but it fits in with the older structure. The church building is seven bays long with the seventh bay on the south end forming a sort of transept. The bays are divided by brick buttresses and each bay contains a paired lancet window. The interior is divided into three naves. The rectory was built in the 1880s to the rear of the church. It is a three-story brick residence capped with a mansard roof. The original porch has been replaced with a single-story addition. Other additions have also been added on the west side of the house. A school building, no longer extant, was built immediately west of the church. It was replaced by a three-story structure in 1951 on the corner of West 15th and Main Streets. The parish sold the building in 2006. It is not considered an historic structure. Schools St. Patrick's Parish had a parochial school for boys established after 1870, while girls attended St. Joseph Academy. St. Patrick's School merged with St. Mary's Catholic School to form Downtown Catholic School in 1982. The organization Holy Family Catholic Schools took control of Downtown Catholic and other Dubuque-area Catholic schools in 2001. Downtown Catholic and Sacred Heart ‚Äì Holy Trinity School became St. Francis School in 2002, and St. Francis closed in 2004. Four Oaks Family and Children Services bought the school building in 2006.

Georges de La Tour (March 13, 1593 ‚Äì January 30, 1652) was a French Baroque painter, who spent most of his working life in the Duchy of Lorraine, which was temporarily absorbed into France between 1641 and 1648. He painted mostly religious chiaroscuro scenes lit by candlelight. Personal life The Penitent Magdalene, 1625‚Äì1650, Metropolitan Museum of Art Georges de La Tour was born in the town of Vic-sur-Seille in the Diocese of Metz, which was technically part of the Holy Roman Empire, but had been ruled by France since 1552. Baptism documentation revealed that he was the son of Jean de La Tour, a baker, and Sybille de La Tour, n√©e Molian. It has been suggested that Sybille came from a partly noble family. Crissy Bergeron Thesis ‚Äì page 7, and note 4, quoting Thuillier p.19 His parents had seven children in all, with Georges being the second-born. La Tour's educational background remains somewhat unclear, but it is assumed that he traveled either to Italy or the Netherlands early in his career. He may possibly have trained under Jacques Bellange in Nancy, the capital of Lorraine, although their styles are very different. His paintings reflect the Baroque naturalism of Caravaggio, but this probably reached him through the Dutch Caravaggisti of the Utrecht School and other Northern (French and Dutch) contemporaries. In particular, La Tour is often compared to the Dutch painter Hendrick Terbrugghen.Anthony Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 1500‚Äì1700, 1953, Penguin In 1617 he married Diane Le Nerf, from a minor noble family, and in 1620 he established his studio in her quiet provincial home-town of Lun√©ville, part of the independent Duchy of Lorraine which was occupied by France, during his lifetime, in the period 1641‚Äì1648. He painted mainly religious and some genre scenes. He was given the title \\"Painter to the King\\" (of France) in 1638, and he also worked for the Dukes of Lorraine in 1623‚Äì4, but the local bourgeoisie provided his main market, and he achieved a certain affluence. He is not recorded in Lun√©ville between 1639 and 1642, and may have traveled again; Anthony Blunt detected the influence of Gerrit van Honthorst in his paintings after this point. He was involved in a Franciscan-led religious revival in Lorraine, and over the course of his career he moved to painting almost entirely religious subjects, but in treatments with influence from genre painting. Georges de La Tour and his family died in 1652 in an epidemic in Lun√©ville. His son √âtienne (born 1621) was his pupil. Works Saint Jerome reading La Tour's early work shows influences from Caravaggio, probably via his Dutch followers, and the genre scenes of cheats‚Äîas in The Fortune Teller‚Äîand fighting beggars clearly derive from the Dutch Caravaggisti, and probably also his fellow-Lorrainer, Jacques Bellange. These are believed to date from relatively early in his career. La Tour is best known for the nocturnal light effects which he developed much further than his artistic predecessors had done, and transferred their use in the genre subjects in the paintings of the Dutch Caravaggisti to religious painting in his. Unlike Caravaggio his religious paintings lack dramatic effects. He painted these in a second phase of his style, perhaps beginning in the 1640s, using chiaroscuro, careful geometrical compositions, and very simplified painting of forms. His work moves during his career towards greater simplicity and stillness‚Äîtaking from Caravaggio very different qualities than Jusepe de Ribera and his Tenebrist followers did. The Musicians' Brawl, (Hurdy-gurdy group), c. 1625‚Äì1630, Getty Museum He often painted several variations on the same subjects, and his surviving output is relatively small. His son √âtienne was his pupil, and distinguishing between their work in versions of La Tour's compositions is difficult. The version of the Education of the Virgin in the Frick Collection in New York is an example, as the Museum itself admits. Another group of paintings (example left), of great skill but claimed to be different in style to those of La Tour, have been attributed to an unknown \\"Hurdy-gurdy Master\\". All show older male figures (one group in Malibu includes a female), mostly solitary, either beggars or saints.Wright, 35, 44‚Äì46 Dice-players, c. 1651, probably his last work. Preston Hall Museum, Stockton-on-Tees, UK. After his death at Lun√©ville in 1652, La Tour's work was forgotten until rediscovered by Hermann Voss, a German scholar, in 1915; some of La Tour's work had in fact been confused with Vermeer, when the Dutch artist underwent his own rediscovery in the nineteenth century. In film Director Peter Greenaway has described La Tour's work as a primary influence on his 1982 film The Draughtsman's Contract. Job Mocked by His Wife by La Tour appears in the 2003 Francis Veber film Le D√Æner de Cons. A reference to a work purportedly by La Tour is featured prominently in the 2003 Merchant Ivory film Le Divorce.

The bureau had \\"cognizance\\" (i.e., responsibility) for the design, procurement, and support of naval aircraft and related systems. Aerial weapons, however, were under the cognizance of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance (BuOrd). Origins The USN's first attempt for naval aviation began in 1908 when it conducted observations of the Wright Brothers aircraft at Fort Myer, Virginia.https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval- aviation/pdf/History%20(1).pdf First tests and Naval Aviation Corps The first test of an aircraft from naval vessel was in 1910 when a Curtiss Model D flown by Eugene Burton Ely took off from the USS Birmingham (CL-2) and again on USS Pennsylvania (ACR-4) in early 1911. These test was enough for the USN to establish naval aviation units in the summer of 1911. The purchase of the first naval aircraft in May 1911https://www.airplanesofthepast.com/us-naval- marine-aviation.htm and passage of naval appropriations act in August 1916 lead to the establishment of the Naval Reserve Flying Corps, which would train and deploy air corps for World War I. Formal Organization of Naval Aviation A Curtiss R3C at the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia in 1926 Congress established BuAer in 1921 in order to create a single organizational home for naval aviation. Prior to 1921, cognizance for aviation had been divided among various Navy bureaus and other organizations. The first Chief of BuAer was Rear Admiral William A. Moffett (1869‚Äì1933), a Medal of Honor recipient and battleship commander who had long supported the development of naval aviation. He served as bureau chief from 1921 until his death in 1933, in the crash of the airship USS Akron (ZRS-4). Working closely with RADM Moffett, CAPT Henry C. Mustin (1874‚Äì1923) served as BuAer's first Assistant Chief helping lead naval aviation to the forefront of American military strength. A talented administrator, Moffett ensured the continued independence of naval aviation during the 1920s, when Army Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell and others sought to merge all U.S. military aviation into a single, independent air force. Upon Moffett's death, he was succeeded as Chief of the Bureau by Rear Admiral Ernest J. King, a future Fleet Admiral and Chief of Naval Operations during World War II. Other important bureau chiefs included Rear Admiral John S. McCain Sr., the grandfather of U.S. Senator John S. McCain III (R-Ariz.). During the 1930s, BuAer presided over rapid technological change in naval aircraft. The bureau's policy was to limit its own production, in order to support the civilian aircraft industry. BuAer used the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as a facility for building small numbers of prototype aircraft. World War II and the postwar period World War II brought immense changes as well. BuAer was forced to expand rapidly in order to comply with the nation's defense needs. By the war's end, the bureau had developed an administrative structure that oversaw thousands of personnel, and the procurement and maintenance of tens of thousands of aircraft. In 1943, the Navy established the position of Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air, or DCNO(Air), a move which relieved some of BuAer's responsibility for Fleet operations. RADM McCain, now promoted to vice admiral, was the first to fill the position. BuAer downsized after the war, but continued its focus on aeronautical research and development. But as naval technology became increasingly complex, it became clear that the Navy's material organization was insufficient. In particular, the Navy needed better integration of aerial weapons with naval aircraft. There was also the question of \\"pilotless aircraft\\" (the ancestors of the late 20th century's Unmanned Aerial Vehicles); BuAer considered these to be aircraft, while BuOrd saw them as guided missiles. To fix the problem, in 1959 the Navy merged BuAer and BuOrd to create the Bureau of Naval Weapons (BuWeps). This was only a temporary solution, however, and in 1966 the Navy undertook a wholesale revision of its material organization. The bureau system, which had existed since the 1840s, was replaced with the \\"Systems Commands\\" (SYSCOMs). BuWeps was replaced with the current Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR).

Grand Lake is the largest inland lake in Ohio in terms of area, but is shallow, with an average depth of only . The state park is open for year-round recreation, including boating, fishing, swimming and hunting. The park consists of the lake and park facilities scattered all around the shore intermingled with private property and a facility operated by Wright State University. It is west of St. Marys, and south-east of Celina, south-west of Lima in the north-western part of Ohio. History Grand Lake St. Marys was constructed in the early 19th century as a reservoir for the Miami and Erie Canal, which connected the Ohio River with Lake Erie. At one time the lake was the world's largest man-made lake. The canal system thrived for about thirty years in the mid-to-late 19th century before it was replaced by the railroads. In the 1890s oil was discovered in the area, and oil derricks were set up in the lake sometime around 1891. This made Grand Lake the location for the first off shore oil drilling to take place. The lake became one of Ohio's first state parks in 1949 with recreational facilities built in the following years. =Names= The official geographic name of the lake is Grand Lake. The United States Geological Survey Board of Geographic Names disapproved a proposal to change the name Grand Lake to Grand Lake-Saint Marys, which is the name given on state maps and documents. The 1920 edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica shows the name as Lake Mercer on the map of Ohio in the article on Ohio. \\"Lake St. Marys\\" was a name introduced in the early 1900s and wasn't popular with Celina residents. The body of water has also been referred to as \\"Grand Reservoir\\" and \\"Lake Celina\\" among other names. Ecology The land on which Grand Lake St. Marys is located was once part of a forest that stretched from the Appalachian Mountains in Pennsylvania to the prairie in Illinois. Much of the forest was cleared by pioneer farmers as the area was settled in the years following the Northwest Indian War. The forests have been replaced by farmland with fields of wheat, soybeans, and corn. Grand Lake St. Marys was once a swampy prairie. When the lake was constructed in the early 19th century, the prairie was flooded. Now the shore of the lake includes woodlands, wetlands and prairie ecosystems that are surrounded by residential development and farms. Several outlier stands of eastern hemlock are present around the lake, and these are the westernmost natural stands in Ohio. The park is located along a major migration route for migratory birds. Commonly seen waterfowl include, geese, loons, ducks, grebes, and swans. Wading birds found in the marshy areas of the park include egrets and herons. American white pelicans have been spotted every year in the park for almost a decade. Historically, these birds bred in the western United States and Canada, but appear to be expanding their range east. White pelican nests were found for the first time on Lake Erie in 2019. Other birds found at the park include cormorants, red- tailed hawks, ospreys, owls such as; great horned owls, barred owls, screech owls, saw-whet owls, and very rarely, snowy owls. The once endangered bald eagle has returned to the area, and there are several nests located around the lake. The most commonly found mammals in the park are cottontail rabbits, mink, fox squirrels, white-tailed deer, eastern coyote, beaver, muskrat, and raccoons. Environmental concerns and restoration efforts Due to the increasingly high levels of lake pollution, E. coli bacteria, and related algae levels, Grand Lake could be dying off as a destination lake and is considered by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency to be \\"impaired\\" due to \\"stream channelization, drainage tiles, loss of floodplains and streamside vegetation, manure runoff and untreated sewage flowing from failing home septic systems and small communities without any wastewater collection or treatment.\\"\\"The Beaver Creek and Grand Lake St. Marys (Wabash) Watershed TMDL\\". Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, Division of Surface Water, Total Maximum Daily Load Program. Retrieved on 2009-06-08. Runoff from farmland is one of the greatest problems. Nutrients of livestock waste and natural and chemical fertilizers are laden with phosphorus and nitrogen. These elements upset the natural balance of the lake and increase the growth of blue-green algae. The algae is a cyanobacterium, with Planktothrix being a particularly prevalent and problematic species. The bacteria produce toxic peptides that can be harmful to plants and animals. Humans are also affected by the toxins. Microcystin can harm the liver and cause other health problems including mild rashes and sneezing and even severe gastrointestinal ailments. Agriculture runoff is not the only source of pollution in the lake. Industrial and commercial drainage contribute to the problem as does drainage from out of date septic tanks and municipal sewage systems. Heavy deposits of silt into the lake also contribute to the degradation of the lake. Development of homes along the shore has reduced the number of native plants that helped to strengthen the shore and reduce erosion. Development has also increased the level of phosphates entering the lake by over fertilization of lawns. These excess phosphates directly contribute to plant growth, including the algae in the lake. The native flora that has been reduced served as a filter to keep the excess nutrients out of the water. Recreation Grand Lake St. Marys State Park is open for year-round recreation, including boating, hunting, fishing, swimming and picnicking. The campground has 216 sites of which 135 are equipped with electricity. Facilities include modern restroom facilities, a laundry and a dump station. Pets are permitted. Grand Lake St. Marys is open to boating, fishing, swimming and water skiing. Boats with unlimited horsepower are permitted on the lake. The state maintains nine launch ramps providing access to the lake. A no-wake zone has been established around the lake's of shore. Boats are prohibited from entering a wildlife refuge on the southwest corner of the lake. The lake is open to fishing year-round. Common game fish include warm water fish such as crappie, bass, yellow perch, and bluegill. Hunting is permitted in designated zones. Grand Lake St. Mary's provides a habitat for a variety of waterfowl. The state owns seventy duck blinds spread throughout the designated hunting zones. There are four public swimming beaches as well as other swimming areas provided for boaters, although as of 2010 the water was deemed unsafe for swimming. and so the beaches are now closed until further notice. There are several picnic areas and picnic shelters. The camp store loans games, fishing and sporting equipment to registered campers. Bike rentals are available at the campground. The park also has a miniature golf course, along with basketball and volleyball courts, horseshoe pits, playground equipment, and a recently added swimming pool. St. Marys Fish Hatchery, located on the lake's eastern shore is operated by the ODNR Division of Wildlife. The hatchery raises saugeye, walleye, channel catfish and bass for stocking in the public fishing waters of the state. The Grand Lake St. Marys Seaplane Base also operates on the lake and serves as Ohio's only airport for seaplanes., effective 2010-06-12 See also *Petroleum industry in Ohio References External links *Grand Lake St. Marys State Park Ohio Department of Natural Resources *Grand Lake St. Marys Fishing Map Ohio Department of Natural Resources *The Lake Improvement Association *Ohio EPA's Assessment of Grand Lake St. Marys *Ohio EPA's Grand Lake St. Marys Toxic Algae page Category:State parks of Ohio Category:Protected areas of Auglaize County, Ohio Category:Protected areas of Mercer County, Ohio Category:Protected areas established in 1949 Category:1949 establishments in Ohio Category:Bodies of water of Auglaize County, Ohio Category:Bodies of water of Mercer County, Ohio Category:Reservoirs in Ohio Category:Nature centers in Ohio ","title":"Grand Lake St. Marys State Park"},{"id":"899355","title":"Universal Entertainment"},{"id":"899357","text":"USS McKee (DD-87) was a built for the United States Navy during World War I.

Their primary weapon, though, was their torpedo battery of a dozen 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in four triple mounts. In many ships a shortage of 1-pounders caused them to be replaced by 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft (AA) guns. They also carried a pair of depth charge rails. A \\"Y-gun\\" depth charge thrower was added to many ships.Friedman, p. 45 Construction and career McKee, the second ship named for Hugh W. McKee, was laid down 29 October 1917 by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, launched 23 March 1918, sponsored by Mrs. J. Tynan, and commissioned 7 September 1918, Lieutenant Commander W. H. Lee in command. Following a west coast shakedown, McKee sailed from Mare Island 13 September 1918, transited the Panama Canal the 27th, and reported for duty with Destroyer Flotilla 5 at New York 2 October. In this late phase of World War I, short coastal sailings preceded her departure from Hampton Roads 28 October as a convoy escort. Upon her arrival in the Azores 5 November she was assigned to a returning convoy and entered New York Harbor 2 December. Early in 1919 she steamed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for fleet exercises from 26 January to 4 April. A number of voyages from Key West, Florida, to Halifax, Nova Scotia, kept her crew well trained prior to her reporting Portsmouth, New Hampshire, 13 December to be placed in reduced commission. From July 1921, McKee based first at Newport, Rhode Island, then at Charleston, South Carolina, and in the aftermath of the Washington Disarmament Conference proceeded to Philadelphia in April 1922. Decommissioning 16 June 1922, she was struck from the Navy list 7 January 1936 and sold to Boston Iron & Metal Company, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland, for scrapping.

He is best known for his close-up photographs of plants and living things, published in 1929 as Urformen der Kunst.Blossfeldt, Karl, Urformen Der Kunst: Photographische Pflanzenbilder, Verlag Ernst Wasmuth A.G. Berlin, 1929 He was inspired, as was his father, by nature and the ways in which plants grow. He believed that \\"the plant must be valued as a totally artistic and architectural structure.\\" Among his students at the Berlin Arts and Crafts School was Heinz Warneke.Cunningham, Mary Mullen, Heinz Warneke (1895‚Äì1983): A Sculptor First and Last, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, 1994 p. 22 From 1923, he was professor at the Vereinigte Staatsschulen f√ºr freie und angewandte Kunst (United State Schools for Fine and Applied Art) in Berlin, Germany. He died aged 67.  Biography  Blossfeldt never received formal training on the subject of photography but apprenticed under Moritz Muerer from 1890 to 1896. Appointed for a teaching post at the Institute of Royal Arts Museum in 1898 (where he remained until 1930), he established an archive for his photographs. Blossfeldt developed a series of home-made cameras that allowed him to photograph plant surfaces in unprecedented magnified detail. This reflected his enduring interest in the repetitive patterns found in nature's textures and forms. Urformen der Kunst, p. 10  Reception and legacy  In Berlin from the late nineteenth century until his death, Blossfeldt's works were primarily used as teaching tools and were brought to public attention in 1928 by his first publication Urformen der Kunst (Art Forms in Nature). Published in 1928 when Blossfeldt was 63 and a professor of applied art at the Vereinigte Staatsschulen f√ºr freie und angewandte Kunst, Urformen der Kunst quickly became an international bestseller and in turn, made Blossfeldt famous almost overnight. The abstract shapes and structures in nature that he revealed impressed his contemporaries. Swiftly regarded as a seminal book on photography, Blossfeldt's objective and finely detailed imagery was praised by Walter Benjamin,Gert Mattenklott: \\"Blossfeldt goes down in Benjamin‚Äôs Kleine Geschichte der Photographie [Brief History of Photography] (1931) as a major authority of the ‚Äòoptico-unconscious,‚Äô equal in importance to Atget, Sander, and Germaine Krull, and, along with these, a defender of ‚ÄòFortress Objectivity' against the pap of photographic synopsis.\\", in who declared that Blossfeldt \\"has played his part in that great examination of the inventory of perception, which will have an unforeseeable effect on our conception of the world\\". He compared him to Moholy-Nagy and the pioneers of New Objectivity, and ranked his achievements alongside the great photographers August Sander and Eug√®ne Atget. The Surrealists also championed him, and Georges Bataille included his images in the periodical Documents in 1929. The publication of his working collages in 2001 threw into question the legitimacy of his association with New Objectivity, as his methods were shown to differ from those of other artists in the movement. In 2001 Urformen der Kunst was included in \\"The Book of 101 Books\\" as one of the seminal photographic books of the twentieth century.

Sherman. According to the official Walt Disney Company website and independent fact checkers, \\"the Sherman Brothers were responsible for more motion picture musical song scores than any other songwriting team in film history.\\" Some of the Sherman Brothers' best known songs were incorporated into live action and animation musical films including: Mary Poppins, The Happiest Millionaire, The Jungle Book, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, Snoopy Come Home, Bedknobs and Broomsticks, The Slipper and the Rose, and Charlotte's Web. Their most well known work, however, remains \\"It's a Small World (After All)\\", composed for the theme park attraction of the same name. According to Time, it is the most performed song of all time. Early life Richard Morton Sherman was born in New York City to Russian Jewish immigrants, Rosa (Dancis) and Al Sherman. Together with his older brother Robert, \\"The Sherman Brothers\\" eventually followed in their songwriting father's footsteps to form a long- lasting songwriting partnership. Following seven years of frequent cross- country moves, the Sherman family finally settled down in Beverly Hills, California in 1937. During Richard's years at Beverly Hills High School, he became fascinated with music and studied several instruments, including the flute, piccolo, and piano. At his 1946 high school graduation, Sherman and classmate Andr√© Previn played a musical duet with Previn on piano and Sherman on flute. The Sherman Brothers later won a 1964 Oscar for Music Score ‚Äì Substantially Original for Mary Poppins and a second for Best Original Song for \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee\\". Army service and education In 1953 Sherman was drafted into United States Army, being assigned to the Army Band and glee club. Serving as musical conductor for both groups from 1953 until his honorable discharge in 1955, he was stationed solely in the United States during his time in the service. During this time, his brother Robert worked with other songwriters. As a student at Bard College, Sherman majored in music, writing numerous sonatas and \\"art songs\\". His ambition to write the \\"great american symphony\\" eventually led him to write songs. Career Within two years of graduating, Sherman and his brother Robert began writing songs together on a challenge from their father, Al Sherman, a successful popular songwriter in the \\"Tin Pan Alley\\" days (\\"No! No! A Thousand Times No!!\\", \\"You Gotta Be a Football Hero\\").Sherman, Robert B. \\"Al's Time\\" in Walt's Time: From Before To Beyond. Santa Clarita, CA: Camphor Tree Publishers, 1998, pg. 119. In 1958, Sherman founded the music publishing company, Music World Corporation, which later worked with Disney's BMI publishing arm, Wonderland Music Company.Sherman, Robert B., \\"'Green Lights On Dopey Drive\\" in Moose: Chapters From My Life, p. 367 That same year, the Sherman Brothers had their first Top Ten hit with \\"Tall Paul\\", which was sung by Annette Funicello. The success of this song attracted the attention of Walt Disney who eventually hired the Sherman Brothers as Staff Songwriters for Walt Disney Studios. While at Disney, the Sherman Brothers wrote what is perhaps their most recognized song: \\"It's a Small World (After All)\\" for the 1964 New York World's Fair. In 1965, the Sherman Brothers won 2 Academy Awards for Mary Poppins - Best Original Score, which included \\"Feed The Birds\\", \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\"; and Best Original Song, \\"Chim Chim Cher- ee\\". Since Mary Poppins' premiere, Robert B. Sherman subsequently earned 9 Academy Award nominations, 2 Grammy Awards, 4 Grammy Award nominations and 23 gold and platinum albums. Robert and Richard Sherman worked directly for Walt Disney until Disney's death in 1966. After leaving the company, the brothers worked freelance as songwriters on scores of motion pictures, television shows, theme park exhibits and stage musicals. Their first non-Disney assignment came with Albert R. Broccoli's motion picture production Chitty Chitty Bang Bang in 1968 which garnered the brothers their third Academy Award Nomination. In 1973, the Sherman Brothers made history by becoming the only Americans ever to win First Prize at the Moscow Film Festival for Tom Sawyer for which they also authored the screenplay. The Slipper and the Rose was picked to be the Royal Command Performance of the year and was attended by Queen Elizabeth. A modern musical adaptation of the classic Cinderella story, Slipper also features both song-score and screenplay by the Sherman Brothers. That same year the Sherman Brothers received their star on the Hollywood \\"Walk of Fame\\" directly across from Grauman's Chinese Theater. Their numerous other Disney and Non-Disney top box office film credits include The Jungle Book (1967), The Aristocats (1970), The Parent Trap (1961), The Parent Trap (1998), Charlotte's Web (1973), The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977), Snoopy, Come Home (1972), Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971) and Little Nemo: Adventures In Slumberland (1992). Outside the motion picture realm, their Tony-nominated Over Here! (1974) was the biggest-grossing original Broadway Musical of that year. The Sherman Brothers have also written numerous top-selling songs, including \\"You're Sixteen\\", which holds the distinction of reaching Billboard's Top Ten twice; first with Johnny Burnette in 1960 and then with Ringo Starr fourteen years later. Other top-ten hits include, \\"Pineapple Princess\\", \\"Let's Get Together\\" and more. In 2000, the Sherman Brothers wrote the song score for Disney's blockbuster film: The Tigger Movie (2000). This film marked the brothers' first major motion picture for the Disney company in over 28 years.TV Ropes: The Sherman Brothers, TVropes.org. Robert (left) and Richard (right) in 2002. In 2002 the stage musical Chitty Chitty Bang Bang premiered in London. It was the most successful stage show ever produced at the London Palladium, boasting the longest run in that century-old theatre's history. In early 2005 a second Chitty company premiered on Broadway (New York City) at the Foxwoods Theatre (then the Hilton Theatre). The Sherman Brothers wrote an additional six songs specifically for the new stage productions. In 2003, four Sherman Brothers' musicals ranked in the \\"Top 10 Favorite Children's Films of All Time\\" in a (British) nationwide poll reported by the BBC. The Jungle Book (1967)_ranked at #7, Mary Poppins (1964) ranked at #8, The Aristocats (1970) ranked at #9 and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968) topped the list at #1. A new Disney and Cameron Mackintosh production of Mary Poppins: The Stage Musical made its world premiere at the Prince Edward Theatre in December 2004 and features the Sherman Brothers classic songs. In June 2005, Richard M. Sherman was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame with his brother. Chitty opened on Broadway in 2005 and commenced its first full UK tour in December 2005 with subsequent tours and/or tour dates in each year since. Mary Poppins opened on Broadway in 2006. In 2008 Mary Poppins embarked on a UK tour as well as a world tour beginning in G√∂teborg, Sweden. Chitty embarked on a tour of 29 cities in the U.S. which ended in 2009. Recently, Sherman once again collaborated with Disney in three of its live- action films, having rewrote the song \\"I Wan'na Be Like You\\" for Jon Favreau's 2016 remake of The Jungle Book. As the film featured the song's performer, King Louie, as a Gigantopithecus, Sherman rewrote it to fit the character's depiction. He also wrote three new songs for the 2018 film Christopher Robin, titled \\"Goodbye Farewell\\", \\"Busy Doing Nothing\\", and \\"Christopher Robin\\", the last two performed by Sherman. Sherman also acted as a music consultant for Mary Poppins Returns, the sequel to Mary Poppins. Sherman will also write new songs for the upcoming musical stage adaptation of The Jungle Book.

Among his most famous subjects were Voltaire, Rousseau, Louis XV and Madame de Pompadour. Biography He was born in Saint-Quentin, the third son of a musician, Fran√ßois de La Tour, a Laonnois and the son of a master mason, Jean de La Tour of Laon and Saint-Quentin who died in 1674. Fran√ßois de La Tour apparently was successively a trumpet-player for the rifle regiment of the duc du Maine, and musician to the master of the Collegiate Church of Saint-Quentin. He is popularly said to have disapproved of his son taking up the arts, but there is nothing to support that. According to Fran√ßois Marandet in 2002, an apprenticeship was arranged for La Tour with a painter named Dupouch from 12 October 1719, but it is not known when this contract was terminated.Fran√ßois Marandet, 'The Apprenticeship of Maurice Quentin de La Tour (1704-88)', The Burlington Magazine, vol. 144, 2002, pp. 502-505 Little is known of Quentin de La Tour's background until, when barely nineteen, he went to Paris indefinitely, fleeing an indiscretion concerning his cousin, Anne Bougier; by this age he was claiming painting as his profession. After travelling briefly to England in 1725, he returned to Paris in 1727, where he was encouraged to begin working as a portraitist in pastels. His earliest known portrait, of which only an engraving by Langlois of 1731 is testament, was that of Voltaire.'Andr√© Michel, 'Causerie artistique: La Tour', Journal des d√©bats politiques et litteraires (274), 2 October 1904, p. 1 In 1737 at the Paris Salon, La Tour exhibited the portraits of Madame Boucher, the wife of the painter Fran√ßois Boucher, and l'Auteur qui rit or Self-Portrait, Laughing (mus√©e du Louvre), the first of a splendid series of 150 portraits that served as one of the glories of the Paris Salon for the next 36 years. Nevertheless, the painter Joseph Ducreux claimed to be his only student (although this is unlikely). On 25 May 1737 La Tour was officially recognised (agr√©√©) by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture, and soon attracted the attention of the French court. According to Jeffares, he had an apartment in the palais du Louvre in 1745, although his portraits for the royal family had ceased by the late 1760s. La Tour was popularly perceived as endowing his sitters with a distinctive charm and intelligence, while his delicate but sure touch with the pastel medium rendered a pleasing softness to their features. Contemporary accounts describe Quentin de La Tour's nature as lively, good-humoured, but eccentric. In many of his self-portraits he depicts himself smiling out from the frame towards the viewer; Laura Cumming states of La Tour that \\"where other artists make heavy weather of portraying themselves, he takes the task lightly and seems to have produced more glad-faced self-portraits than any other artist\\". However, of an excessively nervous disposition (which eventually descended into dementia), and an exacting practitioner, he has also been accused of over-engineering his work, to the point of spoiling it.Emilia, Lady Dilke, French Painters of the XVIIIth Century (London: George Bell and Sons, 1899), p. 165 As La Tour's wealth increased from his commissions, so did his philanthropy; he founded a school for drawing in his native Saint-Quentin and donated towards poor women in confinement, and disabled and ageing artisans and artists. He was also advisor and benefactor to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in Paris, and the Academy of Sciences and Belles Lettres of Amiens. Eventually confined to his home and the care of his brother, Jean-Fran√ßois, because of encroaching mental illness, he retired at the age of 80 to Saint-Quentin, where he died intestate at the age of 83 (he had revoked earlier wills). Jean-Fran√ßois de La Tour (d. 1807), chevalier de l'ordre royal militaire de Saint-Louis, was the natural heir to his estate. The mus√©e Antoine L√©cuyer in the town of Saint-Quentin is home to many of La Tour's pastels from his own studio; it offers the visitor not only a synthesis of La Tour's life and work but also a selective and concentrated view of French eighteenth century society and costume.

Burke was a goal kicker and regular try-scorer for the Wallabies who contributed to the team's victories in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, multiple Bledisloe Cups and Australia's sole test series win against the British and Irish Lions in 2001. When he retired from international rugby in 2004 he was the leading points scorer in the multinational Super Rugby Competition. He is the most-capped fullback and the second highest scorer for Australia in Test rugby. Early life Burke grew up in Carlingford, New South Wales, and attended at St Gerard Majella Catholic Primary School, Carlingford and St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill. He was selected for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1990 and toured with the teams to the United States and Ireland. He played his club rugby with Eastwood and maintained his association with the club throughout his career. Rugby career Burke progressed to the Australian Under 21s team in 1992 and 1993 at the same time as playing at the Hong Kong Sevens in 1992 and the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993. He made his Test debut in 1993 when he played in the third Test against the South African Springboks. =Bledisloe Cup and early Wallabies years= In the national team for two years as the starting fullback and goal-kicker, Burke gained early attention for scoring arguably one of the most impressive tries in Bledisloe Cup history during the second match of the 1996 tournament, held on 27 July at Brisbane Suncorp Stadium. After gathering a low pass from felled teammate Richard Tombs (from a standing start from his own 22-meter line), Burke dodged a total of six defenders culminating with a 'dummy pass' to another teammate Ben Tune ‚Äì allowing him to cover approximately 75 meters to score a try. The try put Australia ahead 16‚Äì9 at half time. Whilst the All Blacks would win with a last minute try to Frank Bunce ‚Äì this game is particularly remembered for Burke's try. In 1997, Burke was excluded from the Wallabies by a groin strain suffered during the domestic season and he was temporarily replaced by Stephen Larkham; then also a goal-kicking fullback. However he returned in time for the first Bledisloe Cup match in 1998, at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where he scored all 24 (2 tries, 1 conversion and 4 penalties) of the Wallabies points against New Zealand. It is an individual point-scoring world record against the All Blacks ‚Äì which still stands. Australia had not beaten the All Blacks for four years in a single game up to that point and this heralded not only an Australian comeback, but an unprecedented five-year domination of the tournament. =Goal-kicking and shoulder injury= Burke was considered one of the finest test goal-kickers of his day ‚Äì second, perhaps, to contemporary rival New Zealand kicker Andrew Mehrtens. At a time before it became common in test rugby, Burke was one of the few goal-kickers able to take successful penalty attempts from beyond the half-way line. Yet he was known to have clusters of missed goal-kicking attempts. In the third match of the 1998 Bledisloe Cup, he missed three straightforward kicking attempts in the first half ‚Äì before being relieved of kicking duties under instruction from Australian Captain John Eales in the second half (being in fact relieved of the goal-kicking by Eales himself). In the dying minutes of that particular march, he gained some measure of redemption by scoring a match-winning try but was also afflicted by a serious shoulder injury ‚Äì sidelining him for the better part of the next year. =Rugby World Cup 1999= After undergoing surgery on the affected shoulder, Burke delayed his comeback to the domestic Rugby season, in an attempt to right himself for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. As a result, Burke faced some criticism for NSW's subsequent poor performance in the Super 12 competition that year and also caused tension between himself and NSW Coach Matt Williams. At test level, he was being relieved by emerging rival Chris Latham, at the fullback position. Despite making it back in the squad in time to contribute to the 1999 Rugby World Cup victory, it has been speculated that this injury affected his counter-attacking playing style and future fitness. As part of the campaign to \\"Bring back Bill\\", as the starting Wallaby fullback and primary goal-kicker in the 1999 Rugby World Cup, he scored the majority of Australia's points in the last two games to help secure victory ‚Äì 24 points against in the Rugby World Cup semi-final and 25 points against in the grand final. Earlier in 1999, in an echo of the previous year at the MCG, he individually kicked 23 (1 conversion and 7 penalties) points against the All Blacks at Stadium Australia. =Selection battles with Chris Latham= After the 1999 World Cup, Burke had become plagued by ongoing injuries which were severely limiting his recovery and return to form. While his goal kicking and fairly regular try-scoring had saved Australia in many games; his injuries would soon take their toll. Queensland Reds fullback Chris Latham was soon competing with him for Wallabies selection and Latham was the favoured Australian fullback in the 2000 Bledisloe Cup. This began the twilight phase of Burke's career where he was switched between various back- line positions before intermittently being recalled to starting fullback. Latham, who had performed strongly at Super Rugby level began his test career with many costly defensive errors at fullback in 2000 and 2001‚Äì which initially helped to preserve Burke's place at the number 15 jersey. =Lions series 2001= Burke regained his starting fullback position for the Wallabies in the second test of the 2001 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, after Latham was dropped for a poor performance in the first game of the series. This was Burke's first start in the number 15 jersey since the 1999 Rugby World Cup and he ended-up playing a starring role in the Australian comeback in the final two games. In the deciding third game, both sides drew on tries and conversions but his five penalties against three by future Newcastle Falcons teammate Jonny Wilkinson left the hosts 29‚Äì23 winners at Sydney's Stadium Australia. To date, it is the only Australian series victory over the combined multi-nation British Lions. He was also part of the Wallabies team which beat the New Zealand All-blacks for the first time in 2001 at their traditional stronghold at Carisbrook, Dunedin. =Positional switch to outside centre= Burke was made to switch positions when playing for the Wallabies for most of the remainder of his career ‚Äì at first to wing, and then to outside centre during a period of continual experimentation with the Wallabies back-line. This was initially done to accommodate both Chris Latham at test level, and for newly converted former professional rugby league footballer Mat Rogers at the state level for the NSW Waratahs (Rogers later playing fullback for the Wallabies as well while Latham was either benched or playing at wing). Burke was considered versatile enough to satisfactorily fulfill these roles whilst now primarily considered a specialist kicker. Many commentators said that he was restricted from playing more freely in a counter-attacking role, while not in his favoured fullback position. Burke himself has stated that he always considered himself a fullback and that the decision to switch him to outside centre was a mistake. Complicating matters for national selectors, the Australian National Rugby Team now became saturated with a flurry of traded National Rugby League 'convert' players ready to replace aging back-line first generation professional players such as Burke (Rugby Union was only made a professional sport in 1996). Burke was otherwise retained as vice-captain and goal-kicker for the 2002 season. That year, he famously kicked a penalty after full-time to win the Bledisloe Cup in windy conditions at Stadium Australia ‚Äì one of the last times his influence was crucial to the outcome of a match (and incidentally, the last time Australia held the Bledisloe Cup as of 2019). =Rugby World Cup 2003= In 2003 he was given back the starting fullback position, one last time ‚Äì but ultimately did not perform well enough to retain it. Midway through the 2003 Rugby World Cup he was axed from the starting line-up following a narrow pool win over Ireland (17‚Äì16); a match in which he was substituted after 64 minutes. He was replaced by former professional rugby league footballer Mat Rogers, which drew mixed reactions and he would be relegated to the bench for the rest of his test career. By this time Mat Rogers was already the starting goal-kicker (after being brought on the field as a substitute in the world cup pool game against Namibia, Burke was signaled that Rogers was to continue as primary kicker by the coaching staff after attempting to take the ball from him for an attempt at goal) and he, along with Chris Latham, had finally emerged as the two preferred fullbacks. Future wallabies captain Stirling Mortlock had also simultaneously become the leading outside centre. Further diminishing the aging Burke's place on the team was the fact that there were now at least four other recognised goal-kickers in the team ‚Äì Mortlock, Rogers, Matt Giteau and Elton Flatley ‚Äì who all admirably performed as replacements to Burke. However Australia, to date, has never again had a regular goal kicker with a similar tenure. =Final year with the Waratahs= In 2004, any hope of rekindling his international career was over when he was controversially completely dropped from his state team, the NSW Waratahs. While he was injured early in that Super 12 season ‚Äì he still managed to score 62 points from his first six games; placing him ahead of Andrew Mehrtens in the all-time points lead of the Super 12 (now Super Rugby) competition. Yet 'inconsistent performance' was cited as the key reason behind the axing. Others have speculated his age as the reason for Burke's dumping ‚Äì this is questionable considering NSW simultaneously attempted to 'convert' footballer Andrew Johns from rival code league, despite Johns' and Burke's similar ages. NSW Coach (and former NSW and Australian teammate) Ewen McKenzie's decision to drop Burke drew ire from many in the union fraternity, including Phil Kearns and Simon Poidevin, who accused McKenzie of disloyalty and being shortsighted. In a sign of continued bad blood between the two, McKenzie would later ridicule suggestions that Burke would be recalled to the Australian Wallabies in 2007 (see below); describing it as return of the \\"superannuation crew\\". Burke responded by deriding McKenzie's apparent \\"ignorance of British Club Football\\" ‚Äì where he was playing at that time. However, Burke would later endorse McKenzie for Wallabies coach prior to his appointment in late 2013. Despite his expected retirement, Australian Coach Eddie Jones described Burke's axing from the NSW squad as an \\"independent event\\" ‚Äì indicating some use for Burke at test level. Indeed, Burke did appear intermittently as a substitute in various roles, including fullback, for the Wallabies in the 2004 season. He played his last international test for the Wallabies on 21 August 2004 against South Africa, coming off the bench for the final six minutes ‚Äì where he missed a penalty attempt (Australia lost 23 ‚Äì 19). In 2006, in his last international appearance, he was starting fullback for the World XV Rugby team against the South African Springboks for their first 2006 game ‚Äì contributing 17 points (5 pen, 1 con) in their 27 to 30 points loss. =Playing in England= After losing his Super Rugby playing contract with the NSW Waratahs, Burke was offered contracts by eight different clubs ‚Äì including other teams in the Super Rugby competition. Interested teams reportedly included the Queensland Reds and teams in New Zealand, South Africa, Italy, France and England. Wallaby coach Eddie Jones also kept the door open for further test duty depending on the availability/fitness of certain players for the Wallabies tour of the UK in late 2004, but Burke contradicted this statement by confirming his retirement and stating it was unlikely that he would play test rugby again. Burke joined the Newcastle Falcons in the English Premiership. Here he has played alongside former English rival Jonny Wilkinson (his opposite kicker in Lions tour of Australia). He has also won the 'Player of the Year' at the Falcons and was named as captain of the side. In February 2007, he obtained a British passport (while retaining Australian citizenship), qualifying through his England-born mother. His main reason for doing so was Guinness Premiership regulations prohibiting teams from having more than one non-European Union citizen on the field at any time. This enabled the Falcons to play him at the same time as New Zealand prop Joe McDonnell. In 2007, there was again brief speculation that Burke would return as starting fullback for the Wallabies in the Tri- nations and Bledisloe Cup tournament; which would lead up to the world cup. Chris Latham was recovering from knee reconstruction and Mat Rogers had since returned to Rugby League. He was even formally approached by new Wallabies coach John Connolly regarding his availability for that season. Burke rejected this, citing commitments to his Newcastle side in the UK ‚Äì but did state he would consider another approach regarding the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Burke was not ultimately approached, as Latham had sufficiently recovered. Had Burke come back to play for Australia ‚Äì it would have set a new precedent as the ARU have stood firm in only considering Australia-based talent for Test selection since the game went professional in 1996. =Retirement= In May 2008 Burke announced his immediate retirement from playing after failing to recover from a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee suffered the previous October.Burke's career is ended by injury BBC Sport Legacy in the game Owing to Matt Burke's lasting impact in the New South Wales jersey, the Waratahs' Player of the Year is now awarded the Matt Burke Trophy. In addition to being a leading fullback and playing with the Wallabies for over a decade, Burke's third year as New South Wales Waratahs captain saw him become the first player in the history of Waratah rugby to play over 100 games. Burke is still Australia's most capped fullback, having played 54 of his 81 Tests in that position. After breaking 1000 career points for NSW in 2003, he has scored 878 Test points for Australia. In Bledisloe Cup contests, he still holds the individual record for total test points against New Zealand (176 points in 17 Tests). Burke was voted starting fullback in the Wallaby Team of the Decade which celebrated the first ten years of professional rugby union, spanning 1996 to 2005. Post-rugby sports and media career Since his retirement he has opened a sports business, which specialises in skills sessions for children. In early 2013, Matt joined Network Ten's coverage of the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour to Australia, and is an expert commentator for Australia's coverage of the 2013 Rugby Championship. In October 2013, Burke was appointed as sport presenter on 10 News First in Sydney, after Brad McEwan moved to Melbourne to present sport for 10 News First.

Specifically, a topological space X is compactly generated if it satisfies the following condition: :A subspace A is closed in X if and only if A ‚à© K is closed in K for all compact subspaces K ‚äÜ X. Equivalently, one can replace closed with open in this definition. If X is coherent with any cover of compact subspaces in the above sense then it is, in fact, coherent with all compact subspaces. A compactly generated Hausdorff space is a compactly generated space that is also Hausdorff. Like many compactness conditions, compactly generated spaces are often assumed to be Hausdorff or weakly Hausdorff. Motivation Compactly generated spaces were originally called k-spaces, after the German word kompakt. They were studied by Hurewicz, and can be found in General Topology by Kelley, Topology by Dugundji, Rational Homotopy Theory by F√©lix, Halperin, and Thomas. The motivation for their deeper study came in the 1960s from well known deficiencies of the usual topological category. This fails to be a cartesian closed category, the usual cartesian product of identification maps is not always an identification map, and the usual product of CW-complexes need not be a CW-complex. (See the Appendix) By contrast, the category of simplicial sets had many convenient properties, including being cartesian closed. The history of the study of repairing this situation is given in the article on the nLab on convenient categories of spaces. The first suggestion (1962) to remedy this situation was to restrict oneself to the full subcategory of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, which is in fact cartesian closed. These ideas extend on the de Vries duality theorem. A definition of the exponential object is given below. Another suggestion (1964) was to consider the usual Hausdorff spaces but use functions continuous on compact subsets. These ideas can be generalised to the non-Hausdorff case. (See section 5.9) This is useful since identification spaces of Hausdorff spaces need not be Hausdorff.P. I. Booth and J. Tillotson, \\"Monoidal closed, Cartesian closed and convenient categories of topological spaces\\", Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 88 (1980) pp.33-53. In modern-day algebraic topology, this property is mostly commonly coupled with the weak Hausdorff property, so that one works in the category of weak Hausdorff compactly generated (WHCG) spaces. Examples and counterexamples Most topological spaces commonly studied in mathematics are compactly generated. *Every Hausdorff compact space is compactly generated. *Every Hausdorff locally compact space is compactly generated. *Every Hausdorff first-countable space is compactly generated. *Topological manifolds are locally compact Hausdorff and therefore compactly generated Hausdorff. *Metric spaces are first-countable and therefore compactly generated Hausdorff. *Every CW complex is compactly generated Hausdorff. Examples of topological spaces that fail to be compactly generated include the following. * The space (\\\\mathbb R \\\\backslash \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{3}, \\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}) \\\\times (\\\\mathbb R/\\\\\\\\{1,2,3,\\\\ldots\\\\\\\\}) , where the first factor uses the subspace topology, the second factor is the quotient space of R where all natural numbers are identified with a single point, and the product uses the product topology. * If \\\\mathcal F is a non-principal ultrafilter on an infinite set X, the induced topology has the property that every compact set is finite, and X is not compactly generated. Properties We denote CGTop the full subcategory of Top with objects the compactly generated spaces, and CGHaus the full subcategory of CGTop with objects the Hausdorff spaces. Given any topological space X we can define a (possibly) finer topology on X that is compactly generated. Let {KŒ±} denote the family of compact subsets of X. We define the new topology on X by declaring a subset A to be closed if and only if A ‚à© KŒ± is closed in KŒ± for each Œ±. Denote this new space by Xc. One can show that the compact subsets of Xc and X coincide, and the induced topologies on compact sets are the same. It follows that Xc is compactly generated. If X was compactly generated to start with then Xc = X otherwise the topology on Xc is strictly finer than X (i.e. there are more open sets). This construction is functorial. The functor from Top to CGTop that takes X to Xc is right adjoint to the inclusion functor CGTop ‚Üí Top. The continuity of a map defined on a compactly generated space X can be determined solely by looking at the compact subsets of X. Specifically, a function f : X ‚Üí Y is continuous if and only if it is continuous when restricted to each compact subset K ‚äÜ X. If X and Y are two compactly generated spaces the product X √ó Y may not be compactly generated (it will be if at least one of the factors is locally compact). Therefore when working in categories of compactly generated spaces it is necessary to define the product as (X √ó Y)c. The exponential object in CGHaus is given by (YX)c where YX is the space of continuous maps from X to Y with the compact-open topology. These ideas can be generalised to the non-Hausdorff case. This is useful since identification spaces of Hausdorff spaces need not be Hausdorff.

The term prosumer is a portmanteau of the words 'provider' and 'consumer'. Thus, a prosumer is an individual who not only consumes but also produces. Research has identified six types of prosumers: DIY prosumers, self-service prosumers, customizing prosumers, collaborative prosumers, monetised prosumers, and economic prosumers. The terms prosumer and prosumption were coined in 1980 by American futurist Alvin Toffler, and were widely used by many technology writers of the time. The term has since come to refer to a person using commons-based peer production. Technological breakthrough has fastened the development of prosumption. With the help of additive manufacturing techniques, for example, co-creation takes place at different production stages: design, manufacturing and distribution stages. It also takes place between individual customers, leading to co-design communities. Similarly, mass customisation is often associated with the production of tailored goods or services on a large scale production. This increase in participation has flourished following the increasing popularity of Web 2.0 technologies, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Flickr. This rise in user participation blurs the line between production and consumption activities, with the consumer becoming a prosumer. Li, R.Y.M. (2018). Addictive manufacturing, prosumption and construction safety, in: An Economic Analysis on Automated Construction Safety, Springer [online] https://www.researchgate.net/search.Search.html?type=publication&query;=Addictive%20manufacturing,%20prosumption%20and%20construction%20safety The sharing economy is another context where individuals can act as prosumers. For example in the sharing economy, individuals can be providers (e.g., Airbnb hosts, Uber drivers) and consumers (e.g., Airbnb guests, Uber passengers). Prosumers are one avenue to grow the sharing economy. Definitions and origins Prosumers have been defined as: \\"individuals who consume and produce value, either for self-consumption or consumption by others, and can receive implicit or explicit incentives from organizations involved in the exchange.\\" The blurring of the roles of consumers and producers has its origins in the cooperative self-help movements that sprang up during various economic crises, e.g. the Great Depression of the 1930s. Marshall McLuhan and Barrington Nevitt suggested in their 1972 book Take Today, (p. 4) that with electric technology, the consumer would become a producer. In the 1980 book, The Third Wave, futurologist Alvin Toffler coined the term \\"prosumer\\" when he predicted that the role of producers and consumers would begin to blur and merge (even though he described it in his book Future Shock from 1970). Toffler envisioned a highly saturated marketplace as mass production of standardized products began to satisfy basic consumer demands. To continue growing profit, businesses would initiate a process of mass customization, that is the mass production of highly customized products. However, to reach a high degree of customization, consumers would have to take part in the production process especially in specifying design requirements. In a sense, this is merely an extension or broadening of the kind of relationship that many affluent clients have had with professionals like architects for many decades. However, in many cases architectural clients are not the only or even primary end-consumers, a distinction touched upon in the H+ Magazine essay 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative'.Lorimer, A. 'Prosumption Architecture: The Decentralization of Architectural Agency as an Economic Imperative', H+ Magazine, 2014, [online] http://hplusmagazine.com/2014/01/13/prosumption-architecture-the- decentralisation-of-architectural-agency-as-an-economic-imperative/ [04/02/14] Toffler has extended these and many other ideas well into the 21st-century. Along with more recently published works such as Revolutionary Wealth (2006), one can recognize and assess both the concept and fact of the prosumer as it is seen and felt on a worldwide scale. That these concepts are having global impact and reach, however, can be measured in part by noting in particular, Toffler's popularity in China. Discussing some of these issues with Newt Gingrich on C-SPAN's After Words program in June 2006, Toffler mentioned that The Third Wave is the second ranked bestseller of all time in China, just behind a work by Mao Zedong. Don Tapscott reintroduced the concept in his 1995 book The Digital Economy., and his 2006 book Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything with Anthony D. Williams. George Ritzer and Nathan Jurgenson, in a widely cited article, claimed that prosumption had become a salient characteristic of Web 2.0. Prosumers create value for companies without receiving wages. Mass customization has not taken place in most areas of the economy. Mass customization has ruled the food and beverage industry for years, as evidenced by the diversity of brand offerings at supermarkets and fast-food chains. Brand extension and dilution are ways companies have sold more under various names, giving consumers thousands of choices. Most consumption continues to be passive, as critics of television, recorded music, and fast food would argue. Indeed, people are generally uninterested in going to the effort of customizing the myriad products that comprise modern consumer culture. In The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less, Barry Schwartz argues that diminishing returns from a confusing abundance of consumer choice is producing stress and dissatisfaction.3 Still, one key area of high-customization is taking place: highly involved hobbyists. In the digital and online world, ‚Äùprosumer‚Äù is used to describe 21st-century online buyers because not only are they consumers of products, but they are able to produce their own products such as, customised handbags, jewellery with initials, jumpers with team logos etc. In the field of renewable energy, prosumers are households or organisations which at times produce surplus fuel or energy and feed it into a national (or local) distribution network; whilst at other times (when their fuel or energy requirements outstrip their own production of it) they consume that same fuel or energy from that grid. This is widely done by households by means of PV panels on their roofs generating electricity. Such households may additionally make use of battery storage to increase their share of self-consumed PV electricity, referred to as prosumage in the literature. It is also done by businesses which produce biogas and feed it into a gas network while using gas from the same network at other times or in other places. The European Union‚Äôs Nobel Grid project, which is part of their Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, uses the term in this way, for example. Toffler‚Äôs Prosumption was well described and expanded in economic terms by Philip Kotler, who saw Prosumer/Prosumption as a new challenge for marketers.Kotler, Philip. (1986). Prosumers: A New Type of Customer. Futurist(September‚ÄìOctober), 24-28. Philip Kotler anticipated that people will also want to play larger role in designing certain goods and services they consume, furthermore modern computers will permit them to do it. He also described several forces that would lead to more prosumption like activities, and to more sustainable lifestyles, that topic was further developed by Tomasz Szymusiak in 2013 and 2015 in two marketing books.Szymusiak T., (2013). Social and economic benefits of Prosumption and Lead User Phenomenon in Germany - Lessons for Poland [in:] Sustainability Innovation, Research Commercialization and Sustainability Marketing, Sustainability Solutions, M√ºnchen. Szymusiak T., (2015). Prosumer ‚Äì Prosumption ‚Äì Prosumerism, OmniScriptum GmbH & Co. KG, D√ºsseldorf. From a corporate perspective, it can be beneficial for a company to open up its processes to the end-users, integrating them as prosumers. Such motivated enthusiasts can be, for instance, brought into a company's research and development process. This may produce strengthened customer relations and faster feedback cycles. Companies and individuals are increasingly utilizing and involving the end-users to develop final products and services. In some instances, end-users are creating products on their own, without the interference from or assistance of companies, organizations, etc. For example, Lego Mindstorms allows users to download software from Lego's website so that the users can edit and update software as they wish. In July 2020, an academic description reported on the nature and rise of the \\"robot prosumer\\", derived from modern-day technology and related participatory culture, that, in turn, was substantially predicted earlier by science fiction writers. =Activism= Among some activist groups, the producer and consumer roles are being combined so as to exclude (or at least diminish) the role of the corporate producer; thus, rather than generating higher corporate profits from value-added products, producers would, at best, be reduced to supplying lower-profit commodity inputs. Indeed, the more consumer-oriented prosumer spin is irrelevant to many people with diminished disposable income caused by various economic trends such as globalization, automation, and wealth concentration.  Impact and reception  =Adoption= Identifiable trends and movements outside of the mainstream economy that have adopted prosumer terminology and techniques include: *a Do It Yourself (DIY) approach as a means of economic self-sufficiency or simply as a way to survive on diminished income *the open source software movement creates software on their own, prime example is the successful operating system Linux which now dominates the server domain *Fablab movement, self-fabrication capabilities especially 3d printing *the voluntary simplicity movement that seeks personal, social, and environmental goals through prosumer activities such as: **growing one's own food **repairing clothing and appliances rather than buying new items **playing musical instruments rather than listening to recorded music *use of new media- creation and distribution technologies to foster independent, open, non- profit, \\"consumer-to-consumer\\" media and cultures (see Wikipedia, Indymedia, most of Creative Commons); many involved in independent media reject mass culture generated by concentrated corporate media *self-sufficient barter networks, notably in developing nations, such as Argentina's RGT have adopted the term prosumer4 See also *Commons-based peer production *Creative consumer *Read/write culture *Cost the limit of price *Participatory culture *Power user *Produsage Notes References * Chen, Katherine K.

In people with wavy or straight hair, the hairstyle is instead typically created with the help of permanent hair structure-changing creams or gels and/or other solidifying liquids to temporarily hold the hair in place. Particularly popular in the African- American community of the late 1960s and early 1970s, the hairstyle is often shaped and maintained with the assistance of a wide-toothed comb colloquially known as an Afro pick.  Etymology  \\"Afro\\" is derived from the term \\"Afro- American\\". The hairstyle is also referred to by some as \\"natural\\"‚Äîparticularly the shorter, less elaborate versions of the Afro‚Äîsince in most cases the hair is left untreated by relaxers or straightening chemicals and is instead allowed to express its natural curl or kinkiness.  History in the United States  = Circassian beauties = One of P. T. Barnum's Circassian beauties wearing an afro In the 1860s, a hairstyle similar to the afro was worn by the Circassian beauties. Sometimes known as \\"Moss-haired girls\\", they were a group of women exhibited in sideshow attractions in the United States by P. T. Barnum and others. These women claimed to be descendants of the Circassian people in the North Caucasus region, and were marketed to White audiences captivated by the \\"exotic East\\" as pure examples of the Caucasian race who were kept as sexual slaves in Turkish harems.Linda Frost, Never One Nation: Freaks, Savages, and Whiteness in U.S. Popular Culture, 1850-1877, University of Minnesota Press, 2005, pp. 68-88.The Circassian beauty archive A collection of historic Images - Circassian Beauties It has been argued that this portrayal of a Caucasian woman as a rescued slave during the American Civil War played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time so that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show white Circassian with African- American identity, and thus: = African-American hairstyles prior to the 1960s = Global hair texture distribution During the history of slavery in the United States, most African Americans styled their hair in an attempt to mimic the styles of the predominantly white society in which they lived.

Retrieved February 20, 2010. These characteristics represented the antithesis of the European American standard of beauty, and led to a negative view of kinky hair. As a result, the practice of straightening gained popularity among African Americans. The process of straightening the hair often involved applying caustic substances, such as relaxers containing lye, which needed to be applied by an experienced hairstylist so as to avoid burning the scalp and ears.Mercer, Kobena, Welcome to the Jungle: New Positions in Black Cultural Studies, Routledge, 1994, pp. 104‚Äì113.

This cultural movement marked a return to more natural, untreated hairstyles. The Afro became a powerful political symbol which reflected black pride and a rejection of notions of assimilation and integration‚Äînot unlike the long and untreated hair sported by the mainly White hippies. To some African Americans, the afro also represented a reconstitutive link to West Africa and Central Africa. However, some critics have suggested that the afro hairstyle is not particularly African:Rielly, Edward J., The 1960s, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, p. 86. Retrieved February 20, 2010. In his book Welcome to the Jungle: New Positions in Black Cultural Studies, cultural critic Kobena Mercer argued that the contemporary African society of the mid-20th century did not consider either hairstyle to denote any particular \\"Africanness\\"; conversely, some Africans felt that these styles signified \\"First-worldness\\". Similarly, Brackette F. Williams stated in her book Stains on My Name, War in My Veins: Guyana and the Politics of Cultural Struggle that African nationalists were irritated by the fro's adoption by African Americans as a symbol of their African heritage; they saw this trend as an example of Western arrogance.Williams, Brackette F., Stains on My Name, War in My Veins: Guyana and the Politics of Cultural Struggle, Duke University Press, 1991, p. 260.

The afro was adopted by both men and women and was a hairstyle that was easier to maintain by oneself, without requiring frequent and sometimes costly visits to the hairstylist as was often experienced by people who chose to braid, straighten or relax their hair. Due to the kinky pattern prominent in fro-textured hair, as it grows longer it has a tendency to extend outward from the head, resulting in a domelike hairstyle which is easily molded and sculpted into the desired shape. While the afro was a much less invasive and time-consuming hairstyle choice for many African Americans, some chose to achieve a more voluminous version of the afro by backcombing or teasing the hair, a practice that can result in damage to the hair and scalp.Garland, Phyl, \\"Is The Afro On Its Way Out?\\", Ebony, February 1973.

As a result, the late 1960s/early 1970s saw an expansion in the overall size of fros.

A young girl wearing a hairstyle of several sections of hair bound with elastics, a style called afro puffs In contrast, the afro's popularity among African Americans had already started to wane by the early 1970s; the introduction of the afro to the mainstream and its adoption by people of non-African descent caused the afro to lose its radical, political edge. The 1970s saw an increase in the popularity of braided hairstyles such as cornrows among both sexes of African Americans. = 1990s and 2000s = The afro saw some resurgence in both the 1990s and the 2000s.Irvine, Martha, \\"The Afro Strikes Back\\", Associated Press, March 8, 2002.

These afros would take varied forms, some incorporating elements such as braids, beads or twists, as well as various sizes, from close-cropped natural hairstyles all the way to expansive afro wigs. Some African Americans who have been known for wearing afros or afro wigs during these two decades include NBA basketball players Ben Wallace, Kobe Bryant, and Michael Beasley, as well as musicians Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu, Macy Gray, Ludacris, Questlove, Cindy Blackman, Wiz Khalifa, and Lenny Kravitz. Beyonc√© also donned a large afro wig for her role as Foxxy Cleopatra in the 2002 film Austin Powers in Goldmember. On July 3, 2019, California became the first state in the United States to prohibit discrimination over natural hair. Governor Gavin Newsom signed the CROWN Act into law, banning employers and schools from discriminating against hairstyles such as afros, braids, twists, and locks. Likewise, later in 2019 Assembly Bill 07797 became law in New York state; it \\"prohibits race discrimination based on natural hair or hairstyles.\\"  Similar styles internationally  The afro was also somewhat common in Ireland. The Irish afro was most famously worn by Irish Traditional singer Luke Kelly. A \\"Jewfro\\" (portmanteau of the words Jew and afro) or (rarely) \\"Isro\\" (portmanteau of the words Israel and afro) refers to an afro when worn by white Jews. The term has its roots in the 1960s and 1970s when many prominent figures were described as sporting the hairstyle. The Los Angeles Times called college football star Scott Marcus a flower child with \\"golden brown hair ... in ringlets around his head in what he calls a Jewish afro style\\".Dan Hafner, \\"Louisville's 'Flower Child'; Barefooted Punter Arrives in Shoes and Mod Outfit\\", Los Angeles Times, December 17, 1970.

The Hadendoa Beja of northeastern Africa were called Fuzzy-Wuzzies by British colonial troops during the Mahdist War of the late 19th century due to their often large and mop-like hairstyles, which they shaped by applying butter or mutton fat. In Somalia, some young men of the nomadic and sedentary communities would grow their hair long and carefully comb it into rather large bushes, which they would then hold in place with ghee. This elaborate hairstyle was quite distinct from another coiffure found among other Somalis, who would instead grow long and fluff out their fine, straight hair and place a chewing stick and comb in the center. Variations of the afro have been worn by one or both sexes in the many disparate cultures of the African continent. Due to the hairstyle's links to members of the African-American Civil Rights and Black Power movements, the afro was seen by several outside cultures as a dangerous symbol of political unrest, including Tanzania where the Afro was banned in the 1970s because it was seen as a symbol of neocolonialism and as part of an American cultural invasion.Meisler, Stanley, \\"Afro Hairdo Riles Africa's Blacks\\", The Milwaukee Journal, September 22, 1970.

In the 1950s and 1960s, South African women were also known to wear their hair in a fro-type style. The afro did not rise to the same level of popularity among the Afro-Caribbean community as it did in the United States, in part because of the popularity of dreadlocks, which played an important role in the Rastafari movement. Not unlike the fro's significance among the members of the American Black Power movement, dreadlocks symbolized black pride and empowerment among the Rastafari of the Caribbean.

He was the author of \\"En mi Viejo San Juan\\", a song \\"widely known around the world\\". Early years Estrada was born in the town of Isabela, Puerto Rico where he received his primary education. During the Great Depression, many Puerto Ricans either emigrated to the United States (mainly to the northeastern coast area) or joined the armed forces, with the hope of improving their economic situation. At the outbreak of World War II, Estrada joined and served in the United States Army. Being away from his homeland for the first time in his life would in the future serve him as inspiration when composing the bolero \\"En mi viejo San Juan\\". In his youth, he joined Fi Sigma Alfa fraternity. Musical compositions Estrada became a government employee after being honorably discharged from the Army. He was a protocol official for the State Department. It was during the 1940s and 1950s that he wrote and interpreted his songs in Puerto Rico and in the U.S. Among the many songs which he wrote were the following: \\"El Romance del Cafetal\\" (Romance of the coffee field); \\"Verde Navidad\\" (Green Christmas); \\"El Amor del J√≠baro\\" (The poor farmers Love); \\"Pobre Amor\\" (Poor Love); \\"Pedacito de Borinquen\\" (A piece of Puerto Rico); \\"Amor del Alma\\" (Love of the Soul); \\"Lo Nuestro Termino\\" (Our love is Finished); \\"Ll√©vame a Ver a Jes√∫s\\" (Take Me to see Jesus\\"); etcetera. However, it was \\"En mi Viejo San Juan\\" (In my Old San Juan) that would bring Estrada international acclaim. \\"En Mi Viejo San Juan\\" Estrada composed \\"En mi Viejo San Juan\\" in the 1940s, in New York City. It is Estrada's most popular composition, and is considered a second national anthem by many Puerto Ricans, especially those who live abroad. The City of San Juan honored Estrada as an adopted citizen and would later adopt the song as its official city anthem. Later years Estrada's composition \\"Mi romantico San Juan\\" (My romantic San Juan) won a first prize in the \\"Festival of the Puerto Rican Composer\\". In 1966, the City of San Juan honored Estrada by declaring him its adopted son. Noel Estrada died in the City of San Juan in 1979. San Juan and the town of Isabela have honored Estrada's memory by naming streets and a school after him.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 2, 2003. It is the 300th episode to be broadcast; though \\"Barting Over\\" is indicated on-screen to be the 300th episode, it is actually the 302nd. In the episode, Marge develops agoraphobia in response to a traumatic mugging and overcomes the fear through exercise and bodybuilding, which leads to her taking anabolic steroids, raping her husband Homer Simpson and experiencing a change in personality. Carolyn Omine wrote the episode, and Pete Michels directed. Pamela Reed guest starred as recurring character Ruth Powers. Plot The Simpson family goes to Rainier Wolfcastle's bankruptcy garage sale. Homer asks Rainier if he has anything that will increase in value when he dies, and is shown an old weight-lifting set, complete with dumbbells and bench press. Homer takes it and packs everything and everybody in the car in the style of a Tetris game. The car ends up being so overpacked that Homer has no room in it for himself and ends up being carried home by Rainier Wolfcastle in a baby harness built for an adult. On the way home, Marge and the kids discover that Maggie has soiled her diaper. Marge pulls into the Kwik-E-Mart, and changes Maggie in the restroom. As she is leaving the store, a shady character in a Goofy hat accosts her and threatens her with a gun. Finding only diapers in Marge's purse, he grabs Marge's pearl necklace and takes off. Marge, stunned, walks to her car in a daze and breaks down crying at the wheel in front of her kids. The next day, they inform the police and Chief Wiggum declares he will investigate immediately. Later, as Marge is about to leave the house, Homer gives her some pepper spray and some tips on how to handle an attacker. She pulls up to the Kwik-E-Mart, but she snaps when Ralph greets her. She pepper-sprays him on impulse and, feeling guilty, drives back home where she feels safe. When she reaches home, Bart tells her she is parked over the mailman. Marge is a nervous wreck and cannot bring herself to cross the threshold of her house to help the mailman. Dr. Hibbert diagnoses Marge with agoraphobia. Homer and the kids try their best over the next few days to encourage her to go outside, but to no avail. Eventually, she moves into the basement. There, feeling a bit safer, she prepares breakfast for the family and sets up a bed for herself. One day, when she is alone at home, she eyes Rainier Wolfcastle's weight-lifting set and decides to use it to pass the time. In two weeks, she builds herself up and even gets a well-defined washboard stomach (much to Homer's delight). She dashes out to the garden to get some lemons and, realizing that she is not afraid anymore, starts running around town. She runs into her mugger; even though the mugger does not move a finger against Marge, she beats him to a bloody pulp out of revenge in a scene that references the 1972 film The Godfather, when Sonny Corleone beats his brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi. The cops arrive and arrest the crook, and Marge starts exercising even more. One day, as she jogs by an open-air gym at the beach, she runs into Ruth Powers, her old neighbor (seen in episodes \\"New Kid on the Block\\" and \\"Marge on the Lam\\"). Ruth is also very muscular, and tells Marge that she owes it all to steroids. She talks Marge into using them, and also advises Marge to enter a women's bodybuilding contest. Using the steroids, Marge exercises harder than ever, becoming very muscular and estrogen-depleted, which results in a short temper and a violent streak. Homer, seeing these changes, finds himself less attracted to her. When Homer refuses Marge's sexual advances the night before the contest, she callously ignores his worries and then proceeds to pin him down and rape him, before leaving him completely sore and exhausted to take care of the kids the next morning. That night, the family attends the Iron Maiden Fitness Pageant to see the women's bodybuilding final. Marge wins second place, which irritates her when her muscular ears overhear her family's unhappy conversation in the audience. Later that night, at Moe's, Marge boasts to all the male attendees about her performance at the competition. Homer then tells her he is proud of her ability to bulk up but not lose her femininity. Marge is angered by that, saying that was the reason she came in second place. She then tells everyone at the bar that she intends to up her glycol-load, use a denser ripping gel, and that she did not sacrifice her period to come in second place. Moe says to Marge, \\"I don't got enough booze to make you look good\\". She flies into an uncontrollable rage and ultimately trashes the bar. Homer confronts his wife as she prepares to hurl Lenny at him. Terrified, Homer tells Marge that he misses the sweet, feminine woman he married. Marge, horrified with what she has done, apologizes, drops Lenny, and leaves with Homer. In order to cover the costs of repairing his bar, Moe sets fire to it; however, Carl points out that he has not insured the place yet. Later, at the Simpson house, Marge burns the weight set in the furnace as the show ends. Homer asks if Marge is ready for a \\"real workout\\" which turns out to be a request to wax the car, after which he gets beaten by Marge into meekly saying that he was just kidding. Production In her original pitch for the episode, Carolyn Omine had Homer being the one to get mugged, becoming agoraphobic as a result. Al Jean had the idea of Marge becoming a bodybuilder after going through these events, so it was changed from Homer to Marge. Omine was initially concerned that while Homer being mugged is humorous, Marge being mugged is serious, and later acknowledged that it turned into a \\"rare serious moment that was kinda cool\\".Omine, Carolyn.

(2002). Commentary for \\"Strong Arms of the Ma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Al Jean thought that showing Marge threatened and vulnerable was a great emotional moment that had not been done on the show before. He notes that the attacker ripping off her pearl necklace makes her seem \\"naked\\" and that it changes her.Jean, Al. (2003). Commentary for \\"Strong Arms of the Ma\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Fourteenth Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Al Jean noted that when characters go very off model, it can cause issues. He noted that some were thrown off by the Marge-on- steroids look and said Marge probably should not have gotten as muscular as she did. The idea behind the design was that Marge, wanting to never be weak again, ends up overcompensating to become super aggressive and overpowering. Omine said that these things, plus her becoming less likable and off-model, was a negative combination. Themes \\"Strong Arms of the Ma\\" addresses the issue of steroid rage. After becoming addicted to the drug, Marge has a moment of realization, claiming \\"steroids have turned me into everything I hate\\". While the authors of The Psychology of the Simpsons: D'oh! do not condone the \\"violent destruction\\" of Marge in the episode, they reason that both the in- universe characters and the real-world audience attribute Marge's behaviour to the drugs and not an \\"innately mean personality\\". They argue that Marge was not \\"herself\\". Mood changes and aggression are both documented side effects of \\"prolonged steroid use\\". Cultural references The episode title is a reference to the common phrase \\"The Strong Arm of the Law\\". The way how Marge defends herself against her mugger is the same as in a scene in the film The Godfather. In the bar scene where Marge looks upon her destruction, Samuel Barber's Adagio for strings ‚Äì also used in the movie Platoon ‚Äì plays in the background. Reception Reviewing this season, DVD Verdict said, \\"There are some real clinkers this season. Both 'Large Marge' and 'Strong Arms of the Ma' prove that writing good episodes about Marge seem to be out of the question by this point.\\" Cinema.com describes the premise as \\"Marge becomes agoraphobic (yes, only for one episode) after being mugged on the street and rather strangely decides that the best thing to do is take up weight lifting. It‚Äôs just a silly as it sounds. Another dud of an episode. DVD Talk said, \\"What's encouraging is that the 300th episode, whether it's ‚ÄòBarting Over‚Äô or ‚ÄòStrong Arms of the Ma,‚Äô is simply a number to the writers and producers of The Simpsons at this point, rather than a finish line. As of this writing, the show is knocking on the doorstep of 500 and doesn't appear to be slowing down at the moment, and it's slight changes in focus for the show's seasons that make it worth appreciating, and this one is no different.\\" References External links *\\"Strong Arms of the Ma\\" at The Simpsons.com * * Category:The Simpsons (season 14) episodes Category:2003 American television episodes Category:Agoraphobia in fiction Category:Television episodes about mental illnesses Category:Television episodes written by Carolyn Omine fi:Simpsonit (14. tuotantokausi)#√Ñiti v√§kev√§ (The Strong Arms Of The Ma) ","title":"The Strong Arms of the Ma"},{"id":"899407","text":"Conjectural images of the Imperial Regalia of Japan. Presentation of the sword Kusanagi no Tsurugi and the Yasakani no Magatama at the enthronement of Emperor Akihito, 1989 The are the Imperial Regalia of Japan and consist of the sword , the mirror , and the jewel . They represent the three primary virtues: valor (the sword), wisdom (the mirror), and benevolence (the jewel).„Éü„ÉãË¨õË©± ÂÆÆÂè∏„ÅÆ„ÅÑ„ÅÑË©± (in Japanese). Due to the legendary status of these items, their locations are not confirmed, but it is commonly thought that the sword is located at the Atsuta Shrine in Nagoya, the jewel is located at the Three Palace Sanctuaries in K≈çkyo (the Imperial Palace in Tokyo), and the mirror is located at the Ise Grand Shrine in Mie Prefecture. Tradition Since 690, the presentation of these items to the Emperor by the priests at the shrine has been a central element of the enthronement ceremony. This ceremony is not public, and these items are by tradition seen only by the Emperor and certain priests. Because of this, no known photographs or drawings exist. Two of the three treasures (the jewel and the sword), as well as the Privy Seal and State Seal, were present at the abdication of Emperor Akihito on 30 April 2019. Akihito's successor, Naruhito, formally took possession of them in a brief ceremony on 1 May 2019. Prior to these events, they were last in public during the accession and enthronement of Akihito in 1989 and 1990. On all of these occasions, they remained shrouded from view in packages or boxes. According to legend, these treasures were brought to earth by Ninigi-no-Mikoto, legendary ancestor of the Japanese imperial line, when his grandmother, the sun goddess Amaterasu, sent him to pacify Japan. These treasures were eventually said to be passed down to Emperor Jimmu, who was the first Emperor of Japan and was also Ninigi's great-grandson. Traditionally, they were a symbol of the emperor's divinity as a descendant of Amaterasu, confirming his legitimacy as paramount ruler of Japan. When Amaterasu hid in a cave from her brother Susanoo-no-Mikoto, thus plunging the world in darkness, the goddess Ame-no- Uzume-no-Mikoto hung the mirror and jewels outside the cave and lured her out of the cave, at which point she saw her own reflection and was startled enough that the gods could pull her out of the cave. Susanoo later presented the sword Kusanagi to Amaterasu as a token of apology; he had obtained it from the body of an eight-headed serpent, Yamata no Orochi. At the conclusion of the Genpei War in 1185, the eight-year-old Emperor Antoku and the Regalia were under the control of the Taira clan. They were present when the Taira were defeated by the rival Minamoto clan at the Battle of Dan-no-ura, which was fought on boats in the shallow Kanmon Straits. The child emperor's grandmother threw herself, the boy, the sword, and the jewel into the sea to avoid capture. The mirror was recovered, but according to the main account of the battle, a Minamato soldier who tried to force open the box containing it was struck blind. The jewel was recovered shortly afterwards by divers, but the sword was lost.Turnbull, Stephen (2006) Samurai: The World of the Warrior, Osprey Publishing, (pp. 33-38) There are a number of medieval texts relating to the loss of the sword, which variously contended that a replica was forged afterwards, or that the lost sword itself was a replica, or the sword was returned to land by supernatural forces.Selinger, Vyjayanthi R. (2013) Authorizing the Shogunate: Ritual and Material Symbolism in the Literary Construction of Warrior Order, Brill Academic Publishers, (pp. 114-118) The possession by the Southern Dynasty of the Imperial Regalia during the Nanboku- ch≈ç period in the 14th century has led modern chroniclers to define it as the legitimate dynasty for purposes of regnal names and genealogy. The importance of the Imperial Regalia to Japan is also evident from the declarations made by Emperor Hirohito to K≈çichi Kido on 25 and 31 July 1945 at the end of World War II, when he ordered the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal of Japan to protect them \\"at all costs\\".Kido Koichi nikii, Tokyo, Daigaku Shuppankai, 1966, pp.1120‚Äì21.

It was organized in 1915 following the catastrophic Great Dayton Flood of the Great Miami River in March 1913, which hit Dayton, Ohio particularly hard. Designed by Arthur Ernest Morgan, the Miami Conservancy District built levees, straightened the river channel throughout the Miami Valley, and built five dry dams on various tributaries to control flooding. The district and its projects are unusual in that they were funded almost entirely by local tax initiatives, unlike similar projects elsewhere which were funded by the federal government and coordinated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Historical perspective The 1913 flood has been ascribed in part to the 1912 eruption of Mount Katmai and its daughter volcano Novarupta in Alaska. In one of the greatest recorded volcanic events, Novarupta emitted enough fine ash into the atmosphere to block sunlight and cool the climate of the Northern Hemisphere that winter. The success of the Miami Conservancy District helped to inspire the development of the much larger Tennessee Valley Authority during the Great Depression. Dams The district manages five dry dams. They are hydraulic fill dams constructed from 1919 to 1922 using fill trestles. =Englewood Dam= Located near Englewood, Englewood dam is the largest of the dams maintained by the district. It regulates the flow of the Stillwater River into the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and stretches . U.S. Route 40 crosses the top of the dam. The dam can contain of flood water over . It was constructed in 1919 and consists of as much earth as the Great Pyramid of Giza. =Germantown Dam= Located near Germantown, Germantown Dam regulates the flow of Twin Creek into the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and wide. The dam can contain of flood water over (12 km¬≤). It was constructed in 1920. =Huffman Dam= Located near Fairborn, Huffman Dam regulates the flow of the Mad River into the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and spans . The dam can contain of flood water over . =Lockington Dam= Located north of Piqua outside the village of Lockington, Lockington dam regulates the flow of Loramie Creek into the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and spans . The dam can contain of flood water over (15 km¬≤). It was constructed in 1919. =Taylorsville Dam= Located near Vandalia, Taylorsville Dam regulates the Great Miami River. It consists of of earth, is high and spans . When full, the dam would inundate (39 km¬≤). It was constructed in 1919. Recreation The Miami Conservancy District (MCD) actively promotes and develops recreational amenities throughout the Great Miami River Watershed. MCD owns and/or maintains an extensive recreation trail system (nearly 34 miles) throughout Montgomery County. The trail system is part of a network of 340 miles of multi-use, paved pathhttps://www.miamivalleytrails.org/about that connect Dayton east to Xenia and near Chillicothe and London, south to Franklin, west to near Greenville, and north to Piqua.https://www.mcdwater.org/wp- content/uploads/2017/05/TRAILS_MAP_2017-WEB.pdf MCD maintains several boat ramps to encourage recreation on the Great Miami River Watershed waterways. MCD also offers river recreation maps to the Great Miami, Mad and Stillwater rivers which make up the national and state-designated Great Miami River Watershed Water Trail ‚Äì the largest water trail system in Ohio. The trail collectively offers 291 miles of waterway accessible to recreational boaters, fishermen and wildlife watchers. Low dams: MCD owns three low dams. Only Two- mile Dam in Hamilton is part of the flood protection system. The other low dams create a pool of water upstream of each dam for recreation, including boating and fishing. The cities of Hamilton, West Carrollton, and Moraine, pay an assessment for MCD to maintain the recreational dams. RiverWalk: The Dayton RiverWalk runs along the levee-top between the Main Street Bridge and the Monument Avenue (Dayton View) Bridge on each side of the Great Miami River. The total length of the lighted, crushed gravel walkway loop, including the two bridges, is about 1 mile. The walkway is easily accessible from the end of either bridge. All of these projects were constructed and are maintained by funds separate from flood protection or groundwater assessments. Assessments to cities ‚Äì as well as grants and other revenue sources ‚Äì pay for the construction and maintenance of MCD recreation amenities.

While working at a local mine, Sander first learned about photography by assisting a photographer who was working for a mining company. With financial support from his uncle, he bought photographic equipment and set up his own darkroom. He spent his military service (1897‚Äì99) as a photographer's assistant and the next years wandering across Germany. In 1901, he started working for a photo studio in Linz, Austria, eventually becoming a partner (1902), and then its sole proprietor (1904). He left Linz at the end of 1909 and set up a new studio in Cologne. In 1911, Sander began with the first series of portraits for his work People of the 20th Century. In the early 1920s, he came in contact with the Cologne Progressives a radical group of artists linked to the workers' movement which, as Wieland Schmied put it, > \\"sought to combine constructivism and objectivity, geometry and object, the > general and the particular, avant-garde conviction and political engagement, > and which perhaps approximated most to the forward looking of New > Objectivity [...] \\".Wieland Schmied: \\"Neue Sachlichkeit. Der deutsche > Realismus der zwanziger Jahre\\", in: Kritische Grafik in der Weimarer Zeit, > Op. cit., p. 21. As cited in: August Sander 1876‚Äì1964. Lange, Susanne, p. > 108. In 1927, Sander and writer travelled through Sardinia for three months, where he took around 500 photographs. However, a planned book detailing his travels was not completed. Sander's Face of our Time was published in 1929. It contains a selection of 60 portraits from his series People of the 20th Century, and is introduced by an essay by Alfred D√∂blin titled \\"On Faces, Pictures, and their Truth.\\" Under the Nazi regime, his work and personal life were greatly constrained. His son Erich, who was a member of the left wing Socialist Workers' Party (SAP), was arrested in 1934 and sentenced to 10 years in prison, where he died in 1944, shortly before the end of his sentence. Sander's book Face of our Time was seized in 1936 and the photographic plates destroyed. Around 1942, during World War II, he left Cologne and moved to the small village of Kuchhausen, in the Westerwald region; this allowed him to save the most important part of his body of work. His Cologne studio was destroyed in a 1944 bombing raid, but tens of thousands of negatives, which he had left behind in a basement near his former apartment in the city, survived the war. 25,000 to 30,000 negatives in this basement were then destroyed in a 1946 fire. That same year, Sander began his postwar photographic documentation of the city. In 1953, Sander sold a portfolio of 408 photographs of Cologne, taken between 1920 and 1939, to the K√∂lnisches Stadtmuseum. These would be posthumously published in book format in 1988, under the title K√∂ln wie es war (Cologne as it was). In 1962, 80 photographs from the People of the 20th Century project were published in book format, under the name Deutschenspiegel. Menschen des 20. Jahrhunderts (German Mirror. People of the 20th Century). Sander died of a stroke on April 20, 1964. He was buried next to his son Erich in Cologne's Melaten Cemetery. Memorial plaque at his residence in Cologne Sander's grave, Melaten Cemetery, Cologne Legacy Sander's work includes landscape, nature, architecture, and street photography, but he is best known for his portraits, as exemplified by his series People of the 20th Century. In this series, he aims to show a cross- section of society during the Weimar Republic. The series is divided into seven sections: The Farmer, The Skilled Tradesman, Woman, Classes and Professions, The Artists, The City, and The Last People (homeless persons, veterans, etc.). By 1945, Sander's archive included over 40,000 images. In 2002, the August Sander Archive and scholar Susanne Lange published a seven- volume collection comprising 619 of Sander's photographs, August Sander: People of the 20th Century. In 2008, the Mercury crater Sander was named after him.\\"Mercury Features Receive New Names\\" by Paulette Cambell, press release Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University (28 April 2008) August Sander's estate is represented by Galerie Julian Sander, which was established in 2009 by his great grandson, in collaboration with Hauser & Wirth.

During periods of intense rainfall that would otherwise cause floods, the dam holds back the excess water, releasing it downstream at a controlled rate.

It consists of two movements, Andante and Prestissimo volando, and is the shortest of Scriabin's piano sonatas (a typical performance takes about 8 minutes). The sonata is generally considered to be the beginning of Scriabin's middle period due to the newly mystical sonorities and tonal ambiguity of the first movement.  Stylistic traits  The sonata is written in a post-Romantic style, similar to Scriabin's other works of the time, and the mood could be described as erotic. The first movement, expressive and calm, is monothematic (based on a single theme). The second movement, celebratory and climactic, starts attacca right after the Andante movement. A more Romantic idea is the use of cyclic form in restating the Andante‚Äôs main theme (dolcissimo) as the ecstatic climax of the Prestissimo volando movement (Focosamente, giubiloso). This outlay appears closely related to the last two movements from the 3rd sonata, also linked by an attacca, where the climax of the finale likewise restates the lyrical Andante theme of the third movement. Russian composers such as Tchaikovsky or Rachmaninoff often restated the lyric theme of the finale movement as climactic coda (for example in the piano concertos). Scriabin instead returns to the 'slow' movement‚Äôs theme, and this may have led to further experiments with a condensation of form in the one-single-movement 5th sonata where the climax (estatico) is again a restatement of the Languido theme (dolcissimo).  Background  Scriabin wrote a poem after composing this sonata that explains its meaning:http://forum.pianoworld.com/ubbthreads.php/topics/1970892/poem- scriabin-wrote-about-his-sonata-no-4.html In a light mist, transparent vapor Lost afar and yet distinct A star gleams softly. How beautiful! The bluish mystery Of her glow Beckons me, cradles me. O bring me to thee, far distant star! Bathe me in trembling rays Sweet light! Sharp desire, voluptuous and crazed yet sweet Endlessly with no other goal than longing I would desire But no! I vault in joyous leap Freely I take wing. Mad dance, godlike play! Intoxicating, shining one! It is toward thee, adored star My flight guides me. Mad dance, godlike play! Intoxicating, shining one! Toward thee, created freely for me To serve the end My flight of liberation! In this play Sheer caprice In moments I forget thee In the maelstrom that carries me I veer from they glimmering rays. In the intensity of desire Thou fadest O distant goal. But ever thou shinest As I forever desire thee! Thou expandest, Star! Now thou art a Sun Flamboyant Sun! Sun of Triumph!

Early career The band had a surprise Top 40 hit in Canada with their 1986 single \\"Spadina Bus\\". The song, from their debut album Streetniks, referred to the Toronto Transit Commission's Spadina Avenue bus in Toronto, Ontario. This song was also used as the theme to CITY-TV's show Speakers Corner.\\"A Snapshot of Citytv (1995) - Moses Znaimer\\". The Shuffle Demons released four more albums over the next seven years. They never scored another mainstream pop hit, although the video \\"Get Out of My House, Roach\\" received considerable airplay on MuchMusic. They retained a devoted following on the jazz scene, however. In 1987, they appeared on the children's television program Sharon, Lois & Bram's Elephant Show during season four. Later career and breakup The group played jazz, folk, world and rock festivals from Halifax to Vancouver and from Italy to Estonia from 1986 ‚Äì 1997, touring across Canada 15 times and through Europe 15 times. The Shuffle Demons featured a fusion of hard bop and rap combined with exotic costumes and a no- holds-barred performance style. Over the course of 15 European tours they were a hit at several Jazz festivals including the North Sea Jazz, Molde Jazz, London‚Äôs Outside In Jazz festival, the Edinburgh Jazz festival, the Sfinks festival, and Jazz a Vienne. Murley and Vivian left the band in 1989, and were replaced by Perry White and George Koller. Koller left in 1993, and was replaced by Mike Milligan. The following year, Wynston and White left the band, and were replaced by Eric St. Laurent and Greg Smith. Parker left in 1995. The band subsequently broke up in 1997. Reformation and international touring Underhill, Parker, White, Wynston, Koller and Milligan reformed the band in 2004, releasing a new greatest hits CD to coincide with their reunion tour. During the tour, the band also coordinated a successful attempt at a world record for the largest number of people playing saxophone simultaneously. The official Guinness Book of Records count is 900 participants, all playing the theme from Hockey Night in Canada. The Shuffle Demons continue to tour and performed at festivals in India, China and Europe in 2006 and in Thailand, South Korea and the USA in 2010 with great success. In the summer of 2011, the band performed at the Rochester, NY and Kingston, ON Jazz Festivals, as well as touring Australia and New Zealand. In 2012, \\"Clusterfunk\\", their first album of new material in seventeen years, was released. It was recorded and mixed between January and September of the previous year, at Canterbury Music and Inception Sound, both located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Physicist  Francis Perrin was born in Paris and attended √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in Paris. In 1928 he obtained a doctorate in mathematical sciences from the facult√© des sciences of Paris, based upon a thesis on Brownian motion and became a faculty member of Coll√®ge de France. In 1933, in connection with the neutrino, Francis Perrin estimated that \\"the mass must be null‚Äîor at least small compared to the mass of the electron\\". Subsequently he worked at the Coll√®ge de France on the fission of uranium. With Fr√©d√©ric Joliot and his group, he established in 1939 the possibility of nuclear chain reactions and nuclear energy production. He was professor at the Coll√®ge de France in the chair of Atomic and Molecular Physics from 1946 to 1972. He was the French high-commissioner for atomic energy from 1951 to 1970. In 1972, he discovered the Oklo natural reactor. Perrin actively supported the project for a European nuclear research centre, and was a signatory for France to the Convention establishing the CERN Provisional Council in February 1952 in Geneva. He was elected Vice-President of this Council, and remained French delegate on the CERN Council until 1972.  Nuclear High-Commissioner  Named High- Commissioner of the Commissariat √† l'√©nergie atomique (Atomic Energy Commission, CEA) in 1951‚Äîto replace Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie dismissed because he was opposed to military research‚Äî, Francis Perrin joined a lobby of about a dozen people, composed of politicians like Chaban-Delmas, Bourgu√®s-Maunoury and F√©lix Gaillard, of military officers, like the generals Ailleret, Gallois, and Cr√©pin, of technocrats like Pierre Guillaumat and Raoul Dautry or of scientists like Yves Rocard and Bertrand Goldschmidt, who revealed themselves to be extremely effective. This lobby imposed on successive governments of the Fourth Republic an intensive research program to permit France to deploy nuclear weapons without any real political control from outside France. Secret departments were made up within the CEA to implement this policy as of 1954. General Charles de Gaulle was informed of the work during his \\"Crossing of the Desert\\" (1953/58), in particular by Chaban-Delmas. When de Gaulle returned to power in 1958, the progress of the work was such that the date of the first nuclear test was already fixed at 1960. In 1986 he stated publicly that in 1949 Israeli scientists were invited to the Saclay Nuclear Research Centre, this cooperation leading to a joint effort including sharing of knowledge between French and Israeli scientists especially those with knowledge from the Manhattan Project.https://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/farr.htm  Personal life  Francis Perrin married Colette Auger, the sister of the physicist Pierre Auger. Francis Perrin was the president of Union des Ath√©es (Union of Atheists) after his resignation from the French atomic energy commission.

Commonly, however, it refers to the economic and cultural-social region centered on the Greater Dayton area . Middletown and Hamilton both fall under the economic and cultural-social influence of Cincinnati and thus are not commonly included in this sense. Institutions and enterprises in the Dayton area, such as Miami Valley Career Technology Center, Miami Valley Hospital, Miami Valley Council of the Boy Scouts of America and Miami Valley Storytellers illustrate local usage. Map of Miami Valley (1919) History During the mid-twentieth century, among the largest employers in the Valley were Procter and Gamble in Cincinnati, Champion Paper and Fiber in Hamilton, Armco in Middletown, and National Cash Register in Dayton.

Demographics As Greater Cincinnati grows northward through Butler County, it could conceivably merge with Greater Dayton by 2030, thereby virtually erasing any boundary between the two current Combined Statistical Areas (CSA). As a result, the US Census Bureau could begin reporting the Cincinnati and Dayton metropolitan areas as one by that time, though it would be up to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget to make the merger decision. The new Cincinnati‚ÄìDayton metropolitan area would be comparable in size to that of the Orlando‚ÄìDeltona‚ÄìDaytona Beach, FL CSA and place it within the top 20 most populous metros in the US, with a population of nearly 3.0 million.A combined Cincinnati-Dayton metropolitan comes closer to reality See also * Dayton metropolitan area  References  Category:Regions of Ohio Category:Valleys of Ohio Category:Landforms of Montgomery County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Greene County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Preble County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Clark County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Miami County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Darke County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Champaign County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Shelby County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Logan County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Butler County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Warren County, Ohio Category:Landforms of Wayne County, Indiana ","title":"Miami Valley"},{"id":"899440","text":"The Dartmouth Skiway is a ski area located about twenty minutes north of Dartmouth College in Lyme, New Hampshire.

The Lanchester equations are differential equations describing the time dependence of two armies' strengths A and B as a function of time, with the function depending only on A and B.Lanchester F.W., Mathematics in Warfare in The World of Mathematics, Vol. 4 (1956) Ed. Newman, J.R., Simon and Schuster, 2138‚Äì2157; anthologised from Aircraft in Warfare (1916) In 1916, during World War I, Frederick Lanchester and M. Osipov independently devised a series of differential equations to demonstrate the power relationships between opposing forces. Among these are what is known as Lanchester's Linear Law (for ancient combat) and Lanchester's Square Law (for modern combat with long-range weapons such as firearms). Zoologists have found chimpanzees intuitively follow Lanchester's Square Law before engaging another troop of chimpanzees. A group of chimpanzees will not attack another group unless the numerical advantage is at least a factor of 1.5.  Lanchester's linear law  For ancient combat, between phalanxes of soldiers with spears, say, one soldier could only ever fight exactly one other soldier at a time. If each soldier kills, and is killed by, exactly one other, then the number of soldiers remaining at the end of the battle is simply the difference between the larger army and the smaller, assuming identical weapons. The linear law also applies to unaimed fire into an enemy-occupied area. The rate of attrition depends on the density of the available targets in the target area as well as the number of weapons shooting. If two forces, occupying the same land area and using the same weapons, shoot randomly into the same target area, they will both suffer the same rate and number of casualties, until the smaller force is eventually eliminated: the greater probability of any one shot hitting the larger force is balanced by the greater number of shots directed at the smaller force.  Lanchester's square law  Lanchester's square law is also known as the N-square law. = Description = Idealized simulation of two forces damaging each other neglecting all other circumstances than the 1) Size of army 2) Rate of damaging. The picture illustrates the principle of Lanchester's square law. With firearms engaging each other directly with aimed shooting from a distance, they can attack multiple targets and can receive fire from multiple directions. The rate of attrition now depends only on the number of weapons shooting. Lanchester determined that the power of such a force is proportional not to the number of units it has, but to the square of the number of units. This is known as Lanchester's square law. More precisely, the law specifies the casualties a shooting force will inflict over a period of time, relative to those inflicted by the opposing force. In its basic form, the law is only useful to predict outcomes and casualties by attrition. It does not apply to whole armies, where tactical deployment means not all troops will be engaged all the time. It only works where each unit (soldier, ship, etc.) can kill only one equivalent unit at a time. For this reason, the law does not apply to machine guns, artillery, or nuclear weapons. The law requires an assumption that casualties accumulate over time: it does not work in situations in which opposing troops kill each other instantly, either by shooting simultaneously or by one side getting off the first shot and inflicting multiple casualties. Note that Lanchester's square law does not apply to technological force, only numerical force; so it requires an N-squared-fold increase in quality to compensate for an N-fold decrease in quantity. = Example equations = Suppose that two armies, Red and Blue are engaging each other in combat. Red is shooting a continuous stream of bullets at Blue. Meanwhile, Blue is shooting a continuous stream of bullets at Red. Let symbol A represent the number of soldiers in the Red force at the beginning of the battle. Each one has offensive firepower Œ±, which is the number of enemy soldiers it can incapacitate (e.g., kill or injure) per unit time. Likewise, Blue has B soldiers, each with offensive firepower Œ≤. Lanchester's square law calculates the number of soldiers lost on each side using the following pair of equations.Taylor JG. 1983. Lanchester Models of Warfare, volumes I & II. Operations Research Society of America. Here, dA/dt represents the rate at which the number of Red soldiers is changing at a particular instant. A negative value indicates the loss of soldiers. Similarly, dB/dt represents the rate of change of the number of Blue soldiers. :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}A}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}=-\\\\beta B :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}B}{\\\\mathrm{d}t}=-\\\\alpha A = Relation to the salvo combat model = Lanchester's equations are related to the more recent salvo combat model equations, with two main differences. First, Lanchester's original equations form a continuous time model, whereas the basic salvo equations form a discrete time model. In a gun battle, bullets or shells are typically fired in large quantities. Each round has a relatively low chance of hitting its target, and does a relatively small amount of damage. Therefore, Lanchester's equations model gunfire as a stream of firepower that continuously weakens the enemy force over time. By comparison, cruise missiles typically are fired in relatively small quantities. Each one has a high probability of hitting its target, and carries a relatively powerful warhead. Therefore, it makes more sense to model them as a discrete pulse (or salvo) of firepower in a discrete time model. Second, Lanchester's equations include only offensive firepower, whereas the salvo equations also include defensive firepower. Given their small size and large number, it is not practical to intercept bullets and shells in a gun battle. By comparison, cruise missiles can be intercepted (shot down) by surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft guns. So it is important to include such active defenses in a missile combat model.  Lanchester's law in use  Lanchester's laws have been used to model historical battles for research purposes. Examples include Pickett's Charge of Confederate infantry against Union infantry during the 1863 Battle of Gettysburg,Armstrong MJ, Sodergren SE, 2015, Refighting Pickett's Charge: mathematical modeling of the Civil War battlefield, Social Science Quarterly. and the 1940 Battle of Britain between the British and German air forces.MacKay N, Price C, 2011, Safety in Numbers: Ideas of concentration in Royal Air Force fighter defence from Lanchester to the Battle of Britain, History 96, 304‚Äì325. In modern warfare, to take into account that to some extent both linear and the square apply often, an exponent of 1.5 is used.Race to the Swift: Thoughts on Twenty-First Century Warfare by Richard E.

Fenton was born into a Lancashire merchant family. After graduating from London with an Arts degree, he became interested in painting and later developed a keen interest in the new technology of photography after seeing early examples of at The Great Exhibition in 1851. Within a year, he began exhibiting his own photographs. He became a leading British photographer and instrumental in founding the Photographic Society (later the Royal Photographic Society). In 1854, he was commissioned to document events occurring in Crimea, where he became one of a small group of photographers to produce images of the final stages of the Crimean War. Early life Fenton was born in Crimble Hall, Rochdale, Lancashire, on 28 March 1819. His grandfather was a wealthy cotton manufacturer and banker, whilst his father, John, was a banker and from 1832 a member of parliament. Fenton was the fourth of seven children by his father's first marriage. His father had 10 more children by his second wife. In 1840 Fenton graduated with a \\"first class\\" Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of London, having read English, mathematics, Greek and Latin. In 1841, he began to read law at University College, London, evidently sporadically as he did not qualify as a solicitor until 1847, partly because he had become interested in learning to be a painter. In Yorkshire in 1843 Fenton married Grace Elizabeth Maynard, presumably after his first sojourn in Paris (his passport was issued in 1842) where he may briefly have studied painting in the studio of Paul Delaroche. When he registered as a copyist in the Louvre in 1844 he named his teacher as the history and portrait painter Michel Martin Drolling, who taught at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, but Fenton's name does not appear in the school records. By 1847 Fenton had returned to London where he continued to study painting under the tutelage of the history painter Charles Lucy, who became his friend and with whom, starting in 1850, he served on the board of the North London School of Drawing and Modelling. In 1849, 1850 and 1851 he exhibited paintings in the annual exhibitions of the Royal Academy. Fenton visited the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park in London in 1851 and was impressed by the photography on display there. He then visited Paris to learn the waxed paper calotype process, most likely from Gustave Le Gray who had modified the methods employed by William Henry Fox Talbot, its inventor. By 1852 he had photographs exhibited in Britain, and travelled to Kiev, Moscow and St. Petersburg, and also photographed views and architecture around Britain. His published call for the setting up of a photographic society was answered in 1853 with the establishment of the Photographic Society, with Fenton as founder and first Secretary. It later became the Royal Photographic Society under the patronage of Prince Albert. Crimean War Marcus Sparling seated on Fenton's photographic van, Crimea, 1855. It is likely that in autumn 1854, as the Crimean War grabbed the attention of the British public, that some powerful friends and patrons ‚Äì among them Prince Albert and Duke of Newcastle, Secretary of State for War ‚Äì urged Fenton to go to the Crimea to record the happenings. The London print publisher Thomas Agnew & Sons became his commercial sponsor. The resulting photographs may have been intended to offset the general unpopularity of the war among the British people, and to counteract the occasionally critical reporting of correspondent William Howard Russell of The Times; the photographs were to be converted into woodblocks and published in the less critical Illustrated London News. He set off aboard HMS Hecla in February, landed at Balaklava on 8 March and remained there until 22 June. Fenton took Marcus Sparling as his photographic assistant, a servant known as William and a large horse-drawn van of equipment. Due to the size and cumbersome nature of his photographic equipment, Fenton was limited in his choice of motifs. Because the photographic material of his time needed long exposures, he was only able to produce pictures of stationary objects, mostly posed pictures; he avoided making pictures of dead, injured or mutilated soldiers. But he also photographed the landscape, including an area near to where the Charge of the Light Brigade ‚Äì made famous in Tennyson's poem ‚Äì took place. In letters home soldiers had called the original valley \\"The Valley of Death\\", and Tennyson's poem used the same phrase, so when in September 1855 Thomas Agnew put the picture on show, as one of a series of eleven collectively titled Panorama of the Plateau of Sebastopol in Eleven Parts in a London exhibition, he took the troops'‚Äîand Tennyson's‚Äîepithet, expanded it as The Valley of the Shadow of Death with its deliberate evocation of Psalm 23, and assigned it to the piece; it is not the location of the famous charge, which took place in a long, broad valley several miles to the south-east. Approach roads to Sevastopol, and the \\"valley of death\\" (centre) In 2007 film- maker Errol Morris went to Sevastopol to identify the site of this \\"first iconic photograph of war\\". He identified the small valley, shown on a later map as \\"The Valley of the Shadow of Death\\", as the place where Fenton had taken his photograph (see right). Two pictures were taken of this area, one with several cannonballs on the road, the other with an empty road. Hitherto opinions differed concerning which one was taken first but Morris spotted evidence that the photo without the cannonballs was taken first. He remains uncertain about why balls were moved onto the road in the second picture‚Äîperhaps, he notes, Fenton probably deliberately placed them there to enhance the image. The alternative is that soldiers were gathering up cannonballs for reuse and they threw down balls higher up the hill onto the road and ditch for collection later. Other art historians, such as Nigel Spivey of Cambridge University, identify the images as from the nearby Woronzoff Road. In June 1855 illustrator and war correspondent William Simpson produced a watercolour of the Woronzoff Road, but looking downhill, which has cannonballs similarly placed to those shown by Fenton; Simpson's publisher too used the title \\"The Valley of the Shadow of Death\\". This is the location accepted by the local tour guides. Despite summer high temperatures, breaking several ribs in a fall, suffering from cholera and also becoming depressed at the carnage he witnessed at Sevastopol, in all Fenton managed to make over 350 usable large format negatives. An exhibition of 312 prints was soon on show in London and at various places across the nation in the months that followed. Fenton also showed them to Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and also to Emperor Napoleon III in Paris. Nevertheless, sales were not as good as expected. Post Crimea Despite the lack of commercial success for his Crimean photographs, Fenton later travelled widely over Britain to record landscapes and still life images. However, as time moved on, photography became more accessible to the general public. Many people sought to profit from selling quick portraits to common people. It is likely that Fenton, from a wealthy background, disdained 'trade' photographers, but nevertheless still wanted to profit from the art by taking exclusive images and selling them at good prices. He thus fell into conflict with many of his peers who genuinely needed to make money from photography and were willing to 'cheapen their art' (as Fenton saw it), and also with the Photographic Society, who believed that no photographer should soil himself with the 'sin' of exploiting his talent commercially in any manner. Amongst Fenton's photographs from this period are the City of Westminster, including The Palace of Westminster nearing completion in 1857 ‚Äì almost certainly the earliest images of the building, and the only photographs showing the incomplete Clock Tower. In 1862 the organising committee for the International Exhibition in London announced its plans to place photography, not with the other fine arts as had been done in the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition only five years earlier, but in the section reserved for machinery, tools and instruments ‚Äì photography was considered a craft, for tradesmen. For Fenton and many of his colleagues, this was conclusive proof of photography's diminished status, and the pioneers drifted away. In 1863, Fenton sold his equipment and returned to the law as a barrister on the Northern Circuit. He died 8 August 1869 at his home in Potter's Bar, Middlesex after a week-long illness ‚Äì he was only 50 years old. His wife died in 1886. Their graves were destroyed in 1969 when the Potter's Bar church where they were buried was deconsecrated and demolished.

Leslie Clark Stevens IV (February 3, 1924 ‚Äì April 24, 1998) was an American producer, writer, and director. He created two television series for the ABC network, The Outer Limits (1963‚Äì1965) and Stoney Burke (1962‚Äì63), and Search (1972‚Äì73) for NBC. Stevens was the director of the horror film Incubus (1966), which stars William Shatner, and was the second film to use the Esperanto language. He wrote an early work of New Age philosophy, est: The Steersman Handbook (1970). Biography Stevens was born in Washington, D.C. His interest in science was sparked when he studied for the United States Naval Academy at the behest of his father, Leslie Clark Stevens III, an admiral in the United States Navy. But the Broadway theater intrigued him more than a military career, and he headed for New York as a fledgling writer. He sold his play The Mechanical Rat, to Orson Welles's Mercury Theatre and ran away from home to join the troupe before being returned home by truant officers. During World War II he served in the United States Army Air Forces becoming a Captain at the age of 20. He attended Yale's Drama Department following the war. His first play Bullfight starring Hurd Hatfield opened off Broadway in 1954. It was followed by The Champagne Complex the following year. His play The Lovers (1956), starring Joanne Woodward, was later filmed as The War Lord (1965). He wrote the Broadway comedy The Marriage-Go-Round (1956), which he adapted to the screen, and produced, as a starring vehicle for Susan Hayward, which was released in 1961. He wrote the screenplay for the film The Left Handed Gun (1958) directed by Arthur Penn and starring Paul Newman. Other films which Stevens produced, and directed and wrote included Hero's Island (1962) starring James Mason, and Private Property (1960) starring Corey Allen, Warren Oates and his then-wife Kate Manx. In television, he created the series Stoney Burke andThe Outer Limits, which he supervised as executive producer and wrote or directed a handful of episodes, through Daystar Productions. He also directed the feature film Incubus (1966). He was writer, director and executive producer of the pilot film and major episodes of It Takes a Thief and McCloud and wrote and produced installments for the series The Invisible Man and Buck Rogers in the 25th Century (which he co-developed with Glen A. Larson). He also produced the first-season Tony Franciosa episodes of The Name of the Game and the short-lived 1972‚Äì73 NBC science fiction series Search. Although only credited as supervising producer of \\"Saga of a Star-World\\" (the 1978 pilot episode of the Larson-produced Battlestar Galactica), director Alan J. Levi has alleged that \\"Stevens wrote the original script. Leslie was one of my best friends. I do know that Leslie had told me at one time way before he ever got into the script that he had this great idea for a script that he was going to take to Glen Larson and talk about.\\" Stevens also wrote for the revival show of The Outer Limits between 1996 and 1997. Stevens's contributions to the New Age Movement, and its relationships to The Outer Limits are discussed in the book Taoism for Dummies (John Wiley and Sons Canada, 2013). Stevens died from complications of an emergency angioplasty in 1998 in Los Angeles, California at the age of 74.

It was a battle in World War I as part of the Second Battle of the Marne, initially prompted by a German Spring Offensive. German and local actions at Ch√¢teau-Thierry recommenced on 31 May to 22 July 1918, against the AEF, an American Expeditionary Force, consisting of troops from both the United States Army and Marine Corps units. These units were the newest troops on the front in France and just barely out of training.Article: Chateau Thierry, Belleau Wood (Jun 3, 1918 - Jun 26, 1918) - The German Offensive. https://www.shmoop.com/wwi/chateau-thierry-belleau-wood.html The AEF counter-offensive combat action at Ch√¢teau-Thierry was relatively brief starting on 18 July 1918 and lasting for less than a week and was part of the allied effort to push back the recent German advance. American forces had linked up with their French allies at the Marne River on 3 June 1918 and had forced the Germans back across the river. This set the stage for the action at Ch√¢teau-Thierry and at Belleau Wood. However, the later action raged for another three weeks.Article: Chateau Thierry, Belleau Wood (Jun 3, 1918 - Jun 26, 1918) - The German Offensive. https://www.shmoop.com/wwi/chateau-thierry- belleau-wood.html  Background  Despite the revolution in Russia, fortune seemed to favor the Allies with the arrival of the Americans to France. However, these troops needed time to train before they could be combat effective. Recognizing the window of opportunity, General Ludendorff consolidated the manpower freed up from the Eastern Front to conduct Operation Michael in order to split the Allies' lines. The successes of the German stormtrooper infiltration tactics earned Germany approximately 40 miles of territory. But the offensive lost momentum when it surpassed its supply lines. In 1918, American General Pershing refused to hand over the new American divisions to either the British or French armies, insisting on keeping them together as one army. The exception was the regular Army Buffalo Soldiers who did not participate with the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) during World War I because they were \\"Black\\" or \\"Colored\\" (African American) led by mainly white officers. Their experienced colored non-commissioned officers(NCOs) were often provided to other segregated Black volunteer units for combat service ‚Äì such as the 317th Engineer Battalion. The soldiers of the 92nd and the 93rd infantry divisions were the first Americans to fight in France. The four regiments of the 93rd fought only under French command for the duration of the war. But in the face of the success of the German onslaught, Pershing relented and sent a portion of his army to assist the French in blocking the German advance in May 1918.  Prelude  Looking to defeat the British occupied in Flanders, Ludendorff sought to divert the Allies' French reserves away from the region. In his Operation Blucher, Ludendorff aimed some of his forces at the Chemin des Dames and took the French Sixth Army by surprise. Driving on, the Germans were soon at the Marne River, situated under 50 miles from Paris. With Marshal Ferdinand Foch unable to acquire British assistance, General Pershing's chief of operation, Colonel Fox Conner, recognized the gravity of the situation and ordered the 3rd Division to block them. The 3rd Division occupied the main bridge on the south bank of the Marne River that led in Chateau Thierry on 31 May 1918 as the French 10th Colonial Division rendezvoused with them from the north bank. The Americans positioned their machine guns to cover the French retreat, and had a unit led by Lt. John Bissell situated north of the second bridge. The French spent the night adding explosives to the bridges to destroy them. Early the following morning, 1 June, the Germans advanced into Chateau Thierry from the north, forcing the French to the main bridge, which they defended with the support of American machine-gun fire. The French succeeded in destroying the bridge as the Americans kept up their fire on the Germans. Lt. Bissell's group was still on the north side of the Marne. They worked their way back to the secondary bridge in-between American machine-gun fire and made it across, along with a group of Germans that were captured shortly afterwards. From the north of the Marne on 2 June, the Germans engaged in heavy artillery and sniper fire against the Allies. They made an attempt to take the remaining bridge but were forced to end the assault as the casualties rose. Counter-Offensive action On the morning of 18 July 1918, the combined French (some of them colonial) and American forces between Fontenoy and Ch√¢teau-Thierry launched a general counter-assault under the overall direction of Allied g√©n√©ralissime Ferdinand Foch against the German positions. This assault on a wide front was the first in over a year. The American army played a role fighting for the regions around Soissons and Ch√¢teau-Thierry, in collaboration with predominantly French forces. The allied forces had managed to keep their plans a secret, and their attack at 04:45 took the Germans by surprise when the troops went \\"Over the Top\\" without a preparatory artillery bombardment, but instead followed closely behind a rolling barrage which began with great synchronized precision. Eventually, the two opposing assaults (lines) inter-penetrated and individual American units exercised initiative and continued fighting despite being nominally behind enemy lines. Memorials Ch√¢teau-Thierry Monument, France After World War I, a memorial was built on Hill 204, 2 miles (3 km.) west of the town for which it is named. The Ch√¢teau-Thierry Monument, designed by Paul P. Cret of Philadelphia, was constructed by the American Battle Monuments Commission \\"to commemorate the sacrifices and achievements of American and French fighting men in the region, and the friendship and cooperation of French and American forces during World War I.\\" There is also a monument in front of the Bronx County Courthouse in New York City that was presented by the American Legion on 11 November 1940. The monument consists of the \\"Keystone from an arch of the old bridge at Chateau Thierry,\\" which the monument notes was \\"Gloriously and successfully defended by American troops.\\" The first Filipino to die in World War I was Private Tomas Mateo Claudio who served with the U.S. Army as part of the American Expeditionary Forces to Europe. He died in the Battle of Chateau Thierry in France on 29 June 1918.Source: Philippine Military Academy The Tomas Claudio Memorial College in Morong Rizal, Philippines, which was founded in 1950, was named in his honor. \\\\- In Literature A chapter in Ken Follett's 2010 historical novel Fall of Giants is devoted to The Battle of Ch√¢teau-Thierry, depicted alternately from the point of view of a German character and an American one. Follett's account emphasizes the fact that the Americans were freshly arrived and for most of them this was the first experience of combat - yet they stood well the \\"baptism of fire\\" and were able to confront the far more experienced German troops.

He made a name for himself as a Daguerrotype portrait artist in the United States. He maintained a mobile studio in a wagon that he called his \\"Daguerrotype Saloon.\\" Shew was born near Watertown, New York on 23 March 1820. He studied daguerrotype photography with Samuel F. B. Morse, as did his brothers Truman, Jacob, and Myron. All four of the Shew brothers worked for photographer John Plumbe, who opened studios in various cities; William Shew worked in Plumbe's Boston studio from 1841 to 1844 before setting up his own daguerreian case manufacturing business, William Shew and Company, and pursuing studio work in partnership with daguerreotypist Marsena Cannon. In this period, Shew was a member of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society. Shew's Saloon, 1851 In 1851, Shew followed his brother Jacob to California and set up a studio in San Francisco; he became well known for his portrait work. He was recruited by John Wesley Jones to take daguerreotypes of California for Jones's planned Great Pantoscope of California, the Rocky Mountains, Salt Lake City, Nebraska and Kansas. In 1851, he set up the \\"Moveable Daguerreotype Saloon\\" on Dupont Street, later moving it to a lot on Washington Street, opposite the Alta California newspaper office. He later occupied studios in more orthodox addresses along Clay, Montgomery, and Kearny streets. He is presumed the author of a July 1854 article \\"Photography\\" in The Pioneer, or, California Monthly Magazine in which he commented on the current state of photographic art and daguerreotype studios. When Japan's first diplomatic mission to the United States arrived in San Francisco in 1860, a young Yukichi Fukuzawa, then part of the embassy staff, sat for a photo in Shew's studio, in what would become one of the most famous photographs in early Japanese history as it also featured Shew's daughter Theodora, one of the first photographs of a Caucasian woman seen in Japan.Bakumatsu‚ÄîMeiji Furushashin Ch≈ç Aiz≈çhan, p. 21 Shew was active in local political and social groups in the 1850s and 1860s, holding the first San Francisco Free-Soil Convention at his rooms on the Plaza (8 October 1852); he served briefly on the Board of Education and hosted meetings of the Temperance Society. He was the most successful of the Shew brothers in photography; Truman died young (1848), Jacob suffered financial losses and committed suicide in 1879, and Myron worked in a variety of jobs including photography, manufacturing, and merchandising.

Timpanogos rises to an elevation of above sea level in the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. With of topographic prominence, Timpanogos is the 47th-most prominent mountain in the contiguous United States. The mountain towers about over Utah Valley, including the cities of Lehi, Provo, Orem, Pleasant Grove, American Fork, Lindon and others. The exposed portion of the mountain is made up entirely of limestone and dolomite from the Pennsylvanian period, and is about 300 million years old. Heavy winter snowfall is characteristic of this portion of the Wasatch Range, and avalanche activity is common in winter and spring. The mountain is also home to Timpanogos Cave National Monument, a series of decorated caves in the north end of the mountain that have guided ranger tours open daily to the public during the warmer months. The word Timpanogos comes from the Timpanogots tribe who lived in the surrounding valleys from AD 1400. The name translates as \\"rock\\" (tumpi-), and \\"water mouth\\" or \\"canyon\\" (panogos).  Glacial activity  Mount Timpanogos is visible from much of Utah County. Mount Timpanogos displays many examples of various glacial processes and the sculpting power of moving ice. Ice Age glaciers mantled the peak until relatively recently, and dramatically shaped the mountain into an Alpine tableau of knife-edge ridges and yawning, U-shaped amphitheaters. A remnant of these glaciers persists in the deeply recessed hanging valley below the main summit. Timpanogos Glacier is a rock-covered mass found on a long, north-facing slope, and usually has patches of snow the entire year. Although an above ground cirque glacier was present before the Dust Bowl Drought of the 1930s, no glacial ice is visible today. However, in 1994, a large crevasse opened up, revealing that there still is a glacier buried beneath the talus. Flowing water can occasionally be heard beneath the rocks. Emerald Lake, a small proglacial lake at the bottom of the cirque, often exhibits a blue color, indicating that the glacier is probably still moving, although perhaps too slowly to be noticeable. The locally unique ice is a relic of the region's formerly colder climate and has long been a major attraction to hikers and climbers on the mountain, who often slide down its permanent snowfield as a shorter descent route. Its precise classification remains the subject of spirited ongoing debate, whether \\"real\\" or not. Hiking Radial Engine from a 1955 B-25 crash site. The Mount Timpanogos peak is in the background. View of Mount Timpanogos from Timpooneke trail Mount Timpanogos is one of Utah's most popular hiking/climbing destinations and is climbed year round. Winter climbing requires advanced mountaineering ability. In spring, undercutting of deeply drifted snow by streams creates a hazard that has proven fatal on several occasions.Kelsey, Michael: Climbing and Exploring Utah's Mount Timpanogos; Provo, Utah, Kelsey Publishing, 1989, p. 203 Climbers can fall through the undermined snow or more into the icy stream underneath. Although it is a round-trip hike, with almost of elevation gain, Timpangos's summit is one of the most frequently visited in the Rocky Mountains. There are two main trails to the top: the first starts at Aspen Grove with a trailhead elevation of , and the second starts at the Timpooneke campground in American Fork Canyon at 7,370 feet (2,185 meters). The two trails are nearly the same length. Hikers on the trails climb through montane forest, subalpine and alpine zones. The hike is marked by waterfalls, conifers, rocky slopes and ridges, mountain goats, and a small lake, Emerald Lake, at 10,380 feet (3,164 m). A short diversion will lead hikers past a World War II bomber crash site. Other climbing routes exist on the mountain, but they are more technically demanding and require special skills and mountaineering gear. East side of Timpanogos as seen from the Alpine Loop. The east side of Timpanogos as seen from Silver Glance Lake. Prior to 1970, an annual Provo event called the \\"Timp Hike\\" sent thousands of people up the mountain's slopes. From 1911 to 1970 this one-day event (which took place generally on the third or fourth weekend in July) attracted thousands of people to the mountain. It also created the need for infrastructure, such as the stone shelter built in 1959 near Emerald Lake and a smaller metal shack on the summit (this was used as an observation deck complete with brass rods etched with notches aligned with various landmarks). The hike caused environmental damage to the mountain, and was finally canceled to help preserve the delicate mountain ecosystem. Despite the presence of the existing structures, the mountain was designated a wilderness area by the U.S. Congress in 1984.  Geology  The location of future Mount Timpanogos situated beneath a shallow sea on a map of the United States during the Carboniferous period The rock which forms the visible surface of Mount Timpanogos is primarily limestone composed of compacted sediment laid down onto an ancient seafloor over millions of years during the late Carboniferous Period (roughly 300 million years ago).Hintze, L.F., 1980, Geologic map of Utah: Utah Geological and Mineral Survey Older rock exists beneath the limestone on the surface. The limestone was subsequently lifted high above sea level and the mountain itself became prominent as the Western valley sunk due to basin and range faulting. The most contemporary features of the mountain were formed through recent glacial and water erosion.  Hazards  Since 1982 the Timpanogos Emergency Response Team (\\"TERT\\") has been established on the mountain on weekends to provide first aid, rescue and communication.Timpanogos Emergency Response Team website The Timpanogos Glacier is one of the major sources of injury or death to hikers on Timpanogos, particularly when some attempt to \\"glissade\\" (or slide rapidly) down the snowfield's surface with the assistance of a shovel or other device to save time descending. There have been many cases of injuries from buried rocks under the snow as well. There have been numerous life flight rescues on the mountain, often caused by this activity. The frequency of these rescues, however, greatly diminished once TERT was established. Folklore In the early 1900s Eugene Lusk \\"Timp\\" Roberts, a professor at Brigham Young University, initiated an annual hike and pageant intended to \\"sell Timpanogos to the world.\\" One way was to craft his take on native people's folklore. Some observers believe the ridgeline of Mount Timpanogos superficially resembles a sleeping woman. Roberts wrote his folk tale of the maiden Utahna and her sacrifice to her gods with this as the launch point, with one version the basis for a ballet.

He supervised warship construction at Navy Point in Sackets Harbor, New York, and later had a full career in the Navy. Biography Woolsey was born near Plattsburgh, New York. He was a descendant of George (Joris) Woolsey, one of the earliest settlers of New Amsterdam, and Thomas Cornell,Cornell, Thomas Clapp. Adam and Anne Mott: their ancestors and their descendants. A.V. Haight, 1890 Retrieved November 10, 2013 as well as the Livingston, Schuyler, and Van Rensselaer old New York families. After studying law for a time, Woolsey entered the Navy as a midshipman on April 9, 1800. His first assignment was the frigate , on which he made a cruise to the West Indies in 1800 and 1801. He served briefly in the First Barbary War just before its end in 1805. In 1807, the newly promoted Woolsey received orders to Washington, D.C., where he developed a code of signals for the Navy. From there, he was ordered to the shores of Lake Ontario in 1808 to supervise the construction of . Given the buildup of tensions with Great Britain, the US Navy established a shipyard for warships and rapidly built eleven ships at the facility, employing 3,000 men at the yard, many recruited from New York City. At the same time, Woolsey received a concurrent assignment as the commanding officer of the shore facilities located there. When the United States went to war with Great Britain in 1812, he was still in command of Oneida and the shore station at Sackett's Harbor. On July 19, 1812, a British squadron of five ships appeared. Woolsey attempted to escape to open water with Oneida, but the enemy squadron sealed off that avenue. Instead, he returned to Sackett's Harbor, landed half his battery, and repelled the British convincingly after a sharp two-hour exchange. Early in October, Commodore Isaac Chauncey arrived on the scene and assumed overall command of American naval activities on the Great Lakes. Woolsey stayed on as second in command and remained commanding officer of Oneida. During the fall of 1812, Woolsey concentrated upon the construction, purchase, and outfitting of additional war vessels. Throughout the entire war, a construction race caused naval dominance on Lake Ontario to alternate between the British and Americans. Woolsey enabled America to grab the lead in the fall of 1812 by acquiring eight schooners to augment Oneida and the three-gun . On November 8, he commanded Oneida when the 19-gun warship and four of the newly acquired schooners encountered ‚Äîa large, 24-gun, ship-rigged sloop-of-war off Kingston and chased her into that port. Later, they followed her in and subjected her to bombardment. In May 1813, Woolsey commanded Oneida as her guns supported the capture of York (Toronto) and the assault on Fort GeorgeMaclay, Edward Stanton and Roy Campbell Smith. A History of the United States Navy, from 1775 to 1893, p472. D.Appleton and Co, 1893 (Digitized by University of Michigan, March 13, 2006). Woolsey was promoted to master commandant in July 1813 and, by August, was in the new schooner . Late in September 1813, he commanded his ship in a running fight between the American lake flotilla and Commodore James Lucas Yeo's British force. That series of skirmishes resulted in another period of American dominance of Lake Ontario. On 5 October, his ship participated in the capture of the enemy cutter HMS Drummond and the sloops- of-war , HMS Mary Ann, and HMS Lady Gore off False Duck Island. In May 1814, after a winter of feverish preparation for the third summer of campaigning, Woolsey went to the supply depot at Oswego to pick up guns, cables, and other supplies needed at Sackett's Harbor. While he was there, the British squadron appeared off Oswego. By spreading false intelligence about his destination, Woolsey was able to take advantage of a dark night and make good his escape. The British learned of their mistake and sought to overtake him, which they did at Sandy Creek. Woolsey had prepared an ambush in concert with Maj. Daniel Appling and his 150-man contingent of the United States Rifle Regiment. The British landing force was soundly trounced by Appling's riflemen and 200 Indian allies. Woolsey, in turn, brought his guns to bear on the squadron itself. The Americans defeated the enemy convincingly, killing 10, wounding 52, and capturing the rest. Woolsey proceeded to Sackett's Harbor with his ordnance and supplies. Soon thereafter, he assumed command of the new brig, , and retained that command until the end of the war in 1815. Marriage and family After the war, Master Commandant Woolsey remained in command of the naval station at Sacketts Harbor. In 1816, he was promoted to captain and likely married Susan C. Treadwell of Long Island, New York that year. Their first son Melancthon Brooks Woolsey was born August 11, 1817 in Sacketts Harbor.US Dept of the Navy, Naval Historical Center.

He took it on a West Indies cruise until June 1827. Late in 1827, he took command of the navy yard at Pensacola, Florida and moved his family there. He held the position until 1831. Between 1832 and 1834, Woolsey served as Commodore in command of the Brazilian Station. His last active duty took him to the Chesapeake Bay, where he supervised surveys from 1836 until his health began to decline in 1837.

The D3DX library was introduced in Direct3D 7, and subsequently was improved in Direct3D 9. It provides classes for common calculations on vectors, matrices and colors, calculating look-at and projection matrices, spline interpolations, and several more complicated tasks, such as compiling or assembling shaders used for 3D graphic programming, compressed skeletal animation storage and matrix stacks. There are several functions that provide complex operations over 3D meshes like tangent-space computation, mesh simplification, precomputed radiance transfer, optimizing for vertex cache friendliness and strip reordering, and generators for 3D text meshes. 2D features include classes for drawing screen-space lines, text and sprite based particle systems. Spatial functions include various intersection routines, conversion from/to barycentric coordinates and bounding box and sphere generators. The D3DX library contains pre-written routines for doing things common to most 2D/3D applications, such as games. Since the Direct3D API is relatively low-level, using the D3DX library is usually much simpler. In 2012, Microsoft announced that D3DX would be deprecated in the Windows 8 SDK, along with other development frameworks such as XNA. Shader effects, texture management, geometry optimizations and mesh models are available as separate sources published through GitHub. The mathematical constructs of D3DX, like vectors and matrices, would be consolidated with XNAMath into a DirectXMath and spherical harmonics math is provided as separate source. Interfaces The D3DX library follows the COM object oriented programming model. Functionality is accessed using C++-like interfaces. =ID3DXEffect= The ID3DXEffect interface is used for compiling and binding FX shaders (.fx). It supports automatic mapping of named shader parameters to hardware constant registers, parameter pools, mapping textures to available samplers, specifying 'techniques' and modifying render states. =ID3DXFont= The ID3DXFont interface can be used to draw 2D text. See also D3DXCreateText that creates 3D meshes of text. =ID3DXLine= The ID3DXLine interface can be used for drawing anti-aliased screen-space lines with pattern. =ID3DXMesh= The ID3DXMesh interface is used for storage of meshes and mesh optimization for vertex cache friendliness and strip reordering. Some functions in D3DX operate on this interface. An example is D3DXComputeTangentFrame for creating a tangent-space frame for effects like normal and parallax mapping. A descendant of this class is ID3DXPMesh that can do geometry simplification. =ID3DXPRTEngine= It is used for Precomputed Radiance Transfer - a technique similar to spherical harmonics lighting that is used for precomputed global illumination and soft ambient lighting. =ID3DXSprite= The ID3DXSprite interface is a C++ class used for drawing a 2D image to the screen known as a sprite in computer graphics. In DirectX 7 this was typically done using the DirectDraw API, which is deprecated. The programmer typically needs only to call the ID3DXSprite object's Begin() method to set up the render state and world transform for 2D drawing, call the Draw() method to add textures to the list to be drawn and finally call the End() method to draw the images to the screen and restore the original graphics state. A common criticism of the D3DXSprite was that it was slow but this issue has been addressed as of Direct3D 9. Functions =D3DXComputeTangentFrame= It computes the tangent-space frame of a mesh that is used for effects like normal/bump mapping, parallax mapping and anisotropic lighting models. It handles vertices at tangent-space discontinuities by making duplicates, thus solving the hairy ball problem. It doesn't handle reversed UV winding of faces so models with mirrored texture mapping may run into lighting troubles because of this. Direct3D10 The D3DX10 utility library for Direct3D 10 was similar to the D3DX for Direct3D 9 in functionality, and included the same D3DXMath library and Block Compression (BC1-BC5) software codecs. The key differences were that Effects for Direct3D 10 was made an OS component, the HLSL compiler was moved to a distinct D3DCompile DLL, and the texture image load & save code utilized the Windows Imaging Component. As a consequence of the shift to using WIC, D3DX10 did not support Truevision TGA, RGBE image format, or Portable PixMap file formats which were supported by D3DX. D3DX10 also did not include the UVAtlas isochart texture atlasing or Precomputed Radiance Transfer APIs. All versions of D3DX10 are deprecated per Microsoft Docs. Direct3D11 The D3DX11 utility library for Direct3D 11 was a trimmed down version of D3DX10. It included texture image load & save code using WIC, and the Block Compression (BC1-BC7) software codecs, but little else. All versions of D3DX11 are deprecated per Microsoft Docs. Most functionality from D3DX9, D3DX10, and D3DX11 has been moved to open source projects for Direct3D 11 or later: DirectXMath, DirectX Tool Kit, DirectXTex, DirectXMesh, and UVAtlas. There are also open source versions of DXUT and the Effects (FX11) runtime available. Direct3D12 There is no DLL-based D3DX12 utility library. There is, however, a D3DX12 utility header (all inline C++ code) for some basic helpers for Direct3D 12 documented on Microsoft Docs and is published on GitHub. It does not include functionality such as math, sprites, font rendering, 3D shapes, meshes, or texture loading. There is a DirectX Tool Kit for Direct3D 12 which provides the missing functionality.

Created in the 1950s and early 1960s by teenage Cajuns, it combines New Orleans-style rhythm and blues, country and western, and traditional French Louisiana musical influences. Although a fairly obscure genre, swamp pop maintains a large audience in its south Louisiana and southeast Texas homeland, and it has acquired a small but passionate cult following in the United Kingdom, Northern Europe, and Japan.Shane K. Bernard, Swamp Pop: Cajun and Creole Rhythm and Blues (Jackson, Miss.: University Press of Mississippi, 1996), pp. 5-6, 44.  Characteristics  Swamp pop musician Jivin' Gene, c. 1959 The swamp pop sound is typified by highly emotional, lovelorn lyrics, tripleting honky-tonk pianos, undulating bass lines, bellowing horn sections, and a strong rhythm and blues backbeat. It is exemplified by slow ballads like Cookie and the Cupcakes' \\"Mathilda\\" (recorded 1958), considered by many fans as the unofficial swamp pop \\"anthem\\". But the genre has also produced many upbeat compositions, such as Bobby Charles' \\"Later Alligator\\" (1955), popularly covered by Bill Haley & His Comets.Bernard, Swamp Pop, pp. 5‚Äì6, 25. During the genre's heyday (1958‚Äì1964), several swamp pop songs appeared on national U.S. record charts. These included Jimmy Clanton's \\"Just A Dream\\" (1958), Warren Storm's \\"Prisoner's Song\\" (1958), Phil Phillips' \\"Sea Of Love\\" (1959), Rod Bernard's \\"This Should Go On Forever\\" (1959), Joe Barry's \\"I'm A Fool To Care\\" (1960), and Dale and Grace's \\"I'm Leaving It Up To You\\" (1963).John Broven, South to Louisiana: Music of the Cajun Bayous (Gretna, La.: Pelican, 1983), pp. 179‚Äì183. In swamp pop's south Louisiana-southeast Texas birthplace, fans regarded many songs that never became national hits as classics. These include Johnnie Allan's \\"Lonely Days, Lonely Nights\\" (1958), Buck Rogers' \\"Crazy Baby\\" (1959), Randy and the Rockets' \\"Let's Do the Cajun Twist\\" (1962), T. K. Hulin's \\"I'm Not a Fool Anymore\\" (1963), and Clint West's \\"Big Blue Diamond\\" (1965), among numerous othersBernard, Swamp Pop, p. 6..  Roots and early history  The musicians who went on to birth Swamp pop listened to (and often performed) traditional Cajun music and black Creole (zydeco) music as children, as well as popular country and western (hillbilly) songs by musicians like Bob Wills, Moon Mullican, and Hank Williams. However, like other American youth in the mid-1950s, they discovered the alluring new sounds of rock and roll and rhythm and blues artists like Elvis Presley and Fats Domino. As a result, these teenaged Cajuns and black Creoles shifted away from Louisiana French folk compositions like \\"Jolie Blonde\\", \\"Allons a Lafayette\\", and \\"Les flammes d'enfer\\" in favor of singing rock and roll and rhythm and blues compositions in English. At the same time, they switched from folk instruments like the accordion, fiddle, and iron triangle to modern ones such as the electric guitar and bass, upright piano, saxophone, and drumming trap set.Bernard, Swamp Pop, pp. 18‚Äì19. Swamp pop duo Dale & Grace, c. 1963 By the late 1950s, swamp pop musicians had developed their own distinct sound and repertoires. They performed to receptive crowds in local dancehalls like the Southern Club in Opelousas, Landry's Palladium in Lafayette, the OST Club in Rayne, and the Green Lantern in Lawtell. In addition, they released recordings on local record labels, such as Floyd Soileau's Jin label of Ville Platte, Eddie Shuler's Goldband of Lake Charles, Carol Rachou's La Louisianne of Lafayette, Huey Meaux's Crazy Cajun label of Houston, and a number of labels owned by J. D. Miller of Crowley, Louisiana (who also recorded swamp pop tunes for larger national labels, such as Ernie Young's Excello Records label of Nashville).Bernard, Swamp Pop, pp. 104‚Äì108. Swamp pop musicians often adopted Anglo-American stage names that masked their Cajun surnames. John Allen Guillot, for example, became Johnnie Allan, Robert Charles Guidry became Bobby Charles, Joe Barrios became Joe Barry, Elwood Dugas became Bobby Page, and Terry Gene DeRouen became Gene Terry. Some of these musicians changed their names because they were ashamed of their rural French heritage‚Äîa feeling shared at the time by a segment of the Cajun population. But economics motivated most swamp pop musicians: They wanted to sell records not only in southern Louisiana and southeast Texas, but beyond, where the pronunciation of ethnic surnames like Guillot, Barrios, and DeRouen eluded record promoters, disc jockeys, and consumers.Bernard, Swamp Pop, pp. 60‚Äì62. Despite its obvious rock and roll and rhythm & blues influences, swamp pop was not devoid of folk characteristics. For example, Bobby Page and the Riff Raffs recorded \\"Hippy- Ti-Yo\\", a bilingual rock and roll version of the traditional Cajun French song \\"Hip et Taiaut\\" and Rod Bernard did the same with \\"Allons danser Colinda\\", another important folk composition. Joe Barry re-recorded his swamp pop hit \\"I'm A Fool To Care\\" in French under the title \\"Je suis b√™te pour t'aimer\\". And Randy and the Rockets issued \\"Let's Do The Cajun Twist\\", an English remake of the Cajun French favorite \\"Allons a Lafayette\\".Bernard, Swamp Pop, pp. 84‚Äì86.  Legacy  Over twenty swamp pop songs have appeared in the Billboard Hot 100 since the genre's origin in the mid-1950s. Five of these broke into the Top 10, and three reached number one. While swamp pop drew heavily on New Orleans rhythm and blues, it reciprocated by making a detectable impact on songs like Lloyd Price's \\"Just Because\\", Earl King's \\"Those Lonely Lonely Nights\\", Little Richard's \\"Can't Believe You Want To Leave\\" and \\"Send Me Some Lovin, and Clarence \\"Frogman\\" Henry's \\"(I Don't Know Why) But I Do\\" and \\"On Bended Knee\\" (both Bobby Charles compositions). Swamp pop also left its imprint on the related but distinct genre known as \\"swamp blues\\", including Slim Harpo's classic \\"Rainin' in My Heart\\". Jerry Lee Lewis recorded many swamp blues/swamp pop type songs most notably the Cookie and the Cupcakes hit \\"Mathilda\\", Harpo's \\"Rainin' in my heart\\" and a version of the blues standard \\"Got you on my mind\\" that is probably based on the Cookie interpretation. Swamp pop's impact on popular music is heard in the Rolling Stones' cover of Barbara Lynn's \\"You'll Lose a Good Thing\\" and \\"Oh Baby (We Got A Good Thing Goin')\\", the Honeydrippers' rendition of Phil Phillips' \\"Sea of Love\\" , Elvis Presley's remake of Johnny Ace's \\"Pledging My Love\\", and even The Beatles' swamp-inspired \\"Oh! Darling\\". Swamp pop influenced Tex-Mex music, particularly the recordings of Freddy Fender's early swampy songs like \\"Before The Next Teardrop Falls\\" and \\"Wasted Days and Wasted Nights\\" in 1975. (South Louisiana and southeast Texas audiences generally consider Fender a full-fledged swamp pop musician.)Bernard, Swamp Pop, pp. 64-65, 106-07. Although swamp pop began a slow decline with the onslaught of the mid-'60s British Invasion, the genre continues to draw devoted fans to south Louisiana and southeast Texas festivals and nightclubs. Some younger non-swamp musicians, such as Cajun artist Zachary Richard and rockers Marc Broussard and C. C. Adcock, have acknowledged a strong swamp pop influence. (Adcock co-produced a 2009 documentary, Promised Land: A Swamp Pop Journey, on his swamp pop group Lil' Band o' Gold, which featured swamp pop pioneer Warren Storm on drums and guest vocals by Tommy McLain).  Swamp rock  \\"Swamp rock\\" is a distinct genre that drew more on 1960s rock than on the 1950s rhythm and blues sound that helped to define swamp pop.Bernard, Swamp Pop, p. 106. It is epitomized by the work of such artists as Creedence Clearwater Revival, John Fogerty, Dale Hawkins, Ronnie Hawkins, Little Feat, The Band, Leon Russell, Delaney & Bonnie, and Tony Joe White.L.

In the backstory of the programme, he was the founder of Time Lord society on the planet Gallifrey and its first leader, as Lord High President.Parkin, Lance & Pearson, Lars (2012). A History: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe (3rd Edition), p. 697. Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. . After the original television series ended in 1989, Rassilon's character and history were developed in books and other media. Character history Within the universe of the television series, there are many contradictory legends about Rassilon. It is known that he developed the technology for time travel that made his people lords of time in the distant past together with his colleague Omega. Omega, a stellar engineer, was presumed killed by the supernova that created the black hole later known as the Eye of Harmony, and Rassilon harnessed the nucleus of the black hole to provide the energy that powers time travel. Rassilon then took control of Gallifrey and became the first and, to date, only Lord High President, his successors taking the title Lord President.Parkin, Lance & Pearson, Lars (2012). A History: An Unauthorised History of the Doctor Who Universe (3rd Edition), p. 697. Mad Norwegian Press, Des Moines. . The official history is that he was a benevolent ruler who ruled his people wisely. However, there are other accounts which paint Rassilon as a cruel dictator,Doctor Who ‚Äì The Five Doctors tx BBC1 25 November 1983 opportunistic and ambitious who seized power in the wake of his friend's death (for which some suggest he may have been deliberately responsible), and ready to take drastic measures to protect his people, nearly destroying all of time once. Rassilon's contributions to Time Lord culture and society were immense, and his name both reverberates and is honoured throughout Time Lord history. The Rassilon Imprimatur is the name given to the symbiotic nucleus of Time Lords' cell structures that allows them to withstand the molecular stresses of time travel and grants them a link to their TARDIS time machines. Several other Time Lord artifacts named after him have a technological function, in addition to their ceremonial roles: * The Sash of Rassilon allows the wearer to be in close proximity to the singularity that is the Eye of Harmony, providing protection from the Eye's gravitational and energy forces, and preventing the wearer from being drawn across the event horizon of the captured black hole. Use of the Sash in this way is cited as having a regenerative effect upon the wearer. * The Crown of Rassilon (or matrix circlet) gives full access to the Matrix, providing a direct mental link to the computer network that serves as the repository of all Time Lord knowledge and their personality prints, captured at death in the Amplified Panatropic Computer (A.P.C net) that is a subsidiary part of the Matrix itself. * The Key of Rassilon allows physical access to the Matrix, for maintenance of this 'micro-universe' repository of Time Lord knowledge. Confusingly, this is a separate artifact from the so-called Great Key of Rassilon, that provides direct tapping of the near limitless energies of the Eye of Harmony, and is cited as a vital component part of the demat gun (a weapon of mass destruction); it is also hinted that this 'key' is essential to accessing the other relative dimensions in time, in The Invasion of Time. * The Rod of Rassilon (referred to as \\"the Great Key\\" in the Book of the Old Time in The Deadly Assassin) allows the user to physically access the containment/control apparatus of the Eye of Harmony itself, that was historically hidden beneath the Panopticon central dais. * The Coronet of Rassilon gives the user the ability to amplify and to project their own will to dominate others, but its effects can be defeated, if recognised, by a co- ordinated resistance of many minds. * The Harp of Rassilon is a musical key that unlocks a secret room within the High Council chambers. This hidden compartment held the controls for the Time Scoop‚Äîa rudimentary \\"time corridor\\" technology, used presumably before time travel was perfected by Rassilon after the installation of the Eye of Harmony on Gallifrey. * The Ring of Rassilon ostensibly grants the wearer immortality, but seemingly is keyed to Rassilon's DNA only, so that any other seizing the artifact is locked in perpetual imprisonment as a stone carving relief on Rassilon's bier. * The Black Scrolls of Rassilon are parchment documents containing forbidden knowledge from the Dark Time, not recorded in the Matrix. The seal of Rassilon. Rassilon is also given credit, variously, for TARDIS technology; the living metal and super- weapon validium; and the defensive Quantum Force Field and Transduction Barriers that protected Gallifrey. How much of this is true and how much of it is propaganda is not certain. However, it is established that a TARDIS derives its power primarily from the Eye of Harmony. The Tomb or Tower of Rassilon, also known as the Dark Tower, stands in the middle of the Death Zone‚Äîa blasted, barren plain‚Äîon Gallifrey. The Death Zone was used, in a period of Gallifrey's history known as the Dark Time, as an arena that pitted warriors of various alien species and times (captured by the use of a device called the Time Scoop) against each other in gladiatorial games, although the Second Doctor tells the Brigadier that Rassilon put a stop to the games (The Five Doctors, 1983). It was rumoured that Rassilon, who lived during this time, had been deposed by Time Lords rebelling against his rule. It was also claimed Rassilon had discovered the secret of immortality and was still alive in the Tower, sleeping. The quest to reach Rassilon's tomb and the secret, blocked by a series of deadly obstacles, is referred to as \\"The Game of Rassilon\\". =The Five Doctors= Richard Mathews as Rassilon in \\"The Five Doctors\\" In The Five Doctors, Lord President Borusa wants Rassilon's secret for himself, describing Rassilon's immortality as \\"perpetual bodily regeneration\\". Borusa uses the Time Scoop to transport the Doctor in the majority of his incarnations (along with various companions) to the Death Zone, using them to clear the way to the Tower. The First Doctor deduced from the riddle \\"This is the Game of Rassilon; to lose is to win and he who wins shall lose\\" that the Game was a trap to get rid of Time Lords who might be a danger to their race. Borusa is granted immortality by being transformed into a living statue. Rassilon subsequently returned the first three Doctors to their proper places in time and space and freed the Fourth Doctor from the time eddy in which he had been trapped. In that story, Rassilon (played by Richard Mathews) appears as a disembodied image floating above his own sepulchre, but the nature of this apparition is not explained. People with major involvement in the Doctor Who television series, Doctor Who spin off media and in Doctor Who Magazine, when asked in The Essential Doctor Who magazine, were divided over whether the image of Rassilon seen in The Five Doctors is actually alive or an artificial intelligence or if he had ever died prior to The Five Doctors. According to DWM editor Tom Spilsbury, it hadn't occurred to him before that he was anything other than being alive, and that \\"it might come down to semantics over what being alive means\\". Doctor Who scriptwriter Gareth Roberts believed that Rassilon is dead and the face that appears is \\"a clever AI\\". Head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies believed that Rassilon is \\"clearly alive\\", with his big face in the story being \\"A projection from the Matrix. A mental life extending beyond the body's death.\\" Spin-off writer George Mann believed that Rassilon was dead, but the Time Lords had figured out a way of \\"resurrecting dead people in extreme circumstances\\", doing \\"something horrible and timey wimey\\". Spin-off writer and DWM columnist Jacqueline Rayner described his condition as \\"a permanent sleep which is pretty much indistinguishable from death\\", and that \\"He's immortal, but he has no awareness,\\" and when the trap inside the Tomb of Rassilon is triggered, \\"he becomes semi-aware so he can oversee or judge what's going on, before going back into his eternal sleep again\\". DWM deputy editor Peter Ware believed that Rassilon is dead by the time of The Five Doctors, and his dead mind is speaking from the Matrix to the Doctors and Borusa. He mentions the line from the episode \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015)‚Äî\\"Rassilon the resurrected\\", as further proof that he had died. Doctor Who scriptwriter Mark Gatiss quipped that Rassilon is \\"biding his time until he regenerates into [actor] Daniel Craig\\". Head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat, who also wrote \\"Hell Bent\\", understood that Rassilon was \\"alive, but in 'eternal sleep'\\", having got up from his eternal sleep to participate in the Time War, \\"And got killed. And resurrected. Because that happened a lot in the Time War.\\" According to scriptwriter Terrance Dicks, who wrote The Five Doctors, Rassilon has \\"gone to a higher plane where he's a benevolent being who can, if he feels it's a big enough crisis, intervene\\". = Revived series = Rassilon (portrayed by Timothy Dalton) appears as the villainous mastermind of \\"The End of Time\\", the two-part finale of the series' 2009 Specials. Though referred to by name by the Tenth Doctor, Dalton is credited as the 'Narrator / Lord President' with Russell T Davies confirming his name in a Doctor Who Confidential episode. During the Time War, Rassilon became ruthless and determined to avoid death at any cost, motivating his formulating of the \\"Final Sanction\\" which would destroy all creation while elevating himself and the Time Lords into beings of pure consciousness. The Doctor in his War Doctor incarnation learned of this and decided to end the war using the Gallifreyan superweapon called \\"the Moment\\". With the prophecy deciphered that the Doctor would destroy Gallifrey to end the Time War, and told he would die on that day, Rassilon refuses to accept his fate and killed his advisor for speaking out against his plans. Anticipating Gallifrey's complete annihilation in \\"The End of Time\\" (2009‚Äì10), Rassilon attempted to break the planet out of the Time Lock implemented in the latter phases of the Time War to block creative attacks involving time travel, placing a drumbeat in the mind of the Master when he was a child. As a result, Rassilon is the cause of the Master's insanity and indirectly responsible for the Time Lord's actions. When the Master turned all of humanity into copies of himself, the now-amplified drum beat acts as a signal that, with a White Point Star diamond, allows Rassilon and Gallifrey to escape the Time Lock. Destroying the White Point Star, the Doctor severs the link between Gallifrey and Earth. Rassilon's attempts to kill the Doctor in revenge are blocked by the Master, vengeful owing to his manipulation by Rassilon, who then follows him and the other Time Lords into the last day of the Time War.Doctor Who. \\"The End of Time, Part 2\\", original airdate 1/1/2010. In \\"The Day of the Doctor\\" (2013), the Time Lords are revealed not to have been destroyed at the Time War's conclusion; all incarnations of the Doctor united and used their TARDISes to send Gallifrey into a pocket dimension.Doctor Who. \\"The Day of the Doctor\\", original airdate 23/11/2013. In \\"Hell Bent\\" (2015), the Twelfth Doctor arrives on Gallifrey and learns that a regenerated Rassilon was responsible for his imprisonment and torture for four and a half billion years, as well as indirectly responsible for the death of his companion, Clara. On arriving on Gallifrey, he leads a military revolt against Rassilon, deposes him, and sends him into exile. Timothy Dalton was asked to reprise the role for the episode, but was replaced by Donald Sumpter as a regenerated Rassilon when he became unavailable for filming. Other appearances Rassilon's rise to power was explored in the Virgin New Adventures novel Cat's Cradle: Time's Crucible. It is revealed in the novel that Ancient Gallifrey was ruled by the Pythia, who controlled the population through prophecies and superstition. Rassilon, whose followers believed in science and rationality, led a revolution against the Pythia, eventually causing her to kill herself, and send her followers to the planet Karn. However, before she died she cursed Rassilon and all future Time Lords to sterility. Rassilon's unborn daughter was one of the deaths. In later New Adventures we are introduced to the concept of the genetic Looms, from which new Time Lords were created. This leads to Rassilon becoming part of a ruling triumvirate with Omega and a mysterious figure called the Other. Together they rebuilt Gallifrey and re- ordered the universe along rational and scientific lines, outlawing superstition and banishing magic. The later novel Lungbarrow shows Rassilon becoming increasingly tyrannical and violently crushing resistance to his reforms, which ultimately leads to the Other breaking with him and throwing himself into the genetic looms, leading to his later apparent reincarnation as the Doctor. In the last three stories of Alan Moore's run on Doctor Who Monthly we see the first Time War in Time Lord history, where the Order of the Black Sun make a pre-emptive strike on the Gallifreyans' experiments with time travel. In the first story, \\"Star Death\\" (Doctor Who Magazine #47), we see Rassilon gaining the equipment to control time travel thanks to the failed initial attack. In the DWM comic strips, Rassilon is shown existing in the Matrix as part of a council of \\"Higher Evolutionaries\\" acting as the guardians of Time (The Tides of Time Part 2, DWM #62, among others). In the Doctor Who audio plays produced by Big Finish Productions, Rassilon is voiced by Don Warrington. He is shown to continue to exist in the Matrix. According to audio plays, Rassilon developed the power of regeneration from the Vampires, who were apparently peaceful until the Time Lords attacked them. He transforms the Doctor into his assassin‚Äîa being of pure anti-time that identifies itself as Zagreus‚Äîto defeat the Divergents, a race who would have evolved to surpass the Time Lords if reality had progressed as it should have, only for his plans to fail when the Doctor proclaims that he does not kill and Zagreus refuses to be Rassilon's puppet. At the end of Zagreus, the Doctor is exiled to the Divergents' universe, having previously cast Rassilon into that reality to end his actions but unable to return to his universe as he was still contaminated by anti-time. He eventually tracks down Rassilon in that universe, and discovers that he has been manipulating an entity called the Kro'Ka to observe and control the Doctor and Charley's actions. At the end of the events of \\"The Next Life\\", the Doctor and his companions escape the timeless Divergent universe‚ÄîRassilon having previously filtered the Zagreus energies out of the Doctor upon his arrival in this universe without the Doctor's knowledge‚Äîbut Rassilon and the Kro'Ka remain trapped in a permanent loop. Rassilon's next audio appearance comes in Desperate Measures, concluding the ninth series of Big Finish Productions spin-off Gallifrey. During the Time War the Time Lord Valerian (David Sibley) becomes a host through whom Rassilon is resurrected to lead Gallifrey. These events will lead into the tenth series of the spin-off where the part will be played by Terrence Hardiman. This season ends with Romana attempting to arrange as assassination to stop his dictatorship, ending with Rassilon beginning to regenerate. The series ends on a cliffhanger as he uses his regeneration as a propaganda opportunity. In Doctor Who: The Adventure Games, Rassilon's Final Sanction is mentioned when Amy Pond looked at a Time Lord Staff that the Eleventh Doctor kept in his study. Rassilon features in the War Doctor novel Engines of War by George Mann, which looks at the events that led to the War Doctor's decision to use the Moment, including the discovery that Rassilon has resurrected Borusa as a possibility engine to help him decide what actions he should take during the war. Rassilon returns to Gallifrey in the Titan Comics 2016 multi-Doctor event story Supremacy of the Cybermen, which depicts the last Cybermen at the end of the universe forming an alliance with Rassilon with the goal of conquering Gallifrey and using Time Lord energy to regenerate the universe into one under Cyber- control. Although Rassilon's insight allows the Cybermen to conquer history and defeat all of the past Doctors, the Twelfth Doctor is able to convince Rassilon to help him after the Cybermen betray Rassilon, the two turning the Cybermens' equipment against them so that the universe is 'regenerated' to a point before the Cybermen conquered Gallifrey. Although the Twelfth Doctor is the only one shown to remember these events, he is shown speculating that Rassilon may also remember the horrors of what he did.

A.V. Haight, 1890 Retrieved November 10, 2013 He progressed through the rank of master to that of lieutenant by 1847. He was placed on the reserve list as lieutenant by the retiring board in September 1855. Lt. Woolsey was called back to active duty in 1861 as a result of the American Civil War. Assigned initially to the receiving ship at New York, Woolsey assumed command of the steamer Ellen by late 1861 and began patrol duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. During that tour, his ship fought Confederate forces on three separate occasions. In May 1862, he engaged Fort Pemberton at Wapper Creek, South Carolina. On 1 June, his ship repelled a Confederate cavalry attack at Secessionville. Three days later, he commanded Ellen during the attack on James Island. In July 1862, he was promoted to commander and placed in command of the sloop Vandalia. That duty lasted until early 1863, at which time he was transferred to command of the steamer Princess Royal. That ship was assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron and patrolled the coasts of Louisiana and Texas. On 28 June 1863, Princess Royal helped to defend the town of Donaldsville, Louisiana, against a determined Southern attack, and Comdr. Woolsey received high commendation from his superiors for his ship's contribution to the successful defense of the town. He remained with the blockade through the end of the war and, by July 1866, saw his name returned to the active list in the rank of captain. Following the Civil War, Capt. Woolsey commanded the sloop-of-war Pawnee on the South Atlantic Station in 1867 and 1868. In 1869, he took command of the South Atlantic Station flagship Guerriere. In 1871, Woolsey was promoted to commodore, probably as flag officer in charge of the South Atlantic Station. His last tour of duty came in March 1873, when he took over as commandant of the navy yard at Pensacola, Florida. Commodore Woolsey received orders detaching him from command of the navy yard in the summer of 1874. At the time, an epidemic of yellow fever raged at Pensacola, and he deemed it necessary to remain at his post to prevent panic. He contracted the highly infectious disease and died at Pensacola in the summer of 1874.

He played Test cricket for India from 1966 to 1979 and formed part of the famous Indian spin quartet. He played a total of 67 Tests and took 266 wickets. He also captained the national side in 22 Test matches. Bedi wore a colourful patka and has voiced outspoken and forthright views on cricketing matters.  Playing career  In Indian domestic cricket, Bedi first played for Northern Punjab when only fifteen, having taken up cricket only two years previously, a particularly late age for this sport.Trevor Bailey, Richie Benaud, Colin Cowdrey and Jim Laker, The Lord's Taverners Fifty Greatest, Heinemann-Quixote, 1983 He moved to Delhi in 1968‚Äì69 and in the 1974‚Äì75 season of the Ranji Trophy, he took a record 64 wickets. Bedi also represented Northamptonshire in English county cricket for many years. He finished his career with 1560 wickets in first- class cricket‚Äîmore than any other Indian. His bowling has been described as graceful, even beautiful, and full of guile and artistry.D.J. Rutnagur, The Barclays World of Cricket, Willow Books 1986 He was an expert in flighting the ball, and was capable of making it hold it back or hurry forward and added subtle variations of spin. His action was so relaxed and coordinated that he was able to bowl all day with rhythm and control, a great asset to any captain. He had several very successful Test series:Peter Arnold, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of World Cricket, WH Smith 1985 * India vs Australia 1969‚Äì70: 21 wickets at 20.57 * India vs England 1972‚Äì73: 25 wickets at 25.28 * India in the West Indies: 18 wickets at 25.33 * India vs New Zealand 1976‚Äì77: 22 wickets at 13.18 * India vs England 1976‚Äì77: 25 wickets at 22.96 * India in Australia 1977‚Äì78: 31 wickets at 23.87 His best Test bowling was 7/98 against Australia at Calcutta in 1969‚Äì70, and his best match figures 10/194 at Perth in 1978‚Äì79, also against Australia. His best first class bowling was 7/5 for Delhi vs Jammu and Kashmir at New Delhi 1974‚Äì75. Although his batting was poor he hit a boundary off the second last ball in the Gillette Cup Semi Final for Northamptonshire vs Hampshire, winning the match by two wickets. His highest score of 50 not out, his only half century at Test level, was scored against New Zealand in Kanpur in 1976.2nd TEST: India v New Zealand at Kanpur, 18‚Äì23 November 1976 Bedi was appointed captain of India in 1976, succeeding Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi. His first Test victory as captain was against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in the 3rd Test of the 1976 series in which India scored a then-record 406 in the fourth innings.3rd Test: West Indies v India at Port of Spain, 7‚Äì12 April 1976 from Cricinfo This was followed up by a 2‚Äì0 series victory over New Zealand at home. However, after successive Test series losses to England (3‚Äì1 at home), Australia (3‚Äì2 away) and Pakistan (2‚Äì0 away), he was replaced as captain by Sunil Gavaskar. Bedi is second to Lance Gibbs in terms of maiden overs per test, 16.35 against 16.62. He has bowled 4.2 maiden overs per wicket as against 4.24 by Gibbs. In 2008, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack named Bedi as one of the five best cricketers to have not been selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year.Wisden ‚Äì Never a cricketer of the year from Cricinfo He said that he has always washed his own clothes, calling it \\"the best exercise for your shoulders and fingers\\", when pointing out that spin bowling requires suppleness of limbs.Cricinfo ‚Äì 'Chucking is a bigger threat than bribing or betting'  Controversy  As captain of India, Bedi was involved in some controversies. Following India's record-breaking run- chase in the 3rd Test of the 1976 series against the West Indies, the West Indies opted for an aggressive four-man fast bowler attack for the 4th Test. Bedi objected to their tactics of bowling beamers because they couldn't get Indian batsmen out, and declared the Indian first innings closed early after two players were forced to retire hurt. Subsequently, five players were absent hurt in the second innings of the match. In England's tour of India in 1976‚Äì77 he accused John Lever of using Vaseline to illegally polish the ball in the Third Test at Madras. Lever wore Vaseline strips on his forehead to keep the sweat out of his eyes; he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing. In November 1978, he became the first captain to concede an international cricket match. In a One Day International against Pakistan at Sahiwal, India, with 8 wickets in hand, required 23 runs from 14 balls. Bedi, however, recalled the batsmen from the crease and conceded the match in protest at the bowling of Sarfraz Nawaz who had bowled 4 bouncers in succession with not one being called wide by the umpires.3rd ODI: Pakistan v India at Sahiwal, 3 November 1978  Coaching  In 1990, after he had managed a tour where India had played poorly, he threatened to dump the entire team in the sea on the return journey.Bishan Bedi from Cricinfo  Opinions on modern-day cricket  Bedi has expressed strong opinions on many aspects of modern-day cricket and has been described as \\"being jealous of modern day great spinners\\".Cricinfo ‚Äì Bishan Bedi's deadly straight delivery In particular, he was a vehement critic of the bowling action of Muttiah Muralitharan (\\"if Murali doesn't chuck, then show me how to bowl\\") which he bluntly referred to as cheating and likened to a javelin throw and shot putting, saying that Muralitharan would \\"complete 1000 Test wickets but they would count as mere run-outs in my eyes\\".Cricinfo ‚Äì Murali considers legal action after Bedi jibe He takes a very dim view of chucking, which he calls \\"a bigger threat than bribing and betting\\" and claimed in 2004 that many bowlers on the subcontinent chuck, calling Muralitharan a \\"Sri Lankan bandit closing in on a dream artist called Shane Warne\\".Cricinfo ‚Äì Home boys, Sheikhs and chucking He has stated, though, that he has nothing personal against Muralitharan,Cricinfo ‚Äì 'I have nothing personal against Murali' ‚Äì Bedi although Muralitharan has threatened to sue him.Cricinfo ‚Äì Murali threatens to sue Bedi He levelled the same criticisms against his countryman Harbhajan Singh.Bedi points finger at Harbhajan ‚Äì Cricket ‚Äì Sport ‚Äì theage.com.au Regarding suspect actions in cricket, he said \\"When a bowler is chucking, he's referred to panels and the home cricket board.

He was the first batsman ever to score a century for India in Test cricket. He was independent India's first cricket captain and captained India in the first Test series win against Pakistan in 1952. He played only 3 Test Matches before World War 2 and thus lost all his prime years as India played no official Test matches. During this time he amassed around 10,000 runs with 30 hundreds in first class cricket which included teams from Australia and England featuring some of the most prominent Test players . After the war he played another 21 Test Matches for India. One of the prominent all rounders of the time, he later became the chairman of the Senior Selection Committee, BCCI and also served the game as a commentator and expert. He was responsible in grooming many youngsters like Chandu Borde, M.L. Jaisimha, Jasu Patel etc. who played for India. His sons Surinder & Mohinder Amarnath also became Test players for the country. His grandson Digvijay is also a current first class player. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1991. Early life Amarnath was born in Kapurthala, Punjab, and was raised in Lahore by Azmat Rana and Shafqat Rana family.https://www.thenews.com.pk/tns/detail/668924-the-twenty-two-families- of-pakistan-test-cricket-part-iii He played his debut match against England in 1933 on the Bombay Gymkhana grounds in South Bombay. Amarnath also played for the Hindus in the Bombay Quadrangular. Aside from being a tenacious batsman, Lala Amarnath was also a bowler of some repute and was the only bowler to dismiss Donald Bradman hit wicket. 1936 England tour Amarnath was controversially sent back from the 1936 tour of England by the captain, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, for \\"indiscipline\\". Amarnath and others allege it was due to politics. Vizzy, the Maharajkumar of Vizianagram, was named the captain for Indian cricket team for the 1936 tour of England, a post that he secured after lobbying and manipulation. Unfortunately, his desperately poor captaincy on the field resulted in even the normally reserved British press commenting on it. Some of the senior players in the squad, including Lala Amarnath, C. K. Nayudu and Vijay Merchant, were critical of Vizzy's playing abilities and captaincy, and the team was split between those who supported and criticised the captain. The low point in the tour occurred during India's match against Minor Counties at Lord's. Lala Amarnath had been nursing a back injury during the game. Vizzy had Amarnath pad up, but didn't put him in to bat as a succession of other batsmen were sent in ahead of him, which prevented Amarnath from resting his injury. Amarnath was finally put in to bat at the end of the day. Visibly angry after returning to the dressing room, he threw his kit into his bag and muttered in Punjabi, \\"I know what is transpiring\\". Vizzy took this as an affront, and conspired with team manager Major Jack Brittain-Jones to have Lala Amarnath sent back from the tour without playing the first test match. It is also alleged that in the first test against the England, Vizzy offered Mushtaq Ali a gold watch to run out Vijay Merchant. Captain and manager Lala Amarnath was the captain of the Indian team that toured Australia in 1947-1948. When the Partition of India took place in August 1947, Amarnath and his family had to flee the city to escape a Muslim mob. He lived in Patiala in the Indian state of Punjab till 1957, when he moved to the capital, Delhi. Lala Amarnath had received his education at Aligarh Muslim University. Amarnath is widely respected for reaching out to bridge the divide between players and fans of India and Pakistan, caused by political tensions between the two countries. Amarnath as captain was complimented for being straightforward and aggressive, and possessing great tactical acumen. Under his leadership, India won its first- ever Test against Pakistan in Delhi in 1952, and went on to win the series 2-1. Amarnath also managed the team when it toured Pakistan in 1954-55. Family and legacy His sons Mohinder and Surinder also played cricket for India and another son Rajinder played first-class cricket while his grandson Digvijay is also a first class player. Throughout his twilight years, Amarnath was considered a living legend of Indian cricket.

Besides the eponymous mall, the most characteristic distinctions of the area are North Seattle College (NSC), the south fork of the Thornton Creek watershed, and the Idriss Mosque. History =Prehistory= What is now Northgate has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE--10,000 years ago). The D _kh_ w‚ÄôDuw‚ÄôAbsh, People of the Inside and Xacuab≈°, People of the Large Lake, Lushootseed (Skagit-Nisqually) Coast Salish native people had used the Liq'tid Springs area as a spiritual health spa. They harvested cranberries from the Slo‚Äôq \`qed (SLOQ-qed, bald head), an 85 acre (34 ha) marsh and bog at what is now the NSCC car park, Interstate 5 interchange, and Northgate Mall. Large open areas for game habitat and foraging (anthropogenic grasslands) were maintained in what are now these neighborhoods by selective burning every few years. Today the Native American descendants are represented by the Duwamish tribe. =Development= The residential part of the Thornton Place complex, immediately south of Northgate Mall. The Northgate area has been subject to a large amount of residential and commercial development in the last few years, and many huge projects are underway. The height limits in the area have been increased to 85' to allow for further population growth. In 2009 the Northgate Mall was remodeled and added dozens more retail shops. In 2006, a new park, library, and community center opened in the Northgate neighborhood across 5th Ave NE from Northgate Mall. These are part of the city's plan to accelerate development in Northgate. While there is much commerce in the area, hotel development has been limited with only the Hotel Nexus, previously a Ramada Inn, being the only upscale hotel in the area. The many motels lining Aurora Avenue are further northwest than the Northgate neighborhood. Dense mixed-use development is expected to be constructed adjacent to the future Northgate station on Link Light Rail, scheduled to open in 2021 as the terminus of the Northgate Link Extension. Northgate will also be home to the headquarters and team practice facility of the Seattle Kraken beginning in 2021.

The Stamp Collector's Encyclopaedia. 6th edition. London: Stanley Paul, 1966, p.205. A reprint is to be distinguished from a new print which is not printed from the original medium. A reprint may or may not be valid as postage.  Background  While it is common for a postal service to add print runs as stocks are used up by the public, it is also the usual practice to only use a given design for a limited period of time so as to discourage forgery, and then to destroy the printing plates. Sometimes the authorities keep the plates on hand, and reuse them later. The reasons have included: * Problems with a new design, resulting in a sudden need for additional stamps * Additional copies for stamp collectors * Souvenirs for stamp shows, government meetings, etc. (these are often printed on cards rather than stamp paper)  Identifying reprints  As reprints are produced from the original plates, it can be very difficult to distinguish them from the original printing. Frequently subtle details matter, such the type of paper, type of gum, or color shades. Reprints often appear fresh and bright compared to the originals.  Official reprints  In a few cases, the postal authorities have produced official reproductions, copies of an existing design created on new plates. A notable example of this occurred in 1875 in the United States, where all stamps issued to date were reproduced or reprinted with the intention of making them more readily available to collectors. (The actual numbers printed were small, and so most of the reissues are now rarer and more expensive than the originals they resemble.) In 1962, to prevent people profiting from the issue of an invert stamp error, the United States Post Office Department intentionally reprinted 40,270,000 copies the yellow Dag Hammarskj√∂ld invert stamp.Dag Hammarskj√∂ld On Stamps by Chuck Matlack (retrieved 29 September 2006)  Unofficial reprints  Unofficial or illegitimate reprints also exist, being produced by private printers who were contracted to print stamps, but retained the plates for their own use. The classic example is the Seebeck reprints of Latin American stamps produced in great numbers around the end of the 19th century.

An allrounder, Styris played as an aggressive right-handed middle order batsman and a right- arm medium pace bowler. Educated at Fairfield Intermediate and Hamilton Boys' High School, Styris has represented Auckland and Northern Districts since 1994/95. Styris has played for Hamilton in the Hawke Cup. Domestic career Domestically Styris played for Northern Districts and for Auckland In 2005 he signed with Middlesex and stayed with them for the 2006 season as well where he deputised for the country captain Ben Hutton in several matches. He received his county cap during the 2006 season. He signed a 2-month contract at Durham County Cricket Club from 1 June 2007. He was bought to play for the IPL 2009 champions Deccan Chargers, which is a Hyderabad based Indian Premier League franchise. In 2010 Styris played for Essex County Cricket Club in the Friends Provident t20 competition and returned to the club for the 2011 season. In 2012 while playing for Sussex County Cricket Club, Styris scored the equal third-fastest T20 century (37 balls) in the quarter finals of the 2012 Friends Life t20 competition. It won the 2012 Walter Lawrence Trophy. International career Styris made his debut for New Zealand in a One Day International at Rajkot in 1999/2000. His maiden wicket was that of Sachin Tendulkar, one of 3 wickets for the match. He had to wait until mid-2002 to play his first Test Match, against the West Indies at Grenada. His debut had almost come at Karachi 2 months earlier but the match was abandoned due to bomb blasts near the team hotel. In the Test at Grenada he batted at number 8 and top scored with 107. When it was New Zealand's time to bowl Styris came on and took 2 for 88. The first of his wickets was that of Brian Lara which gave him impressive maiden scalps in both formats of the game. He made an unbeaten 69 in the second innings to complete a dream debut but missed out on the man of the match award which went to Chris Gayle who scored a double hundred. In the ODI series after the Tests he continued his form but this time with the ball, taking 6 for 25 at Trinidad. This broke the record for best One Day International bowling figures by a New Zealander. At Mohali in 2003/04 against India he scored his second Test hundred with 119, one of 4 New Zealander's to make a century in the innings. Soon after he made his career best Test score of 170 against South Africa in Auckland, his innings taking just 220 balls. In June 2004 New Zealand toured England and Styris impressed at Nottingham, making 108. He scored his fifth Test hundred at Auckland against the West Indies, an unbeaten 103 helping his side to win the Test. When New Zealand chased what was then an ODI record of 322 in 2005/06 against Australia at Christchurch, Styris contributed 101. An innings-by-innings breakdown of Styris' Test match batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last ten innings (blue line). He then suffered a back injury missed out on the Sri Lanka series of December 2006. Making his return in the latter stages of the Commonwealth Bank series in Australia and then in the Chappell Hadlee series at home, Styris had done enough to be included New Zealand's World Cup squad. Styris started the tournament with the man of the match award in a win over England at St Lucia. Chasing 210 for victory, Styris made an unbeaten 87 to guide his side home. His pugnacious batting style and distinctive gait led to former England captain Nasser Hussain referring to him as a \\"street fighter\\" from the commentary booth during the game. He made another half century in the game against Kenya and made 80 not out in a successful run chase against the home side. In the Super Eight stage the New Zealanders played Sri Lanka and Styris top-scored with 111 not out. The century came off 152 balls.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Records/ODI/Overall/Batting/Slowest_Hundreds_by_Balls.html It was his second ever World Cup century; he scored one in 2003. Shortly after the world cup Styris' form dropped of contributing to injuries and not enough practice due to the injuries. He then participated in a test series against South Africa in 2007 but was dropped from the test squad. He then continued to participate in ODI's and took part when the English cricket team were touring New Zealand in January to February 2008 and the Subsequent Return tour he participated well in both series with the bat but not much with the ball. Styris, aged 35 and competing for a competitive medium pace all-rounder slot with Grant Elliott, was selected for the Tri-series in Sri Lanka August 2010 he scored 88 runs in the first ODI. He completed his comeback by showing a bowling performance in the next match against Sri Lanka when he took the wicket of Kumar Sangakkara However, after the tournament he suffered a back stress fracture during training and missed the series against Bangladesh and India.

There are also records of people flayed after death, generally as a means of debasing the corpse of a prominent enemy or criminal, sometimes related to religious beliefs (e.g. to deny an afterlife); sometimes the skin is used, again for deterrence, esoteric/ritualistic purposes, etc. (e.g. scalping). Causes of death Dermatologist Ernst G. Jung notes that the typical causes of death due to flaying are shock, critical loss of blood or other body fluids, hypothermia, or infections, and that the actual death is estimated to occur from a few hours up to a few days after the flaying.p.69 Kleine Kulturgeschichte der Haut. p. 69. Ernst G. Jung (2007). Hypothermia is possible, as skin provides natural insulation and is essential for maintaining body temperature. History = Assyrian tradition = Assyrians flaying their prisoners alive Ernst G. Jung, in his Kleine Kulturgeschichte der Haut (\\"A short cultural history of the skin\\"), provides an essay in which he outlines the Neo-Assyrian tradition of flaying human beings.Paragraph based on the essay \\"Von Ursprung des Schindens in Assyrien\\" in Jung (2007), p.67-70 Already from the times of Ashurnasirpal II (r. 883-859 BC), the practice is displayed and commemorated in both carvings and official royal edicts. The carvings show that the actual flaying process might begin at various places on the body, such as at the crus (lower leg), the thighs, or the buttocks. Shield showing three flaying knives, symbol of Bartholomew the Apostle In their royal edicts, the Neo-Assyrian kings seem to gloat over the terrible fate they imposed upon their captives, and that flaying seems, in particular, to be the fate meted out to rebel leaders. Jung provides some examples of this triumphant rhetoric. From Ashurnasirpal II: The Rassam cylinder in the British Museum describes this: = Other examples = Searing or cutting the flesh from the body was sometimes used as part of the public execution of traitors in medieval Europe. A similar mode of execution was used as late as the early 18th century in France; one such episode is graphically recounted in the opening chapter of Michel Foucault's Discipline and Punish (1979). In 1303, the treasury of Westminster Abbey was robbed while holding a large sum of money belonging to King Edward I. After the arrest and interrogation of 48 monks, three of them, including the subprior and sacrist, were found guilty of the robbery and flayed. Their skin was attached to three doors as a warning against robbers of church and state. At St Michael & All Angels' Church in Copford in Essex, England, it is claimed that human skin was found attached to an old door, though evidence seems elusive.Wall, J. Charles (1912), Porches and Fonts. Wells Gardner and Darton, London. pp. 41-42.

Distributed by the skater community and graffiti artists, the stickers featuring an image of Andr√© the Giant began showing up in many cities across the United States. At the time, Fairey declared the campaign to be \\"an experiment in phenomenology\\". Over time, the artwork has been reused in a number of ways and has become worldwide. Fairey also altered the work stylistically and semantically into OBEY Giant.Shepard Fairey, \\"Supply & Demand: The Art of Shepard Fairey\\", pg. 35. History OBEY Giant clothing sold at a department store OBEY Giant image stenciled on a building wall in Athens, Greece OBEY Giant poster on building exterior Fairey and fellow Rhode Island School of Design student Ryan Lesser, along with Blaize Blouin, Alfred Hawkins and Mike Mongo created paper and vinyl stickers and posters with an image of the wrestler Andr√© the Giant and the text \\"ANDRE THE GIANT HAS A POSSE 7' 4\\", 520 lb\\", (\\"7'4\\", 520 lbs\\"‚Äî2.24 m, 236 kg‚Äîfamously being Andre the Giant's billed height and weight) as an in-joke directed at hip hop and skater subculture, and then began clandestinely and aggressively propagating and posting them in Providence, Rhode Island, and over the rest of the Eastern United States. In an interview with Format magazine in 2008, Fairey said: \\"The Andre the Giant sticker was just a spontaneous, happy accident. I was teaching a friend how to make stencils in the summer of 1989, and I looked for a picture to use in the newspaper, and there just happened to be an ad for wrestling with Andr√© the Giant and I told him that he should make a stencil of it. He said 'Nah, I‚Äôm not making a stencil of that, that‚Äôs stupid!' but I thought it was funny so I made the stencil and I made a few stickers and the group of guys I was hanging out with always called each other The Posse, so it said Andre the Giant Has a Posse, and it was sort of appropriated from hip-hop slang ‚Äì Public Enemy, N.W.A and Ice-T were all using the word.\\"Kobi Annobil, Shepard Fairey, 'Format Magazine', January 21, 2008 By the early 1990s, tens of thousands of paper and then vinyl stickers were photocopied and hand- silkscreened and put in visible places throughout the world. \\"Andre the Giant Has a Posse\\" is also the title of a 1995 documentary short by Helen Stickler, which was the first documentary to feature Shepard Fairey and chronicle his influential street art campaign. The film screened worldwide, most notably in the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. In 2003, Village Voice film critic Ed Halter described the film as: \\"legendary\\" and \\"a canonical study of a Gen-X media manipulation. One of the keenest examinations of '90s underground culture\\". The threat of a lawsuit from Titan Sports, Inc. in 1994Shepard Fairey interview in Tattoo Magazine, 1999. spurred Fairey to stop using the trademarked name Andr√© the Giant, and to create a more iconic image of the wrestler's face, now most often with the equally iconic branding OBEY. The \\"OBEY\\" slogan was not only a parody of propaganda, but also a direct homage to the \\"OBEY\\" signs found in the cult film, They Live (1988), starring Roddy Piper. About \\"OBEY\\", San Diego Union-Tribune art critic Robert L. Pincus said: \\"[Fairey's work] was a reaction against earlier political art, since it delivered no clear message. Still, 'Obey' was suggestively antiauthoritarian.\\"Social ferment not always reflected in fermentation of artworks \\"Following the example set by gallery art, some street art is more about the concept than the art,\\" writes The Walrus contributor Nick Mount. \\"'Fuck Bush' isn‚Äôt an aesthetic; it‚Äôs an ethic. Shepard Fairey‚Äôs Obey Giant stickers and Akay's Akayism posters are clever children of Duchamp, ironic conceptual art.\\"The Renaissance of Cute, issue 2008.09  Appropriation and fair use  Fairey has come under criticism for appropriating others' artwork. Graphic designer Baxter Orr did his own take on Fairey's work: a piece called Protect, with the iconic Obey Giant face covered by a SARS (respiratory) mask. He started selling prints, marked as his own work, through his website. On April 23, 2008, Orr received a signed cease-and-desist order from Fairey's attorneys, telling him to pull Protect from sale because they alleged it violated Fairey's trademark. Fairey threatened to sue, calling the designer a \\"bottom feeder\\" and \\"parasite\\".Artist Cage Match: Fairey vs. Orr, Richard Whittaker, The Austin Chronicle, May 13, 2008. Over time, Fairey's artistic imagery has evolved into a sometimes subtle, sometimes not, parody of a range of iconic styles, mostly a juxtaposition of popular political propagandas and multi-national commercialism. It usually bears the text OBEY Giant. In addition to countless small stickers, OBEY Giant has been spread by stencil, murals, and large wheatpaste posters, covering public and private spaces from building faces and street sign backs, to commercial spaces such as billboards and bus stop posters. Furthermore, the popular \\"OBEY\\" slogan and stylized Andr√© the Giant face continue to be reproduced on products ranging from art and clothing to home accessories and decor, considerably expanding the impact of the campaign through iconology based on an allegiance to media and popular culture in the guise of counterculture. Parodies The original \\"Andre the Giant Has a Posse\\" sticker format has been widely imitated for humorous effect over many years. In these parody stickers, the image of Andr√© the Giant has been replaced with a similarly stylized black-and-white photo of some other person or character, along with the new figure's height and weight. For example, the parody sticker \\"Tattoo the Midget Has a Bigger Posse\\" features the image of Herv√© Villechaize portraying the character Tattoo from Fantasy Island. Colin Purrington's \\"Charles Darwin Has a Posse\\" stickers, featuring a black-and-white photo of Charles Darwin, promote the theory of evolution. During the 2000 presidential campaign in the United States, \\"Ralph Nader Has a Posse\\" showed up on college campuses. Numerous other parody stickers can be found featuring different popular culture figures, including the Homestar Runner character Strong Mad. Another parody of the \\"Obey\\" poster has an image of Henry David Thoreau and reads \\"Disobey\\" in reference to his essay Civil Disobedience.'' These parody stickers are a further extension of the original \\"joke\\", and thus are most likely to be found in locations where the original Andr√© the Giant iconography is already familiar, such as SoHo, Manhattan, or South Street, Philadelphia. An unusual occurrence of a parody sticker was at the particle physics laboratory Fermilab where the director of the lab, Pier Oddone, was the subject of the sticker.symmetry magazine, 2008. Tenacious D produced stickers with the slogan \\"Obey the D\\" and stylized images of their members, Jack Black and Kyle Gass, over their initials. Guitar Hero II features a \\"Vlad Has a Posse\\" sticker on various loading screens throughout the game. Electronic Frontier Foundation created a sticker with the words \\"Fair Use Has a Posse\\" on it. \\"Joey Deacon Has a Posse\\" parody stencils have appeared in the United Kingdom. \\"Jack Has a Posse\\" stickers have appeared in the Gaslamp Quarter of San Diego, California, in July 2011 during the Esri International User Conference held at the nearby San Diego Convention Center. The stickers carry an image of US businessman Jack Dangermond, founder of Esri. ThinkGeek produced a T-shirt with the slogan \\"Fezzik Has a Posse\\" in March 2012, in reference to Andr√© the Giant's role as Fezzik in the movie The Princess Bride (1987) and the \\"Andre the Giant Has a Posse\\" street art campaign. In 2014, WWE wrestler Daniel Bryan started wearing a T-shirt with a stylized image of himself with a \\"YES\\" slogan at the bottom. Also in 2014, a rash of \\"Aleister Crowley has a Posse\\" stickers appeared around New York City and Chicago. New York Mets pitcher Bartolo Col√≥n has also been the subject of a line of parody stickers spread around the country in 2016. The cover of the April 2017 issue of Harper's Magazine features a photo of a protester with a sign parodying the \\"Obey\\" poster with a stylized portrait of President Donald Trump and the slogan \\"Disobey\\".

Background and education Born at Brocket Hall, Hertfordshire, Cowper was the second son of Peter Cowper, 5th Earl Cowper, and the Hon. Emily Lamb, daughter of Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne (since his mother had several lovers there is some doubt about his true paternity). He was the younger brother of George Cowper, 6th Earl Cowper and nephew of Prime Minister Lord Melbourne. His father died in 1837 and in 1839 his mother married another Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, who became Cowper's stepfather. He was educated at Eton. After entering the Royal Horse Guards in 1830, he was promoted Captain five years later, eventually attaining the rank of brevet Major in 1852. Political career In 1835, Cowper was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Hertford, a seat he held for the next thirty-three years, and became private secretary to his uncle Prime Minister Lord Melbourne. He was appointed a Groom in Waiting in 1837, and in 1841 served for three months as a Lord of the Treasury under Melbourne, only resuming office five years later as a Lord of the Admiralty when the Whigs returned to power under Lord John Russell. He again held this post under Lord Aberdeen from 1852 to 1855, and in the latter year was made Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department by his stepfather Lord Palmerston when he became Prime Minister. In August that same year he was appointed President of the Board of Health, and sworn of the Privy Council. Four years later he became Vice-President of the Board of Trade and Paymaster General, only serving for a year before Palmerston appointed him First Commissioner of Works. In 1866, on the fall of Lord Russell's government, Cowper left office for good. Two years later he was returned to Parliament for Hampshire South, and held this seat until 1880. Cowper-Temple was involved in the 1870 Education Act which set up Board Schools (state primary schools, run by elected local school boards) throughout England. He was responsible for the Cowper-Temple clause, an amendment which became Section 14 of the Act. In order to overcome the concerns of Nonconformists that their children might be taught Anglican doctrine, the clause proposed that religious teaching in the new state schools be non- denominational, which in practice meant learning the Bible and a few hymns. Section 7 of the Act also gave parents the right to withdraw their children from any religious instruction provided in board schools, and to withdraw their children at that or other times to attend any other religious instruction of their choice.Jenkins 2002, pp231-5 When his mother died in 1869, he inherited a number of estates under his stepfather's will, and so took that year under Royal licence the additional surname of Temple. The properties included a 10,000 acre estate on Sligo's Mullaghmore peninsula with its unfinished Classiebawn Castle, commissioned by his stepfather, which he completed by 1874. In 1880 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Mount Temple, of Mount Temple in the County of Sligo. This was a revival of the junior title held by the Viscounts Palmerston, which had become extinct along with the viscountcy on his stepfather's death in 1865. Apart from his political career Lord Mount Temple organized ecumenical conferences at Broadlands. One of the regular speakers there was George MacDonald. Personal life Lord Mount Temple was twice married. He married firstly Harriet Alicia, daughter of Daniel Gurney, in 1843. After her early death the same year, he married secondly, in 1848, Georgina Tollemache, daughter of Admiral John Richard Delap Tollemache, and a sister of the 1st Baron Tollemache. Both marriages were childless. He died on 16 October 1888, aged 76, at his home of Broadlands, Hampshire, and was buried at nearby Romsey. His peerage became extinct on his death. Lady Mount Temple died in October 1901, aged 79. His estates (excluding Shelley House, Chelsea lived in by and inherited by his wife) had already passed or were inherited by his nephew, the Rt. Hon. Evelyn Ashley, the second son of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury.

It is known for its superb tracking ability, aggressiveness and an unforgiving, impetuous temperament. Rather than attacking its prey, the Fila traps it and waits for the hunter to arrive. Owing to these qualities, the Fila Brasileiro is used as a guard dog, as a cattle dog for livestock and as a hunting dog for tracking and controlling large game. When slavery was legal in Brazil in the 18th century, the Fila Brasileiro was used to return fugitive slaves unharmed to their masters.  Etymology  The verb \\"Filar\\" in Portuguese literally means \\"hold, arrest, grab\\". So \\"C√£o de Fila\\" (Fila dog) or \\"C√£o de filar\\" suggests that it is a \\"catch dog\\", a dog that \\"bites and does not loosen its grip\\". A similar name is also found in two Portuguese dog breeds: the C√£o de Fila de S√£o Miguel and the extinct C√£o de Fila da Terceira. History Dogs hunting a jaguar in Brazil, by Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied One theory is that the breed is a combination between the English Mastiff, Bloodhound and old Bulldog of the 15th century. Another theory is that the Fila is the result of the crossbreeding between Portuguese and Spanish dogs brought to Brazil during the Iberian Union period. In this case, the Fila would have as possible ascendents the Spanish Mastiff, C√£o de Castro Laboreiro, C√£o de Gado Transmontano, Rafeiro do Alentejo, C√£o Fila de S√£o Miguel, etc., or the predecessor of these breeds (the Iberian Alaunt), possibly combined with scent hounds. The Fila Brasileiro were bred and raised primarily on large plantations and cattle farms where they originated. In addition to cattle, jaguars, and other animals, these dogs were taught to chase down runaway slaves. The dogs would grab the slave or animals by the neck and hold them until the farmer arrived. This instinct can be observed among puppies when they are playing. The first written standard of the breed was edited in 1946. The Paulistas were responsible for organizing a planned breeding program and opening a stud book to register dogs. Dr. Paulo Santos Cruz began to systematically breed the Fila Brasileiro and also contributed largely in setting the CAFIB standard, and who now, therefore, has the right to be called the \\"father\\" of the Fila Brasileiro. About the registries, CBKC (Brazilian Confederation Kennel Club) follows the FCI (Federation Cynologique Internationale) policy and accepts for registration only dogs with FCI pedigrees, orienting the breeders to have hip dysplasia control, besides other health problems. The Fila Brasileiro is described as a Brazilian Mastiff or a Brazilian Molosser. In the U.S., the OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) does a statistical registry of all Filas that were X-rayed to diagnose hip dysplasia. The Brazilian army compared this breed to Doberman Pinschers and German Shepherds in a five-year study using these dogs in the jungle under extremely hostile conditions. The following traits were observed: intelligence, aggressiveness, sensibility, temperament, energy, resistance, rusticity and strength. German Shepherds were found to have the highest intelligence and Doberman Pinschers the highest level of aggression. The Fila Brasileiro was found to be superior in every other category.  Appearance  Adult Fila Brasileiro In Brazil the breed has two main standards imposed by two distinct clubs, the CBKC (Brazilian Confederation of Cynophilia) affiliated to FCI, and the CAFIB (Fila Brasileiro's Enhancement Club). Consequently, the stock of each club has visible morphological differences. The CAFIB standard was constructed based on the ancient phenotype of the breed. But the current CBKC/FCI standard is the best known internationally. The Fila Brasileiro is a molosser breed with large bones and loose skin. The FCI breed standard requires males to be between 65 and 75 cm (25.5 inches to 29.5 inches) high at the withers and weigh . Females are slightly smaller and are expected to be 60 to 70 cm (23.5 inches to 27.5 inches) high at the withers and weigh at least 41 kg (90 lbs). They have a rectangular build and though they are massive, their natural agility is apparent. The head is big and heavy with a deep muzzle. The ears are large, thick, tapered and either droop or fold back exposing the interior, depending on the dog's mood. The neck and back are well muscled and the chest is broad and deep. Unlike the vast majority of canines, the croup is higher than the withers. The legs are heavily boned. The skin is very distinctive of the breed, as it is thick and loose all over the body, mainly in the region around the neck. The thick skin forms pronounced dewlaps. In many individuals, the dewlaps proceed to the chest and abdomen. Some dogs show a fold at the side of the head and also at the withers descending to the shoulders. The coat is short and dense and the texture is normally smooth and soft. Their colours vary from solid, brindle, mouse-grey, patched, dappled, or black and tan. They are almost never white. Typical colours are fawn, black and brindle. Brindles of a basic color may have the stripes of either less or with very strong intensity. Sometimes a black mask is present. Though large in size, the Fila does not appear static. Rather it is harmonious, cat-like and, above all, powerful. The Fila appears self-assured and calm but is never absent in expression. When at attention, the gaze of the Fila Brasileiro is firm, alert and unwavering. Another typical characteristic of the breed is its gait, which is similar to that of a camel, moving two legs of one side at a time. The gait gives it a typical rolling lateral movement on the throat and the hindquarters which is accentuated when the dog's tail is raised. The head is typically lower than the backline. The characteristic carriage and gait has earned it great success in dog shows. The coat of the Fila Brasileiro is smooth and short. Black, fawns (red, apricot, or dark), and brindled (fawn, black, or brown brindle) colors are permitted, except mouse-grey, black and tan, blue, dappled and solid white. White markings, not exceeding 1/4 of the coat surface area, are permitted on the feet, the chest and the tip of the tail in the FCI standard. The CAFIB standard does not accept black, mouse-grey, black and tan, blue, or dappled coats, as it considers them as a sign of crossbreeding; on the other hand, it accepts dogs with large white markings on any part of the body.  Standards In Brazil the Fila Brasileiro can be bred within three different standards proposed by three separate clubs. The standard imposed by the CBKC (a club affiliated to the FCI) is the most popular in the world, but it is by far the most distant from the appearance of the old dogs of four decades ago. The other two standards are from CAFIB (Fila Brasileiro's Enhancement Club) and AMFIBRA (World Association of Dog Breeders of Fila Brasileiro), respectively. Both are based on the first breed standard elaborated by Paulo Santos Cruz, the man who is considered the \\"father of the breed\\". However, the CAFIB standard is the most popular of the two. But both clubs (CAFIB and AMFIBRA) present themselves with the aim to preserve the pure Fila with the closest appearance of the old dogs. This big difference between the three standards is mainly due to an accusation of a scandal of crossbreeding at the dogs registered by the CBKC in the 70's, 80's and 90's and, consequently, the many changes made in the CBKC standard probable to include dogs with characteristics of foreign breeds, such as the English Mastiff, Great Dane and Neapolitan Mastiff. Paulo Santos Cruz himself, who even participated in the formation of the CAFIB for these same reasons and even presided over the club, published an article in 1979 explaining how to differentiate a pure Fila from a mixed one. Temperament Fila Brasileiro Fila Brasileiros are known to be naturally protective. They are bred to be aggressive. It is also known for its extreme wariness of strangers and agility when protecting or defending its master. The dedication and obedience of the Fila Brasileiro has found its way into the Brazilian saying \\"as faithful as a Fila\\". The Fila Brasileiro temperament is what characterizes the dog. The Portuguese word for their temperament is \\"ojeriza\\", which directly translated into English means \\"dislike\\" or \\"distrust\\". The socialization period (about the first year with the first six to eight months being the most important) of the dog's life is crucial to the temperament of the individual dog. If the pup is exposed to a lot of people in a positive manner (known as 'socializing'), the pup (keeping in mind the dog's natural protective instincts) can be encouraged to behave in a calm manner in public, but emphasis should be placed on the fact that socialization is done differently from other breeds. Despite extensive socialization, the Fila is instinctively protective and will naturally guard and protect its owner, their family members and the family pets; this is not something that needs to be trained, it is an innate trait. Strangers should not be left unattended with a Fila and, like all other guardian breeds, it may not be the best choice for those who have frequent visitors to their homes. Lack of all socialization with strangers at a young age will result in a dog which is very anti-social. Common ailments Fila Brasileiros are prone to large breed ailments, including hip dysplasia,elbow dysplasia, and gastric torsion (better known as bloat) a life threatening condition that can develop in some dogs that causes the stomach to rapidly fill with gas and/or fluid and then flip upon itself. These dogs require plenty of exercise and hence are not very well suited to city life. Open country with fenced yards are very good for the dogs, as it gives them plenty of room to run and exercise. Life expectancy Filas are known to live up to about nine to eleven years. Legal status In Fiji, the United Kingdom, Norway, Malta and Cyprus it is illegal to own any of these dogs without specific exemption from a court. In Australia, in the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia the Fila is a restricted or proscribed breed. Imports are also prohibited. They are automatically classified as a dangerous dog in New Zealand and Trinidad & Tobago, meaning they cannot be imported and males must be neutered.

Osborn was named after the superintendent of the railroad named E.F. Osborn. The previously unnamed town allowed the railroad to be built through it after the nearby town of Fairfield refused the plan of the railway to go through there. Nearly the entire town of Osborn, along with the railroad, were relocated two miles away during construction of the Huffman dam to a site east of and adjacent to Fairfield, Ohio in 1921. This was necessary because of the Miami Valley Flood Control Project and the Miami Conservancy District that was begun after the Great Dayton Flood (Dayton, Ohio) of March, 1913. Many of the original houses of old Osborn still stand in Fairborn, Ohio in the \\"Osborn Historic District\\". On January 1, 1950, Osborn and the neighboring town of Fairfield were merged as Fairborn. The first business to depict the name of the new city was the large vertical sign of the Fairborn Theatre. The old Osborn cemetery lies within the boundary of Wright-Patterson, near the north end of the main flight line, which used to be part of the town. During the building of the longer runway to accommodate the large B-36 Bombers in the 1940s, the old streets of Osborn were still visible on the ground near the airstrip.

Durgens was a backbench member of the governing party in the House of Commons, but had a maverick streak and aspired to do the right thing even if it wasn't politically expedient. Some of the storylines within the series were fictionalized depictions of real-life events in Canadian politics, and the series incorporated some documentary filmmaking techniques inspired by the National Film Board. Alan Macnaughton, the retiring Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, and David Vivian Currie, the incumbent Sergeant-at-Arms, served as script consultants to ensure that Canadian political process was accurately depicted. The series was frequently compared in the Canadian press to Slattery's People, an American series about a state legislator which aired on CBS in the 1964‚Äì65 season.

He emigrated to Australia and was a key figure in the Heidelberg School, arguably the beginning of a distinctively Australian tradition in Western art. Early life Conder was born in Tottenham, Middlesex, the second son, of six children, of James Conder, civil engineer and Mary Ann Ayres.Conder's other surviving siblings were Samuel James and Alice. (Gibson, 1914, p. 23). He spent several years as a young child in India until the death of his mother (aged 31 years) on 14 May 1873 in Bombay, when Charles was four; he was then sent back to England and attended a number of schools including a boarding school at Eastbourne, which he attended from 1877. He left school at 15, and his very religious, non-artistic father, against Charles's natural artistic inclinations, decided that he should follow in his footsteps as a civil engineer.Gibson, pp. 23‚Äì25 In 1884, at the age of 16, he was sent to Sydney, Australia, where he worked for his uncle, a land surveyor for the New South Wales government. However he disliked the work, much preferring to draw the landscape rather than survey it. In 1886, he left the job and became an artist for the \\"Illustrated Sydney News\\", where he was in the company of other artists such as Albert Henry Fullwood, Frank Mahony and Benjamin Edwin Minns. He also attended the painting classes of Alfred James Daplyn and had joined the Art Society of New South Wales.Ursula Hoff, 'Conder, Charles Edward (1868‚Äì1909)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol. 3, MUP, 1969, pp 446‚Äì447.Gibson, pp. 26 Career A holiday at Mentone, c. 1888 (This painting featured on a 1984 Australian postage stamp) The Wreck, 1889 In 1888, Conder moved to Melbourne where he met other Australian artists including Arthur Streeton, and shared a studio with Tom Roberts, whom he had previously met in Sydney. Short of cash, the attractive Conder apparently paid off his landlady by sexual means, catching syphilis in the process, which was to plague the later years of his life. During his two years in Melbourne, Conder worked with the other members of the school and produced a number of famous works, including Under The Southern Sun. This painting clearly shows the burning sunlight and desolation that can be inflicted by an Australian drought.Under the Southern Sun, 1890 (artistsfootsteps.com). In 1890, he moved to Paris and studied at the Acad√©mie Julian,Ian Chilvers, The Oxford Dictionary of Art, P.164 where he befriended several avant-garde artists. In Sydney and later Melbourne Conder associated with G. P. Nerli, an itinerant Italian painter and the bearer of new European influences who has been credited with shaping Conder's development. The extent of the influence has been debated, but the fact of it is undeniable. Like Conder, Nerli was a bon- vivant whose appreciation of the 'dam fine' 'Melbourne girls' survives in a letter to a mutual friend, Percy Spence. The hot sands, 1891 Regarded as his greatest Sydney painting, Departure of the Orient ‚Äì Circular Quay (1888) was the culmination of Conder's new mastery of form and brushwork. Painted from the vantage point of an upstairs room at the First and Last Hotel, overlooking the bustling harbour and ferry berths at Circular Quay in Sydney Cove, this work depicts the dockside scene at the moment when the ‚ÄòOrient‚Äô has cast off for her voyage to England. The theme of lively urban streetscapes and rainy atmospheric conditions was one that derived originally from Japanese art and informed the work of the American-born James Abbott McNeill Whistler, who in turn inspired a generation of international artists conversant with the principles of French Impressionism. Following successful sale of this work to the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Conder departed for Melbourne in October 1888 to join Roberts and the circle of painters working there. He returned to Europe in 1890, where he became fully involved with Aestheticism and mixed with leading artists and writers of the day including Henri Toulouse-Lautrec, Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley.http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/work/829/ Conder was a fun-loving man who painted with an often humorous touch. While staying with Tom Roberts in his famous Grosvenor chambers studio, he painted A holiday at Mentone (1888), which shows men and women at the beach relaxing while clothed from head to foot‚Äìthe men in suits and hats; the ladies in long, girdled dresses with boots and pretty hats. The man and woman at the front of the painting face away from each other, yet possibly are interested in each other, each watching the other from the corner of their eye. The mood is one of simple elegance and with a relaxed feel, as in the background people are strolling along the beach into the distance. The composition of the painting has possibly been borrowed from a work by Whistler in which a bridge similarly transects the picture. Conder among other painters such as Frederick McCubbin had been directly or indirectly influenced by Whistler. =Europe= Conder left Australia in 1890, and spent the rest of his life in Europe, mainly England, but visiting France on many occasions. His art was better received in England than in Paris. In 1892, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec painted his portrait, this sketch is owned by the Aberdeen Art Gallery and Museum. In 1895, Conder came to Dieppe, attempting to socialise among the artistic community and the English families with their attractive daughters, as described by Simona Pakenham in her study of the English people there in the century before World War I. His friends remembered him as \\" a sick man, unable to face reality\\". In spite of drunken spells and disreputable company, Conder's powers as an artist were then at their height. He made a specialty of painting on silk, relatively easy on silk fans, but he excelled on one occasion when he painted a series of white silk gowns worn by Alexandra Thaulow, wife of Norwegian painter Frits Thaulow, while she stood on a table, the gowns becoming \\"coloured like a field of flowers\\".Simona Pakenham, Sixty Miles from England, p.145-148. He met Aubrey Beardsley in Dieppe, but they did not like each other.Simona Pakenham, Sixty Miles from England, p.152 He continued to paint, but his output was severely affected by the continual poor health, including paralysis and a bout of delirium tremens. He married a wealthy widow, Stella Maris Belford (n√©e MacAdams) at The British Embassy Paris on 5 December 1901, giving him financial security. His later works are not nearly as well regarded critically as his earlier Australian paintings. Later life and death He spent the last year of his life in a sanatorium, and died in Holloway Sanatorium of \\"general paresis of the insane\\", in modern terms tertiary syphilis. In death, Conder's work was rated highly by many notable artists, such as Pissarro and Degas. The Canberra suburb of Conder, established in 1991, was named after him. Satirist Barry Humphries is a major aficionado and collector of the artist, and at one time had the world's largest private collection of Conder's work.Clive James, \\"Approximately in the Vicinity of Barry Humphries\\", London Review of Books, 6‚Äì9 October 1983 See also Visual arts of Australia References Bibliography *Galbally, Ann.

It was arguably the first successful drama series on English Canadian television.  Plot  Steve Wojeck is a crusading big city coroner who regularly fights moral injustices raised by the deaths he investigated. He often tackles tough and controversial issues. The first episode of the series examines the role of racism in the suicide of a young Ojibwe man.  Main cast  * John Vernon as Steve Wojeck * Patricia Collins as Marty Wojeck * Ted Follows as Crown Attorney Arnold (Arnie) Bateman * Carl Banas as Sgt.

Although it was one of the highest-rated shows on Canadian television in its time, only 20 episodes of the series were made, because Vernon was lured to Hollywood by the promise of more money than the CBC could offer. He only returned to the role once, for a TV movie Wojeck: Out of the Fire (1992). The first season (1966-67) was filmed in black and white, while season two (1967‚Äì68) was shot in colour.

Overview The company based its core business around job matchmaking particularly between ready-to-graduate students and corporations in the '60s, further expanding into matchmaking of job change seekers, as well as real estate and rental information in the 1970s. By the end of the 1980s, the company was also engaged in the publication of classified ad magazines covering fields such as part-time job listings, automobile and overseas travel. In 1988, the company was reported to be engaged in the Recruit scandal, which led to the retirement of founder Hiromasa Ezoe from the company and his share being sold to Daiei, from which it became independent in 2000.

In September 1970 he was elected First Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the Leningrad Region. In this position he gained a reputation of being a good organizer and well versed in economic matters, winning defense investment for Leningrad. He was elected a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union at the XXIVth congress of the CPSU in 1971. He became a candidate member of the Central Committee's Politburo in 1973 and a full member in 1976. In 1977 he initiated a successful vote to remove Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Nikolai Podgorny from the Politburo.  Secretary of the Central Committee  In 1983 Romanov attracted the attention of the new General Secretary Yuri Andropov, who subsequently brought him to Moscow and helped promote him in June 1983 to the very prestigious and influential post of a secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU responsible for industry and the military- industrial complex. During the few remaining months of Andropov's life Romanov was widely seen as one of Andropov's closest collaborators and was an ardent supporter of Andropov's comprehensive program for the reform, renewal and further development of socialism in the Soviet Union and beyond, a fact which stands in sharp contrast to the picture Gorbachev and his associates were later to paint of Romanov as a means of gaining advantage in the power struggles following Andropov's death in February 1984. Romanov attracted international attention on November 5, 1983, during the height of Operation Able Archer. Grigory Vasilyevich addressed the Kremlin Palace of Congresses in order to commemorate the October Revolution, where he remarked: Western analysts, unaware of the Exercise that was taking place and therefore uncertain as to why Romanov would describe the situation as \\"white hot\\", dismissed the remarks as Soviet propaganda. During Konstantin Chernenko's short time in office as General Secretary in 19841985, Romanov already occupied a position clearly inferior to Gorbachev, who had been styled Second Secretary of the Central Committee since February 1984 and acted as chairman of the Politburo, Secretariat and Central Committee in the course of Chernenko's long periods of absence due to his illness.  Gorbachev vs. Romanov  Romanov was the second youngest member of the Politburo after Gorbachev. In the months preceding the death of Konstantin Chernenko in March 1985, Romanov and Gorbachev were commonly regarded to be chief rivals in the succession struggle for the post of General Secretary. Viktor Grishin was also considered a viable candidate. However, after Chernenko's death Gorbachev emerged with the strongest position to succeed Chernenko. Andrei Gromyko, one of the oldest and widely respected Politburo members, nominated Gorbachev for the position of General Secretary of CPSU, both at the March 11 meeting of Politburo and subsequently at the March 1985 Plenum (meeting) of the Central Committee of the CPSU.Brown, The Gorbachev Factor, p. 87. Neither Romanov nor Grishin mounted a formal challenge to Gorbachev's bid and the votes in favor of Gorbachev, both in the March 11 meeting of Politburo and at the March Plenum, were unanimous.  End of career  Gorbachev quickly moved to oust Grigory Vasilevich following his ascent to become General Secretary. He informed Romanov that he had no future under Gorbachev, and sacked him three months later. Grigory Vasilyevich was forced to retire from the Politburo on 1 July 1985. Romanov subsequently lived as a pensioner in Moscow. For several years he headed the \\"Association of Leningradians in Moscow\\". References *Archie Brown. The Gorbachev Factor.

Each monomer contains five cysteine residues, two zinc atoms and one magnesium atom crucial to its catalytic function, and it is optimally active at alkaline pH environments. ALP has the physiological role of dephosphorylating compounds. The enzyme is found across a multitude of organisms, prokaryotes and eukaryotes alike, with the same general function but in different structural forms suitable to the environment they function in. Alkaline phosphatase is found in the periplasmic space of E. coli bacteria. This enzyme is heat stable and has its maximum activity at high pH. In humans, it is found in many forms depending on its origin within the body ‚Äì it plays an integral role in metabolism within the liver and development within the skeleton. Due to its widespread prevalence in these areas, its concentration in the bloodstream is used by diagnosticians as a biomarker in helping determine diagnoses such as hepatitis or osteomalacia. The level of alkaline phosphatase in the blood is checked through the ALP test, which is often part of routine blood tests. The levels of this enzyme in the blood depend on factors such as age, sex, or blood type. Blood levels of alkaline phosphatase also increase by two to four times during pregnancy. This is a result of additional alkaline phosphatase produced by the placenta. Additionally, abnormal levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood could indicate issues relating to the liver, gall bladder or bones. Kidney tumors and infections as well as malnutrition have also shown abnormal level of alkaline phosphatase in blood. Alkaline phosphatase levels in a cell can be measured through a process called \\"The scoring method\\". A blood smear is usually taken and stained to categorize each leukocyte into specific \\"leukocyte alkaline phosphatase indices\\". This marker is designed to distinguish leukocytes and determine different enzyme activity from each sample's extent of staining. Bacterial In Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), alkaline phosphatase is located in the periplasmic space, external to the inner cell membrane and within the peptidoglycan portion of the cell wall. Since the periplasmic gap is more prone to environmental variation than the inner cell, alkaline phosphatase is suitably resistant to inactivation, denaturation, or degradation. This characteristic of the enzyme is uncommon to many other proteins. The precise structure and function of the four isozymes (Int in E.coli) are solely geared to supply a source of inorganic phosphate when the environment lacks this metabolite. The four enzymes are dependent upon the location of the tissue expression. The four sites of tissue expression are the Intestinal AlP, Placental ALP, Germ Cell ALP and Liver/Bone/Kidney ALP. The inorganic phosphates produced by these isozymes are then bound to carrier proteins which deliver the inorganic phosphates to a specific high-affinity transport system, known as the Pst system, which transports phosphate across the cytoplasmic membrane. While the outer membrane of E. coli contains porins that are permeable to phosphorylated compounds, the inner membrane does not. Then, an issue arises in how to transport such compounds across the inner membrane and into the cytosol. Surely, with the strong anionic charge of phosphate groups along with the remainder of the compound they are very much immiscible in the nonpolar region of the bilayer. The solution arises in cleaving the phosphate group away from the compound via ALP. In effect, along with the concomitant compound the phosphate was bound to, this enzyme yields pure inorganic phosphate which can be ultimately targeted by the phosphate-specific transport system (Pst system) for translocation into the cytosol. As such, the main purpose of dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase is to increase the rate of diffusion of the molecules into the cells and inhibit them from diffusing out. Alkaline phosphatase is a zinc-containing dimeric enzyme with the MW: 86,000 Da, each subunit containing 429 amino acids with four cysteine residues linking the two subunits. Alkaline phosphatase contains four Zn ions and two Mg ions, with Zn occupying active sites A and B, and Mg occupying site C, so the fully active native alkaline phosphatase is referred to as (ZnAZnBMgC)2 enzyme. The mechanism of action of alkaline phosphatase involves the geometric coordination of the substrate between the Zn ions in the active sites, whereas the Mg site doesn't appear to be close enough to directly partake in the hydrolysis mechanism, however, it may contribute to the shape of the electrostatic potential around the active center. Alkaline phosphatase has a Km of 8.4 x 10‚àí4. Alkaline phosphatase in E. coli is uncommonly soluble and active within elevated temperature conditions such as 80 ¬∞C. Due to the kinetic energy induced by this temperature the weak hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions of common proteins become degraded and therefore coalesce and precipitate. However, upon dimerization of ALP the bonds maintaining its secondary and tertiary structures are effectively buried such that they are not affected as much at this temperature. Furthermore, even at more elevated temperatures such as 90 ¬∞C ALP has the uncommon characteristic of reverse denaturation. Due to this, while ALP ultimately denatures at about 90 ¬∞C it has the added ability to accurately reform its bonds and return to its original structure and function once cooled back down. Alkaline phosphatase in E. coli is located in the periplasmic space and can thus be released using techniques that weaken the cell wall and release the protein. Due to the location of the enzyme, and the protein layout of the enzyme, the enzyme is in solution with a smaller amount of proteins than there are in another portion of the cell. The proteins' heat stability can also be taken advantage of when isolating this enzyme (through heat denaturation). In addition, alkaline phosphatase can be assayed using p-Nitrophenyl phosphate. A reaction where alkaline phosphatase dephosphorylates the non-specific substrate, p-Nitrophenyl phosphate in order to produce p-Nitrophenol(PNP) and inorganic phosphate. PNP's yellow color, and its Œªmax at 410 allows spectrophotometry to determine important information about enzymatic activity. Some complexities of bacterial regulation and metabolism suggest that other, more subtle, purposes for the enzyme may also play a role for the cell. In the laboratory, however, mutant Escherichia coli lacking alkaline phosphatase survive quite well, as do mutants unable to shut off alkaline phosphatase production. The optimal pH for the activity of the E. coli enzyme is 8.0 while the bovine enzyme optimum pH is slightly higher at 8.5. Alkaline phosphatase accounts for 6% of all proteins in derepressed cells. =Intragenic complementation= When multiple copies of a polypeptide encoded by a gene form an aggregate, this protein structure is referred to as a multimer. When a multimer is formed from polypeptides produced by two different mutant alleles of a particular gene, the mixed multimer may exhibit greater functional activity than the unmixed multimers formed by each of the mutants alone. In such a case, the phenomenon is referred to as intragenic complementation. E. coli alkaline phosphatase, a dimer enzyme, exhibits intragenic complementation. When particular mutant versions of alkaline phosphatase were combined, the heterodimeric enzymes formed as a result exhibited a higher level of activity than would be expected based on the relative activities of the parental enzymes. These findings indicated that the dimer structure of E.coli alkaline phosphatase allows cooperative interactions between the constituent monomers that can generate a more functional form of the holoenzyme. Use in research By changing the amino acids of the wild-type alkaline phosphatase enzyme produced by Escherichia coli, a mutant alkaline phosphatase is created which not only has a 36-fold increase in enzyme activity, but also retains thermal stability. Typical uses in the lab for alkaline phosphatases include removing phosphate monoesters to prevent self- ligation, which is undesirable during plasmid DNA cloning. Common alkaline phosphatases used in research include: * Shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP), from a species of Arctic shrimp (Pandalus borealis). This phosphatase is easily inactivated by heat, a useful feature in some applications. * Calf- intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) * Placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and its C terminally truncated version that lacks the last 24 amino acids (constituting the domain that targets for GPI membrane anchoring) ‚Äì the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP). It presents certain characteristics like heat stability, substrate specificity, and resistance to chemical inactivation. * Human-intestinal alkaline phosphatase. The human body has multiple types of alkaline phosphatase present, which are determined by a minimum of three gene loci. Each one of these three loci controls a different kind of alkaline phosphatase isozyme. However, the development of this enzyme can be strictly regulated by other factors such as thermostability, electrophoresis, inhibition, or immunology. Human-intestinal ALPase shows around 80% homology with bovine intestinal ALPase, which holds true their shared evolutionary origins. That same bovine enzyme has more than 70% homology with human placental enzyme. However, the human intestinal enzyme and the placental enzyme only share 20% homology despite their structural similarities. Alkaline phosphatase has become a useful tool in molecular biology laboratories, since DNA normally possesses phosphate groups on the 5' end. Removing these phosphates prevents the DNA from ligating (the 5' end attaching to the 3' end), thereby keeping DNA molecules linear until the next step of the process for which they are being prepared; also, removal of the phosphate groups allows radiolabeling (replacement by radioactive phosphate groups) in order to measure the presence of the labeled DNA through further steps in the process or experiment. For these purposes, the alkaline phosphatase from shrimp is the most useful, as it is the easiest to inactivate once it has done its job. Another important use of alkaline phosphatase is as a label for enzyme immunoassays. Undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells have elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase on their cell membrane, therefore alkaline phosphatase staining is used to detect these cells and to test pluripotency (i.e., embryonic stem cells or embryonal carcinoma cells). There is a positive correlation between serum bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) levels and bone formation in humans, although its use as a biomarker in clinical practice is not recommended. = Ongoing research= Current researchers are looking into the increase of tumor necrosis factor-Œ± and its direct effect on the expression of alkaline phosphatase in vascular smooth muscle cells as well as how alkaline phosphatase (AP) affects the inflammatory responses and may play a direct role in preventing organ damage. * Alkaline phosphatase (AP) affects the inflammatory responses in patients with Chronic kidney disease and is directly associated with Erythropoiesis stimulating agent resistant anemia. * Intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) and the mechanism it uses to regulate pH and ATP hydrolysis in rat duodenum. * Testing the effectiveness of the inhibitor and its impact on IAP in acute intestinal inflammation as well as explore the molecular mechanisms of IAP in \\"ameliorating intestinal permeability.\\" =Dairy industry= Alkaline phosphatase is commonly used in the dairy industry as an indicator of successful pasteurization. This is because the most heat stable bacterium found in milk, Mycobacterium paratuberculosis, is destroyed by temperatures lower than those required to denature ALP. Therefore, ALP presence is ideal for indicating failed pasteurization. Pasteurization verification is typically performed by measuring the fluorescence of a solution which becomes fluorescent when exposed to active ALP. Fluorimetry assays are required by milk producers in the UK to prove alkaline phosphatase has been denatured, as p-Nitrophenylphosphate tests are not considered accurate enough to meet health standards. Alternatively the colour change of a para-Nitrophenylphosphate substrate in a buffered solution (Aschaffenburg Mullen Test) can be used. Raw milk would typically produce a yellow colouration within a couple of minutes, whereas properly pasteurised milk should show no change. There are exceptions to this, as in the case of heat-stable alkaline phophatases produced by some bacteria, but these bacteria should not be present in milk. =Inhibitors= All mammalian alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes except placental (PALP and SEAP) are inhibited by homoarginine, and, in similar manner, all except the intestinal and placental ones are blocked by levamisole. Phosphate is another inhibitor which competitively inhibits alkaline phosphatase. Another known example of an alkaline phosphatase inhibitor is [(4-Nitrophenyl)methyl]phosphonic acid. In metal contaminated soil, alkaline phosphatase are inhibited by Cd (Cadmium). In addition, temperature enhances the inhibition of Cd on ALP activity, which is shown in the increasing values of Km. Human =Physiology= In humans, alkaline phosphatase is present in all tissues throughout the body, but is particularly concentrated in the liver, bile duct, kidney, bone, intestinal mucosa and placenta. In the serum, two types of alkaline phosphatase isozymes predominate: skeletal and liver. During childhood the majority of alkaline phosphatase are of skeletal origin. Humans and most other mammals contain the following alkaline phosphatase isozymes: * ALPI ‚Äì intestinal (molecular weight of 150 kDa) * ALPL ‚Äì tissue- nonspecific (expressed mainly in liver, bone, and kidney) * ALPP ‚Äì placental (Regan isozyme) * ALPG ‚Äì germ cell Four genes encode the four isozymes. The gene for tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase is located on chromosome 1, and the genes for the other three isoforms are located on chromosome 2.  Intestinal alkaline phosphatase  Intestinal alkaline phosphatase is secreted by enterocytes, and seems to play a pivotal role in intestinal homeostasis and protection as well as in mediation of inflammation via repression of the downstream Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4-dependent and MyD88-dependent inflammatory cascade. It dephosphorylates toxic/inflammatory microbial ligands like lipopolysaccharides, unmethylated cytosine-guanine dinucleotides, flagellin, and extracellular nucleotides such as uridine diphosphate or ATP. Thus, altered IAP expression has been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It also seems to regulate lipid absorption and bicarbonate secretion in the duodenal mucosa, which regulates the surface pH. =In cancer cells= Studies show that the alkaline phosphatase protein found in cancer cells is similar to that found in nonmalignant body tissues and that the protein originates from the same gene in both. One study compared the enzymes of liver metastases of giant-cell lung carcinoma and nonmalignant placental cells. The two were similar in NH2-terminal sequence, peptide map, subunit molecular weight, and isoelectronic point. In a different study in which scientists examined alkaline phosphatase protein presence in a human colon cancer cell line, also known as HT-29, results showed that the enzyme activity was similar to that of the non-malignant intestinal type. However, this study revealed that without the influence of sodium butyrate, alkaline phosphatase activity is fairly low in cancer cells. A study based on sodium butyrate effects on cancer cells conveys that it has an effect on androgen receptor co-regulator expression, transcription activity, and also on histone acetylation in cancer cells. This explains why the addition of sodium butyrate show increased activity of alkaline phosphatase in the cancer cells of the human colon. In addition, this further supports the theory that alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity is actually present in cancer cells. In another study, choriocarcinoma cells were grown in the presence of 5-bromo-2‚Äô-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) and results conveyed a 30- to 40- fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity. This procedure of enhancing the activity of the enzyme is known as enzyme induction. The evidence shows that there is in fact activity of alkaline phosphatase in tumor cells, but it is minimal and needs to be enhanced. Results from this study further indicate that activities of this enzyme vary among the different choriocarcinoma cell lines and that the activity of the alkaline phosphatase protein in these cells is lower than in the non-malignant placenta cells. but levels are significantly higher in children and pregnant women. Blood tests should always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that performed the test. High ALP levels can occur if the bile ducts are obstructed. Also, ALP increases if there is active bone formation occurring, as ALP is a byproduct of osteoblast activity (such as the case in Paget's disease of bone). ALP is much more elevated in metastatic prostate cancer cells than non-metastatic prostate cancer cells. High levels of ALP in prostate cancer patients is associated with a significant decrease in survival. Levels are also elevated in people with untreated coeliac disease. Lowered levels of ALP are less common than elevated levels. The source of elevated ALP levels can be deduced by obtaining serum levels of gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT). Concomitant increases of ALP with GGT should raise the suspicion of hepatobiliary disease. Some diseases do not affect the levels of alkaline phosphatase, for example, hepatitis C. A high level of this enzyme does not reflect any damage in the liver, even though high alkaline phosphatase levels may result from a blockage of flow in the biliary tract or an increase in the pressure of the liver. = Elevated levels = If it is unclear why alkaline phosphatase is elevated, isoenzyme studies using electrophoresis can confirm the source of the ALP. Skelphosphatase (which is localized in osteoblasts and extracellular layers of newly synthesized matrix) is released into circulation by a yet unclear mechanism. Placental alkaline phosphatase is elevated in seminomas and active forms of rickets, as well as in the following diseases and conditions: * Biliary obstruction * Bone conditions * Osteoblastic bone tumors * Osteomalacia * Osteoporosis * Hepatitis * Cirrhosis *Acute cholecystitis *Myelofibrosis * Leukemoid reaction * Lymphoma * Paget's disease * Sarcoidosis *Hyperthyroidism * Hyperparathyroidism * Myocardial infarction * Pregnancy = Lowered levels = The following conditions or diseases may lead to reduced levels of alkaline phosphatase: * Hypophosphatasia, an autosomal recessive disease * Postmenopausal women receiving estrogen therapy because of aging * Men with recent heart surgery, malnutrition, magnesium deficiency, or severe anemia * Children with achondroplasia and congenital iodine deficiency * Children after a severe episode of enteritis * Pernicious anemia * Aplastic anemia * Wilson's disease * Hypothyroidism In addition, oral contraceptives have been demonstrated to reduce alkaline phosphatase. = Prognostic uses = Measuring alkaline phosphatase (along with prostate specific antigen) during, and after six months of hormone treated metastatic prostate cancer was shown to predict the survival of patients.  Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase  Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) is found within mature white blood cells. White blood cell levels of LAP can help in the diagnosis of certain conditions. * Higher levels are seen in the physiological response, the leukemoid reaction, and in pathologies that include mature white blood cells, such as polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and in primary myelofibrosis (PM). * Lower levels are found in pathologies that involve undeveloped leukocytes, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). = Structure and properties = Alkaline phosphatase is homodimeric enzyme, meaning it is formed with two molecules. Three metal ions, two Zn and one Mg, are contained in the catalytic sites, and both types are crucial for enzymatic activity to occur. The enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of monoesters in phosphoric acid which can additionally catalyze a transphosphorylation reaction with large concentrations of phosphate acceptors. While the main features of the catalytic mechanism and activity are conserved between mammalian and bacterial alkaline phosphate, mammalian alkaline phosphatase has a higher specific activity and Km values thus a lower affinity, more alkaline pH optimum, lower heat stability, and are typically membrane bound and are inhibited by l-amino acids and peptides via a means of uncompetitive mechanism. These properties noticeably differ between different mammalian alkaline phosphatase isozymes and therefore showcase a difference in in vivo functions. Alkaline phosphatase has homology in a large number of other enzymes and composes part of a superfamily of enzymes with several overlapping catalytic aspects and substrate traits. This explains why most salient structural features of mammalian alkaline are the way they are and reference their substrate specificity and homology to other members of the nucleoside pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family of isozyme. Research has shown a relationship between members of the alkaline phosphatase family with aryl sulfatases. The similarities in structure indicate that these two enzyme families came from a common ancestor. Further analysis has linked alkaline phosphates and aryl sulfatases to a larger superfamily. Some of the common genes found in this superfamily, are ones that encode phosphodiesterases as well as autotoxin.

Henri-Joseph Paixhans (; January 22, 1783, Metz ‚Äì August 22, 1854, Jouy-aux-Arches) was a French artillery officer of the beginning of the 19th century. Henri-Joseph Paixhans graduated from the √âcole Polytechnique. He fought in the Napoleonic Wars, was the representative (D√©put√©) for the Moselle department between 1830 and 1848, and became \\"General de Division\\" in 1848. In 1823, he invented the first shell guns, which came to be called Paixhans guns (or \\"canon-obusiers\\" in the French Navy). Paixhans guns became the first naval guns to combine explosive shells and a flat trajectory, thereby triggering the demise of wooden ships, and the iron hull revolution in shipbuilding. Paixhans also invented a \\"Mortier monstre\\" (\\"Monster Mortar\\"), using 500 kg bombs, which was used to terrible effect in the Siege of Antwerp in 1832. He was also a naval theorist claiming that a few aggressively armed small units could destroy the largest naval units of the time, making him a precursor of the French \\"Jeune √âcole\\" school of thought. The poet Victor Hugo wrote: :\\"Terre! l'obus est Dieu, Paixhans est son proph√®te.\\" : (\\"Earth! the shell is God, Paixhans is his Prophet.\\")  Paixhans naval guns  A Paixhans gun. Paixhans developed a delaying mechanism which, for the first time, allowed shells to be fired safely in high-powered flat-trajectory guns. The effect of explosive shells hitting wooden hulls and setting them aflame was devastating, and was demonstrated in trials against the two-decker Pacificateur in 1824. The first Paixhans guns were founded in 1841. The barrel of the guns weighed about 10,000 pounds, and proved accurate to about two miles. In the 1840s, France, England, Russia and the United States had adopted the new naval guns. The effect of the guns in an operational context was first demonstrated during the actions at Eckernf√∂rde in 1849 during the First Schleswig war, and especially at the Battle of Sinop in 1853 during the Crimean War.  Legacy  = Ironclad warships = Wooden boats became so vulnerable that the only possible response could come with the introduction of the iron-hulled warship. The first of them was the French La Gloire, which was a wooden ship with iron sheathing. She was soon followed by HMS Warrior, which was iron-hulled with wooden backing. = Further developments = The \\"Paixhans\\" barracks in Le Mans, France. Paixhans's design was later improved by the American John A. Dahlgren, who wrote: = Floating batteries = The floating battery Paixhans (1862). A class of floating batteries named after Paixhans was developed by Henri Dupuy de L√¥me. Four of these ships were launched between 1861 and 1862.

The melody is very simple, consisting mainly of descending half steps, but the unusual harmonies and difficult tremolos create an intense, fiery luminance. This piece was intended to be Scriabin's eleventh sonata; however, he had to publish it early because of financial concerns. Hence, the piece is labelled a poem, rather than a sonata. According to pianist Vladimir Horowitz, the piece was inspired by Scriabin's eccentric conviction that a constant accumulation of heat would ultimately cause the destruction of the world.Horowitz in television footage included in \\"Horowitz: A Reminiscence\\", TV broadcast 1993. Released as Kultur Films DVD 2007. The piece's title reflects the earth's fiery destruction, and the constant emotional buildup and crescendo throughout the piece lead, ultimately, \\"toward the flame\\".

He was widely known by the nickname Dr. Foth and styled himself as \\"the Great Gatheringfroth\\". He was described as \\"never at a loss for words\\". Early life Fotheringham was born in Hearne, Saskatchewan, on August 31, 1932. His father died from an appendectomy gone wrong when he was two, and his mother remarried, with Allan taking his stepfather's surname Fotheringham. He attended Chilliwack Secondary School, where he was active in student leadership and wrote for the school's paper, as well as the Chilliwack Progress. Upon graduation he studied English and political science at the University of British Columbia and worked at a variety of media outlets during his career. He was best known as a columnist, originally at the Ubyssey, a student newspaper. He was hired straight out of university by the Vancouver Sun during the heady times of the late 1960s, the final days of the old Bennett Socreds provincially and the advent of Pierre Trudeau federally. Fotheringham's columns and commentaries brought him national attention as well as wider syndication and a broader subject base. He was one of the leading specialists in explaining the world of British Columbia politics during his time at the Sun. Career Fotheringham wrote for Maclean's starting in October 1975. His column appeared on the back page of the magazine for 27 years, and was so widely read and so influential that he is said to have made Maclean's the magazine people read \\"from back to front\\". Consequently, he dubbed a collection of them as \\"Last Page First\\". Some of his more memorable political nicknames include \\"the brogue that walks and talks like a man\\" (for Jack Webster) and its offspring, \\"the jaw that walks and talks like a man\\" (for Brian Mulroney). He is credited with coining the terms \\"Natural Governing Party\\" for the federal Liberals, and the \\"Holy Mother Corporation\\" for the CBC in the course of writing his column. His columns occasionally opened with the exclamation \\"Zowie, Dr. Foth!\\" Fotheringham was a regular panelist for a decade in the latter years of the CBC Television program Front Page Challenge, having replaced the deceased Gordon Sinclair in 1984. He also wrote columns for the Toronto Sun for fourteen years until 2000. In 2001, Maclean's underwent an editorial revamp, and Fotheringham's column was moved to an inside page to make room for a guest column. Soon afterward, Fotheringham left Maclean's, and became a columnist for The Globe and Mail. He had a national syndicated column that was in 20 newspapers, but he retired from regular contributions in 2007, after life-threatening complications from a colonoscopy led to him being hospitalized for five months. Fotheringham continued to write occasionally for the Globe and for the National Post, as well as a Calgary magazine called The Roughneck. Later years Fotheringham had honorary degrees from the University of New Brunswick (2003) and the University of Saskatchewan (2005). He died on August 19, 2020, at his home in Toronto. He was 12 days short of his 88th birthday. Although the cause of death has not yet been determined, his wife noted that he was in \\"generally poor health\\" in the time leading up to his death.  Invented terms  Affectionately known as \\"Foth\\" as well as \\"Dr. Foth\\", he dubbed himself \\"the Great Gatheringfroth\\", and coined some well-known terms in British Columbian political history: * Lotusland ‚Äì British Columbia, particularly Victoria * the Granite Curtain ‚Äì the Rocky Mountains * the Tweed Curtain ‚Äì the Oak Bay, British Columbia- Victoria border, referring to the former's conservative British character * \\"the Brogue that walks and talks like a man\\" ‚Äì journalist and broadcaster Jack Webster (who had many nicknames, not all of them Foth's).

She is currently a Fox News contributor, and was previously a CNN contributor until her resignation in October 2016, after leaking CNN's debate questions to Hillary Clinton's campaign in the 2016 United States presidential election. A member of the Democratic Party, Brazile was the first African American woman to direct a major presidential campaign, acting as campaign manager for Al Gore in 2000. She has also worked on several presidential campaigns for Democratic candidates, including Jesse Jackson and Walter Mondale‚ÄìGeraldine Ferraro in 1984, and for Dick Gephardt in the 1988 Democratic primary. She served as the acting chair of the Democratic National Committee in spring 2011, and again from July 2016 to February 2017. Early life Brazile was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the daughter of Jean Marie (Brown) and Lionel Joseph Brazile, the third of nine children. Her family's surname was \\"Braswell\\" several generations back. Brazile became interested in politics at the age of nine when a local candidate for office promised to build a neighborhood playground. She participated in a TRIO Upward Bound program while in high school. Brazile earned a bachelor's degree in industrial psychology from Louisiana State University (LSU) in 1981, and was a fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. After graduating from LSU, Brazile worked for several advocacy groups in Washington, D.C., and was reportedly instrumental in the successful campaign to make Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a federal holiday. Brazile volunteered for the Jimmy Carter‚ÄìWalter Mondale presidential campaign of 1976 as a teenager and for their 1980 presidential campaign while a student at LSU. Political strategist Brazile has worked on several presidential campaigns for Democratic candidates, including Jesse Jackson in 1984, Walter Mondale‚ÄìGeraldine Ferraro in 1984, and Dick Gephardt in the 1988 Democratic primary. After Gephardt lost the primary in 1988, Brazile served as deputy field director of the Michael Dukakis general election campaign. On October 20, 1988, she made headlines by telling a group of reporters that George H. W. Bush needed to \\"fess up\\" about unsubstantiated rumors of an extramarital affair. Said Brazile, \\"The American people have every right to know if Barbara Bush will share that bed with him in the White House.\\" The Dukakis campaign immediately disavowed her remarks and Dukakis fired her from his campaign staff shortly after the story broke. Four years later, the same issue, the relationship of George H. W. Bush and Jennifer Fitzgerald, would be briefly rehashed during the 1992 campaign against Bill Clinton, who had his own extramarital affair rumors. In the 1990s, Brazile served as chief of staff and press secretary to Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District of Columbia, where she helped guide the District's budget and local legislation on Capitol Hill. She also served as an advisor for Bill Clinton's campaign for the presidency in 1992 and for re-election in 1996. In 1999, Brazile was appointed deputy campaign manager and was later promoted to campaign manager of the 2000 presidential campaign of Vice-President Al Gore, becoming the first African-American woman to manage a major party presidential campaign. After the Hurricane Katrina disaster, Brazile was appointed as a member of the board of directors of the Louisiana Recovery Authority by Kathleen Blanco from 2005 to 2009. Brazile donated her papers to the Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections in the Louisiana State University Libraries Special Collections, located in Hill Memorial Library. Democratic National Committee service After the post-election fight over votes in the 2000 United States presidential election in Florida, Brazile was appointed chair of the Democratic National Committee's Voting Rights Institute. =2008 presidential election= In the 2008 election, she served as a superdelegate for her work for Bill Clinton and Al Gore. As a delegate for the Democratic National Convention, Brazile consistently refrained from declaring her preferred Democratic presidential candidate. In an interview with political satirist Stephen Colbert, Brazile stated, \\"Look, I'm a woman, so I like Hillary. I'm black; I like Obama. But I'm also grumpy, so I like John McCain.\\" The 2008 Democratic presidential primaries in Florida and Michigan initially caused the delegates from these two states to be disqualified from being seated at the Democratic Convention due to the states moving their primaries against DNC Party rules. Brazile stated, \\"We need to send a message that you can't defy the rules,\\" adding, \\"I have pissed off just about every state in my career.\\" At the Rules Committee meeting to decide on the final allocations for these states she was quoted: \\"My momma taught me to play by the rules and respect those rules. My mother taught me, and I'm sure your mother taught you, that when you decide to change the rules, middle of the game, end of the game, that is referred to as cheating.\\" She was strongly critical of the Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment, which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 Affordable Health Care for America Act. =2012 presidential election= For several weeks in the spring of 2011, she served as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee. As vice-chair of the DNC, she led the organization during the transition between outgoing chair Tim Kaine, who resigned to run for the U.S. Senate, and his successor, Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was not permitted to ascend to the post until at least fifteen days after being nominated on April 5, 2011. Following Wasserman Schultz's installation as DNC chair, Brazile returned to her post as vice-chair. =2016 presidential election= Brazile campaigns for Hillary Clinton at Nashua Community College in New Hampshire, October 7, 2016. After Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned her position as chairperson of the Democratic National Committee on July 24, 2016, at the start of the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Brazile became interim chairperson of the DNC.[73] Brazile was responsible for a plan to spend money to drive up inner- city turnout in places like Chicago and New Orleans ‚Äî even though neither Illinois nor Louisiana was competitive ‚Äî because of fear that Clinton would win the Electoral College vote but lose the popular vote. Sharing debate questions with Clinton campaign A WikiLeaks e-mail dump revealed that Brazile sent an e-mail message on March 5, 2016, to John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri with the title: \\"One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash.\\" The message continued, \\"her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl of Flint.\\" At the next event in Flint, Clinton was delivered a similar question from audience member Mikki Wade, whose family was affected by the poisoned water. On October 11, 2016, a WikiLeaks e-mail dump included an e-mail Brazile sent on March 12, 2016 to Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri with the subject header: \\"From time to time I get questions in advance.\\" In the e-mail, Brazile discussed her concern about Clinton's ability to field a question regarding the death penalty, and in a CNN town hall debate the following day, Clinton received a similar question about the death penalty. According to tech blog Errata Security, the e-mail in question was verified using an everyday verification program and the DKIM system. Brazile at first vehemently denied receiving or furnishing the Clinton campaign with any town hall questions and dismissed the Wikileaks organization as \\"these sad ass whipper leakers try to slow my groove\\". She accused TYT Politics reporter Jordan Chariton of \\"badgering a woman.\\" Questioned by Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, Brazile said, \\"As a Christian woman, I understand persecution. I will not sit here and be persecuted because your information is totally false.\\" Jake Tapper, a former colleague of Brazile's at CNN, provided his perspective on the possibility of a leak of a question to a Presidential candidate, calling it \\"very, very upsetting\\" and added that \\"journalistically, it's horrifying\\". Brazile, however, said that her conscience was \\"very clear\\". She later commented: \\"If I had to do it all over again, I would know a hell of a lot more about cybersecurity.\\" In a talk at the College of Journalism and Mass Communications on the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln campus on October 12, 2016, Brazile condemned the leaks, which intelligence officials said came from Russia, were to \\"manipulate an election, disrupt or discredit or destroy our democracy\\" and ultimately try to \\"produce an outcome more favorable to them and their interests,\\" Brazile said. On October 31, 2016, The New York Times reported: \\"CNN has severed ties with the Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, after hacked e-mails from WikiLeaks showed that she shared questions for CNN- sponsored candidate events in advance with friends on Hillary Clinton's campaign.\\" CNN said it had accepted her formal resignation on October 14, adding: \\"We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.\\" On November 1, 2016, an internal call about the collusion was initiated by CNN President Jeff Zucker. Zucker informed his staff that, while the instances have been fully investigated and the perpetrators dealt with, the perception that campaigns could receive questions in advance \\"hurts all of us,\\" adding that, \\"I have no tolerance for her behavior or that kind of behavior,\\" going on to describe former network commentator Brazile's interactions with the Clinton campaign as \\"unethical\\" and \\"disgusting.\\" On March 17, 2017, Brazile admitted to forwarding debate questions to Clinton's campaign during the 2016 Democratic primary, while she was Vice Chair of the DNC and working as a CNN commentator. In an essay she wrote for Time magazine, she said, \\"Then in October, a subsequent release of e-mails revealed that among the many things I did in my role as a Democratic operative and D.N.C. Vice Chair prior to assuming the interim D.N.C. Chair position was to share potential town hall topics with the Clinton campaign.\\" Brazile went on to explain: \\"My job was to make all our Democratic candidates look good, and I worked closely with both campaigns to make that happen. But sending those e-mails was a mistake I will forever regret.\\" In her 2017 memoir Hacks, Brazile wrote about her \\"alleged leaking of the questions.\\" Other work =University teaching and affiliations= Brazile served as a lecturer at the University of Maryland, College Park, a fellow at Harvard University's Institute of Politics, and is an Adjunct Professor of Women and Gender Studies at Georgetown University. She is member of the advisory board of the Washington and Lee University Mock Convention. =Commentator= Brazile was a weekly contributor and political commentator on CNN's The Situation Room and appeared on American Morning and its successor, New Day. She regularly appeared on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon, and was a frequent member of Anderson Cooper's guest panel of political experts on CNN's Election Night Coverage. Brazile is also founder and managing director of Brazile and Associates and a contributor to NPR's Political Corner and ABC News. Brazile had agreed mutually with both CNN and ABC to suspend her contracts with the networks in order to serve as interim chair of the DNC. On October 31, 2016, CNN announced that Brazile offered a formal resignation and that they were permanently severing their ties to Brazile as a CNN contributor, due to inappropriate leaks with the Clinton campaign while she worked for the network. On March 18, 2019, Brazile became a contributor for Fox News. She stated that she was \\"delighted to be joining FOX News\\" while acknowledging her decision may be criticized by other Democrats. =Author= Brazile was a contributing writer for Ms. Magazine and a columnist for Roll Call. In 2004, Simon & Schuster published Cooking With Grease ‚Äì Stirring the Pots in American Politics, Brazile's memoir of her life and work in politics. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal of The New York Times, \\"While the book is primarily a charming autobiography about how a poor black girl came to run a presidential campaign, its publication is giving the refreshingly impolitic Ms. Brazile the opportunity to pour forth in writing and in interviews on larger issues, like what went wrong in 2000 and what the Democrats need to do to win in 2004.\\" Brazile is also the coauthor‚Äîwith Yolanda Caraway, Leah Daughtry, and Minyon Moore‚Äîof For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics (2018), a joint history and biography. Hacks: The Inside Story In July 2017, Hachette Books announced that it had acquired the rights to Brazile's forthcoming book, Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House, published on November 7, 2017. Hachette said the book would be \\"equal parts campaign thriller, memoir, and roadmap for the future.\\" Matt Latimer and Keith Urbahn, partners at the literary and creative agency Javelin, represented Brazile in negotiations with Hachette. The work is \\"a savage memoir of her experiences with Clinton's campaign, which she describes as mismanaged and lacking in passion.\\"Philip Rucker, Brazile says she found 'no evidence' that Democratic primaries were rigged for Clinton, Washington Post (November 5, 2017). In an excerpt of the book published in Politico magazine, Brazile wrote that she had found an \\"unethical agreement\\" between the Clinton campaign and the DNC which had allowed Clinton to exert control of the party long before she became its nominee. Later, in an interview on ABC's This Week on November 5, 2017, Brazile said that she had found no evidence of the Democratic primaries having been rigged in favor of Clinton. Brazile writes that after Clinton fainted at a 9/11 memorial service on September 11, 2016, she gave serious consideration to replacing Clinton as the Democratic nominee, selecting Vice President Joe Biden in her place. Under the DNC charter, the party chair can declare a presidential nominee \\"disabled,\\" triggering a complex replacement process that involves a meeting of the full DNC. In the interview on ABC, she explained that she \\"had a lot of other combinations. This is something you play out in your mind.\\" On November 4, 2017, more than 100 former Clinton campaign staffers published an open letter saying they \\"do not recognize the campaign she portrays in the book.\\" They said they were shocked to learn that Brazile had considered replacing Clinton on the ticket and dismayed that Brazile had seemingly bought into \\"false Russian-fueled propaganda\\" about Clinton's health. The credibility of Brazile's allegations also came under scrutiny by The Washington Post. In September 2015, the newspaper had already reported about the fundraising agreement between Hillary and the DNC which Brazile disclosed and noted that Sanders supporters knew about it. It was also reported that Brazile knew about the agreement before she publicly disclosed its details. =Acting= Brazile is a member of Screen Actors Guild‚ÄêAmerican Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) and has guest-starred as herself in three episodes of the CBS drama The Good Wife and one episode of the Netflix drama House of Cards. Personal life In 1999, The New York Times Magazine described Brazile as an LGBT activist who served on the board of the Millennium March on Washington. The magazine said she is \\"highly protective of her privacy\\" and called her \\"openly ambiguous\\" about her sexual orientation. Brazile is a Catholic and said she wanted to be a priest as a child but did not pursue this after her mother told her girls could not be priests.

Early life Sinclair was born in the Cabbagetown neighbourhood of Toronto, Ontario, the son of George Alexander and Bessie Goldie (n√©e Eesley) Sinclair. In 1916, before finishing his first year of high school, Sinclair dropped out to take a job with the Bank of Nova Scotia. After a few months, he was fired and started working in the administrative office of Eaton's. During World War I, Sinclair served as a part-time soldier in a militia unit of the 48th Highlanders of Canada.Scott Young, Gordon Sinclair: A Life ... And Then Some, Macmillan of Canada, p. 26. After being fired from Eaton's, Sinclair took a junior bookkeeping job with Gutta Percha and Rubber Manufacturing Company, starting in April 1920. It was there that he met co-worker Gladys Prewett. After an off-and-on relationship, the two were married on May 8, 1926. International reporter for the Star Early in 1922, Sinclair applied for a reporting job at all four Toronto newspapers.Scott Young, Gordon Sinclair: A Life ... And Then Some, Macmillan of Canada, p. 35. The only offer he received was from the Toronto Star, where Sinclair started working in February 1922, hired on the same day as Foster Hewitt, who was the son of the Star's sports editor. Sinclair was given routine assignments at the Star for seven years before he received his first byline.Scott Young, Gordon Sinclair: A Life ... And Then Some, Macmillan of Canada, p. 36. His breakthrough was a series of articles written after living among a group of homeless people, which Sinclair called \\"Toronto's hobo club\\"\\"Star reporter sees life as member of 'hobo' club,\\" Gordon A. Sinclair, Toronto Star, July 6, 1929, p. 1. From that point, Sinclair rose to become one of the paper's star reporters, spending most of the next decade travelling the world, filing reports from exotic locations. During an Asian tour in 1932, Sinclair spent four months in India and, after returning home, wrote his first book, Foot-loose in India. It was published in October 1932 and became a best- seller in Canada, with the first edition selling out on the first day of release.\\"Sinclair public buys out first edition in one day,\\" Toronto Star, October 13, 1932, p. 9. Before the end of the year, Sinclair announced that his next trip would be to Southeast Asia. A public farewell was held on January 13, 1933, filling Massey Hall, with the Star estimating that an additional 6,500 people were turned away.\\"Toronto made history with a thunderous adieu given Gordon Sinclair,\\" Frederick Griffin, Toronto Star, January 14, 1933, p. 1. His experiences on that trip were collected in Sinclair's second book, Cannibal Quest, which was a best-seller in Canada and also reached No. 9 on the U.S. best-seller list.Scott Young, Gordon Sinclair: A Life ... And Then Some, Macmillan of Canada, p. 84. That was followed by a series from Devil's Island, which was also turned into a book, Loose Among the Devils, published in 1935. Later that year, Sinclair was fired by the Star after failing to get the story on the outbreak of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War in Ethiopia.Scott Young, Gordon Sinclair: A Life ... And Then Some, Macmillan of Canada, p. 110. The Star reported that Sinclair was leaving journalism to take a job in advertising.\\"Gordon Sinclair on staff of advertising company,\\" Toronto Star, December 19, 1935, p. 15. The Star wrote that Sinclair had travelled 340,000 miles in 73 countries for the newspaper. At the time, he was working on his fourth book, Khyber Caravan, based on his travels in Afghanistan. Doubts were frequently raised by readers that Sinclair had actually experienced the incidents he reported.Scott Young, Gordon Sinclair: A Life ... And Then Some, Macmillan of Canada, p. 83. His Khyber series was so widely questioned that the Star assigned another reporter to investigate Sinclair's claims. Sinclair's time away from journalism was short- lived. Three months after joining the staff of Maclaren Advertising, Sinclair returned to the Star, this time as a sports columnist. Sinclair was hired shortly after the sudden death of Star sports editor Lou Marsh, who had been one of Canada's best-known sports journalists. According to sportswriter Scott Young, Sinclair's transition to sports was \\"monumentally unsuccessful.\\"Scott Young, Gordon Sinclair: A Life ... And Then Some, Macmillan of Canada, p. 116. After a year in sports, Sinclair returned to general reporting and late in 1938 he again went on an Asian tour. He remained at home during the Second World War and was not accredited as a war correspondent. CFRB and Front Page Challenge Following the unsuccessful Dieppe Raid in 1942, Sinclair was asked by Red Foster, a news broadcaster at Toronto radio station CFRB, to provide some narration for a broadcast on Canadians at Dieppe. Sinclair ended up writing the story as well as reading it on the air, and continued to contribute brief reports to the station. Several months after he started, his radio work came to the attention of his bosses at the Star, which had a policy prohibiting its reporters from regularly writing reports for other outlets. Once again, Sinclair was fired.Scott Young, Gordon Sinclair: A Life ... And Then Some, Macmillan of Canada, p. 134. In February 1943, he formally joined the CFRB team, becoming part-owner of the station the following year. He would continue to be associated with CFRB for over 40 years until his death. Sinclair in 1964 He returned to the Star in 1949, this time as a freelancer, for one final international tour, which included his coverage of the end of the Berlin Blockade. He remained a contributor to the paper, writing a radio and TV column, until December 1962. In 1957, Sinclair also began a career in television, as a panelist on the CBC Television series Front Page Challenge. He would hold that position for 27 years until his death. While Sinclair was often controversial, he caused an uproar in 1969 when he asked Canadian Olympic swimmer Elaine Tanner if menstruation interfered with her training. Sinclair was a vocal opponent of water fluoridation (calling it \\"rat poison\\" in 1958), the singing of God Save the Queen, medicare and taxes. Although he was raised as a Methodist and taught Bible class as a youth, Sinclair became a forceful critic of religion and the church. \\"I had 31 years of being a Christian, and it was enough,\\" he said in 1969. Sinclair had invested his earnings in the Depression-era stock market and was independently wealthy by the end of the Second World War. In 1960, he boasted that he earned more than $50,000 a year.\\"Controversial 'Sinc' was common man at heart,\\" Toronto Star, May 18, 1984, p. A15. By the end of his life, Sinclair reportedly had liquid assets of more than $2 million.\\"Veteran journalist scorned hypocrisy, boasted of wealth,\\" The Globe and Mail, May 18, 1984, p. 16. He bought a Rolls-Royce in 1961 and drove it for 11 years. Sinclair's autobiography, Will the Real Gordon Sinclair Please Stand Up was published in 1966, followed in 1975 by a sequel, Will Gordon Sinclair Please Sit Down.  The Americans  On June 5, 1973, following news that the American Red Cross had run out of money as a result of aid efforts for recent natural disasters, Sinclair recorded what would become his most famous radio editorial, \\"The Americans.\\" While paying tribute to American success, ingenuity, and generosity to people in need abroad, Sinclair decried that when America faced crisis itself, it often seemed to face that crisis alone. At the time, Sinclair considered the piece to be nothing more than one of his usual items. But when U.S. News & World Report published a full transcript, the magazine was flooded with requests for copies.\\"Sinclair soothes a suffering U.S.,\\" Bruce Garvey, Toronto Star, November 28, 1973, p. A1. Radio station WWDC-AM in Washington, D.C., started playing a recording of Sinclair's commentary with \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" playing in the background. Sinclair told the Star in November 1973 that he had received 8,000 letters about his commentary. With the strong response generated by the editorial, a recording of Sinclair's commentary was sold as a single with all profits going to the American Red Cross. \\"The Americans (A Canadian's Opinion)\\" went to No. 24 on the Billboard Hot 100, making the 73-year-old Sinclair the second-oldest living person ever to have a Billboard U.S. Top 40 hit (75-year-old Moms Mabley had a Top 40 hit in 1969 with \\"Abraham, Martin & John\\"). A transcript of the commentary was also recorded by Byron MacGregor, news director of Windsor, Ontario, radio station CKLW (AM), and it became an even bigger hit in the U.S., climbing to No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Sinclair was said to be annoyed by MacGregor's recording, which was released as a single before Sinclair's authorized version.\\"Gordon Sinclair annoyed\\" (subhead), Sid Adilman, Toronto Star, December 19, 1973, p. E10. At the time, CKLW was owned by Toronto media baron John Bassett. In Canada, Sinclair's version peaked at No. 30, topping McGregor's, which missed the top 40, stalling at No. 42. In May 1974, Sinclair told The Globe and Mail that he was \\"sick of hearing\\" the recording and embarrassed by some of the inaccuracies it contained,\\"3 golden minutes,\\" Martin O'Malley, The Globe and Mail, May 23, 1974, pp. 1‚Äì2. but that he would still write the same editorial over again. In 1981, when Ronald Reagan made his first state visit to Canada, he praised Sinclair as a figure who had given the United States a wonderful and inspiring tribute in one of its darkest hours. The Americans was widely revived on the Internet, radio and newspapers in 2001, following the September 11, 2001, attacks, and again in 2005 in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Some revivals of the message incorrectly state that it was newly written as a direct response to recent crises; in this question of its authorship alone, the address has become a part of urban legend.Snopes ‚Äì The Americans  Final years and death  Sinclair was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1979, and added to the Etobicoke Hall of Fame in 1984. Up to the time of his death, he was doing 14 broadcasts a week for CFRB and also appearing on Front Page Challenge. In his final commentary, broadcast on May 15, 1984, he discussed passing his annual driver's test, which was compulsory for drivers over the age of 80. That day, Sinclair‚Äîwho had had a series of heart attacks dating back to 1970‚Äîhad a massive attack, going into a coma and suffering irreversible brain damage. He died two days later at age 83 after life support systems were discontinued. He was buried at Park Lawn Cemetery in Toronto. Sinclair's eldest son, Gord Sinclair (1928‚Äì2002), was also a successful and respected radio journalist in Montreal, as well as the majority owner of CFOX (AM).Sinclair, Gordon Arthur \\"Gord\\" Jr. The History of Canadian Broadcasting.

The show was filmed in Canada, but the program was set in America. It ran for two seasons, and spawned a number of merchandising products. The programme featured live actors interacting with computer animated characters from a fictional video game. The series is significant in that until its creation, live action and CGI had not been attempted to such a huge and constant degree within a weekly television serial.  Series overview  The series follows the life of British teenager Mark Hollander who moved to the American town Conestoga Hills with his parents. One stormy night, Mark plays his favourite video game, the fictional Ace Lightning and the Carnival of Doom - a superhero-based adventure game where hero Ace Lightning traverses the Carnival of Doom to find the pieces of the magical Amulet of Zoar, whilst battling his nemesis Lord Fear. Mark stumbles across a mysterious seventh level which is not meant to exist. A lightning bolt strikes the antenna on his roof, and through an electrical surge, the characters of the game come to life. Ace hires Mark as his sidekick to fulfil the game's objectives in the real world. Mark's life is turned upside-down, and his duty as a Lightning Knight affects his school grades and social life, often forcing him to make excuses to his family and friends. Meanwhile, Lord Fear's group of villains occupy the town's rundown Kent Bros. Carnival. Most episodes balanced Mark's social issues and dealing with the game characters, and the animated characters fighting over the collected Amulet pieces. The world and rules of the game played out in Conestoga Hill; for example when two pieces of the Amulet were connected, a new character or weapon would be summoned. Four human characters learned of Mark's double life including his best friend Chuck Mugel, girlfriend Kat Adams, school teacher Mr. Cheseborough who comes to the belief that the characters are aliens, and Mark's cousin Ashley. Another character who is aware of the goings on is Duff Kent, the owner of the carnival who is shanghaied into being a minion for Lord Fear. An ongoing story was the love triangle between Ace and villain Lady Illusion, who was Lord Fear's mistress throughout the first season but betrays him in the finale. The first season ended with Mark winning the game, with all the antagonists save Lady Illusion returning to the game world. In the second season, Chuck becomes Ace's secondary sidekick, and all of the villains return under the leadership of a new antagonist named Kilobyte. Kilobyte was created by Rick Hummel, a computer repairman and former games developer who took on the alias the \\"Master Programmer\\". Rick developed the program that brought the game to life, but was ridiculed and fired as a result. He desired to prove his worth by bringing the characters to life and ultimately conquering the world. A blackout in his shop allows Kilobyte to become independent, determined to rule the world. In the series finale, Ace and Lord Fear join forces and banish Kilobyte to the game world. However, Lord Fear turns on Ace and mortally wounds him, only to reveal that Lady Illusion took his place, and she dies in Ace's arms.  Characters  The cast of characters balances live human characters who lives in the town of Conestoga Hills, and computer-generated characters from the fictional video game Ace Lightning and the Carnival of Doom. The main protagonist is 13-year-old Mark Hollander (Thomas Wansey), a British teenager who immigrates from the United Kingdom with his parents. He wants a normal life, but the antics of the video game characters disrupts his friendships, grades, and social life. He often interacts with his school friends and trying to keep them in the dark. His best friend Chuck Mugel (Marc Minardi) is an avid fan of the game, and becomes Ace's secondary sidekick in the second season. Mark has three girlfriends during the series - next door neighbour Samantha Thompson (Shadia Simmons) who moves to a private school in the second season, gossip girl Heather Hoffs (Petra Wildgoose), and headstrong Kat Adams (Ashley Leggat) who wants to be a journalist. The titular character, Ace Lightning (Michael Riley), is a superhero from the Sixth Dimension and a member of the authoritarian organization known as the Lightning Knights. He starts off as a snarky, courageous hero who does not understand much about human relations or their culture, but over time evolves into a better person. He starts secretly dating Lady Illusion (Tamara Bernier Evans), a shapeshifting villainess who is mistress of the main antagonist Lord Fear (Juan Chioran). The love triangle between the three is a main storyline in the series. Lord Fear himself is a lich who was crippled by Ace in the past and wishes to use the magical Amulet of Zoar to conquer the world. He leads a small band of minions and operates from the Carnival of Doom, actually a rundown carnival owned by Duff Kent (Phillip Williams) who is used as a slave by the villains. The second season introduced Kilobyte (Ted Atherton), a sinister man who usurps Lord Fear and plots to slowly hunt Ace and destroy him. Kilobyte was created by Rick Hummel (Brett Heard), a programmer on the original game who was fired after developing the program that brought the characters to life. He works as a computer repairman and takes on Chuck as an employee. Another notable character is Mr. Cheseborough (R.D. Reid), Mark's science teacher who becomes convinced the game characters are aliens after being briefly abducted by Lord Fear, and becomes increasingly paranoid over the series.  Episodes  = Season 1 (2002‚Äì2003) = The season aired between September 2002 and March 2003. When broadcast in America, the episodes were shown out of order, which sometimes resulted in severe continuity errors. For instance, \\"Tunnel of Love\\" was shown before \\"Once Upon a Hero.\\" Random Virus would show up as an established character the day before he would be established. = Season 2 (2005) = The second series was broadcast in most countries in 2004, but it aired in the United Kingdom during the summer of 2005 for unknown reasons. This season was not aired in the United States due to the poor reception of the first season. The graphics were greatly improved, and several of the characters including Staff Head and Pigface were changed to look more like the animals they resembled. Kilobyte, Rotgut, Kat Adams and Rick the Master Programmer made their debut in this season. Chuck also met the Lightning Knights, and Mark got his own weapon, allowing him to battle the villains. There were only 13 episodes with one overall storyline.  Production  The show was developed by BBC and Alliance Atlantis, with Rick Siggelkow as executive producer and creator of the show, and Jim Corston as head writer. Originally, the program's plot was to feature a superhero from a comic book coming to life but it was changed due to children playing videos games more as a pastime than reading comics. Mark was inspired by Spider-Man's alter ego Peter Parker. The series was in pre-production for two years, and took a year and a half to complete the first season. Matt Ficner designed the computer-generated characters for the series, and also provided the voices of Zip and Snip in the first season. Several characters were scrapped or did not make it into the series, including \\"Scrambler\\" (an early design of Kilobyte), \\"Buzzbeast\\" (a cybernetic dinosaur), \\"Candy Floss\\" (a female archer with a punk theme) and a group of villains referred to as \\"Carnival Grunts\\". Some characters were quite detailed in concept art, but their designs had to be simplified to meet the program's budget. The series was shot in Toronto in 2001 between 23 June and 22 November of that year. Reception According to the 2003-2004 annual review of BBC Worldwide's children's products, the series was a success and translated into different languages and forty countries, gaining high ratings in the United States on DIC Kids Network. The series received 1.2 million viewers on average during the first season's airing in the United Kingdom. However, a social argument occurred in 2004 regarding the series' content in relation to the Children's Television Act. Children's television analyst Dale Kunkel, a communication professor at the University of Arizona, described the series and Stargate Infinity as \\"anti-social\\". The opinions were shared by the activist groups the United Church of Christ and Center of Digital Democracy, viewing both programmes as violent. Former CEO of DIC Entertainment, Andy Heyward, defended Ace Lightning, taking the educational requirement very seriously for each episode. Heyward also had the support of Donald F. Roberts, who believed the descriptions given by the activists \\"mischaracterizes\\" the series they were attacking.

Contents With The Complete Psionics Handbook, psionics in the AD&D; game became the domain of an entirely new class, the psionicist. The psionicist's skills are based on the Wisdom and Constitution ability scores, and while humans can attain higher levels of expertise, all races are eligible for the class. Characters of chaotic alignment are not allowed to become psionicists, with the rationale being that volatile chaotic characters lack the discipline required to focus their mental energies. Psionic powers are assigned to six disciplines, which include clairsentience (divination), psychokinesis (animating and controlling existing objects and forces), psychometabolism (body-changing powers), psychoportation (teleportation variants), telepathy (mental communication and psychic attacks), and metapsionics (enhancement of other psychic abilities). Powers are designated as either sciences (major powers) or devotions (minor powers). As a psionicist gains experience and advances in level, he acquires more powers, and as a psionicist rises through the ranks, he also gains access to defense modes - special telepathic powers, which are received free of charge and don't count against a psionicist's normal power limits. The use of psionic powers involves a variant of the proficiencies system developed in the 2nd Edition rules. Each power has a score rated in terms of a particular attribute. When attempting to use a power, the player makes a Power Check by rolling 1d20 and comparing the result to the Power Score. A roll less than or equal to the Power Score means success. Additionally, each power description includes a specific penalty suffered by the psionicist if a 20 is rolled. A psionicist has a fixed number of Psionic Strength Points, derived from his wisdom score, to expend on psionic powers. A psionicist expends the number of PSPs required by a particular power, then attempts a Power Check. If the check fails and the power doesn't work, he forfeits half the PSP cost but is free to try again later. If he passes the check and the power is successful, the psionicist has the option of expending additional PSPs to maintain the power in subsequent rounds. Psionicists recover lost PSPs every hour in which no additional PSPs are expended. The less physical exertion, the more PSPs recovered; a walking PC recovers 3 PSPs per hour, and a resting PC recovers twice as many. The book contains over 150 psionic powers, and includes an entire chapter on psychic combat. The book also includes psionic monsters, such as the thought eater and cerebral parasite. The book has a discussion of society's reaction to psionicists, and a section describing the role of psionics in various TSR campaign settings. Publication history The Complete Psionics Handbook was published as a 128-page softcover book by TSR, Inc., with design by Steve Winter, and monster updates by Blake Mobley. Editing was by Andria Hayday, with illustrations by Terry Dykstra and Dee Barnett, and graphic design by Stephanie Tabat. Tsr code 2117, ad&d; 2nd edition code PHBR5. Reception Rick Swan reviewed The Complete Psionics Handbook for Dragon magazine #180 (April 1992). Swan gave the book a positive review, stating that while the large increase in the complexity of psionics from the 1st edition was intimidating, the system itself was straightforward and highly playable. Swan felt that the new book offered a number of elegant improvements over the previous system. He noted that the system's use of \\"power points\\" was similar to the magic systems used in a number of other role-playing games, and that for the most part it offered a distinct alternative to D&D;'s magic options. Swan felt that although the book was comprehensive for players, it lacked adequate advice for game masters to integrate the system into a game, and that some of the details of the system were a hassle for game masters to keep track of.

The final entry in his \\"humoristic\\" piano music of the 1910s, it is Satie's only full-scale parody of a single musical work: the Sonatina Op. 36 N¬∞ 1 (1797) by Muzio Clementi. In performance it lasts around 4 minutes. Satie's modern, irreverent reinterpretations of 18th Century music in this little pastiche have been hailed as a notable forerunner of Neoclassicism, a trend that would dominate Western concert hall music in the years between the World Wars.Pierre-Daniel Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", MIT Press, 1969, p. 90, note 9.

Music and texts Muzio Clementi Satie's sonatina, even shorter than Clementi's example, was composed in July 1917 and published the same year. The composition is in three tiny movements, of which the last one exposes some pseudo-development: the motifs of the first half of that movement are rearranged in another sequence by way of \\"development section\\", or rather as the imitation of development. From a formal point of view the sonatina is Satie's most outspoken neoclassical composition. It is one of the exceptional piano compositions he wrote down with bar lines, which he probably would not have done if not for making an explicit reference to classicism. Sonatine bureaucratique, cover of the original 1917 edition That Satie would write a \\"neo-classical\\" composition a few months after the succ√®s de scandale of Parade is not so surprising either: Satie was on friendly terms with Stravinsky from 1911, and after the latter had had his own succ√®s de scandale with The Rite of Spring in 1913 (premiered with the same Ballets Russes), he also moved towards neoclassicism ‚Äì although for Stravinsky there was no distinct neoclassical composition published before Satie's sonatina. The partition is full of funny remarks: for example, the final movement is called \\"Vivache\\" instead of the original Vivace (\\"vache\\" being French for \\"cow\\"). Satie directs at least part of the fun at himself: the sourd muet (\\"deaf-mute\\") from Lower Brittany, allegedly having provided the \\"Peruvian air\\" that forms the first theme of the last movement, is Satie himself. The sonatina can also be seen as the composition with which Satie concluded his series of \\"funny\\" three-part solo piano compositions, which he had begun in 1911. Premiere and reception Satie dedicated the Sonatine bureaucratique \\"with friendship\\" to the gifted young pianist Juliette M√©erovitch (1896-1920),Complete original score on IMSLP, http://conquest.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/f/f4/IMSLP237291-PMLP06198-Satie,_Erik- Klavierwerke_Peters_Klemm_Band_2_10_Sonatine_bureaucratique_scan.pdfCaroline Potter, Erik Satie: A Parisian Composer and His World, Boydell Press, February 2016, p. xxv. who gave its first public performance at the Salle Huyghens in Paris on December 1, 1917.Caroline Potter, Erik Satie: Music, Art and Literature, Routledge, May 2016, p. 303.

The sonatina represents what biographer Steven Moore Whiting called \\"the culmination and also the end of Satie's humoristic piano music.\\"Steven Moore Whiting, \\"Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, p. 488. His final compositions for that instrument, the Nocturnes (1919) and Premier Menuet (1920), were much more serious in tone.Satie considered adding ironic titles and texts to the Nocturnes but rejected this plan in the early stages of composition. See Olof H√∂jer's notes to \\"Erik Satie: The Complete Piano Music, Vol. 6\\", Swedish Society Discofil, 1996. Satie's early biographers acknowledged the Sonatine bureaucratique as a precursor of Neoclassical music, but were otherwise unimpressed with the piece. Pierre- Daniel Templier (1932) relegated it to a footnote in his book,Templier, \\"Erik Satie\\", p. 90, cited above while Rollo H.

It won the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1979\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-29. (With essay by Marie Myung-Ok Lee from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) O'Brien himself says that \\"Going After Cacciato is a war novel however this is a controversial idea due to the fact that the book is about a soldier going AWOL.\\" This complex novel is set during the Vietnam War and is told from the third person limited point of view of the protagonist, Paul Berlin. The story traces the events that ensue after Cacciato, a member of Berlin's squad, decides to go AWOL by walking from Vietnam to France, through Asia. Cacciato means \\"hunted\\"/\\"caught\\" in Italian. Plot Introduction Typical of many stories that deal with themes of psychological trauma, Going After Cacciato contains distinct ambiguities concerning the nature and order of events that occur. The chronology is nonlinear for most of the book. The main idea of the story is, by O'Brien's estimation, that being a soldier in Vietnam for the standard tour of duty entails constant walking; if one were to put all the walking in a straight line, one would end up in Paris, where Cacciato is going. Paul Berlin, the main character, is a frustrated soldier. During one night while on watch duty, Paul Berlin thinks about the past and events that lead him to daydream about going to Paris. The courage it takes to chase one's dreams is a recurring theme, which is often expressed through Paul Berlin's reveries. Cacciato, who is always portrayed as self-sufficient and happy, is pursued by Berlin and his comrades in arms. Cacciato's actions are sometimes portrayed as those of a man who is not particularly bright or gifted, but who is untroubled by the larger questions of the war itself. In the chapter \\"Tunneling Toward Paris\\", the characters escape the endless tunnels by \\"falling out\\" just as they fell in; this allusion to Alice In Wonderland helps to reveal the story as surrealistic fiction. This surrealism also appears earlier in the novel, when Cacciato flies off a mountain. Characters *Paul Berlin - Narrator/protagonist, who thinks up the chase after Cacciato. *Sarkin Aung Wan - Burmese refugee who saves the squad many times, such as the time they became lost in a Vietcong tunnel complex. *Cacciato - Soldier who goes AWOL (to Paris). *Frenchie Tucker - Dies in a tunnel, shot in the nose. *Bernie Lynn - is killed after following Frenchie Tucker into the tunnel and is shot underneath in part of his throat. *Eddie Lazzutti - Soldier in the Third Squad. *Stink Harris - Leads party; is \\"trigger happy.\\" He once had ringworm. *Harold Murphy - Another soldier in Berlin's squad. Murphy leaves early on since he feels the mission is worthless and the penalty for it is too great. *Buff - Short for Water Buffalo, is known for his big size. He dies while the platoon is trying to cross a field. Berlin commonly refers to his death as \\"life after death\\" because his face remains in his helmet after he is killed. *Cpt. Fahyi Rhallon - One of the Savak. Tries to arrest the squad in Iran. *Billy Boy Watkins - One of the casualties in Berlin's squad. Watkins is referred back to many times, often accompanied by a short song that the squad sung frequently about his death. Watkins died after he stepped on a defective mine which severed his foot from his leg. Although not mortally wounded, he enters a state of shell-shock and dies. Doc Peret claims Watkins died of fright. Watkins, especially via his song, demonstrates how soldiers cope with the death around them, sometimes subliminally morphing tragedy into comedy to lessen the fear. *Ready Mix - Died during an assault of a hill in the Highlands. No one knew his real name; the mention of this character serves to illustrate a common superstition among soldiers in Vietnam that it was best not to get to know someone if you thought he was going to die soon. *Doc Peret - the squad's medical aide. He sometimes uses M&Ms; as a type of medicine for those under his care, usually as a way to calm down the over-reactive and the dying. *Lt. Sidney Martin - The former lieutenant of Berlin's squad; insisted on following SOP (Standard Operating Procedures). One of the SOPs in Vietnam was to search all tunnels before detonating them; Martin enforced this rule sternly. None of the men in the squad wanted to search tunnels after seeing Tucker and Lynn die. The men in the squad attempt to plead with Martin, but he sternly restates that they must search tunnels before blowing them. In the end, all the men in the squad agree to kill Lt. Martin. The exact manner of death is never stated, except that Lt. Martin died in the tunnels. He was also an officer from West Point. *Lt. Corson- Frequently referred to simply as the Lieutenant. He takes command of the platoon after Lieutenant Martin, the de facto leader of Berlin's squad. It is stated that he was busted down twice from a higher rank, once fairly and once not. As the story moves on the \\"Lt.\\" is too old for the war and wants to go back to his country. He is always \\"sick\\", says Doc, and the sickness is called homesickness. When the squad reaches India, he is temporarily cured when he meets a woman ‚Äî a married hotelier who had once studied in Baltimore, Maryland ‚Äî but he becomes sick again when the squad moves on. *Rudy Chassler - Dies from injuries sustained after stepping on a land mine. *Jim Pederson - A religious man, who dies in rice a paddy after being shot multiple times by the door gunners in the Chinook helicopter that dropped the platoon there. As he dies, he attempts to shoot down the Chinook. He carries postcard pictures of Christ with him. *Oscar Johnson - Black soldier in the Third Squad. He said that the Vietnam cold made him think of Detroit in the month of May, \\"lootin' weather.\\" It is suggested that Johnson may not be from Detroit at all, despite his ghetto posturing ‚Äî his mail comes from and goes to Maine, and one of his nicknames is \\"the nigga from Ba Haba.\\" *Ben Nystrom- shot himself in the foot to escape active duty in Vietnam. *Vaught- another soldier in their Squad who loses an arm due to infection and leaves the war.  Style  The Famous Authors website writes, \\"His incorporation of metaphysical approach attributed a rich quality to his writing style. ... According to him, sometimes the fictional truth is more realistic than [the] factual one. It is because of the fact that fictional truth appeals to the emotion and feelings which makes the literature more meaningful.\\" As a Study Guide notes, the story is told in the third person from Paul Berlin's point of view. Paul Berlin's narrative jumps from his current situation to a (possibly) imaginary observation post where he is on guard duty, to another imaginary trip from Vietnam to Paris, chasing a deserter named Cacciato. Berlin's last name suggests the divisions in his thinking, moods, and desires; Berlin, Germany was divided by the victorious powers following World War II, and remained so at the time of the novel's writing. Readers have found many passages puzzling; the LitCharts editors explain, \\"There are scenes in the novel that seem extremely realistic, scenes that require the suspension of disbelief, and some scenes that are nothing short of impossible ‚Äî indeed, the plot of the book itself (a group of US soldiers travels all the way from Vietnam to Paris in search of a soldier from their platoon who has wandered off) sounds like a fairy tale. ... The issue, then, is understanding O'Brien's blend of the believable and the unbelievable, and incorporating it into our comprehension of the book... One of the most common phrases critics used to describe Going After Cacciato, at least at the time, was 'magical realism.'\\" An example occurs in Chapter 36 (entitled, fittingly, \\"Flights of Imagination\\") > A miracle, Paul Berlin kept thinking. It was all he wanted -- a genuine > miracle to confound natural law, a baffling reversal of the inevitable > consequences. ... A miracle, he thought, and closed his eyes and made it > happen. And then a getaway car -- why not? It was a night of miracles, and > he was a miracle man. So why not? Yes, a car. Cacciato pointed at it, > shouted something, then disappeared. The reality of Cacciato himself has been put in doubt by some critics. Interior evidence suggests that Paul Berlin might be conflating Cacciato with himself. Paul thinks that > There was something curiously unfinished about Cacciato. Open-faced and > naive and plump, Cacciato lacked the fine detail, the refinements and final > touches, that maturity ordinarily marks on a boy of seventeen years. The > result was blurred and uncolored and bland. You could look at him then look > away and not remember what you'd seen. He also sees Cacciato's face in the moon floating above the squad and as \\"fuzzy, bobbing in and out of mist\\" (p. 10) -- pretty much in any environment in which Paul Berlin finds himself. Paul Berlin occasionally finds himself explaining or translating for Cacciato. When the men first leave their post and first spot Cacciato in the mountains, they see through binoculars that he opens his mouth to speak; then thunder roars. The other soldiers speculate that Cacciato is trying to emulate a chicken, trying to squawk and fly. It is Paul who tells the lieutenant that what Cacciato said was \\"Good-bye.\\" (p. 11) Florman and Kestler argue that \\"At many points, it's suggested that the story of Berlin's journey from Vietnam to Paris ‚Äî in other words, the plot of the novel we're reading ‚Äî is a story Berlin is telling himself as a way of coping with his fear and anxiety. It's as if the more fantastic parts of the book are playing out in one man's head ‚Äî not because he believes they could really happen, but because he needs to believe in something.\\"  Critical reception  Richard Freedman, writing in The New York Times and suggesting that Cacciato is a Christ figure, said, \\"By turns lurid and lyrical, Going After Cacciato combines a surface of realistic war reportage as fine as any in Michael Herr's recent Dispatches with a deeper feel -- perhaps possible only in fiction -- of the surrealistic effect war has on the daydreams and nightmares of the combatants. To call Going After Cacciato a novel about war is like calling Moby Dick a novel about whales.\\" Freedman sees influences by Ernest Hemingway and says, \\"...far from being a high-minded, low-voltage debate on the rights and wrongs of Vietnam, Going After Cacciato is fully dramatized account of men both in action and escaping from it.\\" See also * The Things They Carried References Category:1978 American novels Category:Novels set during the Vietnam War Category:Military fiction Category:Anti-war novels Category:Novels by Tim O'Brien Category:Books by Tim O'Brien Category:National Book Award for Fiction winning works Category:Doubleday (publisher) books Category:Nonlinear narrative novels ","title":"Going After Cacciato"},{"id":"899701","text":"Wolf Dog, also known as A Boy and His Dog, is a 1958 Northwestern movie, directed and produced by Sam Newfield and produced by Regal Films. The film stars Jim Davis and Allison Hayes. Cast *Jim Davis Production In August 1957, Newfield and a camera crew filmed the movie in and around Markdale, Ontario, near Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada. The movie co-starred Hollywood actors Jim Davis, Allison Hayes and John Hart along with Canadian actors Austin Willis and Tony Brown. Several locals were offered a chance to be unpaid \\"extras\\". Among those were Paul Hutton, Jerry Bartley, Constable Clarence Bowins, David Jackson, Officer Jack Johnston, Ron Wyvill, Don Wyvill. Reception While not an artistic or commercial success, the film is noteworthy in that it was created almost 40 years before Telefilm Canada and federal government subsidies enabled big-name movies to be filmed in Canadian locales. Markdale residents were delighted to have Hollywood make a film in their town. It was hoped a film set in \\"The Great North Country\\" would be a crossover hit in the U.S. and the Commonwealth, both lucrative movie markets. For reasons unknown, the film disappeared from the public eye for almost 50 years. An unsubstantiated rumor suggested one of the main actors wanted all traces of the film destroyed. The only known copies of the film are an incomplete version stored at the National Archives of Canada and a complete version at the U.S. Library of Congress. Copies of the movie can be found at the Markdale Public Library, Ontario, Canada, donated by the creator of the fan site, Jeff Wilson. He, along with actors from the film, Ron Wyvill and Paul Hutton, appeared in a short documentary made by Rogers Television, Owen Sound.

One brand of marshmallow creme is Marshmallow Fluff, which is used to make the New England classic comfort food, the fluffernutter sandwich, which debuted in 1918 in Massachusetts, just a year after marshmallow creme was invented. Fluff is manufactured by Durkee-Mower, Inc.; its ingredients include corn syrup, sugar syrup, vanilla flavor, and egg whites. History Many late-19th-century \\"marshmallow paste\\" recipes produced solid foods. The earliest mention of marshmallow creme in an American cookbook is from Fannie Farmer's Boston School Cook Book, printed in 1896. However, the author does not give a recipe for marshmallow cream in this book, instead giving a recipe for marshmallow paste in the cake filling section. In 1902, Mrs. Rorer's New Cook Book by Sarah Tyson Rorer describes her recipe for \\"marshmallow filling\\". Around the beginning of the 20th century, Somerville, Massachusetts, resident and inventor of the product Archibald Query started selling his version door- to-door. He soon afterward sold the recipe to two candy makers in Lynn, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred Mower, for $500. The product first hit market shelves in cans as Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff in 1917. The first two words were dropped soon after the packaging changed to a glass jar in the 1940s. Today, the Durkee-Mower company is one of only three companies in North America to produce marshmallow creme, the other products being Kraft Jet- Puffed Marshmallow Creme and Solo Marshmallow Creme. \\"Fluff\\" continues as a regional tradition in the Northeastern United States. One popular use is in the Marshmallow Fluff and peanut butter sandwich: fluffernutter. Also, the container has a \\"no-fail\\" recipe for chocolate fudge printed on the side. Since at least 2006, the city of Somerville has celebrated Query's original creation of Fluff with an annual festival in Union Square titled What the Fluff?. Typical activities at the festival have included a science fair, gallery show, cooking contests, and carnival games such as a bean-bag toss, all themed around Marshmallow Fluff. In 2011, actress Susan Olsen, most famous for portraying Cindy Brady on the Brady Bunch, attended the festival, where she sold her marshmallow fluff-inspired art. According to a 2006 Boston Globe article, Massachusetts State Senator Jarrett Barrios proposed a restriction on the number of weekly servings of Marshmallow Fluff (fluffernutter) sandwiches in the form of an amendment to a bill that will limit \\"junk food\\" in schools. The proposal was later dropped. Also in 2006, State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein planned to file a bill that would make the Fluffernutter the official sandwich of Massachusetts. Usage in Arabic cuisine Marshmallow creme is also a traditional confection in Arabic cuisine, where it is commonly referred to as soapwort meringue (). The original recipe is based on soapwort (roots of Saponaria officinalis) or roots of the marshmallow plant, but modern commercial varieties are nearly identical to marshmallow creme. It was mentioned in a tenth-century Arabic cookbook, Kitab al-·π¨abƒ´·∏´ ('The Book of Dishes') by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq.

The village has been described as one of Cornwall's loveliest inland villages and as ‚Ä≤a mild tropic garden‚Ä≤ by John Betjeman. It is probably best known for the round-houses, built by the vicar Jeremiah Trist in the early 19th century. Geography The southern boundary of the parish is along the English Channel from the Pendower stream in the west to Portholland in the east. To the west is the parish of Gerrans and on the east is St Michael Caerhays. Veryan is bounded by the parishes of Philleigh, Ruan Lanihorne and Tregony in the north.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 204 Truro & Falmouth The parish comprises of land and of water. The A3078 is the main form of communication and runs along the north of the parish from St Mawes joining the A390 at Probus. The nearest railway stations are at Truro and St Austell. The main settlements are Veryan Churchtown, Veryan Green, Portloe and the smaller hamlets of Trewartha, Treviskey, Carne and Camels. Veryan is served by a post office (Veryan and Portloe Stores) and a public house (the New Inn). History Two round houses built by the Vicar for his daughters Veryan was originally mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as the manor of Elerchi (now Elerkey in street names etc.), which was derived from 'elerch', the Cornish for 'swan'. The origin of the name is by corruption of \\"Symphorian\\" to \\"Severian\\" and then \\"Saint Veryan\\". The church is one of the few in west Cornwall for which there is no evidence of its existence before the Norman Conquest. The church was given by the lord of the manor of Elerky to the monks of Montacute in Somerset, 1110, but a later lord, John de Montacute, gave it to the Dean and Chapter of Exeter, ca. 1220, and they held it until 1859. The parish church of St Symphorian has an unusual plan with a tower south of the south transept and a north aisle. Parts of the church are Norman and others Decorated in style.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall, 2nd ed. Penguin Books Melinsey Mill is situated within Veryan. The mill itself was built in 1565 and now the site stands as a tourist attraction which serves food. In the 19th century Veryan's vicar and local land owner Jeremiah Trist expanded the village's buildings. He convinced parishioners to attend church on a regular basis, and built two schools and a series of round houses. The school for boys was built in 1814 and is on the site of the present infant and junior school. A \\"school of industry\\" for girls was also built, now a thatched house behind the New Inn. The round houses were built between 1815 and 1818 by Trist, inspired by one in St Winnow. There is a pair at the entrance to the village at Veryan Green and another two at village entrance on the Pendower road. All four are thatched, while a fifth behind the school has a slate roof. Trist installed crosses on each of the houses and they were said to deter the devil from entering the village. The large house, Parc Behan, overlooking the church was also built by Trist as his dwelling: the vicarage was too small and in a bad state of repair. =Carne Beacon= Carne Beacon, lying a mile from Veryan, is said to be the burial place of the Cornish saint, King Gerennius (Geraint). Local folklore suggests that the burial mound contains the golden boat with silver oars, on which his body was brought across Gerrans Bay. There is no archaeological evidence for the existence of this boat. Carne Beacon, the site of T2 Veryan Post During World War II, Carne Beacon became the site of the very first Cornish above ground aircraft reporting post. It opened in January 1940 as part of No 20 Group Truro and was designated the name of T2 Veryan Post. The site was chosen because of its advantageous views over the sea. Local residents strongly objected to its placing on such a hallowed point but they were overruled by the Air Ministry. The view was excellent for this post which was a wooden structure some 3 metres by 4 metres square. The post consisted of an observation area with aircraft plotting instrument and a small space for making refreshments and gaining shelter. They communicated by a land line telephone to Truro where the main operations room was based. It was continuously patrolled and had to report every aircraft in a ten-mile radius. It was later equipped with high frequency radio which enabled it to communicate with aircraft that sent out distress signals. It was later refurbished with concrete and remained in use after the war mainly manned in villagers spare time. In 1962 the site closed and moved to Nare Head. The site was demolished and some remains are viewable at the Veryan Post Museum. In present-day all that remains of the post are its concrete foundations. =Local government= In 1894 Veryan became part of the Truro Rural District which was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and Veryan became part of Carrick District Council. The district was abolished in 2009 and Veryan now falls under the unitary Cornwall Council. Veryan also elects eleven councillors to the parish council. The vicarage cross consists of an ancient shaft with a modern base and cross head; it was erected early in the 20th century.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 72 Sport Veryan Sports and Social Club was opened in 1984 and provide facilities for cricket, bowling and tennis. Veryan Cricket Club was founded in 1860, although the game was played much earlier with a writer from The West Briton newspaper crediting Trist as inspiring the locals to play cricket since 1810. The team joined the Cornwall Cricket League in 1951 and played in Senior 1 East in 1983; the highest level in Cornwall at that time. They currently have two teams playing in Division 2 East and Division 6 Central. Their most famous player was David Halfyard. Veryan Football Club play in the Duchy League and are the current champions of the second division; level 16 in the English pyramid system. Tourism Veryan attracts tourism due to its location on the Roseland Peninsula and has bed and breakfasts, hotels and guest houses. The round houses are also a factor in the parish's tourism interest and are rented out for accommodation. Veryan is also popular because of its location near the South West Coast Path, a route for keen walkers in Cornwall. Locals also let visitors use the Indoor Bowling Green. The village also has a Sports Pavilion with provision for tennis, cricket, bowls and a children‚Äôs playground. Carne Beacon also attracts visitors as it is open to the public with prior contact. Film and television Various scenes for the 1992 television drama series The Camomile Lawn, based on Mary Wesley's book of the same name, were filmed in Veryan (Broom Parc House) and on the coast at nearby Portloe.

Brother of the theoretical physicist, Louis de Broglie. Biography =Early years= De Broglie was born in Paris, to Victor de Broglie and Pauline de La Forest d'Armaill√© (1851‚Äì1928). In 1901, he was married to Camille Bernou de Rochetaill√©e (1888‚Äì1966) in Paris. They had one daughter, Laure, born on 17 November 1904, who died, aged six, on 12 June 1911. He acceded to the title of duc de Broglie on his father's death in 1906. He died on 14 July 1960 in Neuilly-sur-Seine. His only child having died almost a half-century before, his brother Louis succeeded him as duke. Having graduated from naval officer's school, Maurice de Broglie spent nine years in the French Navy, serving on a gunboat at Bizerte and in the Mediterranean Squadron. While serving, he became interested in physics, and began doing research on electromagnetism. De Broglie defied his family's wishes and left the navy in 1904 to pursue a scientific career. He studied under Paul Langevin at the Coll√®ge de France in Paris, receiving his doctorate in 1908. =Career= De Broglie made advances in the study of X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy. During the First World War, he worked on radio communications for the navy. After the war, he resumed his research at a large laboratory in his home. He occasionally collaborated with his younger brother Louis, who followed his professional lead and was training as a physicist, and they coauthored a paper in 1921. After Louis de Broglie's rise to prominence in the 1920s, building on some of their shared research, the elder de Broglie physicist continued his own research. While Louis was primarily a theoretician, Maurice's focus was mainly experimental. De Broglie became a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences in 1924, and in 1934 was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise, replacing the historian Pierre de La Gorce.

The Greek form of the tribal name gave rise to the name Caledonia for their territory. The Caledonians were considered to be a group of Britons,Encyclopaedia Romana. University of Chicago. accessed March 1, 2007 but later, after the Roman conquest of the southern half of Britain, the northern inhabitants were distinguished as Picts, thought to be a related people who would have also spoken a Brittonic language. The Caledonian Britons were thus enemies of the Roman Empire, which was the occupying force then administering most of Great Britain as the Roman province of Britannia. The Caledonians, like many Celtic tribes in Britain, were hillfort builders and farmers who defeated and were defeated by the Romans on several occasions. The Romans never fully occupied Caledonia, though several attempts were made. Nearly all of the information available about the Caledonians is based on predominately Roman sources, which may suggest bias. Peter Salway assumes that the Caledonians would have been Pictish tribes speaking a language closely related to Common Brittonic, or a branch of itWatson 1926; Jackson 1955; Koch 1983; Smyth 1984; Forsyth 1997; Price 2000; Forsyth 2006; Woolf 2007; Fraser 2009 augmented by fugitive Brythonic resistance fighters fleeing from Britannia. This is, however, contested by the fact, that according to the book \\"Life of Saint Columba\\", the Irish emissary needed an interpreter in order to speak to the Pictish king or convert certain individual in their kingdom. The Caledonian tribe, after which the historical Caledonian Confederacy is named, may have been joined in conflict with Rome by tribes in northern central Scotland by this time, such as the Vacomagi, Taexali and Venicones recorded by Ptolemy. The Romans reached an accommodation with Brythonic tribes such as the Votadini as effective buffer states. Etymology According to German linguist Stefan Zimmer, Caledonia is derived from the tribal name Caledones (a Latinization of a Brittonic nominative plural n-stem Calƒ´dones), which he etymologises as \\"possessing hard feet\\" (\\"alluding to standfastness or endurance\\", from the Proto-Celtic roots *kal- \\"hard\\" and *œÜƒìdo- \\"foot\\").Zimmer, Stefan, \\"Some Names and Epithets in Culhwch ac Olwen\\", in: Studi Celtici 3, 2004 [recte 2006], p. 163-179. The singular form of the ethnic name is attested as Caledo (a Latinization of the Brittonic nominative singular n-stem *Calid≈´) on a Romano-British inscription from Colchester.Koch, John T. (ed.). Celtic Culture: an hystorical encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO, 2006, pp. 332-333. History In AD 83 or 84, led by Calgacus, the Caledonians' defeat at the hands of Gnaeus Julius Agricola at Mons Graupius is recorded by Tacitus. Tacitus avoids using terms such as king to describe Calgacus and it is uncertain as to whether the Caledonians had single leaders or whether they were more disparate and that Calgacus was an elected war leader only. Tacitus records the physical characteristics of the Caledonians as red hair and long limbs. In AD 180 they took part in an invasion of Britannia, breached Hadrian's Wall and were not brought under control for several years, eventually signing peace treaties with the governor Ulpius Marcellus. This suggests that they were capable of making formal agreements in unison despite supposedly having many different chieftains. However, Roman historians used the word \\"Caledonius\\" not only to refer to the Caledones themselves, but also to any of the other tribes (both Pictish or Brythonic) living north of Hadrian's Wall, and it is uncertain whether these later were limited to individual groups or wider unions of tribes. In 197 AD Dio Cassius records that the Caledonians aided in a further attack on the Roman frontier being led by the Maeatae and the Brigantes and probably inspired by the removal of garrisons on Hadrian's Wall by Clodius Albinus. He says the Caledonians broke the treaties they had made with Marcellus a few years earlier (Dio lxxvii, 12). The governor who arrived to oversee the regaining of control over Britannia after Albinus' defeat, Virius Lupus, was obliged to buy peace from the Maeatae rather than fight them. The Caledonians are next mentioned in 209, when they are said to have surrendered to the emperor Septimius Severus after he personally led a military expedition north of Hadrian's Wall, in search of a glorious military victory. Herodian and Dio wrote only in passing of the campaign but describe the Caledonians ceding territory to Rome as being the result. Cassius Dio records that the Caledonians inflicted 50,000 Roman casualties due to attrition and unconventional tactics such as guerrilla warfare. Dr. Colin Martin has suggested that the Severan campaigns did not seek a battle but instead sought to destroy the fertile agricultural land of eastern Scotland and thereby bring about genocide of the Caledonians through starvation. By 210 however, the Caledonians had re-formed their alliance with the Maeatae and joined their fresh offensive. A punitive expedition led by Severus' son, Caracalla, was sent out with the purpose of slaughtering everyone it encountered from any of the northern tribes. Severus meanwhile prepared for total conquest but was already ill; he died at Eboracum (modern day York) in Britannia in 211. Caracalla attempted to take over command but when his troops refused to recognise him as emperor, he made peace with the Caledonians and retreated south of Hadrian's Wall to press his claim for the imperial title. Sheppard Frere suggests that Caracalla briefly continued the campaign after his father's death rather than immediately leaving, citing an apparent delay in his arrival in Rome and indirect numismatic and epigraphic factors that suggest he may instead have fully concluded the war but that Dio's hostility towards his subject led him to record the campaign as ending in a truce. Malcolm Todd however considers there to be no evidence to support this. Nonetheless the Caledonians did retake their territory and pushed the Romans back to Hadrian's Wall. In any event, there is no further historical mention of the Caledonians for a century save for a c. AD 230 inscription from Colchester which records a dedication by a man calling himself the nephew (or grandson) of \\"Uepogenus, [a] Caledonian\\".medievalscotland.org This may be because Severus' campaigns were so successful that the Caledonians were wiped out, however this is highly unlikely. In 305, Constantius Chlorus re-invaded the northern lands of Britain although the sources are vague over their claims of penetration into the far north and a great victory over the \\"Caledones and others\\" (Panegyrici Latini Vetares, VI (VII) vii 2). The event is notable in that it includes the first recorded use of the term 'Pict' to describe the tribes of the area. Physical appearance Tacitus in his Agricola, chapter XI (c. 98 AD) described the Caledonians as red haired and large limbed, which he considered features of Germanic origin: ‚ÄúThe reddish (rutilae) hair and large limbs of the Caledonians proclaim a German origin‚Äù. Jordanes in his Getica wrote something similar: Eumenius, the panegyrist of Constantine Chlorus, wrote that both the Picts and Caledonians were red haired (rutilantia).The early chronicles relating to Scotland being the Rhind lectures in archaeology for 1912 in connection with the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, published 1912 by J. Maclehose in Glasgow, p. 7. Scholars such as William Forbes Skene noted that this description matches Tacitus' description of the Caledonians as red haired in his Agricola.Celtic Scotland: A History of Ancient Alban, William Forbes Skene, Forgotten Books, p. 94, footnote. Archaeology There is little direct evidence of a Caledonian archaeological culture but it is possible to describe the settlements in their territory during their existence. The hillforts that stretched from the North York Moors to the Scottish Highlands are evidence of a distinctive character emerging in northern Great Britain from the Middle Iron Age onwards. They were much smaller than the hillforts further south, often less than 10,000 square metres in area (one hectare, about 2.47 acres), and there is no evidence that they were extensively occupied or defended by the Caledonians, who appear to generally have had a dispersed settlement pattern. By the time of the Roman invasion there had been a move towards less heavily fortified but better sheltered farmsteads surrounded by earthwork enclosures. Individual family groups likely inhabited these new fortified farmsteads, linked together with their neighbours through intermarriage. The reason for this change from hilltop fortresses to farms amongst the Caledonians and their neighbours is unknown. Barry Cunliffe considers that the importance of demonstrating an impressive residence became less significant by the second century because of falling competition for resources due to advances in food production or a population decline. Alternatively, finds of Roman material may mean that social display became more of a matter of personal adornment with imported exotica rather than building an impressive dwelling.

It is the fifth installment in the Street Fighter II sub-series of Street Fighter games, following Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers. Like its predecessor, it ran on the CP System II hardware. Super Turbo introduced several new gameplay mechanics not present in previous versions of Street Fighter II, including the addition of combination moves called super combos and air combos. It also introduced the secret character Akuma, who would go on to become a recurring character in later Street Fighter installments and other Capcom fighting games. Super Turbo was originally ported to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, followed by the PlayStation and Sega Saturn (under the title of Super Street Fighter II Turbo: The Ultimate Championship) as part of the Street Fighter Collection, and for the Dreamcast in Japan under the title of Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service. A remake of the game was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 titled Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix. While not as much of a commercial success as previous iterations of the game, the game was well received by critics and had a huge impact on the competitive fighting game \\"e-sport\\" circuit. Super Street Fighter II Turbo is still played competitively over 20 years after its original release, and is the oldest fighting game that still has an active competitive tournament scene throughout the world. Characters Super Street Fighter II Turbo allows players to play as versions of characters from the original Super Street Fighter II in addition to their regular counterparts in the game by inputting a codeCodes for alternate characters for each character. The character would play as they would in Super Street Fighter II, with subtle differences. For example, the alternate version of Sagat in Super Turbo can now cancel his light kick into any special move, whereas in Super Street Fighter II he couldn't. Super Street Fighter II Turbo also saw the introduction of the series' first secret character, Akuma (Gouki in Japan). Akuma is playable only as a secret character. He can be used by inputting a code at the player select screen. Even in this weakened form, he is the most powerful character in the game, and has historically been banned in all competitive tournaments of the game, including updated versions of Super Turbo. Gameplay Ryu finishes off Zangief with his Shink≈´ Had≈çken Super Combo. Super Street Fighter II Turbo featured several changes and additions to the play mechanics inherited from Super Street Fighter II. The HUD featured new graphics. The original opening sequence and unused sequence, which had featured two generic characters fighting in front of a crowd, was replaced by a new opening featuring lead character Ryu launching a Hadouken projectile towards the screen, now intertwined with images of Chun-Li and Cammy, as well as brief flashes of the image of new hidden character Akuma. New animation frames were drawn for all the victory poses and the basic and special moves of the characters. For example, Chun-Li received a new animation for her Kik≈çken (fireball) projectile. A large criticism of Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers was the slower game speed in comparison to the previous release, Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. Super Turbo was the first Street Fighter game released in arcades to feature an adjustable speed setting. The game speed can be adjusted through the system configuration by the games operator or (if the speed setting is set to \\"Free Select\\") can be chosen by the player at the start of the game. The player has a choice between four speed settings. Super Street Fighter II Turbo introduced \\"Super Combos\\". After building up the \\"Super\\" meter, players can execute a multi-hit automatic combo which deals a large amount of damage. Home versions =Direct Ports= 3DO Interactive Multiplayer For Super Street Fighter II, Capcom produced a special controller for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, 3DO, and Super NES that featured a traditional six-button layout. The 3DO port was released on November 13, 1994 in Japan, with subsequent releases in North America and Europe during the same year. While the graphics are more accurately reproduced compared to the previous console ports for 16-bit platforms, the game doesn't support parallax scrolling and is missing animations on characters. Also, the Super versions of characters are not present. Although the loading times are short by CD-ROM standards at the time, the game can load during battle when a player performs an elaborate move such as jumping (especially when both characters jump at the same time), and the controls are affected occasionally as well. The soundtrack features the same remixed music from the FM Towns version of Super Street Fighter II (with a few additional remixes specific to Super Turbo). This port also features \\"CPS1 Chains\\", a feature that only existed in the arcade versions up until Hyper Fighting. MS-DOS and Amiga The MS-DOS version, developed by Eurocom and published by GameTek, was released in May 1995 in North America and Europe. There are secret commands to use each character's original color scheme or attacks that were removed from the 3DO version due to memory constraints. The option menus have custom settings (such as enabling and disabling parallax scrolling) that allows the game to be played with low hardware specifications. The biggest change is the game's resolution; the game is played with a resolution of 320√ó200 on AT/PC-compatible machines and, since the graphic data is ported straight from the arcade version, all of the characters appear large due to the narrow screen size. Because of this, the distance between both fighters at the beginning of a match is slightly narrower than in the arcade version. There were many glitches in the initial shipments of the DOS port, such as characters landing and recovering normally after being knocked out with a basic attack in mid-air. A patch file was distributed that corrected these glitches, which were later fixed in version 1.5 of the retail release. A patch file for version 1.6 was released as well. The music was remixed, although the arrangements are different from the ones used in the 3DO soundtrack. The Amiga port was also released by Gametek (and ported by Human Soft) in 1996, which is graphically very close to the original arcade version and features a remixed soundtrack, but suffers from jerky animation and other shortcomings when played on an unexpanded machine. PlayStation and Sega Saturn Super Turbo is included in the Street Fighter Collection compilation for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, which also includes Super Street Fighter II on the same disc, as well as Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold on a second disc. There is a small delay at the beginning of every match, and there are numerous small differences from the arcade version. Dreamcast Capcom released Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service for the Dreamcast in Japan exclusively as a mail-order release via the online Dreamcast Direct store (later known as Sega Direct ) on December 22, 2000. The Dreamcast version features an online versus mode on Sega's \\"Matching Service\\" compatible only on analog modems. (The Matching Service closed on September 1, 2003.) The bonus mini-games from previous versions of Street Fighter II, which had been cut in the arcade version, were restored in this port and can be enabled via a special options menu which can make the port more arcade-accurate. Other secret options are available as well. The port is considerably more accurate than the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions, as almost nothing was changed aside from the score display. It features additional speed settings including faster speeds (speeds 4‚Äì6) and a very slow speed (speed 0) that doesn't remove any frames. PlayStation 2 and Xbox Super Turbo is included in Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Although the first compilation included the first three Street Fighter II games, the second volume skipped the original Super Street Fighter II and only included Super Turbo. This version has many speed hiccups and glitches. PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch & Steam Super Street Fighter II Turbo is included in Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection in arcade perfect form. The existing updates of this title are not included in the collection as Hyper Street Fighter II exclusive to arcade, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, while Ultra Street Fighter II is exclusive to Switch. In this release, save states are featured in the source code, while other features can be toggled on and off. Regarding online functionality, this title (along with Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting, Street Fighter Alpha 3 and Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike) has availability for multiplayer matches. =Rearranged Versions= Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival Released on June 13, 2001 in Japan, with subsequent releases in North America and Europe by Capcom, Super Street Fighter II Turbo Revival is a port of Super Turbo for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) with new character illustrations and title screen. It was re-released as a Virtual Console game for the Wii U in 2015. The GBA only has four buttons used for attacks, though the four action buttons can be easily customized. Although most of the basic character sprites and animations were transferred from the SNES version of the original Super Street Fighter II, the new techniques that were added from Super Turbo used the same sprites and animations from the arcade version. This results in a few characters suddenly growing in size for a moment when performing certain moves, such as Guile's standing heavy kick, since the arcade version used bigger sprites than the SNES version. Likewise, the animation frames when a character advances towards an opponent are the same when he or she retreats. Only Akuma uses character sprites exclusively from the arcade version and his advancing and retreating animations are different as a result. The stages for Ryu, Ken, Guile, Zangief, and M. Bison are all-new, while Chun-Li's new stage is from Street Fighter Alpha 2, and Balrog's stage is from Street Fighter Alpha 3. Akuma also has a specific stage, which is the same one as Ryu's, but with a different palette. All the voice clips of the characters are taken from the arcade version with the exception of Ryu's, which is based on the original Street Fighter II, while Akuma's voice clips are from the Street Fighter Alpha series. While the music quality is not of the same rate as the arcade version, the danger versions of the stage themes are included just like the arcade version's and there are exclusive remixes as well. Akuma can use the Shun Goku Satsu as a Super Combo, unlike in the arcade version (where he had none). The player can also unlock \\"Shin Akuma\\", a variation of Akuma who boasts even greater fighting skills, in addition to the regular version. He can also use the Shun Goku Satsu Super Combo. Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition In 2003, Capcom released this version of the game that allowed you to select every previous iteration of the main cast over the course of the 5 different main SF2 titles (World Warrior, Champion Edition, Hyper Fighting, Super, Super Turbo), provided that character was selectable in that game. This version was released on CPS2 arcade, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix In 2008, Capcom published Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, an HD port of the game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 available as a downloadable title. It was developed by Backbone Entertainment. It features a 1080p resolution with graphics by artists from Udon (authors of the Street Fighter comic book series), an arranged soundtrack provided by Overclocked Remix, and adjustments to the game's balance by David Sirlin with input from the competitive community. This version was based on the source code from Super Street Fighter II X for Matching Service for Dreamcast. The game allows you to select between normal and \\"classic\\" mode, which uses classic sprites and doesn't use the balance changes. It was played at EVO Championship Series in 2009 and 2010. Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers In 2017, Capcom announced they would be making Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers for the Nintendo Switch. This version adds Evil Ryu (previously introduced in the Alpha series) and Violent Ken (introduced in SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos), and allows players to select Akuma on the character select screen. Also, Shin Akuma is now a playable character; he can be selected by performing a series of specific button inputs on the character select screen, and is only usable offline. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Super Street Fighter II Turbo on their April 15, 1994 issue as being the second most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles like Art of Fighting 2 and Karnov's Revenge. In the January 30, 1995 issue of Gamest , Super Street Fighter II X (known as Super Turbo internationally) placed fourth place in the award for Best Game of 1994 and Best Fighting Game, but did not rank in any of the other awards. On release, Famicom Ts≈´shin scored the 3DO version of the game a 29 out of 40.3DO GAMES CROSS REVIEW: „Çπ„Éº„Éë„Éº„Çπ„Éà„É™„Éº„Éà„Éï„Ç°„Ç§„Çø„ÉºII X. Weekly Famicom Ts≈´shin. No.330. Pg.78. 14 April 1995. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the 3DO version a unanimous score of 8/10, commenting that the graphics and content accurately recreate the arcade version, and that the control is \\"near perfect\\" even when using the standard 3DO pad. In contrast, GamePro stated that the control is imperfect even with Panasonic's six-button controller, and is terrible with the standard pad due to the \\"mushy\\" D-pad. They also criticized the absence of the older versions of the fighters and concluded that the port, though \\"a reasonably close translation of the coin-op\\", falls second to the SNES version of Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting among Street Fighter II conversions. A reviewer for Next Generation concurred with GamePro that the 3DO controllers are not optimal for the game, but still held it to be \\"without a doubt, the best version [of Street Fighter II ] to hit home systems.\\" He described the conversion as \\"colorful, fast, and so impressive you hardly notice the disk access time between rounds.\\" Arcade Sushi ranked Super Street Fighter II Turbo as the \\"best fighting game\\", adding that it \\"is easily the most loved, and the most played game in the franchise.

They praised it as the \\"ultimate beat 'em up\\" while their only criticism was the \\"Slow CD access\\" times. In 2019, Game Informer ranked it as the 3rd best fighting game of all time.https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2019/apr/19/what-are-top-30-fighting- games-all-time-game-informer-offers-their-full-list/ Competitive play Super Street Fighter II Turbo has been a staple in the competitive fighting game scene for its entire existence in one form or another. It was a featured game at the Evolution Championship Series (EVO) from 2002 to 2008. Its remixed version, Super Street Fighter II Turbo: HD Remix, was played in 2009 and 2010.

After a meeting with Beethoven around 1815‚Äì16, he decided to devote himself to music and became a private music teacher in Bratislava. From 1821 he worked as a stage composer and conductor at the municipal theatres in Dresden (from 1821), Leipzig (from 1827), and the Court Theatre at Hanover (from 1830), where the opera Hans Heiling (1833) established his name among the leading German opera composers of the time.Stanley Sadie (ed.): The Grove Concise Dictionary of Music (London: Macmillan, 1988), p. 466. He died in Hanover. Legacy Marschner was widely regarded as one of the most important composers in Europe from about 1830 until the end of the 19th century. He was a rival of Weber and friend of Beethoven and Mendelssohn. His operas often contain thematic material based on folksong, and this folk-influenced genre had begun with Weber's Der Freisch√ºtz (1821). The last of his operas, Austin, was first staged in 1852. It was not very well received, and later the increasingly renowned Wagner overshadowed him. Robert Schumann praised Marschner's piano trios lavishly.\\"Piano Trio No. 5 in D minor, Op. 138\\", Edition Silvertrust Marschner did not just toss off these works as an afterthought, but clearly devoted considerable time and effort to writing them. He gave the title \\"Grand Trio\\" to each of his works for piano, violin and cello, indicative of the importance he attached to them. In these pieces, one finds all of the emotions prevalent in the Romantic movement during the mid-19th century. To the extent that Marschner is still remembered, it is largely for his operas Hans Heiling (1833), Der Vampyr (1828) and Der Templer und die J√ºdin (1829), extremely popular in his lifetime. Marschner's ability to depict supernatural horror by musical means is especially evident in the first two operas as well as in some of his ballads, such as \\"\\" (c. 1839). Next to his operas, Marschner's most significant musical contribution is to the Lied. The best of his works in this form are comparable with those by Carl Loewe. He also wrote a considerable amount of chamber music, including seven piano trios, as well as unaccompanied male choruses that were very popular in the nineteenth century. While Marschner's operas strongly influenced Wagner, his chamber music, songs, and his cantata ' (1842) were admired by Schumann, whose cantata Paradise and the Peri (1843) shows the older composer's influence. Marschner's Bagatelles for guitar (1814) have been taken up lately by some guitarists, and some of his chamber music is still very occasionally played. Among his operas, Hans Heiling and especially Der Vampyr have been adapted and revived in recent years with considerable success.

The company was founded in 1973 by Michael Budman and Don Green. In 2015, Roots was sold to Searchlight Capital Partners LP, an America investment firm. Their design centre and leather factory are located in Toronto, Ontario. Roots employs 2,000 people in Canada.Shaw, Holly, ‚ÄúSinking Roots in Canada,‚Äù Financial Post, June 10, 2011.

Roots started using the beaver logo in 1985 with the launch of their athletic brand. The logo was designed in the 1970s and features the illustration by Heather Cooper with the company name below it set in the Cooper font, created by Oswald Cooper in 1919. History In 1973, Michael Budman and Don Green founded Roots, initially a footwear company that sold negative-heel shoes, before expanding their products. The Kowalewski family and their family business, the Boa Shoe Company, were the first makers of Budman's and Green's negative-heel shoes, which became Roots' defining product. In August 1973, Roots opened its first store on Yonge St. near Rosedale subway station in Toronto. A couple of months later, Roots bought the Upin and Ipin Company and opened their own first leather factory.Ryval, Michael, ‚ÄúRoots firmly planted,‚Äù Toronto Life, Mar 1977, p.113, p.115 By the end of the year, Roots had stores in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, and a few locations in the U.S.Toronto Life, March 1977, p. 115. Roots' negative-heel shoes competed with similar shoes sold by Kals√∏ Earth Shoe, which had first entered the North American market in 1970. Experts expressed varying opinions on whether negative-heel shoes were good or bad for one's feet. Expansion Roots store in Yorkdale Mall, Toronto Roots store on Bloor St. in Toronto As the demand for Roots' negative- heel shoes continued, the Roots factory expanded and by the fall of 1975 the factory that had been making only 30 pairs of shoes a day was making more than 2,000.Posner, Michael. ‚ÄúHappy Campers,‚Äù Toronto Life, October 1993. p.53 Later that year, Roots decided to experiment with casual apparel.Pevere, Geoff. Team Spirit, 1998. p.112. By 1977, Roots had expanded to 65 retail outlets across North America and Europe, and 250 employees.Ryval, 54. Roots then began the transition from making negative-heel shoes to making footwear with a wedge sole and also introduced classic handbags. The company began wholesaling bags, footwear, belts, and leather jackets to Canadian retailers like Eaton‚Äôs and Holt Renfrew, and major U.S. retailers such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdales, and Nordstrom. Roots continued to expand its product line by introducing Roots Design in 1979, their first line of men‚Äôs tailored clothing. This started with leather jackets that were produced in a small building in Port Credit, Mississauga. By the end of 1980, with the closing of many stores in the U.S. and Europe, Roots began to expand in Canada. The expansion ushered in the manufacturing of T-shirts and sweatshirts on a small scale, and the creation of the brand‚Äôs label Beaver Canoe, a joint venture canoe building operation with Camp Tamakwa‚Äôs co-founder Omer Stringer. Clothing and outdoor items were then created under the Beaver Canoe brand in 1983. Two years later, Roots launched Roots Beaver Athletics (RBA) with the beaver logo and by the early nineties, the logo had appeared on more than a million garments.Pevere, 114. Roots began to expand in Asia in 1993, starting with two stores in Japan, where Negative Heel Shoes had a second life and continued to expand throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Although Roots stores have closed in certain areas of Asia, Roots in Taiwan and China began to expand in the 2000s. Over the last few years, these stores have expanded their product offering to include apparel as well as leather goods, kids apparel, and home furnishings. Roots Taiwan launched a separate website in 2011. As of May 2013, Roots had 75 retail outlets in Taiwan and 16 in China but with plans for full closure. In 2001, the company was involved with the creation of a new Canadian discount airline, Roots Air, which operated Airbus A320 and Boeing 727-200 jetliners in scheduled passenger service. However, the experiment was short lived and the airline was shut down in the same year.

Roots created a special retail collection of clothes in honour of the 1994 Canadian Olympic team, under the banner \\"Roots Salutes the Canadian Olympic Team\\". Roots designed a jacket for the Norwegian skier and Olympic Gold Medalist Stein Eriksen for the Olympic Games in Lillehammer in 1994. In 1998, Roots began its formal epic games involvement, outfitting the Canadian team at the Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. The outfit's most popular item was the red ‚Äúpoorboy‚Äù cap (or poor boy cap) worn backwards, which were seen on celebrities such as Prince William and P. Diddy. Roots at one point sold 100,000 of these berets a day at $19.95 USD a piece, eventually selling over half a million. Roots went on to be the official gamer for members of the Canadian Olympic and Paralympic Teams from 2000 to 2004, and was the official outfitter for the Canadian Speed Skating Team in 2006. Roots outfitted the United States Olympic and Paralympic Teams in 2002, 2004, and 2006. Other teams that Roots outfitted include the British Olympic Team (2002, 2004), and the Barbados Olympic Team (2004). In 2005, Roots was outbid on the Canadian Olympic contract by the Hudson's Bay Company (sold through The Bay and Zellers), and in 2008 the USOC replaced Roots with Polo Ralph Lauren. The USOC had a disagreement with Roots over the direction of the athletes' uniforms, but it is also suggested that Roots did not want its brand to be involved with the 2008 Summer Olympics which saw much political controversy over human rights. Today Roots' famous sweats on display Roots has 120 stores in North America, including five flagship stores in Canada in Toronto (Bloor St., The Eaton Centre, and Yorkdale Shopping Centre), Vancouver (on Robson St.), and Montreal (Centreville). The large two-story Bloor St. location, which was known for holding many events, recently downsized to a new location on the same street. Other notable locations include Rosedale in Toronto, Chinook and West Edmonton Mall in Alberta. In 2013, Roots opened locations in Montreal (Westmount), Niagara Falls (Spring Garden). Recent expansions and improvement to their retail stores have brought about \\"enhanced experience stores\\" which offer guests the additional services of customizing their leather orders with a range of 16 available bag styles or custom award jackets (varsity jackets) or personalizing their Salt and Pepper sweatsuits with various patches. This can be found in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver. After years of running the business together, in 2014 Michael Budman and Don Green hired a President and Chief Operating Officer, Wendy Bennison, who had previously employed as Vice President of Mark's Work Warehouse. In 2015, Roots was sold to Searchlight Capital LP which now holds majority stake with the Founders retaining a minority stake. Jim Gabel had joined in February 2016 as the President of Roots Canada. He left the company in January 2020. The board of directors has appointed Meghan Roach as interim Chief Executive Officer while they search for replacement. In September 2017, the company filed for an initial public offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

It was his final work in this form. The piece is highly chromatic and atonal like Scriabin's other late works, although arguably less dissonant than most of his late works. It is characterized by frequent trills and tremolos. It is sometimes called his \\"Insect Sonata\\", referring to his words: \\"My Tenth Sonata is a sonata of insects. Insects are born from the sun [...] they are the kisses of the sun.\\" The atmosphere of the introductory pages of the Tenth Sonata is veiled and distant, like an impressionist reflection, but much more intensely elevated and spiritual. Trills soon sweep into every corner of the music, and in the last pages they are transformed into a glorious reverberation, as if shimmering with pulses of glowing light and taking on lives of their own. Such life and light/sound corroborations are typical of the composer's own imaginative world. The tenth sonata is in closer dialogue with Sonata Form than some of his other sonatas. It opens with a few desolate notes, forming an augmented chord and then a diminished chord. Then, it moves on to a simple chromatic theme, and then back to the opening theme. Scriabin then introduces the luminous trills that pervade the rest of the piece, and then moves on to a third theme with a chromatically descending melody. Following the sonata format, these three themes take on a modified form in the development before settling down to the recapitulation. During the middle portion, the feverish buzzing rises to an orgasmic climax that thrusts both hands' trills into the upper register of the instrument. The very first, single-line gesture of the piece is not given again until after the richly- varied \\"recapitulation\\" has been made; it arrives quite unexpectedly, and is punctuated by a falling fourth in the bass that ends on C natural -- a pitch that, in his last music, assumes great significance for Scriabin, who came to view it as a kind of cleansing tonal focus.https://www.allmusic.com/composition/piano-sonata-no-10-trill- op-70-mc0002371124 Like Scriabin's other sonatas, it is both technically and musically highly demanding for the pianist. A typical performance is about 12 minutes. Notable recorded performances of this piece include that of Scriabin‚Äôs son-in-law and musical champion, Vladimir Sofronitzky, and that of the great pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who also championed many of Scriabin‚Äôs works throughout his long career. The Russian virtuoso Arcadi Volodos took the very unusual step of opening his Carnegie Hall debut concert with this Sonata, reflecting a daring approach to programming as well as a commitment to Scriabin‚Äôs legacy. More recently, Yuja Wang delivered a performance of the Sonata in recital at Carnegie Hall, as well as the Philharmonie in Berlin.

Opened in 1992, the facility sits on along Yaquina Bay near the Pacific Ocean. The aquarium was home to Keiko, the orca who starred in the movie Free Willy, from January 7, 1996 until September 9, 1998, when he was shipped to Vestmannaeyjar, Iceland. USA Today considers the Oregon Coast Aquarium world-class and Coastal Living magazine ranks it among the top ten aquariums in North America. History Newport business leaders proposed building an aquarium beginning in the early 1980s. They proposed a $7 million facility in 1982 as a way to boost the local economy. Two years later they incorporated as a non-profit, and increased fundraising efforts in 1987, collecting $11 million by 1991. Plans to turn along Yaquina Bay in Newport into a \\"world class\\" aquarium were finalized in 1990. The Aquarium was designed by SRG Architects, Portland: BIOS:Inc, of Seattle, and Walker/Macy Landscape Architects, Portland, Oregon. Keiko at the aquarium in 1998 After early bids were rejected by the aquarium's board of directors, Mountain States Construction was selected to build the first phase for about $12 million in August 1990. Plans for the first phase included construction of a building and four acres of outdoor exhibits, with completion expected in spring 1992. Construction began in August 1990 on phase one, with two other phases expected to start three years and eight years later. On May 23, 1992, the Oregon Coast Aquarium opened with about 5,500 visitors the first day. Those in attendance on the first day included Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Governor Barbara Roberts, and Congressmen Mike Kopetski and Les AuCoin. The opening theme of the aquarium was following the path of a raindrop from the Oregon Coast Range all the way to the Pacific Ocean. On January 7, 1996, Keiko the killer whale arrived on a United Parcel Service C-130 cargo plane, with freight expenses donated by the company. This move from Reino Aventura, an amusement park in Mexico City, came after fund raising by environmentalists and school children to build a $7.8 million habitat for the movie star in Oregon. Keiko was moved to Iceland in 1998 in an attempt to return him to the wild. For 2012, the aquarium had 450,000 visitors and earned $850,000 on about $7.3 million in revenues. Exhibits The Oregon Coast Aquarium's collection focuses on the flora and fauna native to the Oregon Coast. The aquarium is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. =Main building= Exhibits in the main building include four permanent displays: Sandy Shores, Rocky Shores, Coastal Waters, and a changing exhibit area. The first features fish and invertebrates that live either close to shore or in bays such as Yaquina Bay. Progressing, the aquarium displays feature animals further offshore ending in a kelp forest and sea jelly exhibit. Flanking the permanent displays are the changing exhibits. There are also exhibits focusing on small marine life in the area including jellyfish, and a tidepool exhibit in which visitors may touch sea stars and sea anemones. Temporary exhibits have included \\"Turtles,\\" \\"Swampland,\\" Claws that featured crustaceans, and Oddwater, which featured unusual sea creatures such as the green-blooded cuttlefish and the jet-powered chambered nautilus. =Passages of the Deep= The acrylic tunnel The largest exhibit is \\"Passages of the Deep\\", in Keiko's former tank, it features walk- through acrylic tubes surrounded by deep water marine animals such as sharks, rays, and rockfish. Passages of the Deep was created in Keiko's former home, and has three sections. Orford Reef contains mostly rockfish and other smaller Pacific-Northwest fish. Halibut Flats contains halibut, ling cod, a small ray, and other large fish, and includes a mock sunken ship. Open Sea is last section in the tunnel, and holds many species of sharks including seven gill sharks, as well as rays, mackerel, anchovies and salmon. =Seabird Aviary= The aviary at Oregon Coast Aquarium exhibits sea and shore birds. Those on display include the seabirds tufted puffin, common murre, rhinoceros auklet, pigeon guillemot, and the shore bird black oystercatcher. The seabird aviary includes two large pools and rocky cliffs. =Outdoor exhibits= The Aquarium has the largest outdoor Seabird Aviary in North America, which is home to tufted and horned puffins, black oystercatchers, common murres, rhinoceros auklets and pigeon guillemots. The Aquarium also exhibits two turkey vultures in a separate outdoor area. Outdoor exhibits also showcase marine mammal species native to the Oregon Coast, including sea otters, harbor seals and California sea lions. are the outdoor mammal exhibits. They contain sea otters, harbor seals, and sea lions. There is even a coastal cave that houses a giant Pacific octopus. The rocks in the outdoor exhibit are artificial rocks constructed of gunite. The Aquarium is also home to a nature trail that overlooks the Yaquina Bay estuary and features native plants and free-roaming wildlife.

It is owned by the South Korean company LG Electronics. Zenith was previously an American brand of consumer electronics, a manufacturer of radio and television receivers and other consumer electronics, and was headquartered in Glenview, Illinois. After a series of layoffs, the consolidated headquarters moved to Lincolnshire, Illinois. For many years, their famous slogan was \\"The quality goes in before the name goes on\\" (this slogan was borrowed from the Crown Piano made by Geo. P Bent of Chicago).Advertisement in the periodical \\"The World Today\\" December 1906 LG Electronics acquired a controlling share of Zenith in 1995; Zenith became a wholly owned subsidiary in 1999. Zenith was the inventor of subscription television and the modern remote control, and the first to develop High-definition television (HDTV) in North America. Zenith-branded products were sold in North America, Germany, Thailand (to 1983), Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, India, and Myanmar. History Zenith radio, Chicago Radio Laboratory Former Zenith logo The company was co-founded by Ralph Matthews and Karl HasselMcMahon, Morgan E. A Flick of the Switch 1930‚Äì1950 (Antiques Electronics Supply, 1990), p.187. in Chicago, Illinois, as Chicago Radio LabsMcMahon, p.187. in 1918 as a small producer of amateur radio equipment. The name \\"Zenith\\" came from ZN'th, a contraction of its founders' ham radio call sign, 9ZN. They were joined in 1921 by Eugene F. McDonald, and Zenith Radio Company was formally incorporated in 1923. The fledgling company soon became known for its high-quality radios and electronic innovations. Zenith introduced the first portable radio in 1924, the first mass-produced AC radio in 1926, and push-button tuning in 1927. It added automobile radios in the 1930s with its Model 460, promoting the fact that it needed no separate generator or battery, selling at US$59.95.Mahon, p.189. The first Zenith television set appeared in 1939, with its first commercial sets sold to the public in 1948. The company is credited with having invented such things as the wireless remote control and FM multiplex stereo. For many years Zenith used the slogan \\"the quality goes in before the name goes on\\". This phrase was used by the Geo. P. Bent piano company of Chicago as early as 1906.The World Today Dec. 1906 Zenith established one of the first FM stations in the country in 1940 (Chicago's WWZR, later called WEFM, named for Zenith executive Eugene F. McDonald), which was among the earliest FM multiplex stereo stations, first broadcasting in stereo in June 1961. The station was sold in the early 1970s and is now WUSN. Zenith also pioneered in the development of high-contrast and flat-face picture tubes, and the multichannel television sound (MTS) stereo system used on analog television broadcasts in the United States and Canada (as opposed to the BBC-developed NICAM digital stereo sound system for analog television broadcasts, used in many places around the world.) Zenith was also one of the first companies to introduce a digital HDTV system implementation, parts of which were included in the ATSC standard starting with the 1993 model Grand Alliance. They were also one of the first American manufacturers to market a home VCR, selling a Sony-built Betamax video recorder starting in 1977. The 1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory (50th Anniversary edition) lists Zenith Radio Corporation as having a total of 11,000 employees of which at least 6,460 were employed in seven Chicago plants. The corporate office was in plant number 1 located at 6001 West Dickens Avenue (north of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific railroad tracks) where 2,500 workers made radio and television sets and Hi-Fi stereophonic phonographs. Plant number 2 was located at 1500 North Kostner Ave. where 2,100 employees made government electronics, radio and television components, transistors and hearing aids. Plant number 3 was located at 5801 West Dickens Ave. (also north of the Milwaukee Road tracks) where 300 employees made electronics and servicing. Plant number 4 was located at 3501 West Potomac Ave. where 60 employees performed warehousing. Plant number 5 located at 6501 West Grand Ave. employed 500-600 workers who made government hi-fi equipment. A subsidiary of Zenith, the Rauland Corporation, located at 4245 North Knox Avenue, employed 850 workers who made television picture tubes. The other Zenith subsidiary in Chicago was Central Electronics, Incorporated located at 1247 West Belmont Ave. where 100 employees made amateur radio equipment and performed auditory training. The other Central Electronics plant was located at State Route 133 and Grandview in Paris, Illinois where 500 employees made radio receivers, with the total Zenith work force in Illinois being thus at least 6,960.1962 Illinois Manufacturers Directory, Manufacturers' News, Inc., Chicago, IL., copyright 1962, p. 1311 The last logo used during the U.S.-owned period, outside Zenith's corporate headquarters in Glenview, Illinois, in 1995. In December, 1970, National Union Electric (\\"NUE\\") sued most of the Japanese television manufacturers for violation of the Anti-Dumping Act and a conspiracy which violated American antitrust laws.Lehr, Jr., Louis A. (2013), Arnstein & Lehr, The First 120 Years, Amazon p. 80 During the pendency of that suit, Zenith Radio Corporation encountered increasing financial difficulty as their market share progressively went to Japanese companies. Concerned about losing market share to Japanese companies, Zenith filed suit in federal court in Philadelphia in 1974 against the major Japanese television and electronic manufacturers charging violation of the United States Antitrust Laws and the Anti-Dumping Act of 1916.New York Times, September 21, 1974 Zenith joined two United States companies Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Motorola, Inc. as co- plaintiffs.Washington University Law Review, 58 Wash. U.L.Q. 1055 (1980) The NUE suit was transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the two suits were consolidated for pretrial proceedings and trial. The suit, styled In re Japanese Electric Products Antitrust Litigation, sought $900 million in damages.Chicago Tribune, September 30, 1974 By the end of 1983, Zenith had spent millions of dollars in connection with the litigation.The Philadelphia Inquirer, December 15, 1983 In 1981, the trial court entered summary judgment on the antitrust and antidumping claims and dismissed the lawsuits.The New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast), March 28, 1981 Plaintiffs appealed and the appellate court affirmed the summary judgment for Sears, Roebuck and Co., Motorola, Inc. and Sony.Chicago Tribune, December 6, 1983 The case was appealed, and in March 1986 the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of the defendants on Zenith‚Äôs antitrust claims.The New York Times, Late Edition (East Coast), March 27, 1986 Zenith's hopes to salvage a victory on the claims that the defendants violated the Antidumping Act of 1916 ended in April 1987 when the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal from the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Philadelphia which upheld the ruling of the trial court in favor of the Japanese.The Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, April 28, 1987 In 1979, Zenith entered the computer market with the purchase of Heath Company from Schlumberger for $64.5 million, and formed Zenith Data Systems (ZDS). The company changed its name to Zenith Electronics Corporation in 1984, to reflect its interests in computers and CATV, and since it had left the radio business two years earlier. By the late 1980s ZDS's profits sustained Zenith while its television business had lost money for years. To raise money for HDTV research efforts and reduce debt, Zenith sold ZDS to Groupe Bull in October 1989 for $635 million. By 1990, Zenith was in trouble and looking more attractive to a hostile takeover. To avoid this, Zenith sold 5% of itself to the Korean company GoldStar (now LG Electronics) as part of a technology-sharing agreement. With their analog line aging (the last major update to the line had been the System¬≥ chassis in 1978), and the adoption of HDTV in the United States decades away, Zenith's prospects were not good. In 1995 LG increased its stake to 55 percent, enough to assume controlling interest. Zenith filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1999, and in exchange for its debts, LG bought the remaining 45 percent of the company. During this era, some of Zenith's products were being rebadged as OEM under the Admiral name. Certain products also carried the Allegro brand (which originated in the 1970s as a brand for Zenith's speakers and other audio equipment). Their profitable Network Systems division‚Äîthat produced set-top boxes for cable and satellite TV‚Äîwas sold to Motorola in the summer of 2000 and became part of Motorola BCS (Broadband Communications Sector). The Zenith headquarters building was subsequently occupied by Aon and was demolished in 2018 to create room for nearby Abt Electronics to expand. LG produced the Zenith DTT-900 and Zenith DTT-901 ATSC digital television converter box. LG also offered some Zenith branded plasma, LCD, and direct view televisions through selected retail outlets. Famous products =Shortwave radio= A Zenith Model 5-S-220 \\"cube\\" radio circa 1937. Among Zenith's early famous products were the 'Royal' series of transistor radios and the 'Trans-Oceanic' series of shortwave portable radios, which were produced from 1942 to 1981. =Subscription television= Zenith was the first company to experiment with subscription television, launching their Phonevision system with experimental Chicago station KS2XBS (originally broadcasting on Channel 2 before the Federal Communications Commission forced them to relinquish it to WBBM-TV). Their experiment involved a descrambler box mounted on the television set, and plugged into the telephone lead. When a preannounced broadcast was ready to begin, viewers would call an operator at Zenith who would send a signal with the telephone leads to unscramble the video.\\"Phonevision\\" Time January 8, 1951 While the Theatre Owners of America claimed the concept was unsuccessful, Zenith itself claimed the experiment was a success.\\"Report on Phonevision\\" Time June 4, 1951 As Phonevision broadcast films, it was seen as a potential competitor for traditional theatres. In spite of the fact that the three films initially available to the first 300 test households were more than two years old, about 18 percent of Phonevision viewers had seen them at the movies, and 92 percent of Phonevision households reported that they would prefer to see films at home. =Remote controls= Zenith is, perhaps, best known for the first practical wireless television remote control, the Space Command, developed in 1956. A Zenith Space Command 600 remote control. A box advertising a remote control system often referred to as \\"Space Command Tuning\\" The original television remote control was a wired version, released in 1950, that soon attracted complaints about an unsightly length of cable from the viewer's chair to the television receiver. Eugene F. McDonald, Zenith President and founder, ordered his engineers to develop a wireless version, but the use of radio waves was soon discounted due to poor interference rejection inherent in 1950s radio receivers. The 1955 Flash-Matic remote system, invented by Eugene Polley, used a highly directional photo flash tube in the hand held unit that was aimed at sensitive photoreceivers in the four front corners of the television cabinet. However, bright sunlight falling on the television was found to activate the controls. It is worth noting that these remote controls would activate a motor, causing the tuning dial on the television to switch by itself, and this could be used for mischief if someone else was attempting to tune the television. Lead engineer Robert Adler then suggested that ultrasonic sound be used as a trigger mechanism. This was produced in the hand held unit by mechanically-struck aluminum rods of carefully constructed dimensions‚Äîa receiver in the television responded to the different frequencies this action produced. Enough audible noise was produced by pressing the buttons that consumers began calling remote controls \\"clickers\\". The miniaturization of electronics meant that, eventually, the sounds were produced in the remote unit electronically; however, the operating principle remained in use until the 1980s, when it was superseded by the infrared light system. The photograph is of a Space Command 600, which was the remote control designed for use with their color television receivers. The Space Command 600 was introduced in 1965 and this particular design was in use until the end of the 1972 model year. The Space Command 600 remote control had an additional, distinctive feature‚Äîthis remote control could also adjust color hues. By pressing the mute button on the remote, a relay would be activated at the television in which to transfer the VHF motor drive tuner circuit to the motorized hue control. This would allow the user to adjust the hue in increments by depressing the channel up or down buttons on the remote control, and restore the television to normal tuning operation when the mute button was pressed again (mute off). =Space phone= Some models of Zenith's System 3 line of televisions made from the late 1970s to the early 1990s had a feature called the Space Phone by Zenith. It was basically a hands-free speakerphone built into the television set. It used the set's speaker and remote control, in addition to a built-in microphone. A Space Phone-enabled television would connect to a telephone jack (using a built-in phone cord), and making a call was performed by pressing a button on the remote to activate the Space Phone (which would mute and begin controlling the program audio going to the speaker). The telephone number is dialed using the numeric keys on the remote, which then displays the digits being dialed on-screen (using the on-screen display features of the System 3 line). The user could then converse with another caller hands-free, much like a regular speakerphone. =Zoom= A feature that was included in Zenith's \\"Space Command 1000\\" remote control first used in 1976 in Chromacolor and later System 3 (1978) was the zoom feature. This feature allowed for the image being displayed on the television screen to be zoomed into, by overscanning the raster of the CRT so that the middle of the image would be displayed. Zenith vacuum tube carton =The porthole television= In the late 1940s, Zenith entered the television market. These sets were all-round tube sets. The main feature was that the entire round screen was exposed. They were available in 12-inch, 16-inch and 19-inch sizes. Later round-tube models had a switch that would show the picture in the 4:3 ratio, or have the entire round screen exposed. These sets are very desirable among television collectors. Many porthole sets used metal- cone CRTs, which are now scarce. It is not uncommon for collectors to replace a bad metal-cone tube with an all-glass tube. Zenith porthole sets came in tabletop models, stand-alone consoles and television/radio/phono combos. =Hand wired chassis= In the late 1950s, many electronic manufacturers, such as RCA, General Electric and Admiral, were changing from hand-wired metal chassis in their radios and televisions to printed circuit boards. While circuit boards save time and errors in assembly, they are not well suited for use with vacuum tube equipment, in which high temperatures are generated that can break down boards, eventually causing the boards to crumble if one attempts to remove a tube. Zenith, and to a lesser extent Motorola, avoided this problem by continuing to use hand wired chassis in all their vacuum tube equipment. Zenith kept circuit boards out of their televisions until the Chromacolor line of the early 1970s, and even then used them only with solid state components, mounting the four tubes used in the Chromacolor \\"4 tube hybrid\\" on the steel chassis. Zenith began using circuit boards in radios when they converted to solid-state in the late 1960s, but even Zenith's early transistor radios were completely hand wired with socketed transistors. Due to the use of this chassis construction (and the high quality components), Zenith televisions and radios of the 1950s to 1970s found today are often still working well, needing little work to restore them to like-new operating condition. = Teletext = Zenith was one of the few manufacturers of television sets in North America to support teletext on a wide basis. Beginning in 1983, the company manufactured standalone teletext decoders as well as TV sets with decoders built-in; initially, these were only offered in Cincinnati, OH, where the Electra service had been started by Taft Broadcasting at their flagship, WKRC-TV. The service expanded nationally two years later, when Satellite Syndicated Systems inserted the service into the VBI of the national feed of Superstation WTBS (which they were responsible for uplinking). However, the teletext decoders were never sold nationally and the TVs with built-in decoders were frequently the expensive \\"flagship\\" models, which were bought by people more for these models' console cabinets and Bose speakers, reducing teletext's reach. It was further complicated by the fact that Electra utilized the World Service Teletext protocol, as opposed to the more complicated NABTS protocol which had been favored by CBS and NBC during their teletext experiments early in the decade. In 1993, the Electra service was shuttered, and by that point, Zenith dropped teletext support (as the teletext system was incompatible with the now-required American standards for closed-captioning).

The historical sources are vague as to the exact region they inhabited, though an association is thought to be indicated in the names of two hills with fortifications. Near the summit of Dumyat hill in the Ochils, overlooking Stirling, there are remains of a fort and the name of the hill (in Gaelic D√πn Mh√®ad) is believed to derive from name meaning the hill of the Maeatae. This prominent hill fort may have marked their northern boundary, while Myot Hill near Fankerton plausibly marks their southern limits. A discussion of two views of the importance of Dumyat and Myot Hill is given in Wainwright. As for the tribes themselves Dio also quoted by Joseph Ritson and others describes them in detail although some of the descriptions look suspicious to the modern eye. John Rhys seems convinced that they occupied the land between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Tay or parts of what is now Clackmannanshire, Fife and Stirlingshire. He also suggests that the Isle of May might derive its name from the tribe. Dio mentions the Maeatae were between the wall and the Caledonians but there is some dispute over whether he is referring to Antonine's Wall or Hadrian's Wall. Alexander del Mar says no-one really knows the identity of the Maeatae but he mentions that some authorities think they may have had a Norse origin. They appear to have come together as a result of treaties struck between the Roman Empire and the various frontier tribes in the 180s AD under the governorship of Ulpius Marcellus. Virius Lupus is recorded as being obliged to buy peace from the Maeatae at the end of the second century. In 210 AD they began a serious revolt against the Roman Empire which was reportedly a very bloody affair on both sides. Another revolt took place the following year. In 213 AD, Joseph Ritson records them receiving money from the Romans to keep the peace. The Miathi, mentioned in Adomn√°n's Life of Columba, probably to be identified with the Southern Picts, have been posited as the same group, their identity seemingly surviving in some form as late as the 6th or 7th centuries AD.

Taiwan Beer (, or ) is a large-market beer brewed by the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation (TTL). The brand, an icon of Taiwanese culture, began as a monopoly product but has remained the best- selling beer in the country. History The company today known as TTL had its origins in a government agency established by Taiwan's Japanese rulers in 1901. The Monopoly Bureau of the Taiwan Governor's Office was responsible for all liquor and tobacco products sold in Taiwan as well as opium, salt, and camphor. In 1922 the Monopoly Bureau began brewing Takasago Beer through the Takasago Malted Beer Company. Light and dark varieties were produced. The price of Takasago Beer varied widely over the course of its manufacture, depending on the availability of imported Japanese beers in Taiwan and on the contingencies of the economy.http://en.ttl.com.tw/Taipei/index.asp As World War II reached its conclusion in the 1940s, matches, petroleum, and standard weights and measures also came under the Monopoly Bureau's authority. After the end of World War II the incoming Chinese Nationalists preserved the monopoly system for alcohol and tobacco. Production of beer was assigned in 1945 to the Taiwan Provincial Monopoly Bureau. The name Taiwan Beer was adopted in 1946. The following year, production of the beer was assigned to the Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau. In the 1960s locally produced was added to the fermentation process, resulting in the distinctive local flavour for which the beer is known today. Taiwan entered its modern period of pluralistic democracy in the 1990s. Free trade and open markets became priorities as Taiwan prepared for admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002. Laws went into force that year that opened Taiwan's market to competing products. On 2002-07-01 the Monopoly Bureau passed into history. Its successor, the Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corporation, is a publicly owned company that competes in the marketplace. TTL introduced a new brew, Taiwan Beer Gold Medal, by the end of its first year. Since then the product line has expanded to include Taiwan Beer Draft (a lager for restaurant sales), two malt beers under the Mine label (Amber and Dark), and four fruit-flavoured beers. Taiwan Beer remains the island's best-selling beer brand and is one of the most recognized brands in Taiwan's business world. Beer Taiwan Beer is an amber lager beer with a distinct taste produced by the addition of locally produced ponlai rice (\\"Formosa rice\\" Ëì¨ËêäÁ±≥) during the fermentation process. Like all large-market beers, the original Taiwan Beer brew is filtered and pasteurized.http://www.taiwan- panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=201089908030e.txt&table;=3&cur;_page=1&distype;=text It is served cold and best complements Taiwanese and Japanese cuisine, especially seafood dishes such as sushi and sashimi. Taiwan Beer has won international awards, including the International Monde Selection in 1997 and the Brewing Industry International Awards in 2002. Taiwan Beer is mass- produced at the Taiwan Beer Factory (ÁÉèÊó•Âï§ÈÖíÂª†Ë°åÊîøÂ§ßÊ®ìÂâçÂª£Â†¥, W≈´r√¨ P√≠ji«î Ch«éng X√≠ngzh√®ng D√†l√≥u qi√°n gu«éngch«éng) in Wuri District, Taichung City. It is also brewed on site at the Taiwan Beer Bar in Taipei. Three lager-style brews bear the label Taiwan Beer. The Original brew is sold in brown bottles with a cream-coloured label and in white cans bearing a blue and green design. The Gold Medal brew, introduced in April 2003, is sold in green bottles and cans that reproduce the white, red and green label seen on the bottle. Original Taiwan beer is 4.5% and Gold is 5% by volume and are regularly seen in Taiwan's convenience and grocery stores. The newest lager, Taiwan Beer 18 days, bears a signature solid green bottle with no paper label; was sold in cans at a later date. Draft appears most often in bars and restaurants, where it is available on tap or from refrigerators. The brew, designed to be sold fresh, is less often seen in stores due to its expiration just 18 days after production. In 2013 more stores began to stock the brew as ads and labels trumpeted its early expiration date. Taiwan Beer began selling a malt brew in 2008 bearing the Mine label. Brisk sales of Mine, an amber, led to the introduction of Mine Dark two years later. Mine malts are 5% alcohol by volume. Both malts are regularly stocked in Taiwan convenience stores. Bottles wear paper labels whose designs are repeated on cans. Mine sales have reportedly fallen since the launch of the new summer fruit beer brews. In 2012 Taiwan Beer introduced two new brews with tropical fruit flavours added: mango and pineapple. With 2.8% alcohol content and sweeter flavour, these proved popular with summer drinkers. Two new flavors, grape and orange, were introduced to the line in 2013. The fruit-enhanced brews, like all Taiwan Beer brews, are made available in bottles or cans. With the increasing popularity of wheat beer such as Kronenbourg Blanc and Hoegaarden in Taiwan, Taiwan Beer launched a wheat beer of their own, Taiwan Weissbier Draft, in late 2013. It is sold in 600ml bottles and 330ml cans in most convenience stores. Culture The iconic status of the Taiwan Beer brand in Taiwanese society is reinforced by TTL marketing strategies. Ads feature celebrity endorsements by popular Taiwanese figures such as A-Mei. A basketball team named Taiwan Beer, popularly nicknamed 'The Brew Crew,' is sponsored by the company. The Taiwan Beer Bar and Beer Garden is a popular restaurant/brewery in Taipei. Restaurants and nightspots are also proliferating at the Taiwan Beer Factory in Wuri District, Taichung City. The Factory, near the Wujih station of the Taiwan High Speed Rail, is the site of an annual Taiwan Beer Festival (Âè∞ÁÅ£Âï§ÈÖíÁØÄ, T√°iwƒÅn P√≠ji«îji√©) held every summer. Competition Taiwan Beer leads its namesake market. Its main large-market competitor is Long Chuan, owned by the Taiwan Tsing Beer Corporation and brewed in Kaohsiung City. Long Chuan launched a range of fruit beers in 2012. Microbrews, handcrafted beers and other limited-distribution beers represent a separate category. Leading Taiwan artisan beers include Three Giants Brewing Company (Â∑®‰∫∫Âï§ÈÖí) with a range of Lagers, Pale Ales, IPA's, Wheat Beer and Dark Lager, Redpoint Brewing, which produced the island's first IPA called Âè∞PA,Formosa Bird Beer and Lychee Beer (both by North Taiwan Brewing) along with the house brews served in two locally owned restaurant chains, Jolly Brewery and Restaurant (operated by Great Reliance Food & Beverage) and Le ble d'or.http://www.taiwan- panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=201089908030e.txt&table;=3&cur;_page=1&distype;=text References Bibliography *Lin, Jackie. \\"Beer fight is about politics: TTL.\\" Taipei Times, 2004-07-02. *\\"2008 Taiwan Beer Festival.\\" Taipei Times, 2008-08-01.

Page 237. The Kingdom of Gorkha extended from the Marshyangdi River in the west to the Trishuli River in the east, which separated it from the kingdoms of Lamjung and Nepal respectively. Page 123. The Gorkha Kingdom was established by Prince Dravya Shah, second son of King Yasho Brahma Shah of Lamjung Kingdom, on 1559 CE replacing the Khadka chiefs.  Origin  According to legends, one of the earliest Shah rulers was Rishi-raj Rana-Ji, of the Lunar dynasty. He was made the ruler of Chittorgarh and received the title of Bhattarak.Daniel Wright, History of NepƒÅl, Cambridge University Press, 1877, Nepal. Chapter X, page 273 The lunar dynasty remained in power for thirteen generations. Then, the Muslim Yavanas took power. The Bhattarak had to abdicate and could only retain his caste family name, Rana-ji. The rajas were titled Rana-Ji for four generations and Rana-ji Rava for a further seventeen generations. Akbar, the Mughal emperor, (1542-1605) wished to marry the daughter of Fatte Sinha Rana-Ji Rava. Akbar was refused because he was from a different religion (namely Islam) than Hindu religion altogether. This decision led to war. Many Rajput, including Fatte Sinha Rana-ji Rava, were killed. The survivors of the war were led by Udaybam Rana-Ji Rava. They founded a settlement, Udaipur. Manmath Rana-Ji Rava went to Ujjain. His son Bhupal Ranaji Rao went to Ridi in the northern hills and in 1495 AD (Saka 1417), to Sargha, and then to Khium in Bhirkot. There, he cultivated the land. The new ruler of Khium had sons, Kancha and Micha. Their bartabandha (the taking of the Bharmanical thread) was performed. Plans for the boys to marry the daughters of the Raghuvanshi Rajputs were made. Kancha, the elder son went to Dhor. He conquered Magarat and reigned over Garhon, Sathum and Birkot. Micha, the younger son, went to Nuwakot in the far west and became ruler there. From Micha, a dynasty of seven rajas commenced in Nuwakot. Kulamandan, the eldest son of Jagdeva, became ruler of Kaski displacing Gurung king. He was favoured and became Shah and succeeded his father. Kalu, the second son was sent to Dura Danda in Lamjung at the people's request to become their king. Kalu was killed by the Sekhant tribe, who were the ancestor of present- day Gurungs. In the 1500s, another son, Yasobramha, became the ruler of Lamjung after he compromised with the Gurungs. The second son of Yasobramha, Dravya Shah conquered the Ghale people of neighbouring Ligligkot, now in Gorkha. Prince Dravya Shah on 1559 CE also replaced the Khandka chiefs to become the first King of Gorkha Kingdom. The ancient name of Gor-kha is White Zhou or Shakya.

Over the years, they conquered huge tracts of land to the east and west of Gorkha. Page 7.Northey, William Brook and Morris, Charles John (1928). The Gurkhas: Nepal-Their Manners, Customs and Country. Asian Educational Services. . Pages 30-31. Among their conquests, the most important and valuable acquisition was the wealthy Newar confederacy of Nepal Mandala centered in the Kathmandu Valley. Starting in 1745, the Gorkhalis mounted a blockade in a bid to starve the population into submission, but the inhabitants held out. The Newars appealed to the British East India Company to help, and in 1767, it sent an expedition under Captain Kinloch which ended in failure. The three Newar capitals of Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur fell to the Gorkhalis between 1768 and 1769. The Gorkhali king subsequently moved his capital to Kathmandu. Page 7. In 1788, the Gorkhalis turned their attention north and invaded Tibet. They seized the border towns of Kyirong and Kuti, and forced the Tibetans to pay an annual tribute. When the Tibetans stopped paying it, the Gorkhalis invaded Tibet again in 1791 and plundered the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse. This time the Chinese army came to Tibet's defence and advanced close to Kathmandu but could not achieve success due to strong counterattack with khukuri. The anxious Bahadur Shah asked for 10 howitzer mountain guns from the British East India Company. Captain William Kirkpatrick arrived in Kathmandu. Eventually, the Fu Kanggan was keen to protect his army and the war being resultless was concluded by signing a peace treaty at Betrawati. A later Nepalese‚ÄìTibetan War was fought from 1855 to 1856 in Tibet between the forces of the Tibetan government (Ganden Phodrang, then under administrative rule of the Qing dynasty) and the invading Nepalese army, resulting the victory of Nepal. The Gorkha dominion reached its height at the beginning of the 19th century, extending all along the Himalayan foothills from Kumaon and Garhwal in the west to Sikkim in the east. They were made to return much of the occupied territories after their defeat in the Anglo- Nepalese War (1814‚Äì1816) later during the gorkha Sikh war (1809) they lost the control over Kangra Valley. Gorkha to Nepal Postage stamp issued by Gorkha government in 1907 Gorkhapatra dated January 9, 1933 The Gorkha dominion continued to be known as Gorkha Rajya (meaning the Gorkha Kingdom) until the beginning of the 20th century. Historically, the name 'Nepal' referred mainly to Kathmandu valley, the homeland of the Newars. Since the 1930s, the state began using it to refer to the entire country and 'Nepal Khaldo' (Nepal Valley) became 'Kathmandu Valley'. The name Gorkha Sarkar (meaning Gorkha government) was also changed to Nepal government. Similarly, the Gorkhali language was renamed as Nepali in 1933.Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns. New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. . Page 3. The term Gorkhali in the former national anthem entitled \\"Shreeman Gambhir\\" was changed to Nepali in 1951. The government newspaper, launched in 1901, is still known as Gorkhapatra (meaning Gorkha gazette). The Shah dynasty ruled Nepal until 2008 when it became a republic following a people's movement. Today, Gorkha District, roughly corresponding to the old kingdom, is one of the 77 administrative districts of Nepal. Gurkhas and Gorkhas Gurkha soldiers arrive in Japan in 1946 as part of Allied occupation forces Not to be confused with the inhabitants of the old Gorkha Kingdom only, the Gurkhas are also military units in the British or the Indian army (where they are known as Gorkhas) enlisted in Nepal and India. Their history goes back to the Anglo-Gorkha War and the Sugauli Treaty of 1816. It allowed the British East India Company to recruit men from the Gorkha kingdom hills to serve as mercenaries. During World War II (1939‚Äì45), a total of 250,280 Gurkhas served in 40 battalions, plus eight Nepalese Army battalions, plus parachute, training, garrison, and porter units. They earned 2,734 bravery awards, and suffered around 32,000 casualties in all theatres.

It was finally published in 1898, at the urging of his publisher. The piece is in two movements, with a style combining Chopin-like Romanticism with an impressionistic touch. The piece is widely appreciated and is one of Scriabin's most popular pieces. The first movement Andante begins with echoing effects, followed by two lyrically themed sections. After a short climax, the piece modulates to E major (also C-sharp minor) and lyrical sections are restated with a slightly more complicated accompaniment. The second movement Presto, in sharp contrast to the first movement, is very fast and intense. Alternating crescendos and decrescendos may give the listener the impression of waves. The precedent of Beethoven's \\"Moonlight\\" Sonata allowed Scriabin the luxury of an opening slow movement to his Second Sonata, whose programme reads thus: \\"The first section represents the quiet of a southern night on the seashore; the development is the dark agitation of the deep, deep sea. The E major middle section shows caressing moonlight coming up after the first darkness of night. The second movement represents the vast expanse of ocean in stormy agitation.\\" Typical of Scriabin's piano sonatas, it is technically and musically demanding for the pianist. A typical performance lasts about 11 minutes.

The immature form of this species is sometimes known as the spiny elm caterpillar. Other older names for this species include grand surprise and white petticoat. A powerful flier, this species is sometimes found in areas far from its usual range during migration. These butterflies have a lifespan of 11 to 12 months, one of the longest lifespans for any butterfly. It is also the state insect of the U.S. state of Montana, adopted in 2001. Etymology = North American name \\"mourning cloak\\" = In several European countries with Germanic languages, other than Britain, the name for this butterfly literally translates to \\"mourning cloak\\", such as German \\"Trauermantel\\", Dutch \\"rouwmantel\\", Swedish \\"sorgmantel\\", Finnish \\"suruvaippa\\" and Norwegian \\"s√∏rgek√•pe\\". This suggests it is a name which came with Scandinavian or German rather than with British settlers, for whom this species would be considerably less familiar. Other common names include: Czech \\"ƒåernok√°b√°tn√≠k\\" . \\"Baboƒçka osikov√°\\". Polish \\"Rusa≈Çka ≈ºa≈Çobnik\\". Russian \\"–¢—Ä–∞—É—Ä–Ω–∏—Ü–∞\\" . Japanese \\"„Ç≠„Éô„É™„Çø„ÉÜ„Éè\\" . Chinese \\"ÈªÑÁ∏ÅÁ´ãÁæΩ\\". L. Hugh Newman likened the butterfly's pattern to a girl who, disliking having to be in mourning, defiantly let a few inches of a bright dress show below her mourning dress. =British name \\"Camberwell beauty\\"= The name originated from the discovery of two individuals at Coldharbour Lane in Camberwell in August 1748. Camberwell is in South London, about three miles south of London Bridge‚Äîin reporting this, the author Moses Harris named the species grand surprise or Camberwell beauty (Bretherton & Emmet, 1990). Illustration from The Papilios of Great Britain Distribution The mourning cloak butterflies are distributed broadly around the northern hemisphere. They are commonly found throughout all of North America and northern Eurasia. Three subspecies of mourning cloak butterflies are found throughout North America: northern Nymphalis antiopa hyperborea Seitz, 1913; eastern N. a. lintnerii Fitch, 1857; southwestern N. a. thomsoni Butler, 1887. They can usually be found in hardwood forests, though they have been found in virtually all habitats. They may also be found as far as the northern part of South America, though they are typically not seen as frequently in southern states such as Florida, Louisiana, or Texas. They are occasionally seen in the more temperate places in Asia, and a few have even been seen in Japan. However, the mourning cloaks tend to be found predominantly in cold, mountainous areas. Migrants arrive in Great Britain most years during summer and autumn, but numbers are usually very low. There is no evidence that the species breeds in Britain; it is thought that mild, wet winters prevent them from surviving there for very long. The 'Butterfly Farmer' L. Hugh Newman raised thousands for release at his 'farm' in Bexley, but none were seen the following spring. Specimens stored in his refrigerator for the winter, however, survived. In a book he said that Camberwell Beauty catches in England were suspiciously concentrated around London, Hull and Harwich, all these being ports in the timber trade with Scandinavia, and theorized that they had hibernated in stacks of timber which was then shipped to England, and had not traveled naturally. Morphology  Caterpillar of Nymphalis antiopa =Eggs= Mourning cloak eggs are amber-yellow or pale olive-green when first laid. Upon further development, the coloration of the eggs will change, becoming lilac-pink, and darkening to almost black, as they mature prior to hatching. The eggs are generally 0.7 by 0.9 mm in size. Laid on terminal shoots of the larval food- plant, encircling the stem. Later in season, when the leaves appear, females also lay the eggs on the upper surface. =Larvae= The spiny caterpillars are striking in appearance, with black bodies and a line of eight reddish- orange dots running down the back (aposematic, warning coloration). The prolegs are dark red. The body is covered with short hairs and black spines and white dots.Spiny Elm Caterpillar Plant and Insect Diagnostic Clinic. Iowa State University The fully grown mourning cloak caterpillars attain two inches in length. =Pupae= Mourning cloak pupae are on average 0.8 inches (2.0 cm) in length, though they can reach over 1.1 inches (2.8 cm) in length. They tend to be a tan or brown gray, with two rows of sharp, red-tipped spikes protruding from the ventro-lateral side of the pupae. The chrysalis has a \\"beak\\", tubercles, and two head horns.Hall, Donald W., and Jerry F. Butler. \\"Mourning Cloak - Nymphalis Antiopa (Linnaeus).\\" Featured Creatures. University of Florida, May 2009. Web. 14 Nov. 2013. =Adult= The mourning cloak butterfly is a large, unique butterfly, with special markings that do not match those of any other butterfly, making it easily distinguishable. It can have a wingspan up to four inches. The dorsal side of its wings are a dark maroon, or occasionally brown, with ragged pale-yellow edges. Bright, iridescent blue spots line the black demarcation between the maroon and the yellow. The ventral side of the wings has gray striations, with the same pale- yellow edges. They are a part of the family Nymphalidae, called the brush- footed butterflies due to their hairy front legs. The species does not display any obvious sexual dimorphism. Nymphalis antiopa MHNT CUT 2013 3 13 Tombeb≈ìuf Male Dorsal.jpgMale, dorsal side Nymphalis antiopa MHNT CUT 2013 3 13 Tombeb≈ìuf Male Ventral.jpgMale, ventral side Reproduction and development =Mating system= Mourning cloak butterflies display polygynous mating behavior, where an individual male will mate with multiple females throughout one breeding season. He will either use a display site to attract females or fly around searching for females that are more widely dispersed in a process called scramble competition polygyny.Davies, N., Krebs, J., & West, S. (2012). An introduction to behavioral ecology. (4th ed.). West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell. This means that male mourning cloak butterflies primarily lek, or display territorial behavior, in which they settle and defend desirable areas, such as those that either offer increased probability of females or those that provide ample amounts of good resources. The more desirable territories will be able to increase the males' chances of reproductive success. Thus, lekking maximizes the males' ability to attract the most female butterflies, either by being in a prime location to view them or to have a location that females would want to visit. Locations of choice typically include sunny perches near ravines, wood margins, parks, gardens, lakes, ponds, around stream edges, or canyons in which males can perch and defend for multiple days. These locations can be more than an area of 300 square meters. Given the male-male competition for mating, this strategy offers males an ideal location in order to maximize success in territorial protection, and thus mating. Despite the fact that butterflies, particularly the mourning cloak butterflies, have an affinity for perches on high objects, they are not known to display any hilltopping behavior, where male butterflies fly up to perch on hill summits. Spring marks the beginning of their mating season, when female mourning cloaks will find a host plant and begin to lay their eggs. Adult mourning cloak butterflies can first be seen in late spring through early summer. They then aestivate for the summer, where they will enter into a \\"dormant\\" state similar to that of hibernation. In concordance with this is the mourning cloak butterflies' exhibition of diapause, which is a suspension in development in response to certain conditions, such as environmental stimuli. They will break diapause once some, though not all, of the butterflies start to migrate through September and October. They then overwinter, and then restart their mating cycle throughout the spring, from April through June. =Life cycle= Mourning cloaks, like all other butterflies, undergo complete metamorphosis. Egg ‚ÜíLarva (L1 ... L5) ‚Üí Pupa ‚Üí Adult. Before the leaves bud-out, Mourning cloaks are known to lay their eggs as ring clusters around the terminal twigs on host plants. The host plant selection is vital because it provides the food source for the young caterpillars. Females are known to have multiple broods, typically up to two to three. The newly hatched caterpillars will group together until they shed their skin‚Äîtermed an instar for each shedding. This shedding event occurs four times throughout development in a process called ecdysis. The larvae experience a fifth skin shed to produce a fully grown caterpillar. The next stage in the mourning cloak's life cycle is to morph into a pupa and then cocoon in a process that encases the creature in a tan or gray chrysalis, which will hang from the stems of grass. This pupa stage allows for resting and further maturation. This metamorphosis takes approximately fifteen days. Following development as the chrysalis is the emergence of an adult mourning cloak butterfly. Studies show that the mourning cloaks use endocrine mechanisms similar to other lepidopterans to regulate female specific protein synthesis, oogenesis, and male and female reproductive gland development. Juvenile hormone (JH) is involved in the regulation of oogenesis and development of the male and female reproductive glands in the mourning cloak butterfly.Herman, William S., and Diane C. Bennett. \\"Regulation of Oogenesis, Female Specific Protein Production, and Male and Female Reproductive Gland Development by Juvenile Hormone in the Butterfly, Nymphalis Antiopa.\\" Journal of Comparative Physiology B 99.4 (1975): 331-38. Print. Behavior =Migration= Experiments carried out in Germany by Hubert Roer in 1962-68, documented a long-distance (one way) migration from Bonn to Greece (Chalkiditi). The adult butterflies hibernate during the winter month. Typical locations of overwintering include tree cavities and on the ground underneath loose tree bark (covered by snow). They are often one of the first butterflies seen in the spring. Ecology cherry blossoms =Larval food-plants= Upon hatching, the caterpillars will begin to eat the leaves of the larval food-plant. A larger number of food-plant plants were recorded, such as willow (Salix nigra, Salix pentandra, Salix caprea, Salix aurita, Salix cinerea, Salix phylicifolia), American elm, hackberry, hawthorn, wild rose, Betula species (Betula verrucosa, Betula chinensis), Alnus incana and poplar.Nymphalis antiopa at Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms The caterpillars live gregariously in communal silken nest on the host- plant, until they disperse prior to pupation. Adult mourning cloaks primarily feed on sap, ripe and fallen fruits and sugary exudate from aphids, very rarely seen nectaring on flowers. =Predation= The mourning cloak butterfly faces many predators throughout its development. The mourning cloak's eggs can be eaten by predators such as beetles, true bugs, ants, beetle larvae, wasps, assassin bugs, and mites. Some of the butterflies' major predators include praying mantises, assassin bugs, dragon flies, and vertebrate predators such as birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. =Defense mechanisms= An anti- predation mechanism the mourning cloaks have employed as adult butterflies is camouflage. To do this, the butterflies fold their wings back when attached to trees as their folded wings will provide camouflage against the dark backdrop of the trees. An additional anti-predation tactic used by the mourning cloaks is to join together with other butterflies in a perch and fly menacingly towards their attackers‚Äîmost often birds or other butterflies. Further defense mechanisms include loud clicks when the mourning cloak flies away from a predator. To protect themselves from the cold weather of their habitats, mourning cloaks will find areas under direct sunlight. This behavior, in conjunction with their darkly-colored wings, allow for maximum heat absorption. Newly hatched mourning cloak caterpillars can display selfish behavior, such as siblicide, by eating non-hatched eggs. The larvae also group together for the duration of their development, preventing some predation by numbers. The larvae and pupae can also respond to disturbances by twitching simultaneously - this may be performed as a defense mechanism. =Pollination= Mourning cloak butterflies are not known to be significant pollinators, since their primary food source is sap of deciduous trees rather than flowering plants. However, they still can occasionally act as pollinators. Relationship to people =Pests= On occasions, the gregarious mourning cloak larvae will completely defoliate ornamental trees, in nurseries, plantations, and parks. Some areas that this damage has been documented has been Oregon and Canada. The young willows and poplars could be completely defoliated due to the caterpillars, though mature trees tend not to be affected. =Research= Mourning cloak butterflies have been a part of some epigenetics experiments testing to determine if the environment affects certain butterfly phenotypic characteristics. Scientists hypothesized that traumatic heat or cold shocks \\"during a critical period of its development can cause profound changes\\". The first experiments occurred in the 1890s. The mourning cloaks were temperature shocked at specific times in their development, which led to differences in pupae color. It was later learned that the color change was due to hormonal changes in response to varying temperatures. =Conservation= Mourning cloak butterflies are protected by law in Switzerland and Austria,Feltwell, J. 1986. The Natural History of Butterflies. New York: Facts on File. though they generally have an increasing trend regarding population density in Finland. They also assume \\"safe\\" status in the Czech Republic. In general, the mourning cloak butterflies find areas that have experienced fire breaks to be more inviting, presumably because the fire breaks increase the amount of open space and clearings available to the butterflies, which is a more ideal habitat for these butterflies to live in. Subspecies Subspecies include: * N. a. antiopa (Linnaeus, 1758) ** The nominotypical subspecies. Type-locality: \\"Sweden\\" * N. a. hyperborea (Seitz, 1913) (Canada, Alaska) ** This subspecies lays more amber-yellow eggs, instead of the olive-green. As the eggs develop, the coloration will change to lilac pinkish-purple. These larvae's spines are shorter and stouter than those of European mourning cloak larvae. and the spots bordering the wing edges may be more of a violet color. * N. a. lintnerii (Fitch, 1857) (slightly larger than preceding; se Canada, eastern US) * N. a. asopos (Fruhstorfer, 1909) (Japan) Popular culture * The Camberwell beauty figures in the short story A Plague of Butterflies by Fred M.

Founded in 1999 by brothers Evan and Gregg Spiridellis, it first achieved widespread attention during the 2004 US presidential election when their video of George Bush and John Kerry singing This Land Is Your Land became a viral hit. Initially known for political and social satire, JibJab produced commercials and shorts for clients such as Sony, Noggin, and Disney before focusing on its now-flagship personalized eCard and messaging services. In 2016, its animated sticker- making program - which has been available since 2004 - became the top iMessage App Store app by download growth. In 2012, JibJab also expanded into the children's educational market with its multi-platform learning program, StoryBots, which has since spawned two Netflix TV series, Ask the StoryBots and StoryBots Super Songs. In 2019, JibJab was acquired by the private equity firm Catapult Capital. Political satire =\\"Capitol Ill\\"= For the 2000 Presidential Election' JibJab released a Flash movie entitled \\"Capitol Ill\\" in July 2000, which featured an animated rap battle between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Appearances by Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush are also made. =\\"Ahnuld For Governor\\"= In 2003, JibJab produced a Flash movie focusing on Arnold Schwarzenegger's campaign for Governor of California. =\\"This Land\\"= For the 2004 United States presidential election, JibJab created a Flash movie entitled \\"This Land,\\" which featured animated versions of George W. Bush and John Kerry - voiced by comedian Jim Meskimen - singing a parody of Woody Guthrie's song This Land Is Your Land. The video was considered an instant success, eventually being viewed on every continent (including Antarctica) as well as the International Space Station, while site was listed number one on Alexa's \\"Movers and Shakers\\" list. The traffic surge forced JibJab's server to be shut down after one day, and the clip was placed on AtomFilms, where it got more than 1 million hits in 24 hours. After being linked to on thousands of websites, the video was featured several times in the printed media and on television, including NBC Nightly News, Fox News and ABC World News Tonight. On July 26, 2004, the creators appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. In December 2004, the Spiridellis brothers were named People of the Year by Peter Jennings. The Richmond Organization, a music publisher that owns the copyright to Guthrie's tune through its Ludlow Music Unit, threatened legal action.Wired News (August 8, 2004) CNN Money (July 26, 2004) JibJab responded with a lawsuit in a California federal court, claiming the song was protected under a fair use exemption for parodies. JibJab and Ludlow Music reached a settlement after JibJab's attorneys unearthed evidence that the song had passed into the public domain in 1973. The terms of the settlement allowed for the continued distribution of This Land. =\\"Good to be in DC\\"= In October 2004, JibJab followed up with another original animation, \\"Good to be in DC,\\" set to the tune of \\"Dixie\\". In this video, animated versions of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, John Kerry, and John Edwards sing about their hopes for the upcoming election. =\\"Second Term\\"= Immediately after George W. Bush's election victory, JibJab released a third video, \\"Second Term.\\" Set to the tune of \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\\", an animated Bush gloats over his successful bid for a second term as president, although John Kerry would, maybe, have a turn to become president, someday. =\\"Time for Some Campaignin'\\"= For the 2008 Presidential Election, JibJab released another election-themed animation, \\"Time for Some Campaignin'\\" in July of that year. Set to the tune of Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are a-Changin\\", animated versions of Bill and Hillary Clinton, John McCain, Barack Obama, George Bush, and Dick Cheney sing of their presidential hopes. Viewers had the option of inserting their own face as that of a harassed voter. =\\"He's Barack Obama\\"= Upon Barack Obama becoming President, JibJab released 'He's Barack Obama', where they portrayed Obama as a superhero. The music becomes a heavy metal interpretation of \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\", as he promises he would fix the Middle East, defeat the Taliban, fix the schools, fight a giant space robot, wrestle a bear, fix the deficit and more. =2012 Election= For the 2012 Presidential Election, JibJab did not make an election video and instead began to focus their efforts on their e-card business. However, an election web app was released in October of that year. Year in Review Starting in 2005, and for the next nine consecutive years until 2015, JibJab annually released \\"Year in Review\\" videos, usually late in December between Christmas and New Year's Day. The videos were uploaded on YouTube. On December 11, 2015, JibJab made a Facebook announcement that they will no longer be releasing \\"Year in Review\\" videos. =\\"2-0-5\\" - 2005 Year In Review= 2-0-5 is the year in review video for the year 2005, it reflects the songs \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" and \\"Turkey In The Straw\\". 2-0-5 is sung in the perspective of George W.

Sung to the tune of \\"Oh, Susannah\\", it tells the story of an American factory worker who buys quantities of cheap, imported \\"crap\\" from his local Big Box Mart, a parody of big-box stores, running up large amounts of credit card debt. However, everyone else is also buying cheap, imported crap from Big Box Mart, so the American factory goes out of business, leaving the protagonist out of work and mired in debt at the age of 53.

Participants included the comedy duo Famous Last Nerds (Jordan Allen-Dutton and Erik Weiner) and John Landis as director. It both summarizes and parodies The Shawshank Redemption, condensing the plot to a length of nearly four minutes and underlining it with rap music. =Music Videos= JibJab produced a music video for the 2006 song \\"Do I Creep You Out?\\" by Weird Al Yankovic, a parody of Taylor Hicks' \\"Do I Make You Proud?\\". The video depicts the main character stalking a barista in increasingly disturbing ways (as described in the song), ending with his being beaten and arrested by the police. The final scene reveals that the lead has been singing the song in a prison talent show. In 2009 JibJab produced another music video for Yankovic for the song \\"CNR\\", which is a style parody of The White Stripes. The video and song portrays Charles Nelson Reilly as a superhuman doing seemingly impossible or improbable things. It also features Yankovic and Jon \\"Bermuda\\" Schwartz as Jack White and Meg White respectively. E-cards & Messaging Starting in October 2007, JibJab began its focus on personalized eCards and videos, letting users insert photographs of their faces into humorous birthday cards, holiday greetings and congratulatory notes and send them to other people as e-cards or \\"sendables\\". Initially, this included branded personalized videos, including working with OfficeMax on the video site Elf Yourself, where an uploaded photo is put onto a singing and dancing elf, as well as partnerships with Star Wars (for the 30th anniversary of The Empire Strikes Back) and Mad Men. Since then, in addition to greeting eCards, JibJab has also extended its personalization technology to popular music videos, including: * ...Baby One More Time (Britney Spears) * Friday (Rebecca Black) * Gangnam Style (Psy) * Sexy and I Know It (LMFAO) * Shut Up and Dance (Walk the Moon) * Addicted to Love (Robert Palmer) * Roar (Katy Perry) * Take On Me (A-ha) * All About That Bass (Meghan Trainor) * Cake by the Ocean (DNCE) * Happy (Pharrell Williams) * Sorry (Justin Bieber) * Cheap Thrills (Sia Furler) Since launching its eCard service, more than 100 million people have visited JibJab's website annually. In 2014, the company launched a messaging app for personalized animated GIFs, available on both IOS and Android platforms. In 2016, the JibJab app was one of the first mobile apps to be enable for IMessage and was ranked first among them in download growth. The JibJab app was also featured prominently in Apple's annual WWDC product presentation. StoryBots In 2012, JibJab expanded into the children's educational market with its multi-platform learning program, StoryBots. The brand currently includes web-based educational content, as well as two Netflix television series, Ask the StoryBots and StoryBots Super Songs.

In his early years, Fraser was curator of the Museum of the Zoological Society of London. Little is known about Fraser's early life. He was born in 1819 or 1820 and married Mary Ann Harrison on 17 February 1844. A son Oscar L. Fraser worked as an assistant in the Indian Museum at Calcutta around 1888. He worked for fourteen years at the museum of the Zoological Society of London. He worked with the anatomist Richard Owen on studies of the emu and rhea. He participated in the Niger expedition of 1841 as the African Civilization Society's scientist, with Allen and Thomson. He stayed on in Fernando Po and collected. Upon his return he became in charge of Lord Derby's collection at Knowsley Hall. In 1846 he was sent by Lord Derby to collect in north Africa. In 1848 he became conservator at Knowsley. He wrote Zoologica Typica, or figures of the new and rare animals and birds in the collection of the Zoological Society of London, a lavishly illustrated large-sized book, published in 1849. In this book he described many new species of birds. In 1850, Fraser was appointed Consul of Quidah, Dahomey (now Benin), West Africa. Around 1857‚Äì1859, he collected birds and mammals in Ecuador for Philip Lutley Sclater of the Zoological Society of London, and the year after in California. Upon his return to London, he opened a shop in Regent Street, London, selling exotic birds. The last years of his life he spent in America. Fraser wrote a Catalogue of the Knowsley Collections (1850) and described several new species including the Derbyan parakeet Psittacula derbiana named after his employer. A number of species and subspecies have been named in his honour, including Fraser's anole (Anolis fraseri ), Fraser's ground snake (Liophis epinephelus fraseri ), a centipede snake (Tantilla fraseri ),Beolens, Bo; Michael Watkins; Michael Grayson (2011).

The company was established by Eddie Rickenbacker, who used his World War I 94th Fighter Squadron emblem depicting a top hat inside a ring. The emblems were located both on the front and the back of the cars. The company made sporting coup√©s, touring cars, sedans, and roadsters. Four wheel inside brakes were introduced in 1923. Rickenbacker made an unsuccessful attempt to merge with Peerless around 1924. Early six-cylinder engines were joined in 1925 by an eight-cylinder engine. The model was named Vertical Eight Super Fine which referred to the advanced proprietary engine and the high quality of the cars. Although 1927 saw new models, designated the 6-70, 8-80, and 8-90, Rickenbacker cars were too expensive for the time and sales were poor. Before the company closed down in 1927, more than 35,000 cars had been built. The manufacturing equipment were sold to Audi and transported to Germany, somewhat ironic since Rickenbacker renounced his supposed German heritage (he was actually of Swiss ancestry) in light of World War I. This transaction was reflected in Audi Zwickau and Dresden models, using six- or eight-cylinder Rickenbacker engines. Some Rickenbacker cars still survive.

Description  The silver-washed fritillary butterfly is deep orange with black spots on the upperside of its wings, and has a wingspan of 54‚Äì70 mm, with the male being smaller and paler than the female. The underside is green, and, unlike other fritillaries, has silver streaks instead of silver spots, hence the name silver-washed. The caterpillar is black brown with two yellow lines along its back and long reddish-brown spines. The male possesses scent scales on the upperside of the forewing that run along veins one to four. The scent produced from these scales attracts females and helps to distinguish it from other species.

The silver-washed is a strong flier, and more mobile than other fritillaries, and, as such, can be seen gliding above the tree canopy at high speed. Its preferred habitat is thin, sunny, deciduous woodland, especially oaks, but it has been known to live in coniferous woodland. The main larval food plant of the species is the common dog violet (Viola riviniana). Life cycle Unusually for a butterfly, the female does not lay her eggs on the leaves or stem of the caterpillar's food source (in this case violets), but instead one or two meters above the woodland floor in the crevices of tree bark close to clumps of violets. When the egg hatches in August, the caterpillar immediately goes into hibernation until spring. Upon awakening, it will drop to the ground, and feeds on violets close to the base of the tree. The caterpillar usually feeds at night, and usually conceals itself during the day away from its food source, but during cool weather will bask in the sunny spots on the forest floor on dry, dead leaves. It will pupate amongst the ground vegetation, and the adults will emerge in June.

He was a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC, and was present at his death. He held the supreme good to be one, eternal and unchangeable, and denied the existence of anything contrary to the good. Editors and translators in the Middle Ages often confused him with Euclid of Alexandria when discussing the latter's Elements. Life Euclid was born in Megara,; Cicero, Academica, ii. 42; ; Plato, Phaedo, 59B-C; Strabo, ix. 1. 8; but in Athens he became a follower of Socrates. So eager was he to hear the teaching and discourse of Socrates, that when, for a time, Athens had a ban on any citizen of Megara entering the city, Euclid would sneak into Athens after nightfall, disguised as a woman to hear him speak.Aulus Gellius, vii. 10. 1-4 He is represented in the preface of Plato's Theaetetus as being responsible for writing down the conversation between Socrates and the young Theaetetus many years earlier. Socrates is also supposed to have reproved Euclid for his fondness for eristic disputes. He was present at Socrates' death (399 BCE),Plato, Phaedo, 59B-C after which Euclid returned to Megara, where he offered refuge to Plato and other frightened pupils of Socrates.; In Megara, Euclid founded a school of philosophy which became known as the Megarian school, and which flourished for about a century. Euclid's pupils were said to have been Ichthyas, the second leader of the Megarian school; Eubulides of Miletus; Clinomachus;Suda, Sokrates; cf. and Thrasymachus of Corinth. Thrasymachus was a teacher of Stilpo, who was the teacher of Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic school. Philosophy Euclid of Megara Dressing as a Woman to Hear Socrates Teach in Athens, by Domenico Marol√¨, c. 1650 Euclid himself wrote six dialogues ‚Äî the Lamprias, the Aeschines, the Phoenix, the Crito, the Alcibiades, and the Amatory dialogue ‚Äî but none survive. The main extant source on his views is the brief summary by Diogenes La√´rtius. Euclid's philosophy was a synthesis of Eleatic and Socratic ideas. Socrates claimed that the greatest knowledge was understanding the good. The Eleatics claimed the greatest knowledge is the one universal Being of the world. Mixing these two ideas, Euclid claimed that good is the knowledge of this being. Therefore, this good is the only thing that exists and has many names but is really just one thing. He identified the Eleatic idea of \\"The One\\" with the Socratic \\"Form of the Good,\\" which he called \\"Reason,\\" \\"God,\\" \\"Mind,\\" \\"Wisdom,\\" etc.; Cicero, Academica, ii. 42 This was the true essence of being, and was eternal and unchangeable.Cicero, Academica, ii. 42 The idea of a universal good also allowed Euclid to dismiss all that is not good because he claimed that good covered all things on Earth with its many names. Euclid adopted the Socratic idea that knowledge is virtue and that the only way to understand the never- changing world is through the study of philosophy. Euclid taught that virtues themselves, however, were simply the knowledge of the one good, or Being. As he said, \\"The Good is One, but we can call it by several names, sometimes as wisdom, sometimes as God, sometimes as Reason\\", and he declared, \\"the opposite of Good does not exist\\". Euclid was also interested in concepts and dilemmas of logic. Euclid and his Megarian followers used dialogue and the eristic method to defend their ideas. The eristic method allowed them to prove their ideas by disproving those of the one they were arguing with and therefore indirectly proving one's own point (see reductio ad absurdum). When attacking a demonstration, it was not the premises assumed but the conclusions that he attacked, which presumably means that he tried to refute his opponents by drawing absurd consequences from their conclusions. He also rejected argument from analogy. His doctrinal heirs, the Stoic logicians, inaugurated the most important school of logic in antiquity other than Aristotle's peripatetics.

Fyrisvellir, Fyris Wolds or Fyrisvallarna was the marshy plain (vellir) south of Gamla Uppsala where travellers had to leave the ships on the river Fyris (Fyris√•n) and walk to the Temple at Uppsala and the hall of the Swedish king. The name is related to, or derived from, Old Norse Fyrva which meant \\"to ebb\\" and it referred to the partially inundated soggy plains that today are dry farmland and the modern town of Uppsala. In mediaeval times, a royal estate called F√∏ris√¶ng, \\"Fyris meadow\\", was located near this field. The small lakes √ñvre F√∂ret, \\"the Upper Fyri\\", and Nedre F√∂ret, \\"the Lower Fyri\\", are remains of this marsh and retain a modern form of Fyri (the -t suffix is the definite article, which lake names always take in Swedish). The field went alongside what was renamed the Fyris river (Fyris√•n) in the 17th century to make the connection between the river and the Sagas more obvious. In Scandinavian mythology, the battle between Haki and Hugleik took place on these wolds, as well as that between Haki and Jorund. It was also the location of the Battle of the F√Ωrisvellir between Eric the Victorious and his nephew Styrbj√∂rn the Strong, in the 980s. According to a story about Hr√≥lf Kraki found in many texts, Hr√≥lf spread gold on this plain as he and his men were fleeing the Swedish king Adils.

It comes within the jurisdiction of the Olpad Taluka. Etymology According to local folklore, the name Barbodhan comes from the Arabic BƒÅb Aden or \\"Gateway to Aden\\".BƒÅb 'Adn in Arabic can also mean 'The Gate to Paradise'. It is known that at one time Muslims travelling to Mecca on pilgrimage would pass through this village on their way to the seaport of Surat, hence the name. Some sources suggest that the village was named after the Portuguese factor and traveller Duarte Barbosa, though this seems unlikely as he never actually resided in the area. More recently though the village Barbodhan has become known as the 'Golden Village'. The village has existed for many years, and tombstones in the graveyard indicate that Muslims were buried there some three to four hundred years ago. According to one source the first Indian Muslims to settle here were several brothers with the surname Rawat, who came from Nasirpoor Bhatti, a place near Navsari. The Diaspora of Barbodhanis Barbodhanis have always interested in trade and commerce and travelled to foreign lands, undertaking long sea voyages. People left Barbodhan in the early 19th century to settle in Burma, where they established many businesses and were great entrepreneurs; a number of them even became advisors to the Burmese rulers. Then from in the 1840s many other emigrants from Barbodhan went to the island of Mauritius, where they were later responsible for introducing hydroelectric power, as well as being involved in other trading and business concerns. The first Muslim mayor in Mauritius was originally from Barbodhan. Then came the migration to England from the 1950s to the 1970s. Once immigration to the United Kingdom became more difficult, a number of Barbodhians then left for Canada particularly during the period from the 1970s to the 1990s. A considerable number of Barbodhians undertook further migrations from one of these countries to another; such as from Burma to England, England to Canada or Mauritius to England.Kala, Ibrahim Dawood. A History of Barbodhan Muslims living in the UK, 2004, Barbodhan Press, Cambridge, MA, pg.8 Despite the fact that Barbodhan is only a small village, its people have made valuable contributions in societies around the world. Barbodhians have set up many Waqfs or Religious Foundations to help poor, needy, disadvantaged and unfortunate members of society, particularly in Burma and Mauritius. The largest population of Barbodhians outside India is in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where the community settled in the 1950s and 1960s. The first ever Elected Member on Bolton Council of Indian origin was from Barbodhan. There is also a large number of settlers from Barbodhan in Preston, also in Lancashire, where the Barbodhan Muslim Welfare Society (UK) was set as early as 1960. There are currently two mosques, two temples, one madressa, one school and one library in the village. There is a large pond in the village of Barbodhan which is the biggest pond in the Olpad Taluka. It covers an area of around 999 vigha (250 acres/101.17 hectares). Demographics All the Muslim population residing in the village are classed as Surti Sunni Vohra Muslims, or Surti Muslims following the Deobandi Tablighi Jamaat Movement.

It was conceived as a protest event against the 1936 Summer Olympics being held in Berlin, which was then under control of the Nazi Party. Despite gaining the support from some athletes, and most significantly Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union and the Communist International organization, the People's Olympiad was never held, as a result of the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Fifty-six years later, Barcelona hosted the 1992 Summer Olympics. Background Estadi Ol√≠mpic de Montju√Øc in Barcelona was intended to be the main stadium for the People's Olympiad. In 1931, the International Olympic Committee had selected Berlin, then the capital of the Weimar Republic, to host the 1936 Summer Olympics at the 29th IOC Session in Barcelona. Berlin had defeated Barcelona, which was also vying to host the games, by 43 votes to 16. During the same year, Spain had adopted a republican constitution, with King Alfonso XIII going into exile, and Catalonia was declared an autonomous region inside the new Spanish Republic. Following the 1936 general election in Spain, the newly elected Popular Front government (which included the Communist Party of Spain) decided that Spain would boycott the Berlin Olympics in Germany, which was now under Adolf Hitler's NSDAP government, and host its own games. Invitations were made to many different countries, and it was planned to use the hotels built for the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition as an Olympic-style Village. The games were scheduled to be held from July 19 to 26 and would have therefore ended six days prior to the start of the Berlin games. In addition to the usual sporting events, the Barcelona games would also have featured chess, folkdancing, music and theatre. A total of 6,000 athletes from 22 nations registered for the games. The largest contingents of athletes came from the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and French Algeria. There were also teams from Germany and Italy made up of political exiles from those countries. Teams representing Jewish exiles, Alsace, Galicia, Catalonia and the Basque Country also registered. The Soviet Union, under the rule of Joseph Stalin, had been holding its own version of the Olympics, known as the Spartakiad, organised by Red Sport International. Despite this, the Soviets agreed to attend the Barcelona competition. Many of the athletes were sent by trade unions, workers' clubs and associations, socialist and communist parties, and left-wing groups, rather than by state-sponsored committees. With the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War just as the games were to begin, the alternate games were hastily cancelled. Some athletes never made it to Barcelona as the borders had been closed, while many who were in the city for the beginning of the games made a hasty exit. However, at least 200 of the athletes, such as Clara Thalmann, remained in Spain and joined workers' militias that were organized to defend the Second Spanish Republic against the nationalists.Antony Beevor.

Claus' literary contributions spanned the genres of drama, the novel, and poetry; he also left a legacy as a painter and film director. He wrote primarily in Dutch, although he also wrote some poetry in English. His death by euthanasia, which is legal in Belgium, led to considerable controversy. Life Hugo Claus was born on 5 April 1929 at Sint-Janshospitaal in Bruges, Belgium.\\"Een virtuoze alleskunner\\" (19 March 2008). De Verdieping. Retrieved 18 June 2010. He was the eldest of four sons born to Jozef Claus and Germaine Vanderlinden. Jozef worked as a printer but was also fond of theatre. Hugo was educated at a boarding school led by nuns in Aalbeke and experienced the German occupation of Belgium during World War II. The experience was formative, and would later be adapted by Claus into his semi-autobiographical The Sorrow of Belgium (1983). Many of Claus' teachers were Flemish nationalists who were sympathetic to fascism, and Claus joined the pro-German youth wing of the Flemish National Union. His father was also briefly detained after the Liberation for collaborationism.Coetzee, J. M. (24 Feb 2007). \\"Stepping Stones\\". The Guardian. Retrieved 17 June 2010. A sympathizer of the political left at a more mature period in his life, Claus lauded the socialist model after a visit to Cuba in the 1960s. Claus' prominence in literary circles and his debut as a novelist came in 1950, with the publication of his De Metsiers at age twenty-one. His first published poems had in fact been printed by his father as early as 1947.Bloom, Ono (20 March 2008). \\"De Vlaamse leeuw is dood: In memoriam Hugo Claus 1929 ‚Äì 2008\\". De Verdieping. Retrieved 18 June 2010. He lived in Paris from 1950 until 1952, where he met many of the members of the CoBrA art movement. From February 1953 until the beginning of 1955, Hugo Claus lived in Italy where his girlfriend (born in 1928) acted in a few films. They were married on 26 May 1955, and had a son, Thomas, on 7 October 1963. In the early 1970s, he had an affair with actress Sylvia Kristel, who was 23 years younger, with whom he had a son, Arthur, in 1975. They lived in the Raamgracht 5-7 building in Amsterdam. The relationship ended in 1977, when she left him for actor Ian McShane. He was a \\"contrarian\\", of \\"anarchist spirit\\". Journalist Guy Duplat recalls that Claus had organized in Knokke the election of a \\"Miss Knokke Festival\\", which was a typical beauty contest, except for the Claus ruling that the members of the all-male jury would have to be naked. =Literary career= Hugo Claus was considered to be one of the most important contemporary Belgian authors.Radio-Television Belge RTBF (French) Claus published the novel Schola Nostra (1971) under the pseudonym Dorothea Van Male. He also used the pseudonyms Jan Hyoens and Thea Streiner. The 1962 De verwondering (The Astonishment) and the 1983 Het verdriet van Belgi√´ (The Sorrow of Belgium) rank among Claus' most significant works as a novelist.Brems, Hugo (2007). \\"Claus, Hugo (1929‚Äì)\\".

Dutch Crossing: A Journal of Low Countries Studies, 26(2), 212‚Äì232. Most prolific in literary endeavors as a dramatist, Claus wrote 35 original pieces and 31 translations from English, Greek, Latin, French and Spanish plays and novels. His dramatic sketch Masscheroen was first staged at Knokke Casino and featured an all-nude cast: three naked men were given the task of portraying the Christian Holy Trinity of God the father, God the son, and the Holy Spirit; the work also made light of the Holy Virgin, a Belgian saint, and the Three Wise Men.Willinger, David (2007). \\"Introduction\\". In Hugo Claus, The Sacrament and Other Plays of Forbidden Love (pp. 11‚Äì80). Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania: Susquehanna University Press. Attacked as blasphemous and deleterious to the public's moral well-being, the light- hearted play's performance triggered a notable legal case in which Claus was prosecuted: convicted on charges of public indecency, Claus was ordered to pay a ten-thousand-Belgian franc fine and serve a four-month prison sentence. The prison term was reduced to a suspended sentence after a public outcry. Claus also wrote the script of a satirical comic strip, \\"De Avonturen van Belgman\\" (\\"The Adventures of Belgian Man\\") in 1967, which spoofed the Belgian bi- lingual troubles. The strip itself was drawn by artist Hugok√© (Hugo de Kempeneer). Hugo Claus' name had been put forward many times for the Nobel Prize in literature, on which he would casually comment \\"this prize money would suit me fine\\".Revue de la presse belge (French) =Painting and film= As a painter, Claus was a participant in the CoBrA art movement from 1950. He had developed friendships with some of its members, and illustrated a book by Pierre Alechinsky in 1949. He collaborated with key figures in the movement including Karel Appel and Corneille and participated in some exhibitions. He later used his experiences of this time in his book Een zachte vernieling (Mild Destruction). Claus directed seven films between 1964 and 2001. His film Het sacrament was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. =Death= Claus suffered from Alzheimer's disease and requested his life to be terminated through euthanasia, a legal procedure in Belgium, at the Middelheim Hospital in Antwerp on 19 March 2008. Bert Anciaux, then Flemish Minister of Culture, stated \\"I knew him well enough to know that he wanted to depart with pride and dignity.\\"LCI (French) Former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said that he imagined the onset of Alzheimer's must have been \\"inevitable and unbearable torture\\". \\"I can live with the fact that he decided thus,\\" he said, \\"because he left us as a great glowing star, right on time, just before he would have collapsed into a Stellar black hole.\\" His death by euthanasia has received criticism from the Roman Catholic Church and the Belgian Alzheimer League. The Roman Catholic Church criticized the media coverage; Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels referred to Claus' euthanasia in his Easter Homily. The Belgian Alzheimer League respects Claus' decision, but believes the media coverage of his death neglects other options for Alzheimer's patients.

F-Script is an interactive language based on Smalltalk, using macOS's native Cocoa API. Overview F-Script is based on a pure object paradigm: every entity manipulated within the language is an object. Its base syntax and concepts are identical to those of the language Smalltalk (the canonical example of an object-oriented language) with specific extensions to support array programming as in the language APL. F-Script provides an interpreted, interactive environment with support for workspaces, which provide a rich set of functions including object persistence, distributed objects, graphical user interface (GUI) framework, database access, among other things.  Syntax  Like Smalltalk, F-Script's syntax is very simple, without requiring specific notation for control structures which are provided in a unified manner by the \`message send\` operation. Unlike Smalltalk, F-Script provides specific notational extensions to support the \`Array\` class, using curly brackets to describe literal arrays, which may contain any F-Script expressions. For example, \`{1+3, 'name', true}\` is a valid array literal. The empty array is denoted by \`{}\`. Arrays of arrays are supported transparently, since any array is just another object. Message sending Message expressions in F-Script are similar to those in Smalltalk: they specify which object is the receiver of the message, which operation is called by the message, and any argument objects needed by the operation. F-Script supports unary, binary, and keyword messages. F-Script message semantics are extended to support array programming by recognizing that an array operation, such as adding to numerical vectors, must be viewed as generating a number of messages relating the elements of the vectors involved Thus, if \`A = {1, 2, 3}\` and \`B = {10, 20, 30}\`, then F-Script allows \`A + B = {11, 22, 33}\`. Usage F-Script is chiefly used as a lightweight scripting layer on top of macOS's Cocoa application programming interface (API). It can be embedded in applications using the F-Script framework and Interface Builder palettes. It can also be used interactively from the F-Script interpreter to prototype applications. Finally, it can be used to explore applications' object hierarchies using an injector such as F-Script Anywhere. Forks The original F-script development by Philippe Mougin stopped at version 2.1 in 2011. Ilya Kulakov (Kentzo) took over the FScript.org website and updated the program to work with Mac OS X 10.7 through 10.10 until version 2.3 of 2014, building off Jonathan Mitchell's modernization work. Kulakov noted that as F-Script ties deeply into the system, the code must be changed to reflect the framework available in each Mac OS X release. The last update to this chain of work was done in 2018, by Wolfgang Baird, who updated F-Script to work with Mac OS X 10.12.

Chart with data from NASA showing how land and sea surface air temperatures have changed vs a pre-industrial baseline.. This is a daily, global Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data set produced on December 20, 2013 at 1-km resolution (also known as ultra-high resolution) by the JPL ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System) group. Weekly average sea surface temperature for the World Ocean during the first week of February 2011, during a period of La Ni√±a. Sea surface temperature and flows Sea surface temperature (SST) is the water temperature close to the ocean's surface. The exact meaning of surface varies according to the measurement method used, but it is between and below the sea surface. Air masses in the Earth's atmosphere are highly modified by sea surface temperatures within a short distance of the shore. Localized areas of heavy snow can form in bands downwind of warm water bodies within an otherwise cold air mass. Warm sea surface temperatures are known to be a cause of tropical cyclogenesis over the Earth's oceans. Tropical cyclones can also cause a cool wake, due to turbulent mixing of the upper of the ocean. SST changes diurnally, like the air above it, but to a lesser degree. There is less SST variation on breezy days than on calm days. In addition, ocean currents such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), can effect SST's on multi- decadal time scales, a major impact results from the global thermohaline circulation, which affects average SST significantly throughout most of the world's oceans. Ocean temperature is related to ocean heat content, an important topic in the study of global warming. Coastal SSTs can cause offshore winds to generate upwelling, which can significantly cool or warm nearby landmasses, but shallower waters over a continental shelf are often warmer. Onshore winds can cause a considerable warm-up even in areas where upwelling is fairly constant, such as the northwest coast of South America. Its values are important within numerical weather prediction as the SST influences the atmosphere above, such as in the formation of sea breezes and sea fog. It is also used to calibrate measurements from weather satellites. Measurement Temperature profile of the surface layer of the ocean (a) at night and (b) during the day There are a variety of techniques for measuring this parameter that can potentially yield different results because different things are actually being measured. Away from the immediate sea surface, general temperature measurements are accompanied by a reference to the specific depth of measurement. This is because of significant differences encountered between measurements made at different depths, especially during the daytime when low wind speed and high sunshine conditions may lead to the formation of a warm layer at the ocean's surface and strong vertical temperature gradients (a diurnal thermocline). Sea surface temperature measurements are confined to the top portion of the ocean, known as the near- surface layer. =Thermometers= SST was one of the first oceanographic variables to be measured. Benjamin Franklin suspended a mercury thermometer from a ship while travelling between the United States and Europe in his survey of the Gulf Stream in the late eighteenth century. SST was later measured by dipping a thermometer into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface. The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships, which was underway by 1963. These observations have a warm bias of around due to the heat of the engine room. This bias has led to changes in the perception of global warming since 2000. Fixed weather buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of . Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken. In the nineteenth century, measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship. However, there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets. Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket, but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket. The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure. The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night. Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design, and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies. These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution. A large network of coastal buoys in U.S. waters is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center (NDBC). Between 1985 and 1994, an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean designed to help monitor and predict the El Ni√±o phenomenon. =Weather satellites= MODIS Aqua data Weather satellites have been available to determine sea surface temperature information since 1967, with the first global composites created during 1970. Since 1982, satellites have been increasingly utilized to measure SST and have allowed its spatial and temporal variation to be viewed more fully. Satellite measurements of SST are in reasonable agreement with in situ temperature measurements. The satellite measurement is made by sensing the ocean radiation in two or more wavelengths within the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum or other parts of the spectrum which can then be empirically related to SST. These wavelengths are chosen because they are: # within the peak of the blackbody radiation expected from the Earth, and # able to transmit adequately well through the atmosphere The satellite-measured SST provides both a synoptic view of the ocean and a high frequency of repeat views, allowing the examination of basin-wide upper ocean dynamics not possible with ships or buoys. NASA's (National Aeronautic and Space Administration) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) SST satellites have been providing global SST data since 2000, available with a one-day lag. NOAA's GOES (Geostationary Orbiting Earth Satellites) satellites are geo-stationary above the Western Hemisphere which enables to them to deliver SST data on an hourly basis with only a few hours of lag time. There are several difficulties with satellite-based absolute SST measurements. First, in infrared remote sensing methodology the radiation emanates from the top \\"skin\\" of the ocean, approximately the top 0.01 mm or less, which may not represent the bulk temperature of the upper meter of ocean due primarily to effects of solar surface heating during the daytime, reflected radiation, as well as sensible heat loss and surface evaporation. All these factors make it somewhat difficult to compare satellite data to measurements from buoys or shipboard methods, complicating ground truth efforts. Secondly, the satellite cannot look through clouds, creating a cool bias in satellite-derived SSTs within cloudy areas. However, passive microwave techniques can accurately measure SST and penetrate cloud cover. Within atmospheric sounder channels on weather satellites, which peak just above the ocean's surface, knowledge of the sea surface temperature is important to their calibration. Local variation The SST has a diurnal range, just like the Earth's atmosphere above, though to a lesser degree due to its greater specific heat. On calm days, the temperature can vary by . The temperature of the ocean at depth lags the Earth's atmosphere temperature by 15 days per , which means for locations like the Aral Sea, temperatures near its bottom reach a maximum in December and a minimum in May and June. Near the coastline, offshore winds move the warm waters near the surface offshore, and replace them with cooler water from below in the process known as Ekman transport. This pattern increases nutrients for marine life in the region. Offshore river deltas, freshwater flows over the top of the denser seawater, which allows it to heat faster due to limited vertical mixing. Remotely sensed SST can be used to detect the surface temperature signature due to tropical cyclones. In general, an SST cooling is observed after the passing of a hurricane primarily as the result of mixed layer deepening and surface heat losses. In the wake of several day long Saharan dust outbreaks across the adjacent northern Atlantic Ocean, sea surface temperatures are reduced 0.2 C to 0.4 C (0.3 to 0.7 F). Other sources of short-term SST fluctuation include extratropical cyclones, rapid influxes of glacial fresh water and concentrated phytoplankton blooms due to seasonal cycles or agricultural run-off. =Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation= The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) is important for how external forcings are linked with North Atlantic SSTs. Regional variation The 1997 El Ni√±o observed by TOPEX/Poseidon. The white areas off the tropical coasts of South and North America indicate the pool of warm water. El Ni√±o is defined by prolonged differences in Pacific Ocean surface temperatures when compared with the average value. The accepted definition is a warming or cooling of at least 0.5 ¬∞C (0.9 ¬∞F) averaged over the east- central tropical Pacific Ocean. Typically, this anomaly happens at irregular intervals of 2‚Äì7 years and lasts nine months to two years. The average period length is 5 years. When this warming or cooling occurs for only seven to nine months, it is classified as El Ni√±o/La Ni√±a \\"conditions\\"; when it occurs for more than that period, it is classified as El Ni√±o/La Ni√±a \\"episodes\\". The sign of an El Ni√±o in the sea surface temperature pattern is when warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the east Pacific. It takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the western Pacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific. El Ni√±o's warm rush of nutrient- poor tropical water, heated by its eastward passage in the Equatorial Current, replaces the cold, nutrient-rich surface water of the Humboldt Current. When El Ni√±o conditions last for many months, extensive ocean warming and the reduction in Easterly Trade winds limits upwelling of cold nutrient-rich deep water and its economic impact to local fishing for an international market can be serious. Importance to the Earth's atmosphere Sea-effect snow bands near the Korean Peninsula Sea surface temperature affects the behavior of the Earth's atmosphere above, so their initialization into atmospheric models is important. While sea surface temperature is important for tropical cyclogenesis, it is also important in determining the formation of sea fog and sea breezes. Heat from underlying warmer waters can significantly modify an air mass over distances as short as to . For example, southwest of Northern Hemisphere extratropical cyclones, curved cyclonic flow bringing cold air across relatively warm water bodies can lead to narrow lake-effect snow (or sea effect) bands. Those bands bring strong localized precipitation, often in the form of snow, since large water bodies such as lakes efficiently store heat that results in significant temperature differences‚Äîlarger than ‚Äîbetween the water surface and the air above. Because of this temperature difference, warmth and moisture are transported upward, condensing into vertically oriented clouds which produce snow showers. The temperature decrease with height and cloud depth are directly affected by both the water temperature and the large-scale environment. The stronger the temperature decrease with height, the taller the clouds get, and the greater the precipitation rate becomes. =Tropical cyclones= Seasonal peaks of tropical cyclone activity worldwide Average equatorial Pacific temperatures Ocean temperature of at least 26.5¬∞C (79.7¬∞F) spanning through at minimum a 50-metre depth is one of the precursors needed to maintain a tropical cyclone (a type of mesocyclone). These warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems. This value is well above 16.1 ¬∞C (60.9 ¬∞F), the long term global average surface temperature of the oceans. However, this requirement can be considered only a general baseline because it assumes that the ambient atmospheric environment surrounding an area of disturbed weather presents average conditions. Tropical cyclones have intensified when SSTs were slightly below this standard temperature. Tropical cyclones are known to form even when normal conditions are not met. For example, cooler air temperatures at a higher altitude (e.g., at the 500 hPa level, or 5.9 km) can lead to tropical cyclogenesis at lower water temperatures, as a certain lapse rate is required to force the atmosphere to be unstable enough for convection. In a moist atmosphere, this lapse rate is 6.5 ¬∞C/km, while in an atmosphere with less than 100% relative humidity, the required lapse rate is 9.8 ¬∞C/km. At the 500 hPa level, the air temperature averages ‚àí7 ¬∞C (18 ¬∞F) within the tropics, but air in the tropics is normally dry at this height, giving the air room to wet- bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wet-bulb temperature at 500 hPa in a tropical atmosphere of is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is , and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 ¬∞C in the sea surface temperature for each 1 ¬∞C change at 500 hpa. Inside a cold cyclone, 500 hPa temperatures can fall as low as , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres. This also explains why moisture in the mid-levels of the troposphere, roughly at the 500 hPa level, is normally a requirement for development. However, when dry air is found at the same height, temperatures at 500 hPa need to be even colder as dry atmospheres require a greater lapse rate for instability than moist atmospheres. At heights near the tropopause, the 30-year average temperature (as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990) was ‚àí77 ¬∞C (‚àí132 ¬∞F). A recent example of a tropical cyclone that maintained itself over cooler waters was Epsilon of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. The global impact of changes in sea surface temperature on marine life necessitates the implementation of the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 14.

They are used to describe two different frameworks for understanding the same phenomenon or aspect of reality. In particular, the concepts were developed in order to explain the bizarre behavior of subatomic particles which quantum physics struggles to explain. In Bohm's Wholeness and the Implicate Order, he used these notions to describe how the appearance of such phenomena might appear differently, or might be characterized by, varying principal factors, depending on contexts such as scales.David Bohm: Wholeness and the Implicate Order, Routledge, 1980 (). The implicate (also referred to as the \\"enfolded\\") order is seen as a deeper and more fundamental order of reality. In contrast, the explicate or \\"unfolded\\" order include the abstractions that humans normally perceive. As he wrote: :In the enfolded [or implicate] order, space and time are no longer the dominant factors determining the relationships of dependence or independence of different elements. Rather, an entirely different sort of basic connection of elements is possible, from which our ordinary notions of space and time, along with those of separately existent material particles, are abstracted as forms derived from the deeper order. These ordinary notions in fact appear in what is called the \\"explicate\\" or \\"unfolded\\" order, which is a special and distinguished form contained within the general totality of all the implicate orders ().  Overview  The notion of implicate and explicate orders emphasizes the primacy of structure and process over individual objects. The latter are seen as mere approximations of an underlying process. In this approach, quantum particles and other objects are understood to have only a limited degree of stability and autonomy.P. Pylkk√§nen, B. J. Hiley, I. P√§ttiniemi: Bohm's approach and Individuality, arXiv:1405.4772v3, version 3 of 28 November 2014 Bohm believed that the weirdness of the behavior of quantum particles is caused by unobserved forces, maintaining that space and time might actually be derived from an even deeper level of objective reality. In the words of F. David Peat, Bohm considered that what we take for reality are \\"surface phenomena, explicate forms that have temporarily unfolded out of an underlying implicate order\\". That is, the implicate order is the ground from which reality emerges.F. David Peat, Non- locality in nature and cognition, pp. 297‚Äì311. In: = The implicate order as an algebra = Bohm, his co-worker Basil Hiley, and other physicists of Birkbeck College worked toward a model of quantum physics in which the implicate order is represented in the form of an appropriate algebra or other pregeometry. They considered spacetime itself as part of an explicate order that is connected to an implicate order that they called pre-space. The spacetime manifold and the properties of locality and nonlocality all arise from an order in such pre-space. A. M. Frescura and Hiley suggested that an implicate order could be carried by an algebra, with the explicate order being contained in the various representations of this algebra.F. A. M. Frescura, B. J. Hiley: Algebras, quantum theory and pre-space, pp. 3‚Äì4 (published in Revista Brasileira de Fisica, Volume Especial, Julho 1984, Os 70 anos de Mario Schonberg, pp. 49‚Äì86) (See also: Work by Bohm and Hiley on implicate orders, pre-space and algebraic structures.) In analogy to Alfred North Whitehead's notion of \\"actual occasion\\",A. N. Whitehead, _Process and Reality_ , Corrected Edition, ed. D. Griffin and D. Sherburne (New York: Macmillan, 1978), pp. 18 ff. Bohm considered the notion of moment‚Äìa moment being a not entirely localizable event, with events being allowed to overlap David Bohm: Time, the implicate order, and pre-space, In: David R. Griffin: Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time, State University of New York Press, 1986, , pp. 177‚Äì208, p. 183 and being connected in an overall implicate order:David Bohm: Time, the implicate order, and pre-space, In: David R. Griffin: Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time, State University of New York Press, 1986, , pp. 177‚Äì208, p. 189 Bohm emphasized the primary role of the implicate order's structure:David Bohm: Time, the implicate order, and pre-space, In: David R. Griffin: Physics and the Ultimate Significance of Time, State University of New York Press, 1986, , pp. 177‚Äì208, pp. 192‚Äì193 = The explicate order and quantum entanglement = Central to Bohm's schema are correlations between observables of entities which seem separated by great distances in the explicate order (such as a particular electron here on earth and an alpha particle in one of the stars in the Abell 1835 galaxy, the farthest galaxy from Earth known to humans), manifestations of the implicate order. Within quantum theory there is entanglement of such objects. This view of order necessarily departs from any notion which entails signalling, and therefore causality. The correlation of observables does not imply a causal influence, and in Bohm's schema the latter represents 'relatively' independent events in space-time; and therefore explicate order. = A common grounding for consciousness and matter = Karl H. Pribram's research suggests that memories may not be localized in specific regions of brains The implicate order represents the proposal of a general metaphysical concept in terms of which it is claimed that matter and consciousness might both be understood, in the sense that it is proposed that both matter and consciousness: (i) enfold the structure of the whole within each region, and (ii) involve continuous processes of enfoldment and unfoldment. For example, in the case of matter, entities such as atoms may represent continuous enfoldment and unfoldment which manifests as a relatively stable and autonomous entity that can be observed to follow a relatively well-defined path in space-time. In the case of consciousness, Bohm pointed toward evidence presented by Karl Pribram that memories may be enfolded within every region of the brain rather than being localized (for example in particular regions of the brain, cells, or atoms). Bohm went on to say: > As in our discussion of matter in general, it is now necessary to go into > the question of how in consciousness the explicate order is what is manifest > ... the manifest content of consciousness is based essentially on memory, > which is what allows such content to be held in a fairly constant form. Of > course, to make possible such constancy it is also necessary that this > content be organized, not only through relatively fixed association but also > with the aid of the rules of logic, and of our basic categories of space, > time, causality, universality, etc. ... there will be a strong background of > recurrent, stable, and separable features, against which the transitory and > changing aspects of the unbroken flow of experience will be seen as fleeting > impressions that tend to be arranged and ordered mainly in terms of the vast > totality of the relatively static and fragmented content of [memories]. Bohm also claimed that \\"as with consciousness, each moment has a certain explicate order, and in addition it enfolds all the others, though in its own way. So the relationship of each moment in the whole to all the others is implied by its total content: the way in which it 'holds' all the others enfolded within it\\". Bohm characterises consciousness as a process in which at each moment, content that was previously implicate is presently explicate, and content which was previously explicate has become implicate. > One may indeed say that our memory is a special case of the process > described above, for all that is recorded is held enfolded within the brain > cells and these are part of matter in general. The recurrence and stability > of our own memory as a relatively independent sub-totality is thus brought > about as part of the very same process that sustains the recurrence and > stability in the manifest order of matter in general. It follows, then, that > the explicate and manifest order of consciousness is not ultimately distinct > from that of matter in general.  Analogies  = Ink droplet analogy = Bohm also used the term unfoldment to characterise processes in which the explicate order becomes relevant (or \\"relevated\\"). Bohm likens unfoldment also to the decoding of a television signal to produce a sensible image on a screen. The signal, screen, and television electronics in this analogy represent the implicate order while the image produced represents the explicate order. He also uses an example in which an ink droplet can be introduced into a highly viscous substance (such as glycerine), and the substance rotated very slowly such that there is negligible diffusion of the substance. In this example, the droplet becomes a thread which, in turn, eventually becomes invisible. However, by rotating the substance in the reverse direction, the droplet can essentially reform. When it is invisible, according to Bohm, the order of the ink droplet as a pattern can be said to be implicate within the substance. In another analogy, Bohm asks us to consider a pattern produced by making small cuts in a folded piece of paper and then, literally, unfolding it. Widely separated elements of the pattern are, in actuality, produced by the same original cut in the folded piece of paper. Here the cuts in the folded paper represent the implicate order and the unfolded pattern represents the explicate order. = Holograms and implicate order = In a holographic reconstruction, each region of a photographic plate contains the whole image Bohm employed the hologram as a means of characterising implicate order, noting that each region of a photographic plate in which a hologram is observable contains within it the whole three-dimensional image, which can be viewed from a range of perspectives. That is, each region contains a whole and undivided image. In Bohm's words: > There is the germ of a new notion of order here. This order is not to be > understood solely in terms of a regular arrangement of objects (e.g., in > rows) or as a regular arrangement of events (e.g. in a series). Rather, a > total order is contained, in some implicit sense, in each region of space > and time. Now, the word 'implicit' is based on the verb 'to implicate'. This > means 'to fold inward' ... so we may be led to explore the notion that in > some sense each region contains a total structure 'enfolded' within it\\". Bohm noted that although the hologram conveys undivided wholeness, it is nevertheless static. In this view of order, laws represent invariant relationships between explicate entities and structures, and thus Bohm maintained that in physics, the explicate order generally reveals itself within well-constructed experimental contexts as, for example, in the sensibly observable results of instruments. With respect to implicate order, however, Bohm asked us to consider the possibility instead \\"that physical law should refer primarily to an order of undivided wholeness of the content of description similar to that indicated by the hologram rather than to an order of analysis of such content into separate parts ...\\". = Implicate order in art = In the work Science, Order, and Creativity (Bohm and Peat, 1987), examples of implicate orders in science are laid out, as well as implicate orders which relate to painting, poetry and music. Bohm and Peat emphasize the role of orders of varying complexity, which influence the perception of a work of art as a whole. They note that implicate orders are accessible to human experience. They refer for instance to earlier notes which reverberate when listening to music, or various resonances of words and images which are perceived when reading or hearing poetry. Christopher Alexander discussed his work in person with Bohm, and pointed out connections among his work and Bohm's notion of an implicate order in The Nature of Order.Christopher Alexander: The Nature of Order, Book 4 ‚Äì The Luminous Ground: An Essay on the Art of Building and the Nature of the Universe, Center for Environmental Structure, , Footnotes 19 and 20 on p. 336, cited on p. 323 Bohm features as a fictional character in the novel The Wave by British author Lochlan Bloom. The novel includes multiple narratives and explores many of the concepts of Bohm's work on implicate and explicate orders.  Challenges to some generally prevailing views  In proposing this new notion of order, Bohm explicitly challenged a number of tenets that he believed are fundamental to much scientific work: # that phenomena are reducible to fundamental particles and laws describing the behaviour of particles, or more generally to any static (i.e., unchanging) entities, whether separate events in space-time, quantum states, or static entities of some other nature; # related to (1), that human knowledge is most fundamentally concerned with mathematical prediction of statistical aggregates of particles; # that an analysis or description of any aspect of reality (e.g., quantum theory, the speed of light) can be unlimited in its domain of relevance; # that the Cartesian coordinate system, or its extension to a curvilinear system, is the deepest conception of underlying order as a basis for analysis and description of the world; # that there is ultimately a sustainable distinction between reality and thought, and that there is a corresponding distinction between the observer and observed in an experiment or any other situation (other than a distinction between relatively separate entities valid in the sense of explicate order); and # that it is, in principle, possible to formulate a final notion concerning the nature of reality, i.e., a Theory of Everything. A hydrogen atom and its constituent particles: an example of an over-simplified way of looking at a small collection of posited building blocks of the universe Bohm's proposals have at times been dismissed largely on the basis of such tenets. His paradigm is generally opposed to reductionism, and some view it as a form of ontological holism. On this, Bohm noted of prevailing views among physicists that \\"the world is assumed to be constituted of a set of separately existent, indivisible, and unchangeable 'elementary particles', which are the fundamental 'building blocks' of the entire universe ... there seems to be an unshakable faith among physicists that either such particles, or some other kind yet to be discovered, will eventually make possible a complete and coherent explanation of everything\\" (). In Bohm's conception of order, primacy is given to the undivided whole, and the implicate order inherent within the whole, rather than to parts of the whole, such as particles, quantum states, and continua. This whole encompasses all things, structures, abstractions, and processes, including processes that result in (relatively) stable structures as well as those that involve a metamorphosis of structures or things. In this view, parts may be entities normally regarded as physical, such as atoms or subatomic particles, but they may also be abstract entities, such as quantum states. Whatever their nature and character, according to Bohm, these parts are considered in terms of the whole, and in such terms, they constitute relatively separate and independent \\"sub-totalities.\\" The implication of the view is, therefore, that nothing is fundamentally separate or independent. , said: \\"The new form of insight can perhaps best be called Undivided Wholeness in Flowing Movement. This view implies that flow is in some sense prior to that of the ‚Äòthings‚Äô that can be seen to form and dissolve in this flow.\\" According to Bohm, a vivid image of this sense of analysis of the whole is afforded by vortex structures in a flowing stream. Such vortices can be relatively stable patterns within a continuous flow, but such an analysis does not imply that the flow patterns have any sharp division, or that they are literally separate and independently existent entities; rather, they are most fundamentally undivided. Thus, according to Bohm‚Äôs view, the whole is in continuous flux, and hence is referred to as the holomovement (movement of the whole). = Quantum theory and relativity theory = A key motivation for Bohm in proposing a new notion of order was the well-known incompatibility of quantum theory with relativity theory. summarised the state of affairs he perceived to exist: > ...in relativity, movement is continuous, causally determinate and well > defined, while in quantum mechanics it is discontinuous, not causally > determinate and not well-defined. Each theory is committed to its own > notions of essentially static and fragmentary modes of existence (relativity > to that of separate events connectible by signals, and quantum mechanics to > a well-defined quantum state). One thus sees that a new kind of theory is > needed which drops these basic commitments and at most recovers some > essential features of the older theories as abstract forms derived from a > deeper reality in which what prevails is unbroken wholeness. Bohm maintained that relativity and quantum theories are in basic contradiction in these essential respects, and that a new concept of order should begin with that toward which both theories point: undivided wholeness. This should not be taken to mean that he advocated such powerful theories be discarded. He argued that each was relevant in a certain context‚Äîi.e., a set of interrelated conditions within the explicate order‚Äîrather than having unlimited scope, and that apparent contradictions stem from attempts to overgeneralize by superposing the theories on one another, implying greater generality or broader relevance than is ultimately warranted. Thus, argued: \\"... in sufficiently broad contexts such analytic descriptions cease to be adequate ... 'the law of the whole' will generally include the possibility of describing the 'loosening' of aspects from each other, so that they will be relatively autonomous in limited contexts ... however, any form of relative autonomy (and heteronomy) is ultimately limited by holonomy, so that in a broad enough context such forms are seen to be merely aspects, relevated in the holomovement, rather than disjoint and separately existent things in interaction.\\" = Hidden variable theory = Before developing his implicit order approach, Bohm had proposed a hidden variable theory of quantum physics (see Bohm interpretation). According to Bohm, a key motivation for doing so had been purely to show the possibility of such theories. On this, said, \\"... it should be kept in mind that before this proposal was made there had existed the widespread impression that no conception of any hidden variable at all, not even if it were abstract and hypothetical, could possibly be consistent with the quantum theory.\\" also claimed that \\"the demonstration of the possibility of theories of hidden variables may serve in a more general philosophical sense to remind us of the unreliability of conclusions based on the assumption of the complete universality of certain features of a given theory, however general their domain of validity seems to be.\\" Another aspect of Bohm's motivation had been to point out a confusion he perceived to exist in quantum theory. On the dominant approaches in quantum theory, he said: \\"...we wish merely to point out that this whole line of approach re- establishes at the abstract level of statistical potentialities the same kind of analysis into separate and autonomous components in interaction that is denied at the more concrete level of individual objects\\" ().

It typically inhabits dragon trees. The gecko feeds on insects and probably nectar. Little is known of this species, and it is known only from a single locality. It was first scientifically described in 2004. The IUCN declines to classify it as endangered or otherwise, citing \\"no information on its distribution, population status or threats\\".http://iucnredlist.org/details/172994/0  Appearance  It is the smallest known day gecko, reaching a total length of about 7.1 cm. Its body colour is variable and dependent on the mood of the animal. During activity, the basic body colour is white-gray with a black pattern on the back. However, the body colour can turn dark also. A black lateral stripe extends from the eye to the tail. The ventral side is grayish- white.  Distribution  This species inhabits the central east coast of Madagascar, south of Tamatave. It is only known from the area around Lac Ampitabe.  Habitat  P. kely is found on dragon trees. It shares its habitat with Phelsuma seippi, Phelsuma guttata, Phelsuma lineata, Phelsuma madagascariensis madagascariensis, Phelsuma quadriocellata, Phelsuma abbotti chekei, Phelsuma dubia, Phelsuma laticauda laticauda and Phelsuma madagascariensis grandis. All these species live sympatrically and partly syntopically. In March, the daytime temperature is around 27 ¬∞C and drops to around 23 ¬∞C at nighttime. The relative humidity is between 80 and 90%.  Diet  These day geckos feed on various insects and other invertebrates. Like many members of the genus Phelsuma, this species might also feed on pollen and nectar.  Behaviour  This Phelsuma species is very shy.  Reproduction  In captivity, the females lay a pair of eggs which measure about 7 x 6 mm. At a temperature of 28 ¬∞C during the day and 22 ¬∞C at night, the young will hatch after approximately 60 days. The juveniles have a total length of about 25‚Äì28 mm.

These two channels broadcast a variety of programmes in English, including the flagship news programme BBC Wales Today which broadcasts several bulletins throughout the day including the main evening programme. In addition to these two channels, BBC Cymru Wales is required to provide programmes in Welsh, which it supplies to the Welsh channel S4C free of charge using the BBC Cymru brand. These programmes include a Welsh news service Newyddion, covering Welsh, general UK and international news, and a soap opera Pobol y Cwm, the longest running television soap opera made by the BBC. =Radio= BBC Cymru Wales operates two radio stations covering the entire country. BBC Radio Wales is the English language network, broadcasting local programmes for approximately 20 hours a day and simulcasting the BBC World Service during the station's down time. BBC Radio Cymru broadcasts Welsh programmes for approximately the same time covering a wide variety of genres. While off air, Radio Cymru simulcasts BBC Radio 5 Live's overnight programme. =Online and interactive= BBC Cymru Wales operates its own mini-site on BBC Online as well as providing news and features for other areas of BBC Online. In addition, news stories are provided for the BBC Red Button interactive service. =BBC National Orchestra of Wales= BBC Cymru Wales employs a full-time orchestra, the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (BBC NOW), who give concerts in Cardiff, Swansea and across Wales. The majority of the orchestra's concerts are recorded for broadcast on BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru. Since January 2009 the administrative base of the NOW has been the BBC Hoddinott Hall, in the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff. History The first broadcast in Wales was on 13 February 1923 from the radio station 5WA, later to become part of the BBC Regional Programme and in 1939 the BBC Home Service. During this time, the region was served from bases around Wales. During World War II, the regional services all ceased and broadcast the Home Service from London, although some Welsh content was included. The BBC's Bangor base played host to the BBC Variety Department during the war, although this fact was never officially announced. Following the end of the Second World War, the BBC Home Service continued its regional opt-outs, including an opt-out service for Wales. This opt-out continued after the change from the Home Service to Radio 4 and paved the way for two full-time radio services - BBC Radio Cymru in 1977, followed a year later by BBC Radio Wales. The first television signals in Wales came on 15 August 1952 from the newly constructed Wenvoe transmitter. The transmitter itself broadcast the national BBC Television service. Wales would gain some significance when, in 1957, the BBC West region from Bristol was established including a daily five-minute news bulletin for Wales, followed five years later by the launch of the daily magazine programme, Wales Today. Broadcasting House, Cardiff The launch of BBC Wales on 9 February 1964 provided a specific television service for the country. The new service was heavily promoted (proclaiming that Wales gets its very own TV service in 1964!) with animated promos using the sound of Welsh choirs to explain about interference from the mountains. Two years later in 1966, BBC Cymru Wales' new headquarters at Broadcasting House in Cardiff opened and the first colour broadcast for Wales followed in 1970. BBC Cymru Wales outside broadcast vehicle, 2009 Prior to 1982, BBC Cymru Wales on television provided programmes in both English and Welsh, with the news programme Heddiw and the long-running serial Pobol y Cwm figuring among the key output. However, this changed with the launch of S4C on 1 November 1982 as all Welsh-language programming on both the BBC and the ITV contractor HTV was transferred to the new channel. As part of a guaranteed ten hours a week of BBC-produced programming, Pobol y Cwm switched to the new channel while a newly expanded news service, Newyddion, was launched. Into the late 1990s, BBC Cymru Wales continued to expand their services. The first web pages for Wales began to appear on BBC Online in 1997, including a variety of features surrounding programming, schedules, community events and other stories. The following year, BBC Wales gained additional air time through the use of a late prime-time to midnight opt-out from new digital channel BBC Choice. This lasted until opt-outs ended on the channel in 2001; subsequently BBC Wales opted out of the BBC Two prime-time schedule on digital platforms to broadcast BBC 2W. This latter service closed on 2 January 2009 ‚Äì prior to the digital switchover which would have ceased separate broadcasting on analogue and digital. Expansion in the number of drama productions handled by BBC Cymru Wales since 2011 has resulted in the construction and opening on a new studio centre in Cardiff. In August 2013, it was announced that Broadcasting House and Ty Oldfield (Oldfield House), opposite, was for sale, with plans to move to a new a purpose-built headquarters in the city centre. The BBC attributed the decision to \\"ageing infrastructure at Llandaff\\" and considered sites including Central Square, land south of Cardiff Central railway station, and land between the Senedd and Atradius. In 2014, it was confirmed that Broadcasting House would be demolished and turned into 400 residential units. The BBC confirmed in 2015 that Central Square would be the location of their new headquarters building and began to move out of Llandaff studios in 2019. The new BBC Wales headquarters building opened in 2020, culminating in the building's first audio broadcast on 15 July by channel announcer Leanne Thomas. This was followed by the first radio broadcasts, by BBC Radio Cymru 2 host Daniel Glyn on the 25 July and by Radio Wales host Owen Money on the 31 July. The building's first video broadcast was made by reporter Alex Jennings as part of a piece to air on the afternoon broadcast of Wales Today. Studios = Central Square, Cardiff = BBC Cymru Wales headquarters at Central Square, Cardiff The current headquarters of BBC Cymru Wales is the BBC Wales headquarters building, based in Cardiff‚Äôs Central Square in the heart of the city. It opened in 2019, with broadcasting starting in 2020. The new building is the base for almost all BBC Cymru Wales staff, and is purpose built to house radio and TV production teams. It is the home of BBC Cymru Wales‚Äôs news services, in English and Welsh, Wales Today, BBC Radio Wales and BBC Radio Cymru, as well as production teams for UK-wide programming and programmes commissioned by S4C. Its location was decided in June 2014, on the site of the former Cardiff Central bus station. It can house up to 1,000 staff, with around half the floor space of its former Llandaff base and with 70% less studio space. Fewer studios were needed in the new headquarters partly as a result of the new purpose build facilities for drama and BBC National Orchestra of Wales in Cardiff Bay. Staff started to move into the new headquarters in October 2019, = Studios in Cardiff Bay (Roath Lock and Hoddinott Hall) = BBC Cymru Wales' Roath Lock studio complex.The expansion of BBC Cymru Wales' drama productions in recent years has resulted in investment for new studios. Drama production for BBC Cymru Wales is currently based at Roath Lock studios in Cardiff Bay. The main year-round productions on site include Doctor Who and Casualty, both made for BBC One, and Pobol y Cwm, which BBC Cymru Wales produces on behalf of S4C. In the 2000s, as a temporary measure to generate extra capacity, BBC Wales invested into Upper Boat Studios in Pontypridd to house several productions, notable centred around the 2005 remake of Doctor Who and its sister productions Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures. Despite the investment in Upper Boat, the studio complex soon became too small to house new productions being moved to the BBC Nations. As part of this decision, it was decided in March 2009 that BBC productions Casualty and Crimewatch were to relocate from their former homes at BBC Bristol network production unit to Cardiff. To house these new programmes, a new 170,000 sq ft studio complex was built, designed to house the productions of Doctor Who, The Sarah Jane Adventures, Casualty, Upstairs Downstairs, and Pobol y Cwm. Located in Porth Teigr, Cardiff Bay, Roath Lock Studios gained permission in January 2009 and construction began in June 2010 with the building topping out in February 2011. Production began at the site in autumn 2011 and the site was officially opened on 12 March 2012. As a result, Pobol y Cwm moved from the Llandaff studios and Doctor Who moved from Upper Boat studios to the new complex, with Casualty joining them at the site. Despite being designed to house them, the site never housed the Sarah Jane Adventures, following the death of main actress Elisabeth Sladen in 2011, or Upstairs Downstairs, following the series' cancellation. BBC National Orchestra of Wales operated from a purpose built orchestra studio, Studio 1, in Broadcasting House from 1966-2008. They then moved to new purpose built facilities at BBC Hoddinott Hall in January 2009, as part of the Wales Millennium Centre campus. = Broadcasting House, Llandaff = Until 2020, BBC Cymru Wales‚Äôs headquarters were at Broadcasting House, Llandaff, Cardiff. The studio centre was built in 1966 and opened the following year as a purpose built location to house the expanding presence of the BBC in Cardiff. The centre contained studios for the news programmes, radio space including that used by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales until 2009, and another studio for drama productions constructed in the mid-1970s. It was the first time that all of BBC Cymru Wales‚Äôs departments within Cardiff were located on one site. Previously, the BBC in Wales had been located in a converted chapel in Broadway, Cardiff and in temporary accommodation at BBC Broadcasting Centre on the banks of the River Taff. While these studios played host to drama, entertainment and regional programmes, the site was still not ideal. The site only held two studios, both located in the church, and the ability to broadcast film was not installed on the site for several years; film played into programmes from a telecine machine in Bristol or London and film processing for news was carried out by a firm called Park Pictures in Cardiff until BBC processing was installed in Stacey Road. = Studios outside of Cardiff = BBC Cymru Wales building in Bangor, Gwynedd. BBC Cymru Wales‚Äôs main studios outside of Cardiff are based in Bangor, Gwynedd, and are home to around 50 staff. Much of BBC Radio Cymru‚Äôs daytime output is broadcast from here. Across Wales, there are also a number of properties that the BBC owns are local radio studios. These are primarily used as contributor studios, where interviewees or reporters can join a radio programme from an ISDN line, with the presenter remaining in the main studio in Cardiff or Bangor. These studios are located in Aberystwyth, Carmarthen, Newtown, Penrhyndeudraeth, Swansea and Wrexham.

In recent years, its drama output has been particularly successful, including the 2005 revival of the classic science-fiction series Doctor Who and its spin-offs Torchwood (2006) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007). In addition, BBC Wales commissions other drama output for the BBC network from independent producers, such as Life on Mars (2006-07). =In-house productions= The following productions were created by BBC Cymru Wales for broadcast in Wales: * Wales Today (1962‚Äìpresent) * Week In Week Out (1964‚Äìpresent) * Pobol y Cwm (1974‚Äìpresent) * Ffeil (1995‚Äìpresent) * Scrum V (1995‚Äìpresent) * Newyddion (1982‚Äìpresent) * Hospital 24/7 (2009‚Äìpresent) * BBC Wales Live (2019‚Äìpresent) * Politics Wales (2019‚Äìpresent) * BBC Wales Investigates Former productions * Satellite City (1996‚Äì1999) * Belonging (1999‚Äì2009) * The Bench (2001‚Äì2002) * First Degree (2002) * High Hopes (2002‚Äì2009) In addition to programming for Wales, networked productions from BBC Cymru Wales include: * Grand Slam (1978) * The Life and Times of David Lloyd George (1981) * Ennal's Point (1982) * The District Nurse (1984‚Äì1987) * Border Cafe * He Knew He Was Right (2004) * Doctor Who (2005‚Äìpresent) * Doctor Who Confidential (2005‚Äì2011) * Class (2016) * The Chatterley Affair (2006) * Torchwood (2006‚Äì2009) * Torchwood Declassified (2006‚Äì2009) * Tribe (2007) * The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007‚Äì2011) * Top Dogs (2009) * Upstairs Downstairs (2010‚Äì2012) * Sarah Jane's Alien Files (2010) * Wizards vs Aliens (2012‚Äì2014) * Casualty (2012‚Äìpresent) =Independent commissions= In addition to the in-house commissions, BBC Wales also commissions other independent companies to produce programmes.

Most of Kiczales' work throughout the years has been focused on allowing software engineers to create programs that look as much as possible like their design, to reduce complexity and make code maintenance easier, ultimately improving software quality.  Career  After pursuing undergraduate studies at MIT, Kiczales started his research career in 1980 at the MIT Lab for Computer Science, where he stayed until 1983. In 1984, he joined the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center software research lab as Member of Research Staff, becoming Principal Scientist in 1996. Throughout his time at PARC, Kiczales developed some of his most important research works, including aspect-oriented programming and AspectJ. He left PARC in 1999 to focus on computer science education. In 2000, he moved to Canada and joined the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia as a tenured professor. At UBC, Kiczales started the Software Practices Lab and designed a number of courses related to software engineering and programming languages. Most importantly, he designed CPSC 110, the introductory programming course in the UBC curriculum, which students take in their first year of undergraduate studies. The course focuses on systematic program design by means of design recipes. In 2002, he co- founded Intentional Software with Charles Simonyi, but then left the company in 2003 in order to return to UBC. In 2012, he won the Senior AITO Dahl- Nygaard Prize for his work on the Common Lisp Object System, and was named an ACM Fellow for his contributions to aspect-oriented programming.

Launched by SM Entertainment on March 24, 1998, the group signed with Good Entertainment in 2004 before creating their Shinhwa Company to manage their career as a band. The band struggled initially with their first album before finding commercial success with their sophomore album T.O.P. (April 1999). When their contract with SM Entertainment expired in July 2003, all six members signed with Good Entertainment and assumed creative control with the release of Brand New (August 2004). That same year, members began to pursue individual careers. After a four-year hiatus due to majority of the members completing their mandatory military service, the sextet established the Shinhwa Company to facilitate their group career. The release of their tenth album The Return (2012) made them the first Korean boy band to continue performing after the members' mandatory military services. Shinhwa is also the first K-pop idol group to lead a successful career after leaving its original agency, despite being embroiled in legal battles with SM Entertainment over the name \\"Shinhwa\\" for several years. Over the course of their twenty-year career, Shinhwa have released thirteen Korean studio albums, one Japanese album, and various compilation albums. The group is the longest-running boy band in the history of K-pop and is often referred to as part of the \\"first generation\\" of K-pop, alongside H.O.T., S.E.S., g.o.d, Fin.K.L, among others. Their work and longevity have served as influences to future generations of K-pop idol groups, leading many to describe the band itself as \\"legendary\\".

Composed of members Mun Eric, Lee Min-woo, Kim Dong-wan, Jun Jin, Shin Hye-Sung, and Lee Andy, the group was named Shinhwa, the Korean word for myth or legend, and made their debut with Resolver on May 9, 1998. The album was supported by three singles: the titled track, \\"Eusha! Eusha!\\" (Hangul: \\"ÏúºÏå∞! ÏúºÏå∞!\\"), and \\"Sharing Forever\\" (Hangul: \\"Ï≤úÏùºÏú†Ìòº\\"). Resolver's chart performance was lackluster, however, and Shinhwa was accused of lacking originality and duplicating label mate H.O.T.'s sound. The group also became embroiled in controversies when the 1998 Sokcho submarine incident occurred, and \\"Eusha! Eusha!, which was about a fun trip at the beach, was used as a reminder of the event.

The group received the Best Music Video from a New Male Pop Group award from the Mnet Asian Music Awards. Only One (May 2000) became their first to debut at the top of the chart. Buoyed by three singles, \\"Only One\\", \\"All Your Dreams\\", and \\"First Love\\", it sold over 423,000 copies, and Shinhwa won three awards that year: the SBS Gayo Popularity Award, the KMTV song Bonsang Award, and the Popular Singers Award. That January, Shinhwa held their first concert, First Mythology. Shinhwa's fourth album, Hey, Come On!, was released on June 8, 2001, debuting at No. 3 and was promoted with two singles: \\"Hey, Come On!\\" and \\"Wild Eyes\\", the latter of which spawned various dance covers due to its choreography incorporating the use of chairs. The album was a commercial success, selling over 430,700 copies and ranked No. 11 on the 2001 year-end chart. Shinhwa was also associated with several controversies at the time, including scrutiny over the absence of member Andy and the alleged copying of Shinhwa's popular single, \\"Hey, Come On!\\" by Taiwanese boy band, Energy. =2002‚Äì2003: Making history, change in management, and solo activities= Their first compilation album, My Choice (January 2002), featured some of the members' favorite songs and some of their most popular tracks. In contrast to Hey, Come On!'s strong sales, My Choice was met with moderate success, selling more than 171,300 copies while debuting and peaking at No. 4 before it dropped from the Korean monthly Chart. On the Year-End Chart, My Choice ranked No. 31, selling a total of 183,000 copies. A few months after the release of My Choice, Shinhwa released their fifth studio album, Perfect Man, on March 29, 2002. The album marked the return of member Andy. Perfect Man debuted atop the Korean monthly chart, becoming Shinhwa's second chart-topping album. Along with the title track, the group promoted with the album with the second single \\"I Pray 4 U\\". Final sales were over 355,000 copies and the album was ranked No. 14 on the year end Top 100 Albums in 2002 Chart, with over 362,00 copies sold. Shinhwa made history in the Korean music industry by becoming the longest-running Korean boy band with the release of its sixth album, Wedding (December 2002). The album debuted and peaked at No. 3 and sold over 273,700 copies. Wedding also marked the expiration of their contract with SM Entertainment, who offered all the members except Dongwan a second contract. The group collectively chose to sign with Good Entertainment, resulting in a court battle to retain the use of their name, which they won. Because the contract with Good Entertainment would not begin until 2004, members pursued solo activities in 2003: Min-woo went solo under the name \\"M,\\" releasing his first album entitled Un-touch-able, while Hye-sung collaborated with Kangta and Lee Ji-hoon for a project group S. Jun Jin branched out into acting with the drama Forbidden Love alongside actress Kim Tae-hee. Andy and Jun Jin participated in a Korean sitcom Nonstop 4 as well as Banjun Drama. Eric began acting in dramas soon after acting in several CFs. Shinhwa is the first to have its members promote as solo artists while still continuing group activities. The members too strived in the solo activities. The members regrouped and released the compilation album Winter Story 2003-2004 on December 30, 2003, which sold over 100,000 copies. They held their second concert The Everlasting Mythology from April 18 to April 20, 2003 and also embarked on the Winter Story Tour, traveling to six cities: Seoul, Pusan, Daejeon, Incheon, Daegu, and Kwangju. They later traveled to Japan for the Shinhwa First Live in Tokyo, holding a Japanese fan meeting called Have Fun With Shinhwa On M.Net Tour. =2004‚Äì2006: Creative control, commercial success, and first Asia Tour= Shinhwa's first album with Good Entertainment, Brand New (August 2004), debuted at No. 3 on the monthly Korean chart, peaking at No.1 in November and selling over 320,000 copies. The album saw increased creative control by the members, with Eric and Min-woo contributing to its production and Jun Jin with the choreography, leading to more dance songs being included in the final release instead of their usual pop music. The album was promoted with four singles: \\"Angel\\", \\"Oh!\\", \\"Crazy\\", and title track, and ranked No. 4 on the 2004 year-end chart. It won several accolades for the group, including Best Artist of The Year for the first time at the Seoul Gayo Daesang Awards. Several weeks later, on December 29, Shinhwa was awarded their second daesang at the 2004 SBS Gayo Daejun Awards, winning two of the possible four daesang in that year with Rain and Lee Soo Young receiving the other two. In 2004, of all musical artists and groups, Shinhwa received the most awards, totaling thirteen or more, from various places: the m.net KMTV Music Video Festival, Seoul Gayo Daesang, Golden Disc Awards and MBC, KBS, SBS Gayo Awards. The awards other than Best Artist of the Year included Best Male Artist, Best Dance Artist, and Overseas Choice Award. After the success of Brand New, Shinhwa embarked on a tour, holding a Korea-China- Japan summer camp called Shinhwa Summer Story 2004. The camp was dedicated entirely for their non-Korean fans. Although, Shinhwa was mostly on hiatus throughout 2005, they released two popular singles, \\"How Do I Say\\" and \\"Hey Dude!\\" and held the Tropical Summer Story Festival concert. For a majority of 2005, Shinhwa hosted a reality show called Let's Coke Play Battle Shinhwa!, a competition to find the next Shinhwa, with the winning group debuting as the short-lived boy band Battle under Good Entertainment. To end the year, Shinhwa released Winter Story 2004-2005, which sold over 102,300 copies. After renewing their contract with Good Entertainment for another 3 years, the group's State of the Art was released on May 11, 2006. The album debuted atop the chart and sold over 215,600 copies domestically. Brand New and State Of The Art became their first consecutive No. 1 albums, with the latter becoming the third best selling album in 2006, behind SG Wannabe's The 3rd Masterpiece and TVXQ's \\"O\\"-Jung.Ban.Hap.. Following a performance at Tokyo's Budokan Hall to celebrate the founding of Mnet Japan, their Japanese language album Inspiration #1 and the lead single, \\"This is the Sun in Our Hearts\\" released on June 14, 2006. The album released in Japan on August 16 peaked at No. 4 on Oricon Chart, selling in excess of 100,000 copies each. Shinhwa later embarked on their first Asia tour, Shinhwa 2006 Tour: State of the Art, kicking off with two concerts at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena, Seoul and visiting Japan, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and other countries. They also performed at Budokan Hall in Tokyo, and Osaka-jo Hall on September 24 and 26, as part of the 2006 Japan Tour Inspiration#1. = 2007‚Äì2012: Solo activities, 10th anniversary, and mandatory military service = In 2007, members expanded their solo activities even further while Shinhwa was on hiatus, with each members starting their own company ‚Äì M Rising (Min-woo), New Dream Entertainment (Andy), JF Story Entertainment (Jun Jin), H2 Entertainment (Dong-wan), and Top Class Entertainment (Eric) ‚Äì to manage their solo careers. Dong-wan also released his first album entitled Kim Dongwan is on July 5, 2007. Min-woo released his third album on July 10, 2007 and though he had intended to release his third album in the U.S., he released it in Korea instead. Hye-sung released his second album on August 8, 2007. Although their ninth album was set to be released in October 2007, it was ultimately delayed and they released Winter Story 2007 on December 6, 2007, which debuted at No. 3 and sold 24,500 copies. Shortly after the release of Winter Story 2007, Shinhwa staged their Asia Concert with a two-day performance on the 8th and 9 December in Saitama, Japan followed by a concert in Shanghai. Celebrating their anniversary, Shinhwa staged a 10th anniversary concert and released their ninth studio album Volume 9. Because the concert was the last concert before the members left for the army, all 22,000 seats available for the concert were sold out. After their 10th anniversary and the release of their 9th album, the members continued to work on their individual activities until their mandatory military service, with Eric enlisting in October 2008 and Dong-wan in November at Gongju, Chungcheongnam-do Both served non-active duty, e.g. they were public service workers, after undergoing four weeks of basic training. Jun Jin enlisted on October 22, 2009 at the Nonsan military camp in Chungcheongnam-do Province for four weeks of basic training and continued as a public service worker. On January 11, 2010, Andy enlisted for mandatory military service and was the only member to serve 21 months of active duty. Min-woo was the last of the members to enlist in February 2010. He also served non-active duty after undergoing four weeks of basic training. Hye-sung was exempt from military service due to serious and recurring injuries in his knee sustained during a concert in 2001. On 30 October 2010, Eric was discharged from military service. Dong-wan was discharged on December 17 after serving 24 months as an administrative worker at the Seodaemun-gu District Office. Andy was discharged from active duty on October 31, 2011 from the Ministry of National Defense in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Jun Jin was discharged on 14 November 2011, after working at the Gangnam Management Corporation, managing the culture center's fitness club and parking lot. This was followed by Min-woo on March 2, 2012, after serving as a public service officer in Seoul Station. =2012‚Äì2017: Shinhwa Company and touring= Shinhwa in 2012 After their contract with Good Entertainment expired, Shinhwa created their own company to manage their activities as a group, with Eric and Min-woo as co-CEOs and the remaining members as shareholders. Members' individual activities continue to be manage by their respective agencies. A press conference to launch Shinhwa's comeback was held on March 5, 2012 at CGV cinema in Cheongdam-dong, which was streamed live by Mnet Media. The group released their tenth studio album The Return on March 23, 2012. To promote the album, Shinhwa embarked on the 2012 Shinhwa Grand Tour in Seoul: The Return, which kicked off at Olympic Gymnastics Arena on 24 and 25 March 2012, and continued with shows in Japan, China, Taiwan and Singapore. They also hosted their first exclusive variety program, Shinhwa Broadcast, which aired on cable channel JTBC. The producers held a public shoot and press conference to showcase the program. The following year, Shinhwa resumed their music activities as a group with the release of their 11th studio album and 15th anniversary concert in March, in addition to the 2013 Shinhwa 15th Anniversary Concert: The Legend Continues at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in March. On the same day information on ticketing and a teaser video were released. The 25,000 tickets were sold out within five minutes of going on sale, by over 300,000 people who tried to buy the tickets. Their eleventh album The Classic was released on May 16, 2013, followed by an Asian concert tour, 2013 Shinhwa Grand Tour: The Classic in support of the album. Their 16th anniversary concert, Here, was held on March 22‚Äì23, 2014 at the Olympic Park Gymnastics Stadium, which sold out its 27,000 seats and crashed the website server. Due to a gambling scandal, however, Andy was absent from the shows, making a surprise appearance during the last show to apologize to the audience. In 2015, Shinhwa announced it would be appearing on Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS)'s 800th Inkigayo episode, including the return of Andy from his extended hiatus. This was followed by the release of their album in over two years, We (February 2015). The LDN Noise-produced lead-single \\"Sniper\\" rose to the top of five real-time music charts, Bugs, genie, Olleh Music, Mnet, and Cyworld, and the music video for the single reached over a million YouTube views within two weeks of the song's release. Shinhwa also won the show champion for the song \\"Sniper\\" on March 11, 2015. Their thirteenth album, Unchanging, was released on January 1, and picked at No. 3 on the World Albums Chart. They held their 17th anniversary concert 'WE' on 21 and 22 March in Korea, they went on to hold concert in various parts of China. They held their 17th anniversary FINALE concert 'WE SHINHWA' on 22 and 23 August in Korea. On May 29, Shinhwa won the trademark rights to their group name after 12 years. All the members were filled with joyed upon earning their name back after 12 years of battle. 29 May has been known to Shinhwa and their fans, Shinhwa Changjo as Shindepence Day since 2015. = 2018‚Äìpresent: 20th anniversary = Shinhwa performing at KCON JEJU 2015 In commemoration of their 20th anniversary, Shinhwa released a re-recorded darker version of their song \\"All Your Dreams\\" from the album Only One, in addition to filming a new music video. They also kicked off a fan meeting party from March 24‚Äì25 to signal the start of their 20th anniversary project, All Your 2018 and performed for KBS Music Bank's twentieth anniversary alongside other artists. On August 28, they released their album, Heart, with the title track \\"Kiss Me Like That\\" and promoted on music shows for three consecutive weeks. Their 20th anniversary concert, Heart Tour in Seoul, which will take place October 6‚Äì7, sold out within 5 minutes and crashed the website's servers upon ticket release. On April 20 and 21 2019, they held their 21st anniversary concert, CHAPTER 4.  Legacy  Shinhwa is the longest-running Korean boy band in existence, and is often listed as one of the legendary \\"first generation\\" K-pop idol groups including H.O.T., S.E.S., Sechs Kies, Fin.K.L, and g.o.d. Although the word shinhwa means myth or legend, the group themselves have been described as a \\"legendary\\" K-pop idol group for their longevity, and their constant change in image and rebranding have been credited for their continued success. Shinhwa, as a group and individually, were the first to try a lot of new things, things that K-pop groups have never tried. From being an idol-actor, to radio DJ, to branching out as solo artists while still being active as a group. When they debuted, the trend at the time was for male idol group members to remain \\"mysterious\\" and \\"dark\\", a concept the group utilized when promoting their early materials. They rebranded themselves when the \\"flower boy\\" concept, which describes \\"young males with pretty faces and 'unpretentious cuteness'\\", became popular; they have continue to adjust their images as they age, incorporating suits and polished haircuts into their looks later on. Shinhwa's intense dance moves have also become one of their staples, with their song \\"Wild Eyes\\" spawning various dance covers due to its choreography incorporating the use of chairs and the choreography for \\"Venus\\" being described as \\"high intensity\\". Shinhwa were also credited for pioneering vogue dancing in Korea. With the rise of competition from the \\"second generation\\" of idol groups in South Korea, Shinhwa began to make a foray into Asia in 2005, embarking on tours and fan meetings. They were voted as the Best Korean Singer Overseas twice in poll held by Arirang International Broadcasting. The poll allowed only foreigners to vote, with Shinhwa's songs \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" in 2006 and \\"Pretty\\" in 2007 topping the polls.Shinhwa Chosen Best Korean Singer Overseas KBS GLOBAL Retrieved on May 22, 2007 Shinhwa's popularity have also led to the creation of the official fan club, Shinhwa Changjo. The color orange has been associated with Shinhwa Changjo ever since its establishment in 1998, and is used in both Shinhwa's official and unofficial merchandise, including light-sticks, balloons, raincoats, and various kinds of apparels and accessories. These orange-colored cheering tools are used in each member's individual promotion activities as well. Similar to the band, Shinhwa Changjo is the longest running Korean fan club, and upon the release of their 12th album in February 2015, Shinhwa opened the recruitment for the 10th wave of its official fanclub. Shinhwa does not have an official light-stick like other groups, instead they have a new light-stick for every concert Shinhwa holds. Their work have inspired newer generations of artists, including 2PM, Big Bang, Dreamcatcher, EXID, MAP6, and Seventeen, many who strive to one day last as long as the sextet. Kangta, a former member of H.O.T., have also praised the group for choosing to switch labels when SM Entertainment offered contracts to all but one member instead of splitting up, a rare action among idol groups.

As it was later noted, Jeff Vincent and Peter Rafelson who wrote Hey, Come On! had sold the song to Energy, therefore, it was legal. Even so, fans of Shinhwa were angry over that fact. The Taiwanese group 5566 also covered Shinhwa's \\"Dark\\", a song included in Shinhwa's 4th album. =Leaving SM Entertainment= In 2003 SM Entertainment's 5-year contract with Shinhwa ended. Lee Soo Man, the head of SM Entertainment, offered contract renewals to all but Dongwan. Choosing to sign with a new agency instead, the choice sparked controversies when Lee denied their permission to use the name Shinhwa with the different company. At the height of the battle in September 2014, the band had to rename the agency Shinhwa Company as ShinCom Entertainment to avoid legal issues. In May 2015, after 12 years of legal battles, Shinhwa finally won the lawsuit over Joon Media and re-renamed their agency as Shinhwa Company. Open World Entertainment CEO, Seok-Woo Jang, holder of the rights to the name of Shinhwa, granted permission to use the name as long as they perform together as a group. Open World held the rights to Shinhwa's overseas concerts with Shinhwa Company, and overseas licensing of the group's albums. The heads of Top Class Entertainment and Liveworks Company are directors of Shinhwa Company, with the former in charge of promotion and management in general, and the latter providing support regarding albums, concerts and promotions.

The device's protective cover is shown standing at the back. The E-meter is an electronic device for displaying the electrodermal activity (EDA) of a human being. The device is used for auditing in ScientologyAmerica's Alternative Religions, by Timothy Miller, 1995, ;page 386 and divergent groups. The efficacy and legitimacy of Scientology's use of the E-meter has been subject to extensive debate and litigation and in accordance with a federal court order, the Church of Scientology now publishes disclaimers in its books and publications declaring that the E-meter \\"by itself does nothing\\" and that it is used specifically for spiritual purposes. Such devices have been used as a research tool in many human studies, and as one of several components of the Leonarde Keeler's polygraph (lie detector) system, which has been widely criticized as ineffective or pseudoscientific by legal experts and psychologists. History alt=Schematic of electronics for Mathison E-meter and sketch of use Electrodermal activity (EDA) is the changing electrical charges observed on the surface of the skin. EDA meters were first developed in 1889 in Russia, and psychotherapists began using them as tools for therapy in the 1900s. Volney Mathison built an EDA meter based on a Wheatstone bridge,\\"Technically it is a specially developed 'Wheatstone Bridge' well known to electrically minded people as a device to measure the amount of resistance to a flow of electricity\\", L. R. Hubbard, in: \\"The Book Introducing the E-Meter\\", page 1. Quoted in: Kotz√© report, The Report of the Commission of Enquiry into Scientology, 1972, Republic of South Africa. Section III, Chapter 8 a vacuum tube amplifier, and a large moving-coil meter that projected an image of the needle on the wall. He patented his device in 1954 as an electropsychometer or E-meter, and it came to be known as the \\"Mathison Electropsychometer\\". In Mathison's words, the E-meter \\"has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts\\". Mathison recorded in his book, Electropsychometry, that the idea of the E-meter came to him in 1950 while listening to a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard:p. 64 > In 1950 ... I next attended a series of lectures being given by a very > controversial figure, who several times emphasized that perhaps the major > problem of psychotherapy was the difficulty of maintaining the communication > of accurate or valid data from the patient to the therapist. ... it appeared > to me that the psychogalvanometer showed most promise. L. Ron Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture: > This machine, the electropsychometer, has been acting as a pilot since about > the first of January 1952. Very early I wanted a pilot; I had to have some > method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or > judgment. And I went out and looked at the existing lie detector equipment > and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney > Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned > this fact. ... I had one of the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it > didn‚Äôt do anything very much, police detectors didn‚Äôt do anything very much, > and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This > machine is relatively simple, but it's a current floating inside another > current .. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this > basis of all of a sudden having a pilot. Mathison began working with Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, U.S. Patent 2,684,670. After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents (, ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard. In a separate line of development, EDA monitors were incorporated in polygraph machines by Leonarde Keeler. Rigorous testing of the polygraph has yielded mixed results (see Polygraph main page), and some critics classify polygraph operation as a pseudoscience. =Scientology= Mark Super VII Quantum E-meter, the previous standard model The Mark VI E-meter The E-meter was adopted for use in Dianetics and Scientology when Mathison collaborated with L. Ron Hubbard in 1951. Some sources say the E-meter was \\"developed by Volney Mathison following Hubbard's designs\\", or that Hubbard invented it. Hubbard falsely claimed to be the inventor of the E-meter, a claim which is in keeping with the Scientology stance that Hubbard is the \\"source\\", or \\"the only originator of all Dianetics and Scientology material\\". The E-meter was not part of the early days of Dianetics and Scientology. Auditing was composed of conversation and not led by a mechanical device. Hubbard introduced an E-meter prototype during the 1952 Philadelphia Doctorate Course but did not introduce his transistorized version until several years later. The E-meter became \\"the principal material artifact\\" of Dianetics and Scientology from the 1960s onward. In the book, L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman?, Bent Corydon wrote: Though it seemed for a while that Scientology's more advanced techniques would serve without an E-meter, a few months later in May 1955, Hubbard wrote: The Scientology meter was smaller, based on transistors rather than vacuum tubes, and powered by a low-voltage rechargeable battery rather than line voltage. From then on, the E-meter was a required tool for Scientology ministers. The \\"Hubbard Mark II\\" E-meter was christened in 1960 and the Hubbard Mark III shortly after. On December 6, 1966, Hubbard won a patent on the Mark V version under the name \\"Hubbard Electropsychometer\\". Corydon wrote that the Hubbard E-meter was actually developed by Scientologists Don Breeding and Joe Wallis, though the patent () does not list other developers. Corydon's account was said to be based on the memoirs of Hubbard's son, Ronald DeWolf, but in 1987, DeWolf sued the publisher to prevent publication and swore an affidavit repudiating everything in the book.Affidavit submitted by DeWolf to a notary in Nevada The Scientology E-meter has been redesigned and re-patented several times since its first introduction to Dianetics (e.g.: , , ). In 1969, Scientology was accepted as a religion by the Court of Appeal and declared that the E-meter was useful in \\"bona fide religious counseling\\". District Court Judge Gesell, while denying medical validity to the device, returned the e-meter to the Church. All e-meters from this point forward had to be inscribed with a disclaimer that it was not for medical or scientific diagnoses, treatment or prevention of any disease. The church reformulated the disclaimer into: \\"The Hubbard electrometer is a religious artifact. By itself, this meter does nothing. It is for religious use by students and Ministers of the church in Confessionals and pastoral counseling only.\\" Modern applications stress test using an e-meter. EDA meters are used in both therapist-patient and bio-feedback settings. EDA is one of the factors recorded by polygraphs, and EDA meters are often used in human studies to gauge psychological responses. EDA monitoring is on the increase in clinical applications. Hugo D. Critchley, Chair in Psychiatry at the Brighton and Sussex Medical School states, \\"EDA is a sensitive psychophysiological index of changes in autonomic sympathetic arousal that are integrated with emotional and cognitive states.\\" =Scientology= E-meters are used in Scientology and Dianetics by Scientology ministers known as \\"auditors\\". Scientology materials traditionally refer to the subject as the \\"preclear\\", although auditors continue to use the meter on subjects who are well beyond the \\"clear\\" level. The auditor gives the preclear a series of commands or questions while the preclear holds a pair of cylindrical electrodes (\\"cans\\") connected to the meter, and the auditor notes both the verbal response and the activity of the meter. Auditor training includes familiarization with a number of characteristic needle movements, each with a specific significance. Religion scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen describes the e-meter as \\"a technical device that could help the auditor locate engrams and areas of change when auditing a preclear\\". Some critics of Dianetics and Scientology assert that the Scientology concepts associated with the E-meter and its use are regarded by the scientific and medical communities as pseudoscience, and that the E-meter has never been subjected to clinical trials as a therapeutic tool. Nevertheless, by 1972, more than 1500 articles on electrodermal activity (EDA) had been published in professional publications, and today EDA is regarded as a popular method for investigating human psychophysiological phenomena. Scientologists claim that in the hands of a trained operator, the meter can indicate whether a person has been relieved from the spiritual impediment of past experiences.Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights, In accordance with a 1974 federal court order, the Church of Scientology asserts that the E-meter is intended for use only in church-sanctioned auditing sessions; it is not a curative or medical device.Religionsfreiheit und Konformismus: √úber Minderheiten und die Macht der Mehrheit, Gerhard Besier, 2004. The E-meters used by the Church were previously manufactured by Scientologists at their Gold Base facility, but now are manufactured in Hong Kong and Taiwan. According to Hubbard, the E-meter is used by the operator for three vital functions: # To determine what process to run and what to run it on. # To observe how well the process is running. # To know when the process should be stopped. The Church claims that the E-meter can be used to assess the emotion charge of single words, whole sentences, and questions, as well as indicating the general state of the subject when the operator is not speaking. Few users of the E-meter claim that it does anything to the subject. To most, it does no more than suggest to the operator a change of mental, emotional, or parasympathetic nervous state or activity. New religious movement scholar Douglas Cowan writes that Scientologists cannot progress along the Bridge to Total Freedom without an E-meter, and that Hubbard even told Scientologists to buy two E-meters, in the event that one of them fails to operate. According to anthropologist Roy Rappaport, the E-meter is a ritual object, an object that \\"stand[s] indexically for something intangible\\". Functional description One of E-meter's primary components is a Wheatstone bridge, an electrical circuit configuration invented in 1833\\"The Genesis of the Wheatstone Bridge\\" by Stig Ekelof discusses Christie's and Wheatstone's contributions, and why the bridge carries Wheatstone's name. Published in \\"Engineering Science and Education Journal\\", volume 10, no 1, February 2001, pages 37-40. that enables the detection of very small differences between two electrical impedances (in this case, resistances). The E-meter is constructed so that one resistance is the subject's body and the other is a rheostat controlled by the operator. A small voltage from the battery is applied to electrodes held in the subjects hands. As the electrical properties (electrodermal activity) of the subject's body changes during the counseling,HCO WW Staff: Essential Information Every Scientologist Should Know, HCO Information Letter of 24 November 1963. Hubbard Communications Office, East Grinstead, Sussex, England. Quoted in: Kotz√© report, The Report of the Commission of Enquiry into Scientology, 1972, Republic of South Africa. Section III, Chapter 8 the resulting changes in the small electric current are displayed in needle movements on a large analog panel meter. The dial face is without numbers because the absolute resistance in ohms is relatively unimportant, while the operator watches primarily for characteristic needle motions. The voltage applied to the electrodes is less than 1.5 V, and the electric current through the subject's body is less than a half a milliampere. In the Scientology E-meter, the large control, known as the \\"tone arm\\", adjusts the meter bias, while a smaller one controls the gain. The operator manipulates the tone arm to keep the needle near the center of the dial so its motion is easily observed. A simple E-meter powered by direct current, such as that used by the Scientologists and the like, displays several kinds of electrodermal activity (EDA) on the one dial without distinction, including changes in conductance, resistance, and bioelectric potential. Researchers in psychophysiology are also exploring admittance and impedance aspects of EDA that can be observed only with alternating current. The E-Meter, measuring variations in electrodermal activity (which can be highly responsive to emotion), functions on the same physiological data sources as one of the parts of the polygraph, or ‚Äúlie detector‚Äù. According to Scientology doctrine, the resistance corresponds to the \\"mental mass and energy\\" of the subject's mind, which are claimed to change when the subject thinks of particular mental images (engrams). One account tells about L. Ron Hubbard using the E-meter to determine whether or not fruits can experience pain, as in his 1968 assertion that tomatoes \\"scream when sliced\\". The traditional theory of EDA holds that skin resistance varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, Because sweat contains dielectrics (salt, etc.), conductivity is increased when the sweat glands are activated. But some advocates argue that the meter responds more quickly than would be possible by the exudation and drying of sweat.Article Skin conductance, main page: \\"Lastly, galvanic skin responses are delayed 1‚Äì3 seconds.\\" They propose an additional mechanism termed the \\"Tarchanoff Response\\" through which the cerebral cortex of the brain affects the current directly. This phenomenon is not completely understood, and further research needs to be performed. Law =United States= The medical establishment had been watching Hubbard's enterprises since 1951 when the New Jersey State Board of Medical Examiners prosecuted the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation (Elizabeth, New Jersey) for practicing medicine without a license.Bulletin of the Hubbard Dianetic Research Foundation, Elizabeth, New Jersey. January 1951 In 1958, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seized and destroyed 21,000 Dianazene tablets from Hubbard's Distribution Center, Inc., charging that they were falsely labeled as a treatment for radiation sickness.Wallis, Roy. Sectarianism: Analyses of Religious and Non-Religious Sects, Page 92, 1975, On January 4, 1963, in service of an FDA complaint, more than 100 US marshals and deputized longshoremen with drawn guns raided the Founding Church of Scientology in Washington, D.C. and confiscated more than three tons of propertyp. 135 including 5,000 books, 2,900 booklets, and several hundred E-meters. The FDA accused the Church of making false medical claims that the E-meters could treat physical and mental illnesses. The FDA also charged that the meters did not bear adequate directions for treating the conditions for which they were recommended. Chapter 6. The Church claimed that they had not written any publication that the E-meter could or would heal anything,p. 136 and sued to get the property back. Years of litigation ensued. In the first trial beginning on April 3, 1967, the jury found that the Church misrepresented the E-meter and the judge ordered the confiscated materials destroyed. But in 1969, the US Court of Appeals reversed the verdict; the Church, it said, had made substantial showing that Scientology is a religion and the government had done nothing to rebut the claim. The US Court of Appeals wrote: > [The Founding Church has] made no attempt to contradict the expert testimony > introduced by the Government. They have conceded that the E-meter is of no > use in the diagnosis or treatment of disease as such, and have argued that > it was never put forward as having such use. Auditing or processing, in > their view, treats the spirit of man, not his body, though through the > healing of the spirit the body can be affected. They have culled from their > literature numerous statements disclaiming any intent to treat disease and > recommending that Scientology practitioners send those under their care to > doctors when organic defects may be found. They have introduced through > testimony a document which they assert all those who undergo auditing or > processing must sign which states that Scientology is \\"a spiritual and > religious guide intended to make persons more aware of themselves as > spiritual beings, and not treating or diagnosing human ailments of body or > mind, and not engaged in the teaching of medical arts or sciences .\\" > Finally, with respect to their claim to be a religion and hence within the > protection of the First Amendment, they have shown that the Founding Church > of Scientology is incorporated as a church in the District of Columbia, and > that its ministers are qualified to perform marriages and burials. They have > introduced their Creed into evidence. The Government has made no claim that > the Founding Church is not a bona fide religion, that auditing is not part > of the exercise of that religion, or that the theory of auditing is not a > doctrine of that religion. Having found that Scientology was a religion, the Court wrote that the government was forbidden by the First Amendment of the Constitution to rule on the truth or falsity of the Church's doctrines and interfere with its practices, provided the claims are not manifestly insincere and the practices are reasonably harmless. The Court ordered a new trial with the mandate that the trial court could not forbid auditing, use of the E-meter, or purveyance of the literature within a religious context. The FDA appealed the decision, but in 1969, the US Supreme Court declined to review the case, commenting only that \\"Scientology meets the prima facie test of religion\\". In his 1973 judgment, District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell ruled that: > Hubbard and his fellow Scientologists developed the notion of using an > E-Meter to aid auditing. Substantial fees were charged for the meter and for > auditing sessions using the meter. They repeatedly and explicitly > represented that such auditing effectuated cures of many physical and mental > illnesses. An individual processed with the aid of the E-Meter was said to > reach the intended goal of 'clear' and was led to believe that there was > reliable scientific proof that once cleared many, indeed most, illnesses > would successfully be cured. Auditing was guaranteed to be successful. All > this was and is false.Secrets of Scientology: The E-Meter REFERENCE: Stephen > Barrett, MD, and William Jarvis, PhD (editors), \\"The Health Robbers\\", > Prometheus Books, Buffalo NY (1993). Chapter 23, \\"The Gadgeteers\\", by > Wallace Janssen, pp. 321-335. Unable to do more under the mandate from the Court of Appeals, Judge Gesell ordered all the property to be returned to the Church, and thereafter, the E-meter may be used only in \\"bona fide religious counseling\\". All meters and referring literature must include a label disclaiming any medical benefits: The church adopted a modified version of that statement, which it still invokes in connection with the E-meter. The current statement reads: Judge Gesell also ordered the Church to pay all the government's legal fees and warehousing costs for the confiscated property for the nine years of litigation. He also required the church to pay the salaries and travel expenses of FDA agents who might, from time to time, inspect for compliance with the court's order.p. 143 The raid was ruled illegal, but the government retained copies of the documents. =Europe= In 1979 in Sweden, a court forbade calling the E-meter \\"an invaluable aid to measuring man's mental state and changes in it\\" in an advertisement. The prohibition was upheld by the European Commission of Human Rights in case X. and Church of Scientology v. Sweden. In October 2009, a three-judge panel at the Correctional Court in Paris, France convicted the church and six of its members of organized fraud. The Court's decision followed a three-week trial, where two plaintiffs alleged they were defrauded by the organization. One plaintiff's complaint involved the use of an E-Meter by Scientologists with medical implications. This plaintiff claimed that, after being audited with the device, she was encouraged to pay tens of thousands of euros for vitamins, books, and courses to improve her condition. She argued that amounted to fraud. The Court agreed, and the ruling was upheld on appeal in 2013. See . =Australia= In 1964, the government of Victoria, Australia held a Board of Inquiry into Scientology which returned its findings in a document colloquially known as the Anderson Report. Psychiatrist Ian Holland Martin, honorary federal secretary of the Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, gave evidence that the E-Meter \\"used for Scientology\\" was a \\"psycho-galvano-meter\\" and was \\"dangerous in unqualified hands\\". He said that if the E-meter \\"was suggested to possess mysterious powers\\" to someone who did not understand that it had \\"been thoroughly discredited as a lie detector\\" then \\"that person would be suggestible to ideas foisted on him by the operator\\". The final report of the inquiry stated that the E-meter enabled Scientology > to assume, intensify and retain control over the minds and wills of > preclears. Fears of its abilities keep them in constant subjection. Its use > can be so manipulated by cunningly phrased questions that almost any desired > result can be obtained, and it is used unscrupulously to dominate students > and staff alike. All the evil features of scientology are intensified where > the E-meter is involved. When used in conjunction with hypnotic techniques, > its evil impact is greatly increased. This simple electrical device is not, > of course, the sole basis for the condemnation of scientology, but without > the E-meter scientology would be partly disarmed.State of Victoria (1965). > Report of the Board of Inquiry into Scientology p. 96 In 1965, Victoria banned the use of the E-meter without a license, with Western Australia and South Australia following suit. In 1969, the High Court of Western Australia ruled the ban illegal. South Australia repealed its law in 1973, and Victoria repealed it in 1982. In 1983, the High Court of Australia ruled that Scientology was a religion, and as such had the same rights and protections. Scientology beliefs and theories Within the Church of Scientology, the early psychoanalysts are credited with first use of the E-meter. L. Ron Hubbard credited Mathison with recreating the E-meter and bringing the first model to Hubbard for use in Dianetics. Hubbard set out his theory of how the E-meter works in his book Understanding the E-Meter: Hubbard claimed that this \\"mental mass\\" has the same physical characteristics, including weight, as mass as commonly understood by lay persons: This text in Understanding the E-Meter is accompanied by three drawings. The first shows a man standing on a weighing scale, which reflects a weight of \\"150\\" (the units are not given). The next shows the man on the same scale, weighed down under a burden of \\"Mental Image Pictures\\", and the scale indicates a weight of \\"180\\". The last picture shows the man standing upright on the scale, now unburdened by \\"Mental Image Pictures\\" and with a smile on his face, while the scale again indicates a weight of \\"148\\". Bob Thomas, senior executive of the church in the early 1970s, gave a prosaic description.

The most common two modes of interpreting are simultaneous interpreting, which is done at the time of the exposure to the source language, and consecutive interpreting, which is done at breaks to this exposure. Interpreting is an ancient human activity which predates the invention of writing. However, the origins of the profession of interpreting date back to less than a century ago.  History  = Historiography = doctor explaining the outcome of an operation to his servant, who acts as an interpreter. Research into the various aspects of the history of interpreting is quite new. For as long as most scholarly interest was given to professional conference interpreting, very little academic work was done on the practice of interpreting in history, and until the 1990s, only a few dozen publications were done on it. Considering the amount of interpreting activities that is assumed to have occurred for thousands of years, historical records are limited. Moreover, interpreters and their work have usually not found their way into the history books. One of the reasons for that is the dominance of the written text over the spoken word (in the sense that those who have left written texts are more likely to be recorded by historians). Another problem is the tendency to view it as an ordinary support activity which does not require any special attention, and the social status of interpreters, who were sometimes treated unfairly by scribes, chroniclers and historians. Our knowledge of the past of interpreting tends to come from letters, chronicles, biographies, diaries and memoirs, along with a variety of other documents and literary works, many of which (and with few exceptions) were only incidentally or marginally related to interpreting.  Etymology  Many Indo-European languages have words for 'interpreting' and 'interpreter'. Expressions in Germanic, Scandinavian and Slavic languages denoting an interpreter can be traced back to Akkadian, around 1900 BCE. The Akkadian root targum√¢nu/turgum√¢nu also gave rise to the term dragoman via an etymological sideline from Arabic. The English word ‚Äòinterpreter‚Äô, however, is derived from Latin interpres (meaning ‚Äòexpounder‚Äô, ‚Äòperson explaining what is obscure‚Äô), whose semantic roots are not clear. Some scholars take the second part of the word to be derived from partes or pretium (meaning ‚Äòprice‚Äô, which fits the meaning of a ‚Äòmiddleman‚Äô, ‚Äòintermediary‚Äô or ‚Äòcommercial go-between‚Äô), but others have suggested a Sanskrit root.  Modes  =Consecutive= St√©phane Briz√© (second from the right) speaking in French in Buenos Aires in 2019. Next to him, the interpreter (first from the right) waiting to translate into Spanish. In consecutive interpreting (CI), the interpreter starts to interpret after the speaker pauses. Therefore, the time needed is much longer (possibly double the time needed). Traditionally, the interpreter will sit or stand near the speaker. Consecutive interpretation can be conducted in a pattern of short or long segments according to the interpreter's preference. In short CI, the interpreter relies mostly on memory whereas, in long CI, most interpreters will rely on note-taking. The notes must be clear and legible in order to not waste time on reading them.http://www.imiaweb.org/uploads/pages/228_4.pdf Consecutive interpreting of whole thoughts, rather than in small pieces, is desirable so that the interpreter has the whole meaning before rendering it in the target language. This affords a truer, more accurate, and more accessible interpretation than where short CI or simultaneous interpretation is used. An attempt at consensus about lengths of segments may be reached prior to commencement, depending upon complexity of the subject matter and purpose of the interpretation, though speakers generally face difficulty adjusting to unnatural speech patterns. On occasion, document sight translation is required of the interpreter during consecutive interpretation work. Sight translation combines interpretation and translation; the interpreter must render the source-language document to the target-language as if it were written in the target language. Sight translation occurs usually, but not exclusively, in judicial and medical work. Consecutive interpretation may be the chosen mode when bilingual listeners are present who wish to hear both the original and interpreted speech or where, as in a court setting, a record must be kept of both. When no interpreter is available to interpret directly from source to target, an intermediate interpreter will be inserted in a relay mode, e.g. a Greek source language could be interpreted into English and then from English to another language. This is also commonly known as double-interpretation. Triple-interpretation may even be needed, particularly where rare languages or dialects are involved. Such interpretation can only be effectively conducted using consecutive interpretation. = Simultaneous = Alan Gordon-Finlay trialling the Hush-A-Phone at the League of Nations, circa 1927 - ILO Historical Archives Simultaneous interpretation (SI) suffers the disadvantage that if a person is performing the service the interpreter must do the best he or she can within the time permitted by the pace of source speech. However they also have the advantages of saving time and not disturbing the natural flow of the speaker. SI can also be accomplished by software where the program can simultaneously listen to incoming speech and speak the associated interpretation. The most common form is extempore SI, where the interpreter does not know the message until he or she hears it. Simultaneous interpretation using electronic equipment where the interpreter can hear the speaker's voice as well as the interpreter's own voice was introduced at the Nuremberg trials in 1945. The equipment facilitated large numbers of listeners, and interpretation was offered in French, Russian, German and English. The technology arose in the 1920s and 1930s when American businessman Edward Filene and British engineer Alan Gordon Finlay developed simultaneous interpretation equipment with IBM. Yvonne Kapp attended a conference with simultaneous translation in 1935 in the Soviet Union.‚ÄòI would switch about, listening to the speeches in French, in German, in Italian and marvel at this, to me, novel device.‚Äô Kapp, Time Will Tell, Verso, 2003, p. 170. As it proved successful, IBM was able to sell the equipment to the United Nations, where it is now widely used in the United Nations Interpretation Service. In the ideal setting for oral language, the interpreter sits in a sound-proof booth and speaks into a microphone, while clearly seeing and hearing the source-language speaker via earphones. The simultaneous interpretation is rendered to the target-language listeners via their earphones. =The progressive shift from consecutive to simultaneous= Simultaneous interpreter's station (Televic Conference) at the European Court of Justice Pavel Palazchenko's My Years with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze: The Memoir of a Soviet Interpreter gives a short history of modern interpretation and of the transition from its consecutive to simultaneous forms. He explains that during the nineteenth century interpreters were rarely needed during European diplomatic discussions; these were routinely conducted in French, and all government diplomats were required to be fluent in this language. Most European government leaders and heads of state could also speak French.Pavel Palazchenko, My Years with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze: The Memoir of a Soviet Interpreter (Pennsylvania University Press, 1997), pp. 32‚Äì33. Historian Harold Nicolson attributes the growing need for interpretation after World War I to the fact that U.S. President Woodrow Wilson and British Prime Minister David Lloyd George \\"were no linguists\\". Nicolson, Harold (2009) [1933]. Peacemaking, 1919. London: Faber and Faber. . At the time, the concept and special equipment needed for simultaneous interpretation, later patented by Alan Gordon Finlay, had not been developed, so consecutive interpretation was used. Consecutive interpreters, in order be accurate, used a specialized system of note-taking which included symbols abbreviations and acronyms. Because they waited until the speaker was finished to provide translation, the interpreters then had the difficult task of creating from these notes as much as half an hour of free-flowing sentences closely matching the speaker's meaning. Palazchenko cites , Jean Herbert and the Kaminker brothers as skilled interpreters, and notes one unusual case in which Andr√© Kaminker interpreted a speech by a French diplomat who spoke for two and a half hours without stopping. After World War II, simultaneous interpretation came into use at the Nuremberg trial, and began to be more accepted. Experienced consecutive interpreters asserted that the difficulties of listening and speaking at the same time, adjusting for differences in sentence structure between languages, and interpreting the beginning of a sentence before hearing its end, would produce an inferior result. As well, these interpreters, who to that point had been prominent speakers, would now be speaking invisibly from booths. In 1951, when the United Nations expanded its number of working languages to five (English, French, Russian, Chinese and Spanish), consecutive interpretation became impractical in most cases, and simultaneous interpretation became the most common process for the organization's large meetings.Jes√∫s Baigorri Jal√≥n. Interpreters at the United Nations. A history. Universidad de Salamanca; 2004. . p. 29‚Äì30. Consecutive interpretation, which provides a more fluent result without the need for specialized equipment, continued to be used for smaller discussions. =Whispered= Interpreter (left) next to Swedish filmmaker Johannes Nyholm at Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema 2019. Since time immemorial, whispered interpretation has been used, known in the trade by the French term chuchotage. To avoid disturbing the original speaker and those present listening to the original speaker, the interpreter's voice is kept at a low volume. To do this, the interpreter and the person requiring interpretation must sit or stand in close proximity to one another. No actual whispering is involved as this is difficult to decipher as well as being too much of a strain on the voice: the interpreter uses normal 'voiced' speech at a low volume. Only one or at the most two people in need of interpretation can be accommodated, unless portable electronic equipment is used. This form of interpretation puts a strain on the interpreter who has to sit for long periods leaning towards the person in need of interpretation. Types =Conference= Interpreting booths at a conference by the World Trade Organization 2017 Conference interpreting refers to interpretation at a conference or large meeting, either simultaneously or consecutively. The advent of multi-lingual meetings has reduced the amount of consecutive interpretation in the last 20 years. Conference interpretation is divided between two markets: institutional and private. International institutions (EU, UN, EPO, et cetera), which hold multilingual meetings, often favor interpreting several foreign languages into the interpreters' mother tongues. Local private markets tend to have bilingual meetings (the local language plus another), and the interpreters work both into and out of their mother tongues. These markets are not mutually exclusive. The International Association of Conference Interpreters (AIIC) is the only worldwide association of conference interpreters. Founded in 1953, its membership includes more than 2,800 professional conference interpreters, in more than 90 countries. =Judicial= Judicial, legal, or court interpreting occurs in courts of justice, administrative tribunals, and wherever a legal proceeding is held (i.e., a police station for an interrogation, a conference room for a deposition, or the locale for taking a sworn statement). Legal interpreting can be the consecutive interpretation of witnesses' testimony, for example, or the simultaneous interpretation of entire proceedings, by electronic means, for one person, or all of the people attending. In a legal context, where ramifications of misinterpretation may be dire, accuracy is paramount. Teams of two or more interpreters, with one actively interpreting and the second monitoring for greater accuracy, may be deployed. The right to a competent interpreter for anyone who does not understand the language of the court (especially for the accused in a criminal trial) is usually considered a fundamental rule of justice. Therefore, this right is often guaranteed in national constitutions, declarations of rights, fundamental laws establishing the justice system or by precedents set by the highest courts. However, it is not a constitutionally required procedure (in the United States) that a certified interpreter be present at police interrogation. This has been especially controversial in cases where illegal immigrants with no English skills are accused of crimes. In the US, depending upon the regulations and standards adhered to per state and venue, court interpreters usually work alone when interpreting consecutively, or as a team, when interpreting simultaneously. In addition to practical mastery of the source and target languages, thorough knowledge of law and legal and court procedures is required of court interpreters. They are often required to have formal authorization from the state to work in the courts ‚Äì and then are called certified court interpreters.The majority of state court systems utilize a certification exam developed and administered by the National Center for State Courts. Most non-native speakers of English use the term \\"sworn interpreter,\\" which is calqued from a civil-law position title common throughout the world. However, there is no common law country that uses this term. In many jurisdictions, the interpretation is considered an essential part of the evidence. Incompetent interpretation, or simply failure to swear in the interpreter, can lead to a mistrial. =Escort interpreter= In escort interpreting, an interpreter accompanies a person or a delegation on a tour, on a visit, or to a business meeting or interview. An interpreter in this role is called an escort interpreter or an escorting interpreter. An escort interpreter‚Äôs work session may run for days, weeks, or even months, depending on the period of the client‚Äôs visit. This type of interpreting is often needed in business contexts, during presentations, investor meetings, and business negotiations. As such, and escort interpreter needs to be equipped with some business and financial knowledge in order to best understand and convey messages back and forth. =Public sector= Also known as community interpreting, is the type of interpreting occurring in fields such as legal, health, and federal and local government, social, housing, environmental health, education, and welfare services. In community interpreting, factors exist which determine and affect language and communication production, such as speech's emotional content, hostile or polarized social surroundings, its created stress, the power relationships among participants, and the interpreter's degree of responsibility ‚Äì in many cases more than extreme; in some cases, even the life of the other person depends upon the interpreter's work. =Medical= Medical interpreting is a subset of public service interpreting, consisting of communication among Healthcare personnel and the patient and their family or among Healthcare personnel speaking different languages, facilitated by an interpreter, usually formally educated and qualified to provide such interpretation services. In some situations medical employees who are multilingual may participate part-time as members of internal language banks. Depending on country/state specific requirements, the interpreter is often required to have some knowledge of medical terminology, common procedures, the patient interview and exam process. Medical interpreters are often cultural liaisons for people (regardless of language) who are unfamiliar with or uncomfortable in hospital, clinical, or medical settings. For example, in China, there is no mandatory certificate for medical interpreters as of 2012. Most interpretation in hospitals in China is done by doctors, who are proficient in both Chinese and English (mostly) in his/her specialty. They interpret more in academic settings than for communications between doctors and patients. When a patient needs English language service in a Chinese hospital, more often than not the patient will be directed to a staff member in the hospital, who is recognized by his/her colleagues as proficient in English. The actual quality of such service for patients or medical translation for communications between doctors speaking different languages is unknown by the interpreting community as interpreters who lack Healthcare background rarely receive accreditation for medical translation in the medical community. Interpreters working in the Healthcare setting may be considered Allied Health Professionals. In the United States, however, providing a Medical Interpreter is required by law. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program or activity that receives Federal funds or other Federal financial assistance. Because hospitals are federally funded, they are required by this law to provide a professional interpreter to any patient that may need one. = Sign language = The hostess (in red) and a sign language interpreter at a press conference in Taipei, 2007. Two sign language interpreters working for a school, 2007 A sign language interpreter must accurately convey messages between two different languages.Ingram, Robert M. (1978). \\"Sign Language Interpretation and General Theories of Language, Interpretation and Communication,\\" in Gerver, D. & H. W. Sinaiko (Eds.), Language Interpretation and Communication. London: Plenum Press, 109-117. An interpreter is there for both deaf and hearing individuals.Ingram, Robert M. (1974). \\"A Communication Model of the Interpreting Process.\\" Journal of Rehabilitation of the Deaf 7:3 (Jan.), 3-9. The act of interpreting occurs when a hearing person speaks, and an interpreter renders the speaker's meaning into sign language, or other forms used by the deaf party(ies). The interpreting also happens in reverse: when a deaf person signs, an interpreter renders the meaning expressed in the signs into the oral language for the hearing party, which is sometimes referred to as voice interpreting or voicing. This may be performed either as simultaneous or consecutive interpreting. Skilled sign language interpreters will position themselves in a room or space that allows them to be seen by the deaf participants and heard clearly by hearing participants, as well as be in a position to hear and/or see the speaker or speakers clearly. In some circumstances, an interpreter may interpret from one language to another whether that is English to British Sign Language, English to American Sign Language, Spanish to English to American Sign Language and so on. Deaf individuals also have the opportunity to work as interpreters. If they are certified they are referred to as a CDI (Certified Deaf Interpreter), if not they would be called a DI (Deaf Interpreter). The Deaf individual will team with a hearing counterpart to provide interpretation for deaf individuals who may not know the same sign language used in that country, who have minimal language skills, are developmentally delayed, have other mental and/or physical disabilities which make communication a unique challenge, or request one. In other cases the hearing interpreter may interpret in the sign language, whichever kind of sign language the team knows and the deaf team will then interpret into the language in which the individual can understand. They also interpret information from one medium of language into another ‚Äì for example, when a person is signing visually, the deaf interpreter could be hired to copy those signs into a deaf-blind person's hand and add visual information. Some interpreters have been formally trained in an Interpreter Training Program (ITP), though this is not always required. ITP lengths vary, and are usually two or four years to obtain a degree or certificate. Graduate programs are also available. In the United States, Sign Language interpreters have National and some states have a State level certifications. The Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (RID), a non-profit organization, is known for its national recognition and certification process. In addition to training requirements and stringent certification testing, RID members must abide by a Code of Professional Conduct, Grievance Process and Continuing Education Requirement. There are many interpreter-training programs in the U.S. The Collegiate Commission on Interpreter Education is the body that accredits Interpreter Preparation Programs. A list of accredited programs can be found on the CCIE web site. European countries and countries elsewhere have their own national associations of Sign Language Interpreters. Some countries have more than one national association due to regional or language differences. The European Forum of Sign Language Interpreters (efsli) is the umbrella organization of sign language interpreters in Europe. In Canada, the professional association that recognizes and nationally certifies sign language interpreters is the Association of Visual Language Interpreters of Canada (AVLIC). Under AVLIC holds several affiliate chapters representing a specified region of Canada. Sign language interpreters encounter a number of linguistic, environmental, interpersonal and intrapersonal factors that can have an effect on their ability to provide accurate interpretation. Studies have found that most interpreter training programs do not sufficiently prepare students for the highly variable day-to-day stresses that an interpreter must manage, and there is an ongoing conversation in the interpreting field as to how to appropriately prepare students for the challenges of the job. Proposed changes include having a more robust definition of what a qualified interpreter should know, as well as a post-graduate internship structure that would allow new interpreters to work with the benefit of supervision from more experienced interpreters, much like the programs in place in medicine, law enforcement, etc. In Israel, Naama Weiss, a board member of Malach, the Organization of the Israeli Sign Language Interpreters, advertised a video which she produced. It was her paraphrase of the video So-Low, and showed her viewpoint upon the Israeli Sign Language interpreters' jobs. A study which was made in Finland found that, in comparison to the foreign language teachers and non-linguistic experts, a high cooperativeness was found to be more characteristic to simultaneous and consecutive interpreters, and Weiss showed it in her video, although she claimed to be comic.Weiss reaction on December 22, 2018, was that her video was comic. One cost-effective method of providing sign language translation services are computer-animated sign language avatars, such as SiMAX. The World Federation of the Deaf supports the use of avatars \\"for pre-recorded static customer information, for example, in hotels or train stations\\", and not to replace human translators. =Media= By its very nature, media interpreting has to be conducted in the simultaneous mode. It is provided particularly for live television coverages such as press conferences, live or taped interviews with political figures, musicians, artists, sportsmen or people from the business circle. In this type of interpreting, the interpreter has to sit in a sound-proof booth where ideally he/she can see the speakers on a monitor and the set. All equipment should be checked before recording begins. In particular, satellite connections have to be double-checked to ensure that the interpreter's voice is not sent back and the interpreter gets to hear only one channel at a time. In the case of interviews recorded outside the studio and some current affairs program, the interpreter interprets what he or she hears on a TV monitor. Background noise can be a serious problem. The interpreter working for the media has to sound as slick and confident as a television presenter. Media interpreting has gained more visibility and presence especially after the Gulf War. Television channels have begun to hire staff simultaneous interpreters. The interpreter renders the press conferences, telephone beepers, interviews and similar live coverage for the viewers. It is more stressful than other types of interpreting as the interpreter has to deal with a wide range of technical problems coupled with the control room's hassle and wrangling during live coverage. Modalities Interpreting services can be delivered in multiple modalities. The most common modality through which interpreting services are provided is on-site interpreting. =On-site= Also called \\"in-person interpreting\\" or sometimes colloquialized as \\"face-to-face\\", this delivery method requires the interpreter to be physically present in order for the interpretation to take place. In on-site interpreting settings, all of the parties who wish to speak to one another are usually located in the same place. This is by far the most common modality used for most public and social service settings. =Telephone= Also referred to as \\"over-the-phone interpreting,\\" \\"telephonic interpreting,\\" and \\"tele-interpreting,\\" telephone interpreting enables interpretation via telephone. Telephone interpreting can be used in community settings as well as conference settings. Telephone interpreting may be used in place of on-site interpreting when no on-site interpreter is readily available at the location where services are needed. However, it is more commonly used for situations in which all parties who wish to communicate are already speaking to one another via telephone (e.g. telephone applications for insurance or credit cards, or telephone inquiries from consumers to businesses). =Video= Interpretation services via Video Remote Interpreting (VRI) or a Video Relay Service (VRS) are useful for spoken language barriers where visual-cultural recognition is relevant, and even more applicable where one of the parties is deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech- impaired (mute). In such cases the direction of interpretation is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (FSL) to spoken French and Spanish Sign Language (SSL) to spoken Spanish. Multilingual sign language interpreters, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as to and from SSL, to and from spoken English), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable effort on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct natural languages with their own construction and syntax, different from the aural version of the same principal language. With video interpreting, sign language interpreters work remotely with live video and audio feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, converse with the hearing party and vice versa. Much like telephone interpreting, video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site interpreters are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRI and VRS interpretation requires all parties to have the necessary equipment. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera, in order to zoom in and out, and to point the camera toward the party that is signing. Venues Interpreting booths in the European Parliament where interpreters simultaneously interpret debates between the 24 official languages of the European Union. The majority of professional full-time conference interpreters work for phone interpreting agencies, health care institutions, courts, school systems and international organizations like the United Nations, (for the United Nations Interpretation Service), the European Union, or the African Union. The world's largest employer of interpreters is currently the European Commission, which employs hundreds of staff and freelance interpreters working into the official languages of the European Union and some others. The European Union's other institutions (the European Parliament and the European Court of Justice) have smaller interpreting services. The United Nations employs interpreters at almost all its sites throughout the world. Because it has only six official languages, however, it is a smaller employer than the European Union. Interpreters may also work as freelance operators in their local, regional and national communities, or may take on contract work under an interpreting business or service. They would typically take on work as described above. Militaries often use interpreters to better communicate with the local population. One notable example is the US military during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Associations There are a number of interpreting and translation associations around the world, including NAATI (National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters), AIIC (The International Association of Conference Interpreters), CATTI (China Accreditation Test for Translators and Interpreters), CTTIC (Canadian Translators, Terminologists and Interpreters Council), the Institute of Translation & Interpreting, and TAALS (The American Association of Language Specialists). Certifications No worldwide testing or certification agency exists for all types of interpreters. For conference interpretation, there is the International Association of Conference Interpreters, or AIIC. Specific regions, countries, or even cities will have their own certification standards. In many cases, graduates of a certain caliber university program acts as a de facto certification for conference interpretation. =CATTI= The most recognized interpretation & translation certificate in P.R.C. is China Accreditation Test for Translation and Interpretation, short for CATTI. It is entrusted by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of P.R.C. It is a translation and interpretation professional qualification accreditation test which is implemented throughout the country according to uniform standards, in order to assess examinees' bilingual translation or interpretation capability. CATTI was introduced in 2003. In later 2013, translation and interpreting tests of different levels in English, French, Japanese, Russian, German, Spanish and Arabic were held across the nation. =Use of Translation and Interpretation Certificates= Those examinees who pass CATTI and obtain translation and interpretation certificates acquire corresponding translation and interpretation professional titles. * Senior translator or interpreter ‚Äì professor of translation or interpretation * Level 1 translator or interpreter ‚Äì associate professor of translation or interpretation * Level 2 translator or interpreter ‚Äì translator or interpreter * Level 3 translator or interpreter ‚Äì assistant translator or interpreter =CATTI's Influence= Relevant institutions from Australia, France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Singapore and other countries as well as Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the region of Taiwan have established work ties with CATTI.

It is part of the Martell Mumm Perrier-Jou√´t subsidiary of the French wines and spirits conglomerate Pernod Ricard.  History  House and distillery of Martell In 1715, Jean Martell, a young merchant originally from Jersey, created his own trading business at Gatebourse in Cognac, on the banks of the Charente, and thus founded one of the first cognac houses. Martell used grapes from the vineyards in the Borderie subregion, and used Tron√ßais oak for its casks, this made a combination that resulted in an exceptionally smooth cognac. After his death in 1753, his widow and then his two sons and grandson continued this tradition and developed the export business to make Martell the number one in England in 1814. In 1831, Martell created his first \\"VSOP\\" (Very Superior Old Pale) cognac and continued its international expansion. Its fame spread throughout the world, with the first exports to Japan and other Asian markets, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Korea. Cordon Bleu, created in 1912, is certainly the company‚Äôs most famous product. Martell was served aboard the Queen Mary in 1936 and even on Concorde in 1977. In 1987, Seagram took control of the French manufacturer for $1.2 billion. Since the acquisition of some of the Seagram Group‚Äôs spirits in 2001, Martell has belonged to the French spirits group, Pernod Ricard. In the 2000s, Martell created new cognacs: \\"Martell XO\\" in 2005, \\"Martell Cr√©ation Grand Extra\\" in 2007, in a bottle designed by the artist and glass designer Serge Mansau. In 2009, Martell cognac launched its signature cognac, \\"L'Or de Jean Martell\\". In 2011, Martell expanded its \\"ultra-prestige\\" range with an exceptional cognac, \\"Martell Chanteloup Perspective\\", a tribute to the know-how of the cellar masters and to the Domaine de Chanteloup. In 2006, Martell joined the Comit√© Colbert, an association that promotes French luxury houses on an international scale. In 2010, Martell renewed its sponsorship with the Palace of Versailles, which began in 2007, by supporting the restoration of the Queen‚Äôs antechamber. In 2012, Martell Cordon Bleu, which was launched by Edouard Martell in 1912 at the Hotel de Paris in Monaco, celebrated its 100th birthday in the same place.  Products  Map of the Cognac region Martell selects crus from the Cognac region: Les Borderies, Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne and Fins Bois. Martell VSOP M√©daillon (Very Superior Old Pale) is a cognac blended from old eaux-de-vie chosen from amongst the best crus in the Cognac region. Martell Noblige Cognac is so named after the old French saying, 'Nobless Oblige', that refers to the obligations of the nobility. And this masculine, elegant Cognac is dignified and sophisticated, and considered fruity on the palate. Martell Cordon Bleu was created by Edouard Martell in 1912. Martell XO is a blend of crus from Les Borderies and Grande Champagne. Its bottle is arch-shaped. Perspective Martell Chanteloup is an \\"Extra\\" cognac which blends eaux-de-vie, some of which have been aged for several years in the cellars at Chanteloup.

Greek astronomers employed the term asteres planetai (·ºÄœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ œÄŒªŒ±ŒΩ·øÜœÑŒ±Œπ), \\"wandering stars\\", for star-like objects which apparently moved over the sky. Over the millennia, the term has included a variety of different objects, from the Sun and the Moon to satellites and asteroids. In modern astronomy, there are two primary conceptions of a 'planet'. Disregarding the often inconsistent technical details, they are whether an astronomical body moves like a planet (that is, whether its orbit and relationship to other bodies are similar to those of the classical planets) or whether it looks like a planet (that is, whether it is round or has planetary geology). These may be characterized as the orbital definition and the geophysical definition. The issue of a clear definition for planet came to a head in January 2005 with the discovery of the trans-Neptunian object Eris, a body more massive than the smallest then-accepted planet, Pluto. In its August 2006 response, the International Astronomical Union (IAU), recognised by astronomers as the world body responsible for resolving issues of nomenclature, released its decision on the matter during a meeting in Prague. This definition, which applies only to the Solar System (though exoplanets had been addressed in 2003), states that a planet is a body that orbits the Sun, is massive enough for its own gravity to make it round, and has \\"cleared its neighbourhood\\" of smaller objects approaching its orbit. Under this formalized definition, Pluto and other trans-Neptunian objects do not qualify as planets. The IAU's decision has not resolved all controversies, and while many astronomers have accepted it, some planetary scientists have rejected it outright, proposing a geophysical or similar definition instead.  History  = Planets in antiquity = The philosopher Plato While knowledge of the planets predates history and is common to most civilizations, the word planet dates back to ancient Greece. Most Greeks believed the Earth to be stationary and at the center of the universe in accordance with the geocentric model and that the objects in the sky, and indeed the sky itself, revolved around it (an exception was Aristarchus of Samos, who put forward an early version of heliocentrism). Greek astronomers employed the term asteres planetai (·ºÄœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ œÄŒªŒ±ŒΩ·øÜœÑŒ±Œπ), \\"wandering stars\\", to describe those starlike lights in the heavens that moved over the course of the year, in contrast to the asteres aplaneis (·ºÄœÉœÑŒ≠œÅŒµœÇ ·ºÄœÄŒªŒ±ŒΩŒµ·øñœÇ), the \\"fixed stars\\", which stayed motionless relative to one another. The five bodies currently called \\"planets\\" that were known to the Greeks were those visible to the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Graeco-Roman cosmology commonly considered seven planets, with the Sun and the Moon counted among them (as is the case in modern astrology); however, there is some ambiguity on that point, as many ancient astronomers distinguished the five star-like planets from the Sun and Moon. As the 19th-century German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt noted in his work Cosmos, > Of the seven cosmical bodies which, by their continually varying relative > positions and distances apart, have ever since the remotest antiquity been > distinguished from the \\"unwandering orbs\\" of the heaven of the \\"fixed > stars\\", which to all sensible appearance preserve their relative positions > and distances unchanged, five only‚ÄîMercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and > Saturn‚Äîwear the appearance of stars‚Äî\\"cinque stellas errantes\\"‚Äîwhile the Sun > and Moon, from the size of their disks, their importance to man, and the > place assigned to them in mythological systems, were classed apart. The planets as understood before the acceptance of the heliocentric model In his Timaeus, written in roughly 360 BC, Plato mentions, \\"the Sun and Moon and five other stars, which are called the planets\\". His student Aristotle makes a similar distinction in his On the Heavens: \\"The movements of the sun and moon are fewer than those of some of the planets\\". In his Phaenomena, which set to verse an astronomical treatise written by the philosopher Eudoxus in roughly 350 BC, the poet Aratus describes \\"those five other orbs, that intermingle with [the constellations] and wheel wandering on every side of the twelve figures of the Zodiac.\\" In his Almagest written in the 2nd century, Ptolemy refers to \\"the Sun, Moon and five planets.\\" Hyginus explicitly mentions \\"the five stars which many have called wandering, and which the Greeks call Planeta.\\" Marcus Manilius, a Latin writer who lived during the time of Caesar Augustus and whose poem Astronomica is considered one of the principal texts for modern astrology, says, \\"Now the dodecatemory is divided into five parts, for so many are the stars called wanderers which with passing brightness shine in heaven.\\" The single view of the seven planets is found in Cicero's Dream of Scipio, written sometime around 53 BC, where the spirit of Scipio Africanus proclaims, \\"Seven of these spheres contain the planets, one planet in each sphere, which all move contrary to the movement of heaven.\\" In his Natural History, written in 77 AD, Pliny the Elder refers to \\"the seven stars, which owing to their motion we call planets, though no stars wander less than they do.\\" Nonnus, the 5th century Greek poet, says in his Dionysiaca, \\"I have oracles of history on seven tablets, and the tablets bear the names of the seven planets.\\" = Planets in the Middle Ages = John Gower Medieval and Renaissance writers generally accepted the idea of seven planets. The standard medieval introduction to astronomy, Sacrobosco's De Sphaera, includes the Sun and Moon among the planets,Sacrobosco, \\"On the Sphere\\", in Edward Grant, ed. A Source Book in Medieval Science, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 450. \\"every planet except the sun has an epicycle.\\" the more advanced Theorica planetarum presents the \\"theory of the seven planets,\\"Anonymous, \\"The Theory of the Planets,\\" in Edward Grant, ed. A Source Book in Medieval Science, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 452. while the instructions to the Alfonsine Tables show how \\"to find by means of tables the mean motuses of the sun, moon, and the rest of the planets.\\"John of Saxony, \\"Extracts from the Alfonsine Tables and Rules for their use\\", in Edward Grant, ed. A Source Book in Medieval Science, (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1974), p. 466. In his Confessio Amantis, 14th-century poet John Gower, referring to the planets' connection with the craft of alchemy, writes, \\"Of the planetes ben begonne/The gold is tilted to the Sonne/The Mone of Selver hath his part...\\", indicating that the Sun and the Moon were planets. Even Nicolaus Copernicus, who rejected the geocentric model, was ambivalent concerning whether the Sun and Moon were planets. In his De Revolutionibus, Copernicus clearly separates \\"the sun, moon, planets and stars\\"; however, in his Dedication of the work to Pope Paul III, Copernicus refers to, \\"the motion of the sun and the moon... and of the five other planets.\\" = Earth = Nicolaus Copernicus Eventually, when Copernicus's heliocentric model was accepted over the geocentric, Earth was placed among the planets and the Sun and Moon were reclassified, necessitating a conceptual revolution in the understanding of planets. As the historian of science Thomas Kuhn noted in his book, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions:Thomas S. Kuhn, (1962) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, 1st. ed., (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), pp. 115, 128‚Äì9. > The Copernicans who denied its traditional title 'planet' to the sun ... > were changing the meaning of 'planet' so that it would continue to make > useful distinctions in a world where all celestial bodies ... were seen > differently from the way they had been seen before... Looking at the moon, > the convert to Copernicanism ... says, 'I once took the moon to be (or saw > the moon as) a planet, but I was mistaken.' Copernicus obliquely refers to Earth as a planet in De Revolutionibus when he says, \\"Having thus assumed the motions which I ascribe to the Earth later on in the volume, by long and intense study I finally found that if the motions of the other planets are correlated with the orbiting of the earth...\\" Galileo also asserts that Earth is a planet in the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems: \\"[T]he Earth, no less than the moon or any other planet, is to be numbered among the natural bodies that move circularly.\\" = Modern planets = William Herschel, discoverer of Uranus In 1781, the astronomer William Herschel was searching the sky for elusive stellar parallaxes, when he observed what he termed a comet in the constellation of Taurus. Unlike stars, which remained mere points of light even under high magnification, this object's size increased in proportion to the power used. That this strange object might have been a planet simply did not occur to Herschel; the five planets beyond Earth had been part of humanity's conception of the universe since antiquity. As the asteroids had yet to be discovered, comets were the only moving objects one expected to find in a telescope. However, unlike a comet, this object's orbit was nearly circular and within the ecliptic plane. Before Herschel announced his discovery of his \\"comet\\", his colleague, British Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, wrote to him, saying, \\"I don't know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.\\" The \\"comet\\" was also very far away, too far away for a mere comet to resolve itself. Eventually it was recognised as the seventh planet and named Uranus after the father of Saturn. Gravitationally induced irregularities in Uranus's observed orbit led eventually to the discovery of Neptune in 1846, and presumed irregularities in Neptune's orbit subsequently led to a search which did not find the perturbing object (it was later found to be a mathematical artefact caused by an overestimation of Neptune's mass) but did find Pluto in 1930. Initially believed to be roughly the mass of the Earth, observation gradually shrank Pluto's estimated mass until it was revealed to be a mere five hundredth as large; far too small to have influenced Neptune's orbit at all. In 1989, Voyager 2 determined the irregularities to be due to an overestimation of Neptune's mass. = Satellites = Galileo Galilei When Copernicus placed Earth among the planets, he also placed the Moon in orbit around Earth, making the Moon the first natural satellite to be identified. When Galileo discovered his four satellites of Jupiter in 1610, they lent weight to Copernicus's argument, because if other planets could have satellites, then Earth could too. However, there remained some confusion as to whether these objects were \\"planets\\"; Galileo referred to them as \\"four planets flying around the star of Jupiter at unequal intervals and periods with wonderful swiftness.\\" Similarly, Christiaan Huygens, upon discovering Saturn's largest moon Titan in 1655, employed many terms to describe it, including \\"planeta\\" (planet), \\"stella\\" (star), \\"luna\\" (moon), and the more modern \\"satellite\\" (attendant). Giovanni Cassini, in announcing his discovery of Saturn's moons Iapetus and Rhea in 1671 and 1672, described them as Nouvelles Planetes autour de Saturne (\\"New planets around Saturn\\"). However, when the \\"Journal de Scavans\\" reported Cassini's discovery of two new Saturnian moons in 1686, it referred to them strictly as \\"satellites\\", though sometimes Saturn as the \\"primary planet\\". When William Herschel announced his discovery of two objects in orbit around Uranus in 1787, he referred to them as \\"satellites\\" and \\"secondary planets\\". All subsequent reports of natural satellite discoveries used the term \\"satellite\\" exclusively,See primary citations in Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons though the 1868 book \\"Smith's Illustrated Astronomy\\" referred to satellites as \\"secondary planets\\". = Minor planets = Giuseppe Piazzi, discoverer of Ceres One of the unexpected results of William Herschel's discovery of Uranus was that it appeared to validate Bode's law, a mathematical function which generates the size of the semimajor axis of planetary orbits. Astronomers had considered the \\"law\\" a meaningless coincidence, but Uranus fell at very nearly the exact distance it predicted. Since Bode's law also predicted a body between Mars and Jupiter that at that point had not been observed, astronomers turned their attention to that region in the hope that it might be vindicated again. Finally, in 1801, astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi found a miniature new world, Ceres, lying at just the correct point in space. The object was hailed as a new planet. Then in 1802, Heinrich Olbers discovered Pallas, a second \\"planet\\" at roughly the same distance from the Sun as Ceres. That two planets could occupy the same orbit was an affront to centuries of thinking; even Shakespeare had ridiculed the idea (\\"Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere\\"). Even so, in 1804, another world, Juno, was discovered in a similar orbit. In 1807, Olbers discovered a fourth object, Vesta, at a similar orbital distance. Herschel suggested that these four worlds be given their own separate classification, asteroids (meaning \\"starlike\\" since they were too small for their disks to resolve and thus resembled stars), though most astronomers preferred to refer to them as planets. This conception was entrenched by the fact that, due to the difficulty of distinguishing asteroids from yet-uncharted stars, those four remained the only asteroids known until 1845. Science textbooks in 1828, after Herschel's death, still numbered the asteroids among the planets. With the arrival of more refined star charts, the search for asteroids resumed, and a fifth and sixth were discovered by Karl Ludwig Hencke in 1845 and 1847. By 1851 the number of asteroids had increased to 15, and a new method of classifying them, by affixing a number before their names in order of discovery, was adopted, inadvertently placing them in their own distinct category. Ceres became \\"(1) Ceres\\", Pallas became \\"(2) Pallas\\", and so on. By the 1860s, the number of known asteroids had increased to over a hundred, and observatories in Europe and the United States began referring to them collectively as \\"minor planets\\", or \\"small planets\\", though it took the first four asteroids longer to be grouped as such. To this day, \\"minor planet\\" remains the official designation for all small bodies in orbit around the Sun, and each new discovery is numbered accordingly in the IAU's Minor Planet Catalogue. = Pluto = Clyde Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto The long road from planethood to reconsideration undergone by Ceres is mirrored in the story of Pluto, which was named a planet soon after its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930. Uranus and Neptune had been declared planets based on their circular orbits, large masses and proximity to the ecliptic plane. None of these applied to Pluto, a tiny and icy world in a region of gas giants with an orbit that carried it high above the ecliptic and even inside that of Neptune. In 1978, astronomers discovered Pluto's largest moon, Charon, which allowed them to determine its mass. Pluto was found to be much tinier than anyone had expected: only one-sixth the mass of Earth's Moon. However, as far as anyone could yet tell, it was unique. Then, beginning in 1992, astronomers began to detect large numbers of icy bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune that were similar to Pluto in composition, size, and orbital characteristics. They concluded that they had discovered the long-hypothesised Kuiper belt (sometimes called the Edgeworth‚ÄìKuiper belt), a band of icy debris that is the source for \\"short-period\\" comets‚Äîthose with orbital periods of up to 200 years. Pluto's orbit lay within this band and thus its planetary status was thrown into question. Many scientists concluded that tiny Pluto should be reclassified as a minor planet, just as Ceres had been a century earlier. Mike Brown of the California Institute of Technology suggested that a \\"planet\\" should be redefined as \\"any body in the Solar System that is more massive than the total mass of all of the other bodies in a similar orbit.\\" Those objects under that mass limit would become minor planets. In 1999, Brian G. Marsden of Harvard University's Minor Planet Center suggested that Pluto be given the minor planet number 10000 while still retaining its official position as a planet. The prospect of Pluto's \\"demotion\\" created a public outcry, and in response the International Astronomical Union clarified that it was not at that time proposing to remove Pluto from the planet list. Copy kept at the Argonne National Laboratory. The discovery of several other trans-Neptunian objects, such as Quaoar and Sedna, continued to erode arguments that Pluto was exceptional from the rest of the trans-Neptunian population. On July 29, 2005, Mike Brown and his team announced the discovery of a trans-Neptunian object confirmed to be more massive than Pluto, named Eris. In the immediate aftermath of the object's discovery, there was much discussion as to whether it could be termed a \\"tenth planet\\". NASA even put out a press release describing it as such. However, acceptance of Eris as the tenth planet implicitly demanded a definition of planet that set Pluto as an arbitrary minimum size. Many astronomers, claiming that the definition of planet was of little scientific importance, preferred to recognise Pluto's historical identity as a planet by \\"grandfathering\\" it into the planet list.  IAU definition  The discovery of Eris forced the IAU to act on a definition. In October 2005, a group of 19 IAU members, which had already been working on a definition since the discovery of Sedna in 2003, narrowed their choices to a shortlist of three, using approval voting. The definitions were:Michael E Brown, discoverer of Eris * A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun with a diameter greater than 2000 km. (eleven votes in favour) * A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun whose shape is stable due to its own gravity. (eight votes in favour) * A planet is any object in orbit around the Sun that is dominant in its immediate neighbourhood. (six votes in favour) Since no consensus could be reached, the committee decided to put these three definitions to a wider vote at the IAU General Assembly meeting in Prague in August 2006, and on August 24, the IAU put a final draft to a vote, which combined elements from two of the three proposals. It essentially created a medial classification between planet and rock (or, in the new parlance, small Solar System body), called dwarf planet and placed Pluto in it, along with Ceres and Eris. The vote was passed, with 424 astronomers taking part in the ballot. (orig link ) The IAU also resolved that \\"planets and dwarf planets are two distinct classes of objects\\", meaning that dwarf planets, despite their name, would not be considered planets. On September 13, 2006, the IAU placed Eris, its moon Dysnomia, and Pluto into their Minor Planet Catalogue, giving them the official minor planet designations (134340) Pluto, (136199) Eris, and (136199) Eris I Dysnomia. web.archive Other possible dwarf planets, such as 2003 EL61, 2005 FY9, Sedna and Quaoar, were left in temporary limbo until a formal decision could be reached regarding their status. On June 11, 2008, the IAU executive committee announced the establishment of a subclass of dwarf planets comprising the aforementioned \\"new category of trans-Neptunian objects\\" to which Pluto is a prototype. This new class of objects, termed plutoids, would include Pluto, Eris and any other future trans-Neptunian dwarf planets, but excluded Ceres. The IAU also determined that, for naming purposes, only those TNOs with an absolute magnitude brighter than H = +1 would be allowed into the category. To date, only two other TNOs, 2003 EL61 and 2005 FY9, meet the absolute magnitude requirement, while other potential dwarf planets, such as Sedna, Orcus and Quaoar, do not. On July 11, 2008, the Working Group on Planetary Nomenclature included 2005 FY9 in the plutoid class, naming it Makemake. On September 17, 2008, 2003 EL61 joined the category with the name Haumea.  Acceptance of the IAU definition  Plot of the current positions of all known Kuiper belt objects, set against the outer planets Among the most vocal proponents of the IAU's decided definition are Mike Brown, the discoverer of Eris; Steven Soter, professor of astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History; and Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium. In the early 2000s, when the Hayden Planetarium was undergoing a $100 million renovation, Tyson refused to refer to Pluto as the ninth planet at the planetarium.Space.com (2001). Astronomer Responds to Pluto-Not-a-Planet Claim He explained that he would rather group planets according to their commonalities rather than counting them. This decision resulted in Tyson receiving large amounts of hate mail, primarily from children.The Colbert Report, August 17, 2006 In 2009, Tyson wrote a book detailing the demotion of Pluto. In an article in the January 2007 issue of Scientific American, Soter cited the definition's incorporation of current theories of the formation and evolution of the Solar System; that as the earliest protoplanets emerged from the swirling dust of the protoplanetary disc, some bodies \\"won\\" the initial competition for limited material and, as they grew, their increased gravity meant that they accumulated more material, and thus grew larger, eventually outstripping the other bodies in the Solar System by a very wide margin. The asteroid belt, disturbed by the gravitational tug of nearby Jupiter, and the Kuiper belt, too widely spaced for its constituent objects to collect together before the end of the initial formation period, both failed to win the accretion competition. When the numbers for the winning objects are compared to those of the losers, the contrast is striking; if Soter's concept that each planet occupies an \\"orbital zone\\" is accepted, then the least orbitally dominant planet, Mars, is larger than all other collected material in its orbital zone by a factor of 5100. Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt, only accounts for one third of the material in its orbit; Pluto's ratio is even lower, at around 7 percent. Mike Brown asserts that this massive difference in orbital dominance leaves \\"absolutely no room for doubt about which objects do and do not belong.\\"  Ongoing controversies  Despite the IAU's declaration, a number of critics remain unconvinced. The definition is seen by some as arbitrary and confusing. A number of Pluto-as-planet proponents, in particular Alan Stern, head of NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, have circulated a petition among astronomers to alter the definition. Stern's claim is that, since less than 5 percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Even with this controversy excluded, however, there remain several ambiguities in the definition. = Clearing the neighbourhood = One of the main points at issue is the precise meaning of \\"cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit\\". Alan Stern objects that \\"it is impossible and contrived to put a dividing line between dwarf planets and planets\\", and that since neither Earth, Mars, Jupiter, nor Neptune have entirely cleared their regions of debris, none could properly be considered planets under the IAU definition. The asteroids of the inner Solar System; note the Trojan asteroids (green), trapped into Jupiter's orbit by its gravity Mike Brown counters these claims by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control the orbits of the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist with a large number of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant. In October 2015, astronomer Jean-Luc Margot of the University of California Los Angeles proposed a metric for orbital zone clearance derived from whether an object can clear an orbital zone of extent 2 of its Hill radius in a specific time scale. This metric places a clear dividing line between the dwarf planets and the planets of the solar system. The calculation is based on the mass of the host star, the mass of the body, and the orbital period of the body. An Earth-mass body orbiting a solar-mass star clears its orbit at distances of up to 400 astronomical units from the star. A Mars-mass body at the orbit of Pluto clears its orbit. This metric, which leaves Pluto as a dwarf planet, applies to both the Solar System and to extrasolar systems. Some opponents of the definition have claimed that \\"clearing the neighbourhood\\" is an ambiguous concept. Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, and organiser of the petition, expressed this opinion to National Public Radio. He believes that the definition does not categorise a planet by composition or formation, but, effectively, by its location. He believes that a Mars-sized or larger object beyond the orbit of Pluto would not be considered a planet, because he believes that it would not have time to clear its orbit. Brown notes, however, that were the \\"clearing the neighbourhood\\" criterion to be abandoned, the number of planets in the Solar System could rise from eight to more than 50, with hundreds more potentially to be discovered. = Hydrostatic equilibrium = Proteus, a moon of Neptune, is irregular, despite being larger than the spheroidal Mimas. The IAU's definition mandates that planets be large enough for their own gravity to form them into a state of hydrostatic equilibrium; this means that they will reach a round, ellipsoidal shape. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into an ellipsoid. (None of the large objects of the Solar System are truly spherical. Many are spheroids, and several, such as the larger moons of Saturn and the dwarf planet , have been further distorted into ellipsoids by rapid rotation or tidal forces, but still in hydrostatic equilibrium.) However, there is no precise point at which an object can be said to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article, \\"how are we to quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice.\\" Furthermore, the point at which an object's mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object. Objects made of ices, such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas. Heat energy, from gravitational collapse, impacts, tidal forces such as orbital resonances, or radioactive decay, also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal (though no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium), but Neptune's larger moon Proteus, which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular. In addition, the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation, indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is, and the same is true for Earth's moon.Garrick-Bethell et al. (2014) \\"The tidal-rotational shape of the Moon and evidence for polar wander\\", Nature 512, 181‚Äì184.M. Bursa, Secular Love Numbers and Hydrostatic Equilibrium of Planets, Earth, Moon, and Planets, volume 31, issue 2, pp. 135-140, October 1984 = Double planets and moons = telescopic image of Pluto and Charon The definition specifically excludes satellites from the category of dwarf planet, though it does not directly define the term \\"satellite\\". In the original draft proposal, an exception was made for Pluto and its largest satellite, Charon, which possess a barycenter outside the volume of either body. The initial proposal classified Pluto‚ÄìCharon as a double planet, with the two objects orbiting the Sun in tandem. However, the final draft made clear that, even though they are similar in relative size, only Pluto would currently be classified as a dwarf planet. A diagram illustrating the Moon's co-orbit with the Earth However, some have suggested that the Moon nonetheless deserves to be called a planet. In 1975, Isaac Asimov noted that the timing of the Moon's orbit is in tandem with the Earth's own orbit around the Sun‚Äîlooking down on the ecliptic, the Moon never actually loops back on itself, and in essence it orbits the Sun in its own right.Asimov, Isaac (1975). Just Mooning Around, In: Of time and space, and other things. Avon. Also many moons, even those that do not orbit the Sun directly, often exhibit features in common with true planets. There are 19 moons in the Solar System that have achieved hydrostatic equilibrium and would be considered planets if only the physical parameters are considered. Both Jupiter's moon Ganymede and Saturn's moon Titan are larger than Mercury, and Titan even has a substantial atmosphere, thicker than the Earth's. Moons such as Io and Triton demonstrate obvious and ongoing geological activity, and Ganymede has a magnetic field. Just as stars in orbit around other stars are still referred to as stars, some astronomers argue that objects in orbit around planets that share all their characteristics could also be called planets. Indeed, Mike Brown makes just such a claim in his dissection of the issue, saying: > It is hard to make a consistent argument that a 400 km iceball should count > as a planet because it might have interesting geology, while a 5000 km > satellite with a massive atmosphere, methane lakes, and dramatic storms > [Titan] shouldn't be put into the same category, whatever you call it. However, he goes on to say that, \\"For most people, considering round satellites (including our Moon) 'planets' violates the idea of what a planet is.\\" Alan Stern has argued that location should not matter and that only geophysical attributes should be taken into account in the definition of a planet, and proposes the term satellite planet for planetary-mass moons. = Extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs = The discovery since 1992 of extrasolar planets, or planet-sized objects around other stars ( such planets in planetary systems including multiple planetary systems as of ), has widened the debate on the nature of planethood in unexpected ways. Many of these planets are of considerable size, approaching the mass of small stars, while many newly discovered brown dwarfs are, conversely, small enough to be considered planets. The material difference between a low-mass star and a large gas giant is not clear-cut; apart from size and relative temperature, there is little to separate a gas giant like Jupiter from its host star. Both have similar overall compositions: hydrogen and helium, with trace levels of heavier elements in their atmospheres. The generally accepted difference is one of formation; stars are said to have formed from the \\"top down\\", out of the gases in a nebula as they underwent gravitational collapse, and thus would be composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium, while planets are said to have formed from the \\"bottom up\\", from the accretion of dust and gas in orbit around the young star, and thus should have cores of silicates or ices. As yet it is uncertain whether gas giants possess such cores, though the Juno mission to Jupiter could resolve the issue. If it is indeed possible that a gas giant could form as a star does, then it raises the question of whether such an object should be considered an orbiting low-mass star rather than a planet. The brown dwarf Gliese 229B in orbit around its star Traditionally, the defining characteristic for starhood has been an object's ability to fuse hydrogen in its core. However, stars such as brown dwarfs have always challenged that distinction. Too small to commence sustained hydrogen-1 fusion, they have been granted star status on their ability to fuse deuterium. However, due to the relative rarity of that isotope, this process lasts only a tiny fraction of the star's lifetime, and hence most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusion long before their discovery. Binary stars and other multiple- star formations are common, and many brown dwarfs orbit other stars. Therefore, since they do not produce energy through fusion, they could be described as planets. Indeed, astronomer Adam Burrows of the University of Arizona claims that \\"from the theoretical perspective, however different their modes of formation, extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs are essentially the same\\". Burrows also claims that such stellar remnants as white dwarfs should not be considered stars,Croswell p. 119 a stance which would mean that an orbiting white dwarf, such as Sirius B, could be considered a planet. However, the current convention among astronomers is that any object massive enough to have possessed the capability to sustain atomic fusion during its lifetime and that is not a black hole should be considered a star. The confusion does not end with brown dwarfs. Maria Rosa Zapatario-Osorio et al. have discovered many objects in young star clusters of masses below that required to sustain fusion of any sort (currently calculated to be roughly 13 Jupiter masses). These have been described as \\"free floating planets\\" because current theories of Solar System formation suggest that planets may be ejected from their star systems altogether if their orbits become unstable. However, it is also possible that these \\"free floating planets\\" could have formed in the same manner as stars. The solitary Cha 110913-773444 (middle), a possible sub-brown dwarf, set to scale against the Sun (left) and the planet Jupiter (right) In 2003, a working group of the IAU released a position statement to define what constitutes an extrasolar planet and what constitutes a brown dwarf. To date, it remains the only guidance offered by the IAU on this issue. The 2006 planet definition committee did not attempt to challenge it, or to incorporate it into their definition, claiming that the issue of defining a planet was already difficult to resolve without also considering extrasolar planets. CHXR 73 b, an object which lies at the border between planet and brown dwarf This definition makes location, rather than formation or composition, the determining characteristic for planethood. A free-floating object with a mass below 13 Jupiter masses is a \\"sub-brown dwarf\\", whereas such an object in orbit around a fusing star is a planet, even if, in all other respects, the two objects may be identical. Further, in 2010, a paper published by Burrows, David S. Spiegel and John A. Milsom called into question the 13-Jupiter-mass criterion, showing that a brown dwarf of three times solar metallicity could fuse deuterium at as low as 11 Jupiter masses. Also, the 13 Jupiter-mass cutoff does not have precise physical significance. Deuterium fusion can occur in some objects with mass below that cutoff. The amount of deuterium fused depends to some extent on the composition of the object. As of 2011 the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia included objects up to 25 Jupiter masses, saying, \\"The fact that there is no special feature around in the observed mass spectrum reinforces the choice to forget this mass limit\\". As of 2016 this limit was increased to 60 Jupiter massesExoplanets versus brown dwarfs: the CoRoT view and the future, Jean Schneider, 4 Apr 2016 based on a study of mass‚Äìdensity relationships. The Exoplanet Data Explorer includes objects up to 24 Jupiter masses with the advisory: \\"The 13 Jupiter-mass distinction by the IAU Working Group is physically unmotivated for planets with rocky cores, and observationally problematic due to the sin i ambiguity.\\" The NASA Exoplanet Archive includes objects with a mass (or minimum mass) equal to or less than 30 Jupiter masses.Exoplanet Criteria for Inclusion in the Archive, NASA Exoplanet Archive Another criterion for separating planets and brown dwarfs, rather than deuterium burning, formation process or location, is whether the core pressure is dominated by coulomb pressure or electron degeneracy pressure. One study suggests that objects above formed through gravitational instability and not core accretion and therefore should not be thought of as planets.Evidence of an Upper Bound on the Masses of Planets and its Implications for Giant Planet Formation, Kevin C. Schlaufman, 18 Jan 2018. The Astrophysical Journal, Volume 853, Number 1, 2018 January 22, http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa961c/meta Planetary- mass stellar objects The ambiguity inherent in the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with what appears to be the beginnings of its own planetary system. Were this object found in orbit around another star, it would have been termed a planet. In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), an object orbiting a young companion star at a distance of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, its vast distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse. In 2012, Philippe Delorme, of the Institute of Planetology and Astrophysics of Grenoble in France announced the discovery of CFBDSIR 2149-0403; an independently moving 4-7 Jupiter-mass object that likely forms part of the AB Doradus moving group, less than 100 light years from Earth. Although it shares its spectrum with a spectral class T brown dwarf, Delorme speculates that it may be a planet. In October 2013, astronomers led by Dr. Michael Liu of the University of Hawaii discovered PSO J318.5-22, a solitary free-floating L dwarf estimated to possess only 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter, making it the least massive sub- brown dwarf yet discovered. In 2019, astronomers at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain identified GJ3512b, a gas giant about half the mass of Jupiter orbiting around the red dwarf star GJ3512 in 204 days. Such a large gas giant around such a small star at such a wide orbit is highly unlikely to have formed via accretion, and is more likely to have formed by fragmentation of the disc, similar to a star. = Semantics = Finally, from a purely linguistic point of view, there is the dichotomy that the IAU created between 'planet' and 'dwarf planet'. The term 'dwarf planet' arguably contains two words, a noun (planet) and an adjective (dwarf). Thus, the term could suggest that a dwarf planet is a type of planet, even though the IAU explicitly defines a dwarf planet as not so being. By this formulation therefore, 'dwarf planet' and 'minor planet' are best considered compound nouns. Benjamin Zimmer of Language Log summarised the confusion: \\"The fact that the IAU would like us to think of dwarf planets as distinct from 'real' planets lumps the lexical item 'dwarf planet' in with such oddities as 'Welsh rabbit' (not really a rabbit) and 'Rocky Mountain oysters' (not really oysters).\\" As Dava Sobel, the historian and popular science writer who participated in the IAU's initial decision in October 2006, noted in an interview with National Public Radio, \\"A dwarf planet is not a planet, and in astronomy, there are dwarf stars, which are stars, and dwarf galaxies, which are galaxies, so it's a term no one can love, dwarf planet.\\" Mike Brown noted in an interview with the Smithsonian that \\"Most of the people in the dynamical camp really did not want the word 'dwarf planet', but that was forced through by the pro-Pluto camp. So you're left with this ridiculous baggage of dwarf planets not being planets.\\" Conversely, astronomer Robert Cumming of the Stockholm Observatory notes that, \\"The name 'minor planet' [has] been more or less synonymous with 'asteroid' for a very long time. So it seems to me pretty insane to complain about any ambiguity or risk for confusion with the introduction of 'dwarf planet'.\\"  See also  * Geophysical planet definition * IAU definition of planet * List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System * List of former planets * Mesoplanet * Natural kind * Planemo * Planetar (astronomy) * Planetesimal * Planets in astrology * Rogue planet * Sub-brown dwarf * Timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their moons  Notes  1. Defined as the region occupied by two bodies whose orbits cross a common distance from the Sun, if their orbital periods differ less than an order of magnitude. In other words, if two bodies occupy the same distance from the Sun at one point in their orbits, and those orbits are of similar size, rather than, as a comet's would be, extending for several times the other's distance, then they are in the same orbital zone. submitted to The Astronomical Journal, 16 August 2006 2. In 2002, in collaboration with dynamicist Harold Levison, Stern wrote, \\"we define an √ºberplanet as a planetary body in orbit around a star that is dynamically important enough to have cleared its neighboring planetesimals ... And we define an unterplanet as one that has not been able to do so,\\" and then a few paragraphs later, \\"our Solar System clearly contains 8 √ºberplanets and a far larger number of unterplanets, the largest of which are Pluto and Ceres.\\" While this may appear to contradict Stern's objections, Stern noted in an interview with Smithsonian Air and Space that, unlike the IAU's definition, his definition still allows unterplanets to be planets: \\"I do think from a dynamical standpoint, there are planets that really matter in the architecture of the solar system, and those that don't. They're both planets. Just as you can have wet and dry planets, or life-bearing and non-life-bearing planets, you can have dynamically important planets and dynamically unimportant planets.\\" 3. The density of an object is a rough guide to its composition: the lower the density, the higher the fraction of ices, and the lower the fraction of rock. The n denser objects, Vesta and Juno, are composed almost entirely of rock with very little ice, and have a density close to the Moon's, while the less dense, such as Proteus and Enceladus, are composed mainly of ice.

The plant used as a herbal tea or for medicinal usage such as gynaecological disorders is Alchemilla xanthochlora or in Middle Europe the so-called common lady's mantle Alchemilla vulgaris. There are about 300 species, the majority native to cool temperate and subarctic regions of Europe and Asia, with a few species native to the mountains of Africa and the Americas. Most species of Alchemilla are clump-forming or mounded perennials with basal leaves arising from woody rhizomes. Some species have leaves with lobes that radiate from a common point and others have divided leaves‚Äîboth are typically fan-shaped with small teeth at the tips. The long-stalked, gray-green to green leaves are often covered with soft hairs, and show a high degree of water-resistance (see Lotus effect). Green to bright chartreuse flowers are small, have no petals and appear in clusters above the foliage in late spring and summer.

It is also regarded as native in northern and central Africa as far south as Tanzania. It is reportedly naturalized in southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Alaska, British Columbia, Washington state and Connecticut.Biota of North America Program Some sources maintain that the species is widespread across North America, but these reports appear to have been based on misidentified specimens.Bj√∂rkquist, I. 1968. Studies in Alisma L. II. Chromosome studies, crossing experiments and taxonomy. Opera Botanica 19: 1-138. It is found on mud or in fresh waters. Description thumb Alisma plantago-aquatica is a hairless plant that grows in shallow water, consists of a fibrous root, several basal long stemmed leaves 15‚Äì30 cm long, and a triangular stem up to 1 m tall. It has branched inflorescence bearing numerous small flowers, 1 cm across, with three round or slightly jagged, white or pale purple petals. The flowers open in the afternoon. There are 3 blunt green sepals, and 6 stamens per flower. The carpels often exist as a flat single whorl. It flowers from June until August.Flora of North America v 22, Alisma plantago-aquatica The word alisma is said to be a word of Celtic origin meaning \\"water\\", a reference to the habitat in which it grows. Early botanists named it after the Plantago because of the similarity of their leaves. Similar species Narrow leaved water plantain Alisma lanceolatum differs only in that the leaf tips are acuminate and shape is narrow lanceolate. Traditional uses According to Flora of the U.S.S.R. (1934, translated 1968), ‚ÄúA powder prepared from dried roots is used in popular medicine as a cure for rabies and crushed leaves are used against mammary congestion; fresh leaves are employed in homeopathy. [...] Since this species is often confounded or identified with others of the genus, the reported data may also refer to [Alisma orientale or Alisma lanceolatum].‚Äù Indeed, Alisma is also known as mad-dog weed, as if it could be used to cure rabies. Do not confuse this with Scutellaria lateriflora (mad-dog skullcap), which is also sometimes called mad-dog weed. Alisma orientale is sometimes treated as a variety of this species (Alisma var. orientale). The rhizomes of A. orientale have been used as a traditional Chinese medicine, ze xie.

In the context of the history of the 20th century, the interwar period was the period between the end of the First World War on November 11, 1918 and the beginning of the Second World War on September 1, 1939. This period is also colloquially referred to as Between the Wars. Despite the relatively-short period of time, the period represented an era of significant changes worldwide. Petroleum-based energy production and associated mechanisation expanded dramatically leading to the Roaring Twenties, a period of economic prosperity and growth for the middle class in North America, Europe, Asia and many other parts of the world. Automobiles, electric lighting, radio broadcasts and more became common among populations in the developed world. The indulgences of the era subsequently were followed by the Great Depression, an unprecedented worldwide economic downturn that severely damaged many of the world's largest economies. Politically, the era coincided with the rise of communism, starting in Russia with the October Revolution and Russian Civil War, at the end of World War I, and ended with the rise of fascism, particularly in Germany and in Italy. China was in the midst of half- a-century of instability and the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China. The empires of Britain, France and others faced challenges as imperialism was increasingly viewed negatively in Europe, and independence movements emerged in many colonies; for example the south of Ireland became independent after much fighting. The Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian and German Empires were dismantled, and the Ottoman and German colonies were redistributed among the Allies, chiefly Britain and France. The western parts of the Russian Empire, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland became independent nations in their own right, and Bessarabia (now Moldova) chose to reunify with Romania. The Russian communists managed to regain control of the other East Slavic states, Central Asia and the Caucasus, forming the Soviet Union. Ireland was partitioned between the independent Irish Free State and the British-controlled Northern Ireland after the Irish Civil War in which the Free State fought against \\"anti-treaty\\" Irish republicans, who opposed partition. In the Middle East, Egypt and Iraq gained independence. During the Great Depression, countries in Latin America nationalised many foreign companies, mostly of which were American, in a bid to strengthen their own economies. The territorial ambitions of the Soviets, Japanese, Italians and Germans led to the expansion of their domains. The era ended in September 1939, the beginning of World War II.  Turmoil in Europe  A map of Europe in 1923 Following the Armistice of Compi√®gne on November 11, 1918 that ended World War I, the years 1918‚Äì24 were marked by turmoil as the Russian Civil War continued to rage on, and Eastern Europe struggled to recover from the devastation of the First World War and the destabilising effects of not just the collapse of the Russian Empire, but the destruction of the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Empire, as well. There were numerous new nations in Eastern Europe, some small in size, such as Lithuania or Latvia, and some larger, such as Poland and Yugoslavia. The United States gained dominance in world finance. Thus, when Germany could no longer afford war reparations to Britain, France and other former members of the Entente, the Americans came up with the Dawes Plan and Wall Street invested heavily in Germany, which repaid its reparations to nations that, in turn, used the dollars to pay off their war debts to Washington. By the middle of the decade, prosperity was widespread, with the second half of the decade known as the Roaring Twenties.  International relations  The important stages of interwar diplomacy and international relations included resolutions of wartime issues, such as reparations owed by Germany and boundaries; American involvement in European finances and disarmament projects; the expectations and failures of the League of Nations; the relationships of the new countries to the old; the distrustful relations of the Soviet Union to the capitalist world; peace and disarmament efforts; responses to the Great Depression starting in 1929; the collapse of world trade; the collapse of democratic regimes one by one; the growth of efforts at economic autarky; Japanese aggressiveness toward China, occupying large amounts of Chinese land, as well as border disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan, leading to multiple clashes along the Soviet and Japanese occupied Manchurian border; Fascist diplomacy, including the aggressive moves by Mussolini's Italy and Hitler's Germany; the Spanish Civil War; Italy's invasion and occupation of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in the Horn of Africa; the appeasement of Germany's expansionist moves against the German-speaking nation of Austria, the region inhabited by ethnic Germans called the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, the remilitarisation of the League of Nations demilitarised zone of the German Rhineland region, and the last, desperate stages of rearmament as the Second World War increasingly loomed. Disarmament was a very popular public policy. However, the League of Nations played little role in this effort, with the United States and Britain taking the lead. U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes sponsored the Washington Naval Conference of 1921 in determining how many capital ships each major country was allowed. The new allocations were actually followed and there were no naval races in the 1920s. Britain played a leading role in the 1927 Geneva Naval Conference and the 1930 London Conference that led to the London Naval Treaty, which added cruisers and submarines to the list of ship allocations. However the refusal of Japan, Germany, Italy and the USSR to go along with this led to the meaningless Second London Naval Treaty of 1936. Naval disarmament had collapsed and the issue became rearming for a war against Germany and Japan.  Roaring Twenties  The Roaring Twenties highlighted novel and highly visible social and cultural trends and innovations. These trends, made possible by sustained economic prosperity, were most visible in major cities like New York, Chicago, Paris, Berlin, and London. The Jazz Age began and Art Deco peaked. For women, knee-length skirts and dresses became socially acceptable, as did bobbed hair with a Marcel wave. The young women who pioneered these trends were called \\"flappers\\". Not all was new: ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional wartime passions in the United States, France, and Germany. The leftist revolutions in Finland, Poland, Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Spain were defeated by conservatives, but succeeded in Russia, which became the base for Soviet Communism. In Italy the fascists came to power under Mussolini after threatening a March on Rome in 1922. Most independent countries enacted women's suffrage in the interwar era, including Canada in 1917 (though Quebec held out longer), Britain in 1918, and the United States in 1920. There were a few major countries that held out until after the Second World War (such as France, Switzerland and Portugal). Leslie Hume argues: : The women's contribution to the war effort combined with failures of the previous systems' of Government made it more difficult than hitherto to maintain that women were, both by constitution and temperament, unfit to vote. If women could work in munitions factories, it seemed both ungrateful and illogical to deny them a place in the polling booth. But the vote was much more than simply a reward for war work; the point was that women's participation in the war helped to dispel the fears that surrounded women's entry into the public arena. In Europe, according to Derek Aldcroft and Steven Morewood, \\"Nearly all countries registered some economic progress in the 1920s and most of them managed to regain or surpass their pre-war income and production levels by the end of the decade.\\" The Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Greece did especially well, while Eastern Europe did poorly, due to the First World War and Russian Civil War. In advanced economies the prosperity reached middle class households and many in the working class with radio, automobiles, telephones, and electric lighting and appliances. There was unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. The media began to focus on celebrities, especially sports heroes and movie stars. Major cities built large sports stadiums for the fans, in addition to palatial cinemas. The mechanisation of agriculture continued apace, producing an expansion of output that lowered prices, and made many farm workers redundant. Often they moved to nearby industrial towns and cities.  Great Depression  The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic depression that took place after 1929. The timing varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. The depression originated in the United States and became worldwide news with the stock market crash of October 29, 1929 (known as Black Tuesday). Between 1929 and 1932, worldwide GDP fell by an estimated 15%. By comparison, worldwide GDP fell by less than 1% from 2008 to 2009 during the Great Recession. Some economies started to recover by the mid-1930s. However, in many countries, the negative effects of the Great Depression lasted until the beginning of World War II. The Great Depression had devastating effects in countries both rich and poor. Personal income, tax revenue, profits, and prices dropped, while international trade plunged by more than 50%. Unemployment in the U.S. rose to 25% and in some countries rose as high as 33%. Prices fell sharply, especially for mining and agricultural commodities. Business profits fell sharply as well, with a sharp reduction in new business starts. Cities all around the world were hit hard, especially those dependent on heavy industry. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming communities and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by about 60%. Facing plummeting demand with few alternative sources of jobs, areas dependent on primary sector industries such as mining and logging suffered the most. The Weimar Republic in Germany gave way to two episodes of political and economic turmoil, the first culminated in the German hyperinflation of 1923 and the failed Beer Hall Putsch of that same year. The second convulsion, brought on by the worldwide depression and Germany's disastrous monetary policies, resulted in the further rise of Nazism. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regard to China. = Fascism displaces democracy = Democracy and prosperity largely went together in the 1920s. Economic disaster led to a distrust in the effectiveness of democracy and its collapse in much of Europe and Latin America, including the Baltic and Balkan countries, Poland, Spain, and Portugal. Powerful expansionary anti-democratic regimes emerged in Italy, Japan, and Germany. While communism was tightly contained in the isolated Soviet Union, fascism took control of Italy in 1922; as the Great Depression worsened, fascism emerged victorious in Germany and in many other countries in Europe, it also played a major role in several countries in Latin America. Fascist parties sprang up, attuned to local right-wing traditions, but also possessing common features that typically included extreme militaristic nationalism, a desire for economic self-containment, threats and aggression toward neighbouring countries, oppression of minorities, a ridicule of democracy while using its techniques to mobilise an angry middle-class base, and a disgust with cultural liberalism. Fascists believed in power, violence, male superiority, and a \\"natural\\" hierarchy, often led by dictators such as Benito Mussolini or Adolf Hitler. Fascism in power meant that liberalism and human rights were discarded, and individual pursuits and values were subordinated to what the party decided was best. = Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39) = To one degree or another, Spain had been unstable politically for centuries, and in 1936-39 was wracked by one of the bloodiest civil wars of the 20th century. The real importance comes from outside countries. In Spain the conservative and Catholic elements and the army revolted against the newly elected government, and full-scale civil war erupted. Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany gave munitions and strong military units to the rebel Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco. The Republican (or \\"Loyalist\\") government, was on the defensive, but it received significant help from the Soviet Union. Led by Great Britain and France, and including the United States, most countries remained neutral and refused to provide armaments to either side. The powerful fear was that this localised conflict would escalate into a European conflagration that no one wanted. The Spanish Civil War was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the Nationalists won in 1939 by overwhelming the Republican forces. The Soviet Union provided armaments but never enough to equip the heterogeneous government militias and the \\"International Brigades\\" of outside far-left volunteers. The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted all the Communists and many socialists and liberals against Catholics, conservatives and fascists. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another great war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.  British Empire  The Second British Empire at its territorial peak in 1921 The changing world order that the war had brought about, in particular the growth of the United States and Japan as naval powers, and the rise of independence movements in India and Ireland, caused a major reassessment of British imperial policy. Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States. The issue of the empire's security was a serious concern in Britain, as it was vital to the British pride, its finance, and its trade- oriented economy. George V with the British and Dominion prime ministers at the 1926 Imperial Conference India strongly supported the Empire in the First World War. It expected a reward, but failed to get home rule as the British Raj kept control in British hands and feared another rebellion like that of 1857. The Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Mounting tension, particularly in the Punjab region, culminated in the Amritsar Massacre in 1919. Nationalism surged and centred in the Congress Party led by Mohandas Gandhi. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. ‚Äì 25 chapters; 845 pp Egypt had been under de facto British control since the 1880s, despite its nominal ownership by the Ottoman Empire. In 1922, it was granted formal independence, though it continued to be a client state following British guidance. Egypt joined the League of Nations. Egypt's King Faud and his son King Farouk, and their conservative allies, stayed in power with lavish lifestyles thanks to an informal alliance with Britain who would protect them from both secular and Muslim radicalism. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, gained official independence in 1932 when King Faisal agreed to British terms of a military alliance and an assured flow of oil. excerpt pp. 774‚Äì845 In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of Arabs as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency. The Dominions (Canada, Newfoundland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the Irish Free State) were self-governing and gained semi-independence in the World War, while Britain still controlled foreign policy and defence. The right of the Dominions to set their own foreign policy was recognised in 1923 and formalised by the 1931 Statute of Westminster. (Southern) Ireland effectively broke all ties with Britain in 1937, leaving the Commonwealth and becoming an independent republic.  French Empire  The French Empire during the interwar period. French census statistics from 1931 show an imperial population, outside of France itself, of 64.3 million people living on 11.9 million square kilometres. Of the total population, 39.1 million lived in Africa and 24.5 million lived in Asia; 700,000 lived in the Caribbean area or islands in the South Pacific. The largest colonies were Indochina with 21.5 million (in five separate colonies), Algeria with 6.6 million, Morocco, with 5.4 million, and West Africa with 14.6 million in nine colonies. The total includes 1.9 million Europeans, and 350,000 \\"assimilated\\" natives.Herbert Ingram Priestley, France overseas: a study of modern imperialism (1938) pp. 440‚Äì41. = Revolt in North Africa against Spain and France = The Berber independence leader Abd el-Krim (1882-1963) organised armed resistance against the Spanish and French for control of Morocco. The Spanish had faced unrest off and on from the 1890s, but in 1921, Spanish forces were massacred at the Battle of Annual. El-Krim founded an independent Rif Republic that operated until 1926, but had no international recognition. Eventually, France and Spain agreed to end the revolt. They sent in 200,000 soldiers, forcing el-Krim to surrender in 1926; he was exiled in the Pacific until 1947. Morocco calmed down, and became the base from which Spanish Nationalists would launch their rebellion against the Spanish Republic in 1936.  Germany  = Weimar Republic = The humiliating peace terms in the Treaty of Versailles provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime. The Treaty stripped Germany of all of its overseas colonies, of Alsace and Lorraine, and of predominantly Polish districts. The Allied armies occupied industrial sectors in western Germany including the Rhineland, and Germany was not allowed to have a real army, navy, or air force. Reparations were demanded, especially by France, involving shipments of raw materials, as well as annual payments. When Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to passive resistance: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The German government printed vast quantities of paper money, causing hyperinflation, which also damaged the French economy. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the hyperinflation caused many prudent savers to lose all the money they had saved. Weimar added new internal enemies every year, as anti-democratic Nazis, Nationalists, and Communists battled each other in the streets. See 1920s German inflation. Germany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new Soviet Union. Under the Treaty of Rapallo, Germany accorded the Soviet Union de jure recognition, and the two signatories mutually agreed to cancel all pre-war debts and renounced war claims. In October 1925 the Treaty of Locarno was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy, and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rhineland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the League of Nations in 1926. = Nazi era, 1933‚Äì39 = Hitler came to power in January 1933, and inaugurated an aggressive power designed to give Germany economic and political domination across central Europe. He did not attempt to recover the lost colonies. Until August 1939, the Nazis denounced Communists and the Soviet Union as the greatest enemy, along with the Jews.Richard J. Evans, The Coming of the Third Reich (2005) and Evans, The Third Reich in Power (2006). Axis cooperation in 1938. Hitler's diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the League of Nations, rejected the Versailles Treaty, and began to rearm. Retaking the Saar Basin in the aftermath of a plebiscite that favoured returning to Germany, Hitler's Germany remilitarised the Rhineland, formed an alliance with Mussolini's Italy, and sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War. Germany seized Austria, considered to be a German state, in 1938, and took over Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement with Britain and France. Forming a peace pact with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Germany invaded Poland after their refusal to cede Danzig in September 1939. Britain and France declared war and World War II began ‚Äì somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected or were ready for.Gerhard L. Weinberg, Hitler's foreign policy 1933‚Äì1939: The road to World War II. (2013), Originally published in two volumes. After establishing the \\"Rome-Berlin Axis\\" with Benito Mussolini, and signing the Anti-Comintern Pact with Japan ‚Äì which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937 ‚Äì Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered Vienna, he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation (Anschluss) of their country Austria to the German Reich. After Austria, Hitler turned to Czechoslovakia, where the 3.5 million- strong Sudeten German minority was demanding equal rights and self- government.Donald Cameron Watt, How war came: the immediate origins of the Second World War, 1938‚Äì1939 (1989).R.J. Overy, The Origins of the Second World War (2014). At the Munich Conference of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and French Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by Czechoslovakia. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smouldering quarrel between Slovaks and Czechs as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In the same month, he secured the return of Memel from Lithuania to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of appeasement towards Hitler had failed.  Italy  Ambitions of Fascist Italy in Europe in 1936. The map shows territories to become sovereign or dependency territory (in dark-green) and client states (in light-green). Maximum extent of Imperial Italy (pink areas denote territory captured during the Second World War) In 1922, the leader of the Italian Fascist movement, Benito Mussolini, was appointed Prime Minister of Italy after the March on Rome. Mussolini resolved the question of sovereignty over the Dodecanese at the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne after the , which formalised Italian administration of both Libya and the Dodecanese Islands, in return for a payment to Turkey, the successor state to the Ottoman Empire, though he failed in an attempt to extract a mandate of a portion of Iraq from Britain. The month following the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne, Mussolini ordered the invasion of the Greek island of Corfu after the Corfu incident. The Italian press supported the move, noting that Corfu had been a Venetian possession for four hundred years. The matter was taken by Greece to the League of Nations, where Mussolini was convinced by Britain to evacuate Italian troops, in return for reparations from Greece. The confrontation led Britain and Italy to resolve the question of Jubaland in 1924, which was merged into Italian Somaliland.Lowe, pp. 191‚Äì199 During the late 1920s, imperial expansion became an increasingly favoured theme in Mussolini's speeches. Amongst Mussolini's aims were that Italy had to become the dominant power in the Mediterranean that would be able to challenge France or Britain, as well as attain access to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Mussolini alleged that Italy required uncontested access to the world's oceans and shipping lanes to ensure its national sovereignty. This was elaborated on in a document he later drew up in 1939 called \\"The March to the Oceans\\", and included in the official records of a meeting of the Grand Council of Fascism. This text asserted that maritime position determined a nation's independence: countries with free access to the high seas were independent; while those who lacked this, were not. Italy, which only had access to an inland sea without French and British acquiescence, was only a \\"semi-independent nation\\", and alleged to be a \\"prisoner in the Mediterranean\\": In the Balkans, the Fascist regime claimed Dalmatia and held ambitions over Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, and Greece based on the precedent of previous Roman dominance in these regions. Dalmatia and Slovenia were to be directly annexed into Italy while the remainder of the Balkans was to be transformed into Italian client states. The regime also sought to establish protective patron-client relationships with Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. In both 1932 and 1935, Italy demanded a League of Nations mandate of the former German Cameroon and a free hand in Ethiopia from France in return for Italian support against Germany (see Stresa Front). This was refused by French Prime Minister √âdouard Herriot, who was not yet sufficiently worried about the prospect of a German resurgence. The failed resolution of the Abyssinia Crisis led to the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, in which Italy annexed Ethiopia to its empire. Italy's stance towards Spain shifted between the 1920s and the 1930s. The Fascist regime in the 1920s held deep antagonism towards Spain due to Miguel Primo de Rivera's pro-French foreign policy. In 1926, Mussolini began aiding the Catalan separatist movement, which was led by Francesc Maci√†, against the Spanish government. With the rise of the left-wing Republican government replacing the Spanish monarchy, Spanish monarchists and fascists repeatedly approached Italy for aid in overthrowing the Republican government, in which Italy agreed to support them in order to establish a pro- Italian government in Spain. In July 1936, Francisco Franco of the Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War requested Italian support against the ruling Republican faction, and guaranteed that, if Italy supported the Nationalists, \\"future relations would be more than friendly\\" and that Italian support \\"would have permitted the influence of Rome to prevail over that of Berlin in the future politics of Spain\\". Italy intervened in the civil war with the intention of occupying the Balearic Islands and creating a client state in Spain. Italy sought the control of the Balearic Islands due to its strategic position‚ÄîItaly could use the islands as a base to disrupt the lines of communication between France and its North African colonies and between British Gibraltar and Malta. After the victory by Franco and the Nationalists in the war, Allied intelligence was informed that Italy was pressuring Spain to permit an Italian occupation of the Balearic Islands. Italian newspaper in Tunisia that represented Italians living in the French protectorate of Tunisia. After Great Britain signed the Anglo-Italian Easter Accords in 1938, Mussolini and Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano issued demands for concessions in the Mediterranean by France, particularly regarding French Somaliland, Tunisia and the French-run Suez Canal. Three weeks later, Mussolini told Ciano that he intended for an Italian takeover of Albania. Mussolini professed that Italy would only be able to \\"breathe easily\\" if it had acquired a contiguous colonial domain in Africa from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans, and when ten million Italians had settled in them. In 1938, Italy demanded a sphere of influence in the Suez Canal in Egypt, specifically demanding that the French- dominated Suez Canal Company accept an Italian representative on its board of directors. Italy opposed the French monopoly over the Suez Canal because, under the French-dominated Suez Canal Company, all merchant traffic to the Italian East Africa colony was forced to pay tolls on entering the canal. Albanian Prime Minister and President Ahmet Zogu, who had, in 1928, proclaimed himself King of Albania, failed to create a stable state. Albanian society was deeply divided by religion and language, with a border dispute with Greece and an undeveloped, rural economy. In 1939, Italy invaded and annexed Albania as a separate kingdom in personal union with the Italian crown. Italy had long built strong links with the Albanian leadership and considered it firmly within its sphere of influence. Mussolini wanted a spectacular success over a smaller neighbour to match Germany's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia. Italian King Victor Emmanuel III took the Albanian crown, and a fascist government under Shefqet V√´rlaci was established.  Regional patterns  = Balkans = The Great Depression destabilised Romania. The early 1930s were marked by social unrest, high unemployment, and strikes. In several instances, the Romanian government violently repressed strikes and riots, notably the 1929 miners' strike in Valea Jiului and the strike in the Grivi»õa railroad workshops. In the mid-1930s, the Romanian economy recovered and the industry grew significantly, although about 80% of Romanians were still employed in agriculture. French economic and political influence was predominant in the early 1920s but then Germany became more dominant, especially in the 1930s. In Albania, Zog I introduced new civil codes, constitutional changes and attempted land reforms, the latter which was largely unsuccessful due to the inadequacy of the country's banking system that could not deal with advanced reformist transactions. Albania's reliance on Italy also grew as Italians exercised control over nearly every Albanian official through money and patronage, breeding a colonial-like mentality. Ethnic integration and assimilation was a major problem faced by the newly formed post-World War I Balkan states, which were compounded by historical differences. In Yugoslavia for instance, its most influential element was the pre-war Kingdom of Serbia but also integrated states like Slovenia and Croatia, which were part of the Austro-Hungarian empire and Kingdom of Hungary respectively. With new territories came varying legal systems, social structures and political structures. Social and economic development rates also varied as for example Slovenia and Croatia was far more advanced economically than Kosovo and Macedonia. Redistribution of land led to social instability, with estate seizures generally benefiting Slavic Christians. = Japanese Dominance in East Asia = The Japanese modelled their industrial economy closely on the most advanced European models. They started with textiles, railways, and shipping, expanding to electricity and machinery. The most serious weakness was a shortage of raw materials. Industry ran short of copper, and coal became a net importer. A deep flaw in the aggressive military strategy was a heavy dependence on imports including 100 percent of the aluminium, 85 percent of the iron ore, and especially 79 percent of the oil supplies. It was one thing to go to war with China or Russia, but quite another to be in conflict with the key suppliers, especially the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, of oil and iron. Japan joined the Allies of the First World War in order to make territorial gains. Together, with the British Empire, it divided up Germany's territories scattered in the Pacific and on the China coast; they did not amount to very much. The other Allies pushed back hard against Japan's efforts to dominate China through the Twenty-One Demands of 1915. Its occupation of Siberia proved unproductive. Japan's wartime diplomacy and limited military action had produced few results, and at the Paris Versailles peace conference. At the end of the war, Japan was frustrated in its ambitions. At the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, its demands for racial parity, and an increasing diplomatic isolation. The 1902 alliance with Britain was not renewed in 1922 because of heavy pressure on Britain from Canada and the United States. In the 1920s Japanese diplomacy was rooted in an largely liberal democratic political system, and favoured internationalism. By 1930, however, Japan was rapidly reversing itself, rejecting democracy at home, as the Army seized more and more power, and rejecting internationalism and liberalism. By the late 1930s it had joined the Axis military alliance with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. In 1930, the London disarmament conference angered the Japanese Army and Navy. Japan's navy demanded parity with the United States and Britain, but was rejected and the conference kept the 1921 ratios. Japan was required to scrap a capital ship. Extremists assassinated Japan's prime minister and the military took more power, leading to the rapid decline in democracy.  Japan seizes Manchuria  In September 1931, the Japanese Army‚Äîacting on its own without government approval‚Äîseized control of Manchuria, an anarchic area that China had not controlled in decades. It created the puppet government of Manchukuo. Britain and France effectively controlled the League of Nations, which issued the Lytton Report in 1932, saying that Japan had genuine grievances, but it acted illegally in seizing the entire province. Japan quit the League, Britain took no action. The US Secretary of State announces that it would not recognize Japan's conquest as legitimate. Germany welcomed Japan's actions. online  Towards the conquest of China  The civilian government in Tokyo tried to minimise the Army's aggression in Manchuria, and announced it was withdrawing. On the contrary, the Army completed the conquest of Manchuria, and the civilian cabinet resigned. The political parties were divided on the issue of military expansion. The new Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi tried to negotiate with China, but was assassinated in the May 15 Incident in 1932, which ushered in an era of nationalism led by the Imperial Japanese Army and supported by other right-wing societies. The IJA's nationalism ended civilian rule in Japan until after 1945. The Army, however, was itself divided into cliques and factions with different strategic viewpoints. One faction saw the Soviet Union as the main enemy, the other sought to build a mighty empire based in Manchuria and northern China. The Navy, while smaller and less influential, was also factionalised. Large-scale warfare, known as the Second Sino-Japanese War, began in August 1937, with naval and infantry attacks focused on Shanghai, which quickly spread to other major cities. There were numerous large-scale atrocities against Chinese civilians, such as the Nanjing Massacre in December 1937, with mass murder and mass rape. By 1939 military lines had stabilised, with Japan in control of almost all of the major Chinese cities and industrial areas. A puppet government was set up. In the U.S., government and public opinion‚Äîeven including those who were isolationist regarding Europe‚Äîwas resolutely opposed to Japan and gave strong support to China. Meanwhile, the Japanese Army fared badly in large battles with Soviet forces in Mongolia at the Battles of Khalkhin Gol in summer 1939. The USSR was too powerful. Tokyo and Moscow signed a nonaggression treaty in April 1941, as the militarists turned their attention to the European colonies to the south which had urgently-needed oil fields. = Latin America = The Great Depression posed a great challenge to the region. The collapse of the world economy meant that the demand for raw materials drastically declined, undermining many of the economies of Latin America. Intellectuals and government leaders in Latin America turned their backs on the older economic policies and turned toward import substitution industrialisation. The goal was to create self-sufficient economies, which would have their own industrial sectors and large middle classes and which would be immune to the ups and downs of the global economy. Despite the potential threats to United States commercial interests, the Roosevelt administration (1933‚Äì1945) understood that the United States could not wholly oppose import substitution. Roosevelt implemented a Good Neighbour policy and allowed the nationalisation of some American companies in Latin America. Mexican President L√°zaro C√°rdenas nationalised American oil companies, out of which he created Pemex. C√°rdenas also oversaw the redistribution of a quantity of land, fulfilling the hopes of many since the start of the Mexican Revolution. The Platt Amendment was also repealed, freeing Cuba from legal and official interference of the United States in its politics. The Second World War also brought the United States and most Latin American nations together, with Argentina the main hold out. During the interwar period, United States policy makers continued to be concerned over German influence in Latin America. Some analyst grossly exaggerated the influence of Germans in South America even after the First World War when German influence somewhat declined. As the influence of United States grew all-over the Americas Germany concentrated its foreign policy efforts in the Southern Cone countries where US influence was weaker and larger German communities were at place. The contrary ideals of indigenismo and hispanismo held sway among intellectuals in Spanish-speaking America during the interwar period. In Argentina the gaucho genre flourished. A rejection of \\"Western universalist\\" influences were in vogue across Latin America. This last tendency was in part inspired by the translation into Spanish of the book Decline of the West in 1923.  Sports  Sports became increasingly popular, drawing enthusiastic fans to large stadiums. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) worked to encourage Olympic ideals and participation. Following the 1922 Latin American Games in Rio de Janeiro, the IOC helped to establish national Olympic committees and prepare for future competition. In Brazil, however, sporting and political rivalries slowed progress as opposing factions fought for control of international sport. The 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris and the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam saw greatly increased participation from Latin American athletes. English and Scottish engineers had brought futebol (soccer) to Brazil in the late 19th century. The International Committee of the YMCA of North America and the Playground Association of America played major roles in training coaches. Across the globe after 1912, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) played the chief role in the transformation of association football into a global game, working with national and regional organisations, and setting up the rules and customs, and establishing championships such as the World Cup.

The defending team attempts to catch the die one-handed after it hits the table, but before it touches a non-table surface. The game typically consists of two two-player teams with each of the four players having a designated cup on the table, but can also be played one-vs-one. There are three distinct attributes which define a beer die thrower: offense, defense, and stamina. A good offensive player throws many legal throws and often will put pressure on the defense by throwing near the opponents cups and edge of the table. A good defensive player consistently catches routine throws, and often will snare \\"hot tosses\\". A player with good stamina is able to drink often over a period of many games without his or her game diminishing. When constructing a beer die team it is advantageous to bring different facets to the table. Basic rules A Solo cup The Beer Die League website specified the following rules for the game in February 2014, based on a crowdsourced project and research into the history of the game: *It is played on a standard sheet of plywood ( of at least thickness) placed on banquet tables, saw horses or similar objects between . The game uses a standard solo cup ( height, diameter). The official dice used for play is the standard Bicycle die, measuring . *The game is to be played seated, 2 vs. 2. *A cup full of water or beer is to be placed from the back, from the side, for each player (hand from back, fist from side). *The game is played to a particular end score, such as first to five, seven, eleven, or twelve points (win by 2, cap at seven) *The number 5 must be referred to as bizz, the number 7 must be referred to as buzz. *One player from each team will roll the die, the team rolling the highest number will be able to choose either side or first toss. *Players must tap the die before tossing to signal the impending throw. *The die must be thrown in such a manner that the opposing team does not see the thrower's palm upon release of the die. *The die must travel higher than from the ground. If the opposing team disputes the height, the shot does not count. *A point is awarded if the die hits the table and bounces off the defensive () edge of the table without being properly caught. *The defending team may catch the die to nullify potential points scored. The die must be caught with one hand (juggling is permitted) but must not be trapped between any surface or body part or a point is awarded. Once the die comes in contact with the floor or stops moving, the play is dead and a point is awarded. Leaving the chair to catch the die is permitted. Players may not reach over the plane of the table to catch the die. *If the die strikes the cup on a toss, this is a \\"plink\\" (also \\"body\\" or \\"ting\\"): the die is dead and no points can be awarded. *If the die is thrown into the opposing team‚Äôs cup, this is a \\"plunk\\", \\"sink\\" or \\"sploosh\\": the throwing team is awarded one point and the thrower is permitted to sign the table. Each additional plunk is awarded a tally under their name. *If a team shoots out of turn, the toss is negated and the team loses their next shot. *A designated \\"god\\" referee has a final say in disputes. =Drinking= When played as a drinking game, players are required to take drinks when certain events occur, or fail to occur. The Beer Die League website specifies that the following rules are used: *There are five drinks per cup (or \\"boat\\"). *All drinks must be completed as a team. *A player must drink 1/5th of a cup if: **They say the word five or seven. **Their toss misses the table completely. **Their toss stays on the table, without hitting the cup. **Their toss hits the ceiling. **Their team tosses the die out of turn. **The die strikes their cup (plink/body/ting). *If the die lands in a cup (plunk/sink/sploosh) that team must finish their drinks and roll the die out onto the table. If the die is a \\"bizz\\", the team must finish another full drink. Snappa The standing variant of beer die was originally developed from the drinking game Snappa. The variant known as Snappa is played seated, with a chair at each corner of the table. Players must throw the die the proper height and bounce it off the table through the opposing team‚Äôs cups. Should the opposing team drop the die, the throwing team gains one point. All scores in Snappa are worth one point. The winners are the first to seven points.  House Rules  In addition to the base rules of die, there are many house rules used by players all over the country. Many of these rules are localized to specific colleges or universities, and are shared between players from different schools during events such as tailgate parties. = Scoring variants = * Sinking: Some play that a die landing or bouncing into the opposition team's cup is worth 3 points. Furthermore, players at some universities qualify a sink as an automatic win, namely at social events such as dages in which there is a line of others waiting to play next. * Some play that a die that bounces and hits the opposing team's cup is worth a single point, with another point possible if the die falls to the ground without a catch. * Stanford Rules play that if a \\"plink\\" is not caught by the opposing team, it is worth two points. \\"Sinks\\" are also worth 3 points. * If a die lands on the opposite side on a regulation toss, then bounces backwards between the throwing team's cups before landing on the ground, the throwing team gets 2 points. * A self-sink is when a toss lands in the cup of one's own team. This counts as an automatic loss for the team that self-sunk. * A self sink leads to the self-sinker chugging the cup it landed in and refilling their beer, but no points are awarded and the game continues. = Other variants = *When the sum of both teams' scores is equal to the winning score, teams switch sides of the table. Example: If teams win with 12 points, halftime switch could happen when the score is 6-6, 7-5, 8-4, etc. *If there is not a fifth person nearby to act as \\"god\\" referee, stalemated arguments may be determined by repeating the toss that lead to the dispute. All players will respect the result of the re-toss. *If the die lands on the table showing a four, both sides are required to finish their drinks and flip their cup. If the defending side flips first, zero points are scored that turn. *If the die lands on the table with a \\"5\\" facing upward, everyone playing clinks cups and takes a drink. A variation of the rule mandates only the throwing team must finish their drink. When the teams both want to speed up their time til intoxication, they could add the \\"ground 5\\" rule, where even a 5 on the ground results in the throwing team finishing their drink. * 4, 5 or 6 (i.e. 5 give or take 1) leads to a drink. * When a 5 lands on the table, only the defending team must finish their drinks. * If the tosser notices his die will stay on the table, he may call out any number (rather than just a \\"5\\"), and if that is the number facing up when the die stops the defense must finish their drinks. * University of Redlands Rules - 2vs2, seated, die must be thrown at least half the height of the table (opposing team has full authority to call a toss \\"low\\" and the die is dead except for a sink), 5=\\"bizz\\" 7=\\"buzz\\" and may not be said during play of game otherwise team who said \\"five\\" or \\"seven\\" must drink rest of their cups. If a player's throw lands on the table and shows 5, that team must finish their cups. Die that bounces or rolls off the side of the table are dead. Sinkers require the sunk team to finish their drinks, but no points are awarded. If a die touches a cup and is not caught, that team takes one drink, however if the die is caught the drink reverts to the throwing team. Underhand toss is encouraged, however some flourish to tossing in an odd manner (such as throwing a grenade) may be acceptable. Die may bounce on walls/ceilings/etc and still be alive until touching the floor. Rules established during the 2000's in the Chi Sigma Chi and Kappa Sigma Sigma houses.

The most recent agreement, tentatively reached on January 6, 2013 after a labour dispute which cancelled 510 regular season games of the 2012‚Äì13 season, was ratified by the league's Board of Governors on January 9, 2013, as well as by the NHLPA membership three days later on January 12, 2013. As originally signed, the 2013 CBA was a 10-year deal, longest in NHL history, expiring after the 2021‚Äì22 season. On July 10, 2020, the NHL and NHLPA announced the extension of the CBA through the 2025‚Äì26 NHL season. History =1994‚Äì1995 lockout= The previous agreement was signed in 1995 following a lockout which shortened the 1994‚Äì95 NHL season to 48 games, a loss of 34 games from what had originally been an 82-game schedule. None of the games scheduled for the 1994 segment of the season was ever played, the lockout lasting until after the beginning of 1995. The collective bargaining agreement was initially to last for six seasons and be open to re-negotiation in 1998, but was eventually extended to last until September 15, 2004 (one day after the World Cup of Hockey final in Toronto). =2004‚Äì2005 lockout= On the expiration date of the old agreement, the NHL Board of Governors, representing ownership, met and unanimously decided that the 2004‚Äì05 NHL season would be delayed until a new collective bargaining agreement was in place. The owners' lockout of players began at 12:01 a.m. on September 16, 2004, the day most NHL training camps would have opened had the NHLPA and the NHL come to an agreement. By November 2004 it became apparent that the entire 2004‚Äì05 season was in jeopardy and supposedly \\"last-ditch\\" efforts were undertaken to avoid this, but little, if any, progress was seen during the last few months of 2004. The general consensus of many sportswriters and other knowledgeable observers was that, if the entire 2004‚Äì05 season were cancelled, the owners would attempt to open training camps in September 2005 for the 2005‚Äì06 NHL season using \\"replacement players,\\" who are either not members of the NHLPA or were willing to resign their memberships. On February 13, 2005, the U.S. Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service called a meeting between the two sides to negotiate a new deal. Three days later, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman officially cancelled the season. There was some hope that a season could have been salvaged, as hockey legends Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux, both now part-owners of NHL teams, brought the owners and players together for talks on February 19. However, the two sides failed to reach an agreement. Once the possibility of losing a second season to the dispute became real and the two sides realized that the dispute had alienated a large portion of the league's fan base, the league and the NHLPA resumed negotiations again in June 2005. Many pundits thought that the two sides wished to come to an agreement in early July, to coincide with the Canada Day (July 1) and United States Independence Day (July 4) holiday season. While July 4 passed without an agreement, momentum for a settlement was clearly building, with the two sides meeting daily between July 5 and July 13. Reportedly, the July 12 session lasted until 6 a.m. local time (1000 UTC) on July 13, at which time talks recessed for five hours. The sides announced a tentative agreement at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time (1630 UTC) on the 13th. It was said that they announced it on that day since it was the day before that year's MLB All-Star Game and no other sporting event in North America was taking place. The most important provision of the new collective bargaining agreement was an overall salary cap for all NHL teams, tied to league revenues. The agreement also phased in a reduced age for free agency, which would eventually give players unrestricted rights to negotiate with any team at age 27 or after 7 years of play in the NHL, whichever came first. On September 4, 2010, the NHL and NHLPA ratified an agreement to alter how the salary cap hit of long-term contracts would be calculated. The new salary cap accounting system would see two distinct changes. First, long-term contracts remain valid, but contracts that include years when a player aged 40 or older will only have the portion of their salaries before they turn 40 included in cap hit calculation. Second, if the average value of the three highest seasons is $5.75 million or more, then the value of years 36 through 39 will have a minimum cap \\"charge\\" of $1 million. These changes came shortly after Ilya Kovalchuk's contract extension with the New Jersey Devils was voided, due to \\"cap circumvention\\". Other long-term contracts, such as Marc Savard, Roberto Luongo and Marian Hossa, were grandfathered and their respective cap hits calculated under the old accounting system. However, any long-term contracts signed on September 5, 2010 would be subject to the new system. =2012‚Äì2013 lockout= The 2005‚Äì12 CBA expired on September 15, 2012. The 2011‚Äì12 NHL season was the final year of the then-current collective bargaining agreement, as the NHL Players' Association would no longer have the option to extend the current CBA. The players' association could not move the expiration date to June 30 in order to avoid a repeat of the lockout that cancelled the 2004‚Äì05 season. Just after 5 AM on January 6, 2013, after approximately 16 continuous hours of negotiating, a tentative deal was reached on a new collective bargaining agreement to end the lockout. It was ratified by the league's Board of Governors on January 9, as well as by the NHLPA membership three days later on January 12. The deal was also officially signed that day. =2013 CBA= =Present status= The NHL paused play in its 2019-20 season on March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2013 CBA would have expired on September 15, 2022.. On July 10, 2020, the NHL and NHLPA announced the extension of the CBA through the 2025-26 NHL season.. Various elements of the \\"Return to Play\\" plan were announced the same day.

An Agnostic Reader, collecting pieces by Isaac Asimov, John William Draper, Albert Einstein, Frederic Harrison, Thomas Henry Huxley, Robert Ingersoll, Corliss Lamont, Arthur Schopenhauer and Edward Westermarck, was published in 2007. Joshi published God's Defenders: What They Believe and Why They Are Wrong (2003), an anti-religious polemic against various writers including C. S. Lewis, G.K. Chesterton, T.S. Eliot, William F. Buckley, Jr., William James, Stephen L. Carter, Annie Dillard, Reynolds Price, Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross, Guenter Lewy, Neale Donald Walsch and Jerry Falwell. It is dedicated to theologian Robert M.

Buckley, Jr., Russell Kirk, David and Rush Limbaugh, Ann Coulter, Phyllis Schlafly, William Bennett, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Irving Kristol and William Kristol, arguing that Americans have become steadily more liberal. In 1987, Joshi became the fifth Official Editor of the Esoteric Order of Dagon. He has continued to be the OE of this amateur press association for upwards of 30 years. Joshi has edited Lovecraft Studies (1979‚Äì2001) and Studies in Weird Fiction (1986‚Äì2005), both published by Necronomicon Press; and Studies in the Fantastic (2008‚Äì09), published by the University of Tampa Press. He is editor of Weird Fiction Review (Centipede Press; 2010), and the Hippocampus Press journals Spectral Realms (from 2014); Lovecraft Annual (from 2007); Nemesis (from 2016). He was formerly co-editor of Dead Reckonings (from 2007). In 2011, Joshi became editor-in-chief of The American Rationalist magazine, which he edited for some years before changes at the magazine resulted in the discontinuation of his involvement. Personal life Joshi, born in Puna, India, emigrated with his family to the U.S.A at the age of four. He was raised (primarily by his mother, an academic) in Illinois and Indiana, while his father (also an academic) remained in India, though his father eventually joined the family in the States. Joshi discovered the work of Lovecraft at age 13 in a public library in Muncie, Indiana. He also read L. Sprague de Camp's biography of Lovecraft, Lovecraft: A Biography, on publication in 1975, and began thereafter to devote himself to Lovecraft. This devotion led him to decline offers from Yale and Harvard so that he could attend Brown University. He received a B.A. (1980) and M.A. (1982) in classics. After graduating, he undertook additional graduate school at Princeton University, from 1982 to 1984. He then worked in New York as a senior editor at Chelsea House Publishers under the chief editorship of Harold Bloom. Currently, he lives in Seattle, Washington. Joshi married Leslie Gary Boba on September 1, 2001. They divorced in December 2010. He married again to Mary Krawczak Wilson in 2014. In August 2014, Joshi opposed the campaign to change the World Fantasy Award statuette from a bust of Lovecraft to one of African-American author Octavia Butler.Laura Miller, It‚Äôs OK to admit that H. P. Lovecraft was racist, Salon, September 12, 2014. As a person of colour, Joshi has been an ardent defender of Lovecraft's reputation and of the necessity to hold a balanced perspective on Lovecraft's racist attitudes given the general tenor of social attitudes during the times in which Lovecraft lived. Joshi returned his several World Fantasy Awards in protest at the decision to no longer utilise Gahan Wilson's statuette of Lovecraft as the award. The World Fantasy Award has since been changed to one of a leafless tree in front of a moon in bronze designed by sculptor Vincent Villafranca.  Notable Publications =Books= *H. P.

Dipsomania is a historical term describing a medical condition involving an uncontrollable craving for alcohol. In the 19th century, the term dipsomania was used to refer to a variety of alcohol-related problems, most of which are known today as alcoholism. Dipsomania is occasionally still used to describe a particular condition of periodic, compulsive bouts of alcohol intake. The idea of dipsomania is important for its historical role in promoting a disease theory of chronic drunkenness. The word comes from Greek dipso (= thirst) and mania. It is still mentioned in the WHO ICD-10 classification as an alternative description for Alcohol Dependence Syndrome, episodic use F10.26.  History  The term was coined by the German physician Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland in 1819, when, in a preface to an influential book by German-Russian doctor C. von Br√ºhl-Cramer,Hasso Spode: Die Macht der Trunkenheit. Sozial- und Kulturgeschichte des Alkohols, Opladen 1993, pp. 125ff. he translated Br√ºhl-Cramer's term \\"trunksucht\\" as \\"dipsomania\\". Peters, Uwe Henrik. Lexikon Psychiatrie, Psychotherapie, Medizinische Psychologie. Dipsomania entry at Google Books. Br√ºhl-Cramer classified dipsomania in terms of continuous, remittent, intermittent, periodic and mixed forms, and in his book he discussed its cause, pathogenesis, sequelae, and treatment options, all influenced by prevailing ideas about the laws of chemistry and concepts of excitability.Wiley.com journal Due to the influence of Br√ºhl-Cramer's pioneering work, dipsomania became popular in medical circles throughout the 19th century.NLA record Political scientist Mariana Valverde describes dipsomania as \\"the most medical\\" of the many terms used to describe habitual drunkenness in the 19th century.Tracy, Sarah W. (2005). Alcoholism in America: From Reconstruction to Prohibition, Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, p.31. Along with terms such as \\"inebriety\\", the idea of dipsomania was used as part of an effort of medical professionals and reformers to change attitudes about habitual drunkenness from being a criminally punishable vice to being a medically treatable disease. As historian Roy MacLeod wrote about this dipsomania reform movement, it \\"illuminates certain features of the gradual transformation taking place in national attitudes towards the prevention and cure of social illnesses during the last quarter of the 19th century.\\" Although dipsomania was used in a variety of somewhat contradictory ways by different individuals, by the late 19th century the term was usually used to describe a periodic or acute condition, in contrast to chronic drunkenness.Dipsomania entry at Psychoanalysis Encyclopedia In his 1893 book Clinical Lessons on Mental Diseases: The Mental State of Dipsomania, Magnan characterized dipsomania as a crisis lasting from one day to two weeks, and consisting of a rapid and huge ingestion of alcohol or whatever other strong, excitatory liquid was available. Magnan further described dipsomania as solitary alcohol abuse, with loss of all other interests, and these crises recurred at indeterminate intervals, separated by periods when the subject was generally sober. Similarly, in 1892 the influential English physician and mental health expert Daniel Hack Tuke defined dipsomania as a syndrome involving \\"an irresistible obsession and impulse to drink, coming on in attacks, during which the patients are in a condition of impotence of will and manifest great anguish.\\" Tuke clarifies that dipsomania can be distinguished from was at the time considered alcoholism by six key factors. First, \\"an alcoholic patient becomes insane because he drinks; a dipsomaniac is insane before he commences to drink.\\" Second,\\"alcoholism is an intoxication which has as its cause alcohol; dipsomania has its cause in a defective mental condition, and alcohol is but a secondary factor, which may be replaced by any other poison, leaving to the syndrome all its psychological characters.\\" Third, \\"dipsomania proceeds in paroxysmal attacks, and the appetite for strong drink is absent during the intervals between the attacks. Alcoholism has no definite course.\\" Fourth, \\"a dipsomaniac satisfies a pathological and imperious want; he does not like alcohol, and takes it against his will,\\" whereas \\"an alcoholic individual has no actual want; he only obeys a vice, a proclivity, and an alteration of his moral sense.\\" Fifth, a dipsomaniac is conscious and ashamed of his condition, whereas an alcoholic is sometimes unaware of, but more often indifferent to it. Finally, he concluded that \\"dipsomania is a syndrome, always identical with itself, whilst alcoholism is an intoxication varying much in its clinical symptoms.\\" Over time, the term dipsomania became less common, replaced by newer ideas and terms concerning chronic and acute drunkenness and alcoholism. = Examples in fiction = * Sebastian Flyte, a character from the novel Brideshead Revisited by Evelyn Waugh, who sarcastically describes himself as a dipsomaniac * James O.

It is also used as a form of address for men in general or to refer to those named James. Sunny Jim and Force cereal The character on boxes of Force cereal was created in the United States in 1902 by writer Minnie Maud Hanff and artist Dorothy Ficken, initially for an advertising campaign. Rather than selling the benefits of eating wheat, which Hanff assumed customers already knew, her copy for the original advertisements told stories in verse, such as this one: :Jim Dumps was a most unfriendly man, :Who lived his life on the hermit plan; :In his gloomy way he'd gone through life, :And made the most of woe and strife; :Till Force one day was served to him :Since then they've called him \\"Sunny Jim.\\" The advertisements featured slogans such as \\"Better than a Vacation\\" and \\"A Different Food for Indifferent Appetites.\\" Other verses included: :Whatever you say, wherever you've been, :You can't beat the cereal, that raised Sunny Jim! and :High o'er the fence leaps Sunny Jim, :Force is the food that raises him This last rhyme became a familiar catchphrase. Also used was the slogan \\"When skies are grey and times are grim, wake up and smile with Sunny Jim\\", which appeared on advertising coins. The campaign was wildly successful at promoting the character of Sunny Jim. Printer's Ink stated September 17, 1902 that \\"No current novel or play is so universally popular. He is as well-known as President Roosevelt or J. Pierpont Morgan.\\" However, the cereal company turned its advertising account over to a different firm, which did not approve of humor in advertising and more or less abandoned the campaign. In the United States, Force followed a convoluted path involving many corporate mergers. The last owner stopped producing the cereal in 1983. Both the cereal and Sunny Jim had greater success in the United Kingdom, where Force cereal was available until 2013https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/cereals/force-cereal-axed- after-112-years/235914.article, and the box still featured a picture of Sunny Jim. Sunny Jim Peanut Butter The brand of peanut butter known as Sunny Jim was manufactured in Seattle, Washington, by the Pacific Standard Foods company. The company was founded by Germanus Wilhelm Firnstahl in 1921 after he moved to Seattle from Wisconsin and bought a peanut roaster. Firnstahl based the apple-cheeked character seen on the jars on his son, Lowell, after taking photos of all his children and selecting the best photograph as model (allegedly because Lowell was the only child with all his teeth at the time).Article from The Bulletin, 4 October 1977. Reproduced on Vintage Peanut Butter Jars, Glasses, Ephemera & Sometimes Jelly Too. Accessed 28 June 2020. During the 1950s the brand accounted for nearly a third of all peanut butter sold in the Seattle area. The company was sold in 1979 for $3 million to the Bristol Bay Native Corp. A large sign on the factory building made the \\"Sunny Jim building\\" on Airport Way South a familiar landmark to motorists passing on nearby Interstate 5 which Firnstahl had purchased during the Great Depression. In 1997, there was a fire at this plant (by then owned by the city of Seattle) which destroyed the sign and a portion of the building.\\"Fire Destroys I-5 Landmark -- Warehouse That Housed Sunny Jim Plant Burns\\" by Leyla Kokmen, Dee Norton, Tyrone Beason, and Dave Birkland; Seattle Times. 21 February 1997.

The Division also manages the Ocean Systems Test and Evaluation Program (OSTEP) and its associated test facilities. The Division develops new oceanographic measurement systems and techniques to improve the safety of marine navigation. The Division: develops and issues standard operating procedures, project instructions, and manuals, to guide the operation and maintenance of CO-OPS oceanographic and meteorological measurement systems; prepares measurement requirements (based on tidal zoning) for hydrographic or photogrammetric field surveys, and to support other NOS requirements needs for water level and current information; prepares and monitors interagency agreements, technology transfer agreements and work plans; prepares and administers contracts; provides technical assistance and guidance to other countries, agencies, and the public in the establishment and operation of water level and current measurement stations; and develops/integrates measurement and telemetry systems needed to support CO-OPS activities. National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science The National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) provides research, scientific information and tools to help balance the nation's ecological, social and economic goals. The research and tools provided are central to addressing coastal issues raised in legislation and NOAA's priorities. NCCOS was formed within the National Ocean Service (NOS) in March 1999 as the focal point for coastal ocean science. Research areas and strategy were selected in response to Federal legislation, stakeholder input, and in concert with scientific expertise and capabilities. NCCOS has five centers with specific capabilities and research expertise in coastal and ocean issues. Three of the centers are dedicated research laboratories, another conducts research through analyses of field data, and one funds research with competitive grants. =Center for Coastal Environmental Health and Biomolecular Research (CCEHBR)CCEHBR Home Page= Answers questions about the impacts of environmental stress and change on the function ecosystems and health of coastal resources and people. =Center for Coastal Fisheries and Habitat Research (CCFHR) CCFHR Home Page= Conducts research on the effects of coastal habitat change and restoration on living marine resources such as seagrasses, marshes, reefs, and fish. =Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment (CCMA)CCMA Home Page= Conducts field research and data analysis to support marine resource management at local, regional, and national levels. =Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research (CSCOR)CSCOR Home Page= Administers NCCOS Extramural Research - a portfolio of 11 programs consisting of 73 multi-year awards held by over 370 university, state and government scientists and managers. =Cooperative Oxford Laboratory (COL)COL Home Page= The Cooperative Oxford Laboratory (COL) research mission is to combine the unique scientific, response, and management capabilities of NOAA, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and U.S. Coast Guard to identify and evaluate actions and policies that will protect, restore, and secure the health of the Chesapeake Bay and other threatened coastal marine ecosystems. =Hollings Marine Laboratory (HML)HML Home Page= The Hollings Marine Laboratory studies the complex interaction between marine environments, aquatic organisms and their connections to human health. The research required to address the interactions requires an interdisciplinary approach that our partnership fosters. Office of Coast Survey Provides navigation products and services that ensure safe and efficient maritime commerce on America's oceans and coastal waters, and in the Great Lakes. OCS consists of the following offices: * Marine Chart Division * Hydrographic Surveys Division * Navigation Services Division * Coast Survey Development Lab Office for Coastal Management Established in 2014 when NOAA combined two offices: the Coastal Services Center and the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management. In addition to implementing specific initiatives, a top priority for NOAA's Office for Coastal Management is to unify efforts to make communities more resilient. Many organizations are involved, including the private sector, nonprofits, the scientific community, and all levels of government. The Office for Coastal Management works to be a unifying force in these efforts, providing unbiased NOAA data and tools and providing opportunities for the community to come together to define common goals and find ways to work smarter by working together. Issues run the gamut from protecting endangered species to erosion to generating better building codes for storm-resistant buildings. The OCM has four programs: =Coastal Zone Management= The National Coastal Zone Management Program comprehensively addresses the nation's coastal issues through a voluntary partnership between the federal government and coastal and Great Lakes states and territories. Authorized by the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972, the program provides the basis for protecting, restoring, and responsibly developing our nation's diverse coastal communities and resources. Currently 34 coastal states participate. While state partners must follow basic requirements, the program also gives states the flexibility to design unique programs that best address their coastal challenges and regulations. By leveraging both federal and state expertise and resources, the program strengthens the capabilities of each to address coastal issues.Coastal Zone Management =Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP)= NOAA's Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) is a cross-cutting program that brings together expertise from a wide array of NOAA programs and offices in the National Ocean Service (NOS), National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research (OAR), and the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). The CRCP was established in 2000 to help fulfill NOAA's responsibilities under the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 (CRCA) and the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force (established by Presidential Executive Order 13089 on Coral Reef Protection). The mission of the CRCP is to protect, conserve, and restore coral reef resources by maintaining healthy ecosystem function. CRCP focuses on four main pillars of work: increase resilience to climate change, reduce land-based sources of pollution, improve fisheries' sustainability, and restore viable coral populations. In strong partnership with local managers, CRCP addresses strategic coral reef management needs in a targeted, cost-effective, and efficient manner. CRCP funds and equips reef conservation activities by NOAA and its partners in the seven U.S. states and jurisdictions containing coral reefs (American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands), uninhabited islands including the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and Pacific Remote Island Areas, and the Pacific Freely Associated States (Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Palau).Coral Reef Conservation Program CRCP supports multiple cross-cutting activities and associated products including the National Coral Reef Monitoring ProgramNational Coral Reef Monitoring Program and Coral Reef Watch.NOAA Coral Reef Watch =Digital Coast= This NOAA-sponsored website is focused on helping communities address coastal issues and has become one of the most-used resources in the coastal management community. The dynamic Digital Coast Partnership, whose members represent the website's primary user groups, keeps the effort focused on customer needs.Digital Coast =National Estuarine Research Reserves= The National Estuarine Research Reserve System is a network of 28 coastal sites designated to protect and study estuarine systems. Established through the Coastal Zone Management Act, the reserves represent a partnership program between NOAA and the coastal states. NOAA provides funding and national guidance, and each site is managed on a daily basis by a lead state agency or university with input from local partners. Office of National Geodetic Survey The Office of National Geodetic Survey (NGS) provides the framework for all positioning activities in the nation. The foundational elements - latitude, longitude, elevation, shoreline information and their changes over time - contribute to informed decision making and impact a wide range of important activities including mapping and charting, navigation, flood risk determination, transportation, land use and ecosystem management. NGS' authoritative spatial data, models, and tools are vital for the protection and management of natural and manmade resources and support the economic prosperity and environmental health of the nation. The NGS consists of six divisions: * Geodetic Services: provides a direct relationship between NGS and its customers through the state advisor program, geodetic equipment testing and evaluation, product evaluation, marketing, distribution, and various training programs. * Spatial Reference Systems: maintains the Continuously Operating Reference Station (CORS) network and plans, coordinates and provides technical guidance for geodetic field projects and products required to preserve and develop the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS). * Remote Sensing: involves all aspects of airport charting and shoreline mapping using traditional methods while exploring more efficient technologies to complement current practices. * Observations & Analysis: conducts geodetic surveys to support the National Spatial Reference System, the production of airport obstruction charts, the location of aeronautical aids to navigation, and the production of coastal maps, charts, and special products in the coastal zone. The Division also conducts field surveys required to support photogrammetric and hydrographic surveys. * Systems Development: administers the central processing units, disk and storage systems, telecommunications and network systems, and peripheral input and output systems for NGS. The Division also researches, designs, develops, implements, and conveys the operational use of computer-assisted systems for the acquisition, reduction, analyses, display, and transmission of geodetic, photogrammetric, and remote sensing source data. * Geosciences Research: coordinates the research,development and management of new geodetic data products. The Division also designs and programs scientific and geodetic software applications and procedures.NGS Geosciences Research Division Office of National Marine Sanctuaries The Office of National Marine Sanctuaries serves as the trustee for a network of underwater parks encompassing more than 170,000 square miles of marine and Great Lakes waters from Washington state to the Florida Keys, and from Lake Huron to American Samoa. The network includes a system of 13 national marine sanctuaries and PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea and Rose Atoll Marine National Monuments. These monuments are: * Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary * Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary * Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary * Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary * Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary * PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument * National Marine Sanctuary of American Samoa * Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary * Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary * Monitor National Marine Sanctuary *Mallows Bay- Potomac River National Marine Sanctuary * Wisconsin - Lake Michigan (in designation) *Lake Ontario (proposed) * Gray's Reef National Marine Sanctuary * Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary * Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary *Rose Atoll Marine National Monument Office of Response and Restoration NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R;) is a center of expertise in preparing for, evaluating, and responding to threats to coastal environments, including oil and chemical spills, releases from hazardous waste sites, and marine debris. To fulfill its mission of protecting and restoring NOAA trust resources, the Office of Response and Restoration: * Provides scientific and technical support to prepare for and respond to oil and chemical releases. * Determines damage to natural resources from these releases. * Protects and restores marine and coastal ecosystems, including coral reefs. * Works with communities to address critical local and regional coastal challenges. OR&R; has three divisions: =Emergency Response Division= The Emergency Response Division (ERD) of NOAA's Office of Response and Restoration (OR&R;) provides scientific expertise to support an incident response. Under the National Contingency Plan, NOAA has responsibility for providing scientific support to the Federal On-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) for oil and hazardous material spills. To support this mandate, ERD provides 24-hour, 7 day a week response to spill events. Find out more about ERD's work with oil and chemical spills.Emergency Response Division =Assessment and Restoration Division= The Assessment and Restoration Division (ARD), formerly Coastal Protection and Restoration Division (CPRD), is responsible for evaluating and restoring coastal and estuarine habitats damaged by hazardous waste releases, oil spills, and vessel groundings. To fully accomplish this mission, ARD joined with NOAA's General Counsel for Natural Resources and Office of Habitat Conservation to create the Damage Assessment, Remediation and Restoration Program (DARRP). This successful NOAA partnership tackles the challenges of environmental damages to ensure marine natural resources are protected and restored. The Assessment and Restoration Division comprises NOAA biologists, toxicologists, ecologists, policy analysts, information specialists, attorneys, geologists, environmental engineers, and economists. Together, they help assess ecological risk and environmental and economic injury from contamination and ship groundings. In particular, ARD has developed specific expertise in aquatic risk assessment techniques, contaminated sediment issues, and data interpretation.Assessment and Restoration Division The ARD publishes the Screening Quick Reference Tables (SQuiRT cards), for rapid evaluation of water, sediment and soil contamination. =Marine Debris Division= Since 2005, the NOAA Marine Debris Program has served as a centralized program within NOAA, coordinating, strengthening, and promoting marine debris activities within the agency and among its partners and the public. The NOAA Marine Debris Program undertakes national and international efforts focused on researching, reducing, and preventing debris in the marine environment. The program continues to support and work closely with various partners across the U.S. to fulfill its mission.Marine Debris Program Integrated Ocean Observing System Program The Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) is a national-regional partnership working to provide new tools and forecasts to improve safety, enhance the economy, and protect our environment. Integrated ocean information is now available in near real time, as well as retrospectively. Easier and better access to this information is improving our ability to understand and predict coastal events - such as storms, wave heights, and sea level change. Such knowledge is needed for everything from retail to development planning.

Devised by Stephen Lambert of RDF Media, the programme's original concept was \\"a modern-day Pygmalion\\", referring to the George Bernard Shaw play in which flower girl Eliza Doolittle is trained to appear like an aristocrat. History The programme debuted in 2000 with a run of only two episodes, one of which featured Alex Geikie, a well-spoken gay man, being taught to \\"fake it\\" as a London club bouncer. The second episode was a straight use of the Pygmalion concept as a young working-class woman, Lisa Dickinson-Grey, was taught how to behave in high society by Tim Walker, the Daily Telegraph's Mandrake diarist. Since the show began being sold abroad, these episodes have picked up the titles \\"Alex The Animal\\" and \\"Lady Lisa\\". The series ended on Boxing Day 2006 with faker Sharon Pallister transforming from cleaner to burlesque performer and featured Wayne Sleep, Miss Immodesty Blaize and Dita von Teese. The first two episodes were well received by critics and a further seven episodes followed in 2001, ten in 2002, five in 2003, thirteen in 2004, three T4 specials, and a final feature- length show in 2005. The programme had always fared well in the ratings, with an average audience of just over two million a strong showing for Channel 4. Format The programme shared much with earlier British TV shows such as In At The Deep End and Jobs For The Boys/Girls, and more recently the children's show Bring It On, all of which featured TV presenters or other celebrities learning other trades, but Faking It was the first that successfully used members of the public in the role. Its basic format was that a member of the public lived with and trained with an expert for four weeks and then took part in a contest against experienced participants in whatever activity they have learned. A panel of expert judges then gave their verdict on which participant was the \\"faker\\". Ostensibly, success meant fooling a majority of the judges, though there was no prize for success and the real point of the show was the experience that the fakers received over the course of the month's filming. Success and controversy Among the most acclaimed episodes were cellist Sian Evans learning to be a club DJ, burger-van proprietor Ed Devlin training with Gordon Ramsay to become a cordon bleu chef, former naval petty officer being trained as a drag artist and city lawyer George LuBega learning the art of the garage MC. In 2003, participant Laura-Jane Foley claimed she had been misrepresented by the show. A former choirgirl, she had taken part in an episode in which she was taught how to be the front woman for a punk rock band. The episode in question had run into trouble before it even aired, with regular sponsors Smirnoff refusing to be associated with its scenes of \\"irresponsible drinking\\", but apart from an article in the Cambridge university newspaper Varsity, Foley did not pursue the matter further. She is, however, the only participant to date not to co-operate with Channel 4 in pre- and post-publicity for the show.P13 varsity.co.uk The show has proven hugely successful in the UK and elsewhere, twice winning the BAFTA award for Best Factual Feature. A 2002 episode in which punk singer Chris Sweeney was trained as an orchestral conductor won the Golden Rose of Montreux in 2003 as well as the Press Prize at the same festival. The chef episode won an International Emmy Award.

He was elevated to the position when Governor James B. Frazier resigned, and, as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate, he was the first in the line of succession. He failed to win his party's nomination for a second term, and returned to the state senate, where he remained until 1911. Cox also served as a county judge, city attorney, and local postmaster, and spent two terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives. The Tennessee state flag was adopted during Cox's term as governor.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 243‚Äì247. Early life Cox was born in Sullivan County, Tennessee, the son of Henry and Martha (Smith) Cox. His father was a Confederate soldier during the Civil War, and was killed in fighting in 1863. To help his family, young John worked for several years as a farm laborer before becoming a rural mail carrier at the age of 16. Two years later, he was appointed Road Commissioner of Sullivan County. He served as a justice of the peace in the late 1870s. Cox was educated at field schools in Sullivan County, and attended Jefferson Academy in Blountville for at least one term. He began reading law with Judge William V. Deaderick (his future father-in-law) in 1880, and was admitted to the bar shortly afterward. He practiced in Blountville for several years before being elected Judge of Sullivan County in 1886. In 1889, Cox moved to Bristol, where he served as a district attorney. He was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1892, but served only one term.John Isaac Cox Papers Finding Aid ‚Äì Biographical Sketch , Tennessee State Library and Archives, 2000. Retrieved: November 29, 2012. He was elected to the state senate in 1900. Governor In early 1905, following his reelection to a third state senate term, Cox was elevated to Speaker of that body, which in Tennessee is the governor's designated successor. On March 9, U.S. Senator William B. Bate died in office, prompting a scramble among potential candidates for his vacant senate seat. Former Governor Robert Love Taylor had for years tried unsuccessfully to get elected to the Senate, and considered himself next in line should one of the two seats become vacant. Governor James B. Frazier, however, also wanted the seat, and quickly convened a special session of the General Assembly to have himself elected before Taylor could return from a speaking tour. On March 21, Frazier resigned and headed to Washington, D.C., to take his seat in the Senate, and Cox, as the constitutional successor, was sworn in as governor. Taylor and his supporters were furious at Frazier's actions, and accused Cox and the state's other U.S. senator, Edward W. Carmack, of conspiring with Frazier. Fearing a split in the party, state Democrats allowed Taylor to challenge Carmack in a statewide primary in 1906 (this was the first Senate primary in state history, as U.S. senators were chosen by state legislatures prior to the adoption of the 17th Amendment), which Taylor won. Bitterness toward Frazier and skepticism of Cox remained, however. Portrait of Governor Cox by Lloyd Branson Cox continued Frazier's policies and made few administrative changes.Gentry Richard McGee, A History of Tennessee from 1663 to 1914: For Use In Schools (American Book Company, 1911), pp. 268‚Äì270. He implemented quarantines in an effort to eradicate yellow fever, which had long plagued the swampy western part of the state, and called up the state guard to protect strikebreakers at a coal mine in Tracy City during a miners' strike in 1905. He also dealt with rampant prison rioting, and increased pensions for Confederate veterans and spouses. In April 1905, a few weeks after Cox took office, the current Flag of Tennessee, designed by Colonel LeRoy Reeves of Johnson City, was adopted. In the gubernatorial race of 1906, Malcolm R. Patterson of Memphis challenged Cox for the Democratic Party's nomination. He quickly gained the support of a number of party leaders, including former governors Robert Love Taylor and Benton McMillin, who blamed Cox for engineering Frazier's controversial election in the General Assembly. At the party's convention in late May, Patterson and Cox engaged in a fierce battle for delegates, and though it was close, a rule change allowed Patterson to claim all delegates from Davidson County, and he was declared the nominee on June 1. Cox refused to support Patterson in the general election, and the two remained at odds in subsequent months. In 1908, Colonel Duncan Cooper, a Patterson advisor, arranged for a meeting between Cox and Patterson that helped mend the ties between the two. Ex-Senator Carmack, a Patterson opponent, published a newspaper article in October 1908 ruthlessly mocking Cooper for arranging the meeting. On November 8, Carmack was shot and killed by Cooper's son, Robin, in downtown Nashville.\\"Carmack Faction Aims to Impeach Governor,\\" New York Times, November 12, 1912. Later life Cox remained in the state senate until 1911. He served another term as a state representative from 1913 until 1915, and was the postmaster of Bristol from 1914 to 1922.Governor John I. Cox Obiturary, Bristol Herald-Courier, September 6, 1946. Retrieved via TNGenWeb.org, November 29, 2012. He afterward retired to his farm in the Holston Hills section of Bristol, but continued stumping for Democratic Party politicians. In the 1930s, he campaigned for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and supported the creation of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Cox died on September 5, 1946, at George Ben Johnston Hospital in Abingdon, Virginia, following a long struggle with kidney illness. His was 90 years and 9 months old, becoming the longest-lived governor in Tennessee history (Tom Rye also lived to 90, but was shy by 6 months of tying Cox). In April 2018, Winfield Dunn (b. July 1927) broke Cox's longevity record and as of July 2019, has surpassed his 92nd birthday to become the longest-lived governor in Tennessee history. Family Cox married Laura Deaderick, daughter of his law mentor, William Deaderick, in 1882. They had one son, William, before she died in 1885. In 1889, Cox married Lorena Butler. They had two children, Matthew and Mary. Lorena Butler was a cousin of the Taylor brothers, Robert Love and Alf, who both also served as governors.

They can be preserved as earthworks or soil marks. They are characterised by their proximity to other ancient features such as enclosures, sunken lanes and farmsteads and are divided into a patchwork quilt of square plots rarely more than 2,000 m2 in area although larger examples are known (e.g. Dorset and Wiltshire). Their small size (35-50m) implies that each was cultivated by one individual or family. Lynchets, evidence of early ploughing can often be seen at the upper and lower ends.

One of his earliest professional engagements was in Marc Blitzstein's Broadway opera, Regina. His breakthrough came when he gave his recital debut in New York's Town Hall in 1950. He went on to produce a highly acclaimed album of selections from Porgy and Bess with Leontyne Price in 1963. Biography =Early life and career= Warfield was born in West Helena, Arkansas, the oldest of five sons of a Baptist minister. He grew up in Rochester, New York, where his father was called to serve as pastor of Mt. Vernon Church. He gave his recital debut in New York's Town Hall on March 19, 1950. He was quickly invited by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to tour Australia and give 35 concerts. In 1952, Warfield performed in Porgy and Bess during a tour of Europe sponsored by the U.S. State Department (he made six separate tours for the US Department of State, more than any other American solo artist.) In this production, he played opposite the opera star Leontyne Price, whom he soon married, but the demands of two separate careers left them little time together. They divorced in 1972, but were featured together in a 1963 studio recording of excerpts from Porgy and Bess. According to a recent exhibit about World War Two, Warfield was the only African American member of the \\"Ritchie Boys\\", thousands of soldiers who were trained at Fort Ritchie, Maryland. It was an intelligence center where hundreds of Jewish recruits who fled Nazi Germany for the United States were trained to interrogate their one-time countrymen. According to the exhibit at the Zekelman Holocaust Memorial Center in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Warfield was brought to the camp because of his strong German skills which he perfected while studying music. Because of segregation, his skills were never put to use. Warfield was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music. In 1975 he accepted an appointment as Professor of Music at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He later became Chairman of the Voice Department. In 1994, he moved to Northwestern University's School of Music, where he stayed until his death. He sang the premiere performances of the version for soloist and orchestra of Set I of Aaron Copland's Old American Songs in 1955, and of the version for soloist and piano of Set II of the collection in 1958. (He also recorded both sets of the songs.) His vocal talents were also featured on two recordings of Handel's \\"Messiah\\" ‚Äì a classic, but heavily cut, performance by the Philadelphia Orchestra under the direction of Eugene Ormandy (released in 1959), and a lesser-known, drastically restructured recording made in 1956, also heavily cut, with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic. Bernstein combined the Christmas and Resurrection sections and ended with the arias and choruses depicting the death of Christ. The Ormandy recording featured the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, and Bernstein's the Westminster Choir. Warfield was also accomplished in acting and poetry recitation. He played the character De Lawd in a celebrated Hallmark Hall of Fame television production of \\"The Green Pastures\\", a role he played twice on live TV (both versions survive as kinescopes). He appeared in two Hollywood films, including a star- making performance as Joe in Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's 1951 Technicolor remake of Show Boat. His other film was an overlooked item called Old Explorers (1990), starring James Whitmore and Jos√© Ferrer. In a nod to Show Boat, Warfield played a cameo role as a tugboat captain. Footage of Warfield in Show Boat has been included in several TV shows and/or films, notably That's Entertainment!. Warfield played his Show Boat role in two other productions of the musical ‚Äì the 1966 Lincoln Center production, and a 1972 production in Vienna. He sang \\"Ol' Man River\\" in three different record albums of the show ‚Äì the 1951 motion picture soundtrack album on MGM Records, a 1962 studio album featuring Barbara Cook and John Raitt on Columbia Masterworks, and the RCA Victor album made from the Lincoln Center production. He made an appearance on The Colgate Comedy Hour and on a program called TV Recital Hall in 1951, the same year that he made his screen debut in Show Boat. He later appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1955. In 1961, he appeared as a recital soloist on an episode of the Young People's Concerts, conducted by Leonard Bernstein. In March 1984 he was the winner of a Grammy in the \\"Spoken Word\\" category for his outstanding narration of Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait accompanied by the Eastman Philharmonia . And in the 1990s, he narrated a special jazz arrangement of music from Show Boat, on the PRI program Riverwalk Jazz. In 1999 Warfield joined baritones Robert Sims and Benjamin Matthews in a trio by the name of \\"Three Generations\\". Managed by Arthur White, this ensemble toured the United States giving full concerts of African-American spirituals and folk songs until Warfield's death in 2002. =Decline and death= Beginning in 1962, Warfield began to have some trouble with his voice, as he himself admitted in his autobiography. This was only slightly noticeable on the 1962 studio recording of Show Boat. By the time he made the 1966 recording of the Lincoln Center production of the musical, his voice had deepened from merely bass-baritone to a full-fledged bass, and he could not sing the climactic high note on Ol' Man River as easily as he had in the 1951 film version, though he sounded fine on his lower notes. Because of this problem, however, he compensated by learning how to sing even more expressively than he had before. By 1976, Warfield, although still making various stage and television appearances, was not singing as much as he had in the past. He served as narrator in various orchestral works, such as Aaron Copland's Lincoln Portrait, and occasionally performed sprechstimme roles in works by Arnold Schoenberg. In the summer of 1976, he reprised his role as Porgy in a Lake George Opera Festival production of Porgy and Bess. Despite his issues, he did sing on occasion during his final years, despite the fact that by then his singing voice was practically gone. In those years, when he sang \\"Ol' Man River\\", he would not perform it with the original lyrics, but with the altered ones that Paul Robeson used in his recitals beginning in 1938. He died in Chicago in August 2002, following treatment at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, succumbing to injuries he sustained in his neck from a fall a month prior. Membership of organizations Warfield was active in many organizations, after appearing as the featured artist at the 50th year convention of the National Association of Negro Musicians , he became active with the organization, serving as its president for two terms. He later served on the boards of the NANM and the Schiller Institute. After joining the Schiller Institute in 1996, he began to collaborate with acclaimed vocal coach Sylvia Olden Lee in a project to save the performance tradition of the Negro spiritual. During the final years of his life, from 1999 to 2002, he performed regularly at Schiller Institute biannual conferences, often with Olden Lee as his accompanist, and the two of them traveled the country conducting singing workshops for members of the LaRouche Youth Movement. Warfield was made an honorary member of the Delta Lambda chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia at Ball State University in 1961, and awarded the Fraternity's Charles E. Lutton Man of Music Award in 1976 at its national convention in Evansville, Indiana. Legacy The William Warfield Scholarship Fund was formed in 1977 with the purpose supporting young African American classical singers at the Eastman School of Music. Recipients include Claron McFadden and Nicole Cabell. It has provided financial aid to over 35 students to date.

Her sexological work focused primarily on female sexuality. Hite built upon biological studies of sex by Masters and Johnson and by Alfred Kinsey. She also referenced theoretical, political and psychological works associated with the feminist movement of the 1970s, such as Anne Koedt's essay The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm. She renounced her United States citizenship in 1995 to become German. Early life, education, and career Hite was born Shirley Diana Gregory in Saint Joseph, Missouri, to Paul and Shirley Hurt Gregory. Shortly after the end of World War II, when her parents divorced, she took the surname of her stepfather, Raymond Hite. She graduated from Seabreeze High School in Daytona Beach, Florida. After she received a masters degree in history from the University of Florida in 1967, she moved to New York City and enrolled at Columbia University to work toward her Ph.D. in social history. Hite said that the reason for her not completing this degree was the conservative nature of Columbia at that time. In the 1970s, she did part of her research while at the National Organization for Women. She posed in the nude for Playboy while studying at Columbia University. Hite taught at Nihon University (Tokyo, Japan), Chongqing University in China, and Maimonides University, North Miami Beach, Florida, USA. Research focus Hite focused on understanding how individuals regard sexual experience and the meaning it holds for them. Hite believed that the ease at which women orgasm during masturbation contradicted traditional stereotypes about female sexuality. Hite's work concluded that 70% of women do not have orgasms through in-out, thrusting intercourse but are able to achieve orgasm easily by masturbation or other direct clitoral stimulation.Shere Hite: \\"I was making the point that clitoral stimulation wasn't happening during coitus. That's why women 'have difficulty having orgasms' ‚Äì they don't have difficulty when they stimulate themselves. Tracey Cox: \\"It's disappointing that one of Hite's main messages ‚Äì that 70 per cent of women don't have orgasms through penetration ‚Äì is not completely accepted today. Plenty of women don't feel comfortable admitting it, even to themselves, for fear their partners will love them less. But women are far more experimental now.\\" Hite, as well as Elisabeth Lloyd, have criticized Masters and Johnson for uncritically incorporating cultural attitudes on sexual behavior into their research; for example, the argument that enough clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm should be provided by thrusting during intercourse, and the inference that the failure of this is a sign of female \\"sexual dysfunction.\\" While not denying that both Kinsey and Masters and Johnson have played a crucial role in sex research, Hite believed that society must understand the cultural and personal construction of sexual experience to make the research relevant to sexual behavior outside the laboratory. She offered that limiting test subjects to \\"normal\\" women who report orgasming during coitus was basing research on the faulty assumption that having an orgasm during coitus was typical, something that her own research strongly refuted. Methodology Hite used an individualistic research method. Thousands of responses from anonymous questionnaires were used as a framework to develop a discourse on human responses to gender and sexuality. Her conclusions were met with methodological criticism. The fact that her data are not probability samples raises concerns about whether the sample data can be generalized to relevant populations. As is common with surveys concerning sensitive subjects such as sexual behavior, the proportion of nonresponse is typically large. Thus the conclusions derived from the data may not represent the views of the population under study because of sampling bias due to nonresponse. Hite has been praised for her theoretical fruitfulness in sociological research. The suggestion of bias in some of Hite's studies is frequently used as a talking point in university courses where sampling methods are discussed, along with The Literary Digest poll of 1936. One discussion of sampling bias is by Philip Zimbardo,Discovering Psychology with Philip Zimbardo (Episode 2: Understanding Research) who explained that women in Hite's study were given a survey about marriage satisfaction, where 98% reported dissatisfaction, and 75% reported having had extra-marital affairs, but where only 4% of women given the survey responded. Zimbardo argued that the women who had dissatisfaction may have been more motivated to respond than women who were satisfied and that her research may just have been \\"science- coded journalism.\\" Some or all of her published surveysE.g., The Hite Report on Female Sexuality (1976)E.g., The Hite Report on the Family: Growing Up Under Patriarchy (1994) depended on wide multi-channel questionnaire distribution, opportunity for many long answers on a respondent's own schedule, enforced respondent anonymity, and response by mail rather than polling by telephone. Sharon Lohr argues that the distribution of questionnaires to women's organizations and the length of the questions and the allowance for long responses introduces a bias towards people who are not typical. She also argues that several of the questions are leading the respondent to reply in a particular way.Sampling: Design and Analysis. Sharon L. Lohr. Cengage Learning. Personal life U.S. Embassy in Bonn, photographed in 1997, where Hite renounced her U.S. citizenship and temporarily became stateless In 1985, Hite married German concert pianist Friedrich H√∂ricke, who was 19 years her junior. The couple divorced in 1999. In 1995, she accepted German nationality, because she regarded German society as more tolerant and open-minded about her endeavors. Upon renunciation of her U.S. citizenship in 1995 at the former Embassy of the United States in Bonn, prior to formally accepting German nationality, Hite temporarily became stateless. She was married to Paul Sullivan at the time of her death.

The fund, named Keren Hakayemet (later known in English as the \\"Jewish National Fund\\") was formally established at the Fifth Zionist Congress in Basel in 1901. In its early years, the organization was headed by the Jewish industrialist Johann Kremenezky. Early land purchases were completed in Judea and the Lower Galilee. In 1909, the JNF played a central role in the founding of Tel Aviv. The establishment of the ‚ÄúOlive Tree Fund‚Äù marked the beginning of Diaspora support of afforestation efforts. The Blue Box (known in Yiddish as a pushke) has been part of the JNF since its inception, symbolizing the partnership between Israel and the Diaspora. In the period between the two world wars, about one million of these blue and white tin collection boxes could be found in Jewish homes throughout the world. From 1902 until the late 1940s, the JNF sold JNF stamps to raise money. For a brief period in May 1948, JNF stamps were used as postage stamps during the transition from Palestine to Israel.Kimmerly, Ian. ‚ÄúJewish National Fund issues postal substitutes‚Äù in ‚Äò‚Äô The Globe and Mail (Canada)‚Äô‚Äô July 22, 1989 =Ottoman era= The first parcel of land, east of Hadera, was received as a gift from the Russian Zionist leader Isaac Leib Goldberg of Vilnius, in 1903.

In 1904 and 1905, the JNF purchased land plots near the Sea of Galilee and at Ben Shemen. In 1921, JNF land holdings reached 25,000 acres (100 km¬≤), rising to 50,000 acres (200 km¬≤) by 1927. At the end of 1935, JNF held 89,500 acres (362 km¬≤) of land housing 108 Jewish communities.\\"100 colonies founded\\", The New York Times. April 17, 1936.

Most of the JNF's activities during the Mandatory period were closely associated with Yossef Weitz, the head of its settlement department. From the beginning, JNF's policy was to lease land long-term rather than sell it. In its charter, the JNF states: \\"Since the first land purchase in Eretz Israel in the early 1900s for and on behalf of the Jewish People, JNF has served as the Jewish People's trustee of the land, initiating and charting development work to enable Jewish settlement from the border in the north to the edge of the desert and Arava in the south.\\" =State of Israel= Gilboa mountains, c.1960 After Israel's establishment in 1948, the government began to sell absentee lands to the JNF. On January 27, 1949, 1,000 km¬≤ of land (from a total of about 3,500 km¬≤) was sold to the JNF for the price of I¬£11 million. Another 1,000 km¬≤ of land was sold to the JNF in October 1950. Over the years questions about the legitimacy of these transactions have been raised but Israeli legislation has generally supported the JNF's land claims.A. Golan. The Transfer of Abandoned Rural Arab Lands to Jews During Israel's War of Independence, Cathedra, 63, pp. 122-154, 1992 . English translation: ‚ÄúThe Transfer to Jewish Control of Abandoned Arab Land during the War of Independence,‚Äù in S.I. Troen and N. Lucas (eds), Israel, The First Decade of Independence (Albany, NY, 1995) In 1953, the JNF was dissolved and re-organized as an Israeli company under the name Keren Kayemet LeYisrael (JNF-KKL). In 1960, administration of the land held by the JNF-KKL, apart from forested areas, was transferred to a newly formed government agency, the Israel Land Administration (ILA). The ILA was then responsible for managing some 93% of the land of Israel. All the land managed by the ILA was defined as Israel lands; it included both land owned by the government (about 80%) and land owned by the JNF-KKL (about 13%).David Kretzmer, The Legal Status of the Arabs in Israel (Boulder, Colo.: Westview Press, 1990), pp. 60‚Äî61. The JNF-KKL received the right to nominate 10 of the 22 directors of the ILA, lending it significant leverage within that state body. After concentrating on the centre and northern part of the young state, the JNF-KKL started supporting Jewish settlements around the Negev border from around 1965. After the Six-Day War in 1967, the JNF-KKL started work in the newly occupied Palestinian territories as well. Reclamation projects The JNF charter specifies the reclamation of land for the Jewish people as its primary purpose. During the 1980s, almost 60,000 acres (240 km2) were planted. Over 50,000 acres (200 km2) of crop-land were reclaimed, and hundreds of miles of roads built. Research into the soil and water conservation and the construction of dams and reservoirs took on added importance in the face of water shortages and drought. The JNF's collaborative work involves participation in the International Arid Land Consortium, which explores the problems and solutions unique to arid and semiarid regions, working to develop sustainable ecological practices to improve the quality of life among people in the dry areas.http://www.kkl.org.il/kkl/english/main_subject/curb%20global%20warming/the%20international%20arid%20lands%20consortium.x =Afforestation= Eshtaol Forest planted by JNF Pope John Paul Forest in Nazareth Jerusalem forest The early JNF was active in afforestation and reclamation of land. By 1935, JNF had planted 1.7 million trees over a total area of 1,750 acres (7.08 km¬≤) and drained swamps, like those in the Hula Valley. Over fifty years, the JNF planted over 260 million trees largely in semi-arid, rocky, hilly terrain in which cultivation is not cost-effective and the risk of land degradation is high. While the Ministry of Agriculture is the official regulator of Israel's forests, the JNF is responsible for the implementation of forest management and afforestation.http://www.kkl.org.il/kkl/english/main_subject/curb%20global%20warming/afforestation%20to%20combat%20desertification%20.x In 2006, the JNF signed a 49-year lease agreement with the State of Israel which gives it control over of Negev land for the development of forests. The JNF has been criticized for planting non-native pine trees which are unsuited to the climate, rather than local species such as olive trees.Rabbi David Seidenberg.\\"The Giving Tree: A Way to Honor Our Vision for Israel\\"; Neohasid, 2006 Others say that JNF deserves credit for this decision, and the forests would not have survived otherwise. According to JNF statistics, six out of every 10 saplings planted at a JNF site in Jerusalem do not survive, although the survival rate for planting sites outside Jerusalem is much higher ‚Äì close to 95 percent. The Israeli newspaper Maariv claimed that workers remove saplings daily to allow more tourists to plant the following day, but the JNF denied this and said it would sue the paper for libel.Deborah Sontag. \\"Arboreal Scandal in Israel: Not All of the Trees Planted There Stay Planted\\". The New York Times, July 3, 2000, The Union for Environmental Defense has criticized the fund's forestry practices for \\"overreliance on highly flammable pine trees\\" and overuse of toxic herbicides, in the context of minimal government and public scrutiny. Some forests have been planted for security reasons\\"From classic forestry to ecological forestry KKL-JNF at 36th Israeli Ecological Society Conference\\"; Jerusalem Post, June 30, 2008 and as a means of demarcating Israeli space. Critics argue that many JNF lands outside the West Bank were illegally confiscated from Palestinian refugees, and that the JNF furthermore should not be involved with lands in the West Bank. Shaul Ephraim Cohen has claimed that trees have been planted to restrict Bedouin herding.Shaul Ephraim Cohen. \\"The Politics of Planting\\"; University of Chicago 1993 p.121 Susan Nathan wrote that forests were planted on the site of abandoned Arab villages after the 1948 war. Nathan also writes that olive trees were replaced by pine and cypress treesNathan, Susan (2005) op cit pages 129-130 and that JNF afforestation policy erases traces of the Arab presence prior to 1948.Nathan, Susan (2005) op cit pages 151-152 In 2008, the JNF announced that historical information plaques erected in JNF parks and forests would cite the names of the Arab villages formerly located there. Since 2009, the JNF has been helping the Palestinian Authority plan public parks and other civic amenities for the Palestinian city of Rawabi, north of Ramallah. The JNF provided the Palestinian Authority with 3,000 tree seedlings for a forested area being developed on the edge of the new city. =Water conservation= Israel's fresh water supply is dependent on 50 days a year of seasonal rainfall, while water consumption has doubled since 1960. Towards the end of the 1980s, the JNF undertook several large-scale water conservation projects. Dams and reservoirs were built to capture rainwater run-off which would have otherwise been lost in the Arava Valley, Reshafim in the Beit She'arim Valley and Kedma near Kiryat Gat. An artificial lake was built in Timna Park. The JNF has built 200 reservoirs around the country, and plans to build 30 more reservoirs and water treatment plants over the next five years. Over the past decade, JNF has invested over $114.99 million in reservoir construction, increasing the country's total storage capacity by 7%, to over of water. JNF is also involved in river rehabilitation projects all over Israel, such as the Nahal Alexander Restoration Project begun in 2003. =Land development= JNF trees in the Negev Desert. Man-made dunes (here a liman) help keep in rainwater, creating an oasis. The JNF's engagement in developing Israel for Jewish purposes has involved a range of massive land infrastructure development projects. In the 1980s, the JNF launched a project known collectively as \\"Operation Promised Land,\\" to meet the challenge of the massive upsurge of Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union and Ethiopia. In recent years, the JNF has again moved towards the development of towns to accommodate new Jewish immigrants, focusing on the Galilee and Negev regions, the two areas of Israel with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority. In particular, the JNF's 600 million dollar Blueprint Negev aims to attract and build infrastructure for 250,000 new settlers in the Negev desert, which accounts for 60% of the country's land mass but remains sparsely populated. The plan has come under scrutiny as groups such as Bustan, Save the Negev, and Ohalah have expressed concern over the project's lack of transparency in light of the potential strain on ecological resources and the possible impacts on Bedouin communities nearby.Daniel Orenstein and Steven Hamburg.\\"The JNF's Assault on the Negev\\" ; The Jerusalem Report, November 28, 2005Rebecca Manski.A Desert Mirage: The Rising Role of US Money in Negev Development;News from Within October/November 2006 Fundraising campaigns Benefit concert at David's Citadel, 1926 The United States arm of the JNF, incorporated on January 26, 1926, is the largest contributor to JNF-KKL. In 1996, JNF-USA was accused of mismanaging funds. According to the charges, only 21% of US donations reached Israel, and money was being diverted to Latin American JNF offices. In the wake of this scandal, the North American management was forced to resign.Alon Tal. Pollution in a Promised Land; University of California, 2002The tax-exempt status of the JNF-USA was challenged in 2011 as violating the public policy of the United States with respect to ethnic and religious discrimination. In the United Kingdom, the JNF-UK (full name JNF Charitable Trust) was formed in 1939 and registered as a charitable organization. In October 2005, the JNF-KKL in Israel split from its British partner, accusing JNF-UK of having \\"misled\\" the public. The JNF-KKL claimed that the British group was using the KKL name to raise funds \\"for their own causes which are not associated with KKL.\\" The Israeli JNF-KKL said it would launch a separate fundraising operation in the UK. JNF-UK launched a legal action to stop KKL using the names \\"JNF\\" or \\"Jewish National Fund\\" in the UK. The two organisations made peace after the Israeli-born businessman Samuel Hayek took over as JNF-UK chairman in 2008. Israeli JNF-KKL ended its dispute with the JNF-UK within weeks of ending a similar dispute with the American JNF-USA The charitable status of the JNF-UK has come under increasing attack.'Stop the JNF' campaign relaunched. The Jewish Chronicle, March 31, 2011. British prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had been Honorary Patrons of the JNF-UK, like all British prime ministers before them since its inception. David Cameron resigned as Honorary Patron to JNF-UK in 2011.Cameron leaves the JNF. The Jewish Chronicle, Simon Rocker, May 26, 2011. According to a spokesman, Cameron said it was an organisation that was specifically focused around work in one specific country‚Äîi.e., Israel.Cameron's JNF split: it was Israel. The Jewish Chronicle, Robyn Rosen, June 2, 2011. Cameron's decision was interpreted as a snub, in spite of the spokesman's assurances that his decision had \\"absolutely nothing to do with any anti-Israel campaign\\". However, campaigners claimed that Cameron's resignation was due to political pressure. Since then, the JNF-UK's Honorary Patrons include no leader of the main British political parties. An Early Day Motion in the British parliament called for the revocation of the JNF's charitable status in the UK and was signed by 66 Members of Parliament. In 2012 the Green Party called for the JNF to be stripped of its charity status. JNF collection boxes JNF collection box JNF's blue charity boxes were distributed by the JNF almost from its inception at the initiative of Johann Kremenezky. Once found in many Jewish homes, the boxes became one of the most familiar symbols of Zionism. A children's song about the boxes, written by Dr. Yehoshua Frizman, Headmaster of the Real Gymnasium for Girls in Kovno, ran A bank clerk named Haim Kleinman in Nadvorna, Galicia placed a blue box labeled \\"Keren Le'umit\\" in his office and urged others to do the same. The first mass-produced boxes were distributed in 1904.Moshe Kol-Kalman, The Blue Box, The Israel Philatelist, June 2009, Vol LX, No. 3, p. 116-7. Kleinman visited Mandate Palestine in the 1930s and planned to make aliyah, but perished in the Holocaust. Menahem Ussishkin wrote that \\"The coin the child contributes or collects for the redemption of the land is not important in itself; it is not the child that gives to the Keren Kayemeth, but rather the Fund that gives to the child, a foothold and lofty ideal for all the days of his life.\\" The boxes could take a variety of shapes and sizes. Some were paper made to fold flat like envelopes and able to contain only a small number of coins, some early American boxes were cylindrical, some German boxes were made of tin stamped into the shape of bound books. Israel issued postage stamps bearing the image of the blue box in 1983, 1991, and 1993 for the JNF's 90th anniversary. Controversies =Transparency= T'ruah has expressed concerns that the JNF is not transparent about where their funds go and that the organization may be subsidizing projects in West Bank settlements. The organization's chief executive later acknowledged that JNF does fund projects within settlements. A review of their tax filing from 2014 led Rabbi Jill Jacobs of T'ruah to estimate that about $600,000 of the $27.2 million in grants by JNF-USA went to support settlements. Israeli lawmakers have sought, unsuccessfully, to allow the State Comptroller to examine the books of the organization to determine whether the group's funds were being spent appropriately. =Leasing policy controversy= A community in the Negev established by the JNF under its Blueprint Negev program Aminadav Forest The JNF stipulates that only Jews can buy, mortgage or lease JNF land. Article 23 of the JNF lease states that the lessee must pay compensation to the JNF if this stipulation is violated.Lehn, W. 'The Jewish National Fund', in The Journal of Palestine Studies Vol:3(4) (1974) On 13 October 2004, Adalah, an organization and legal center for Arab minority rights in Israel, submitted a petition to the Supreme Court entitled Challenging the Prohibition on Arab Citizens of Israel from Living on Jewish National Fund Land.Supreme Court Petition: H.C. 9205/04, Adalah v. The Israel Lands Administration, the Minister of Finance and the Jewish National Fund. Shortly afterwards, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and the Arab Center for Alternative Planning also filed a petition to the Supreme Court challenging the ILA policy as discriminatory.H.C. 9010/04, The Arab Center for Alternative Planning, et al. v. The Israel Lands Administration, et al. The JNF responded to the two petitions on 9 December. In its response, the JNF stated: On 26 January 2005, Israel's Attorney General Menachem Mazuz ruled that lease restrictions violated Israeli anti-discrimination laws, and that the ILA could not discriminate against Arab citizens of Israel in the marketing and allocation of the lands it managed; this applied both to government lands and to lands belonging to the JNF. However, the Attorney General also decided that, whenever a non-Jewish citizen wins an ILA tender for a plot of JNF-owned land, the ILA would compensate the JNF with an equal amount of land. This would allow the JNF to maintain its current hold over of land, or 13% of the total land in Israel. As a result of the Mazuz ruling, authorities found themselves facing a conundrum: on the one hand the JNF, as a \\"private\\" organization, had received donations from outside Israel which were specifically earmarked for the benefit of Jews; on the other hand, the state and the ILA (an agency of the state), which administered the land owned by the JNF, were banned from discriminating against non-Jews. In early 2005, the JNF and the Finance Ministry were reported as trying to draft a new agreement that would separate the JNF from the state, thereby allowing it to continue selling land to Jews only.JNF, treasury seek formula for continued Jews-only land sales. Haaretz. Yuval Yoaz. January 28, 2005. In July 2007, the Israeli Knesset approved the Jewish National Fund Bill, submitted by MK Uri Ariel (National Union/National Religious Party), in its preliminary reading; but the bill was later dropped. The bill sought to authorize the JNF practice of refusing to lease land to Arab citizens. The bill called for a new provision to the 1960 Israel Land Administration Law, entitled \\"Management of the Jewish National Fund's Lands\\"; the provision stated that regardless of other conflicting rulings, leasing JNF lands for Jewish settlement did not constitute discrimination, and: \\"For the purpose of every law, the association documents of the Jewish National Fund will be interpreted according to the judgment of the Jewish National Fund's founders and from a nationalist-Zionist standpoint.\\"NEWS UPDATE 27 September 2007: Supreme Court Adopts Jewish National Fund's Request to Delay Full Hearing of Adalah's Petition for Three Months to Allow JNF and State to Reach Agreement Regarding Marketing of JNF- Controlled Land\\" ; Adalah, 2008] In September 2007, the High Court heard a further Adalah petition seeking cancellation of an ILA policy as well as Article 27 of the Regulations of the Obligations of Tenders, which in concert prevent Arab citizens from participating in bids for JNF-controlled land.\\"SPECIAL REPORT on The Jewish National Fund: Challenging the discriminatory land policies of the Jewish National Fund (JNF)\\" Adalah, 2008] The High Court of Justice agreed to delay a ruling by at least four months, and a temporary settlement was reached (following the compromise proposed in 2005 by Menachem Mazuz) wherein, although the JNF would be prevented from discriminating on grounds of ethnicity, nevertheless every time land is sold to a non-Jew, the ILA would compensate it with an equivalent amount of land, thus ensuring the total amount of land owned by Jewish Israelis remains the same. An alternative proposal submitted by Amnon Rubinstein, a former minister, recommended that a distinction be made between JNF lands and state lands, such that all JNF lands directly acquired via donations from abroad specifically for the benefit of Jews (some ) will pass to the direct control of the JNF; while properties purchased by the JNF from the state in the 1950s and formerly belonging to Palestinian refugees (the so-called \\"lands of missing persons\\" or \\"absentee\\" lands, amounting to ) would revert to state control. Rubinstein's intention was \\"to avoid passing racist legislation [such as the Ariel Bill] that would limit the use of these lands to the Jews\\". Others denied however that the Ariel Bill was racist. The Rubinstein proposal was not taken up. In late 2007 a land swap deal was proposed that would allowing the JNF to continue leasing its lands only to Jews. Urban JNF land sold in future to non-Jews would include an automatic swap mechanism: the fund would transfer the land to the ILA, and in exchange would receive the purchase price plus a similar-sized plot in the Negev. =Legal conflicts= In December 2011, Seth Morrison resigned from the board of JNF-USA in protest at the decision by Himnuta, a subsidiary of JNF-KKL, to launch eviction proceedings against the Sumarin family, who lived in the Silwan neighborhood of East Jerusalem. In the case of the Sumarin family, the children of the original owner, Musa Sumarin, were declared absentees after his death even though there were other family members living in the home at the time. In 1991, the Israeli government took the step of transferring the property to the JNF subsidiary. A campaign against the JNF's eviction was launched by Rabbis for Human Rights, the Sheikh Jarrah Solidarity Movement, and the Jewish organization Yachad. The pressures led the JNF to delay the eviction.The JNF played a similar role in evicting the Gozlan family in the 1990s. See also *Central Zionist Archives in Jerusalem.

The leaders of the group are MC Eiht and Tha Chill. History =Formation and early years= C.M.W. included rappers MC Eiht, Tha Chill, DJ Mike T, and producers DJ Slip and The Unknown DJ. In the mid-1980s, founding members Tha Chill and MC Eiht were writing raps and recording demo tapes (also called \\"hood tapes\\") in their spare time while gang bangin' in their hood in Compton, CA. Tha Chill and MC Eiht choose to leave that street corner hustle scene in Compton and start making money in a legit but fun way when they saw their long time friend MC Ren of the multi platinum West Coast hip hop group N.W.A started to create a huge street buzz in the Los Angeles County area by releasing records along with rapper Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, DJ Yella and Arabian Prince. In 1987, while in Compton, The Unknown DJ was given one of these \\"hood tapes\\" by a friend and became very interested in the diverse style and rhyme schemes of the \\"Compton's Most Wanted\\" rap group. The Unknown DJ then took the \\"hood tape\\" to DJ Slip in Gardena, a city just south of Compton, who at the time was the owner of Los Angeles County's largest DJ Rental business called \\"Music People - DJ4HIRE\\". In 1988, Compton's Most Wanted under the production leadership of \\"Terry DJ Slip Allen\\" recorded their 1st ever professional songs called Rhymes To Funky. It was one of the many featured songs on the \\"Sound Control Mob - Under Investigation\\" Compton compilation album on \\"Kru Cut / City Fresh Records\\", along with artist like: \\"Vanilla C\\", \\"PG 13\\" and \\"MC Looney Tunes A.K.A. MC Loon E Toons\\". This label was owned by Compton, CA. Executive producers Alonzo Williams A.K.A. \\"Grandmaster Lonz' of the World Class Wreckin' Crew and Charles Turner In 1989, C.M.W. released their first single \\"This Is Compton\\" b/w \\"Give It Up\\" and \\"I Give Up Nothin'\\" (pt. 1) on The Unknown DJ Los Angeles-based record label Techno Hop Records. Techno Hop Records label was primarily an Electro genre label, but thru the futuristic mind of The Unknown DJ, he single- handedly launched the legendary west coast gangsta rap genre with songs by Ice-T \\"6 In The Mornin'\\" and King Tee \\"Ya Better Bring A Gun\\" featuring Mixmaster Spade. In the middle of recording this maxi single \\"This Is Compton\\" b/w \\"Give It Up\\" and \\"I Give Up Nothin'\\" managing misunderstanding started to occur between DJ Ant Capone who, along with his father \\"Old Man Conway\\", were acting managers for C.M.W. on the \\"Sound Control Mob - Under Investigation\\" (Compton Compilation album) and The Unknown DJ. Soon after DJ Ant Capone choose to leave the group. In 1990, C.M.W. released their first album, It's a Compton Thang on Orpheus Records. It contained the hit single and video \\"One Time Gaffled Em Up\\". It's a Compton Thang was entirely produced by DJ Slip and The Unknown DJ and all song lyrics were written by MC Eiht. During the recording of this album Tha Chill was arrested for \\"joy riding\\", but was released a few weeks later on time served and finished recording his remaining verses on the songs of the album. The album peaked at #132 in the U.S. charts. A year later in 1991, the group C.M.W. released their 2nd album, Straight Checkn 'Em, which featured popular hits songs like \\"Growin' Up In tha Hood\\", \\"Driveby Miss Daisy\\", \\"Compton's Lynchin'\\", and the first version of the \\"Def Wish\\" series.. \\"Growin' Up In The Hood\\" was also released on Warner Bros for the John Singleton block buster movie Boyz n the Hood starring Ice Cube, Cuba Gooding Jr., Laurence Fishburne, Nia Long and Morris Chestnut. During the recording of this album Tha Chill once again was arrested and this time sent to prison. This altercation had happen some months before the album was released and Tha Chill did not have the chance to participate on any of the other songs recordings, except for the original album version of \\"Growin' Up In the Hood\\". However, the album Straight Check'n Em was a bigger success than their previous album, peaking at #92 in the U.S. charts. Again in 1992, the group released their third and most successful studio album, Music to Driveby. It featured the single \\"Hood Took Me Under\\" which the original song was produced by DJ Mike T and the remix single and video version by DJ Slip. This song charted at #5 in U.S. The \\"Hood Took Me Under\\" album version was also featured years later in 2004 on the popular PlayStation 2 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas radio station, Radio Los Santos and in 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox. MC Eiht also has a voice roll one of the game characters \\"Ryder\\". The album charted at #66 in the U.S. U.S. charts and is considered a classic by many people. C.M.W. are known especially for their slow, often melancholic raps, using samples from 1970s soul and funk records such as \\"Joy\\" and \\"Walk On By\\" by Isaac Hayes and \\"Love T.K.O.\\" by Teddy Pendergrass. They are also known for using movie samples such as \\"Scareface\\" and \\"Deep Cover\\". Freestyle keyboardist, saxophone and harmonica player Willie Zimmerman, though not officially a member, is used extensively on songs Drive By Miss Daisy, Def Wish, Niggaz Strugglin, U's A Bitch, and Hood Rat. On the Music To Driveby album song \\"Who's Fucking Who,\\" produced by DJ Mike T and DJ Slip which took aimed at Bronx, NY old school rapper Timothy \\"Tim Dog\\" Blair. This whole altercation had begun while C.M.W. was on their album promotional tour for Straight Checkn' Em in 1990. While at a Sony music release party for all the labels under the Sony Corporation. Epic Records Compton's Most Wanted and Columbia Records Tim Dog were at the party. C.M.W. met Tim Dog and he explained his reasons for recording the \\"Fuck Compton\\" song saying it was a personal beef against N.W.A's Dr. Dre for an altercation with rapper/ television personality Dee Barnes from the rap video show Pump It Up. Tim Dog felt that since Dee Barnes was born in New York City he had to address the issue represent all New Yorkers in some type of way . He also stated that he didn't like jeri curls and he also hated R&B; singer Michel'le's voice. But all that changed while taking pictures when Tim Dog asked members DJ Mike T and MC Eiht to spread a message to all Compton and West Coast hip hop rappers that \\"he was accepting all diss records and he wanted to start a U.T.F.O. style of dissing like the \\"Roxanne Roxanne\\" era. DJ Mike T got infuriated by the gimmick approach, knowing that the New York/ Los Angeles feud was about to boil over and Tim Dog rhyme style was getting outdated in New York by their next generation of rap. Once back on the West Coast DJ Mike T had to convince MC Eiht to write a song because MC Eiht already knowing that Tim Dog was already irrelevant with his one hit wonder. C.M.W. released their 2nd single/ video \\"Def Wish 2\\" was focused at well-known Compton rapper name DJ Quik after, MC Eiht fellow gang members convinced him that DJ Quik made a low key diss in a controversial statement on his \\"underground tape\\", prior to his signing with Profile Records. \\"Def Wish II\\" along with \\"Another Victim, Dead Men Tell No Lies, U's A Bitch, Hood Rat\\", were the last 5 songs ever produced again by The Unknown DJ for Compton's Most Wanted, before being relieved of his production contract from Epic Records for sub selling MC Eiht writers publishing, misdirecting funds and covering it up in a fraudulent business tax write-off. It was the last album C.M.W. released before their long hiatus. Finally, after a break of eight years, C.M.W. released Represent in 2000 on the independent record label Half Ounce Records Inc. owned by MC Eiht, Boom Bam and deceased rapper Bird from Lil Hawk and Bird. The album featured the single \\"This Is Compton 2000\\" and \\"Some May Know\\", but did not achieve the success of their previous albums. In 2006, C.M.W. released Music to Gang Bang on B Dub Records, which contained four singles, most notably the single titled \\"Music to Gang Bang\\", with original member MC Eiht and newest members \\"Big 2Da Boy and Diamond Rich\\". However the album was not as commercially successful as previous releases. In 2008, Compton rapper The Game revealed in an interview that he was in talks with MC Eiht to revive the group; however, this has yet to materialize. =Solo careers= By serving over 2 years in prison Tha Chill had missed recording on two of C.M.W. biggest albums Straight Checkn 'Em and Music to Driveby. So MC Eiht had a better plan to revamp Tha Chill rapping career and choose to connect him with Compton rapper and fellow gang brother Boom Bam to form the group Niggas On The Run. Tha Chill agreed with MC Eiht plan and began to tour with C.M.W. opening up for all their shows with songs from N.O.T.R.. In 1994, the N.O.T.R. rap album was shelved after the short release and members Tha Chill and Boom Bam became current members of the Compton's Most Wanted team. Tha Chill had never let making a few mistakes in life shorten his goals on becoming a respected artist. Knowing how to play the drums at an early age he ventured in producing and started recording songs for MC Eiht, MC Ren, Compton rapper C.P.O., Kokane, Jayo Felony, Killafornia Organization, Wanted Gang, Chillafornia, 1st Generation rap group King Tee, Kurupt, MC Eiht, Jayo Felony, producers Battle Catt and Sir Jinxs, Diirty OG'z with Kurupt, Tray Dee and Weasel Loc and the list goes on. Tha Chill is due any day in 2017 to release his solo album \\"4 Wit 80\\" written and produced by himself with some features of many popular artist and of all the original Compton's Most Wanted members: MC Eiht, Boom Bam and DJ Mike T. After \\"Music To Driveby\\", MC Eiht had 3 albums left under contract with Epic Records and decided to pursue a solo career since he had already written the lyrics for all three C.M.W. previous albums. In 1994, MC Eiht debut solo album \\"We Come Strapped\\" featuring C.M.W. which was certified \\"Gold\\" after selling over 500,000 copies. In 1995, he released his 2nd solo album \\"Death Threatz\\" featuring C.M.W. In 1996 MC Eiht released his 3rd and last album on Epic Records \\"Last Man Standing\\" to finish out the 5-album deal with them. In 1997 and 1998, MC Eiht signed to Mack 10 \\"Ho Bangin Records\\" and release \\"Thicker Than Water\\" title song for the blockbuster movie \\"Thicker Than Water\\" and recorded 2 album as well \\"Section 8 and N' My Neighborhood\\". In the publics eye MC Eiht is a very underrated artist for the fact he has released a solo album, song features with popular artist such as: 2004 Snoop Dogg \\"Wet Like Candy\\" on the album Blue Carpet Treatment, 2004 and 2006 MC Eiht released collaboration album with Spice 1 \\"The Pioneers\\" and \\"Keep It Gangsta\\" and Brotha Lynch Hung \\"The New Season\\", 2010 1st Generation rap group with west coast artist King Tee, Kurupt, Tha Chill, Jayo Felony, producers Sir Jinxs and Battle Catt. \\"Sharks In The Water\\", \\"Killin' Me Softly\\" and \\"Whole World Spends\\" and 2012 Kendrick Lamar \\"M.A.A.D City\\" and various mixtapes every year since 1994 except for 2008, 2011 and 2016 where he stayed either working on tour or recording studio songs with himself and other artist. In 2016 MC Eiht recorded a feature on a young Compton rapper album known as \\"Problem\\" produced by DJ Quik which is soon to be released. In 2017 MC Eiht has joined forces with DJ Premier of Gangstarr and recorded his solo album \\"Which Way Is West\\" with features by Tha Chill, \\"Young Maylay\\", \\"Dub C\\" of the Westside Connection and many more. Since the formation of Compton's Most Wanted in 1989, DJ Mike T was also known as one of the most top rated DJ's in the Los Angeles, CA. club scene. He worked in all the most popular dance spots in the Hollywood and Downtown areas for a promotional company known as Diamond Productions. In 1991, Diamond Productions had teamed up with R&B; and hip hop singing group Bell, Biv, DeVoe and created an epic club era in the Los Angeles area called \\"Mental Mondays\\" with music provided by DJ Mike T.

Lynchets are a feature of ancient field systems of the British Isles. They are commonly found in vertical rows and more commonly referred to as \\"strip lynchets\\". Lynchets appear predominantly in Southern Britain and many are in areas close to Iron Age forts and other earthworks, including later Roman earthworks and earlier barrows from the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods. The size, location, spacing and number of rows of many strip lynchets indicates that many were man-made. It is most likely that lynchets were dug to maximise the use of land for agriculture, although they may have had other, ceremonial uses. The word is the diminutive form of lynch, now rarely appearing in the English language, indicating an agricultural terrace. However, both \\"lynchet\\" and \\"lynch\\" may also be used to refer to a strip of green land left between two pieces of ploughed land on non-sloping ground; or to a natural slope or terrace along the face of a chalk down. The traditional theory on the formation of lynchets is that they may form naturally on the downslope of a field ploughed over a long period of time. The disturbed soil slips down the hillside to create a \\"positive lynchet\\" (where the new surface is higher than the original surface), while the area reduced in level becomes a \\"negative lynchet\\" (where the new surface is lower). Lynchets above the village of Loders, Dorset In Loders, Dorset, lynchets form a terraced band structure similar to an amphitheatre overlooking the village. Lynchets also form part of the conservation area of the neighbouring village of Uploders, where they apparently form old hillside field systems in close proximity to an iron age fort and hill-top barrows. 19th-century maps indicate that cider orchards were planted on some lynchets in that area.

It is also the final story of the series' original 26-year run; it did not return regularly until 2005. It marks the final regular television appearances of Sylvester McCoy as the Seventh Doctor and Sophie Aldred as Ace, and is also the final appearance of Anthony Ainley as the Master, the latter appearing alongside McCoy's Doctor for the only time. Journalist Matthew Sweet has described Survival as \\"a parable about Thatcherism\\" that shares multiple characteristics with the later David Tennant era of Doctor Who. In the serial, the Doctor brings Ace home to Perivale, where her friends have been transported to the planet of the Cheetah People. Plot The Seventh Doctor brings Ace back home to Perivale in west London. The suburb is not as it should be: a mysterious black cat is wandering around, somehow creating a situation in which humans are hunted down and made to disappear to another dimension. Ace becomes worried when most of her old friends seem to have disappeared, but the Doctor is more preoccupied with the behaviour of the strange cat. It becomes apparent the black cat is being controlled by a strange being in the other dimension, viewing the scenes in Perivale through the cat's eyes and choosing which humans to chase and transport. An unhappy young man called Stuart becomes his next victim. Ace follows soon afterwards, hunted down by a Cheetah Person on horseback, which seems to have a hunting affinity with the curious cat. Later the Doctor and a keep-fit instructor called Paterson are chosen and teleported to another world, bathed in a blood-red sky, where the Doctor is greeted by his nemesis the Master. A Cheetah Person, shown at a 50th Anniversary event. The renegade is evidently unwell, his eyes and mouth displaying feline characteristics, and is using the black cat (or kitling) to create a dimensional bridge for the Cheetah People to hunt prey on Earth. He tells the Doctor that the planet is alive and has a bewitching influence; the indigenous population bred the kitlings and had a great civilisation, but they regressed into animals through the power of the planet. He too is beginning to show changes and needs the Doctor's help to escape from the planet. Ace has meanwhile made contact with some of her friends, Shreela and Midge, who are hiding in some woods with a young man called Derek. The planet is evidently dangerous as both Stuart and a terrified milkman find out when a Cheetah Person hunts him to the death. Ace and her friends soon find the Doctor and Paterson, and the Doctor has deduced they are on a very ancient planet, which is dying. A Cheetah pack then attacks and during the fight back Midge kills one Cheetah while Ace injures another, called Karra. She begins to form an attachment to Karra and nurses her, tending her injuries, which worries the Doctor greatly. In time Ace's eyes change and she begins to transform into a Cheetah herself. She abandons the Doctor to go hunting with Karra but he eventually wins her round. Midge has meanwhile completely fallen to the power of the planet and is turning into an animal. The Master seizes on this and uses Midge to teleport them both back to Earth and away from the dying world. The Doctor persuades Ace to help him get back to Perivale and she does so, also enabling Paterson, Derek and Shreela to flee the strange planet. Paterson denies anything amiss has taken place, falling back on his \\"survival of the fittest\\" mantras and his self-defence classes. The Doctor and Ace now head around Perivale in search of Midge and the Master. They eventually find them at the youth club, where they have killed Paterson for sport, and Midge too is killed in the Master's machinations. Karra's arrival brings comfort to Ace, whose transformation is continuing, but the Master kills Karra too. The Master transports the Doctor with him back to the Cheetah Planet for a final conflict but the Doctor resists the pull of the planet, turning away from violence, and is transported away from the dying world. However, the Master looks doomed on the planet as it begins to break up. The Doctor has gone back to the TARDIS and Earth, where he finds Ace, whose metamorphosis has reversed, and tells her she will have grown through the experience: the element of the Cheetah Planet, however, will remain within her forever and they return to the TARDIS. =Outside references= During the scenes in Midge's flat, Ace grabs War, an album by rock band U2, and says \\"are they still going?\\". Production =Writing= Writer Rona Munro approached script editor Andrew Cartmel at a BBC scriptwriting workshop and said that she'd \\"kill to write for Doctor Who.\\" The story Munro developed incorporated themes including the morals of hunting (personified by the Cheetah People and signposted by Ace's friend Ange collecting for hunt saboteurs). Working titles for the story included Cat-Flap and Blood Hunt. The title Survival was chosen by Cartmel. Munro was disappointed by the realisation of the Cheetah People: =Recording= Survival was one of only a handful of Doctor Who serials to be recorded completely on BBC Outside Broadcast video, instead of the mix of OB and studio video that was more common during the late 1980s, and the mix of film and video that was usual before them. The other stories to be recorded solely on OB video were The Sontaran Experiment (1975), Delta and the Bannermen (1987), Silver Nemesis (1988) and The Curse of Fenric (1989). It was almost on the shooting days for the scenes on the planet of the Cheetah people. One of the extras removed her costume (revealing that she was wearing very little underneath) and simply walked off the set, causing delays while a replacement was found.Interview with Sylvester McCoy on the Survival DVD The battle at the climax of the story was recorded and is set on the site of the ancient hill fort at Horsenden Hill, Perivale. The majority of location recording was done in and around Perivale, with small sections shot at nearby Ealing, outside and near The Drayton Court pub. =The final Doctor Who episode in the original series= Having already surmised that episode three of Survival was likely to at least be the last episode of Doctor Who for some time, and possibly the last ever, the programme's producer John Nathan-Turner decided close to transmission that a more suitable conclusion should be given to the final episode. To this end, script editor Andrew Cartmel wrote a short, melancholic closing monologue for actor Sylvester McCoy, which McCoy recorded on 23 November 1989, the day after Episode 1 was broadcast, and also by coincidence, the show's twenty-sixth anniversary: \\"There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream. People made of smoke, and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there‚Äôs injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace -- we‚Äôve got work to do!\\" This was dubbed over the closing scene as the Doctor and Ace walked off into the distance, apparently to further adventures. The Doctor Who production office at the BBC finally closed down in August 1990, having been in continuous operation since 1963. Although Survival was the last Doctor Who serial of the original series to be transmitted, it was not the last to have been produced; that was Ghost Light, which had been broadcast some weeks earlier, as the antepenultimate story of the original run. This story is the last to feature Anthony Ainley as the Master. Ainley was not asked to return as the Master for the 1996 Doctor Who television movie. Instead, Gordon Tipple was cast as the Master for the prologue and Eric Roberts played the Master for the rest of the movie. Ainley reprised the role of the Master for the 1997 computer game Destiny of the Doctors. He continued to be active in Doctor Who, attending conventions and recording a commentary track for the DVD of the 1981 serial The Keeper of Traken. Ainley died in May 2004. This story was also the last to entirely feature Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor. McCoy returned briefly to the role at the beginning of the 1996 Doctor Who television movie to regenerate into the Eighth Doctor (played by Paul McGann). Finally, this story was the last to feature Sophie Aldred as Ace. Aldred would have continued in her role had the series been renewed for Season 27; however, Aldred's contract was set to expire at the middle part of that season. As a result, the character of Ace was set to be written out of the series in an Ice Warrior story called Ice Time (1990) by Marc Platt. According to various interviews with the production team, the new companion would have been a female safecracker whom the Doctor would have taken under his wing, with her gangster father as a recurring character. For details on Doctor Who during the 1990s, see History of Doctor Who. After Survival was broadcast, both McCoy and Aldred played their characters on screen for the BBC on two occasions: first in a 1990 episode of the schools and colleges series Search Out Science and once more in 1993, along with many other former Doctor Who actors, in Dimensions in Time, a benefit for Children in Need. The two actors reprised their roles in officially licensed audio productions for Big Finish starting in 1999, and again in 2001 for the BBC webcast production, Death Comes to Time. Doctor Who eventually returned to production as a BBC television series in 2004, produced by BBC Wales. \\"Rose\\", the first episode of the new series, aired on 26 March 2005. As the new series is produced as 45-minute episodes, this makes Survival the final serial to date to be produced in 25-minute instalments, which had been the standard for the series (except for a one-season experiment with 45-minute episodes in 1985) since 1963. This story was also the last to feature the face of the current Doctor in the title sequence, a tradition dating back to The Macra Terror of 1967, until the 2012 Christmas Special and the second part of the 7th series. Both the TV Movie that followed this, and the revived series of 2005 until September 2012, had title sequences featuring a \\"time tunnel\\" effect, differing in style from time to time. This effect actually served in-universe as the time-vortex. =Cast notes= The part of Karra in this serial is played by Lisa Bowerman, who is now more familiar to fans as the voice of Bernice Summerfield in the Big Finish Productions audio dramas. She is also a director of many Big Finish productions, and also returned to the Doctor Who series proper when she provided voice-acting work for the animated special Dreamland in 2009. This serial features guest appearances of the comedians Gareth Hale and Norman Pace, and actress Adele Silva (as an 8-year old, in her first television role). See also Celebrity appearances in Doctor Who. Broadcast and reception There was no direct indication given to the public that this was to be the final regular instalment of Doctor Who; however, unlike previous years' final episodes, this one featured no announcement in the closing credits that the programme would return the following year. Reviewing Survival, David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker described it as \\"a very good story\\", with a script that contains \\"highly imaginative and original concepts\\".Howe, David, Walker, Stephen James. Doctor Who : The Television Companion. London : BBC Worldwide, 1999. (pp. 536-37). They also expressed admiration for the special effects used for the Cheetah People's planet, calling them \\"superb electronic video effects\\". Ainley's performance was also praised, with the reviewers stating it was \\"deadly serious and implacably evil, but with occasional flashes of dark humour\\". While stating that it was \\"deeply regrettable\\" that the original series of Doctor Who had to end with Survival, they added \\"that it went out on such a high note is, however, something to be thankful for\\". The serial was also positively received by Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, who praised Anthony Ainley's performance and considered the show to be \\"a great end to the series\\" with \\"an epic quality\\". Commercial releases =In print= A novelisation of this serial, written by Rona Munro, was published by Target Books in October 1990, making Munro the third woman to write a Doctor Who novelisation. A reprint edition was one of several possible books included with a 2007 issue of Doctor Who Magazine. =Home media= Survival was released on VHS in October 1995. It was released on DVD on 16 April 2007 as a 2-disc set. This serial was released as part of the Doctor Who DVD Files collection, in issue 51, published 15 December 2010. =Soundtrack release= The music from this serial composed by Dominic Glynn was first released on CD 15 September 2017.

Home improvement can consist of projects that upgrade an existing home interior (such as electrical and plumbing), exterior (masonry, concrete, siding, roofing), or other improvements to the property (i.e. garden work or garage maintenance/additions). Types of home improvement While \\"home improvement\\" often refers to building projects that alter the structure of an existing home, it can also include improvements to lawns, gardens, and outdoor structures, such as gazebos and garages. It also encompasses maintenance, repair, and general servicing tasks. Home improvement projects generally have one or more of the following goals: =Comfort= *Upgrading heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC). *Upgrading rooms with luxuries, such as adding gourmet features to a kitchen or a hot tub spa to a bathroom. *Increasing the capacity of plumbing and electrical systems. *Waterproofing basements. *Soundproofing rooms, especially bedrooms and baths. =Maintenance and repair= Maintenance projects can include: *Roof tear-off and replacement. *Replacement or new construction windows. *Concrete and masonry repairs to the foundation and chimney. *Repainting rooms, walls or fences *Repairing plumbing and electrical systems *Wall papers *Furniture polish =Additional space= Additional living space may be added by: *Turning marginal areas into livable spaces such as turning basements into recrooms, home theaters, or home offices ‚Äì or attics into spare bedrooms. *Extending one's house with rooms added to the side of one's home or, sometimes, extra levels to the original roof. Such a new unit of construction is called an \\"add-on\\". =Saving energy= Homeowners may reduce utility costs with: *Energy-efficient thermal insulation, replacement windows, and lighting. *Renewable energy with biomass pellet stoves, wood-burning stoves, solar panels, wind turbines, programmable thermostats,Use a Programmable Thermostat, Common Sense, to Reduce Energy Bills, Brett Freeman, oldhouseweb.com and geothermal exchange heat pumps (see autonomous building). =Safety and preparedness= Emergency preparedness safety measures such as: *Home fire and burglar alarm systems. *Fire sprinkler systems to protect homes from fires. *Security doors, windows, and shutters. *Storm cellars as protection from tornadoes and hurricanes. *Bomb shelters especially during the 1950s as protection from nuclear war. *Backup generators for providing power during power outages. Home improvement industry Home or residential renovation is an almost $300 billion industry in the United States,Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 2007 and a $48 billion industry in Canada. The average cost per project is $3,000 in the United States and $11,000‚Äì15,000 in Canada. Professional home improvement is ancient and goes back to the beginning of recorded civilization. One example is Sergius Orata, who in the 1st century B.C. is said by the writer Vitruvius (in his famous book De architectura) to have invented the hypocaust. The hypocaust is an underfloor heating system that was used throughout the Roman empire in villas of the wealthy. He is said to have become wealthy himself by buying villas at a low price, adding spas and his newly invented hypocaust, and reselling them at higher prices. =Renovation contractors= Perhaps the most important or visible professionals in the renovation industry are renovation contractors or skilled trades. These are the builders that have specialized credentials, licensing and experience to perform renovation services in specific municipalities. While there is a fairly large ‚Äògrey market‚Äô of unlicensed companies, there are those that have membership in a reputable association and/or are accredited by a professional organization. Homeowners are recommended to perform checks such as verifying license and insurance and checking business references prior to hiring a contractor to work on their house. =Aggregators= Aggregators are companies that bundle home improvement service offers and act as intermediary agency between service providers and customers. In popular culture Home improvement was popularized on television in 1979 with the premiere of This Old House starring Bob Vila on PBS. American cable channel HGTV features many do-it-yourself shows, as does sister channel DIY Network. Danny Lipford hosts and produces the nationally syndicated Today's Homeowner with Danny Lipford. Tom Kraeutler and Leslie Segrete co-host the nationally syndicated The Money Pit Home Improvement Radio Show. Movies that poked fun at the difficulties involved include: Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), starring Cary Grant and Myrna Loy; George Washington Slept Here (1942), featuring Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan; and The Money Pit (1986), with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. The sitcom Home Improvement used the home improvement theme for comedic purposes.

The same sacrificial pattern was echoed in a number of later games, notably Nimzowitsch-Tarrasch, St Petersburg 1914; Miles-Browne, Lucerne 1982; and Polgar-Karpov, Seventh Essent 2003. The game against Bauer was played at the beginning of Lasker's career in the first round of the 1889 Amsterdam tournament, Lasker's first high-level closed event. Lasker finished second with a 6/8 score, a point behind the winner Amos Burn, and ahead of James Mason and Isidor Gunsberg, among others. Bauer finished sixth of the nine participants with a score of 3¬Ω/8. A similar sacrifice occurred earlier in Burn‚ÄìOwen, 1884, but in this case the sacrifice by John Owen was not correct and he lost the game. Nevertheless, it may have been an inspiration for Lasker.

White's strategic ideas involve control of the e5-square, offering good attacking chances at the expense of slightly weakening his own . Black may challenge White's plan to control e5 immediately by playing From's Gambit (1...e5); however, the From Gambit is notoriously double-edged and should only be played after significant study. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings assigns two codes for Bird's Opening: A02 (1.f4) and A03 (1.f4 d5). History The opening was mentioned by Luis Ram√≠rez de Lucena in his book Repetici√≥n de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez con Cien Juegos de Partido, published c. 1497. In the mid-nineteenth century the opening was sometimes played by La Bourdonnais and Elijah Williams, among others. The British master Henry Edward Bird first played it in 1855 and continued to do so for the next 40 years.\\"Having forgotten familiar openings, I commenced adopting KBP for first move, and finding it led to highly interesting games out of the usual groove, I became partial to it.\\" ‚Äî Henry Bird (1873, entering match play after a six year absence from chess); Hooper and Whyld (1987), p. 32. In 1885, the Hereford Times named it after him.Hooper and Whyld (1992), p. 40. In the first half of the 20th century Aron Nimzowitsch and Savielly Tartakower sometimes played 1.f4.de Firmian (2008), p. 732. In more recent decades, grandmasters who have used the Bird's with any regularity include Bent Larsen, Andrew Soltis, Lars Karlsson, Mikhail Gurevich, and Henrik Danielsen. 1...d5 Black's most common response is 1...d5, when the game can take on the character of a Dutch Defence (1.d4 f5) with colours reversed. White will then often either fianchetto his with Nf3, g3, Bg2, and 0-0 with a reversed Leningrad Dutch; adopt a Stonewall formation with pawns on d4, e3, and f4 and attempt a attack; or fianchetto his to increase his hold on the e5-square. Another strategy, by analogy with the Ilyin‚ÄìZhenevsky variation of the Dutch Defence, involves White playing Nf3, e3, Be2, 0-0, d3 and attempting to achieve the break e3‚Äìe4 by various means, e.g. Ne5, Bf3, Qe2 and finally e3‚Äìe4, or simply Nc3 followed by e4. Timothy Taylor's book on Bird's Opening suggests as a main line: 1.f4 d5 2.Nf3 g6 3.e3 Bg7 4.Be2 Nf6 5.0-0 0-0 6.d3 c5. White can also play 2.c4, the Mujannah-Sturm gambit. This is a decent opening and seems to borrow ideas from the R√©ti Opening (1.Nf3 d5 2.c4) and the Queen's Gambit Accepted. Eventually, this move order is followed by Nf3. The best move in this position is 2...d4, where the game continues in the style of the R√©ti Opening, with 3.Nf3 being a possible next move. 2.c4 is not a true gambit, since if Black tries to hold on to his pawn, he will be punished (2.c4 dxc4 3.e3 b5 [Black should pursue development instead] 4.a4 c6? 5.axb5 cxb5 6.Qf3, where Black must part with a , akin to the Queen's Gambit Accepted trap). From's Gambit: 1...e5  Black's reply is 1...e5, From's Gambit, named for the Danish chess player Martin Severin From (1828‚Äì1895). White then has the option to transpose into the King's Gambit with 2.e4. This is an important option which may cause Black to consider playing a different line if he wishes to avoid the King's Gambit. It has been observed that one of the possible disadvantages of From's Gambit is that it is very easy for White to avoid. If White accepts the gambit with 2.fxe5, Black must choose between the main line 2...d6 and the rather obscure 2...Nc6. After 2...Nc6, International Master (IM) Timothy Taylor, in his 2005 book on the Bird's, recommends 3.Nc3 Nxe5 4.d4 intending 5.e4, rather than 3.Nf3 g5! when Black stands well.Taylor (2005), p. 182. After the normal 2...d6 3.exd6 Bxd6, White must play 4.Nf3, avoiding 4.Nc3 Qh4+ 5.g3 Qxg3+ 6.hxg3 Bxg3 checkmate. Then Black again has two alternatives: 4...g5 to drive away White's knight, and 4...Nf6, threatening 5...Ng4 and 6...Nxh2! Future world champion Emanuel Lasker introduced 4...g5 in the game Bird‚ÄìLasker, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1892, so it is known as \\"Lasker's Variation\\".Taylor (2005), pp. 150‚Äì51. Taylor considers 4...g5 dubious; a quiet response that he considers favourable for White is 5.d4 g4 6.Ne5! (6.Ng5 leads to a dubious piece sacrifice) Bxe5 7.dxe5 Qxd1+ 8.Kxd1 Nc6 9.Nc3! Be6 (9...Nxe5?! 10.Bf4 f6 11.Nd5 Kd8 12.Nxf6!) 10.Bf4 0-0-0+ 11.Ke1 Nge7 12.e3 Ng6 13.Bg5 Rdf8 14.Bf6 Rhg8 15.Be2 Ngxe5 16.Rf1 \\"with the typical edge for White that is characteristic of this variation\\", according to Taylor.Taylor (2005), pp. 149‚Äì52. He also considers the sharper 5.g3 g4 6.Nh4 favourable for White, giving as the main line 6...Ne7 7.d4 Ng6 8.Nxg6 hxg6 9.Qd3 Nc6 (9...Rh5 10.Bg2; 9...Na6 10.c3) 10.c3 (10.Nc3? Nxd4! 11.Qxd4?? Bxg3+ wins White's queen) Bf5 (10...Qe7 11.Bg2! Bd7 12.Nd2 0-0-0 13.Ne4! favoured White in Taylor‚ÄìBecerra Rivero, Minneapolis 2005) 11.e4 Qe7 12.Bg2 0-0-0 13.Be3. According to Taylor, White has a large advantage in all lines, although play remains extremely sharp, e.g. 13...Rde8 14.Nd2; 13...Rxh2 14.Rxh2 Bxg3+ 15.Kd1 Bxh2 16.exf5! Re8 17.fxg6! Qxe3 18.Qxe3 Rxe3 19.gxf7; or 13...Bd7 (threatening 14...Rxh2!) 14.Bf2!Taylor (2005), pp. 135‚Äì45. Other Black responses * The flexible 1...Nf6 is also possible. Then if White plays 2.b3?! (2.Nf3 is safer), 2...d6! 3.Bb2?! (or 3.Nf3 e5! 4.fxe5 dxe5 5.Nxe5?? Qd4!) e5!, a sort of From's Gambit Deferred introduced by IM Michael Brooks, is dangerous for White, e.g. 4.fxe5 dxe5 5.Bxe5 Ng4! Then 6.Bb2 Bd6 \\"leaves White in huge trouble down the e1‚Äìh4 diagonal\\", and Black wins an after 7.Nf3 Bxh2! 8.Rxh2 Nxh2. After the alternative 6.Bg3, 6...Qf6! (even better than 6...Bd6) 7.c3 (not 7.Nc3? Ne3! 8.dxe3 Bb4) Bd6 is strong for Black.Palliser (2006), p. 124. * Another popular response is 1...g6, a sort of Modern Defense, which may transpose into a reversed Dutch Defense (if Black plays ...d5 and ...c5), or a Sicilian Defence (if White plays e4 and Black plays ...c5). Black thus prevents White from playing on the a1‚Äìh8 diagonal. * Also reasonable is 1...c5, hoping for a transposition into the Tal Gambit, a favourable variation of the Sicilian Defence, after 2.e4 d5! 3.exd5 (3.Nc3, the mellifluously named \\"Toilet Variation,\\" is also possible) 3...Nf6, but White need not oblige, and may build up more slowly with 2.Nf3, followed by g3, Bg2, d3, and possibly a later e4. * The offbeat 1...b6!? is also known, and more soundly based than the same move after 1.e4 or 1.d4, since 1.f4 does not aid White's , and weakens the a8‚Äìh1 diagonal as the move f3 is no longer available to shore up White's . Taylor recommends 2.e4 Bb7 3.d3 e6 4.Nf3 Ne7 5.c3 d5 6.Qc2 Nd7 7.Be3, with a spatial advantage for White.Taylor (2005), pp. 202‚Äì03. * Also possible is 1...b5!?, a form of the Polish Defense. After the natural 2.e4 Bb7, White has no good way to protect e4 while maintaining his attack on b5, since 3.Nc3? b4 4.Nd5 e6 wins a pawn. * If Black chooses the symmetrical reply 1...f5, Taylor considers White's best line to be quiet play with 2.b3 b6 3.Bb2 Bb7 4.e3, when 4...Nf6 5.Bxf6! exf6 6.Nf3 left White with the better pawn structure in Larsen‚ÄìColon Romero, San Juan 1969. Instead, 4...e6 5.Qh5+ forces the weakening 5...g6, with a slight advantage to White according to Taylor.Taylor (2005), p. 210. Also possible is the aggressive 2.e4!?, when Taylor analyses 2...fxe4 3.d3 exd3 4.Bxd3 Nf6 5.Nf3 (5.g4 is well met by 5...d5, when after 6.g5, 6...Bg4 and 6...Ne4 both favour Black) 5...d5 6.0-0, when he considers White to have some, but not enough, compensation for the sacrificed pawn.Taylor (2005), pp. 214‚Äì16. Another possible continuation is 2...fxe4 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.g4, the Swiss Gambit. This gambit was named by Alexander Wagner (1868‚Äì1942), a Polish chess player and openings analyst who introduced it in the Swiss correspondence game Wagner‚ÄìKostin, 1910‚Äì11. The term \\"Swiss Gambit\\" is often used to refer more generally to 1.f4 f5 2.e4. Chess historian Edward Winter has criticized that usage, pointing out that 1.f4 f5 2.e4 was analysed by F.A. Lange in the June 1859 Deutsche Schachzeitung, and was played by many players, including Adolf Anderssen, in the nineteenth century.Edward Winter, 'The Swiss Gambit' (1998). * An aggressive but rare response is 1...g5?!, the Hobbs Gambit, with play possibly continuing 2.fxg5 h6, a sort of mirror image Benko Gambit. White can simply return the pawn with 3.g6, leaving Black with a weakened after 3...fxg6. A variant is the Hobbs‚ÄìZilbermints Gambit, 1...h6 intending 2...g5; against this, White could proceed with 2.e4 g5 3.d4, when Black has lost time and weakened his kingside. * Another offbeat try is Martin Appleberry's 1...Nh6!? The idea is to meet 2.b3 with 2...e5, another deferred From Gambit, and 2.e4 with 2...d5, when 3.exd5 Qxd5 would result in a Scandinavian Defense where White's pawn is oddly placed on f4. However, 2.Nf3 avoids both of these lines. * Another possible reply by Black is 1...Nc6. With this move, Black lays the support for the advance of the e-pawn. The general sequence of moves that Black may opt for is ...g6, ...Bg7 and ...d6 and eventually advance the e-pawn. * Another possible reply is 1...e6. This exploits the weakness created by 1.f4 on the e1‚Äìh4 diagonal by releasing the queen, and also releases the without gambitting a pawn, unlike the From Gambit. White should avoid playing 2.g4?? as it leads to 2...Qh4# (a variation of the Fool's Mate). 2.e4 transposes to the La Bourdonnais Variation of the French Defense (the normal order being 1.e4 e6 2.f4). Popularity Out of the twenty possible opening moves, 1.f4 ranks sixth in popularity in Chessgames.com's database, behind 1.e4, 1.d4, 1.Nf3, 1.c4, and 1.g3. It is less than one-twentieth as popular as the mirror image English Opening (1.c4). The move 1.f4 slightly weakens White's king's position.Adorj√°n (1998), p. 27. Chessgames.com's statistics indicate that the opening is not an effective way of preserving White's first- move advantage: as of February 2013, out of 3,872 games with 1.f4, White had won 30.7%, drawn 32%, and lost 37.7%, for a total score of 46.7%.White's overall winning percentage is calculated by taking the percentage of games won by White and adding half of the percentage of drawn games, in this case 32.8 plus half of 25.3. White scores much better with the more popular 1.e4 (54.25%), 1.d4 (55.95%), 1.Nf3 (55.8%), 1.c4 (56.3%), and 1.g3 (55.8%). According to the similar site 365chess.com, which includes data for lower- level games, as of August 2015, out of 20,010 games with 1.f4, White had won 35.1%, drawn 25%, and lost 39.9%, for a total score of 47.6%.http://www.365chess.com/opening.php The five more popular openings are still substantially more successful for White: 1.e4 (53.15%), 1.d4 (54.8%), 1.Nf3 (55.4%), 1.c4 (54.65%), and 1.g3 (54.9%).

The Anabasis (which survives complete in seven books) is a history of the campaigns of Alexander the Great, specifically his conquest of the Persian Empire between 336 and 323 BC. Both the unusual title \\"Anabasis\\" (literally \\"a journey up-country from the sea\\") and the work's seven-book structure reflect Arrian's emulation (in structure, style, and content) of the Greek historian Xenophon, whose own Anabasis in seven books concerning the earlier campaign \\"up-country\\" of Cyrus the Younger in 401 BC. The Anabasis is by far the fullest surviving account of Alexander's conquest of the Persian empire. It is primarily a military history, reflecting the content of Arrian's model, Xenophon's Anabasis; the work begins with Alexander's accession to the Macedonian throne in 336 BC, and has nothing to say about Alexander's early life (in contrast, say, to Plutarch's Life of Alexander). Nor does Arrian aim to provide a complete history of the Greek-speaking world during Alexander's reign. Arrian's chief sources in writing the Anabasis were the lost contemporary histories of the campaign by Ptolemy and Aristobulus and, for his later books, Nearchus. One of Arrian's main aims in writing his history seems to have been to correct the standard \\"Vulgate\\" narrative of Alexander's reign that was current in his own day, primarily associated with the lost writings of the historian Cleitarchus. Content Alexandri anabasis, 1575 The Anabasis gives a broadly chronological account of the reign of Alexander the Great of Macedon (336‚Äì323 BC), with a particular focus on military matters. After a short Preface concerning Arrian's sources, Book 1 covers the early years of Alexander's reign (336‚Äì334 BC), including notable descriptions of Alexander's sack of Thebes in 335 and the battle of the Granicus in summer 334 BC. Book 2 is dominated by three large set-piece military operations: the campaign and battle of Issus (333 BC) and the sieges of Tyre and Gaza (332 BC). Book 3 begins with an account of Alexander in Egypt, including his visit to the oracle of Zeus-Ammon at Siwah (winter 332/331 BC), before turning to the battle of Gaugamela and defeat of Darius III (331 BC). The latter half of the book describes Alexander's pursuit of Darius through northern Iran, the revolt of the pretender Bessus, and the deaths of Philotas and Parmenion (331-329 BC). Book 4 describes the long Sogdian campaign of 329-327 BC against Bessus, Spitamenes, and Oxyartes, and the early stages of the campaigns in the Punjab (327-326 BC), with a notable departure from chronological sequence at 4.7-14, where Arrian collects many of the most notorious stories tending to Alexander's discredit in a single apologetic digression (the killing of Cleitus, the proskynesis affair, the pages' conspiracy and the death of Callisthenes). Book 5 continues the narrative of the Indian campaign of 326 BC, including Alexander's arrival at Nysa, the battle with Porus at the Hydaspes river, and the decision at the Hyphasis not to push on further into India. Book 6 describes the journey down the Indus to the Indian Ocean (326-325 BC), including the increasingly brutal violence inflicted on the local inhabitants by the Macedonians en route (notably at the Malli town), and the crossing of the Gedrosian Desert (325-324 BC). Book 7 recounts the events of Alexander's final year, including the Susa marriages, the Opis mutiny, the death of Hephaestion, and Alexander's own death (324-323 BC).  Criticism  Arrian's Anabasis has traditionally been regarded as the most reliable extant narrative source for Alexander's campaigns. Since the 1970s, however, a more critical view of Arrian has become widespread, due largely to the work of A. B. Bosworth, who has drawn scholars' attention to Arrian's tendency to hagiography and apologia, not to mention several passages where Arrian can be shown (by comparison with other ancient sources) to be downright misleading. Modern editions The only complete English translation of Arrian available online is a rather antiquated translation by E.J. Chinnock, published in 1884.

He was a Tennessee state senator from 1959 to 1961 and again from 1967 to 2009. Tennesseans do not elect their lieutenant governor; rather, the Speaker of the Senate, who is first in the line of succession to the governor, is granted the title by statute. Early life and education Wilder was from Fayette County, near Memphis. He was from an affluent family with extensive agricultural and agribusiness interests. He attended Fayette County Public Schools and received an undergraduate degree from the University of Tennessee College of Agriculture and a law degree from Memphis State University, now the University of Memphis. He and his family were known for fairer dealings with African American farm employees and tenants than was typical of the area during the segregation era. This fact served him very well upon entering into elective politics at about the time that Tennessee blacks in rural areas were first being allowed their constitutional rights to participate in political decisions which had been guaranteed under the Tennessee and federal constitutions but previously unenforced. Wilder was also a prominent attorney in Somerville, the county seat of Fayette County. Wilder married his wife Marcelle in 1941 and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Political career He was a member of the former Fayette County Quarterly Court (now the County Commission) for 18 years.Richard Locker, Lambuth institute will salute Wilder's works; College to house papers, train students for service, Memphis Commercial Appeal, May 22, 2007 A Democrat, he was first elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1958, serving until January 1961. Wilder did not run for reelection in 1960, but returned to the state Senate in 1967. After this time, a state constitutional amendment extended the length of terms in the state Senate to four years. Wilder was elected to a four-year term in 1968 and was reelected every four years thereafter until 2008. He represented Senate District 26, which currently included Chester, Crockett, Fayette, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, McNairy, and Wayne counties. Lieutenant Governor Wilder was elected Speaker of the State Senate by his fellow Senators in January 1971, which made him the state's Lieutenant Governor. Under the Tennessee state constitution, the Speaker of the Senate is first in line of succession to the governorship. The title of Lieutenant Governor was granted to the Speaker of the Senate by statute in 1951. He was the first Tennessee Lieutenant Governor in almost half a century, and only the second since Reconstruction, to serve under a governor of a different political party, Republican Winfield Dunn, who had been elected the previous November. Prior to this time, the General Assembly had never had its own independent staff, or even its own offices, frequently working out of hotel rooms. Wilder now oversaw a massive building project (which somewhat ironically entailed the demolition of one of the hotels that many legislators had previously favored) which was undertaken to correct this and make the legislative branch of state government more co-equal to the other two. Wilder defied precedent by seeking to serve as lieutenant governor for an extended period. Previously, no one had served more than three consecutive terms as Speaker of the Senate since Tennessee's current constitution was adopted in 1870. He faced little opposition until the mid-1980s. By then, many of the members of the Senate Democratic Caucus had tired of his leadership. There were also regional issues at stake ‚Äì by this time the speakers of both houses of the legislature had been from West Tennessee for almost two decades. The dissident faction coalesced around the leadership of State Senate Majority Leader Riley Darnell from Clarksville in Middle Tennessee. When Darnell received the Democratic nomination for Lieutenant Governor in 1987, Wilder's long tenure as Lieutenant Governor appeared to be over. However, in a surprise (but not entirely unprecedented) move, Wilder was then nominated by the Republican Caucus for Lieutenant Governor. With the support of all 15 Republicans in the chamber, and six dissenting Democrats, Wilder won the vote 21 ‚Äì 15 and then proceeded to organize the Senate on a \\"bipartisan\\" basis, awarding a majority of the committee chairmanships to his Democratic loyalists with the remainder going to the Republicans. This was not out of character for Wilder; in 1979 he had acquiesced in the ouster of Governor Ray Blanton three days before his term was supposed to end after a series of controversial pardons. The state constitution is somewhat ambiguous on when a governor is supposed to be sworn in, so Wilder and his counterpart in the State House, Ned McWherter, supported the early swearing-in of his Republican successor, Lamar Alexander. Wilder called the move \\"impeachment, Tennessee style.\\" After this, Wilder, until 2005, continued to be reelected \\"unanimously\\" and to award chairmanships to his supporters in both parties, making the Tennessee Senate one of the few legislative bodies in the world to be elected on a partisan basis, but organized on a more-or-less nonpartisan one. Even when two outgoing state Senators switched parties in the mid-1990s, giving the Republicans a short- lived one-seat Senate majority, nothing of consequence changed. This coalition had made Wilder one of the longest-serving (reputedly the longest) freely- elected legislative leaders in the world. Given his support among many Republican state senators, he long faced little opposition in holding onto his State Senate seat, even though the Memphis suburbs were becoming increasingly Republican. In much of his district, he was the only elected Democrat above the county level by the turn of the millennium. Unlike many lieutenant governors, particularly in other states, Wilder never ran for governor. In 2009 he said that he had wanted to run for governor in 1974, but had been talked out of it by his family, and was \\"glad I stayed where I was because the Senate is the Senate.\\"Bartholomew Sullivan, Bipartisan praise hails Wilder in Washington, Memphis Commercial Appeal, June 3, 2009 Wilder was a cycling enthusiast and was a licensed private pilot for over a half-century, continuing occasionally until the end of his legislative career to fly himself 200 miles (320 km) from Fayette County to Nashville for legislative meetings.AOPA member retains Lieutenant Governor post , Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, January 20, 2005John Wilder: Senate icon, one of a kind, Memphis Commercial Appeal, March 24, 2008 Two Republican members of the Tennessee State Senate ‚Äì enough to assure Wilder's reelection provided his traditional unanimous Democratic support in recent years ‚Äì voted for Wilder on January 11, 2005, and he was sworn in for his 18th term as lieutenant governor. (One of them, Micheal Williams, was then rewarded with the post of Speaker pro Tempore.) Wilder then appointed Republican majorities to seven of the nine committees but left the five existing Democratic chairmen in place; this resulted in Democratic majorities and chairs on two committees, including what is regarded as the most important one, the Finance Committee, which left many Republicans very upset. Following the November 2006 elections, the Republican Party retained a one-seat majority in the Tennessee Senate. However, Republicans who had supported Wilder in the past, particularly Williams, found themselves under severe pressure to adhere to party discipline, with even the threat of officially-endorsed primary opponents, unprecedented for Tennessee Republicans, for those who failed to comply with the party line, according to a series of columns by Tennessean columnist Larry Daughtrey. Wilder was challenged within the Democratic caucus for nomination as speaker by State Senator Joe Haynes of Nashville. Later articles in The Tennessean and the Nashville City Paper cited the possibility that all 16 Republicans might vote for Senator Ron Ramsey of Blountville and that 16 Democrats, including Wilder himself, would vote for Wilder, with Democratic State Senator Jerry Cooper, accused of wrongful business dealings with a bank controlled by Wilder, abstaining to prevent any appearance of conflict of interest. Under Senate rules, a 16‚Äì16 tie would result in Wilder's retention of the speakership. However, in the vote held on January 9, 2007, all 17 Republicans voted for Ramsey and were joined by Democratic Senator Rosalind Kurita of Clarksville, ending Wilder's tenure as Speaker of the Senate and Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee.Lucas L. Johnson II, Longest-Serving Legislative Chief Ousted Associated Press, January 9, 2007; accessed on San Francisco Chronicle website, October 19, 2009 On March 8, 2007, the Tennessee news media reported that Wilder had been seriously injured in a fall and was in intensive care in a hospital in Memphis. He was released from the hospital on March 11, 2007 and returned home to finish his recuperation.http://wkrn.com/nashville/news/sen-wilder-released-from- hospital/82852.htm In February 2008, the 2007-08 edition of the Tennessee Blue Book was dedicated to him. On March 20, 2008, Wilder announced his decision not to run for re-election later that year.\\"Wilder to retire after nearly 50 years\\", Knoxville News Sentinel, March 20, 2008 Death Wilder died early on the morning of January 1, 2010 at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis following a stroke on December 28, 2009.

It may be used both to disinfect the skin of the patient and the hands of the healthcare providers. It is also used for cleaning wounds, preventing dental plaque, treating yeast infections of the mouth, and to keep urinary catheters from blocking. It is used as a liquid or powder. Side effects may include skin irritation, teeth discoloration, and allergic reactions. It may cause eye problems if direct contact occurs. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. Chlorhexidine may come mixed in alcohol, water, or surfactant solution. It is effective against a range of microorganisms, but does not inactivate spores. Chlorhexidine came into medical use in the 1950s. Chlorhexidine is available over the counter (OTC) in the United States. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 286th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than one million prescriptions.  Uses  Chlorhexidine is used in disinfectants (disinfection of the skin and hands), cosmetics (additive to creams, toothpaste, deodorants, and antiperspirants), and pharmaceutical products (preservative in eye drops, active substance in wound dressings and antiseptic mouthwashes). A 2019 Cochrane review concluded that based on very low certainty evidence in those who are critical ill \\"it is not clear whether bathing with chlorhexidine reduces hospital‚Äêacquired infections, mortality, or length of stay in the ICU, or whether the use of chlorhexidine results in more skin reactions.\\" In endodontics, chlorhexidine is used for root canal irrigation and as an intracanal dressing,Raab D: Preparation of contaminated root canal systems ‚Äì the importance of antimicrobial irrigants.

CHG is active against Gram-positive and Gram- negative organisms, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, and yeasts. It is particularly effective against Gram-positive bacteria (in concentrations ‚â• 1 Œºg/l). Significantly higher concentrations (10 to more than 73 Œºg/ml) are required for Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Chlorhexidine is ineffective against polioviruses and adenoviruses. The effectiveness against herpes viruses has not yet been established unequivocally. Chlorhexidine, like other cation-active compounds, remains on the skin. It is frequently combined with alcohols (ethanol and isopropyl alcohol). = Dental use = Perichlor brand 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate solution Use of a CHG-based mouthwash in combination with normal tooth care can help reduce the build-up of plaque and improve mild gingivitis. There is not enough evidence to determine the effect in moderate to severe gingivitis. About 20 mL twice a day of concentrations of 0.1% to 0.2% is recommended for mouth-rinse solutions with a duration of at least 30 seconds. Such mouthwash also has a number of adverse effects including damage to the mouth lining, tooth discoloration, tartar build-up, and impaired taste. Extrinsic tooth staining occurs when chlorhexidine rinse has been used for 4 weeks or longer. Mouthwashes containing chlorhexidine which stain teeth less than the classic solution have been developed, many of which contain chelated zinc. Using chlorhexidine as a supplement to everyday mechanical oral hygiene procedures for 4 to 6 weeks and 6 months leads to a moderate reduction in gingivitis compared to placebo, control or mechanical oral hygiene alone. Chlorhexidine is a cation which interacts with anionic components of toothpaste, such as sodium lauryl sulfate and sodium monofluorophosphate, and forms salts of low solubility and antibacterial activity. Hence, to enhance the antiplaque effect of chlorhexidine, \\"it seems best that the interval between toothbrushing and rinsing with CHX [chlorhexidine] be more than 30 minutes, cautiously close to 2 hours after brushing.\\". = Topical = Nepal was the first country in the world to use chlorhexidine to treat the umbilical cord of newborn babies, and received a USAID Pioneers Prize for reducing the neonatal death rate. Chlorhexidine is very effective for poor countries like Nepal and its use is growing in the world for treating the umbilical cord. A 2015 Cochrane review has yielded high-quality evidence that within the community setting, chlorhexidine skin or cord care can reduce the incidence of omphalitis (inflammation of the umbilical cord) by 50% and also neonatal mortality by 12%. Chlorhexidine gluconate is used as a skin cleanser for surgical scrubs, a cleanser for skin wounds, for preoperative skin preparation and germicidal hand rinses. Chlorhexidine eye drops have been used as a treatment for eyes affected by Acanthamoeba keratitis.  Side effects  CHG is ototoxic; if put into an ear canal which has a ruptured eardrum, it can lead to deafness. CHG does not meet current European specifications for a hand disinfectant. Under the test conditions of the European Standard EN 1499, no significant difference in the efficacy was found between a 4% solution of chlorhexidine digluconate and soap. In the U.S., between 2007 and 2009, Hunter Holmes McGuire Veterans Administration Medical Center conducted a cluster-randomized trial and concluded that daily bathing of patients in intensive care units with washcloths saturated with chlorhexidine gluconate reduced the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Whether prolonged exposure over many years may have carcinogenic potential is still not clear. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA recommendation is to limit the use of a chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash to a maximum of six months. When ingested, CHG is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and can cause stomach irritation or nausea. If aspirated into the lungs at high enough concentration, as reported in one case, it can be fatal due to the high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mechanism of action At physiologic pH, chlorhexidine salts dissociate and release the positively charged chlorhexidine cation. The bactericidal effect is a result of the binding of this cationic molecule to negatively charged bacterial cell walls. At low concentrations of chlorhexidine, this results in a bacteriostatic effect; at high concentrations, membrane disruption results in cell death. Chemistry It is a cationic polybiguanide (bisbiguanide). It is used primarily as its salts (e.g., the dihydrochloride, diacetate, and digluconate).  Deactivation  Chlorhexidine is deactivated by forming insoluble salts with anionic compounds, including the anionic surfactants commonly used as detergents in toothpastes and mouthwashes, anionic thickeners such as carbomer, and anionic emulsifiers such as acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, among many others. For this reason, chlorhexidine mouth rinses should be used at least 30 minutes after other dental products. For best effectiveness, food, drink, smoking, and mouth rinses should be avoided for at least one hour after use. Many topical skin products, cleansers, and hand sanitizers should also be avoided to prevent deactivation when chlorhexidine (as a topical by itself or as a residue from a cleanser) is meant to remain on the skin.  Synthesis  The structure is based on two molecules of proguanil, linked with a hexamethylenediamine spacer. Two routes for chlorhexidine synthesis: (1954 to I.C.I.). The compounds designated (...)2 are substituted hexanes.  Brands  Chlorhexidine topical is sold as Betasept, Biopatch, Calgon Vesta, ChloraPrep One-Step, Dyna-Hex, Hibiclens, Hibistat Towelette, Scrub Care Exidine, Spectrum-4 among others. Chlorhexidine gluconate mouth rinse is sold as Paroex, Peridex, PerioChip, Periogard, Dentohexin among others. Hexoralettene N contains benzocaine, menthol and chlorhexidine hydrochloride. It is used as oral antiseptic candies. Terminology The name \\"Chlorhexidine\\" breaks down as chlor(o) + hex(ane) + id(e) + (am)ine), is a cationic polybiguanide. It is used primarily as its gluconate salt.  Veterinary medicine  In animals, chlorhexidine is used for topical disinfection of wounds, and to manage skin infections. Chlorhexidine-based disinfectant products are used within the dairy farming industry. Post-surgical respiratory problems have been associated with the use of chlorhexidine products in cats.

In 1994 the two were joined by Grzegorz \\"Karcharoth\\" Jurgielewicz (previously of Infernum) and recorded The Celtic Winter, which was released as an EP by the German label No Colours Records.Graveland Biography , Music Might online, accessed on 30 January 2013. No Colours currently releases the band's new albums. = First albums = A few months later, the band's first album, Carpathian Wolves (recorded at the Radio PRO-FM Studio, Opole, 26 Apr ‚Äì 2 May 1994), was released by Eternal Devils Records. With Carpathian Wolves, the band drew the attention of several bigger metal labels and was eventually signed by the Austrian Lethal Records label, which released Thousand Swords. This album was recorded in December 1994 at Tuba Studio, Wroc≈Çaw, \\"in the days of eternal winter & frozen night of full moon, at the gates of a new era\\".Graveland: Thousand Swords, Lethal Records 1995. The Lethal Records release showed a progression in Graveland's sound from raw black metal to black metal with folk and Viking metal influence to it. The album is considered to be the band's best release by many fans and a classic in the black metal scene. After reportedly making several racist statements, the band was dropped by Lethal. Darken then founded his own label, Isengard (later Eastclan), and re-released an extended Thousand Swords on cassette. The album's booklet contains statements against Lethal Records and two other bigger metal labels, Osmose and Nuclear Blast.The Graveland song \\"Born for War\\" was released on Nuclear Blast's Soundcheck Series ‚Äì Volume 2 in 1995. In 1999, the album was re-released, again, by No Colours with another different album cover. In 2001, it was re-released for a second time by No Colours on CD and vinyl. The CD version had the logo in red and the vinyl version had a red logo. The CD and vinyl versions had different covers from each other. = Move towards folk = The band's third album, Following the Voice of Blood, was recorded 25 September 1996 - 18 December 1996 and released in 1997 via No Colours. With the 1998 album, Immortal Pride (strongly influenced by the movie soundtrack of Conan the Barbarian), the band took on a folk style, while moving more into Viking metal. Its sound became more epic, symphonic, and added more keyboards and chorales. The songs also became much longer. (For instance, Immortal Pride consists of four songs: two of them being the intro and outro; and the other ones being 24 and 17 minutes long.) In 2000, Raiders of Revenge (a split release with the band Honor), and Creed of Iron / Prawo Stali were released. Since Creed, Darken has worked without Capricornus on drums. In November 2015, it was announced that Rob Darken had assembled a live lineup and Graveland would play its very first live shows in April 2016. In February 22nd, 2018 the band released a re-recorded version of Dawn of Iron Blades with new keyboards, drums, bass, and female vocals. Their next album Hour of Ragnarok will be released in autumn 2020, the band made the announcement through the single \\"Possessed by Steel\\" which was released on digital platforms on April 14, 2020. Controversy Graveland is associated with the National Socialist black metal (NSBM) scene and generally seen as a National Socialist band.May 2006 Features, Decibel Magazine on-line, accessed on 22 September 2008. Rob Darken has openly glorified Adolf Hitler in interviews, one of several quotes from \\"Brangolf magazine\\" being: \\"Undoubtedly, the most striking personality of Europe was Adolf Hitler. What he tried to build deserves the greatest respect. They [the Nazis] realized the value of pure Aryan Europe. Hitler embodied the idea of an Empire of White People. Hitler discovered and realized the true destiny hidden in the blood of white people. The proud Aryan ancestors always went the way of the gods.\\"Brangolf magazine, Graveland interview, 2002, salute to Adolf Hitler Darken has said he rejects the Nazi label in English language interviews, and told Decibel magazine: \\"I do not think Graveland is an NSBM band. Graveland is regarded as a NSBM band because of my political convictions, [which] most people would call extreme right-wing, National Socialist convictions\\". In November 2016, anti-fascists held a protest against Graveland's planned show at the Messe des Morts metal festival in Montreal. It was to have been Graveland's first show in North America. The protesters clashed with police, and the festival had to be cut short for security reasons. \\"Anti-fascist protests force cancellation of Graveland gig\\".

AWIPS is a complex network of systems that ingests and integrates meteorological, hydrological, satellite, and radar data, and also processes and distributes the data to 135 Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and River Forecast Centers (RFCs) nationwide. Weather forecasters utilize the capabilities of AWIPS to make increasingly accurate weather, water, and climate predictions, and to dispense rapid, highly reliable warnings and advisories. The AWIPS system architectural design is driven by expandability, flexibility, availability, and portability. The system is easily expandable to allow for the introduction of new functionality and the augmentation of network and processing capabilities. AWIPS is designed so that software and data can be migrated to new platforms as technology evolves.NWS. ‚ÄúOverview of the AWIPS System.‚Äù http://www.crh.noaa.gov/lmk/?n=awipsoverview  History  AWIPS replaced the Automation of Field Operations and Services (AFOS) system which had become obsolete and was very difficult to maintain. AWIPS was originally developed and maintained by PRC, Inc (later acquired by Northrop Grumman Information Technology) with installation completed in 1998. Since 2005, Raytheon has been NWS‚Äô partner for the operations, maintenance and evolution of AWIPS, providing the integrated mission services required to sustain and enhance system performance. It is a five-year contract with five one-year award terms for a potential maximum 10-year contract.Raytheon Company. ‚ÄúAWIPS.‚Äù http://www.raytheon.com/capabilities/products/awips/ Teaming with Raytheon are Keane Federal Systems, Globecomm Systems Inc., GTSI Corp., ENSCO, Reston Consulting Group, Fairfield Technologies, and Earth Resources Technology. Together they provide software operations and maintenance, software development, hardware maintenance and logistics, commercial off-the-shelf software maintenance, satellite communications, and network monitoring and control.  Evolution  AWIPS equipment. As the architect of the AWIPS evolution, Raytheon designed, developed, and released the system's next- generation software known as AWIPS II. AWIPS II, which features a new service oriented architecture (SOA) began roll-out in late 2011. This new system simplified code and consequently strengthened system performance while reducing the maintenance burden. All of this is achieved while retaining a system look and feel that makes the AWIPS evolution appear similar to the user. The AWIPS program office is working in conjunction with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to incorporate the NAWIPS baseline software used by the NCEP centers, National Hurricane Center (NHC) / Aviation Weather Center (AWC) / Storm Prediction Center (SPC) as well as the Weather Prediction Center (formerly Hydrometeorological Prediction Center) and Ocean Prediction Center (WPC and OPC) into the AWIPSII baseline. The commissioning of a new AWIPS site, the first since the Huntsville Weather Forecast Office in 2002, will also be part of this effort at the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, CO.

To exist, the fluid must be stratified: the density must change (continuously or discontinuously) with depth/height due to changes, for example, in temperature and/or salinity. If the density changes over a small vertical distance (as in the case of the thermocline in lakes and oceans or an atmospheric inversion), the waves propagate horizontally like surface waves, but do so at slower speeds as determined by the density difference of the fluid below and above the interface. If the density changes continuously, the waves can propagate vertically as well as horizontally through the fluid. Internal waves, also called internal gravity waves, go by many other names depending upon the fluid stratification, generation mechanism, amplitude, and influence of external forces. If propagating horizontally along an interface where the density rapidly decreases with height, they are specifically called interfacial (internal) waves. If the interfacial waves are large amplitude they are called internal solitary waves or internal solitons. If moving vertically through the atmosphere where substantial changes in air density influences their dynamics, they are called anelastic (internal) waves. If generated by flow over topography, they are called Lee waves or mountain waves. If the mountain waves break aloft, they can result in strong warm winds at the ground known as Chinook winds (in North America) or Foehn winds (in Europe). If generated in the ocean by tidal flow over submarine ridges or the continental shelf, they are called internal tides. If they evolve slowly compared to the Earth's rotational frequency so that their dynamics are influenced by the Coriolis effect, they are called inertia gravity waves or, simply, inertial waves. Internal waves are usually distinguished from Rossby waves, which are influenced by the change of Coriolis frequency with latitude. Visualization of internal waves An internal wave can readily be observed in the kitchen by slowly tilting back and forth a bottle of salad dressing - the waves exist at the interface between oil and vinegar. Atmospheric internal waves can be visualized by wave clouds: at the wave crests air rises and cools in the relatively lower pressure, which can result in water vapor condensation if the relative humidity is close to 100%. Clouds that reveal internal waves launched by flow over hills are called lenticular clouds because of their lens-like appearance. Less dramatically, a train of internal waves can be visualized by rippled cloud patterns described as herringbone sky or mackerel sky. The outflow of cold air from a thunderstorm can launch large amplitude internal solitary waves at an atmospheric inversion. In northern Australia, these result in Morning Glory clouds, used by some daredevils to glide along like a surfer riding an ocean wave. Satellites over Australia and elsewhere reveal these waves can span many hundreds of kilometers. Undulations of the oceanic thermocline can be visualized by satellite because the waves increase the surface roughness where the horizontal flow converges, and this increases the scattering of sunlight (as in the image at the top of this page showing of waves generated by tidal flow through the Strait of Gibraltar). Buoyancy, reduced gravity and buoyancy frequency According to Archimedes principle, the weight of an immersed object is reduced by the weight of fluid it displaces. This holds for a fluid parcel of density \\\\rho surrounded by an ambient fluid of density \\\\rho_0. Its weight per unit volume is g(\\\\rho-\\\\rho_0), in which g is the acceleration of gravity. Dividing by a characteristic density, \\\\rho_{00}, gives the definition of the reduced gravity: :g^\\\\prime \\\\equiv g \\\\frac{\\\\rho-\\\\rho_0}{\\\\rho_{00}} If \\\\rho>\\\\rho_0, g^\\\\prime is positive though generally much smaller than g. Because water is much more dense than air, the displacement of water by air from a surface gravity wave feels nearly the full force of gravity (g^\\\\prime \\\\sim g). The displacement of the thermocline of a lake, which separates warmer surface from cooler deep water, feels the buoyancy force expressed through the reduced gravity. For example, the density difference between ice water and room temperature water is 0.002 the characteristic density of water. So the reduced gravity is 0.2% that of gravity. It is for this reason that internal waves move in slow-motion relative to surface waves. Whereas the reduced gravity is the key variable describing buoyancy for interfacial internal waves, a different quantity is used to describe buoyancy in continuously stratified fluid whose density varies with height as \\\\rho_0(z). Suppose a water column is in hydrostatic equilibrium and a small parcel of fluid with density \\\\rho_0(z_0) is displaced vertically by a small distance \\\\Delta z. The buoyant restoring force results in a vertical acceleration, given by(Sutherland 2010, pp 141-151) :\\\\frac{d^2 \\\\Delta z}{dt^2} = - g^\\\\prime = - g (\\\\rho_0(z_0)-\\\\rho_0(z_0+\\\\Delta z))/\\\\rho_0(z_0) \\\\simeq - g \\\\left(-\\\\frac{d\\\\rho_0}{dz} \\\\Delta z\\\\right)/\\\\rho_0(z_0) This is the spring equation whose solution predicts oscillatory vertical displacement about z_0 in time about with frequency given by the buoyancy frequency: : N = \\\\left(-\\\\frac{g}{\\\\rho_0} \\\\frac{d\\\\rho_0}{dz}\\\\right)^{1/2}. The above argument can be generalized to predict the frequency, \\\\omega, of a fluid parcel that oscillates along a line at an angle \\\\Theta to the vertical: :\\\\omega = N \\\\cos\\\\Theta. This is one way to write the dispersion relation for internal waves whose lines of constant phase lie at an angle \\\\Theta to the vertical. In particular, this shows that the buoyancy frequency is an upper limit of allowed internal wave frequencies. Mathematical modeling of internal waves The theory for internal waves differs in the description of interfacial waves and vertically propagating internal waves. These are treated separately below. =Interfacial waves= In the simplest case, one considers a two-layer fluid in which a slab of fluid with uniform density \\\\rho_1 overlies a slab of fluid with uniform density \\\\rho_2. Arbitrarily the interface between the two layers is taken to be situated at z=0. The fluid in the upper and lower layers are assumed to be irrotational. So the velocity in each layer is given by the gradient of a velocity potential, {\\\\vec{u}= abla\\\\phi,} and the potential itself satisfies Laplace's equation: : abla^2\\\\phi=0. Assuming the domain is unbounded and two- dimensional (in the x-z plane), and assuming the wave is periodic in x with wavenumber k>0, the equations in each layer reduces to a second-order ordinary differential equation in z. Insisting on bounded solutions the velocity potential in each layer is :\\\\phi_1(x,z,t) = A e^{-kz} \\\\cos(kx - \\\\omega t) and :\\\\phi_2(x,z,t) = A e^{kz} \\\\cos(kx - \\\\omega t), with A the amplitude of the wave and \\\\omega its angular frequency. In deriving this structure, matching conditions have been used at the interface requiring continuity of mass and pressure. These conditions also give the dispersion relation: :\\\\omega^2 = g^\\\\prime k in which the reduced gravity g^\\\\prime is based on the density difference between the upper and lower layers: :g^\\\\prime = \\\\frac{\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1}{\\\\rho_2+\\\\rho_1}\\\\, g, with g the Earth's gravity. Note that the dispersion relation is the same as that for deep water surface waves by setting g^\\\\prime=g. =Internal waves in uniformly stratified fluid= The structure and dispersion relation of internal waves in a uniformly stratified fluid is found through the solution of the linearized conservation of mass, momentum, and internal energy equations assuming the fluid is incompressible and the background density varies by a small amount (the Boussinesq approximation). Assuming the waves are two dimensional in the x-z plane, the respective equations are :\\\\partial_x u + \\\\partial_z w = 0 :\\\\rho_{00} \\\\partial_t u = - \\\\partial_x p :\\\\rho_{00} \\\\partial_t w = - \\\\partial_z p - \\\\rho g :\\\\partial_t \\\\rho = -w d\\\\rho_0/dz in which \\\\rho is the perturbation density, p is the pressure, and (u,w) is the velocity. The ambient density changes linearly with height as given by \\\\rho_0(z) and \\\\rho_{00}, a constant, is the characteristic ambient density. Solving the four equations in four unknowns for a wave of the form \\\\exp[i(kx+mz-\\\\omega t)] gives the dispersion relation :\\\\omega^2 = N^2 \\\\frac{k^2}{k^2+m^2} = N^2 \\\\cos^2\\\\Theta in which N is the buoyancy frequency and \\\\Theta=\\\\tan^{-1}(m/k) is the angle of the wavenumber vector to the horizontal, which is also the angle formed by lines of constant phase to the vertical. The phase velocity and group velocity found from the dispersion relation predict the unusual property that they are perpendicular and that the vertical components of the phase and group velocities have opposite sign: if a wavepacket moves upward to the right, the crests move downward to the right. Internal waves in the ocean Internal Wave trains around Trinidad, as seen from space Most people think of waves as a surface phenomenon, which acts between water (as in lakes or oceans) and the air. Where low density water overlies high density water in the ocean, internal waves propagate along the boundary. They are especially common over the continental shelf regions of the world oceans and where brackish water overlies salt water at the outlet of large rivers. There is typically little surface expression of the waves, aside from slick bands that can form over the trough of the waves. Internal waves are the source of a curious phenomenon called dead water, first reported in 1893 by the Norwegian oceanographer Fridtjof Nansen, in which a boat may experience strong resistance to forward motion in apparently calm conditions. This occurs when the ship is sailing on a layer of relatively fresh water whose depth is comparable to the ship's draft. This causes a wake of internal waves that dissipates a huge amount of energy. Properties of internal waves Internal waves typically have much lower frequencies and higher amplitudes than surface gravity waves because the density differences (and therefore the restoring forces) within a fluid are usually much smaller. Wavelengths vary from centimetres to kilometres with periods of seconds to hours respectively. The atmosphere and ocean are continuously stratified: potential density generally increases steadily downward. Internal waves in a continuously stratified medium may propagate vertically as well as horizontally. The dispersion relation for such waves is curious: For a freely-propagating internal wave packet, the direction of propagation of energy (group velocity) is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of wave crests and troughs (phase velocity). An internal wave may also become confined to a finite region of altitude or depth, as a result of varying stratification or wind. Here, the wave is said to be ducted or trapped, and a vertically standing wave may form, where the vertical component of group velocity approaches zero. A ducted internal wave mode may propagate horizontally, with parallel group and phase velocity vectors, analogous to propagation within a waveguide. At large scales, internal waves are influenced both by the rotation of the Earth as well as by the stratification of the medium. The frequencies of these geophysical wave motions vary from a lower limit of the Coriolis frequency (inertial motions) up to the Brunt‚ÄìV√§is√§l√§ frequency, or buoyancy frequency (buoyancy oscillations). Above the Brunt‚ÄìV√§is√§l√§ frequency, there may be evanescent internal wave motions, for example those resulting from partial reflection. Internal waves at tidal frequencies are produced by tidal flow over topography/bathymetry, and are known as internal tides. Similarly, atmospheric tides arise from, for example, non-uniform solar heating associated with diurnal motion. Onshore transport of planktonic larvae Cross-shelf transport, the exchange of water between coastal and offshore environments, is of particular interest for its role in delivering meroplanktonic larvae to often disparate adult populations from shared offshore larval pools.Botsford LW, Moloney CL, Hastings A, Largier JL, Powell TM, Higgins K, Quinn JF (1994) The influence of spatially and temporally varying oceanographic conditions on meroplanktonic metapopulations. Deep-Sea Research Part II 41:107‚Äì145 Several mechanisms have been proposed for the cross-shelf of planktonic larvae by internal waves. The prevalence of each type of event depends on a variety of factors including bottom topography, stratification of the water body, and tidal influences. =Internal tidal bores= Similarly to surface waves, internal waves change as they approach the shore. As the ratio of wave amplitude to water depth becomes such that the wave ‚Äúfeels the bottom,‚Äù water at the base of the wave slows down due to friction with the sea floor. This causes the wave to become asymmetrical and the face of the wave to steepen, and finally the wave will break, propagating forward as an internal bore.Defant A (1961) Physical Oceanography, 2nd edn.

It is a humorous take on role- playing games, based on the concept of munchkins (immature role-players, playing only to \\"win\\" by having the most powerful character possible). Munchkin won the 2001 Origins Award for Best Traditional Card Game, and is itself a spin-off of The Munchkin's Guide to Powergaming, a gaming humor book which also won an Origins Award in 2000. After the success of the original Munchkin game several expansion packs and sequels were published. Now available in 15 different languages, Munchkin accounted for more than 70% of the 2007 sales for Steve Jackson Games.  Gameplay  A game of Munchkin being played, with coins being used to denote levels. In Munchkin, all players start at level 1, with the goal of reaching level 10 (or level 20 in Epic Level games). Players primarily progress by killing monsters, and level up every time they kill a monster. However, players can freely use cards against monsters and other players during play, allowing them to either assist or to sabotage others during their turn. Each person's turn begins when they \\"kick down the door\\" by drawing a Door Card face-up. A Door Card can be one of the following types: a Monster Card, which the player must engage by fighting or fleeing; a Curse Card, which applies an effect; or an Item Card, Race Card, or Class Card, which the player adds to their hand. If the card drawn is not a Monster Card, the player can either \\"loot the room\\" by drawing a face-down door card and adding it to their hand, or \\"look for trouble\\" by playing a Monster Card from their hand to fight it. When fighting a monster, the total level of the player (and any supporting players) is weighed against the total level of the monster(s) to determine the victor. A successful player draws the listed amount of treasure cards and levels up either 1 or 2 levels, but an unsuccessful character must roll the dice to try and flee; players who fail to roll a five or six suffer the monster's negative effects (\\"Bad Stuff\\") or die. Should a player die, their turn immediately ends and they discard their hand, retaining their player level but drawing a new hand for equipment. Due to the highly competitive nature of the game and the presence of rule-breaking cards, players are encouraged to use unfair tactics against others, to act mercenary to further themselves at the expense of others, or to use cheat cards to affect outcomes (such as fixing the roll of the die). Throughout a player's turn, others are free to intervene: they can passively buff or debuff the player or monsters to alter the outcome; play monster cards of matching types to make the battle more difficult; or offer to assist the player, typically in exchange for treasure cards. Other cards that can enter play include Items, which can be used in combat, Treasure Cards, which act as sellable loot and equipment, and Curse Cards, which apply effects. Additionally, players can equip certain cards (such as armor and weapons) to raise their total level and kill stronger monsters, and can use Class Cards and Race Cards to grant extra abilities or advantages at the cost of a balanced weakness; for example, the elf race can level when helping others kill monsters, but will take additional damage from disgusting enemies. Standard games typically last around an hour, with the game ending once a player reaches the target level and wins the match. Aside from defeating monsters, players can progress through indirect means such as selling cards (with every 1000 Gold on the sum total granting a level) or by playing special leveling cards. Most games disallow victory through indirect methods, meaning only fighting a monster can win the game. There are a few exceptions, however, such as when a player uses cards that specifically state they override rules. Variants, expansions and accessories =Variants= These are themed \\"box set\\" editions of MUNCHKIN that have been released. (The overall theme parodied by each set is after the title.) Each is a stand-alone version that can be played separately or combined with any other version for a more expansive game. Most of these editions were illustrated by John Kovalic, although some were done by other artists (who are noted if applicable). Some of these have been released in Deluxe versions (which include a gameboard and movers to keep track of levels) and/or Guest Artist Editions (drawn with new art by artists other than those who originally drew them). Certain versions have been co-produced with USAopoly and/or IDW Games, and feature \\"character cards\\" that grant starting powers and keep track of levels.

Reception  An early review on RPGnet regards Munchkin as not a very serious game; the rules make this clear with phrases like \\"Decide who goes first by rolling the dice and arguing about the results and the meaning of this sentence and whether the fact that a word seems to be missing any effect,\\" and \\"Any disputes in the rules should be settled by loud arguments with the owner of the game having the last word.\\" There are many cards which interact with or are affected by a single other card, despite the rarity of the two cards entering play together (such as the interaction between Fowl Fiend and Chicken on Your Head or Sword of Slaying Everything Except Squid and Squidzilla). On BoardGameGeek the average user rating is 6/10. Tom Vasel of The Dice Tower was critical of the game Munchkin feeling it was overpriced, had limited re- playability, and a poor and occasionally tedious gaming experience.

He mainly appeared in German films before migrating to the United States in 1930 and featuring in numerous Hollywood productions. Slezak often portrayed villains or thugs, most notably the German U-boat captain in Alfred Hitchcock's film Lifeboat (1944), but occasionally he got to play lighter roles, as in The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962) and as a wandering gypsy in The Inspector General (1949). He also played a cheerfully corrupt and philosophical private detective in the film noir Born to Kill (1947) and appeared as Squire Trelawney in Treasure Island (1972). Life and career Slezak c. 1928 Born in Vienna, the son of opera tenor Leo Slezak and Elisabeth \\"Elsa\\" Wertheim, he studied medicine for a time and later worked as a bank teller. His older sister Margarete Slezak was also an actress. He was talked into taking his first role, in the 1922 Austrian film Sodom und Gomorrah, by his friend and the film's director, Michael Curtiz. In his early movie career, before he gained a great deal of weight, Slezak was cast as a thin leading man in silent films. He also acted on the stage for many years, debuting on Broadway in 1931. In Vienna in the 1930s, Slezak was close friends with heiress Maria Altmann and her family. His first American film was Once Upon a Honeymoon (1942), with Ginger Rogers and Cary Grant. He worked steadily and appeared in over 100 films including The Princess and the Pirate (1944), The Spanish Main (1945), Sinbad the Sailor (1947), Born to Kill (1947), Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion (1950), People Will Talk (1951), and Call Me Madam (1953). Slezak played the lead in Broadway musicals, including Fanny, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Slezak as Geppetto from a 1957 presentation of Pinocchio Slezak acted in radio in such shows as Lux Radio Theater, Columbia Workshop, The Pepsodent Show, and The Charlie McCarthy Show. He made numerous television appearances, including in the programs The Loretta Young Show, This Is Show Business, Playhouse 90, and Studio One, and appeared as The Clock King in episodes 45 and 46 of TV series Batman (1966). In 1959/60, Slezak appeared at the Metropolitan Opera in Johann Strauss's operetta Die Zigeunerbaron. In the 1970s, Slezak played the non- singing role of Frosch, the jailer, in the San Francisco Opera production of Johann Strauss's operetta Die Fledermaus. Later film roles in Britain included the Cliff Richard vehicle Wonderful Life (1964) and Black Beauty (1971). =Autobiography= Slezak's autobiography, What Time's the Next Swan? was published in 1962. The book's title refers to an alleged incident in the career of his father, heldentenor Leo Slezak. During a performance in the title role of Lohengrin, the elder Slezak was supposed to finish his aria by stepping into a swan boat and then being pulled offstage. When a stagehand removed the boat prematurely, Slezak supposedly reacted to the error by asking the audience \\"What time's the next swan?\\"Trabling, Walt. \\"Slezak Offers Memoir\\". Santa Cruz Sentinel. 21 October 1962. Retrieved 18 December 2018. =Personal life= Slezak married Johanna \\"Kaasi\\" Van Rijn on October 10, 1943. The couple had three children: Ingrid, Erika, and Leo. Erika went on to become an Emmy-winning actress, and starred as Victoria Lord on the long- running soap opera One Life to Live from 1971 to its cancellation in 2012. In 1974, Slezak appeared on the series as her character's godfather, Lazlo Braedecker. Grave of Slezak, his wife Johanna and his parents Leo and Elisabeth Death On 21 April 1983, Slezak died from a self-inflicted gunshot. He was reportedly despondent over the state of his health, most notably heart trouble, a recent prostate operation, and a shoulder injury requiring several treatments a week.Jones, Jack. \\"Actor Walter Slezak Shoots Self to Death at New York Home\\".

He was also fluent on the electric piano and organ. His best-known compositions are \\"Freedom Jazz Dance\\", recorded and popularized by Miles Davis in 1966, and \\"Listen Here.\\" Biography Harris was born and grew up in Chicago. His father was from Cuba and his mother from Mississippi. He studied music under Walter Dyett at DuSable High School, as had many other successful Chicago musicians (such as Nat King Cole, Dinah Washington, Clifford Jordan, Johnny Griffin, Gene Ammons, Julian Priester, and Bo Diddley and others). He later studied music at Roosevelt University, by which time he was proficient on piano, vibraphone, and tenor saxophone. While in college, he performed professionally with Gene Ammons. After college, Harris was drafted into the United States Army and while serving in Europe, he was accepted into the 7th Army Band, which also included Don Ellis, Leo Wright, and Cedar Walton. Leaving military service, he worked in New York City before returning to Chicago where he signed a contract with Vee Jay Records. His first album for Vee Jay, Exodus to Jazz, included his own jazz arrangement of Ernest Gold's theme from the movie Exodus. A shortened version of this track, which featured his masterful playing in the upper register of the tenor saxophone, was heavily played on radio and became the first jazz record ever to be certified gold. The single, Exodus climbed into the US Billboard Hot 100 and reached No. 16 in the U.S. R&B; chart. He moved to Columbia Records in 1964 and then to Atlantic Records the following year where he re-established himself. In 1965, Atlantic released The In Sound, a bop album that won back many of his detractors. Over the next few years, he began to perform on electric piano and the electric Varitone saxophone, and to perform a mixture of jazz and funk that sold well in both the jazz and rhythm and blues markets. In 1967, his album, The Electrifying Eddie Harris reached second place on the R&B; charts. The album's lead track, \\"Listen Here\\", was issued as a single, climbing to No. 11 R&B; and No. 45 on the Hot 100. Harris released several different versions of his composition over the years, including both studio and live concert recordings. The first appeared on an early Atlantic album, Mean Greens, featuring him on electric piano. He was to re-work the track two years later, stretching it out to over seven minutes in length, for his iconic sax solo version. The whole track appeared on both sides of the Atlantic hit single, edited into two parts. For the 11th Annual Grammy Awards in 1968, Eddie was nominated for the Best Instrumental Jazz Performance for Small Group or Soloist with Small Group for the Album ‚Äì The Electrifying Eddie Harris. In 1969, he performed with pianist and vocalist Les McCann at the Montreux Jazz Festival. Although the musicians had been unable to rehearse, their session was so impressive that a recording of it was released by Atlantic as Swiss Movement. This became one of the best-selling jazz albums ever and was nominated during the 13th Annual Grammy Awards (1970) for the Best Jazz Performance ‚Äì Small Group or Soloist with Small Group. Harris also came up with the idea of the reed trumpet, playing one for the first time at the Newport Jazz Festival. Eddie moved from Chicago to Los Angeles in the 1970s. From 1970 to 1975, he experimented with new instruments of his own invention (the reed trumpet was a trumpet with a saxophone mouthpiece, the was a saxophone with a trombone mouthpiece, and the guitorgan was a combination of guitar and organ), with singing the blues, with jazz-rock (he recorded an album with Steve Winwood, Jeff Beck, Albert Lee, Ric Grech, Zoot Money, Ian Paice and other rockers). He also started singing comic R&B;/blues songs, such as \\"That is Why You're Overweight\\" and \\"Eddie Who?\\". In 1975, however, he alienated some of his audience with his album The Reason Why I'm Talking S--t, which consisted mainly of comedy. After recording for Atlantic for over 12 years, Eddie left the record company after completing his final album for the label in 1977. He then signed with RCA Records and recorded two albums. Harris died of congestive heart failure in Los Angeles on November 5, 1996, at the age of 62.

It has its origins in English common law. Riparian water rights exist in many jurisdictions with a common law heritage, such as Canada, Australia, and states in the eastern United States. Common land ownership can be organized into a partition unit, a corporation consisting of the landowners on the shore that formally owns the water area and determines its use.  General Principle  Under the riparian principle, all landowners whose properties adjoin a body of water have the right to make reasonable use of it as it flows through or over their properties. If there is not enough water to satisfy all users, allotments are generally fixed in proportion to frontage on the water source. These rights cannot be sold or transferred other than with the adjoining land and only in reasonable quantities associated with that land. The water cannot be transferred out of the watershed without due consideration as to the rights of the downstream riparian landowners. Riparian rights include such things as the right to access for swimming, boating and fishing; the right to wharf out to a point of navigability; the right to erect structures such as docks, piers, and boat lifts; the right to use the water for domestic purposes; the right to accretions caused by water level fluctuations; the right to exclusive use if the waterbody is non-navigable. Riparian rights also depend upon \\"reasonable use\\" as it relates to other riparian owners to ensure that the rights of one riparian owner are weighed fairly and equitably with the rights of adjacent riparian owners. England and Wales The Environment Agency lists the riparian rights and duties in England and Wales.Living on the Edge ‚Äì Environment Agency website, retrieved 10 December 2008 The rights include ownership of the land up to the centre of the watercourse unless it is known to be owned by someone else, the right for water to flow onto land in its natural quantity and quality, the right to protect property from flooding and land from erosion subject to approval by the agency, the right to fish in the watercourse unless the right is sold or leased if an angler has a valid Environment Agency rod licence. They also include the right to acquire accretion and the right to boomage (a fee charge for securing a boom, generally for the retention of logs). Duties arising from the model include the following: * Pass on the flow of water without obstruction, pollution or diversion affecting the rights of others. * Maintain the bed and banks of the watercourse and to clear any debris, whether natural or artificial, to keep any culverts, rubbish screens, weirs and mill gates clear of debris. * Be responsible for protection of land from flooding and cause no obstructions, temporary or permanent, preventing the free passage of fish. * Accept flood flows even if caused by inadequate capacity downstream, but there is no duty to improve the drainage capacity of a watercourse.  United States  The United States recognizes two types of water rights. Although use and overlap varies over time and by state, the western arid states generally follow the doctrine of prior appropriation,also known as first-come, first-served, but water rights for the eastern states follow riparian law. =Riparian rights= Under riparian law, water is a public good like the air, sunlight, or wildlife. It is not \\"owned\\" by the government, state or private individual but is rather included as part of the land over which it falls from the sky or then travels along the surface. In determining the contours of riparian rights, there is a clear distinction between navigable (public) waters and non-navigable waters. The land below navigable waters is the property of state,43 USC ¬ß 1311(A) and subject to all the public land laws and in most states public trust rights. Navigable waters are treated as public highways with any exclusive riparian right ending at the ordinary high water mark. Like a road, any riparian right is subordinate to the public's right to travel on the river, but any public right is subject to nuisance laws and the police power of the state. It is not an individual right or liberty interest. Because a finding of navigability establishes state versus federal property, navigability for purposes of riverbed title is a federal question determined under federal law. The states retain the power of defining the scope of the public trust over navigable waters.PPL Montana v Montana 132 S.Ct. 1215 (2012) A non-navigable stream is synonymous with private property, or jointly-owned property if it serves as a boundary. The state could choose to divest itself of title to the streambed, but the waters and use of the waters remains subject to the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution which holds an easement or servitude, benefiting the federal government for the purpose of regulating commerce on navigable bodies of water.Borax Consolidated, Ltd. v. City of Los Angeles, 29 U.S. 10, 56 S. Ct. 23, 80 L.Ed 9 (1935.) The reasonable use of the water by a riparian owner is subject to the downstream riparian owners 'riparian right' to receive waters undiminished in flow and quality. Since all surface waters eventually flow to the public ocean, federal regulatory authority under the Clean Waters Act, like the Clean Air Act, extends beyond only public (navigable) waters to prevent downstream pollution. =States' involvement= Federal courts have long recognized that state laws establish the extent of the riparian and public right. In the case of navigable waters, title goes to the average low water mark. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court defined it as the \\"ordinary low water mark, unaffected by drought; that is, the height of the water at ordinary stages.\\"Appeal of York Haven Water & Power Co., 212 Pa. 622, 62 A.97 (1905) Land below the low water mark on navigable rivers belongs to the state government in the case of the 13 original states. Lands between the high and low water marks on navigable rivers are subject to the police powers of the states.(See United States v. Pennsylvania Salt Mfg. Co., 16 F.2d 476 (E.D. Pa., 1926)) In the case of the original 13 states, upon ratification of the US Constitution, title to these submerged lands remained vested in the several states similar to the public or common roads. As new lands were acquired by the United States, either by purchase or treaty, title to the highways and the beds of all navigable, or tidal, water bodies became vested in the United States unless they had been validly conveyed into private ownership by the former sovereign.McKnight v. Brodell, 212 F.Supp 45 During the territorial period, the United States held these title \\"in trust\\" for the benefit of the future states that would be carved out of the territory.Hymes v. Grimes Company, 165 F. 2d 323 Each of the states were to come into the Union on an \\"equal footing\\" with the original 13 states. Under the equal footing doctrine, territorial states are vested with the same sovereign title rights to navigable submerged lands as the original 13 states.Pollard v. Hagan, 44 U.S. 212, 3 How. 212, 11 L.Ed. 565 (1845) However, during the territorial period, the United States could convey certain of these lands under the limited circumstances of promoting commerce.Brewer Elliot Oil and Gas Co. v. U S., 260 U.S. 77, 43 S.Ct 60, 67 L.Ed. 140 (1922) Ownership of lands submerged by navigable waters was resolved by Congress passing the Submerged Lands Act,43 U.S.C.A. 1301 which confirmed state title to the beds of all tidal and navigable bodies of water. While the act conveyed land title to the states, non-navigable stream beds remained treated like dry lands and contiguous to the adjoining estates. Waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tides, even if non-navigable, also passed to the states, but the continued ownership and public use of these tidal/marsh lands are based on state laws.

The main NODC facility was located in Silver Spring, Maryland and was made up of five divisions. The NODC also had field offices collocated with major government or academic oceanographic laboratories in Stennis Space Center, MS; Miami, FL; La Jolla, San Diego, California; Seattle, WA; Austin, Texas; Charleston, South Carolina; Norfolk, Virginia; and Honolulu, Hawaii. In 2015, NODC was merged with the National Climatic Data Center and the National Geophysical Data Center into the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). NOAA also operated two other data centers: National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), Asheville, North Carolina and National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), Boulder, Colorado. In 2015, the three merged to form the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Also, the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder, Colorado is operated for NGDC by the University of Colorado through the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES). These discipline-oriented centers served as national repositories and dissemination facilities for global environmental data. The data archives amassed by the NODC and the other centers provide a record of Earth's changing environment, and support numerous research and operational applications and are still available through the NCEI. Working cooperatively, the centers provided data products and services to scientists, engineers, resource managers, policy makers, and other users in the United States and around the world. History Established in 1961, the NODC was originally an interagency facility administered by the U.S. Naval Hydrographic (later Oceanographic) Office. The NODC was transferred to NOAA in 1970 when NOAA was created by Executive Order by then-President, Richard Nixon. In the words of its charter, the NODC serves to \\"acquire, process, preserve, and disseminate oceanographic data.\\" Its primary mission is to ensure that global oceanographic data sets collected at great cost are maintained in a permanent archive that is easily accessible to the world science community and to other users. Mission The NODC's mission statement was To provide scientific stewardship of marine data and information. Core description The National Oceanographic Data Center, National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC) and NOAA Central Library, with its regional branch assets, were integrated to provide access to the world's most comprehensive sources of marine environmental data and information. NODC maintains and updates a national ocean archive with environmental data acquired from domestic and foreign activities and produces products and research from these data which help monitor global environmental changes. These data included physical, biological and chemical measurements derived from in situ oceanographic observations, satellite remote sensing of the oceans, and ocean model simulations. NODC personnel directly interacted with Federal, state, academic, and industrial oceanographic activities, represent NESDIS on various interagency domestic panels, committees and councils, and represent the United States in various international organizations, such as the International Oceanographic Data Exchange. The Data Center represents NESDIS and NOAA to the general public, government agencies, private institutions, foreign governments, and the private sector on matters involving oceanographic data. Data holdings The NODC managed the world's largest collection of publicly available oceanographic data. NODC holdings included in situ and remotely sensed physical, chemical, and biological oceanographic data from coastal and deep ocean areas. These were originally collected for a variety of operational and research missions by U.S. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (primarily the U.S. Navy); by State and local government agencies; by universities and research institutions; and private industry. NODC data holdings extended back over one hundred years, and the volume is expected to grow exponentially as new ocean observing systems are deployed. Through NODC archive and access services these ocean data were reused to answer questions about climate change, ocean phenomena, and management of coastal and marine resources, marine transportation, recreation, national security, and natural disasters. Another significant user community was Education, where these data and information products help teach each new generation of students about the oceans. Requests for oceanographic data and information have increased each year since the Center was established in 1961. Access to these archives is still available through the NCEI. =International cooperation and data exchange= A significant percentage of the oceanographic data held by NODC was foreign. NODC acquired foreign data through direct bilateral exchanges with other countries, and through the facilities of the World Data Center for Oceanography, Silver Spring, which is collocated with and operated by NODC. There are three World Data Centers for Oceanography: World Data Center, Silver Spring, Maryland, United States, World Data Center, Moscow, Russia, and World Data Center, Tianjin, People's Republic of China. They are part of the World Data Center System initiated in 1957 to provide a mechanism for data exchange, and they operate under guidelines issued by the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU). Under NODC leadership, the Global Data Archeology and Rescue (GODAR) project grew into a major international program sponsored by the Inter-governmental Oceanographic Commission. GODAR is a comprehensive effort to locate, rescue, quality control, and disseminate historical global ocean profile data for use by the climate and global change research community. =Data management for global change studies= The NODC provided data management support for major ocean science projects and promotes improved working relations with the academic ocean research community. NOAA library and information network The NODC also managed the NOAA Library and Information Network, which included the NOAA Central Library in Silver Spring, MD; regional libraries in Miami, FL and Seattle, WA; and field libraries or information centers at about 30 NOAA sites throughout the United States. The combined libraries contained millions of volumes including books, journals, CD-ROMs, DVDs, audio, and video tapes. These holdings are now managed by the NCEI. =User services= Each year the NODC responded to thousands of requests for oceanographic data and information. Copies of specified data sets or data selected from the NODC's archive databases were provided to users on various media types, or online. NODC data products were provided at prices that cover the cost of data selection and retrieval. However, data provided on the NODC public website is free of charge.

He was a member of Abu Nidal. The plane was hijacked by a group of three people. The remaining two hijackers were killed, either during in-flight shooting with the plane's sky marshal, Methad Mustafa Kamal, or after Egyptian commandos stormed the hijacked plane. Omar Rezaq had given his name as Omar Marzouki and used a Tunisian passport when boarding the plane at Athens airport, but later admitted that he is of Palestinian origin and was born in Lebanon in 1963. The FBI determined that \\"Omar Marzouki\\" was his real name while \\"Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq\\" was an alias, as its initials (O.M.A.R.) make the name easy to remember. During hours of negotiations while the plane was on the ground at Luqa airport in Malta, five passengers were shot, three of whom survived. On 24 November 1985, Egyptian commandos set explosives that ignited a fire, suffocating many of the passengers.http://aviation- safety.net/database/record.php?id=19851124-0 Rezaq was wounded in a subsequent shootout (his left lung was pierced by a bullet), but recovered and was arraigned in a Maltese court on 12 December 1986. Preliminary inquiry lasted until 3 April 1987, and on 2 November 1988, Rezaq pleaded guilty to seven of the nine charges against him. These were the illegal arrest of crew and passengers, the deaths of Nitzan Mendelson and Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp, the attempted killings of Methad Mustafa Kamal, Patrick Scott Baker, Jacqueline Nink Pflug and Tamar Artzi, and the illegal possession of arms and explosives. The former two charges were later withdrawn. Rezaq was sentenced to the maximum 25 years' imprisonment, less the years and months he had already spent in prison. On appeal, the sentence was confirmed on 20 April 1989. Rezaq served only seven years in Malta and was released. As a free man under an assumed name, he went to Accra, Ghana where at the request of the American Embassy Regional Security Officer Jerald H. Barnes he was detained by the Ghana government and remained there until July 1993. Ghanaian authorities did not give Rezaq to the United States but told them that he planned to go to Nigeria. Rezaq flew to Lagos in July 1993; U.S. intelligence officials were on board his flight to monitor him. He was arrested and extraordinary renditioned by members of the DSS, who flew him to the U.S.Benjamin, Daniel & Steven Simon. \\"The Age of Sacred Terror\\", 2002 Rezaq's arrest was the result of an agreement between the governments of the United States and Nigeria. When Rezaq arrived at the airport, Nigerian officials denied him entry since he did not have a passport, something they knew beforehand, and placed him on the first aircraft departing Nigeria, a Gulfstream IV leased by the U.S. government.

The majority of the species are endemic to China, with smaller numbers elsewhere in Asia, and a few in the Mediterranean region. Epimedium species are deciduous or evergreen hardy perennials. The majority have four- parted \\"spider-like\\" flowers in spring. The species used as a dietary supplement is Epimedium grandiflorum. It contains icariin, which is a weak PDE5 inhibitor in vitro. Its clinical effects are unknown. Description Epimedium alpinum flower; note the spurs almost as long as the sepals Labelled flowers of E. √ó perralchicum 'Fr√∂hnleiten' Species of Epimedium are herbaceous perennials, growing from an underground rhizome. Their growth habits are somewhat variable. Some have solitary stems, others have a \\"tufted\\" habit, with multiple stems growing close together. There may be several leaves to a stem or the leaves may be solitary, produced from the base of the plant. Individual leaves are generally compound, often with three leaflets, but also with more. Leaflets usually have spiny margins. The leaves may be annual, making the plant deciduous, or longer lasting, so that the plant is evergreen. The inflorescence is an open raceme or panicle, the number of flowers varying by species. Individual flowers have parts in fours. There are four smaller outer sepals, usually greenish and shed when the flower opens. Moving inwards, these are followed by four larger petal-like inner sepals, often brightly coloured. Inside the sepals are four true petals. These may be small and flat, but often have a complex shape including a nectar-producing \\"spur\\" that may be longer than the sepals. There are four stamens. One of the common names for the genus, bishop's hat, arises from the shape of the flowers, particularly where the spurs are longer than the sepals. Taxonomy The genus was given its name by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, in describing the European species E. alpinum. Linnaeus, Carl von. 1753. Species Plantarum 1: 117 in Latin The name is a latinized version of a Greek name for an unidentifiable plant, epimedion, that is mentioned in Pliny's Natural History (xxvii.57). The meaning of the original name is unclear., p. 55 ;accepted species (65) =Hybrids= Epimedium √ó versicolor Some artificial hybrids are cultivated in gardens. These include: pp. 437‚Äì441. *E. √ó cantabrigiense Stearn, hybrid between E. alpinum and E. pubigerum *E. √ó perralchicum Stearn, hybrid between E. perralderianum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum *E. √ó rubrum Morr., hybrid between E. alpinum and E. grandiflorum *E. √ó versicolor Morr., hybrid between E. grandiflorum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum *E. √ó warleyense Stearn, hybrid between E. alpinum and E. pinnatum subsp. colchicum *E. √ó youngianum Fisch & C.A.Mey, hybrid between E. diphyllum and E. grandiflorum Cultivation Some varieties and hybrids have been in western cultivation for the last 100 to 150 years. There is now a wide array of new Chinese species being cultivated in the west, many of which have only recently been discovered, and some of which have yet to be named. There are also many older Japanese hybrids and forms, extending the boundaries of the genus in cultivation. Few genera of plants have seen such a dramatic increase in newly discovered species, primarily thanks to the work of Mikinori Ogisu of Japan and Darrell Probst of Massachusetts. The majority of the Chinese species have not been fully tested for hardiness nor indeed for any other aspect of their culture. The initial assumption that the plants would only thrive where their native conditions could be closely replicated have proven to be overly cautious, as most varieties are proving extraordinarily amenable to general garden and container cultivation. The cultivar 'Amber Queen' is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. =Propagation= While they can be successfully propagated in early spring, epimediums are best divided in late summer, with the aim of promoting rapid re-growth of roots and shoots before the onset of winter. Several breeders (in particular Darrell Diano Probst, Tim Branney & Robin White) have also undertaken their own hybridization programmes with the genus. Various new nursery selections are gradually appearing in the horticulture trade, the best of which are extending the colour and shape range of the flowers available to the gardener. =Garden uses= thumb Hugely popular as garden plants for centuries in Japan, epimediums are only just beginning to garner attention in the West. While they vary somewhat in their respective hardiness, all are essentially dwellers of the forest floor, and, as such, all require fundamentally similar conditions of moist, free-draining, humus-rich soil and cool shade, with some shelter for the newly emerging leaves. Some of the more robust varieties are often recommended as plants for dry shade, and whilst their tough foliage and stout rhizomes can allow them to grow successfully in such conditions, (and in more open, exposed positions too, in some instances) they will certainly not give their best. Furthermore, dryness and exposure will pretty much guarantee the early death of many of the newer and more delicate species. Given suitable conditions most epimediums will form beautiful groundcover plants, often with magnificent new leaves tinted in bronze, copper and reds combining with a huge variety of flower colours and forms in spring. Handsome and dense-growing foliage remains present for much of the year, with the leaves often turning purple, crimson and scarlet in autumn in some forms, and remaining evergreen in others. With all varieties, however, the foliage is best cut off at ground level shortly before new leaves emerge, so as to fully reveal their beauty of form and colour. Ideally, a mulch should then be applied to protect the new growth from frosts.  Chemistry  Epimedium wushanense contains a number of flavanoids. 37 compounds were characterized from the underground and aerial parts of the plant. Among them, 28 compounds were prenylflavonoids. The predominant flavonoid, epimedin C, ranged from 1.4 to 5.1% in aerial parts and 1.0 to 2.8% in underground parts.Li HF, Guan XY, Ye M, Xiang C, Lin CH, Sun C, Guo DA.,\\"Qualitative and quantitative analyses of Epimedium wushanense by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry.\\" J Sep Sci. 2011 May 10; References Bibliography  *  External links  * * Category:Berberidaceae genera Category:Flora of Asia Category:Flora of Europe Category:Medicinal plants Category:Garden plants of Europe Category:Garden plants of Asia ","title":"Epimedium"},{"id":"900230","text":"Three ships in the United States Navy have been named USS Evans, the first two for Robley D.

He fulfilled multiple roles including costume and hair designer, percussionist, album cover designer, and music video director. Prior to Split Enz, Crombie worked as a postal assistant and was also an artist. For the album Time and Tide, Crombie took over the role of drummer, though a year later returned to percussion, with Paul Hester becoming Split Enz's drummer. He is particularly remembered for playing spoon solos during Split Enz live shows. After Split Enz disbanded, Noel formed the band Schnell Fenster with Phil Judd, Eddie Rayner and Nigel Griggs, also Split Enz alumni, and Michael den Elzen. Rayner left before the first album was released. In 1988 the members of Schnell Fenster collaborated with Wendy Matthews, Michael Harris, Louis McManus, Vika Bull and Lisa Edwards under the name 'Noel's Cowards' for the movie Rikky and Pete. Crombie has released one solo single, \\"My Voice Keeps Changing on Me\\", in 1983 while Split Enz took a break. Tim Finn was the only other band member to have a solo release during this break. According to Crombie he had to either release the single or pay for the studio time. In 1996, Crombie assisted Crowded House by designing the stage set design for their final concert, Farewell to the World at the Sydney Opera House. Crombie lives with his daughters Hedwig, Griselda, and his wife Sally whom he works with as a freelance designer. They designed the set for ABC-TV's musical quiz program Spicks and Specks.

The 48-hour block of programming is focused on non-fiction books and authors, featuring programs in the format of interviews with authors as well as live coverage of book events from around the country. Book TV debuted on C-SPAN2 on September 12, 1998. While the primary mission of C-SPAN2 is live coverage of the United States Senate, Book TV programs are sometimes also scheduled to air during the week when the Senate is not in session. Background and production Book TV covers established and upcoming nonfiction authors, mainly in the subject areas of history, biography and public affairs. Approximately 2,000 authors are featured annually, and in one year may cover as many as 60,000 titles. The network's production budget for Book TV is approximately $600,000 per year. Like C-SPAN's weekly coverage of government affairs, the Book TV the production style is \\"no frills\\", focusing on panel discussions, book signings and visits to bookstores. Book TV's coverage is weighted toward government, politics and history, in line with C-SPAN's weekly programming. However, the topics represented vary, ranging from the genealogy of Greek mythology to the ‚Äúuse and abuse‚Äù of the English language. While C-SPAN does not usually cover narrative fiction due to its nonfiction mission, it may occasionally be featured, as when Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer appeared in 1999 to talk about their novels. Book TV interviews are characterized by a focus on the author, rather than the host, and an unstructured format allowing the author to guide the discussion. As with other C-SPAN programming, viewer call-ins are featured, allowing writers to hear directly from their readers. Programming The majority of the Book TV weekly lineup is coverage of author lectures, book signings, and seminars. Several weekends each year, Book TV features live coverage of major regional book fairs and festivals. There are also several regularly scheduled series: After Words, an interview show conducted by guest hosts familiar with the author's subject; and Booknotes programs from 1989 to 2004, under the title Encore Booknotes. A monthly series on Book TV is In Depth, a three-hour one- on-one interview covering an author's entire body of work. In Depth is televised live with viewer calls on the first Sunday of each month at 12 p.m. In Depth occasionally also includes video of the featured writer at their home or office, where they talk about how they do their research and writing. In addition to C-SPAN2, Book TV can also be viewed via live streaming on the C-SPAN website, while an iPhone app streams the audio portion only. All past Book TV coverage of nonfiction authors is archived at the C-SPAN Video Library. History The Book TV weekend-long programming schedule grew out of the success of C-SPAN's long-running Booknotes series, which since 1989 was the only avenue for coverage of nonfiction books and authors on the C-SPAN networks. C-SPAN believes that coverage of nonfiction books complements its primary public affairs mission and since Booknotes could only feature 52 books per year, when the network wished to increase its coverage of nonfiction books, Book TV on C-SPAN2 was the solution. The inspiration for coverage of nonfiction books on the C-SPAN networks originated with C-SPAN founder Brian Lamb's frustration with the lack of attention that authors receive on television, which led initially to the creation of the author interview program Booknotes. As Lamb related in a 2003 interview, \\"It used to drive me absolutely crazy when an author would appear on a talk show and come and go before I even had a chance to determine if I wanted to read the book.\\" In 2010, Book TV received the Phillis Wheatley Award from the organizers of New York's Harlem Book Fair. The award, named for the first published African- American female writer, is given for literary work and advocacy that \\"transcends boundaries, race and perception\\". According to book fair founder Max Rodriguez, Book TV was honored for giving a voice to African-American literature in a manner unlike other television media outlets.

Background The Matrix is first introduced in the 1976 serial The Deadly Assassin, twenty- three years before the release of the film The Matrix, six years before William Gibson's 1982 \\"Burning Chrome\\", eight years before Gibson's novel Neuromancer and years before the advent of virtual reality in the 1980s. It is one of the locations for a battle between the Doctor and Chancellor Goth, the titular assassin. Most of Part Three of the serial is spent inside the virtual reality of the Matrix where the Doctor battles an agent of the Master. The serial also explains that if a person dies while linked to the Matrix, he dies in the real world as well. Access to the Matrix is obtained through an apparatus connected to or enclosing the head of the user or, physically, via Doors into which the user walks. The Matrix functions as a simulated reality, the physical laws of which an advanced user may bend or break. Full access to the Matrix is given only to the President of the High Council of Time Lords through the use of the Crown of Rassilon, but limited access to its contents are guaranteed to other Time Lords. The Keeper of the Matrix holds the Key of Rassilon that grants access to the Seventh Door, which was thought legendary until the Doctor used the Key to access it in The Ultimate Foe. The Matrix is part of the Amplified Panatropic Computer Network, or APC Net, which contains the biological imprints (or bio-data extracts) of all Time Lords as well as the memories of dead Time Lords, storing them in an extradimensional framework of trillions of electrochemical cells. It also receives input from sensors contained in the TARDIS time machines piloted by Time Lords. As a result, the Matrix is not only a record of the past but can actually predict the future as well. The amount of knowledge in the Matrix, though vast, is not complete, and can be tampered with if given the right amount of access. The unauthorised extraction of a Time Lord's bio-data from the Matrix is an offence tantamount to treason (Arc of Infinity). In The Trial of a Time Lord, evidence is gathered from the Matrix to present a case against the Doctor on charges of breaking the first law of time. This is done by the Valeyard, a learned Court Prosecutor. It transpires however, that the Valeyard has been able to tamper with the events shown by the Matrix to produce false evidence against the Doctor. When this is revealed by the Master, the Valeyard flees to a virtual reality world created by him within the Matrix. Within the Matrix, the Doctor is forced to fight the Valeyard, much like he had fought Goth in The Deadly Assassin. The Valeyard's world appears as a Victorian factory, and he is disguised as a Mr Popplewick. The Master is also able to materialise his TARDIS inside the virtual reality within the Matrix. Together the Master and the Doctor manage to defeat the Valeyard and discover his plan to murder the Time Lords at the trial with a Particle Disseminator. In the revived series, though it seemed that they were destroyed, it was revealed that both Gallifrey and the Time Lords were removed from the known universe at the end of last great Time War. The fate of the Matrix was uncertain at the time as the Master returned to Gallifrey on its final day at the climax of \\"The End of Time\\". In \\"Dark Water\\", it is revealed that the Master, now in the form of Missy, created a Matrix called the Nethersphere to upload and edit the minds of recently dead humans before re-entering them into an upgraded Cyberman body. The Matrix is a key element of the plot of \\"Hell Bent\\". When the Doctor returns to a resurrected Gallifrey, he extracts Clara from her timeline seconds before her death and the pair enter the cloisters of the Citadel where the Matrix is located, attempting to steal a TARDIS capsule from the workshop below. The Matrix is guarded by Cloister Wraiths and captured Daleks, Cybermen and Weeping Angels‚Äîthe Doctor describes it to Clara as \\"a big computer, made of ghosts, in a crypt, guarded by more ghosts\\". Other appearances The following section contains information taken from spin-off material. The canonicity of these stories with regard to the television series and each other is open to interpretation. In the Doctor Who comic strip published in Doctor Who Magazine, the Matrix is depicted as being inhabited by the minds of dead Time Lords‚Äîincluding Rassilon‚Äîwho have a sort of quasi-existence within its confines. They are even able to construct an agent to do their bidding in the outside world, an entity known as Shayde. The Past Doctor Adventures novel Matrix by Mike Tucker and Robert Perry reveals the existence of the \\"Dark Matrix\\", the negative thoughts and evil impulses of all the Time Lords whose knowledge is stored in the Matrix, syphoned off and forgotten. The Valeyard gains control of the Dark Matrix following the events of Trial of a Time Lord, and attempts to use it to manipulate the Doctor's timeline, feeding it with the negative psychic energy of the Jack the Ripper murders and using it to corrupt the Doctor's other selves to their basic, evil natures. Having escaped this fate by sealing his conscious mind in the TARDIS telepathic circuits, the Seventh Doctor destroys the Dark Matrix by imploding the Valeyard's TARDIS, thereby preventing an alternate 1963 in which its influence meant the Ripper murders never stopped. In the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel The Ancestor Cell by Peter Anghelides and Stephen Cole, Gallifrey is destroyed by the Eighth Doctor to prevent the voodoo cult Faction Paradox from starting a time war between the Time Lords and an unspecified Enemy. In The Gallifrey Chronicles by Lance Parkin, it is revealed that the Time Lords had survived within the Matrix, which had then been downloaded into the Doctor's mind, although he had to sacrifice much of his memory to make space for it. Their reconstruction is possible, but will require a sufficiently advanced computer. At the novel's end, the question of whether or not the Time Lords will be restored remains unanswered. However, it can be assumed that both they and the planet are restored at some point before the start of the 2005 series if the novels are to remain consistent with the new series' continuity. In the Big Finish Productions audio play Neverland, it is also established that Rassilon himself continues to exist within the Matrix. In the Gallifrey audio series, an ancient Gallifreyan evil named Pandora also survives and emerges from a special partition within the Matrix. Lord President Romana is eventually able to destroy the entity by destroying the Matrix itself. It is not clear how, or whether, the events of this series can be reconciled with those of the Eighth Doctor Adventures novels and some stories have suggested that the novels and audios take place in separate continuities. Most of the 45th anniversary comic book series The Forgotten takes place inside the TARDIS Matrix, where the TARDIS takes the form of various companions to help the Doctor after he is attacked by a mind parasite. In the later stories \\"Hypothetical Gentlemen\\" & \\"Sky Jacks\\", it is shown the matrix has developed sentience as a result of the death of every Time Lord on Gallifrey. The stories concern its attempts to return to reality via a machine at The Great Exhibition and the TARDIS.

The execution by hanging took place in Alipore Jail, Kolkata, on 14 August 2004. He was charged in 1990 for the crimes of rape and murder of Hetal Parekh, a 15-year-old school-girl. The execution stirred up public debates and attracted immense attention from media. Dhananjoy was convicted and hanged. This was the first hanging in West Bengal since 21 August 1991 at Alipore Jail.  Personal life  Dhananjoy was born in Kuludihi, West Bengal, India, and worked as a security guard in Kolkata. He had married Purnima just eight months before he was arrested in the Hetal Parekh case by falsely claiming he was working in the Border Security Force when he was only a security guard. Purnima works as an anganwadi worker with a salary of Rs 1,200 per month and after his execution lives with her parents even after the execution of her husband she has refused to remarry.  Case details  Hetal Parekh was a student of Welland Gouldsmith School at Bowbazar, Kolkata. She used to live with her parents and elder brother in a third floor flat of Anand Apartments in Bhawanipore. The Parekhs moved into this flat in 1987. Dhananjoy was a security guard of this agency. He had worked in that building for about three years. On 5 March 1990, Dhananjoy performed security duty during the morning shift (6 am to 2 pm). Hetal left for her ICSE examination at about 7:30 am. After the examination, she returned home. In the afternoon, only Hetal and her mother were there in the flat. Hetal's mother went to visit a temple in the vicinities in the afternoon. After returning from the temple, she being unable to enter her home, despite repeated knocking, asked some servants of other flats to break the door open. Hetal was found lying dead near the door connecting the living room with the Parekh couple's bedroom with blood stains on her face and on the floor. Two local doctors examined Hetal and declared her dead. Dhananjoy was not seen in the area after the murder had been discovered. He became the focal point of police investigations. He was eventually arrested by the police from his village home at Kuludihi near Chhatna, Bankura, in the early hours of 12 May 1990. The case was investigated by the Detective Department of Kolkata Police. The chargesheet prepared by the police included the charges of rape, murder and the theft of a wrist watch. The trial took place in the second court of the Additional Sessions Judge at Alipore. Since there was no direct witness to the murder, the case hinged on circumstantial evidence only. After the sessions court convicted Dhananjoy of all the offenses and sentenced him to death, the High Court at Calcutta and the Supreme Court of India upheld the conviction and the death sentence. The Supreme Court convicted Dhananjoy and regarded the crime as a heinous combination of offenses, aggravated by the fact that as a security guard Dhananjoy had been in charge of the victim's safety‚Äîenough to make it belong to the rarest of rare category of crimes-warranting a death sentence. = Claims of innocence = Dhananjoy had claimed repeatedly during his trial that he was completely innocent and that he had nothing to do with the murder, rape or theft. He maintained his stance till the day of his execution.  Controversies  Some academics and lawyers have questioned the validity of the death sentence and the proceedings of the trial. Professors from ISI Kolkata‚ÄîDebasish Sengupta, Probal Chaudhuri and Paramesh Goswami have conducted investigative journalism on the issue; publishing the findings in a book titled Adalat-Media-Samaj Ebong Dhananjayer Fashi (Court-Media-Society and The Hanging of Dhananjoy) . It criticized the handling of the case, the media-trial and faulted the delivered judgement. The film Dhananjay is primarily based on the book.  Execution  Dhananjoy's execution was scheduled on 25 June 2004. It was stayed after his family petitioned the Supreme Court of India, and filed a mercy plea with the then President Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. On 26 June 2004 a campaign to ensure Dhananjoy's hanging was initiated. Mrs. Meera Bhattacharjee, wife of Mr. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the then Chief Minister of West Bengal, led the campaign. Several individuals and human rights groups came forward to oppose the execution. The mercy plea was finally rejected by the president on 4 August 2004. The date of Dhananjoy's execution was fixed at a high-level meeting at the office of Jail Minister Biswanath Chowdhury. He was executed on 14 August 2004 - his 39th birthday.

Early life Born in Zschochau (now part of Ostrau, Saxony) during World War II, Schumann enlisted in the East German Bereitschaftspolizei (state police) following his 18th birthday. After three months' training in Dresden, he was posted to a non-commissioned officers' college in Potsdam, after which he volunteered for service in Berlin. Escape to West Germany On 15 August 1961, the 19-year-old Schumann was sent to the corner of Ruppiner Strasse and Bernauer Strasse to guard the Berlin Wall on its third day of construction. At that time and place, the wall was only a single coil of concertina wire. From the other side, West Germans shouted to him, \\"Komm' r√ºber!\\" (\\"Come over!\\"), and a police car pulled up to wait for him. Schumann jumped over the barbed wire while dropping his PPSh-41 submachine gun and was promptly driven away from the scene by the West Berlin police. West German photographer Peter Leibing photographed Schumann's escape. This photograph, entitled \\"Leap into Freedom\\", has since become an iconic image of the Cold War era and featured at the beginning of the 1982 Disney film Night Crossing. The scene, including Schumann's preparations, was also filmed on 16-mm film from the same perspective by camera man Dieter Hoffmann. Schumann went from West Berlin into West Germany, where he settled in Bavaria. In 1962, he met and married Kunigunde Gunda in G√ºnzburg. They had a son the next year. He took up a new job at a winery and eventually at the Audi car assembly factory in Ingolstadt, where he worked for nearly 30 years. Later life and death Schumann inspired graffiti in the East Side Gallery After the fall of the Berlin Wall Schumann said, \\"Only since 9 November 1989 [the date of the fall] have I felt truly free.\\" Even so, he continued to feel more at home in Bavaria than in his birthplace, citing old frictions with his former colleagues, and was even hesitant to visit his parents and siblings in Saxony. On 20 June 1998, suffering from depression, he committed suicide, hanging himself in his orchard near the town of Kipfenberg in Upper Bavaria. His body was found by his wife a few hours later. In May 2011, the photograph of Schumann's \\"leap into freedom\\" was inducted into the UNESCO Memory of the World programme as part of a collection of documents on the fall of the Berlin Wall.Diekmann, Kai.

The Iron Arrow Honor Society is an honor society at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida for students, faculty, staff and alumni. It is the highest honor that can be bestowed by the university.\\"Arrowheads,\\" Miami magazine, Fall 2000. Founded at the University of Miami in 1926, the society admits about thirty members annually, including undergraduates, students at the School of Law, and Miller School of Medicine, alumni, and faculty/staff/administrators. Membership requires unanimous votes of the membership. Criteria include scholarship, leadership, character, humility, and love of alma mater. History Historically, the society was male-only, founded as the \\"Highest Honor Attained by Men.\\" In 1937, Nu Kappa Tau, a separate sister organization, was founded as \\"The Highest Honor Attained by Women.\\" In 1966, Nu Kappa Tau became affiliated with the national women's honor society, Mortar Board, and as Randy Femmer wrote in his book Iron Arrow: A History,\\"leaving Iron Arrow to carry the tradition alone\\". In 1976, the federal government notified the University of Miami that it was providing significant assistance to Iron Arrow in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. The university responded by having Iron Arrow move its tapping ceremony off campus and negotiated with it to accept women members. In turn, Iron Arrow sued the federal government seeking the right to continue on campus as a male-only organization. In 1982, University President Edward T. Foote II wrote to Iron Arrow stating that regardless of how the court case came out, Iron Arrow would not be allowed back on campus as a male-only organization. This rendered the court case moot before it was scheduled to be heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, in Iron Arrow Honor Soc. v. Heckler, In 1985, breaking with over forty years of tradition, the society's all-male membership voted to admit women, and Iron Arrow was allowed back on campus.

Ringgold departed Mare Island Navy Yard 18 November 1918 to join the Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. After transiting the Panama Canal, Ringgold called at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before arriving Hampton Roads, Virginia on 5 December 1918. She cruised along the U.S. east coast into 1922, operating generally out of Newport, Rhode Island, Ringgold put into Philadelphia Navy Yard 5 April 1922 where she was decommissioned 17 June 1922 and placed in reserve. =Royal Navy= HMS Newark during World War II After remaining inactive for almost two decades, Ringgold recommissioned 23 August 1940 preparatory to transfer to Britain along with 49 other old flush-deckers as part of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement. Ringgold was formally transferred to Britain 26 November 1940 at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and renamed HMS Newark in honor of towns in both Britain and the United States.

They include the structures called vihara, chaitya, stupa, wat and pagoda in different regions and languages. Temples in Buddhism represent the pure land or pure environment of a Buddha. Traditional Buddhist temples are designed to inspire inner and outer peace. Architecture Its architecture and structure varies from region to region. Usually, the temple consists not only of its buildings, but also the surrounding environment. The Buddhist temples are designed to symbolize five elements: fire, air, earth, water and wisdom. India The design of temples in India was influenced by the idea of a place of worship as a representation of the universe. For Buddhist temple complexes one tall temple is often centrally located and surrounded by smaller temples and walls. This is symbolic of Buddhist imagining of the universe with Mount Meru at the center surrounded by oceans, lesser mountains and a huge wall. A Chaitya, Chaitya hall or Chaitya-griha refers to a shrine, sanctuary, temple or prayer hall in Indian religions. The term is most common in Buddhism, where it refers to a space with a stupa and a rounded apse at the end opposite the entrance, and a high roof with a rounded profile. Strictly speaking, the chaitya is the stupa itself, and the Indian buildings are chaitya halls, but this distinction is often not observed. Many of the early Chaitya were rock-cut, as in Karla caves or Ajanta. Tall circular Buddhist temple, early 1st Century CE, Mathura Museum. Some of the earliest free-standing temples may have been of a circular type. Ashoka also built the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya circa 250 BCE, a circular structure, in order to protect the Bodhi tree under which the Buddha had found enlightenment. The Bairat Temple is also a round structure, which can be seen through archaeological remains. Representations of this early temple structure are found on a 100 BCE relief sculpted on the railing of the stupa at BhƒÅrhut, as well as in Sanchi.\\"Sowing the Seeds of the Lotus: A Journey to the Great Pilgrimage Sites of Buddhism, Part I\\" by John C.

In contemporary Indonesian Buddhist perspective, Candi refers to a shrine, either ancient or new. Several contemporary viharas in Indonesia for example, contain the actual-size replica or reconstruction of famous Buddhist temples, such as the replica of Pawon and Plaosan's perwara (small) temples. In Buddhism, the role of a candi as a shrine is sometimes interchangeable with a stupa, a domed structure to store Buddhist relics or the ashes of cremated Buddhist priests, patrons or benefactors. Borobudur, Muara Takus and Batujaya for example are actually elaborate stupas. In modern Indonesian language, the term candi can be translated as \\"temple\\" or similar structure, especially of Hindu and Buddhist faiths. Thus temples of Cambodia (such as the Angkor Wat), Champa (Central and Southern Vietnam), Thailand, Laos, Myanmar and India are also called candi in Indonesian. Japanese Buddhism Buddhist temple of Kinkaku-ji, declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Japanese Buddhist temples typically include a Main Hall. A distinctive feature is the chinjusha, a Shinto shrine devoted to the temple's kami. Buddhism co-existed with shintoism, but in the 8th century Buddhism became the state religion and Buddhist temples were built.

The brigade fought on the Western Front during World War I, and in Normandy and north-west Europe during World War II. It formed part of the 4th Canadian Division.  History  = World War I = The 10th Brigade was part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force raised during the First World War. It participated in every major Canadian engagement from the Somme (from August 1916) to the last 100 days (1918). The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade consisted of four battalions, and formed part of the 4th Division. The battalions were the 44th Battalion, the 46th Battalion, the 47th Battalion and the 50th Battalion. = World War II = The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade was first assembled at Nanaimo, British Columbia in October 1940, although Nanaimo was not established as its headquarters until February 1941. In April 1941 it was moved east to the Niagara area, exchanging places with the 13th Canadian Infantry Brigade. During World War II, it was part of the Canadian 4th Armoured Division, alongside the 4th Canadian Armoured Brigade. The brigade consisted of the following units: *The Lincoln and Welland Regiment *The Algonquin Regiment *The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's) *10 Canadian Infantry Brigade Ground Defence Platoon (Lorne Scots)  Normandy  As part of the 4th Armoured Division, the 10th Brigade did not arrive in Normandy until the end of July 1944. It was present for Operation Totalize, Operation Tractable, and the Battle of Falaise. After reaching the River Seine, they advanced along the French coast to Belgium.  North West Europe  After France and Belgium the Brigade still part of 4th Armoured was involved in the critical Battle of the Scheldt, to open the port of Antwerp, to Allied shipping. Next came Operation Veritable clearing the land between the Rhine and Roer rivers and their last major operation of the war the Battle of the Reichswald.  Battle of Moerbrugge  The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade was tasked to cross the Ghent Canal about five kilometers south of Bruges at a small village called Oostkamp in early September 1944. Directly across the canal from Oostkamp was another small village named Moerbrugge. The canal is about 20 metres wide and very deep. Opposition was not expected so only one battalion was chosen for the crossing: The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's), the Argylls. Two batteries of the 15th Field Regiment, RCA were placed in support and The South Alberta Regiment (SARs) would place its tanks on the friendly side of the canal at either side of the crossing point and hold the flanks of the crossing with their fire along with the Vickers machine guns of The New Brunswick Rangers. The mortars of the Argylls and the mortars of the Rangers were in support.

Swift boats on patrol lead a group of monitors and armored landing craft. Four Swift Boats in Vietnam, showing rear mounted over/under .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine gun and breech-loading mortar Patrol Craft Fast (PCF), also known as Swift Boats, were all-aluminum, long, shallow-draft vessels operated by the United States Navy, initially to patrol the coastal areas and later for work in the interior waterways as part of the brown-water navy to interdict Vietcong movement of arms and munitions, transport Vietnamese forces and insert SEAL teams for counterinsurgency (COIN) operations during the Vietnam War.  Development  = Conception = The Swift Boat was conceived in a Naval Advisory Group, Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (NAVADGRP MACV) staff study titled \\"Naval Craft Requirements in a Counter Insurgency Environment,\\" published 1 February 1965. It noted that \\"counterinsurgency water operations are difficult, demanding, and unique. A prevalent belief has been that COIN craft can readily be obtained from existing commercial and naval sources when needed. Unfortunately, no concerted effort has been made to develop COIN craft specifically suited to perform the many missions needed to combat insurgent activities.\\" The study went on to list characteristics of the ideal patrol craft: * Reliable and sturdy * Non-wooden hull, with screw and rudder protection against groundings * Self-sufficient for 400 to 500 mile (600 to 800 km) patrol * Speed of 20 to 25 knots (37 to 46 km/h) * Small high- resolution radar range 4 to 6 miles (7 to 11 km) * Reliable long-range communications equipment, compatible with Army and Air Force * Quiet * Armament for limited offense * Sparse berthing, no messing * Depth meter, accurate from 0 to 50 feet (15 m) * Small, powerful searchlight The study was positively received, and the Navy began to search for sources. Sewart Seacraft of Berwick, Louisiana, built water taxis for companies operating oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, which appeared nearly ideal. The Navy bought their plans, and asked Sewart Seacraft to prepare modified drawings that included a gun tub, ammo lockers, bunks, and a small galley. The Navy used those enhanced plans to request bids from other boat builders. Sewart Seacraft was chosen to build the boats. = Mark I = PCF-32 on patrol The Swift Boats had welded aluminum hulls about long with beam, and draft of about five feet (1.5 m). They were powered by a pair of General Motors 12V71\\"N\\" Detroit marine diesel engines rated at each, with a design range from at to about at . The normal complement for a Swift Boat was six: an officer in charge (skipper), a boatswains mate, a radar/radioman (radarman), an engineer (engineman), and two gunners (quartermaster and gunner's mate). In 1969 the crew was supplemented with a Vietnamese trainee. The first two PCFs were delivered to the Navy in late August 1965. The original water taxi design had been enhanced with two .50 caliber M2 Browning machine guns in a turret above the pilot house, an over-and-under .50-caliber machine gun ‚Äì 81 mm mortar combination mounted on the rear deck, a mortar ammunition box on the stern, improved habitability equipment such as bunks, a refrigerator and freezer, and a sink. The 81 mm combination mortar mounted on the rear deck was not a gravity firing mortar as used by the Army and Marine Corps, in which the falling projectile's primer struck the fixed firing pin at the base of the mortar tube, but a unique lanyard firing weapon in which the projectile was still loaded into the muzzle. The gunner could \\"fire at will\\" by the use of the lanyard. The weapon had been tested in the 1950s and discarded as the U.S. Navy lost interest in the system. The United States Coast Guard maintained the gun/mortar system before the Navy incorporated it into the PCF program. Many boats also mounted a single M60 machine gun in the forward peak tank, just in front of the forward superstructure. The original order for 50 boats was followed shortly by an additional order for 54 more Mark Is. = Mark II & III = In the latter half of 1967, 46 Mark II boats, with a modified deck house set further back from the bow. The newer boats also had round port holes (replacing larger sliding windows) in the aft superstructure. From 1969 through 1972, 33 Mark IIIs, which were a larger version of the Mark IIs, arrived in Vietnam.  Use  Most of the 193 PCFs built were used by the U.S. Navy in Vietnam and the two training bases in California. About 80 of the boats constructed were sold or given away to nations friendly to the United States. The original training base for Swift Boats was at the Naval Base in Coronado, California. In 1969 training was moved to Mare Island near San Pablo Bay, California, where it remained for the duration of the war. Though not a deep water boat, PCF training boats frequently transited from Mare Island, through the Golden Gate Bridge to cruise either north or south along the Pacific Ocean coastline. PCF-8 sank in a storm off Bodega Bay, California in December 1969. This was the only Swift Boat lost during training operations. No crewmen were lost in the event. = Vietnam service = PCFs carry a group of Vietnamese marines up a narrow canal for insertion. The first Swift Boats arrived in Vietnam in October 1965. The boats were initially used as coastal patrol craft in Operation Market Time, interdicting seaborne supplies on their way to the Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese Army in South Vietnam. However, the design's shallow draft and low freeboard limited their seaworthiness in open waters. These limitations, plus the difficulties being encountered in the interior waterways by the smaller, more lightly armed PBRs, led to the incorporation of Swifts to patrol the 1,500 miles of rivers and canals of Vietnam's interior waterways.Symmes War on the Rivers p. 95 Swift Boats continued to operate along the Vietnamese coastal areas, but with the start of Admiral Elmo Zumwalt's \\"SEALORDS\\" riverway interdiction strategy, their primary area of operations soon centered upon the C√† Mau Peninsula and the Mekong Delta area in the southern tip of Vietnam. Here they patrolled the waterways and performed special operations, including gunfire support, troop insertion and evacuation, and raids into enemy territory. The Mekong Delta is composed of ten thousand square miles of marshland, swamps and forested areas. The region is interlaced by rivers and canal ways. Controlled by the Viet Cong, the interior waterways of the Mekong Delta were used to transport Viet Cong supplies and weapons. Swift Boats generally operated in teams of three to five. Each boat had an officer in charge, one of whom would also be placed in overall charge of the mission. Their missions included patrolling the waterways, searching water traffic for weapons and munitions, transporting Vietnamese marine units and inserting Navy SEAL teams. When the swift boats began making forays up the waterways into the interior of the delta, they initially took the carriers by surprise, causing them to drop their materials and run off into the overgrowth. Occasionally a short firefight would break out. As it became clear that control of the waterways was being contested, the Viet Cong developed a number of tactics to challenge the U.S. Navy. They set up ambushes, built obstructions in the canals to create choke points, and began to place mines in the waterways. For the Swifts, coming back down river was always more dangerous then going up river. The passage of a patrol assured their eventual return, providing an opportunity for the Viet Cong. Ambushes were typically short lived affairs, set up at a river bend or in a narrow canal that restricted the maneuverability of the boats.Symmes War on the Rivers p. 148 A wide variety of portable weapons were used in attacks, including recoilless rifles, B-40 rockets, .50 caliber machine guns and AK-47s, often fired from behind earthen bunkered positions.Symmes War on the Rivers p. 136 Engagements were brief and violent, with the ambushers often slipping away into the undergrowth when the boats located the source of attack and began to concentrate their return fire. When attacked the boats would accelerate out of the hot zone, turn and then return as a group, firing as many of their guns as they could bring to bear. They would power past the ambush point, turn and return to attack again till the ambushers were either killed or slipped away. Though most cruising and patrolling was done at 8 to 10 knots, the boats could reach a top speed of 32 knots. Thick brush and vegetation in the delta provided excellent cover for the escaping ambushers. Casualties taken among the river crews were high. Casualties suffered among the Viet Cong were difficult to assess, as they would take their dead and wounded away from a firefight. Discovering newly dug graveyards was one of the few ways to confirm Viet Cong losses.Symmes War on the Rivers p. 173 The first Swift Boat to be lost during the war was PCF-4, which was lost to a mine in 1966. Two boats, PCF-14 and PCF-76, were lost in rough seas at the mouth of the Cua Viet River near the DMZ, and a third, PCF-77, was lost in a rescue effort during a monsoon at the mouth of the Perfume River on the approach to Hu·∫ø. All three of these boats were lost in 1966. PCF-41 was lost that same year in an ambush when it was hit by fire from a 57 mm recoilless rifle. Its controls destroyed and coxswain killed, it ran aground at speed. When the crew ran out of ammunition it had to be abandoned. She was recovered the next day but was too badly damaged to be repaired. She was salvaged instead. PCF-43 was lost to a rocket attack in 1969.Symmes War on the Rivers pp. 120-122 Several other Swift Boats had been lost to river mines, but had been salvaged and either repaired or used for spare parts.  Controversy over loss of PCF-19  PCF-38 patrols the Cai Ngay canal Just past midnight on 16 June 1968, PCF-19 was attacked from the air, struck by two missiles and sunk. Four of her crew members were killed, and two others badly injured. The boat had been patrolling with PCF-12 near the DMZ (17th parallel) when they were attacked by hovering aircraft. PCF-12 commenced a running gun battle, firing its .50 caliber machine guns and zig zagging at high speed for well over an hour. During this battle, PCF-12 continuously radioed that it was under attack by an unidentified hovering aircraft. Response from command was \\"no friendly aircraft in the area\\". In order to isolate the problem, U.S. Forces suspended all flying operations within PCF-12's area of operation. Despite this measure, PCF-12 continued to be engaged with the enemy. The following day, a friendly fire incident occurred when U.S. jet aircraft accidentally attacked the Australian destroyer and the heavy cruiser . U.S. rocket fire killed two Australian sailors and injured 11 others, while slightly damaging Hobart and Boston. Parts of the rockets were later recovered and were identified as American. After all reports had been submitted, the attacks on the two allied warships were attributed to friendly fire from US fixed-wing aircraft. The attacks on PCF-19 and PCF-12 were also attributed to friendly fire from these aircraft. A primary feature in the confusion was that the attack upon the Swift Boats and the unidentified hovering aircraft started between midnight and 0100 hours on 16 June, and the attacks on Boston and Hobart occurred during the same time the following day, 17 June. However these were two separate dates, and two separate incidents. When the reports were completed these two events were conflated, and both were attributed to friendly fire. It has been theorized by both officers and men of the U.S. Army, USMC, and USN that the NVA were operating helicopters at Tiger Island, located just off the North Vietnamese coast. Hovering aircraft had been seen near the DMZ by U.S. Marines on shore. Official reports, such as OIC and the PCF-12s Combat After Action Report dated \\"20 OCT 1967\\" (1968?) for \\"Market Time Patrol,\\" \\"151130H JUN-161130H JUN 1968,\\" mentions in part \\"...enemy held Tiger Island...possible base of operations for North Vietnamese military...\\" and \\"under constant air attack from all angles, Helo gunners ordered to fire the .50 caliber guns at any and all air contacts....\\" Declassified official reports note \\"enemy aircraft\\" did in fact operate in the area. Enough evidence is present to conclude that the loss of PCF-19 was due to fire from a helicopter aircraft operated by or for the North Vietnamese. As of 2006, the attack upon PCF-12 and PCF-19 is still regarded by the U.S. Navy as a friendly fire incident. = In training = The most frequent training area for the Mare Island units was the marshland that forms the northern shoreline of San Francisco Bay. This area, now known as the Napa Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, was also used by United States Navy Reserve unit PBRs (Patrol Boat, River) up until 1995, when Mare Island was scheduled for base closure. During those years in which the Swifts and PBRs were operating, motorists traveling along Highway 37 from Vallejo, which passes Mare Island, to the Bay Area would often see the riverine boats making their way through the various sloughs of the current wildlife area. U.S. Naval Riverine Training is still authorized in the waters of the State Wildlife Area, and portions of the TV History Channel Series Gunboats of Vietnam, were filmed there. =In service of the Vietnam People's Navy= The Vietnam People's Navy managed to capture a number of South Vietnam's defunct Navy PCFs after the unification of Vietnam in 1975. The PCFs were quickly used in the PAVN's operation at Th·ªï Chu and other islands to repel the invasion of the Khmer Rouge. The swift boats are still active in the current Vietnam Navy.Kh√°m ph√° v≈© kh√≠ m·ªõi tr√™n t√†u PCF VN sau n√¢ng c·∫•p  Operators  * - U.S. Navy * - Philippine Navy & Philippine Coast Guard * - Republic of Vietnam Navy * - Khmer National Navy * Khmer Rouge, captured from the US Navy and Khmer National Navy * - Royal Thai Navy * - Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta * - SENAN * - Vietnam People's Army, taken from the former South Vietnam Navy  Current  marine cutter at Hay Wharf, Floriana, Malta as they await transfer at the end of their careers. The Mediterranean island nation of Malta was one of the last operators to make use of two Swift Boats in the Maritime Squadron of the Armed Forces of Malta (AFM). The Swifts were built at the time of the Vietnam war, with the two vessels used in Malta having started their life as training vessels. These craft, transferred by the U.S. government in 1971 when Dr. George Borg Olivier was still Prime Minister, carried hull numbers C23 and C24 respectively (later renamed P23 and P24) and, while somewhat modified, maintained the look of the original riverine warfare boats. The two small inshore patrol boats became the work horses of the AFM's Maritime Squadron and were only retired once four new Austal patrol boats were commissioned in 2010. Former U.S. Navy Vietnam veterans, from the Swift Boat Sailors' Association, visited Malta in 2010 and said the Malta Swifts were the last two still in service, out of hundreds that were built. One of the two patrol boats headed back to the United States to become a memorial in summer 2012 at the Maritime Museum of San Diego in California. The museum has a display paying tribute to the Maltese servicemen who died on board the P23 (the sister vessel of P24) during an accident that occurred on September 7, 1984. The incident ‚Äì known as the C23 tragedy and the worst peace-time accident suffered by Maltese services personnel ‚Äì killed five AFM soldiers and two policemen when illegal fireworks about to be dumped into the sea exploded on the bow of the small patrol boat. The AFM retained P23 as a memorial to those killed in the explosion. P23 was also depicted on a Maltese postage stamp commemorating the island's maritime heritage on 10 August 2011. Swift boats are still active in the Vietnam People's Navy, who obtained a number of vessels from the Republic of Vietnam's naval forces. The Vietnamese Navy carried out several changes to the vessel's armament. The American M2 machine gun was replaced by a domestically produced 12.7 mm NSV gun which had fewer jamming problems and was easier for the crews to maintain. The electronic and communication systems were also overhauled. There are two operational PCFs in the United States today. R/V Matthew F. Maury is operated by Tidewater Community College in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Formerly PCF-2, the vessel was awarded to the college in 1995 and has been used in oceanographic research and education since then. It is berthed at JEB Little Creek and operates in and around Chesapeake Bay. The second operational PCF, PCF-816 (formerly P-24 in the service of Malta) is operational in San Diego, California at the Maritime Museum of San Diego. The boat makes regular runs on weekends and is staffed with former Swift Boat sailors as narrators. There are two Swift Boats preserved in static displays in the United States. Both are former U.S. Navy Swift Boats that were originally stationed in California to train PCF crews. One is located at the Navy Museum at Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C.; the second Swift Boat is on the Naval Special Weapons Base at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado, California, the original home of PCF training.  Notable personnel  Those who served on the boats in Vietnam and later became politicians include Nebraska Governor and U.S. Senator Bob Kerrey, a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor, and Arizona Congressman Jim Kolbe, who served in the United States Navy.The Vietnam War and the Congressman of the 1980s, New York Times, David K. Shipler, May 28, 1986. Retrieved May 7, 2020. U.S. Senator and Secretary of State John Kerry commanded a Swift Boat when he served in Vietnam. LTJG Kerry was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts during riverine combat in a PCF. As the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, then-Senator Kerry's military record was attacked by a political 527 group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Ever since, the term \\"swiftboating\\" has entered American political jargon associating swift boat service with political smear tactics. In an article in the New York Times on June 30, 2008, Swift Boat veterans objected to the prevalent use of the verb \\"swiftboating\\" as this type of ad hominem attack, stating that it is disrespectful to the men who served and died on the PCFs during Vietnam.

Of the 42 species that have been recognized, 39 and 21 of these are endemic to North America and the United States, respectively. They all have very reduced shoots and leaves (mostly reduced to scales) with the bulk of the plant living under the host's bark. Recently the number of species within the genus has been reduced to 26 as a result of more detailed genetic analysis. Description Female plant of A. vaginatum susbp. cryptopodum on Ponderosa pine. They are dioecious, individual plants being either male or female. The fruit is unusual in that it builds up hydrostatic pressure internally when ripe and shoots the single sticky seed up to speeds nearly , an example of rapid plant movement. The lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe, Arceuthobium americanum, has been found to explosively-disperse its seeds through thermogenesis., Rolena A.J. deBruyn, Mark Paetkau, Kelly A. Ross, David V. Godfrey & Cynthia Ross Friedman. Thermogenesis-triggered seed dispersal in dwarf mistletoe. Dwarf mistletoe seeds are enveloped in a hygroscopic, glue- like substance called viscin. Many fail to land on a suitable host's shoot, but some succeed, and in this way they are spread through the forests as a pest front. The spread of dwarf mistletoes in forest stands is greatest from the overstory to the understory, owing to gravity. Advantageous stand conditions for the spread of the parasite include an uneven-aged stand structure with severely infected hosts in dominant and codominant crown classes, species composition dominated by the primary host, and tree densities between 175 and 500 trees/ha. There are also several species from Europe and Asia including one of the smallest in the genus, A. minutissimum that lives on its host, Pinus wallichiana in the Himalayas. Effects of parasitism In western forest ecosystems of North America, numerous dwarf mistletoe species are considered to be serious forest-borne disease agents. Severe dwarf mistletoe infection can result in a reduction in tree growth, premature tree mortality, reduced seed and cone development, and reduced wood quality, and increases the susceptibility of the host tree to pathogen and/or insect attack. Most of the commercially important conifers in western North America are parasitized by one or more dwarf mistletoes. The interaction between dwarf mistletoes and their host can be generalized as a source-to-sink relationship. Dwarf mistletoes derive the majority of their nutrition from the host‚Äôs vascular tissues. Dwarf mistletoes have a root-like endophytic system, composed of primary and secondary haustoria, which invade, but do not injure, both the xylem and phloem of the host. Because this root-like endophytic system is not soilborne, dwarf mistletoes are dependent solely on their host for water. Along a xylem-to-xylem link, dwarf mistletoes draw water from their host using the difference in water potential between parasite and host. The greater transpiration rate of the dwarf mistletoe produces a lower water potential, allowing water to flow from host to parasite. The water gradient or transpiration stream is consistently maintained, even when the host is under moderate water deficit. In addition to host-water dependence, dwarf mistletoes must acquire carbohydrate and mineral nutrition from their hosts. Dwarf mistletoes have both chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and the necessary mechanisms for photosynthesis, but chlorophyll concentrations in dwarf mistletoes are approximately 1/5 to 1/10 of those found in their host‚Äôs foliage, and dwarf mistletoes have low photosynthetic rates as measured by the rate of carbon fixation. The principal carbohydrate transported from the host to dwarf mistletoe is sucrose. Because dwarf mistletoes are phloem-deficient, they draw carbohydrates from their hosts by connections to the host phloem and ray parenchyma. The rate of carbohydrate transport varies by season, but dwarf mistletoes continuously draw carbohydrates from their hosts throughout the year. Dwarf mistletoe rating system A standardized system called the Hawksworth 6-class mistletoe rating system (DMR) has been devised to determine how much dwarf mistletoe has infected a tree. To use this system, the living part of the tree crown needs to be broken up into 3 sections, (top, middle, bottom). Each section is then rated either 0, 1, or 2 with a score of 0 being assigned for a uninfected section, 1 for light infection with less than half of the branches infected, or 2 for heavy infection with over half of the branches infected. The 3 numbers are then added together to give the total rating for the tree.

He is known primarily for his classification of Bantu languages, Guthrie 1971. The classification, though based more on geography than linguistic relatedness, is nonetheless the most widely used. Together with the Belgian linguist Achille √âmile Meeussen (1912-1978), he is regarded as one of the two leading Bantu specialists of the second half of the 20th century.Schadeberg, Thilo C., in Nurse & Philippson (eds.) (2003), p. 144. Early life and career Malcolm Guthrie was born in Hove, Sussex, England, the son of a Scottish father and a mother of Dutch extraction. After schooling at Ipswich, he took a degree in metallurgy at Imperial College, London. Shortly afterwards, however, he felt called to the Baptist ministry. He served for two years as minister of a Baptist church in Rochester, during which time he married Margaret Near, the daughter of a Baptist minister at a neighbouring church. In 1932 he went as a missionary to Kinshasa in the then Belgian Congo, where he worked for the next eight years. It was here that he studied the Lingala language and several other local languages.Arnott (1973). Works Guthrie's first major work was The Classification of the Bantu Languages (1948), in which he tried to define the set of Bantu languages. It was in this work that the first version of the famous coding of these languages into geographical \\"zones\\" first appeared. The magnum opus of Guthrie is Comparative Bantu, which appeared in 4 volumes published in 1967 (volume 1), 1970 (volumes 3 and 4), and 1971 (volume 2).Guthrie (1967) The 4 volumes provide not only a genetic classification but also a reconstruction of Proto-Bantu as the Proto- language of the Bantu language family. For his reconstruction, Guthrie drew data from 28 so-called \\"test languages\\" that were picked more or less randomly. It has been argued, for example by Wilhelm M√∂hlig, that this renders his reconstruction unreliable, since the reconstructed forms, and hence the genetic tree, would be different if one changed the selection of languages.M√∂hlig (1974). Guthrie also published extensively on a wide range of Bantu languages, including Lingala,Guthrie & Carrington (1988). Bemba, Mfinu, and Teke.  References  Bibliography * Arnott, D.W.

She appears in The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003) and three of its sequels, Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007) and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017). She is portrayed by Keira Knightley (and as a child by Lucinda Dryzek in the prologue of The Curse of the Black Pearl). She is known to use the alias \\"Elizabeth Turner\\", but this later becomes her married name when she weds Will Turner. Personality Elizabeth is a spirited, intelligent, and independent-minded character whose beauty attracted Will Turner, James Norrington, Sao Feng, and Captain Jack Sparrow. Only Will Turner's affections were reciprocated, although she struggled with a subtle attraction and kiss with Sparrow, and a compassionate friendship with Norrington. Throughout the three films, she transforms from a young girl to a proper lady and finally into a courageous pirate. Elizabeth has always been fascinated by piracy, but she is often revolted by pirates' aggressive, wild nature. Even after becoming a pirate, Elizabeth retains her refined ways, as well as her loyalty and compassion for loved ones (including Will Turner, her father, and later, Jack Sparrow and James Norrington). Elizabeth adapts easily to piracy, having natural leadership abilities. She learns seamanship quickly, and finds that she has an innate talent for battle strategy. She learns swordsmanship from Will, and is soon capable of defending herself against multiple opponents, fighting with two swords simultaneously. She later uses a Chinese Jian sword and also carries a multitude of other weapons on her person including knives, firearms, and what appears to be a small grenade. She freely speaks her mind even if it offends others; for example, she calls a potentially dangerous enemy, Sao Feng, a coward. During her reign as Pirate King, Elizabeth proves to be a charismatic leader and inspires the other pirate lords to battle Cutler Beckett's fleet. Elizabeth's darker side is shown when she sacrifices Jack Sparrow to the Kraken so she and the crew can escape. However, she feels so guilty about it that she later helps rescue Sparrow from Davy Jones' Locker. Appearance Following the film's prologue, Elizabeth Swann is approximately 18 or 19 years old in The Curse of the Black Pearl, about 20 years old in Dead Man‚Äôs Chest, (around 21-22 years old in At World‚Äôs End, and roughly 39-40 years old in Dead Men Tell No Tales. Elizabeth is about 5' 7\\" tall with a slender figure, brown eyes, and dark blonde hair which later lightens to a sun-kissed blonde/brown. Having been raised in aristocratic society as a royal governor's daughter, Elizabeth is a refined and elegant young lady but also has a feisty and strong-willed personality. She is also very beautiful, attracting the attention of most of the major male characters in the series. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, she wears a dress style known as a Robe a L'Anglaise. As a young girl, she wears a blue dress in this style, and, eight years later, her father presents her with a gold- colored frock to wear at Commodore Norrington's promotion ceremony. Elizabeth is kidnapped wearing a long, floral cream-colored dressing gown, though Captain Barbossa later insists she wear a red dress, previously owned by another lady; she is forced to return it prior to walking the plank and being marooned on a deserted island, clad only in a long white chemise . After being rescued by Commodore Norrington, Elizabeth is loaned a Royal Navy uniform, the first time she is seen in men's attire. At Jack Sparrow's execution, she is once again fashionably attired, wearing a peach-colored gown and a picture hat. In Dead Man's Chest, as Elizabeth's character and circumstances change, so does her wardrobe. Although she is first seen in an elegant wedding gown and a long lace veil, Elizabeth later disguises herself as a cabin boy, wearing brown breeches, a white shirt, brown boots, a red waistcoat, a black belt, and a brown tricorne hat. She wears this garb throughout the film. Exposure to the sun tans her skin and lightens her hair. In At World's End, Elizabeth first appears in Chinese peasant clothing and a coolie hat while paddling a small boat through Singapore's waters. She is forced to wear only a short robe upon entering Sao Feng's bathhouse. Later, Elizabeth wears a long armored coat while traveling. As a captive aboard Sao Feng's ship, Elizabeth has been dressed in a long red cheongsam, a sleeveless full-length blue overcoat (both probably silk), and a studded turquoise phoenix crown. She later dons Chinese battle dress. During her one-day on the island with Will, she is clad in a black tunic. In the scene set ten years later, she is wearing a long skirt and a double-breasted brocade waistcoat over a white puffy- sleeved shirt, probably cotton or linen. Fictional biography =The Curse of the Black Pearl= Throughout the trilogy, Elizabeth Swann is portrayed as a spirited, intelligent, and independent-minded character who often chafes at the restrictions imposed on her gender and social rank. Early on in the first movie she often fantasizes about pirates and life at sea. This may have been fueled somewhat by her association with another character, Will Turner, who eleven-year-old Elizabeth met when she and her father, Governor Weatherby Swann were en route to Port Royal eight years earlier. Will, also about eleven, was found adrift at sea, the sole survivor of a pirate attack. During his rescue, Elizabeth briefly glimpsed a mysterious ship slipping into the mist--a vessel foreshadowing her destiny. The story continues eight years later, and Elizabeth is now a marriageable age. Back then, as matrimony was a common means to forge strategic political alliances and advantageous social connections rather than loving unions, she is expected to wed a respectable and prosperous man equal or superior to her in rank. Elizabeth prefers marrying for love, and she may secretly harbor feelings for Will Turner. But Will, a common blacksmith, is an unsuitable match for such a well-born lady. And although Will secretly loves Elizabeth, he knows his place and keeps his feelings deeply hidden. Governor Swann, meanwhile, desires that his daughter marry Commodore James Norrington, a respected Royal Navy officer who Elizabeth admires but does not love. Ironically, it is Norrington who sets events into motion that not only alter Elizabeth's fate, but also his own and Will's. During Norrington's marriage proposal, Elizabeth, whose tightly laced corset nearly suffocates her, faints and falls off a rampart and into the bay. Her unlikely rescuer, and the catalyst for her transformation from a demure lady into a daring pirate, is the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow, newly arrived in Port Royal to commandeer a ship. Despite Sparrow's gallant actions and against Elizabeth's protests, he is promptly jailed for piracy and sentenced to hang. That night, a pirate ship, the Black Pearl, raids Port Royal. It is the same ship Elizabeth spied in the fog eight years earlier. When she is taken hostage it is discovered that she possesses Will's gold medallion that she took from him after his rescue, fearing it marked him as a pirate. Invoking parley, Elizabeth negotiates with Captain Barbossa to leave Port Royal in exchange for the coin. He agrees but keeps her captive on a technicality after she identifies herself as Elizabeth \\"Turner\\", mistakenly believing her blood can break an ancient Aztec curse the pirates are under. Their true forms -- immortal skeletons --can only be seen in moonlight. Will's love for Elizabeth motivates his actions and helps drive the story; he will do anything to save her, including piracy. And though the peaceful and law-abiding Will despises pirates and distrusts Sparrow, he frees him, knowing only Sparrow can locate Isla de Muerta, the secret island where Elizabeth is being held. Will is unaware, however, that Jack Sparrow is the Black Pearl's former captain and that he has an ulterior motive for helping him: Turner blood and the gold medallion can break the Aztec curse--Sparrow intends to barter Will to Barbossa in exchange for the Black Pearl. When Will and Elizabeth escape Isla de Muerta, Barbossa pursues and captures their ship, sinking it. Will and the crew are thrown in the Pearl's brig, while Elizabeth and Sparrow are marooned on a deserted island. Elizabeth's feisty, self-sufficient nature propels her into taking action for their rescue by burning a cache of smugglers' rum. The towering smoke column is spotted by Commodore Norrington aboard Dauntless. To rescue Will, Elizabeth convinces Norrington to attack Isla de Muerta by impulsively accepting his previous marriage proposal. The commodore doubts her sincerity, though Elizabeth apparently intends to honor her promise, sacrificing her own happiness to save Will. She says nothing about the curse while Sparrow provides the bearings to Isla de Muerta, setting his own plan into motion. At Isla de Muerta, Elizabeth frees Sparrow's crew from the Pearl's brig, naively believing they will rescue Will and Sparrow. Abiding by the pirate code that, \\"any man who falls behind, is left behind,\\" they instead commandeer the Black Pearl and set sail, leaving a disgusted Elizabeth to rescue Will and Sparrow alone. As the navy battles the pirates, Sparrow duels Barbossa inside the treasure cave, while Elizabeth joins Will in fighting the remaining cursed crew. Sparrow fatally shoots Barbossa, who, upon reverting to mortal form as the curse is lifted, falls dead. The surviving now-mortal pirates surrender. Will, Elizabeth, and Sparrow are rescued, although Sparrow is later condemned to hang. In Port Royal, Elizabeth attends Sparrow's execution. Will, who has been pardoned, approaches and proclaims his love for her before attempting to rescue Sparrow. Will frees Sparrow, but they are quickly captured, though Norrington and Governor Swann are reluctant to arrest Will or resume Sparrow's execution. Elizabeth intervenes and declares her love for Will. Norrington releases Will and concedes Elizabeth's hand to him. Sparrow, meanwhile, falls off the rampart and into the bay just as the Black Pearl sails into view. He is hauled aboard, captain once again. Apparently impressed by the wily pirate, Norrington allows the Black Pearl one day's head start before giving chase. =Dead Man's Chest= The film opens a year later, and Elizabeth is seen waiting at the altar where she and Will Turner were to be wed. Lord Cutler Beckett and the British Navy arrive, bringing Will, who is shackled in irons. Elizabeth and Will are charged with aiding Sparrow's escape; the punishment is death. Former Commodore James Norrington is also implicated, although he has since resigned his commission and disappeared. Lord Beckett offers clemency if Will agrees to search for Jack Sparrow and bring him back his magical compass. Beckett, a ruthless East India Trading Company agent, is extending the company's monopolistic stronghold over the entire Caribbean. Honest merchants and traders are forced to pay exorbitant fees and surcharges to ply their goods in EITC-controlled ports, an action amounting to little more than legal piracy. With Jack's compass, Becket can eradicate all pirates, thus securing and expanding the company's territory and increasing its profits while consolidating his own power and wealth. Beckett implies he has a personal score to settle with Jack Sparrow, though it is never revealed in the series what this is. However, it is revealed that Beckett was responsible for branding Sparrow for piracy. Once again, Elizabeth's freedom is dependent upon Will procuring Sparrow's help. Will finally locates Sparrow and the Black Pearl crew on Pelegosto hiding from the Kraken, a voracious leviathan controlled by Davy Jones, the mythical captain of the Flying Dutchman and ruler of the seas. Jones is hunting Sparrow to collect a blood debt, while Sparrow has been searching for the Dead Man's Chest containing Jones' beating heart. Whoever possesses the heart, controls Davy Jones and the oceans. Unfortunately, Sparrow's magic compass seems to fail him, though it may be pointing to something he unknowingly desires more than the Dead Man's Chest. When Elizabeth escapes jail and discovers Beckett is only pardoning Sparrow, she confronts Beckett at gunpoint, forcing him to validate a Letters of Marque to free Will. Disguised as a cabin boy, Elizabeth tricks a merchant crew into making port in Tortuga. She jumps ship and encounters Sparrow and Gibbs in a pub recruiting sailors in an attempt to pay off Sparrow's debt to Davy Jones, who demands one hundred souls in exchange for his. Another man applies -- James Norrington, now a disgraced, drunken wretch. Blaming Sparrow for his ruination, Norrington attempts to shoot him, igniting a brawl, but Elizabeth knocks him out to save him. At the pier, Sparrow claims Will was press ganged into Davy Jones' crew, insisting he was blameless; Norrington is skeptical, but Elizabeth places her faith in Sparrow when he claims she can save Will by finding the Dead Man's Chest. Using his magical compass, she gets a bearing. On Isla Cruces, Jack, Elizabeth, and Norrington find the Dead Man's Chest. When Will arrives with Davy Jones' stolen key, Elizabeth learns that Sparrow tricked Will onto the Dutchman. A conflict erupts: Will wants to kill Jones by stabbing the heart, freeing his father from Jones' servitude; Sparrow fears the Kraken will continue hunting him if Jones is dead; Norrington plots to barter back his naval career with the heart. As a triple threat duel erupts, Jones' crew arrive. Sparrow obtains the key and opens the chest, but it is Norrington who ultimately escapes with the heart and the Letters of Marque. The Black Pearl outruns the pursuing Flying Dutchman. Undeterred, Jones summons the Kraken, but the crew temporarily fight it off. To save himself, Sparrow escapes in the remaining longboat, prompting Elizabeth to brand him a coward. But as Elizabeth once predicted, Sparrow, unable to desert his crew, heroically returns to rescue them, reaffirming her faith in him. During the Kraken's brief retreat, Jack orders all hands to abandon ship. Realizing that Sparrow is the Kraken's sole target, Elizabeth distracts him with a passionate kiss while handcuffing him to the mast. Insisting she has no regrets, her overwhelming guilt belies her true feelings. She tells the others that Sparrow stayed behind to aid their escape, unaware Will witnessed their encounter and mistakenly believes she loves Sparrow. The Kraken returns for a final assault, dragging the Pearl and Jack Sparrow to the Locker as the crew watches from the longboat. It is during this final battle that Sparrow's and Elizabeth's contrasting, yet also similar, underlying characters emerge: Jack shows heroism and loyalty by returning to the ship to save his crew; Elizabeth becomes more pirate-like to save herself and the others. Even Sparrow acknowledges this by calling her \\"pirate\\" in an almost admiring tone, as if praising her cleverness and heralding her passage into his realm. Norrington arrives in Port Royal and presents the heart and the Letters of Marque to Cutler Beckett in a bid to reclaim his commission. Meanwhile, Will, Elizabeth, and the grieving crew make their way upriver to Tia Dalma, the voodoo priestess who helped Sparrow find the Dead Man's Chest. As the crew drink a somber toast to their fallen captain, Elizabeth is wracked with guilt over secretly sacrificing Sparrow to the Kraken. This reinforces Will's belief that Elizabeth loves Sparrow. He despondently comforts her, prompting Tia Dalma to ask if they are willing to rescue Sparrow and the Pearl from Davy Jones' Locker. When all say, \\"aye,\\" Dalma says they will need a captain who knows those waters. Incredibly, a very alive Captain Barbossa descends the stairs. =At World's End= Jack Sparrow, Captain Barbossa, and seven other pirate lords have been summoned to a Brethren Court at Shipwreck Island to address Lord Beckett's assault on piracy. Jack, eternally imprisoned aboard the Black Pearl in Davy Jones' Locker, lacks a successor and possesses one of the nine \\"pieces of eight\\" that each pirate lord carries and must bring to the meeting; Jack must attend. Elizabeth joins Will Turner, Captain Barbossa, Tia Dalma, and Sparrow's crew on a rescue mission, but they must first obtain a navigational chart leading to World's End, the gateway to the Locker. Each character also has a self- serving motive for retrieving Jack, and, to succeed, must maintain an uneasy alliance despite distrusting one another. For Elizabeth, it is an opportunity to alleviate her guilt for sacrificing Jack to the Kraken to spare herself and the crew. In Singapore, Sao Feng, the Pirate Lord of the South China Sea, provides the chart and a ship, but Will negotiates a secret accord with Feng: Jack Sparrow in exchange for the Black Pearl. Unknown to Will, Elizabeth's lingering anguish over causing Jack's demise torments her, and during the voyage to World's End and Davy Jones Locker, she distances herself from Will. Though she claims everything will eventually be alright between them, her assurance seems uncertain and forced, leaving Will troubled and doubting her love for him. It is only when Will learns that Elizabeth sacrificed Jack to the Kraken that he comprehends her despair, though not why she concealed her actions. When Will confronts her, she says it was her burden to bear, though her secrecy has deeply wounded Will. If she makes choices alone, he asks, and they are unable to trust one another, then how can their relationship survive? Though Elizabeth apparently still cares for Will, her pain and guilt are unabated, and she despondently responds that he cannot trust her, and abruptly leaves. Their future together may be jeopardized if these issues remain unresolved. Meanwhile, as Jack and Barbossa squabble over who is the Black Pearl's captain, the crew navigate their way back to the living world. Before escaping the Locker, Elizabeth sees her father's soul being ferried to the \\"next world,\\" murdered by Cutler Beckett; she vows to avenge his death. After returning to the living world, Will's clandestine bargain with Sao Feng is exposed. But Feng has already betrayed Will for another deal with Beckett. While Elizabeth may understand that Will's motive is to rescue his father, she does not believe it justifies double-crossing the Pearl's crew. When she insists he explain why he withheld this, Will retorts that it was his, \\"burden to bear.\\" When Feng demands Elizabeth in exchange for the Pearl, she agrees in order to protect the crew. Elizabeth ignores Will's protests, telling him, \\"You got us into this mess. If this is what frees us, then done!\\" As their rift widens, Will, secretly torn between saving his father and being with Elizabeth, fears she is slipping away. He laments later to Sparrow, \\"I'm losing her Jack.\\" When Jones attacks the Empress, Feng, mortally wounded, hands over his \\"piece of eight\\" to Elizabeth and names her as captain and Pirate Lord of the South China Sea, mistakenly believing she is the sea goddess, Calypso. Elizabeth and her new crew are taken prisoner aboard the Flying Dutchman where she is reunited with Admiral Norrington, who is overjoyed she is alive. Elizabeth is hostile, however, accusing him of complicity in her father's murder, though Norrington denies knowing anything about the governor's death, and believed he returned to England. Elizabeth, hardly appeased, rebukes him for serving Lord Beckett, the man who ordered her father's murder. In the brig, Elizabeth encounters \\"Bootstrap\\" Bill Turner, who is gradually being absorbed into the ship's hull, losing his senses. He says Will cannot save both Elizabeth and himself--he will only choose her. Elizabeth finally understands Will's terrible dilemma and his motives: he must sacrifice one to save the other. That night, Norrington, shamed by his past deeds, frees Elizabeth and the crew. Elizabeth forgives Norrington, who again swears he was uninvolved in her father's death. She implores him to go with them, but he refuses to leave the ship. As she flees, he gives her one last kiss, saying, \\"Our fates have been entwined, Elizabeth, but never joined\\" hence acknowledging that they were never meant to be together. As Elizabeth and her crew escape to the towed Empress, \\"Bootstrap\\" Bill Turner, his mind addled by Jones' cruel punishment, sounds an alarm and fatally stabs Norrington as he attempts to hold Bootstrap off. Elizabeth witnesses his murder and cries \\"James!\\" The Black Pearl and the Empress race to Shipwreck Island for the Brethren Court. The pirate lords dispute how to oppose Beckett and the East India Trading Company; Elizabeth favors fighting while the Court prefers sequestering themselves inside the impenetrable Shipwreck Cove. This causes Sparrow to predict that confining themselves would likely result in them mass murdering each other. Jack unexpectedly breaks a stalemate to elect a pirate king by casting his ballot for Elizabeth; going to battle serves his own secret plan. \\"King\\" Elizabeth declares war. During a parley session with Beckett and Jones, Elizabeth tells the captive Will that having been aboard the Dutchman, she now understands his burden, but fears that course (saving his father) is lost, though Will disagrees. Jack is exchanged for Will. Whether Elizabeth's decision to declare war is brilliant or rash, her actions reflect her daring and bravery. As Beckett's fleet looms upon the horizon, Elizabeth, refusing to surrender or retreat, delivers a rousing speech. During the climatic sea battle, Will proposes to Elizabeth, claiming it may be their only chance to wed; Realizing how much she loves Will, Elizabeth orders Barbossa to marry them amidst the fighting. As the Pearl and the Dutchman clash, Elizabeth and Will board Jones' ship. When Jones mortally wounds Will, Jack relinquishes his bid for immortality to instead save Will, killing Jones. \\"Bootstrap\\" Bill Turner, having regained his senses, carves out his dead son's heart and places it in the Dead Man's Chest. Jack forces the grief-stricken Elizabeth to escape the ship with him as the Dutchman is sucked into the massive whirlpool. The ship quickly resurfaces with the resurrected Captain Will Turner at the helm and the crew restored to human form. With the Flying Dutchman now their ally, the pirates destroy Cutler Beckett's flagship Endeavour, killing him, and causing the navy to retreat, thus ending the war. With Beckett finally vanquished and her father's death avenged, Elizabeth decides to not continue a life of piracy and to return to Port Royal. Elizabeth bids Jack, Barbossa, and the pirates farewell before reuniting with Will for their \\"one day\\" on the nearby island where their marriage is consummated. Before returning to the Flying Dutchman at sunset for his ten years in the Netherworld, Will gives Elizabeth the Dead Man's Chest containing his beating heart for safekeeping. In a post-credits scene set ten years later, Elizabeth and Will's son, Henry Turner, stand atop a cliff searching the horizon. As the sun sets, the Flying Dutchman appears with the Green Flash, Captain Will Turner aboard. Film dialogue and the leaflet inside the special edition 2-Disc DVD state that any captain of the Flying Dutchman is eternally bound to the ship, and may only step on land once every ten years. =Dead Men Tell No Tales= Elizabeth Swann reunites with Will and Henry, after the Trident of Poseidon is destroyed, ending Will's curse that bound him to the Flying Dutchman. In a post-credits scene, Elizabeth is seen sleeping next to Will, as the dark silhouette of an apparently resurrected Davy Jones enters the room. Will then awakens and, assuming that he was simply dreaming, goes back to sleep, leaving water and barnacles at the foot of their bed. Character development According to actress Keira Knightley, Swann is \\"a 21st century girl trapped in an 18th century world. She . . . starts out as a damsel in distress and then kicks butt, so what's not to like?\\" While she appreciates her role, she was disappointed that her character did not carry a sword in The Black Pearl: \\"I didn't have a sword. Am I angry about that? Yes, very! ... I asked every single day, anyone I could ask, if I could have a sword but I didn't get one.\\" In the sequel Dead Man's Chest, she added that, \\"we went off into a grungier look for her. That was really exciting actually, to take the character and make her grow up... I think they really liked the more action-based side of Elizabeth from the first film and apparently that's what little girls really responded to, so they decided to take her off in that direction\\". She adds she was relieved to finally be able to brandish a sword, although according to Knightley, most of her sword fighting scenes were cut. Knightley also stated how glad she was that by At World's End, she was finally able to shed the elaborate dresses and only wear pirate's clothing: \\"Actually I am really glad, it's so hot in there it is unbelievable, and everybody else has got their proper pirate stuff on and I am a little less dressed than everyone else and I am very glad, so that's good. The rest of the time I've got kind of the Pirate look instead of the corset and frilly dresses.\\" Behind- the-scenes footage included on the DVD and Blu-ray releases of Dead Man's Chest reveals that Knightley wore wigs when playing Elizabeth in that film, as her real hair had been cropped short at the time (she is shown rehearsing numerous scenes without her wig in several production featurettes). For the toyline for At World's End an Action figure was made for Elizabeth Swann. Other appearances Elizabeth Swann appears in the Pirates of the Caribbean world, Port Royal, of the Disney/Square Enix game Kingdom Hearts II, voiced by Eliza Schneider in the English version (like the other original actors, Keira Knightley was unavailable due to filming Dead Man's Chest and At World's End) and by Saori Yumiba in the Japanese version. She returns in Kingdom Hearts III with Schneider reprising the role. Elizabeth Swann also appears in the video game \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (video game)\\" as well as \\"Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game\\" as a playable character in both video games. Schneider also performs the voice of Elizabeth Swann again in the video game Pirates of the Caribbean: The Legend of Jack Sparrow and in the video game adaptation of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. The character also appeared in Pirates of the Caribbean Online.

The game board represents renaissance-era Spain where the nobility (the Grandes) fight for control of the nine regions. El Grande was awarded the Spiel des Jahres prize and the Deutscher Spiele Preis in 1996.  Gameplay  The game is played in nine rounds. Three of these (rounds 3, 6, and 9) are scoring rounds, when player scores are counted according to their positions within the various regions. When the game is played with two players, it can be rather fast- paced. If five players participate, the game becomes very complex and challenging, as it becomes almost impossible to \\"do the mathematics\\" on the regions, and players team up and compete to keep others from winning, or to score more points for themselves. = Decision making = There are no dice in the game, and players have many chances to influence the turn order. Thus the game is all about decisions. Often the path to scoring more points is clear, but sometimes it can be wiser to prevent opponents from scoring. = The role of Luck = The original game has a number of action cards that are turned up each turn, which is the only source of randomness in the game. However, the effect of this luck is very small, since these cards are potentially available to be used by any player in the game. Each player starts the game with a hand of identical cards (numbered 1-13) at the beginning of the game. These cards are used to bid for turn order. The person who plays the highest card chooses their action card first, etc., but each player may use each card only once in a given game. The main challenge of the game is keeping track of the many factors that determine the balance of power in the regions and the score track. Reception Christian T.

A Klemperer rosette is a gravitational system of heavier and lighter bodies orbiting in a regular repeating pattern around a common barycenter. It was first described by W. B. Klemperer in 1962, and is a special case of a central configuration. Klemperer described the system as follows: The simplest rosette would be a series of four alternating heavier and lighter bodies, 90 degrees from one another, in a rhombic configuration [Heavy, Light, Heavy, Light], where the two larger bodies have the same mass, and likewise the two smaller bodies have the same mass. The number of \\"mass types\\" can be increased, so long as the arrangement pattern is cyclic: e.g. [ 1,2,3 ... 1,2,3 ], [ 1,2,3,4,5 ... 1,2,3,4,5 ], [ 1,2,3,3,2,1 ... 1,2,3,3,2,1 ], etc. Klemperer also mentioned octagonal and rhombic rosettes. While all Klemperer rosettes are vulnerable to destabilization, the hexagonal rosette has extra stability because the \\"planets\\" sit in each other's L4 and L5 Lagrangian points.  Misuse and misspelling  A pentagonal rosette as described in Larry Niven's novel Ringworld. The term \\"Klemperer rosette\\" (often misspelled \\"Kemplerer rosette\\") is often used to mean a configuration of three or more equal masses, set at the points of an equilateral polygon and given an equal angular velocity about their center of mass. Klemperer does indeed mention this configuration at the start of his article, but only as an already known set of equilibrium systems before introducing the actual rosettes. In Larry Niven's novel Ringworld, the Puppeteers' \\"Fleet of Worlds\\" is arranged in such a configuration (5 planets spaced at the points of a pentagon), which Niven calls a \\"Kemplerer rosette\\"; this (possibly intentional) misspelling (and misuse) is one possible source of this confusion. It is notable that these fictional planets were maintained in position by large engines in addition to gravitational force. Another is the similarity between Klemperer's name and that of Johannes Kepler, who described certain laws of planetary motion in the 17th century. Instability Simulations of this system (or a simple linear perturbation analysis) demonstrate that such systems are unstable: any motion away from the perfect geometric configuration causes an oscillation, eventually leading to the disruption of the system (Klemperer's original article also states this fact). This is the case whether the center of the rosette is in free space, or itself in orbit around a star. The short-form reason is that any perturbation destroys the symmetry, which increases the perturbation, which further damages the symmetry, and so on. The longer explanation is that any tangential perturbation brings a body closer to one neighbor and further from another; the gravitational imbalance becomes greater towards the closer neighbor and less for the farther neighbor, pulling the perturbed object further towards its closer neighbor, amplifying the perturbation rather than damping it. An inward radial perturbation causes the perturbed body to get closer to all other objects, increasing the force on the object and increasing its orbital velocity‚Äîwhich leads indirectly to a tangential perturbation and the argument above.

He played for the San Francisco Giants (1996‚Äì2000), Texas Rangers (2001), Boston Red Sox (2001‚Äì2005), and San Diego Padres (2006) before returning to the Red Sox (2006‚Äì2007) to end his eleven-year career. He batted and threw right-handed. Mirabelli was a career .231 hitter with 58 home runs and 206 runs batted in in 566 games. While with the Red Sox, he was well known as the personal catcher for knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. He was part of the Red Sox' World Series championship teams in 2004 and 2007. High school and college After leading Valley High School in his hometown of Las Vegas to two state baseball titles, Mirabelli was originally selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 6th Round (159th overall) of the 1989 Major League Baseball amateur draft, but did not sign. Instead, Mirabelli chose to attend Wichita State University. In 1990, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Hyannis Mets. In 1992, Mirabelli was selected by the San Francisco Giants in the 5th round (131st overall) of the Major League Baseball amateur draft again. He signed a contract with the club on June 24, 1992. Minor leagues Mirabelli began his minor league career in 1992 with the San Jose Giants in the California League. Over the next four seasons, he also spent time with the Giants' AA club; the Shreveport Captains and their AAA team; the Phoenix Firebirds. In 1996, Mirabelli started the year in AA, putting together an impressive season hitting .295 with 21 home runs and 70 runs batted in, earning a promotion to AAA. He bounced back to the AA level before earning a promotion to the major leagues in August of that year. Mirabelli made his major league debut on August 23, 1996 against the Philadelphia Phillies. Major Leagues =San Francisco Giants: 1996‚Äì2000= In the late 1990s, the Giants teams often utilized a platoon at the catcher position, relying on different veterans to split time for most of the season. When Mirabelli reached the majors, he saw limited time and spent most of his season in AAA with Phoenix. In 1999, he finally made the promotion to the majors permanent when he split time with veterans Brent Mayne and Scott Servais. The following season, Mirabelli platooned with Bobby Estalella, but neither catcher hit above .230 or played well enough to earn the starting job. =Texas Rangers: 2001= During spring training of 2001, the Giants signed veteran catcher Benito Santiago, who took over the starting role. Mirabelli's contract was sold to the Texas Rangers, who made him the backup to All-Star catcher Iv√°n Rodr√≠guez. Mirabelli struggled, barely hitting above .100. =Boston Red Sox: 2001‚Äì2005= After Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek's season was ended by a broken left elbow on June 7, 2001, the Red Sox acquired Mirabelli on June 12 in a trade with the Texas Rangers and he split time with Scott Hatteberg for the rest of the season. Mirabelli hit .270 with 9 home runs for the Red Sox in 2001. After the season, Hatteberg signed as a free agent with the Oakland Athletics and, in 2002, Mirabelli found himself as the designated catcher for veterans Darren Oliver and Frank Castillo. However, neither one lasted in the rotation and Mirabelli soon found himself partnered with knuckleballer Tim Wakefield. On July 23, 2002 Wakefield returned to the starting rotation after serving as a reliever for most of the season; Mirabelli made the start at catcher. The partnership seemed to work as Wakefield went 8‚Äì2 down the stretch with Mirabelli catching for him each time. Over the next three seasons, Wakefield and Mirabelli became an effective battery. As Wakefield solidified himself in the starting rotation, Mirabelli made almost every start for him as well as spot starts in relief of Varitek. Offensively, Mirabelli provided an occasional spark; he would become the only player in Major League Baseball history to hit six or more home runs in six consecutive seasons of fewer than 200 at-bats (from 2001 to 2006). Mirabelli was the starting catcher in Game 1 of the 2004 World Series as Wakefield was named the starting pitcher. He batted 1-for-3 with a run scored as the Red Sox went on to win 11-9 and eventually swept the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2005, Mirabelli hit .228 and struck out in more than a third of his at bats. He also missed nearly a month due to a left wrist injury. Following the season, the Red Sox traded Mirabelli to the San Diego Padres for second baseman Mark Loretta. =San Diego Padres: 2006= For the first time in his major league career, Mirabelli was going to be given a chance to be a starting catcher. However, in early February, General Manager Kevin Towers decided to sign veteran catcher Mike Piazza and installed him as the starter instead. Mirabelli made just a handful of starts, hitting .182 with no runs batted in through April. Upset over Piazza's arrival and his subsequent lack of playing time, Mirabelli asked Towers to work out a deal that would send him back to Boston.Kevin Towers on the Mirabelli trade . Accessed September 19, 2006. =Return to Boston: 2006‚Äì2007= Mirabelli on-deck during 2007 spring training. Mirabelli was reacquired by the Red Sox on May 1, 2006, in exchange for catcher Josh Bard, setup man Cla Meredith, and $100,000 cash. This reacquisition occurred because Bard had trouble catching Tim Wakefield's knuckleball, committing 10 passed balls in 7 games. The day the trade occurred, the Red Sox were to play their first game of the year against their rivals, the New York Yankees, at Fenway Park, and Wakefield was scheduled to start. It took a private jet and a Massachusetts State Police escort to get Mirabelli to the field in time. His plane from San Diego touched down at Logan Airport at 6:48 pm, he arrived at Fenway Park at 7:00 pm, and took his place behind the plate just in time for Wakefield's opening pitch at 7:13 pm. In an effort to conserve every second possible, the Red Sox sent a uniform along with the police escort for Mirabelli to change into while en route to Fenway Park from the airport. A special glove (which is actually a woman's softball catcher's mitt) which Mirabelli had used in previous years to catch Wakefield had been left in Boston by Josh Bard for Mirabelli. Soon after, the Yankees admitted they had tried to acquire Mirabelli from the Padres in an attempt to keep him from the Red Sox . On April 25, 2007, while Boston was visiting the Baltimore Orioles in the teams' first match up of the season, a controversy arose when Orioles' play-by-play announcer Gary Thorne alleged during the fifth inning of his telecast that Mirabelli had told him years ago that Curt Schilling's bloody sock from the Red Sox's 2004 championship run was only a publicity stunt. \\"... That famous red stocking that he wore when they finally won, the blood on his stocking, nah. It was painted. Doug Mirabelli confessed up to it after. It was all for PR,\\" said Thorne.Schilling's sock called into question. Accessed April 26, 2007. Thorne's comments were first reported on The Joy of Sox, a Red Sox blog.O's Announcer Matter-Of-Factly Says Mirabelli Confessed Schilling Put Red Paint On His Sock In 2004 ALCS/WS -- No Blood -- All Done For PR. Accessed April 26, 2007. Mirabelli initially vehemently denied talking about the incident to Thorne, and the comments by both individuals rekindled a controversy on a national level which had been dormant for years. Although Red Sox management refused to comment on the situation, Mirabelli faced the media the following day to try to quell a situation that had clearly gotten out of hand. While also making a point to affirm that the substance on Schilling's sock was undoubtedly his own blood, Mirabelli did acknowledge that there was likely a misunderstanding in a past dialogue with Thorne after the commentator had also admitted as much.Thorne blames 'bloody sock' charge on misunderstanding. Accessed April 26, 2007. Schilling's bloody sock now resides in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Mirabelli hit under .200 for the rest of the season and battled an ankle injury late in the year; Wakefield pitched just over .500 before suffering an injury in July and missing almost two months. Mirabelli re-signed with the Red Sox for the 2007 season, but his offense did not improve as he hit .202 and once again battled various leg injuries late in the year. In January 2008, Mirabelli agreed in principle to a one-year contract to return to the Red Sox for the 2008 season. The deal was reported to have a base salary of $550,000 with incentives. However, on March 13, 2008, Mirabelli was released by the Red Sox when the team elected to use Kevin Cash as its backup catcher.Sox release Mirabelli Coaching career On January 5, 2009, Mirabelli was named the new head baseball coach at St. Francis High School in Traverse City, Michigan.Gladiators Hire Mirabelli On September 9, 2015, Mirabelli was named Florida Gators softball volunteer assistant coach. Personal life Mirabelli and his wife Kristin have two daughters, Molly and Emma, and one son, Joseph. He graduated from Valley High School in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1989. As of March 2009, Mirabelli works as a realtor for Coldwell Banker Schmidt Realtors in Traverse City.

While it was not the first collection of Scottish folk songs and music, the six volumes with 100 songs in each collected many pieces, introduced new songs, and brought many of them into the classical music repertoire. The project started with James Johnson, a struggling music engraver / music seller, with a love of old Scots songs and a determination to preserve them. In the winter of 1786 he met Robert Burns who was visiting Edinburgh for the first time, and found that Burns shared this interest and would become an enthusiastic contributor. The first volume was published in 1787 and included three songs by Burns. He contributed 40 songs to volume 2, and would end up responsible for about a third of the 600 songs in the whole collection as well as making a considerable editorial contribution. The final volume was published in 1803 and contained the first printing of Handsome Nell, Burn's very first song. As well as collecting old songs, Burns wrote new words to old tunes, and many of the songs now attributed to Burns have older roots. Songs in the collection include Auld Lang Syne, Lord Ronald, my Son (better known as Lord Randal) and My love is like a Red, Red Rose. Burns' songs include The Battle of Sherramuir, Scots Wha Hae, Green Grow the Rashes, Flow Gently Sweet Afton, Ye Banks and Braes of Bonnie Doon, Ae Fond Kiss, The Winter it is Past, Comin' Thro the Rye, There Grows a Bonnie Brier Bush, and John Anderson, My Jo. The collection became popular internationally, and songs and tunes were arranged by composers such as Joseph Haydn and Ludwig van Beethoven. Burns collaborated with George Thomson in A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs, published from 1793 to 1818, which adapted Scottish folk-songs with \\"classical\\" arrangements. While this brought songs to new audiences, many of the songs and tunes continued in the folk tradition, both in Scotland and America. The American collector John Gribbel was at one time in possession of Robert Burns's Interleaved Scots Musical Museum, the first four volumes of Johnson's \\"Scots Musical Museum\\" interleaved with some 140 pages of Robert Burns's explanatory notes on the 184 songs that he contributed. These volumes had long been in the possession of the Riddell family of Friars Carse in Nithsdale. These notes have provided many insights into the authorship and editing of the songs he contributed.Burns Chronicle XXIII January 1914 References External links * *Digitised copy of Scots Musical Museum in six volumes by James Johnson, printed between 1787 and 1803, from National Library of Scotland.

In the period between 1903 and 1907 he published a book and a scientific magazine in which he affirmed the existence of a Macedonian national identity separate from other Balkan nations, and attempted to codify a Standard Macedonian language based on the central Western Macedonian dialects.Macedonia and Greece: The Struggle to Define a New Balkan Nation, John Shea, p. 204: \\"After the failure of the Ilinden rebellion, Misirkov returned to St. Petersburg, and in 1905 he launched the journal Vardar in Macedonian.\\"On the Macedonian Matters, Misirkov, 1903 : \\"i–∞—Å –∏ —ñ–µ –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ñ –Ω–∞ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª–Ω–æ—Ç–æ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∫–æ –Ω–∞—Ä–µ—á—ñ–µ, –∫–æ—ñ–µ –∑–∞ –º–µ–Ω–µ –æ—Ç —Å–µ–≥–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ç–∞–º–æ –∏–º–∞—Ç –¥–∞ –±–∏–¥–∏—Ç –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–µ–Ω –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∫–∏ i–∞–∑–∏–∫.\\" A survey conducted in the Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia) found Misirkov to be \\"the most significant Macedonian of the 20th century\\".http://star.dnevnik.com.mk/default.aspx?pBroj=1884&stID;=4305 –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞ –º–æ—Ä–∞ –¥–∞ –≥–æ –∏–º–∞ –ö—Ä—Å—Ç–µ –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤ –≤–æ —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ç–µ –ø–∞–∑—É–≤–∏ For his efforts to codify a standard Macedonian language, he is often considered \\"the founder of the modern Macedonian literary language\\". However, in 1907 he began publishing predominantly articles, written from a Bulgarian nationalist perspective. During the First World War he became a member of the local parliament in Bessarabia as a representative of the Bulgarian minority there. Misirkov reverted to Macedonian nationalism for a short in 1919. During the 1920s his views changed again, and he encouraged the Macedonian Slavs to adopt a Bulgarian national identity. Misirkov died in 1926 and was buried in the graveyards in Sofia with the financial support from the Ministry of Education, as a honoured Bulgarian educator. Because Misirkov expressed conflicting views about the national identity of the Macedonians Slavs at different points in his life, his national affiliation and legacy remains a matter of dispute between Bulgaria and North Macedonia. While Misirkov's work and personality remain highly controversial and disputed, there have been attempts among international scholars to reconcile the conflicting and self-contradictory statements made by Misirkov. According to historian Ivo Banac, Misirkov viewed both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians, and espoused pan- Bulgarian patriotism in a larger Balkan context. However, in the context of the larger Bulgarian unit/nation, Misirkov sought both cultural and national differentiation from the Bulgarians and called both himself and the Slavs of Macedonia Macedonians.The national question in Yugoslavia: origins, history, politics, Ivo Banac, Cornell University Press, 1988, , p. 327.  Biography  Misirkov's birth house in Postol The last picture of Misirkov = Early years = Krste Petkov Misirkov was born on 18 November 1874 in the village of Postol in the Salonica Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire (present-day Greece). He started his elementary education in the local Greek school, where he was studying until the sixth grade elementary school, but the bad financial situation of his family could not support his further education at that point and he left the school. At that period Serbian government began to promote its variant of \\"Macedonism\\" and to recruit young people in order to \\"Serbianize\\" them.Who Are the Macedonians? Hugh Poulton, C. Hurst & Co. Publishers, 2000, , p. 63.Contested Ethnic Identity: The Case of Macedonian Immigrants in Toronto, 1900‚Äì1996, Chris Kostov, Peter Lang, 2010, , p. 66. After some period, Misirkov applied and was granted a scholarship by the Serbian \\"association St. Sava \\".Literature of the Macedonian language, Georgi Stalev, Skopje = Misirkov in Serbia = Misirkov spent some time in Serbia, where he was studying in Serbian, and soon after he realized that the propaganda was the main goal of the Serbian association. The politics practiced by the association forced Misirkov and the other Macedonian students to participate in a student's revolt against the Saint Sava society. As a result of that, Misirkov and other companions moved from Belgrade to Sofia. Since he faced up with similar situation in Bulgaria, i.e., another propaganda, Misirkov again went to Serbia to continue his education, but without any success because he was rejected by the \\"St. Sava\\" association. Since he was willing to get higher education, he was forced, by a chain of events, to enroll a theological school for teachers. Similar to the association \\"St. Sava\\", this school as well had its own propagandistic goals and that resulted in another revolt of the students.\\"–ö—Ä—ä—Å—Ç–µ –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤ –∏ –∑–∞ –±—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∏ –≤ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è\\", –ü—Ä–æ—Ñ. –¥-—Ä –í–µ—Å–µ–ª–∏–Ω –¢—Ä–∞–π–∫–æ–≤, –ó–Ω–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ï–û–û–î, 2000, , p. 12. As a result of it, the school stopped working and the students were sent throughout Serbia. Misirkov was sent to ≈†abac, where he finished the last, fourth, class of secondary education, but this time in the local gymnasium. In both, Serbia and Bulgaria, Misirkov and his friend were treated as Serbs or Bulgarians in order to be accepted in the educational system. After the gymnasium, even though he graduated, Misirkov enrolled in another secondary school for teachers in Belgrade, where he graduated in 1895. During this time, particularly in 1893, Misirkov founded an association of students called \\"Vardar\\". Its charter included, among other things, the aim of studying and spreading a knowledge of their country as regards its geographical, ethnographic and historical aspects and the cardinal principle of its program was that Macedonia should belong to the Macedonians. This idea was inspired by the \\"Lozari\\". Afterwards he was appointed as a Serbian teacher in Pristina. Misirkov refused and left for Odessa to continue his studies. = Misirkov in the Russian Empire = His educational qualifications obtained in Belgrade were not recognized in Russia. Misirkov had to study from the very beginning in the Seminary at Poltava. In 1897 he was able to enter the Petersburg University. Here he entered at first the Bulgarian Students Association.

On 15 November 1900, when Misirkov third year student in the Faculty of History and Philosophy, along with other students in Russia created –∞ Petersburg circle. The main objective of the circle is political autonomy of the population of Macedonia and Thrace, declared by IMARO implemented and guaranteed by the Great Powers. In a letter sent to the President of the Supreme Macedonian-Adrianople Committee on 28 November, circle founders state that there's no Bulgarian who is not interested in the situation and fate of that part of our homeland, which continue to groan under the yoke of the tyrant. At that time Misirkov still considers the Slavic population of Macedonia and Thrace as Bulgarian.–ù–ë–ö–ú-–ë–ò–ê, —Ñ. 224, –í—ä—Ä—Ö–æ–≤–µ–Ω –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–æ-–æ–¥—Ä–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏ –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, –∞.–µ. 23, –ª. 397 –ó–∞ (SS.

Of great importance to Misirkov was the founding of the Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society in Petersburg.The Balkan states and the Macedonian question, prof. Antony Giza Its creation was influenced by the Macedonian Club founded in Belgrade. After the Club was closed, its chief founders left for the Russian capital, where they organized the new Macedonian Society. This foundation in 1902 became the most important Macedonian institution abroad. In the same year this Society sent a special Memorandum to the Great Powers, in which the Macedonian Question was examined from the national point of view. It was proposed also Macedonian literary language to be codified. The question was also examined of establishing a Macedonian Church under the Ohrid Archbishopric. The aim of this Memorandum was that the Macedonians should be recognized as a separate nation and that Macedonia should be granted full autonomy within the Ottoman Empire. During this time he also examined the medieval period in Macedonia and his works contributed to the understanding of the 14th-century local ruler Krali Marko. Misirkov's application sent to the Yugoslav authorities where he asks for a job in Macedonia This plaque in Odessa, Ukraine indicates the house where the Macedonian national activist lived and worked in the period 1909‚Äì1913. Questionnaire filled by Misirkov as a member of Sfatul »öƒÉrii in Bessarabia. Later Misirkov abandoned the University and left for Ottoman Macedonia. = Returning to the Ottoman Macedonia = Facing financial obstacles to continue his postgraduate education, he accepted the proposal of the Bulgarian Exarchate to be appointed teacher in a high school in Bitola. There he became friendly with the Russian consul in Bitola. He began to plan opening of local schools and publishing textbooks in Macedonian language. But the Ilinden Uprising in 1903 and the assassination of the Russian Consul changed his plans and he returned to Russia. There Misirkov published different articles about the Ilinden Uprising and the reasons why the Consul was assassinated. Soon afterwards he wrote the brochure \\"The Macedonian matters\\" and published it in Sofia. This book, was written in the Central Macedonian dialect,The Former Yugoslavia's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook, Matja≈æ Klemenƒçiƒç,Mitja ≈Ωagar, p. 74: This work on the Macedonian language was written in Central Macedonian dialect, which he also recommended as a basis for a future literary language and Misirkov attacked in his writings the Bulgarian Exarchate, the Ilinden Uprising and the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) as Bulgarian creations. As result, he was persecuted by IMARO, and it is believed its members destroyed a lot of copies of his book. However, he says that Dame Gruev, Gotse Delchev, Boris Sarafov and other IMRO members are Macedonian national separatists.\\"They also began to persecute the Macedonian separatists. One of those who made his escape at this time was Dame Gruev, who was one of the Macedonian students who had moved from Belgrade to Sofia, and was also one of the separatists. Since they could not find favorable ground for their national separatist activity in Bulgaria, the Macedonians who had moved from Belgrade to Sofia turned to organizing revolutionary bodies in Bulgaria and Macedonia. The celebrated Macedonian revolutionary separatists, such as Gotse Delchev, were simply the pupils of the first generation of Macedonians who had studied in Serbia and Bulgaria. So, too, Sarafov and the revolutionaries who followed were simply the successors and heirs of these first revolutionaries but not the founders of the revolutionary organization.\\" (National separatism ‚Äì the soil on which it has grown and will continue to grow in the future) = Again in the Russian Empire = In 1905 he left for Berdiansk in Southern Russia.

On 24 April 1909 K. Missirkov printed in Odessa in a separate booklet his work \\"South Slavic epic legends of the marriage of King Volkashin in connection with the question of the reasons for the popularity of Krali Marko among the South Slavs\\". On 1 October 1909 he printed the article, \\"The foundations of a Serbian-Bulgarian rapprochement\\" in the Magazine \\"Bulgarian collection\\" edited by Bulgarian diplomats in St. Petersburg. By the time, a Slavic Festival was held in Sofia in 1910 and Missirkov was attend as its guest of honor. In 1910‚Äì1911, he translated from Bulgarian to Russian the book of the Bulgarian geographer Prof. Atanas Ishirkov \\"Bulgaria\\". When the First Balkan war was declared, Misirkov went to Macedonia as a Russian war correspondent. There he could follow the military operations of the Bulgarian Army. Misirkov published a series of articles in the Russian press and some articles demanding that the Ottomans should be driven out of Macedonia. In 1913 after the outbreak of the Second Balkan war Misirkov went back to Russia, where he worked as a teacher also in the Bulgarian schools in Odessa. Here he wrote his diary, which was found in 2006. Later he was appointed teacher of the Bulgarian school at Kishinev. While working as a teacher in Kishinev, Misirkov sent –∞ letter to the Bulgarian academic Aleksandar Teodorov-Balan with a request to be assigned as a professor at Sofia University. That request clearly indicates his self-identification at that time ‚Äì As a Bulgarian, I would willingly return to Bulgaria, if there is a need of a scientific research of the fate of the Bulgarian lands, especially Macedonia.. A shorter letter with similar content was sent to another professor at Sofia University ‚Äì Vasil Zlatarski with the request to be assigned as a chosen at the newly established department for history of Macedonia and the other western Bulgarian lands.K.

Misirkov was publishing in this magazine for some period under the pseudonym \\"K. Pelski\\". After the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 Bessarabia became a democratic republic, and he was elected a member of the local parliament Sfatul »öƒÉrii as a representative of the Bulgarian minority. At the same time, Misirkov worked as a secretary in the Bulgarian educational commission in Bessarabia. In March 1918 was declared the union of Bessarabia with Romania. On 21 May 1918 Misirkov open–µd a Bulgarian language course in Bolhrad. Then he took a secret trip to Bulgaria in order to procure textbooks for the students, but after his return in November he was arrested by the Kingdom of Romania authorities, still at war with Bulgaria; afterwards, he was extradited to Bulgaria. = Last years in Bulgaria = –ïxpelled by the Romanian authorities, at the end of 1918 Misirkov returned to Sofia, where he spent one year as a head of the Historical department of the National Museum of Ethnography. Then, he worked as a teacher and director of the high schools in Karlovo and Koprivshtitsa. During this period (but before 1923) the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) apparently marked Misirkov as harmful to its cause and supposedly considering his assassination, but reconsidered after he met with a representative of the organization.–ü—Ä–æ–º–µ–º–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–∞ –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞ –¢—Ä–∞–π–∫–æ–≤ –∑–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä —Å –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ. –ü–µ—Ç–∫–æ –°—Ç–æ—è–Ω–æ–≤ –∑–∞ –ö—Ä—ä—Å—Ç—é –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤, –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 8 –º–∞—Ä—Ç 1963 –≥.

Works In his life, Misirkov wrote one book, one diary, published one issue of a magazine and wrote more than thirty articles. His book \\"On Macedonian Matters\\" was published in Sofia in 1903. The magazine was called \\"Vardar\\" and was published in 1905 in Odessa, Russian Empire. The articles that Misirkov wrote have been published in different newspapers and they were focused on different topics. The book, magazine and a number of his article were written in the Central Macedonian dialects, which are basis of the Modern Macedonian. Front cover of Za Makedonckite Raboti The first page of the magazine Vardar The last page of Misirkov's diary of 1913 =\\"On the Macedonian Matters\\"= One of the most important work of Misirkov is the Macedonian book On the Macedonian Matters (Orig: –ó–∞ –º–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω—Ü–∫–∏—Ç–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∏)PDF: On the Macedonian Matters published in 1903 in Sofia, in which he laid down the principles of the modern Macedonian language. This book was written in a Macedonian dialects from the area between Prilep and Bitola. It argued in favor of national separation, the establishment of autonomous national institutions within the Ottoman empire, and the standardization of a distinct Macedonian language. Misirkov attacked both the Bulgarian Exarchate and the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) as agents of the Bulgarian interests in Macedonia. According to this book, the Macedonian literary language should be based on dialects from the central part of Macedonia, which were used in the book itself. On the other hand, Misirkov appealed to the Ottoman authorities for eventual recognition of a separate Macedonian nation. He admitted there was not such one, and most of the Macedonian Slavs called themselves Bulgarians, but it should be created, when the necessary historical circumstances would arise.The term 'project' tackles likewise the specific temporal orientation of the initial stage of formation of Macedonian ethnic nationalism: the Macedonian self-determination is seen by Misirkov as a future ideal and his national manifesto on the Macedonian Matters (Sofia, 1903) recognizes the lack of actual correlation between the concept of Macedonian Slavic ethnicity and the real self-identifications of the majority of Macedonian Slavs. In a rather demiurgical way, Misirkov is the first who exposes the basic 'ethnographic' characteristics of what he regards as 'inexistent' but 'possible' and 'necessary' Macedonian Slavic ethnicity... Tchavdar Marinov, \\"Between Political Autonomism and Ethnic Nationalism: Competing Constructions of Modern Macedonian National Ideology (1878‚Äì1913)\\", p. 3.Misirkov lamented that \\"no local Macedonian patriotism\\" existed and would have to be created. He anticipated that Macedonians would respond to his proposal with a series of baffled questions: \\"What sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we, and our fathers and grandfathers and great- grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians?...Macedonian as a nationality has never existed, and it does not exist now\\"... Misirkov answered by observing that national loyalties change with time: \\"What has not existed in the past may still be brought into existence later, provided that the appropriate historical circumstances arise... Misirkov in short wanted, the Ottoman state to promote Macedonian nation-building, calling for \\"official recognition\\". Region, Regional Identity and Regionalism in Southeastern Europe, Klaus Roth, Ulf Brunnbauer, LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2008, , p. 138.The idea of a separate (Slavic) Macedonian nationhood most certainly had its antecedents before the 1930s ‚Äì nor is that surprising, considering the political history of the area. Krste Misirkov, the \\"first creator of a clear and rounded representation, of argued and systematic conception about the national essence of Macedonian people,\\" brought arguments in favor of Macedonian \\"national separatism\\" in his on Macedonian matters, but still considered the Macedonian question a part of a larger Bulgarian complex, if for no other reason than linguistic. Misirkov's pan-Bulgarian patriotism was based largely on the kinship of language, and his pan-Bulgarian positions, which he used, moreover frontally, against the Serbs and Greeks.The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics, Ivo Banac, Cornell University Press, 1988, , p. 327.Misirkov speaks, for instance, of the relations between \\"the Macedonian peoples\\" [makedonckite narodi], of the \\"convergence of interests of all Macedonian peoples.\\" The term \\"nation\\" appears rarely and is contrasted to the term \\"nationality\\": e.g., Misirkov suggests that, in Macedonia, there are many \\"nationalities\\" [nacionalnosti], while \\"a distinct Macedonian Slavic nation [naciia]\\" does not yet exist (p. 46). This usage actually implies that the \\"nation\\" is seen as a political phenomenon of a \\"higher\\" degree, transcending a multiplicity of actual ethnic and/or confessional particularities. We, the People: Politics of National Peculiarity in Southeastern Europe, Diana Mishkova, European University Press, 2009, , p. 133.Misirkov accepted that his project for Macedonian particularist nationalism broke with considerable Bulgarian sentiment. He admitted both that there was \\"no local Macedonian patriotism\\", and that ordinary Macedonians would see Macedonian particularism as a novelty: \\"What sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we and our fathers and grandfathers and great- grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians?‚Äù Responding to these arguments, Misirkov showed a surprising acceptance that national communities evolve in response to events: \\"what has not existed in the past may still be brought into existence later, provided that the appropriate historical circumstances arise\\". Misirkov thus tried to create the appropriate historical circumstances. Sundry Macedonias, Alexander Mark Maxwell, University of Wisconsin‚ÄîMadison, 1998, pp. 50‚Äì51.Many people will want to know what sort of national separatism we are concerned with; they will ask if we are not thinking of creating a new Macedonian nation. Such a thing would be artificial and short-lived. And, anyway? What sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we, and our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians?...One of the first questions which will be posed by the opponents of national unification and of the revival movement in Macedonia will be: what is the Macedonian Slav nation? Macedonian as a nationality has never existed, they will say, and it does not exist now.... The first objection ‚Äì that a Macedonian Slav nationality has never existed ‚Äì may be very simply answered as follows: what has not existed in the past may still be brought into existence later, provided that the appropriate historical circumstances arise...On Macedonian Matters. (1903) by Krste Misirkov. =The magazine \\"Vardar\\"= Besides On Macedonian Matters, Misirkov is author of the first scientific magazine on Macedonian language. The magazine Vardar was published in 1905 in Odessa, Russian Empire. The magazine was published only once, because of the financial problems that Misirkov had been facing with at that time. \\"Vardar\\" has been published on Macedonian language, and the orthography that has been used is almost same as the orthography of the standard Macedonian language.p.13, \\"Vardar\\", Bla≈æe Ristovski, Institute of Macedonian language \\"Krste Misirkov\\", Skopje, 1966. The magazine was meant to include several different scientific disciplines, mostly concerned with Macedonia. The first section of the magazine is made of the introduction, where in general Misirkov elaborates the aims of the magazine and this section was in Macedonian and Russian. The next section of the magazine is the literary section, where Misirkov translated into Macedonian the poem \\"Traveler\\" by the Croatian poet P. Preradovic. After the literary section, the magazine includes an analysis about the Balkan propagandas in Macedonia, followed by a political analysis of some of the global events in that period. The last section is statistics, which shows the Macedonian population in Macedonia. The goals of the magazine were to: # Establish a relationship between the Macedonian national separatists and their opponents, all Balkan people interested in the Macedonian question; # Fight for separate Slavic Macedonian nationality; # Show that the language is individual, it's not Serbian nor Bulgarian and is capable of literary development. Regarding the opponents of the magazine, Misirkov shares his concern that at the end, the larger, if not to say the largest, part of the Macedonian intelligentsia would be against \\"Vardar\\" and its program, because all Macedonian, opponents of the Macedonian national separatism, are convinced, that with money in Macedonia a man can create out of our Macedonians not only Bulgarian, Serb, Greek or Macedonian, but even Gypsy nationality. He also believes that the common people will (also) be against Vardar and his associates, the national separatists, because the idea of the separatists, is hard to be understood by the common people, which is faced up with different kinds of prechments and new ideas'.Magazine \\"Vardar\\", p. 1-2 = Articles = Misirkov's Macedonian Affairs commemorated as one of the key points of Macedonia's history, at the Makedonium memorial in Kru≈°evo During his life, Misirkov published many articles for different newspapers and magazines. The articles deal with Macedonia, Macedonian culture, ethnology, politics and nation on one hand and with the Bulgarian nation, politics and ethnography on the other. Misirkov published his articles in Macedonian, Russian and Bulgarian and he published them either in Russia or in Bulgaria. Most of the articles were signed by his birth name, but there are articles that are signed with his pseudonym K. Pelski. = Diary = In 2006, a handwritten diary by Misirkov written during his stay in Russia in 1913 was discovered. It was declared authentic by Bulgarian and Macedonian experts and was published in 2008.FOCUS Information Agency The content of the diary clearly shows that at the time, Misirkov was a Bulgarian nationalist.

Controversies about Misirkov's ethnicity and views During the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century the idea of a separate Macedonian ethnicity was as yet promoted only by some circles of intellectuals. Then, most of the Slavic people in Macedonia considered themselves Bulgarian,Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe, Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE) ‚Äì \\"Macedonians of Bulgaria\\".154 Studia Theologica V, 3/2007, 147 ‚Äì 176 Alexander Maxwell, Krste Misirkov's call for Macedonian Autocephaly: religious nationalism as instrumental political tactic.Krste Misirkov, On the Macedonian Matters (Za Makedonckite Raboti), Sofia, 1903: \\"And, anyway, what sort of new Macedonian nation can this be when we and our fathers and grandfathers and great-grandfathers have always been called Bulgarians?\\" and Macedonist idea failed to gain wide popular support. At different points in his life, Misirkov expressed conflicting statements about the ethnicity of the Slavs living in Macedonia, including his own ethnicity. Monument of Misirkov in Pella Square in Skopje, North Macedonia Monument of Misirkov in Bitola =View of Misirkov in Bulgaria= In Bulgaria, Misirkov is regarded as a controversial educator with scientific contribution to Bulgarian dialectology and ethnography.

This idea, we fear, would be incapable, as opposition pure and simple, of suppressing the Bulgarian idea. That is why the Serbian idea will need an ally that could stand in direct opposition to Bulgarianism and would contain in itself the elements which could attract the people and their feelings and thus sever them from Bulgarianism.

Afterwards Misirkov met several times with him and Novakoviƒá's diplomatic activity in St. Petersburg played significant role for the foundation of the Macedonian Scientific and Literary Society.Novakoviƒá initiated the establishment of closer Serbian-Russian relations as consul in St. Petersburg, where he supported the local macedonists as Misirkov and Chupovski, see: Angel G.

Later in 1913, in his diary from the Balkan wars, he explicitly identifies himself as Macedonian Bulgarian. Bulgarian historians believe that his writings were significantly altered by the post-WWII Yugoslavian Communist regime to support the notion of a \\"Macedonian nation\\", distinct from the Bulgarian one. Bulgarians also note that Misirkov worked as a Bulgarian teacher in Russia, was Bulgarian deputy in Bessarabia, chose Bulgarian citizenship, lived and died in Bulgaria and worked there until his death in 1926. Nevertheless, Bulgarian scholarship points out that despite Misirkov in many cases defending the cause of Bulgarian nationalism, he several times switched during the 1920s, from Bulgarian to Macedonian one, and vice a versa. According to Bulgarian observers, after the breakup of Yugoslavia in Republic of Macedonia also have arisen polemics about the identity of Misirkov.–°—Ç–æ –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏ –ò–ª–∏–Ω–¥–µ–Ω –∏–ª–∏ —Å—Ç–æ –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–∏ –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤? –ß–∞–≤–¥–∞—Ä –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–æ–≤ –°–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ë—ä–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è ‚Äì –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—è, –ë—Ä–æ–π 2, 2010 –≥. –ù–µ–∏–∑–≤–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏—è—Ç –¥–æ—Å–µ–≥–∞ –¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ –Ω–∞ –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤ —Ä–∞–∑–±—É–Ω–∏ –¥—É—Ö–æ–≤–µ—Ç–µ –∫—Ä–∞–π –í–∞—Ä–¥–∞—Ä–∞, –°–≤–µ—Ç–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤ –î–µ–ª—á–µ–≤. =View of Misirkov in North Macedonia= In North Macedonia, Misirkov is regarded as the most prominent Macedonian publicist, philologist and linguist who set the principles of the Macedonian literary language in the early 20th century. In some of his writings he identifies the Macedonians as separate nation and the Macedonian as a separate South Slavic language. Also, Misirkov is the author of the first scientific magazine in Macedonian and because of his contributions to the Macedonian national cause, he is regarded as the greatest Macedonian of the 20th century. In his honor, many books and scientific works have been published and the Institute for Macedonian language \\"Krste Misirkov\\" is named after him. There is not an important debate about Misirkov's ethnicity in Macedonia, since he is always regarded as Macedonian as it is obvious in most of his major writings. Since he was not allowed to live in work in Macedonia by the Yugoslav authorities,Misirkov's application for permanent residence in Macedonia. unwillingly he remained in Bulgaria where he got Bulgarian citizenship since he needed it for his job. Regarding Misirkov's signature under the phrase \\"Macedonian Bulgarian\\", the Macedonian historians and linguists argue that it means nothing but a Macedonian person with a Bulgarian citizenship, in a political sense, or just a Macedonian person living in Bulgaria.–ï–∫—Å–ø–µ—Ä—Ç–∏: –ù–µ–º–∞ –¥–∏–ª–µ–º–∏ –∑–∞ –∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ç–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤ on a1.com.mk However, the fact is that Misirkov gained Bulgarian citizenship after World War I (1915‚Äì1918)–ó–∞—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –ö—Ä. –ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤ –¥–æ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å–µ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–æ—Ç–æ —Å—ä–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ ‚Äì –°–æ—Ñ–∏—è, 25 –¥–µ–∫–µ–º–≤—Ä–∏ 1923 –≥. –¶–î–ò–ê, —Ñ. 173, –æ–ø. 3, –∞.–µ. 3817, –ª.–ª. 226‚Äì229. and has declared as Bulgarian Macedonian in 1913, which is against the claims of the Macedonian historians and linguists.Letter to the head of the National Geographic Museum (19.03 1919 –≥. #6784–ú–∏—Å–∏—Ä–∫–æ–≤, –ö. –ü. –î–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–∏–∫ 2.VII ‚Äì 30.

It is usually called a bridging loan in the United Kingdom, also known as a \\"caveat loan,\\" and also known in some applications as a swing loan. In South African usage, the term bridging finance is more common, but is used in a more restricted sense than is common elsewhere. A bridge loan is interim financing for an individual or business until permanent financing or the next stage of financing is obtained. Money from the new financing is generally used to \\"take out\\" (i.e. to pay back) the bridge loan, as well as other capitalization needs. Bridge loans are typically more expensive than conventional financing, to compensate for the additional risk. Bridge loans typically have a higher interest rate, points (points are essentially fees, 1 point equals 1% of loan amount), and other costs that are amortized over a shorter period, and various fees and other \\"sweeteners\\" (such as equity participation by the lender in some loans). The lender also may require cross- collateralization and a lower loan-to-value ratio. On the other hand, they are typically arranged quickly with relatively little documentation. Real estate Bridge loans are often used for commercial real estate purchases to quickly close on a property, retrieve real estate from foreclosure, or take advantage of a short-term opportunity in order to secure long-term financing.Guide to bridging loans Financial Times. 3 February 2014. Retrieved 27 November 2018.What Is a Bridging Loan? Finance Monthly Magazine. 21 June 2018. Retrieved 27 November 2018. Bridge loans on a property are typically paid back when the property is sold, refinanced with a traditional lender, the borrower's creditworthiness improves, the property is improved or completed, or there is a specific improvement or change that allows a permanent or subsequent round of mortgage financing to occur. The timing issue may arise from project phases with different cash needs and risk profiles as much as ability to secure funding. A bridge loan is similar to and overlaps with a hard money loan. Both are non-standard loans obtained due to short-term or unusual circumstances. The difference is that hard money refers to the lending source, usually an individual, investment pool, or private company that is not a bank in the business of making high-risk, high-interest loans, whereas a bridge loan is a short-term loan that \\"bridges the gap\\" between longer-term loans. =Characteristics= For typical terms of up to 12 months, 2‚Äì4 points may be charged. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratios generally do not exceed 65% for commercial properties, or 80% for residential properties, based on appraised value. A bridge loan may be closed, meaning it is available for a predetermined time frame, or open in that there is no fixed payoff date (although there may be a required payoff after a certain time).Bridging loans increase 45pc due to new landlord appetite The Telegraph. 21 October 2011. Retrieved 29 November 2018. A first charge bridging loan is generally available at a higher LTV than a second charge bridging loan due to the lower level of risk involved, many UK lenders will steer clear of second charge lending altogether. Lower LTVs may also attract lower rates, again representing the lower level of underwriting risk, although front-end fees, lenders legal fees, and valuation payments may remain fixed. =Examples= *A bridge loan is often obtained by developers to carry a project while permit approval is sought. Because there is no guarantee the project will happen, the loan might be at a high interest rate and from a specialized lending source that will accept the risk. Once the project is fully entitled, it becomes eligible for loans from more conventional sources that are at lower-interest, for a longer term, and in a greater amount. A construction loan would then be obtained to take out the bridge loan and fund completion of the project. *A consumer is purchasing a new residence and plans to make a down payment with the proceeds from the sale of a currently owned home. The currently owned home will not close until after the close of the new residence. A bridge loan allows the buyer to take equity out of the current home and use it as down payment on the new residence, with the expectation that the current home will close within a short time frame and the bridge loan will be repaid. *A bridging loan can be used by a business to ensure continued smooth operation during a time when for example one senior partner wishes to leave whilst another wishes to continue the business. The bridging loan could be made based on the value of the company premises allowing funds to be raised via other sources for example a management buy in. *A property may be offered at a discount if the purchaser can complete quickly with the discount offsetting the costs of the short term bridging loan used to complete. In auction property purchases where the purchaser has only 14‚Äì28 days to complete long term lending such as a buy to let mortgage may not be viable in that time frame whereas a bridging loan would be. Corporate finance Bridge loans are used in venture capital and other corporate finance for several purposes: *To inject small amounts of cash to carry a company so that it does not run out of cash between successive major private equity financingsPrivate equity turns to early loans to boost returns Financial Times. 1 January 2018. Retrieved 29 November 2018. *To carry distressed companies while searching for an acquirer or larger investor (in which case the lender often obtains a substantial equity position in connection with the loan) *As a final debt financing to carry the company through the immediate period before an initial public offering or an acquisition. South Africa In South African law immovable property is transferred via a system of registration in public registries known as Deeds Offices.Badenhorst, PJ et al. Silberberg & Schoeman's The Law of Property. Fourth Edition. Butterwoths. 2003Deeds Registries Act, 47 of 1937 Given the delays resulting from the transfer process, many participants in property transactions require access to funds which will otherwise only become available on the day that the transaction is registered in the relevant Deeds Office. Bridging finance companies provide finance that creates a bridge between the participant's immediate cash flow requirement and the eventual entitlement to funds on registration in the Deeds Office. Bridging finance is typically not provided by banks. Various forms of bridging finance are available, depending on the participant in the property transaction that requires finance. Sellers of fixed property can bridge sales proceeds, estate agents bridge estate agents' commission, and mortgagors bridge the proceeds of further or switch bonds. Bridging finance is also available to settle outstanding property taxes or municipal accounts or to pay transfer duties. United Kingdom =History= Short term finance similar to modern bridging loans was available in the UK as early as the 1960s, but usually only through high street banks and building societies to known customers.Brief history of the bridging finance sector Mortgage Finance Gazette. 4 August 2016. Retrieved 27 November 2018. The bridging loan market remained small into the millennium, with a limited number of lenders. Bridging loans became increasingly popular in the UK after the 2008‚Äì2009 global recession, with gross lending more than doubling from ¬£0.8 billion in the year to March 2011 to ¬£2.2 billion in the year to June 2014. This coincided with a marked decline in mainstream mortgage lending in the same period, as banks and building societies grew more reluctant to grant home loans.Bridging loans guide . Money Supermarket. Accessed on 1 Jun 2015. The overall value of the residential loan amounts outstanding in Q1 2016 was ¬£1,304.5billion, an increase of 1.0% compared with Q4 2015 and an increase of 3.4% over the past four quarters. As the popularity of bridging loans increased, so too did the controversy around them. In 2011, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) warned homebuyers against using bridging loans as substitutes for ordinary mortgages, expressing fears that some mortgage brokers might be misrepresenting their suitability.Powley, T. Borrowers warned on bridging loans. Financial Times. 25 Nov 2011 =Usage= In the United Kingdom, bridging loans are used in both business and real estate. In the former, they are typically used to free equity in order to boost cash flow. In the latter, they are used by home-movers to ‚Äòbreak‚Äô property chains by providing a short-term source of finance when there is a delay between sale and completion dates, by buyers bidding on property at auction, and by landlords and property developers to secure renovation finance for quick sale or to refurbish a property that is considered uninhabitable prior to obtaining ordinary mortgage finance. =Characteristics= Bridging loans can be secured as a first or second charge against real property, including commercial real estate, buy-to-let property, dilapidated property and land or building plots. Loan terms typically run up to 18 months, with compound interest charged monthly; as such, they are often more expensive than other types of secured home loan. Bridging loans are defined as either ‚Äòopened‚Äô or ‚Äòclosed‚Äô. A loan is closed if the borrower has a clear and credible repayment plan or exit strategy in place, such as the sale of the loan security or longer-term finance.Haill, O. Types of bridging loan and how they compare to alternatives. FT Adviser. Apr 18 2013. Open bridging loans are riskier to both the borrower and creditor due to the greater likelihood of default. =Regulation= Bridging loans secured by first charge against a property in which the borrower or a close family member will reside are considered regulated mortgage contracts, and are therefore regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Bridging loans sold to landlords and property developers are generally not regulated; however, if the occupant of the rental property against which the loan is secured is or will be a close family member of the borrower, FCA regulation will still apply.Financial Conduct Authority Handbook PERG 4.4.1 . Accessed on 1 Jun 2015. An exception currently exists in the case of mixed-use properties, where the borrower or a close relative will occupy less than 40% of the property. In March 2016, however, the UK will be forced to bring its existing legislation in line with that of Europe, under the pan-European Mortgage Credit Directive (MCD).

A prominent member of the Nazi Party, she was a close ally, companion, and political supporter of Adolf Hitler. Some historians refer to her as the unofficial \\"first lady\\" of Nazi Germany, while others give that title to Emmy G√∂ring. With defeat imminent during the Battle of Berlin at the end of World War II in Europe, she and her husband murdered their six children before committing suicide in the Reich Chancellery gardens. Her eldest son, Harald Quandt, from a previous marriage, survived her. Early life Magda was born in 1901 in Berlin, Germany to unwed Auguste Behrend and building contractor and engineer Oskar Ritschel. The couple were married later that year and divorced in either 1904 or 1905.Magda Goebbels biography at Deutsches Historisches Museum, Berlin There are some sources that claim the marriage was before Magda's birth, but there is no evidence to support a prior wedding occurred.Arditti, Michael, goebbels-by-anja-klabunde/ Magda Goebbels by Anja Klabunde Literary Review, 22 May 2002. When Magda was five, her mother sent her to Cologne to stay with her ex-husband. In 1908, her mother married Richard Friedl√§nder, a wealthy Jewish merchant who worked in Brussels, who adopted Magda and whose surname she adopted. In Brussels, Magda was enrolled at the Ursuline Convent in Vilvoorde where she was remembered as \\"an active and intelligent little girl\\".de Launay, Jaques, Hitler en Flandres, 1975. Further contacts with Ritschel, a member of the Krefeld Masonic Lodge in Duisburg, Magda may have been introduced there to Buddhism. In 2016, it was reported that Friedl√§nder may have been actually Magda's biological father, as stated in his residency card, found in the Berlin archives by writer and historian Oliver Hilmes.Magda Goebbels' biological father may have been Jewish Jewish Chronicle. 21 August 2016. Retrieved 22 August 2016. Hence, Magda's adoption may have been required just for her parents' delayed marriage, to update the girls 'illegitimate child' status.Magda Goebbels, Gef√§hrtin des B√∂sen In: Der Spiegel Vol. 39, 24. September 2001 From 1908 until the outbreak of World War I, the family remained in Brussels. At that time, all Germans were forced to leave Belgium as refugees to avoid repercussions from the Belgian people after the German invasion. The family moved to Berlin where Magda attended the high school Kolmorgen Lyc√©e. Behrend divorced Friedl√§nder in 1914, and in 1919, Magda was enrolled in the prestigious Holzhausen Ladies' College near Goslar. While in Berlin, Magda befriended Lisa Arlosoroff and later became intimate with her brother Victor Haim, an ardent Zionist. During her relationship with Arlosoroff, she briefly wore a Star of David he had given her and joined him to the Jewish youth club meetings. However the relationship did not last but the two remained in contact during the 1920s until Victor's immigration to (British ruled) Palestine, where he later headed the Political Department of the Jewish Agency. Marriage and son with G√ºnther Quandt In 1920, while returning to school on a train, she met G√ºnther Quandt, a rich German industrialist twice her age. Thereafter, he courted her with courtesy and grand gestures. He demanded that she change her surname back to Ritschel (having borne many years the surname of Friedl√§nder), when converting from Catholicism to Quandt's Protestantism. They were married on 4 January 1921, and their first child, Harald, was born on 1 November 1921. Magda soon grew frustrated in her marriage because Quandt spent little time with her. His main interest seemed to be the expansion of his business empire. She was left to look after six children - Harald, with Quandt's two sons from a prior marriage, and three children from a deceased friend, then run the whole household. In October 1927, the couple went on a two-month visit to the United States, to conduct a business with the Lloyd Electric Storage Battery Co. of Philadelphia.List or Manifest of Alien Passengers For the United States Immigration Officer At the Port of Arrival (Form 500 U.S. Department of Labor, Immigration Service), pp. 7‚Äì8, number on list 3 & 4, dated 22 & 28 October 1927. In 1929, Quandt discovered that Magda was having an affair, so they separated, then went on to divorce that same year, which terms were however quite generous with Magda. Marriage and family with Joseph Goebbels Joseph and Magda's wedding day, with her son Harald Quandt in his Deutsches Jungvolk uniform. Adolf Hitler, their best man, can be seen in the background. In 1930, Magda attended a meeting of the Nazi Party where she was impressed by one of the speakers, Joseph Goebbels, then the Gauleiter of Berlin. She joined the party on 1 September 1930, and did some volunteer work, although she has not been characterized as politically active. From the local branch, Magda moved to the party headquarters in Berlin and for a brief period became secretary to Hans Meinshausen, Goebbels' deputy, before being invited to take charge of Goebbels' own private papers. She and Goebbels became romantically involved while on a short trip with friends to Weimar in February 1931. A relationship began and by April they began making plans for their future together. Goebbels wrote in his diary, \\"We have made a solemn vow to each other: When we have conquered the Reich, we will become man and wife. I am very happy.\\" Her flat on Theodor-Heuss-Platz (then named the Reichskanzlerplatz) soon became a favourite meeting place for Adolf Hitler and other NSDAP officials. By September, the Goebbels relationship was experiencing problems. Goebbels was often jealous, and had some concern over the fact that Hitler had grown fond of Magda. Magda decided to advance their wedding date, and the couple were married on 19 December 1931, with Hitler as a witness. Otto Wagener claims that Magda's marriage to Goebbels was somewhat arranged; since Hitler intended to remain unmarried, it was suggested that as the wife of a leading and highly visible Nazi official she might eventually act as \\"first lady of the Third Reich\\". Magda was an ambitious woman with social connections and upper class bearing that may have influenced Goebbels' own enthusiasm.Wagener, Otto, Hitler: Memoirs of a Confidant Goebbels biographer Peter Longerich concurred with this \\"plausible\\" conclusion as well. Meissner contends that Hitler (though undoubtedly impressed by Magda) was an exceptionally close friend of the couple in the early days. Hitler grew very fond of the Goebbels' children and enjoyed staying at their Berlin apartment, where he could relax and would often arrive there late at night, sitting and talking with Goebbels, with their baby Helga (born 1932) on his lap. The Goebbels family in 1942: (back row) Hildegard, Harald Quandt, Helga; (front row) Helmut, Hedwig, Magda, Heidrun, Joseph and Holdine. (In this well-known manipulated image,Federal Archive of Germany, image no. 146-1978-086-03 the visage of the uniformed Harald, who was actually away on military duties, was inserted and retouched.) Magda had thus a close relationship with Hitler, and became a member of his small coterie of female friends. She acted as an unofficial representative of the regime, receiving letters from all over Germany from women with questions about domestic matters or child custody issues. After 1933, the Goebbels family became accustomed to the luxurious lifestyle which went with their high social position. Their Berlin home on G√∂ringstrasse was remodeled by Albert Speer and they spent the spring and summers in Kladow. In 1936, they bought a villa on Schwanenwerder island and later another at Bogensee near Wandlitz in Brandenburg. Joseph and Magda Goebbels had six children: Helga Susanne (1932), Hildegard \\"Hilde\\" Traudel (1934), Helmut Christian (1935), Holdine \\"Holde\\" Kathrin (1937), Hedwig \\"Hedda\\" Johanna (1938), and Heidrun \\"Heide\\" Elisabeth (1940). Goebbels' villa on Bogensee. 2008 condition Yet, Joseph Goebbels had many affairs during the marriage. In 1936, Goebbels met the Czech actress L√≠da Baarov√° and by the winter of 1937 began an intense affair with her. Magda had a long conversation with Hitler about the situation on 15 August 1938. Unwilling to put up with a scandal involving one of his top ministers, Hitler demanded that Goebbels break off the relationship. Thereafter, Goebbels and Magda seemed to reach a truce until the end of September. The couple had another falling out at that point, and once again Hitler became involved, insisting the couple stay together. Hitler arranged for publicity photos to be taken of himself with the reconciled couple in October 1938. Magda also had affairs, including a relationship with Kurt Ludecke in 1933 and Karl Hanke in 1938. War years At the outbreak of war, Magda's son by her first marriage, Harald Quandt, became a Luftwaffe pilot and fought at the front, while, at home, she lived up to the image of a patriotic mother by training as a Red Cross nurse and working with the electronics company Telefunken, and travelled to work on a bus, like her colleagues. She was also involved with entertaining the wives of the foreign heads of state, supporting the troops and comforting war widows. Both Goebbels and Magda derived personal benefits and social status from their close association with Hitler, and the couple remained loyal to Hitler and publicly supported him. Privately, however, Magda expressed doubts, especially after the war began to go badly on the Eastern Front. On 9 November 1942, during a gathering with friends listening to a speech by Hitler, she switched off the radio exclaiming, \\"My God, what a lot of rubbish.\\" In 1944, she reportedly said of Hitler, \\"He no longer listens to voices of reason. Those who tell him what he wants to hear are the only ones he believes.\\" There is no evidence that Magda attempted to intervene to save her Jewish stepfather from the Holocaust. Though his fate has not been established, it is widely assumed that he perished in the camps. Asked about her husband's antisemitism, she answered: \\"The F√ºhrer wants it thus, and Joseph must obey.\\" Felix Franks, a German Jew who later became a British soldier, claimed that his grandparents got an exit visa from Germany with the help of Magda Goebbels: Afflicted with a weak heart and \\"delicate health\\", Magda would have extended periods of illness. Towards the end of the war, she is known to have also suffered from severe depression and trigeminal neuralgia.Klabunde, Anja, Magda Goebbels, p. 302. This condition affects a nerve in the face, and although usually harmless is considered to cause intense pain and can be notoriously hard to treat.What is Trigeminal Neuralgia? TNA Website This often left her bedridden and led to bouts of hospitalization as late as August 1944. Death In late April 1945, the Soviet Red Army entered Berlin, and the Goebbels family moved into the Vorbunker, connected to the lower F√ºhrerbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden. Magda wrote a farewell letter to her son Harald, who was in a POW camp in North Africa: Goebbels added a postscript to Hitler's last will and testament of 29 April stating that he would disobey the order to leave Berlin, \\"[f]or reasons of humanity and personal loyalty\\". Further, he stated that Magda and their children supported his refusal to leave Berlin and his resolution to die in the bunker. He later qualified this by stating that the children would support the decision [to commit suicide] if they were old enough to speak for themselves. Magda was among the last to see both Hitler and Eva Braun before they committed suicide on the afternoon of 30 April. On the following day, 1 May, Magda and Joseph arranged for SS dentist Helmut Kunz to inject their six children with morphine so that when they were unconscious, an ampule of cyanide could be then crushed in each of their mouths. Kunz later stated he gave the children morphine injections, but it was Magda and SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Ludwig Stumpfegger (Hitler's personal doctor) who administered the cyanide. Author James P. O'Donnell concluded that although Stumpfegger was probably involved in drugging the children, Magda killed them herself. He surmises that witnesses blamed the deaths on Stumpfegger because he was a convenient target, having died the following day. Moreover, as O'Donnell states, Stumpfegger may have been too intoxicated at the time of the deaths to have played a reliable role. Magda appears to have contemplated and talked about killing her children a month in advance. According to her friend and sister-in-law (from her first marriage) Ello Quandt, she told her that they were all going to take poison. She appears to have refused several offers, such as one by Albert Speer, to have the children smuggled out of Berlin and insisted that the family must stay at her husband's side. In the F√ºhrerbunker she confided to Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, that \\"I would rather have my children die, than live in disgrace, jeered at. My children stand no chance in Germany after the war\\".Junge, Traudl, Until the Final Hour The last survivor of Hitler's bunker, Rochus Misch, gave this account of the events to the BBC: She helped the girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. Misch tried to concentrate on his work, but he knew what was going to happen. Magda then went back up to the Vorbunker with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the F√ºhrerbunker and told Misch that he had seen Hitler's personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger, give the children something \\"sweetened\\" to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the F√ºhrerbunker, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red and her face was \\"frozen\\". She sat down at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time. After their children were dead, Magda and Joseph Goebbels walked up to the garden of the Chancellery, where they committed suicide. There are several different accounts of this event. One account was that they each bit on a cyanide ampule near where Hitler had been buried, and were given a coup de gr√¢ce immediately afterwards. Goebbels' SS adjutant G√ºnther Schw√§germann testified in 1948 that they walked ahead of him up the stairs and out into the Chancellery garden. He waited in the stairwell and heard the shots sound. Schw√§germann then walked up the remaining stairs and, once outside, saw their lifeless bodies. Following Goebbels' prior order, Schw√§germann had an SS soldier fire several shots into Goebbels' body, which did not move. The bodies were then doused with petrol, but the remains were only partially burned and not buried. The charred corpses were found on the afternoon of 2 May 1945 by Soviet troops. Magda's face was unrecognizable compared to that of her husband. The children were found in the Vorbunker dressed in their nightclothes, with ribbons tied in the girls' hair. The remains of the Goebbels' family, Hitler, Eva Braun, General Hans Krebs, and Hitler's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed. The last burial was at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg on 21 February 1946. In 1970, KGB director Yuri Andropov authorised an operation to destroy the remains. On 4 April 1970, a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the Magdeburg facility. The remains from the boxes were burned, crushed, and scattered into the Biederitz river, a tributary of the nearby Elbe.

It is grown as a leaf vegetable and usually has colorful white-veined red leaves that form a head. Radicchio has a bitter and spicy taste which mellows if it is grilled or roasted.  History  Pliny the Elder said that radicchio was useful as a blood purifier and an aid for insomniacs in Naturalis Historia. Radicchio contains intybin, a sedative/analgesic, as well as a type of flavonoid called anthocyanin. Modern cultivation of the plant began in the fifteenth century in the Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Trentino regions of Italy, but the deep-red radicchio of today was engineered in 1860 by Belgian agronomist Francesco Van den Borre, who used a technique called imbianchimento (whitening), preforcing, or blanching to create the dark red, white-veined leaves. The plants are taken from the soil and placed in water in darkened sheds, where lack of light and ensuing inhibition of chlorophyll production cause the plants to lose their green pigmentation.  Varieties  The varieties of radicchio are named after the Italian regions where they originate: the most widely available variety in the United States is radicchio di Chioggia, the most popular and widely used variety. It is a round head of plant which means that it offers the consumer the most uninterrupted surface of the deep red colouring. It was created through genetic selection by local farmers in the early 1900s for exactly this reason. The IGP area for Chioggia includes just ten towns from the boroughs of Venice (where you find Chioggia itself), Padua, and Rovigo. Radicchio rosso di Treviso precoce is a longer head than Chioggia and the white veins are more pronounced. It has a distinctive bitter taste and the heads are blanched as per the endive procedure to achieve the colouring and flavouring (heads are tied and left without light for two to three weeks post-harvest). The IGP area includes 24 towns in the boroughs of Treviso, Venice and Padua. Other varieties include 'Tardivo', Treviso tardivo is considered the king of radicchio in Italy, a real gourmet specialty. It involves weeks of painstaking manual labour using a very traditional forced growing and blanching method to produce the white ribs with red tops. After harvest the heads are left in tanks of running resurgence water for two weeks. They are then cut, washed and packaged. There are strict regulations on the length and appearance of the root that is left on the head. Radicchio tardivo is crunchy and bitter and are normally eaten cooked. The di Castelfranco, both of which resemble flowers and Castelfranco is very different in appearance to the other radicchio types with creamy, light green leaves and deep red speckles. It has a sweeter flavour than the other varieties and is thought to have first been cultivated in the 800‚Äôs originating from crossing original radicchio plants with an escarole. The IGP area covers 25 towns in the boroughs of Treviare only available in the winter months, as well as 'Gorizia' (also known as \\"Rosa di Gorizia\\"), 'Trieste' (Cicoria zuccherina or Biondissim ) Radicchio farmers of the Veneto have sought to have Protected Geographical Status applied to the names of some radicchio varieties including 'Tardivo'.  Culinary uses  In Italian cuisine, it is usually eaten grilled with olive oil, or mixed into dishes such as risotto. It can also be served with pasta, or be used in strudel, as a poultry stuffing, or an ingredient for a tapenade. As with all chicories, its roots, after roasting and grinding, can be used as a coffee substitute or coffee additive.  Toxicity  According to folklore, long-term use of chicory as a coffee substitute may damage human retinal tissue, with dimming of vision over time and other long-term effects. Modern scientific literature contains little or no evidence to support or refute this claim. Root chicory contains volatile oils similar to those found in plants in the related genus Tanacetum which includes tansy, and is likewise effective in eliminating intestinal worms. All parts of the plant contain these volatile oils, with most of the toxic components concentrated in the plant's root.Edible and Medicinal Plants of the West, Gregory L. Tilford, Studies indicate that ingestion of chicory by farm animals results in reduction of worm burdens, which has prompted its widespread use as a forage supplement. There are only a few major companies active in research, development and production of chicory varieties and selections. Most are in New Zealand.  Cultivation  Radicchio is easy to grow but performs best in spring (USDA Zone 8 and above) and autumn gardens. It prefers more frequent but not deep watering, though the amount of water varies based on soil type. Infrequent watering will lead to a more bitter tasting leaf. However, for autumn crops the flavor is changed predominantly by the onset of cold weather (the colder, the mellower), which also initiates the heading and reddening process in traditional varieties. There are newer, self-heading varieties whose taste is not yet as good as a traditional variety which has matured through several frosts or freezes (e.g., Alouette). Radicchio matures in approximately three months. However, it can be made to stand through a UK or West European winter, and the head will regenerate if cut off carefully above ground level, so long as the plant is protected against severe frost. A light-excluding cover, e.g. an inverted pot, may be used during the latter phases of growth to produce leaves with a more pronounced colour contrast, simultaneously protecting against frost and cold winds. Traditionally in the UK, the first cutting of chicory heads was thrown away, and the tender, forced, second head was for the table. However, improved varieties of radicchio, e.g. Rosso di Verona, and generally milder winters allow the West European cultivator to harvest two or more crops from a single planting.

A usufruct is either granted in severalty or held in common ownership, as long as the property is not damaged or destroyed. The third civilian property interest is abusus (literally abuse), the right to alienate the thing possessed, either by consuming or destroying it (e.g., for profit), or by transferring it to someone else (e.g., sale, exchange, gift). Someone enjoying all three rights has full ownership. Generally, a usufruct is a system in which a person or group of persons uses the real property (often land) of another. The \\"usufructuary\\" does not own the property, but does have an interest in it, which is sanctioned or contractually allowed by the owner. Two different systems of usufruct exist: perfect and imperfect. In a perfect usufruct, the usufructuary is entitled the use of the property but cannot substantially change it. For example, an owner of a small business may become ill and grant the right of usufruct to an individual to run their business. The usufructuary thus has the right to operate the business and gain income from it, but does not have the right to, for example, tear down the business and replace it, or to sell it. The imperfect usufruct system gives the usufructuary some ability to modify the property. For example, if a land owner grants a piece of land to a usufructuary for agricultural use, the usufructuary may have the right to not only grow crops on the land but also make improvements that would help in farming, say by building a barn. However this can be disadvantageous to the usufructuary: if a usufructuary makes material improvements - such as a building, or fixtures attached to the building, or other fixed structures - to their usufruct, they do not own the improvements, and any money spent on those improvements would belong to the original owner at the end of the usufruct. In many usufructuary property systems, such as the traditional ejido system in Mexico, individuals or groups may only acquire the usufruct of the property, not legal ownership. A usufruct is directly equatable to a common-law life estate except that a usufruct can be granted for a term shorter than the holder's lifetime (cestui que vie).  History  Usufruct comes from civil law, under which it is a subordinate real right (ius in re aliena) of limited duration, usually for a person's lifetime. The holder of a usufruct, known as a usufructuary, has the right to use (usus) the property and enjoy its fruits (fructus). In modern terms, fructus more or less corresponds to the profit one may make, as when selling the \\"fruits\\" (in both literal and figurative senses) of the land or leasing a house. Fruits refers to any renewable commodity on the property, including (among others) actual fruits, livestock and even rental payments derived from the property. These may be divided into civil (fructus civiles), industrial (fructus industriales), and natural fruits (fructus naturales), the latter of which, in Roman law, included slaves and livestock. Under Roman law, usufruct was a type of personal servitude (servitutes personarum), a beneficial right in another's property. The usufructuary never had possession of this property (on the basis that if he possessed at all, he did so through the owner), but he did have an interest in the property itself for a period, either a term of years, or a lifetime. Unlike the owner, the usufructuary did not have a right of alienation (abusus), but he could sell or lease his usufructuary interest. Even though a usufructuary did not have possessory title, he could sue for relief in the form of a modified possessory interdict (prohibiting order). In some indigenous cultures, usufruct means the land is owned in common by the people, but families and individuals have the right to use certain plots of land. Land is considered village or communal land rather than owned by individual people. While people can take fruits of the land, they may not sell or abuse it in ways that stop future use of the land by the community. Ancient examples of usufruct are found in the Code of Hammurabi and the Law of Moses. The Law of Moses directed property owners not to harvest the edges of their fields, and reserved the gleanings for the poor.Leviticus 19:9-10, 23:22. Thomas Jefferson famously wrote in 1789 that \\"Earth belongs in usufruct to the living.\\" Jefferson's metaphor means that, like a usufructuary, human beings have the right to use the earth for their own benefit and derive profit from it. Jefferson's use of the word \\"living\\" is critical here: he meant that the usufructuaries of the world are those who are alive, not deceased past generations. This idea would profoundly influence Jefferson over the course of his life, and would lead to his acknowledgement that the Constitution of the United States would be revised by future generations, and was part of the reason that the Constitution includes a provision for its own amendment.  Local variations  = France = In France usufruct applies in inheritances. Under French law an indefeasible portion known as the forced estate passes to the deceased's surviving spouse and issue (with shares apportioned according to the number of children), with the rest of the estate ‚Äì the free estate ‚Äì free to dispose of by will. However, the surviving spouse may elect to distribute the forced estate as is, or convert it into a usufruct, or break up the estate into a distributable portion and a usufruct good for the children's lifetime. If a usufruct is chosen, a value is set for the usufruct interest for inheritance tax purposes and payable by the surviving spouse, on a sliding scale according to his/her age. The value of furniture and household items is calculated using a standard formula based on the appraised value of the estate's liquid and non-liquid assets, then the usufruct's value to the surviving spouse is subtracted, and finally the remaining balance is divided among the children on the death of the surviving spouse. This simplifies handling household items since the surviving spouse is free to maintain, replace or dispose of them as he/she wishes during his/her lifetime, with the monetary value of the items going to the children. Title to assets does not pass, and the usufruct disappears on death or at the end of a term of years. A usufruct is distinct from a trust or similar settlement. French law breaks with Roman law by construing a usufruct as not a servitude but rather a possessory interest. = United States = Louisiana Although the United States is for the most part a common law jurisdiction recognizing life estate instead of usufruct, Louisiana is a civil-law jurisdiction, specifically following the French and Spanish models. In Louisiana, usufructs generally are created in a manner similar to other real rights, by gift (\\"donation\\"), will (\\"testament\\"), or operation of law. Nevertheless, they are typically granted cestui que vie. Unless otherwise provided in a will, a person's share of community property accedes to descendants as bare title holders (\\"naked owners\\"); nevertheless, if that person has a living spouse, the latter will receive a usufruct in that portion of the estate until death or remarriage (La. Civil Code art. 890). Under certain other conditions, a usufruct may arise giving rights to that person's parents.La. C.C. art. 891. Georgia While Georgia does not share Louisiana's civil law history, Georgia General Assembly statutorily created usufructs.Ga. L. 1876, p. 35, ¬ß 1. In Georgia, a usufruct is \\"rights or privileges usually arising out of landlord and tenant relationships, and with privileges granted to tenants holding less interest in real estate than estate for years\\".Roe v. Doe, 246 Ga. 138, 140, 268 S.E.2d 901, 904 (1980) (quoting Martin v. Heard, 239 Ga. 816, 818 ‚Äì 19, 238 S.E.2d 899, 901 (1977)). Under Georgia law, if a landowner grants a lease for fewer than five years, the lease agreement is a usufruct, and the landowner retains the estate.O.C.G.A. ¬ß 44-7-1 Additionally, Georgia courts consider as a usufruct any relationship between a landowner and a lessee where the restrictions are \\"so pervasive as to be fundamentally inconsistent with the concept of an estate for years\\", or the landowner retains \\"dominion and control\\" over the business operating on the property.Diversified Golf, LLC v. Hart County Bd. of Tax Assessors, 267 Ga. App. 8, 14, 598 S.E.2d 791, 796 (2004) (quoting Camp v. Delta Air Lines, 232 Ga. 37, 40, 205 S.E.2d 194 (1974); Allright Parking of Georgia v.

App. 172, 173, 235 S.E.2d 556 (1977)). = Philippines = Philippine law relating to usufruct is set forth primarily in Title VI of the Philippine Civil Code.Book II, Property, Ownership, and its Modifications, Republic Act No. 386, The Civil Code of the Philippines (June 18, 1949), Chan Robles Law Library. = Thailand = In Thailand the Commercial and Civil Code is based on the European civil code and recognizes the notion of usufruct at clauses 1417 to 1428. The usufruct can be done for lifetime or a maximum of 30 years according to the law. It needs to be registered at the local land department to have full effect on third parties, on title deed Nor Sor Sam or higher. The land department in Thailand will use their own forms and contracts. However, parties can make their own agreements. A usufruct contract in Thai and English is available here, payment of fee required for download. =Scotland= A liferent, by which a usufruct is known in Scots law, is the right to receive for life the benefits of a property or other asset, without the right to dispose of the property or asset. An individual who enjoys this right is called a liferenter. The owner of a property burdened by a usufruct is called the fiar and right of ownership is known as the fee. =Cuba= Usufruct has been revived as part of the agricultural change associated with Cuba's Special Period. As a legacy of sanctions and a struggling economy, Cuba had accumulated many crumbling buildings that could not be repaired. These were torn down and the empty lots lay idle for years until the food shortages forced Cuban citizens to make use of every piece of land. Initially, this was an ad-hoc process where ordinary Cubans took the initiative to grow their own food in whatever piece of land was available. Tenure but not ownership was formalised with a legal framework using usufruct to give farmers rights on a profit-sharing basis to the products produced from the land, but not ownership rights to the land itself.

Biography  Victor Grignard in 1912. Taken for Nobel Prize publication. Grignard was the son of a sail maker. His character was described as having humble and friendly attitude. After attempting to major in mathematics, Grignard failed his entrance exams before being enlisted into the army in 1892. Wisniak, Jaime. ‚ÄúFran√ßois Auguste Victor Grignard.‚Äù Educaci√≥n Qu√≠mica, vol. 15, no. 4, 2018, p. 425., doi:10.22201/fq.18708404e.2004.4.66168.After one year of service, he went back to pursue mathematics at the University of Lyon and finally obtained his degree Licenci√© √®s Sciences Math√©matiques in 1894.‚ÄúThe Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1912.‚Äù Nobelprize.org, www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1912/grignard/biographical/. Accessed 18 Nov. 2018. In December of the same year, he transferred to chemistry and began working with Professors Philippe Barbier (1848‚Äì1922) and Louis Bouveault (1864‚Äì1909). After working with stereochemistry and enines, Grignard was not impressed with the subject matter and asked Barbier about a new direction for his doctoral research. Barbier advised that Grignard research how a failed Saytzeff reaction, using zinc, was successful, in low yields, after using magnesium. They sought to synthesize alcohols from alkyl halides, aldehydes, ketones, and alkenes. Grignard hypothesized that the aldehyde/ketone prevented the magnesium from reacting with the alkyl halide which resulted in the low yields. He tested his hypothesis by first adding the alkyl halide and magnesium filings to a solution of anhydrous ether and then adding the aldehyde/ketone. This resulted in a drastic increase in the yield of the reaction. A couple of years later, Grignard was able to isolate the intermediate. He had heated a mixture of magnesium turnings, isobutyl iodide, and added dry ethyl ether to the mixture and a reaction was observed. The product is known as a Grignard Reagent. Named after him, this organo-magnesium compound (R-MgX) (R = alkyl ; X = Halogen) readily reacts with ketones, aldehydes, and alkenes to produce their respective alcohols in impressive yields. Grignard had discovered the synthetic reaction which now bears his name (the Grignard reaction) in 1900. In 1901, Grignard published his doctoral thesis titled \\"Th√®ses sur les combinaisons organomagnesiennes mixtes et leur application √† des synth√®ses d‚Äòacides, d‚Äòalcools et d‚Äòhydrocarbures\\". He became a professor at the University of Nancy in 1910. That same year, he and Paul Sabatier (1854-1941) were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912. During World War I he studied chemical warfare agents with Georges Urbain at Sorbonne University, particularly the manufacture of phosgene and the detection of mustard gas.In 1918, Grignard discovered that sodium iodide could be used as a battlefield test for mustard gas. Sodium iodide converts mustard gas to diiododiethyl sulfide, which crystallizes more easily than mustard gas. This test could detect as little as 0.01 gram of mustard gas in one cubic meter of air and was successfully used on the battlefield. His counterpart on the German side was another Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning chemist, Fritz Haber. Grignard reaction Grignard is most noted for devising a new method for generating carbon-carbon bonds using magnesium to couple ketones and alkyl halides. This reaction is valuable in organic synthesis. It occurs in two steps: #Formation of the \\"Grignard reagent\\", which is an organomagnesium compound made by the reaction an organohalide, R-X (R = alkyl or aryl; and X is a halide, usually bromide or iodide) with magnesium metal. The Grignard reagent is usually described with the general chemical formula R-Mg-X, although its structure is more complex. #Addition of the carbonyl, in which a ketone or an aldehyde is added to the solution containing the Grignard reagent. The carbon atom that is bonded to Mg transfers to the carbonyl carbon atom, and the oxygen of the carbonyl carbon becomes attached to the magnesium to give an alkoxide. The process is an example of a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl. After the addition, the reaction mixture is treated with aqueous acid to give an alcohol, and the magnesium salts are subsequently discarded.  Military service  Grignard was drafted into the French military as part of obligatory military service in 1892. Within the two years of his first session of service he rose to the rank of corporal. He was demobilized in 1894 and returned to Lyon to pursue his education. He was awarded a medal of the Legion of Honour and made a Chevalier in 1912 after winning the Nobel Prize. When World War I broke out, Grignard was drafted back into the military, keeping his rank of corporal. He was placed on sentry duty, and served there for several months until he was brought to the attention of the General Staff. Grignard had been wearing his Medal of the Legion of Honour, despite being ordered to take it off by a superior. After looking more into Grignard, the General Staff decided that he would be better suited for research than sentry duty, so they assigned him to the explosives division. Grignard's research shifted to antidotes to chemical weapons when production of TNT was no longer sustainable, and eventually Grignard was assigned to research new chemical weapons for the French army.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1919 to his death in 1953. He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for 35 years, first for Sinn F√©in and later as a member of Fianna F√°il, before becoming Ceann Comhairle (chairman) for over 19 years. Early life Fahy was born on 23 May 1879 in the townland of Glenatallan, Kilchreest, County Galway, the eldest of 6 children born to John Fahy and Maria Jones. His father taught at the local National School. After an early education at his father's school in Kilchreest, he attended Mungret College in County Limerick. He later studied at University College Galway. He earned a Bachelor of Arts and a H.Dip. in Education, and a Diploma in Science. From 1906 to 1921 he taught Latin, Irish and Science at Castleknock College (St Vincent's College), Dublin. Fahy qualified as a barrister in 1927 at King's Inns, Dublin and also taught at the Christian Brothers school in Tralee. He was at one time General Secretary of the Conradh na Gaeilge. He married Anna Barton of Tralee, a metal artist and member of the Cumann na mBan in 1908. They had no children. Political career Fahy was first elected at the 1918 general election as a Sinn F√©in Member of Parliament (MP) for South Galway, but as the party was pledged to abstentionism he did not take his seat in the British House of Commons and joined the revolutionary First D√°il. He was re- elected as TD for Galway in 1921 general election and having sided with the anti-treaty forces following the Anglo-Irish Treaty, he did not take his seat in either the 3rd D√°il or the 4th D√°il. He joined Fianna F√°il when the party was founded in 1926, and along with the 42 other Fianna F√°il TDs he took his seat in the 5th D√°il on 12 August 1927, three days before the D√°il tied 71 votes to 71 on a motion of no confidence which persuaded W. T. Cosgrave's Cumann na nGaedheal government to call a general election in search of a majority. After the September 1927 election, Cosgrave was able to form a minority government with the support of the Farmers' Party and some independent TDs. However, in the 1932 general election, Fianna F√°il won just under half of the seats and formed a government with the support of the Labour Party. The first business was of the 7th D√°il was the election of the Ceann Comhairle, and on 9 March 1932 Fahy was nominated for the position by Se√°n T. O'Kelly, winning the vote by a margin of 74 to 71. He held the post until Fianna F√°il lost the 1951 election, and at the start of the 14th D√°il he did not offer himself for re-election as Ceann Comhairle. He was replaced by the Labour TD Patrick Hogan. His 19 years in the chair remains the longest of any Ceann Comhairle, and the only other person to exceed 10 years as Ceann Comhairle was his successor, Patrick Hogan. The 1932 election was the last which Fahy contested; as Ceann Comhairle, he was automatically re-elected at the next seven elections. When his Galway constituency was divided for the 1937 general election, he was returned unopposed for the new Galway East, and similarly in 1948 for the new Galway South constituency. Fahy died on 12 July 1953, and is buried at Deans Grange Cemetery, Dublin. The Galway South by- election held after his death was won by the Fianna F√°il candidate Robert Lahiffe.

She was the wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. Biography She was born Elizabeth Posthuma Gwillim in the village of Whitchurch, Herefordshire, England, daughter of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Gwillim and Elizabeth Spinckes. Her father died before her birth, and her mother died shortly afterwards. After her baptism, which was on the same day as her mother's burial, she was taken into the care of her mother's younger sister, Margaret. In commemoration of her posthumous birth, Elizabeth was given the middle name Posthuma. Her adopted mother, Margaret, married Admiral Samuel Graves on 14 June 1769 and she grew up at Graves's estate, Hembury Fort near Honiton in Devon. Gwillim was part of a group of friends that included Mary Anne Burges in Honiton.The Progress of the Pilgrim Good-Intent, in Jacobinical Times, Mary Ann Burges, AbeBooks, retrieved 2 August 2014 York Harbour before settlement. York would become the city of Toronto On 30 December 1782, Elizabeth married John Graves Simcoe, Admiral Graves' godson. They had four daughters and one son, Francis Simcoe, for whom they named Castle Frank. Katherine Simcoe, their only daughter to be born in Upper Canada, died in childhood of pneumonia; she is buried at Fort York Garrison. Elizabeth was a wealthy heiress, who acquired a 5,000 acre estate near Honiton in Devon and built Wolford Lodge. Wolford was the Simcoe family seat until 1923.Dictionary of Canadian Biography SIMCOE, JOHN GRAVES She is buried at Wolford Chapel.  Legacy  Elizabeth Simcoe left a diary that provides a valuable impression of life in colonial Ontario. First published in 1934, there was a subsequent transcription published in 1965 and a paperback version issued at the turn of the 21st century, more than 200 years after she wrote it. Her legacy also includes a series of 595 watercolour paintings that depict the town of York, Upper Canada. She was responsible for the naming of Scarborough, an eastern Toronto district, after Scarborough, North Yorkshire. The townships of North, East and West Gwillimbury, just south of Lake Simcoe in central Ontario, are also named for the family. The Township of Whitchurch (today the Town of Whitchurch‚ÄìStouffville, Ontario), was named in honour of her place of birth.Jean Barkey, et al., Whitchurch Township (Toronto: Stoddart, 1993), 14. In December 2007, a statue of Elizabeth Gwillim Simcoe was erected in the town of Bradford West Gwillimbury, while commemorating the 150th anniversary of the town's incorporation. The statue is located in a parkette in front of the Bradford post office at the corner of John Street West and Barrie Street. References  Travels With Elizabeth Simcoe. Archives of Ontario.

Up to three players drive Formula One-like cars on a circuit that is viewed from above. The game is a successor to Gran Trak 10 and the Sprint series, which were black-and-white games from the 1970s. A sequel, Championship Sprint, was released later in the same year. Gameplay Arcade screenshot Up to three players drive simultaneously on a circuit against opponents controlled by the computer. The circuits are viewed from above and always fit on the screen, so the game never scrolls. After three laps the winner advances to the next circuit. There are 8 circuits in total, but the game only ends if gamers can get to race 85 where the bonus Super Speedway circuit is played. As the player goes to higher levels, more and more obstacles appear on the track, like oil puddles and tiny moving tornadoes. If the car touches them, the player loses control over the car for a short time while it is sliding and spinning. Driving into a wall with high speed or falling from one of the bridges destroys the car, but a helicopter will appear to replace it. The car can be customized by collecting wrenches that lie on the track. The player can exchange three of them for improved traction, better acceleration or higher top speed. Ports Super Sprint was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum.Ports to 8 bit home computers A version was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System which was not licensed by Nintendo. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Super Sprint on their August 15, 1986 issue as being the second most-successful upright arcade unit of the year. In 1996, Next Generation listed the arcade version as number 59 on their \\"Top 100 Games of All Time\\". They explained that while the massive understeer in the game is highly unrealistic, it adds a sense of urgency to the gameplay. Legacy =Championship Sprint= Championship Sprint Later in 1986 Championship Sprint was released which is almost identical, but with different tracks, and with a standard-size two-player cabinet instead of Super Sprint's wide 3P cabinet. It was ported to the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, and Commodore 64. =Re-releases= A Game Boy Advance version wad released along with Spy Hunter in a dual-game pack in 2005. Super Sprint was included arcade collection game, Midway Arcade Treasures, for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows.
