He worked consistently, generally playing small parts, through 1919 and into the early 1920s, when the pace of his appearances slowed down. Whether or not this was the result of the industry's switch to sound is not clear. By the mid-20s, his film appearances were few, with two films in 1924, two in 1926, and then two in 1930.

At the time of his death, Matthews owned the Falconwood Club in Grand Island, New York. Early life Matthews was born on March 17, 1855, in Westfield, New York, the son of Harriet (Wells) Matthews and James N. Matthews, an English born printer and publisher who moved to Buffalo in his youth. Matthews' residence, however, was in Buffalo for most of life. He graduated from private schools at 16. He was too young to enter college, so he started working in the office of the Commercial to understand the practical knowledge of typography. He spent two years at the Commercial, as well as traveling. He entered Yale University at the age of eighteen, with the class of 1877. While at Yale, he was a member of the Delta Kappa Freshman Society, Delta Beta Xi, Delta Kappa Epsilon, and at Commencement, he received a colloquy appointment. Career In 1878, a year after his graduation, his father, J. N. Matthews, bought the Buffalo Express (Samuel Langhorne Clemens, also known as Mark Twain, had been the co-editor of the Express from 1869‚Äì1871). Matthews started working in the business office to learn the methods of the business department. He began as clerk and climbed the various steps to business manager. He also took a post graduate course in the editorial department, from telegraph editor and city editor to literary editor. Ultimately, he became treasurer of the \\"Matthews-Northrup Co.,\\" printers and publishers of the Express, of which his father, J. N. Matthews, was the sole owner. In 1888, after the death of his father, the firm of \\"George E. Matthews & Co.\\" became the owners of the Express, and three years later, it was consolidated with the \\"Matthews-Northrup Works\\" into the \\"J.N. Matthews Co.,\\" the corporation of which Matthews was president. =Inventions= Matthews invented the \\"prism print process,\\" a method of printing in four colors that superseded the three color process. He patented a method of indexing books and was the first Buffalo publisher to introduce linotype machines in a newspaper plant. At the time, the plant of the \\"J.N Matthews Co.\\" in Buffalo was one of the largest in the entire country. Personal life 300x300pxOn July 12, 1887, Matthews married Mary Elizabeth Burrows of Buffalo. Together they had three children: George E. Matthews, Jr.; Harriet Wells Matthews, who married J. Randall Williams, Jr. of \\"J. Randall Williams & Co.\\" in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Northern Central Railway; and Burrows Matthews, publisher of the Buffalo Express and later Buffalo Courier-Express from 1911‚Äì1955 upon its consolidation. Although Williams did not hold elected office, he was a friend and supporter of President William McKinley and was a delegate to the 1896 Republican National Convention. He was appointed by Governor Frank W. Higgins to membership in the McKinley Monument Commission, which erected a memorial in Buffalo to McKinley, who had been assassinated at the Pan-American Exposition in 1901. Matthews was a member of many clubs and organizations, including: *The Buffalo Historical Society *The Buffalo Fine Arts Academy *The Buffalo Yale Alumni Association (past president) Matthews owned a country estate, called \\"Falconwood,\\" in Grand Island, New York. Falconwood was the former Falconwood Club, built in 1882 and designed by Joseph Lyman Silsbee, a prominent architect of the time who studied at the first school of architecture in the United States, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Death Matthews died at his Grand Island home on June 11, 1911, from heart disease, which he had been suffering from for several years. Matthews, who was one of Buffalo's most prominent printers, was for several years president of the Typothetae of the City of Buffalo and of the \\"Buffalo Newspaper Publishers Association.\\" He was also a part owner in the Buffalo Printing Ink Works.

The station opened in 1873 and closed in 1965; it is now occupied by a private business. Planning began in 2014 to add Kennebunk as a stop on the Amtrak Downeaster route, but the town cancelled the project in 2018. History =Boston & Maine Railroad= Kennebunk station around 1910, at which time it was the junction for the branch line to Kennebunkport From the 1840s until 1873, the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) used the Portsmouth, Saco and Portland Railroad to reach Portland, Maine. That year, after the joint lease of the PS&P; by the B&M; and the Eastern Railroad ended, the B&M; built an extension of its mainline from South Berwick, Maine to Portland. The foundation for a station at Kennebunk on the new line was begun in 1872 and the station opened the next year. The station was built as a single-story clapboard structure, typical of B&M; stations on the line. The Kennebunk and Kennebunkport Railroad opened in 1883 from Kennebunk to Kennebunkport, Maine. The B&M; operated service on the branch until 1926. Mainline service to Kennebunk continued until the final day of service on January 3, 1965. The station building remains, largely unchanged over the past 130 years. After rail service ended, it was used by several businesses, including as the headquarters of Tom's of Maine. =Downeaster= Track side of the station, where the platform would have been located In 2001, Amtrak begun Downeaster service between Boston and Portland, which ran past but did not stop at Kennebunk. Some residents started to call for a stop at Kennebunk to attract tourists to the town, with serious discussions beginning in 2010. In May 2014, the Northern New England Passenger Rail Authority (which governs Downeaster operations) agreed to add a station stop at Kennebunk. Service as soon as 2015 was considered, but will be delayed until at least 2016 due to the timing of state funding. In June 2014, Kennebunk voters approved a $300,000 tax increment financing (TIF) plan, which along with $60,000 from Maine Department of Transportation Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) funds and another $800,000 in CMAQ funds in 2016 would supply the $1.16 million needed to build the station. In October 2014, $183,000 of the TIF money was dedicated to build a 55-space parking lot near the station. In October 2015, the town signed a grant agreement for the station, though the remaining state funds were not yet guaranteed. The town would also pay the $45,000 in annual maintenance costs from the TIF funds. A small section of the former Boston & Maine depot building was to be leased for use as a waiting area, as required by a deed restriction placed when the property was purchased from the B&M; in the 1960s. A 300-foot platform with a high-level section for handicapped access was to be built behind the station building. Like Old Orchard Beach, it would have been a seasonal stop only open from April to October, though town officials hoped it might eventually be a year-round stop. By October 2015, the station was expected to be completed by 2017 or 2018. On October 9, 2018, the Kennebunk Board of Selectmen cancelled the station project over concerns about the suitability of the site. In July 2019, the owners listed the building for sale for $939,000.

History  QuikClot was originally available as a granulate to be poured directly on a wound to stem bleeding. It absorbed the water in the blood, thus increasing its already present clotting capabilities, while also activating platelets. Later it was formulated using zeolite beads, which promoted clotting directly through activation of the coagulation cascade. One formulation is a kaolin- coated gauze which works directly to promote blood clotting by activating factor XII of the coagulation cascade.Dee KC, Puleo DA, Bizios R. Tissue- Biomaterial Interactions. Hoboken: Wiley & Sons, 2002. Currently, QuikClot products are produced using kaolin formulations. =Zeolite = The original formulation of the first generation product contained the active ingredient zeolite, which promoted blood clotting. The zeolite reaction with blood was exothermic, releasing heat during the clotting process, which could cause second degree burns.Wright J.K, Kalns J, Wolf E.A, Traweek F, Schwarz S, Loeffler C.K, ... & Eggers J (2004). Thermal injury resulting from application of a granular mineral hemostatic agent. Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, 57(2), 224-230r√©sum√© Because of this, the product was not available for retail and was only used in emergency scenarios, such as in combat. Newer zeolite formulas come pre-hydrated, which produce less heat, and can be used more safely to pack wounds and stop hemorrhage. = Kaolin = As of 2012 QuikClot devices are impregnated with kaolin, an inorganic mineral that accelerates the body's natural clotting ability, and produces no exothermic reaction. The product consists of a non-woven gauze coated in kaolin which can be applied to the region of trauma to promote clotting without an exothermic reaction. Originally sold as QuikClot Combat Gauze, the product now has a variety of packaging options available for military, law enforcement, emergency medical responders public access and hospital use. Consumer versions of the product, which use kaolin formulation, are also available at a variety of retailers.  Mechanism  Using zeolite as a clotting agent was discovered by Frank Hursey (Z-Medica co-founder) in 1984.U.S. patent number 4,822,349, 1989 Following the September 11 attacks the US armed forces conducted a series of tests comparing different antihemorrhagic technologies, in which QuikClot got the best score.\\"Application of a Zeolite Hemostatic Agent Achieves 100% Survival in a Lethal Model of Complex Groin Injury in Swine\\", J Trauma. 2004;56:974‚Äì983, Hasan B. Alam, MD\\"Comparative Analysis of Hemostatic Agents in a Swine Model of Lethal Groin Injury\\". J Trauma. 2003;54:1007‚Äì1082, Hasan B. Alam, MD Following these tests, the US armed forces approved its use in Afghanistan and Iraq. QuikClot Combat Gauze utilizes the clotting properties of kaolin to help control and stop bleeding. Kaolin works by activating factor XII, a protein factor which assists in the initiation of the coagulation cascade, a protein chain reaction which promotes blood clotting as a result of trauma. The active nature of kaolin in the promotion of this process causes it to happen much earlier on than normal, but also at a faster rate.Trabattoni D, Montorsi P, Fabbiocchi F, Lualdi A, Gatto P, Bartorelli A. \\"A new kaolin-based haemostatic bandage compared with manual compression for bleeding control after percutaneous coronary procedures\\". Eur Radiol. 2011;21:1687-1691.Politi L, Aprile A, Paganelli C, et al. \\"Randomized clinical trial on short-time compression with kaolin-filled pad: a new strategy to avoid early bleeding and subacute radial artery occlusion after percutaneous coronary intervention\\". J Interven Cardiol. 2011;24:65-72. In 2008, QuikClot Combat Gauze with kaolin was chosen by the CoTCCC (Committee on Tactical Combat Casualty Care) as the only hemostatic dressing to be used by all branches of the US military for compressible hemorrhage not amenable to tourniquet use or as an adjunct to tourniquet removal if evacuation time is anticipated to be longer than 2 hours. Today, QuikClot Combat Gauze is still the hemostatic device of choice of all branches of the military by the CoTCCC.

Kelley ( 1917‚Äì1997) was an American social worker who was the primary architect of the Federal Food Stamp Program. When she was appointed to be the director of the Division which oversaw the Food Stamp Program for the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), she became the first woman to run a national social program or lead any Division of a federal agency. She has been inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame and the USDA‚Äôs Hall of Heroes. Biography Isabelle M. Kelley was born on July 27, 1917 in Ellington, Connecticut to Hannah (n√©e O'Connell) and Thomas W. Kelley, but her family soon moved to Simsbury where she completed her secondary schooling. She enrolled in Agricultural Economics, at the University of Connecticut graduating in 1938 and went on to attain a master's degree in food economics from Iowa State University. In 1940, as soon as she graduated, Kelley began working for the USDA. She began studying trends in consumer purchasing and family nutrition. She was one of the first to understand the connection between health and cognition and pushed forward the Penny Milk Program. The program gave milk to school children for one penny and Kelley received the USDA‚Äôs Superior Honor Award for her administration of the initiative. In 1946, she helped launch the National School Lunch Program. In 1961, President Kennedy asked her to participate in a task force to investigate ending hunger and distribution of the food supply. Initially, she ran a pilot program in eight of the most poverty-effected counties in the US and studied their nutritional needs as well as the impact on local retailers of instituting a coupon-based program. The following year, the program was expanded into 18 states. The program continued under President Johnson toward a permanent government program. As part of the commission's work, she became the primary author of the Food Stamp Act of 1964. The USDA appointed her in 1964 to be the first Director of the administrative division which oversaw the program, making her the first woman who had directed a national social program or led any Division of a federal agency. Kelley retired in 1973, but continued to advise on policies and programs of the USDA. Beginning in 1974, she worked for a year and a half at the Graduate School of Georgetown University. In 1987, she was interviewed in the memoir program of Radcliffe College, as one of the thirty-eight women participants, who had been former employees of the federal government. Kelley died on November 29, 1997 in Bethesda, Maryland. In 2011, she was posthumously inducted into the Connecticut Women's Hall of Fame and that same year was brought into the USDA‚Äôs Hall of Heroes.

Gallagher Jr., also known as Maury Gallagher, is a commercial airline entrepreneur and current CEO and Chairman of Allegiant Air. Prior to Allegiant, he co-founded and invested in WestAir and ValuJet. He is also the founder of several non-aviation businesses in the telecommunications and adaptive learning fields. He is also the owner of the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series racing team GMS Racing. Gallagher is an alumnus of UC Davis where he endowed a chair in the name of him and his wife. The university also has a named hall for Gallagher, referred to as the Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr. Hall. Early life and education Gallagher attended UC Davis where he received his Bachelor of Arts in history in 1971. He went on to UC Berkeley where he received his MBA in 1974. Career =Aviation career= Gallagher was a founder of WestAir, which operated from 1978 through 1992. He served as Vice President-Finance of the parent company of WestAirCommuter Holdings, Inc. from 1979 until 1982. From 1983 until August 1992, he served as an executive and director of WestAir Holding, Inc. until the company was acquired by Mesa Air in May 1992. WestAir functioned as the west-coast commuter/regional airline affiliate of United Airlines. Gallagher also was a member of the investment group that founded ValuJet Airlines, Inc. (one of the predecessors to AirTran Airways, Inc.) and served as a board member of ValuJet from its inception in 1993 until 1997. Gallagher is known today as the CEO and Chairman of Allegiant Travel Company, and its major subsidiary, Allegiant Air. Gallagher was the major creditor of the then small, Fresno-based scheduled airline in 2000 when it declared bankruptcy. He gained control of the airline as a result of the bankruptcy and later became CEO and Chairman. The airline changed headquarters to Las Vegas and eventually changed its business model of flying older large commercial aircraft from small cities around the US to large leisure destinations (initially Las Vegas, later Orlando, Phoenix, St Petersburg, Fort Lauderdale and other cities). =Telecommunications and adaptive learning= Gallagher has been involved other entrepreneurial activities, not all of them aviation-related. For instance, in between his time at ValuJet and Allegiant, he founded and had leadership positions at Mpower Communications, a CLEC that went public in 1998. =Motorsports= Outside of airlines, he is also known for owning GMS Racing, an American professional NASCAR team that currently races in the Gander Outdoors Truck Series. Originally built in order to further extend his son Spencer's racing career in ARCA, it has since becoming one of the major teams in Truck Series and Chevrolet's current flagship Truck team, with driver Johnny Sauter winning the Truck Series championship for GMS in 2016. Philanthropy Gallagher has made two prominent donations to the UC Davis Graduate School of Management. The first was for an endowed chair in the name of him and his wife, the second was a $10 million donation which prompted the school to name its new building the Maurice J. Gallagher, Jr. Hall. In 2011, Gallagher gave the commencement address for the UC Davis business school.

Life  Hallowes was born in County Sligo, Ireland, around 1936 and moved to London in the 1950s. He was evicted from his council flat in Highgate in 1987 and then set up a makeshift camp in a corner of Hampstead Heath near Athlone House, supporting himself by doing odd jobs for locals such as the director Terry Gilliam. When property developers tried to evict him, he successfully claimed title to the land by adverse possession having lived there for over 12 years. He was awarded title to the half-acre plot of land in 2007.  Death  Hallowes died in February 2016. Hallowes left the half-acre plot to two homelessness charities (Shelter and Centrepoint) and following his death the land was auctioned. The plot sold for ¬£154,000 which was significantly less than estimates that had been speculatively reported in the press.

The building is a permanent installation and part of the museum's permanent collection. In January 2015, Kelly gifted to the Blanton Museum the design concept for a stone building that he subsequently named Austin. This work of art relates to the tradition of modernist artist- commissioned buildings that includes the Rothko Chapel, the Thanks-Giving Square Chapel of Thanksgiving, and Henri Matisse's Matisse Chapel. Kelly said that the design of the building was inspired by Romanesque and Byzantine art he studied while in Paris on the G.I. Bill. Following Kelly's gift, the Blanton launched a $15 million campaign to realize the project. The building was opened to the public February 18, 2018. A companion exhibition of Kelly's prints, sketches, and sculptures was displayed February 18 - April 29, 2018 at the Blanton to trace the evolution of four core motifs throughout his career; spectrum, black and white, color grid, and totem.  Construction and Design  Austin under construction in May, 2017; photo by Steven SaylorThe design- build team that realized the project was Overland Partners and Linbeck Group. The structure is clad with 1,569 limestone panels from Alicante, Spain. The interior stone flooring and plaza flooring is granite from Georgia, United States.

Dated to around 11,500 BP, Upward Sun River is the site of the oldest human remains discovered on the American side of Beringia. The site was first discovered in 2006. The layer with the human remains at Upward Sun River is most similar to the level 6 layer from Ushki Lake, Kamchatka. Both sites are the only Beringian burials found so far from that period. Etymology The name of the site, Upward Sun River, is a direct translation of the Middle Tanana (Athabascan languages) name for the site, Xaasaa Na‚Äô. The Middle Tanana name was recorded from the mother of a mother-daughter pair, two of the last remaining speakers of Middle Tanana, during an interview in the 1960s. Human remains The first excavation at Upward Sun River in 2010 yielded the cremated remains of a 3-year-old individual. The individual had been cremated inside a hearth, which was then filled in, with an abandonment of the site quickly afterwards. This individual was given the name Xaasaa Cheege Ts'eniin (Upward Sun River Mouth Child) by the local Healy Lake Tribe and is referred to by archaeologists as USR3. Researchers were unable to recover DNA from this individual. =Infant burials= In a 2013 excavation of the site, researchers discovered the remains of two female infants in a layer directly underneath the cremated individual. The two individuals were covered in red ochre and buried together in a pit burial with grave goods, including four decorated antler rods, two lithic dart points and bifaces. The antler rods and dart points were likely part of a weapon system. The two individuals were given the names Xach'itee'aanenh t'eede gaay (Sunrise child-girl) and Ye≈Çkaanenh t'eede gaay (Dawn twilight child-girl) by the local people and are referred to by archaeologists as USR1 and USR2, respectively. One of the individuals (USR2) was a prenatal, possibly stillborn 30-week-old fetus, while the other (USR1) was a 6- to 12-week-old infant. The prenatal individual is the only prenate and youngest Late Pleistocene individual to be recovered in the Americas. All three died during the summer. Their teeth show features most similar to those found in Native Americans and Northeast Asians. Archaeogenetics In 2015, researchers were able to extract the entire mitochondrial genome from both individuals. In 2018, researchers successfully sequenced the nuclear DNA from the petrous bone of both individuals, yielding around 17-fold coverage from USR1 and low coverage from USR2. Based on osteological analysis, the two infants were previously thought to be female; this assessment is corroborated by evidence from DNA analysis. =Comparisons with other populations= When compared with ancient populations, USR1 and USR2 show closest genetic affinity to Shuk√° K√°a from On Your Knees Cave. USR1 shows extra genetic affinity for Siberians and East Asians in a way that is not found in later ancient individuals from the Americas such as Anzick-1, Kennewick Man, or the woman from the Lucy Islands dated to around 6,000 years ago. USR1 belongs to a population that predates the hypothesized splitting of ancient Native American populations into the Northern Native American and Southern Native American branches and does not cluster genetically with either, later population. USR1 forms a distinct clade with the individual from Cave 2 of the Trail Creek Caves on the Seward Peninsula. When compared with modern populations, USR1 shows closest genetic affinity to modern Native Americans, then Siberians and East Asians. USR1 does not cluster genetically with any modern Native American population. The genetic distance from USR1 to Mal'ta boy is the same as that from modern Native American populations to Mal'ta boy. USR1 shows additional genetic affinity for Denisovans that is not matched by modern Native Americans; this additional Denisovan affinity is likely due to sampling variation from an ancient population with higher levels of heterogenous Denisovan admixture. =Kinship= Nuclear DNA analysis suggests that USR1 and USR2 are closely related, probably somewhere roughly in the range from half- siblings to first cousins. However, mtDNA analysis shows that the two infants are not maternally related. The two infants carry mtDNA lineages that are only found in the Americas. USR1, the 6- to 12-week-old infant, comes from C1b. The prenatal infant, USR2, carries a basal lineage of Haplogroup B2 that is also matched by the individual from Trial Creek Cave; this specific mtDNA lineage is different from the derived B2 lineage generally found the Americas. Both individuals represent the northernmost discovery of these mtDNA lineages and show that the mtDNA diversity in the ancient population is higher than in the modern, lending credence to the Beringia Standstill Hypothesis. =Ancient Beringian= USR1 is thought to be representative of a hypothesized ancient population referred to as Ancient Beringian. Ancient Beringian is now considered to be composed of three individuals: USR1, USR2 and the 9,000 year- old individual from Trail Creek Cave. This genetic clustering is matched by the archaeological evidence, as the Upper Sun River Site and Trail Creek Cave, despite being located over away from each other, both share similarities in artefact technology. Based on DNA analysis of USR1, the Ancient Beringians are hypothesized to have split off from East Asians around 36,000 years ago, with continuous gene flow occurring until around 25,000 years ago. The Ancient Beringians are also hypothesized to have diverged from the ancestors of Native Americans around 22,000 to 18,100 years ago. =Phenotypic analysis= Phenotypic analysis shows that USR1 does not carry the derived EDAR allele commonly found in modern East Asians and Native Americans. However, USR1 does carry the derived rs174570 FADS2 allele that was targeted by a selective sweep. Salmon Around 300 bone fragments from salmonids were recovered at Upward Sun River, representing the earliest surviving evidence of salmon eating in North America. DNA analysis types the salmon remains as coming from Oncorhynchus keta (chum salmon). Isotopic analysis shows that the salmon were anadromous. Other material remains An obsidian flake discovered as part of the grave goods found in the infant burial was chemically identified as coming from the Hoodoo Mountain primary source site in Kluane National Park, Yukon, Canada, a location away from the Upward Sun River site.

In English, it may be translated bailiff, or otherwise rendered as bailey, baili, bailie, bailli or baillie. The office of a bailo is a bailaggio (sometimes anglicised \\"bailate\\"). The term was transliterated into Greek as ŒºœÄŒ±ŒêŒøœÖŒªŒøœÇ (baioulos), but Nicephorus Gregoras translated it ·ºêœÄŒØœÑœÅŒøœÄŒøœÇ (epitropos, steward) or ·ºîœÜŒøœÅŒøœÇ (ephoros, overseer). In the Middle Ages, a bailo was a resident ambassador of the Republic of Venice. The most famous baili were those at Constantinople, who were, from 1268, the Venetian ambassadors to the Byzantine court and, after 1453, to the Ottoman government. There were also permanent baili at Negroponte, Durazzo and Corfu. Baili were also sent to represent Venetian interests at the courts of Cyprus, Acre (Jerusalem), Armenia and Trebizond. In the mid-thirteenth century, the Venetian consuls in Tyre and Tripoli in the kingdom of Acre were upgraded to the rank of bailo. Venice also sent baili to oversee its colonies at Aleppo, Antivari, Koroni, Modon, Nauplia, Patras and Tenedos. The term baiulus was first used in Venetian documents translated from Arabic in the twelfth century. It was originally used to refer to Muslim officials, but in the thirteenth century came to be applied to special envoys sent by Venice to govern its colonies in Frankish Greece. These governors doubled as diplomats. They operated courts for the Venetian colonists, collected taxes and customs dues and supervised Venetian trade. Each was assisted by a chancery (run by a chancellor) and a Council of Twelve, composed of the leading men of the colony and modeled on the Council of Ten in Venice. Each had a chaplain, a physician and an interpreter (or dragoman). Each sent back regular reports to Venice on the local politics, the affairs of the colony and, most importantly, the prices and quantities of goods in the local market. He was the superior of the consuls operating in the same country. By the end of the 15th century, the office of bailo had mostly disappeared, with those operating on foreign soil being downgraded to consuls and those governing Venetian territories being termed rectors, captains or podest√†. The bailates of Constantinople and Corfu, however, survived until the end of the republic in 1797.

Design and development The Heinkel HD 20 was one of the early products of post-World War I aircraft companies after the Allies aviation ban was lifted. HD stood for or Heinkel biplane. The HD.20 had unswept wings of mixed construction with wooden spars, two in the upper wing and one in the lower, and steel ribs; they were fabric covered. Both wings had constant chord over the inner section and semi-elliptical outer panels. The upper wing was considerably the larger, with 45% greater overall span and 17% greater chord over the inner panels. The wings were mounted with slight and equal dihedral and considerable stagger. Only the upper wings carried the long span, narrow chord ailerons. The lower wings were mounted directly onto the lower fuselage structure and the upper wing centre-section was joined to the upper fuselage with a pair of steel inverted V-struts on each side and a central parallel pair arranged transversely. It was a single bay biplane with V-form interplane struts leaning outward strongly from the lower wing below the engines to the upper wings at about 55% span. It was powered by two Wright R-790 Whirlwind nine cylinder radial engines, mounted in streamlined cowlings with the cylinder heads protruding for cooling. They were fed from fuel tanks in the upper wing; oil tanks were in the cowlings. Each engine was bolted to a frame formed of the interplane struts, a nearly horizontal V-strut to the upper fuselage and an N-form strut from the lower wing to the upper fuselage. The square cross-section fuselage was formed with steel tubes and covered with fabric, with a light, rounded, wooden upper decking. There were three open cockpits: one in the nose, another under the upper wing and the last, from which it was flown, just behind the upper trailing edge which had a shallow, rounded cut-out to aid the pilot's forward view. The tail surfaces were conventional and straight-edged, with angled leading edges and unswept trailing edges. The tailplane, mounted on the upper fuselage, was braced from below to the fuselage with a single strut on each side. Both the rudder and elevators were balanced; the latter were separate, their inner corners cut away for deflections of the deep rudder. The HD.20 had a conventional tailskid undercarriage. Each mainwheel was mounted on a group of three struts, two to the lower fuselage longeron at points on the wing leading edge and at mid- chord and the third to the upper longeron. There was a solid rubber shock absorber in each hub. The wheels could be replaced with floats. Operational history Rather little is known about the history of the HD 20. From the January 1927 date of the Les Ailles article the first flight was probably in later 1926. The number built is also not known. One (D-1157), which appears on a reconstructed civil register, was owned by the Epro advertising agency and was destroyed on 21 November 1929. The HD.20 is also mentioned as a photographic survey aircraft in a 1930 review of the topic, though it does not show the camera positions.

Eclogue I  = Title = Eclogue I is entitled Epiphunus in some editions.Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus, page 156 = Synopsis = The poem is a dialogue between two characters: Tityrus and Timetas. Tityrus is weaving a basket - Timetas encourages him to sing a song, as Pan and Apollo have given him the gift of playing on the reed pipe and singing respectively. Tityrus replies that he is old, and suggests that he has retired from music making - whereas Timetas is a renowned singer, and recently beat Mopsus in a music contest (adjudicated by Tityrus). Tityrus recounts that Timetas' skill was praised by the, now deceased, Meliboeus and incites Timetas to honour Meliboeus' spirit with music. Timetas agrees that Meliboeus deserves to be commemorated with music. He suggests a song/poem that he carved on the bark of a cherry tree. Tityrus suggests that they go to a quieter spot - among elm and beech trees. Timetas recites his poem/song. He invokes the Ether (i.e. the upper pure airKeene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus, page 161), and the spirit of Meliboeus. He grieves the death of Meliboeus, even though he died in old age. Meliboeus would adjudicate the legal disputes of countryfolk encouraged Timetas to play music, and sang himself. Apollo, Fauns, Nymphs and Muses each offer tributes to him. Even trees and herds seem to speak his name. Timetas will sing his praises until the day that seals live in meadows, lions in the sea, trees drip honey and the seasons reverse. Tityrus praises Timetas' song and suggests that it is good enough for the capital city. It is now late afternoon, and time to take the flocks to the river. = Commentary = Hubbard writes that \\"Nemesianus' First Eclogue places him in a framework of cooperative continuity with the poetic past, both honoring and honored by his predecessors in song\\".Hubbard, T.K. (1998) , The Pipes of Pan p. 178 In this regard, various scholars have identified the character of Tityrus as representing Virgil (as per ancient readings of Virgil's Eclogues and as dramatised in Calpurnius' Eclogue IV) or as representing the pastoral tradition more generally and have identified the character of Timetas as representing Nemesianus.Hubbard, T.K. (1998) , The Pipes of Pan p. 178 - referring to Schetter (1975) Nemesians Bucolica und die Anfange der spatlateinischen Dichtung 7-8 (in Gnilka, C. and Schetter, W. eds., Studien zur Literatur der Spatantike 1- 43) and Walter (1988) Studien zur Hirtendichtung Nemesians, 29-31. Hubbard concludes that \\"Although intermixed with some Calpurnian references, the primary models for the characters and situation of Nem.1 are clearly Vergilian\\".Hubbard, T.K. (1998) , The Pipes of Pan p. 182 According to the Oxford Classical Dictionary,Hornblower, S. and Spawforth, A. (eds) (1996), the Oxford Classical Dictionary, 3rd ed. p 1033 the threnody on Meliboeus recalls the praises of Daphnis in Virgil's Eclogue V.  Eclogue II  = Title = Eclogue II is entitled Donace in some editions.Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus, page 168 = Synopsis = Two 15 year old boys, Idas and Alcon both have sex with a girl called Donace. Donace becomes pregnant and her parents imprison her. Idas and Alcon convene under a plane tree and sing/play music about her. Idas' song invokes the Dryads and Napaean Nymphs and Naiads. The song claims that Idas has been waiting in caves for Donace for three days. Whilst Idas waits for her, his cows do not eat or produce milk, and Idas has stopped making baskets for curdling milk. The song boasts of the size of Idas' herd and milk production and sings of how Donace used to kiss Idas while he played his pipe. In the song, Idas asks for Donace's pity, as he has turned pale and will not eat or drink wine and explains that without Donace, flowers have lost their colour and laurel its fragrance. Idas claims to love only Donace. The narrator then introduces Alcon's response. Alcon invokes Pales, Apollo, Silvanus and Venus. He bemoans his desertion by Donace. He tells of how he would bring her gifts (unlike Idas), such as a nightingale, a hare and wood pigeons. In case Donace thinks that it is shameful that he is a rustic oxherd, he points out that gods such as Apollo, Pan, Fauns and Adonis feed herds of cattle. He refers to his youthful beauty and musical skill. The boys thus sing until evening, when they have to leave the woods and take their bulls to their stables. = Commentary = Karakasis considers that an \\"intermingling of long-established pastoral features with elegiac dispositions is to be read throughout this poem\\" and that \\"both characters .... prove, by means of their song performance, unable to overcome their elegiac passion, despite their pastoral identity\\".Karakasis, E (2011) Song Exchange in Roman Pastoral p 297 The poem begins with a description of what Heyworth describes as \\"a disturbingly casual description of a double rape\\".Pastoral, Heyworth, S in A Companion to Latin Literature, S. Harrison ed. (2005), p. 156 Hubbard notes that \\"the verb invasere (Nem 2.6) often used as a term of military attack, can in this context only denote forcible rape\\".Hubbard, T.K. (1998) , The Pipes of Pan pp. 183 fn. 68 However, Keene (writing in the late 19th century) describes Donace as the mistress of Idas and Alcon and as being \\"of more than doubtful character\\".Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus p 17 and 168. Karakasis notes that \\"any sexual intercourse with a maiden may be described in Roman literature as rape, irrespective of whether or not the puella regards it so\\", but also that \\"Donace's reactions... are not recorded for, as often happens in ancient literature, sexual pleasure is seen from the male perspective\\".Karakasis, E (2011) Song Exchange in Roman Pastoral p.299 fn 10 McGill notes that verses 37 - 39, which (apart from the first four words of v. 37) repeat verbatim verses 56 - 58 of Calpurnius Eclogue III is a \\"striking exception to the rule\\" that \\"rarely does an imitating poet reproduce an entire line of a model\\".McGill, S. (2005) Virgil Recomposed. The Mythological and Secular Centos in Antiquity, p 174 fn 130. Hubbard notes that, whilst many scholars criticise Nemesianus for his unoriginal overuse of quotations from various literary sources, his use of such sources (in Eclogue II, in particular) is more selective and that this \\"technique of multiple allusion diminishes Virgil's role from dominant and overpowering father figure to one of a series of models....\\"Hubbard, T.K. (1998) , The Pipes of Pan pp. 195f Conte considers this poem to be an evident example of Nemesianus' originality of approach: \\"although the models are present, in the overall structure...or in various episodes or in expressions and nexus that contain exact verbal repetitions...one is bound to be aware of a new sensibility and attitude\\".Conte, G.B. (trans Solodow) (1987) Latin Literature a History p 614. Karakasis considers that, the fact that the boys convene under the shade of a plane tree (like in Calpurnius Eclogue IV.2), rather than a pine tree (as in Theocritean pastoral poetry), beech tree (as in Virgilian pastoral poetry) or under a generic collection of trees suggests \\"the extended accumulated pastoral tradition Nemesianus is working with...\\"Karakasis, E (2011) Song Exchange in Roman Pastoral p 303 Although it is editorial conventionSee, for example Duff, J.W. and Duff , A.M. (1934) Minor Latin Poets (Vol 2) p 466 - 469 and Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus p 170 and 174 to mark the first song as \\"sung\\" by Idas, and the second by Alcon, Idas is described as playing his song on the reed pipes/flute, whereas only Alcon is described as actually singing (verses 53 - 54). Hubbard concludes that this must mean that \\"Alcon sings both songs, whilst Idas plays the instrumental accompaniment\\".Hubbard, T.K. The Pipes of Pan (1998) p 183 Karakasis notes that \\"In opposition to the Vergilian fifth eclogue, where the initial distinction between song and flute-playing is not kept, Nemesianus' pastoral characters remain faithful to their initial allotment of tasks\\".Karakasis, E (2011) Song Exchange in Roman Pastoral p 313  Eclogue III  = Title = Eclogue III is entitled Pan in some editions, and Bacchus in some other editions.Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus, page 178 = Synopsis = Pan is sleeping under an elm tree. Three youths, Nyctilus, Micon and Amyntas, steal Pan's pipe and try to play it. The pipe makes a dissonant noise, waking Pan. Pan tells them that no one can play his pipes, but offers to sing a song about the birth of Bacchus. Pan invokes Bacchus. Pan refers to Bacchus' gestation by Jupiter and how, as a baby and child he was cared for by nymphs, fauns, satyrs and, in particular, by Silenus. Pan describes how, as Bacchus grew older, he grew full horns and encouraged the Satyrs to pick and tread grapes. He describes how the Satyrs got drunk on the wine and chased after nymphs lustfully, and how Silenus also drank much wine. Pan explains how, ever since, Bacchus makes wine, and Pan refers to Bacchus' cultic associations - the thyrsus and lynx. Pan's song ends - it is night, so the youths drive their sheep back and attend to milking and cheese-making. = Commentary = Eclogue III is modeled on Virgil's Eclogue VI (in which Silenus is caught sleeping, wakes and recites a poem)Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus p 178; Duff, J.W. and Duff , A.M. (1934) Minor Latin Poets (Vol 2) p 452; Hubbard, T.K. (1998), The Pipes of Pan p.206 which, as Hubbard notes, does not seem to have been adopted as a model by other post-Virgilian Latin poets. According to Keene \\"Wernsdorf mentions several extant gems, the carvings of which illustrate the various scenes described in this Eclogue\\"Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus p. 178 and Hubbard considers that Nemesianus has enriched this poem with references from contemporary iconography.Thomas K. Hubbard, The Pipes of Pan (Ann Arbor 1998) p. 206 Hubbard concludes that \\"the end result is a parody of Silenus' ambitious song of the cosmos in Vergil, but perhaps also a significant reading of that song as itself a parody of epic forms\\".Hubbard, T.K. (1998) , The Pipes of Pan p 206 Heyworth notes that Pan's song is \\"not a cosmological catalogue poem [like Silenus' song in Virgil's Eclogue VI], but a hymn to Bacchus of a markedly didactic nature.\\"Pastoral, Heyworth, S in A Companion to Latin Literature, S. Harrison ed. (2005), p. 156  Eclogue IV  = Title = Eclogue IV is entitled Eros in some editions.Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus, page 188. = Structure = Eclogue IV is written in hexameters. It is 73 lines long. After a 13 line narrative introduction, the two characters (Mopsus and Lycidas) take turns in reciting alternating 5 verse stanzas. After each such stanza, there follows a one line refrain: cantet, amat quod quisque: levant et carmina curas (\\"Let each sing of what he loves: song too relieves love's pangs\\"translation: Duff, J.W. and Duff , A.M. (1934) Minor Latin Poets (Vol 2) - Loeb Classical Library p 479ff). = Synopsis = Two herdsmen, Lycidas and Mopsus convene under the shade of a poplar. Mopsus loves a girl called Meroe and Lycidas loves a boy called Iollas. However both Meroe and Iollas mock their suitors and keep standing them up and avoiding them. Lycidas and Mopsus sing about their unrequited loves. Mopsus starts by asking why Meroe is avoiding him and his music - and asks her to turn him down directly. Lycidas asks Iollas to pay attention to him, and warns that youthful beauty is short- lived. Mopsus points out how even animals feel love: yet Meroe flees from it. Lycidas ponders upon the passage of time - and that Iollas is already 20 years old. Mopsus asks Meroe to come and rest with him in the shade: even all the animals are taking a break. Lycidas tells Iollas not to get sunburn; but to rest with him in the shade. Mopsus sings of the extreme endurance of any man who suffers Meroe's disdain. Lycidas warns other men who love boys to toughen up and have patience - in the hope that one day a god will grant them success. Mopsus ponders upon the pointlessness of undergoing certain rituals, if he still burns with unrequited love. Lycidas explains that, even though a witch called Mycale cast spells for him, he still thinks Iollas is beautiful. = Commentary = Karakasis notes that this poem \\"can also be integrated into the established pattern of a 'generic interaction' between pastoral and elegy\\".Karakasis, E (2011) Song Exchange in Roman Pastoral p 324 Karakasis notes that the locations that Meroe and Iollas shun (such as groves springs and caves) \\"are strongly associated with the bucolic genre, to the extent of occasionally standing in as its meta-linguistic symbols as well\\" and that \\"Meroe's and Iollas' avoidance of all these generic consituents of pastoral may also be read as a certain willingness for transcending 'traditional pastoral' towards other 'generic directions'\\".Karakasis, E (2011) Song Exchange in Roman Pastoral p 324 - 325. Hubbard focuses upon how, in Eclogue IV, Mopsus has exclusively heterosexual, and Lycidas has exclusively homosexual inclinations: contrasting this with the \\"framework of a generalized bisexuality\\" that is found in much preceding pastoral poetry. He explains that the \\"unique polarization of sexual object choice may owe something to the evolution of social attitudes in the second and third centuries A.D.\\"Hubbard, T.K. (1998) , The Pipes of Pan p. 196 Hubbard notes the absence of a closing narrative, after Mopsus and Lycidas' final song exchange. He likens this to Virgil's Eclogues II and VIII and notes that \\"the effect is again one of open- ended doubt and ambiguity\\".Hubbard, T.K. (1998) , The Pipes of Pan p. 206 This lack of closure leads Heyworth to comment that \\"the pastoral collection is either unfinished or fragmentary\\".Pastoral, Heyworth, S in A Companion to Latin Literature, S. Harrison ed. (2005), p. 157  Transmission and attribution to Nemesianus  The Eclogues of Nemesianus have come down to us through the manuscript tradition, together with the seven Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus, as a single collection of 11 Eclogues. In her survey of extant ancient/medieval sources of the Eclogues, Williams identifies 30 manuscripts and 7 anthologies.Williams, H.J. (1986) Eclogues and Cynegetica of Nemesianus pp 9 - 24. Williams is also of the view that the extant manuscripts all derive from a single common archetype - as evidenced by certain common corruptions.Williams, H.J. (1986) Eclogues and Cynegetica of Nemesianus p 27. Each of the surviving manuscripts bears the name of Calpurnius Siculus alone. However, since at least the late fifteenth century edition of Angelus Ugoletus,See Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus p 19 and Duff, J.W. (1927, 3rd ed 1964) A Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age p 204. See also Williams, H.J. (1986) Eclogues and Cynegetica of Nemesianus p 3. the first seven poems in the manuscripts are usually attributed to Calpurnius Siculus, and the last four are attributed to Nemesianus, on the basis of certain lost manuscript comments,Keene, C.H. (1887) The Eclogues of Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus p 19 - 20. and on the basis of stylistic evidence. The stylistic evidence for attributing the last four poems to the later Nemesianus includes: * the more frequent use of elision in the last four poems; * the more frequent use of unclassical shortenings of the final \\"o\\" of words, in the last four poems; * more general metrical differences between the first seven and last four poems;Duckworth, G.E. (1967) TAPA 98, p 78-88. * the use of parenthetic insertions of \\"memimi\\" and \\"fateor\\" in the first seven poems only; * the allusions to the emperor in certain of the first seven poems (I, IV and VII), but not in the last four poems; * References and allusions to the first seven poems in the last four poems (suggesting that the poet of the last four poems is self-consciously alluding to the other); and * Stylistic similarities between the last four poems and the Cynegetica of Nemesianus.See Keene, C.H. (1887) Calpurnius Siculus and M. Aurelius Olympius Nemesianus, p. 14, Mills, T.R. (1896) The Student‚Äôs Companion to Latin Authors p 276, Duff, J.W. (1927, 3rd ed 1964) A Literary History of Rome in the Silver Age p 204. Radke has argued to the contrary: that the Eclogues all were written by the same poet, citing - among other things the lack of scribal errors that might be indicative of two different manuscript traditions. Radke's arguments were challenged by Williams.Williams, H.J. (1986) Eclogues and Cynegetica of Nemesianus p 3ff, citing Radke, A.E. (1972) Hermes 100, 615-23.

Camel hair is not a suitable material, although historically camel was used for ancient Chinese ink brushes (and for camel hair cloth). It is a widely used brush in art, but is considered inferior to the more expensive sable and ox-hair brushes. In some niche applications, such as pinstriping, camel hair is an ideal brush. Camel-hair brushes have numerous uses outside of art, particularly dusting where a soft brush is needed for delicate objects or skin. Construction and properties The bristles of camel-hair brushes are traditionally made of squirrel hair and this is still the most common material. They can also be made from goat, ox or pony or a blend of any of these.Brush Hair Types, Dick Blick Art Materials, accessed and archived 1 November 2015. They are never made from camel hair, either in whole or in part.Helen D. Hume, The Art Teacher's Book of Lists, 6.2.3 \\"Brushes\\", John Wiley & Sons, 2010 . Camel-hair brushes are a soft brush. They are a considerably cheaper alternative to the expensive kolinsky sable-hair brush (a red sable), considered the best brush for watercolour painting. However, they are inferior in that they lack the springiness and natural point of red sable.Chuck Long, Watercolor Success!: 52 Essential Lessons for Creating Great Paintings, p. 14, North Light Books, 2005 . Cheaper camel-hair brushes, such as those supplied to schools, are usually mass-produced from pony hair cut from the mane. Pony is used because the long mane hairs can be cut up by machine to make many brushes simultaneously. However, the cut ends are not so good at coming to a point as the natural tips.Choosing the Proper Brush, Rex Art, accessed and archived 1 November 2015 History Camel-hair brushes with fine points for tracing, from a 1914 art supplies catalogue There is an often repeated urban legend that camel-hair brushes are so named because they were invented by a \\"Mr. Camel\\". This is almost certainly not true. This person, or his company, has never been identified. The story is very old, at least as far back as 1922 when it was mentioned in Marvels of the Animal World.Walter Sydney Berridge, Marvels of the Animal World, p. 147, Boston: Small, Maynard & Co., 1922 The alternative explanation that brushes were once actually made of camel hair is true, but these would be a very different brush and would not be considered a camel-hair brush in modern terminology. Camel hair is wooly, making it unsuitable for the uses to which camel-hair brushes are put.Robert Anwood, Bears Can't Run Downhill: And 200 Other Dubious Pub Facts Explained, p. 134, Random House, 2006 In 250 BC, the Chinese general Meng Tian invented the ink brush. Meng Tian is perhaps better known for supervising the construction of the Great Wall of China. Meng Tian's brush consisted of actual camel hair, or sometimes rabbit hair, lashed to a wooden handle with twine. This brush was a great step forward in writing. Writing became much easier and the spread of calligraphy in China created the need for a cheaper and more plentiful medium to write on. This came in 105 AD with the invention of paper which in turn paved the way for the invention of printing.Dard Hunter, Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft, p. 4, Courier Corporation, 1978 (first published 1945) . Applications Camel-hair dusters from an 1894 art supplies catalogue Camel-hair brushes can be used for watercolour painting but are not the best choice.Jan Fabian Wallake, \\"Brush tips\\", p. 10, in, Gina Rath (ed), The Watercolorist's Answer Book, pp. 10‚Äì11, North Light Books, 2005 . They are poor where good points are required, and do not hold their shape well when in contact with water. They are, however, good for large flat brushes when broad areas are being painted. Camel-hair brushes are used in signwriting. They are problematic with watercolours as already stated. They also do not perform well with heavy paints, especially the formerly widely used white lead based paints. The weight of the paint tends to make the brush collapse.Charles Jay Strong, Lawrence J. Strong, The Art of Show Card Writing, p. 194, Chicago: Frederick J. Drake, 1922 Pinstriping is the application of thin decorative lines to an object. This can range from simple coachlines down the side of motor cars, to elaborate decoration of furniture. Pinstriping brushes are traditionally camel-hair brushes. These are sometimes called striping pencils and are small brushes with very long bristles. The idea of the length is to hold a greater amount of paint so that very long lines can be painted in one stroke. Pinstripers originally made their own brushes (and sometimes still do) from the bristles of a larger camel-hair brush, but dedicated brushes are now available. One of the earliest such brushes was designed by Andrew Mack in 1891, a carriage striper for the J.J. Deal wagon and buggy company in Jonesville, Michigan. Mack was dissatisfied with the brushes supplied by the Deal company and made his own. These became so popular with other pinstripers around the country that he left Deal to set up his own company, the Mack Brush Company, which still makes highly regarded pinstriping brushes in Michigan.Alan Johnson, How to Pinstripe, p. 20, MotorBooks International The Mack Story, Andrew Mack Brush Company, accessed and archived 1 November 2015. Woodworking has many uses for camel-hair brushes. As with watercolouring, fine work is better done with a sable brush but camel-hair can be used for applying finishes. Camel hair is also less effective at working into corners or to a line because of the poorer point (or edge) on the tip.Bernard E. Jones (ed), The Practical Woodworker: Volume 4, Decorative Woodwork, p. 1509,F+W Media 2014 . The brushes barbers use to remove the loose hairs from the back of the customer's neck can be camel hair.Perinton Historical Society, Perinton and Fairport in the 20th Century, p. 58, Arcadia Publishing, 2004 . They are also the preferred brushes for surgeons, dentists, and jewellers.Paint, Oil and Drug Review, p. 16, vol. 52, D. Van Ness Publishing, 1911. Their soft bristles make them ideal for cleaning dust from delicate equipment or materials, such as film or stills cameras.Bruce Mamer, Film Production Technique: Creating the Accomplished Image, p. 115, Cengage Learning, 2008 .

Life Frances Willard Cranmer was born on June 28, 1890 in a log cabin in Aberdeen, South Dakota. Her parents were Hon. Simeon Harris Cranmer, and the suffragist, Emma Amelia Cranmer. She was named for suffragist Frances Willard. At 15, she attended the Wisconsin Academy of Art. At 16, she attended the Corcoran School of Art in Washington, DC. In the 1900s, she studied with William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri in New York City. She won a gold medal from Corcoran in 1908. She moved to Minneapolis in the 1910s. She had her first major exhibition in 1913 at the Handicraft Guild. She went back to New York for several years before settling at the Hampshire Arms Hotel. Her permanent studio was on the fifth floor of the building and was painted completely black for her portraiture. She was awarded a gold medal at the 1915 Minnesota State Fair for a group of three portraits. Greenman was an established society painter in Minneapolis by the early 1920s and made portraits for Hollywood stars, politicians and socialites. Her 1921 exhibition at the Bradstreet Gallery in Minneapolis was described in American Art News as \\"alternately gay and serious, prismatic and tonal.\\" Greenman was awarded first prize in painting at the seventh and eighth annual exhibitions of Twin City Artists. Her portrait Jane won the prize for the eighth exhibition in 1922. Greenman was replaced as a judge during the 1925 Iowa State Fair's Art Salon due to her modernist inclinations. Painter and exhibit head Charles Atherton Cumming postponed the art judging, first claiming that Greenman was ill. Greenman herself disputed this and Cumming went on to describe how she had been \\"converted to what she calls 'modern' art since I last viewed her exhibit.\\" He explained that Iowa artists were \\"followers of 'white man's art'\\" and Greenman was replaced by one J. Laurie Wallace. Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, Greenman left New York and supported her family by painting portraits for wealthy clients. Greenman taught at the Minneapolis School of Art from 1941 to 1943. She also taught at the Art Institute of Chicago. Her style was bold and informed by modernism. Her painting Pink Lotus depicted one David Painter and in a severe, flattened, and unflattering manner. While her earlier portraits were more adventurous, they became more conservative and conventional over time. Her 1922 work A Moment's Rest for Mrs. Hoscovics and her portraits of Polish immigrants in Wisconsin show that Greenman wanted to use her art to explore social issues. Greenman painted portraits of many famous people, including conductor Emil Oberhoffer, Dolores del R√≠o, and Mary Pickford. She painted the official governor's portrait of Karl Rolvaag. It is hung in the Minnesota State Capitol. She wrote her autobiography, Higher Than the Sky in 1954. She also worked for the Minneapolis Sunday Tribune as a critic, writing the art column \\"Frances Greenman Says\\". Greenman died in Medina, Minnesota on May 24, 1981.

Dengis worked as a seaman until his emigration to the United States in 1926; he settled in Baltimore, Maryland, where he became a steel mill worker. Later, he worked as a toolmaker and airplane mechanic for the Glenn L. Martin Company, a job he held until his death. Dengis took up running in Baltimore; he placed fifth at the Port Chester Marathon in 1932 and fourth in 1933 before scoring his first victory in 1934. In 1935 he placed second behind John A. Kelley at the Boston Marathon (2:34:11.2) and won the AAU national championship marathon in Washington in 2:53:53. After gaining US citizenship in October 1935, Dengis entered 1936 as one of the leading candidates to qualify for the American Olympic team, but in both of the Olympic tryout races (the 1936 Boston Marathon and the 1936 AAU championship marathon) he suffered from medical problems; he failed to finish in Boston, and dropped from the lead to eighth place in the AAU race. Dengis won the marathon at the 1937 Pan American Games in Dallas, defeating Jos√© Ribas in 2:42:43. In 1938 he won the Salisbury Beach Marathon in 2:30:27.6, the fastest time in the world that year; he also regained his AAU championship title by winning the Yonkers Marathon.

It is about 1,000 km north of the Caspian Sea, in Saratov Oblast overlooking the Saratov Reservoir. The northern end is about 10 km west of the city of Khvalynsk, and about 200 km northeast of Saratov on the Volga. About in size, Khvalynsky is spread over three sections. The park was officially formed in 1994. Topography The park centers on the Khvalanskyaya ridge, a raised plateau that stretches along the west bank of the Volga River (referred to as the 'Right Bank'). Because the bedrock is primarily chalk and marl, the landform reflects extensive erosion out from the center of the ridge, with undulating and hilly terrain and numerous interconnected ravines and gullies. The varied landforms create many micro- climates and habitats. The highest mountain (Belenkaya, almost entirely of chalk) is 369 meters in altitude, and there are five other mountains over 250 meters in height. The mountains in the park are mostly covered with upland forest trees. The Volga reaches its greatest depths (22 meters) in the territory of the park. Over 90% of the park is forest land. There are numerous outcrops of exposed bedrock, and underground water that frequently comes to the surface in springs. Habitats include pine and watershed forests, small rivers and hollows, and various types of forest edge and steppe. Chalk hills in Khvalysky National Park Ecoregon and climate Khvalysky is in the Pontic‚ÄìCaspian steppe ecoregion, a band of grasslands and occasional forest that stretches from the middle of Ukraine to the Ural Mountains. The climate of Kvalynsky is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Winters last from late November to early April, with an average of 33 cm of snow. Animals Because Khvalynsky borders many ecological zones - forest, semi-arid steppe, the Volga, mountain, meadows, and stream valleys - it has a complex variety of habitats. These varied habitats supports a large number of different plants and animals, many of which are rare or endangered. Small mammals are common, including hares, beavers, foxes, and wolves. Among reptiles are the common European adder (vipera berus), and indicator of complex habitat. Predatory birds include White-tailed Eagles, Ospreys, and the endangered Saker Falcon. Plants The forest-forming trees are predominantly oak (40%), linden (30%) and pine (21%), with many lesser species, including remnants of orchards on some of the edge slopes. Over 970 different vascular plants have been identified in the park, 26 of which are rare or endangered (there is a list on the official website of the park. Tourism Public use is encouraged, with the park generally zoned into protected, recreational, and commercial. Environmental paths are laid out to visit some of the highlights, including the \\"Puteshestvie po Dnu Drevnego Morya\\" (Travel on the Bottom of an Ancient Sea) which highlights the geology of the area. Another path leads to the Peshchera Monakha (Monk's Cave). There is a museum of everyday peasant life, \\"Derevenskoe Podvorye‚Äù (‚ÄúVillage Farmstead‚Äù), a chapel and sacred springs. Cars are not permitted in the protected zone. Accommodations in a family-oriented guesthouse are available by prior reservation, or in the nearby town of Khvalynsk. About 30-35 thousand people visit the park every year. Representative animals of the park can be seen in a captive farm (zoo) in the park, and by prior arrangement visitors can experience a \\"Khvalinskoe safari\\" in the park itself. There is a ski resort on the edge of the park, and resort hotels. In the town of Khalynsk to the northeast of the park is a local history museum.

From the south, it is accessible only via Rock Creek Road, or via the ‚ÄúSwinging Bridge‚Äù over the American River canyon on Mosquito Road. Demographics Swansboro is a community of over 200 homes on multi- acre lots  History  After the discovery of gold at Sutter's Mill in nearby Coloma, California, by James W. Marshall in 1848 sparked the California Gold Rush, gold mines were discovered in Mosquito Canyon. Most of the mining population settled in two different places, one being called Nelsonville and the other Lowertown or Big House. Ben Summerfield and John Bennett on One Eye Creek built a sawmill in 1851. In 1853, the existing name of Mosquito was given to the area. In 1854, the Mosquito voting precinct was established and also an irrigation ditch taking water from Slab Creek was built by the Mosquito Ditch Company, owned by James Summerfield at a cost of $20,000. In 1859, a road was ordered built by the County Board of Supervisors from Placerville to Mosquito Village. In 1862, the Mosquito School was started. In 1867, the ‚ÄúSwinging Bridge‚Äù was built on Mosquito Road, now a County Historical Landmark. The cables were made by Hiram Tipton, an Englishman, at a site near the bridge. In 1882, the Mosquito School District was established, and the Mosquito Post Office was started. In 1905, the Swansborough family bought the Dickenson property, where the Post Office had been. The American River Electric Company brought up water for the AREC power house on the American River just below the community of Mosquito. In 1907, Finnon Lake was completed and later became a state owned, county leased recreation area run by a private concessionaire. Between 1911 and 1915, a telephone line was constructed between Placerville and Mosquito. Mosquito was also one of the first areas in El Dorado County to have electric power. In 1926, the present Swansborough house was built on the location of the one purchased from the Dickensons which burned in 1924. In 1934, a large Civilian Conservation Corps was established at Mosquito with 200 or more boys at a time. It was operated by the U.S. Army and the U.S. Forest Service. During World War II, the camp housed conscientious objectors who acted as forest service fire crews, without pay, during the fire seasons. From 1943 through the 1960s, a large sawmill operated in Mosquito and logs were brought from as far away as Bishop, California. After World War II, Frank Andre - the legendary ‚ÄúGoat Doctor‚Äù faith healer- lived here until he passed away in 1957. People came from all over the United States for his healing touch. In 1968, the Swansboro subdivision was started with property purchased from the Swansborough, Darr, Morton, and Lawyer families. This was the first rural subdivision in El Dorado County. Nearby downtown Placerville was a central hub for the Mother Lode region's mining operations. The town had many services, including transportation (of people and goods), lodging, banking, and had a market and general store. The history of hard-rock mining is evidenced by an open and accessible Gold Bug Park & Mine, now a museum with tours and books.Hangtown's Gold Bug Park & Mine.

Among his works was Nouvelles de la r√©publique des lettres.  Career  Henri Desbordes was one of the most successful refugee booksellers in Saumur serving the theology students of his neighboring Protestant academy as well as ministers. In 1682 suspicion arose of him of having printed the anti- catholic Preservatif contre le changement de religion (A Preservation against the Change of Religion), which was written by Pierre Jurieu, and the authorities send him to prison. Desbordes moved to Amsterdam after his release where in July 1682 he became a member of Amsterdam's Walloon church. Apart from religious coercion, according to sources, he may have resettled in Amsterdam because he wished to open a shop abroad as at that time he possessed enough funds to do so. The shop he subsequently opened was situated in the commercial Kalverstraat. Among others, Nouvelles de la r√©publique des lettres was one of the journals he published there. Beside printing more than 100 publications and selling books, Desbordes was also involved in conducting auctions.  Personal life  Jaques Desbordes was the nephew of Henri Desbordes.

The cornerstone was laid by president of the United States George Washington, assisted by the Grand Master of Maryland Joseph Clark, in a Masonic ritual. Many of the items of ritual paraphernalia used in the cornerstone ceremony have been repurposed and are currently used for the placement of foundation stones at other important buildings in the greater Washington area. Centennial and bicentennial observances of the U.S. Capitol cornerstone laying were held in 1893 and 1993, respectively, and a tricentennial observance of the ritual has been announced for 2093. Background Workers began excavating the foundations of the United States Capitol in July 1793. During construction of the foundation, building commissioner David Stuart wrote to other members of the capitol commission suggesting a cornerstone ceremony be held. At their September 2 meeting, the commission agreed with Stuart, setting a date for the ceremony a little more than two weeks later. The procession to the Capitol. Ceremony At 10:00 a.m. on September 18, President of the United States George Washington and his entourage crossed the Potomac River to arrive in the city of Washington. There, they were joined by an escort consisting of the Alexandria Volunteer Artillery, and members of Masonic lodges from Virginia and Maryland, and proceeded to the construction grounds approximately away. At the site of the Capitol, Washington was received by Joseph Clark, the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Maryland. A silver plaque, fashioned by Georgetown silversmith Caleb Bentley, was handed to Washington, who stepped into the foundation trench and placed the plaque, whereupon the cornerstone was lowered. The plaque was inscribed with a brief tribute to the \\"military valor and prudence\\" of Washington, and dedicated the building in the \\"first year, of the second term, of the presidency of George Washington ... and in the year of Masonry 5,793.\\" Washington laying the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol in a photo reproduction of a painting. Washington, accompanied by three Worshipful Masters carrying sacrifices of corn, wine, and oil, then struck the stone three times with a gavel, as prescribed by Masonic custom. Washington exited the trench to ritual chanting by the assembled Masons and a 15-gun salute (one gun for each U.S. state) from the Alexandria Volunteer Artillery. Clark then delivered a short invocation, after which a ox was slaughtered and roasted. Subsequent history =Artifacts= The apron and sash worn by Washington during the cornerstone laying were, according to popular belief, embroidered several years earlier by the Marquise de La Fayette and gifted to Washington. Contemporary research indicates this may not be the case. The apron is currently owned by the Masonic Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania. The trowel used by Washington during the ceremony is on display at the United States Capitol Visitor Center. Since the cornerstone laying, it has occasionally been used in other Masonic cornerstone ceremonies for important buildings in the Washington metropolitan area, including the Herbert Hoover Building, the chancery of the British embassy, the Thomas Jefferson Memorial, the Washington Monument, and the National Cathedral. The Right Rev. James E. Freeman, Bishop of Washington, lays the cornerstone to the National Cathedral with the Washington gavel in 1929. The gavel used to ceremonially strike the cornerstone three times was given by Washington to Valentine Reintzel, the Worshipful Master of Lodge 9 of Maryland, now Potomac Lodge No.5. After Reintzel's death in 1817, the gavel was donated to the lodge by his family. The lodge kept the gavel at its meeting place until 1922 when it was placed in the vault of Riggs National Bank, now a branch of PNC Bank, where it remains today. It has occasionally been removed for important Masonic cornerstone ceremonies, including that of the National Cathedral and the Washington Monument. Left: George White gestures at the cornerstone at an open excavation site in 1993. Right: The cornerstone to which White is pointing. The precise location of the cornerstone was lost during the two centuries following the ceremony due to attack and multiple expansions of the original building. In 1993, Architect of the Capitol George White, following a protracted search involving the use of ground-penetrating radar, electromagnetic induction and induced polarization, announced he had found a large stone buried beneath one section of the foundation that was \\"obviously a ceremonial stone,\\" and declared it was probably the cornerstone of the building. No sign of the original silver plaque was discovered, and experts believe it may have been dislodged and destroyed during the 1850 construction of the Senate chambers. =Centennial, bicentennial, and tricentennial observances= A centennial rededication of the Capitol, roughly modeled after the cornerstone ceremony of 1793, was organized on September 18, 1893. The pre-ceremonial parade proceeded along the same route followed by Washington's entourage in 1793 and was led by President Grover Cleveland, who rode in the presidential state coach accompanied by a squadron of United States Army cavalry. The president was followed by a ceremonial escort formed into four divisions. The first division consisted of delegations from Masonic lodges and friendly societies. The second division was formed of contingents from lineage societies, including the Society of the Cincinnati, the Sons of the Revolution, and the Aztec Club of 1847. The third division included federal military forces, including units from the U.S. Army 3rd Field Artillery Regiment and the District of Columbia National Guard. The fourth division consisted of local fire brigades. At the capitol, the United States Marine Band provided music, accompanied by a 1,500-person choir. Opening remarks were delivered by Cleveland, followed by a two-hour speech by William Wirt Henry, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and Patrick Henry's grandson. According to news reports of the day, 150,000 spectators attended the event. Prince Hall lodges arrive at the U.S. Capitol for the bicentennial of the cornerstone laying in 1993. A more modest bicentennial rededication occurred on September 18, 1993, organized by Architect of the Capitol George White. (After his appointment as Architect of the Capitol, White had been made a Mason-at-Sight, a rarely used mode of initiation in which a Grand Master instantly raises a non-Mason to the degree of Master Mason.) The 1993 ceremony was attended by the Grand Masters of each of the 50 grand lodges in the United States. At the time, White announced a tricentennial observance to occur on Friday, September 18, 2093. =Depictions= * During the bicentennial of the cornerstone laying, John Melius, a former historical artist with the Smithsonian Institution, was commissioned by the Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite to paint an accurate representation of the ceremony. The oil-on- canvas painting currently hangs at the seat of the Supreme Council at the House of the Temple. * On the side of the Washington Masonic National Memorial is a mural by Allyn Cox depicting Washington laying the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol. * A different mural in the chambers of the U.S. House of Representatives, also painted by Cox, depicts the cornerstone ceremony.

It was built by order of Napoleon Bonaparte on the remains of the ancient promontory Icius Ptolemy (by the sea facing the town of le Portel) after the breaking of the Treaty of Amiens by the British en May 1803. This mass of rocks that once formed a small island near Equihen went, according to a former British map, by the name of Heustri√®re (which means Oyster Island). That name would have become, over time, first Heustre then Heurt. Work on the fort, directed by Captain of Engineers of Gouville, began 24 May 1803. The plans were signed by the Director of the fortifications Guillaume Dode of Brunerie who would become a Marshal under Louis Philippe I. During construction, a second fort, a copy of the Fort de l'Heurt, was also built at Wimereux. It was called the Fort de la Cr√®che. Napoleon's letters often talk on the work of advancing the \\"forts of l'Heurt and of the Cr√®che.\\" Of the latter there is nothing left, except the foundations are visible in some places to the discerning eye. The Fort de la Cr√®che resisted very bad storms because on the drawings of Mr. Vaillant (in the Boulogne Library) they show that in 1870 it was already almost irreparable, while on other sketches by the same painter dating from 1870, Fort de l'Heurt appears whole and undamaged. (warning, another fort is also called Fort of the Cr√®che, which, more recent, dates from the 1870s. An association has restored it gradually to its original appearance). After much damage due to storms and relentless attacks of the British, the fort was finally operational on 16 July 1804. It was then intended to protect the southern anchorage of the fleet at the :fr:Camp de Boulogne; its twin fort was at the Pointe de la Creche. The Fort of l'Heurt, sea moorings The outer shell of the fort is made of hewn stone from the quarries of Ainghem and of Wimille, blocks of a size of 1.90m √ó 1.30m √ó 0.40m. The stones that still exist today are masonry rubble bound with mortar cement or lime. You can get into the inside of the fort through a door with the aid of a ladder and then to the upper platform by a circular staircase that one finds in the tower.

In the center of the platform were three mortars of 12 inches. During the Second World War the Germans placed there a concrete slab in order to install an anti aircraft battery (DCA).

The company also had another shipyard in Okhta, Saint Petersburg. The company was founded as Cowie & Eriksson. At the beginning it produced steam engines, boilers and other engineering products. William Crichton became owner in 1862 and the company was named W:m Crichton & C:o The first shipbuilding slipway was constructed in 1864. The company became the biggest employer of Turku after acquiring the nearby yard √Öbo Skeppswarf in 1883. Crichton died in 1889, after which the operations were continued by investors. In 1896 the company started a new yard in Okhta, Saint Petersburg, to build ships for the local market. The operations were poorly organised, and both yards lost so much money that the entire company went bankrupt in 1913. A new company, Ab Crichton, was established in 1914 to continue shipbuilding in Turku.  Name typography and spelling  The contemporary sources use alternative spellings W _m_ Crichton & C _o_ , W:m Crichton & C:o and W:m Crichton & Co. for which the corresponding Russian transliteration was –í:–º—ä –ö—Ä–µ–π—Ç–æ–Ω—ä –∏ –ö–æ. (\\"V:m Kreiton i Ko.\\").  Origins  The company was started in 1842, when Swedish chief engineer Anders Thalus Eriksson and Scottish David Cowie got a permit to start a foundry and engineering works in Turku.Haavikko: 1834‚Äì1907; chapter 5. pp. 11‚àí13. The men had worked before in Stockholm for Samuel Owen who had built the first steam engines of Sweden. The location for the premises was selected an empty lot on east bank of river Aura, in address It√§inen Rantakatu 56‚Äì58. The start was funded by a loan of 15 000 silver rubles given by the senate. The operations started in 1844 and the portfolio consisted of steam engines and other machinery. In 1844 the company employed 86 people. While starting an engineering company from scratch included a high risk, there was need for steam engines in industrialising Finland. The products were steam engines and various castings and forgings, and the main customer became the Turku Old Shipyard located at the other side of the river.  First steam engines  Imperial Russian steam frigate Rurik at Turku Old Shipyard. The first known large Turku-built ship propelled by Cowie & Eriksson engine was the 1850 built Furst Menschikoff II.Knorring: Pitk√§ tarina lyhyesti. pp. 31‚Äì33. Cowie & Eriksson got an order for an engine to power steam frigate Rurik, which was the largest ship built in Finland until then. In 1850 the company hired Scottish engineer William Crichton to accomplish installation and commissioning of the 300-hp engine; the project took three years in total. The ship was launched at the Turku Old Shipyard in 1851 and handed over in 1853, after which Crichton left the company. The company suffered of lack of orders during the Crimean War. Eriksson decided to give up the business and sold his share of the company to local investor Erik Julin in 1857. After this the company operated under name D. Cowie & C:o. Julin started to seek for a partner who had experience about marine industry and business knowledge. He wrote a letter to William Crichton, who lived then in Kolpino, close to Saint Petersburg, and suggested him to buy Cowie's share of the company. Crichton took the offer and moved in Turku in 1862, after which the company was named W:m Crichton & C:o. Crichton was up to date about the latest development of naval engineering: propellers were replacing paddle wheels, wood gave way to steel and compound technology was entering in steam engines; this was enabled by the recently invented fire-tube boilers which withstood higher pressure.  Start of shipbuilding  S/S Lahtis in the 1890s. Picture of Crichton's hydraulic patent slip from 1865. Crichton wanted to extend the company portfolio to complete vessels. The company's first ships were not built in Turku but delivered in parts to V√§h√§-√Ñini√∂ yard at lake P√§ij√§nne, 230 km away from Turku. The ships were paddle steamers built by local craftsmen under supervision of specialists sent by Crichton. The first one, named Ensimm√§inen (\\"first\\") was powered by a small, 12-hp engine and handed over in 1863. The subsequent Toinen (\\"second\\") was delivered in the following year and had a 25-hp engine. Both ships were intended for log tugging. Three more ships were built at V√§h√§-√Ñini√∂ yard: passenger ships Seura, which was a 28.8 metres long, and 33.7-metre Lahtis were both paddle steamers and handed over in 1864. In 1866 the Imperial Russian Army ordered Knyas Aleksei, a propeller equipped ship for P√§ij√§nne transportation.Knorring: Crichtonin ensimm√§iset h√∂yrylaivat. pp. 33‚Äì34. In the meantime, a new slipway was taken into use in Turku in 1864; it could be applied both on newbuilding and repairs. A mast crane was built to lift engines and boilers into hulls and to unload steel sheets from barges. The first ships built on the new slipway were a tugboat and a couple of barges delivered to a Saint Petersburg customer in about 1865. It is likely that also few other vessels were built before 1867, when steam cruiser Suomi was built, but the original order documents have not survived. Crichton built and installed small auxiliary steam engines on sailing ships in 1864‚Äì1873. The stern was modified to allow fitting of boiler, engine and propeller. The complete number of conversion projects remains unknown but the existing documents mention few barques and schooners with 30‚Äì40-hp engines. The concept was unsuccessful and in many cases the engines were removed after. In 1868 Crichton delivered for Russian steam frigate Knyas Pozyarsk, a 35-feet longboat powered by a 5-hp steam engine. The boat type became one of the company's specialties; by 1905 Crichton had delivered at least 50 longboats. The hull was typically composite construction with steel ribs and wooden planking, sometimes completely made from steel. Engine output was generally under 10 hp, the most powerful one being 68 hp.Knorring: Parkassit. p. 34.  Growth  The 1867 Suomi, delivered to the Finnish Customs, was Crichton's largest ship produced by then. It was 110' 6\\" long, 18' wide, the draught was 7' and displacement 107 tonnes. The engine output was 320 ihp.Knorring: Crichtonin suurimmat h√∂yrylaivat. pp. 35‚Äì43. Although most of the subsequent orders consisted of relatively small vessels, such as longboats, tug boats and small sailboats, Crichton predicted that demand for larger ships would grow and he wanted to follow the trend. Despite of the famine years in the 1860s, the yard sales grew steadily. In about 1870 Crichton bought more land from It√§inen Rantakatu 60‚Äì62 and built a larger, in particular wider slipway diagonally next to the river. In March 1872 W:m Crichton & C:o received the largest order until then. The customer was √Öngfartygsaktiebolaget √Öbo, which ordered a passenger and freight ship for the Stockholm ‚Äì Turku ‚Äì Helsinki ‚Äì Saint Petersburg route. The draught of the ship was 437 tonnes and the price was 200 000 marks. The delivery was scheduled for spring 1873. Although the size of the ship did not cause problems, the short lead time did ‚Äì the ship, named √Öbo (\\"Turku\\"), was launched at the end of May 1873 and it was ready for sea trial only at the end of September. The interior outfitting work was outsourced to the Turku Old Shipyard. Although Crichton presumably paid high penalties for the delay, the customer was satisfied with the result and the performance of the 100-hp compound engine which provided maximum cruise speed of 10 knots. In 1875 Turun H√∂yrylaiva Oy ordered a passenger steamer. Its size was 175√ó26√ó10 feet and net tonnage 357. Her 125-hp compound engine gave a maximum speed of 11 knots. S/S Finland was handed over in June 1876, now in due time. Shipyard office built in 1873. In the early 1870s W:m Crichton & C:o employed 400 people. Most of the sales came from steam engines and other machinery, and just 30% of turnover came from ships. The company produced most of the needed tools, even drilling and turning machines, in its own workshops. Rapid growth of the company and the large orders required investments and various financial arrangements, creating large risks to its owners. At about the same time with making quotation for S/S Finland in 1874, the owners converted W:m Crichton & C:o a limited company in order to assure their personal property. The capital was 1 500 000 marks which was divided into 30 shares, each of 50 000 marks value; 20 shares were owned by William Crichton and 10 shares by trading house Julin. Erik Julin died already in the same year, after which the trading house was led by his son John Julin. Due to the growing demand of larger ships Crichton became interested at the Turku Old Shipyard company located at the opposite side of river Aura. The yard had capacity for building large hulls. During the 1870s William Crichton grew his ownership in the Turku Old Shipyard and by the end of the decade he became majority shareholder and was appointed head of the company in 1878. Straight after this Crichton started investments at the old yard to enable building of large steel hulls; a workshop was built for bending steel ribs and after few years there were sheet steel forming and riveting facilities. When Crichton received two large orders with two steel ships in each in 1881, the hull production of Solovetski, Murmanski, Zurukan and Spasiteliy was subcontracted from the Old Shipyard. During that year Crichton handed over total 12 vessels, including customs boat Wiikinki, paddle steamer Krasnovodsk and six smaller vessels. Crichton became sole owner in 1883 and merged the yard to his own company. Subsequently, W:m Crichton & C:o became by far the largest company of Turku; the headcount was 936 and turnover 1 589 000 marks. In 1879 Englishman John Eager became the company head designer. He was specialised on fast boats and designed a number of new vessel types, such as torpedo boats, gunboats and tanker ships. When the Imperial Russian Navy started an extensive investment programme 1881, which included substantial extension of the Pacific fleet, the company received many beneficial orders. Crichton and Eager had created good contacts with the Russian authorities who decided about state purchases. The company gained good reputation in Moscow industrial fair in 1882, when W:m Crichton & C:o won a significant award, the Empire Seal. Despite of the positive reputation, getting orders from the state required a complex process, including formal and informal negotiations, official and unofficial money transfers. The company had a dedicated contact person in Saint Petersburg, commercial councellor F.W. Martinson, who handled the negotiations with the Russian officials. In 1882 Crichton received orders for four tankers. 980-tonne Lastoska was powered by a 380-hp engine and delivered to an Astrakhan based customer. 670-tonne sisters Obiyt, Armenia and Atmosfer featured 80-hp engines and had length of 152' and width of 23'. The customer was Naphta Transport Company in Baku. It is possible that the ships were built by using drawings from Swedish Motala Works, which had built the world's first tanker ship just a few years earlier. Years 1881‚Äì1882 were the record-breaking years for Crichton; the good order level reached until 1887. During these years W:m Crichton & C:o got 113 orders. Most of the vessels were smaller, such as longboats, small motorboats and sailing boats. Only three ships were large, over 1 000 tonnes in size. Notable passenger ships built in the 1880s were the 1887 delivered 345-tonne Ebba Munck and 1888 delivered 183-tonne Heben. The premises were extended again in 1887, when two large sheds with slipways were built on the west bank.  John Eager's era  View on the west side of the yard in early summer 1897. = Changes in ownership = The company faced a major loss in April 1889 when William Crichton passed away just at the age of 62 years. John Eager took his post as company manager. None of Crichton's 12 children wanted to take the business. Shortly after four shares were sold to Eager, one to the major funding bank Nordiska Aktiebanken f√∂r Handel och Industrie. In the 1890s 13 of the remaining 15 shares were sold. Count Anatol Orloff-Davidoff from Saint Petersburg bought 12 shares and another nobleman from the same city, Ludwig von Havemann, bought one share. Supposedly, the Russia-based owners contributed the rapid growth of the company after the mid-1890s, but speculatively they also initiated the disastrous decision of starting operations in Saint Petersburg. Trading house John Julin held ten shares; after death of John Julin the shares went to his two daughters, who were married to prosperous brothers Ernst and Magnus Dahlstr√∂m. In 1898 the shares were transferred to trading house C. M. Dahlstr√∂m and both brothers represented five shares each. Count Orloff- Davidoff gave his shares to his sons Alexander and Alexei in 1906. Other new owners then were Russian German businessman Alfred Meiser and colonel Karl Bj√∂rksten. = Ships for the imperial family = W:m Crichton & C:o won again the Empire Seal in industrial fair in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896; it also had an own exhibition stand with range of small steam engines in Paris World Expo in year 1900. The company won one gold medal but never managed to sell products to Central and Western Europe. Grand duke Alexander Mikhailovich ordered a yacht from W:m Crichton & C:o in 1895. The 1897 built over 1 000-tonne steam yacht Tamara was the most luxurious ship built by Crichton. No records about the interior have survived but it was most likely ordered from Saint Petersburg. The length of the ship was 79.2 metres and the two 600-hp triple expansion steam engines provided maximum speed of 14 knots. Another notable vessel delivered in 1897 was not significant in size, but the customer and structure makes it noteworthy. It was small steamship Peterhof, ordered by the Russian czar Nikolai II, who used it for travelling between the capital and Peterhof Palace. The ship was almost entirely built from brass alloy called delta metal, anti-magnetic material, which would not activate potential naval mines set by terrorists. The structures on the deck were decorated by gold plated mouldings. The ship was 61' long, 10.5* wide and its draught was 5'2\\". The 185-hp steam engine gave speed of 13 knots. In 1903 the company delivered two steam cruisers, Kondor and Berkut, to the Russian Customs. Both of them had 900-hp engines and maximum speed of 14.5 knots. The last luxurious vessel built by W:m Crichton & C:o was the 1905 delivered steam yacht Neva, which was built to the Navy Minister Aleksei Birilev. The ship was exceptionally paddle steamer. The engines generated output of 1 100 horsepower which gave her maximum speed of 15 knots, which is high for a such type of vessel. At the turn of the century the company was still healthy, although delays in payments from Russia caused occasional shortages in cash reserves. During those years the company could not pay dividend. Due to unprofitable deals the company made loss by 153 000 marks in 1904 and 335 000 marks in 1905 although the yard was fully employed. The steam yacht Neva had been sold for 1 068 000 marks with a small profit, but eventually the project caused loss of 226 655 marks; the last part of the payment came from the customer as late as in 1909. John Eager retired in summer 1906 and the new manager became Karl Bj√∂rksten. = Okhta shipyard = In 1896 W:m Crichton & C:o leased premises in Okhta, Saint Petersburg, for building vessels and their engines for the Russian Admiralty.Knorring: Ochtan telakka. pp. 73‚Äì75. In the agreement the company committed to invest on the buildings and machinery, but despite of large sums spent on the facilities, a single steam engine was never built. Since the very beginning operations were poorly organised; schedules were not kept and raw materials were used wastefully. Until 1907 the losses at Okhta were caused by penalty payments and investments but after that some bad deals made earlier started to cause massive losses, most significant ones being four Kaiman-class submarine hulls, two minelayers and two icebreakers. In 1907 Bj√∂rksten demanded that the technical management at Okhta yard must be changed. This happened in 1908. In 1909 the situation looked still hopeful, but the interest charges caused by the earlier losses made the situation unbearable.  Navy vessels  W:m Crichton & C:o produced its first torpedo boats for the Imperial Russian Navy in 1877‚Äì1878. These early models were small and featured steel hull and one or two torpedo launchers. The engines were 220-hp high pressure steam engines. The drawings for the boats were made by Admiralty Technical Department. Most of the boats were produced at Saint Petersburg yards. Crichton produced six units from the total 100 boats ordered by the Baltic Fleet.Knorring: Crichtonin toimitukset Ven√§j√§n keisarin laivastolle. pp. 43‚Äì50. In 1885 W:m Crichton & C:o produced its largest vessel by then, gunboat Bobr (\\"Beaver\\") with displacement of 1 187 tonnes. She featured two engines with total output of 1 140 hp, which gave her maximum speed of 11 knots. The vessel was heavily armed; two 9\\" cannons on the bow and a 6\\" cannon on the stern and additional smaller six 42-mm and four 37-mm guns. The gunboat served in the Russian Pacific fleet until it sank due to Japanese fire in Port Arthur bombing in 1904. Imperial Russian mine cruiser Abrek. The Imperial Russian Navy kept modernising its fleet; in 1887 Crichton received and order for eight new generation torpedo boats. Four of them, Borgo, Ekenes, Kotka and Dag√∂ had engine power of 1 000 hp. The four bigger ones Gogland, Nargen, Polanger and Pakerort had two engines, each of them with 1 000 hp output. The maximum speed was between 18‚Äì21 knots. In 1893 two torpedo cruisers Vsadnik and Gajdamak were launched. The armour consisted of six 47-mm and three 37-mm guns and one torpedo launcher placed on the deck. The 3 300-hp engine output gave maximum speed of 21 knots. Both ships sunk in Port Arthur in December 1904 but Japanese lifted and repaired them, after which they served in the Imperial Japanese Navy until 1914. An even bigger torpedo cruiser, 500-tonne torpedo cruiser Abrek was handed over in 1897. The value of the order was 1 340 000 marks. The 4 500 hp engine power enable maximum speed of 21 knots. Abrek featured two 75-mm and 47-mm guns and two torpedo launchers placed on the deck. The ship grounded at the front of Tallinn in 1906 and was removed from craft due to the damages. In 1898 new Sokol type of torpedo boats, Kretyet and Korsyun, were launched. They were based on drawings made by Scottish Yarrow & Co after assignment of the Russian Navy. The total number of the boats was 26 and all the others were built at yards in Saint Petersburg area. Two high-power steam engines gave output of total 3 800 hp and maximum speed of 28 knots; there were two torpedo launchers and four guns size between 47 mm and 75 mm. Imperial Russian torpedo boat N:o 220 built in 1904. The Russian Navy ordered two Cyklon type torpedo boats which were designed by French Norm√°ndie shipyard. The engine output was the same 3 800 hp as in Sokol type but due to lighter structure and smaller fuel capacity they reached 29 knots' maximum speed. The ships were handed over in 1904. After suffering heavy losses in the Russo-Japanese War, the Russian Navy placed orders for new craft: total 16 units of 650-tonne torpedo destroyers with engine power of 7 300 hp were ordered from various yards, two of them from W:m Crichton & C:o. The 75-metre vessels were designed by Stettiner Vulkan in Germany and featured two 100-mm and on 37-mm guns, four machine guns and three torpedo launchers for 450-mm torpedoes. The top speed of Ochotnik and Pogranityniy reached 25 knots. The vessels were handed over in 1906 and the deal of total 4 340 352 marks was the biggest the yard ever got. These were the last torpedo boats ever built in Turku. The orders of the Russian Navy ceased in 1906 due to political tensions between the Empire and Grand Duchy.  Combustion engines  The decision of starting combustion engine production originated most likely from Karl Bj√∂rksten. As the company did not have the needed expertise, Bj√∂rksten bought production licence for an engine type developed by Swedish engineer H.A. Bertheau. The first series of ten units was produced in 1906 and delivered to Okhta shipyard, to be mounted on cutters built there. The engine construction turned out to be technically failed; the engine problems delayed the handover and the company had to pay significant penalties. By 1907 total 24 engines were produced, of which 16 in Turku and 8 in Okhta, when the project was filed.Knorring: Crichtonin yrityksen polttomoottorit. pp. 90‚Äì91. In 1909 W:m Crichton & C:o started producing Loke engines, which were possibly also of Swedish design. The first two units were built in Okhta and installed to power a generator of a lightvessel. Total 73 units were produced until 1912; 16 in Turku and 57 in Okhta. Crichton's engines lost in properties to its neighbour and main competitor, Vulcan. Also another nearby company, Andr√©e & Rosenqvist, started engine production in 1912 and became successful in the field. Both of these companies had designed their own engines and had a lot of knowledge about engine production, but Crichton had chosen to work with bought drawings without understanding about the product.  1906‚Äì1913: decline and bankruptcy  Unprofitable deals, such as steam yacht Neva built in Turku in 1904 and four submarine hulls built in Okhta and handed over in 1905 caused massive losses to W:m Crichton & C:o. The failed combustion engines caused delays and warranty costs. Moreover, operations had relied on prepayments of new orders and therefore decline of order intake in 1906 led quickly to cash shortage. Ship order intake dropped drastically in 1906 leading to dismissal of hundreds of employees at the Turku yard.Knorring: H√∂yrykoneita Turusta 1906‚Äì59. pp. 61‚Äì64. By spring 1907 the company was in a serious crisis. In addition to cash shortage the company's machinery and facilities were in poor shape and old fashioned, causing low productivity. The facilities required immediate investments, for which the company had no funds. While steam engine production was still profitable and they were produced for the ships built at Okhta yard and sold also for some other yards in Saint Petersburg, only few boilers were built due to old and shattered boiler shop in Turku. Therefore, most of the Okhta built ships featured locally built boilers. All the engines were compound type with output range of 80‚Äì120 ihp, featuring 9\\" and 17\\" bores and 10\\" long stroke, or 9¬Ω\\" and 19\\" bores with stroke of 12\\". In 1908 W:m Crichton & C:o made loss by nearly 1.4 million marks and the outstanding debt reached 3.7 million marks. The main creditors were banks, Orloff-Davidoff brothers and C. M. Dahlstr√∂m company. The share capital was doubled from 1.5 million marks to 3 million in 1909, and in 1910‚Äì1911 the losses dropped to 290 000 marks. In the meantime the sales still declined and debt increased: at the end of 1911 the company was loaded by total 8.4 million marks' debt burden. Despite of the efforts, W:m Crichton & C:o was eventually filed for bankruptcy on 24 April 1913.  Re-establishment  Okhta yard was closed and the moveables were sold in the following year. C. M. Dahlstr√∂m company held claims of over 4.5 million marks to the bankrupt estate. The Dahlstr√∂m brothers took immediate actions to restart the operations in Turku, in order to secure their property. Therefore, only such property was sold that was not necessary for production. New company, Aktiebolaget Crichton, was founded in June 1914 under leadership of the Dahlstr√∂m brothers.  Some of the longest-time served vessels  S/S Saimaa cruising at Olavinlinna. The hull of the 1860s built paddle steamer Lahtis has survived. The ship is currently undergoing a thorough rebuild. Many of the W:m Crichton & C:o's vessels built for the public authorities served for decades, some of them surviving over 100 years of age. The main reason for this was the Finnish government's purchasing policy; as long as it was cheaper in a short term to operate old ships rather than invest on new craft, the old vessels were kept in service. The 1867 built steam cruiser Suomi, that served as customs control vessel, was in use until 1935. Hydrographic survey ship Sekstant, later √Öland, operated from 1872 until 1959. The 1878 built light vessel Taipaleenluoto served on lake Ladoga until Winter War and the subsequent Moscow Peace Treaty in 1940, after which it stayed in the territory ceded to Soviet Union; the fate of the ship is unknown. Customs control ship Nordvakten built in the same year was broken up in 1959.Knorring: Valtion uskolliset palvelijat. pp. 51‚Äì54. The Light vessel Relandersgrund built in 1888 served until 1977, when it was decommissioned under name Vuolle. The badly decayed ship was salvaged from a shipbreaker in 1991, after which she was thoroughly renovated and nowadays she serves as a restaurant ship in Helsinki. Relandersgrund is the oldest surviving Finnish light vessel. In 1892 the company built two light ships, which were sisters: Nahkiainen was used until 1976 and √Ñrangsgrund was later converted into cargo ship that operated until the 1980s. The 1893 built pilot ship Saimaa has remained nearly original and she still operates in summertime by her Crichton- made steam engine.

He attended the University of California at Berkeley, graduating Phi Beta Kappa, and earning a Ph.D. in physics. Teaching Posin worked as a teaching assistant at Berkeley for two years, and then accepted a position teaching physics from 1937-41 in Panama. He returned to the US and taught at Montana State University and the Montana School of Mines until 1944, when he went to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and performed research on radar and radioactivity. At MIT he also met Albert Einstein. It was Einstein who urged him to teach ordinary people about the peaceful uses of atomic power, and that led to Posin writing the book I Have Been to the Village. Posin gave more than 3,000 lectures about nuclear power and his position on peaceful use won him six nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1946 Posin became chairman of the physics department at North Dakota Agricultural College in Fargo. In 1955, Posin, along with Cecil Haver and Baldur Kristjanson (Assistant Professors of Agricultural Economics), and William B.

The club plays Gaelic Football competing in Meath GAA & Leinster competitions. The club plies their trade in the Meath Senior Football Championship since 2016 and won their first Meath Senior Football Championship in 2019. The club has tasted Senior success in hurling, winning the Meath Senior Hurling Championship in 1963 and currently compete at senior hurling level since winning the 2016 Meath Intermediate Hurling Championship. History Ratoath was founded in 1903, however in this period it was solely a hurling club. Ratoath won a Senior Hurling League title in 1912 (the first recorded honour for the club) and Junior Hurling Championships in 1929, '31, '40 and '57. For much of the 1950s, Ratoath amalgamated with surrounding clubs (Kiltale, Batterstown, Drumree, Skryne and some Priests from Warrenstown College) and won two Meath Senior Hurling Championships known as St. Patrick's in 1953 and '54. The 1960s were a golden period for Ratoath hurling. In 1960, Ratoath contested their first S.H.C. final, beaten by Trim on the day, however in 1963 they defeated St. Peter's Dunboyne to claim their first and only S.H.C. title. Down by 11 points during the second half, Ratoath battled to emerge victorious by a scoreline of 9‚Äì3 to 6‚Äì11 (30 points to 29). Ratoath went on to contest three more S.H.C. finals but lost out to Athboy (1967 & '68) and Kilmessan ('69). In 1981 and '83, Ratoath contested I.H.C. finals but were defeated by Kilskyre and Dunshaughlin respectively. Ratoath went on to annexe another J.H.C. title in 1989, beating Kilmessan in the final. Ratoath won the 2016 Meath Intermediate hurling championship by beating Kilskyre/Moylagh in the final. This win meant that they were Meath's representatives in that year's Leinster Junior Club Hurling Championship where they defeated Carlow Town Hurling Club 2-20 to 2-9, Clodiagh Gaels (Offaly) 1-13 to 2-8 and Rosenallis (Laois) 1-20 to 1-16 after extra time to reach the final. They met Mooncoin (Kilkenny) in the Leinster final but were defeated 1-16 to 0-12. Mooncoin reached the 2016‚Äì17 All-Ireland Junior Club Hurling Championship final and were defeated by Mayfield (Cork) In their first season back in the Senior hurling championship, Ratoath made the quarter finals by beating Longwood, Clann na nGael and Trim in the group stages. They were beaten in the quarter final by eventual runners up, Kildalkey. The football section of Ratoath was founded in 1956 and they took part in the Meath Junior Football Championship. A J.F.C. wasn't attained until 1970 however, when they beat Navan O'Mahonys second string in the final. J.F.C. finals were reached 1992 and 2003, losing to Gaeil Colmcille's second string and Wolfe Tones respectively (Wolfe Tones went on to win the All- Ireland Junior Title. 2004 was a monumental year for the club. A J.F.C. title was claimed when beating Dunsany in the final, and Ratoath also went on to claim provincial honours. The Leinster Junior Club Football Championship was won with a final victory over Kilclonfert of Offaly, however in the All- Ireland semi-final, they bowed out to Stewartstown Harps of Tyrone. Their time in the Intermediate ranks were short lived though and the club soon dropped down to Junior once more. Moynalvey defeated them in the J.F.C. final of 2008 but Ratoath made amends for this in 2012, when a youthful squad defeated local rivals Donaghmore/Ashbourne's second string 1‚Äì11 to 1‚Äì10. Following this after just three years in the Intermediate ranks, Ratoath claimed their first Meath Intermediate Football Championship title when beating Nobber 1‚Äì15 to 0‚Äì5 with no fewer than five clubmen representing the Meath county seniors, and hence moving up to the Meath Senior Football Championship for the first time in the club's history. Ratoath went on to win beat St. Patrick's Donabate (Dublin), Railyard (Kilkenny), Castledermot (Kildare) and Athlone (Westmeath) to win the 2015 Leinster Intermediate Club Football Championship and bring the Se√°n Eiffe trophy back to Se√°n Eiffe Park. Ratoath were defeated by St. Mary's Cahirciveen in the All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship who went on to win the final. After being beaten at the quarter final stage in the Senior Football Championship in 2017 and 2018, Ratoath, managed by Davy Byrne, went on to win their first ever senior football title in 2019 by beating Summerhill 3-15 to 2-13 in the final. Ratoath forward Joey Wallace was awarded the man of the match. Ratoath retained their senior football title in 2020 by beating Gaeil Colmcille in the final 1-14 to 1-13. Joey Wallace scored the winning goal in 9th minute of injury time and was awarded man of the match for the second year in a row. Joined with Donaghmore, Meath Minor Football Championship honours were claimed in 1977 and '79 and in 1987 another title at the same level was gained, this time with St. Martin's. In 2011 Ratoath won their first ever M.F.C. beating Moynalvey in the final, and they successfully defended their title a year later this time against Donaghmore/Ashbourne. They regained the title in 2017 by beating Na Fianna in the final. U-21 Football Championship titles were garnered in 2013 and '14 with wins over Donaghmore/Ashbourne (0‚Äì12 to 1‚Äì8) and Navan O'Mahonys (1‚Äì13 to 1‚Äì8) respectively. Their third U-21 Football Championship was added in 2019, beating St. Peter's, Dunboyne 1-15 to 0-8 in the final.

The man claims that he inherited a building with studio apartments from a distant relative, so he became the landlord of the building, renting the apartments out to tenants. The Landlord's penthouse apartment is equipped with screens that allow the Landlord to see inside each apartment, which all have hidden cameras. His tenants include divorcee Mr. Wang Ming-kai and his fourth-grade daughter; Ms. Chen Min-hui, an office worker who uses her body for financial gain and advantages in the workplace; Mr. Chang Kuo-sheng, a physical education teacher who enjoys peeping on his neighbors and is infatuated with Ms. Chen; Bo-yan, a geeky college student obsessed with the idea of having superpowers; and a gay couple, Kuo Li and Ling Hu. The Landlord also claims that a mysterious woman named Ying-ru lives in the apartment directly under his penthouse; however, the police interrogator states that there is no record of anyone named Ying-ru having lived there. The Landlord spies on his tenants closely, and figures out everyone's routine. However, he finds that Ying-ru has no discernible routine. He lets himself into Ying-ru's apartment to investigate while she is out, but Ying-ru returns unexpectedly, with a man. The Landlord hides, and watches as Ying-ru drugs the man with poisoned tea, then ties him up in the bathtub. However, the Landlord does not alert the authorities, and over the course of several days, Ying-ru tortures the man to death. A few days later, Ying-ru drags a bound woman back to her apartment in a suitcase, and also tortures her to death in her bathtub. The Landlord confronts Ying-ru, who says that she cannot accept a life without change or possibility. Therefore, she is determined to avoid a mundane life, and will shatter whatever boundaries are in her way. The Landlord takes her words to heart, and decides to shatter his tenants' routine lives. The Landlord tricks Bo-yan into thinking he has teleportation powers, manipulates Kuo Li and Ling Hu into believing the other is being unfaithful, allows Mr. Chang to break into Ms. Chen's room and have sex with her, and adds an aphrodisiac to Mr. Wang's mosquito coil to give him lustful feelings towards his daughter. The Landlord's antics eventually result in the deaths of Mr. Wang and Ling Hu. The police interrogator points out places where the Landlord's story does not match the facts. Ms. Chen is actually married to Mr. Wang; Kuo Li and Ling Hu are uncle and nephew, not lovers; Mr. Chang is a gay university professor and thus could not be infatuated with Ms. Chen; and Bo-yan is a model student and is not obsessed with superpowers. The Landlord's interrogation is then interrupted by a police officer, who has found the Landlord's true identity. The Landlord used to be a police officer named Chang Chia-chun, and had participated in an investigation against Huang Si-lang, a man who had abducted and tortured schoolgirls to death‚Äîincluding Chang's daughter Chang Ying-ru. Huang had avoided serious punishment by claiming insanity. Chang had volunteered to go undercover in the asylum where Huang was being kept, in order to extract a confession, but Chang's superior officer died unexpectedly, which meant no one knew Chang was undercover in the asylum. Chang underwent forced treatments and tortures, which broke his mind. In the asylum, Huang gave Chang the keys to the building where he had killed the schoolgirls, including Chang's daughter, and then committed suicide. After Chang was released, he left the police force, went to the building, and began accepting tenants there. He also imagined his daughter Ying-ru as one of the tenants, and himself as Ying-ru, he tracked down the people who had forcibly treated him in the asylum, and tortured them to death one by one.

The first mention of a bailo in Corfu is in 1386 and is found in a Greek chronicle. The bailo of Corfu is also mentioned in a document by historian Marco Guazzo from 1544. Amongst the Venetian provincial administrators, the Duke of Candia was the foremost, followed in order of seniority by the leaders of Negroponte, Corfu, Modon and Coron and Argos-Nauplion. The bailo of Corfu also administered the affairs of the Venetian dependencies of Butrinto and Lepanto in the mainland. Pantaleone Barbo was the first bailo of Corfu. The bailo of Corfu also made reports and recommendations to Venice regarding the construction of fortifications on the island. Historical background To protect its military and commercial interests the Republic of Venice had established missions in key locations in the Ionian Sea and the Aegean. The Venetian missions were called reggimenti and their leaders were elected by the Senate of Venice or its Great Council. The leaders were elected for terms ranging between approximately 16 months to three years. The general title of the leaders was Rettore, translated as rector. However the specific title awarded the rector varied depending on the location they administered. Thus in the Kingdom of Candia the leader was called Duca, in Zante the term was Conte and in Corfu the leader of the regiment was given the title of Bailo. Being elected Rettore was an honour and established that the elected leader had the confidence of his peers in the Senate and Great Council and, although a mission in the overseas protectorates of Venice was expensive and dangerous, many Venetian noblemen lobbied for the position. Cuprus, Candia and possibly Corfu were considered the top locations of the Venetian realm. The position of Bailo of Corfu was considered prestigious. In one occasion when Gian Matteo, after retiring as Rettore of Cattaro, lost the election to the position in Corfu, he was consoled by Pietro, a Venetian nobleman: Communication with Venice During the Ottoman invasion of Albania, the bailo of Corfu sent intelligence to the Venetian Senate advising them of the Ottoman gains after they took Rugina, known at the time as the \\"Lady of Valona\\", and Valona proper. The Venetians were very concerned about the Ottoman incursions which threatened the dominion and commerce of Venice and its dependencies in the Adriatic and the Strait of Otranto. The bailo of Corfu also sent messages to Venice regarding his ideas about fortifications. In 1538 in one such message the bailo of Corfu remarked: Baili This list is derived from Karl Hopf, Chroniques gr√©co-romanes in√©dites ou peu connues (Berlin: Weidmann, 1873), pp. 392‚Äì96. In 1386, Venice was represented at Corfu by three provveditori: Michele Contarini, Saracino Dandolo and Marino Malipiero.

Isaac Williams was born near Scranton, Pennsylvania, and had resided in Ohio and Missouri before leaving Fort Smith in 1831, with the Bean- Sinclair trapping party for the Rocky Mountains. At Taos he joined the Ewing Young fur trapping expedition that arrived in Los Angeles, Alta California on April 14, 1832. Williams remained there, where he became known as Julian by the locals, and worked as a merchant before he married Maria de Jesus Lugo, daughter of the ranchero Antonio Maria Lugo in 1839. In 1841, Isaac Williams built a large adobe home, on the 22,000-acre Rancho Santa Ana del Chino which his wife acquired from his father-in-law Antonio Lugo. After bearing three children, Maria de Jesus died in childbirth in 1842. The following year, an addition to the rancho of three square leagues (for a total of eight square leagues) was granted by Governor Micheltorena to Williams. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War the Battle of Chino occurred at the adobe on September 26-27, 1846, during which 24 Americans including Williams were captured by a group of about 50 Californios. During the time of the California Gold Rush, having experienced the rigors of crossing the Mojave Desert with the Young party, Williams' rancho became a stop and a source of aid for travelers on the Mormon Road to California. Williams would send help to travelers on the desert road who were starving or had lost their animals, giving the travelers or their rescue parties food and sometimes horses or mules, or sent his own men out into the desert to do so. Located on the Southern Immigrant Trail the adobe became a stop and later an inn famous for its hospitality to parties of Forty-niners and later travelers. Williams died at his home in 1856.

The movement was founded by writer Gonzalo Arango and was influenced by nihilism, existentialism, and the works of Colombian writer and philosopher Fernando Gonz√°lez Ochoa. Nadaism was largely a movement in reaction to La Violencia and was the Colombian expression of numerous avant-garde-like movements in the poetry of the Americas during the 1950s and 60s, such as the Beat Generation in the United States and the Tzanticos in Ecuador. The movement was largely anti-establishment. It resulted in several works of literature, music, and movies expressing Nadaist themes. The term nada√≠smo was a play on the words \\"nada\\", meaning nothing, and \\"Dadaism\\" (). Nada√≠smo has sometimes been called \\"Colombian dadaism\\", a \\"Colombian Beat Generation\\", or \\"Colombian Futurism\\". History The violent events in Colombia during the 1940s and 1950s permeate the works of Nadaist writers. Events such as La Violencia and the military government of Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, as well as a considerable urban expansion, greatly influenced the formation of the Nada√≠sta (Nothing-ist) movement. Arango had originally supported Pinilla when he came to power in Colombia, joining the Movimiento Amplio Nacional (Broad National Movement) composed of artists and young intellectuals that supported the dictator.Escobar, Eduardo, Boceto biogr√°fico . Link retrieved on June 12, 2008. In this period, Arango devoted himself to journalism. Soon, however, the reaction of the leaders of conservatives and liberals against Rojas was manifested in an agreement that caused his fall on May 10, 1957. While the dictator was exiled in Spain, Gonzalo Arango eventually fled to Medell√≠n, Colombia. Arango began the Nadaist movement in 1958 when his 42-page \\"Nadaism Manifesto\\", signed as \\"gonzaloarango\\", was published in the magazine Amistad (meaning \\"Friendship\\") in Medell√≠n. Arango and other writers would write about their disillusionment with the government they had supported. Some of the first people to join the new movement were Alberto Escobar and Amilkar Osorio. As an inauguration, in 1958 they burned Colombian literature in the Plazuela de San Ignacio in Medell√≠n as a symbol against what was considered the traditional great works of Colombian literature. Works that they denounced included the earlier literary movements such as Los Nuevos. One of the books they burned was Arango's first work, \\"After the Man\\". The movement ended largely with the deaths of its founding members. Toward the end of his life, Arango distanced himself from the beliefs of the other members associated with the movement. Prominent figures Authors who were part of this movement include: Additionally, Los Speakers, The Young Beats, and Los Yetis were rock bands associated with this movement.

The Mary Meachum Freedom Crossing in St. Louis, the first site in Missouri to be accepted in the National Park Service's National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom, was named after her. Early life and marriage Meachum was born into slavery in Kentucky. While still enslaved, she married John Berry Meachum, who had already purchased his own freedom with money he had earned as a carpenter. In 1815, Mary Meachum's owner took her to St. Louis, Missouri. Her husband followed and purchased her freedom shortly afterwards. The Meachums ran a school for free and enslaved black people in the First African Baptist Church, which they later moved to a floating steamboat on the Mississippi River when the state of Missouri banned education for blacks in 1847. They also used the proceeds from John Berry Meachum's carpentry and barrel-making business to purchase freedom for twenty enslaved individuals. Mary Meachum's profession was listed as 'milkmaid' in 1835.Lea Vandervelde, Redemption Songs: Suing for Freedom Before Dred Scott, Oxford University Press, 2014, Arrest and trial After John Berry Meachum died in 1854, Mary Meachum continued running their home on Fourth Street as a 'safe house' on the Underground Railroad. On May 21, 1855, after an attempt to ferry nine enslaved people across the Mississippi River to freedom in Illinois, Meachum and a freedman named Isaac were arrested for breaking the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. On May 24, 1854, she was charged in court with slave theft, while charges against Isaac were dropped. The Missouri Republican reported on July 19, 1855 that Mary was tried by a jury and acquitted of at least one charge, and the remaining charges were dropped. The Colored Ladies Soldiers' Aid Society One scholar says Meachum was sold into slavery in Vicksburg, Mississippi, after her arrest.Snodgrass, The Underground Railroad: An Encyclopedia of People, Places and Operations, Introduction, p. xxxi However, the Daily Missouri Democrat reported on December 17, 1864, that Meachum was at that time president of the Colored Ladies Soldiers' Aid Society in St. Louis.Daily Missouri Democrat, December 17, 1864. Cited in Sharon Elizabeth Romero, Freedwomen in Pursuit of Liberty, University of Iowa, 2009 This organization of free black women, also called the Colored Ladies Contraband Society, was formed in 1863 to assist black Union soldiers and escaped slaves in St. Louis during the Civil War. Because blacks were not allowed to ride streetcars at that time, the women negotiated with the streetcar company to ride the streetcar one day a week, on Saturdays, to the segregated wing of the Benton Barracks Hospital of St. Louis, where wounded black soldiers were hospitalized. There, the women read to the soldiers, comforted them, and taught them to read. The white nurse in charge of the hospital, Emily Parsons, wrote of her outrage that the women were limited to only one day a week and described them as \\"intelligent colored women, ladies in fact, many of them well educated and wealthy.\\"Jeannie Attie, Patriotic Toil: Northern Women and the Civil War, Cornell University Press, 1998 Death Meachum died in St. Louis in August, 1869.

He disappeared in the jungle of Guyana; his body was never found. Biography =Youth= Raymond Maufrais was born in Toulon, an only child. His parents were forced frequently to send the boy away from a young age, starting when he was nine. With two comrades he climbed the wall of the children's home they lived in in the Var department; the police spent three days looking for them. He attended Rouvi√®re school in Toulon in October 1939, where he showed promise in French and classical literature. By 1940 his father was a prisoner in Germany. In 1942, having listened to the BBC broadcasts, he decided to flee to England but an accident in Dieppe prevented his flight and by August had returned to Toulon. He played a minor part in the French resistance, distributing newspapers, writing graffiti, and reporting troop movements. His father had, in fact, joined the resistance in June 1942, leading a group of the Arm√©e secr√®te. He later joined the maquis in P√©rigord and worked with his father preparing landings in Provence; he was awarded the Croix de guerre 1939‚Äì1945 (with bronze star) and the Medal of French Gratitude, before he even turned 18. After liberation he joined the army, first as a war correspondent and then as a paratrooper, but finished his service before being called up. He then worked as a correspondent in Corsica, Italy, and along the C√¥te d‚ÄôAzur. = Expedition in Brazil = In July 1946 Maufrais left for Brazil. While in Rio de Janeiro he made a bet with an editor of the Brazilia Herald that he would go and investigate some unexplored area in the heart of Brazil. He met an Italian countess who managed to get him signed on to a \\"pacification\\" mission to the Xavante people who live in Mato Grosso and were, reportedly, very hostile toward strangers. Having traveled 2700 kilometers and found the remains of another expedition, the group was forced to retreat after being attacked by the natives. =Expedition in Guyana= In 1947 Maufrais returned to France to edit the manuscript he had been working on, for a book to be called Aventures au Matto-Grosso, which was not published until after his death, and gave public lectures in Toulon and elsewhere. He also announced a new project: to travel from French Guyana to Brazil by way of the (remote and inaccessible) Tumuk Humak Mountains, and then to descend the Rio Jari to Bel√©m‚Äîalone and on foot. His goal, as he later stated in his journals, was to find three tribes of cannibals and survivors of 51 tribes which had not been heard from in sixty years. At the time there was a strong belief in Cayenne that the southern parts of Guyana bordering on Brazil harbored many unknown tribes; later investigations showed that the area was uninhabited. Maufrais intended to investigate was He left in June 1949, having secured an advance payment from the magazine Sciences et Voyages for writing travel reports. He debarked in Cayenne and wrote articles on such subjects as the leper colony of Acarouany, the former workers of Bagnios, the coastal Kalina people, and the gold seekers. In September he joined a geological expedition and went inland, up the Rio Mana. During that journey Maufrais jumped in the water after a wounded caiman and killed it with a knife. He reached Maripasoula on 25 October, where he was held up for three weeks by the rains. In Grigel he was given an abandoned canoe which turned out to be unusable. Having no money, he bought no supplies, thinking he would be able to live on what he hunted. He began walking accompanied by his dog Bobby, with a backpack so heavy he divided his load in half and would walk a kilometer with one half, then drop that and return for the other half. He wrote a daily journal, which tells of his troubles‚Äîhe frequently lost the way, found practically nothing to eat, suffered from dysenteria, and constantly fought a hostile forest. He was forced to eat lizards, snails, birds, and seeds. On 1 January 1950, completely exhausted and unable to even fire his gun, he reached the Tamouri and the little settlement Claude where he found only abandoned buildings. He was delirious, and finally killed Bobby and ate him. He was forced to accept that he could not stick to his original travel plan and set off downriver for the closest village, the creole village of Bienvenue, at 70 kilometers. An attempt to build a raft failed (it fell apart, waterlogged),Gimlette 339. so instead he intended to wade downstream and then, after being rested and re-equipped, to return upstream and continue his journey. On 13 January, he left all his notes and photo equipment in a bag in a hut, keeping only a little bag with necessities and his machete. He got into the water and disappeared in the rapids, never to be seen again. Evidence found later suggested he managed to travel another thirty-five miles. At the end of February or the beginning of March, a man from the Emerillon people traveled on the river Tampok, and passed through the Claude settlement where he found Maufrais's belongings. It was not until 6 July that the press agency of Dutch Guyana reported the news of Maufrais's disappearance. The news was picked up by the French press, and the affaire Maufrais was started, fed by a stream of articles, hypotheses, and controversies. = The father's search= Edgard Maufrais in Brazil to search for his son. Maufrais's father, Edgar, began looking for his son in 1952; he left his wife behind in Toulon. He traveled twelve thousand kilometers in twelve years. He paid for his search by publishing his son's diaries (he also published his own book, √Ä la recherche de mon fils, published by √âditions Julliard). By chance, a television crew from R√©seau Outre-Mer 1re found him in Maripasoula in 1961, nine years into his fruitless search, and interviewed him. Afterward they also interviewed his wife back in Toulon. He returned to Toulon in June 1964, exhausted; he died ten years later. His wife slowly lost her mind and died in an asylum in Toulon in 1984. Legacy Dozens of books have been written on Maufrais, and he was the subject of four French films, most recently a 2015 production by J√©r√©my Banster starring Stany Coppet, who also co-wrote the film.

She was the first known woman photographer in California and probably the only woman working in her profession at the time in San Francisco. Biography Shannon‚Äîwhose birth name is not known‚Äîwas born in England around 1812 and by 1832 was married to a man named Joseph Shannon; she later used the name Mrs. Julia Shannon. The Shannons initially lived in New York City, where their three children were born between 1833 and 1840. They moved to San Francisco in 1848 or 1849. Mrs. Julia Shannon (as she styled herself) specialized in daguerrotypes. In 1850, with the California Gold Rush in full spate, she advertised as follows in the January issue of San Francisco Alta: :\\"Notice‚ÄîDaguerreotypes taken by a Lady.‚ÄîThose wishing to have a good likeness are informed that they can have them taken in a very superior manner, and by a real live lady too, in Clay St., opposite the St. Francis Hotel, at a very moderate charge. Give her a call, gents.\\" This advertisement places Shannon in San Francisco only one year after the arrival of the city's first photographer, Richard Carr, and clearly intends to capitalize on the novelty value of Shannon's status as a woman photographer. The only other woman associated with the profession of photography who was listed in local publications and directories of the 1850s was a colorist for one of Shannon's competitors, making it likely that Shannon was the only woman pursuing the profession of daguerrotypist in the city at the time. The second documented woman photographer in the city was Mrs. A.M. Genung of Stockton, a daguerreotypist who set up shop in San Francisco in 1860. It appears from a subsequent advertisement in the same publication that Shannon was also a midwife. In 1851, a catastrophic fire that destroyed a quarter of the city took with it the two houses that Shannon owned on Sacramento Street; they were valued at $7000 (the equivalent of over $400,000 in 2015), indicating that she was fairly well off. None of her daguerreotypes are known to have survived, and there are no records of her after the 1852 census.

Part Onondagan and part Senecan, he resided within the reserve of the Six Nations of the Grand River in Ontario, Canada. Knowledgeable about Iroquois culture, he is best known for the versions he provided of the Iroquois oral constitution, the Great Law of Peace. He acted as an advisor to the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs in matters relating both to Iroquois and non-Iroquois indigenous people. He was a well-respected player of the traditional Iroquois sport of lacrosse until he was blinded during a game when he was 31. Family and reservation life John Arthur Gibson (March 1, 1850 ‚Äì November 1, 1912) was also known as \\"Ganio'dai'io',\\" (\\"Promoter of the Code of Handsome Lake\\") and \\"Skanyadehehyoh\\" (or \\"Skanyadai'iyo\\"), then see page 139 of * * was born to his father, also named John Gibson, who was an Onondaga chief the name given to the traditional Senecan office-chief of Handsome Lake. His father, also named John Gibson, was an Onondaga chief or royaner, whose title was \\"Atotarho\\", (or \\"That√≥t√°‚Ä¢hoÀÄ\\") His mother was Hanna Gibson, of the Turtle clan of the Seneca nation. (Royaner is a word sometimes used for these chief-offices; another is sachem. According to Horatio Hale's 1883 discussion with Iroquois and historians, sachem is an Algonquin language word for the position and royaner is the traditional Iroquois word in Mohawk, and is used far more often sometimes. However the recent Encyclopedia of the Haudenosaunee uses both and sachem much more frequently.) Gibson had two brothers and two sisters. One of the brothers, George, was also named as one of the chief-office holders. The family lived on the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve in Ontario. =Historical background= The Six Nations of the Grand River reserve was founded through the efforts of Mohawk man Joseph Brant some 80 years earlier, following the American Revolution, as a rebirth of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy. The incursion of white people onto the reserve, partly encouraged by Brant, had later threatened the hegemony of the Iroquois over their individual lands. In 1847‚Äì8 the decision was taken to partition the land to Iroquois families on the basis of bloodlines, with phases of reacquiring land in cases where marriages, divorces or widowhood had established links to non- Indian family. Orphans were granted assistance from the reserve's council only if they were full-blood Indians. This segmentation process caused division between the Christian-converted, acculturated Iroquois and the conservative, Longhouse-religious parts of Iroquois society, even as it provided a specific reservation for the people of the six nations. Iroquois society has strong matrilineal associations and families adhere to their mother's clan and nation relationships. Thus, Gibson was raised according to the Code of Handsome Lake of his Senecan mother. The Seneca are, approximately speaking in English, \\"elder brothers\\" in the Iroquois confederacy ‚Äì \\"elder\\" specifically in relation to the \\"junior\\" Cayuga nation. The other \\"elder brothers\\" of the confederacy are the Mohawk nation who on the reserve at the time were more Christianized. They exerted considerable influence in council work; they succeeded in moving the seat of the council to a Mohawk village, appointing the executive ‚Äì and traditionally Onondagan ‚Äì \\"firekeeper\\" positions to Mohawks, and introducing committee decision processes populated with Mohawks. The official language of the council meetings became Mohawk and the traditional balance of power held equally amongst chiefs from all six nations was overcome. The six individual nations still had their own councils, but the central council felt these national councils were divisive (indeed, in the 1850s the Onondagan council had attempted to take action when the central council couldn't decide; the subsequent response by the Mohawk council caused some angst). Even so, the council felt they needed to defend the council's traditional form in the face of the Canadian government seeking to introduce a more Euro-American democratic system. Gibson was born into this new context of reduced national councils and a strong central or federated council, with a committee system strongly controlled by Mohawks, and a division between Christianized, acculturated Iroquois and the conservative part of the society. =The lacrosse player= A biography by his wife (a member of the Cayuga nation), describes Gibson as a \\"traditional man\\", vigorous and competitive in his youth, and highlights his involvement in the ball game of lacrosse, the traditional sport of the Iroquois. Mrs Gibson's narrative is \\"almost wholly occupied with lacrosse\\" and it reflects the role of lacrosse in the Iroquois society as it was then practiced, albeit with a new capitalist aspect. In Haudenosaunee religious thought, lacrosse is one of the two most essential sacred rites, that took place before coming to this world as we know it. The role of men in Iroquois society had changed from being a military asset in prior generations and defining social prominence by combat to having the battle of the game; the intensity of the game was real and became a locus for the native view of masculinity. The Gibsons took a lead role in organizing lacrosse events, setting up payments to teams and players and charges to supporters. Gibson also organized the first 12-player Iroquois team and was invited to play against white teams; newspapers carried mention of his lacrosse team.* * Gibson's wife's account also highlights that Gibson was not simply a \\"traditional man\\", but introduced or demonstrated several innovations. For example, although their marriage was arranged in a traditional sense, it is \\"easy to see in her narrative that the (traditional) matrilocality was no longer in effect and the nuclear family was well introduced\\". This change was, however, consistent with the Handsome Lake Code and so not totally foreign to Iroquois culture. Beyond his involvement in lacrosse, Gibson has been viewed as having a great awareness of and willingness to share Iroquois cultural heritage. William N. Fenton described him as \\"unquestionably the greatest mind of his generation among the Six Nations‚Ä¶[who] became the greatest living source on Iroquois culture at the turn of the century\\". Alexander Goldenweiser described Gibson in his youth as \\"one of those wide-awake, keen-witted Indians‚Ä¶ who spend hours and days listening to the stories of the old men and who are not satisfied until they have traced a custom or a belief back to its earliest remembered antecedents\\". =Learned Onondagan= Although Iroquois society didn't particularly value a person's patrilineal descent, Gibson had strong ties to his father's Onondagan nation. He inherited land from his father and went on to learn Onondagan language, as well as a suite of narratives and practices from the eldest and most senior Onondagan chief (the records do not specify his name). Whoever this Onondagan chief was he was described as being one of the oldest of all the Onondaga, one who personally remembered the days following the splitting up of the Iroquois nations during the American Revolution. He may have been the same Onondagan traditionalist who was present when the Code of Handsome Lake was established among the Seneca women to be remembered. Gibson's knowledge of Onondagan language and practices was so strong that Gibson's father (the senior Onondagan chief) asked Gibson to take his place for some ceremonies; from then on Gibson always spoke Onondagan in public and was later recorded as having been Onondagan himself, as well as Senecan. Seneca chief Traditional Iroquois society has 50 chiefs that participate in the governing Council. The chiefs' stations are not hereditary positions; every chief or royaner is appointed by a woman or women whose authority it is to appoint based on a consensus they are charged with finding. Distinctions were made between types of chief: Gibson was not appointed as a \\"Pine Tree Chief\\" like John Smoke Johnson or John Norton and others , but his value on grounds of ancestry and his personal achievement in Iroquois society were such that he was appointed to the Seneca chief position as \\"Skanyadehehyoh\\" (\\"Handsome Lake\\") in 1872. In the available biographies it is not stated which woman leader with authority to appoint the specific Seneca chieftainship office did so. In 1876 Gibson was appointed to the memorial committee on the centenary of the death of Joseph Brant. Around 1880-1882, at the age of 31, he was blinded in a game of lacrosse.. Gibson was observed presenting part of the epic about the Great Peacemaker in 1883. Gibson assisted the Canadian Department of Indian affairs on Iroquois issues as well as on non-Iroquois native matters. He contributed a significant effort in a land dispute between the Six Nations Reserve and the people the land was originally acquired from, the Mississaugas. He was also a council representative at governmental and historical society meetings. In 1893 Gibson is noted in the New York Tribune as leading the host or receiving party in a condolence ceremony. It also noted he made a living making lacrosse sticks. In 1895 Gibson was one of two tasked by the Council to revise a list of chiefs kept by the Council, a task he was again noted for in 1904. In 1908 Gibson led the condolence ceremony for naming a new chief. During this period a wide variety of Iroquois stories had been and were being gathered. Gibson was known to have traveled to Cattaraugus Reservation or Allegany Indian Reservation Iroquois communities to present the Code of Handsome Lake. He was quoted as saying, \\"Another generation and there will be no custom; still another generation and there will be no memory.\\" Gibson died in 1912 and is buried in the Onondaga Township Indian Cemetery. Three renditions of the Great Law of Peace Iroquois society features the Great Law of Peace, developed by Great Peacemaker as its central organizing system combining law, ritual, history, and religion. Oral presentations of the epic story are made on various special occasions, similar to ritual readings from the Declaration of Independence or the US Constitution, by socially recognized individuals who have the office of \\"Keeper\\". Among the best known \\"Keepers\\" of Gibson's era were himself and Seth Newhouse (1842-1921), also known as Da-yo-de-ka-ne. Part Mohawk, part Onondagan, and self-educated in the history and stories of the Iroquois, Newhouse took part in politics on the reserve through the Onondagan national council as a declared \\"Pine Tree Chief\\". In 1875, the action that caused Mohawk condemnation of the Onondagan national council also brought into question Newhouse's status as a chief. Regardless, Newhouse presented versions of the epic in the 1880s, hoping first that it would be written into Canadian law, and then recognized by the confederacy's central council. Newhouse also participated in a process of defining exactly who was and who wasn't a council chief, only to find himself deposed in January 1884. William N. Fenton describes Newhouse as a conservative Mohawk, responding to the realities of political life in the Six Nations reserve, where the influential Mohawks wanted to defend the traditional priority of the council but also sought reform in assigning chief positions based not on appointment by women leaders of clans but by popular vote, as well as a way to change the power structure of the council. Gibson, like Newhouse, was well known for his renditions of the epic story and law- telling, but unlike Newhouse he was concerned with preserving the narrative tradition and was a \\"great advocate\\" for the traditional council system of a fixed set of chief-offices appointed by women leaders of clans in each nation. Some see Gibson as a major traditional chief, though others regard him as less traditional and more innovative in systematizing traditions amongst the various nations' versions of the Great Law of Peace, and \\"inventing\\" a singular tradition based upon his learning of the epic from his old Onondagan teacher. =1899= Newhouse tried multiple times to have his rendition of the epic approved by the Grand River Council but failed in his last attempt in 1899. It was rejected, according to Fenton and Weaver, because Newhouse over- emphasized Mohawk prominence within the Iroquois confederacy. He assigned to the Mohawks priority in several ways: as the first tribe to accept the message of Great Peacemaker, as the tribe with veto authority in the council, as well as an overall priority given to the work of Hiawatha over that of Peacemaker himself. Others claimed that Newhouse had failed to understand the reality of the council to begin with. Gibson's first attempt at rendering the epic in the Onondagan language for publication was recorded and translated in 1899 by J. N. B. Hewitt, but not published until 1928, though segments were published in 1916 and 1944. Gibson's goal in delivering a rendition to Hewitt was possibly to have it circulate in the United States and impress upon the U.S. government to oppose the Canadian government's actions. Hewitt's notes were re-translated by William N. Fenton and Gibson's son Simeon in 1941, but their translation is only available through the Smithsonian archives, as well as those of the American Philosophical Society Library. The transliteration Hewitt made of the original language ran to 189 pages. Fenton and Vecsey both say that before the publication of the 1912 version in 1992, Hewitt's 1899 translation is the most satisfactory. While the text is not available for inspection on the internet, there are comments about it by Fenton: in the 1899 version the Great Peacemaker's canoe is made of white birch instead of white stone and his mother is Jigonsaseh (or Jigonhsasee), the \\"Peace Queen\\" and \\"Mother of Nations\\", generally accepted as a co-founder of the confederacy with Peacemaker and Hiawatha, although her presence in the story is affected by attitudes against women. Barbara Alice Mann examines the encounter with Jigonsaseh and Peacemaker's mission as part of a vegetarian-versus-carnivore approach to life and culture. In Gibson's 1899 version, the encounter with Jigonsaseh happens before meeting the cannibal; this episode where Jigonsaseh is the first to accept Peacemaker's revelation is the basis of why women get to appoint chiefs in traditional culture. Later, Jigonsaseh joins Peacemaker in crowning the first official chiefs of the Iroquois with antlers. In this first of Gibson's versions, the cannibal is Hiawatha; in the later 1900 version that will change to match Newhouse; and in the 1912 version the cannibal is unnamed and Hiawatha is among the Mohawks demanding Peacemaker go through an ordeal to prove he is sent by the Creator. The appearance of a cannibal in the story is controversial and even rejected by some, but most accept it. In the 1899 version, Hiawatha ‚Äì after setting aside his cannibal ways ‚Äì rescues Peacemaker from the river ordeal. All three versions include Hiawatha losing his daughters; and Hiawatha's episode with the lake and wampum come later and at Peacemaker's instruction. Overall, Gibson's first version has fewer story elements than his other versions and fewer than Newhouse's. However, it is generally considered the finest extant version written prior to the 1912 version that was translated in 1992. =1900= Gibson was the primary author of the \\"Chiefs' version\\" endorsed by the Council of Chiefs of the Six Nations of the Grand River reserve in counterpoint to Seth Newhouse's earlier version. It was rendered into English by the committee of the Council itself. It was later published, first by Duncan Campbell Scott in 1911, and then by Arthur C. Parker in 1916. The only significant difference between these two is that Parker's version included punctuation marks. Both incorporate the original introduction included with the version the council endorsed; however, the commentary about borrowing miraculous qualities from Christianity was introduced at a second meeting of the committee when Gibson was not present and some Christian chiefs were. Regardless of the introduction, Gibson's \\"Chiefs' version\\" was considered authoritative and Parker's publication has been echoed many times on the internet. The question arises that if the dispute between Christians and \\"Longhouse\\" traditionalist (whether Handsome Lake Code followers or not) Iroquois was essentially an internal matter, why did the Chiefs present it in English? The Superintendent of the Canadian Department of Indian Affairs was aware of the tensions in the Council and was against imposing external election mechanics upon the Iroquois, but was prevented from asserting his position by his supervisor. The Superintendent's inability to act coincided with a period of serious confrontation among some Iroquois over property. Confrontations were also taking place during protests over the possible imposition of the voting approach, with the shooting of Jake Fire May 1. A large part of Iroquois society wanted matters settled not by the Superintendent but by their Council. It is possible the Chiefs' version was presented in English to communicate both outwardly and inwardly the vitality and authenticity of the traditional processes. However, a theological difference between Gibson's 1899 rendition and his Chiefs' version reflects the effect Christian chiefs were having on the committee: in the 1899 version both Peacemaker and his message are portrayed as coming from the sky world, while the Chiefs' 1900 version has only the message and not Peacemaker coming from the sky world. =1912= The 1912 version Gibson gave in Onondagan was transcribed onto 525 pages by Alexander Goldenweiser. The version ultimately published is not complete ‚Äì some 14 pages of the original record are missing. Gibson died suddenly four months after offering the version to Goldenweiser. Goldenweiser himself never published a translation and in 1934 turned his notes over to Fenton. Fenton worked on a translation in consultation with Gibson's sons and others; Fenton referred to the results but never published his work on the translation itself, though Hanna Woodbury consulted his unpublished notes. Floyd Lounsbury also worked on a translation but only managed some 21 pages. Some unclarity in the notes required Woodbury to elicit the story from speakers between 1978 and 1990. Woodbury also had to deal with differences in the Onondaga language between New York and Six Nations speakers; she observed that the Six Nations Onondagan had more borrowed words from other Iroquois nations and that Gibson's original was closer to the New York dialect by her time. In addition, Woodbury believed that the exact context of the kinship relationships among the Iroquois nations has been lost since Gibson's use of the words, though the root meaning still implies relationships among speakers of Iroquois languages. Woodbury calls the 1912 version Gibson's \\"most mature understanding.\\" In 1924 the Canadian government finally imposed a system based on voting by the male Iroquois of the reserve, upsetting several Iroquois standards in the process.

It was built in 1884 and served a predominantly Czech Catholic parish until 1903. In 1980, it was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. History In 1859, brothers George and Parker V. Brown moved from Vermillion in the Dakota Territory to \\"a beautiful and sightly location ten miles [about 15 km] from Yankton\\", which they dubbed \\"Lakeport\\", and where they built a log hotel. In 1868, a group of Czechs living in Chicago established the Czech Agricultural Society, with the purpose of promoting Czech settlement in the regions west of Iowa and Minnesota. A year later, the organization's first expedition arrived in the vicinity of Yankton. Finding most of the land there already occupied, they moved further west, where some of them settled near Lakeport. There, they built the Church of St. John the Baptist, the Dakota Territory's first Czech Catholic church. In 1882, construction began on a new St. John the Baptist church, located closer to Lakeport. Since timber was scarce on the prairie, the church was built out of chalkrock, quarried from the banks of the Missouri River to the south. Construction took two years; the church was opened in 1884. After 1903, the church no longer had an assigned priest, and its parishioners moved to churches in Tabor, Lesterville, or Yankton. The church was essentially abandoned and began to deteriorate, despite some maintenance by local residents. After many years, a grant was secured from the South Dakota Historical Society to assist in the restoration of the building. In 1984, a Mass was held for the church's centennial; annual Masses were celebrated thereafter. In 1980, the church was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, under the name \\"Old Catholic Church\\". Architecture The church is built out of chalkrock blocks thick. It is a one-story building with a gable roof. There are tall narrow lancet windows on the sides of the building, half-story windows on the front and back, and ocular windows in the gable ends.

Biography Tyerman was born on 19 November 1773 at Clack farm, near Osmotherley, North Yorkshire, where his parents had resided for some time. In 1790 he obtained employment in London. Coming under strong religious convictions, he entered Hoxton Academy in 1795 to prepare himself for the congregational ministry. In 1798 he became minister at Cawsand in Cornwall, and thence removed to Wellington in Somerset. About 1804 he officiated for a short time at Southampton, and afterwards settled at Newport in the Isle of Wight. There he was one of the first projectors of the town reading-rooms, and filled the office of secretary of the Isle of Wight Bible Society. In 1821 Tyerman and George Bennet of Sheffield were appointed by the London Missionary Society to visit their southern stations. They sailed from London on 2 May in the whaler Tuscan, and, proceeding round Cape Horn, visited Tahiti, the Leeward and Sandwich Islands, and other mission stations in the South Seas. In 1824 they visited New South Wales, and on the way narrowly escaped from MƒÅori in New Zealand. From Sydney, in September 1824, they sailed through the Torres Straits to Java, and thence to Singapore, Canton, and Calcutta. At Serampore, on 3 May 1826, they met the venerable William Carey, who received them with much kindness. After visiting Benares, they sailed to Madras, and thence to Goa. From India they voyaged in 1827 to Mauritius and Madagascar, where the missions were firmly established under King Radama. On 30 July 1828 Tyerman, whose health had given way under the climate of southern India, died at Antananarivo. He was twice married: first, in 1798, to Miss Rich, by whom he had a son and daughter; and, secondly, in 1810, to Miss Fletcher of Abingdon, by whom he had two sons and a daughter.

It is located 22 km from Tirunelveli. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Devapiran and his consort Lakshmi as Karunthadankanni.. The temple is also classified as a Navatirupathi, the nine temples revered by Nammazhwar located in the banks of Tamiraparani river. Along with the Aravindalochanar temple located 100 yards away, the temple is referred as Irattai Tirupathy (meaning twin Tirupathis). This temple is a Ketu Sthalam. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. Unlike other South Indian temples, the temple does not have a rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 16th century. Devapiran is believed to have appeared to slay the demon Somuka who abducted the four Vedas. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day annual Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) and the Nammazhwar birth celebrations with Garudasevai with all nine temple of Navatirupathi, being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend As per Hindu legend, Somuka, a demon, defeated Brahma, the Hindu god of creation and stole the four Vedas (sacred texts) from him. Brahma was helpless and he did severe penance in the banks of Tamiraparani River seeking favour from Vishnu in the form of Devapiran. Pleased by the penance, Vishnu appeared to Brahma and promised to retrieved the Vedas. He killed the demon Somuka and restored the Vedas to Brahma. He also wished to set his abode as Srivakuntam and resided there as Vaikuntanatha. As per another legend, the place finds mention in Brahmanda Purana and Padma Purana where it is called Kedara Nilaya. Once a sage named Suprabha wanted to perform penance and in his search for land, he ploughed at this place. He found a balance (tola) and a bow (vil), which, when he lifted, turned into a couple. The couple were cursed by Kubera once for insulting them. Since the bow and balance were redeemed to their original form, the place is called Tolavillimangalam. The sage Suprabha continued to perform penance, at the end of which, the Devas received the share of offering (Havibhaga). Vishnu was pleased by the devotion of the sage and since he appeared with Devas, he came to be known as Devapiram. History Image of the vimana, the roof of the sanctum There are six inscriptions in the temple deciphered by the Archaeological Department. The inscription from a ruler named Konerimaikondan records a gift of five velis of land as a tax free gift to the temple. The temple also obtained grant for building and maintenance of a garden from a ruler who defeated the Cheras. The Pandya ruler Jatavarman Kulasekaran I (1190‚Äì1216 CE) also offered a similar grant to the temple. Maravarman Sundara Pandyan (1216‚Äì1238) made offerings to perpetual lighting of the temple. An inscription from his reign also indicates the installation of the shrine of Karunthadankanni. Vira Pandyan IV (1309‚Äì1345) offered land to the temple to perform special poojas in the temple during his birthday in the Tamil month of Vaikasi. During 1801, the temple acted as a fort for the British against the forces of Veerapandiya Kattabomman (1790‚Äì99). It is believed that the marks of war were visible in the temple during modern times. An official of the Madurai Nayak rule, Vadamalayappa Pillai arranged for the installation of Dasavathara images and Thiruvenkamudayan hall. There were also lot of offerings in jewels and kind made to the temple during his period. There were other people like Pillai Perumal, Ellarukum Nallan and Chockalingam, who made similar grants. The wooden chariot with minute sculptures were installed by Paramasivan Pillai during modern times. Architecture thumb The temple occupies an area of and is surrounded by a granite wall long and broad. Unlike other South Indian temples, the temple does not have a rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines and two of its three bodies of water. The temple has five precincts. The sanctum houses the image of Devapiran in standing posture. The image is made of Saligrama stone and ablution is usually done with milk. The hall preceding the sanctum, the Artha Mandapam houses the festival image of Kallapiran made of panchaloha with the images of Sridevi and Bhudevi on either of his sides. It is believed that the sculptor caressed the cheeks of the image with his hand as he got enchanted by the image and it is seen in the image. The Ardha mandapa is guarded by two Dwarapalas on either sides. There are two shrines for the two consorts of Vishnu, Caikunta Nayaki and Chorantha Nayaki, both facing each other. There are separate shrines for Senai Mudaliyar, Garuda, Venugopala, Manavalamamunigal and Yoga Narasimha. There is another shrine that houses the images of the ten avatars of Vishnu, the Dasavatharam. The Mahamandapa and the Swarga Madapa are believed to be later additions. The Dwajastamba mandap has pillars with refined architectural features. The temple maintains an elephant, which is housed in the hall close to the temple flagstaff. Religious significance thumb Brahmanda Purana one of the eighteen sacred texts of Hinduism and written by Veda Vyasa contains a chapter called Navathirupathi Mahatmeeyam that describes all the nine temples of Navatirupathi. The Devapiran temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Nammazhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The temple is also classified as a Navatirupathi, the nine temples revered by Nammazhwar located in the banks of Tamiraparani river. Nammazhwar makes a reference about the temple in his works in Thirvaimozhi. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. The temple also forms a series of Navagraha temples where each of the nine planetary deities is associated with one of the Navatirupathi temples. The temple is associated with Ketu, a snake planet. Along with the Aravindalochanar temple located 100 yards away, the temple is referred as Irattai Tirupathy (meaning twin Tirupathis). Festival The Garuda Sevai utsavam(festival) in the month of Vaikasi(May-Jun) witnesses nine Garudasevai, a large event in which festive images from the Nava Tirupathi shrines in the area are brought on Garuda vahana(sacred vehicle) to Alwarthirunagari Temple. An idol of Nammalvar is also brought on an Anna Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these 9 temples are recited. The utsavar(festival deity) of Nammalvar is taken in a palanquin to each of the nine temples, through the paddy fields in the area. The paasurams(poems) dedicated to each of the nine Divyadesams are chanted in the respective shrines. This is the most important of the festivals in this area, and it draws thousands of visitors. The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Pancharathra aagama. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:30 a.m., Uchikalam at 11:30 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Aravanai Pooja between 8:00 \\\\- 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Devapiran and Karunthadankanni. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.

Early life Moira Dunbar was born in 1918 in Edinburgh, Scotland. She grew up in Stornoway, Strathpeffer, and Kilmarnock, and attended Cranley School for Girls. Dunbar studied geography at St Anne's College of the University of Oxford, completing her Bachelor of Arts in 1939. During World War II, she travelled around the United Kingdom with a theatre troupe as an actor and stage manager. Career Dunbar emigrated to Canada in 1947 and found work with the Joint Intelligence Bureau, where she studied Arctic ice movement. In 1952 she joined the Defence Research Board in the position of Scientific Staff Officer in the Arctic Research Section. She specialised in sea ice and navigation through frozen Arctic waters. In 1954, she applied to join the crew of scientists on a Royal Canadian Navy icebreaker travelling to the Arctic, but her request was denied as women could not be posted on naval vessels. She continued making requests until she was given permission to join an icebreaker with the Department of Transport in 1955. She thus became the first woman to conduct scientific research from Canadian icebreakers. She served on numerous icebreakers and spent 560 hours on Royal Canadian Air Force aircraft, studying ice formations in the High Arctic. She was among the first women to fly over the North Pole. While upon the icebreakers, she utilized the sideways-looking radar for airborne reconnaissance, figuring out how the ice moved through the process of photographing the ice at different times during the night and year. Her analysis of the ice conditions and measurement of the various pictures allowed her to determine the ice‚Äôs position at different times of the year. Dunbar was also a crucial fighter in the Cold War, as her pictures allowed maps of the Arctic to be created. Knowing how ice moved was important information for navigation and defense strategy. Dunbar went on many research excursions varying from flying with the RCAF and traveling on icebreakers. The combined knowledge and experience she gained enabled her to publish numerous papers on Arctic sea ice, and in 1956 she co-authored Arctic Canada from the Air with Keith Greenaway, a navigator with the Royal Canadian Air Force. Dunbar and Greenway's book was an early work in the field of observing sea ice through airborne photography. In her other papers, Dunbar studied the use of radar remote sensing in sea-ice research, promoted the standardisation of sea-ice terminology, and wrote historical accounts of Arctic exploration. She investigated icebreaking methods in the Soviet Union and Finland in 1964, and was an adviser to Arctic hovercraft trials in 1966‚Äì1969. In 1971, Dunbar won the Meteorological Service of Canada's Centennial Award. In 1972 she was awarded the Royal Canadian Geographical Society's Massey Medal for \\"her excellent work in arctic geography and sea ice\\"; she is the only woman to have won the medal. She was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1977. She also served as governor of the Arctic Institute of North America and director of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. Dunbar retired in 1978 and died on 22 November 1999, at the age of 81.

It is located 10 km from Tirunelveli. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is a storehouse of Nayak architecture. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 16th century. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day annual Vaikunta Ekadasi during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January). The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. History Sculptures in the temple There is one inscription in the temple and five copper plates from the 16th century indicating various grants to the temple. It is understood from the inscriptions that the temple was built by Krishnappa Nayak (1563‚Äì72), the son of Viswanatha Nayak, the founder of Madurai Nayak dynasty. Krishnappa is attributed to the construction of the precincts around the temple and the soaring temple tower. Krishnappa Nayak also laid four streets around the temple for the smooth passing of the temple car. The village was originally named Thiruvenkatapuram and got changed to Krishnapuram during the rule of Krishanppa Nayak. Deivachillayar (Mayilerum perumal), the son-in-law of the minister of Viswanatha, played a key role in the construction of the temple. Detailed account of his work in the temple is extolled in Deivachillayar vidu thoothu by Kumaraswamy Avadaniyar and also in the History of Tinnelvelly by Caldwell. The copper plates from Sadasiva Raya of Vijayanagara Empire indicate grants to light lamps perpetually and lay gardens. There were six villages to allow the continuous functioning of the temple. The villages Ariyakulam, Kodikulam, Kuthukaval, Puthaneri, Pottukalam, Sriramakulam and Alikudi were donated to the temple for the performance of daily poojas. An Agraharam with housing for 108 Brahmin families well-versed in Vedas and agamas was established. The temple was originally administered as a subtemple of Ramaswamy temple of Tirunelveli, but came under the administration of Nelliappar temple from 1973. It came under the dominion of Tiruchendur Devastanam from 1986. Architecture Pillared hall in the temple The temple occupies an area of and is surrounded by a granite walls. The temple had originally three precincts, the outer one of which was demolished by Chanda Sahib at the orders of Nawab of Arcot. The stones were used to build the fort at Palayamkottai. The five tiered rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is tall. The sanctum houses the image of Venkatachalapathy in standing posture is made of granite sporting four arms. Two of his arms hold the conch and Chakra, while the other two sport Abayamudra and Kadahasta. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are located on either of his side. The festive image is called Srinivasan and the image has identical features as that of the presiding deity. The Ardha mandapa is guarded by two Dwarapalas on either sides. There is a separate shrine of Alamelumangai in the third precinct, which also houses the festival image. There are many halls in the temple namely the Pandal mantap, Vahana mandap, Ranga Mandap an Nanguneri Jeeyar mandap. The Pandal mandap has pillars replete with architectural features displaying pushpaboikai, palagai and varikolam. The Unjal mandap is designed to accommodate the swing for the festival deities. The square shaped Vasantha mandap has Navarang style. The temple houses rare sculptures from the Nayak period in the Veerappa Nayak Mandap. There are exquisite carvings in the pillars and life size images indicating various legends of Hindu Puranas. The Jeeyar mandap houses lot of pillars with images of ladies hold lamps as in Kerala temples. The seer of temples used to rest at this place during festivals. The Sorga vasal (gateway to heaven) is located to the west of Yagasalai Mandap and is open only during the ten-day Vaikunta Ekadasi festival. Manimandap has numerous pillars with sculptures of elephants and yalis. The composite columns of Virabhadra holding sword and horn are found be additions of the Vijayanayagara kings during the early 1500s. Similar columns of Virabhadra are found in Adikesava Perumal Temple at Thiruvattaru, Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli, Kasi Viswanathar temple at Tenkasi, Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram, Soundararajaperumal temple at Thadikombu, Srivilliputhur Andal temple, Srivaikuntanathan Permual temple at Srivaikuntam, Avudayarkovil, Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungudivalli Nachiar temple at Thirukkurungudi. Festival The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Pancharathra aagama. It is inferred from the inscriptions that the temple priests performed pooja five times a day during the 16th century, strictly following agamic tradition. In modern times, the temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple had originally received endownments to perform the eleven-day annual Brahmotsavam festival, ending with Teppotsavam, the float festival.

Legend and history As per another legend, there was a fight between the Devas and Asuras (demon) during the chruning of Ocean of Milk for Amrita, the ambrosia. Asuras were able to overpower Devas at one point of time and the Devas sought the rescue from Vishnu. Vishnu appeared as Mohini to lure the asuras and gave them empty pot. While churning the ocean of milk, there were a lot of divine elements like Kamadhenu that appeared. During one part of the churning, poisonous gases began to emnate and both the asuras and devas were seeking rescue from Shiva in his abode at Kailasa. Shiva appeared and drank the poison and while gulping the contents, Parvathi grabbed his throat and the poison remained in his throat. Since Shiva drank the poison (called Nanju), he came to be referred as Nanjundeswarar. While the exact history of the temple could not be ascertained, the copper plate inscriptions in the temple from 1479 indicate grant of village named Poosarpalaym to the Brahmins. The endowment was made by Iswara Deva Raja, the general of Krishnadeva Raya. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Architecture Designs in the walls around the sanctum A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower. The sanctum of the temple is believed to have been carved out in a single stone. The image of Nanjundeswarar in the form of Lingam is housed in the sanctum. It is made of granite and appears red in colour. The northern part of the temple houses the image of Ulaganayagi, the consort of Nanjundeswarar. The vimana, the shrine over the sanctum of Nanjundeswarar is similar to the ones in North Indian temples, with a spiral structure. The metal image of Chandrasekara is unique that the full image of Ganga is sculpted unlike the other temples where Shiva is sported with cresecent alone. The shrine also houses the images of Vinayaka, Subramanya, Veerabhadra, Rishabandika, Palani Andavar, Mahishasuramardini, Anjaneya and Nataraja on the walls. Shiva in one of the sculptures is portrayed as a hunter, while Parvathi as a dancer. The Vinayaka idol is sported with one of his legs bent, while image of Kali is sported with a dancing posture. There are sculptures depicting Machavallabha emerging out of fish, soldier armed with sword and a goat worshipping Shiva. There are also sculptures of live creatures like cow, goat, elephant, swan, fish, snake, yali, horse, pig, tiger and bull. Similar to the Meenakshi Amman temple, there are six elephants guarding the sactum of Nanjundeswarar. There are miniature sculptures of Rishabaruda, Balasubramanya, Kali, Brahma and Lakshmi Narayana on both sides of the elephants. The image of Subramanya is sported with twelve arms. Festival The shrine around the sanctum The temple follows Saivite tradition. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple is open from 6am - 12 pm and 4-8:30 pm on all days except during new moon days when it is open the full day. The Ranganathaswamy temple is present in the same campus and the water for daily rituals is taken from the same tank for both the temples. During a yearly festival the festival image of Ranganathar is brought to the Nanjundeswarar temple for an event called Ambu yerithal. The Shivaratri festival during the Tamil month of Vaiakasi (May - June) and Annabishekam in Aippasi (October - November) being the most prominent. During the tenth day of Navratri festival, the festival image of Nanjundeswarar (a form of Shiva) and Ranganathaswamy temple, Karamadai (a form of Vishnu) are sported together fighting demons with bow and arrow. The union of Shiva and Vishnu in such a form is one of its kind in Tamil Nadu.

Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu, during 1991-96. Jaya Publication and Sasi Enterprises, the companies in which J. Jayalalithaa and her aide V. K. Sasikala had holdings, purchased lands of Tamil Nadu Small Industries Corporation (TANSI), a state government agency, in 1992. The case was filed by Subramanian Swamy and chargesheet were filed during the following DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) government headed by M. Karunanidhi in 1996. Jayalalitha and her aide, Sasikala were convicted in the lower court, which sentenced her to two year rigorous imprisonment and fined 50,000 on 9 October 2000. The case had political implications as Jayalalithaa was disqualified from contesting the 2001 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election. Though Jayalalithaa's nomination papers were rejected, she took oath as chief minister after the victory of AIADMK in the elections. The Supreme Court disqualified her in September 2001, resulting in her stepping down and elevation of O. Panneerselvam as the chief minister. The governor of Tamil Nadu, Fathima Beevi, who administered oath to J. Jayalalithaa, was advised to step down by the union ministry, who also sent the report to the President of India. The Madras High Court acquitted her and other five accused in the case of all the charges on 4 December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld the order of Madras High Court on 24 November 2003 on grounds of lack of evidence. She came back to power winning the 2002 Tamil Nadu assembly by-election from Andipatti constituency in March 2002. Background Jayalalithaa Jayaram (born 24 February 1948), commonly referred to as J. Jayalalithaa, was an Indian politician and six time Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu during various times from 24 June 1991 ‚Äì 12 May 1996, 14 May 2001 ‚Äì 21 September 2001, 2 March 2002 ‚Äì 12 May 2006, 16 May 2011 ‚Äì 27 September 2014, 23 May 2015 ‚Äì 22 May 2016, 23 May 2016 ‚Äì 5 December 2016. Jaya Publication and Sasi Enterprises, the companies in which Jayalalithaa and Sasikala had holdings, purchased lands of Tamil Nadu Small Industries Corporation (TANSI), a state government agency, in 1992. The companies bought land and building belonging to TANSI, which was quoted to be 35 crores less than the market price. The chargesheet filed during 1996 stated that the purchase of foundry property caused a loss of 2.28 crores and enamel wire factory caused a loss of 58.8 lakh to the state exchequer. Trial The case was filed by Subramanian Swamy in the Madras trial court. The trial court framed charges against her and five others on 10 June 1999. The Madras Court discharged her from the case on 13 January 2000, but based on the leave petition filed by the state government, the court ordered her to face the trial. She was convicted of criminal conspiracy by the trial court on 9 October 2000, sentencing her to two year rigorous imprisonment in the two cases and fined 50,000. She was sentenced under Sections 120-B (for punishment of criminal conspiracy) and 409 (for criminal breach of trust by public servant or by banker, merchant or agent) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Sections 13 (2) and 13 (1)(c) and (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA). While Jayalalithaa and Sasikala were sentenced as the first and second accused, four others, namely, the former Chairman and Managing Director of TANSI T.R. Srinivasan, former Rural Industries Minister Mohammed Asif, former Special Deputy Collector (Stamps) S. Nagarajan and Jayalalitha's former Additional Secretary R. Karpoorasundarapandian, were sentenced to two years rigorous imprisonment and levied a fine of 10,000 each in the Jaya Publications case. The six were sentenced in the Sasi Enterprises case as well and similar sentence was awarded. In November 2000, the Madras Court stayed the conviction, but still debarred her from contesting the state assembly elections in 2001. Political implications The AIADMK party swept the poll in 2001 and though she was disqualified from contesting, she was sworn in as the Chief Minister. There was an appeal in Supreme Court against her appointment as Chief minister quoting a convicted person cannot hold government office. K. Venugopal appeared as counsel for Jayalalithaa and Sasikala, while Venkatapathy acted as the public prosecutor. While the prosecutor sought further time to study the case, the court went ahead with the hearing of the appellate. K. Venugopal argued that there was no impropriety with Jayalalithaa continuing as Chief minister as it was a large scale people's mandate that wanted her as the chief minister. On 21 September 2001, a five member bench of the Supreme Court ordered that a disqualified person cannot hold office of the Chief minister. The judges quoted that people's mandate cannot overrule constitution. The governor of Tamil Nadu, Fathima Beevi, who administered oath to Jayalalithaa, was advised to step down by the union ministry, who also sent the report to the President of India. It was a rare case of a constitutional functionary being removed from power for omission of duties. She resigned before she could be called back by the central government on 1 July 2001 and her resignation was accepted and C. Rangarajan, the then governor of neighbouring state Andhra Pradesh was given additional charge as governor of Tamil Nadu. Following the disqualification of Jayalalithaa as Chief minister, media reported various front runners for the post. There were no clear names emerging. Subsequently, at a meeting of AIADMK, O. Panneerselvam was chosen as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. On 4 December 2001, the Madras High Court acquitted her of all the charges on the TANSI land acquisition. She contested the Andipatti assembly constituency and was sworn-in again as the Chief Minister. The Supreme Court reserved the orders of the lower court against the leave petition filed by DMK party counsel against the lower court verdict. Subramaniya Swami appealed against her acquittal in the lower court in the Supreme Court of India, which again acquitted her from the two cases on 24 November 2003 ruling that though there is strong suspicion about her involvement in the case, there was no legal evidence to prove her guilt. The judge also ordered \\"She must atone her conscience in the whole controversy\\". It was later reported that she returned the land to the agency at throwaway price. Aftermath Jayalalithaa came back to power winning the 2002 Tamil Nadu assembly by-election from Andipatti constituency. Politicians believe that the outcome of the case along with the other cases filed by the DMK government against her resulted in a political vendetta between the ruling AIADMK and the opposition DMK parties. After assuming power, the Jayalalithaa government filed a slew of corruption cases against the DMK government ministers who were in office from 1996 - 2001. Karunanidhi, the leader of DMK and ex-chief minister was arrested in an alleged flyover construction scam. The arrest created a controversy in the state as the videotapes of the arrest were telecast live by Sun TV, the channel run by Karunanidhi's nephew. The ruling AIADMK government also transferred all the officials who were seen close to the previous government.

The charges and countercharges of fraud and misappropriation of millions of dollars, ensuing legal battles, and John-le-Carr√©-like plots involving private detectives, Mexican prisons, night-club dancers, US Congressmen, suspicious deaths, and the US Supreme Court, were covered in over 2,000 articles published in the US, China, Australia, India, and many other countries around the world. Early life Mao Bangchu was born in Shanghai, China, in 1904. His ancestral hometown is Fenghua, Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. His mother was the older sister of Mao Fumei, the first wife of Chiang Kai- shek, and mother of Chiang Ching-kuo.\\"The Last Empress: Madame Chiang Kai-shek and the Birth of Modern China,\\" by Hannah Pakula, Simon and Schuster (3 November 2009), pp. xvi, 285, 286, 612, 613 Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Republic of China between 1928 and 1975, was born in 1887 in Xikou, a town approximately 30 kilometers (19 mi) southwest of downtown Ningbo.

By the end of the 19th century it had become one of the first multinational corporations, with offices around the world. Military career Mao graduated from the 3rd class of China's Whampoa Military Academy in 1927. The academy was established in 1924 by the Kuomintang (KMT) with funds and support from the Soviet Union. Soviet officers initially focused their teaching on basic infantry topics and provided special classes for artillery, engineering, communication, logistical and machine gun units.

Further enhancing his standing with Chiang Kai-shek, Mao commanded the air assaults on a rebellious, heavily-fortified city in the Fujian Province, in 1934. The successful assault proved crucial for Chiang's ground forces to take control of the city. Subsequently, as member of the National Government Aviation Committee, Mao was sent to the United States to explore the purchase of new airplanes for the Chinese air force. While he attend an airshow in Miami, Florida, he met Captain Claire Chennault, who let a demonstration by the Army Air Corps. Impressed by his skills, Mao invited him to come to China. On 25 May 1940, Mao was promoted to major general, and in 1941 he helped Captain Chennault to established the 1st American Volunteer Group (AVG) of the Chinese Air Force. Under the leadership of Chennault the AVG successfully engaged the Japanese air force on many occasions and became famous as the so-called \\"Flying Tigers.\\" The Flying Tigers were also instrumental in establishing an alternate supply route over \\"The Hump,\\" a connection between Burma and southern Chinese cities, such as Kunming and Chengdu.

In the end, General Mow was imprisoned in the Black Palace of Lecumberri, in a prison cell next to Leon Trotsky assassin Ram√≥n Mercader, from 1951 until 1955.

Certain aspect of the case are still of legal relevance today. For example, General Mow defended his position by claiming that Chiang Kai-shek was not the rightful president of Taiwan and hence could not have ordered him to come back or file a lawsuit on behalf of the Chinese people in US courts. The Supreme Court ruled that it is within the purview of the US President, represented by the State Department, to approve ambassadors and recognizes foreign governments.\\"Pang Tsu Mow and Ve Shuen Hslang, Petitioners, V. Republic of China. U.S. Supreme Court Transcript of Record with Supporting Pleadings\\", Irene Kennedy, Chauncey Belknap, U.S. Supreme Court Records, 28 Oct 2011 - 54 page. At that time the State Department had provided a letter to the court stating that Chiang-Kai-Check is the recognized president of Taiwan, and Wellington Koo the recognized ambassador of Taiwan in the US. The Supreme Court recently affirmed this general position, when it struck down a law enacted by Congress, but opposed by President Obama, that would let American citizens born in Jerusalem have Israel listed in passports as their country of birth.

For example, in this case, General Mow had countersued Chiang Kai-shek for defamation and the National City Bank of America, sued by the Republic of China for not releasing funds deposited by General Mow, countersute the Republic of China for recovery of lost funds. The courts held that such countersuites are only narrowly allowed if they directly impact the matter put forward by the suing foreign government.348 U.S. 356, 75 S.Ct. 423, 99 L.Ed. 389, The NATIONAL CITY BANK OF NEW YORK, Petitioner, v.

When the war with Japan broke out in 1937, the family moved to Chongqing, which had become Chiang Kai-shek's provisional capital. As a general's family they \\"lived lavishly, in a large house guarded by a squad of soldiers.\\" By the end of the war with Japan, in 1945, the family was living in Chengdu from where they undertook a long boat journey down the Yangtze River to Shanghai in 1946. At that time, the city was still held by Chiang's forces, but Communist troops were starting to encircle the city. By 1948, Pauline and her 6 sons were evacuated from mainland China to Taiwan, together with some 2 million people, consisting mainly of members of the ruling Kuomintang, intellectual and business elites, and soldiers. In March 1949, the family briefly returned to Shanghai to board the last Pan Am flight to the U.S. before the city fell to the Communists.Los Angeles Times, \\"Back to His Future,\\" by Evelyn Iritani 28 September 1997 (The oldest son, David, was a pilot in the National Chinese Air Force, and stayed in Taiwan.

After General Mow had fled to Mexico in early 1951, Pauline and her sons had to vacate their diplomatic housing in Washington, DC, and settled in Great Neck, New York. Without the support of General Mow, unable to return to Taiwan, not willing to move back to mainland China under communist control, and not being American citizens, the family struggled. They opened a Chinese restaurant, the Yangtze River Cafe, to provide some income. Luckily several of the Mow brothers had already been enrolled in a private boarding school (Riverdale Country School in Riverdale, NY), which agreed to waive the enrollment fees once the family fell on hard times.

Obbink: the fragment of papyrus on which the Brothers Poem was discovered The Brothers Poem or Brothers Song is a series of lines of verse attributed to the archaic Greek poet Sappho ( ‚Äì ), which had been lost since antiquity until being rediscovered in 2014. Most of its text, apart from its opening lines, survives. It is known only from a papyrus fragment, comprising one of a series of poems attributed to Sappho. It mentions two of her brothers, Charaxos and Larichos; the only known mention of their names in Sappho's writings, though they are known from other sources. These references, and aspects of the language and style, have been used to establish her authorship. The poem is structured as an address‚Äîpossibly by Sappho herself‚Äîto an unknown person. The speaker chastises the addressee for saying repeatedly that Charaxos will return (possibly from a trading voyage), maintaining that his safety is in the hands of the gods and offering to pray to Hera for his return. The narrative then switches focus from Charaxos to Larichos, who the speaker hopes will relieve the family of their troubles when he becomes a man. Scholars tend to view the poem's significance more in historical rather than in literary terms. Research focuses on the identities of the speaker and the addressee, and their historical groundings. Other writers examine the poem's worth in the corpus of Sappho's poetry, as well as its links with Greek epic, particularly the homecoming stories of the Odyssey. Various reconstructions of the missing opening stanzas have been offered. Preservation Sappho is thought to have written around 10,000 lines of poetry, of which roughly 650 survive. Only one poem, the Ode to Aphrodite, is known to be complete; many preserve only a single word. In 2014, Dirk Obbink, Simon Burris, and Jeffrey Fish published five fragments of papyrus, containing nine separate poems by Sappho. Three were previously unknown, and the find amounted to the largest expansion of the surviving corpus of Sappho's work for 92 years. The most impressive is the \\"Brothers Poem\\" fragment, called P. Sapph. Obbink, part of a critical edition of Book I of Sappho's poetry. The next nine lines are known as Sappho's Kypris poem. P. Sapph. Obbink measures Carbon-dating places it in the period from the first to third centuries AD, which is consistent with the third century AD handwriting. The roll, of which P. Sapph. Obbink was part, would have been produced in Alexandria, and likely taken to Fayum. There is evidence that the roll was damaged and repaired; it was later reused as cartonnage‚Äîa material similar to papier-m√¢ch√© made with linen and papyrus‚Äîwhich Obbink suggests was used as a book cover. P. Sapph. Obbink is, according to author and scholar James Romm, the best-preserved extant Sappho papyrus. It had been part of David Moore Robinson's collection, left to the University of Mississippi Library. Robinson purchased the fragment in 1954 from an Egyptian dealer, Sultan Maguid Sameda, the owner of an art gallery in Cairo. After the library had deaccessioned the papyrus, it was sold at auction in 2011 to a collector in London. It was this anonymous owner who gave Obbink, the head of Oxford University's Oxyrhynchus Papyri project, access to the papyrus and permission to publish it. A second papyrus, Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 2289, published by Edgar Lobel in 1951, preserves enough of the Brothers Poem to show that at least one stanza preceded the well-preserved portion. As with all of Sappho's poetry, the Brothers Poem was originally performed to music, though the melody does not survive. Aristoxenus reports that Sappho used the mixolydian mode, and in antiquity she was associated with the barbitos (a stringed instrument similar to the lyre); based on this information, Armand D'Angour has set the poem to music in an attempt to reconstruct what it might have sounded like in antiquity. Poem =Content= A Roman sculpture of Sappho, based on a Classical Greek model. The inscription reads Œ£ŒëŒ†Œ¶Œ© ŒïŒ°ŒïŒ£ŒôŒë, or \\"Sappho of Eresos\\". The poem is 20 lines (five stanzas) long and written in Sapphic stanzas, a metre named after Sappho, which is composed of three long lines followed by one shorter line. The beginning of the poem is lost, but it is estimated that the complete work was probably between one and three stanzas longer. It lies within the genre of homecoming prayers; others of Sappho's works on this theme include fragments 5, 15 and 17. The narrative consists of an address to an unnamed listener, structured in two parallel sections, concerning two of Sappho's brothers, Charaxos and Larichos. The speaker hopes that Charaxos will return successfully from a trading voyage, and that Larichos will grow into manhood, and take up his position among the elites of society in Lesbos. The first two extant stanzas detail Charaxos' arrival. In the first, the speaker reproaches the addressee for repeatedly saying that Charaxos will return \\"with his ship full\\",Sappho, Brothers Poem, l.2. trans. that only gods can know such things,Sappho, Brothers Poem, ll.2‚Äì4. trans. and that the addressee should send her to pray to Hera for Charaxos' safe return. The third and fourth stanzas develop into a more general examination of human dependence on gods. The speaker asserts that while human fortunes are changeable (\\"fair winds swiftly follow harsh gales\\")Sappho, Brothers Poem, ll.11‚Äì12. trans. Zeus gives good fortune to those he favours. In the final stanza, the speaker hopes that Larichos will \\"[lift] his head high\\"Sappho, Brothers Poem, l.17. trans. and \\"become an Œ±ŒΩŒµœÅ [man] in all senses\\", as Obbink puts it, and release the family from its troubles. =Authorship= When Obbink published the poem in 2014, he attributed it to Sappho based on its metre, dialect (Aeolic), and mentions of Charaxos and Larichos, both of whom are identified in other sources as her brothers. It is possible that the text is an ancient forgery; though the song was included in at least some Hellenistic editions of Sappho (from which P. Sapph. Obbink and P. Oxy. 2289 derive), a classical imitation of Sappho is still possible. Nonetheless, evidence provided by Herodotus indicates that Charaxos was mentioned in poems that were attributed to Sappho during the fifth century BC; therefore it is likely to be at least authentically from archaic Lesbos. =Characters= Neither of the two characters are named. Whether the speaker can be identified with Sappho herself is central to its interpretation. Andr√© Lardinois observes that most of the identified speakers in Sappho's poetry are female. Melissa Mueller identifies the speaker as Sappho, and the poem has generally been interpreted as being autobiographical. Not all scholars have identified the speaker with the historical Sappho; B√§r and Eva Stehle both argue that the speaker is a fictionalised or literary version of Sappho. If the speaker is to be identified as Sappho, Obbink suggests that she is to be read as a young woman: her brother Larichos (who can only be six or so years younger than her, as that is how old she was when her father died, in a biographical tradition preserved in Ovid's Heroides) is shortly to come of age (Obbink puts him at around twelve); Sappho-the-speaker is therefore still a teenager herself. The addressee of the poem is unnamed in the surviving text, but many suggestions have been made as to their identity‚ÄîCamillo Neri lists eleven possible candidates. Obbink suggests the most likely candidates are Rhodopis or Doricha, described in ancient sources as the lover of Charaxos, and Sappho's mother, to whom Sappho addressed other poems. Most scholars agree that the addressee is some concerned friend or relative of Charaxos, many (including Martin L. West, Franco Ferrari, Camillo Neri, and Leslie Kurke) selecting Sappho's mother as the most likely option. This is not universally agreed upon. The classical historian Anton Bierl argues that the central dispute of the poem is between masculine and feminine ideologies. He suggests that the speaker's offer to pray to Hera is a \\"solution appropriate to her gender\\", and contrasts with the masculine belief that the family's problems can be solved through Charaxos' pursuit of wealth. He therefore suggests that the addressee is a male relative of Sappho. Lardinois also believes that the addressee is a man: he argues that Sappho's mother could have gone to pray to Hera herself, and therefore it does not make sense for her to send Sappho on her behalf. In contrast, Mueller and Leslie Kurke both argue that the addressee is probably meant to be female, based on Sappho's use of the word (\\"chattering\\" or \\"babbling\\") to describe their speech. The word has negative connotations that would make Sappho unlikely to use it to address a man. Anja Bettenworth has argued that the addressee is of a lower social status than Sappho, again based on the use of , but Kurke argues they are likely to be in a position of authority over Sappho, as she expects them to send her to pray to Hera. The final two characters, Charaxos and Larichos, are identified as Sappho's brothers in ancient sources. Charaxos is first mentioned by Herodotus, who describes his love for the courtesan Rhodopis; Strabo and Athenaeus say that he was a wine trader. The earliest mention of Larichos comes from Athenaeus, who says that in his youth he was a wine-pourer in the prytaneion (town hall) in Mytilene. Modern scholars are uncertain whether either were Sappho's actual brothers. For instance, Lardinois sees Charaxos and Larichos as fictional characters: he draws comparisons to the poetry of Archilochus about Lycambes and his daughters, generally considered to be fictionalised. =Context= Sappho's poetry from the first book of the Alexandrian edition appears to have been about either the family and religious or cultic practices, or about passion and love. The Brothers Poem focuses on her family. Its original performance context is uncertain, but most scholars consider that it was intended for monodic performance‚Äîthat is, by a single singer, rather than a chorus. Brotherhood was a frequent theme of archaic Greek poetry, and the relationship between brothers was often used to explore conceptions of proper behaviour. The Brothers Poem seems to have been one of several about Charaxos and Larichos. Eva Stehle suggests that it may have been part of a \\"series of 'brothers poems'\\", though David Gribble notes that the fragments of Sappho's work which do survive are insufficient to conclude that she composed a series telling the story of Charaxos' relationship with Doricha. Sappho portrays Charaxos as irresponsible, with Larichos as his more respectable foil. Unlike in the versions of this trope in Homer and Hesiod, Sappho inserts a third, female, figure into the relationship. In this scheme, the figure with moral authority is unable to be the moral example to the wayward Charaxos due to her gender; she must rely on Larichos who still has the potential to become an upstanding adult. Thus, Laura Swift sees the poem as an example of Sappho reworking established epic tropes from a female perspective‚Äîas she also does in fragment 16. Anton Bierl identifies seven other fragments of Sappho that seem to have dealt with Charaxos or Doricha. Like the Brothers Poem, fragments 5, 15, and 17 focus on homecomings; fragments 5 and 15 are both likely to be about Charaxos, and Bierl suggests that fragment 17, a cultic hymn referring to Menelaus' visit to Lesbos on his way home from Troy, may be a prayer for a safe journey for Charaxos. Four other surviving fragments of Sappho, 3, 7, 9, and 20, may all have been connected with the story of Charaxos and Doricha. The Brothers Poem follows shortly after fragment 5 in the edition of Sappho preserved by P. Sapph. Obbink, with probably only one column of text between them. Silvio B√§r argues that the poem was deliberately positioned here because it was seen as a sort of continuation of that fragment by the editor of the Alexandrian edition of Sappho's poetry. He suggests that it acts to correct the views put forward in fragment 5: there, Sappho prays to the Nereids, not just for the safe return of her brother but that \\"whatever his heart desires be fulfilled\\";Sappho, 5.3‚Äì4. trans. in the Brothers Poem she recognises that such a broad request is out of the competence of the Nereids and should more properly be addressed to the goddess Hera. The role of the speaker (possibly Sappho herself) in the Brothers Poem has been compared to that of Penelope in the Odyssey; she awaits the return of Charaxos just as Penelope (depicted here by Heva Coomans) waits for her husband Odysseus. Links between Homer's Odyssey and the Brothers Poem have been observed by many scholars. B√§r describes the epic as a \\"crucial intertext\\" for the Brothers Poem. The relationship in the poem between the speaker, Charaxos, and Larichos parallels that of Penelope, Odysseus, and Telemachus in Homer: in the Brothers Poem, the speaker awaits Charaxos' return from overseas and Larichos' coming-of-age; in the Odyssey, Penelope awaits Odysseus' return and Telemachus' coming-of-age. Additionally, Anton Bierl suggests that the context of Charaxos' being away in Egypt‚Äîaccording to Herodotus, in love with the courtesan Rhodopis‚Äîparallels Odysseus' entrapment by Calypso and Circe. A specific parallel to the Odyssean homecoming narrative is found in line 9 [13]. Sappho uses the adjective (\\"safe\\"), which occurs only once in the Odyssey, at 13.43, where Odysseus hopes that he will return to Ithaca to find his family safe‚Äîjust as the speaker hopes in the third stanza of the Brothers Poem that Charaxos will return to Lesbos to find his family safe. Mueller suggests that the Brothers Poem is a deliberate reworking of the Homeric story, focusing on the fraternal relationship between Sappho and Charaxos in contrast to the conjugal one between Odysseus and Penelope. According to Anastasia-Erasmia Peponi, this should be seen in the context of an archaic Greek tradition of domestic‚Äîand specifically sisterly‚Äîdiscourses. Along with stories of Odysseus' homecoming in the epic tradition, the Brothers Poem has similarities to several other genres of archaic Greek poetry. Joel Lidov sees it as being in the tradition of prayers for safe returns; Richard Martin identifies structural similarities to Archilochus' Cologne Epode (fr.196a), a piece of iambic invective; and Peter O'Connell suggests parallels with songs of welcome, in particular Archilochus fr.24. =Missing stanzas= How much of the Brothers Poem has been lost is unknown. An overlap between P. Oxy. 2289 and P. Sapph. Obbink, the apparent alphabetic arrangement in the Alexandrian edition of her works, and the implausibility of any poem beginning with the word ·ºÄŒªŒªŒ¨ (meaning \\"but\\" or \\"and yet\\"), suggest that at least one opening stanza is missing. B√§r has argued against this position, noting that the overlap between the Oxyrhynchus and Obbink papyri is sufficiently small (only six characters) as not to be conclusive. He argues that there are other known exceptions to the alphabetical ordering of the first Alexandrian edition of Sappho's works, thematic reasons why the Brothers Poem might have been placed out of order to follow closely after fragment 5, and parallels elsewhere in Greek literature for an inceptive ·ºÄŒªŒªŒ¨. Despite B√§r's arguments, most authors conclude that the Brothers Poem is missing at least one, and perhaps as many as three stanzas. Gauthier Liberman suggests that it was originally seven stanzas long; Kurke argues it is likely that only one stanza is missing. There are a variety of theories around the content of the missing stanzas. Mueller suggests that they may have revealed the identity of the addressee. Joel Lidov proposes that the latterly passive addressee actually speaks in the missing stanzas. Obbink provides a reconstruction of a single initial stanza of the poem. He argues that the mention of Larichos in the later stanza appears too suddenly, and therefore he had probably been mentioned in earlier, now missing, lines. Athenaeus notes how Sappho often praised Larichos for being a wine-pourer in the prytaneion at Mytilene; this wine-pouring may have been mentioned here. Obbink also suggests that the opening lines originally contained a mention of the death of Sappho's father when she was young, which was the source of Ovid's anecdote at Heroides 15.61‚Äì62. Kurke has argued that the missing stanza discussed Charaxos, giving the complete poem a symmetry of three stanzas discussing each of the brothers. Reception The discovery of the Brothers Poem, along with fragments of eight other poems‚Äîthe largest discovery of new material by Sappho in almost a century‚Äîwas the subject of significant media attention. James Romm, writing in The Daily Beast, called it \\"a spectacular literary discovery\\", and Tom Payne in The Daily Telegraph said that it was \\"more exciting than a new album by David Bowie\\". Other commentators expressed concern about the provenance of the papyrus, fearing that it had been illegally acquired on the black market, or even that it was a forgery like the Gospel of Jesus' Wife. Douglas Boin in The New York Times criticised the failure to discuss the papyrus' provenance properly as \\"disturbingly tone deaf to the legal and ethical issues\\". Following reports in 2019 that Obbink had illicitly sold several fragments of papyrus to Hobby Lobby, which were then donated to the Green Collection, further questions about the provenance were raised. Charlotte Higgins reported in The Guardian that \\"there are even doubts as to its authenticity. The latest gossip in classical circles is that it might even be a fake. 'Everything about it seems too good to be true,' one senior Cambridge classicist told me.\\" Though classicists considered it the \\"most spectacular\\" of the 2014 finds, it is not considered one of Sappho's best works. Martin West originally considered the work to be \\"very poor stuff\\" and \\"frigid juvenilia\\", though he later toned down his criticism. Liberman wrote that the poem is clumsy, displaying signs of hasty composition. Richard Rawles suggested that part of the reason that the poem was initially considered disappointing was because it was not about sexuality or eroticism‚Äîa factor that he predicted would make the fragment of greater interest in the future. Some commentators have been more positive. Though Loukas Papadimitropoulos said that his initial impression was that it was simplistic, he concluded that the meaning of the poem was \\"perhaps the most profound in all of Sappho's extant work\\", and that the poem turns the \\"simple[...] into something highly significant\\". Despite scholars' disappointment over its quality, the Brothers Poem is valuable for the historical and biographical information it contains. It is the first fragment of Sappho discovered to mention the names \\"Charaxos\\" and \\"Larichos\\", both described as Sappho's brothers by ancient sources but not in any of her previously known writings. Before the poem was found, scholars had doubted that Sappho ever mentioned Charaxos.

Career =ZenoRadio= Herzfeld created a tool using conference call technology to broadcast online radio that connects immigrant communities in the United States to their homelands. Focused primarily on New York City feeder communities, this tool, he named ZenoRadio, recruited its first users who were new residents hailing from San Jose de las Matas, Dominican Republic; San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago; and Governador Valadares, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Herzfeld set up alternative voice over IP routes in these immigrant hometowns to keep families affordably linked between their old and new lives. Today these connections extend to more than 25 countries, from China, Cambodia, Nigeria, and Congo, to Nicaragua, Haiti, Brazil, and the Dominican Republic. =Traif Bike Geschaft= Herzfeld is the former owner of Traif Bike Geschaft, a bicycle repair shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. He lent 500 used bicycles he had purchased from Japan to the Satmar Hasidim free of charge in an attempt to alleviate neighborhood tension between the burgeoning hipster community and the long-time Hasidic Jewish community. Herzfeld purchased 40 used mobile home trailers to store the bikes resulting in what was Brooklyn's first and only trailer park. A trailer park full of bikes and no one to ride them then inspired his personal mission to supply the local Williamsburg, Brooklyn community of Hasidic Jews with wheels to ride around the neighborhood, emerging as a cultural disruptor. Herzfeld became known as a community disruptor by local media, and dubbed a macher by Jewish media. His crowdsourcing experiments also include: a bike vending machine, a bike share program, a landlord business using a psychic to vet tenants, and an ATM that rewarded the 10th user with an extra $20 bill. =The Merengue Scandal= In 2010, prior to his incarnation as bike advocate, Herzfeld spent a year shuttling back and forth between the Dominican Republic, where he ran operations for SkyMax Dominicana (a telecom company), and Brooklyn, where SkyMax's parent company is based. Herzfeld reported to Moses Greenfield, the company's owner and a Williamsburg Satmar Hasid. In the spring of 2007, after Herzfeld clashed with his colleagues one too many times, Greenfield fired him. A dispute followed over how much money Herzfeld was owed. As per their contract, the parties took their conflict to the beth din, or rabbinical court, which functions as arbitrators. Greenfield's attorney was Nathan Lewin, an Orthodox lawyer. The beth din ruled that Herzfeld was entitled to some of the profits he demanded. However, in Herzfeld's view, it did not go far enough in enforcing the verdict.

She participated in a survey of the Navajo Nation's reservation in the Little Colorado River basin and established the cataloging system used by the Glen Canyon Archaeological Project. She was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, a Fellow of the American Anthropological Association and a Fellow of the Society of American Archaeology, as well as the first Fellow of the MNA. Honored in an exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution in 1986 and a recipient of the 1991 Sharlot Hall Award for her contributions to Arizona history, she was posthumously inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame in 2008. Biography Katharine Bartlett was born on November 30, 1907, in Denver, Colorado, to Louise Erina (n√©e Leedom) and George Frederick Bartlett. Unable to afford her first choice of Smith College, Bartlett obtained her master's degree in physical anthropology from the University of Denver, studying under Etienne Bernardeau Renaud. In 1930, she took a summer position to assist with the Hopi Craftsman Exhibition of the Museum of Northern Arizona (MNA). At the invitation of Harold Sellers Colton, who at the time was the preeminent expert in Southwestern US archaeological and ethnological research, Bartlett stayed on in Arizona to organize the two-year-old MNA, which Colton and his wife had founded. Bartlett organized, cataloged, and preserved the museum's anthropology collection, serving from 1930 to 1952 as the museum curator. In 1931, she and Colton made an archaeological survey of the Navajo Reservation covering 250 miles of the reservation that lies in the Little Colorado River basin. They plotted 260 archaeological sites in their survey, and her work on the artifacts from the gravel beds near Tolchaco was some of the earliest work on the Paleo-Indian groups in the area. In 1935, she was honored as one of the first four women elected as Fellows of the Society for American Archaeology. Her work on Paleo-Indians presented at the 1946 Pecos Conference correctly showed that previous work by Frank Roberts indicating a break between Folsom tradition and later cultures was erroneous. In 1952, when Gene Field Foster, Bartlett's housemate, began recording archaeological sites in the area where the Glen Canyon Dam was being built, she invited Bartlett and the MNA to participate. Bartlett established the catalog system for the archaeological collection of the Glen Canyon Project which was the largest project sponsored through the Interagency Archeological Salvage Program (IASP) in the Santa Fe Regional Office of the National Park Service. The surveying in Glen Canyon continued for more than five years. Beginning in 1928, Bartlett published numerous articles on the Native people and cultures of Arizona. Her scientific papers included such topics as ancient mines, artifacts, foods, history, prehistoric tools, as well as crafts of the Hopi, Navajo, and other Arizona tribes. Her article Pueblo Milling Stones of the Flagstaff Region and Their Relation to Others in the Southwest: A Study in Progressive Efficiency \\"has become a standard reference on groundstone food-processing technology,\\" according to the Society for American Archaeology. From 1953 until her retirement in 1981, she served as the Librarian of the MNA and collected thousands of volumes to create a comprehensive research facility in northern Arizona. Bartlett was a charter member of the Arizona Academy of Science and the Arizona Association of University Women. She was a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, of the American Anthropological Association, and the first Fellow of the MNA. She was honored by an exhibit that appeared at the Smithsonian in 1986, entitled ‚ÄúDaughter of the Desert‚Äù and a 1991 recipient of the Sharlot Hall Award for her contributions to Arizona history. Bartlet retired in 1981 to care for her housemate Foster, who died in 1983. In the 1990s, she continued working at the MNA as a volunteer. Bartlett died on May 22, 2001, in Sedona, Arizona, and was posthumously inducted into the Arizona Women's Hall of Fame in 2008.

The activities focus on introducing children ages 1 to 3 to the school and different cultures, promoting pre-literacy skills, like listening and speaking, and improving social skills. = Early Years Programme = The Early Years Programme consists of a Pre-Kindergarten class (2 years old) and the Early Years/Kindergarten (3 to 5 years old). The Early Years Programme is IB-accredited and prepares learners for entrance into the IB Primary Years Programme. Learning in the Early Years Programme is centered around supported play in a safe, secure environment. Teachers facilitate play activities that focus on language and reasoning skills, autonomous thinking and problem solving, manipulative skills and creativity, emotional growth and cognitive development. = Primary Years Programme = DSKI uses two educational plans to create a comprehensive, inquiry-based programme: the Primary Years Programme authorized by the International Baccalaureate and the Th√ºringer Curriculum. Classrooms teachers integrate language, mathematics, science, art, personal and social education, drama and ICT (technology) into units that focus on discovering more about who we are and the larger world. Specialist teachers provide music, physical education and language learning (German, English and/or Japanese).

Valpy was born in 1832. His father, William Henry Valpy, was at the time a judge in Calcutta, India. His mother was Caroline Valpy (n√©e Jeffreys), a sister of Julius Jeffreys. Due to his father's precarious health, the family emigrated to New Zealand, where they arrived at Port Chalmers by the ship Ajax on 8 January 1849. Prior to the family leaving England in 1847, Valpy Sr. had purchased land at the second or third balloting in London under the Otago Association. The family first settled at \\"The Forbury\\" by the Ocean Beach, now known as St Clair. Valpy Jr. was placed in charge of a sheep run at Waihola. In 1852, Valpy Jr. shipped the first fat stock sent by sea from Otago to Canterbury. After several weeks in Lyttelton, he and two shepherds returned to Otago on horseback in a 12-day journey, the first people to accomplish such a feat. His report to John Robert Godley of the feasibility of such an overland journey was published in the Lyttelton Times. During the same year Valpy Jr. moved to the Horseshoe Bush run, at the head of Lake Waihola, and in 1854, he took up the Maerewhenua station, in the Waitaki District in North Otago, and in 1856, purchased the Oamaru and Upper Taipo runs. Due to a severe accident, he was forced to sell his properties. Valpy Jr. then took up the Patearoa run, in the Upper Taieri, but sold it in 1860 to Dr. Buchanan. After that Valpy Jr. lived in retirement until 1874, when he was appointed Crown lands ranger for the northern portion of Otago, but retired from the position in 1888, when he and his family took up two runs at the head of Lake Wakatipu. They afterwards sold these properties. In the early 1860s, Valpy Jr. was made a justice of the peace, and he acted as Sergeant-at-Arms in the Otago Provincial Council, during the time that Julius Vogel was Provincial Treasurer. Valpy married in 1858 to Penelope Caroline Every, the daughter of Simon Frederick Every, of Silver Acres, Andersons Bay, Dunedin. His wife was a descendant of the Every baronets. They had five sons and three daughters. His last residence was Kohimarama near Glenorchy at the head of Lake Wakatipu. He died on 19 January 1911 while he stayed at his son James' place in Oamaru; he had turned 79 only a few days earlier. His wife died in 1924 aged 84.Death Search; Department of Internal Affairs; Registration number 1924/2046; Valpy, Penelope Caroline References *alt= This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: center Category:1832 births Category:1911 deaths Category:Valpy-Fulton-Jeffreys family Category:Settlers of Otago Category:19th-century New Zealand people Category:People from Otago ","title":"William Henry Valpy Jr."},{"id":"48428961","text":"A Black Swan fund is an investment fund based on the black swan theory that seek to reap big rewards from sharp market downturns.

He is known to have played a crucial role, along with Raja Ramanna, Rajagopala Chidambaram and Basanti Dulal Nagchaudhuri, in the design and development of a Hydrogen Bomb by India, which was tested at the Pokhran Test Range in May 1998, under the code name, Operation Shakthi. He was also involved in the Smiling Buddha tests, conducted in 1974. He was awarded the fourth highest civilian award of the Padma Shri, by the Government of India, in 1999.  Biography  Satinder Kumar Sikka was born in Jhang Maghina ( now in Pakistan )in undivided India on 22 November 1942, three months after the Quit India Movement was launched. He graduated (BSc) from the Punjab University in 1960 after which he started his career by joining the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre Training School. While at BARC, he did research under Rajagopala Chidambaram, the renowned nuclear physicist who would later become his associate in the Pokhran tests, and secured a doctoral degree (PhD) from Mumbai University in 1970. His researches during this period were centered around the topics of neutron diffraction, X-ray crystallography, and high pressure and Shock wave physics. He served BARC till 2002, holding several key positions such as that of the Director of Atomic and Condensed Matter Physics Group. In 2002, he was appointed as the Scientific Secretary to Principal Scientific Adviser of the Union Government and he continued his association with the office, even after his superannuation, first as a Scientific consultant to the Principal Scientific Adviser and then, as a member of the Scientific Advisory Committee to the Cabinet (SAC-C). He was the Homi Bhabha Chair Professor at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre from 2010 to 2013.  Legacy  Sikka's early researches on neutron diffraction and his studies of the Phase problem employing anomalous and direct scattering methods have been accepted by the International Union of Crystallography and has been incorporated in their teaching aids. In 1969, he was included in the team of scientists for the Indian Nuclear Weapons Programme and was a member of the Smiling Buddha team which successfully tested the first Indian nuclear bomb on 18 May 1974. He continued his involvement with the team and was the head of the thermonuclear device development team of the Pokhran-II test of 1998. It is reported that Rajagopala Chidambaram, his mentor at BARC, entrusted the responsibility of the development of the thermonuclear test device to Sikka, after consultation with the then Prime Minister of India, P. V. Narasimha Rao. Sikka, receiving the instructions, set up a laboratory with facilities for static pressure generation employing diamond anvil cells and shock waves generation with gas guns, the first such laboratory in India. The researches here assisted in the development of computer codes for design, simulation and yield estimates of nuclear explosives and, aided by these work, he is known to have developed a freshly designed device using a boosted fission bomb primary, to be used on a ballistic missile. His researches have been documented by way of over 150 articles, published in national and international peer reviewed journals. Sikka served as a member of the Executive Committee of the International Association for Advancement of Research and Technology under High Pressure from 1997 to 2000 and as a consultant to the Commission on High Pressure of International Union of Crystallography from 2002 to 2006.

His mother was a mezzo-soprano and pianist which sparked an early interest in music. He began his musical studies at age five with piano lessons. By age ten he was composing his first pieces for himself. In 1968, he started his undergraduate degree in piano studies at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. While at St. Olaf, his interest in composition grew and he graduated in 1972 with a Bachelor of Music in Composition. It was in the midst of the student protests among college campuses across the United States in 1972 that Westerberg wrote politically charged works like De Profundis for chorus, brass and rhythm ensemble, and dancers. This composition would go on to be his first well known work and was played in Washington, DC by his fellow St. Olaf student musicians. During his time at St. Olaf, he took lessons with G. Winston Cassler, Arthur Campbell as well as studying with Alan Stout (composer) at Northwestern University. It was through them that he was exposed to the works of Charles Ives and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. These composers would become a large influence in Westerberg's style. Postgraduate life and career After graduating from St. Olaf College, Westerberg began his Master's studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he studied with Alan Stout (composer). Westerberg then went on to complete a doctorate at Northwestern University as well. During this time, he was hired as an adjunct professor at DePaul University School of Music, where he initially taught aural training. In 1987, Westerberg joined the faculty of the composition department at DePaul University as a full-time professor under then-head George Flynn.cite \\"Kurt Westerberg\\" School of Music Flynn acted as a mentor to Westerberg throughout his teaching and compositional career, and the two released a combined album May 15, 2014, entitled Dual Visions. Dual Visions includes Westerberg's composition Vision and Prayer on a text by Dylan Thomas. Westerberg also released an album of his own instrumental compositions in 2010, entitled Uncertain Light with Southport Records and featuring the Lithuanian National Philharmonic Orchestra. Uncertain Light includes the works Winter Light (1997), Piano Trio (2003), Fantasy for violin and piano (2005), and Concerto for Wind Ensemble (1987). Both albums were released on the Southport record label. In addition to teaching and composing, Westerberg also became the music director at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Evanston, Illinois, in 1998, after years of playing organ at other parishes in the north suburbs of Chicago. Westerberg spends much of his time teaching and fulfilling administrative duties at DePaul University, and currently composes approximately two or three new works each year. Aesthetic Westerberg turned his focus and efforts from piano to composition during his college years in the turbulent 1960s and 70s and tried to use bits of different kinds of music he knew at the time (rock vamps, atonal choromaticism) to produce \\"anti-war pieces with these undertones of somehow trying to address the conflicts that were going on during that time period.\\" When Westerberg graduated, he moved away from his anti-war aesthetic and attempted to explore other types of music unfamiliar to him. Through this exploration, his style of composition solidified into \\"a collage, sound mass style that then refined itself into a more consistently chromatic, but not serial [style], one that emphasize[s] line...so that behind even the strangest series of events, there was still some kind of melodic line...\\" American composer Charles Ives had a large hand in influencing Westerberg's compositions, specifically with the concept of collage, polyrhythmic lines, and construct layers. The ruggedness of Ives' compositions also trickled down onto Westerberg from the line of composition teachers before him, specifically Alan Stout (composer) and Stout's teacher Henry Cowell.cite cite \\"Kurt Westerberg\\" School of Music After graduating from St. Olaf College, Westerberg familiarized himself with the idea of sound mass from European composers such as Krzysztof Penderecki and Gy√∂rgy Ligeti. As a result of developing his compositional style in the middle of the 20th Century, Westerberg was influenced heavily by the many forms of chromaticism in the contemporary music scene at the time. Westerberg individualizes his style by separating chromaticism from serialism, leaving serialism behind when incorporating chromaticism into his compositions. In addition to 20th Century concepts, the older idea of motif (music) is a large component of Westerberg's style. Westerberg was specifically influenced by Ludwig van Beethoven, Claude Debussy, and B√©la Bart√≥k, fascinated with how these composers worked with different musical motifs over the course of a work, how they were able to compress, stretch, and manipulate these themes over the course of a piece. In the last 20 years, Westerberg has purposely began to incorporate extended techniques for different instruments into his compositions, such as his trio for three clarinets. His focus when using these techniques is to incorporate them naturally into the vocabulary, so that they are an expressive part of the piece, as opposed to existing for their own sake. Reception Westerberg was first recognized for his composition De Profundis, which he composed in 1970 in his second year of undergraduate studies at St. Olaf College.cite Dual Visions album notes p. 52 The piece was composed in protest to the Vietnam War and the events at Kent State University and Jackson State University that year. Written for brass and percussion ensemble, jazz trio, chorus, and modern dancers, the work was premiered as a part of St. Olaf's 1971 homecoming events. Subsequent performances were heard in Minneapolis and Washington, D.C., where Westerberg and the St. Olaf musicians were invited for three performances in 1972. Invited by Rep. Albert Quie, R-Minn, the ensemble performed in the rotunda of the capitol building and in the House and old Senate office buildings. Rep. Quie remarked, \\"A fine performance-very powerful and moving.\\" The performances in the United States capital received national attention, including an article in the Minneapolis Tribune and a National Public Radio interview with the composer. In 1997, Westerberg was featured in the Critic's Choice Column of the Chicago Reader, where he was recognized for his abstract style influenced by Charles Ives and Henry Cowell by way of Alan Stout.

Sandow is surrounded by villages - Lamsoo in the west, Yokma Kharboo and Shakar in the south and Lhalung Batalik in the north. Sandow falls under the Shakar constituency zone. The village is from Kargil town, located on 34.55 latitude and 76.38 longitude and at an altitude of above mean sea level. The village was settled some around 300 years before, on a syncline of a complex range of Himalaya.  Climate  Sandow has very cool climate with temperature dropping to in winter. Very cool normal wind makes life harsh there in winter. In summer temperature rises to 20. Three main seasons i.e. spring, autumn and winter are very cold. In winter snowfall of over 1 feet will be there which is the main source of water for the summer. There is a large like namely Shashi Lake 2 km above the village which stores snow water melted in spring and early summer to ensure continuous water supply for the whole summer. = Agriculture = Agriculture is very important and main work of the villagers. Crops like Barley, wheat and pea are cultivated. Agricultural works begins in mid-April until August. There are canals to water fields as there used to be very less rainfall. Until a few years back all agricultural works like ploughing, threshing, grinding to flour are used to be done by peoples with help of animals but now machines replaced grinding and threshing.  Topography Sandow is in between mountains and is very rugged. Small agricultural fields are made in the mountains alongside the stream. Soil here is not productive, basically soil is very new, formed by degradation and erosion of mountains peoples have made the soil cultivable by fediing the soil with local manures whole village and field are in slope of mountains.  Education  There is a middle school in the village. Literacy rate of the village is above 80% and most of the students are pursuing their higher studies in various parts of India. A secondary school is located away from the village in another village Shakar.  Population  There are about 40 households in the villages and population is roughly 400.  Shashi Tso  thumb Shashi Lake (popularly known as Shashi Tso) is a lakes in Kargil district located 08 km from village Sandow. It is an artificial lake located in upper mountain range of Shashi at an altitude of 4,200 metres (14,000 ft) surrounded by mountains on all sides. The lake is snow fed so its volume changes with seasons reaching at peak volume in June. The lake remains in frozen state for half of the year. The lake is seasonal and it gets filled up in the months of May‚ÄìJune when snow starts to melt in the surrounding mountains. It is known for its scenery, cool weather, fresh icy water and adventures like kayaking and trekking. It is base camp for trekking to Barbanchanla peak which is the highest peak of Shakar-Chiktan. The area surrounding the lake are grazing grounds for livestock of surrounding villagers and wild animals like fox, deer, ibex, and wolves could be seen around the lake drinking water. = Construction = This lakehttps://www.ladakhtalkies.in/2018/05/s-hashi-lake-is-artificial-lake- which.html?m=1 was constructed about 60 years back by the villagers of twin village of Sandow and Yokma Kharboo with the purpose of permanent water source for the agricultural land in the two villages which lies along the stream originating from the lake. A wall was constructed on lower side of the lake to stop the water and regulatory water gateway was made to allow water to flow in case overfilled. A required amount of water leak from the base of the wall which makes it independent, requiring no human to regulate the flowing water level from the lake.The wall was constructed with a slope varying from 40 degrees at bottom to 60 degrees at top and one can easily walk even on the slanting wall of the lake. It was constructed without use of any cement, concrete and iron. = Excursions and tourism = The Lake is connected with road to Sandow and lalung and one can reach there through both the roads from Kargil. Through Sandow it is connected to National highway (NH1) at Khangral and Lotsum. It is 65 km from district headquarter Kargil and 200 km from Leh. From last few years (after linking it with road to Sandow) thousands of peoples are flooding to the lake for picnic in summer mainly in the month of July and August. 2015 saw a footfall of more than 10 thousand with locals mainly staying a day long while most foreign tourists stayed for many days and explored the surrounding areas like Trekking to Barbanchan la and trip to mysterious Api Strinjangmo-e-Baho (roughly translated as Old Spider's cave). In 2015 the lake drew attention from administration when due to overfilling and resulting leakages damaging low lying areas.

Jackson, Predicting Malicious Behavior: Tools and Techniques for Ensuring Global Security (John Wiley & Sons, 2012), p. 235. There are many definitions of terrorism, and none of them are universally accepted. The United States Department of State defined terrorism in 2003 as \\"premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents, usually intended to influence an audience.\\" There is no Federal criminal offense designated as domestic terrorism. Definition While there are many potential definitions of domestic terrorism, it is largely defined as terrorism in which the perpetrator targets his/her own country. Enders defines domestic terrorism as \\"homegrown in which the venue, target, and perpetrators are all from the same country.\\" The term \\"homegrown terrorism\\" stems from jihadi terrorism against Westerners. Wilner and Dobouloz described homegrown terrorism as \\"autonomously organized radicalized Westerners with little direct assistance from transnational networks, usually organized within the home or host country, and targets fellow nationals.\\" The Congressional Research Service report, American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat, describes homegrown terrorism as a ‚Äúterrorist activity or plots perpetuated within the United States or abroad by American citizens, permanent legal residents, or visitors radicalized largely within the United States.‚Äù Under the 2001 USA Patriot Act, domestic terrorism is defined as \\"activities that (A) involve acts dangerous to human life that are a violation of the criminal laws of the U.S. or of any state; (B) appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S.\\" This definition is made for the purposes of authorizing law enforcement investigations. While international terrorism (\\"acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries\\") is a defined crime in federal law, no federal criminal offense exists which is referred to as \\"domestic terrorism\\". Acts of domestic terrorism are charged under specific laws, such as killing federal agents or \\"attempting to use explosives to destroy a building in interstate commerce\\". Facts and studies Homegrown terrorism is not new to the world. Security analysts have argued that after the end of the Cold War, military conflicts have increasingly involved violent non-state actors carrying out asymmetric warfare, of which terror attacks are one part.https://fas.org/irp/nic/nonstate_actors_2007.pdf The United States has uncovered a number of alleged terrorist plots that have been successfully suppressed through domestic intelligence and law enforcement. The United States has begun to account for the threat of homegrown terrorism, as shown by increased volume of literature on the subject in recent years and increased number of terrorist websites since Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al- Qaeda in Iraq, began posting beheading videos in 2003. A July 2009 document by the FBI estimated that there were roughly 15,000 websites and web forums that support terrorist activities, with around 10,000 of them actively maintained. 80% of these sites are on U.S.-based servers. According to the Congressional Research Service's study, American Jihadist Terrorism: Combatting a Complex Threat, between May 2009 and November 2010, law enforcement made arrests related to 22 homegrown jihadist-inspired terror plots by American citizens or legal residents of the U.S. This is a significant increase over the 21 plots caught in the seven interim years after the September 11 attacks. During these seven years, two plots resulted in attacks, compared to the two attacks between May 2009 and November 2010, which resulted in 14 deaths. This spike post-May 2009 shows that some Americans are susceptible to ideologies that support a violent form of jihad. Roughly one-quarter of these plots have been linked to major international terrorist groups but an increasing number of Americans are holding high-level operational roles in these terrorist groups, especially al-Qaeda and its affiliated groups.Brian Michael Jenkins, \\"Terrorist Radicalization in the United States Since September 11, 2001,\\" RAND Corporation, 2010 The former CIA Director Michael Hayden called homegrown terrorism the more serious threat faced by American citizens today. The UK, likewise, considers homegrown terrorism to be a considerable threat. On June 6, 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron announced a wide-ranging strategy to prevent British citizens from being radicalized into becoming terrorists while at university. The strategy is intended to prevent extremist speakers or groups from coming to universities. On July 23, 2019, Christopher A. Wray, the head of the FBI, said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that the agency had made around 100 domestic terrorism arrests since October 1, 2018, and that the majority of them were connected in some way with white supremacy. Wray said that the Bureau was \\"aggressively pursuing [domestic terrorism] using both counterterrorism resources and criminal investigative resources and partnering closely with our state and local partners,\\" but said that it was focused on the violence itself and not on its ideological basis. A similar number of arrests had been made for instances of international terrorism. In the past, Wray has said that white supremacy was a significant and \\"pervasive\\" threat to the U.S.Chalfant, Morgan (July 23, 2019) \\"FBI's Wray says most domestic terrorism arrests this year involve white supremacy\\" The Hill = Lone wolf terrorism = Domestic terrorism is often linked to lone wolf terrorism. Sociologist Ram√≥n Spaaij defines lone wolf terrorism as an act of terrorism committed by one person who \\"acts on his or her own without orders from‚Äîor even connections to an organization\\". From the late 20th to the early 21st centuries, lone wolf terrorism in the United States has primarily been associated with white supremacy, Islamic fundamentalism, and anti-government extremists such as Charles Whitman, Timothy McVeigh, Dylann Roof, Robert Bowers, Wade Michael Page, Ted Kaczynski, Eric Rudolph, Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold, James Holmes, Omar Mateen,and Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Many lone wolves share a common trait in that they seek acceptance from other groups but are typically met with rejection. In their 2007 book Hunting the American Terrorist former FBI Deputy Assistant Director Terry Turchie and former FBI special agent Kathleen Puckett described six criteria to define a lone wolf: # The act of terrorism was organized by few or only one person that was not operating with an organized group # The individual is willing to use lethal violence to achieve their goal # Their primary goal is ideological, political, or religious in scope # The individual is willing to accept full- scale collateral damage # The individual is not intending to commit suicide, unless the situation calls for it # The individual is intending to commit homicide to get their message public, or to use such acts as the message  Radicalization  There is no one path toward violence. Homegrown terrorists have been high school dropouts, college graduates, members of the military, and cover the range of financial situations. Recent research by Matt Qvortrup in the British Journal of Politics and International Relations has suggested that domestic terrorism is a result of lack of opportunities for meaningful political engagement. Some domestic terrorists studied overseas and were exposed to radical Islamist thought, while others took their inspiration from the internet. An article published in the British Journal of Sociology suggests that discrimination against minorities, particularly in the form of residential segregation of Muslims in European countries such as England, France, and Germany, can contribute to radicalization of Muslims living in these countries. Marc Sageman writes in his book, Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century that, contrary to popular belief, radicalization into terrorism is not the product of poverty, various forms of brainwashing, youth, ignorance, lack of education, lack of employment, lack of social responsibility, criminality, or mental illness.Marc Sageman, Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century, (Philadelphia, PA: University Of Pennsylvania Press, 2008) He says that intermediaries and English-speaking imams, such as the late Yemeni-American cleric Anwar al- Awlaki (d. 2011), who are often found through the internet on forums, provide key roles in the radicalization process. Social networks provided in forums support and build upon an individual's radical beliefs. Prison systems are also a concern as a place of radicalization and jihadist recruiting; nearly three dozen ex-convicts who attended training camps in Yemen were believed to have been radicalized in prison. The only constant appears to be \\"a newfound hatred for their native or adopted country, a degree of dangerous malleability, and a religious fervor justifying or legitimizing violence that impels these very impressionable and perhaps easily influenced individuals toward potentially lethal acts of violence,\\" according to Peter Bergen and Bruce Hoffman's September 2010 paper for the Bipartisan Policy Center. Training Training for potential homegrown terrorists is often very fast- paced, or rushed, as some groups under attack by U.S. forces may feel the need to implement operations \\"more precipitously than they might otherwise occur,\\" according to Bruce Hoffman. This was the case with the failed Times Square plot carried out by Faisal Shazad. Pakistani Taliban (TPP) was on record as providing financing and four months of training for Shazad directly prior to his actions in Times Square. Shazad reportedly received only three to five days of training in bomb-making. Some individuals go abroad to a region containing extremism, predominantly Pakistan, but also Iraq, Afghanistan,Yemen or Somalia. In the case of the London Underground bombers, Mohammad Sidique Khan, the operational leader of the cell, received military and explosives training at a camp in Malakand, Pakistan in July 2003. Later he took Shezad Tanweer to Karachi, Pakistan, in late 2004 to February 2005 where they crossed the border to receive training at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.p. 33 ‚Äì Edward McCleskey, Diana McCord, and Jennifer Leetz, ‚ÄúUnderlying Reasons for the Success and Failure of Terrorist Attacks.‚Äù (Arlington, VA: Homeland Security Institute, June 2007) Training and usage of recruits is varied. Some, such as Shahzad, received little training and ultimately failed in their goals. Others, like the sleeper agent David Headley‚Äôs reconnaissance efforts, were essential towards Lashkar-e-Toiba‚Äôs (LeT) success in the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. Scholars say that some lone wolves may achieve objectives, but the vast majority of individual operators fail to execute their plans because of lack of training and planning. There is also a question as to whether such individuals are radical, or suffering other problems. The American convert, Abdulhakim Muhammad (n√©e Carlos Bledsoe), who killed a U.S. military recruiter in Little Rock, Arkansas, and wounded another, had many other targets and plans, which went awry. It was not until some time after his arrest that he first claimed to have been working for Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). But, investigators found no evidence of this. The lead county prosecutor said that, aside from Muhammad's self-serving statements, it was \\"just an awful killing\\", like others he had seen. Bledsoe's father described his son as \\"unable to process reality.\\" He was charged with capital murder and related charges, not terrorism, and pleaded guilty. The American Nidal Hasan, the US Army major and psychiatrist charged in the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, had come to the attention of colleagues and superiors years before the shootings; they documented their concerns about his mental state. The Department of Defense has classified the event as \\"workplace violence\\" rather than terrorism, pending Hasan's court martial. Some observers believe that his personal characteristics are more like those of other mass murderers than terrorists; he did not belong to any group. The Somalian Al-Shabab (\\"the youth\\") have recruited strongly in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. The 30+ Somali-Americans received training by senior al-Qaeda leaders in Somalia. Hoffman believes this indicates that radicalization and recruitment is not an isolated, lone-wolf phenomenon unique to Somali-Americans, but that there is terrorist recruitment infrastructure in the United States. After more than a dozen of 20 American recruits were killed in fighting in Somalia, the number of Americans going to join Al-Shabab has declined since 2007‚Äì2008. Role of the internet ‚ÄúThe Internet is a driver and enabler for the process of radicalization\\", says a report of the Police Department of the City of New York of 2007. (pages 8‚Äì9) The internet has a wide appeal as it provides an anonymous way for like-minded, conflicted individuals to meet, form virtual relations, and discuss the radical and extremist ideology they encounter. The virtual network created in message boards or private forums further radicalizes and cements the jihadi-Salafi/racial supremacist message individuals have encountered as they build a community. The internet acts as an enabler, providing the aspiring jihadist/supremacist with a forum in which they may plan, share information on targets, weapons, and recruit others into their plans. Much of the resources needed to make weapons can be found on- line. =Inspire= Inspire is an online English-language propaganda magazine published by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Purported to be created by Samir Khan, a U.S. citizen and cyber-jihadist, the magazine uses American idioms and phrasing and does not appear to have British or South Asian influences in its language. The magazine contains messages calling for western jihadists, like this one from AQAP leader Nasir al-Wahayshi, \\"to acquire weapons and learn methods of war.

The ambush resulted in the deaths of four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen, most of whom were citizens of Saudi Arabia. Twelve militants were wounded, and a further six were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to the Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. The Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams conjectures that the mujahideen may have deliberately been led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the organization's ranks. Later in the day, 19 KLA fighters were wounded when the VJ shelled an arms smuggling route near the site of the ambush. They were evacuated by Albanian border guards and airlifted to receive treatment in the country's capital, Tirana. Albanian officials later alleged that two of the mortar rounds fired by Yugoslav troops had landed inside Albania, sparking further tension between the two countries. That afternoon, KLA militants attacked a Yugoslav border patrol, wounding another soldier. Background Following World War II, Kosovo was given the status of an autonomous province within the Socialist Republic of Serbia, one of six constitutional republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the death of Yugoslavia's long-time leader Josip Broz Tito in 1980, Yugoslavia's political system began to unravel.Judah, pp. 38‚Äì9 In 1989, Belgrade revoked Kosovo's autonomy as part of Serbian President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá's \\"anti-bureaucratic revolution\\". Kosovo, a province predominantly inhabited by ethnic Albanians, is of great historical and cultural significance to Serbs, who formed a majority there before the mid-19th century but by 1990 represented only about ten percent of the population. Alarmed by their dwindling numbers, the province's Serbs began to fear that they were being \\"squeezed out\\" by the Albanians, and ethnic tensions worsened. Once Kosovo's autonomy was abolished, a minority government run by Serbs and Montenegrins was appointed by Milo≈°eviƒá to oversee the province, enforced by thousands of heavily armed paramilitaries from Serbia-proper. Albanian culture was systematically repressed and hundreds of thousands of Albanians working in state-owned companies lost their jobs. In 1991‚Äì92, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia disintegrated following the secession of former constituent republics Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 1992, amidst the breakup of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Wars, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a Serb-controlled federation consisting of Serbia (including Kosovo) and Montenegro, was proclaimed. In 1996, a group of Albanian nationalists calling themselves the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began attacking the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army (; VJ) and the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs (; MUP) in Kosovo. Their goal was to separate the province from the rest of Yugoslavia. At first, the KLA carried out hit-and-run attacks (31 in 1996, 55 in 1997, and 66 in January and February 1998 alone).Judah, p. 137 It gained popularity among young Kosovo Albanians, many of whom rejected the non-violent resistance to Yugoslav authorities advocated by the politician Ibrahim Rugova and favoured a more aggressive approach. The organization received a significant boost in 1997, when an armed uprising in neighbouring Albania led to thousands of weapons from the Albanian Army's depots being looted. Many of these weapons ended up in the hands of the KLA, which already had substantial resources due its involvement in the trafficking of drugs, weapons and people, as well as through donations from the Albanian diaspora.Udoviƒçki & Ridgeway, pp. 329‚Äì30Judah, pp. x, 127‚Äì30 Cross-border arms smuggling flourished; the unit charged with securing the Yugoslav border was the 549th Motorized Brigade, under the command of General Bo≈æidar Deliƒá. The KLA's popularity skyrocketed after the VJ and MUP attacked the compound of KLA leader Adem Jashari in March 1998, killing him, his closest associates and most of his family. The attack prompted thousands of young Kosovo Albanians to join the ranks of the KLA, fueling the Kosovar uprising that eventually erupted in the spring of 1998.Judah, pp. 138‚Äì41 Timeline =Prelude= In the summer of 1998, a number of senior U.S. intelligence officials met with the leaders of the KLA, and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents arrived in northern Albania to monitor the fighting in Kosovo and assist in training rebel fighters. In exchange for American military, financial and intelligence support, KLA leaders promised not to carry out any actions outside Kosovo, not to continue participating in the drug trade, and not to accept help from Islamic radicals. Thus, the KLA ordered the 36 foreign Islamist fighters (or mujahideen) fighting in their ranks to leave Kosovo. Though few Kosovo Albanians sympathized with the Islamists, some argued that the KLA should have accepted assistance from any source, fundamentalist or otherwise. When KLA commanders ordered the mujahideen to leave, they refused, and disagreements arose within the KLA ranks as what was to be done with them. Serb sources assert that the first mujahideen began arriving in Kosovo in the spring of 1998, mainly from Bosnia and Herzegovina. By that summer, about 240 mujahideen were present in Kosovo and northern Albania. Most of these were ethnic Albanians, but the group also included several dozen Arabs from the Middle East and North Africa. According to the diary of the ambushed KLA group's leader, Ali Rabi√ßi, the mujahideen involved in the July 18 ambush had initially gathered in Munich before taking a ferry from Bari to the Albanian port city of Durr√´s. Once in Albania, the mujahideen were escorted to the frontier towns of Tropoj√´ and Bajram Curri by their KLA handlers, where they rendezvoused with Rabi√ßi's men. =Clashes= In the early morning hours of Saturday, July 18, 1998, the mujahideen and KLA militants left their base in northern Albania and departed for Kosovo. Estimates of their strength vary. Human Rights Watch observer Fred C. Abrahams writes that the group consisted of 24 mujahideen and 200 KLA. The political scientist David L. Phillips and diplomat Nicholas Burns state that there were 22 mujahideen and 300 KLA fighters. Tim Judah, a journalist specializing in the Balkans, believes that the group may have been made up of as many as 700 militants.Judah, p. 169 The VJ reported up to 1,000 militants. The group crossed the Albanian‚ÄìYugoslav border at Maja e Ujaz√´s, northeast of Bajram Curri. The guerrillas were carrying a large quantity of arms and ammunition, which significantly impeded their movement and obliged them to move slowly across the Albanian‚ÄìYugoslav frontier. One hypothesis is that they were heading to reinforce KLA fighters battling for the town of Orahovac. At 02:00, the column was ambushed by Yugoslav border guards between Mount ƒêeravica and the Ko≈°are border outpost, west of Deƒçani. The ambush occurred about from the Albanian border.Abrahams, p. 263 A shell struck the column, killing eight. Clashes ensued, reportedly lasting until about 07:00. According to Abrahams, the ambush ultimately resulted in the deaths of 22 militants, including 18 mujahideen and four KLA. Twelve militants were wounded. Rabi√ßi was among those killed; documents recording the KLA and mujahideen's journey were recovered off his corpse by the Yugoslav authorities. Sixteen of the mujahideen were citizens of Saudi Arabia and one was a citizen of Yemen. Six were carrying forged Macedonian passports under ethnic Albanian pseudonyms. According to the Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the incident represented the first skirmish between the VJ and foreign mujahideen during the Kosovo War. It is unclear if the ambush came as a result of Yugoslav vigilance or if the KLA deliberately led the mujahideen into a trap with the goal of eliminating them and thus limiting the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks. Survivors told monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe that KLA fighters had led the mujahideen into a trap and fled. A Yugoslav lance corporal was seriously wounded in the exchange. Most of the surviving militants either retreated to Albania or went into hiding along the border. As they fled, they dropped large quantities of Chinese-made weapons and munitions, which were subsequently seized by the Yugoslav authorities. Six militants, all citizens of Albania, were captured. They were charged with illegally crossing the border and gunrunning. Yugoslav officials stated that more than of weapons and ammunition, including about 300 rifles, 60 machine guns, ten recoilless guns and a number of mortars, had been confiscated. Later that day, the VJ shelled a known arms trafficking route near the site of the ambush, wounding 19 KLA fighters. The militants were rescued by Albanian border guards and airlifted by helicopter to receive treatment in a Tirana hospital. At 13:30, two militants opened fire on a Yugoslav border patrol within of the Albanian frontier. The border patrol returned fire and the militants fled to Albania. One Yugoslav soldier was slightly wounded. Aftermath Judah described the ambush as a \\"catastrophic disaster\\" for the KLA. Albania's deputy Minister of Interior Affairs, Ilir √áano, claimed two Yugoslav mortars had landed inside Albania. \\"These ... incidents could have very dangerous consequences,\\" he warned. Albanian officials indicated that the mortars did not cause any injuries. Albania lodged a formal protest and demanded an explanation from the Yugoslav authorities. Yugoslav officials denied shelling the border and accused the Albanian authorities of turning a blind eye to KLA arms smuggling in northern Albania. Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo stated that Albania \\"expresses its fraternal solidarity and supports the just struggle of Albanians in Kosovo.\\" The Albanian Government released a statement describing the ambush as a \\"Serb provocation\\" and calling on the international community to \\"stop, by any means, the fascist aggression Belgrade is inflicting on the Albanian population of Kosovo.\\" In turn, Yugoslav officials accused Albania of sending 300 soldiers to fight alongside the KLA in Kosovo, citing the testimony of captured KLA personnel. Albanian officials denied having troops in the province. The United States warned Yugoslavia against shelling Albanian territory. State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that the alleged shelling was likely an attempt to prevent the insurgents from re-entering Kosovo. \\"If true, the shelling represents an unacceptable violation of Albanian territory.\\" He continued. \\"Belgrade must understand that such shelling runs the risk of further escalating the current conflict.\\" Rubin said that the U.S. was opposed to the creation of a pan-Albanian state, and emphasized that calls for its establishment were a \\"very dangerous development that could affect the stability of the region.\\" Russian officials accused KLA fighters of stoking the clashes, and called for peace talks between the militants and Yugoslav authorities. On July 19, Albanian officials requested that Greece‚Äîan important trading partner for Albania and traditional ally of Serbia‚Äîmediate to end the fighting. Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos issued a condemnation, saying \\"these senseless acts of violence must stop.\\" The European Union condemned the militant incursion, as well as the alleged cross-border shelling.

That is, if the initial orthodromic course Z from the starting point S to the fixed point X is 80 degrees, the associated isoazimuth is formed by all points whose initial orthodromic course with respect to point X is 80¬∞ (with respect to true north). The isoazimuth is written using the notation isoz(X, Z) . The isoazimuth is of use when navigating with respect to an object of known location, such as a radio beacon. A straight line called the azimuth line of position is drawn on a map, and on most common map projections this is a close enough approximation to the isoazimuth. On the Littrow projection, the correspondence is exact. This line is then crossed with an astronomical observation called a Sumner line, and the result gives an estimate of the navigator's position.

He is best known as the lead singer, guitarist, pianist, and primary songwriter of the rock band Muse. He is recognised for his eccentric stage persona, wide tenor vocal range and virtuoso abilities on the piano and guitar. He has also released solo compositions. With Muse, Bellamy has won two Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album, for The Resistance (2009) and Drones (2015), two Brit Awards, winning Best British Live Act twice, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. The band have sold over 20 million albums worldwide. In 2012, the band received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Early life Matthew James Bellamy was born on 9 June 1978 in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire. He has an older brother named Paul. His father, George Bellamy, was the rhythm guitarist of the 1960s pop group The Tornados, who were the first British band to have a U.S. number-one song with \\"Telstar\\". His mother, Marilyn, was born in Belfast and moved to England in the 1970s. On her first day in England, she met Bellamy's father, who was working as a taxi driver in London at the time. They later moved to Cambridge and in the mid-1980s to Teignmouth, Devon. After Bellamy's parents had divorced, Matthew lived with his mother and brother. He started playing the piano at the age of six and guitar when he was 11. His first musical performance was in June 1991, aged 12, playing piano in front of his school at Teignmouth Community College. Muse Bellamy performing in 2001 At Teignmouth Community School, Devon, Bellamy played in a number of bands, including Carnage Mayhem and Gothic Plague with drummer Dominic Howard. When members of Gothic Plague left because of other interests, Bellamy and Howard asked bassist Chris Wolstenholme to join. In 1994, using the name Rocket Baby Dolls, they won the school's \\"Battle of the Bands\\" which led them to take the band more seriously, and changed their name to Muse. Muse have gone on to worldwide success. Muse blends alternative, art rock, experimental rock, progressive rock, classical music, electronica and many other styles. The band is also well known for its energetic and visually dazzling live performances. On 16‚Äì17 June 2007, Muse became the first band to sell out the newly built Wembley Stadium in London. Muse released their debut album, Showbiz, in 1999, showcasing Bellamy's falsetto and a melancholic alternative rock style. Their second album, Origin of Symmetry (2001), expanded their sound, incorporating wider instrumentation and romantic classical influences, and earned them a reputation for energetic live performances. Absolution (2003) saw further classical influence, with orchestra on tracks such as \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\", and became the first of five consecutive UK number-one albums. Black Holes and Revelations (2006) incorporated electronic and pop elements, influenced by 1980s groups such as Depeche Mode, displayed in singles such as \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\". The album brought Muse wider international success. The Resistance (2009) and The 2nd Law (2012) explored themes of government oppression and civil uprising and cemented Muse as one of the world's major stadium acts. Their seventh album, Drones (2015), was a concept album about drone warfare and returned to a harder rock sound. Their eighth album, Simulation Theory, featuring a retro 1980s style, was released on 9 November 2018. Muse have won numerous awards, including two Grammy Awards, winning the Grammys for Best Rock Album for The Resistance and Drones, two Brit Awards, winning Best British Live Act twice, five MTV Europe Music Awards and eight NME Awards. In 2012 the band received the Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors. Muse have sold over 20 million albums worldwide. Musicianship Matt Bellamy playing with sound (Royal Albert Hall 2018) Many Muse songs are recognizable by Bellamy's use of vibrato, falsetto, and melismatic phrasing, influenced by Jeff Buckley.\\"Matt Bellamy Interview\\" . The Guardian. Retrieved 17 June 2015 As a guitarist, Bellamy often uses the arpeggiator and pitch-shift effects to create a more \\"electronic\\" sound, citing Jimi Hendrix and Tom Morello as influences. His guitar playing is also influenced by Latin and Spanish guitar music. Bellamy has stated that he \\"learnt some Spanish guitar music that opened up a world of different harmonies and making music and a different sort of passion,\\" describing it as \\"very heavy music, but it hasn't got a distortion pedal\\". As a pianist, Bellamy often uses arpeggios. Bellamy's compositions often suggest or quote late classical and romantic era composers such as Sergei Rachmaninov (in \\"Space Dementia\\" and \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\"), Camille Saint-Sa√´ns (in \\"I Belong to You (Mon Coeur S'ouvre √Ä Ta Voix)\\") and Fr√©d√©ric Chopin (in \\"United States of Eurasia\\").\\"Muse Interview\\" .

It is located 22 km from Tirunelveli. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Aravindalochanar and his consort Lakshmi as Karunthadankanni.. The temple is also classified as a Navatirupathi, the nine temples revered by Nammazhwar located in the banks of Tamiraparani river. Along with the Devapiran temple located 100 yards away, the temple is referred as Irattai Tirupathy (meaning twin Tirupathis). This temple is a Rahu Sthalam. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing the main shrine and pillared halls. Unlike other South Indian temples, the temple does not have a rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower and has a flat gateway. The Vijayanagar and Nayak kings commissioned pillared halls and major shrines of the temple during the 16th century. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day annual Vaikunta Ekadasi during the Tamil month of Margazhi (December - January) and the Nammazhwar birth celebrations with Garudasevai with all nine temple of Navatirupathi, being the most prominent. In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend The temple follows the legend of it twin temple, Devapiran temple. As per Hindu legend, the place finds mention in Brahmanda Purana and Padma Purana where it is called Kedara Nilaya. Once a sage named Suprabha wanted to perform penance and in his search for land, he ploughed at this place. He found a balance (tola) and a bow (vil), which, when he lifted, turned into a couple. The couple were cursed by Kubera once for insulting them. Since the bow and balance were redeemed to their original form, the place is called Tolavillimangalam. The sage Suprabha continued to perform penance, at the end of which, the Devas received the share of offering (Havibhaga). Vishnu was pleased by the devotion of the sage and since he appeared with Devas, he came to be known as Devapiram. The sage continued to perform penance at this temple and while walking down the river with lotus pond, he found Vishnu following him. At the request of the sage, Vishnu resided in this place as Aravindalochanar (the one who appeared from lotuses). As per another legend, the Ashwinidevadas wanted the share of the offerings made by men. They prayed to Brahma who redirected them to pray at this place. The twins came to the place and performed penance at this place. They had a dip in the tank, which came to be known as Asvini Tirtha. Vishnu appeared to them bearing lotus flowers in his had and granted their wishes. Architecture thumb The exact history of the temple is not known, but it is understood from the neighbouring inscriptions, the temple has been a part of a series of temples built by Pandyas and expanded by Madurai Nayaks.

The rajagopuram, the temple's gateway tower, is a flat structure, unlike other South Indian temples, which have a conical elevated structure. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines and halls. The sanctum houses the image of Aravindalocha facing east. The image is made of Saligrama stone. The hall preceding the sanctum, the Artha Mandapam houses the festival image of Aravindalocahanar with the images of Sridevi and Bhudevi on either of his sides. The Mahamandapa has shrines for Senai Mudaliyar, Garuda, Venugopala, Manavalamamunigal and Azhwars. Religious significance Image of the main entrance from the street Brahmanda Purana one of the eighteen sacred texts of Hinduism and written by Veda Vyasa contains a chapter called Navathirupathi Mahatmeeyam that describes all the nine temples of Navatirupathi. Aravindalochanar temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Nammazhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The temple is also classified as a Navatirupathi, the nine temples revered by Nammazhwar located in the banks of Tamiraparani river. Nammazhwar makes a reference about the temple in his works in Thirvaimozhi. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. The temple also forms a series of Navagraha temples where each of the nine planetary deities is associated with one of the temples of Navatirupathi. The temple is associated with Rahu, a snake planet. Along with the Devapiran temple located 100 yards away, the temple is referred as Irattai Tirupathy (meaning twin Tirupathis). Festival The Garuda Sevai utsavam(festival) in the month of Vaikasi(May-Jun) witnesses nine Garudasevai, a large event in which festive images from the Nava Tirupathi shrines in the area are brought on Garuda vahana(sacred vehicle) to Alwarthirunagari Temple. An idol of Nammalvar is also brought on an Anna Vahanam (palanquin) and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these 9 temples are recited. The utsavar(festival deity) of Nammalvar is taken in a palanquin to each of the nine temples, through the paddy fields in the area. The paasurams(poems) dedicated to each of the nine Divyadesams are chanted in the respective shrines. This is the most important of the festivals in this area, and it draws thousands of visitors. The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Pancharathra aagama. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals and festivals performed in the temple.

He was an author of stories for pulp fiction magazines. He also wrote dozens of novels, mostly Westerns and detective stories. Gruber wrote many scripts for Hollywood movies and television shows, and was the creator of three TV series. He sometimes wrote under the pen names Stephen Acre, Charles K. Boston and John K. Vedder. Career Gruber said that as a 9-year-old newsboy, he read his first book, \\"Luke Walton, the Chicago Newsboy\\" by Horatio Alger. During the next seven years he read a hundred more Alger books and said they influenced him professionally more than anything else in his life. They told how poor boys became rich, but what they instilled in Gruber was an ambition at age nine or 10, to be an author. He had written his first book before age 11, using a pencil on wrapping paper. Age 13 or 14, his ambition died for a while but several years later it rose again and he started submitting stories to various magazines, like Smart Set and Atlantic Monthly. Getting rejected, he lowered his sights to The Saturday Evening Post and Colliers, with no more success. The pulps were getting noticed and Gruber tried those but with no success. As a story came back with a rejection slip, he would post it off again to someone else, so he could have as many as forty stories going back and forth at different times, costing him about a third of his earnings in postage. Erle Stanley Gardner called him the fighter who licked his weight in rejection slips. Gruber served in the US Army from 1920-1921.p.145 Powell, S. 100 American Crime Writers Springer, 7 Aug 2012 Gruber said that, while in the Army, he learned how to manipulate the dice to throw 35 consecutive sevens, but that he had \\"lost this skill through lack of practice\\".Current Biography 1941, p. 353 February 1927, he finally sold a story. It was bought by The United Brethren Publishing House of Dayton. It was called \\"The Two Dollar Raise\\" and he got a cheque through for three dollars and fifty cents. Answering an ad in the Chicago Tribune, he got a job editing a small farm paper. In September he got a better paid job in Iowa and soon found himself editing five farm papers. He had much money and even wrote some articles for the papers but found he had no time to write the stories he wanted to write. In 1932 the Depression hit, and he lost his job. 1932 to 1934 were his bad years. He wrote and wrote, many stories typed out on an old \\"Remington\\" but of the Sunday School stories, the spicy sex stories, the detective stories, the sports stories, the love stories, very few sold, with some companies paying him as little as a quarter of a cent per word. He had a few successes and remained in Mt. Morris, Illinois for 14 months before deciding to head to New York on July 1, 1934. There were numerous publishing houses in New York and he could save money on postage but this led to him walking miles to deliver manuscripts as he had so little money, not even enough for food most of the time. He stayed in a room in the Forty Fourth Street Hotel ($10.50 per week). In his book, The Pulp Jungle (1967), Gruber details the struggles (for a long time, at least once a day he had tomato soup, which was free hot water in a bowl, with free crackers crumbled in and half a bottle of tomato sauce added) he had for a few years and numerous fellow authors he became friendly with, many of whom were famous or later became famous. Early December 1934 and with endless rejection slips, he got a phone call from Rogers Terrill. Could he do a 5,500 word filler story for Operator #5 pulp magazine by next day? He did and got paid. Even better, they wanted another one next month, and another. He was then asked to do a filler for Ace Sports pulp, which sold. Gruber's income from writing in 1934 was under $400. In 1935, his stories were suddenly wanted and he earned $10,000 that year. His wife came to live with him (she had been living with relatives) and he lived the good life, moving into a big apartment and buying a Buick ($750). January 1942, Gruber decided to try Hollywood, having heard about the huge sums some stories sold for and stayed there till 1946. Gruber‚Äîwho stated that only seven types of Westerns existed‚Äîwrote more than 300 stories for over 40 pulp magazines, as well as more than sixty novels, which had sold more than ninety million copies in 24 countries, sixty five screenplays, and a hundred television scripts. Twenty five of his books have sold to motion pictures, and he created three TV series: Tales of Wells Fargo, The Texan and Shotgun Slade. His first novel, The Peace Marshall, which was rejected by every agent in New York at the time, became a film called \\"The Kansan\\", starting Richard Dix. The book has been reprinted many times with total sales of over one million copies. He bragged that he could write a complete mystery novel in 16 days and then use the other 14 days of the month to knock out a historical serial for a magazine.Current Biography 1941, pp. 352‚Äì353 His mystery novels included The French Key (for which he sold the motion picture rights for $14,000 in 1945) and The Laughing Fox. He was a social drinker in the thirties (regular parties for authors were alcohol only with no food provided), being too busy to become a hard drinker, but later just about gave up alcohol.

The ghetto was closed from the outside in early October 1941. Some 12,000 Polish Jews were imprisoned there for the purpose of persecution and exploitation. Conditions were appalling; epidemics of typhus and scarlet fever raged. Beginning 22 August 1942 during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in occupied Poland, around 10,000 Jews were rounded up ‚Äì men, women and children ‚Äì gathered at the Umschlagplatz, and deported to Treblinka extermination camp aboard Holocaust trains. Thousands of Jews were brought in from the ghettos in other cities and towns. In total, at least 17,000 Jews were annihilated in the process of ghetto liquidation. Hundreds of Jews were shot on the spot during the house- to-house searches, along with staff and patients of the Jewish hospital. Over 1,500 persons were temporarily spared death in order to continue supplying slave labour for the five camps set up locally. They were deported to Treblinka from the so-called \\"little ghetto\\" before the end of 1942. Only a few hundred Jews survived in hiding until the German withdrawal from Siedlce. History Prior to the invasion of Poland, Jews constituted around 50 percent of the town's population of 30,000 inhabitants. Jewish life in Siedlce experienced a revival in the interwar period. Many Jewish organizations sprung up, as well as printing presses, book stores and commercial establishments; there were several dozen Jewish bakeries, mills, metal shops, and jewelries. Almost all commerce was in the Jewish hands, sparking occasional labour disputes. During the invasion of Poland, the German Panzer Division Kempf rolled into Siedlce on 12 September 1939 after a fierce battle along the Bug River with the Polish Modlin Army which surrendered soon afterwards. Siedlce was strafed and bombed several times by the Luftwaffe. In October, the persecution of Jews by the new German administration began with the arrest of 50 most prominent individuals. The creation of the Jewish Judenrat Council was ordered at the end of November. Among its 25 members were Icchak (Itzak) Nachum Weintraub (chairman; former head of the Jewish hospital), Hersz Eisenberg (vice-chairman), and Hersz Tenenbaum (secretary, liaison with the Gestapo). On Christmas Eve the Nazis set fire to the synagogue and burned it to the ground, notably with Jewish refugees inside.Edward Kop√≥wka with English translation by L. Biedka (2007), Siedlce Ghetto.

In order to strike terror in overcrowded neighbourhoods, the German police organized a 3-day shooting action in March 1941. The formal creation of a ghetto in Siedlce was pronounced on 2 August 1941. The smaller number of non-Jewish Poles living in designated areas were ordered to move out before 8:00 p.m. on 6 August. The Jewish families (over half of the city's population) were given two weeks to relocate there, along with Roma people. The ghetto zone consisted of several small city blocks and over a dozen walkable streets in city centre north of the Old Square.Edward Kop√≥wka, Appendix 5. Map of the Ghetto in Siedlce. The Jews in Siedlce 1850‚Äì1945, pp. 175‚Äì226 (ibidem). The ghetto was closed off by a barbed wire fence, and cut off from the outside world on 1 October 1941 with only three gates leading out, guarded by Nazi patrols. =Life in the Ghetto= Public announcement by the Nazi occupation authority commanding the resettlement of all Roma people from the county of Siedlce into the Jewish ghetto, with the letter \\"Z\\" for Zigeuner (Gypsy in German) on their armbands. Conditions in the ghetto were appalling, with grossly insufficient quantities of food. At one point, 15 people lived in single rooms without sanitation. Jews were not allowed to own fur products. People trying to cross the fence illegally were shot in the back by the dozen. A typhus epidemic broke out in the winter of 194142. There were five labour camps set up by the Germans in the vicinity of the ghetto. # Camp I ‚Äì Army Food Storehouse No. 6 (Armeeverpflegungslager, A.V.L.) at the Polish Army base, with the active labour force of 100 prisoners (194042). The total number of Jews who passed through the camp was around 5,000. # Camp II ‚Äì The Reckmann Construction (close to the fire station). Active labour force: 500 prisoners (194143). The total number of 15,000 Jews passed through the facility; decimated by epidemic of typhus and scarlet fever. Remaining prisoners were shot on site during camp liquidation. # Camp III ‚Äì Building Inspectorate No. 8 \\"Kiesgrube\\" (at the ≈Åuk√≥w road). Active labour force: 300 prisoners (194143), housed in two barracks; with 250 grams of bread and 1 litre of soup per day. One prisoner is known to have survived. # Camp IV ‚Äì Wolfer and G√∂bel Road Construction (10 barracks, next to Brzeska Street). Active labour force: 2,000 prisoners (194142). Counting in the ill persons, released for threat of an epidemic, as well as Jewish men brought in from other settlements ‚Äì not from the ghetto ‚Äì some 20,000 Jews passed through the camp. # Camp V ‚Äì \\"Bauzug\\", at the railway station. Active labour force: 100 prisoners repairing railway tracks (194243). In early 1942 the Final Solution to the Jewish Question was set in motion by Nazi Germany during the Wannsee Conference; and the fate of ghettoised Jews across occupied Poland was sealed. The Treblinka extermination camp ‚Äì built north of Siedlce exclusively for the implementation of Operation Reinhard ‚Äì began gassing Jews in July 1942. The next month, on 22 August 1942 the Siedlce Ghetto liquidation action began in earnest, under SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Schultz. The Judenrat has been informed about mass \\"transfer to the east\\" personally by Gruppenf√ºhrer Ludwig Fischer, the governor of Distrikt Warschau.

The next day they were assembled into columns and marched to the train station in utter terror; the connecting streets were full of dead bodies. The Jews were crammed into awaiting freight cars (pictured) and sent to Treblinka, distance. While the Jews from out of town were gathered at the square on the first day of roundups, local Jews were forced into the cemetery on Szkolna Street.

Se√±eres was elected as a member of the Philippine House of Representatives representing the OFW Family Club party-list in the 2013 general elections. He is the father of former congressman Christian Se√±eres. Biography Roy Se√±eres was born on July 6, 1947 in Mambusao, Capiz to Federico Se√±eres and Lourdes Villareal. They formerly resided in the Compostela Valley and Davao del Norte, but eventually moved to Butuan. Roy studied at the Primary Butuan Elementary School, Butuan Central Elementary School, and Agusan National High School. He later earned a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Santo Tomas in 1967 and a Bachelor of Laws at San Beda College in 1971. He passed the bar exam the same year. Roy Se√±eres: The envoy is a \\"coffee magnate\\", The Philippine Daily Inquirer. March 31, 2012. He was also a columnist of the tabloid, Pilipino Star Ngayon. His column is entitled Amba's Briefs. Political career Se√±eres chaired the National Labor Relations Commission of the Department of Labor and Employment from 2002 to 2005. During the 2013 elections, he won a seat in the Philippine House of Representatives as the representative of the OFW Family Club party-list. =United Arab Emirates= He served as a labor attach√© in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates from 1983 to 1989. During his tenure as a labor attach√©, his residence served as a refuge for Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) who fled from their employers. This would lead to the establishment of the first Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) center in the Emirati city. Se√±eres was instrumental in the handling of the case of Sarah Balabagan, an OFW who was on death row in the UAE for stabbing her male employer. The OFW justified her deed as an act of self-defence against rape. Through his reported connections with the royal family of Abu Dhabi, he helped secure a pardon for the migrant worker, having convinced the UAE authorities that Balabagan was only 15 years old and not 22 as indicated in her falsified passport. =Presidential bid= Se√±eres first bared his intention to run for the Philippine Presidency on October 20, 2014, during the launch of his Respect our Security of Employment (ROSE) movement in Butuan. He reiterated his plan for candidacy in the 2016 presidential election one year later during a briefing in the House of Representatives. Under the Partido ng Manggagawa at Magsasaka, he fielded a vice-presidential candidate and a 12-man senatorial slate, and launched his presidential bid on October 11, 2015 at the Liwasang Bonifacio in Manila. At the time of the filing of his certificate of candidacy, Se√±eres was a Philippine congressman for the OFW Family Club Party List. He was mostly involved in labor issues having been an Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates overseeing the plight of Overseas Filipino Workers in the gulf state including the case of Sarah Balabagan. He was also the chairman of National Labor Relations Commission. Se√±eres' bid was the subject of humor during meetings in the Philippine House of Representatives, as it was viewed as a \\"stunt\\" by fellow congressmen. Se√±eres was chided that he needed first to run a serious nationwide campaign (i.e. senatorial) to have a chance of winning the Philippine presidency. Se√±eres subsequently expressed his hope that he would not be declared a \\"nuisance candidate\\" by the Comelec.OFW party- list rep to run for president, Philippine Star. October 8, 2015. Se√±eres expressed the possibility that the then-incumbent Davao City mayor Rodrigo Duterte would be his substitute candidate should Duterte become a pro-life advocate. However, Se√±eres later refused to substitute for Duterte and criticized the latter's inevitable decision to pursue the presidency, and claimed that Duterte should have endorsed and supported him instead. On November 22, 2015, he launched the National Headquarters of the Partido ng Manggagawa at Magsasaka for his presidential campaign in Las Pi√±as. Se√±eres said that he was neither expecting nor soliciting campaign resources from big business firms. He noted that other candidates were using private jets and helicopters owned by mall owners, and claimed that those candidates became beholden to those who provided them such transport. For his campaign method which he dubbed as a Kalyeserye style of approach, Se√±eres organized small meetings in streets and publicly accessible places such as parking lots. He said that the primary audience for his campaign were contractual employees of big shopping malls. Despite these initiatives, however, citing a failing health condition due to his long-standing bout with diabetes, Se√±eres finally decided to withdraw his presidential bid on February 5, 2016. =Campaign political positions= Labor Se√±eres campaigned against contractualization which he described as illegal under the Labor Code. He went further to say that major shopping malls were those mostly responsible for the practice of contractualization. He said that contractuals do not receive labor benefits and neither are given security of tenure. In the context of contractual workers employed in shopping malls, he argued that billions of pesos that would have been given to them as benefits (such as the 13th month pay) are utilized by their employers to build more malls in the country and abroad. Alleging that the government is avoiding the issue, he said that he decided to run for president because he can't make executive orders if he stays in Congress, adding that he would direct the Department of Labor and Employment to implement the law against contractualization if he is elected. He promised permanent employment to both workers in the private and government sectors. Capital punishment Se√±eres cast himself as a \\"pro-life\\" candidate, disagreeing with then-Presidential candidate Rodrigo Duterte's opinion that drug lords and syndicate minions deserve the death penalty, which the former described as \\"pro-death\\". Rodrigo Duterte Se√±eres was critical of Duterte, stating \\"irreconcilable differences\\" with the latter. He described himself as \\"pro-life\\" and diametrically described Duterte as \\"pro- death\\". However, it was reported by the Philippine Daily Inquirer that two Supreme Court justices, Jose Catral Mendoza and Bienvenido Reyes, pressured Se√±eres to withdraw from the presidential election in favor of Duterte in a meeting of fraternity brothers in Pasig on December 4, 2015. The four are part of the Lex Talionis fraternity which was founded in San Beda College. Seneres denied the newspaper report a week later, saying that he discussed other matters with the justices, and that two other lawyers in attendance were those who offered the possibility of Duterte substituting him.

Achalinus formosanus formosanus is ecologically and morphologically similar to the Taiwan endemic Achalinus niger; the two differ in some scale counts and characteristics. A study using genetic markers found these two taxa to be overlapping, warranting further studies on their taxonomy. Distribution Achalinus formosanus formosanus is known from central and southern Taiwan at elevations of asl. Achalinus formosanus chigirai occurs at low altitudes (below ) on the Iriomote-jima and Ishigaki Islands, both belonging to the Yaeyama Group. Description left Achalinus formosanus is a small snake growing to a total length of about . The whole body is iridescent under light. Head is small, oval, and without distinct neck. Body is slender and tail is moderately short. Eyes are small, bead-like; iris is black and indistinct. Upper head, body and tail is uniform olive, grayish tan, or black. Mid-dorsal row of scales on body and tail show a dark longitudinal line. Ventral surface is olive-yellow or dark gray. The young are usually black. Behaviour It is a nocturnal, terrestrial snake that probably preys on earthworms, slugs, and frogs. It is non-venomous and not aggressive. It is oviparous. Habitat and conservation Achalinus formosanus formosanus are found in montane humid forests, where they live in dark, wet micro-habitats such as the forest floor, rotten wood, and leaf litter. Achalinus formosanus chigirai have been collected in on a road at night and in a limestone cave in the daytime as well as in low grass along a path in the evening and on forest floor at night. No significant threats are known. It is not a protected species in Taiwan, but Achalinus formosanus chigirai is classified as \\"near threatened\\" in Japan.

The newspaper was originally published as a Democratic paper, but its party affiliation changed with the ownership. For many years the newspaper was the primary journal in Lincoln County. History The first publisher of the Lincoln County Leader was John F. Stewart.(c.1865‚Äì1917). The paper was originally published every Thursday. Subscription rates for three months were 50 cents, 75 cents for six months, and $1.50 for a year. In 1893, Stewart had moved to Toledo, Oregon from Woodburn, a town in the Willamette Valley, where he had been publishing a paper called the World, which was operating in competition with the Independent. Stewart's plan was to start a new newspaper in a town without competition. Toledo seemed promising, as it was then the county seat of Lincoln County, and a rail terminus. The first issue, Volume 1, Number 1, was published on March 9, 1893. The original printing press was small, consisting of an \\"army\\" model, which was placed upon a dry goods box. It was slow, producing one page at a time. Type was handset on a \\"kid\\" typesetter. Under Stewart, the Leader supported the Democratic Party as well as the right to vote of Native Americans living on the Siletz Indian reservation. Stewart became the county judge of Lincoln County in 1898. The Leader was originally a Democratic paper, and remained so for over four years while it was under the ownership of John F. Stewart. Stewart then sold the newspaper to Wesley L. Davis. Davis was a Republican, and as such he changed the editorial leanings of the paper. In 1893, Davis had been the publisher of the Silverton Tribune. However, less than a year after he bought the Leader, Davis sold the paper to Robert E. Collins. Collins in turn only held the paper for a few months before selling it to Charles F. and Ada E. Soule. The Soules were Republicans, and often criticized William Jennings Bryan, a leading national Democrat at the time. The first issued under the Soules was published on Friday, September 15, 1899. The Soules also consolidated the operations of the Leader with another newspaper, the Toledo Tug, with the Tug losing its identity. On September 1, 1907, the paper came back into the control of Robert E. Collins. Collins continued the Republican affiliation of the paper which it had assumed since the sale by Stewart. On June 14, 1915, a new weekly newspaper, the Independent Enterprise, would begin publication in Newport, Oregon. The type for the new paper was set on a linotype machine owned by the Lincoln County Leader. With the addition of the Independent Enterprise, which was published in Nye Creek by Cecil J. Emery, there were then three weekly newspapers published in Newport, then a town of less than 1,000 population. The other newspapers were the Yaquina Bay News, which had been published by William Mathews since 1890, and the Newport Signal, published by John Fleming Wilson since 1907. Sale to the Hall brothers Collins had a partner, Fern Hayden, and together they published the Leader until 1922 when they sold it to the Hall brothers. Willoughby Hall then became the editor. Later editors of the Leader, up to 1939, included R.H. Howell and John E. Cooter, speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives in the 1935 regular legislative session.Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide: 1859 Special Session. Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on December 25, 2008. After the 1927 purchase, John E. Cooter became publisher and R.H. Howell became editor and manager. Soon afterwards R.H. Howell and his wife Edith Howell bought out the other stockholders. R.H. Howell had been active in Toledo affairs for a number of years, which included several years service as the superintendent of schools. For six years R.H. Howell was mayor of Toledo. A few years after the 1922 sale of the Leader to the Halls, Collins established a competing journal, the Lincoln County Herald. In 1927, a corporation bought both newspapers and merged them under the title of the Lincoln County Leader. In early November, 1933, the building which had originally housed the Leader in 1893 was demolished. According to the Portland Oregonian, for nearly 35 of those years, the building had been \\"a meeting place for many of the county's leading politicians and newspapermen during its time, and many of statewide fame.\\" R.H. Howell died in October 1937. After his death Edith Howell took over management of the Leader. Post-war years From 1945 to 1948, the Leader was published by Milton H. Jones (c.1896‚Äì1958). In 1951, Elmer Price was editor of the Leader. Price published articles critical of local law enforcement. In early November 1951, Price was summoned by the Lincoln County grand jury and questioned about his sources for articles on local vice operations of the police. In October 1951, Price published a black- bordered editorial \\"mourning the death of 'official integrity and responsibility'\\". The occasion for this was that publication of the expenditures of Lincoln County had been suspended for one year. As of July 1960, the Leader was printed by the offset method. Offset printing was a process based upon lithography. It was different from letter press printing, and it eliminated the stereotyping process. In February 1967, Lee Irwin was the co-publisher of the Lincoln County Leader, as well as three other newspapers in Oregon, the Gresham Outlook, the Sandy Post, and the Newport News. Last years of publication In July 1974, the Lincoln County Leader was jointly owned by Walter Taylor, of Newport, and Lee Irwin, of Gresham. At that time Irwin and Taylor were also co-owners, with David Juenke, of other newspapers, including the then-recently acquired weekly Seaside Signal (circulation: 3,200) and the Tillamook Headlight Herald. Irwin and Taylor also owned the Newport News-Times, the Gresham Outlook, and the Sandy Post. In 1975 the Lincoln County Leader won an award from the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association for general excellence for newspapers published weekly. The newspaper‚Äôs circulation at that time was 2,700. The Leader remained in operation until 1987.

This ultimately led to John Harris entering the Sugar refining business himself with his two sons and in 1784 he bought a business in Lewins Mead. Early political career On 12 September 1776, John was made Common Councillor and Sheriff. A year later, in this role, he was the recipient of the letter from Edmund Burke on the rights of Americans. It was called \\" A Letter to John Farr and John Harris, Esqrs. Sheriffs of the City of Bristol on the Affairs of America‚Äù. This presented a sympathetic view of the plight of Americans during the early years of the American War of Independence. In 1788 he became a Sheriff of the City of Bristol for the second time. Anti-Slavery Campaign Around this time he became involved in the anti-slavery campaign. The first meeting in Bristol was held in January 1788 and with other Aldermen, John Harris was a supporter. The next year, however, he switched sides and was part of an opposing committee that promoted greater regulation for the trade. This highlighted the conflict between his religious and his commercial life. In 1790 he wound up the sugar refining business with his two sons, John and Francis, but carried on in business with Francis. Mayor of Bristol In 1790 he became Mayor of Bristol but this was during a time of great unrest in the city. In July 1791 he wrote to the Government after a letter had been received threatening that 900 mechanics would pull down all the Presbyterian meeting houses in the city. Instructions were sent for detachments of the 3rd Dragoon Guards at Trowbridge and Bradford on Avon to be ready to assist the Bristol magistrates if called upon. In September the troops were stood down after no disturbances arose. Later life In 1791, John was president of the Anchor Society, a charitable organisation. In 1795, John sold the Lewins Mead refinery and went into business with George Daubeny at Halliers Lane John Harris died on Wednesday 20 May 1801 and was buried at Broadmead Baptist Burial Ground in Redcross Street on 29 May 1801  References  Category:1725 births Category:1801 deaths Category:Mayors of Bristol Category:English Baptists Category:18th-century Baptists Category:People from Bristol ","title":"John Harris (Bristol)"},{"id":"48429944","text":"Karo () is a 1937 adventure-war film directed by Artashes Hay-Artyan and S.

He has the privilege of being the final guest on the ‚ÄúRadio Sport Breakfast‚Äù for 2019. Early career Originating from the Northland Region of New Zealand, Goodhue was born in the city of Whangarei and raised on a farm at Whananaki near Hikurangi, New Zealand, along with older brother Cameron and twin Josh who both went on to become professional rugby players. He attended Mount Albert Grammar School in Auckland along with his twin who captained their first XV while Jack was vice captain as they won 17 of their 20 games in 2013. Following graduation, he moved to New Zealand's South Island in order to study Agriculture at Lincoln University and while there he played both Colts and Division 1 rugby for them, winning titles at both levels. Senior career Despite not making the initial Canterbury squad for the 2014 ITM Cup, he forced his way into their match day plans during the year and went on to make 5 appearances and score 2 tries for them before concussion ended his season prematurely. After starting the first 2 games of the following season, he suffered ACL and MCL knee injuries in a game against which ruled him out for almost a year. He returned to full fitness for 2016 and was in fine form with 3 tries in 11 games as Canterbury lifted their 8th Premiership title in 9 years with a 43-27 victory over Tasman in the final. Super Rugby Following his season-ending injury in 2015, Goodhue was named as a medical exemption player in the wider training group ahead of the 2016 Super Rugby season. His extensive rehabilitation meant that he did not get on the field at all during the year, however his form for Canterbury in the latter part of 2016 meant that he was promoted to the full Crusaders squad for 2017 as part of a new deal which saw him contracted to the Christchurch-based franchise until 2019. Goodhue was not expected to get as much game time as he eventually did in 2017, due to the presence of fellow rising star David Havili and the fact that All Black midfielder Seta Tamanivalu had shifted south to the Crusaders for the 2017 Super Rugby season, coming from the Chiefs. Goodhue became a regular starter for the Crusaders in his debut season however, with Tamanivalu changing positions to the left wing while Havili became the first-choice fullback due to an Israel Dagg knee injury- leaving Goodhue as All Black Ryan Crotty's midfield partner for the majority of the season. Goodhue started in all three playoff rounds of the competition, scoring the Crusaders' second try of the Grand Final in Johannesburg 11 minutes into the game, finishing his debut Super Rugby season with a 25-17 win over the Lions in the final. On 10 June 2017, Goodhue started alongside Havili in a midfield partnership against the touring British and Irish Lions team. Goodhue lasted the whole 80 minutes, but the Crusaders ultimately lost 3-12. In 2018 the Crusaders won their second title in two years where he started at centre against the Lions in a repeat of last years final. The Crusaders won 37-18. Jack Goodhue was again a part of the Crusaders success in 2019 however he broke his finger against the Hurricanes in the semi-final. Because of this, Goodhue missed the final against the Jaguares making it to the final for the first time. The Crusaders won 19-3 making it three straight titles for them and Jack Goodhue International Goodhue represented the All Blacks Sevens twice in 2015 at the USA and Wellington competitions. He also won the 2015 World Rugby Under 20 Championship with New Zealand under-20, scoring two tries in five matches and captaining the side in one game. Goodhue was included as an injury cover for Ryan Crotty in the All Blacks' 33-man squad for the 2017 Pasifika Challenge against Samoa and three-test series against the British and Irish Lions. Goodhue and fellow uncapped midfielders Ngani Laumape and Jordie Barrett were surprise inclusions in the squad, with Highlanders midfielder Malakai Fekitoa excluded from the squad in their favour. Laumape, Barrett and Hurricanes loose forward Vaea Fifita made their debuts for the All Blacks in 2017's mid-year tests but Goodhue ultimately did not play, with the All Blacks selectors re- calling Fekitoa for the third test against the Lions following Crotty suffering another hamstring injury and Sonny Bill Williams' suspension. Goodhue managed to make his way back into the All Blacks squad and was selected for a New Zealand XV side as part of the 2017 end-of-season tour. Goodhue was named to start at outside centre on his debut in a mid-week fixture against a French XV on 14 November 2017. Goodhue had a good game, but this was overshadowed by his yellow card in the 68th minute. Goodhue was one of five debutants that day, as they went on to win 28‚Äì23, however this match does not count as an official test match. Goodhue made his official test debut on 23 June 2018 against France during the France test series where he started at outside centre. The All Blacks won 49‚Äì14. Goodhue scored the first try as All Blacks on 17 August 2018 against Australia.

Jayalalitha and her ministerial colleague, T. M. Selvaganapathy, were charged of misusing office to allow Pleasant Stay Hotel in Kodaikanal to build seven floors against the norms. The case and chargesheet were filed during the following DMK (Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam) government headed by Karunanidhi in 1996. Jayalalitha and T. M. Selvaganapathy were convicted in the lower court, which sentenced her to one year imprisonment to the two and three others involved. The case had political implications as the aftermath violence created furore in the state. The statewide violence resulted in the burning of five buses, damaging fifty buses and leaving 40 people injured. Three girls students of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University were burnt alive in a bus in Dharmapuri . The three AIADMK party workers were convicted in the case, received a death sentence in the case in 2007, but it was commuted to life imprisonment. The Madras High Court acquitted her and other four accused in the case of all the charges on 4 December 2001 along with the TANSI land acquisition case. The Supreme Court upheld the order of Madras High Court on 24 November 2003 on grounds of lack of evidence. She came back to power winning the 2002 Tamil Nadu assembly by-election from Andipatti constituency in March 2002. Background Jayalalithaa Jayaram (born 24 February 1948), commonly referred to as Jayalalithaa, is an Indian politician and three time Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu during various times from 1991‚Äì96, 2002‚Äì06 and 2011‚Äì14, 2015-2016. During April 1991, Mittal was permitted to construct two floors of his hotel named Pleasant Stay in Kodaikanal. In January 1992, he submitted a revised plan seeking permission to build seven floors altogether. His petition was rejected by Kodaikanal township and he filed an appeal. Not waiting for the appeal, he started constructing four floors of the hotel. Palani Hills Conservation Council (PHCC) obtained a stay from Madras High Court during December 1997. There was a legal tangle between the hotel and PHCC, which PHCC won. On 13 May 1994, the Jayalalithaa government passed a Government Order, G.O. Ms. No.126, which permitted Mittal to build five extra floors in a total of seven floors against the norms. Jayalalitha, Local Administration Minister Selvaganapathy, Municipal Administration and Water Supply secretary H.M. Pandey, executive director of the hotel Rakesh Mittal, and Chairman and managing director of the hotel Palai N. Shanmugham were the five accused in the case. It was quoted that P.C. Cyriac, who was the Secretary of Municipal Administration and Water supply did not authorise the construction was transferred and was replaced by Pandey. It was also inferred that the GO was passed by Jayalalitha, Selavaganapathy and Pandey, against the Architectural and Aesthetics Aspects Committee (AAAC) headed by the Chief secretary of the Government of Tamil Nadu. On 6 December 1994, the government passed another order G.O., Ms. No.317 with effect from 13 May 1994, preventing buildings from provisions of the Development Control Rules. on 31 March 1994, Mittal was ordered by Madras High Court not to use any floor other than the zero and first floors. He went on higher appeal, which was quashed along with the G.O. of 13 May 1994. Trial The trial was held in a trial court in Chennai and was presided over by a special judge named Radhakrishnan. The prosecution team was headed by N. Natarajan, Senior Special Public Prosecutor for corruption cases against Jayalalitha, conducted by Special Public Prosecutors S. Ramasamy and K.E. Venkataraman, Special Public Prosecutor R. Karunakaran and advocate Sunder Mohan. The judge noted that the First Investigation Report (FIR) was filed only two years after the incident on account of the higher officials and politicians involved. He also noted that there was pecuniary advantage to the hotel management, though it was not proved that the passing of G.O. in favour of the hotel management has no reciprocal benefit for the government officials involved. It quoted that Pandey, who knew the details about the case, did not follow the Secretarial functions of passing the file directly to Jayalalitha via Selavaganapathy. On 2 February 2000, the five were convicted and Jayalalithaa was sentenced to one year of rigorous imprisonment and levied a fine of 2,000 on charges of criminal conspiracy and criminal misconduct by a public servant. The judge in his order stated, \\"We have sufficient circumstantial evidence which proves beyond any reasonable doubt that Jayalalithaa, Selvaganapathy and Pandey committed criminal misconduct abetted by Rakesh and Palani, and all were party to the criminal conspiracy. Hence I am inclined to impose the minimum sentence contemplated under Section 13(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act\\". On 9 February 2000, the Madras High Court suspended the implementation of the sentence on appeal from Jayalalitha. Aftermath The supporters of Jayalalithaa were angered by the verdict, which led to statewide protests and violence, including damage to public property by AIADMK members. Two AIADMK cadres committed suicide by setting themselves ablaze. The violence resulted in burning five buses, damaging fifty buses and leaving 40 people injured. Major violence took place in the state capital Chennai where 22 buses of the state run MTC buses were damaged, leaving 27 people with injuries. The state bus transport was suspended for 24 hours and the police arrested 400 people across the state, with 317 from Chennai alone. The major violence was that of 2000 Dharmapuri bus burning, where three girls were killed. On 2 February 2000, seventy students from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, Coimbatore, were returning from a study tour in two buses. They were stopped by mob, who forced the students to alight. One of the men threw a petrol bomb, setting fire to a bus before all of the students got out. Three girls, Hemalatha from Chennai, V. Gayathri from Virudhachalam and Kokilavani from Namakkal were burned to death, and 16 others sustained injuries. The scenes of the bus burning were captured and broadcast the following day on Sun TV. The incident caused anger amongst the student community. Schools and colleges were asked to shut for a week, and students across the state held silent processions and protest marches condemning the act. The three AIADMK men who were charged in the act, went on to be sentenced by the High Court to death on 5 December 2007, confirming the lower court order. There were 25 other cadre of AIADMK who were convicted on lesser charges and sentenced to seven years of rigorous imprisonment. The verdict came at a time when the Tamil Maanila Congress, which was in alliance with DMK during the 1996 parliamentary elections, was supporting the AIADMK in the upcoming by-elections. DMK was alleging that it was the handiwork of AIADMK cadre, while AIADMK demanded a CBI (Central Buruea of Investigation) probe in the issue questioning the presence of DMK supported Sun TV crew during the time of burning.

The station has a large homestead and two cottages, each with three bedrooms. Stock are watered at 63 water points around the property. The traditional owners of the area are the Kuwarra peoples, who have inhabited the area for thousands of years. The property was initially established by Pierce and Gilmore who acquired the lease prior to 1901. They stocked the property with 1,000 sheep, 250 cattle and 50 horses. The property adjoined Ducie Downs at this time. Gilmore sold the property in 1926 to W. H. Nicholls. Sir Walter James then acquired the property in 1927. A new shearing shed was constructed in 1928 by James and his partner, Thurbyshire, with 5,199 sheep being shorn producing 116 bales of wool. In 1960 the property was stocked with 9,504 sheep, which were shorn to produce 270 bales of wool.

In 2009 the lease was owned by Nickel West, a subsidiary of BHP Billiton, and was managed by Simon Kopke. Prior to 2008 Weebo was running 8,000 sheep but was completely destocked that year after experiencing problems with wild dogs. Kopke introduced a herd of 200 goats onto the property for the domestic meat market into one paddock. The goats were being protected by an electrified fence and four Maremma dogs. The property was sold by BHP Nickel West in December 2015 and purchased by B & SL Prosser. Since purchase the station has been converted from grazing sheep and goats to cattle.

Titanium sponge plant is a manufacturing plant which produces titanium sponge, a material which has very useful applications in space programme and other strategic areas like aeronautics, light defence vehicles etc. The plant in India is the only one in the world which can undertake all the different activities of manufacturing aerospace grade titanium sponge under one roof. The material is an alloy product which is produced through Kroll process which includes leaching or heated vacuum distillation to make the metal almost 99.7% pure. History The importance of establishing the Titanium Sponge Plant was realised keeping in view of the country's huge demand and import of titanium and magnesium alloys from countries like China, Russia and Japan. Former President of India and scientist, Dr APJ Abdul Kalam highlighted about it in one of his speech at Kerala Legislative Assembly. The plant was fully commissioned in August 2015. Establishment The successful implementation has only been achieved after about twenty years of continuous research by the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL under DRDO). The project is funded by Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC under ISRO). Ranking India is the seventh country in the world to have such a complex structured TSP which has the technology to make titanium sponge and the first to have done all the process under one roof in indigenous manner. The company, Kerala Minerals and Metals Ltd. (KMML), has also won awards for commercialising the technology. Design and Capacity The plant has an intricate design to carry out realisation of Titanium alloy wrought products and fabrication of hardware. Work is being done actively to increase the capacity of the TSP for the proposed 10000 TPY. A memorandum of understanding has also been signed by the KMML with Steel Authority of India (SAIL) for a huge joint venture for preparing titanium sponge at large scale. India has the third largest reserves of Titanium containing minerals. India was also the sixth largest country by Titanium product in 2013. However, the high purity Titanium sponge(which has at least 99.7% Titanium) as raw material is still imported for aerospace applications from countries like Japan, Russia and China. VSSC realized the aerospace-grade alloy, having formula Ti6Al4V, at Mishra Dhatu Nigam (Midhani) in Hyderabad. Future Prospects The proposals for future include Mg recovery from MgCl2(Magnesium Chloride) to set up an additional facility on similar lines. Proposals are also there to expand the capacity which is presently 500 MT to 1000 MT.  Applications  The material produced by the plant is useful for liquid propellant tanks for launch vehicles, inter tank structures, gas bottle/liners and interface rings for satellites.

She spent most of her career at the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, where she was director from 1958 until her death in 1963. Biography Agathe Louise van Beverwijk was born in Amsterdam in 1907, and grew up in the city centre. She attended the University of Amsterdam from 1925 until 1930 and studied biology, focusing on the fields of botany, zoology and geology. After graduating, she took up a role as a biology teacher at a secondary school, and left after a few years to perform research on tissue culture at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam. She was opposed to the animal experimentation that her role required, however, and so she left the position. After a year of studying English and receiving her diploma in teaching, she began teaching biology at the International Quakers' School in Ommen. In 1944, when the International Quakers' School closed, van Beverwijk moved to Baarn, where she worked for the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (Central Bureau of Fungal Cultures). Initially she assisted and collaborated with the institute's director, Johanna Westerdijk, but van Beverwijk remained there for the rest of her career and was herself appointed director in 1958. She worked largely in the identification of fungi in the genera Fusarium, Pythium and Phytophthora. Her main interest was in an aero-aquatic subtype of oomycetes, and she published numerous papers about these species. One species, Vanbeverwijkia spirospora, was named after her in 1961 by V. V. Agnihothrudu in recognition of her contributions to the understanding of helicosporous Hyphomycetes. French mycologist Gr√©goire L. Hennebert named Spirosphaera beverwijkiana in her honour. Van Beverwijk was a member of the British Mycological Society and the Mycological Society of America. She studied for two months in 1946 at the International Mycological Institute in Kew, and spent time in Paris in 1948 studying under Maurice Langeron and Emile Rivalier. She toured mycological institutions in the United States in 1957. Van Beverwijk died in 1963 while holidaying in the Austrian Alps.

Nikephoros had two brothers, Theodore and Bardas, and was apparently the youngest of Theodoulos' sons. According to Arabic sources, in a battle at Hadath on 19 October 954 Theodoulos Parsakoutenos and one of his sons, either Bardas or the younger Nikephoros, were taken prisoner by the Hamdanid emir Sayf al-Dawla. The eldest brother, Theodore, tried to ransom his father and brother for Sayf al-Dawla's cousin Abu Firas, whom he captured in autumn 962, but it was not until a prisoner exchange on 23 June 966 that the Byzantine captives held by Sayf al- Dawla were released. The Parsakoutenoi supported the rebellion by his cousin Bardas Phokas the Younger against John I Tzimiskes (r. 969‚Äì976) in 970, based in Caesarea in Cappadocia. As soon as the loyalist army under Bardas Skleros approached them, however, they defected to the emperor. It is likely that the family was exiled thereafter, and only rehabilitated in 978, when Bardas Phokas himself was recalled to active service by Emperor Basil II (r. 976‚Äì1025) to confront the rebellion of Bardas Skleros. In the summer or autumn of 979, after Skleros had been defeated, several of his supporters remained defiant in the forts they controlled, from which they led raids. Nikephoros was sent to the Thracesian Theme, where he persuaded Skleros' partisans to surrender on the promise of an amnesty from the emperor.

The war began in 1591 when Ayutthaya invaded Cambodia in response to continuous Khmer raids into their territory. The Kingdom of Cambodia was also facing religious disagreements within the country. This gave the Siamese a perfect opportunity to invade.The first invasion was interrupted before it achieved its goals. The Ayutthayan king Naresuan returned two years later, eventually subjugating the whole country and finally sacking the city Longvek on 3 January 1594. Background Prince Naret, also known as the \\"Black Prince\\" (), was born in the city of Phitsanulok on 25 April 1555. He was the son of Phitsanulok regent Mahathammarachathirat and his queen consort, Wisutkasat. His mother was a daughter of Maha Chakkraphat and queen consort Suriyothai. His father was a Sukhothai noble who had defeated Worawongsathirat in 1548 and put Maha Chakkraphat on the Ayutthaya throne, thus receiving the regency of Phitsanulok. During the course of the second Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War, Burmese king Bayinnaung took Phitsanulok and made the Sukhothai Kingdom a Burmese tributary state. Naret was then sent to Bago, Burma as a hostage to ensure the king's fidelity. Following the Burmese‚ÄìSiamese War (1568‚Äì1570) the Burmese completely subjugated Ayutthaya, installing Mahathammarachathirat as their vassal and shortly releasing Naret in exchange for his sister. In 1571, Mahathammarachathirat bestowed Naret with the title of Uparaja of Phitsanulok, changing his name into Naresuan. In 1581, Nanda Bayin succeeded his father Bayinnaung to the Burmese throne. Nanda Bayin became suspicious of Naresuan after the latter failed to make a timely arrival during the suppression of the Ava Revolt. Nanda Bayin then ordered two Mon generals to assassinate Naresuan during an upcoming battle. The Mons however immediately confided to Naresuan about their mission, as they considered Burmese rule to be oppressive. Naresuan renounced his pledge of allegiance to Burma and reestablished Ayutthaya as an independent kingdom. After repatriating 10,000 Thais from Pegu and receiving the support of numerous Shan immigrants, Naresuan was able to repel four large-scale Burmese invasions between 1584 and 1590. Having cemented his control over the western border, Naresuan turned his attention to Cambodia. Ayutthaya and Cambodia had fought each other on numerous occasions since at least 1350. Cambodia had however entered a state of decline since the collapse of the Khmer Empire and limited its offensive operations to raids. Such raids took place during the first four Burmese‚ÄìSiamese wars, targeting Petchaburi, Prachinburi, Chantaburi, Nakhon Ratchasima, Nontaburi, Phra Pradaeng, and the city of Ayutthaya. The raids were characterized by forced population transfers aimed at repopulating Cambodia. Conflict The first campaign against Cambodia was launched in 1591, when the Siamese under general Phra Ratcha Manoo invaded through the Phra Charuk passage. Cambodian king Satha dispatched armies to Pursat and Battambang while also preparing an ambush in the Ranam forest. Despite initial success, the Cambodians were eventually driven out of Ranam after Thai reinforcements launched a second assault on the position. Pursat and Battambang soon fell into Thai hands, while the Longvek citadel became besieged. The siege lasted for three months, after which a combination of logistical issues and Cambodian counterattacks forced the Thais to retreat beyond the border. After warding off another Burmese invasion in 1593, Naresuan divided his army into four columns in preparation for another assault on Cambodia. The first column assembled in Nakhon Ratchasima, while aiming to attack Siem Reap and Kampong Svay. The second column was to amass recruits from the south of Ayutthaya and then march on Moat Chruk (present-day Long Xuyen). The third army moved on Banteay Meas, while the fourth army once more targeted Pursat and Battanbang. The four armies would then be able to simultaneously strike the already surrounded Longvek. The Cambodians had in turn assembled a force of 75,000 men and 150 junks that occupied key positions in Babaur, Battambang, Pursat, Banteay Meas, and Phnom Penh. Siamese scouts managed to detain a number of Cambodian soldiers who upon interrogation revealed the positions of their comrades. The newly-acquired information facilitated the fall of Battambang. A second battle fought in front of Pursat ended in defeat for the Cambodians, who were outflanked during the course of the battle. Three days later, the Siamese forces reached Babaur and began digging trenches around the city. By dusk Siamese sappers had mined their way up to the city's walls, thus initiating hand-to-hand combat. Cambodian prince Soryopor managed to fight his way out of the encirclement with 1,000 men while the rest of the defenders perished in the fighting. After reaching Lovek, Soryopor assumed direct command of the defenses as his brother Chey Chettha had by that time abandoned the city. Assisted by Spanish and Portuguese mercenaries Soryopor reinforced the walls with cannons and spikes, while also requesting assistance from Vietnam and the Spanish governor of Manila. In the meantime the Cambodian navy was overpowered outside Moat Chruk, as the Siamese armies slowly converged on Longvek. Siamese engineers began the siege by erecting earthworks that surpassed the city's fortifications in height, thus enabling them to fire directly at the city. The Cambodians responded by building a second wall that shielded the city from bombardment. On 3 January 1594, following an hour long artillery preparation, Naresuan's army stormed the city. Siamese war elephants went on to break the city gates, allowing the infantry to penetrate the inner walls and slay the remnants of the garrison. Despite the fact that King Satha managed to escape into neighboring Laos, 90,000 Cambodians including Prince were taken to Ayutthaya. Aftermath Following the Siam capture of the capital at Longvek, Cambodian royals were taken hostage and relocated to the court of Ayutthaya, kept under permanent Siamese influence, and left to compromise and out-compete each other under the overlord's scrutiny.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Sowmyanarayana Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Thirumamagal. The temple is known as the place where Ramanuja, the expounder of Vaishnavadatta philosophy preached the holy ashtakshra \\"Ohm Namo Narayana\\" to all people irrespective of their caste. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the gateway tower and the Ashtanga Vimana, which is taller than the gopuram. The temple tank is located opposite to the temple, outside the main entrance. Sowmyanarayana Perumal is believed to have appeared as Narasimha avatar to the Devas, the celestial deities. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Six daily rituals and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the float festival during the Tamil month of Masi (February‚ÄìMarch), Navrathri during September‚ÄìOctober and Vaikunta Ekadasi during Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary) being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by Sivaganga Devasthanam. Legend Shrines in the temple Hiranyakshipu, the demon king, got arrogant after he got boons from Brahma, which nearly made him invincible. He troubled the Devas (celestial deities) and they prayed to Vishnu for rescue. Vishnu was ready to take the Narasimha avatar to slay the demon king. The Devas pleaded with Vishnu to show the form before he could take it. Vishnu showed them the avatar, but not pleased with the vision, the Devas and sages pleaded him to show it again. Vishnu appeared in three forms of standing, sitting and resting posture at Thirukoshtiur. Since Vishnu showed his form after hardship (called Thirukkai in Tamil) of Devas, the place came to be known as Thirukoshtiur. Architecture Temple tank outside the temple Sowmyanarayana Perumal temple covers an area of about and has a five-tiered gopuram (gateway tower). The temple in enclosed in a rectangular enclosure with huge granite walls. The central shrine houses the image of the presiding deity, Uragamellayan Perumal in reclining posture on a snake bed similar to that of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are also housed in the sanctum. There two life size images of Narasimha, the avatar of Vishnu. One of them is shown holding the demon Hiranyakshipu and other slaying him. Though it is a Vishnu temple, the temple has image of Shiva in the form of Lingam, Vinayaka and Subramanya. The festival deity is named Sowmya Narayana Perumal made of panchaloha. The vimana, the shrine over the sanctum is Ashtanga in architecture, which has eight parts, namely, Adhistana (base), three Padas (struct), Prashthana (limb), Griva (leading struct), Shikara (cylindrical holder) and Stupi (top portion). The outer parts of the vimana has various stucco images of Narasimha, sages, Dasavatara and other mythical stories. The Ashtanga Vimana is found in only three places, namely, the Uthiramerur, Koodal Azhagar Temple and Cheranmadevi temples. The ashtanga vimana raising to a height of , is taller than the gopuram of the temple, which is not a common feature in Dravidian temples. The shrine of the consort of Sowmyanarayana Perumal, Thirumamagal, is located to the south of the main shrine. There are smaller shrines of Lakshmi Narasimha, Rama, Lakshmi Narayana and Krishna located close to the sanctum. The shrines of Andal, Narasimha and Manavala Mamunigal are found in separate shrines around the first precinct. The shrines of Garuda, Anjaneya, Ramanuja, Vedanta Desika and Azhwars are found in the second precinct. According to historian K.V. Soundararajan, the Rangantha temples in South India built during the 9th and 10th centuries have a systematic arrangement of subsidiary deities as seen in this temple along with the Appakkudathaan Perumal Temple at Koviladi, Veeraraghava Perumal temple at Thiruvallur, Rajagopalaswamy temple at Mannargudi and Rangantha temple at Srirangapatna. Religious significance Ramanuja, the preceptor of Vaishnavadatta philosophy, revealed the gospel of Ashtakshara to the world in the temple Sowmyanarayana Perumal temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Periazhwar, Thirumalisai Alvar Bhoothathazhwar and Peyazhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple finds mention in several works like 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. The temple is known as the place where Ramanuja, the expounder of Vaishnavadatta philosophy preached the holy ashtakshra \\"Ohm Namo Narayana\\" to all people irrespective of their caste. The place was the birthplace of Thirukoshtiyur Nambigal, the teacher of Ramanuja and who taught him the gospel and instructed him not to reveal it to anyone. Taking the risk of his life, Ramanjua climbed up the temple and revealed the verse to the whole world. Nambigal was pleased by the spirit of Ramanuja and named him Emperumanar (meaning my superior). Following the event, a life size image of Ramanuja was housed in the Ashtanga Mandap of the temple. Religious practises and festival The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Vaikasana aagama. In modern times, the temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub- caste. Six daily rituals are held at various times of the day and many yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the float festival during the Tamil month of Masi (February‚ÄìMarch), Navrathri during September‚ÄìOctober and Vaikunta Ekadasi during Margazhi (December‚ÄìJanuary) being the most prominent. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.

Sumte was part of the only exchange of territory between states of the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany) and West Germany. The location east of the river Elbe is unique for a community in Lower Saxony. Geography Sumte is located in 3 km distance of the river Elbe which would flood the area several times a year without levee. The Sumte area is characterized by wet grassland and fertile fields. Furthermore, the embarkment of the Elbe river resulted in several oxbow lakes of which the Lake Sumte is the biggest. The Sumte area has historically always been a rural territory. The nearest city with more than 100 000 inhabitants is Hamburg in 65 km distance (city center). History Lake Sumte an oxbow lake of the Elbe riverThe first documented mentioning of Sumte dates back as early as 1352 as Zommete, which is of Slavic origin and means catfish. The name indicates a founding of the village by Slavic people as fisherman's settlement. At times of the German eastward expansion German settlers mixed with the ancestral Slavic people and the old German village of Sumte was formed. Sumte belonged to the Kingdom of Hanover until it became Prussian province in 1871. After world war II Sumte belonged to the British occupation zone but was resigned to the Soviets, since it was the only territory in the British zone east of the river Elbe and the upkeep costs of this bridgehead would have been too high. Therefore, Sumte became part of the Soviet controlled German Democratic Republic. After the German reunification in 1990, people raised their voices for a small reunifaction, which means they wanted to belong to Hannover again, which now was the state of Lower Saxony. In 1993, the two federal states Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, which was newly formed and Lower Saxony signed a treaty to exchange the territory of Amt Neuhaus and thus Sumte belonged to Hannover again. The proximity to L√ºneburg and to the Hamburg Metropolitan Region lead to an economic recovery of the Sumte region. In October 2015 plans became public that the government of Lower Saxony plans to set up a refugee transit camp with up to 1000 refugees. These plans made Sumte worldwide famous, since the ratio of 10 refugees versus 1 inhabitant would have been unique in a developed country. After close inspection of the local infrastructure and two townhall meetings, the maximum number of refugees was reduced to 750. On 2 November 2015 the first 100 refugees arrived in Sumte. Locals and the ASB as operator of the camp, installed a shop, a kindergarten and a medical station within the refugee camp, which can be used by inhabitants of Sumte as well.

His holistic approach led him to integrate how the rapid advancement of technology and cultural changes affect mental health, resulting in a more humane treatment of mental patients thus putting the dictum \\"treat the person as a person\\" in practice. For this, he is known as the father of modern psychiatry in Thailand. Personal life Phon is the son of Sang Panich, a businessman who came from a noble family. Sang Panich was bestowed the title khun by King Vajiravudh for his honesty and hard work. The sixth of eleven children, young Phon was a devoted student who dreamed to be a doctor. He was sent to live in a temple under the care of a priest in preparation for his secondary schooling at Suankularb College. He finished medicine in Chulalongkorn University's School of Medicine in Bangkok at the age of 22. He married Pravas Rasanonda in 1935, the same year he became assistant director to Dr. Luang. The marriage brought forth three sons. Career Phon joined the Department of Health in 1929. From 1930 to 1934, he was provincial medical officer at Sakolnakorn where he developed in interest in providing comfort and easing the miseries of the mentally ill. In 1935, he became assistant director of the mental hospital in Thonburi under Dr. Luang Vichien Patayakorn who sent the young man to study and observe medical practices in Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia. At that time, straitjackets were used to subdue mental patients but Phon and his colleagues pushed for reforms, banking instead on gentleness and love. As more mental hospitals were established and as the number of mental patients increased, Phon's career advanced when the government sent him to train at the University of Colorado, Denver Psychopathic Hospital and at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Upon his return he was assigned as chief of a division on welfare at the Ministry of Interior, establishing an orphanage school which promote mental hygiene. He stayed on with the job even during World War II when many of contemporaries left the country in search of greener pastures. In 1942, he succeeded Dr. Luang to become the director of the Mental Hospital (Rong Phayaban Khon Sia Sati in Thai) in Thonburi. At the same time, he was appointed director of a new division in the Department of Health responsible for mental institutions, a position he would hold until 1954. When the war ended, he helped build parks within facilities and gave \\"happy names\\" to buildings. This practice of providing green spaces for patients still continue until the present day. Instead of using the donations to renovate the old director's house where he lived, he focused on upgrading facilities for the benefit of patients and hospital staff. He also became instrumental in sending young doctors and nurses abroad to study, with the hope that they will continue his work in the future. At an annual meeting of the World Federation for Mental Health in 1962, he talked about the problems posed by social and cultural changes to mental health today and is quoted to have remarked that: > \\"Wherever a population grows much faster than its economy--- and this is > frequently the case in the present-day world-- starvation, sickness, poverty > and mental health are specters on the horizon.\\" References  External links  * Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation Phon Sangsingkeo Category:Ramon Magsaysay Award winners Phon Sangsingkeo Category:1907 births Category:1980 deaths ","title":"Phon Sangsingkeo"},{"id":"48430586","text":"Notable people (and fictional characters) surnamed Landers include: Arts and media * Alan Landers (1940‚Äì2009), American actor * Ann Landers, pen name of several advice columnists in the Chicago Sun-Times * Audrey Landers (born 1956), American actress and singer * Harry Landers (born 1921), American character actor * Judy Landers (born 1958), American film and television actress * Karen Baker Landers, sound editor (also known as Karen M.

The meadows are grazed by cattle, and there are wetland plants of ecological interest. The site is in decline as it is being invaded by trees and shrubs and becoming wetter, and the Marston Vale Trust is working with Bedford Council and the Environment Agency to restore it. There is no access to most of the site, but there is access to footpaths through the site from Cardington Road.
