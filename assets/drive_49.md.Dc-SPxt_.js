He usually signed his work with the signature Charlie Plumb or Chas. Plumb. He also drew the topper strip Chris Crusty which ran above Ella Cinders from 1931 to 1940. Born and raised in Joplin, Missouri, Plumb moved at age 15 to Baxter Springs, Kansas, where his father, Carl H. Plumb, was a mining engineer in the Tri-state area of Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. After attending Baxter Springs High School, Charlie Plumb studied journalism, art and advertising at the University of Missouri and then worked as an artist and political cartoonist for newspapers in Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities. His parents eventually relocated to Ozark, Missouri.Chad. \\"Chattering Chat\\". Miami News Record (Miami, Oklahoma), July 4, 1937. Ella Cinders In the early 1920s, while Plumb was employed as an artist at the Los Angeles Times, he met screenwriter William Conselman, and the two created their Ella Cinders strip in 1925 for the Metropolitan Newspaper Service (later United Feature Syndicate). Initially, as the name implies, the strip presented a variation on the classic Cinderella story, but then it diverged into other plotlines, as noted by comics historian Don Markstein: :Ella was the stepdaughter of Myrtle \\"Ma\\" Cinders, a formidable woman who assigned Ella to the household drudge work while her own daughters, Prissie (\\"pinched and acid\\", to quote Conselman's description of his character) and Lotta (\\"fat and foolish\\") Pill spent their copious free time tormenting Ella. But Ella wasn't the sort to let that get her down. With her kid brother Blackie as an ally, she wisecracked her way through the most depressing of situations, finding solace in sarcasm. Outside the house, she had a boyfriend with the improbable name of Waite Lifter. She was pretty enough, in a 1920s sort of way, with straight, black hair and as big and bright a pair of eyes as you'll find anywhere in comics. But she wasn't a raving beauty, and tended to dress down, especially in the early years. Her \\"fairy godmother\\" moment did come in the form of winning a beauty contest, but that was only because the guy judging it picked her photo at random. The prize was relocation to Hollywood and a glamorous job at a movie studio. When she got there she found the studio defunct, but at least she was out of the \\"Cinderella\\" situation. For the next few years, Ella and Blackie kicked around Hollywood, doing melodramatic continuity in the dailies and one-episode gags on Sundays. She never really prospered, but did okay for herself‚Äîin fact, she even got married, though her husband, Patches, spent a lot of time away, having adventures.Markstein, Don. Toonopedia: Ella Cinders Influences Charles Plumb's Ella Cinders (June 13, 1948) Artists who influenced Plumb included N. C. Wyeth, H. M. Bateman, Edmund Dulac and Arthur Rackham.Galveston Daily News, January 5, 1940. In his spare time, Plumb enjoyed fishing. After living in Pasadena, California, he had homes in San Antonio, Texas and Cuernavaca, Mexico, which he called his permanent residence. He also traveled widely, and for some years, the syndicate received his work shipped from an island in the Pacific. Plumb and his wife had four children, Joanne, Barbara (who both lived in San Francisco), Peter (who was born in 1938) and Charles G. Plumb (who was a second-class petty officer in the Navy during World War II). Plumb employed a number of assistants and ghost artists, including Fred Fox, Joseph Messerli, Jack McGuire, Henry Formhals (who drew Freckles and His Friends) and Hardie Gramatky, ranked by Andrew Wyeth as one of the 20 greatest watercolor painters. Final years When Conselman died in the mid-1940s, his estate took over the strip and employed several writers, while Plumb received sole credit on the strip. Fred Fox took over as the strip's artist in the mid-1950s, followed by Roger Armstrong.

His brother, Bruce, is a former Major League catcher. Dave Robinson graduated from La Jolla High School and San Diego State University. He was chosen in the seventh round of the 1968 Major League Baseball draft by his hometown Padres, one year before they began play in the National League. In his second pro campaign, 1970, Robinson batted .256 with 114 hits for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League.Minor league statistics from Baseball Reference He then was recalled by the Padres after the September 1 roster expansion. On September 10, 1970, he played his first MLB game as a defensive replacement for Padre left fielder Al Ferrara; he played two errorless innings in the field, but did not come to bat. Two days later, on September 12, he started in left field against the pennant-bound Cincinnati Reds at San Diego Stadium. Facing veteran Reds' starting pitcher Tony Cloninger, Robinson received a base on balls in his first Major League plate appearance. Then, leading off the fifth inning, in his second time at bat, Robinson singled to right field and stole second base ‚Äî but was left stranded when the next three Padres made outs. The following inning, he singled to left field with two outs, again off Cloninger. In his last plate appearance, in the eighth inning, he was intentionally walked by relief pitcher Clay Carroll.1969-9-12 box score from retrosheet In his first MLB start, Robinson had two hits in two at bats, two bases on balls, and a stolen base, for a 1.000 batting average, on-base percentage and slugging average.Dave Robinson 1970 batting log from Retrosheet Robinson would have three more multi-hit games before the end of the 1970 National League season, including back-to-back contests on September 25‚Äì26 against the San Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park, in which he hit his two MLB home runs off Skip Pitlock1970-9-25 box score from Retrosheet and future Hall of Famer Juan Marichal.1970-9-26 box score from Retrosheet All told, in his first brief big league trial, Robinson played in 15 games and had 12 hits (also including two doubles) and batted .316.

The film, Billie Holiday‚Äôs screen debut, was directed by Fred Waller and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Symphony in Black represents a landmark in musical, cultural, and entertainment history as well as significant progress in Ellington‚Äôs own biography. It is a member of the first generation of non-classically arranged orchestral scores and perhaps most importantly, one of the first films written by an African American describing African American life to reach wide distribution. Background Symphony in Black depicts black life in America and the composition itself (A Rhapsody of Negro Life) is divided into four parts: ‚ÄúThe Laborers,‚Äù ‚ÄúA Triangle‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Hymn of Sorrow‚Äù and ‚ÄúHarlem Rhythm‚Äù. ‚ÄúA Triangle‚Äù features the vocals by Holiday and solos by jazz clarinetist and tenor saxophonist Barney Bigard and Ellington Orchestra regular, trombonist 'Tricky Sam' Nanton. It is important to note that while Symphony in Black is the title of the Paramount film, A Rhapsody of Negro Life is the actual title of Ellington's composition. The piece has been largely overshadowed by its successor, perhaps Ellington‚Äôs most best known extended composition, Black, Brown, and Beige and thus significantly less documentation exists concerning it. Despite that, on October 19, 1935, The Chicago Defender published an article entitled \\"Spotlites of Harlem\\", that announced the release of Symphony in Black among other current musical events of interest to readers.\\"Spotlites of Harlem,\\" Chicago Defender, October 19, 1935, 1 The film won the Best \\"musical short subject\\" Academy Award for its year.Gunther Schuller The Swing Era, New York: Oxford University Press, 1989, p.94 Revival In 1989, The New York Times published an article entitled ‚ÄúCelebrating the Variety of Ellington‚Äù, which discussed a revival of the piece by the American Jazz Orchestra in honor of Duke Ellington‚Äôs 90th birthday. \\"It contains some of Ellington‚Äôs most inventive, dramatic music\\", said Gunther Schuller (one of the conductor). Schuller went on to say, \\"If things had been right, he would have made a great opera composer. He takes crude scripts and writes music that underscores the scenario as well as any film composer ever did. It is greater music by the fact that Ellington went beyond the functional aspect of film music, and it‚Äôs great music intrinsically.\\"\\"Celebrating the Variety of Ellington,\\" New York Times, April 21, 1989, C.4. The other conductor of the Orchestra, Maurice Peress was especially interested in reviving Ellington‚Äôs rarer works, a description which certainly includes Symphony in Black/\\"A Rhapsody of Negro Life\\". According to the article, Ellington only recorded the piece once for the original score to the film, and in fact the recording is so rare, it does not show up in any Ellington discographies. Several of the symphony‚Äôs themes though were taken out and made into shorter individual pieces. Despite this, Schuller said, \\"‚Ä¶by and large, the piece vanished from memory, except in the minds of a few Ellington film collectors.\\" \\"It‚Äôs terribly important for these pieces to be performed\\", said Schuller. \\"No musical tradition can remain vital unless it‚Äôs performed live. No musical tradition can exist in a museum form. I believe that the whole idea of repertory in jazz is long, long overdue. It‚Äôs not yet caught on as a major idea, but consider that the history of jazz is 60 or 70 or 80 years old, so we have a tremendous amount of music that can be replicated. It‚Äôs no different than in classical, where you play Brahms with one sound, Debussy with another ‚Äì that‚Äôs the sort of care we have to bring to all this. This isn‚Äôt slavish imitation: it‚Äôs bringing the music alive, which it deserves to be.\\" Legacy In The Musical Quarterly, John Howland wrote an article entitled \\"The Blues Get Glorified: Harlem Entertainment, Negro Nuances, and Black Symphonic Jazz\\". In his analysis of the piece, Howland says, \\"the narrative content and musical arrangement of the film present an ideal microcosm of the hybrid cultural aesthetics that informed a special category of prewar, jazz-based concert works by popular music composers in Harlem.\\"John Howland \\"The Blues Gets Glorified: Harlem Entertainment, Negro Nuances, and Black Symphonic Jazz\\", The Musical Quarterly, October 17, 2008 He goes on to say that ‚Äúthe pantomime narrative of Symphony in Black depicts a celebrated African American symphonic composer‚ÄîDuke Ellington‚Äîand the world premiere of his racially motivated symphony, or rhapsody. The subtitle of this film, like many other rhapsody-themed stage numbers and jazz-styled concert works of the day, purposefully alludes to the inspiration and catalyst for the most symphonic jazz concert works of the 1920s and 1930s, George Gershwin‚Äôs Rhapsody in Blue. The identification of popular-idiom concert works and concert-style popular song arrangements is central to understanding the mixed cultural aesthetics and formal design of a work like Symphony in Black, which owes very little to the performance traditions, formal expectations, and generic conventions of Euro-American classical music.‚Äù Instead, Howland suggests that \\"Symphony in Black actually represents the upward-leaning‚Äîor rather 'glorified'‚Äîextension of a family of production-number-arranging conventions that were widely shared across dance bands, big band jazz, and the orchestral idioms of Hollywood and Broadway musicals, interwar radio, and the deluxe movie palace prologues of the day. Such concert-style popular music was central to the theater and stage (as opposed to dance) repertories of these orchestral traditions, and the spectacular jazz-oriented production number arrangements of many contemporary stage and film musicals were among the most visible extensions of these practices.\\" References External links *Symphony In Black (discussion and film) * Symphony in Black (video) Category:1935 films Category:American short films Category:American black-and- white films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures short films Category:African-American films Category:African-American musical films Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:Billie Holiday Category:Duke Ellington Category:American musical films Category:1935 musical films Category:1935 short films ","title":"Symphony in Black"},{"id":"33711048","text":"Drahnsdorf () is a railway station in the village of Drahnsdorf, Brandenburg, Germany.

It lies on the Berlin‚ÄìDresden railway and was formerly a railway as it was also served by the Dahme‚ÄìUckro railway and the Lower Lusatian Railway. All three railway lines had their own station buildings. These have been preserved and all three buildings are heritage- listed. Location  The station is located at kilometre 76.0 (measured from Berlin) of the Berlin‚ÄìDresden railway to the west of the centre of Uckro, a hamlet that is in the territory of the town of Luckau in the Brandenburg district of Dahme-Spreewald. The railway line runs approximately north-south through the station. The actual town of Luckau is about eight kilometres away to the east and the town of Dahme/Mark is located about 13 kilometres to the west. It lies to the east at the foot of the Lower Lusatian Ridge at the beginning of the Lusatian Border Ridge, a smaller range of hills, which the railway line crosses to the south. History The original plans of the Berlin-Dresden railway had provided for a route through the town of Dahme, but this failed because of the resistance of the local mayor. The same is said of a route via Luckau. So the line was built on the current route at a higher cost because of the ridges around Uckro. The station in the village Uckro was opened along with the line on 17 June 1875. In its first years of operation, it was called Uckro-Luckau due to its proximity to Luckau. There were stagecoach connections from Uckro to Luckau and Dahme. Station building of the Dahme-Uckro railway, behind are the tracks of the state railway In the following years there were further plans to connect Dahme to the railway. A larger standard gauge network was planned, but after all the investigations were completed, the only route approved was the Dahme‚ÄìUckro‚ÄìLuckau route. After the town of Luckau decided not to take part, the Dahme-Uckroer-Eisenbahn AG (Dahme-Uckro Railway, DUE) was founded on 21 October 1884.The 12.6 km long section from Uckro to Dahme went into operation on 31 July 1886. In the 1890s planning began on the building of a railway line from Falkenberg via Uckro, Luckau to L√ºbben. The Lower Lusatian Railway (Niederlausitzer Eisenbahn, NLE) went into operation between Luckau and Uckro on 20 December 1897. The extension to Falkenberg and the section between L√ºbben and Luckau followed on 15 March 1898. This line crossed the main line several kilometres south of Uckro, but the company built its own station close to the eastern edge of the state railway's station building. After the Second World War both private railways were acquired by Deutsche Reichsbahn. In October 1953, Uckro station was the starting point of one of the largest manhunts ever carried out by East Germany's Volkspolizei (‚ÄúPeople's Police‚Äù), when five young men from Czechoslovakia, the Ma≈°√≠n brothers and three of their friends, who are still referred to as either anti-Communist martyrs or as criminals, came here while escaping after a shootout as they attempted to reach West Berlin. As a result, a local police officer was killed. Two of the five fugitives were caught and subsequently shot. With the beginning of the division of Berlin and Germany in the late 1940s, the importance of Uckro station grew. Since the Dresden Railway ran to West Berlin, trains changed from the main line to the tracks of the Lower Lusatian Railway in Uckro to reach the eastern part of Berlin via Lubben. From 1952 the Dresden Railway was connected to East Berlin via the Berlin Outer Ring (Berliner Au√üenring). Nevertheless, it was often necessary for trains to change between the Dresden Railway and Lower Lusatian Railway in Uckro due to rail construction, heavy freight traffic or for military reasons during the time of East Germany. The tracks of the Lower Lusatian Railway are currently out of service On 27 September 1981, the mainline tracks in Uckro station were electrified from the south. The section to Rangsdorf followed shortly later and electrification was extended to Berlin in 1983/84. Passenger traffic towards Dahme was abandoned on 3 January 1968. Freight operations continued there until the early 1990s, but the line was closed in 1993. The importance of the Lower Lusatian Railway fell after the German reunification. Freight traffic had fallen significantly, there were no longer military reasons for bypass routes and there was growing competition from cars in passenger transport. The section between Uckro and Luckau was abandoned in February 1995 because of the poor condition of the track and it no longer used by regular passenger services. Passenger traffic between Uckro and Herzberg (Elster) ended on 27 May 1995. A year later, on 1 June 1996, passenger services ended between Luckau and L√ºbben and as a result the town of Luckau lost its passenger services. About the same time Uckro station was renamed Luckau-Uckro. The village of Uckro was not incorporated in the town of Luckau until 2002. In 1998, Deutsche Regionaleisenbahn took over the line of the Lower Lusatian Railway. It operated occasional seasonal freight traffic until 2008. Since then, the line and the corresponding part of Uckro station has been disused, but it has not been formally closed. The station forecourt was rebuilt up to 2013. This involved the building of a new bus station, 55 parking bays and a covered bicycle facility at a cost of ‚Ç¨580,000. The redesigned station forecourt was opened in Easter 2013. Passenger services Platforms of the main line. The building of the DUE are behind to the left and the tracks of the NLE are to the right out of shot. Since the separation of express and stopping passenger services in the late 19th century, Uckro has been mostly served by stopping trains; express (Schnellzug ) and semi-fast (Eilzug) trains have rarely stopped there. On the main line, four daily stopping trains and a semi-fast train stopped in 1939 and there were two stopping trains and a semi-fast on weekends. An express train running to the south from Berlin to Chemnitz also stopped at the station. On the NLE, three pairs of trains ran towards Falkenberg and eight towards Luckau. On the line to Dahme, four passenger trains and three buses were operated by the railway company.German railway timetable, summer 1939 After the Second World War the level of services was similar. In 1960, four pairs of trains on the main line stopped in Uckro, but express trains did not stop there. On the NLE, the level of services was identical to that in 1939, with six pairs running to Dahme (five pairs on Sundays).Timetable of Deutsche Reichsbahn, summer 1960 With the exception of thinning out of services to Dahme and their subsequent abandonment, the level of services remained similar until the 1990s. Infrastructure  Listed railway workers' residence The station complex consists of three independent juxtaposed stations. While they were generally all called Uckro in the public timetables, the in-house names of the stations of the DUE and the NLE were Uckro West and Uckro S√ºd (south). The installations of the Berlin-Dresden railway are somewhat above the level of the surrounding terrain. The tracks consist of two through tracks and two outside platform tracks with outside platforms. A station tunnel connects the two platforms. The station building is located east of the tracks and connects to a paved station forecourt. On the other side of the forecourt is the station building of the Lower Lusatian Railway and its tracks lay behind station building. The installations of the Dahme-Uckro Railway were on the other side of the main line. Its tracks have been dismantled. The whole \\"Uckro station complex\\", consisting of the \\"station building of the Berlin-Dresden railway, including of the station forecourt, the station building of Lower Lusatian Railway and the station building of the Dahme‚ÄìUckro railway, including its toilet block\\" are a heritage-listed site. The complex also includes a \\"residential house for railway staff with a stable building\\" to the south of the station forecourt. The track layouts of the two private railways were relatively less extensive, since the centres of operations of both companies was not in Uckro but in Dahme and Luckau. The DUE had only two tracks at the station building, while the NLE had five tracks with a loading track. South of the tracks of the passenger operations are the connecting tracks from the main line to the branch lines and the former freight sidings of the main line.

He was born at Swansea, Glamorgan. Having played since his teens for Swansea Cricket Club, the Glamorgan Second XI since 1995, as well as having spent time on the Lord's groundstaff where he played for MCC Young Cricketers in 1996, Law eventually made his first-class debut for Glamorgan in 1997 against Oxford University, hitting his first ball of the match for four and eventually ending on 38 not out in Glamorgan's second-innings. This was his only first-class appearance that season, though he made his List A debut, playing in Glamorgan's final two fixtures of the 1997 AXA Life League against Surrey and Essex. During this season, Law also appeared once for Wales Minor Counties against Herefordshire in the Minor Counties Championship, while the following season he would make a single MCCA Knockout Trophy appearance for the club against the Warwickshire Cricket Board. His performances encouraged then Glamorgan coach Duncan Fletcher, who considered Law to have natural flair and graceful timing, to give him an extended run in the Glamorgan side the following season, following the retirement of Hugh Morris at the end of the 1997 season. Over the coming three seasons, he made a total of 22 further first-class appearances, the last of which came against Nottinghamshire in the 2000 County Championship. In total, he scored 883 runs at an average of 28.48, with a high score of 131. This innings of note came against Lancashire at Colwyn Bay in 1998. Though he struggled for consistency, he still made notable contributions to the Glamorgan cause, notably against Lancashire at Blackpool in 1999 when he held out against Muttiah Muralitharan for over four hours in making 53 in Glamorgan's second-innings, though Lancashire still won the game by 10 wickets. Law was utilised more in first-class cricket, making just nine further List A appearances following his debut in that format in 1997. He played his final List A match against Middlesex in the 2000 National League. Law struggled during the opportunities he was given in this format, scoring just 104 runs at an average of 11.55, with a high score of 24. Having failed to secure a regular place in the Glamorgan team during the 2000 season, Law was released by county at the end of that season.

Trio Reynoso was composed of singer/accordionist Pedro Reynoso, percussionist Francisco Esquea, singer and g√ºira player Domingo Reynoso, and marimbero and g√ºirero Antonio Rosario Almonte(chirichito) who is known as one of the best g√ºireros of all time and they laid the foundations of a new local mainstream called bachata-merengue. They were considered the most popular Latin group during the Trujillo and Post-Trujillo era. They became a well-known group in parts of Latin America other than the Dominican Republic such as Cuba and Puerto Rico. After the death of Pedro Reynoso in July 18 of 1965, Trio Reynoso had to get a new accordionist and lead singer. In the end, it came out to be Tatico Henriquez, who in 1966, recorded his first song with the group called \\"Lo Que Tu Me Pidas\\". Some well notable songs that they have recorded were \\"Juana Mecho\\", \\"El Gallo Floreao\\", \\"Canto De Hacha\\", \\"Juanita Morel\\", \\"Alev√°ntate\\", \\"Chanflin\\", \\"Mi Mujer De Oro\\", \\"Maria Luisa\\", \\"El Picoteao\\" and \\"La Lisa\\". Tatico Henriquez would go into the footsteps of Pedro Reynoso and become one of the greatest accordionists of the Merengue T√≠pico genre. He is also the most popular artist of the merengue t√≠pico genre that has sold more records than any other artist in the history of Merengue T√≠pico. In July 2013, the Association of Art Reporters included the \\"Tr√≠o Reynoso con Tatico\\" album among their collection \\"100 Essential Albums of Dominican music\\". In the Juana Mecho LP, it was a compiliation of tipicos that originally was never complete due to the death of Pedro Reynoso. In the end, Side A consisted of six songs by Pedro Reynoso and Side B consisted of Tatico's first six recordings as an accordionist and lead singer in the trio. For a short amount of time, Joseito Mateo, who is considered to be \\"The King of Merengue\\", played the tambora, especially in the Juana Mecho LP of Tatico's first recordings with the group.

It is sometimes an introduction to, or stepping stone to, consensus decision-making in which simple majorities have less power. The technique works by allowing people to speak on the basis of race, sex, and other group membership, with preference given to members of groups that are considered the most marginalized. The progressive stack technique attempts to counter what its proponents believe is a flaw in traditional representative democracy, where the majority is heard while the minority or non-dominant groups are silenced or ignored. In practice, \\"majority culture\\" may be interpreted by progressive stack practitioners to mean White people, heterosexual people, or men while non-dominant groups include women, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, people of color, and very young or older people. The \\"stack\\" in the Occupy movement is the list of speakers who are commenting on proposals or asking questions in public meetings. Anyone can request to be added to the stack. In meetings that don't use the progressive stack, people speak in the order they were added to the queue. In meetings that use the progressive stack, people from non-dominant groups are allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, by facilitators, or stack-keepers, urging speakers to \\"step forward, or step back\\" based on which racial, age, or gender group they belong to. A. Barton Hinkle, a columnist for the Richmond Times-Dispatch, has expressed the opinion that \\"lining up speakers by race and gender might not seem fair on an individual level\\", and suggests that proponents of the progressive stack care more about class struggle than individual concerns.

The station lies of the Berlin‚ÄìDresden railway and Halle‚ÄìCottbus railway and the train services are operated by Deutsche Bahn. History The Halle-Sorau-Guben Railway Company (Halle-Sorau- Gubener Eisenbahn, HSGE) opened the Cottbus‚ÄìFalkenberg/Elster section of the Halle‚ÄìCottbus railway on 1 December 1871. The town's original station building in the town, which was called Dobrilugk-Kirchhain, is now called the Alter Bahnhof (old station). It was used until the late 20th century as a residential building and Bahnmeisterei (the premises of the supervisor of track maintenance). On 17 June 1875, the Berlin‚ÄìDresden railway was opened together with the two-level interchange station (Turmbahnhof or ‚Äútower station‚Äù) at the intersection with the line from Leipzig and Falkenberg to Cottbus. The two lines were doubled in 1890 and 1909 and they and were both electrified between 1980 and 1989. A decentralised rail traction current converter plant built on the railway bridge on the line towards Frankena supplied electricity to sections of both lines. It was closed after 27 years of operation in July 2008 and replaced by a modern substation. In the 1980s, it was planned to upgrade the station as a node with multiple tracks on each line; this is shown by a widened abutment to the bridge at the railway junction. After the reunification of Germany, this plan was not implemented. Doberlug-Kirchhain station is classifies as a Category 4 station. It was rebuilt to enable use by the disabled in 2007.

After failing to show any worthwhile form as a two-year-old he made exceptional improvement as a three-year-old to win the 1928 Epsom Derby at odds of 33/1 in record time. Soon after his win at Epsom, Felstead was injured in training and never ran again. He later had some success as a stallion. Background Felstead, a bay horse standing 16.2 hands high with a white blaze and white socks on his hind legs was bred by his owner Sir Hugo Cunliffe-Owen at his Sunningdale Stud in Berkshire. Cunliffe-Owen paid 2,100 gns at the Newmarket sales in July 1924 for the mare Felkington who was then in foal (pregnant) to the Derby winner Spion Kop. The resulting foal was named Felstead and grew into a powerful-looking individual with \\"a rump on him which a heavyweight hunter could not better.\\" Felkington had been a successful racehorse and went on to be a highly successful broodmare: apart from Felstead she produced six other winners including the Gold Cup winner Finis. Spion Kop was a good sire of stayers, with his progeny including Kopi (Irish Derby), Bongrace (Doncaster Cup) and The Bastard (Yorkshire Cup, Leading sire in Australia). Felstead was inbred 3x4 to the New Zealand bred Carbine (see below), to whom he was said to bear a striking resemblance. Felstead was sent into training with the Australian Oswald \\"Ossie\\" Bell at his Delamere House Stables in Lambourn. Bell's involvement and Carbine's southern hemisphere origins led the Sydney Sun to describe Felstead's Epsom victory as \\"Australia's Derby\\". The first LNER Class A3 steam locomotive, a development of the earlier Class A1, was named after the horse. Racing career =1925: two-year-old season= Like his sire Spion Kop, Felstead made little impact in his first season. He failed to win in four races, with his best effort coming when he finished second in a \\"very small\\" handicap race at Chepstow. =1928: three-year-old season= According to his owner, Felstead was off his food in the early part of the year, and only made progress after being fed on \\"Bemax\\", a commercial form of wheatgerm. On his three-year-old debut, Felstead provided evidence that he had made significant improvement over the winter by easily winning a maiden race at Newbury. He was then placed in a seven furlong handicap on his first visit to Epsom before being sent to Newmarket for the 2000 Guineas. Given his pedigree, which suggested that Felstead would be a stayer, he produced a promising effort to finish sixth of the seventeen runners behind Flamingo. On his final race before the Derby, Felstead was moved up to middle distances for the first time and won the Davis Stakes at Hurst Park. On unusually hard ground at Epsom, Felstead started a 33/1 outsider in front of a huge and enthusiastic crowd which included the King and Queen. Fairway was a strong favourite, but lost his chance by becoming highly agitated and upset before the start. Felstead was ridden in the race by Ossie Bell's stable jockey Harry Wragg, a rider whose expertise in riding horses from off the pace led to his being nicknamed \\"The Head Waiter\\". The early pace in the Derby was extremely strong as Flamingo and Sunny Trace disputed the lead, going \\"hell for leather\\", with Wragg holding up Felstead several lengths behind the leading pair. Sunny Trace weakened early in the straight and Flamingo took a clear lead as Wragg moved Felstead up into a challenging position. Inside the final furlong Felstead took the lead on the inside and pulled ahead to win \\"quite comfortably\\" by one and a half lengths. The winning time of 2:34.4 equalled the race record set by Call Boy in the previous year. Shortly after the race a writer in Punch published an analysis of thirty-three Newspaper \\"prophecies\\" for the race, showing that there had been 19 tips for Fairway, 8 for Flamingo, 4 for Sunny Trace and 2 for other horses. None of the \\"prophets\\" had even mentioned Felstead as a place prospect. Felstead was rested after the Derby and it was expected that he would reappear in the St Leger. His reputation and potential were emphasised when Cunliffe-Owen reportedly turned down a ¬£100,000 American offer for the colt in July. The offer was the equal-highest ever made for a thoroughbred at the time. Felstead developed a splint soon after Epsom however, and by mid-August he was lame, ruling him out of the St Leger and ending his season. Attempts to bring him back as a four-year-old failed after further training problems and he was retired to stud. Assessment Felstead's injury and the premature ending of his racing career made him a difficult horse to assess authoritatively. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Felstead a \\"poor\\" Derby winner, although they placed him slightly ahead of his sire. Stud career Felstead had little success with his male offspring, but sired two excellent fillies. The better of the two was Rockfel who won the 1000 Guineas, Oaks and Champion Stakes in 1938, while Steady Aim won the Oaks in 1946. It is mainly through Steady Aim, the female line ancestor of Danzig that Felstead continues to appear in the pedigrees of modern thoroughbreds. Felstead died on April 9, 1946 and was buried at the Kingwood Stud at Lambourn.

Background In May 2004, the Indian Ministry of Defence (MOD) approved a Mine Counter-Measures Vessel (MCMV) programme. The plan was to procure up to 24 MCMVs to replace the 12 existing Soviet-made Pondicherry/Karwar-class ocean minesweepers that had been in service for the last 25 to 30 years. An order was placed with Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL) for eight Mine Counter-Measures Vessels (MCMVs). The hulls were to be made from \\"lightweight reinforced composites rather than steel to lower their acoustic and magnetic signatures and to better resist underwater explosions.\\"globalsecurity.org. \\"Mine Counter-Measures Vessel (MCMV)\\" Hence a request for proposal (RFP) for construction and/or technology assistance was asked by Goa Shipyard Limited from builders Intermarine of Italy, Kangnam Corp and IZAR of Spain. Kangnam and Intermarine were shortlisted for meeting technical requirements. Thereafter Kangnam bidded a lower price and contracted the deal worth $670 million with Indian Ministry of Defence in 2011. The first two MCMVs were to be delivered by 2016, followed by user trials and acceptance, while the remaining six were to be built by Goa Shipyard Limited [GSL]. In January 2018, the deal was cancelled by the Indian government. Some issues with cost and transfer of technology have also marred the deal. Mine- hunting gear As of 2011 RFPs for mine-hunting gear had been sent to Thales of the Netherlands, Atlas Elektronik of Germany, F√°brica de Artiller√≠a Baz√°n FABA of Spain and ECA SA of France. Indian public sector firm Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL) was expected to supply the fire control radar for the vessel. BEL entered a joint venture with OTO Melara of Italy to supply 30 mm guns. In 2014, the Ministry of Defence canceled a 2008 global tender in which Kangnam Corporation had emerged as the winner because of the South Korean company's alleged use of defense agents in pursuing the deal, which overseas defense companies are not allowed to do under Indian law. Subsequently, Goa Shipyard Limited was awarded a $5 billion noncompetitive contract in 2014. In September 2015, it floated a global expression of interest (EOI) from companies willing to transfer the technology to build the vessels. In February 2016, Kangnam Corporation responded and was the sole respondent to the EOI, leading to a single vendor situation but was accepted by the Ministry of Defence. Kangnam Corporation will transfer technology and help in the production of the MCMVs and will be paid about $1 billion in the form of a technology transfer fee. Indian Navy has a total requirement of 24 MCMV's and there will be an additional order of 12 MCMV's to top the current order of 12 MCMVs. The construction of the first vessel is expected to begin in April 2018 with deliveries to be completed between April 2021 and April 2026.

It is a community minded congregation with a global sensitivity. Christ Church exists to \\"Unite People to God and People to People\\". The Lord continues to be a source of transformation for every person who comes through its doors. It is the hope of Christ Church that spiritual needs will be met, and that physical and emotional concerns are addressed as God is sought through praise and worship. Christ Church came into existence in June 1986 when Pastors David and Marlinda Ireland joined hearts with six other adults who were committed to seeing the gospel of Jesus Christ heal broken lives. Throughout the years, as the congregation began to thrive, it became necessary to rent facilities to accommodate the growth. The rental of temporary facilities throughout New Jersey contributed greatly to the dramatic growth as well as to the diversity of the congregation. In 1994, the congregation reached approximately 500 members and after nearly eight years of renting, it became necessary to find a permanent home for the ministry. In October of the same year, Christ Church acquired and began restoration on the present facility, a 900-seat Romanesque Cathedral in Montclair, New Jersey. Pastors David and Marlinda's vision for the region increased over time. This led to the purchase of a 107-acre campus in Rockaway, New Jersey which was renovated and opened for worship in 2009; complementing the metropolitan cathedral in Montclair. It is also the location of the administrative offices. To keep pace with the demands of the ministry, the church developed a full-time staff with responsibilities ranging from accounting and finance, community development, media production, counseling, administration of children's ministries to pastoral care. This broad-based staff, along with over 1,200 volunteer leaders, and hundreds of other volunteers affords the opportunity to provide a myriad of services to the community and church family. Today, the church family has several thousand families, representing approximately 70 different nationalities. To accommodate the needs and schedules of the congregation, Christ Church offers a number of weekend worship services along with various classes and small group activities for weekly bible-based instruction.

Career  Mason College, now the University of Birmingham Sonnenschein was educated at University College School and then in 1868 at University College London. He was appointed Oxford professor of Greek and Latin at Mason College (afterwards the University of Birmingham) in 1883, staying there until 1918. He was a Plautine scholar, publishing editions of Captivi (1879), Mostellaria (1884), and Rudens (1891). He took up the reform of grammar teaching, and published the \\"Parallel Grammar\\" series. With John Percival Postgate, he founded the Classical Association in 1903. Much of his grammatical research was summed up in The Unity of the Latin Subjunctive (1910) and The Soul of Grammar (1927). He insisted upon the humanities taking their proper place in the modern university, and took up the question of war-guilt during the European war; he was a very exact scholar.The Oxford Concise Dictionary of National Biography: Edward Adolf Sonnenschein.  Family  Sonnenschein was born in London in 1851, the eldest son of a teacher, Adolphus (Adolf) Sonnenschein from Moravia (now part of the Czech Republic) and Sarah Robinson Stallybrass. Edward Adolf Sonnenschein married Edith Annesley Bolton (1854‚Äì1943) and they had three children: Edward Jamie, who later took the surname Somerset; Christopher Edward, who was killed in a mountaineering accident in Switzerland on 22 February 1914; and Edward Oliver, who survived the sinking of HMS Pathfinder in 1914, and later took his grandmother's surname Stallybrass. (Because of the hostility to Germans during the First World War, two of his sons changed their surnames to English names.)  Swan Sonnenschein, publishers  Logo of W Swan Sonnenschein & Co William Swan SonnenscheinReading University: Special Collections Services, Reference Number(s) GB 6 RUL MSS 3280, 3282, 4058. (1855‚Äì1934), Adolfus Sonnenschein's third son and Edward's younger brother, founded the family publishing firm that was to become known as Swan Sonnenschein. As a young man William was apprenticed to the firm of Williams and Norgate, where he gained experience of second hand bookselling before founding his own company, W. Swan Sonnenschein & Allen, with the first of several partners, J. Archibald Allen, in 1878. This partnership was dissolved in 1882 when William married and the firm's name changed to W Swan Sonnenschein & Co. The firm published general literature and periodicals but specialized in sociology and politics. Sonnenschein was involved with the Ethical Society and published their literature. In 1895 Swan Sonnenschein became a limited liability company, and in 1902 William Swan Sonnenschein left to work at George Routledge and Sons, and later at Kegan Paul. Swan Sonnenschein was amalgamated with George Allen & Co in 1911. He changed his 'German' surname during the First World War to Stallybrass. He died in 1934.  Academic life and work  Sonnenschein was an influential classical scholar during his time at Mason College between 1883 and 1918, where he wrote prolifically. He edited several plays by Plautus, and collaborated with John Percival Postgate, forming the Classical Association in 1903, becoming its Secretary. He contributed to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (designated by the initials \\"E. A. So.\\"). His views differed from Otto Jespersen (1860‚Äì1943) a Danish linguist, which he explained in his 1927 book, The Soul of Grammar, as his answer to Jespersen's 1924 Philosophy of Grammar. C. T.

In March 1893 be became naval aide to United States Secretary of the Navy Hilary Abner Herbert, and during his tour, which lasted over a year, oversaw many of the details related to guests invited to the 1893 Naval Review in New York City, accompanied Herbert to New York aboard the gunboat and dispatch vessel , and escorted President Grover Cleveland from Jersey City, New Jersey, to his hotel and the following day from his hotel to Dolphin for the review. At his own request, Wood was relieved of his duties in the spring of 1894 so that he could become flag secretary to Rear Admiral John G. Walker, who was taking command of the Pacific Squadron at the time with orders from President Cleveland to observe and report on developments in the Hawaiian Islands, governed by a provisional government in the aftermath of the 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Promoted to lieutenant, junior grade, on 11 April 1894 and serving aboard the protected cruiser at Honolulu while in the Pacific Squadron, Wood in his duties supporting Walker observed Hawaiis Constitutional Convention and was present at the 4 July 1894 proclamation of that constitution as law, establishing the Republic of Hawaii. He returned to the United States with Walker in September 1894. Wood next became flag secretary to Rear Admiral Richard W. Meade, the commander of the North Atlantic Squadron, aboard the armored cruiser . When Meade retired in May 1895, Wood reported for duty aboard the receiving ship at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York. In September 1895 he took the torpedo instruction course at the Naval Torpedo Station in Newport, Rhode Island. In October 1895, Wood was ordered to the Herreshoff Manufacturing Company in Bristol, Rhode Island, as assistant inspector for the construction of the torpedo boats and there, and was present throughout their construction and sea trials. When his superior, Commander George A. Converse, was detached from duty as inspector, Wood took over as inspector for the construction of Du Pont, and, after being promoted to lieutenant on 16 September 1897, he became her first commanding officer when she was commissioned on 23 September 1897. Du Pont joined the other torpedo boats of the Torpedo Flotilla in a voyage southward along the United States East Coast, visiting most of the ports between Hampton Roads, Virginia, and Key West, Florida, before arriving at Key West on 31 December 1897. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= From Key West, Wood commanded Du Pont in patrol duties and operations as a dispatch vessel. On 22 April 1898, she accompanied the fleet to Cuba for operations during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, which had broken out that month. Under his command, Du Pont was part of the blockade of Matanzas, Cuba, until 7 May 1898, exchanging fire with Spanish forts there on 6 May 1898; carried dispatches on 16 May 1898 from Key West to Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, commander of the North Atlantic Squadron, in the Old Bahama Channel; carried dispatches from Key West on 20 May 1898 to Commodore Winfield Schley, commander of the Flying Squadron, off Cienfuegos, Cuba; accompanied ships carrying United States Army forces from the United States to southern Cuba and thereafter patrolled off Santiago de Cuba and carried out dispatch duty along the south coast of Cuba; and carried Sampsons dispatch announcing the American victory in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba on 3 July 1898 to Siboney, Cuba, for transmission to the United States. She departed Cuban waters for New York City on 3 August 1898, shortly before the end of the war. =1898‚Äì1917= After turning Du Pont over to the Naval Torpedo Station at Newport in the autumn of 1898, Wood reported for duty aboard the battleship . He remained aboard her until 12 October 1899, then transferred to the armored cruiser and journeyed aboard her to Manila in the Philippine Islands, where she arrived in December 1899. On 11 February 1900, he became flag secretary to the commander of the Asiatic Squadron, Rear Admiral John C. Watson. In April 1900, he transferred to the protected cruiser and traveled in her back to the United States, where he was relieved of his flag secretary duties on 30 April 1900. On 26 September 1900, he transferred from Baltimore to duty as assistant to the lighthouse inspector in the Third District.

A Dzungar-Mongol army under the command of Galdan Boshugtu Khan was defeated by Qing armies personally led by the Kangxi Emperor. This decisive Qing victory in the early stages of the Dzungar‚ÄìQing Wars (1687‚Äì1758) effectively incorporated Khalkha Mongolia under Qing rule and relegated Dzungar Mongol forces to Inner Asia until they were finally defeated in 1758.  Background  Attempts by the Qing court to maintain an uneasy peace between the eastern Khalkha and western Dzungar-Oirat Mongols ultimately collapsed when in 1687 forces loyal to the Khalkha T√ºsheet Khan killed the brother of the Dzungar Mongol leader Galdan Boshugtu Khan in battle as he attempted to support the rival Zasaghtu Khalkha tribe. In defiance of orders from the Kangxi Emperor and the 5th Dalai Lama, Galdan swept eastward into Khalka territory in 1688, forcing the Khalkha Buddhist spiritual leader, Jebtsundamba Khutuktu Zanabazar and nearly 20,000 Khalkha refugees to flee south into present day Inner Mongolia and seek the protection of the Kangxi Emperor. Motivated by the threat posed by a strong, unified Mongol state under Dzungar rule, the Kangxi Emperor began preparations to defeat Galdan. After the Qing successfully lured Galdan's forces closer to Beijing with promises of negotiating a peace treaty, Khalkha troops supported by the Qing army ambushed them in September 1690 at the battle of Ulan Butung, 350 kilometers directly north of Beijing near the western headwaters of the Liao River. Galdan managed to escape to the upper Kherlen River, about northwest of Beijing, where he and his army encamped for the next six years. In 1691, the three Khalkha rulers declared themselves Qing vassals at Dolon Nor, ending the last remnants of the Yuan dynasty and allowing the Qing to assume the mantle of the Genghisid khans and merge the Khalkha forces into the Qing army.J. Millward, Eurasian Crossroads:A history of Xinjiang, pg. 91 Almost immediately, the Qing set about preparing the complex logistics necessary to support a planned 1696 expedition. This included procuring 1,333 carts, each carrying six shi of grain. In March 1696, the Kangxi Emperor departed Beijing, personally leading 80,000 Eight Banner and Green Standard Army troops and 235 cannon on camel back on an 80-day trek northwest across the Gobi Desert to confront Galdan. A second army was under the command of Fiyanggu, numbering 30,000 and to be reinforced with a further 10,000, was to trap Galdan, while a third, numbering 10,000, halted further to the east and would play no major part in the campaign.  Battle  Armoured Kangxi Emperor The Kangxi Emperor reached the Kherlen river on June 7, discovered Galdan had fled, and was forced to turn back due to dwindling supplies. On June 12, 1696, 5000 of Galdan's troops blundered into the Fiyanggu's western army at the upper Terelj river. Trapped between the Emperor's two armies, the Dzungars had little choice but to fight. The terrain consisted of a small valley with the Terelj at the bottom surrounded by hills. Fighting off sharp shooters, Qing troops successfully seized the surrounding hills and gained a strategic position. They bombarded Dzungar troops with their cannons and then advanced behind a wooden barricade. At noon, Galdan ordered all his troops to the center of the Qing advance, hoping to break their army. Although the Qing ordered dismounted cavalry into the fight, their center began to collapse. Suddenly, a detachment of Manchu cavalry hit the Dzungar camp from behind, capturing their supplies. As the Dzungars wavered, the Qing launched a massive counterattack supported by artillery. Galdan lost control of his troops, many of whom broke ranks and fled. Once encircled, the Dzungars were destroyed.Kychanov EI \\" Lords of Asia\\", Moscow: Publishing House of the \\" Eastern Literature \\", RAN, 2004 . . Galdan's wife, Anu was killed by Qing artillery as she led a counterattack which enabled her husband to escape. Defeated, Galdan fled west to the Altai mountains with his remaining guard of 40 or 50 men but died of disease on April 4, 1697 near Khovd.  Aftermath  The Kangxi Emperor's victory at Jao Modo represented the first time the Chinese military had successfully tamed warring tribes at its frontier. At the same time it ended Galdan's dreams of reviving a pan-Mongolian central Asian empire. Much of modern-day Mongolia fell under Qing control where it would remain for the next 200 years. Although Galdan had been defeated, the Dzungars were pushed to the western edges of the Qing empire where successive emperors would use Mongol allies, including Galdan's nephew Tsewang Rabtan, a long-time anti-Galdan Oirat chief who succeeded Galdan as the new Dzungar khan, to contain them until their ultimate defeat at the battles of Oroi-Jalatu and Khurungun in 1758.

Early plasters contained asbestos, but newer ones consist of a base layer of absorptive substrate panels, which are typically mineral wool, or a non-combustible inorganic blow-glass granulate. A first finishing layer is then applied on top of the substrate panels, and sometimes a second finishing layer is added for greater sound attenuation. Pre-made acoustic panels are more commonly used, but acoustic plaster provides a smooth and seamless appearance, and greater flexibility for readjustment. The drawback is the greater level of skill required in application. Proprietary types of acoustic plaster developed in the 1920s included Macoustic Plaster, Sabinite, Kalite, Wyodak, Old Newark and Sprayo-Flake produced by companies such as US Gypsum.  Basic composition  thumb Acoustic plasters are aesthetically favorable because it allows for seamless smooth application compared to panels that show visible joints. Some acoustic plasters contain aggregate, but better systems incorporate fiber. Acoustic plasters are generally applied at a thickness between 1/16‚Äù and 1.5‚Äù. Acoustic plasters consist of a base layer of absorptive substrate panels, which are typically mineral wool, or a non- combustible inorganic blow-glass granulate. A first finishing layer is then applied on top of the substrate panels and when dried, produces a first layer of sound attenuation. A second finishing layer may also be added to create a second system of sound attenuation. If the second density if less than or equal to that of the first layer, the sound attenuation of the second layer would be greater than the first and vice versa. This allows for the flexibility of changing the acoustic properties of the space.  Acoustic properties  Acoustic plasters can significantly reduce the sound reverberation within the space. Most acoustic plasters have a Noise Reduction Coefficient between 0.5 and 1.00. The Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) determines the ability of a material to reflect or absorb sound. It is a number between 0 and 1, which 0 being perfectly reflective and 1 being perfectly absorptive. The application of acoustic plasters helps to increase the intelligibility of voice, music, and other sounds under desirable environment. In addition, acoustic plasters are also fireproof and LEED rated. However, it can be more fragile, being affected by physical stress and humidity.  Advantage  Compared to acoustic plaster, acoustic panels are the most commonly used material for controlling the sound environment of space. Acoustic panels were often made of a mineral wool composition that is very absorbent of sound. Although acoustic panels are common in basements or recreational areas, they are seldom used in living spaces due to aesthetic reasons. Instead, conventional plaster or drywall systems were more frequently used in homes and other environments where interior aesthetics is a more important consideration but these are, however, not ideal in sound absorption. Limitations of acoustic panels or conventional drywall systems also affect the flexibility of room configuration and uses. Alternating the acoustic properties in order to address changing room functions would indicate changing the entire acoustic system, which is costly and time-consuming. In contrast, acoustic plasters provide a smooth applicable and a seamless appearance. It also allows greater flexibility for readjustment.  Application  Despite its advantage, acoustic plaster requires high levels of artisan skills in order to obtain the rated sound absorption coefficients. The proportions and recommended mixing time of the plaster must be followed strictly in order to achieve the desired result. To ensure seamless surface, it is recommended to start with a ceiling that is perfectly level. The absorptive substrate panels are then attached with its seams filled and sanded smooth. Layers of plaster coating are then applied to achieve a seamless smooth surface. Acoustic plasters may be worked to produce different surface textures but must be done timely after the application. Different types of mounting styles for acoustic plasters can also affect the acoustic performance of the system. These mounting types include direct to substrate, suspended or direct to framing, or a plaster only system that can be sprayed on directly to the substrate without the placement of any acoustical boards. Control joints may also be built into the system to prevent cracks within the plaster. Acoustic plaster is used in construction of rooms which require good acoustic qualities such as auditorium and libraries. Proprietary types of acoustic plaster developed in the 1920s included Macoustic Plaster, Sabinite, Kalite, Wyodak, Old Newark and Sprayo- Flake produced by companies such as US Gypsum. These superseded felts and quilts as a common preference of architects but were difficult to apply and so were superseded in turn by acoustic tiles.  Examples  = Institute for Contemporary Art at the Virginia Commonwealth University = The Institute for Contemporary Arts is a non-collecting contemporary art institution designed by Steven Holl Architects and located on the Virginia Commonwealth University campus in Richmond. The design by Steven Holl Architects emphasizes the fluidity of interior and exterior space and fosters the connection between technology and natural resources. The design, however, creates reverberant sounds that disturb the experience within the museum. Acoustic plaster was used as a remedy to address the sound environment without compromising design. The application of acoustic plaster significantly reduced the sound reverberation, especially in the 33-foot tall central forum, where or echoing would otherwise occur due to the high ceiling. = Auburn University Jule Collins Smith Museum of Fine Art = The Jule Collins Smith Museum of Fine Art is located at the Auburn University and features a collection of 20,000 pieces of art. As a museum originally constructed in 2003, the acoustics of the building, which were experiencing problems due to long reverberation times that made conversations within the space even unintelligible, needed some significant upgrades. Acoustic plaster was introduced to solve the acoustic issues. It significantly reduced the reverberation time and added a tranquil quality and brought a more comforting experience to the space.  Historic problem  Starting in the 1920s, asbestos had become a prevailing material to replace animal hair in the mixture of plasters. Due to the sound-absorptive and lightweight qualities of asbestos, it was also commonly used in the composition of acoustic plasters. The application of this type of acoustic plaster to the ceiling is often known as the \\"popcorn ceiling\\" due to its aesthetic texture. However, asbestos introduced health-hazards to the acoustic plaster, for both the users of space and especially for the workers installing the plaster. This became a major health problem of early acoustic plasters.

During the operation, which took place from 1 to 7 September 1979, up to 400 Rhodesian and South African military personnel attacked bridges and a major staging point for Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) insurgents in Gaza Province. The battle eventually drew in elements of the Mozambican army and police, who sustained heavy casualties. Along with Operation Miracle, this was one of the largest Rhodesian external operations of the war. Targets During the Rhodesian Bush War (or Second Chimurenga) the Rhodesian Security Forces (RSF) had to deal with an increasing flow of externally trained insurgents coming into Rhodesia, latterly Zimbabwe Rhodesia, from its neighbouring countries, especially from Zambia and Mozambique, the latter in particular after its independence in 1975. The objectives of Operation Uric were to attack the ZANLA forces in their command and training centre before they could enter Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and to cut off supply routes into the Gaza Province of Mozambique. It was also hoped that the destruction of communication and railway lines, roads and bridges as far as 200 miles into Mozambique would affect the economic situation and the morale of those who supported ZANLA and Robert Mugabe. Targets were the bridges at Aldeia Da Barragem along with a vital irrigation canal feeding a major agricultural area in Mozambique. Air strikes were planned on FRELIMO installations in Mapai and Maxaila to demoralise the occupants. Afterwards the base at Mapai would be taken and destroyed by Zimbabwe-Rhodesian ground forces. Attack Plaque honouring seventeen Rhodesian and South African servicemen killed during Uric. Prior to the attack, 200 Zimbabwe Rhodesian troops had been deployed into an area inside of Mozambique east-southeast of Chigubu. Helicopters were at Chipinda Pools airstrip within Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The attack only began on 5 September because of bad weather conditions. Rhodesian SAS troops were airlifted to Aldeia De Barragem and four other targets to destroy bridges and infrastructure. Hawker Hunter jets and Cessna Lynx aircraft bombed the area and provided air support. During evacuation of a wounded soldier one AB-205A helicopter was shot down by a RPG-7 with the technician, LAC AJC Wesson killed on impact. The pilot Flt Lt Dick Paxton was rescued by the SAS. On 6 September the army base at Mapai was bombarded by Hawker Hunters destroying the command centre and the main radar station. Afterwards the Zimbabwe-Rhodesian troops were transported by helicopter to attack positions near the base. During transport operations a South African Puma helicopter was hit by an RPG-7 at killing all 14 Zimbabwe-Rhodesian commandos and the three South African Air Force crew on board. This was the highest loss of life for the Rhodesian Security Forces in a single incident during the war. The crash site was later bombed in an attempt to cover the South African markings on the Puma helicopter. The Mapai base was fortified by interconnecting zig-zag trenches which provided good cover for the defenders. Heavy fighting took place between the Rhodesian Army and FPLM soldiers. Mapai was repeatedly bombarded by Hunter jets and Canberra bombers. Shortly before sundown the decision to withdraw was taken by the Supreme Commander of the Rhodesian Army General Walls. Aftermath The battle resulted in over 300 dead ZANLA and FRELIMO soldiers and a number of damaged bridges, buildings and infrastructure. Zimbabwe Rhodesian casualties were 17, which amounted to a disaster for the Rhodesian forces, despite a kill-ratio of over 20:1. It became obvious to the Rhodesian Security Forces that they would soon become technologically inferior to their enemies, who were well equipped and trained by their Soviet advisers, and who were now standing their ground through air attacks unlike earlier in the war. Zimbabwe Rhodesian soldiers were well trained and motivated, but international sanctions such as United Nations Security Council Resolution 232, and isolation had led to increased problems in replacing aircraft, arms and ammunition. Politically the operation led to Samora Machel putting pressure on Robert Mugabe to take part in the Lancaster House peace talks. Machel wanted to prevent Mozambique from being dragged further into the war with Zimbabwe Rhodesia, which had already seriously damaged its economy.

He joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force at the outbreak of the Second World War, becoming a flight instructor and test pilot before flying bombing missions over the Pacific during 1944 and 1945. He rose to the rank of squadron leader and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. After the war he became a commercial airline pilot for Tasman Airways (later Air New Zealand).University of Sydney website Bethwaite had four children with his wife Nel: Christine, Mark (an Olympic and World Championship competitor), Nicola (also an Olympic and World Championship competitor) and Julian (World Championship Competitor and boat designer). After settling in Sydney, Bethwaite designed a small boat suitable for his youngest children to use to learn how to sail. This became known as the Northbridge Junior (now known as the 9er). Bethwaite is most well known for designing the Tasar Sailing Networks and Laser 2 Dinghy Classes. He was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2000 for his services to sport.

Early life and education Curiel was born in East Chicago, Indiana, the youngest of four children. Their parents, Salvador and Francisca, had emigrated from Mascota, a small Mexican town near Puerto Vallarta in the state of Jalisco. Salvador worked as a laborer in Arizona before moving to Indiana where he worked in the steel mills. Curiel's parents married in 1946 and later became American citizens. Curiel graduated from high school at the Bishop Noll Institute. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Indiana University in 1976 and his Juris Doctor from the Indiana University School of Law in 1979 and is a member of the fraternity Kappa Alpha Psi.Wilford Shamlin III, Latino judge bashed by Trump is member of Kappa Alpha Psi, Philadelphia Tribune (June 10, 2016). Pre-judicial career Curiel worked in private practice, first at James, James & Manning from 1979 to 1986 and then at Barbosa & Vera from 1986 to 1989. He was an Assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of California from 1989 to 2002. While in the Southern District, he served as Deputy Chief (1996‚Äì1999) and then Chief (1999‚Äì2002) of the Narcotics Enforcement Division. During his tenure with the Narcotics Enforcement Division, Curiel handled a case involving two alleged members of the Arellano Felix cartel of Tijuana, Mexico. U.S. law enforcement arrested the two alleged murderers in California, based on information from Mexican authorities, and Curiel sought their extradition to Mexico.Preston, Julia and Pyes, Craig. \\"U.S.-Mexico Drug War: 2 Systems Collide\\", New York Times (July 23, 1997). The two men objected to extradition by arguing that the information used to track them down had been obtained in Mexico via torture. Curiel argued: \\"The [U.S.] Government is not here to deny there is a possibility of torture....There are serious allegations of torture. But the forum for those allegations to be aired is the Government of Mexico.\\" While still in United States custody, one of the men allegedly threatened Curiel's life, so that Curiel had to live under federal protection for a time. The extradition case went up to a federal appeals court, with Curiel arguing the case.Mainero v. Gregg, 164 F.3d 1199 (9th Cir. 1999). The appeals court decided that the extradition could proceed, saying that there was enough evidence to support it without using the evidence allegedly obtained via torture. Curiel hailed the ruling, which he said might lead to greater cooperation between the two countries in the fight against the drug cartel.Diedoardo, Chris. \\"9th Circuit Sends Alleged Assassins Back To Mexico\\", San Diego Daily Transcript (January 7, 1999). Curiel then worked as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Central District of California from 2002 to 2006. Judicial career =California Superior Court= In 2006, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger appointed Curiel to the San Diego County Superior Court. He held that position until his appointment to the federal bench. =Federal judicial service= On November 10, 2011, President Barack Obama nominated Curiel to serve as a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. He replaced Judge Thomas J. Whelan, who had taken senior status. Curiel was rated \\"well qualified\\" by a substantial majority of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which evaluates federal judicial nominees.Ratings of Article III Judicial Nominees: 112th Congress, American Bar Association Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Curiel received a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 28, 2012, which reported his nomination to the Senate on April 26, 2012, by voice vote. In the early hours of September 22, 2012, on what was officially still the legislative day of September 21, the Senate confirmed Curiel by voice vote. He received his commission on October 1, 2012. Trump University lawsuits In February 2014, Curiel certified Tarla Makaeff v. Trump University as a class action case that alleged Trump University was \\"a basically fraudulent endeavor\\", and he accepted residents of three states as members of that class. In October 2014, Curiel certified Cohen v. Trump as another national class action against then-entrepreneur Donald Trump. In March 2016, Curiel allowed Makaeff to withdraw her name from the first lawsuit, and the case was retitled Low v. Trump University. In May 2016, Curiel granted a request by the Washington Post for public release of certain Trump University documents and depositions that had been filed in the case. Curiel scheduled a trial to begin in the Low case on November 28, 2016, in San Diego. He had planned to start the trial in the summer of 2016, but postponed it until after the 2016 Presidential election because of concerns that jurors would be affected by a \\"media frenzy\\" if the trial took place before the election. In November 2016, after Trump had been elected president, his attorneys asked that the case be delayed until after Trump's inauguration, set for January 20, 2017. Curiel denied the request but urged the parties to pursue a settlement, and recruited District Judge Jeffrey T. Miller to facilitate settlement talks. On November 18 a $25 million settlement of all three pending cases (Curiel's two class-action suits plus a suit filed by the attorney general of New York) was announced and was certified by Curiel. Implementation of the settlement was delayed because one individual claimant wished to pursue a separate lawsuit. A district court and an appeals court rejected that individual's claim, and Curiel finalized the settlement in April 2018. Former students can now get a refund of up to 90% of the money they spent on courses. During the campaign Trump repeatedly criticized Curiel in campaign speeches and interviews, calling him a \\"hater of Donald Trump\\", saying his rulings have been unfair, and that Curiel \\"happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that's fine\\", while suggesting that the judge's ethnicity posed a conflict of interest in light of Trump's proposal to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. Curiel wrote in court papers that Trump has \\"placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue\\", but is forbidden from responding publicly to Trump's claims in view of rules against public commentary by judges on active cases. Legal experts were critical of Trump's original attacks on Curiel, viewing them as racially charged, unfounded, and an affront to the concept of an independent judiciary. On June 7, 2016 Trump issued a lengthy statement saying that his criticism of the judge had been \\"misconstrued\\" and that his concerns about Curiel's impartiality were not based upon ethnicity alone, but also upon rulings in the case.\\"Donald Trump‚Äôs Statement on Trump University\\", New York Times (June 7, 2016). This includes the full text of the Trump statement. In reply, Cato Institute fellow Nat Hentoff wrote that thus far in the case, Curiel had ruled in Trump's favor far more often than not, including granting his motion to delay the trial until after the 2016 presidential election, and concluded that \\"Donald Trump has an odd way of showing his appreciation for a trial judge who, as his attorney said, is just 'doing his job'.\\"Why Judge Curiel May Be Donald Trump‚Äôs Best Friend. Nat Hentoff, Cato Institute, 9 June 2016. In November 2017 at an appeals court hearing, one of Trump's attorneys said that Trump had changed his opinion of Curiel and now regarded his actions as a \\"textbook example of a district court properly administering a settlement.\\" DACA lawsuit In April 2017 Curiel was assigned to hear the case of a 23-year-old man whose lawyers say he was deported to Mexico on February 18 by the Border Patrol despite being registered under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, having arrived in the United States from Mexico when he was 9 years old. The Department of Homeland Security says he was not deported and must have gone into Mexico from the United States voluntarily at some point. He was caught on February 19 trying to illegally cross the border into the United States from Mexico. U.S.‚ÄìMexico border wall case Curiel also heard a case brought by the State of California and California Coastal Commission, a number of environmentalist groups, and U.S. Representative Ra√∫l Grijalva (Democrat of Arizona) that challenged waivers issued in 1996 and 2005 that allowed the federal government to bypass some federal and state environmental laws to promote border security. These waivers were granted under a 1996 immigration law. Three separate lawsuits were initially brought, challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's power to waive these laws to construct a border wall. Curiel consolidated these into a single case, In re Border Infrastructure Environmental Litigation.Kylee Clark, Federal judge dismisses challenge to Trump's border wall, Jurist (February 28, 2018).Order Denying Plaintiffs' Motions for Summary Judgment and Granting Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment, In re Border Infrastructure Environmental Litigation (S.D. Cal. Feb. 27, 2018). The plaintiffs argued that the waivers were ultra vires and not authorized by the 1996 immigration law; they also raised constitutional challenges grounded in the Nondelegation Doctrine, Take Care Clause, Presentment Clause, First Amendment and Tenth Amendment. On February 27, 2018, Curiel granted summary judgment in favor of the Trump administration. Memberships Curiel was admitted to the bar in Illinois in 1979, in Indiana in 1980, and in California in 1986. Curiel is a member of American Bar Association, and served on the ABA's Hispanic Advisory Committee of the Commission on Public Understanding about the Law from 1993 to 1998. He served on the State Bar of California's Criminal Law Advisory Commission from 1994 to 1998, spending one year as chair and another year as vice chair. He also served on the board of directors of the San Diego County Judges Association and was a member of the California Judges Association. He served on the San Diego Superior Court's Domestic Violence Committee from 2007 to 2010. He is a member of the American Inns of Court, William B. Enright Chapter. Curiel is a member of the San Diego La Raza Lawyers Association, a nonprofit professional association of Latino lawyers that is affiliated with a statewide organization, the La Raza Lawyers of California. Neither these groups nor Curiel are affiliated with the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), an unrelated advocacy group. On his 2011 questionnaire, Curiel also noted that he was a \\"life-time member\\" of the Hispanic National Bar Association, and a member of the National Hispanic Prosecutors Association, as well as the Latino Judges Association. Personal life Curiel is married. He and his wife, a court probation officer, have one daughter. He plays jazz guitar.

A state of emergency in the Italian regions of Liguria and Tuscany was declared after floods killed 10 people on 27 October, causing mudslides. In Ireland, a state of emergency was declared in Dublin three days before. The same low-pressure area also induced heavy rain and flooding in parts of North Africa. Ireland Thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed during sudden flash floods around the country. Dublin City Council declared a major emergency. Dundrum Town Centre in Dublin, one of Europe's biggest shopping centres, was evacuated shortly before 8 pm on 24 October 2011 after floodwaters surged through the doors, destroying most stores. The owner of a Mexican restaurant in the complex said five-feet of water had rushed down steps towards his business, causing thousands of euro worth of damage. Roads around County Dublin and County Wicklow remained shut the following day. Two deaths were reported in the country during October. Cecilia De Jesus, a 58-year-old Filipino care worker who had recently become an Irish citizen, drowned in her basement flat on Parnell Road, Harold's Cross, Dublin. She had only recently moved into the flat. Her body was discovered after emergency services pumped the water out. The other death was Ciaran Jones, a member of the Garda S√≠och√°na who was swept into the River Liffey at Ballysmuttan Bridge in Manor Kilbride, County Wicklow.

There was record rainfall at Casement Aerodrome. Italy The city of Genoa sustained flash floods that erupted when 356 millimetres of rain fell in six hours on 4 November. About six people died. The receding waters in that city revealed heaps of overturned cars, furniture and mud dispersed across the streets. Several people were reported missing in the city. According to Genoa mayor Marta Vicenzi, the floods constituted \\"a completely unexpected tragedy\\". Near Pozzuoli, a tree fell on a car, killing the driver. A bridge across the Pellice stream in the countryside collapsed due to rushing waters with no reported injuries. Flooding also occurred in Venice. The muddy water reached Cinque Terre, while the ports of Vernazza and Monterosso were swamped by hundreds of tonnes of debris and mud. The Serie A matches between Napoli and Juventus, as well as between Genoa and Inter Milan, were postponed. An investigation was opened in the country into whether floods were the fault of official negligence and illegal building.

Rasony District (, ) is a district in Vitebsk Region, Belarus. Nescherdo Lake, the seventh largest lake in Belarus, is situated in this district.  World War II  In the early days of the occupation, a powerful and increasingly well-coordinated Belarusian resistance movement emerged. Hiding in the woods and swamps, the partisans inflicted heavy damage to German supply lines and communications, disrupting railway tracks, bridges, telegraph wires, attacking supply depots, fuel dumps and transports and ambushing German soldiers. Not all anti-German partisans were pro-Soviet.Stru≈ºy≈Ñska, Anti-Soviet conspiracy‚Ä¶, pp859‚Äì860. To fight partisan activity, the Germans had to withdraw considerable forces behind their front line. The Operation Heinrich, a large-scale anti-partisan operation during the occupation, carried from October 3 to November 18, 1943 under code name \\"Heinrich\\" (after Heinrich Himmler), which was carried out under overall leadership of SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer und General der Polizei Erich von dem Bach- Zelewski commissioned by Himmler for anti-partisan struggle.

Ltd., London, 1983, p. 21-229 When the Waffen-SS units were numbered in October 22, 1943 the unit became the 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade. The former 1st grenadier regiment became the 42nd and the 2nd regiment became the 43rd. The other units of the brigade were marked with the number 53. In October the same year the 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade was sent with the railway-echelon to Army Group Nord command and was subjected to Nord's homefront security units' leader. In October 1943 the 3. SS Freiwilligen Brigade went from Riga to Belarus to participate in the Operation Heinrich. Its aim was to crush the Partisan Republic of Rasony in Po≈Çack- Krasnapollie-Pustoszka-Idrica-Siebie≈º area. Two battle groups were formed: Police battle group Jeckeln (after SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer Friedrich Jeckeln) and Police battle group von Gottberg (after SS- und Polizeif√ºhrer beim Generalkommissar f√ºr Wei√üruthenien Curt von Gottberg).http://www.ifz- muenchen.de/heftarchiv/2004_3.pdf The 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade was subjected to SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer und General der Polizei Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, the leader of the anti-partisan units. By October 1943 the front situation had become extremely dangerous for the nazi forces in Nevelsky District because of the Red Army's successful breakthroughs and also because of the Belarusian partisans' units in the forest behind the front. During the nazi attack the partisans were led by the Red Army officers left in the Rasony Raion forests and the leaders of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks). This formation of the partisans was called the Partisan Republic of Rasony. The 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade received an order to destroy this republic. The former 42nd Regiment's 1st Battalion leader, SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Harald Riipalu, gave an overview in his memoirs about the Partisan Republic of Rasony: \\"What happened was the following: the Germans had simply passed this area of land, which was hardly passable, during their attack of 1941, and they left the retreating Red Army units behind in good hope that the latters will die of hunger and come out. But the Russians kept living in the woods. The Germans' eastern politics brought more and more people from the surrounding counties and the more the Eastern Front moved towards West step by step, the partisans' army's military importance increased. The 'Republic' itself had received its name from the Rosson village, where the Red Army's headquarters had probably been. There were talks that the whole army's strength had increased to several thousands who were led by one Russian officer.The 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade\\" SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer Argo Loorp√§rg, the leader of the 42nd Regiment's 14th Anti- Tank Company's 2nd unit, recalls: \\"The company was unloaded from the train in Siebie≈º station. Two roads went to Idrica. The units had received a warning that the partisans had blown up all bridges on the eastern road. When SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer [Bernhard] Langhorst was looking for the road that they had to take from the map, he accidentally chose the wrong road. Unfortunately he didn't consult with us, his unit leaders. After a few-kilometer long hike, the company column was facing a bridge blown up by the partisans. Once SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer Langhorst realised his mistake, we could see he was upset. Any moment the column could have been attacked by the partisans on the highway wall. There was a thick forest next to the road. Langhorst called me to the beginning of the column and ordered me to take the Z√ºndapp motorcycle and drive to the village road that heads left from bridge and was supposedly connecting both roads heading towards Idrica. We needed to make sure this road was passable. For some reason the 1st unit leader, SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer [E.] Telk, who was standing right next to us, said he will drive there himself. After all, he was the deputy company leader. Mine and his messengers joined him on motorcycles. Telk was sitting in Z√ºndapp's sidecar. His messenger was driving in front of him and my messenger was behind him. They managed to drive about three hundred meters. Then we saw how the first motorcycle drove on a mine on the road and blew into pieces. Shortly after this the second mine exploded under Z√ºndapp's wheel. With his hands spread, Telk flew right to the field, Z√ºndapp and its driver flew left. My messenger, who was the last one, managed to make a U-turn and drove back. When we got there, it became evident that the first motorcyclist was killed immediately, Z√ºndapp driver's right leg was badly injured. Lieutenant Telk had no wounds. We carried him to the column. Telk gained consciousness, but was unable to speak. He was strongly shaken and probably had internal bleeding. We put both wounded men into the car and sent them back to Siebie≈º hospital. The next day we received an announcement that SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Telk died in the hospital because of internal bleeding. The Z√ºndapp driver survived. Telk and his messenger were the first killed men in the 42nd Regiment, and probably in the whole 3rd SS Brigade...\\" The Operation Heinrich stood out for the extermination of many large villages by the nazi units: Sosni, Mamolja, Lopatki, Zauswetje, Bakanicha, Perewoz, Zawszcza, Rudnja, Baranowo, Gorbaczewo, Kanaszonki, Weruselimka, Skarbuny, Weratino, Kowali, Lisna, Welikoje Selo, A≈õwieja, Malaszkowo, Zaluga, Borkowiczi, Widoki, Latygowo, Juzef√≥wo, Die≈ºy, Kobylniki... Descriptions of nazi cruelty, for instance cramming women and children into burning houses, spread rapidly among the civilian population.Christian Gerlach, Kalkulierte Morde. Die deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Wei√üru√üland 1941 bis 1944. Studienausgabe, pages 943 and following SS-Obersturmf√ºhrer Argo Loorp√§rg: \\"During the hike, which lasted about a week, the 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade passed roads that seemed endless, once flowing through the forest and then passing the swampy lands and went through the villages that were completely empty. In some houses, warm food was still on the table, but there was no one to eat it. The partisans knew of the attack against them and the villagers had escaped to partisan camps. In the attack in an area, which was inhabited by the partisans, the biggest threat to the SS Brigade was the land mines placed on the roads. When the partisans were afraid of armed meetings with the SS Brigade, they often mined the roads. Sometimes this was done very quickly, using the time in between the moving of the SS columns.\\"\\" By October 31, 1943 the police battle group Jeckeln was south of Siebie≈º-Idrica-Pustoszka railway line and battle-ready. The operation began on November 1. The battles with the partisans lasted for five days in the forests of Rasony. The 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade invaded the partisans' main point in Albrechtowo, which was a relatively large place considering the surroundings. SS-Unterscharf√ºhrer Leo Sipelgas continues his memories: \\"I can recall from the battles near Rasony that we conquered a relatively large partisans' camp. We lost five men, who were killed, but took twenty to prison and got ten horses, several carriages, a number of pigs and cows, few casks of vodka, mundungus, radio station, field hospital and printing house. We found thousands of copies of underground newspapers, German-Russian dictionaries and potato bags full of rubles from the printing house. During the battles a large number of partisans managed to hide in the surrounding forests, nevertheless, I had never seen so many dead bodies before. Some naked Russians were imprisoned while they were in sauna. We were in great mood - everyone wanted to keep storming on after the first victory. Young men like us believed that victory is waiting for us‚Ä¶\\" The SS Brigade was not able to stay in Albrechtowo for long because at the same time strong Soviet Union regular armies were breaking through the front quite near. They also mentioned the panic that had spread, even among the hardened Belarusian Auxiliary policemen. On November 6 an order came to move towards east near Lake Nieszczarda because the Red Army had broken through the front in Newel area, and stop the Operation Heinrich during which at least 5,452 people were murdered. The 3rd SS Volunteer Brigade's next assignment was to bar the breakthrough and fight their enemy, who this time was the Red Army's regular units, back to its initial positions on the Nieszczarda and Lake Mieszno's line. During the repositioning the 42nd Regiment's Commander, SS-Standartenf√ºhrer Henn-Ants Kurg, was badly injured - his car drove on a mine on Idrica-Siebie≈º highway. Kurg died a few days later. SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Paul Vent was appointed to his position. The 42nd Regiment's 1st Battalion leader, SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Harald Riipalu, recalls: \\"While we were on the edge of the forest in front of Albrechtowo, we suddenly received an order on one November evening: 'The enemy has broken through near Newel. The Brigade must stop chasing the partisans and has to break through until Lake Nieszczarda as quickly as possible!' This breakthrough can also be called a cut-through. The road from Albrechtowo until Gorbaczewo and Mieszno villages near Lake Nieszczarda, which was some ten kilometers long, was supposed to be cleared of the trees that were on the road. The Brigade had reached the front. It had reached the eastern border of 'Rasony Republic' and was facing the regular Red Army.\\" On 22 June 1944 the huge Soviet offensive Operation Bagration was launched, Minsk was re-captured on 3 July 1944, and all of Belarus was regained by the end of August. Hundred thousand of Poles were expelled after 1944. In total, Belarus lost a quarter of its pre-war population in World War II - mainly Poles and Jews - including practically all its intellectual elite. About 9 200 villages and 1.2 million houses were destroyed. The major towns of Minsk and Vitsebsk lost over 80% of their buildings and city infrastructure.

Arch Virol 154:909‚Äì918 The name is derived from Hytrosa, sigla from the Greek Hypertrophia for 'hypertrophy' and 'sialoadenitis' for 'salivary gland inflammation.' Description The viruses in this family are non occluded, enveloped, rod-shaped virions measuring 500‚Äì1,000 nanometers (nm) in length and 50‚Äì80 nm in diameter . The virions contain a thin, dense central nucleocapsid that encases the DNA-protein core. The nucleocapsid core is surrounded by an amorphous proteinaceous tegument layer. The outer surface of the virions is studded with helical polymeric structure composed of virally- encoded and host-derived protein dimers. The virions contain at least 35 polypeptides which range in size from 10 to 200 kiloDaltons. The genome is a supercoiled, circular double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule ranging in size from 120 to 190 kilobases with 108-174 putative non-overlapping genes that are equally distributed over the genome in unidirectional clusters. The G+C ratio varies between 28% and 44%. Species in this family cause overt salivary gland hypertrophy symptoms in dipteran adults. Infection and replication in non- salivary gland cells induce partial in tsetse flies and complete shutdown of vitellogenesis in the houseflies,. Replication occurs in the nucleus of secretory epithelial cells of the salivary gland. The viral DNA synthesis and transcription occurs within the nuclear replication complexes. Replication involved temporal expression of immediate early, early and late genes. The nucleocapsids exit the nucleus into the cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complex, after which they associate with the Golgi apparatus that culminates in cytoplasmic envelopment and virion assembly. Transmission is either horizontally (per os) through feeding or vertically (transovarially) from mother to offspring,. Mechanical transmission (trans-cuticular though wounds) has been suggested in the houseflies. Taxonomy and Classification Two species are known in this family,:name=\\"Hytrosaviridae Study Group\\"> The hytrosaviruses (SGHVs) infection the haematophagous tsetse fly and the filth- feeding housefly have been assigned into two genera within the Hytrosaviridae family: Glossinavirus. Represented by the type species Glossina pallidipes salivary gland hypertophy virus (GpSGHV),. Muscavirus. Represented by the type species Musca domestica salivary gland hypertophy virus (MdSGHV). One other species has tentatively been placed in this family: Merodon equestris hytrosavirus. Host Range *Glossina pallidipes. This is the natural host of Glossina pallidipes salivary gland hypertophy virus (GpSGHV), in which the virus predominantly causes chronic asymptomatic (covert) SGH infections. GpSGHV is highly specific to Glossina species. There is no available evidence for GpSGHV infections or replication in heterologous host species such as the housefly. The susceptibility of the tsetse fly to GpSGHV infections widel differ in different Glossina species, of which Glossina pallidipes is the most susceptible. Up to 15 different GpSGHV haplotypes with varying prevalence rates have been reported in the wild populations of tsetse flies in East, Central and West Africa,. *Musca domestica. The common housefly is the natural host of Musca domestica salivary gland hypertrophy virus (MdSGHV), in which the virus causes only acute symptomatic (overt) SGH infections,. Under laboratory setting, MdSGHV can infect other insects, including the obligate hemato phagous stable flies (Stomoxys calcitrans), the autumn housefly (Musca autumnalis), and the larvae predator of the housefly, the black dump fly (Hydrotaea aenescens). However, MdSGHV does not induce overt SGH symptoms in hosts other than the housefly, but it does significantly affect ovarian development and cause mortalities in some of the muscids such as the stable fly and dump fly. *Merodon equestris. The hytrosavirus infecting this phytophagous syrphid fly is yet to be characterized. Morphologically and symptomologically similar virus to SGHVs has been reported to cause SGH symptoms in the male accessory gland filaments of the solitary braconid wasp, Diachasmimorpha longicuadata Ashmed (Hymenoptera. Braconidae), which suggests existence of other Hytrosaviridae family members. Virology Prevalence of this virus is high (80%) in Glossina pallidipes. Within the housefly populations, MdSGHV induces variable rates of overt SGH symptoms (0-40%), which is related to the fly's seasonal densities at various sampling sites. Pathogenesis and Tissue Tropism Hytrosaviruses (SGHVs) induce similar gross pathology (SGH symptoms) in the salivary glands of their respective adult insect hosts, but the cytopathogies are distinct for the each of the two known genera (Glossinavirus and Muscavirus). Both pairs of the salivary gland tissue are equally affected (swollen up to four times their normal sizes) with the enlargement extending the entire lengths of the distal regions of the salivary glands. Infections of tissues other than the salivary glands is associated with various pathologies such as reproductive dysfunctions, infertility in females and distorted mating behaviors. = Pathogenesis in the Salivary Glands = GpSGHV causes salivary gland hyperplasia in the infected tsetse flies, i.e. only the cytoplasmic but not the nuclear compartment of the glands are enlarged. However, the hyperplastic salivary gland cells are capable of dividing. This pathology is thought to be due to the virus-induced reprogramming of the differentiated salivary gland cells. Overall, the induction of overt SGH symptoms is typically the exemption rather than the rule. It is only under some unknown conditions that the asymptomatic infection state is triggered to the symptomatic infection state. When GpSGHV is artificially inoculated (intrahemocoelic) into adult stages of the tsetse fly Glossina pallidipes, overt SGH symptoms develop in the F1 offsprings produced by the injected mothers, but not in the parental generation. MdSGHV induces salivary gland hypertrophy in the housefly, i.e. both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of the salivary gland tissue proliferate, but are incapable of dividing. When MdSGHV suspensions are artificially infected into adult houseflies, the virus induces overt SGH symptoms in 100% of the infected flies within three days post infection. Adult housefly develops increased resistance to MdSGHV infections with age, which is partially attributed to the development of the PM barrier in the fly's midguts. = Pathogenesis in non- Salivary Gland Tissues = Infections of non-salivary gland tissues in the tsetse flies by GpSGHV is associated with testicular degeneration, ovarian abnormalities, severe necrosis, degeneration of greminaria, and a reduction of the fly's development, survival and fecundity. Infections of the milk glands cause necrosis and depletion of the milk reservoir organelles. In the housefly, MdSGHV in non-salivary gland tissues blocks the production of sesquiterpenoids, which in turn induces complete shutdown of vitellogenesis. The ovaries of viremic housefly females become arrested at the pre- vitellogenic stages. MdSGHV induces behavioral alterations in infected females, which refuse to copulate with either healthy or viremic males. = Viral Latency = The asymptomatic GpSGHV infection state represents either a sub-lethal persistence or latency. Host's RNA interference (RNAi) machineries such as the small interfering RNA (siRNA) and micro RNA (miRNA) pathways have been implicated in keeping GpSGHV infections under control,. Similarities with other Virus Taxa Structurally, hytrosaviruses are similar to members of other arthropod-infecting virus families such as Baculoviridae, Nudiviridae and Nimaviridae. Hytrosaviruses share 12 of the 38 core genes that have been described in baculoviruses, nudiviruses, nimaviruses and some bracoviruses. Some of the structural and genomic features shared between hytrosaviruses and other large, dsDNA viruses include the possession of enveloped, rod-shaped virions, circular dsDNA genomes and replication in the nucleus of infected cells. However, hytrosaviruses differ functionally with baculoviruses by the lack of occlusion bodies and lower lethality. The viral DNA polymerase encoded is type B, which is present and conserved in all large dsDNA viruses. At the amino acid level, the best match of the DNA polB of hytrosaviruses is to the DNA polB found in the Alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus,.aka Alcelaphine herpesvirus, likely misspelled as Acephaline herpesvirus or Acelaphine herpesvirus Based on the DNA polB gene, hytrosaviruses relate more closely with invertebrate viruses with large linear dsDNA compared to viruse with circular dsDNA genomes. Some of the linear dsDNA viruses that cluster together with hytrosaviruses include members of families Herpesviridae (120-240 kp), Iridoviridae (140-303 bp), Poxviridae (130‚Äì375 kb), Phycodnaviridae (100‚Äì560 kb) and Mimiviridae (1200 kb). Hytrosaviruses encode homologs to the core and highly conserved oral infectivity factor (PIF) genes found in other dsDNA viruses (PIFs o/P74, 1,2 and 3), and occlusion-derived virus (ODV) envelop of epidopteran baculoviruses (OVD-E66). Also found in hytrosaviruses are homologs to some of the subunits of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DdRp) comlex found in baculoviruses and nudivuses. The DdRp complex components present in the hytrosaviruses include the late expression factors 4, 5, 8 and 9 (LEF-4, LEF-5, LEF-8 and LEF-9). Diagnosis and Management of Hytrosavirus Infections In mass rearing facilities, infections of tsetse flies by hytrosavirus causes reduction in colony productivity, which can cause collapse of the colonies. The virus is introduced into the mass rearing facilities from asymptomatic, field-collected materials, or material derived from already existing colonies, that are used to establish new or replenish existing colonies. The virus is then spread and maintained in the colonies through vertical transmission. Unknown factors (e.g. stress or genetic) can trigger expression of overt SGH symptoms, shich culminate in fly mortalities, reduced fecundity and eventual colony collapse. There are no obvious external clinical signs for hytrosavirus infections. The hytrosavirus infecting the tsetse flies can be diagnosed using a simple, sensitive and reliable non-destructive PCR- based assay, which allows the screening of the virus in individual live flies. Hytrosavirus infections in mass-reared tsetse flies can be effectively managed by an integrated approach involving a \\"clean feeding system\\" (CFS), which is based on strict sanitation, regular and routing monitoring of viral infections and the occurrence of overt SGH symptoms. The CFS can be combined with supplementation of bloodmeals with antiviral drugs such as valacyclovir, which are administered at low doses that are non-detrimental to the fly's DNA synthesis. When administered, the antiviral drug is converted into active metabolites by the virally-encoded thymidylate synthase. The active metabolites subsequently block viral replication resulting in the reduction of viral titers and shedding.

Paul-Jean-Louis Azan (Besan√ßon 1874 ‚Äì Lons-le-Saunier 1951) was a French general and author. He is remembered for his missions to the United States during World War I and his French historical and military writings which examined and celebrated French Colonial rule in North Africa. Colonial North Africa A graduate of the Saint-Cyr military academy, Paul Azan served in the 2nd r√©giment de zouaves in colonial Algeria along the Moroccan border, prior to its conquest by France. Later receiving a doctorate in literature, his thesis and first book Hannibal dans les Alpes brought him attention as a military historian and writer on colonial North Africa. In 1902 he was transferred to the Army's Historical Service. There he authored a number of works on the \\"Algeria Question\\", how France might best assimilate and pacify the colonized population of North Africa. His works argued against the \\"Assimilationist\\" French policy, arguing that North African Muslims could not become full French citizens.Josette Fournier (ed) Charles de Foucauld: amiti√©s crois√©es Editions Cheminements, 2007. pp.104-5Belkacem Recham. Les musulmans alg√©riens dans l'arm√©e fran√ßaise, 1919-1945. L'Harmattan, 1996 p.27 His most notable work on the subject was 1905's \\"Sidi-Brahim\\", on the Algerian leader during the period of early colonialism in the 1840s. After serving in the historical mission to Spain, now Captain Azan returned to North Africa, following interventions which culminated in the 1911 French conquest of Morocco, about which he authored several works, and serving under General Lyautey. He took part as an officer in the campaign against the Beni Snassen and the 1908 Fez Crisis expedition of General d‚ÄôAmade. World War I Prior to the First World War, Azan was assigned the French home garrison at Autun. At the outbreak of war, Azan was reassigned to the Army High Command (√©tat-major d‚Äôarm√©e), and then given command of company of infantry in the 20th Corps. Wounded first at Yser in Belgium, he was soon made chef de bataillon and was again wounded ‚Äî this time more seriously ‚Äî during the Artois offensive of May 1915. Following his recovery Azan was made a military instructor in the VIth Army under General Fayolle, the Mangin. Promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel, Azan was made Chief of the Information Mission to the United States in the spring of 1917. While there he received much attention as instructor of the Harvard University officers training unit. Translated to English, his The War of positions and The Warfare of to day received much acclaim in the United States.William Roscoe Thayer. Theodore Roosevelt and Intimate Biography.

Putnam's sons, 1919 Later career Following the 1918 Armistice, Azan was made chief of staff to General Franchet d‚ÄôEsperey in Constantinople and Thrace, then assigned again to General Nivelle's mission to the United States. Returning to North Africa, Colonel Azan commanded the 6th Regiment of the Tirailleurs Alg√©rien at Tlemcen. There he wrote his history of Lyautey's earlier expedition and a biography of Algerian resistance leader, Abd el-Kader. He also commanded troops in the suppression of the Abd el-Krim's revolt against French occupation in the Rif War. In the late 1920s, following an assignment teaching at the Centre des hautes √©tudes militaires in Paris, Azan was interim commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade at Tunis and commanded the suppression a series of anti-colonial riots.Seth Graebner.

AsG√©n√©ral de division he was head of military forces in French Tunisia from 1933 to 1936. Two months prior to the German occupation in the Second World War, the retired Azan was briefly named G√©n√©ral de corps d'arm√©e, and in 1944 was honored by the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise.

Formerly known as Nippa, it works to promote education and care services for young children. It provides support in the form of information and training to parents, childcare providers, employers and local authorities, as well as the development of programmes and projects to enhance the care and education provided for children. History Early Years was founded in 1965, when an inaugural meeting was held, attended by 25 people. The organisation was formed as NIPPA and established as part of PPA, the English Pre-School Playgroup Association. A year later, the first AGM and conference were held, offering members within the organisation the opportunity to meet and review the working year of the company in addition to participating in training activities. This event still continues on an annual basis. Early Years continued to grow and in the year 2007 the name NIPPA was changed to Early Years ‚Äì the organisation for young children to reflect the range of services being provided. Organisation Siobhan Fitzpatrick is the first, and current, Chief Executive Officer for Early Years, and has held this responsibility since 1989. The Deputy CEO is Pauline Walmsley. Early Years continue to promote high quality childcare and pre-school education for children in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and internationally. Current work Early Years offers a range of programmes and services for playgroup and daycare staff, parents and those working with children to promote care and education in addition to addressing issues of social exclusion and respect for differences. Two major projects introduced to promote a culture of respecting difference and inclusion in early years are the ‚ÄòMedia Initiative for Children - Respecting Difference Programme‚Äô and the Traveller 'Toybox' project. The 'Media Initiative' programme aims to tackle sectarianism, racism, physical discrimination, ethnicity and bullying whereas the 'Toybox' project challenges institutional racism and supports Traveller children and families to access early education. To ensure and measure the success of programmes and projects implemented, Early Years also launched the 'CORAL Initiative'. This programme provides evidence that the programmes developed and managed by the organisation such as the 'Eager and Able to Learn' programme, improve long term outcomes for young children. To extend and consolidate their international relationships, the 'International Network on Peace Building with young Children' was launched as a three-year project led by Early Years and supported by the International Centre for Education and Human Development in Colombia. The International Network project supports innovation in the field of peace building, enables sharing good practice and utilising these practices. The network also aims to develop an advocacy model in supporting the early childhood sector in conflict. The innovation in terms of providing services and developing projects continue to grow within the organisation with the launch of a new family health initiative for children within pre-school education in partnership with ‚ÄòCooperation And Working Together‚Äô this year.

For the film, he pioneered the concept of moving panes, of moving images, within the single context of the screen. At times there are 15 separate images moving at once. This technique, which he dubbed \\"multi-dynamic image technique\\"Konder, G. C., (2004) A Place to Grow (caption) Accessed January 28, 2007. has since been employed in many films, notably Norman Jewison's 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair. Mr. Jewison has credited Mr. Chapman as the creator of the edit style. The technique can also be seen more recently on television in the series 24. It is said that most of the editing decisions were worked out in an accountant's spreadsheet book and the pencil edit plan resembled flow charts. Chapman has remarked that at one point in the editing process he stood there in the room, bits of footage hanging from clips all around him. He felt crushed by the force of his vision and he was a breath away from quitting. Even at the first screening, Chapman was exhausted and unsure but as he left the room, Steve McQueen watching at the back, grabbed Chapman and told him that he was blown away by the film.Leslie Scrivener, \\"Forty years on, a song retains its standing\\", Toronto Star April 22, 2007.

Alto and soprano saxophones very soon became his main solo instruments. Danovitch learned to read music in any key, transposing it using the clefs system. His sight reading was outstanding making him a very demanded musician on the Montreal scene, and counting his ability to double fluently on several woodwind instruments, including clarinet, flute, and piccolo he soon became a part of many musical productions in Montreal, Toronto, Ottawa, and other cities.  Career  McGill University professor since 1964, Danovitch was chair of the woodwind area, and in 1968 initiated jazz studies program at the university.A Jazz Hothouse ‚Äî McGill News, Montreal, Spring 2003.

The notes originally depicted Queen Elizabeth II; since 1992 they have depicted Sir Edmund Hillary. Design =First issue (1967‚Äì1982)= The first $5 notes were issued alongside the first $1, $2, $10, $20, and $100 notes with the introduction of the New Zealand dollar 10 July 1967. Unlike the other notes issued, the $5 note did not have an equivalent pound bank note predecessor, having been equal in worth to ¬£2 and 10 shillings. On the front of the notes Queen Elizabeth II is pictured. There is a watermark of Captain James Cook. On the back of the note is a tui, which is a bird that eats nectar. The plant the bird is perched on is a kowhai, which is a tree with honey blossoms. =Second issue (1982‚Äì1990)= The colours and Elizabeth II's portrait were the only major changes. =Third issue (1993‚Äì1999)= The old notes were completely overhauled and have the same portraits and design as the fourth issue. There is a metallic strip, and a latent image was added as well; these do not appear on the newer notes. This note is different from the fourth series because it was issued in cotton, not polymer. =Fourth issue (1999‚Äì2015)= The Reserve Bank of New Zealand issued a plastic note intended to last four times longer than the former cotton paper paper banknote. The Bank stated that plastic notes are non-porous, meaning that they will not absorb liquids and therefore remain much cleaner. The notes had better security features than the cotton-based ones, with the aim of better deterring counterfeiting. The design of the note did not change markedly from its paper predecessor. The explorer Sir Edmund Hillary was depicted on the front, with Aoraki / Mount Cook, the tallest mountain in New Zealand , shown on the left hand side. Hillary was one of the first two individuals known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest, and the first to have been to the South Pole, the North Pole and the summit of Everest. One of the Ferguson tractors driven by Hillary to the pole could be seen in the lower left corner, next to the transparent window. Hillary is the only New Zealander to appear on a banknote during his lifetime excluding Queen Elizabeth II, in defiance of the established convention that, apart from the current head of state, only people who have died are depicted. On the reverse of the bill featured a scene from Campbell Island which is south of Stewart Island / Rakiura. The penguin shown on the note is the hoiho (yellow-eyed penguin), which is native to New Zealand. Bulbinella rossii, commonly known as the Ross lily, with yellow flower heads, was also featured. =Series 7= New $5 and $10 banknotes were released in October 2015 as part of the Series 7 banknote release. The remaining three banknote denominations ($20, $50, $100) in Series 7 were released in May 2016. Security features The polymer note has a watermark of Elizabeth II on the right side. There are two transparent windows with images of a fern, on the left, and on the right. When held up to the light the window will show a \\"5\\" in its center, and images of ferns printed on each side will line up perfectly. When the note is put under UV Light a yellow patch should appear with the number \\"5\\" through the use of fluorescent dyes.

Career Godfrey was assistant dance director at Warner Brothers Studio for ten years. She was under contract to Columbia Studios for two years and was the choreographer for The Ten Commandments at Paramount Pictures. Godfrey taught such stars as Jimmy Cagney, Gene Nelson, Jane Powell, Ann Sothern and Lucille Ball. Godfrey first joined Columbia Pictures as a member of The Jack Cole Dancers, along with supporting actresses Nita Bieber and Gloria Patrice. All three would appear in her 1946 debut film with the Stooges, Rhythm and Weep. Godfrey was the daughter-in-law of Columbia Pictures short subject head Jules White. Godfrey appeared in several more Three Stooges films throughout the 1950s, such as Shot in the Frontier, Musty Musketeers and Pardon My Backfire. Memorably, Godfrey became the only actress in the history of the slapstick comedy trio to deliver a triple slap‚Äîtwice‚Äîto the Stooges in 1957's A Merry Mix Up. Though she made less than 10 films with the comedy team, Godfrey is one of the few actresses to have worked with five of the six Stooges (Shemp Howard, Moe Howard, Larry Fine, Curly Howard and Joe Besser) on film in the various incarnations of the group. Godfrey retired from film shortly after production of Stooge shorts films ceased in December 1957. Death Godfrey died of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Northridge section of Los Angeles, California on January 7, 1985.

In analogy to the market concept which can be viewed from a macroeconomic (describing relationships among actors in an economic systems, e.g. a monopoly) as well as from a microeconomic (describing different allocation mechanisms, e.g. public auctions of telephone frequencies) perspective, electronic markets denote networked forms of business with many possible configurations: First, the topology of electronic markets may be centralized or decentralized in nature. Centralized electronic markets are hubs which often provide services to their participants. Decentralized settings involve sequential relationships within value chains which often are found when electronic messages are exchanged directly between businesses (electronic data interchange, EDI). Second, the services provided by electronic markets may serve infrastructural or allocation purposes. Among the infrastructure services are routing, messaging, identification and partner directories whereas allocation services enable pricing process which in turn may be static or dynamic in nature. Typical implementations are catalogs, exchanges and auctions. Third, the relationships of actors involved in electronic markets may be stable or atomistic in nature. The former usually refers to classical supply chains where business collaborate during a longer period of time. In the latter case, the transaction partners are only stable for a single transaction. This is usually to be found in auction and other exchange settings. This leads to two definitions: In a narrow sense Electronic Markets are mainly conceived as allocation platforms with dynamic price discovery mechanisms involving atomistic relationships. Popular examples originate from the financial and energy industries. In a broader sense, price discovery is not critical for electronic markets. This covers all forms of electronic collaboration between organizations and consumer as well as vice versa. Examples * company websites that serve communication and transaction purposes * electronic purchasing systems on EDI-basis as well as based on catalogs * systems that support the configuration of products, such as car configurators * automated download of product information based on the scan of an article number * activation of an emergency chain based on the monitoring of heart frequency * social networks that link consumers, such as recommendation communities Impacts on business efficiencies Electronic markets are attributed important impacts on business efficiencies. From an industry perspective, transaction cost economics were used to illustrate the relationship between electronic markets and electronic hierarchies. While the former are in line with the narrow electronic markets definition, the latter are also included in the broader definition. This may be explained since in reality electronic markets have emerged as platforms which combine several modes of governance or types of coordination mechanisms. These ‚Äúall-in-one-markets‚Äù link the possibility of competitive bidding for price discovery with the advantages of a predictable relationship to encourage relationship specific investments (non-contractible issues) and functionalities for closer collaboration. This perspective shows that it is important to distinguish between the market platform itself which creates an infrastructure between multiple parties and the coordination mechanisms operated on this platform which might be market- like or hierarchical in nature.

It is a breed based around the coloration and markings, rather than fur and body type. The ideal weight of a standard Harlequin is 6.5-8 lb (2‚Äì3 kg) Description The traditional Harlequin is part black or some other colour (no silvering) and part white or orange (the brighter the better). It should have an even mix of both colours and ideally have a half-and-half colouration on the head. Their colouration (not the name of the breed) may also be called magpie where the second colour is white rather than orange. The recognized colour patterns are (mixed with orange): *Black *Blue *Chocolate (brown) *Lilac The magpie variants are, naturally: *Black *Blue *Chocolate (brown) *Lilac It is recognized by both the British Rabbit Council and American Rabbit Breeders' Association. The Harlequin rabbit is playful, docile, and intelligent. Like most breeds the rabbit can respond to its own name and even be litter box trained. They are gentle, but like all other rabbits, are high maintenance. Rabbits are exotic and require consistent care by responsible and financially capable individuals. Harlequin rabbits come in two types: Japanese and Magpie. Japanese Harlequins are generally orange and either black, blue, chocolate, or lilac, while Magpie Harlequins are white (instead of orange) and either black, blue, chocolate, or lilac. A \\"perfect\\" Harlequin will be split between the two colors on the head, ears, feet, and body. It kind of looks like a perfect stripe between the two colors. Some Harlequins will have orange or white bellies. The current American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) Standard of Perfection calls for a 3 part frontal alternation. The ears are two different colors. The face splits into two colors, which alternate with the ears. The chest and front legs split into two colors, which alternate with the face and match the ears. The hind feet should alternate with the front feet. The body markings are either bars, bands, or a combination of the two. The animal may be disqualified if it doesn't have certain markings on its face etc. Some experts say that \\"Harlequin\\" is not a breed of rabbit, but just a color type. Others argue that it is a breed of rabbit with that color scheme. This is debatable. The Harlequin markings do occur in other breeds, but the ARBA does not recognize it as showable in other breeds besides the Harlequin breed. It was developed from semi-wild Tortoiseshell Dutch rabbits. Originally it looked like a badly marked Dutch rabbit. The Harlequin was first exhibited in Paris in 1887. They were then imported into England a few years later. Harlequins were used for meat during World War 2. Harlequins are nicknamed the clown of the rabbits and the royal jester because of the color separations and markings. The average life span for the Harlequin rabbit is 5 years or more. The bucks usually weigh 6.5 to 9 pounds and the does weigh 7 to 9.5 pounds.

It was the decades-long conflict between the emergent Qing dynasty (Ê∏ÖÊúù), the incumbent Ming dynasty (ÊòéÊúù), and several smaller factions in China (like the Shun dynasty È°∫Êúù and Xi dynasty Ë•øÊúù). It ended with the rise of the Qing, the fall of the Ming and other factions, and the unification of Outer Manchuria, Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and Taiwan under the Qing Empire.  Overview  The transition from the Ming to Qing was a decades-long period of conflict between: # Qing dynasty, established by Manchu clan Aisin Gioro in contemporary Northeast China; # the Ming dynasty, the incumbent dynasty led by the Zhu Family; # and various other rebel powers in China, such as the short-lived Xi Dynasty led by Zhang Xianzhong and the short-lived Shun dynasty led by Li Zicheng. Leading up to the Qing, in 1618, Aisin Gioro leader Nurhaci commissioned a document entitled the Seven Grievances, which enumerated grievances against the Ming and began to rebel against their domination in Northeast Asia (including Manchuria). Many of the grievances dealt with conflicts against the Ming-backed Yehe clan of the Jurchens. Nurhaci's demand that the Ming pay tribute to him to redress the seven grievances was effectively a declaration of war, as the Ming were not willing to pay money to a former tributary. Shortly afterwards, Nurhaci began to rebel against the Ming in Liaoning. At the same time, the Ming dynasty was fighting for its survival against fiscal turmoil and peasant rebellions. Han Chinese officials urged Nurhaci's successor Hong Taiji to crown himself Emperor of China, which he did in 1636, declaring the new Qing dynasty. On April 24, 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng, a former minor Ming official who became the leader of the peasant revolt, who then proclaimed the Shun dynasty. The last Ming emperor, the Chongzhen Emperor, hanged himself from a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City. When Li Zicheng moved against him, the Ming general Wu Sangui shifted his allegiance to the Qing. Li Zicheng was defeated at the Battle of Shanhai Pass by the joint forces of Wu Sangui and Manchu prince Dorgon. On June 6, the mainly Han Chinese forces of Dorgon and Wu entered the capital. However, the victory was far from complete as it required almost 40 more years before all of China was securely united under Qing rule. In 1661, the Kangxi Emperor ascended the throne, and in 1662 his regents launched the Great Clearance to defeat the resistance of Ming loyalists in South China. He then fought off several rebellions, such as the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui in southern China, starting in 1673, and then countered by launching a series of campaigns that expanded his empire. In 1662, Zheng Chenggong (Koxinga) drove out and defeated the Dutch and founded the Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan, a Ming loyalist state with a goal of reunifying China. However, Tungning was defeated in 1683 at the Battle of Penghu by Han admiral Shi Lang, a former admiral under Koxinga. The fall of the Ming dynasty was largely caused by a combination of factors. Scholars have argued that the fall of the Ming dynasty may have been partially caused by the droughts and famines caused by the Little Ice Age. Kenneth Swope argues that one key factor was deteriorating relations between Ming Royalty and the Ming Empire's military leadership.Kenneth M. Swope, The Military Collapse of China's Ming Dynasty, 1618‚Äì44 (Routledge: 2014) Other factors include repeated military expeditions to the North, inflationary pressures caused by spending too much from the imperial treasury, natural disasters and epidemics of disease. Contributing further to the chaos was a peasant rebellions throughout the country in 1644 and a series of weak emperors. Ming power would hold out in what is now southern China for years, though eventually would be overtaken by the Qing forces.Lillian M. Li, Alison Dray-Novey and Haili Kong, Beijing: From Imperial Capital to Olympic City (MacMillan, 2008) p. 35 The Qing victory was overwhelmingly the result of the defection of the Ming dynasty's Liaodong military establishment and other defectors, with the Manchu military playing a very minor role (see below for specific examples).Naquin 1987, p. 141.Fairbank, Goldman 2006, p. 2006.Spencer 1990, p. 41.Di Cosmo 2007, p. 9.  Rise of the Jurchens  The Manchus are sometimes described as a nomadic people,Pamela Crossley, The Manchus, p. 3 when in fact they were not nomads,Patricia Buckley Ebrey et al., East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, 3rd edition, p. 271 but a sedentary agricultural people who lived in fixed villages, farmed crops, practiced hunting and mounted archery. Their main military formation was infantry wielding bows and arrows, swords, and pikes while cavalry was kept in the rear. The Jianzhou Jurchen chief, Nurhaci, is retrospectively identified as the founder of the Qing dynasty. In 1589 the Ming dynasty appointed Nurhaci as Paramount chieftain of the Yalu Region, believing that his tribe was too weak to gain hegemony over the larger Yehe and Hada. When the other tribes attacked him to check his power in 1591, he succeeded in defeating them and seize much of their warhorses. In 1607 he declared himself Khan. Upon the advice of an Erdeni, most likely a Chinese transfrontiersman, he proclaimed the Jin State, named after the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty that had ruled over north China several centuries earlier. His unifying efforts gave the Jurchen the strength to assert themselves backed by an army consisting of majority Han defectors as well as Ming produced firearms. In 1618 he proclaimed Seven Grievances against the Ming. By summer 1621, the Ming's Liaodong fortress cities, Fushun, Shenyang, and Liaoyang, were all handed over to the Later Jin by traitors and defectors. The Ming General Li Yongfang who surrendered the city of Fushun in what is now Liaoning province in China's northeast did so after Nurhaci gave him an Aisin Gioro princess in marriage and a noble title. The Princess was one of Nurhaci's granddaughters. Shenyang was made into the capital of their newly founded dynasty. The Hulun tribes, a powerful confederacy of Jurchen tribes, started recognizing the authority of Nurhaci by the beginning of the 17th century. In some cases, such as with Bujantai of the Ula, chieftains would attempt to reassert their independence and war would break out, but the Jianzhou Jurchens would defeat and assimilate all the tribes eventually (Hada 1601, Hoifa 1607, Ula 1613, Yehe 1619). The powerful Yehe Jurchens under Gintaisi united with the forces of the Ming dynasty to combat the rise of Nurhaci but Gintaisi was defeated and died in 1619. The fur-trapping Warka peoples near the Pacific coast were subjugated as tributary tribes from 1599 to 1641. When the Jurchens were reorganized by Nurhaci into the Eight Banners, many Manchu clans were artificially created from groups of unrelated people who would found a new Manchu clan (mukun) using a term of geographic origin such as a toponym for their hala (clan name). The irregularities over Jurchen and Manchu clan origin led to the Qing trying to document and systemize the creation of histories for Manchu clans, including manufacturing an entire legend around the origin of the Aisin Gioro clan by taking mythology from the northeast. Nurhaci read the Chinese novels Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin, learning all he knew about Chinese military and political strategies from them.  Situation of the late Ming dynasty  Aisin Goro Clan and Jurchens. The Manchus and Qing dynasty started from northeast China and spread throughout the rest of China. Battle of Ningyuan between Ming and Manchus Battle of Ningyuan, where Nurhaci was injured in defeat In the late Ming dynasty, Ming army units had become dominated by officers who would spend long periods of ten or 12 years in command instead of the usual practice of constant rotation, and the Central Military Command had lost much of its control over regional armies. Zongdu Junwu, or Supreme Commanders, were appointed throughout the empire to oversee the fiscal and military affairs in the area of his jurisdiction. In the frontier areas these became increasingly autonomous, and especially in Liaodong, where military service and command became hereditary and vassalage- like personal bonds of loyalty grew between officers, their subordinates and troops. This military caste gravitated toward the Jurchen tribal chieftains rather than the bureaucrats of the capital. The She-An Rebellion among the Yi people broke out in Sichuan in 1621 against the Ming requiring suppression, which was completed in 1629. The Wuqiao mutiny was a rebellion that broke out in 1631, led by Kong Youde and Geng Zhongming. Undersupplied and underpaid soldiers mutinied against the Ming dynasty. They subsequently sailed across Bohai Gulf and defected to the Jurchens en masse. In the early 1640s, mass rebellions led by a variety of rebel leaders broke out in northwestern China's provinces of Shaanxi and spread throughout China in the 1640s. Major battles included the sacking of Fengyang by Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong and the battle of Kaifeng which led to the deliberately engineered 1642 Yellow River flood by the Ming governor in an attempt to stop Li Zicheng.  Initial Jurchen conquests  =Qing conquest of Liaoning (1618-1626)= After the Jurchen unification, the Jurchen Khan Nurhaci began to set his eyes on China. In 1618, he commissioned a document entitled the Seven Grievances in which he enumerated seven problems with Ming rule and began to rebel against the domination of the Ming dynasty. A majority of the grievances dealt with conflicts against Yehe, and Ming favouritism of Yehe. In May 1618, Nurhaci proclaimed his Seven Grievances against the Ming and departed his capital of Hetu Ala with 20,000 men. The army attacked and captured Fushun, located on the Hun River about 10 kilometers east of Shenyang. By May 1621, Nurhaci had conquered the cities of Liaoyang and Shenyang. In 1625, the Jurchens captured the port city of L√ºshun, thus controlling the whole Liaodong peninsula. In April 1625, Nurhaci designated Shenyang the new capital city, which would hold that status until the Qing conquest of the Ming in 1644.Arthur W. Hummel, Eminent Chinese of the Ch‚Äôing Period, (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1943), p. 597 In February 1626, the Jurchens besieged Ningyuan but suffered a defeat in which Nurhaci was mortally wounded. =First Joseon campaign= The Later Jin had lost at the Battle of Ningyuan the previous year and their khan Nurhaci died from his wounds afterwards. Peace negotiations with the Ming after the battle delayed an aggressive Ming response to the Jurchen loss, and the Ming general Yuan Chonghuan was busy fortifying the border garrisons and training new musketeers. The new Khan Hong Taiji was eager for a quick victory to consolidate his position as khan. By invading Joseon he also hoped to extract much-needed resources for his army and subjects, who had suffered in the war against Ming. In 1627, Hong Taiji dispatched Amin, Jirgalang, Ajige and Yoto to Joseon with 30,000 troops under the guidance of Gang Hong-rip and Li Yongfang. The Jurchens met sharp resistance at the border towns but Joseon border garrisons were quickly defeated. The Jurchen army advanced into Uiju where Mao Wenlong was stationed, and Mao quickly fled with his men into the Bohai Sea. Next, the Jurchens attacked Anju. When it became clear that defeat was inevitable, the Anju garrisons committed suicide by blowing up their gunpowder storehouse. Pyongyang fell without a fight and the Jin army crossed the Taedong River. By this time news of the invasion had reached the Ming court, which immediately dispatched a relief contingent to Joseon, slowing the Jurchen advance into Hwangju. King Injo then dispatched an envoy to negotiate a peace treaty, but by the time the messenger returned, Injo had already fled from Hanseong (Seoul) to Ganghwa Island in panic. =Mongolia campaign (1625-1635)= The Khorchin Mongols allied with Nurhaci and the Jurchens in 1626, submitting to his rule for protection against the Khalkha Mongols and Chahar Mongols. Seven Khorchin nobles died at the hands of Khalkha and Chahars in 1625. This started the Khorchin alliance with the Qing. The Chahar Mongols were fought against by Dorgon in 1628 and 1635. An expedition against the Chahar Mongols in 1632 was ordered to establish a trading post at Zhangjiakou. The Qing defeated the armies of the Mongol Khan Ligdan Khan, who was allied to the Ming, bringing an end to his rule over the Northern Yuan. The defeat of Ligdan Khan in 1634, in addition to winning the allegiance of the Southern Mongol hordes, brought a vast supply of horses to the Qing, while denying the same supply to the Ming. The Qing also captured the Great Seal of the Mongol Khans, giving them the opportunity to portray themselves as heirs of the Yuan dynasty as well. Hong Taiji and formation of the Qing dynasty Hong Taiji was the eighth son of Nurhaci, whom he succeeded as the second ruler of the Later Jin dynasty in 1626. He organised imperial examinations to recruit scholar-officials from the Han Chinese, and adopted Chinese legal forms. He formed autonomous Han Chinese military colonies governed by Han Chinese officials, where Manchus were forbidden to trespass. Hong Taiji curtailed the power of the Manchu princes by relying on Han Chinese officials. He personally welcomed surrendered Ming commanders, eating side-by-side with them so as to build a rapport that was impossible with the Ming Emperors. The Manchus, led by Prince Amin, expressed their displeasure at the situation by massacring the population of Qian'an and Yongping. Hong Taiji responded by arresting and imprisoning Amin, who later died in prison. Hong Taiji then implemented, on the urging of his Han Chinese advisors, Chinese-style Confucian education, and Ming-style government ministries. When Zhang Chun, a Ming commander, was captured but refused to defect, Hong Taiji personally served him with food to show his sincerity (Zhang still refused but was kept in a temple until his death). With the surrender of Dalinghe in 1631, the most capable army officers of the Ming became faithful followers of the new dynasty who would take over the preparation and planning of much of the war. From this episode onward, the Ming-Qing transition ceased to be an inter-nation conflict between Chinese and Manchus but rather a civil war between Liaodong and Beijing. Hong Taiji was reluctant to become Emperor of China. However, Han Chinese officials Ning Wanwo, Fan Wencheng, Ma Guozhu, Zu Kefa, Shen Peirui, and Zhang Wenheng urged him to declare himself as Emperor of China. On May 14, 1636, he accepted this advice, changing the name of his regime from the Later Jin (ÂêéÈáë) to the Qing dynasty (Ê∏ÖÊúù), and enthroning himself as Emperor of China in an elaborate Confucian ceremony. Hong Taiji's renaming of the Jurchens to Manchus was meant to hide the fact that the ancestors of the Manchus, the Jianzhou Jurchens, were ruled by the Han Chinese. The Qing dynasty carefully hid the two original editions of the books of \\"Qing Taizu Wu Huangdi Shilu\\" (Ê∏ÖÂ§™Á•ñÊó†ÁöáÂ∏ùÂÆûÂΩï) and the \\"Manzhou Shilu Tu\\" (Taizu Shilu Tu Â§™Á•ñÂÆûÂΩïÂõæ) in the Qing palace, forbidding them from public view, because they showed that the Manchu Aisin Gioro family had been ruled by the Ming dynasty. In the Ming period, the Koreans of Joseon referred to the Jurchen-inhabited lands north of the Korean peninsula, above the rivers Yalu and Tumen, to be part of Ming China, as the \\"superior country\\" (sangguk), the name they used to refer to Ming China. The Qing deliberately excluded references and information that showed the Jurchens (Manchus) as subservient to the Ming dynasty, from the History of Ming to hide their former subservient relationship to the Ming. The Veritable Records of Ming were not used to source the History of Ming because of this. Refusing to mention in the Mingshi (ÊòéÂè≤) that the Qing founders were Ming China's subjects was meant to avoid the accusation of rebellion. =Han-Manchu marriages= Han Chinese Generals who defected to the Manchu were often given women from the Imperial Aisin Gioro family in marriage. Manchu Aisin Gioro princesses were also married to Han Chinese official's sons. The Manchu leader Nurhaci married one of his granddaughters to the Ming General Li Yongfang after he surrendered Fushun in Liaoning to the Manchu in 1618. Nurhaci's son Abatai's daughter was married to Li Yongfang. The offspring of Li received the \\"Third Class Baron\\" () title. Li Yongfang was the great great great grandfather of Li Shiyao (Êùé‰æçÂ†Ø).http://www.dartmouth.edu/~qing/WEB/LI_SHIH-YAO.html The 4th daughter of Kangxi (ÂíåÁ°ïÊÇ´ÈùñÂÖ¨‰∏ª) was wedded to Sun Cheng'en (Â≠´ÊâøÊÅ©), son of the Han Chinese Sun Sike (Â≠´ÊÄùÂÖã). Other Aisin Gioro women married the sons of the Han Chinese generals Geng Jimao, Shang Kexi, and Wu Sangui. Meanwhile the ordinary soldiers who defected were often given non-royal Manchu women as wives, and a mass marriage of Han Chinese officers and officials to Manchu women numbering 1,000 couples was arranged by Prince Yoto Â≤≥Êâò (Prince Keqin) and Hongtaiji in 1632 to promote harmony between the two ethnic groups. This policy, which began before the invasion of 1644, was continued after it. A 1648 decree from Shunzhi allowed Han Chinese civilian men to marry Manchu women from the Banners with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners, it was only later in the dynasty that these policies allowing intermarriage were done away with. The decree was formulated by Dorgon. In the beginning of the Qing dynasty the Qing government supported Han Chinese defectors weddings to Manchu girls. Han Chinese Bannermen wedded Manchus and there was no law against this. The \\"Dolo efu\\" ÂíåÁ¢©È°çÈßô rank was given to husbands of Qing princesses. Geng Zhongming, a Han bannerman, was awarded the title of Prince Jingnan, and his son Geng Jingmao managed to have both his sons Geng Jingzhong and Geng Zhaozhong (ËÄøÊò≠Âø†) become court attendants under the Shunzhi Emperor and married Aisin Gioro women, with Prince Abatai's granddaughter marrying Geng Zhaozhong ËÄøÊò≠Âø† and Haoge's (a son of Hong Taiji) daughter marrying Geng Jingzhong. A daughter ÂíåÁ°ïÊüîÂòâÂÖ¨‰∏ª of the Manchu Aisin Gioro Prince Yolo Â≤≥Ê®Ç (Prince An) was wedded to Geng Juzhong ËÄøËÅöÂø† who was another son of Geng Jingmao. Aisin Gioro women were offered to Mongols who defected to the Manchus.Rawski 1998, pp. 66‚Äì67. The Manchu Prince Regent Dorgon gave a Manchu woman as a wife to the Han Chinese official Feng Quan, who had defected from the Ming to the Qing. Feng Quan willingly adopted the Manchu queue hairstyle before it was enforced on the Han population and Feng learned the Manchu language. =Building a mixed military= Manchus were living in cities with walls surrounded by villages and adopting Han-style agriculture well before the Qing conquest of the Ming, and there was an established tradition of Han-Manchu mixing before 1644. The Han Chinese soldiers on the Liaodong frontier often mixed with non-Han tribesmen and were largely acculturated to their ways. The Jurchen Manchus accepted and assimilated Han soldiers who went over to them, and Han Chinese soldiers from Liaodong often adopted and used Manchu names. Indeed Nurhaci's secretary Dahai may have been one such individual. When Li Yongfang surrendered, he was given much higher status than under the Ming, and even allowed to keep his troops as retainers. Kong Youde, Shang Kexi and Geng Zhongming were also allowed to keep their personal armies. The warlord Shen Zhixiang, who had unlawfully taken over command of his deceased uncle Shen Shikui's troops as his private army, was unable to attain recognition from the Ming court. He then proceeded to lead his forces to switch allegiance to the Qing, and they became critical assets to the Qing. There were too few ethnic Manchus to rule China, but they absorbed defeated Mongols, and, more importantly, added Han to the Eight Banners. The Manchus had to create an entire \\"Jiu Han jun\\" (ÊóßÊº¢Ëªç Old Han Army) due to the very large number of Han Chinese soldiers absorbed into the Eight Banners by both capture and defection. The Qing showed that the Manchus valued military skills in propaganda targeted towards the Ming military to get them to defect to the Qing, since the Ming civilian political system discriminated against the military.Di Cosmo 2007, p. 6. From 1618‚Äì1631 Manchus received Han Chinese defectors and their descendants became Han Bannermen and those killed in battle were commemorated as martyrs in biographies. Hong Taiji recognized that Ming defectors were needed in order to defeat the Ming, explaining to other Manchus why he needed to treat the Ming defector General Hong Chengchou leniently. Hong Taiji understood that the Ming would not be easily defeated unless Han Chinese troops wielding musket and cannon were included in the army. Indeed, among the Banners, gunpowder weapons like muskets and artillery were specifically used by the Han Chinese Banners.Di Cosmo 2007, p. 23. The Manchus established an artillery corps made out of Han Chinese soldiers in 1641. The use of artillery by Han Bannermen may have led to them being known as \\"heavy\\" soldiers (ujen cooha). The \\"red coat cannon\\" were part of the Han army (Liaodong Han Chinese) serving the Qing. Ming officers who defected to the Qing were allowed to retain their previous military rank. The Qing received the defection of Shen Zhixiang in 1638. Among the other Han officers who defected to the Qing were Ma Guangyuan, Wu Rujie, Zu Dashou, Quan Jie, Geng Zhongming, Zu Zehong, Zu Zepu, Zu Zerun, Deng Changchun, Wang Shixian, Hong Chengchou, Shang Kexi, Liu Wuyuan, Zu Kefa, Zhang Cunren, Meng Qiaofang, Kong Youde, Sun Dingliao. Aristocratic and military ranks, silver, horses and official positions were given to Han Chinese defectors like Zhang Cunren, Sun Dingliao, Liu Wu, Liu Liangchen, Zu Zehong, Zu Zepu, Zu Kufa and Zu Zerun. Han Chinese defectors were primarily responsible for military strategy after 1631. So many Han defected to the Qing and swelled up the ranks of the Eight Banners that ethnic Manchus became a minority within the Banners, making up only 16% in 1648, with Han Bannermen dominating at 75% and Mongol Bannermen making up the rest. It was this multi-ethnic force in which Manchus were only a minority, which unified China for the Qing. The Qing takeover was done by the multi-ethnic Han Banners, Mongol Banners, and Manchu Banners which made up the Qing military. In 1644, the Ming was invaded by an army that had only a fraction of Manchus, the invading army was multi-ethnic, with Han Banners, Mongols Banners, and Manchu Banners. The political barrier was between the commoners made out of non-bannermen Han Chinese and the \\"conquest elite\\", made out of Han Chinese bannermen, nobles, and Mongols and Manchu. It was not ethnicity which was the factor. Han (Nikan) bannermen used banners of black color and Nurhaci was guarded by Han soldiers. Other banners became a minority compared to the Han Nikan Black Banner detachments during Nurhaci's reign. Lead-up to the Great Wall =Second Joseon campaign (1636-1637)= The Later Jin had forced Joseon to open markets near the borders because its conflicts with Ming had brought economic hardship and starvation to Jin subjects. Joseon was also forced to transfer suzerainty of the Warka tribe to Jin. Furthermore, a tribute of 100 horses, 100 tiger and leopard skins, 400 bolts of cotton, and 15,000 pieces of cloth was to be extracted and gifted to the Jin Khan. Injo's brother was sent to deliver this tribute. However, in later letters to the Joseon king, Hong Taiji would complain that the Koreans did not behave as if they had lost, and were not abiding by the terms of the agreement. Joseon merchants and markets continued to trade with Ming and actively aided Ming subjects by providing them with grain and rations. Hong Taiji rebuked them, saying that the food of Joseon should only be fed to Joseon subjects. Prior to the invasion, Hong Taiji sent Abatai, Jirgalang, and Ajige to secure the coastal approaches to Korea, so that Ming could not send reinforcements.. On 9 December 1636, Hong Taiji led Manchu, Mongol, and Han Banners against Joseon. Chinese support was particularly evident in the army's artillery and naval contingents. The defected Ming mutineer Kong Youde, ennobled as the Qing's Prince Gongshun, joined the attacks on Ganghwa and Ka (\\"Pidao\\"). The defectors Geng Zhongming and Shang Kexi also played prominent roles in the Korean invasion. After the Second Manchu invasion of Korea, Joseon Korea was forced to give several of their royal princesses as concubines to the Qing Manchu regent Prince Dorgon. In 1650 Dorgon married the Korean Princess Uisun. The Princess' name in Korean was Uisun and she was Prince Yi Kaeyoon's (Kumrimgoon) daughter. Dorgon married two Korean princesses at Lianshan. =Campaigns against the Amur tribes= The Qing defeated the Evenk-Daur federation led by Evenki chief Bombogor and beheaded Bombogor in 1640, with Qing armies massacring and deporting Evenkis and absorbing the survivors into the Banners. The Nanais at first fought against the Nurhaci and the Manchus, led by their own Nanai Hurka chief Sosoku before surrendering to Hongtaiji in 1631. Mandatory shaving of the front of all male heads was imposed on Amur peoples conquered by the Qing like the Nanai people. The Amur peoples already wore the queue on the back of their heads but did not shave the front until the Qing subjected them and ordered them to shave. The Qing married off Manchu princesses to Amur chiefs who submitted to their rule. The Daur and Tungusic Amur Evenks, Nanai and other ethnicities of the Amur region were absorbed into the Qing Eight Banner system. =Liaoxi campaign (1638-1642)= In 1638, Qing armies raided deep into the interior of China as far as Jinan in Shandong province and immediately retreated back across the Great Wall. The Ming emperor insisted on concentrating all efforts at fighting the rebel armies instead, likening the Qing to be a mere \\"skin rash\\" while the rebels were a \\"visceral disease\\". In 1641, Jinzhou was besieged by a force of over 30 cannons of Han Chinese banner artillery under Manchu Prince Jirgalang, with supporting Korean artillery under the command of Yu Im. The Koreans, however, were incapacitated by outbreaks of disease. The fortress city of Songshan fell next due to the defection and betrayal of Ming commander Xia Chengde. The emperor responded by ordering the Ningyuan garrison commander Wu Sangui to go on the offense, but he was quickly repelled. Manchu Prince Abatai then led another raid into the interior of China, reaching Northern Jiangsu province and looting 12,000 gold taels and 2,200,000 silver taels. Ming Grand Secretary Zhou Yanru refused to engage in battle, while fabricating reports of victory and extorting bribes to cover up for defeats. Prince-Regent Dorgon later told his officials how \\"it was really very comical\\" reading captured Ming military reports, because most were fabricated stories of victory. Meanwhile, rebel \\"bandits\\" continued advancing. After the fall of Songshan, amid the urging of his brother and sons (formerly also Ming generals) to join them in defecting to the Qing, the commander of Jinzhou, Zu Dashou, also defected on 8 April 1642, handing them the city. Beijing and the north (1644) In their later years, the Ming faced a number of famines and floods as well as economic chaos, and rebellions. Li Zicheng rebelled in the 1630s in Shaanxi in the north, while a mutiny led by Zhang Xianzhong broke out in Sichuan in the 1640s. Historians estimated that up to one million people were killed in this self-proclaimed emperor's reign of terror. from J.B. Parsons, The Peasant Rebellions of the Late Ming Dynasty (University of Arizona Press). 1970 Just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the Ming, the peasant rebellions ravaging northern China were approaching dangerously close to the Ming capital Beijing. In February 1644, rebel leader Li Zicheng had founded the Shun dynasty in Xi'an and proclaimed himself king. In March his armies had captured the important city of Taiyuan in Shanxi. Seeing the progress of the rebels, on 5 April the Ming Chongzhen Emperor requested the urgent help of any military commandant in the Empire. On 24 April Li Zicheng breached the walls of Beijing, and the Emperor hanged himself the next day on a hill behind the Forbidden City. He was the last Ming emperor to reign in Beijing. The Qing made a proposal to Li Zicheng's Shun forces on 6 March 1644 that they should ally and divide northern China between the Shun and Qing, sending a delegation to propose a joint attack on the Ming to take over the Central Plains. The Shun received the letter. When Li Zicheng and his army reached Beijing, he had made an offer via the former Ming eunuch Du Xun to the Chongzhen Emperor of the Ming dynasty that Li Zicheng would fight the Qing dynasty and eradicate all other rebels on behalf of the Ming, if the Ming dynasty would recognize Li Zicheng's control over his Shaanxi-Shanxi fief, pay him 1 million taels and confirm Li Zicheng's noble rank of Prince. Li Zicheng did not intend to overthrow the Ming Emperor or kill him. The Ming Emperor, however, fearful that accepting such political expediency would ruin his reputation tried to get Wei Zaode (È≠èËóªÂæ∑), the Chief Grand Secretary, to agree with the decision and shoulder the responsibility of the decision. Wei Zaode refused to answer, so the Chongzhen Emperor rejected Li Zicheng's terms. Li Zicheng marched into the capital as Ming officials surrendered and defected. Li Zicheng still did not intend to kill the Chongzhen Emperor and the Ming Crown Prince, intending to recognise them as nobles of the new Shun dynasty. Li Zicheng lamented the death of the Chongzhen Emperor after discovering he committed suicide, saying that he had come to share power and rule together with him. Li Zicheng distrusted the Ming officials who defected to his side when the Ming fell, viewing them as the reason for the Ming demise. After declaring his own Shun dynasty in Beijing, Li Zicheng sent an offer to the powerful Ming General at the Great Wall, Wu Sangui, to defect to his side in exchange for a high noble rank and title. Wu Sangui dallied for days before he decided to accept the rank and defect to Li Zicheng. Wu Sangui was on his way to formally capitulate and defect to Li Zicheng, but by that time Li Zicheng thought Wu Sangui's silence meant he had rejected the offer and ordered Wu Sangui's father to be beheaded. This caused Wu Sangui to defect to the Qing. The battle at Shanhai Pass that allowed Manchus to enter the China proper Soon after the emperor had called for help, Ming general Wu Sangui had left his stronghold of Ningyuan north of the Great Wall and started marching toward the capital. On 26 April, his armies had moved through the fortifications of the Shanhai Pass (the eastern end of the Great Wall) and were marching toward Beijing when he heard that the city had fallen, whereupon he returned to the Shanhai Pass. Li Zicheng sent two armies to attack the Pass but Wu's battle- hardened troops defeated them easily on 5 May and 10 May. Then on 18 May, Li Zicheng personally led 60,000 of his troops out of Beijing to attack Wu. At the same time, Wu Sangui wrote to Dorgon to request the Qing's help in ousting the bandits and restoring the Ming dynasty. Meanwhile, Wu Sangui's departure from the stronghold of Ningyuan had left all the territory outside the Great Wall under Qing control. Two of Dorgon's most prominent Chinese advisors, Hong Chengchou and Fan Wencheng (ËåÉÊñáÁ®ã), urged the Manchu prince to seize the opportunity of the fall of Beijing to present themselves as avengers of the fallen Ming and to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing. Therefore, when Dorgon received Wu's letter, he was already about to lead an expedition to attack northern China and had no intention to restore the Ming. When Dorgon asked Wu to work for the Qing instead, Wu had little choice but to accept. After Wu formally surrendered to the Qing in the morning of 27 May, his elite troops charged the rebel army repeatedly, but were unable to break the enemy lines. Dorgon waited until both sides were weakened before ordering his cavalry to gallop around Wu's right wing to charge Li's left flank. Li Zicheng's troops were quickly routed and fled back toward Beijing. After their defeat at the Battle of Shanhai Pass, the Shun troops looted Beijing for several days until Li Zicheng left the capital on 4 June with all the wealth he could carry, one day after he had defiantly proclaimed himself Emperor of the Great Shun. Qing Prince of Yu, Dodo berated the Southern Ming Prince of Fu, Zhu Yousong over his battle strategy in 1645, telling him that the Southern Ming would have defeated the Qing if only the southern Ming assaulted the Qing military before they forded the Yellow river instead of tarrying. The Prince of Fu could find no words to respond when he tried to defend himself. = Ethnic situation = Wu Sangui was a general of the Ming dynasty, who later defected to the Qing dynasty. However, his hopes to restore the former were dashed after he rebelled against the Kangxi Emperor. The easy transition between the Ming and Qing dynasties has been ascribed to the Chongzhen Emperor's refusal to move southward when his capital had been under rebel threat. This allowed the Qing dynasty to capture an entire corps of qualified civil servants to administer the country, and also ensured that the Southern Ming pretenders would suffer from infighting due to their weak claims on the throne. A large emigre elite of northerners in the south would also have increased the probability of an aggressive policy of reconquest to regain their northern homelands. Imperial examinations started being organised almost immediately upon the Qing capture of Beijing. The early Qing government was dominated by scholars from North China, and a strong factional rivalry between Northern and Southern scholars ensued. Ming dynasty officials in the finance, appointments and military departments largely joined the new dynasty and formed the core of the Qing civil service, but not the staff of rites, music and literature (the Qing may not have prioritised these either). These defectors were responsible for easing the transition of government without major setbacks. A large proportion of military officials and civilian officials in the Board of War were given promotions after defecting. The top positions were mainly in the hands of Han Bannermen from Liaodong. When Dorgon ordered Han civilians to vacate Beijing's inner city and move to the outskirts, he resettled the inner city with the Bannermen, including Han Chinese bannermen. Later, some exceptions were made, allowing Han civilians who held government or commercial jobs to also reside in the inner city. The civilian government was flooded by Han Chinese Bannermen. The Six Boards President and other major positions were filled with Han Bannermen chosen by the Qing. It was Han Chinese Bannermen who were responsible for the successful Qing takeover. They made up the majority of governors in the early Qing and were the ones who governed and administered China, stabilizing Qing rule. Han Bannermen dominated governor-general posts in the time of the Shunzhi and Kangxi Emperors, as well as governor posts, largely excluding ordinary Han civilians.Spence 1988, pp. 4‚Äì5. Three Liaodong Han Bannermen officers who played a major role in southern China from the Ming were Shang Kexi, Geng Zhongming, and Kong Youde. They governed southern China autonomously as viceroys for the Qing.Di Cosmo 2007, p. 7. The Qing deliberately avoided placing Manchus or Mongols as provincial governors and governors-general, with not a single Manchu governor until 1658, and not a single governor-general until 1668. A portrait of Hong Chengchou (1593‚Äì1665), a former Ming official who advised Dorgon to take advantage of the violent death of the Ming Chongzhen Emperor to present the Qing as the avengers of the Ming and to conquer all of China instead of raiding for loot and slaves. In addition to Han Banners, the Qing relied on the Green Standard soldiers, composed of Han (Ming) military forces who defected to the Qing, in order to help rule northern China. It was these troops who provided day-to-day military governance in China, and supplied the forces used in the front-line fighting. Han Bannermen, Mongol Bannermen, and Manchu Bannermen were only deployed to respond to emergency situations where there was sustained military resistance. It was such a Qing army composed mostly of Han Bannermen which attacked Koxinga's Ming loyalists in Nanjing. The Manchus sent Han Bannermen to fight against Koxinga's Ming loyalists in Fujian. The Qing carried out a massive depopulation policy and clearances, forcing people to evacuate the coast in order to deprive Koxinga's Ming loyalists of resources: this led to a myth that it was because Manchus were \\"afraid of water\\". In fact, in Guangdong and Fujian, it was Han Bannermen who were the ones carrying out the fighting and killing for the Qing and this disproves the claim that \\"fear of water\\" on part of the Manchus had to do with the coastal evacuation to move inland and declare the sea ban. Most of the coastal population of Fujian fled to the hills or to Taiwan to avoid the war; Fuzhou was an empty city when the Qing forces entered it. =Chinese military science and military texts= On the orders of Nurhaci in 1629, a number of Chinese works considered to be of critical importance were translated into Manchu by Dahai. The first works translated were all Chinese military texts dedicated to the arts of war due to the Manchu interests in the topic. They were the Liutao, Su Shu (Á¥†Êõ∏), and Sanl√ºe followed by the military text Wuzi and The Art of War. Other texts translated into Manchu by Dahai included the Ming penal code. The Manchus placed great significance on Chinese texts relating to military affairs and governance, and further Chinese texts of history, law and military theory were translated into Manchu during the rule of Hong Taiji in Mukden. A Manchu translation was made of the military themed Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. As well as the translations by Dahai, other Chinese literature, military theory and legal texts were translated into Manchu by Erdeni. Under the reign of Dorgon, whom historians have variously called \\"the mastermind of the Qing conquest\\" and \\"the principal architect of the great Manchu enterprise\\", the Qing subdued the capital area, received the capitulation of Shandong local elites and officials, and took Shanxi and Shaanxi. They then turned their eyes to the rich commercial and agricultural region of Jiangnan south of the lower Yangtze River. They also wiped out the last remnants of rival regimes established by Li Zicheng (killed in 1645) and Zhang Xianzhong (Chengdu taken in early 1647). Finally, they managed to kill claimants to the throne of the Southern Ming in Nanjing (1645) and Fuzhou (1646) and chased Zhu Youlang, the last Southern Ming emperor, out of Guangzhou (1647) and into the far southwestern reaches of China.  Consolidation in the north and Sichuan  Map of changed areas in the early Qing expansion (East China) Soon after entering Beijing in June 1644, Dorgon despatched Wu Sangui and his troops to pursue Li Zicheng, the rebel leader who had driven the last Ming emperor to suicide, but had been defeated by the Qing in late May at the Battle of Shanhai Pass. Wu managed to engage Li's rearguard many times, but Li still managed to cross the Gu Pass (ÊïÖÈóú) into Shanxi, and Wu returned to Beijing. Li Zicheng reestablished his power base in Xi'an (Shaanxi province), where he had declared the foundation of his Shun dynasty back in February 1644. In October of that year Dorgon sent several armies to root out Li Zicheng from his Shaanxi stronghold, after repressing revolts against Qing rule in Hebei and Shandong in the Summer and Fall of 1644. Qing armies led by Ajige, Dodo, and Shi Tingzhu (Áü≥Âª∑Êü±) won consecutive engagements against Shun forces in Shanxi and Shaanxi, forcing Li Zicheng to leave his Xi'an headquarters in February 1645. Li retreated through several provinces until he was killed in September 1645, either by his own hand or by a peasant group that had organized for self-defense in this time of rampant banditry. Between Beijing and Datong and in Shanxi province Millenarianist groups of martial artist acolytes calling themselves the \\"Supreme Heaven's Clear and Pure Good Friends\\" and the \\"Society of Good Friends\\" respectively rose up in rebellion in 1645 against the new regime. These were suppressed by slaughtering anyone suspected of membership in such popular sects. =The northwest (1644‚Äì1650)= The Monguors, who were tusi appointed by the Ming emperor, supported the Ming against a Tibetan revolt and against Li Zicheng's rebels in 1642. They were unable to resist Li Zicheng and many tusi chiefs were massacred. When the Qing forces under Ajige and Meng Qiaofang fought against Li's forces after 1644 they quickly joined the Qing side. Meanwhile, Ming loyalist forces numbering 70,000 well-equipped troops were coalescing in the mountains south of Xi'an, under former Ming commanders Sun Shoufa, He Zhen and Wu Dading, capturing the city of Fengxiang. As they advanced toward Xi'an they were flanked by recent Ming defectors under Meng Qiaofang, and overrun with Bannermen. He Zhen's rebels were mainly bandits, and they continued operating out of small stockades in the forested, mountainous regions with ten to 15 rebel families in every stockade, usually centered around a temple. They generally enjoyed popular support, and would retreat to the higher mountain safehouses upon receiving locals' notice of any military movements in the area. Groups of stockades congregated around a \\"King\\", who would grant commissions of Colonel or Major to other stockade leaders. They were finally pacified by forces led by Ren Zhen. Late in 1646, forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as Milayin (Á±≥ÂñáÂç∞) revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou (Gansu). He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong (‰∏ÅÂúãÊ£ü). Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the fallen Ming, they occupied a number of towns in Gansu, including the provincial capital Lanzhou. These rebels' willingness to collaborate with non- Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion, and were not aiming to create an Islamic state. To pacify the rebels, the Qing government quickly despatched Meng Qiaofang (Â≠üÂñ¨Ëä≥), governor of Shaanxi, a former Ming official who had surrendered to the Qing in 1631. Both Milayin and Ding Guodong were captured and killed in 1648, and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties. The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by the Muslim Chagatid Kumul Khanate and the Turfan Khanate and after their defeat, Kumul submitted to the Qing. Another Muslim rebel, Ma Shouying, was allied to Li Zicheng and the Shun dynasty. = Sichuan campaign (1644‚Äì1647) = In early 1646 Dorgon sent two expeditions to Sichuan to try to destroy Zhang Xianzhong's Great Xi dynasty regime: the first expedition did not reach Sichuan because it was caught up against remnants; the second one, under the direction of Hooge (the son of Hong Taiji who had lost the succession struggle of 1643) reached Sichuan in October 1646. Hearing that a Qing army led by a major general was approaching, Zhang Xianzhong fled toward Shaanxi, splitting his troops into four divisions that were ordered to act independently if something were to happen to him. Before leaving, he ordered a massacre of the population of his capital Chengdu. Zhang Xianzhong was killed in a battle against Qing forces near Xichong in central Sichuan on 1 February 1647. In one account, he was betrayed by one of his officers, Liu Jinzhong, who pointed him out to be shot by an archer.Parsons 1957, p. 399. Hooge then easily took Chengdu, but found it in a state of desolation he had not expected. Unable to find food in the countryside, his soldiers looted the area, killing resisters, and even resorted to cannibalism as food shortages grew acute.  Jiangnan (1645-1650)  Portrait of Shi Kefa, who refused to surrender to the Qing in the defense of Yangzhou A few weeks after the Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide in Beijing in April 1644, some descendants of the Ming imperial house started arriving in Nanjing, which had been the auxiliary capital of the Ming dynasty. Agreeing that the Ming needed an imperial figure to rally support in the south, the Nanjing Minister of War Shi Kefa and the Fengyang Governor-general Ma Shiying (È¶¨Â£´Ëã±) agreed to form a loyalist Ming government around the Prince of Fu, Zhu Yousong, a first cousin of the Chongzhen Emperor who had been next in line for succession after the dead emperor's sons, whose fates were still unknown. The Prince was crowned as emperor on 19 June 1644 under the protection of Ma Shiying and his large war fleet. He would reign under the era name \\"Hongguang\\" (ÂºòÂÖâ). The Hongguang regime was ridden with factional bickering that facilitated the Qing conquest of Jiangnan, which was launched from Xi'an in April 1645. He set out from Xi'an on that very day. For examples of the factional struggles that weakened the Hongguang court, see . Greatly aided by the surrender of Southern Ming commanders Li Chengdong (ÊùéÊàêÊù±) and Liu Liangzuo (ÂäâËâØ‰Ωê), the Qing army took the key city of Xuzhou north of the Huai River in early May 1645, leaving Shi Kefa in Yangzhou as the main defender of the Southern Ming's northern frontiers. The betrayal of these commanders handed over the entire northwestern zone of the Southern Ming, helping the Qing forces to link up. Ma Shiying had under his command in Nanjing indigenous ethnic minority warriors who came all the way from Sichuan. In Jiangnan, the Qing implemented peaceful surrender for districts and cities who defected without any violent resistance, leaving the local Ming officials who defected in charge and the Qing Han-Manchu army would not attack them nor kill or do any violence against peaceful defectors. Several contingents of Qing forces converged on Yangzhou on 13 May 1645. The majority of the Qing army which marched on the city were Ming defectors and they far outnumbered the Manchus and Bannermen. Shi Kefa's small force refused to surrender, but could not resist Dodo's artillery: on 20 May Qing cannon wielded by the Han Bannermen (Ujen Coohai) breached the city wall and Dodo ordered the \\"brutal slaughter\\" of Yangzhou's entire population[145] to terrorize other Jiangnan cities into surrendering to the Qing. On 1 June Qing armies crossed the Yangzi River and easily took the garrison city of Zhenjiang, which protected access to Nanjing. The Qing arrived at the gates of Nanjing a week later, but the Hongguang Emperor had already fled. The city surrendered without a fight on 16 June after its last defenders had made Dodo promise he would not hurt the population. Within less than a month, the Qing had captured the fleeing Ming emperor (he died in Beijing the following year) and seized Jiangnan's main cities, including Suzhou and Hangzhou. By then the frontier between the Qing and the Southern Ming had been pushed south to the Qiantang River. Nieuhof observed that the city of Nanjing was unharmed by Qing soldiers. Manchu soldiers ransomed women captured from Yangzhou back to their original husbands and fathers in Nanjing after Nanjing peacefully surrendered, corralling the women into the city and whipping them hard with their hair containing a tag showing the price of the ransom, which was cheap at only 3 to 4 taels for the best and 10 taels at most for those wearing good clothing. = Queue order = A Chinese man in San Francisco's Chinatown around 1900. The Chinese habit of wearing a queue came from Dorgon's July 1645 edict ordering all men to shave their forehead and tie their hair into a queue like the Manchus. On 21 July 1645, after the Jiangnan region had been superficially pacified, Dorgon issued \\"the most untimely promulgation of his career\\": he ordered all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid the rest of their hair into a queue just like the Manchus. The punishment for non-compliance was death. In the queue order edict, Dorgon specifically emphasized the fact that Manchus and the Qing emperor himself all wore the queue and shaved their foreheads so that by following the queue order and shaving, Han Chinese would look like Manchus and the Qing Emperor and invoked the Confucian notion that the people were like the sons of the emperor who was like the father, so the father and sons could not look different and to decrease differences in physical appearance between Manchu and Han. The queue order was proposed by a number of Han Chinese officials in order to curry favour with Dorgon. This policy of symbolic submission to the new dynasty helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe. However, for Han officials and literati, the new hairstyle was \\"a humiliating act of degradation\\" (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair \\"was tantamount to the loss of their manhood.\\" Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair- cutting command \\"broke the momentum of the Qing [expansion].\\" The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming northern Chinese general Li Chengdong (ÊùéÊàêÊù±), respectively on August 24 and September 22. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by northern Chinese Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (ÂäâËâØ‰Ωê), who had been ordered to \\"fill the city with corpses before you sheathe your swords,\\" massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed before all of China was brought into compliance. Although Manchu Bannermen were often associated with the Jiangyin Massacre which targeted the Ming loyalists, the majority of those who had participated in Jiangyin Massacre were Chinese Bannermen. When the Qing imposed the Queue Order in China, many Han defectors were appointed in the massacre of dissidents. Li Chengdong, a former Ming general who had defected to the Qing faction, oversaw three massacres in Jiading that occurred within the same month; together which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and left cities depopulated.. In Fuzhou, although former-Ming subjects were initially compensated with silver for complying to the Queue Order, the defected southern Chinese general Hong Chengchou had enforced the policy thoroughly on the residents of Jiangnan by 1645. The Han banners were repeatedly assigned to enforce the Queue Order, often resulting in massacres such as the Yangzhou Massacre, during which local residents were seen harassed by troops. Ming defector Li Chengdong's Han Chinese soldiers who were mostly former revolted refugees, peasants and bandits from the north called the Han Chinese anti-queue resisters and Ming loyalists in Jiading \\"southern barbarians\\" (manzi) threatening them, telling them \\"southern barbarian, hand over your valuables\\", raping, torturing and massacring. In Guangzhou, massacres of Ming loyalists and civilians in 1650 were carried out by Qing forces under the command of northern Han Chinese Banner Generals Shang Kexi and Geng Jimao.  The southeast (1646‚Äì1650) Qing conquest of South Ming territories Situation of Southern Ming Meanwhile, the Southern Ming had not been eliminated. When Hangzhou fell to the Qing on 6 July 1645, the Prince of Tang Zhu Yujian, a ninth-generation descendant of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang, managed to escape by land to the southeastern province of Fujian. Crowned as the Longwu Emperor in the coastal city of Fuzhou on 18 August, he depended on the protection of talented seafarer Zheng Zhilong (also known as \\"Nicholas Iquan\\"). The childless emperor adopted Zheng's eldest son and granted him the imperial surname. \\"Koxinga,\\" as this son is known to Westerners, is a distortion of the title \\"Lord of the Imperial Surname\\" (Guoxingye ÂúãÂßìÁà∫). In the meantime, another Ming claimant, the Prince of Lu Zhu Yihai, had named himself regent in Zhejiang, but the two loyalist regimes failed to cooperate, making their chances of success even lower than they already were. In February 1646, Qing armies seized land west of the Qiantang River from the Lu regime and defeated a ragtag force representing the Longwu Emperor in northeastern Jiangxi. In May, they besieged Ganzhou, the last Ming bastion in Jiangxi. In July, a new Southern Campaign led by Prince Bolo sent Prince of Lu's Zhejiang regime into disarray and proceeded to attack the Longwu regime in Fujian. On the pretext of relieving the siege of Ganzhou, the Longwu court left their Fujian base in late September 1646, but the Qing army caught up with them. Longwu and his empress were summarily executed in Tingzhou (western Fujian) on 6 October. After the fall of Fuzhou on 17 October, Zheng Zhilong surrendered to the Qing and his son Koxinga fled to the island of Taiwan with his fleet. The Prince-Regent of Lu, with the aid of the sea-lord Zhang Mingzhen, continued resistance at sea on the island of Shacheng, between Zhejiang and Fujian. By July 1649 their base of operations shifted northward to Jiantiaosuo. After killing a rival naval commander Huang Binqing, the base was moved to Zhoushan in November. From there he attempted to raise a rebellion in Jiangnan, but Zhoushan fell to the Qing after being betrayed by Huang Binqing's former officers. Zhang Mingzhen, his family all slain, fled to join Zheng Chenggong in Xiamen. A cannon cast in 1650 by the Southern Ming. (From the Hong Kong Museum of Coastal Defence.) The Longwu Emperor's younger brother Zhu Yuyue, who had fled Fuzhou by sea, soon founded another Ming regime in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, taking the reign title Shaowu (Á¥πÊ≠¶) on 11 December 1646. Short of official costumes, the court had to purchase robes from local theater troops. On 24 December, Prince of Gui Zhu Youlang established the Yongli (Ê∞∏ÊõÜ) regime in the same vicinity. The two Ming regimes fought each other until 20 January 1647, when a small Qing force led by former Southern Ming commander Li Chengdong (ÊùéÊàêÊù±) captured Guangzhou, killing the Shaowu Emperor and sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing to Nanning in Guangxi. In May 1648, however, Li Chengdong, disappointed at being made a mere regional commander, mutinied against the Qing and rejoined the Ming, and the concurrent reversion of another dissatisfied ex-Ming general, Jin Shenghuan, in Jiangxi helped the Yongli regime to retake most of southern China. This resurgence of loyalist hopes was short-lived. New Qing armies managed to reconquer the central provinces of Huguang (present-day Hubei and Hunan), Jiangxi, and Guangdong in 1649 and 1650. The Yongli Emperor fled to Nanning and from there to Guizhou. Finally on 24 November 1650, Qing forces led by Shang Kexi captured Guangzhou with the aid of Dutch gunners and massacred the city's population, killing as many as 70,000 people.  Ming loyalist revolts in the North (1647‚Äì1649)  A major revolt around Zouping, Shandong broke out in March 1647. Shandong had been plagued by brigandage before the collapse of the Ming, and most Ming officials and their gentry- organised militia welcomed the new Qing regime, cooperating with them against the bandits who now grew into sizeable rebel armies complete with guns and cannons, and who leaders had declared themselves \\"kings\\". These were held off by the local gentry, who organised the local population into a defence force. In March 1648, a bandit chief, Yang Sihai, and a woman by the surname of Zhang, claimed to be the Crown Prince of the Tianqi Emperor, and his consort, respectively. With the aid of another bandit chief called Zhang Tianbao, they rebelled under the Ming flag in Qingyun, south of Tianjin. The Qing was forced to send in \\"heavy troops\\" (artillery), as well as extra reinforcements. The Qing succeeded in subduing the rebellion in 1649, but with heavy losses. Further south, in the forests between Shandong, Hebei, and Henan provinces, 20 Ming loyalist brigades of 1,000 men each were amassing. This force was known as the \\"Elm Garden Army\\", equipped with Western cannons. Commander Li Huajing had declared a distant relative of the Ming imperial family as the \\"Tianzheng Emperor\\", and besieged and captured the cities of Caozhou, Dingtao County, Chengwu County, and Dongming County, Lanyang and Fengqiu. Heavy casualties were inflicted on the Qing. Defected Ming general Gao Di led elite multi- ethnic Banner forces to crush the insurrection by November 18. In January 1649, Jiang Xiang, the military governor in Datong, Shanxi, felt threatened that Dorgon might be attempting to restrict his authority and rebelled, switching allegiance back to the Ming. Dorgon travelled to personally intervene against the rebels. The generals Liu Denglou, commander of Yulin, Shaanxi, and Wang Yongqiang, top commander in Yan'an, Shaanxi, rebelled and switched back to the Ming. and The revolt was defeated by the end of the year by a Banner force commanded by Prince Bolo, and Wu Sangui. The Ming loyalist- held city of Puzhou was subject to a massacre. Simultaneously, Zhu Senfu, a man who claimed to be related to the Ming Imperial family, declared himself Prince of Qin in Jiezhou, Shaanxi, near Sichuan, backed by a local outlaw Zhao Ronggui with an army of 10,000 men. The rebels were crushed by Wu Sangui's forces. In the chaos, many bandit groups expanded their raids. A local outlaw by the name of Zhang Wugui rose up in Shanxi and began handing out Ming ranks and documents, assembling an army. He attacked Wutai in 1649, but was driven off. He continued marauding the province until he was killed in February 1655. The southeastern region of Shaanxi, a rural, untamed area, was beset by Ming Colonel Tang Zhongzheng, accompanied by two Ming princes Zhu Changying and Zhu Youdu and a Ming Mongol commander, Shibulai. Other rebels, given the ready access to the Ming loyalists in neighbouring Sichuan, were able to continue resistance. Sun Shoujin, who called himself the Earl of Xing'an, with the aid of General Tan Qi, led an alliance of mountain fortresses around Mount Banchang. They resisted an intense Banner assault with their long rifles, but Tan Qi abandoned Sun in July 1652, leading to Sun's defeat and death. A bandit gang, the \\"Pole bandits\\", who were plundering the local population were also defeated shortly afterward by the betrayal of one of their two chiefs.  The southwest (1652‚Äì1661)  The flight of the Yongli Emperor‚Äîthe last sovereign of the Southern Ming dynasty‚Äîfrom 1647 to 1661. The provincial and national boundaries are those of the People's Republic of China. After the elimination of Zhang Xianzhong's Xi dynasty, his generals retreated southward to Guizhou province, where they encountered the Southern Ming forces retreating from Guangxi province. The Ming emperor, in urgent need of reinforcements, requested the aid of the Xi dynasty's followers. Zhang Xianzhong's former deputy, Sun Kewang, exterminated all his opponents in the Southern Ming court and kept the Ming emperor under de facto imprisonment, all the while continuing to refer to Zhang Xianzhong as a deceased Emperor. Though the Qing under Dorgon's leadership had successfully pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China, Ming loyalism was not dead yet. In early August 1652, Li Dingguo, who had served as general in Sichuan under Zhang Xianzhong (d. 1647) and was now protecting the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming, retook Guilin (Guangxi province) from the Qing. Within a month, most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side. Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in Huguang and Guangdong in the next two years, Li failed to retake important cities. In 1653, the Qing court put Hong Chengchou in charge of retaking the southwest. Headquartered in Changsha (in what is now Hunan province), he patiently built up his forces; only in late 1658 did well-fed and well-supplied Qing troops mount a multipronged campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan. Infighting broke out between the forces of Li Dingguo and Sun Kewang. The Ming emperor, fearful that Sun intended to make himself emperor, asked Li Dingguo to liberate him. After Sun's forces were routed, he and his surviving troops defected to Hong Chengchou's Qing armies, giving the Qing their opening to strike. In late January 1659, a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan, sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby Burma, which was then ruled by King Pindale Min of the Toungoo dynasty. The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662, when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui, whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the Qing expansion. Zheng Chenggong (\\"Koxinga\\"), who had been adopted by the Longwu Emperor in 1646 and ennobled by Yongli in 1655, also continued to defend the cause of the Southern Ming. In 1659, just as Shunzhi was preparing to hold a special examination to celebrate the glories of his reign and the success of the southwestern campaigns, Zheng sailed up the Yangtze River with a well-armed fleet, took several cities from Qing hands, and went so far as to threaten Nanjing. Despite capturing many counties in his initial attack due to surprise and having the initiative, Koxinga announced the final battle in Nanjing ahead of time giving plenty of time for the Qing to prepare because he wanted a decisive, single grand showdown like his father successfully did against the Dutch at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay, throwing away the surprise and initiative which led to its failure. Koxinga's attack on Qing held Nanjing which would interrupt the supply route of the Grand Canal leading to possible starvation in Beijing caused such fear that the Manchus (Tartares) considered returning to Manchuria (Tartary) and abandoning China according to a 1671 account by a French missionary. The commoners and officials in Beijing and Nanjing were waiting to support whichever side won. An official from Qing Beijing sent letters to family and another official in Nanjing, telling them all communication and news from Nanjing to Beijing had been cut off, that the Qing were considering abandoning Beijing and moving their capital far away to a remote location for safety since Koxinga's iron troops were rumored to be invincible. The letter said it reflected the grim situation being felt in Qing Beijing. The official told his children in Nanjing to prepare to defect to Koxinga which he himself was preparing to do. Koxinga's forces intercepted these letters and after reading them Koxinga may have started to regret his deliberate delays allowing the Qing to prepare for a final massive battle instead of swiftly attacking Nanjing. When the emperor heard of this sudden attack he is said to have slashed his throne with a sword in anger. But the siege of Nanjing was relieved and Zheng Chenggong repelled, forcing Zheng to take refuge in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian. Koxinga's Ming loyalists fought against a majority Han Chinese Bannermen Qing army when attacking Nanjing. The siege lasted almost three weeks, beginning on August 24. Koxinga's forces were unable to maintain a complete encirclement, which enabled the city to obtain supplies and even reinforcements‚Äîthough cavalry attacks by the city's forces were successful even before reinforcements arrived. Koxinga's forces were defeated and \\"slipped back\\" (Wakeman's phrase) to the ships which had brought them. Pressured by Qing fleets, Zheng fled to Taiwan in April 1661 and defeated the Dutch in the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, expelling them from Taiwan and setting up the Kingdom of Tungning. Zheng died in 1662. His descendants resisted Qing rule until 1683, when his grandson Zheng Keshuang surrendered Taiwan to the Kangxi Emperor after the Battle of Penghu. The Ming dynasty Princes who accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan were the Prince of Ningjing Zhu Shugui and Prince Zhu H√≥nghu√°n (Êú±ÂºòÊ°ì), son of Zhu Yihai. The Dutch looted relics and killed monks after attacking a Buddhist complex at Putuoshan on the Zhoushan islands in 1665 during their war against Zheng Chenggong's son Zheng Jing. Zheng Jing's navy executed 34 Dutch sailors and drowned eight Dutch sailors after looting, ambushing and sinking the Dutch fluyt ship Cuylenburg in 1672 on northeastern Taiwan. Only 21 Dutch sailors escaped to Japan. The ship was going from Nagasaki to Batavia on a trade mission. Koxinga executed Shi Lang's family causing him to defect to the Qing after Shi Lang disobeyed orders. Koxinga implemented extremely strict harsh discipline on his soldiers which caused many of them to defect to the Qing. Failure to listen to orders and failing in battle could bring death sentences with no leniency from Koxinga. The Qing implemented a lenient policy towards defectors who defected to the southern Ming, Koxinga, and the Three Feudatories, inviting and allowing them back into Qing ranks without punishment even after they initially betrayed the Qing and defected and was able to secure mass defections. The Three Feudatories (1674‚Äì1681) The riots of three feudatories Portrait of Shang Kexi by Johan Nieuhof (1655). Shang recaptured Guangzhou from Ming loyalist forces in 1650 and organized a massacre of the city's population. His son was one of the Three Feudatories who rebelled against the Qing in 1673 In 1673, Wu Sangui, Shang Kexi, and Geng Jimao, the \\"Three Feudatories\\", rebelled against the Kangxi Emperor. They dominated southern China, and Wu declared the \\"Zhou dynasty\\". However, their disunity destroyed them. Shang Zhixin and Geng surrendered in 1681 after a massive Qing counteroffensive, in which the Han Green Standard Army played the major role with the Bannermen taking a backseat. The rebellion was defeated mainly due to the refusal of most Han Chinese commanders to turn against the Qing dynasty. Particularly repulsive to many was the blatant opportunism of Wu Sangui, who had betrayed two dynasties in one lifetime: even Ming loyalists ridiculed his cause. Fan Chengmo, son of Fan Wencheng, remained loyal to the Qing despite imprisonment and eventually death, and as one of leading military families of Liaodong, his example inspired other Liaodong generals to remain loyal. The Qing forces were crushed by Wu from 1673‚Äì1674. The Qing had the support of the majority of Han Chinese soldiers and Han elite against the Three Feudatories, since they refused to join Wu Sangui in the revolt, while the Eight Banners and Manchu officers fared poorly against Wu Sangui, so the Qing responded with using a massive army of more than 900,000 Han (non-Banner) instead of the Eight Banners, to fight and crush the Three Feudatories. Wu Sangui's forces were crushed by the Green Standard Army, made out of defected Ming soldiers. In the Three Feudatories rebellion, Han bannermen who stayed on the Qing side and died in battle were categorized as martyrs. Taiwan (1683) Several Ming dynasty Princes accompanied Koxinga to Taiwan including Prince Zhu Shugui of Ningjing and Prince Zhu Honghuan (w:zh:Êú±ÂºòÊ°ì), the son of Zhu Yihai. The Kangxi Emperor, the one who had crushed the Three Feudatories' revolt, began his own campaigns to expand his empire. The Qing agreed to an alliance with the Dutch East India Company against the remaining Ming loyalists in Fujian and Taiwan. The Dutch intended to take a colonial outpost in Taiwan. In October 1663, the joint fleet succeeded in capturing Xiamen and Kinmen (Quemoy) from the Southern Ming. However, the Qing grew suspicious of Dutch ambitions to maintain a colony in Taiwan and to push for trading privileges, so the alliance collapsed. Admiral Shi Lang, who strongly objected to cession of Taiwan to the Dutch, offered to launch his own expedition instead. In 1683 the Kangxi Emperor dispatched Shi Lang with a fleet of 300 ships to take the Ming loyalist Kingdom of Tungning in Taiwan in 1683 from the Zheng family. Taiwan was then under Qing rule. Having lost the Battle of Penghu, Koxinga's grandson Zheng Keshuang surrendered and was rewarded by the Kangxi Emperor with the title \\"Duke of Haicheng\\" (). He and his soldiers were inducted into the Eight Banners. His rattan shield troops ( tengpaiying) served against Russian Cossacks at Albazin. The Qing sent most of the 17 Ming princes still living on Taiwan back to mainland China where they spent the rest of their lives.Manthorpe 2008, p. 108. The Prince of Ningjing and his five concubines committed suicide rather than submit to capture. Their palace was used as Shi Lang's headquarters in 1683 but he memorialized the emperor to convert it into a Mazu temple as a propaganda measure in quieting remaining resistance on Taiwan. The emperor approved its dedication as the Grand Matsu Temple the next year and, honoring the goddess Mazu for her supposed assistance during the Qing expansion, promoted her to \\"Empress of Heaven\\" (Tianhou) from her previous status as a heavenly consort (tianfei)...  Mongolia, Tibet, and Xinjiang (c. 1620-1750)  See the following pages: * Qing conquest of Mongolia * Qing conquest of Tibet * Tibet under Qing rule * Qing dynasty in Inner Asia (Xinjiang and parts of Central Asia) * Dzungar‚ÄìQing Wars  Literature and thought  Shitao (1642‚Äì1707), who was related to the Ming imperial family, was one of many artists and writers who refused to give their allegiance to the Qing. Art historian Craig Clunas suggests that Shitao used a poem inscribed on this \\"Self-Portrait Supervising the Planting of Pines\\" (1674) to allude to the restoration of the Ming dynasty The defeat of the Ming dynasty posed practical and moral problems, especially for literati and officials. Confucian teachings emphasized loyalty (Âø† zh≈çng), but the question arose as to whether Confucians should be loyal to the fallen Ming or to the new power, the Qing. Some, like the painter Bada Shanren, a descendant of the Ming ruling family, became recluses. Others, like Kong Shangren, who claimed to be a descendant of Confucius, supported the new regime. Kong wrote a poignant drama, The Peach Blossom Fan, which explored the moral decay of the Ming in order to explain its fall. Poets whose lives bridged the transition between Ming poetry and Qing poetry are attracting modern academic interest. Some of the most important first generation of Qing thinkers were Ming loyalists, at least in their hearts, including Gu Yanwu, Huang Zongxi, and Fang Yizhi. Partly in reaction and to protest the laxity and excess of the late Ming, they turned to evidential learning, which emphasized careful textual study and critical thinking. Another important group in this transitional period were the \\"Three Masters of Jiangdong\\"‚ÄîGong Dingzi, Wu Weiye, and Qian Qianyi‚Äîwho among other things contributed to a revival in the ci form of poetry. The emperors, in order to legitimize their rule, encouraged Qing officials and literary figures to organize and appropriate the legacy of Chinese literature, producing anthologies and critical works. They also patronized the development of Manchu literature and the translation of Chinese classics into Manchu. Yet the phrase \\"defeat the Qing and restore the Ming\\" remained a byword for many.  Aftermath  Dulimbai Gurun is the Manchu name for China (‰∏≠Âúã Zhongguo; \\"Middle Kingdom\\").Hauer 2007, p. 117.Dvo≈ô√°k 1895, p. 80.Wu 1995, p. 102. After extinguishing the Ming, the Qing identified their state as \\"China\\" (Zhongguo), and referred to it as \\"Dulimbai Gurun\\" in Manchu. The Qing equated the lands of the Qing state (including present day Manchuria, Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet and other areas) as \\"China\\" in both the Chinese and Manchu languages, defining China as a multi-ethnic state, rejecting the idea that China only meant Han areas, proclaiming that both Han and non-Han peoples were part of \\"China\\", using \\"China\\" to refer to the Qing in official documents, international treaties, and foreign affairs, and the \\"Chinese language\\" (Dulimbai gurun i bithe) referred to Han Chinese, Manchu, and Mongol languages, and the term \\"Chinese people\\" (‰∏≠Âúã‰∫∫ Zhongguo ren; Manchu: Dulimbai gurun i niyalma) referred to all Han, Manchus, and Mongol subjects of the Qing.Zhao 2006, pp. 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14. During the Qing, many Han Chinese later found themselves in positions of power and influence in Manchu administration and even had their own slaves. The Qing dynasty in 1820. When the Qing defeated Dzungar Mongols in 1759, they proclaimed that the Oirats territorial lands were absorbed into \\"China\\" (Dulimbai Gurun) realm in a Manchu language memorial.Dunnell 2004, p. 77.Dunnell 2004, p. 83. They expounded the ideology that they were bringing together the \\"outer\\" non-Han like the Khalkha Mongols, Inner Mongols, Oirats (including Tibetans, who were then under the rule of Oirat Khanates) together with the \\"inner\\" Han Chinese, into \\"one family\\" united under the Qing state. To show that the diverse subjects of the Qing were all part of one family, the Qing used the phrase \\"Zhongwai yijia\\" (‰∏≠Â§ñ‰∏ÄÂÆ∂, \\"central areas and outer areas as one realm\\") or \\"neiwei yijia\\" (ÂÖßÂ§ñ‰∏ÄÂÆ∂, \\"interior and exterior of great-walls as one family\\"), to convey this idea of \\"unification\\" of the different peoples.Dunnell 2004, pp. 76‚Äì77. A Manchu language version of a treaty with the Russian Empire concerning criminal jurisdiction over bandits called Qing subjects \\"people of the Central Kingdom (Dulimbai Gurun)\\".Cassel 2011, p. 205.Cassel 2012, p. 205.Cassel 2011, p. 44.Cassel 2012, p. 44. In the Manchu official Tulisen's Manchu language account of his meeting with the Torghut leader Ayuka Khan, it was mentioned that while the Torghuts were unlike the Russians, the \\"people of the Central Kingdom\\" (dulimba-i gurun ‰∏≠Âúã Zhongguo) were like the Torghuts, and the \\"people of the Central Kingdom\\" referred to the Manchus.Perdue 2009, p. 218. The rebellions led by Li Zicheng, Zhang Xianzhong, and the subsequent expansion by the Qing was one of the most devastating wars in Chinese history. Examples of the devastation include the Yangzhou massacre, in which some 800,000 people, (although this number is now considered an exaggeration)Struve, Lynn A., Voices from the Ming-Qing Cataclysm: China in Tigers' Jaws (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998), p. 269 including women and children, were massacred.Wang Shochu, Records of the Ten Day massacre in Yangzhou. Available in Chinese at Wikisource: ÊèöÂ∑ûÂçÅÊó•Ë®ò. The Qing carried out massacres in cities which resisted like Yangzhou and Guangzhou but did not carry out violence in cities which surrendered and capitulated to Qing rule like Beijing and Nanjing. Nanjing surrendered to the Qing without a violence as all officials surrendered and defected. Whole provinces, such as Sichuan, were thoroughly devastated and depopulated by the rebel Zhang Xianzhong. Zhang Xianzhong killed 600,000 to 6 million civilians. A massive famine in Shaanxi had spurred Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng to revolt and brutality by the rebels was widespread across northern China. Coastal China was devastated by the Qing coastal evacuation order. An estimated 25 million people died in the entire war. Some scholars estimate that the Chinese economy did not regain the level reached in the late Ming until 1750, a century after the foundation of the Qing dynasty. According to economic historian Robert Allen, family income in the Yangtze delta, China's richest province, was actually below Ming levels in 1820 (but equal to that of contemporary Britain). Immediately before the Ming dynasty was overthrown by Li Zicheng and the Qing entered Shanhai pass, disease, famine, starvation and bandits ravaged the population of China. A disease killed half of the population in cities across China from 1640‚Äì1642 and three out of ten people in Huzhou city died of plague and starvation. As the rural areas were hit by famine, peasants abandoned their homes by the millions, bandits took over Huguang, entire parts of the countryside were abandoned by peasants in the middle of China and theft and begging was widespread in cities by peasants looking for food and cannibalism spread all over famine hit Henan. in 1641 northern China was hit by disease and plague spreading to Huangpi and the plague infected corpses were the only food available to the survivors. A massive drought in 1636 hit Huangpi amidst a series of natural disasters. Plague, locusts and famine spread all over. The plains and villages were hit by bandits and rebels as starving refugees, orphans who lost parents to disease and fired postal couriers and soldiers whose salary was cut off turned into rebels in 1642 all over China. China's population growth led to devastating death tolls due to famine from cold weather, drought and floods. Soil and anything that was consumable was eaten by people in 1637 in Jiangxi in a massive famine. The massive disease epidemic devastated South Zhili (Jiangnan) from 1641‚Äì1642 hitting the region twice, leaving corpses from the disease all over Zhili and killing 9 out of 10 across northern Zhejiang after it spread there from the Grand Canal from northwestern China. Due to the loss in people, crops were not farmed further exacerbating the famine. The Yangtze river delta's urban regions, the coastal southeast and the northwest were all hit by massive famine as the grain producing regions lost productivity. Massive deflation blew up as silver bullion remained in Fujian and stopped grain and payments for famine relief from reaching famine victims. The rebellions broke out because of these famines. Famine hit Hangzhou from 1640‚Äì1642, killing 50 percent of the population, forcing the impoverished to eat cocoons and silkworms, and forcing the rich to eat rice gruel. In multiple counties only three out of ten survived when Henan was hit by the 1641 disease plague epidemic. Select groups of Han bannermen were mass transferred into Manchu Banners by the Qing, changing their ethnicity from Han to Manchu. Han bannermen of Tai Nikan Âè∞Â∞ºÂ†™ (watchpost Chinese) and Fusi Nikan ÊäöÈ°∫Â∞ºÂ†™ (Fushun Chinese) backgrounds into the Manchu banners in 1740 by order of the Qing Qianlong emperor. It was between 1618‚Äì1629 when the Han Chinese from Liaodong who later became the Fushun Nikan and Tai Nikan defected to the Jurchens (Manchus). These Han-origin Manchu clans continue to use their original Han surnames and are marked as of Han origin on Qing lists of Manchu clans. Accounts of atrocities during the transition from the Ming to Qing were used by revolutionaries in the anti-Qing Xinhai revolution to fuel massacres against Manchus. Manchu bannermen and their families were massacred in several banner garrisons across China during the revolution, one of the massacres taking place in Xi'an. The Hui Muslim community was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing. The local Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an (Shaanxi province) joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the entire 20,000 Manchu population of Xi'an. The native Hui Muslims of Gansu province led by general Ma Anliang sided with the Qing and prepared to attack the anti-Qing revolutionaries of Xi'an city. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims.

Early life  Cox Alomar was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 30 December 1974 to Noem√≠ Alomar Su√°rez and Rafael Cox Rosario. He graduated from Colegio San Ignacio in 1993 and Cornell University in 1997. He subsequently attended the University of Oxford (Trinity College) on a Marshall Scholarship, earning a D.Phil. in Modern History in 2001. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 2004.  Professional life  He practiced law in Washington, D.C., representing clients in their disputes before the World Bank's International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. He also practiced law in Puerto Rico with Reichard & Escalera, a local firm. He was a member of the board of directors of the Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n Foundation. Currently he is an Assistant Professor of Law at David A. Clarke School of Law at Washington, D.C.  Resident Commissioner campaign  On 26 October 2011, Alejandro Garc√≠a Padilla announced that Cox Alomar would be his running mate in the 2012 electionsfor Resident Commissioner. On accepting the nomination, he committed himself to reaffirming the values of the Commonwealth status, as well as promoting the creation of jobs, bringing attention to public safety, and broadening access to education and health services. He formally filed his candidacy on 30 October 2010. In May 2012, Cox Alomar became the subject of a scandal when a photograph comparing him to a chimpanzee with the words \\"R.I.P. Yuyo\\", was posted on the Twitter account belonging to Zaida R. Hern√°ndez Torres, a politician belonging to the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico. Human rights defenders criticized Hern√°ndez for the personal attack against Cox Alomar, who is of Afro-Puerto Rican ancestry, however, in statement she claimed her Twitter account was hacked and that she did not post the offensive image. She later apologized to Cox Alomar and terminated her Twitter account, promising to avoid social networks. Incumbent Resident Representative Pedro Pierluisi won re-election on November 6, 2012 by a 1.28% margin, with 48.44% of the vote, while Cox Alomar placed second with 47.16%.http://div1.ceepur.org/REYDI_Escrutinio/index.html#es/default/COMISIONADO_RESIDENTE_ISLA.xml After his defeat, the elected Mayor of San Juan contracted Cox Alomar as Advisor of Federal Affairs for the city.  Political views  When named as candidate for Resident Commissioner, Cox Alomar avoided describing the Commonwealth status of Puerto Rico as colonial. He has come out against the New Progressive Party's two-stage status referendum, calling it divisive. However, on August 9, 2013, Cox Alomar identified himself with the soberanistas, the PPD's wing that support the creation of a project known as ELA Soberano, a hybrid between a free association compact and elements of the Commonwealth such as the American citizenship and a common coin. When asked to explain the sudden change in relation to the political status, he noted that in order to avoid the promotion of a message that conflicted with Garc√≠a Padilla's support of the territorial commonwealth, the 2012 campaign was targeted at attacking the referendum's credibility.  Personal life  Cox Alomar is married to Hilda Rodr√≠guez. He is related to former MLB baseball players Sandy Alomar, Sr., Roberto Alomar, and Sandy Alomar, Jr..

Early life  Ilaram was born the eldest of five surviving children in an ethnic Kaivartta community/tribe in a small village called Jaluguti of undivided Nagaon District(now Morigaon District) in the state of Assam of parents Kaliram Das and Khopadoi Das on 23 December 1929. Ilaram had the opportunity to nurture his childhood by elixir of Vaishnava Ideology of harmonious living. Das was the first student of Jaluguti area to pass the Matriculation Examination in 1945. In 1947,he passed I.A Examination from Nagaon College. While still pursuing his graduate studies, Shri Das witnessed a few extremely shocking incidents, which played a catalysing role in his decision to foray into the field of socio religious reform. One such particularly shocking incident was perpetrated in 1947 during Phalgutshav or Holi celebrations. It was in Batadrawa, the holy seat of Srimanta Sankardeva‚Äôs immanence where people of all strata and belonging to all tribes, castes and creeds did not really enjoy the rights of entry. In the huge gathering for the Phalgotshav, three persons belonging to the Scheduled Caste Kaivartta community (originally an aboriginal tribe which was slowly converted into a caste like various other Indigenous Assamese communities by Sanskritisation) from the villages of Raidongia and Kobaikata of Nagaon district went up to pray in front of the guru asana. A few persons from the upper classes, on learning that they were Kaivarttas kept them kneeling down and humiliated them by shoving cow dung in their mouth. This left an indelible mark on the college going Ilaram, who had gone there to enjoy the Dol festival. This prompted Ilaram to take up the issue of casteism and racism. Did not all men belong to the same god? The scriptures claim that the soul resided in all life forms without discrimination. Does the faith preached by Mahapurush Sankardev accommodate such segregations? Such questions left Ilaram deeply worried. It was then that a few members of his community approached their vanguard student Ilaram and told him that his college education had no value, as he would face the same fate as they if he dared go up to the guru asana to pray. Immediately after this Ilaram Das organised a mammoth rally of over one thousand members of his community, other backward classes and tribes to protest against such attempts to tain the religious ideals of guru Sankara, Consequently, a large religious meet was held under the presidency of Sahitya Ratna Harinarayan Duttabaruah and in the presence of a few satradhikars. Harinarayan Duttabaruah took the initiative in passing a resolution to open the doors of the Batadrawa thaan(seat) for all to pray. The satradhikars regretted the incident and apologised to the people. After completing his studies Ilaram Das took up the post of teacher in the Jaluguti High School. He was successful as a teacher and was popular among his students. He, however, did not adjure social reforms and politics. The political ideals of Mahatma Gandhi fascinated him and led him to take an active part in the struggle for independence even as a student. As he was an influential, conscious and educated young man from a Scheduled Caste community he easily came close to such stalwarts as Tyagbeer Hem Baruah, Deva kanta Baruah, Mahendra Mohan Choudhury and others of the then most influential party, the Indian National Congress. Despite invitations from them to contest in the elections for the Legislative Assembly, Sri Das adhered to the ideals of Srimanta Sankardeva and dedicated himself to spreading his ideals and gave up active politics.  Religious Life  Ilaram Das was formally initiated into the Ek Xorown Naam Dhormow by Nandiram Ata, who was a redoubtable preacher of the Paalnam Samaj in the Nagaon district. He then immersed himself in the relentless pursuit of the intricacies of the religious philosophy of Mahapurush Sankardeva for fourteen years. His command over the tenets and concepts of Sankardeva's philosophy and his easy elucidation and fascinating oratory, and remarkable organizational skills were primarily instrumental in giving an extra cosmopolitan dimension to the Samaj and in making it significantly broad based. Thousands of people were attracted to this Paalnam Samaj by his wonderful rendering of *borgeets, *ghosha and *lesaries and his profoundly conceptual yet accessible discourses and orations. Ilaram Das took up the responsibility of General Secretaryship of some fourteen primary units of the Nagaon District Paalnam Samaj and joined Assam Srimanta Sankardeva Sangha in 1950. It is for the Assam Srimanta Sankardeva Sangha that he toured the length and breadth of Assam and embraced thousands of members to its fold with his erudite and lucid discourses. He became the State Organiser, member of the Sharan (initiation) Committee, and was the Sangha‚Äôs Upa-Padadhikar for two consecutive two-year terms from 1968. Ilaram Das played a leading role in the establishment of the Adhyatmic Sadhanmarg, or the path of spiritual attainment. He was close to and had earned the confidence of the founder of the Nagaon Sankar Mission, Lokasevak Haladhar Bhuyan and Ramakanta Muktiar Ata. Ilaram Das established ‚ÄúEk Xarownn Bhagowoti Xomaj, Assam‚Äù another social and cultural religious organisation on December 7, 1973. Celestial songs composed by Srimanta Sankardeva.  Ek Xarown Bhagowoti Xomaj  While Das was serving Assam Srimanta Sankardeva Sangha as a core Member, difference of interpretation with regard to Dhula Mala and Palnam cropped up between him and the Sangha members. With tears he had to part with the Assam Srimanta Sankardeva Sangha and embarked on the field to sail across the turbulent river with Ek Xorown Nam Dharma under the grab of Ek Xorownn Bhagowoti Xomaj, Assam. Here he was famously known as Baap-Iswar amongst his disciples. Sankardeva had formed a wholesome community of believers by embracing into his fold-Nagas, Karbis, Muslims, Bhots, Keots/Kaibartas, Kacharis and all other indigenous Assamese communities. This society disintegrated as time passed but Ilaram Das had devoted his life to enrich and continue this comprehensive community based on liberal ideas of tolerance, mutual respect, and harmony. The Ek-Xorown Bhagowoti Xomaj, he founded, is a meeting ground of Koches, Kaivartas/Keots, Kacharis, Bodos, Rabhas, Brahmins, Misings, Karbis, Kalitas, Heeras, Banias, Tea garden workers, Ahoms, Chutias, Kayasthas, Tiwas(Lalung) and other indigenous Assamese communities. The District and state Palnaams, conferences and Astra Prahar Palnaam Mohatsov of the Ek Xarown Bhagowoti Xomaj bear testimony to this. Through him those who are initiated to the Mahapurishia faith and seek shelter they automatically lose the different barriers of caste, creed or community. As a founder of Ek Xorown Bhagowoti Xamaj, Acharyya Ilaram Das has delivered, in the course of his preaching throughout Assam, some 5 (five) thousand speeches which were lucid yet addressed theoretical and conceptual concerns. In these meetings and through them he met many social workers, intellectuals, artists and political leaders; some significant names are listed below: Mahamanab Mahatma Gandhi, Deba Kanta Barua, Tyagbeer Hem Barua, Ex-Chief Minister Mahendra Mohan Choudhury, Sarat Chandra Sinha, Hiteshwar Saikia, Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, Loksevak Haladhar Bhuyan, Dr. Maheswar Neog, Nava Kanta Barua, Dr. Ram Charan Thakuria, Sarvodoya leaders Acharyya Vinobha Bhave, Amal Prabha Das, Ex-Prime Minister of India Indira Gandhi,Bipin Pal Das, Bijay Ch. Bhagawati, Ex-president of India Fakharuddin Ali Ahmed, Swami Bijoyanada Maharaj of Bharat Sevashram Sangha, Dr. Indira Miri, Dr. Pramod Bhattacharjee, Paragdhar Chaliha, Miss Queensee Haily (London), Kalaguru Bishnu Rabha, Kishori Mohan Pathak, etc. He had also come in close contact with many other distinguished persons over and above the names mentioned above.  Social Reform  Acharyya Ilaram Das, both through the Srimanta Sankardev Sangha and the Ek Saran Bhagawati Samaj had made immense contributions towards social reform, especially amongst the scheduled caste/tribes and other backward classes and made them aware of their rights and responsibilities. The meets and discourses he organised brought about consciousness of harmony among them. Moves against intoxicants and Aberrant: Alcohol, grass gambling and such social aberrant had taken deep roots in the backward classes. His endeavor was to wean them away from these evils and to accept them back into the fold of the Mahapurushia path. He had helped the government‚Äôs moves for prohibition in diverse effective ways. = Eradication of Untouchability = He was successful in helping the common masses imbibe the spirit of Sankardeva‚Äôs ideal of harmony and amity through religious meetings, namkirtan, cultural functions, inter-caste/inter-tribe marriages, community feasts etc. These helped them eradicate evils like untouchability and bring about communal harmony and unity. Inter-caste marriage in the Ek Xarown Bhagowoti Xomaj, marriage between different classes, castes and ethnic communities have become a routine affair. These not only helped bring about harmony and unity among the people but also translated Gandhiji‚Äôs dreams of a free and equal society into a reality.  Reforms among ethnic groups & Tea estate workers  During 1979‚Äì80 Acharyya Ilaram Das, through various meetings and discussions, managed to bring the various ethnic groups, especially the Kaibarta/Keots, Bodos and the Rabhas back into the fold of the Society and culture established by Sankardeva, by weaning them away from the grasp of alien ways and faiths, especially in Habigaon, Borigaon Doamakha, Batabari, Ambagaon and adjoining areas. The Acharyya was also physically assaulted and his life was in serious danger. He not only brought the Mising community in Rawanmukh and Galsepa in Lakhimpur district, Kalabari in Biswanath, Malapindha and Kathalguri in Majuli, Mahuramukh, Bankowal and other places in Golaghat district, back into the ways of Sankardeva but had also taken the initiative to build Naamghars there to give them the right place and ambience to congregate. This was also done among the tea-estate workers community in Kandali, Sagunbahi, Sapanala, Gariabari, Kathiatoli in Nagaon district, Rajabari, Letekujan, Borsapori in Golaghat district, Hatigarh in Mangaldoi district, Dafalating, Bajalkata, Sapekhati, in Jorhat district, and Nelly Gopalkrishna tea estate in Morigaon district. Through his relentless endeavors the people of the above categories learnt the way of living in Aryan style. Reform activities in Mikir hills (Karbi Anglong) In 1955 he resigned from teacher at Jaluguti High School to join in a community Welfare Center at Auguri (Ram Bangla), which was established under the auspices of Srimanta Sankar Mission. He became superintendent of the center and also Head Master of an English Middle School. To impart value based education and to develop health consciousness among the tribal people of the hill district the following institutions were established: A unit of Hospital One M.E. School One Primary School One Handloom Center One Hospital for the leprosy patients He had successfully served the backward people for a period of 3 years. He reached out to the major section of the backward society to motivate them to gear-up education, Health service and livelihood etc. for their young generation and he succeeded in this mission to a great extent. He could not resist the clarion call given by Mahapurusha Srimanta Sankar to serve the society wholeheartedly and to lead the poorest of the poor and the downtrodden to a higher position in the society. Finally, he had chosen the path of a lifetime social reformer cultural activist and an organizer of Srimanta Sankardev Sangha, a social, cultural & religious organisation of Assam. = Women‚Äôs education = The Acharyya was a staunch believer in the emancipation of women and true to the culture of the area looked up to the mother. It was, his way of spiritually empowering our women folk, especially those of the backward classes. He knew the imperatives of women‚Äôs education and the significant role emancipated women could play in society. It was through his persistent efforts that the Jaluguti Girls Academy High School was established at his birthplace in Jaluguti. He had throughout been helping poor students with books, uniforms, tuition fees and accessories. He had also established the Sati Radhika Santi Matri Sewa Samaj, a women‚Äôs organisation to impart spiritual education as supplement to modern education so that the women folk would prepare themselves for the correct motherhood. = Moves for national unity and communal harmony = He had always endeavored to instill in people the imperatives of self-sacrifice in order to fight the divisive forces. This, he believed, was most effective at preserving national unity and communal harmony. In 1983 the district of Morigaon was severely affected by communal violence. The incidents at Nelly are a case in point. His birthplace at Jaluguti is a traditional seat of communal harmony where Hindus and Muslims had always been living in harmony, but even this place was threatened by communal discord, and was primarily through his efforts that harmony was maintained. Even during the language movement of 1972, he had helped maintain peace in this region through peace committees, which he established and ran. He was the president of all peace committees mentioned above. = Promotion of weaving = While spreading the message of Sankardeva in the areas bordering the district Dhubri, area like Jinkata, Chhatrasal, Simlabari, he had noticed the women taking to poor clothing. Acharyya Das was quick to notice it and arranged looms for the weavers of the region and had them trained through experts with the help of the Khadi and Gramudyog Board. Even now he is looked up to in the Jinkata and Chhatrasal areas. = Social forestry = Acharyya Ilaram Das has, from early in life, been planting trees at all socio-cultural rituals (births, weddings, palnaam Meets, District Conferences) armed with the belief that a tree was equal to ten sons (ek brikasa dasa putra sama). He with his unique creation the Sadou Assam Tarun Vidyarthy Samaj had been translating these ideas into reality in wider perspective. He catalogues and analyzes his salient ideas on tree plantation in the 13th ‚ÄòObjective‚Äô of his book ‚ÄòAims and Objectives‚Äô written for youth. He has been helping the state in its Social forestry program.  Participation in the Sarvodaya Movement  Ilaram Das was associated with Binova Bhave's Sarvodaya movement. He helped distinguished workers, Amol Probha Das & Shankuntala Choudhury sent to spread the Bhoodan and Gramdan Projects. There were also exchanges on the ideas of Sankardeva with the well-known workers. Shrimati Shankuntala Choudhury had written about these in the mouthpiece of the Bhoodan movement ‚ÄòMaitree‚Äô. = Welfare of Jaluguti = The Jaluguti Area: His contributions towards the economic and social development of the Jaluguti region is immense. He had offered his services as the president of the governing body of the Jaluguti High School he had studied in. He was instrumental in making it a higher secondary school and in making it a centre for the Matriculation examination. He was responsible for the establishment of the Jaluguti State Dispensary, and the Jaluguti Girls High School and he had also served as the founder president of the Jaluguti Anchalic College. It was at his initiative that the mass electric irrigation project began in the area when Sarat Chandra Sinha was the Chief Minister of the state. = Equality of all religions = Mahapurush Sankardeva had called the people never to think ill of other faiths (Anora dharmaka nihingsiba kadasit). Following this ideal he participated with zeal in the religious occasions of other communities and had often been the appointed speaker at Fateha Dwaz Daham and other celebrations and called for religious tolerance and co-operation. Over and above these, in the statewide conference of the Ek Saran Bhagawati Samaj, Sikh, Muslim, Christian, and Gauriya Panthi religious teachers and preachers were invited. This adequately illustrates his liberal religious views.  Cultural resurgence  Acharyya Das, at his own initiative, established a moving cultural troupe with a view to spreading and diffusing the songs, borgeets, dances, and plays of Sankardeva. This troupe not only performed in different places of Assam but helped train the people in the culture. He himself used to play role in the Ankia Naats. These became popular and the people came to the ways of the guru through participation in community festivals. At his birthplace in Jaluguti, he edited the Rasa Naat in the Bhagawata pada Rhythm and started the Rasa festivities in true Mahapurushia style. This continues as an annual affair till now. He had also established various thaans and cultural centres as he toured the local participation. They also helped decentralize the activities. He had also established district-wide Sadhan or spiritual centres, along with cultural centres. In the main centres, he himself established the Simhasana, Bhagawata, and Namghar for cultural activities.  Principal Thaans and cultural centres  * * Astraprahar Palnaam Thaan, Jaluguti, Morigaon * Bebejia Palnaam thaan and Krstikendra, Nagaon * Rangbang Nandapur Palnaam thaan and Sankar-Madhab Krishti Sadhan Kendra, Kanaighat,Numaligarh,Golaghat. * Jinkata Nasatra, Dhubri. * Dangaigaon Nasatra, Bongaigaon. * Bijini Satra, Bongaigaon * Naamdharma Prasar and Krishti Charcha Kendra, Udalguri, District Darrang. * Na-nadi Bhakatgaon Palnaam thaan and Krishti Kendra District Dhemaji. * Palnaam thaan, Purani Pukhuri Par (Athaisagar), (under construction) District Sibsagar. * Majuli district palnaam thaan and Krishti Charcha Kendra, Silakala, Majuli. * Morigaon Central Naamghar and Krishti Kendra. * Naamghar and Krishti Bikash Kendra, Jagiroad, Morigaon (under construction) * District Namghar and Krishti Bikash Kendra, Guwahati. * Harmoti Milan Satra and Krishti Bikash Kendra, Harmoti, Lakhimpur. * Mangaldai District Palnaam thaan and Sankari Krishti Bikash Kendra Kathpori, Mangaldoi. * Adi Bhakatgaon Harimandir and Krishti Sadhan Kendra, Merapani Gamariguri, Golaghat. * Sankari Krishti Bikash Kendra and Palnaam thaan, North Guwahati. * Naamghar and Sankari Krishti Bikash Kendra, Uzan Bazar, Guwahati. * Anchalik Naamghar and Sankari Krishti Bikash Kendra, Kukurmara, Kamrup. * Krishna Naamghar Sankari Krishti Bikash Kendra, Kahilipara, Guwahati. * Nanoi Poriya Paal Nam Than .Pathorighat, Sipajhar, Darrang The above spiritual and cultural centres are turned to Acharya Ilaram Das‚Äôs inspiring ideas on spirituality and culture, which had a deep impact on the popular psyche.  The Role of Acharyya Ilaram Das in the development of Batadrawa Thaan  The present Batadrawa Thaan was once divided into the Borfal and Sorufal branch and the small Kirtan Ghar and the dormitory of the bhakats or devotees were in a sad state. He sought the help and intervention of Lokasevak Haladhar Bhuyan, the founder of the Nagaon Sankar Mission and the then Revenue Minister of Assam, Motiram Bora and their efforts resulted in the present united Batadrawa Thaan, which is large and well appointed. In the inaugural function, presided over by the former Chief Minister of Assam, Bishnu Ram Medhi, Acharyya Ilaram Das kept the audience enthralled with his erudite and lucid talk.  Literary contribution  Acharyya Ilaram Das is an orator and litt√©rateur. He had delivered more than five thousand lectures all over Assam on the religious, spiritual, social, cultural, and literary views and ideals of Sankardeva. Moves are a foot to bring out an audio cassette of the available transcripts. His discourses on diverse topics automatically take on literary value. His book on Mahapurush Madhabdeva‚Äôs Naamghosa, entitled Naamghosa Rasamrit is the most well known. Enriched with elaborate conceptual analysis, this is not simply a commentary on the Naamghosa but presents the wholeness of the religious philosophy of Sankardeva lucidly and comprehensively. His erudite pieces continue to appear in various journals. He is the author of the following books:  Books  * Naamghosa Rasamrit * Mahapurush Dharma and Karmakanda (with Monoranjan Das of Borpeta) * Yuva Samaj, Tarun Vidyarthi Samajar Lakshya Aru Uddeshya * Palnaam Tatwa. * Nitya Prasangar Arhi. * Mahapurushia Bibah Pronali * Yuba Samajar Parthana Pustika * \\"Biswajyoti\\" (A Monthly Journal of the Samaj)  Sodou Assam Tarun Vidyarthy Samaj  Based on the ideas of Sankardeva he founded the above \\"Society\\" on the ideas of Sankardeva to remove the increasing lack of direction in the youth of the state in 1979, for their moral and spiritual benefit. He knew that the growing lack of moral concern among the youth and their partiality to drugs and intoxicants must be checked before they harm the entire society. He therefore endeavoured to edify them. This, he believed, would keep them on from despair leading to unrest and extremism. Morally and spiritually armed, they would be on and lead others down the right path. Sankardeva always dreamt about undivided Great India (Bharat Varsha). Sankardeva always discouraged the emergence of separatism in various corners of today‚Äôs India. Keeping this in view, Acharyya Das inspired the youth to avoid taking up arms and law and order in their hand but to serve the Greater India for its integration, prosperity and secularism.

He finished his 2013 season batting .321/.357/.531 in 107 games with 15 home runs, 86 RBIs, and 25 walks. =New York Mets= 2013 New York Mets in 2013 He obtained a promotion to the Mets' major league roster on August 6, the day of his 22nd birthday. Pitcher Bobby Parnell was placed on the disabled list with a herniated disk in his neck to make room for Flores on the roster. He made his debut that day against the Colorado Rockies at Citi Field going 0-for-4 at the plate and committing an error in the sixth inning in what would be a 3‚Äì2 Mets win. On August 7, he notched his first career major league hit, a single in the bottom of the second inning off Rockies pitcher Jhoulys Chac√≠n. In the bottom of the eight inning, with bases loaded, he hit a base clearing double off pitcher Manny Corpas for his first three major league RBIs. The Mets would go on to win 5‚Äì0. On August 11, he hit his first career home run, a solo home run to right field off Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Heath Bell in the top of the ninth inning to extend the Mets lead to 9‚Äì5 by which the Mets won. He finished the 2013 season appearing in 27 games with a batting average of .211 in 95 at- bats in 101 plate appearances while compiling 20 hits, 13 RBIs, 1 home run, 5 walks, 8 runs scored, and striking out 23 times. 2014 Flores started the 2014 season with the Las Vegas 51s in AAA, but was called up April 2 along with Kyle Farnsworth in order to replace Bobby Parnell going to the disabled list and with Daniel Murphy on paternity leave. He would be re-sent back to the 51s on April 6 to make room for Jon Niese coming off the disabled list. Flores had only started one game at second base going 0-for-4 with two strikeouts. He was recalled on May 9 with Omar Quintanilla being designated for assignment. On June 2, Flores drove in a career high 6 RBIs during which he also hit his first career grand slam against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park. The grand slam came in the top of the ninth inning off pitcher Phillippe Aumont with two outs extending the lead 11‚Äì2 to which the Mets won to. On June 26, Flores was once again re-sent down to the 51s to make room for Juan Lagares coming off the disabled list. He was recalled for good on July 24 with Kirk Nieuwenhuis being sent to the 51s. Flores finished the 2014 season appearing in 78 games with a batting average of .251 in 259 at- bats in 274 plate appearances while compiling 65 hits, 29 RBIs, 6 home runs, 12 walks, 28 runs scored and striking out 31 times. 2015 Flores made the Mets' roster for Opening Day in 2015. During the first week of the season, Flores struggled offensively and defensively as he made three errors and batted .158 in seven games. In nine games after the opening week, Flores batted .364 with three home runs. Soon thereafter, Flores was tied for third in all of baseball in errors committed with six. On May 16, Flores became the first National League position player to hit a grand slam batting ninth in a National League ballpark. The home run came off Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Matt Garza at Citi Field. The home run was his second career grand slam. On May 26, Flores at the time was tied for most home runs hit by a shortstop with Jhonny Peralta of the St. Louis Cardinals with seven. That same day, Flores hit his first career walk-off, a single, off Phillies' pitcher Elvis Ara√∫jo in the bottom of the tenth inning with two outs scoring Juan Lagares for his second RBI of the game. Flores sliding in a run against the Baltimore Orioles on August 18, 2015. On July 29, rumors spread during a game against the San Diego Padres that Flores had been traded to the Milwaukee Brewers, along with pitcher Zack Wheeler, for Carlos G√≥mez. Despite the rumors, Flores remained in the game, and was visibly emotional when he returned to the field as fans began to give him a standing ovation. Flores later explained his disappointment in learning that he would be leaving the only baseball organization he has ever known. However, following the game, General Manager Sandy Alderson informed the media that no trade had occurred, stating that \\"social media got ahead of the facts.\\" After the game, Mets' manager Terry Collins told the media that he knew nothing about the potential trade and had told Flores while the events played out, \\"Listen, I don't know what's going on, but you've got a game to play, let's play baseball.\\" It was later reported that the Mets backed out of the trade after a concern about G√≥mez's physical as a medical report showed an issue with his hip. Two days later, on July 31, Flores hit his first career walk-off home run, a solo home run, off Washington Nationals pitcher Felipe Rivero. It occurred in the bottom of the 12th inning, on a 1‚Äì1 count with no outs, winning an important game for the Mets by a score of 2‚Äì1. As Flores approached home plate finishing his circle around the bases, he memorably tugged enthusiastically at the \\"Mets\\" logo on his uniform front, signifying how happy he was to have remained with the team. Flores had also driven in the other Mets' run earlier in the game. During each at-bat, Flores received a standing ovation from the Mets' fans. The win brought the Mets within two games of first place in the NL East. After the incident, Flores became a fan-favorite of Mets fans and was given standing ovations in the subsequent weeks, both at home and at away games. It was also the only walk- off home run the Mets hit during the 2015 season. At this point on August 25, since the failed trade, he hit .343 with a .993 OPS and four home runs. The Mets went 16‚Äì6 after that day. Flores finished the 2015 season appearing in 137 games with a batting average of .263 in 483 at-bats in 510 plate appearances while compiling 127 hits, 16 home runs, 59 RBIs, 55 runs scored, 19 walks, and striking out 63 times. In the NLDS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Flores hit .300 in four games compiling 3 hits, 1 double, 2 walks, 2 runs scored, and striking out 4 times. Then, playing against the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS, he batted .286 in four games compiling 4 hits, 1 double, 1 triple, 1 walk, 1 stolen base, and striking out 2 times. During the series against the Dodgers, Mets' shortstop Ruben Tejada was injured by the Dodgers' Chase Utley. The injury occurred with a controversial slide, thought dirty by many, and resulted in a broken leg for Tejada. Flores played shortstop for the remainder of the postseason. Once he moved to the more important defensive position, Flores played fine defense, but struggled hitting. He was the last out of the World Series, striking out looking in game five against Kansas City Royals closer Wade Davis, to clinch the series for the Royals. Flores appeared in all five games, batting .059 with 1 hit, 2 runs scored, 2 walks, and 3 strikeouts. In December, Flores suffered a broken left ankle after being hit by a pitch in winter ball in Venezuela. 2016 Flores during spring training in 2016 On May 12, Flores was put on the 15-day disabled list with a left hamstring injury with his spot on the roster being replaced by Sean Gilmartin. Flores was batting .180 with one home run and two RBIs in 50 at- bats this season playing at first, second and third base filling in as a defensive replacement for Lucas Duda, Neil Walker and David Wright respectively. Flores was activated from the DL on May 29 with Matt Reynolds being sent down to make room for him on the roster. In five rehab games with the Binghamton Mets, Flores had batted .235 with one RBI and four hits. On July 3, in a home game against the Cubs, Flores became only the second Mets player to collect six hits in a game, the first being fellow Venezuelan infielder Edgardo Alfonzo, who did so in August 1999. In doing so, he raised his batting average 31 points from .224 to .255. He became the first player in Major League Baseball to accomplish the feat since C.J. Cron the day earlier and the first player in the National League to do so since Charlie Blackmon on April 4, 2014. On September 10, Flores injured his wrist in a collision at home plate with Atlanta Braves catcher A. J. Pierzynski. On September 30, the Mets announced that Flores would miss the rest of the year, including the postseason. On October 7, Flores underwent surgery to have part of the hamate bone in his wrist removed. 2017 On April 21, the Mets placed Flores on the 10-day disabled list with an infection in his knee which required hospitalization and IV treatment. Flores broke his nose on a foul-tip in the second game of a double-header against the Houston Astros on September 2, which ended his season. For his 2017 campaign, Flores finished with a .271 batting average, 18 home runs and 52 runs batted in in 336 at-bats. 2018 On April 15, 2018, Flores hit a walk-off home run to give the Mets a win against the Brewers. This was his third career walk-off home run. On June 26, Flores drove in the winning run against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the bottom of the 10th inning, giving the Mets a 4‚Äì3 victory. Earlier in the game, he had driven in the Mets' first two runs as well. Flores's game winner was his 9th walk-off RBI of his young career. He tied David Wright for the most walk-off RBIs in Mets' history. On July 9, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Philadelphia Phillies, Flores hit a pinch-hit walk- off home run, breaking Wright's record for the most walk-off RBI of any player in Mets franchise history. In 2018 he batted .267/.319/.417. =Arizona Diamondbacks= On January 21, 2019, Flores signed a one-year, $4.25 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks. He played in 89 games for the Diamondbacks in 2019, hitting .317/.361/.487 with 9 home runs and 37 RBIs in 265 at bats. =San Francisco Giants= On February 4, 2020, Flores signed a two-year, $6 million contract including a third-year option with the San Francisco Giants.

Prices are determined by the regional autorit√© organisatrice de transports (\\"Regional Transport Organisational Authority\\"), which for √éle-de-France is √éle-de-France Mobilit√©s.  History  In 1900, a second-class Paris M√©tro ticket cost 15 centimes of the old franc, and a first-class ticket 25 centimes. In 1960, it cost 37 centimes of the new franc.In January 1960 the French franc was rebased so that 1 new franc equalled 100 old francs. Six hundred million M√©tro tickets were sold that year, an average of around a minute.

These concentric zones, numbered 1 to 8 (until 1 July 2007), are centred on Paris, with zone 1, the most central, covering the commune of Paris, zone 2 surrounding it, and so on. Zone 8 is the most distant from the centre, and was only used in the south-east of the √éle-de-France. On 1 July 2007 the zones were reduced to six, with zones 7 and 8 being absorbed into zone 6. At its board meeting of 8 December 2010, the STIF voted to remove Zone 6, absorbing it into zone 5 from 1 July 2011. = Towards a flat fare = The reduction in the number of fare zones is a preamble to a potential flat rate fare from June 2012, a manifesto commitment following negotiations between the Socialists and Green parties during the 2010 regional elections. However, a fare of , announced by the Greens during their campaign, would have the STIF lose , which cannot be done while continuing with necessary infrastructure investment. The STIF thus suggested possible fares of or , which would balance the books. But according to a study by the think-tank Mentras, published in January 2011, although ticket-holders for zones 1-5 and 1-6Zone 6 was folded into zone 5 on 1 July 2011, after this study was published. would see their travel costs reduce, a flat fare would harshly hit season ticket holders in Paris and its inner suburbs, and even in the outer suburbs would suffer, as well as others who use a two-zone ticket. On 11 February 2015, the STIF voted the creation of the Navigo \\"all zones\\", available from 1 September 2015 for a price of weekly, monthly, yearly. Navigo for zones 2-3, 3-4 and 4-5 will remain available at their current price. The fare structure of day passes (Mobilis, Paris visite, ticket jeunes) remains unchanged.STIF Press release, 11 February 2015 = Implementation = Inclusive tickets (daily, weekly and monthly) are valid for a given set of zones, and may be used on all modes of transport within them. For example, a passenger having a ticket for zones 2 to 4 can travel freely within those zones, but must purchase a separate ticket covering the portion of any journey that goes outside these zones, for example into zone 1 or zone 5. The extra ticket can be loaded onto the Navigo card as well. However, tickets valid for a month or longer can be used in any zone on weekends and public holidays without additional payment. Paper tickets (with magnetic strips) must be validated by inserting them into a machine whereby a date and time is punched onto the strip. Some tickets have limited validity thereafter, so that a journey must be completed within a certain time after validation. Navigo passes are contactless smart cards and are validated by presenting them near to an RFID reader. Fines are issued for those travelling without a valid ticket. Over six million paper tickets are sold each week, an average of a minute. Each ticket weighs .  Demagnetisation  According to the RATP, ticket demagnetisation affects 0.5% of tickets sold. Such tickets can be exchanged free of charge at a point of sale. Even with the small failure rate, this figure means at least tickets are exchanged just by the RATP. To reduce this figure, the RATP has started issuing newer, stronger tickets with a better-protected magnetic strip, replacing the magnetic tape with iron bands. This ticket will come into general use by the end of 2011.  Ticket types  Navigo validator in buses and trams The STIF sells several kinds of ticket. Single tickets are intended for occasional passengers. Combination and season tickets are aimed at regular travellers and those touring the region, and can be bought for various periods of validity. = Single tickets = For occasional journeys, tickets for one journey may be purchased singly or, slightly more cheaply, in booklets (\\"\\") of ten. The carnets of 10 are usually the best option for tourists as well. As one only takes the Metro 3-4 times a day, the combined price of carnet tickets at ‚Ç¨1.45 per ticket is much lower than day passes (‚Ç¨7.30). They can also easily be used among groups as they are transferable.  Ticket \\"t+\\"  Ticket \\"t+\\" (above: obverse; below: reverse) The Ticket \\"t+\\" is the most basic ticket in the √éle-de-France. It is a paper ticket that allows one journey on the M√©tro, the tramways, the bus network and services run by Optile, a conglomerate of suburban bus operators. As of August 2016 it costs or in a of 10 for , with children and other entitled users paying half-price for a carnet and can be used on several modes of transport, with one or more surface interchanges. The time from the first validation of the ticket to the last must not exceed 90 minutes. However, it cannot be used to interchange between a M√©tro or RER line and the bus or tramway, nor between a M√©tro line and the Montmartre funicular. √éle-de-France ticket The (\\"√éle-de-France ticket\\"), sometimes called the , is a paper ticket that allows for a point-to-point journey between two stations in the √éle-de-France region served by either suburban Transilien or RER trains. The fare depends on the distance travelled. It can be used in either direction between origin and destination, and allows the use of the Noctilien night bus network run by Transilien SNCF. The fare depends on the origin, destination and route and there are two fares: full fare or reduced fare. One can buy a single ticket or a of ten, at a reduction of 20% on the single ticket price. There is no limit to how far in advance a ticket can be purchased before being validated, but once validated they are valid for 2 hours only. =Combination and season tickets = Navigo An old monthly carte orange ticket, with magnetic strip Navigo is a smartcard on which season tickets valid for a week, a month, or a year may be loaded. Weekly tickets are valid from Mondays to Sundays. They are sold from the Friday of the week before. Monthly tickets are valid from the first to the last day of the calendar month. They are sold from the 20th day of the previous month. Annual tickets are sold for 12 calendar months. On purchase, a combination of two adjacent zones or all five zones must be chosen. For a journey to be valid the ticket must include all zones from the origin to the destination, including all zones passed through (even if no interchange is made there), although on weekends monthly and annual tickets may be used as though they covered all five zones. The ticket can be used for any number of journeys on any form of public transport in the region. Prior to 2009, carte orange with accompanying magnetic tickets were sold for this purpose. Navigo cards may also load 1-day tickets (similar to Mobilis) for any combination of two, three, four, or five zones, or 10 single journeys equivalent to t+ tickets.  Carte Int√©grale  La Carte Int√©grale is a yearly (renewable) season ticket. For year-round travellers, it provides a saving of about 2 months compared to the monthly Carte orange. Note: The website automatically detects the browser language. Some information is not available in the English version. Once the ticket is purchased at an RATP or SNCF office, it is valid as long as the purchaser renews it each month. The ticket comes with an \\"Advantage card\\" which allows discounts at major retailers. The ticket is only available on a Navigo pass. During 2011 the Carte Int√©grale will change its name to the \\"Yearly Navigo\\" ().  Carte Imagine'R  The Carte Imagine'R is a ticket for students between 12 and 25 years of age. Valid for a year, it can be used on all modes of public transport in the region. Mondays to Fridays it can be used only in the zones assigned to the ticket, but at weekends and during public and school holidays the zones are relaxed and it can be used throughout the region. It also acts as a discount card in many large retailers and at other attractions. Mobilis thumbMobilis Paris, 1 Zone Mobilis is an all-day ticket comprising a number of zones (1-2, 1-3, 1-4 and 1-5) with unlimited travel within them. It does not allow travel to Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport or Paris-Orly Airport, for which a Paris Visite ticket or a separate airport ticket is required (Charles de Gaulle Airport is in zone 5). The Mobilis ticket is issued as a paper ticket indicating the zones for which it is valid. It is not transferable, and to validate them passengers must write their full names on the tickets before using them, together with the date. Ticket Jeunes The Ticket Jeunes (\\"Young Persons Ticket\\") was an all-day discount ticket for those under 26 years of age. It can be used only on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays, within the zones indicated on the ticket: 1-3, 1-5, or 3-5\\\\. It allows unlimited travel within the ticketed zones, on the bus, M√©tro, tramway, RER and main-line train, except for the Orlyval, Orlybus, Jetbus, Roissybus and access to Charles de Gaulle Airport via RER B, Allobus, routes operated by Air France, tourist buses and the Vogu√©o. Tickets including zone 1 can be used throughout the M√©tro, even those parts outside zone 1. It was issued as a paper ticket with a magnetic stripe, on which must be written the passenger's full name and the date of use. It is about half the price of a Mobilis ticket covering the same area. The Ticket Jeunes was withdrawn from sale on 20 December 2019. Paris Visite thumbParis Visite 3 day ticket, 3 zones, 2017 The Paris Visite is an all-day ticket with four periods of validity: one, two, three or five consecutive days. It allows unlimited travel within the chosen zones (1-3 or 1-5) on all modes of transport - except the Jetbus network, the Fil√©o at Charles de Gaulle Airport, tourist buses, and Air France services - and allows travel to Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports. The traveller's name and the date(s) of validity must be written on the ticket before use. This replaces the separate credit-card sized \\"name card\\" which was previously issued with the ticket. Amongst other things it offers discounts at some museums and monuments in the √éle-de-France. It is aimed particularly at tourists ‚Äî but in many cases, Mobilis is cheaper. = Specialized tickets and discount cards =  Carte Am√©thyste  The Carte Am√©thyste is a discount card for the elderly and the disabled (aged over 20).Subject to a maximum annual income. It allows free travel on all modes of transport throughout the √éle-de-France.  Carte Solidarit√© Transport  The Carte Solidarit√© Transport is a discount card for those in great need, those on sickness benefits, those on unemployment benefits, single parents, and those earning the Revenu minimum d'insertion (RMI, a minimum earnings guarantee). It provides a discount of 50% on single tickets and 75% on monthly and weekly Carte orange tickets. The carte has a validity of one year and is intended for those in receipt of benefits. It is only available on demand, and exclusively by telephone (on a free call) through the Solidarit√© Transport agency. Moreover, residents receiving Revenu de solidarit√© active (RSA, a form of social welfare) can use all of the road and rail network for free (except the Orlyval). Since 1 December 2008 this has also applied to those receiving the Allocation sp√©cifique de solidarit√©, another benefit. Beneficiaries of RMI must renew their pass every three months, and the credits are automatically assigned to a Navigo pass or at a charging station.  Fares  Since 1 August 2016, the fares for ticket t+ are: * Ticket \\"t+\\": sold individually, * Sold on board buses: * of 10 tickets: ‚Äî carnets can be purchased for half-price for use by children under 10 as well as various groups such as the disabled, war veterans, and large school groups. \\"Origin - Destination\\" tickets (those priced according to distance travelled), sold both singly and in , vary depending on distance travelled. For most journeys, a carnet of ten tickets ‚Äì which are valid in either direction ‚Äì costs the same as eight individual tickets. Navigo tickets increased in price depending on the zones included. Fares for zone 5 were unchanged. For example, the monthly price for a Navigo pass for zones 1 and 2 increased from to , an increase of 12.9% ‚Äî although the fares had remained unchanged since 2011.

In wide-ranging species, the contributions of heredity and environment are not always certain, but their interplay can sometimes be determined by experiment. Plants Plants display the most obvious examples of ecophenotypic variation. One example are trees growing in the woods developing long straight trunks, with branching crowns high in the canopy, while the same species growing alone in the open develops a spreading form, branching much lower to the ground. Genotypes often have much flexibility in the modification and expression of phenotypes; in many organisms these phenotypes are very different under varying environmental conditions. The plant Hieracium umbellatum is found growing in two different habitats in Sweden. One habitat is rocky sea-side cliffs, where the plants are bushy with broad leaves and expanded inflorescences; the other is among sand dunes where the plants grow prostrate with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. These habitats alternate along the coast of Sweden and the habitat that the seeds of H. umbellatum land in determines the phenotype that grows. Invasive plants such as the honeysuckle can thrive by altering their morphology in response to changes in the environment, which gives them a competitive advantage. Another example of a plants phenotypic reaction and adaptation with its environment is how Thlaspi caerulescens can absorb the metals in the soil to use to its advantage in defending against harmful microbes and bacteria in its leaves.\\"Plants 'armor up' with metals.\\" Science Online.

The more immediate responses shown by vascular plants to their environment, for instance a vine's ability to conform to the wall or tree upon which it grows, are not usually considered ecophenotypic, even though the mechanisms may be related.Gibson, J.

Animals Since animals are far less plastic than plants, ecophenotypic variation is noteworthy. When encountered, it can cause confusion in identification if it is not anticipated.

In sexual reproduction, each parent contributes half of his or her genome to the offspring; thus the offspring contain a mixture of genetic material. Adaptations are traits that increase fitness, the driving force for natural selection. The level of fitness associated with an allele can only be ascertained by comparison with alternate alleles. Traits that increase the survival rate of a species contribute to an animal's fitness, but selection will only favor such traits insofar as survival improves the reproductive success of the organism. More interesting are examples where causation is less clear. Among mollusks, examples include the muricid snail species Nucella lamellosa, which in rough, shallow waters is generally less spiny than in deeper, quiet waters.Abbott, R.

Held since 1897, the show attracts entries from around the world. Day one of the two-day event is the judging and trade day, attended primarily by industry participants and press, while day two is scheduled to coincide with the Nantwich and South Cheshire Agricultural Show, and attracts about 40,000 visitors to sample the wares and hear the announcements of the winners. The International Cheese Awards is an activity of the Nantwich Agricultural Society, a UK registered charity.  Show features  In addition to sampling and purchasing more than 4,600 cheeses in the Cheese Pavilion, visitors to the show are treated to various attractions throughout the day including cheese making demonstrations, trophy presentations and live cookery demonstrations.  History  The original cheese show was founded in 1897 when the Cheshire Agricultural Society, who had been holding shows for some years at different venues in the county, split the county into four shows in their own right, one of which was Nantwich & Northwich, and in 1903 the show was held under its own auspices and with no link to the Cheshire Agricultural Society. The Nantwich Dairy Shows continued to be staged each year, and it is recorded that the Dairy Show of 1908 was held in the Market Hall on 28 & 29 October. The Dairy and Horticultural Shows continued to be held annually, however, the two World Wars overshadowed such events, and there is little in detail of them to be found during this period. The show continued to be held intermittently until, in 1946, the show found a permanent home at Dorfold Park, where it has been held annually since, apart for break in years due to outbreaks of Foot & Mouth disease. The Nantwich Cheese Show celebrated its centenary in 1997 with an appearance by the Royal Household Cavalry. In 2009 the Nantwich Cheese Show was re-branded to the International Cheese Awards.  Committee and charity  The International Cheese Awards is organised and run by a committee of volunteers contributing expertise from the dairy and cheese industries as well as event management, sponsorship, PR and Marketing industries.

The Minirail snaking past the Ontario (left), Canada (centre) and Western Provinces pavilions (right). The Minirail was an automated monorail system on Saint Helen's and Notre Dame islands in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The network was built for the 1967 World Expo (Expo 67), and continued to operate for Man and his World. The system consisted of three independent circuits operated by two different types of trains: the larger \\"Blue\\" (which ceased operating in 1973) that ran mostly on Notre Dame Island, and the smaller \\"Yellow\\" (ended in 1981) which ran on the north and south ends Saint Helen's Island. Only the La Ronde route loop (also \\"Yellow\\"), segregated from the rest of the system on the north end, still remains and continues to operate at the amusement park to this day‚Äîthe only surviving part of the Minirail. Routes The main part of the system was the \\"Blue\\" Minirail on Notre Dame Island and a small section of Saint Helen's Island. There were also two smaller loops: the \\"Yellow\\" Minirails on opposite ends of Saint Helen's Island. The minimum system radius was , and maximum grade 10%. =Notre Dame Island (Blue)= The larger Minirail was laid out to pass as many major points as possible. Stations were named for nearby major attractions. The circuit had six stops at four stations, Agriculture and Theme being served twice. Although on an elevated structure up to above the ground for most of its length, the line also swung out over the water near the Quebec pavilion, dropping to within of the St. Lawrence. It also ran through the Ontario pavilion and the geodesic dome of the U.S. Pavilion. A small section of the Blue line ran on Saint Helen's Island, primarily to connect to the Metro and (south) Yellow Minirail line. The track structure was designed by the Swiss firm of Maschinenfabrik Habegger and fabricated on-site by Dominion Bridge Company. The running rails were twin √ó \\"I\\" beams apart, supported on A-frame pylons on centres, reduced to on curves. The Blue Minirail continued to operate on Notre Dame Island until late 1973, despite the closure and abandonment of the park below two years earlier. During these final two years there were no stops as all stations on Notre Dame Island were closed, therefore passengers boarded and exited at the \\"Metro\\" Minirail station on Saint Helen's Island. The circuit was dismantled by the mid 1970s, primarily due to construction of the Olympic rowing basin. =Saint Helen's Island (Yellow)= The Saint Helen's Island Yellow Minirail ran around a loop on the south end of the island that connected Metro station on the Blue Minirail to the Expo Express‚Äô Sainte Helen's station. After leaving the latter station the route swung over a corner of Swan Lake. Both this and the La Ronde loop were built by Mojan Lt√©e. It ceased operation when the Saint Helen's Island section of Man and His World closed in late 1981, and then later demolished in the mid 1980s. =La Ronde (Yellow)= The La Ronde Yellow Minirail is also on Saint Helen's Island, but was completely separate from the rest of the system. It circles the amusement park, and its route also passes the Marina and runs in between Dolphin Lake and the Saint Lawrence River. It continues to operate to present day, albeit on a slightly modified route. Equipment =Blue= Passengers rode in open cars that carried a maximum of 12 people in each. Nine cars made up a single train; one head car, seating only three passengers, seven mid-section cars and one tail car. = Yellow = The Yellow Minirails received their nicknames from the colour of the cars‚Äô canopies. Twelve 16-car trains operated on each line. Each train seated 60 in its length. Also designed by Habegger, these cars were built in 1964 for the Swiss National Exhibition held that year in Lausanne. Originally controlled by an on-board operator, they were converted to automatic operation for Expo 67. Additional cars were purchased from the manufacturer, Von Roll Seilbahnen AG. to replace the rolling stock and rail from Lausanne that were sold to Blackpool's Pleasure Beach. The Yellow Minirails ran on a pair of outward-facing √ó \\"C\\" channels, apart and supported on A-frames. Now managed by the Six Flags Corporation, the La Ronde facility has replaced the minirail canopies with ones of an aqua-green colour.

Plot Beavis and Butt-Head walk to an abandoned drive-in to find out that it has been replaced with a computer technical support office, where Butt-Head asks one of the office workers what has happened to the abandoned drive-in. Thinking that they're new employees, the technical support worker named Hamid (a Middle Eastern man with a thick accent) gets Beavis and Butt-Head to sit down and work at the two vacant workstations inside his cubicle. However, the duo tries to browse the internet for pornography while mishandling the technical support calls they get, to which Hamid complains to his manager about their antics. Whilst talking to Hamid, the manager nonetheless thinks the duo is doing their job correctly and encourages him to act like them. As a result, Hamid starts to imitate Beavis and Butt-Head, with the duo starting out being impressed with his imitation. Eventually, the duo stop finding him funny and whilst Hamid is talking to a customer who is having problems with a computer at a power plant, Butt-Head tells Hamid to tell him to \\"butt plug his computer\\". Hamid misunderstands him and instead tells him to unplug the computer, while Butt-Head meanwhile finally obtains a porn site called \\"Lonely Nasty Housewives\\". As the girl in the website is about to strip, the power goes out. The duo, however, thinks the computer is broken and unplugs it in order to get it fixed. As they walk out, two men in a truck (Ross and Harlan) spot them and think that they are looting due to the power outage, to which they drive through the window of the building and begin looting; Butt-Head calls the place cool again.

Unlike waterboarding, where water is poured on a wet cloth placed over a supine subject's airways, so their breathing slowly fills their lungs with water, dryboarding induces asphyxiation through stuffing the subject's airways with rags, then taping shut their mouth and nose. It is among techniques used by the United States during its war on terror: CIA and military agents under the Bush administration described this as among enhanced interrogation techniques. It has since legally been defined by US courts as torture. Ali Saleh al-Marri, a legal resident of the United States, was arrested while in graduate school. After being classified by the Department of Defense as an enemy combatant, he was held in a Navy brig in the USA. He described to his lawyer that, during his early interrogation, agents stuffed rags down his throat and then taped his mouth and nose shut. His attorney described this procedure as dry-boarding. This material was reported by the press after being received following an eight-year-old FOIA request. When this information was published in 2011, Almerindo Ojeda, the director of the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas, made the connection to the deaths of three detainees on June 10, 2006, at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. At the time, DOD had said each of the men committed suicide, all on the same night. The NCIS investigative report (2008) described the men as having rags stuffed down their throats. Ojeda and the journalists Tony Bartelme and Scott Horton said this sounded like dry-boarding. Ojeda expressed skepticism that the men could have committed suicide by stuffing rags down their throats, then tying their hands behind their backs, and suspending themselves by their necks, as described in the NCIS report of 2008 and DOD accounts.

Some sources credit him with inventing the installment plan for buying furniture. In 1889, Rhodes entered a partnership with the owner of a neighboring furniture store J.J.

It is directed by Singaporean first-time filmmakers Jeremy Boo and Lee Xian Jie, who have also started an online platform that encourages people in Asia to share their experiences about dementia. Synopsis The film tells the story of Joyce Fernandez, a 50-year-old woman caring for her mother, Celine Fernandez, who has had Alzheimer's Disease for seven years. When Celine suffers a mild stroke and is hospitalized for over three months, Joyce attempts to keep herself together, especially after Celine loses all of what little speech and she originally had. The duo, staunch Catholics, keep their heads above the emotional turmoil through daily prayer. The documentary also captures frank interviews with Dr Irene Giam (PhD), a former mathematics tutor and atheist, with strong views about death in the face of terminal illness. She is first filmed after being diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, likely due to systemic fibrosis, an autoimmune disorder which affects her breathing. After she is warded in a hospice because of her rapidly worsening health, vascular dementia causes her to forget the frequent visits by her husband and deepens her feelings of loneliness.

She wrote many treatises, especially in the field of analytical chemistry. Biography She was born in Ia»ôi, in the Moldavia region of Romania; her parents were Constantin and Smaranda Ripan, both originally from Hu»ôi. She attended the local girl's high school, after which she enrolled in the Faculty of Science of the University of Ia»ôi, graduating in 1919. For her graduate studies she went to the University of Cluj in Transylvania, obtaining her PhD in 1922 under the direction of Gheorghe Spacu, with thesis \\"Double amines corresponding to double sulphates in the magnesium series\\". She is recognized as the first woman from Romania to earn a Ph.D. in the chemical sciences. After obtaining in 1930 her Habilitation and the title of Docent, Ripan became an associate professor of analytic chemistry at the Faculty of Science of the University of Cluj. During World War II, when Cluj passed under Hungarian administration under the terms of the Second Vienna Award, the university moved to Timi»ôoara. In July 1942 (by which time she had 53 publications), she was promoted to full professor through a decree published in Monitorul Oficial. After the war she returned to Cluj, where she served as Dean of the Faculty of Chemistry from 1948 to 1952. In 1948, Ripan was elected titular member of the Romanian Academy, thus becoming the first woman to be inducted in that academy. In 1951 she founded the Institute of Chemistry, consisting of three sections (inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, and physical chemistry); she headed the institute until 1970. From 1951 to 1955 she served as Rector of the University of Cluj, the first woman to hold a rectorship in Romania. In 1952 she was elected deputy to the Great National Assembly for the Cluj-Nord constituency of the Cluj Region, serving in this capacity until 1957. In 1963 she was awarded an honorary degree by the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru≈Ñ. Ripan worked in the domain of complex combinations and their use in analytical chemistry. She discovered and studied new classes of complex combinations used in the determination of metals, as well as new methods of assay for thallium, lead, tellurium, selenic acid, and selenocyanates. One of her students at the University of Cluj was Ionel Haiduc (a future President of the Romanian Academy), who wrote an undergraduate thesis on polyoxometalates under her direction in 1959. She died in Cluj-Napoca in 1972, and is buried at the city's Hajongard Cemetery. The \\"Raluca Ripan Institute for Research in Chemistry\\" is now part of Babe»ô-Bolyai University. A vocational high school in Cluj-Napoca also bears her name, as does a national Chemistry competition for high school students.

Al Jazeera Balkans (AJB) is an international news television station headquartered in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina aimed at the media markets of the countries that used to be constituent units of SFR Yugoslavia. It is part of the Al Jazeera Media Network. The station broadcasts in ‚Ä≥the common language spoken in Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Montenegro‚Ä≥ (formerly usually referred to as Serbo- CroatianAl Jazeera launches Balkans television channel. BBC, 11 November 2011.) from 7.30 to 3.30 CET (start and end 30 minutes later on the weekends), with both of live, pre-recorded original, and subtitled Al Jazeera English programming. The live dirty feed of Al Jazeera English is simulcast the remainder of hours with simply (You are watching AJE) text-bug overlaid at the top-right corner of the screen. Al Jazeera Balkans is a sister channel of the Arabic language Al Jazeera and the English language channel Al Jazeera English. The station broadcasts news analysis and features as well as documentaries, live debates, current affairs, business, technology, and sports highlights. History =Purchase= On 22 September 2010, after months of speculation, the Qatari government-owned Al Jazeera Media Network announced the US$1.56 million purchase of NTV 99, a local channel based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.BBC News Europe, 11 November 2011 - Al Jazeera launches Balkans television channel Named Al Jazeera Balkans (AJB), the project was envisioned as \\"a leader in providing high quality news and current affairs in the region [of former Yugoslavia]\\" with planned offices throughout the Balkans and bureaus in key locations worldwide. =Preparation= Soon after the purchase announcement, Al Jazeera made a lease agreement with BBI Real Estate regarding the usage of the 800m2 space at the top floors of Sarajevo's BBI Centar. The station also leased office space in the B2 building located at the top of Balkanska Street in central Belgrade, across the street from Hotel Moskva, converting it into a remote television studio. In parallel, it set about staffing its planned Balkans operation whose launch was set for January 2011. With the Slobodna Bosna newsmagazine reporting Al Jazeera Balkans offering minimum monthly salaries in excess of ‚Ç¨1,000 as well as 5-year term contracts, the run on the station by interested local journalists was sizable. The network also decided to go after marquee local name(s) for top editorial and/or management positions. It began looking at Croatian state broadcaster HRT's personnel in this regard with Aleksandar Stankoviƒá, Denis Latin, and Goran Miliƒá being mentioned as potential transfer targets. Other established names being bandied about were additional Yutel veterans such as Zekerijah Smajiƒá and Ivica Puljiƒá, as well as former HRT and Nova TV personality Mirjana Hrga, and Arijana Saraƒçeviƒá-Helaƒá from Federalna televizija. However, Stankoviƒá reportedly turned down the news director post, saying he's not interested in a management position at this stage of his career. At one point local Sarajevo outlets even announced Latin as AJB's new general director while Miliƒá explicitly denied any negotiations with the network. In the end, the opposite occurred with Miliƒá getting the news director job while Latin eventually decided to stay put at HRT. For the general director position, Al Jazeera hired Tarik ƒêoƒëiƒá, former general secretary at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Foreign Trade Chamber (VTK). By the beginning of 2011 it was clear the planned January launch would be postponed as Miliƒá was finishing up at HRT with a rousing sendoff following his final Dnevnik newscast. The veteran broadcaster soon moved to Sarajevo, marking his professional return to the city having previously worked there from 1990 until 1992, first as part of Yutel and later as the Bosnian government's spokesperson in the initial months of the Bosnian War. In late March 2011, the station aimed for a late summer / early fall launch in September with news director Miliƒá pontificating on how Al Jazeera Balkans might fit into the Balkans media scene: \\"There are over 100 television stations in the region [former Yugoslavia] at the moment. We cannot hope to compete with them on the local level, but Al-Jazeera will offer its regional access, an idea which was abandoned in the 90's due to wars and emotions those conflicts triggered\\". Over the coming months, Al Jazeera Balkans looked into different broadcast models. For a while it entertained the idea of taking over a local station in each of the former Yugoslav countries and turning them into broadcast affiliates. To that end, news appeared about the Qatar Media Corporation making a ‚Ç¨25 million bid for TV Avala, Serbian network with nationwide broadcasting license controlled by Serbian tycoon ≈Ωeljko Mitroviƒá. The approach was confirmed by TV Avala's general manager Bojana Lekiƒá, receiving significant coverage in the Serbian media, especially after information appeared about the Al Jazeera Balkans job interview process including a question about the status of Kosovo. Reportedly, Al Jazeera Balkans wanted to know explicitly where their perspective journalist employees, particularly those from Serbia, stood on the issue of Kosovo's independence. Asked about this hiring practice, news director Miliƒá said: \\"I can't recall specifically whether that question was asked, but I believe it had been. Those are the questions we ask because we must know what our journalists think about certain issues. Our starting point is the reality that in this part of the world certain countries recognize Kosovo as an independent state while others do not\\". The affiliate broadcast model was ultimately abandoned as AJB opted for individual deals with local cable and IPTV providers. Additionally, it decided to provide terrestrial coverage in the Sarajevo area as well as satellite transmission and live web streaming on its own site and on YouTube. =Launch= With ‚Ç¨15 million reportedly invested in the project (according to general director ƒêoƒëiƒá), Al Jazeera Balkans began broadcasting on 11 November 2011, launching their website on the same day. The network's visual appearance is mainly based on that of its English-language counterpart. It broadcasts from the Eutelsat W3C satellite and also offers a live web stream just like its Arabic and English counterparts do. Audience and programming According to a report from the Associated Press, \\"Media experts say they hope the broadcaster will offer objective news to a public that was exposed for two decades to local media heavily influenced by politics.\\"The Washington Examiner 11 November 2011, Aida Cerkez - Al Jazeera launches Balkan broadcast Al Jazeera Balkans has a modern studio in Sarajevo and smaller studios in Belgrade, Zagreb and Skopje. The station plans to have correspondents in Podgorica, Prishtina, Mostar, Split and Banja Luka who will report in the local variants of the Serbo-Croatian language. The station has reporters in based in Washington, D.C., London, Berlin, Vienna, Moscow, Istanbul and Jerusalem by utilizing the resources of the current Al Jazeera bureaus around the world. The network serves viewers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia.Rapid TVNews.com - Al Jazeera Balkans to launch 11 November Programmes Al Jazeera Balkans produces its daily content as well as some weekly content (Al Jazeera Business and Sportski magazin) in its studios located at the BBI Centar's top floor. Its weekly interview programmes, Oni pobjeƒëuju and Recite Al Jazeeri, are shot on remote locations. Reaction and reception =Bosnia and Herzegovina = With the September 2010 announcement of Qatar Media Corporation buying NTV 99 with a view of turning it into a Balkans-wide news channel, Boro Kontiƒá, head of the Open Society-funded journalist training facility Mediacenter in Sarajevo, likened the arrival of the Arab media conglomerate to the atmosphere before the start of the Bosnian War, when it was announced that Sarajevo was to become regional headquarters for the European TV channel Euronews: \\"People aren't afraid of a new war, exactly, but rather political upheaval. People feel they are being monitored, if such a large international media company moves into the local market. But it has the potential to become an objective and independent information channel in the Balkans and it could also help to overcome the petty interests that arose after the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia - be it in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia or Montenegro\\". In terms of Al Jazeera Balkans viewership prospects, Kontiƒá said: \\"In the beginning it will probably be interesting for people to watch it, because they may be tired of local television stations -- so-called public stations, but what are in essence politically controlled. So they may be interested to see whether there is a different perspective on the region [from Al-Jazeera]. But we have a saying: a wonder lasts but three days\\". Borka Rudiƒá, general secretary of the Bosnian- Herzegovinian Journalists Association, found Al Jazeera's decision to come to Bosnia-Herzegovina especially interesting in light of the country not having a strong media market, saying: \\"Money is not the reason behind the network's decision to settle here. No TV station is completely immune to the desire for political influence. I believe Al Jazeera will affect the public opinion in Bosnia, but I don't fear the strengthening influence of radical Islamic forces. I do not think that the arrival of Al Jazeera immediately increases the influence from the East, or that this was the motive for Al Jazeera to settle in Sarajevo\\". =Serbia= The June 2011 revelation of Al Jazeera Balkans asking its job applicants to state their personal position/opinion regarding the international status of Kosovo with the answer potentially determining whether they get hired or not while at the same time making a takeover bid for Serbian nationwide television network TV Avala caused a lot of reaction in the country. Slobodan Reljiƒá, former editor-in-chief at the NIN magazine, stated: \\"I'm not particularly shocked at the way Al Jazeera Balkans picks its staff because contemporary global media outlets have given up on objective journalism. AJB's going to hire a squad of young and good-looking warriors for the station owner's cause. Goran Miliƒá is the right man for the job with loads of experience to execute that task in the most professional manner because none of his personal beliefs will ever enter into it. He's been hired to do a job, and he's going to deliver the kind of television station its owners want. Al Jazeera is quite a fast learner, picking up the tricks of the trade from its Western role models, BBC in particular\\". Olivera Kovaƒçeviƒá, RTS television host, touched on the issue of potential Al Jazeera Balkans journalists from Serbia having to disregard their own country's constitution if the station's hiring criteria is to treat Kosovo as an independent state: \\"The very act of asking that question during a job interview ‚Äì thereby interrogating an applicant on his/her political orientation ‚Äì is in breach of that person's human rights. I accept that every media outlet has an editorial policy, but no one can demand of me to ignore my country's laws and constitution that say Kosovo is part of Serbia. It's going to be a tough call for the broadcasting regulators in Serbia whether to allow an outlet with such policy to own a station that broadcasts nationally in Serbia\\". The opposition Serbian Radical Party (SRS) called on the Serbian Broadcasting Agency (RRA) not to allow the Al Jazeera Balkans' purchase of TV Avala due to the \\"anti- Serb campaign led by the Al Jazeera director for the Balkans, Goran Miliƒá\\". Speaking at party's press conference, SRS presidency collegium member Vjerica Radeta said: \\"Miliƒá has never ceased with his anti-Serb campaign, but the most scandalous of all is that the requirement to get a job at this station is accepting Kosovo as an independent state\\". =International= The Spectator's Fraser Nelson views Al Jazeera's arrival to the Balkans through the lens of the ongoing global \\"information war\\" and the Western media's current standing in that showdown. Discussing the situation in various spots around the globe, he contends that \\"the BBC has come under fierce competition from Al Jazeera\\", which the British haven't responded to adequately, bringing up the Balkans as an example where \\"the BBC World Service closed down its 21-man Serbian radio operation, while Al Jazeera Balkans set about hiring 150 people in Sarajevo headed by the veteran Croatian journalist Goran Miliƒá\\". He goes on to praise this formula of having \\"local television champions\\" rather than \\"foisting Anderson Cooper on the world\\". Tim Judah wrote a piece on the launch of Al Jazeera Balkans in The Economist, going through the various ethnic, religious, political, and linguistic specifics in the former Yugoslavia before wondering \\"whether people from one part of the Balkans are still interested in the others\\" outside of \\"enjoying each other's reality shows\\". Right after mentioning that \\"news broadcasts from Sarajevo, Banja Luka, Belgrade and Zagreb are all utterly different\\", Judah claims Al Jazeera Balkans faces the problem of \\"many Serbs and Croats assuming it is \\"Muslim\\" television\\". He concludes by saying that Al Jazeera's Arabic service played a key role in the Arab Spring and wonders \\"what sort of influence Qatar may want, or gain, in the Balkans\\". Writing in his blog on The Weekly Standard web site, Stephen Schwartz sees Al Jazeera Balkans (AJB) as \\"the revival of a \\"Yugoslav\\" television network\\", bringing up AJB news director Goran Miliƒá's past affiliation with Yutel, \\"a network that attempted to rescue Yugoslavia during its collapse, from 1990 to 1992\\". Schwartz concludes that \\"in entering the Balkans, Al Jazeera has opted for an attempted revival of a long-shattered Yugoslav cultural unity, combined with a gambit for greater Islamist influence\\", but also warns that \\"its decision comes at a bad time for the region, with Wahhabi radicals agitating across Balkan borders, and the neo- fundamentalist Turkish regime of Recep Tayyip Erdogan bidding for revived prestige in the former Ottoman provinces in Europe\\". As for the network's financial prospects, Schwartz expresses doubts \\"that evocation of the long- gone, artificial nationality of the former Yugoslavia will make Al Jazeera‚Äôs investment in the Balkans profitable\\" though offers a possibility of \\"corrupt politicians dominating the ex-Yugoslav successor states finding it lucrative to have connections to Gulf petrobillionaires\\". Shawn Powers, assistant professor at the Georgia State University, claims the Al Jazeera network openly seeks to tap into Muslim-majority countries and markets it believes are hungry for a news agenda that is better tailored to their interests and is eager to tug the geopolitical center of gravity away from Europe‚Äîand closer to the Arab World: \\"I think the decision about the Balkans, Turkey, and East Africa actually has to do with potential market shares, the fact that they think they can generate some revenue in these markets down the road. And of course there is also the strategic importance of each of these markets in the broader agenda of political Islam, and of turning countries toward the Middle East as opposed to away from the Middle East\\". Film festival In 2018, Al Jazeera Balkans launched its documentary film festival the Al Jazeera Balkans Documentary Film Festival. Its first edition was held from 21 to 25 September 2018. The festival was established by Al Jazeera Balkans in cooperation with the Al Jazeera Media Network and the Doha-based Al Jazeera Media Institute. Al Jazeera Balkans is currently the biggest buyer of television format documentaries in the Former Yugoslavia and annually acquires rights for most of the regional documentary films that are screened during the Sarajevo Film Festival. AJB DOC directly lent its concept from the Al Jazeera International Documentary Film Festival, which was founded in 2005 by Jordanian film director and writer, Abbas Arnaout.

Located at 360 Park Street in Elgin, Illinois on the Elgin Academy campus. The historic \\"Old Main\\" building houses offices, research facilities, the Elgin History Museum, and a gift shop. History The Society was created in 1961 through the efforts of local authors and historians such as LaRoy Morning, Madeline Sadler Waggoner, Karl Lehr and E. C. Alft. The Society lacked a permanent home for many years and stored its donated artifacts in the homes of Society members and in the basement of Elgin‚Äôs Gail Borden Public Library District. Building The Society has occupied its current home, Old Main, since 1987. Old Main opened on December 1, 1856, as a private school, the Elgin Academy, and is noted for its Greek Revival design. Old Main was Elgin‚Äôs first building entered on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1911 lightning caused a fire that destroyed Old Main‚Äôs roof which was replaced without the building‚Äôs distinctive gabled roof and cupola. The Elgin Academy continued to use the building until 1969 when financial pressures and new safety codes led to its abandonment. The Academy offered Old Main to the City of Elgin which in 1976 decided that its preservation would be an appropriate bicentennial community project. Prominent Elgin merchant John Spiess proposed a ‚ÄúBuck-a-Brick‚Äù fund raising campaign selling 150,000 bricks being laid in Fountain Square Plaza Mall. The successful campaign enabled Elgin to take ownership of the building and, despite another fire in 1978, restore the building‚Äôs exterior in 1979-80. In 1981 the City of Elgin leased Old Main to the Society. With additional funds raised by the Society and from state and federal sources and with many hours of volunteer labor by members of the Society, Elgin‚Äôs Golden K Kiwanis Club and Gifford Park Association, Old Main‚Äôs interior was refurbished for museum use. The Society moved into Old Main‚Äôs first floor in 1987 and has used all three floors since 1991.‚ÄúHistory Reigns in Old Main,‚Äù Chicago Tribune, October 25, 1992.‚ÄúOld Main‚Äù in E. C.

The Library is named in honor of Clarence Reber, a former president and devoted advocate, collector and cataloger for the Society. The Library‚Äôs collections span Elgin‚Äôs history but feature the old Elgin photographs from the collection of Elmer Gyllek, thousands of photographic negatives donated by the Elgin Courier News, local probate and divorce records, and rich resources for research on Elgin homes. The Library also holds production records for most Elgin National Watch Company watches made before the 1950s and offers research services providing information on specific watches. Museum exhibits The Society, through a small professional staff and significant volunteer assistance, maintains a museum of Elgin history on two floors of Old Main. The museum provides a general review of Elgin‚Äôs history while presenting expanded displays on significant community experiences such as the local watch industry, the Elgin Road Races, and The Song of Hiawatha Pageant, a local event based on the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem that entertained Elginites for over 50 years. Additionally, the Society has partnered with sponsors to produce traveling historical exhibits including Deep Roots, Green City: City Planning in Elgin and The Jewish Experience in Elgin: Stories of Immigration, Identity, and Assimilation.‚ÄúElgin Celebrates Jewish Legacy,‚Äù Chicago Tribune, November 15, 2006.‚ÄúDeep Roots Green Future City Planning in Elgin,‚Äù The Burnham Plan Centennial, retrieved September 19, 2011.

The Society especially emphasizes its outreach to school children and the educational community. The Society has partnered with Elgin Area School District U46 in the American History Partnership and the U-46 Roadmap of American History Project enhancing teachers‚Äô knowledge of traditional American History and social studies. The Society also offers educational programs for children including a summer history camp, history-themed scavenger hunts and opportunities to experience Elgin‚Äôs watch-making and architectural history. Cemetery Walk Each autumn since 1988 the Society has conducted a walk in Elgin‚Äôs historic Bluff City Cemetery. The Cemetery Walk presents costumed actors portraying the lives and personalities of some of the cemetery‚Äôs residents and includes other displays on cemetery customs, styles, and ceremonies of the past.

Background and service under Min Xu  It is not known when Deng Chuna was born, but it is known that he was from Shao Prefecture (ÈÇµÂ∑û, in modern Shaoyang, Hunan). In his youth, he became a soldier under Min Xu, an officer from Jiangxi Circuit (Ê±üË•ø, headquartered in modern Nanchang, Jiangxi), on a deployment to Annan (ÂÆâÂçó, i.e., modern northern Vietnam).New Book of Tang, vol. 186. In 881, when Min and his soldiers were returning from Annan, they went through Tan Prefecture (in modern Changsha, Hunan), and Min expelled the governor of Hunan Circuit (ÊπñÂçó, headquartered at Tan Prefecture) and took over the circuit.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Min thereafter claimed the title of acting governor and made Deng the prefect of Shao Prefecture.  Takeover of Wu'an  In 886, when Tan Prefecture was under attack by Zhou Yue the prefect of Heng Prefecture (Ë°°Â∑û, in modern Hengyang, Hunan), Min Xu welcomed one Huang Hao (), an officer under Qin Zongquan, who had declared himself emperor of a new state centered around Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), to help him defend against Zhou's attack. Once inside the city walls of Tan Prefecture, however, Huang assassinated Min. Zhou subsequently defeated and killed Huang, and took over the circuit (which had been renamed Qinhua Circuit by that point), eventually being commissioned as its military governor (Jiedushi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. Hearing of Min's death and blaming Zhou for it, Deng Chuna mourned Min bitterly, and stated to his officers:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. The officers agreed with him. He trained his forces for seven years, and, in 893, in alliance with Lei Man the prefect of Lang Prefecture (ÊúóÂ∑û, in modern Changde, Hunan), attacked Tan Prefecture. He captured it and executed Zhou, claiming for himself the title of acting military governor of Wu'an Circuit (as Qinhua had been renamed Wu'an by that point). In spring 894, then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong commissioned him full military governor.  Defeat and Death  However, later that year, an army commanded by Liu Jianfeng and Ma Yin approached Wu'an. Deng sent his officers Jiang Xun () and Deng Jichong () with the Shao Prefecture troops to resist the attack at Longhui Pass (ÈæçÂõûÈóú, in modern Shaoyang). Ma persuaded Jiang and Deng Jichong that Liu's success was prophesied and irresistible, and they disbanded their army. Ma took over the uniforms they wore and headed directly for Tan Prefecture. The Tan Prefecture defense forces, believing that these were soldiers from Shao Prefecture, took no precautions. Ma marched directly into the city and the circuit headquarters, capturing Deng Chuna, who was holding a feast, and executed him, allowing Liu to take over the circuit.

These changes have led to varying ecological harm to the forests and natural species of wildlife that call Wyoming home. Within the state organizations and governments are working to combat these environmental threats and restore balance to the ecology. This article details several major ecological disasters within the state while also describing the steps that are being taken by local governments, organizations, and groups to prevent future disasters.  Environmental research  In 2015, Wyoming made it a crime to collect data about rural land for the purpose of sharing it with the federal government. This penalizes scientists and journalists who are studying pollution. Relief map of Wyoming Natural resource extraction Wyoming is a resource rich state with a history of boom and bust cycles. The 1970s energy crisis initiated a coal-mining boom in Wyoming that lasted until the early 80's. The state's latest energy boom (1995‚Äì2010) is due to increased development in oil and natural gas production as well as further growth in the coal-mining industry. Despite the role of natural resource extraction in the economy, growth in Wyoming is characterized by severe environmental consequences. =Industry development= A drilling rig located in the Pinedale Anticline Production in Wyoming's oil and gas industry grew from $7.3 billion to $17.6 billion between 2000 and 2006.Headwaters Economics.

Retrieved November 29, 2011, from Two of the nation's largest natural gas fields, Pinedale Anticline and Jonah Field, are located in Sublette County, Wyoming. Wyoming accounts for roughly one tenth of U.S. natural gas production. The natural gas industry in the state continues to expand due to low levels of consumption and development of pipeline systems that facilitate transport to consumers in California and the Midwest. Oil production in Wyoming only accounts for about 3 percent of U.S. production. However, Wyoming's oil shale deposits contain one fourth of global shale oil reserves, or about 300 billion barrels. Oil shale is not currently an economically recoverable source of energy, as current technology is unable to extract the shale efficiently, but these reserves could pave the way for further development in the state. Energy development in Wyoming has generated well-deserved attention, as the state has been able to maintain a relatively stable economy throughout the current recession. While economic growth has proven beneficial in many aspects, it has also adversely impacted the environment of the least populous U.S. state, affecting the quality of air, water, soil and wildlife. Recently, concentration on degradation of air quality and damage to wildlife habitat has been emphasized by environmental activists.  Water pollution  Cows often graze on public land. Their manure pollutes rivers with E. coli and salmonella. Air pollution Development in Wyoming's oil and gas industry is transforming what has historically been some of the cleanest air in the nation to some of the most polluted. Production of natural gas contributes to heightened ozone levels. Ozone is a molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms that is harmful to animals when present in the lower atmosphere.Environmental Protection Agency. (2010). What is ozone?. In Air Quality Awareness. Retrieved November 29, 2011, from Winter months correlate with heightened ozone levels in the region. Temperature inversions occur when cool air on the ground covered by a layer of warmer air trap volatile organic compounds and nitrous oxides in the lower atmosphere, whose interactions create ozone. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), winter 2010 saw ozone pollution levels in the Upper Green River Basin of Sublette County, Wyoming surpass the worst days of any major U.S. city. = Health effects = Excessive ozone levels are harmful to human health, especially in children and elderly people. Effects include lung damage, worsened asthma, reduced lung capacity, and increased premature deaths. More commonly reported effects include watery eyes, bloody noses, and breathlessness.Environmental Protection Agency. (2011, July 6). Health. In Ground-level Ozone.

Designation as a nonattainment area would initiate efforts to restore ozone levels to those in agreement with the Clean Air Act, ensuring that citizens' health is not at risk. Former Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal advised that the Upper Green River Basin be designated as a region that exceeds national standards for acceptable ozone levels in 2009. Failure of the EPA to formally recognize the Upper Green River Basin as a nonattainment area is what instigates CURED's threat to sue. Wildlife = Habitat loss = The infrastructure of natural gas development includes wells, pipelines, roads, and other components that damage wildlife through direct habitat loss, deterioration of habitat and displacement. Population spikes associated with industry growth result in urban sprawl, as demand for living space increases, further reducing habitat available to wildlife. Additionally, road and pipeline construction divide habitat, resulting in greater automobile related fatalities. Development of the Pinedale Anticline Project Area (PAPA) has impacted several species of big game dependent on western Wyoming for winter habitat, most notably pronghorn, mule deer, elk, bighorn sheep and moose. Growth of the Pinedale Anticline gas field has also compromised winter habitat and mating grounds for the Greater Sage Grouse, a game bird species indigenous to western North America and present candidate for the endangered species list. =Pine beetles= Wyoming faces a range of ecological risks but perhaps none greater than the current infestation of pine beetle populations across the coniferous forests of the state and surrounding regions. The problem is extensive, far-reaching, and almost all encompassing. Steps are being taken to prevent further spread of the infestation but in expert opinions those steps are coming too little too late. In addition, there is an entire future forest that will be threatened by these beetles and climate change. Infestation The Mountain pine beetle typically attacks in the late summer and lay larva in the trees that survive under the bark until the next summer. During the summer infestation, the beetle produces a blue fungus that at epidemic levels usually destroys even healthy trees. Trees that have been affected are marked by brown pine needles and a bluish hue to the inside of their bark. In a typical climate large amounts of the beetle populations are killed during the days in the middle of winter when the temperature falls to minus 30 for weeks at a time. Today these temperatures are not being seen in forests, allowing pine beetles to survive the winter and come back in greater populations the next summer. In some instances, however, the temperatures are staying so warm the beetles are allowed time for two eating cycles causing even further devastation to tree populations.Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. Bark Beetle Fact Sheet .://www. Fs. Usda. Gov/internet/fse_documents/stelprdb5337223. Pdf Mt Fraser - Pine Beetle Damage Distribution Currently in Wyoming it is estimated that nearly 3.65 million acres have been infected and across the United States that number is north of 40 million acres. The beetles usually attack the Lodgepole Pine populations but because the epidemic is at such a monumental scale the beetles are attacking any coniferous tree including; Ponderosa Pine, Limber Pine, Douglas Fir, Subalpine Fir, Silver Fir, Spruce, and Cedar trees. Through the next ten years it is estimated 100,000 trees will fall daily in forests across the country due to pine beetle infestations. Causes and prevention In the early 1800s settlers mismanaged forests in the hopes of preventing fires but only allowed stand densities to reach critical levels that allowed beetles to easily spread from one tree to the next. In addition rising global temperature have allowed these beetle populations to grow and thrive at unheard of rates. Lastly a multi-year drought that extended from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s made trees weak and susceptible to attacks. The Southeastern region of Wyoming is the most infected region. Experts already predict by the year 2012 90% of the trees in these regions will be dead or infected. Steps are, however, being taken to prevent further infection and distribution. Throughout the region the local forest service is safely cutting these trees in an attempt to keep beetle populations at bay and to prevent the risk of falling trees in heavily traveled areas of the forest. With the future of the forests in mind forest services are also working on forest recovery. To do this they are replanting/-seeding areas of the forest to create a diverse and manageable environment for the future ecology of the area. This recovery process also entails a resiliency aspect that will allow future trees to be protected from pine beetle infestations by reducing stand densities.(2011, August 27). Why are Beetles Destroying Western Forests?. http://frogsaregreen. Com/tag/mountain-pine-beetles-wyoming/. Ecological effect This combination of mismanaged forests and deadfall caused by pine beetle adds up to an inevitable conclusion that fires will destroy these forests. These fire risks and falling trees caused by the beetle infestation have the ability to affect over 3,700 miles of roads, 1,300 miles of trails, and 69 miles of transmission and distribution power lines. Consequently, it is important that the forest service manages these falling trees by cutting certain sections of forest down to aid in the safety of these areas. This catastrophe will severely impact the wildlife of the region. Many animal species rely on these forests for both predation and climate protection. American Elk populations will likely decrease due to the loss of protection as will American Marten populations due to the Marten's reliance on thick, heavily forested areas to hunt. Pine squirrel populations will likely experience the most dramatic decrease because the squirrels rely on pine seeds to survive the harsh winters. Other animal populations that will be effected include the Northern goshawk and the snowshoe hare as their habitats are destroyed and their nutrition resources disappear.Department of agriculture, Forest service.

Pdf Bark beetle galleries - geograph.org.uk - 516322 Future forests If global climate simulators are correct, then, in fifty years when these forests are returning the heavily temperature effected pine beetle populations could potentially be even stronger and in regions today protected by the colder climates at higher elevations. The predicted 2.5 degree Celsius temperature increase will allow the beetles to further migrate into regions of massive Canadian forests and into the eastern United States that had once been protected by the vast plains of Middle America.Allen, Natalie.

The 2010 mortality rate of trees was a quarter of what it had been the two previous years. This may sound like good news but in reality it means the beetles are simply running out of trees to infect.P, J. (2011). Experts: Pine Beetles are Eating Themselves out of Wyoming. Casper Star Tribune, Web =Endangered Wyoming toad= The Wyoming toad, Anaxyrus baxteri The Wyoming toad Anaxyrus baxteri (formerly known as Bufo baxteri), is an extremely rare amphibian restricted to the Albany County in the State of Wyoming, USA. The toad was initially considered a subspecies of the Canadian toad, but later on, found out to be a separate species. The adult is, on average, 2.2 inches in length and the color varies from brown to gray (often with a greenish tint) accompanied with darker blotches. A very distinctive feature of the species is the 'bony hump' between the eyes as a result of fused cranial crests. The toad was a common sight in the Laramie Basin up until the population crash that occurred in the mid-1970s. The species has been critically endangered since 1984 and became totally extinct in the wild in 1991 (also listed as such under the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species). Originally, the toad occupied a geographical range of about 2330 km¬≤, and lived in floodplains or on shores of lakes & ponds, but now the species occurs only at the Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge, which is only a small part of the initial range. The population is still currently declining. Causes of decline The primary cause of the decline of the Wyoming toad is the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Db), which is affecting amphibian populations worldwide. The fungus has been shown, in numerous studies, to cause disease in many different amphibian species and has been found in captive Wyoming Toad populations as well. Scientists have discovered through retrospective analysis that the fungus was present on the natural habitat of the Wyoming Toad as early as 1989 at least, and speculate that the fungus might have been responsible for the initial population crash, which still remains unknown. Other important environmental issues contributing to the decline include agro- chemicals that leak from farms and ranches. Chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, agricultural hormones and fertilizers, have been observed to directly alter the physiological development of the toads in some cases, and indirectly stress the amphibians, weakening their resistance to the Chrytrid fungus. In fact, because chemicals are usually tested individually, the ‚Äòlegal‚Äô dosages of many agro-chemicals, which were considered to be harmless before, are now observed to be rather dangerous in combination with one another or with other factors already present such as the Chytrid fungus, and these chemicals are now prone to revision. Habitat destruction, and global climate change are also affecting the Wyoming Toad or other amphibian populations but to a somewhat lesser extent. Ecological consequences The first major concern with regards to the population decline is the possible extinction of the species.http://gf.state.wy.us/downloads/pdf/SWAP/Amphibians/WyomingToad.pdf The species is not only totally extinct in the wild for 2 decades, but even its populations in captivity are also declining. Due to their low number, there is a rather elevated rate of inbreeding, making the gene pool of the population small, and decreasing the likelihood to evolve resistance against pathogens including the Chytrid fungus. Aside from the possible extinction of the toad, scientists are also worried that the population decline might lead to unforeseen chain effects in the ecosystem. Since the Wyoming Toad is an amphibian, which occupies a niche in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, its absence might lead to trophic cascades in the ecosystem, such as its preys increasing in number and affecting other species. Amphibians such as the Wyoming Toad are furthermore good indicators of ecosystem health, and their disappearance would not only signify the degradation of the environment but would also render assessment of the natural habitats harder. Scientists are therefore highly concerned about the survival of the toad. Conservation Wyoming Toad being examined by scientist. Several agencies such as the Wyoming Game and Fish, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, and the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo are currently working on saving the species. The primary focus is breeding the toad in captivity and releasing tadpoles in the wild as an attempt to restore the previous populations. However, no reproduction has been recorded in the wild so far, and it seems that the species are procreating successfully only in captivity. The reason why the Toads are not doing as well in nature remains unknown, and many scientists agree that more funds should be available for research as many factors remain totally unstudied in this ecosystem. Even though the species is protected under the Endangered Species Act, professionals working with the toad also argue that the situation is not well known enough to the public, and believe that the Wyoming Toads deserve more attention from the media than they are being given. Scientists think that, through education, they would get more support from volunteers, and people would also contribute less to the downfall of the animal. Many people in the field regret that amphibians unfortunately do not possess as much ‚Äòcharisma‚Äô as endangered birds or mammals, and therefore are not really cared for. For now the people who care are only waiting for some Chytrid-resistant toads to show up. =Gray wolves= Prior to colonization by Europeans, North America had 4 to 5 subspecies of wolf across the continent. Prey was abundant and wolves could be found almost anywhere. In fact the wolf was once the most widespread mammal in the northern hemisphere with homeranges exceeding 600 miles. The Gray wolf is a true generalist; it can occupy almost any environment including forests, tundra, deserts and plains. The Gray Wolf has gone from abundant predator to nonexistent factor to nonessential experimental reintroduction in Wyoming. The removal and following reintroduction has drawn controversy from multiple parties. Now the Gray Wolf is considered for delisting from the endangered species act, once again creating arguments and dispute. Eradication In the 1800s, abundance of wild hoofed animals was reduced through hunting, grazing opportunities for domesticated livestock increased. In Montana from 1867 to 1890 cattle numbers rose from 67000 to 1.1 million and sheep from 300000 to 2.2 million. With the reduction of wild hoofed prey, wolves turned to cattle and sheep for prey. Predation of livestock became the primary rationale behind wolf elimination. Additionally, wolves had a negative view by the majority of the population during that time. Even Theodore Roosevelt, pioneer of conservation described the wolf as a ‚Äúbeast of waste and desolation.‚Äù Wolves were killed by hunting, trapping, snaring and poisoning. Bounties on wolf pelts were offered by state governments and livestock associations. In 1915 the U.S. Federal government established the Division of Rodent and Predator Control Which further augmented wolf eradication. This pursuit of wolves combined with habitat loss to drive wolves out of most areas across North America. Wyoming, Idaho, Montana and Yellowstone National Park had reached total wolf eradication by the 1930s. Gray Wolf. Protection and reintroduction The gray wolf was provided protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1974. ESA protection made it illegal to kill wolves or destroy their habitats. Listing wolves under the ESA also initiated the production of a recovery plan. The recovery originally planned for wolf recovery through natural wolf dispersal from Canada but was later modified. In 1994 U.S. Fish and Wildlife submitted a report to congress recommending wolves be reestablished in Idaho and Yellowstone National Park as nonessential experimental populations. In March 1995 3 groups of 6, 5 and 3 wolves were released into Yellowstone National Park. This release marked the beginning of a successful reintroduction effort coordinated with multiple wildlife agencies from multiple U.S. States and Canadian Provinces. A total of 31 wolves were released in Yellowstone National Park. U.S. Fish and Wildlife and Wyoming Game and Fish Officials carry a reintroduced wolf to an acclimation pen. Proposed removal from ESA The Gray wolf in Wyoming is on the verge of being removed from the Endangered Species Act. Removal has been approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Wyoming Game and Fish. The wolf management plan that has been agreed upon by all parties requires a minimum of 100 wolves including ten breeding pairs in Wyoming. Currently there are 1650 wolves and 110 breeding pairs in Wyoming Idaho and Montana. Wolf numbers have exceeded recovery goals for the past 11 years. U.S. Fish and Wildlife will continue to collaborate with Wyoming Game and Fish following delisting from the ESA. Delisting will also allow Wyoming to implement a wolf trophy hunting season for wolves outside Yellowstone National Park. Tactics used during the removal process have been highly political. The Casper Star Tribune reported that Wyoming Senator John Barrasso placed a hold on a senate vote on the nomination of Daniel Ashe as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Director. Barrasso lifted the hold following a commitment from Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar to ‚Äúaggressively pursue a solution‚Äù to the wolf delisting dispute. Arguments and organizations for delisting Groups for delisting include, Wyoming Game and Fish, Wyoming Governor Matt Mead, hunting public, hunting outfitters, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation (CSF), National Rifle Association (NRA), Safari Club International (SCI), Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation (RMEF), American Sheep Industry Association and National Cattlemen's Beef Association. The primary argument for delisting is that wolf population numbers are well above recovery levels. This recovery indicates that the wolves are ready to be managed at a state level. Several groups believe that high wolf numbers are detrimental to elk and moose populations sharing the same habitat. Other conservation groups want wolf management at the state level so that stakeholders have more say in management decisions. Arguments and organizations against delisting Earlier attempts in 2008 and 2009 to delist the Gray Wolf were prevented with lawsuits from the Sierra Club. There are various groups against removing the gray wolf. Groups opposing delisting include Defenders of Wildlife, Western Wildlife Conservancy, Sierra Club and others. Arguments against delisting wolves include fear of overexploitation through trophy hunting, and a population crash. Idaho, Montana and Wyoming all plan to have a trophy game season for wolves following delisting. In addition to a trophy season, wolves found outside the trophy area of Wyoming may be shot as a predator, no license required. Additionally, several groups worry that removal from ESA could undermine authority of the endangered species act. =Sage grouse= Greater Sage Grouse Dwindling sage grouse populations have sparked heated debate over Wyoming's natural resource industry. The PAPA covers a large portion of the sage grouse's habitat. The area consists of about 200,000 acres of land, much of it covered with sagebrush, the grouse's landscape it requires to survive. The three largest operators in the PAPA are Ultra Resources, Shell Rocky Mountain Production, LLC and Questar Exploration and Production Company. Together these companies funded a five-year sage grouse study examining the impact of natural gas development on the birds‚Äô winter habitat, at a cost of $1.4 million. According to the Greater sage-grouse winter habitat selection 2009 report, the study results suggested that the sage grouse were avoiding industry activity areas with truck traffic, but not avoiding well sites with pipelines, or liquid gathering systems installed.Wyoming Wildlife Consultants, LLC.

Despite the sage grouse population having declined 90% in the past hundred years, and despite the loss of about half of their habitat in that same time, reports claim that efforts by state governments and the oil and gas industry have managed to keep the numbers stable, in localized areas, in the past decade. Those actions prevented the bird from being listed as endangered or threatened.Gruver, Mead. \\"Sage Grouse Won‚Äôt Make Endangered Species List.\\" Helenair.com -Helena, Montana Daily News.

He was influential as an author, lecturer, and historian. He is a co-founder of the National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis (American Lung Association) and was the first to advocate its formation as early as 1898.  Biography  Flick was born 10 August 1856 on a farm near Carrolltown, Pennsylvania, to John Flick and Elizabeth Sharbaugh. His family had immigrated to Pennsylvania to avoid religious persecution in Strasbourg, France, following Prince Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin to Cambria County so that the family could freely practice their Catholic faith. He attended Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, and Jefferson Medical College, in Philadelphia, PA. Graduating from medical school in 1879 he started a general practice in medicine. He started his specialization in tuberculosis treatment and research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1882. A complete biography of Dr. Flick, including how his family came to America, how he entered the medical field and what led to the study of tuberculous is contained in 'The Beloved Crusader' a book written by his daughter, Ella who was a novelist in her own right. See reference section below. In September 1890 he incorporated Rush Hospital for Consumption and Allied Diseases. He formed the Pennsylvania Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, the first organization of this type in the world in 1892. He was the first to theorize that TB was an airborne contagious disease, and not hereditary or a social scourge. In 1898 Dr. Flick first discussed the creation of a national association. The National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis, which later became the American Lung Association, was formed in 1904. Dr. Flick chaired the second annual meeting in 1906 when the society adopted the double-barred Lorraine Cross as its symbol. In 1901 he founded the White Haven Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis; and served as its director until 1935. In the first year of operation, the sanatorium was visited by industrialist and philanthropist Henry Phipps, Jr. In 1903 with a generous donation, Flick opened the Henry Phipps Institute for the Study, Treatment, and Prevention of Tuberculosis in Philadelphia, PA. He served as its Director of the Institute until 1910 when it became part of the University of Pennsylvania. He was one of the founders of the American Catholic Historical Society and served as its President from 1893‚Äì96 and again from 1913-14. He was a co-founder or the American Catholic Historical Association in 1919 and served as its first president in 1920. Flick was the recipient of the Laetare Medal in 1920 from the University of Notre Dame. He considered this one of his greatest honors. Dr. Flick is buried with his family at Old Saint Mary's Church, 5th & Locust Street, Philadelphia, PA, in the cemetery in a family plot which sits along the wall of the Church.  Legacy  The Pennsylvania State Lawrence Flick State Hospital operated in Cresson, Pennsylvania from 1956 to 1982. In 1998 the Lawrence F. Flick Memorial Center opened in Philadelphia. The facility is operated by the City of Philadelphia and the American Lung Association as a publicly funded tuberculosis clinic.

A .218 career hitter, Reeser excelled at slap bunting for base hits.

Her most productive season came in 1947, when she posted career numbers in batting average (.231) and hits (92), while committing only 27 errors in fielding chances to lead all first-sackers with her aforementioned .990 mark. She also set an all-time single season record for the most sacrifice bunts (39) and stole a second career best 36 bases. Late in the season, her teammate Doris Sams hurled a 2‚Äì0 perfect game against Dorothy Wiltse and the Fort Wayne Daisies. A RBI-single by Alva Jo Fischer in the fifth inning and a RBI-double by Reeser in the eight represented the only runs of the game, in what otherwise was a strong pitching duel.SABR Biography Project ‚Äì Doris Sams by Jim Sargent Reeser batted .223 in 1948, while matching her career 110 games played, and finished second in fielding average (.986), slightly exceeded by Grand Rapids' Inez Voyce (.989).

The Toolkit is funded by the National Institute of Health's National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) with co-funding by the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Supplemental funding is provided by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD). The PhenX Toolkit is available to the scientific community at no cost. For genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other studies involving human subjects, the use of standard measures can facilitate cross-study analyses. Such analyses compare independent findings to validate results or combine studies to increase sample size and statistical power. This increased power makes it possible to identify more subtle and complex associations such as gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. The Toolkit provides assessments for 24 research domains. In addition to measures, PhenX also defines protocols. There may be multiple protocols defined for a measure. For example, for smoking cessation, there is an adult protocol and adolescent protocol.

The main organizer of the 2012 OTRP, Pete Thottam, is a Los Angeles based Occupy volunteer, attorney and longtime antiwar activist. Phase 1 of the demonstration was on Sunday, January 1. It was organized by a separate group from the Occupy Pasadena group protesting locally, with no affiliation or endorsement between the two although a number of members of Occupy Pasadena actively participated in and helped organize the Occupy The Rose Parade demonstration. Rose Parade and Pasadena officials authorized the Occupy the Rose Parade movement to march at the end of the parade, after all the floats have passed and the phalanx of police cars moves through, but while the crowd is still in place. The protest's central human float action was a peaceful and nonviolent protest with no arrests.

Retrieved 11-25-2011. Native to central north America, purple prairie clover is a relatively common member of the Great Plains and prairie ecosystems. It blooms in the summer with dense spikes of bright purple flowers that attract many species of insects. Distribution It is native to central North America, where it occurs from central Canada to the southeastern and southwestern United States, except for the east and west coasts. It is a common and widespread plant within its range, especially on the Great Plains. In 1804, Meriwether Lewis collected a specimen in Nebraska. Description Dalea purpurea is a perennial herb growing tall. The mature plant has a large taproot deep. The stem is woody with several branches. The leaves are a few centimeters long and are divided into 3 to 7 narrow leaflets. The inflorescence atop each stem branch is a spike up to long containing many purple flowers. The fruit is a legume pod containing 1 or 2 seeds. Ecology This plant is adapted to a habitat with periodic wildfires. In some areas, it depends on fire to clear encroaching woody vegetation, as it cannot tolerate shade. Dalea purpurea is a common member of the flora on the plains of central North America, occurring in a variety of habitat types, including several types of grassland. It occurs in glades, riverbanks and floodplains, oak woodlands, pinyon-juniper woodlands, shrubsteppe, many types of forests, and the Sand Hills of Nebraska. It occurs in a variety of prairie ecosystems. On tallgrass prairie it is associated with plants such as little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), prairie Junegrass (Koeleria macrantha), prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis), lead plant (Amorpha canescens), and silky aster (Symphyotrichum sericeum). On midgrass prairie it grows alongside several grasses such as silver bluestem (Bothriochloa saccharoides), purple threeawn (Aristida purpurea), sideoats grama (Bouteloua curtipendula), and sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus). On shortgrass prairie it is associated with grasses such as blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), hairy grama (B. hirsuta), and buffalo grass (B. dactyloides). This species may be considered an indicator of pristine prairie. The nectar and pollen of Dalea purpurea attract many bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, and skippers. Several plasterer bees (genus Colletes) are specialist pollinators of Dalea species, and other insects eat the seeds and leaves. It is a larval host to the southern dogface (Zerene cesonia). Uses This species is used for revegetation efforts on reclaimed land, such as land that has been strip mined. It is good for preventing erosion and for fixing nitrogen in soil. Though it is often found in mid- to late-successional stages of ecological succession, it may also be a pioneer species, taking hold in bare and disturbed habitat, such as roadsides. Purple prairie clover provides food for a number of animals, such as pronghorn. It also grows in cultivated fields and becomes included in hay for livestock. It is nutritious and is \\"considered one of the most important legumes in native grasslands on the Great Plains.\\" It also had a number of uses for Native Americans. The leaves are edible and good for making tea and medicines, and the roots are palatable when chewed. The stems were used as brooms by the Pawnee people. =Medicinal plant= Dalea purpurea has been found to contain several active constituents, including pawhuskin A, pawhuskin B, pawhuskin C, and petalostemumol. The pawhuskins possess affinity for the opioid receptors, and pawhuskin A, by far the most potent of the group, acts as a non-selective antagonist of all three opioid receptors, with preference for the Œ∫- and Œº-opioid receptors over the Œ¥-opioid receptor.

Faur√©'s major sets of piano works are thirteen nocturnes, thirteen barcarolles, six impromptus, and four valses-caprices. These sets were composed during several decades in his long career, and display the change in his style from uncomplicated youthful charm to a final enigmatic, but sometimes fiery introspection, by way of a turbulent period in his middle years. His other notable piano pieces, including shorter works, or collections composed or published as a set, are Romances sans paroles, Ballade in F major, Mazurka in B major, Th√®me et variations in C major, and Huit pi√®ces br√®ves. For piano duet, Faur√© composed the Dolly Suite and, together with his friend and former pupil Andr√© Messager, an exuberant parody of Wagner in the short suite Souvenirs de Bayreuth. Much of Faur√©'s piano music is difficult to play, but is rarely virtuosic in style. The composer disliked showy display, and the predominant characteristic of his piano music is a classical restraint and understatement. Introduction Although for much of his career he made his living as a church organist, Faur√© greatly preferred the piano.Nectoux (1991), p. 41 He never underestimated the challenges in composing for the instrument; he wrote, \\"In piano music there's no room for padding ‚Äì one has to pay cash and make it consistently interesting. It's perhaps the most difficult genre of all.\\"Nectoux (1991), p. 380 (2004 1st paperback edition) Although his publishers insisted on descriptive titles, Faur√© said that his own preference would be for utilitarian labels such as \\"Piano piece No X\\". His works for the piano are marked by a classical French lucidity;Slonimsky, Nicholas. \\"Faur√©, Gabriel (-Urbain)\\", Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, Schirmer Reference, New York, 2001, accessed 8 September 2010 he was unimpressed by pianistic display, commenting of keyboard virtuosi, \\"the greater they are, the worse they play me.\\"Nectoux (1991), p. 379 Even a virtuoso such as Franz Liszt said that he found Faur√©'s music hard to play: at his first attempt he said to Faur√©, \\"I've run out of fingers\\".Nectoux (1991), p. 51 Faur√©'s years as an organist influenced the way he laid out his keyboard works, often using arpeggiated figures, with themes distributed between the two hands, requiring fingerings more natural for organists than pianists.Jones, p. 51. This tendency may have been even stronger because Faur√© was ambidextrous, and he was not always inclined to follow the convention that the melody is in the right hand and the accompaniment in the left. His old friend and former teacher Camille Saint-Sa√´ns wrote to him in 1917, \\"Ah! if there is a god for the left hand, I should very much like to know him and make him an offering when I am disposed to play your music; the 2nd Valse-Caprice is terrible in this respect; I have however managed to get to the end of it by dint of absolute determination.\\"Nectoux and Jones, pp. 118‚Äì119 As a man, Faur√© was said to possess \\"that mysterious gift that no other can replace or surpass: charm\\",Morrison, p. 14 and charm is a conspicuous feature of many of his early compositions. His early piano works are influenced in style by Chopin, and throughout his life he composed piano works using similar titles to those of Chopin, notably nocturnes and barcarolles. An even greater influence was Schumann, whose piano music Faur√© loved more than any other.Nectoux (1991), p. 43 The authors of The Record Guide (1955) wrote that Faur√© learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart, tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin, \\"and from Schumann, the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound, and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated.\\"Sackville-West, pp. 263‚Äì64 When Faur√© was a student at the √âcole Niedermeyer his tutor had introduced him to new concepts of harmony, no longer outlawing certain chords as \\"dissonant\\". By using unresolved mild discords and colouristic effects, Faur√© anticipated the techniques of Impressionist composers. In later years Faur√©'s music was written under the shadow of the composer's increasing deafness, becoming gradually less charming and more austere, marked by what the composer Aaron Copland called \\"intensity on a background of calm.\\" The critic Bryce Morrison has noted that pianists frequently prefer to play the accessible earlier piano works, rather than the later music, which expresses \\"such private passion and isolation, such alternating anger and resignation\\" that listeners are left uneasy.Morrison, p. 7 The Faur√© scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux writes: Nocturnes Faur√© in 1875 The nocturnes, along with the barcarolles, are generally regarded as the composer's greatest piano works.Morrison, p. 12 Faur√© greatly admired the music of Chopin, and was happy to compose in forms and patterns established by the earlier composer. Morrison notes that Faur√©'s nocturnes follow Chopin's model, contrasting serene outer sections with livelier or more turbulent central episodes. The composer's son Philippe commented that the nocturnes \\"are not necessarily based on r√™veries or on emotions inspired by the night. They are lyrical, generally impassioned pieces, sometimes anguished or wholly elegiac.\\"Quoted in Nectoux (1991), p. 48 ;Nocturne No 1 in E minor, Op. 33/1 (c.1875) Nectoux rates the first nocturne as one of the best of the composer's early works.Nectoux (1991), p. 49 It is dedicated, like Faur√©'s song \\"Apr√®s un r√™ve\\", to his friend and early patron .Nectoux (1991), p. 34 Morrison calls the piece \\"cloistered and elegiac.\\" Though published as the composer's Op. 33/1 in 1883, it was written considerably earlier. It opens with a slow, pensive melody, followed by a more agitated second theme and another melody in C major, and ends with the return of the opening theme.Bricard, p. 15 The pianist and academic Sally Pinkas writes that the work contains many hallmarks of Faur√©'s style, including \\"undulating rhythms, syncopation of the accompaniment against the melody and layered textures are already in evidence.\\"Pinkas, p. 5 ;Nocturne No 2 in B major, Op. 33/2 (c.1880) The second nocturne opens with a bell-like passage, andantino espressivo, recalling ‚Äì although Faur√© said it was unconscious ‚Äì the sound of distant bells that he heard frequently when a boy.Nectoux (1991), p. 92 Nectoux singles out \\"the light footed episode in alternating fifths and sixths\\" and its extremely delicate passagework, and points to the influence of Faur√©'s former teacher Saint-Sa√´ns in the allegro ma non troppo toccata section. Saint-Sa√´ns himself declared the piece \\"absolutely entrancing.\\"Jones, p. 61 ;Nocturne No 3 in A major, Op. 33/3 (c.1882) In the third nocturne, Morrison notes that the composer's fondness for syncopation is at its gentlest, \\"nostalgia lit by passion.\\" Like its predecessors, it is in tripartite form. An expansive melody with syncopated left-hand accompaniment leads into a middle section in which a dolcissimo theme metamorphoses into bursts of passion.Pinkas, p. 6 The return of the opening section is concluded by a gentle coda that introduces new harmonic subtleties. ;Nocturne No 4 in E major, Op. 36 (c.1884) The fourth nocturne, dedicated to the Comtesse de Mercy-Argenteau, contrasts a lyrical opening section and an episode in E minor with a sombre theme recalling the tolling of a bell. The first theme returns and is followed by a short coda. The pianist Alfred Cortot, generally a great admirer of Faur√©, found the piece \\"rather too satisfied with its languor.\\" ;Nocturne No 5 in B major, Op. 37 (c.1884) By contrast with its predecessor, the fifth nocturne is more animated, with unexpected shifts into remote keys. Nectoux writes of its undulating outline, and the \\"almost improvisatory, questioning character\\" of the opening. Faur√© by John Singer Sargent, 1896 ;Nocturne No 6 in D major, Op. 63 (1894) The sixth nocturne, dedicated to Eug√®ne d'Eichthal, is widely held to be one of the finest of the series. Cortot said, \\"There are few pages in all music comparable to these.\\" Morrison calls it \\"among the most rich and eloquent of all Faur√©'s piano works.\\" The pianist and writer Nancy Bricard calls it \\"one of the most passionate and moving works in piano literature.\\" Faur√© wrote it after a six-year break from composing for the piano. The piece begins with an emotional, outpouring phrase, with echoes of Faur√©'s song cycle La bonne chanson. The second theme, at first seemingly tranquil, has what the composer Charles Koechlin calls a persistent inquietude, emphasised by the syncopated accompaniment. The initial theme returns, and is followed by a substantial development of a gentle, contemplative melody. A recapitulation of the principal theme takes the piece to its conclusion. Copland wrote that it was with this work that Faur√© first fully emerged from the shadow of Chopin, and he said of the piece, \\"The breath and dignity of the opening melody, the restless C sharp minor section which follows (with the peculiar syncopated harmonies so often and so well used by Faur√©), the graceful fluidity of the third idea: all these elements are brought to a stormy climax in the short development section; then, after a pause, comes the return of the consoling first page.\\"Copland, Aaron. \\"Gabriel Faur√©, a Neglected Master\\". The Musical Quarterly, October 1924, pp. 573‚Äì586, Oxford University Press, accessed 20 August 2010 ;Nocturne No 7 in C minor, Op. 74 (1898) The seventh nocturne departs from the A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA form of Faur√©'s earlier nocturnes; in Pinkas's view is it constructed more like a ballade than a nocturne.Pinkas, p. 8 It opens with a slow (molto lento) theme of harmonic ambiguity, followed by a second theme, equally ambiguous in key, though nominally in D major. The central section is in F major, and the re-emergence of the first theme brings the piece to a conclusion.Anderson (1993), p. 3 Morrison finds in this piece a sense of bleakness, and of the composer's struggle against despair. Pinkas, however, regards the work as a \\"contrast between ambiguity and joy, ending in reassurance.\\"Pinkas, p. 9 It is sometimes known as the \\"English\\" nocturne, having been composed while Faur√© was staying in the UK, and being dedicated to the English pianist Adela Maddison.Orledge, pp. 95 and 303 ;Nocturne No 8 in D major, Op. 84/8 (1902) Faur√© did not intend the eighth nocturne to appear under that designation. His publisher collected eight short piano pieces together and published them as 8 pi√®ces br√®ves, allocating each of them a title unauthorised by the composer. The nocturne, the last piece in the set of eight, is shorter and less complex than its immediate predecessor, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand.Anderson (1993), pp. 3‚Äì4 Title page of the Ninth nocturne, 1908 ;Nocturne No 9 in B minor, Op. 97 (1908) The ninth nocturne, dedicated to Cortot's wife, Clotilde Br√©al, is the first of three that share a directness and sparseness in contrast with the more elaborate structures and textures of their predecessors.Nectoux (1991), pp. 381 and 584 The left-hand accompaniment to the melodic line is simple and generally unvaried, and the harmony looks forward to later composers of the 20th century, using a whole tone scale. Most of the piece is inward-looking and pensive, presaging the style of Faur√©'s final works, although it ends optimistically in a major key.Pinkas, pp. 9‚Äì10 ;Nocturne No 10 in E minor, Op. 99 (1908) Like its immediate predecessor, the tenth nocturne is on a smaller scale than those of Faur√©'s middle period. In contrast with the ninth, however, the tenth is darker and angrier. The composer applies the A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA form less rigorously than in earlier nocturnes, and the opening bars of the piece recur intermittently throughout, eventually building to a fierce climax, described by Morrison as \\"a slow central climb ... that inhabits a world of nightmare.\\" The piece ends with a calm coda.Pinkas, p. 10 It is dedicated to Madame Brunet-Lecomte. ;Nocturne No 11 in F minor, Op. 104/1 (1913) The eleventh nocturne was written in memory of No√©mi Lalo; her widower, Pierre Lalo, was a music critic and a friend and supporter of Faur√©.Bricard, p. 16 Morrison suggests that its funereal effect of tolling bells may also reflect the composer's own state of anguish, with deafness encroaching. The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac. ;Nocturne No 12 in E minor, Op. 107 (1915) With the twelfth nocturne Faur√© returned to the scale and complexity of his middle-period works, but both melodically and harmonically it is much harder to comprehend. There are deliberate dissonances and harmonic ambiguities that Pinkas describes as \\"taking tonality to its limit while still maintaining a single key.\\"Pinkas, p. 11 Morrison writes that \\"the ecstatic song of No 6 is transformed in a central section where lyricism is soured by dissonance, held up, as it were, to a distorting mirror.\\" The work is in Faur√©'s customary nocturne form, A‚ÄìB‚ÄìA, but with a reiteration of the material of the second section, harmonically transformed, followed by a coda that draws on material from the opening section. ;Nocturne No 13 in B minor, Op. 119 (1921) Faur√© scholars are generally agreed that the last nocturne ‚Äì which was the last work he wrote for the piano ‚Äì is among the greatest of the set. Nectoux writes that along with the sixth, it is \\"incontestably the most moving and inspired of the series.\\"Nectoux (1991), p. 438 Bricard calls it \\"the most inspired and beautiful in the series.\\" For Pinkas, the work \\"achieves a perfect equilibrium between late-style simplicity and full-textured passionate expression.\\" The work opens in a \\"pure, almost rarefied atmosphere\\" (Nectoux), with a \\"tone of noble, gentle supplication ... imposing gravity and ... rich expressive four part writing.\\" This is followed by an allegro, \\"a true middle section in a virtuoso manner, ending in a bang\\" (Pinkas). The repeat of the opening section completes the work. Barcarolles Long shot of Faur√© with Winnaretta Singer and others on the balcony of the Palazzo Volkoff, Venice, 1891 Barcarolles were originally folk songs sung by Venetian gondoliers. In Morrison's phrase, Faur√©'s use of the term was more convenient than precise. Faur√© was not attracted by fanciful titles for musical pieces, and maintained that he would not use even such generic titles as \\"barcarolle\\" if his publishers did not insist. His son Philippe recalled, \\"he would far rather have given his Nocturnes, Impromptus, and even his Barcarolles the simple title Piano Piece no. so-and-so.\\"Nectoux (1991), p. 48 Nevertheless, following the precedents of Chopin and most conspicuously Mendelssohn, Faur√© made extensive use of the barcarolle, in what his biographer Jessica Duchen calls \\"an evocation of the rhythmic rocking and lapping of water around appropriately lyrical melodies.\\"Duchen (2011), p. 5 Faur√©'s ambidexterity is reflected in the layout of many of his piano works, notably in the barcarolles, where the main melodic line is often in the middle register, with the accompaniments in the high treble part of the keyboard as well as in the bass.Nectoux (1991), p. 46 Duchen likens the effect of this in the barcarolles to that of a reflection shining up through the water. Like the nocturnes, the barcarolles span nearly the whole of Faur√©'s composing career, and they similarly display the evolution of his style from the uncomplicated charm of the early pieces to the withdrawn and enigmatic quality of the late works.Morrison, p. 10 All are written with compound time signatures (6/8, 9/8, or 6/4). ;Barcarolle No 1 in A minor, Op. 26 (1880) The first barcarolle was dedicated to the pianist Caroline de Serres (Mme. Caroline Montigny-R√©maury) and premiered by Saint- Sa√´ns at a concert of the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique in 1882.Anderson (1996), pp. 3‚Äì5 The piece begins with an uncomplicated melody in a traditional lilting Venetian style in 6/8 time.Morrison, p. 11 It develops into a more elaborate form before the introduction of the second theme, in which the melodic line is given in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated accompaniments in the treble and bass.Duchen (2011), p. 6 Morrison comments that even in this early work, conventional sweetness is enlivened by subtle dissonance. ;Barcarolle No 2 in G major, Op. 41 (1885) The second barcarolle, dedicated to the pianist Marie Poitevin, is a longer and more ambitious work than the first, with what Morrison calls an Italianate profusion of detail. Duchen writes of the work as complex and questing, harmonically and melodically, and points to the influence of Saint-Sa√´ns, Liszt and even, unusually for Faur√©, of Wagner. The work opens in 6/8 time like the first, but Faur√© varies the time signature to an unexpected 9/8 in the middle of the piece. ;Barcarolle No 3 in G major, Op. 42 (1885) The third barcarolle is dedicated to Henriette Roger-Jourdain, wife of Faur√©'s friend, the painter . It opens with a simple phrase that is quickly elaborated into trills reminiscent of Chopin. The middle section, like that of the first, keeps the melody in the middle register with delicate arpeggiated ornaments above and below. The pianist Marguerite Long said that these ornaments \\"crown the theme like sea foam.\\" ;Barcarolle No 4 in A major, Op. 44 (1886) One of the best- known of the set,Koechlin, p. 37 the fourth barcarolle is \\"tuneful, quite short, perhaps more direct than the others.\\" (Koechlin). Faur√© in the mid-1890s ;Barcarolle No 5 in F minor, Op. 66 (1894) Dedicated to Mme la Baronne V. d'Indy, the fifth barcarolle was written after a five-year period in which Faur√© composed nothing for the piano. Orledge calls it powerful, agitated and virile. It is the first of Faur√©'s piano works in which there are no identifiable sections; its changes are in metre, not in tempo.Orledge, p. 93 ;Barcarolle No 6 in E major, Op. 70 (1896) Koechlin brackets the sixth and seventh of the set together as a contrasting pair. Both pieces show \\"an economy of writing\\", the sixth \\"more moderate and tranquil in expression\\". The Faur√© scholar Roy Howat writes of a \\"sensuous insouciance\\" with an underlying virtuosity and wit under the \\"deceptively nonchalant surface\\". ;Barcarolle No 7 in D minor, Op. 90 (1905) The seventh barcarolle contrasts with its predecessor in being more restless and sombre, recalling Faur√©'s \\"Cr√©puscule\\" from his song cycle La chanson d'√àve.Koechlin, p. 38 ;Barcarolle No 8 in D major, Op. 96 (1906) Dedicated to Suzanne Alfred-Bruneau,Phillips, p. 79 the eighth barcarolle opens in with a cheerful theme, which soon gives way to melancholy. The second episode, in C minor, marked cantabile, is succeeded by an abrupt ending with a fortissimo chord.Nectoux (1991), p. 381 ;Barcarolle No 9 in A minor, Op. 101 (1909) The ninth barcarolle, in Koechlin's view, \\"recalls, as in a hazy remoteness, the happiness of the past\\". Nectoux writes that it consists of \\"a series of harmonic or polyphonic variations on a strange, sombre, syncopated theme, whose monotony recalls some sailor's song\\".Nectoux (1991), p. 382 Manuscript of the opening of the eleventh barcarolle ;Barcarolle No 10 in A minor, Op. 104/2 (1913) Dedicated to Madame L√©on Blum,Phillips, p. 122 the tenth barcarolle stays more closely within conventional tonality than its predecessor, \\"with a certain sedate gravity ... the monotony appropriate to a grey evening\\" (Koechlin). The melancholy theme is reminiscent of Mendelssohn's Venetian themes from Songs Without Words, but is developed in a way characteristic of Faur√©, with \\"increasingly animated rhythms and, at certain points, excessively complex textures\\" (Nectoux).Nectoux (1991), p. 385 ;Barcarolle No 11 in G minor, Op. 105 (1913) Dedicated to Laura, daughter of the composer Isaac Alb√©niz. The eleventh and twelfth of the set can be viewed as another contrasting pair. The eleventh is severe in mood and in rhythm, reflecting the prevailing austerity of Faur√©'s later style. ;Barcarolle No 12 in E major, Op. 106bis (1915) Dedicated to Louis Di√©mer,Phillips, p. 81 the twelfth barcarolle is an allegretto giocoso. It opens in what was by now for Faur√© a rare uncomplicated theme, in the traditional Venetian manner, but is developed in more subtle rhythms. Despite the increasing complexity of the polyphonic lines, Faur√© keeps the melody prominent, and the piece ends with it transformed into \\"a theme of almost triumphal character\\" (Nectoux).Nectoux (1991), p. 391 ;Barcarolle No 13 in C major, Op. 116 (1921) The last of the set is dedicated to Magda Gumaelius.Phillips, p. 118 Koechlin writes of it: \\"bare, superficially almost dry, but at heart most expressive with that deep nostalgia for vanished bright horizons: sentiments that the composer suggests in passing rather than comments on in loquacious or theatrical oratory; he seemed to desire to preserve the soothing and illusory serenity of the mirage.\\" Impromptus ;Impromptu No 1 in E major, Op. 25 (1881) Cortot compared the first impromptu to a rapid barcarolle, redolent of \\"sunlit water\\", combining \\"stylised coquetry and regret\\". ;Impromptu No 2 in F minor, Op. 31 (1883) Dedicated to Mlle Sacha de Rebina, the second impromptu maintains an airy tarantella rhythm. It is scored less richly than the first of the set, giving it a lightness of texture. ;Impromptu No 3 in A major, Op. 34 (1883) The third impromptu is the most popular of the set. Morrison calls it \\"among Faur√©'s most idyllic creations, its principal idea dipping and soaring above a gyrating, moto perpetuo accompaniment\\". It is marked by a combination of dash and delicacy. ;Impromptu No 4 in D major, Op. 91 (1906) Dedicated to \\"Madame de Marliave\\" (Marguerite Long),Phillips, p. 80 the fourth impromptu was Faur√©'s return to the genre in his middle period. Unlike much of his music of the period, it avoids a dark mood, but Faur√© had by now moved on from the uncomplicated charm of the first three of the set. His mature style is displayed in the central section, a contemplative andante, which is followed by a more agitated section that concludes the work. ;Impromptu No 5 in F minor, Op. 102 (1909) Nectoux describes this impromptu as \\"a piece of sheer virtuosity celebrating, not without humour, the beauties of the whole-tone scale.\\" Morrison, however, writes that the work \\"seethes with unrest\\". ;Impromptu in D major, Op. 86 bis (Transcription of the Impromptu for harp, Op. 86, 1904) The last work in the published set was written before numbers four and five. It was originally a harp piece, composed for a competition at the Paris Conservatoire in 1904. Cortot made a transcription for piano, published in 1913 as Faur√©'s Op. 86 bis.Cochard, p. 5 The outer sections are light and brilliant, with a gentler central section, marked meno mosso.Morrison, p. 8 Valses-caprices The four valses-caprices are not a cycle, but rather two sets of two, the first from Faur√©'s early period and the second from his middle period.Morrison, p. 3 Morrison calls all four \\"more 'caprice' than 'waltz, and comments that they combine and develop the scintillating style of Chopin and Saint-Sa√´ns waltzes. They show Faur√© at his most playful, presenting variations before the theme is heard and darting in and out of unexpected keys. Aaron Copland, though generally a keen admirer of Faur√©'s music, wrote, \\"the several Valses-Caprices, in spite of their admirable qualities, seem to me essentially foreign to Faure's esprit. His is too orderly, too logical a mind to be really capricious.\\" Cortot, by contrast, spoke approvingly of their \\"sensual grace ... perfect distinction ... impassioned tenderness.\\"Koechlin, p. 33 ;Valse-caprice No 1 in A major, Op. 30 (1882); and ;Valse-caprice No 2 in D major, Op. 38 (1884): Chopin's influence is marked in the first two pieces. Orledge observes that the right-hand figuration at the end of No 1 is remarkably similar to that at the end of Chopin's Waltz in E minor.Orledge, p. 60 In No 2 Nectoux detects the additional influence of Liszt (Au bord d'une source) in the opening bars.Nectoux (1991), p. 52 In the closing bars of No 2, Orledge finds a resemblance to the end of Chopin's Grande Valse Brillante, Op, 18. ;Valse- caprice No 3 in G major, Op. 59 (1887‚Äì93); and ;Valse-caprice No 4 in A major, Op. 62 (1893‚Äì94): Orledge writes that the second two valses-caprices are subtler and better integrated than the first two; they contain \\"more moments of quiet contemplation and more thematic development than before.\\" There still remain touches of virtuosity and traces of Liszt, and these two valses- caprices are, in Orledge's words, the only solo pieces in the middle period to end in a loud and spectacular manner.Orledge, p. 2 No 3 is dedicated to Mme. Philippe Dieterlen, No 4 to Mme. Max Lyon.Phillips, p. 129 Other solo piano works =Romances sans paroles, Op. 17= Faur√© as a student in 1864 Faur√© wrote these three \\"songs without words\\" while still a student at the √âcole Niedermeyer, in about 1863. They were not published until 1880, but they then became some of his most popular works. Copland considered them immature pieces, which \\"should be relegated to the indiscretions every young composer commits.\\" Later critics have taken a less severe view; Morrison describes the Romances as \\"an affectionate and very Gallic tribute to Mendelssohn's urbanity, agitation and ease.\\" The commentator Keith Anderson writes that although they were a popular French counterpart to Mendelssohn's Songs without Words, Faur√©'s own voice is already recognisable. Instead of placing the slowest piece in the middle of the set and ending with the lively A minor piece, Faur√©, already with musical views of his own, switches the expected order, and the set ends pianissimo, fading to nothing.Anderson (1993), p. 4 ;Andante quasi allegretto The first romance, in A major, has as an opening theme an uncomplicated melody with Mendelssohnian syncopations. The theme is presented first in the higher and then in the middle register, before flowing evenly to its conclusion. ;Allegro molto The second romance, in A minor, an exuberant piece, has a strong semiquaver figure supporting the theme, and running high into the treble and low into the bass. This was later to become one of Faur√©'s most recognisable characteristics. After a lively display, the piece ends quietly. ;Andante moderato The final piece of the set, in A major, is a serene andante, with a flowing tune in the Mendelssohnian style. After gentle variation, it equally gently fades to silence at the end. =Ballade in F major, Op. 19= The Ballade, dedicated to Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, dates from 1877. It is one of Faur√©'s most substantial works for solo piano, but is better known in a version for piano and orchestra that he made in 1881 at Liszt's suggestion. Playing for a little over 14 minutes, it is second in length only to the Th√®me et variations.Morrison, pp. 3‚Äì5 Faur√© first conceived the music as a set of individual pieces, but then decided to make them into a single work by carrying the main theme of each section over into the following section as a secondary theme.Howat (Piano Works by Gabriel Faur√©) p. 7 The work opens with the F major theme, an andante cantabile, which is followed by a slower section, marked lento, in E minor. The third section is an andante introducing a third theme. In the last section, an allegro, a return of the second theme brings the work to a conclusion in which Nectoux comments, the treble sings with particular delicacy. Marcel Proust knew Faur√©, and the Ballade is thought to have been the inspiration for the sonata by Proust's character Vinteuil that haunts Swann in In Search of Lost Time. Debussy, reviewing an early performance of the Ballade, compared the music with the attractive soloist, straightening her shoulder-straps during the performance: \\"I don't know why, but I somehow associated the charm of these gestures with the music of Faur√© himself. The play of fleeting curves that is its essence can be compared to the movements of a beautiful woman without either suffering from the comparison.\\"Holloway, Robin. \\"Master of Hearts\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 136, No. 1830 (August 1995), pp. 394‚Äì396 Morrison describes the Ballade as \\"a reminder of halcyon, half-remembered summer days and bird-haunted forests\\". =Mazurka in B major, Op. 32= The Mazurka was composed in the mid-1870s but not published until 1883. It is a tribute to Chopin, and contains echoes of the earlier composer's music. Chopin, however, composed more than 60 mazurkas, and Faur√© wrote only this one. Morrison regards it as an experiment on Faur√©'s part. The piece owes little to Polish folk-dance rhythms, and may have had a Russian influence through Faur√©'s friendship with Sergei Taneyev at around the time of its composition.Howat (Antokoletz and Wheeldon), p. 44 =Pavane, Op. 50= The Pavane (1887) was conceived and originally written as an orchestral piece.Nectoux (1984), p. 130 Faur√© published the version for piano in 1889.Howat (2009), p. 155 In the form of an ancient dance, the piece was written to be played more briskly than it has generally come to be performed in its familiar orchestral guise. The conductor Sir Adrian Boult heard Faur√© play the piano version several times and noted that he took it at a tempo no slower than crochet=100.Howat (2009), p. 272 Boult commented that the composer's sprightly tempo emphasised that the Pavane was not a piece of German romanticism. =Th√®me et variations in C minor, Op. 73= Written in 1895, when he was 50, this is among Faur√©'s most extended compositions for piano,Duchen (2000), p. 117 with a performance time of about 15 minutes. Although it has many passages that reflect the influence of Schumann's Symphonic Studies, in Jessica Duchen's words \\"its harmonies and pianistic idioms\\" are unmistakably those of Faur√©. As in the earlier Romances sans paroles, Op. 17, Faur√© does not follow the conventional course of ending with the loudest and most extrovert variation; the variation nearest to that description is placed next to last, and is followed by a gentle conclusion, \\"a typically Faurean understated finish.\\" Copland wrote of the work: =Prelude to P√©n√©lope= Faur√©'s opera based on the legend of Ulysses and Penelope was first performed in 1913, after which the composer published a version of the prelude transcribed for piano. The piece, in G minor, contrasts a gravely noble andante moderato theme representing Penelope with a forthright theme for Ulysses. The polyphonic writing transfers effectively from the orchestral original to the piano. =8 Pi√®ces br√®ves, Op. 84= Faur√© in the gardens of the Conservatoire, 1918 Faur√© did not intend these pieces to be published as a set; they were composed as individual works between 1869 and 1902. When Hamelle, his publishers, insisted on issuing them together as \\"Eight Short Pieces\\" in 1902, the composer successfully demanded that none of the eight must be allocated its own title. When he moved on to another publisher, Hamelle ignored his earlier instructions and issued subsequent editions with titles for each piece. Nectoux comments that the labelling of the eighth piece as \\"Nocturne No 8\\" is particularly questionable (see Nocturne [No 8], below).Nectoux (1991), p. 299 In the first decade of the 21st century the publisher Peters issued a new critical edition of the Eight Pieces with the spurious titles removed.Howat (Piano Works by Gabriel Faur√©), p. 6 The eight pieces take less than three minutes each in performance.Morrison, p. 4 Capriccio in E major: Dedicated to Madame Jean Leonard Koechlin.Phillips, p. 133 Morrison calls it \\"capricious indeed\\", and notes a harmonic twist at the end \\"as nonchalant as it is acrobatic\\". It was originally written as a sight- reading test for students at the Paris Conservatoire, of which Faur√© was the professor of composition from 1896 and director from 1905 to 1920. Fantaisie in A major: Koechlin calls this piece a pleasant feuillet d'album.Koechlin, p. 35 Fugue in A minor: This, like the other fugue in the set, is a revised version of a fugue Faur√© composed at the start of his career, when he was a church organist in Rennes. They are both, in Koechlin's view \\"in a pleasant and correct style, obviously less rich than those in the Well-Tempered Clavier, and more careful, but whose reserve conceals an incontestable mastery\\". Adagietto in E minor: An andante moderato, \\"serious, grave, at once firm and pliant, attaining real beauty\\" (Koechlin). Improvisation in C minor: Orledge calls this piece a middle period \\"song without words\\".Orledge, p. 97 It was composed as a sight-reading test for the Conservatoire. Fugue in E minor: See Fugue in A minor, above. All√©gresse in C major: \\"A bubbling perpetuum mobile whose surging romantic feelings are only just kept under restraint\\" (Orledge).Orledge, pp. 97‚Äì98 \\"A song, pure and gay, uplifted to a sunlit sky, a youthful outpouring, full of happiness.\\" (Koechlin). Nocturne [No 8] in D major: As noted above, this piece stands apart from the larger- scale works to which Faur√© gave the title \\"nocturne\\". It would not be listed among them were it not for the publisher's unauthorised use of the title in this case. It is the longest of the eight pieces of Op. 84, but is much shorter and simpler than the other 12 nocturnes, consisting of a song-like main theme with a delicate semiquaver accompaniment in the left hand. =9 Pr√©ludes, Op. 103= Faur√©, next to the piano in his flat in the boulevard Malesherbes, Paris, 1905 The nine pr√©ludes are among the least known of Faur√©'s major piano compositions. They were written while the composer was struggling to come to terms with the onset of deafness in his mid- sixties.Cochard, p. 3 By Faur√©'s standards this was a time of unusually prolific output. The pr√©ludes were composed in 1909 and 1910, in the middle of the period in which he wrote the opera P√©n√©lope, barcarolles Nos. 8‚Äì11 and nocturnes Nos. 9‚Äì11. In Koechlin's view, \\"Apart from the Pr√©ludes of Chopin, it is hard to think of a collection of similar pieces that are so important\\". The critic Michael Oliver wrote, \\"Faur√©'s Pr√©ludes are among the subtlest and most elusive piano pieces in existence; they express deep but mingled emotions, sometimes with intense directness ... more often with the utmost economy and restraint and with mysteriously complex simplicity.\\"Oliver, Michael. \\"Faur√© ‚Äì Nine Pr√©ludes\\", Gramophone, January 1988, p. 48 Jessica Duchen calls them \\"unusual slivers of magical inventiveness.\\"Duchen (2000), p. 159 The complete set takes between 20 and 25 minutes to play. The shortest of the set, No 8, lasts barely more than a minute; the longest, No 3, takes between four and five minutes.Morrison, p. 5 ;Pr√©lude No 1 in D major Andante molto moderato. The first pr√©lude is in the manner of a nocturne. Morrison refers to the cool serenity with which it opens, contrasted with the \\"slow and painful climbing\\" of the middle section.Morrison, p. 13 ;Pr√©lude No 2 in C minor Allegro. The moto perpetuo of the second pr√©lude is technically difficult for the pianist; even the most celebrated Faur√© interpreter can be stretched by it.Smith, Harriet. \\"Faur√© Franck\\", Gramophone, May 2007, p. 101 Koechlin calls it \\"a feverish whirling of dervishes, concluding in a sort of ecstasy, with the evocation of some fairy palace.\\" ;Pr√©lude No 3 in G minor Andante. Copland considered this pr√©lude the most immediately accessible of the set. \\"At first, what will most attract you, will be the third in G-minor, a strange mixture of the romantic and classic.\\" The musicologist Vladimir Jank√©l√©vitch wrote, \\"it might be a barcarolle strangely interrupting a theme of very modern stylistic contour\\".Quoted in Cochard, p. 3 ;Pr√©lude No 4 in F major Allegretto moderato. The fourth pr√©lude is among the gentlest of the set. The critic Alain Cochard writes that it \\"casts a spell on the ear through the subtlety of a harmony tinged with the modal and its melodic freshness.\\"Cochard, p. 4 Koechlin calls it \\"a guileless pastorale, flexible, with succinct and refined modulations\\". ;Pr√©lude No 5 in D minor Allegro. Cochard quotes the earlier writer Louis Aguettant's description of this pr√©lude as \\"This fine outburst of anger (Ce bel acc√®s de col√®re)\\". The mood is turbulent and anxious; the piece ends in quiet resignation reminiscent of the \\"Libera me\\" of the Requiem. ;Pr√©lude No 6 in E minor Andante. Faur√© is at his most classical in this pr√©lude, which is in the form of a canon. Copland wrote that it \\"can be placed side by side with the most wonderful of the Preludes of the Well-Tempered Clavichord.\\" ;Pr√©lude No 7 in A major Andante moderato. Morrison writes that this pr√©lude, with its \\"stammering and halting progress\\" conveys an inconsolable grief. After the opening andante moderato, it becomes gradually more assertive, and subsides to conclude in the subdued mood of the opening. The rhythm of one of Faur√©'s best-known songs, \\"N'est-ce-pas?\\" from La bonne chanson, runs through the piece.Koechlin, p. 36 ;Pr√©lude No 8 in C minor Allegro. In Copland's view this is, with the third, the most approachable of the Pr√©ludes, \\"with its dry, acrid brilliance (so rarely found in Faure).\\" Morrison describes it as \\"a repeated-note scherzo\\" going \\"from nowhere to nowhere.\\" ;Pr√©lude No 9 in E minor Adagio. Copland described this pr√©lude as \\"so simple ‚Äì so absolutely simple that we can never hope to understand how it can contain such great emotional power.\\" The pr√©lude is withdrawn in mood; Jank√©l√©vitch wrote that it \\"belongs from beginning to end to another world.\\" Koechlin notes echoes of the \\"Offertoire\\" of the Requiem throughout the piece. For two pianists Caricature by Faur√© of his friend and co-composer of Souvenirs de Bayreuth, Andr√© Messager ;Souvenirs de Bayreuth Subtitled Fantasie en forme de quadrille sur les th√®mes favoris de l'Anneau de Nibelung (\\"Fantasy in the form of a quadrille on favourite themes from Der Ring des Nibelungen\\"). Faur√© admired the music of Wagner and was familiar with the smallest details of his scores,Nectoux (1991), p. 39 but he was one of the few composers of his generation not to come under Wagner's musical influence. From 1878, Faur√© and his friend and ex-pupil Andr√© Messager made trips abroad to see Wagner operas. They saw Das Rheingold and Die Walk√ºre at Cologne Opera; the complete Ring cycle in Munich and London; and Die Meistersinger in Munich and at Bayreuth, where they also saw Parsifal. They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth, written in about 1888. This short, skittish piano work for four hands sends up themes from The Ring. It consists of five short sections in which Wagner's themes are transformed into dance rhythms.Wagstaff, John and Andrew Lamb. \\"Messager, Andr√©\\". Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 14 August 2010 The manuscript (in the Biblioth√®que nationale, Paris) is in Messager's hand.Phillips, p. 103 ;Suite d'orchestre, Op. 20 Between 1867 and 1873, Faur√© wrote a symphonic work for full orchestra. The piece was first heard in 1873 when Faur√© and Saint-Sa√´ns performed it in a two-piano version, but that transcription has not survived.Anderson (2000) L√©on Bo√´llmann made a new transcription of the first movement in 1893. ;Dolly Suite, Op. 56 secondo with Mlle Lombard, a family friend The Dolly Suite is a six-section work for piano duet. It was inspired by H√©l√®ne, nicknamed \\"Dolly\\", daughter of the singer Emma Bardac with whom Faur√© was intimately associated in the 1890s. The opening piece was a present for Dolly's first birthday, and Faur√© added the other five pieces to mark her subsequent birthdays and other family occasions. Unusually for Faur√©, who generally favoured strictly functional titles, the movements of the suite have whimsical titles associated with Dolly and her family.Nectoux (1991), p. 62 Its six movements take about fifteen minutes to perform.Morrison, pp. 8 and 13 The first is a Berceuse, or cradle-song. \\"Mi-a-ou\\", despite a title suggesting a cat, in fact represents the infant Dolly's attempts to pronounce the name of her brother Raoul; after \\"Le jardin de Dolly\\", the \\"Kitty Valse\\", again confounds its feline title, being a sketch of the family's pet dog. After the gentle \\"Tendresse\\", the suite ends with a lively evocation of Spain, which, Orledge notes, is one of Faur√©'s few purely extrovert pieces.Orledge, p. 95 ;Masques et bergamasques, Op. 112 From the orchestral suite drawn from his music for the stage presentation Masques et bergamasques, Faur√© made a transcription for piano duet, which was published in 1919. Like the orchestral suite, it consists of four movements, titled \\"Ouverture\\", \\"Menuet\\", \\"Gavotte\\" and \\"Pastorale\\".Phillips, p. 24 Recordings Faur√© made piano rolls of his music for several companies between 1905 and 1913.

He held that office for the years 1915‚Äì1920, with a brief absence during April‚ÄìJuly 1918 when Edward Vere Levinge officially acted in the position. Gait graduated from University College, London. He sat the competitive examination for the Indian Civil Service in 1882 and was subsequently appointed, arriving in India on 11 December of that year. He served as assistant commissioner in Assam, and then from 1890 as provincial superintendent for the 1891 census in that region. He wrote the official report for that region's census, which formed a part of the national census undertaken in that year. After various other roles in the administration, Gait was appointed as a magistrate and District collector in November 1897. In April 1900 he became superintendent of census operations in Bengal, where he worked with Herbert Hope Risley, the Census Commissioner, to produce the official report of the 1901 Census of India. He was himself Census Commissioner from 1902 until after the census of 1911. Official recognition of his work came with the award of Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1907. In 1912 he became a Companion of the Star of India (CSI), and in 1915 he was raised to the rank of Knight Commander (KCSI) in the same Order. In 1917 he was appointed a Knight of Grace of The Grand Priory of the Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in England. Publications Aside from co-editing the official Reports of the 1901 census of India, Gait wrote other publications. These include:  * * He was Lt. governor of Bihar and Orissa during 1915 and 1920. He also founded Bihar and Orissa Research Society in 1915 which was devoted to explore more about Indology and Anthropology. The society published a journal with title of \\" Journal of Bihar and Orissa Research Society\\". Lt. Gait acted as president of the society from 1915 to 1920 while he was taking his office in Patna. Amrendra Thakur has said that with the publication of A History of Assam \\"historical research in North East India entered into a new age.

The plaintiff in this case, in order to protect her property from possible attachment in execution, had entered into an agreement with the defendant that they would marry, transfer the property to him, thereafter divorce and then retransfer the property to her once the threat of attachment was over. The purpose of this agreement was to conceal the property from the creditor, and possibly others; as such, it was contrary to public policy. The court also held that, when a contract is void ab initio, the remedy of restitutio in integrum will not be available. The essence of the remedy is that there should be a valid legal transaction from which the court will in certain circumstances grant relief by avoiding it ab initio.  Facts  The plaintiff acquired a certificate of occupation of certain property in Soweto, whereafter she signed as surety for two purchasers of motor vehicles. Some time later, when the purchasers defaulted in their payments on the purchase price of the vehicles, the possibility arose of her being held liable in terms of the suretyships. In order to protect her property‚Äîthat is, her certificate of occupation‚Äîshe and defendant entered into an agreement whereby they were to be married and then transfer the property to the defendant. They would later get a divorce and, when there was no longer a threat that the property might be attached in execution, retransfer the property to the plaintiff. The parties were duly married on 9 May 1985. Less than a week later, the plaintiff ceded her property to the defendant. Divorce proceedings were instituted three days later, and an agreement of settlement was reached at the end of May. A divorce order, incorporating the agreement of settlement, was granted on 12 June. One of the terms of the agreement of settlement made an order of court was that the defendant \\"shall retain as his sole and exclusive property all right, title and interest in certain immovable property,\\" which is to say the property transferred to him by the plaintiff. The defendant refused to retransfer the property to the plaintiff, who sued.  Judgment  In an action for an order directing the defendant to fulfil his end of the agreement, the court held that there was no doubt that the purpose of the agreement had been to conceal the plaintiff's assets from the creditor in whose favour she had signed as surety, and possibly other creditors. While there could be no fraudem creditorum without proof of actual prejudice, an agreement designed to mislead creditors was immoral and against public policy, even if it had not yet served its purpose. The court also found that the agreement operated to undermine the institution of marriage, in that the parties' overall plan had been inimical to the institution of marriage. Although the marriage and divorce were valid, the agreement itself was not. The transfer of the property was an inseparable part of that agreement. The remedy of restitutio in integrum, furthermore, was not available to the plaintiff, as it was of the essence of that remedy that there should be a valid legal transaction to start with, from which the Court, in certain circumstances, granted relief by avoiding it ab initio. The court held that, as the transfer was ab initio void, the remedy of restitutio in integrum was not available to the plaintiff. As to the remedy of restitution based on the transfer's being void ab initio, the court held that the parties were in pari delicto: If an order in favour of the plaintiff were not made, the defendant would be substantially enriched at the plaintiff's expense; if the order were made, the Court would be enforcing indirectly an illegal contract. The in pari delicto rule ordinarily served to preclude a plaintiff's recovering what he or she had handed over under a contract or transaction which was void for illegality, but there were well-known exceptions to the rule. These were founded on the principles of equity and public policy. Each case had to be decided on its own facts; there was no general rule on the topic. Despite the fact that the relief sought might have an effect similar to enforcement (that is, of an illegal contract), the Court could still grant relief if the equities favoured it. While the plaintiff's conduct was deserving of some censure, the court found that the defendant's conduct approximated theft. Public policy could surely not tolerate that. Accordingly, the in pari delicto rule was relaxed in this case. If, however, relief were to be granted, it would be in conflict with the divorce order, with its provision that the defendant \\"shall retain as his sole and exclusive property\\" the property in issue. That order, although made by consent and in terms of an illegal agreement, was a valid order until set aside; it could not be ignored. As it could not be said that evidence relevant to the setting aside of the order had been fully canvassed, the court found that it could not grant such relief. The action was dismissed.

These materials, which offer lighter weight with equivalent or greater strength than metals, are increasingly used in airframes and other industrial products. Fiber Placement is an automated composites manufacturing process of heating and compacting synthetic resin pre-impregnated non-metallic fibers on typically complex tooling mandrels. The fiber usually comes in the form of what are referred to as \\"tows\\". A tow is typically a bundle of carbon fibers impregnated with epoxy resin and is approximately wide by thick and comes on a spool. Fiber placement machines (FPM) generally have a capacity of 12 to 32 tows or when placing all tows at a time in a course, have respective course widths of 1.5 in to 4 in. The tows are fed to a heater and compaction roller on the FPM head and through robotic type machine movements, are placed in courses across a tool surface. Courses are generally placed in orientations of 0¬∞, +45¬∞, -45¬∞ and 90¬∞ to build up plies which in combination, have good properties in all directions. Fiber placement machines are generally rated in (lb/h), (lb/min) or weight per time. Description Automated fiber placement (AFP) machines are a recent development of composite manufacturing technologies meant to increase rate and precision in the production of advanced composite parts. AFP machines place fiber reinforcements on moulds or mandrels in an automatic fashion and use a number of separate small width tows (typically or less) of thermoset or thermoplastic pre-impregnated materials to form composite layups. This technology allows better precision and increased deposition rates when compared with experienced laminators but, while allowing for more complex layup geometries than Automated Tape Laying (ATL) it does not reach the same deposition rates. Automated fiber placement can be used to manufacture complex structures that are not possible to manufacture with any other methods.

It's hard for me to leave by myself, I have to leave, but, it's because of what you've done, You should have wanted to listen, but, you'll see, You'll see for yourself what you've done to me. } References Category:1934 songs Category:Cajun folk songs ","title":"La Valse de Madame Sosten"},{"id":"33713563","text":"1996 is a year. 1996 may also refer to: * 1996 (number) * 1996 (Merle Haggard album) * 1996 (Royal Hunt album) * 1996 (Ryuichi Sakamoto album) * \\"1996\\" (song), a song by The Wombats * \\"1996\\", a song by Ella Henderson from Chapter One * \\"1996\\", a song by Marilyn Manson from Antichrist Superstar * \\"1996\\", a song by Brand New from Leaked Demos 2006 ","title":"1996 (disambiguation)"},{"id":"33713565","text":"Alice Schlesinger (; born May 26, 1988) is an Israeli-British elite level judoka and sambo competitor.

The so-called Pavellons G√ºell, or G√ºell Pavilions, is a complex of buildings in the neighborhood of Pedralbes, Barcelona, by the Catalan Modernist architect Antoni Gaud√≠, built between 1884 and 1887.  History and description Gaud√≠ received the commission from his great patron, count Eusebi G√ºell. The dragon gate at the G√ºell Pavilions G√ºell had an estate in the Les Corts district of the small town of Sarri√† (now part of Barcelona), which included two pieces of land known as Can Feliu and Can Cuy√†s de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell i Montells, one of Gaud√≠‚Äôs teachers, had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which stood almost where the Palau Reial de Pedralbes now stands. This house was called Torre Satalia, so christened by Jacinto Verdaguer, a friend of the family.Bassegoda i Nonell, Joan. Verdaguer, els g√ºell i Gaud√≠. Gaud√≠ was commissioned to remodel the house and build a perimeter wall with gates.Bassegoda, Gaud√≠ o espacio, luz y equilibrio, p. 123. Gaud√≠ proposed an Orientalist design, somewhat reminiscent of Mudejar art.Crippa, Gaud√≠, p. 18. He planned an ashlar wall with several gates, of which the main gate would be a wrought-iron grille in the shape of a dragon, with glass eyes; it represented Ladon, offspring of Typhus, the dragon that guarded the Garden of the Hesperides, which was overcome by Hercules as one of his twelve labours‚Äîan episode that was narrated by Jacint Verdaguer in his poem L'Atl√†ntida, dedicated to Antonio L√≥pez y L√≥pez, first marquis of Comillas, who was Eusebi G√ºell‚Äôs brother in law. Over the dragon there is an antimony orange-tree, another allusion to the Hesperides. The shape of the dragon corresponds with the position of the stars in the Serpens constellation, because Ladon was turned into a snake as a punishment for stealing the oranges.Bassegoda, Gaud√≠ o espacio, luz y equilibrio, p. 125-126. The dome of the longeing ring The other three entrances to the estate became obsolete with the construction of Avinguda Diagonal: one of them still stands outside the cemetery of Les Corts, although its iron grille has been moved to the Gaud√≠ Museum in the Parc G√ºell; another was restored in 1982 by the University of Barcelona and installed at the Institut de Geologia Francesc Almera; while the third was demolished to make way for the Pharmacy faculty, but rebuilt in 1957 adjacent to this building.Bassegoda, El gran Gaud√≠, p. 266. Model of the Pavilions at Catalunya en Miniatura The Pavilions consist of a stable, longeing ring and gatehouses. The stable is rectangular and roofed with a high Catalan vault adopting a catenary curve; the longeing ring has a square ground-plan, but is surmounted by a hyperboloid dome topped by an ornamental lantern; the gatehouses consist of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal in plan and the others cuboidal. All three are surmounted by ventilators in the form of chimneys, faced with ceramics.Bassegoda, Gaud√≠ o espacio, luz y equilibrio, p. 124. All the buildings are built of brick in a range of shades from red to yellow, and covered in coloured glass; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used.Crippa, Gaud√≠, p. 17. Gaud√≠ was also partially responsible for the design of the estate‚Äôs gardens, where he built two fountains and a pergola, and planted several Mediterranean species: (pines, eucalyptus, palms, cypresses and magnolias). The ‚ÄúFountain of Hercules‚Äù still stands near the Palau Reial de Pedralbes, restored in 1983; it consists of a bust of Hercules surmounting a basin with the coat of arms of Catalonia and with a spout in the shape of a Chinese dragon.Bassegoda, El gran Gaud√≠, p. 275. In 1969 the Pavellons G√ºell were declared a Monument of National Historic and Artistic Interest.Bassegoda, El gran Gaud√≠, p. 268. They are now used as the headquarters of the Royal Gaud√≠ Chair, which pertains to the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya, and the site also includes the Botanic Garden of Faculty of Biology.

Formed in 1871 by Swedish-Americans settling in the area, the church served the local population for 138 years before closing in 2009. History When founded, the church was affiliated with the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America. It went on to be a member of successive church bodies. These included the Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America, the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Lutheran Church in America, and finally the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. Upon the formation of a formal congregation, members adopted the Augustana Synod's constitution for congregations. Buildings The Kansas Lake Church was housed in many different buildings throughout its history. The first church was built by Johannes Nelson in 1871 and was approximately 32 x 22 feet. However, after 18 years in the original structure, the congregation outgrew it and in 1889 moved to their new church. The new church was built in the style of churches found in Sweden and much larger than the first. It was \\"an inspiration to those who worshiped in it.\\" Unfortunately, tragedy came upon the new church, and in 1904, lightning struck the building and burned it to the ground. Church groups The Kansas Lake Lutheran Church had many different active church groups throughout its history. Among these were the Junior Missionary Society, Luther League, Willing Workers, Christeens, Ladies Aid, Dorcas Society, Lutheran Church Women, and Family Night.Kansas Lake Evangelical Lutheran Church, 1871, 2009.

Brown, editor and publisher of SLUG Magazine as a way to showcase local DIY culture. Brown was inspired by craft festivals she had attended in larger cities such as The Renegade Craft Fair and Bazaar Bizarre, thinking a similar event would fit well with Utah's crafting history and cultural background. ;History The first Craft Lake City festival was held in Salt Lake City at the Gallivan Center on August 8, 2009. It featured over 65 crafters and artists along with live entertainment provided by local Salt Lake bands like the Coyote Hoods, Mad Max and the Wild Ones, Aye Aye, Casey James Prestwood & The Burning Angels, Cub Country, Subrosa, the Tiny Lights and Mammoth. There were over 3,000 attendees. The festival was also awarded an \\"Arty\\" by the staff of Salt Lake City Weekly for \\"Best DIY Arts Fair\\" in 2009. The second annual Craft Lake City was held August 14, 2010 again at the Gallivan Center. This time, 130 artists were selected to participate and over 7,000 people attended. Musical performers included Salt Lake locals Joshua Payne Orchestra, the Boomsticks, Red Bennies, Hello Amsterdam, Mad Max and the Wild Ones, Spell Talk and Muscle Hawk. That year also featured a belly dance showcase with the Hathor Dance Collective, Trisha McBride and Blue Lotus dance troupe performing. The festival partnered with the Salt Lake Film Festival to continue festivities a second day, August 15, with a screening of Faythe Levine‚Äôs film ‚ÄúHandmade Nation‚Äù followed by a question and answer session with some Craft Lake City artists. In 2011, Craft Lake City festivities began with an exhibit at the Utah Art Alliance's Main Street Gallery in Salt Lake City called ‚ÄúArt vs. Craft.‚Äù The show ran July 5 through July 30 and featured the work of fourteen Craft Lake City artists. The festival expanded to over 180 vendors, once again held at the Gallivan Center on August 13 with about 12,000 attendees.

Bush nominated Tharp to replace Mark Filip on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The nomination was made with less than six months remaining in the Bush Presidency and was returned after not being acted upon by the 110th Congress. On July 5, 2011, Senator Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, recommended to Barack Obama, a Democrat, that Tharp be appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The recommendation stemmed from a long-standing tradition in Illinois that, when the state is represented in the Senate by a Democrat and a Republican, the senator from the president's party gets to recommend candidates for two in every three judicial vacancies and the other senator chooses candidates for one in three. On November 10, 2011, President Obama nominated John J. Tharp Jr. to be a District Judge on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, filling the vacancy created when Judge Blanche M. Manning took senior status in 2010. Tharp received his hearing by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 26, 2012 and his nomination was reported to the Senate floor on February 16, 2012 by a voice vote, with Senator Mike Lee recording the only no vote. On May 14, 2012, the Senate voted 86‚Äì1 to confirm Tharp to the judgeship, with Senator Lee casting the lone nay vote. \\"I'm honored by both the nomination and the confirmation,\\" Tharp told the Chicago Tribune shortly after the vote. \\"It's a real credit to both our senators that they worked together to get this done.\\" He received his commission on May 16, 2012.

Early life and education Cafritz was born in Lithuania.Jewish Washington: \\"Real Estate Boom\\" retrieved September 18. 2014 Based on papers filed in court, Cafrtiz was born in 1888; however, the year of his birth is not known and Cafritz had often understated his age. Along with his 4 siblings, he immigrated to the United States in 1898. After briefly settling in New York, the family moved to Washington and operated a small grocery store on 24th and P Streets NW. Cafritz scouted the Maine Avenue Fish Market for fish for the store and sold newspapers on 15th Street, near the United States Department of the Treasury. At the age of 19, he studied at the National University School of Law before realizing that he wanted to be in business, not law. Cafritz began his business career in 1904 by buying the Star Coal and Coke Company, at 315 Q Street, with a $1,400 loan from his father. In 1911, he owned a saloon, the Old-Timer's Bar, at 8th Street and K Street, Southeast, Washington, D.C. He also acquired bowling alleys and by 1915, he was known as Washington's \\"bowling king\\". Real estate development career Cafritz house, now The Field School In 1916, he began developing two- story row-houses. In 1922, he founded Cafritz Construction and acquired a large tract of land for $700,000, which he financed with a down payment of $35,000; he eventually built 3,000 houses on the site. The first phase included 53 rowhouses in Petworth, which he sold for $8,950 each. He developed the Greenwich Forest neighborhood in Bethesda, Maryland. He built the now- demolished Ambassador Hotel, at 14th and K Street. In 1932, he led the group that constructed the Westchester Apartments, at which Barry Goldwater resided. The same year, Cafritz built homes in the neighborhood next to the National Arboretum.\\"Cafritz Project Visited By Many: Prospective Home Buyers Are Much Attracted to Randolph Place\\". The Washington Post. April 10, 1932. p. R1. Cafritz built the Majestic Apartments. In 1938, he built his residence, a mansion at 2301 Foxhall Road, N.W. In 1949, he built the Cafritz Building, at 1625 Eye Street. He developed several office buildings along K Street, including 1725 K, 1725 I, and 1735 I Streets. Until the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, Cafritz used racially restrictive covenants to exclude African Americans and other racial minorities. He advertised the whites-only Greenwich Forest neighborhood as \\"rigidly exclusive with protective restrictions.\\" Death Cafritz died in 1964 of a heart attack. When he died, his estate was the largest ever probated in the District of Columbia. It took lawyers and IRS agents 4 years to settle the estate, which was valued in 1968 at $66 million. Philanthropy He raised $250,000 to build the Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center, of which he was a charter member and president. In 1964, he offered to donate the Chase's Theater and Riggs Building as a performing arts center. The Morris Cafritz Center for the Arts at the DC Jewish Community Center is named for him. =Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation= Cafritz founded the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation in 1948, funding it with $11.5 million. The foundation is the largest private foundation focused on Washington, D.C. It gives annual charitable grants of $20 million to nonprofit organizations in the Washington, D.C. area. It has given over $500 million since inception. The foundation awards the Distinguished DC Government Employees Award to individuals who exemplify the best in public service. Family In July 1929, Cafritz married Gwendolyn Detre de Surany, twenty years his junior. She was daughter of Roman Catholic Hungarian immunologist Dr Laszlo Detre de Surany, co-discoverer of the Wassermann test for syphilis, who settled at Washington in the 1920s and became chief immunologist for the United States Public Health Service.https://www.nytimes.com/1972/02/20/archives/carfer-deire-cairifz-is- fiance-of-miss-mary-melissa- berfholi.htmlhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1988/11/30/dc- hostess-gwendolyn-cafritz-dies/1ce03124-db68-459f-85c9-61d0d94ac47c They had 3 children: Calvin, Carter and Conrad.

The eyes are small, the snout is short and blunt, and the operculum bears a robust venomous spine. Five fan-shaped groups of bony ridges are on the top of the head just behind the eye. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the anterior portion has six or seven spines and the posterior portion has no spines, but 24 to 29 soft rays. The anal fin has two spines and 25 to 29 soft rays. This fish can grow to a maximum length around , but a more common length is . The dorsal colouring is generally whitish, yellowish, or grey, sometimes with some violet or pinkish shades on the head and neck. Numerous brownish or blackish speckles are on the back and sides, some, especially on the flanks near the lateral line, forming ring shapes. Behaviour Like other members of the weever family, the starry weever lives on the seabed, burying itself in the sediment so that only its eyes and the anterior dorsal fin are above the surface. Poison glands are located at the base of this fin and on the spine on the gill cover. This fish is an ambush predator, remaining stationary in the sand ready to grab any passing prey of suitable size with its wide, upward-pointing mouth.

The second largest employer in the county, the system's 35 schools serve 20,000 students as of 2013‚Äì2014. Salisbury split off from the original county-wide system in 1921, but merged back into the county system in 1989. Josh Wagner chairs the seven-member Board of Education while Dr. Lynn Moody serves as the fifth superintendent of the combined system. The system has won several awards, including two statewide Teachers of the Year and two Blue Ribbon schools. History The history of public education in Rowan County began shortly after the state passed its first common school law in 1839. The state was then divided into several school districts. District number 22 (called the Setzer School District) covered Rowan County and was based in the Setzer School, a one-room log school built in 1840s just east of China Grove. The first public schools in Rowan were established in 1847. Several citizens interested in education met and formed the Board of Superintendents of Common Schools of Rowan County on May 8, 1847. They elected Hamilton C. Jones as their first chairman. That year, they worked to hire teachers, choose/elect superintendents and divide the county into 47 school districts. =Rowan County public schools= Educational progress happened more rapidly in the city of Salisbury than in the rest of the county. While Salisbury's schools grew, schools in the rest of Rowan County lagged far behind. After the city school system split off, the difference became more noticeable as a report from John H. Cook from the North Carolina College for Women (now, University of North Carolina at Greensboro) around 1924 called the county's schools the worst in North Carolina. At the time, the county only had 36 schools many of which were only one or two room buildings. Cook devised a plan for school improvement and new school construction which the county commissioners and the citizens promptly adopted in 1924. Soon thereafter, a school construction boom created 18 schools with at least eight rooms each. Racial desegregation became a tough issue for many in the Rowan County Schools system. The separate Black schools were phased out, but many opposed to racial integration still put up a fight. This was aggravated by a strong Klan presence in the area. Notable incidents included 12 people arrested in 1967, including Rowan County's Registrar of Deeds, for threats, shootings, and bombings; as well as student protests over the playing of the song \\"Dixie\\" at school football games at integrated South Rowan High School. . =Salisbury city schools= When the Board of Superintendents set up the county school districts, the town of Salisbury fell into district 27. In 1847, monies apportioned to operate the school in the district totaled $221. The first teachers of the district were Susan Giles and Eleanor Fulton. This Salisbury Graded School District was centered on the school and offices on Ellis Street. Later the area would become known as the Ellis Street Graded School District. The Salisbury Graded School had grown much from its origins and the city build a high school separate from the other grades in 1904. This was the second high school built in North Carolina after Wilmington. The former J. C. Price High School Prior to the establishment of Salisbury City Schools, the school district fell under control of the county school system. The district was managed jointly by the City of Salisbury and the district's Board of Trustees. Salisbury City Schools brgan as a separate system on March 3, 1921, when the North Carolina General Assembly adopted the law that allowed a separate Board of Education to run the system. Several schools were built over next few years, including the Wiley School, Boyden High School and Price High School. The Calvin H. Wiley School, built 1916‚Äì18, was expanded in 1921. It was used as a school building until 1983 and is now on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Another prominent school built in 1926, was Boyden High School, named for Archibald Henderson Boyden, an educator who was then Mayor of Salisbury. J.C. Price High School was an African American school that served students in the system from 1932 until 1969 when it was integrated into Boyden High School, which then became Salisbury High School in 1970. The Boyden High School site and the Price High School site are also on the NRHP. =Merger= The current Rowan-Salisbury School System was formed in 1989 by the merger of Rowan County Schools and Salisbury City Schools. The process leading up to the merger was difficult and almost not approved several times. Declining enrollment in the city and county systems (especially the city system) and a general move towards \\"white flight\\" from the more urban and minority-heavy city schools had prompted discussions of merging the systems. At issue in the merger talks primarily was redistricting and racial balance in the schools. However, the separate city and county school boards approved a merger plan on October 16, 1987. This was soon approved by the Rowan County Commission and the State Board of Education. Adding to the stresses of the merger process, a red measles outbreak in 1989 limited school activities and athletics in Rowan and Cabarrus counties for several weeks. Since the merger, the system has become the second-largest employer in Rowan County. In 2006, the school board made headlines when students at South Rowan High School started up a gay‚Äìstraight alliance club at their school. In response to public complaint, led by Flip Benham of Operation Save America from neighboring Cabarrus county, the Board of Education adopted a policy banning \\"sex-based student clubs\\" at all schools in the system. The combined system handled around 16,000 students in 1990. Even decades after the merger consolidated the systems, the school district has no central office, instead spreading administrative tasks over five office locations across Rowan County. The move towards a central office for the system has been contentious in the county. Disagreements between the county commission and the school board have delayed finalizing plans and construction. The Salisbury City Council even agreed to help fund construction of a central office. Student demographics For the 2010‚Äì2011 school year, Rowan-Salisbury Schools had a population of 20,460 students and 1,400.69 teachers on a (FTE) basis. This created a student- teacher ratio of 14.61:1. The same year, out of the total student population, the gender ratio was 51% male to 49% female. The demographic group makeup was: White, 65%; Black, 19%; Hispanic, 12%; Asian/Pacific Islander, 1%; and American Indian, 0% (two or more races, 2%). For the same school year, 60.51% of the students received free and reduced-cost lunches. In 2012, nearly 70% of Rowan-Salisbury School System elementary students receive free or reduced lunches, according to Amy Goodnight, executive director of Food for Thought. Governance and funding Ellis St. Administrative Building in Salisbury, NC. The primary governing body of the Rowan-Salisbury School System follows a council‚Äìmanager government format with a seven-member Board of Education appointing a Superintendent to run the day-to-day operations of the system. The system resides in the North Carolina State Board of Education's Seventh District. =Board of education= The seven-member Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education generally meets on the fourth Monday of each month. The members are chosen in non-partisan elections by the whole county, but must come from one of the six high school districts or the special area district. The board serves four-year, staggered terms with elections every two years. Its current members are: Josh Wagner (Chairperson), East area; Dean Hunter (Vice- Chairperson), South area; Chuck Hughes, Salisbury area; Travis Allen, West area; Susan Cox, Southeast area; W. Jean Kennedy, Special area; and Richard Miller, North area. In response to HB2, the Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education ruled on May 10, 2016 that students can carry pepper spray and mace. Board member Chuck Hughes said, \\"Depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues, it may be a pretty valuable tool to have on the female students if they go to the bathroom, not knowing who may come in.\\"Marusak, Joe. \\"HB2 cited in allowing Rowan-Salisbury high schoolers to carry Mace, pepper spray on campus\\", The Charlotte Observer, Charlotte NC 11 May 2016. Retrieved on 11 May 2016. =Superintendent= The district has had five superintendents since the merger. Don Martin was chosen from outside the county to lead the newly merged school district. He served from 1989 until leaving in 1994 to lead the Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools. Joe McCann, who had previously worked for the county school system before the merger was chosen as the next superintendent, serving from 1995 until 2000. Then, Wiley Doby served as the district leader 2001‚Äì2006. Dr.Judy Grissom was chosen to replace Wiley Doby as superintendent when his contract expired on April 1, 2006. A native of Rowan County, Grissom once worked for the school system and had been associate superintendent for the Alamance-Burlington School System. In 2011, Grissom won Superintendent of the Year for the southwest region and was a finalist for the statewide award. Grissom provided the school district which the leadership that was responsible for the school district winning more state and national awards, especially in the areas of technology and curriculum innovation. Her tenure as Superintendent resulted in more national and state achieve awards than any of the district's superintendents. The superintendent leading the Rowan-Salisbury School System is now Dr. Lynn Moody. She had been superintendent of Rock Hill Schools system. Moody was chosen to replace Judy Grissom as superintendent starting in October, 2013. As Rowan-Salisbury's Superintendent, Moody leads the district of approximately 20,000 students and 3,000 employees in 35 schools and five central office locations. The focus for 2014-2017, as defined in the district's Strategic Plan, is Literacy and Student Engagement through problem-based learning, digital conversion and professional learning communities. Classrooms are transforming to increase rigor and engagement through CCRP: Connected-Learning, Collaboration, Relevancy, and Personalization. During the 2014-15 school year, Rowan- Salisbury was moved to a one-to-one digital conversion. Teachers and high school students received MacBook Air laptops, while students in grades 3-8 received iPads. This teaching and learning tool has changed the culture of the community and its schools. =Funding= Public school districts in North Carolina do not have their own taxation authority; they are fiscally dependent on the State and their respective county Board of Commissioners. The county Boards of Commissioners vote on funding levels proposed by the school system. Prior to the merger of the city and county systems, spending per-pupil differed greatly between the city and county schools. The City of Salisbury supplemented the spending more than the County of Rowan did. Spending per- pupil equalized to be greater than what the Rowan County Public Schools public schools spent previously, but a report in 2005 showed that spending to be consistently below the state average. The Blanche & Julian Robertson Family Foundation has awarded several grants Rowan-Salisbury Schools. Member schools The Rowan-Salisbury School System has 35 schools ranging from pre- kindergarten to twelfth grade, including an early college high school. Those 35 schools are separated into 8 high schools, 7 middle schools and 20 elementary schools.

He was Mexico's top cabinet secretary and key figure in the battle against the drug cartels and corruption in the country. Blake Mora was also an important official in the dialogues of Felipe Calder√≥n's drug policy, where he constantly traveled to meet with governors and victims of the drug war. Early life and education Blake Mora was born in a working-class family in Tijuana, Baja California. He obtained a degree in law from the Autonomous University of Baja California (UABC) and a diploma in strategic planning and public policy from the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM). Career Blake Mora was elected to the office of Alderman of the City of Tijuana from 1995 to 1998, and later served as a federal deputy for the Fifth Federal Electoral District of Baja California in the LVIII Legislature from 2000 to 2003. He then served as a member of the Congress of Baja California from 2004 to 2007. According to Fox News, Blake Mora gained popularity as a public official because he had promoted the cooperation of military forces and civil authorities to combat the drug cartels in his home state of Baja California before becoming Secretary of Interior. On 1 November 2007, he was appointed Secretary General of the Government of Baja California by Governor Jos√© Guadalupe Osuna Mill√°n. In 2009, he was named as a possible candidate for the office of Attorney General of the Republic. On 14 July 2010, President Felipe Calder√≥n named him Secretary of the Interior to replace Fernando G√≥mez Mont. Blake Mora promoted Felipe Calder√≥n's strategy of eradicating the organized crime in Mexico and the notoriously corruption-plagued state and police forces. The British newspaper The Guardian described Blake Mora as Mexico's number-two official in fighting the drug cartels, after the president. In addition, Blake Mora carried out the project for new national identity card for underage people, with modern features that included digitalized fingerprints and iris images saved in government databases, which was intended to prevent criminals from using false IDs. Death Blake Mora died in a helicopter accident along with seven other people in Chalco de D√≠az Covarrubias, Estado de M√©xico, just outside Mexico City. There were no survivors. The helicopter, an A√©rospatiale Super Puma, was traveling to Cuernavaca, Morelos for a meeting of prosecutors when it went down. Marcelo Ebrard, the Head of Government of the Federal District, said in an interview through CNN M√©xico that the helicopter was \\"completely destroyed,\\" since it crashed head-on against a hill. Then, the helicopter impacted several times over the terrain as the pilot tried to land the aircraft safely. Reports state that early in the morning before Blake Mora left Mexico City, the helicopter took a few minutes to take off due to dense fog, which has made observers speculate that visibility was a major factor of the collision. After the helicopter failed to arrive at the estimated time, aircraft were sent to investigate the situation, and eventually reported the damaged helicopter at 11:12 a.m. local time. Along with Blake Mora, the following people were killed in the accident: Felipe Zamora, general of legal affairs; Jos√© Alfredo Garc√≠a Medina, director of social communications; Diana Hayton S√°nchez, Blake Mora's secretary; Ren√© de Le√≥n Zapien, lieutenant general; Felipe Cort√©s and Pedro Ram√≥n Escobar, both air force lieutenants; and Jorge Luis Ju√°rez G√≥mez, army sergeant. Although not confirmed, some sources claimed that the President Felipe Calder√≥n had plans to travel in the helicopter that Blake Mora was killed in, and was awaiting the flight until the accident occurred. President Calder√≥n said that the helicopter was flying in foggy conditions, and that the crash \\"was probably an accident.\\" Investigations regarding his death were carried out immediately after the accident. The death of Blake Mora is the second loss in this position during the Calder√≥n presidency, the first one being Juan Camilo Mouri√±o, who died in a plane crash in 2008. Blake Mora's last Twitter post before his death recalled the previous death of the former Secretary of Interior, Juan Camilo Mouri√±o: =Reactions= * ‚Äì The president of the United States, Barack Obama, \\"called to tell President Calder√≥n that he was shocked and saddened to learn of the tragic death of the Mexican Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora, along with, apparently, seven of his Mexican government colleagues, in a helicopter crash earlier today. Obama said that his thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who were lost, with President Calder√≥n, and with the Mexican people. The United States worked closely with those who were lost in this crash and considered them to be close partners, and know that they were strong public servants for the Mexican people. And the President reinforced his commitment to the close partnership between the United States and Mexico in this difficult time and committed to stay in close touch with President Calder√≥n going forward.\\" * (Translation): \\"The news filled us with dismay... [and we] respectfully unite in the national mourning.\\" * ‚Äì The president of Mexico, Felipe Calder√≥n, said that Blake Mora was not only an exceptional public servant, but also was an \\"exceptional Mexican.\\" They gave a speech and said that Mexico had lost a \\"great patriot and a good friend,\\" and promised to work to the best of his abilities to bring the causes of the accident and bring transparency. * ‚Äì The National Action Party remembered that Blake Mora was a \\"politician of huge trajectory.\\" \\"We reiterate our trust in the Federal government to lead the investigations of Blake Mora's death.\\" * ‚Äì The Institutional Revolutionary Party asked for a transparent investigation and clear reasons to uncover the unfortunate incident. * ‚Äì The Party of the Democratic Revolution send its condolences to Blake Mora's family and those of the passengers killed. They awaited the upcoming results of the investigations. * ‚Äì The Ecologist Green Party of Mexico expressed its condolences to the president Felipe Calder√≥n for the irreparable loss of a \\"close collaborator\\" and good friend of his. They united in the national mourning. =Controversy= The question of whether this incident was a mere coincidence or a conspiracy has been discussed in numerous newspapers, blogs, and other internet sites. However, President Calder√≥n has tried to quell any suggestions of sabotage, saying Blake Mora's helicopter \\"was always under guard\\" in the hangar of Mexico's equivalent of the Secret Service and that it had recently undergone maintenance. Before Blake Mora, Juan Camilo Mouri√±o, who was also head of the Interior, was killed in an airplane accident on November 4, 2008 with the presidential security adviser Jose Luis Vasconcelos and six other officials. And in September 21, 2005, Ram√≥n Mart√≠n Huerta, the former Public Security Secretary, also died in a helicopter accident with Jos√© Antonio Bernal, who worked for the Human Rights Commission, Tom√°s Valencia, head chief of the Federal Police in Mexico, and six other officials. Although not proven, these high-profile deaths have fueled speculations on whether they were foul plays by the drug cartels. Moreover, the death of Blake Mora and the seven others in a helicopter crash puts into relevance the fact that Mexico has no law or protocol that would prevent senior officials from flying in the same aircraft, as in other governments worldwide, to preserve the integrity of government and decision makers. Mexican law has no protocols to prevent the president or his cabinet, including members of the Legislature or the Judiciary, from travelling in the same vehicle for security reasons. In addition, CNN M√©xico announced that soon after the death of Mexico's interior secretary, one Twitter user posted on Blake Mora's page a day before his death caught the attention of the media. At the time of the plane crash, only 14 hours had passed since the tweet was posted. One individual under the username @Morf0 posted the following message on Blake Mora's Twitter page: Nevertheless, the man that posted the Twitter message was interviewed through a phone call on live television, and claimed that his tweet was a prank among a community of internet surfers that were attempting to make predictions online. On another note, Hiram Fernando Escobar said his brother Pedro, co- pilot of the ship, told him two days before the incident that the helicopter was not ready to travel on Friday, the day he crashed in a mountainous area south of Mexico City. Pedro Escobar allegedly told his brother that the helicopter was \\"not well\\" and presented signs of failure. In addition, the helicopter, an A√©rospatiale Super Puma, was bought from a casino in the United States in 1985, and had been used for governmental purposes in Mexico since 1987. The controversy lies on the idea that the helicopter was \\"out-of-date\\" and that it was bought with a considerable amount of flight hours. =Investigations= Aeronautic specialists from United States, Mexico, and France, along with Eurocopter, are assisting the Mexican government investigate the helicopter accident that killed Blake Mora. President Calderon has solicited help from the National Transportation Safety Board, a U.S. agency specialized in aviation accidents, as well as France's BEA to work together in the investigation regarding the secretary's death. Experts in the Mexican Air Force will also be aiding in the investigations. After preliminary investigation and visual contacts of the accident, the wreckage did not show any damage caused by an explosion or fire, which has made investigators deduce that the collision was due to poor visibility. Investigations by the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation prove that the pilot of the helicopter did not lose control of the aircraft. Initial investigations show that the coordinates of where accident occurred coincide with the last record taken by the helicopter's radar. Moreover, government sources mention that the pilot of the helicopter took a different route in an attempt to escape the cloudiness and find a lower and more visible trajectory to their destination, but eventually wrecked in a hill known as Ayaqueme, situated in the municipality of Chalco. Forensic investigations and autopsies show that \\"...all (the deaths) were (caused by) traumas,\\" since the bodies came very complete, and doctors mention that the cause of death of all occupants of the helicopter was due to a very severe impact. Moreover, experts mention that if the helicopter had flown 200 feet (60 meters) higher or 300 meters further south, the helicopter would have not crashed. The reasons why the pilot decided to fly over 200 miles per hour against the mainland, without opening the landing gear, still remains a mystery. =Aftermath= After Blake's death, his functions as Secretary of the Interior were temporarily assumed by the Secretary of Government, Juan Marcos Guti√©rrez, while President Calder√≥n appoints a new secretary. Several academics and journalists from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education, the Universidad Veracruzana, and CNN M√©xico have debated the possible impacts Blake Mora's death can have on Mexico's drug policy and politics. In addition, CNN has sponsored tweets on Twitter and forum discussions on Facebook through the program known as Mexico Opina to allow people to debate and analyze the causes and consequences of Blake Mora's death. Felipe Calder√≥n, the president of Mexico, named Alejandro Poir√© Romero as the new interior minister, six days after the previous head of the agency, Francisco Blake Mora, died on a helicopter accident. =Legacy= Felipe Calder√≥n inaugurated a boulevard in Tijuana, Baja California called \\"Jos√© Francisco Blake Mora\\" on 11 October 2012. Personal life According to information published by sources of Baja California, Blake Mora used to go to Mass every Sunday with his family and spend all day together, and share important dates, like Father's Day, with his loved ones. In addition, he used to spend quality time fishing, a hobby his father taught him when he was young.

Its members are aristocratic women who dedicate themselves to a shared life in community and to female education. Description The Society was founded by three sisters, Cinzia, Gridonia and Olimpia Gonzaga,Arrivabene, Carlo. \\"Italy under Victor Emmanuel: A Personal Narrative\\", Volume 1, Hurst and Blackett, 1862, pp. 146-148. who were the nieces of St. Aloysius Gonzaga.Genealogy of the Lords of Castiglione Their father, Rodolfo, had been killed in 1593, when they were still infants, but the daughters wished to make reparations for his death in battle. It developed out of an inspiration of Father Vergil Cepari, S.J. (1563‚Äì1631), who had been their father's confessor as well as having been a classmate of their sainted uncle. He had felt the need for the education of the young children of that city. The school for boys would be administered by the Jesuit Fathers, but there was no one to whom a school for girls could be entrusted. Thus Cepari envisioned a community of women who would dedicate themselves to this undertaking. The Gonzaga sisters took up the challenge, finding seven other young ladies of the city to join in this work.Their names were: Rodomilla Tissomburga, Anna Vangioni, Lelia Petrocini, Francesca Pastorio, Paola Carminati, Caterina Stagni and Anna Bellomi. Their academy was opened on 21 June 1608‚Äîthe feast day of St. Aloysius Gonzaga‚Äîin the Casa Aliprandi, their mother's family home. That same day, the first members of the Society held a ceremony in a local church during which each took a vow of chastity and swore perseverance to the work of the Society and obedience to the Mother Prelate (or Superior) of the community. They received formal civil standing from their uncle, the Marchese Francesco Gonzaga, on the following 27 September. Their charter initially permitted only women of noble birth to join the society, with novices required to demonstrate their lineage. This rule was subsequently amended to permit the inclusion of commoners who were nominated by the Madre Prelata and then approved by the Council. After this expansion of membership, a division between members of noble and common origin was maintained. The former were called \\"Ladies\\" (), and the latter, \\"oblates\\". The Ladies wore gowns of finer material those of the oblates and a black mantle rather than the white one of the oblates, by whom all housework was performed. The Ladies were the educators in their academy. A dowry was required for their admission to the community, while not for oblates. In the past, the Society was notably distinct from an enclosed religious order in that its members were not nuns and thus not confined to a cloister. Rather, they were, with the consent of their Mother Superior, permitted to enter the outside world in pairs, and were also allowed to receive both male and female visitors. Unlike monastic communities, the community survived suppression during the Napoleonic era due to this status, and were able to continue their work. In 1952 they were given pontifical recognition as a community by the Holy See. Their motherhouse and sole community remains in Castiglione delle Stiviere. The society was never large, never numbering more than 30. As of 2012, there were 2 members left.

Background  Hastings was born in Leicester, Massachusetts, on July 24, 1816, to Simon and Betsey Hastings. He is a descendant of the 17th century Massachusetts colonist Thomas Hastings. He moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he took part in the anti-slavery movement. In 1846, he moved to the Wisconsin Territory, settling in Geneva.  Public office  In 1849 Hastings he was elected as a Free Soiler, succeeding Democrat Erasmus Richardson. In January he introduced a series of bills calculated to force the hand of Democrats and Whigs, both of which parties were courting the newly successful Free Soilers with an eye towards merger. The \\"Hastings resolutions\\", as they came to be called, urged Wisconsin's Representatives and instructed its Senators (then elected by the Legislature) to apply their power and influence to completely break with slavery: to forbid the admission of new slave states, to ban slavery in all federal territories, and to repeal any laws that favored slave labor over free. The tensions revealed by the votes of all three parties on these and related resolutions would eventually lead the Free Soilers to conclude that merger with either of the old parties was an illusion unworthy of pursuit.Chapter Four: \\"A Party Distinct and Separate\\" in, McManus, Michael J.

History In 1881, the German brothers Max and Albert Holzapfel, along with Charles Petrie, founded the Holzapfel Compositions Company Ltd in Newcastle upon Tyne, England, producing marine coatings for the local shipping industry. The name International was then coined as their paint brand. The company expanded, first moving to larger premises in Gateshead, and in 1904 to a large factory in Felling, where its modern-day headquarters are located. As early as 1889, the company took production to Russia, Denmark, Italy and Germany, and in 1901 to the United States, where it was registered under the name International Paint Co. Inc. in New Jersey, with production taking place in Brooklyn, New York. In the period before the First World War, new factories were added in Sweden, France and Japan. During the war, the company was known as International Paints, and moved its headquarters to London, with further growth during the interwar period in Spain, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand, and expansion into domestic and industrial paints. In 1968, Courtaulds, having established a significant paints business and acquired International Paint, merged all its coating interests under the International name. The 1970s and 80s saw many additions, new markets and growth, as well as consolidations and disentanglements, and a reduction in the number of markets they supplied. AkzoNobel took over Courtaulds in 1998 when the Coatings & Sealants division was Courtaulds' most profitable activity.

However, it was possible to extend that search range temporarily on fighters. After a particular target had been selected by the gunner-radar operator, the system automatically tracked the target within its angular limits in both range and direction. Also, the system automatically directed and pointed the gun turret in the correct firing position. The only mechanical function of the gunner was the activation of the firing mechanism when the target was in effective firing range. One B-36B, 44-92042, of the 26th Bomb Squadron, 11th Bomb Group, was modified for testing as the right gun on the APG-3 was removed and a 35mm Vitarama camera installed in lieu of the turret. The first mission was flown on 25 October 1949, over Eglin AFB Gunnery Range, at . Three passes were made on the tail position by two Lockheed F-80 Shooting Stars. Following those passes the APG-3 radar system failed. The malfunction of the radar system was due to low voltage transmitted to the modular and to an antenna tilt motor failure. On 1 November, the wing flew its second APG-3 Tail Turret System evaluation test. A total of 12 passes were made in the Eglin AFB Gunnery Range by two F-80 jet fighters at . Both fighters and the B-36B assigned to the 26th Bomb Squadron, 11th Bomb Group, staged out of Eglin AFB. The next day, a fighter intercept gun-camera mission was flown on 2 November, out of Carswell AFB, Texas, in a B-36B of the 7th Bomb Group. Two North American F-82 Twin Mustang fighters from Bergstrom AFB, Austin, Texas, intercepted the bomber at in the vicinity of Austin. The purpose of the mission, as in any gun-camera mission, was to provide \\"tracking\\" and \\"framing\\" experience for the B-36 gunners. Also, it provided experience in interception for the fighter pilots. A third test of the APG-3 system was flown out of Eglin AFB on 7 November. A total of 18 passes were made by two F-80s on the bomber at .7th WING OPERATIONS HISTORY, 1949‚Äì1951. 7bwb-36assn.org. Retrieved on 2011-10-31.

In the last week of June 1956, a new maximum-minimum airspeed indicator was installed in a Boeing B-47 Stratojet to undergo operational suitability testing. \\"The new instrument, resembling the standard type indicator, differs in that it will determine the stall speed of an aircraft at any specific time. It will also compute the approach speed of the aircraft to aid the pilot in attaining proper speeds for landing. In the past, with the standard type indicator, pilots have had to determine the approach speed of the aircraft through a mental process of totaling the weight of the fuel load and the operating weight of the aircraft to arrive at the gross weight. This was then applied to a chart to determine the proper approach speed of the aircraft. This method, using the standard indicator, left room for error. With the high speed aircraft of today, pilots must be accurate in determining the speed in order to prevent stalling or approaching the landing strip too fast. The new maximum-minimum air speed indicator is designed to prevent errors that might be made by mental calculations of the pilot.

The Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), or toss bombing, tactic was first made public in front of a crowd of 3,000 including 11 state governors on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B‚Äì47 Stratojet entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a half loop, releasing its bomb under computer control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an Immelmann turn or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target.Knaack (1988) p. 138.

In the same exercise, the Air Force intended to have interceptors fire Genies at other unmanned aircraft. Both the Army and Air Force were to make use of airspace ' horizontal distance from the nearest populated area' which had been a military training area for years and was routinely used to test Air Force weapons (albeit never nuclear arms).[Alfred D.] Starbird telex to [K.F.] Hertford, et al., May 2, 1958, Department of Energy/Nevada Nuclear Testing Archive accession no.

Strauss emphasized his belief that what he considered unnecessary tests of production nuclear arms might imperil future test activities he thought which were central to the AEC's mission. Dulles and his deputy, Christian Herter, expressed concern that neighboring nations might react poorly to the operation. Eisenhower decided that if the governments of Cuba or Mexico objected, 'the matter would have to be reconsidered.' A month later, as test preparations proceeded, another White House meeting was convened. Dulles reported to Eisenhower that 'consultations' with Cuba and Mexico led him 'to recommend strongly' that the nuclear operation be moved to the Pacific. The president then 'approved transfer or cancellation' of the operation but requested 'some study of some combination of activities to accomplish the same objectives.' While the military moved to continue the operation in Florida with conventional rounds, Public Health Service officials contacted their state-level counterparts, informed them of the nuclear test halt, expressed appreciation for 'complete cooperation,' and asked them to 'forget our activities in the area.'Melvin W.

Vietnam War During the early part of 1965 about one dozen personnel of the 109th Quartermaster Corps, U.S. Army, were sent TDY to Eglin Air Force Base, where they assisted Air Force personnel developing an air delivery technique called the low-altitude parachute extraction system (LAPES). The 109th's mission was to provide parachute packing, temporary storage and rigging of supplies and equipment for aerial drop by aircraft of all the services. In addition, the 109th was to render technical assistance in the recovery and evacuation of airdrop equipment. Using the LAPES system, while a cargo plane flew a few feet above ground level, a drogue parachute would be released, pulling palletized cargo out of the aircraft and onto the drop zone. An alternative method was the ground proximity extraction system (GPES), in which cargo was yanked from the aircraft by a hook that snagged a cable traversing the runway. At full strength the unit would be capable of preparing 200 tons of material per day for delivery by free, high velocity or low-velocity drop techniques.Aerial Lifeline to Khe Sanh .

Beginning in 1965, Project Black Spot was a test program designed to give the Air Force a self-contained night attack capability to seek out and destroy targets along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. After the program was approved by the Department of Defense in early 1966, E-Systems of Greenville, Texas, modified two C-123K Providers which were redesignated NC-123Ks, but were often referred to as AC-123Ks. The aircraft were equipped with a long, 57.75 inch nose fairing that housed an X-band forward-looking radar. Below and aft of the extended radome was a turret with Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR), Low-Level Light Television (LLLTV), and a laser range- finder/illuminator. Also, a low-level Doppler navigation radar and weapons release computer were installed. Two rectangular aluminum weapons dispensers (for CBU bomblets) were stacked within the fuselage. Each container housed 12 cells, each cell containing three Cluster Bomb Units (CBUs). Depending on the type of CBU installed, the containers had a capacity of between 2,664 and 6,372 one pound bomblets. The bomblets were released through 12 openings in the cargo floor that aligned with the cells in the weapons dispenser. The lower fuselage contained 12 inward opening doors that aligned with the openings in the cargo floor, forming a chute. Bomblet release was controlled by a weapons panel in the forward section of the fuselage. In the event of an emergency, the entire load could be jettisoned manually.

Continuing problems with the forward-looking radar and other sensor systems (which were ultimately never resolved) on the Tropic Moon III B-57Gs after deployment to Thailand in the September 1970 meant that ADTC testing of the design continued at Eglin into 1971. Concurrently, the Air Force delivered the Cat II test airframe, 53-3906, to Westinghouse Electronic Systems in Maryland for modification under Project Pave Gat to house a special bomb bay installation of one Emerson TAT-161 turret with a single M61 20mm cannon as a gunship. After initial flight tests in the Baltimore area, the gun B-57G was flown to Eglin in January 1971. Delays occurred in testing at Eglin AFB, due to competition for mission time from the Tropic Moon III B-57Gs as the airframe was also used in the radar remedial program, coupled with a spare parts shortage for mandatory maintenance keeping it grounded from 9 April to 16 May. Three of four Pave Gat missions flown on 16 May were aborted due to equipment failures, causing loss of three more weeks of testing. Operational deployment was slipped to October 1971 on 13 May 1971.

Operation Ranch Hand was the name of the aerial application of defoliants in Southeast Asia, aimed at stripping away the dense jungle that hid enemy activities. The center for US testing of the herbicides used in Ranch Hand was Eglin AFB, primarily on Range C-52A.Humphrey, Kelly, \\"A poisoned legacy: Contractors who worked at Eglin's Agent Orange spray fields still live with the effects\\", Northwest Florida Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Sunday 23 August 2015, Volume 69, Number 203, page A1. For ten years, 1961 to 1971, 222,530 liters of herbicides (Agents Purple, Orange, White and Blue) were sprayed at a test grid on the base reservation. These herbicides were estimated to contain at least 3.1 kg of dioxin. Soil sampling at the test site conducted in 1970‚Äì1987 confirmed that there was TCDD contamination, though only about 1 percent remained. \\"Researchers theorized that much of the dioxin was broken down in the hot Florida sun or relocated due to wind or water erosion. At the storage and loading site west of the airstrip, residual dioxin was also found. Mitigation efforts were conducted, including the construction of a concrete drainage ditch and the building of a sediment pond to keep the dioxin from migrating into the nearby ravine and water bodies that lead to the city of Fort Walton Beach water supply. In 2001, the area around Hardstand 7 was capped with concrete and remediation activities concluded.\\" The 55th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, equipped with HC-130H Hercules, was reassigned from McCoy AFB, Florida, to Eglin AFB on 25 June 1971.

North American Rockwell Block 1 Apollo Command Module, serial 007, a Block 1 spacecraft, built for training and Earth-orbit missions, delivered to NASA in 1966 (and originally identical to CM 012 in which astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee died in the 1967 launchpad fire), after serving as a ground test vehicle was modified in 1967 for use in water-survival training. As part of their training, astronauts inside the capsule were dropped into the Gulf of Mexico by a crane from an aircraft carrier to simulate the force of splashdown. Apollo crews also trained for extended recovery by remaining at sea for several days at a time in the Command Module. This prepared astronauts for the possibility of a splashdown far from the planned recovery site. In 1971, CM 007 was transported to Eglin Air Force Base, where it was exposed to cold water and cold air during testing through 1973 for the forthcoming Skylab program. It was displayed at several open houses during this period at the base. The Command Module survived the tests only to end up in an equipment lot of the Houston Department of Public Works, where it remained for 12 years. In 1988, CM 007 was restored for the Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington, where it is now preserved, by the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center.North American Rockwell Block 1 Apollo Command Module 007 ‚Äì Manufacturer was North American ‚Äì Rockwell .

Fairchild AU-23A Peacemaker, 72-1316, at Eglin AFB, Florida during 1972 In May 1971, the Aeronautical Systems Division at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, initiated the program Credible Chase to evaluate the potential use of armed light utility short takeoff and landing aircraft in Southeast Asia. The program was designed to add mobility and firepower to the Republic of Vietnam Air Forces in a relatively short time. Two commercial aircraft were selected for testing: the Fairchild Porter and the Helio Stallion. Initial performance testing was conducted with leased aircraft (Porter N352F, c/n 2011Pilatus-history-and- news: Fairchild...AU-23A...Credible Chase...USAF...OV12A...US Navy.

The Porter, designated AU-23A, was fitted with a side-firing 20mm XM-197 Gatling cannon, four wing pylons and a center fuselage station for external ordnance. The 20mm cannon was essentially a three barrel version of the M61 Vulcan 6-barrel 20mm cannon. The aircraft could carry a variety of ordnance including forward firing gun pods, 500- and 250-pound bombs, napalm units, cluster bomb units, flares, rockets, smoke grenades and propaganda leaflet dispensers. The combat evaluation, PAVE COIN, was done in June and July 1971.Factsheets: Fairchild AU-23A . Nationalmuseum.af.mil. Retrieved on 2011-10-31. The AU-24A Stallion had the same side-mounted gun, as well as five underwing and fuselage stations. In January 1972, the second test phase for the AU-24A began at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla. The initial aircraft used, 72-1319, was leased from Helio and retained its civilian configuration, but it allowed basic flight testing to begin. The combat evaluation of the Credible Chase program was canceled in February 1972, but the initial (stateside) evaluation was kept on the program schedule. The first combat equipped AU-24A was delivered on 4 March 1972, and operational test and evaluation began on 17 March, but was delayed after a review of contractor quality control began on 3 April. On 10 April, the review imposed a number of flight restrictions on the AU-24A limiting maximum airspeed, dive and bank angles, and all instrument, weather and night test flights. The OT&E; of the AU-24A was officially started over on 22 April, and by 3 May, the aircraft was again in trouble. This time the problem was a dynamic instability during flight. The problems were resolved by 12 May, and the test program continued until completion on 22 May. Starting on 28 June, the AU-24As were flown to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz. for storage. The Credible Chase program was canceled and no AU-24A was delivered to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force.Factsheets: Helio AU-24A . Nationalmuseum.af.mil. Retrieved on 2011-10-31. The 4400th Special Operations Squadron (Provisional) was created to complete the operational test and evaluation of the Credible Chase aircraft. The first AU-23A, 72-1306 was delivered to the 4400th SOS on 2 January 1972, followed by two more aircraft (72-1304 and -1305) at the end of the month. Testing continued until 4 February, when the three aircraft were grounded because of cracks in the rudder assemblies. The first three aircraft were returned to Fairchild for repair and delivery of new aircraft resumed in late April 1972. On 10 May 1972, an AU-23A, 72-1309, crashed after an in-flight engine failure. The pilot was not hurt, but all AU-23As were grounded until 22 May, during the accident investigation. The last AU-23A was delivered on 7 June and testing was completed on 28 June. The 4400th recommended the aircraft not be used in combat without a major upgrade program. Specific problems identified included a slow combat speed (135 knots), a low working altitude, no capability for \\"zoom\\" escapes after delivering ordnance and a complete lack of armor protection for the crew and vital aircraft systems. On 30 June 1972, the 4400th SOS ferried the AU-23As to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, for storage. The climatic facility was named the McKinley Climatic Laboratory on 12 June 1971 after the late Col. Ashley C. McKinley. A new base exchange, commissary and movie theatre were constructed in the Bens Lake area of the base in 1972. The 823d Civil Engineering Squadron (Heavy Repair), (RED HORSE), inactivated in Southeast Asia in 1971, was reactivated at Eglin AFB on 1 June 1972, incorporating elements of the 557th CES (HR), which was inactivated at Eglin the same day.

In 1972, the 58th Tactical Fighter Squadron, 33d Tactical Fighter Wing, was deployed to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, under what was known as the \\"Summer Help Program.\\" During this period, the 58th was credited as the first temporary duty unit to down an enemy aircraft. On 2 June 1972, Major Philip W. Handley and Lieutenant John J. Smallwood shot down a MiG-19 with a 300 round burst from their M-61A Vulcan Cannon, disproving the perception that American aircrews had lost their dogfighting skills (Smallwood was later shot down and to this day remains listed as missing in action). Just over two months later on 12 August 1972, another 58th Phantom II was credited with a kill after shooting down a MiG-21 with an AIM-7 Sparrow, a radar guided missile. This second kill was the last credited to the 58th during its six-month rotation in Southeast Asia.58th Fighter Squadron. 33fw.acc.af.mil In early 1972, a squadron of Republic F-84F Thunderstreaks were retired to Eglin to serve as range targets.

One example, taken out to the range, was retrieved by helicopter for the infant Air Force Armament Museum. The final QF-104 Starfighter drone operation took place 3 July 1972 when 56-0737 flew an unmanned mission and was killed by an AIM-9J Sidewinder missile, its 21st unmanned mission. The two F-104Ds assigned to base flight (formerly assigned at George AFB, California), are turned over to the Puerto Rico Air National Guard as the QF-104 program ends in the summer of 1972. One of these airframes, 57-1331, later returns to Eglin in 1975 for display at the infant Air Force Armament Museum. The last ADM-20C Quail operational test was flown at the Eglin AFB water test area on 13 July 1972. The sole Windecker YE-5A low-visibility airframe, 73-1653, c/n 005, delivered to the Air Force in February 1973, underwent radar reflectivity testing for five years at Eglin beginning in 1973 by both the USAF and Lockheed.

This airframe was destroyed in a crash during a classified test in 1985 after it had left Eglin. Late Cold War era In April 1973, Pave Deuce, an Eglin AFB program calling for low- cost, full-size, supersonic targets, was awarded to Sperry Rand Corporation to convert F-102A Delta Daggers into QF-102A (manned) and PQM-102A (unmanned) drones.Knaack (1978) p. 170. Southern Airways operated its last Martin 4-0-4 flights serving Eglin and the Okaloosa Air Terminal in 1973, the last reciprocating-engined airliners to serve the base, with all further service now provided by Southern's DC-9 fleet. The last AGM-28 Hound Dog operational test was flown at the Eglin AFB water test area on 24 July 1973.

Test Site C-74L on Range 21 West in Walton County was used for weapons testing of the pre-production Gatling-type rotary cannon from 1974 to 1978 using various types of rounds, including depleted uranium. An estimated 16,315 pounds of DU was expended at the site. Approximately 9,257 pounds of DU were collected and disposed of during remediation activities conducted between March 1978 and June 1987. The remainder of the material has since been remediated, was dispersed or vaporized as part of DU ordnance testing, or remains onsite and requires remediation.

First year enplaned passengers totaled 97,000 with Southern Airways as the sole airline with 12 departing flights daily. A new sun, wind, rain and dust facility was completed in April 1975 as an addition to the McKinley Climatic Laboratory. Designed to withstand internal winds of 100 mph and maintain temperatures from 60 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit, the new addition simulated extreme climatic conditions for ground vehicles. Rain could be simulated from one to 15 inches per hour and humidity controlled between 20 and 100 percent. Silicon dust could be used to simulate intense dust storms, the powder being collected and re-used following tests.

The 432nd's participation was to fly four EW sorties with AQM-34V vehicles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The squadron deployed from Davis-Monthan with three DC-130 launch planes with four drones uploaded on each, three CH-3 MARS recovery helicopters, a TPW-2 Ground Director and a minimum of ground-handling equipment and spares. Two additional DC-130 aircraft were flown in from Davis-Monthan with spares for the launch planes, and a third came in at the end of the exercise to transport the Ground Director back home. The EW mission for the exercise was to lay a chaff corridor at 3,000 feet MSL while heading toward the coastline. The two drones, flying two minutes apart in trail formation, were then climbed to 19,000 and 20,000 feet MSL respectively, where they took up an active jamming orbit. The drones were followed by an E6A [sic] or EB-57 aircraft which also dispensed chaff and provided EW active jamming through the chaffed corridor. The operation clearly demonstrated TAC's philosophy of sending in the decoy drones first to protect the manned jammers and fighter planes to follow.' Gene Juberg's field report concluded, stating that all objectives of the meet were met with unqualified success from the performance of the AQM-34V.

Following Saddam Hussein's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, 24 F-15s of the 58th Fighter Squadron, 33d Fighter Wing, under the command of Colonel Rick Parsons, departed Eglin for King Faisal Air Base, Saudi Arabia as part of the build up of coalition forces in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. In the early morning hours of 17 January 1991, Operation Desert Storm commenced. Captain John J. B. Kelk claimed the first aerial victory by downing the first MiG-29. As the war progressed, the 58th flew 1,689 combat sorties and destroyed 15 other enemy aircraft. During the course of the war, the 58th accomplished feats that no other coalition member matched including: the most air-to-air kills, the most double kills, and the most sorties and hours flown by any F-15 unit in theater. The 58th also destroyed the most MiG-29s (a total of five) and had the only wing commander who had an air-to-air victory. The GAR-4A Falcon missile returned to the USAF test inventory in the early 1990s. During an unusual test, an F-15 Eagle engaged a C-141 Starlifter, (61-2777), over the Eglin AFB range with four GAR-4As. The F-15 launched the GAR-4As outside of their effective range to evaluate the Starlifter‚Äôs Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS). The purpose of the test was to evaluate the ability of the MAWS to detect an incoming missile and activate countermeasures systems. On 19 February 1991, the 3246th Test Wing conducted a short notice test to certify the GBU-28/B ‚ÄúBunker Buster,‚Äù developed in only eight weeks, on the F-111 for immediate deployment for Desert storm. On 9 July 1991, Lockheed F-117A, 84-0824, c/n A.4038, was flown to Eglin for climatic testing. The aircraft was prepped and then installed in the chamber using special fixtures and tooling designed to allow simulation of conditions in flight. Testing began under cold weather conditions (‚àí40 ¬∞F ambient) on 15 July 1991, and continued through conditions of snow loading, blowing snow, hail, freezing rain, ice and fog, hot weather (140 ¬∞F ambient), water intrusion testing, and concluded in January 1992 with tropical rain and human factors evaluations. Cold soaks to ‚àí60 ¬∞F and 160 ¬∞F were also included. A typical mission \\"flown\\" included pre-flight, pilot ingress, APU and engine start, full power takeoff, cruise, systems operation and weapon delivery, landing, pilot egress, and post flight inspection.

Following bombing difficulties in Operation Desert Storm, the Air Force sought an all-weather \\"smart\\" bomb that could work regardless of smoke, fog, dust, and cloud cover, with research, development, testing and evaluation (RDT&E;) of an \\"adverse weather precision guided munition\\" beginning in 1992. Several proposals were considered, including a radical concept that used GPS. To identify the technical risk associated with an INS/GPS guided weapon, the Air Force created in early 1992 a rapid-response High Gear program called the \\"JDAM Operational Concept Demonstration\\" (OCD) at Eglin Air Force Base. Honeywell, Interstate Electronics Corporation, Sverdrup Technology, and McDonnell Douglas were hired to help the 46th Test Wing demonstrate the feasibility of a GPS weapon within one year. The OCD program fitted a GBU-15 guided bomb with an INS/GPS guidance kit and on 10 February 1993, dropped the first INS/GPS weapon from an Air Force F-16 on a target downrange. Five more tests were run in various weather conditions, altitudes, and ranges.INS/GPS Operational Concept Demonstration (OCD) High Gear Program, IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine, 8 August 1994.

In addition, he studies cognitive abilities, with reference to short-interval judgment, in human subjects. He also studied cognitive abilities involving case construction behavior in a species of bagworm moth. He demonstrated alteration in temporal organization in human subjects, who carry out rotational shift duties. He reported disruption of circadian rhythm in cognitive judgment of short-time intervals in shift workers. He proposed a model for optimization of human shift work. He reported that shift work might reduce human longevity. He reported disruption of circadian clock in cancer patients and suggested implementation of patient- specific chronotherapeutic protocol. He demonstrated functional circadian oscillators in cave fish and reinterpreted findings of others to rule out the hypothesis of clock regression in hypogean fish. He reported rhythmic pattern in case architecture of bagworm moth. He proposed a model illustrating the ability of this moth to process thorn length and distance signals hierarchically during case construction through toggling its preference between thorns and cut-twigs.

After showing little promise as a two-year-old in 1936, Mid-day Sun improved into top class performer at three. In 1937 he won five races including The Derby and the Hardwicke Stakes at Royal Ascot. He was retired to stud in 1938 but had little success as a stallion. He was the first winner of the Derby at Epsom to be owned by a woman. Background Mid-day Sun was a bay horse bred in England by W. T. Sears. As a yearling he was sent to the sales at Newmarket but attracted little interest and did not reach his reserve price of 2,000 guineas. Shortly afterwards, a private sale was arranged by the trainer Fred Butters, acting on the advice of his more famous elder brother Frank, and the colt entered the ownership of Lettice Miller (officially Mrs G. B. Miller). Butters, took charge of the colt‚Äôs training at his stables at Kingsclere, Berkshire. Mid-day Sun‚Äôs sire, Solario was an outstanding racehorse who won the Coronation Cup and the Ascot Gold Cup in 1926, before going on to be Champion sire three times. His dam, Bridge of Allan, was a minor winner and a half sister of the 2000 Guineas runner-up Knockando. Racing career =1936: two-year-old season= Mid-day Sun did little in his two-year-old season to suggest that he was a potential Classic winner. He lost his first six races, his best effort coming when he finished sixth to Perifox in the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood. At Newmarket on October 13 Mid-day Sun recorded his first win when carrying a light weight in a one-mile Nursery (a handicap race for two-year-olds). He then finished second in a similar event at the same course two weeks later, failing to give seventeen pounds to the winner. At the end of the season he was rated on 99 pounds, more than thirty pounds below the top-rated colt Foray. =1937: three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, Mid-day Sun won the Free Handicap at Newmarket in April, receiving six pounds from the filly Exhibitionnist. The form of the race did not look particularly strong, but was boosted later in the year when the runner-up won both the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks. On his next start, Mid-day Sun proved himself capable of competing with the best colts by finishing third of the eighteen runners behind Le Ksar and Goya in the 2000 Guineas. He then prepared for the Derby by winning a slowly run race for the Lingfield Derby Trial. In the build-up to the Classic he was reported to be \\"in demand\\" in the betting market but was not among the favourites. At Epsom, Mid-day Sun was ridden by the Irish jockey Michael Beary and started at odds of 100/7 (just over 14/1) in a field of twenty-one. The race was run in bright sunshine in front of the customary immense crowd including the King and Queen. Mid-day Sun was held up in the early stages as Renardo and then Fairford led the field. Le Grand Duc moved into the lead from Goya in the straight, heading a closely packed group of seven horses, with Beary moving his horse into contention. Mid-day Sun produced a ‚Äúdazzling run‚Äù to move through the middle of the group, and pass Le Grand Duc inside the final furlong. Once in front, he held off the late challenge of Sandsprite to win by one and a half lengths. Mrs Miller called the result \\"the moment of my life\\" before explaining that she would prefer to celebrate with \\"a cup of tea\\" followed by a quiet dinner with her husband and mother. Beary felt that the colt had been \\"running lazily\\" in the early stages, but said that he had \\"responded gallantly\\" at the finish. The quality of the race was, however, questioned by some including the Sunday Times who pointed out that the proximity of the 100/1 outsider Sandsprite made the form look suspect. Mid-day Sun was then sent to Royal Ascot where he was matched against leading older horses including the American-bred Flares in the Hardwicke Stakes. He took the lead early in the straight and pulled clear to win decisively, returning to \\"a big reception\\". According to Butters, the race \\"took nothing out of him\\", and he was then aimed at the St Leger at Doncaster. He prepared for the Classic by winning the Manton Stakes at Salisbury on August 23. In the St Leger Mid-day Sun started favourite but Beary struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight and although the colt finished strongly he finished third, beaten just over a length by Chulmleigh with Fair Copy second. =1938: four-year-old season= Mid-day Sun was kept in training as a four-year-old and aimed at the Ascot Gold Cup. His temperament became a problem however and it proved impossible to train him effectively. He was retired to stud without racing in 1938. Assessment Mid-day Sun was officially rated the best three-year-old colt of 1937 by the Jockey club handicapper. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Mid-day Sun on 126, making him a ‚Äúpoor‚Äù Derby winner. Stud career Mid-day Sun was not a successful stallion although his opportunities were limited by his standing at a small stud farm during wartime. His best offspring was Sterope, a leading miler who won the Cambridgeshire Handicap twice, but was excluded from most top events by his status as a gelding. In 1950 Mid-day Sun was exported to New Zealand where he died in 1954.

A concession to the south of the mine has recently been opened to exploitation. Original open pit mine The reduced facies-type deposit of copper and cobalt was mined from 1913 to 1949 by the Union Miniere du Haut Katanga. In October 1928 the mine employed 1,466 men. That month there were two deaths, and 16.37% of the men fell ill. The mine was hit by arson and sabotage in 1938 by miners dissatisfied with their pay and working conditions. In December 1941 the miners, and those in other mines in the area, began a general strike. While the open pit mine was in operation a total of 4.1 million tonnes of ore were extracted with an average grade of 8.3% copper. Later exploitation plans A 2007 assessment of the main Luishia mining permit noted that it included about over most of the mine and resource development area, including the existing and planned mining pit. China Overseas Engineering Co. Ltd held 72% with the balance of 28% held by a G√©camines subsidiary. There was a defined total resource of 26.1 million tonnes of ore with average grades of 2.95% copper and 0.68% cobalt. The review considered it would be practical to produce 3,000 tonnes of ore per day ore using large-scale open cut mining. As of 2008 the main Luishi orebody was controlled by a consortium owned by Chinese and local investors. Compagnie Miniere du Sud Katanga (CMSK), owned 60% by Enterprise G√©n√©rale Malta Forrest, a subsidiary of Groupe Forrest International and 40% by G√©camines, had exploitation rights in the zone, which as of 2011 were in the exploration phase. CMSK's main operation was at the Luiswishi Mine, to the southeast near Lubumbashi. Luishia South The Luisha South project is northwest of Lubumbashi and covers an area of . It lies to the south of the main Luishi orebody. The Kipoi copper / cobalt exploration project of Tiger Resources lies to the southeast. Luisha South includes a small historical open pit mine and waste rock pile, as well as the underlying Roan group sediments assumed to hold major deposits of copper and cobalt. The Luisha South ore was explored between 1923 and 1928 through shafts and tunnels, finding that there was about 350,000 tonnes of ore at 8.6% copper. Most of this was later mined in a small open pit. Since closure, artisanal miners have continued to work the site sporadically. The pit is in the northwest corner of the property at coordinates . A permit to exploit the project was issued in March 2006. Chevalier Resources acquired 57% of the project. In November 209 African Metals Corporation announced a binding letter of intent to buy Chevalier. In June 2011 African Metals gave an initial estimate for its Luisha South Stockpile. There was an inferred 370,000 tonnes of ore at 1.0% copper and 0.5% cobalt. In August 2011 the company issued an updated estimate for the project as a whole. There was an inferred 14.7 million tonnes of ore at 1.1% copper and 0.3% cobalt, giving 161,700 tonnes of contained copper metal and 44,100 tonnes of contained cobalt metal. In September 2011 African Metals said a subsidiary had purchased a Dense Media Separation plant and other equipment in preparation for mining.

Suslovic (born November 17, 1959) is an American politician and former member of the Portland, Maine City Council. Suslovic, a Democrat, previously represented part of Portland in the Maine House of Representatives from 2002 to 2004 and served as the ceremonial mayor of Portland from 2007 to 2008. Education and State Legislature Suslovic, born in Methuen, Massachusetts in 1959, attended Phillips Academy and proceeded to earn a bachelor's degree from Wesleyan University, where he majored in Government. In 2002, Suslovic ran and defeated incumbent John F. McDonough for the Democratic nomination for District 32 in the Maine House of Representatives. McDonough registered as a Republican after his defeat and was nominated by Maine Republicans as a replacement, only to be defeated by Suslovic again in the 2002 general election. Suslovic served on the State and Local Government, Taxation, Joint Select Committee on Regionalization and Community Cooperation committees during his two years in the House of Representatives. In the 2004 general election Suslovic was defeated for re-election by Green Independent and fellow incumbent John Eder following a controversial redistricting process which involved a lawsuit by the Green Independent Party claiming the Democrats sought to gerrymander Eder out of office. The lawsuit was unsuccessful and Eder moved across Portland's West End to stay in district. Election to City Council In 2005, Suslovic was elected to the Portland's City Council and served as the ceremonial mayor from 2007 to 2008. During his term on the Council, a discussion arose regarding plans to redevelop the Maine State Pier on Commercial Street on Portland's Waterfront. The majority of Suslovic's fellow Democrats supported a plan by Ocean Properties, which was strongly allied with Maine's Governor John Baldacci. However, Suslovic sided with the three Green Independents and one Republican on the Council and backed the plan by the Olympia Companies. In a competitive, four-way race in 2008, former Ocean Properties employee Dory Waxman defeated Suslovic's bid to return to the City Council. Return to City Council and current work In 2010, Suslovic sought to return to the Portland City Council, entering the race for the District 3 seat. Suslovic's opponent was Will Mitchell, the son of 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Libby Mitchell. Despite Mitchell receiving the endorsements of multiple City Councilors, Suslovic won the election with 58% of the vote and returned to the City Council for another three-year term. During his term on the City Council, Suslovic has worked on a variety of issues, including improving public transportation in Portland, increasing environmentally sustainable practices in area schools and businesses, and advocating for gun control laws that keep firearms from falling in the wrong hands. As a member of the Executive Committee and Recycling Committee of ecoMaine, Suslovic traveled to Arkhangelsk, Russia, a sister city of Portland, as part of an environmental action team to share best practices and discuss with city officials how to solve solid waste management issues. Suslovic has also led the efforts to encourage composting in Portland's public schools and chairs the Green Packaging Working Group, which is tasked with developing an ordinance to ban the use of containers made from polystyrene foam and to identify ways to reduce the use of plastic bags. Suslovic has worked to advance public transportation in the Southern Maine region through his work as vice-president of the Board of Directors of the Greater Portland Transit District (Metro). Suslovic has worked to improve public transportation in Portland and has also advocated for continuing the funding of public transportation in nearby communities in order to support a regional economy. A board member of Maine Citizens Against Handgun Violence, Suslovic has advocated for local municipalities to have the flexibility to craft gun laws that are more strict than state statutes. Suslovic has advocated for enact ordinances that prohibit weapons in public buildings and at public gatherings. Suslovic endorsed Eliot Cutler in the 2014 gubernatorial election. In the 2016 election, Suslovic faced a challenge from 25-year-old political newcomer Brian Batson. Suslovic lost to Batson 3,561 to 3,219. Personal life Suslovic lives with his wife, Jennifer Southard, and three children in Portland's Oakdale neighborhood.

This was the band's ninth studio album and their last for Columbia Records. The album peaked at number 165 on the Billboard albums chart. It contained one charting single, \\"You're the One\\" (US #106, AC #6). The personnel changes in the band continued with Mike Stern replacing Georg Wadenius on electric guitar, Danny Trifan replacing Ron McClure on bass, and Forest Buchtell replacing Joe Giorgianni on trumpet. Percussionist Don Alias left the band, and Mike Corbett was added on background vocals. Famed bassist Jaco Pastorius, who had been discovered and signed to Epic Records by Bobby Colomby, was briefly in the band around this time but did not appear on the album. More Than Ever was produced by Bob James who brought in such legendary session players as Steve Khan on guitar, Richard Tee on keyboards, Eric Gale on guitar, Hugh McCracken on guitar, and Eric Weissberg on banjo and dobro along with vocalist Patti Austin on background vocals to complement the regular BS&T; lineup. The album had an unusual cover design, simply presenting a photo of the vinyl record itself. More Than Ever was re-released on CD in 2003 on the Wounded Bird label along with Sony Music. Reception The Allmusic review by Bruce Eder says: \\"For the first time since its second album, the group -- with only drummer Bobby Colomby left from the original lineup and Bob James producing -- sounds bold, enthused, and fully positive in its approach. The sound is a little more R&B; oriented and less rocking than the older lineup, which actually makes a better fit overall -- Thomas' singing style is a bit dated, from a tradition of '60s blue-eyed soul that seems fine, but which was really out-of-place amid the disco boom of the second half of the '70s.\\" Track listing #\\"They\\" (David Clayton-Thomas, William Daniel Smith) - 6:26 #\\"I Love You More Than Ever\\" (Allan Langdon, Douglas Lenier) - 5:27 #\\"Katy Bell\\" (Stephen C.

At the age of 16, Azalea moved to the United States from Sydney, Australia to pursue a career in music. Azalea earned public recognition after releasing the music videos for her songs \\"Pussy\\" and \\"Two Times\\" on YouTube, both of which gained rapid popularity. Azalea signed a recording contract with American rapper T.I.'s label Grand Hustle shortly afterward and released her debut mixtape, Ignorant Art (2011). Azalea's debut studio album, The New Classic (2014), peaked among the top five on several charts worldwide, but received mixed reviews from within the industry. The album eventually topped the Billboard Top R&B;/Hip- Hop Albums, making Azalea the first non-American female rapper to reach the top of the chart. The New Classic was preceded by Azalea's debut single \\"Work\\" and chart-topping single \\"Fancy\\", which hit the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Azalea was featured on Ariana Grande's single \\"Problem,\\" which peaked at number two behind \\"Fancy.\\" With these hits, Azalea joined the ranks of The Beatles as the only act to rank at number one and two simultaneously with their first two Hot 100 entries. In addition, she achieved three top ten hits simultaneously on the Hot 100 with the aforementioned songs and the album's fifth single, \\"Black Widow,\\" which debuted later that year. After her debut album, Azalea released a slew of singles to build anticipation for her intended second album, Digital Distortion. However, a series of conflicts with her label, as well as personal conflicts, resulted in the project being cancelled. Consequently, Azalea switched labels, releasing the EP Survive the Summer (2018) under Island Records. Further disagreements led to Azalea becoming an independent artist and creating her own label, Bad Dreams, through a distribution deal with Empire. Her second album, In My Defense, was released in 2019, followed by another EP, Wicked Lips, that same year. Since her debut, Azalea has sold 48 million records worldwide, with 22 million singles in the United States alone. Azalea's accolades include two American Music Awards, three Billboard Music Awards, an MTV Video Music Award, a People's Choice Award, four Teen Choice Awards and four Grammy Award nominations.

Her father, Brendan Kelly, was an Irish-Australian painter and comic artist, while her mother, Tanya, cleaned holiday houses and hotels. Azalea lived in a house that her father built by hand from mud-bricks, surrounded by of land. She has two siblings named Mathias and Emerald Kelly. According to Azalea, she has some Aboriginal (Indigenous Australian) ancestry: \\"My family came to Australia on the First Fleet. My family's been in that country for a long time, over 100 years.At the time of this statement, 223 years if First Fleeters If your family's lived in Australia for a long time, everyone has a little bit of [Aboriginal blood]. I know my family does because we have an eye condition that only Aboriginal people have.\\" Azalea has also said that her father \\"made her look at [art] as a teenager,\\" which has always influenced her life and work. She began rapping at age 14. Before embarking on a solo career, Azalea formed a group with two other girls from her neighborhood: \\"I was like, I could be the rapper. This could be like TLC. I'll be Left Eye.\\" Azalea eventually decided to disband the group because the other girls were not taking it seriously: \\"I take everything I do serious [sic]. I'm too competitive.\\" In pursuit of her desire to move to America, Azalea dropped out of high school. She worked and saved the money she earned by cleaning hotel rooms and holiday houses with her mother. She claims to have hated school, which, apart from art class, only made her miserable. She also said she had no friends and was teased for her homemade outfits. Azalea traveled to the United States in 2006, shortly before she turned 16. She told her parents she was going \\"on a holiday\\" with a friend, but eventually decided to stay and shortly afterward told them she was not coming back home: \\"I was drawn to America because I felt like an outsider in my own country, I was in love with hip hop, and America is the birthplace of that, so I figured the closer I was to the music, the happier I'd be. I was right.\\" She recalled, \\"My mum was crying, saying, 'Just be safe.' I was thinking, 'I'm going by myself. I'm fucking crazy!'.\\" After she arrived in the US, she received her General Educational Development (GED), and resided in the country on a visa waiver for six years, returning to Australia every three months to renew it.

She said: \\"The official date? Fucked if I know! It's done, it's so depressing to say this but it's the beginning of March, it's so far away but I just have to accept that.\\" She explained the reasons behind the delay: \\"It was supposed to be October but obviously I'm going on tour with Beyonc√© and they said I'm not allowed to put an album out while I'm on tour because I'll be trapped in Australia and I won't be able to do any TV appearances and I thought that's fair enough, that's three weeks and then they said 'You can't put an album out around Christmas time, that's a bad time' and I said 'What about January?' 'Well nobody gets back off holidays and then it's the BRIT Awards, you can't release an album, it's terrible for marketing' which brings me to February.\\" On 10 November 2013, Azalea performed \\"Blurred Lines\\" with Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards.

I don't want to go and promote my album and get asked about my relationship that has just crumbled.\\" Azalea released two singles, \\"Mo Bounce\\" and \\"Switch,\\" on 24 March 2017 and 19 May 2017 respectively. The latter track features Brazilian singer Anitta. Azalea promoted \\"Switch\\" through a performance on the 2017 iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards.

On 8 June 2018, the rapper revealed that Survive the Summer would be an EP.

Survive the Summer was released on 3 August 2018, and debuted at number 144 on the Billboard 200.

The song charted in the US and Scotland.  Artistry  = Musical style and influences = Azalea at the ESPYs in 2014 Although Azalea is Australian, she raps with a Southern U.S. accent. When she first moved to America, she was involved in the Southern hip hop scene of Miami and later Atlanta, which made it easy for her to cultivate the Southern influence in her music: \\"I lived in the South for five years; you pick up things from your surroundings and teachers. The people who taught me to rap are all from the South and so was the music I had listened to as a teen.\\" While Azalea's debut extended play, Glory, was intended to focus on hardcore rap, the EP also touched up on other genres including electronic dance music. Music critics have defined her singles \\"Fancy\\" and \\"Team\\" as electro-hop. At the age of 11, Azalea was infatuated with hip hop when she heard Tupac Shakur's \\"Baby Don't Cry (Keep Ya Head Up II)\\": \\"It was the song that made me fall in love with music and also what sparked my Tupac fascination. That would later make me pick up my own pen and write songs.\\" In her early interviews, Azalea regularly mentioned Shakur's influence: \\"I was sickly obsessed. I had every picture of Tupac ever printed on my wall.\\" She has credited Beyonc√© as an influence and Missy Elliott as the female rapper who she is influenced by and admires the most. Outside of music, her fashion sense is influenced by Grace Kelly, Lil' Kim, Gwen Stefani, the Spice Girls, Fran Drescher, Eve, Trina, Fergie, and Christina Aguilera. = Music videos = Azalea is often noted for her cinema-quality music videos which are often comedic and contain satire. Azalea has paid homage to a number of cult films from the 1990s and early 2000s in her music videos, among the most notable examples being Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1997) in \\"Work\\" (2013), Showgirls (1995) in \\"Change Your Life\\" (2013), Clueless (1995) in \\"Fancy\\" (2014), Kill Bill (2003) in \\"Black Widow\\" (2014), Earth Girls Are Easy (1988) in \\"Pretty Girls\\" (2015), and Romy and Michele's High School Reunion (1997) in \\"Fuck It Up\\" (2019), among others. Alongside those film references, eras of cinema are referenced in several other videos including the Bollywood- themed video for \\"Bounce\\" (2013) and the 1980s cop comedy-inspired video for \\"Trouble\\" (2015). Additionally, the video for \\"Murda Bizness\\" (2012) is reminiscent of the pageant culture shown in reality series Toddlers & Tiaras. Azalea has also been credited as a director for some of her music videos and often mentions the importance she attributes to them: \\"For me, visuals are as important as the music, I just love escapism and giving people something to escape to. To me, that's what art is.\\" = Public image = After initially resisting suggestions to try modeling, Azalea signed with model and celebrity agency Wilhelmina Models International Inc. in 2012. She featured in promotional ads for Los Angeles-based lifestyle brand Dim Mak's 2012 fall/winter collection. Also in 2012, Azalea was the face of Levi's \\"Go Forth\\" campaign. Azalea also appeared in House of Holland's first eyewear collection campaign. In July 2014, MTV announced that Azalea would be the host of the revived House of Style. Azalea appeared in the seventh installment of The Fast and the Furious film series, Furious 7, released in 2015. In August 2014, the New York Posts Page Six reported that Azalea had formed a footwear collaboration with Steve Madden. Their shoe collection was unveiled in February 2015. In October 2014, Azalea and her boyfriend Nick Young were announced as the new faces of Forever 21's 2014 holiday campaign. In April 2015, she signed on to be the 100th-birthday ambassador of Australian underwear and clothing company Bonds. In 2018, Azalea was announced as Monster Products's new spokesperson and starred in their Super Bowl LII commercial.  Controversy  = Accusations of cultural appropriation = In 2012, Azalea caused controversy for her song \\"D.R.U.G.S,\\" a remix of Kendrick Lamar's \\"Look Out for Detox,\\" having adapted one of its lyrics to \\"When the relay starts, I'm a runaway slave / Master,\\" leading her to release a letter online apologizing, stating that it was a \\"tacky and careless thing to say.\\" According to the British newspaper, The Guardian, there have been \\"accusations of racism against Azalea focused on her... insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation.\\" Salon writer Brittney Cooper critiqued Azalea's \\"co-optation and appropriation of sonic Southern Blackness, particularly the sonic Blackness of Southern Black women.\\"Cooper, Brittney (15 July 2014). \\"Iggy Azalea's Post-Racial Mess: America's Oldest Race Tale, Remixed\\". Salon. Her use of an African-American English accent has been compared to blackface and part of a \\"broad, vague area of white people pretending to be black: those who do it culturally, rather than cosmetically.\\" but also conversely as \\"wilful ignorance.\\" Both supporters and critics of Azalea's rise to fame within the hip hop industry noted that it was important to be inclusive while acknowledging and respecting the role of African- Americans in pioneering hip hop. After being asked to analyze and compare her speaking and rapping voice, linguistics professor David Crystal said Azalea might be doing it unconsciously to accommodate to the American rapping style, adding: \\"There are hardly any echoes of [Azalea's] original Australian accent in her speaking voice‚Äîjust the odd word (e.g. \\"own\\", \\"believe\\") and inflection. She has developed a mixed accent (like so many people have these days) as a result of her traveling around.\\" When asked about the validity to the criticisms leveled against her, Azalea stated: \\"Do you not like me because I rap with an American accent and I'm not American? Well, that's valid on some level because that's your opinion and I can't change that,\\" continuing, \\"But I'm not trying to sound black‚ÄîI just grew up in a country where on TV and in music and film, everyone was American or any Australian person in them put on an American accent. So I never saw it as strange at all.\\" = Comments on racism = In 2018, Azalea claimed that the history of racism in the United States causes its audiences to dismiss her, and claimed that she, \\"grew up in a situation that didn't involve any privilege and I worked really hard,\\" later reiterating on U.S. race relations: \\"I make 'black' music. I don't want people to think it's not something I care about. I want to make music for girls in the gym.\\" She stated, \\"It's important for music to reflect what is going on socially and for there to be those kinds of voices within the industry. But I want to be that person you can listen to for four minutes and not think about that stuff at all, and it's important to have that too [...] I'm not here to offer that commentary, but that doesn't mean I don't care.\\" In 2016, she lamented, \\"Many people think I still live in that bubble and that I don't understand that the United States is set up in a way that doesn't benefit minorities. I've lived here for 10 years now, and I don't want it to be that way either. I'm marrying a black man and my children will be half black‚Äî of course I care about these things.\\" She further dismissed the legitimacy of the racial controversy, citing sexism as the true cause of criticism. In a feature covering Azalea's career, Clove Hope wrote, \\"Rather than seeing race as an issue, Iggy focused on the trend of women in rap being over-policed and accused of not writing their own rhymes, while in the process overlooking how artists like herself and Macklemore hold a broader industry advantage, even as they feel like outcasts in their field.\\" In 2014, journalist Natalie Morin tracked down a history of homophobic and racist statements and sentiments from Azalea's social media accounts, which Azalea deleted, acknowledged and claimed were before her rise to fame. In 2016, Azalea was planning to release her second album titled, Digital Distortion, explaining its concept: addressing the criticisms against her: \\"some of them were fair and some of them, I think, were unfair. I just think it's interesting that we live in this age of digital distortion where we're all distorting each other and distorting ourselves and our perception of who we all are, and none of it is really accurate anymore.\\" She later credited the support she received from fellow rappers as giving her motivation facing the controversial claims in the media: \\"I grew up loving Missy Elliot, loving Lil' Kim or Trina and so I'm lucky I have those women I really idolized support me. So, I get a little bit confident in that, knowing the people I look up to appreciate what I'm doing.\\"  Personal life  In March 2015, while talking about her body shape with Vogue, Azalea revealed she had undergone breast augmentation, saying, \\"I did change something: Four months ago, I got bigger boobs! I'd thought about it my entire life,\\" adding she was sick of having to sew padding into her stage costumes and wanted to be able to wear lingerie without wiring. After initially resolving never to discuss it publicly as she didn't want other girls to feel bad about their bodies, she concluded, \\"But then, I decided I wasn't into secret-keeping.\\" In August 2015, she talked about having a nose job with Seventeen magazine, adding, \\"Your perception of yourself can change a lot over time, so I think it's important to wait and make sure it's the right choice. Plastic surgery is an emotional journey. ... There are things that I didn't like about myself that I changed through surgery. There are other things I dislike but I've learned to accept. It's important to remember you can't change everything. You can never be perfect.\\" In March 2018, Azalea was approved for permanent residence in the United States. Relationships In late 2011, Azalea began dating American rapper A$AP Rocky, whom she met through American record producer Chase N. Cashe. She confirmed that they were dating in a January 2012 interview with Vibe and, around this time, got the title of Rocky's breakout mixtape Live. Love. A$AP tattooed on her fingers.

He achieved international fame with the extended reportage Szib√©riai garnizon (\\"Siberian Garrison\\", 1927‚Äì8), which chronicles his own exotic experiences in World War I and the Russian Civil War. Locally, he is also known for his lifelong contribution to the political and cultural press of Transylvania. A Romanian national after 1920, Markovits divided himself between the Hungarian Romanian and Jewish communities, and was marginally affiliated with both the Ma art group and the Erd√©lyi Helikon writers. Rodion Markovitz was seen by his contemporaries as an eccentric, and some of his colleagues believed him a minor and incidental writer. He was also noted for his leftist inclinations, cemented during his personal encounter with Bolshevism but toned down during the final decades of his life. Although he continued to publish short stories until the 1940s, and wrote the sequel novel Aranyvonat (\\"Gold Train\\"), his work never again matched the success of Szib√©riai garnizon. His final home was the Banat city of Timi»ôoara, where he worked for the Romanian and Hungarian press, and eventually became a grassroots activist of the Hungarian People's Union. Biography =Early life and World War I= Culturally and ethnically, Markovits was of Hungarian Jewish extraction, and socially belonged to the lower classes.Ivan Sanders, \\"Transylvanism and Jewish Consciousness\\", Erd√©lyi Magyar Adatbank reprint (originally published in the Babe≈ü-Bolyai University Studia Judaica, 1996, p.61‚Äì67); retrieved November 11, 2011 His background may have been Jewish assimilationist, and he regarded himself as ethnically Hungarian, but his interest in maintaining links with secular Jewish culture put distance between him and the more committed assimilationists. Historian Attila Gid√≥ nevertheless includes Markovits among the most prominent Jews who helped promote, from within, the Hungarian urban culture of Transylvania.Attila Gid√≥, Studii de Atelier 17.

He spent part of his childhood in Szatm√°rn√©meti (today Satu Mare, Romania), the local urban center, where he attended Catholic school and then the K√∂lcsey Calvinist College. Young Markovits went on to study Law at Budapest (E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd) University, but mainly focused on his budding career as writer and cultural journalist, publishing with left-leaning or satirical periodicals such as Fidibusz, N√©pszava, F√ºggetlen, Ifj√∫ Er≈ëk, Korb√°cs, Szatm√°r √©s Vid√©ke and M√°rton Lov√°szy's Magyarorsz√°g. Upon graduation, he also worked as a lawyer.Andreescu et al., p.910 Romanian literary historian Cornel Ungureanu refers to World War I as Markovits' \\"first great journalistic adventure\\".Cornel Ungureanu, biographical note to Rodion Markovits, \\"Garnizoana din Siberia\\", in Babe≈£i & Ungureanu, p.312 Markovits was mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army a few months into the conflict. In early 1915, he was sent with the 12th Royal Hungarian Army infantry regiment to the Eastern Front,Markovits (1975), p.169‚Äì170 176‚Äì177 and was captured by the Russian military during summer 1916. His account places this event at the peak of Russia's Brusilov Offensive.Markovits (1975), p.101, 184 Also according to Markovits, the column of Hungarian captives (including much of the 12th) was ordered to the transit camp of Darnytsia (Kiev), then his contingent was carried by train to Kineshma and by boat to Makaryevo.Markovits (1975), p.103‚Äì145 Their rest was interrupted by news that they were to be moved into Siberia, and eventually they were relocated to the banks of the Usuri River, on Russia's nominal border with the Republic of China.Markovits (1975), p.145‚Äì177 =Revolutionary politics= Markovits spent the next seven years of his life in Siberia and the Russian Far East‚Äîfirst as a prisoner of war, then as a drifter. He was notably held in Krasnaya Rechka prison camp, where he founded a newspaper for Hungarian captives, Szib√©riai √öjs√°g.Markovits (1975), p.198‚Äì321 Here, the Austro-Hungarian captives were reached by news of the February Revolution, and began organizing themselves into political or national factions even before the October Revolution sparked chaos in their captors' ranks.Markovits (1975), p.282‚Äì321 Nominally free, the prisoners were left to fend for themselves: after the Russian Civil War began, they purchased a train and, with it, made is far west as Samara, passing by Bolshevik units and Czechoslovak Legions, and being then pushed back into Siberia by the war tide; some Hungarians left the convoy to join the Bolsheviks' Red Guards.Markovits (1975), p.321‚Äì350 Markovits was held in an isolated and improvised camp near Krasnoyarsk, where life conditions became brutal and the rank structure collapsed entirely.Markovits (1975), p.350‚Äì393 From this location, the entire group of Austro-Hungarians witnessed first hand the mutiny of Russian soldiers from the 30th Regiment, its repression by the White Army, followed by the mass murder of all disarmed rebels and the selective killing of Hungarians who supposedly helped them.Markovits (1975), p.393‚Äì398. See also Babe≈£i & Ungureanu, p.314‚Äì318 According to Markovits, the camp population took its revenge by firing on the retreating Whites of Aleksandr Kolchak, capturing some 8,000 men‚Äîan action which had the unwanted effect of bringing typhus into the camp.Markovits (1975), p.400‚Äì403. See also Babe≈£i & Ungureanu, p.319‚Äì321 Markovits survived the outbreak and joined the newly created Red Army, where he became political commissar at a brigade level.Andreescu et al., p.910‚Äì911 According to his own fictionalized account, he volunteered to help with the coal transports organized by the Red squadrons, and was rewarded with repatriation (through the Baltic states, East Prussia and then Poland).Markovits (1975), p.403‚Äì407. See also Babe≈£i & Ungureanu, p.321‚Äì323 By the time Markovits returned to Transylvania, the entire region had been united with Romania. He decided to settle in Satu Mare, where he opened a law practice and continued work for the local Hungarian press‚Äîas editor of Szamos daily and correspondent for Cluj's Keleti √öjs√°g. He made his return to literature with short stories, grouped as Ism√©t tal√°lkoztam Balthaz√°rral (\\"Once More, I Ran into Balthazar\\") and published in 1925. The former prisoner had remained a committed follower of Leninism, as described by Ungureanu: \\"Taking his place on the left's barricades, living intensely the utopian illusions of communism, Markovits was to illustrate, in the early 1920s (like Malraux, Wells, Shaw, Panait Istrati, Gide etc.), the frenzy of enrollment.\\" In the early to mid-1920s, Rodion Markovits came into contact with the socialist art magazine Ma, published in Vienna by Lajos Kass√°k and other leftist writers who opposed the regimes of Regency Hungary. Also left-leaning, the Romanian monthly Contimporanul paid homage to Ma as the regional ally of its own avant-garde program: \\"The reddish air of revolution has braided together the youth of Ma artists and the ideology of a revolution that might have realized their ideal. And the world awaited for the new Christ. But once the White reaction took over, Ma exiled itself to Vienna [...] A new period, a new foundation, a new language emerge with the adoption of collective Constructivism.\\"Cernat, p.247 Between the Constructivist cells of Ma and Contimporanul, and ensuring that the Hungarian and Romanian avant-gardes remained in contact, there was a cosmopolitan group of Transylvanian leftists: Markovits, Aurel Buteanu, K√°roly Endre, Robert Reiter and Julius Podlipny.Cernat, p.246 =Literary prominence= Szib√©riai garnizon was originally serialized by Keleti √öjs√°g during 1927.Simion, in Markovits (1975), p.7 The next year, it was reissued as two volumes. These caught the eye of fellow writer Lajos Hatvany, who undertook their translation into German, for Vossischen Zeitung and later for Ullstein-Verlag. The 1929 English version by George Halasz was published in the United States by Horace Liveright, and the first print was exhausted over a few months.E. L. B., \\"Book Reviews. Siberian Garrison\\", in Coast Artillery Journal, Nr. 2/1930, p.193 (digitized by the Defense Technical Information Center) A French translation was published by √âditions Payot in 1930.Pierre, passim The books were translated into some 12 other languages before 1933, Roxana OnicƒÉ, J√°nos Szekerny√©s, Memoria, un patrimoniu, at the Memoria Digital Library; retrieved November 11, 1011 reaching as far as Asia and South America and making Markovits an international celebrity of the interwar period. According to cultural historian Ivan Sanders, Markovits was, \\"for a time, the best-known Transylvanian writer in the world.\\" As commentators have since noted, Szib√©riai garnizon also announced to the world that Hungarian literature in Transylvania was coming of age, Ion Chinezu, \\"Aspecte din literatura maghiarƒÉ din Ardeal (1918‚Äì1928)\\", in Societatea de M√¢ine, Nr. 10/1930, p.201 (digitized by the Babe≈ü-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) even though its subject and content were largely dissonant with the aims of Transylvania's existing literary clubs. In the larger context of Hungarian literature as divided by the interwar borders, Markovits has drawn parallels with the war- themed literature of G√©za Gy√≥ni, Alad√°r Kuncz, M√°t√© Zalka and Lajos Zilahy.Arnold D. Harvey, A Muse of Fire: Literature, Art and War, The Hambledon Press, London, 1998, p.250. According to Ungureanu, solid links exist between Markovits and an entire category of Austro-Hungarian intellectuals who turned into revolutionaries. Ungureanu concludes: \\"Settled in the 'once upon a time' provinces of the Empire or wandering the world in search of a 'juster' cause, [these authors] give name to a finality ‚Äî a shipwreck.\\" Following the international confirmation, Markovits attracted interest among Transylvanian and Romanian writers of all cultures. The Bucharest daily Diminea≈£a featured the serialized Romanian-language version shortly after its German edition saw print. Meanwhile, the Transylvanian Hungarian editors of Erd√©lyi Helikon review asked Markovits to join their literary club and, in 1929, he visited them at Marosv√©cs-Br√¢ncovene≈üti. Helikon contributor Ern≈ë Ligeti left a memoir of the meeting, in which Markovits comes off as the uncommunicative eccentric. The puzzled and (according to Sanders) envious Ligeti noted that Markovits did not live up to the respect of his \\"penniless\\" fans, did not show any interest in Helikons educational agenda, and only \\"opened his mouth\\" to impart \\"droll anecdotes\\". =In Timi»ôoara= After February 1931, Rodion Markovits moved to the Banat's cultural center, Timi»ôoara, having been granted an editor's position at Temesv√°ri H√≠rlap (the Hungarian and liberal daily of L√°szl√≥ Pog√°ny). This relocation, Ungureanu notes, was the end of his communist engagements, and his reinvention as \\"a reasonable newspaperman\\". Markovits' writing was later featured in the Romanian-language magazine Vrerea, put out by the left-wing poet Ion Stoia-Udrea. Their common agenda, also shared by Timi»ôoaran intellectuals Virgil Birou, Zolt√°n Frany√≥, Andrei A. Lillin and J√≥zsef M√©liusz, defined itself around notions of multiculturalism and class conflict.Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer, Nicolae Harsanyi, \\"Literary Production in a Marginocentric Cultural Node: The Case of Timi»ôoara\\", in Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer (eds.), History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe, Vol. II, John Benjamins, Amsterdam & Philadelphia, 2004, p.113. In a 1935 interview, he declared his \\"spontaneous, sincere and complete affiliation\\" to the proposals for greater cooperation between Hungarian and Romanian authors. M. G. Samarineanu, \\"Scriitorii maghiari. RƒÉspunsul la ancheta revistei Familia al d-lui Markovits Rodion\\", in Familia, Nr. 9-10/1935, p.76-77 (digitized by the Babe≈ü-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) These years saw the publication of Markovits' two new books: the novels Aranyvonat and S√°nta farsang (\\"Limp Carnival\\"), and the short prose collection Reb Ancsli √©s m√°s avasi zsid√≥kr√≥l sz√≥l√≥ sz√©phist√≥ri√°k (\\"Stories About Reb Anschl and Other Jews from the Mountains\\"). According to Ivan Sanders, \\"Markovits's subsequent novels were not nearly as successful as Siberian Garrison.\\" Ligeti, who recalled that Markovits fared badly in his journalistic career, mentions that Reb Ancsli... required its author to peddle his way back to the publishers' attention. Markovits survived World War II from his new home in the Banat, while Regency Hungary incorporated his Northern Transylvanian place of birth. By 1944, Romania had control over both regions, and a transition to communism was first envisaged. At the time, Markovits became a volunteer activist of the Hungarian People's Union, a regional and ethnic partner of the Romanian Communist Party. He resumed his journalistic activity, writing for various Magyar papers in Romania and the Republic of Hungary (K√©pes √öjs√°g, Szabad Sz√≥, Utunk, Vil√°g), gave public readings of his newer works, and lectured at the B√©la Bart√≥k Summer University. For a while, Markovits was also president of the Association of Banat Hungarian Writers. Rodion Markovits died unexpectedly, in his sleep, on August 27, 1948, and was buried at the Timi»ôoara Jewish Cemetery. Literary work Ism√©t tal√°lkoztam Balthaz√°rral was in fact Markovits' earliest account of his Siberian trek. Writing in 1930 for the Transylvanian periodical Societatea de M√¢ine, literary critic Ion Chinezu argued that the volume was merely negligent: \\"The mannerism of these Siberian memoirs, written with coffee house negligence, was not a good recommendation.\\" By contrast, Szib√©riai garnizon survives as Markovits' one great book. Chinezu even ranks it better than the period's other war novels (All Quiet on the Western Front), since, beyond \\"fashion and psychosis\\", it \\"has remarkable qualities\\". An editorial review in the US Field Artillery Branch Coast Artillery Journal also noted: \\"Siberian Garrison, by sheer force of merit, has become the literary sensation of Europe\\". Overall, reviewers agree that the volume is hard to classify in the grid of established genres. Although often read as a novel (a \\"documentary novel\\", Sanders suggests), Szib√©riai garnizon carries the subtitle of \\"collective reportage\\". It is a second-person narrative focused on a Budapest lawyer, very likely Markovits' alter ego, who interprets things around him through the grid of objectivity, common sense and boredom.Simion, in Markovits (1975), p.5-7 Coast Artillery Journal described Markovits' \\"unforgettable\\" creation as \\"in a class of its own\\": equal parts novel, diary, historical account and \\"war book\\". Szib√©riai garnizon, Chinezu notes, lacks all the formal qualities of a novel and veers into \\"clicking monotony\\", but, \\"for all its longueurs, is lively and propels itself into the reader's awareness.\\" Similarly, La Quinzaine Critique columnist Andr√© Pierre reported: \\"The work is located outside the frame of literature, and constitutes a seething document of life, rich in hallucinatory visions.\\"Pierre, p.336 Reviewer Al. Simion writes that the book has as its fortes the \\"concreteness of images\\", a \\"gentle or not so gentle\\" irony, and, overall, \\"a limpidness reminding one about the clarity of deepest wells\\"; the book's universe, he argues, is \\"flat perhaps, but transparent\\". Coast Artillery Journal found the narrative to be \\"distinctly Slavic\\", \\"introspective, analytical, sometimes morbid, with a fatalistic acceptance of the inevitable\\". To the background of historical events, Szib√©riai garnizon explores existential themes. According to Chinezu, the text is important for showing the alienation of a prisoner, the man's transformation into \\"anonymous digit\\", and the apathetic crowd into which he submerges. Characters fall into two main categories: those who conveniently forget their countries of birth for the duration of their ordeal, and those who miss them so much that they risk escaping and making the perilous journey across Asia. The one sustained effort against apathy is mounted by a militaristic and loyalist group of prisoners, who establish a Siberian branch of Turul Society. Markovits retells the dramatic failure of their honor system, and the ridiculousness of their cultural endeavors, with subdued irony (over what Chinezu calls his \\"many acid pages\\"). Al. Simion also notes that, in their Siberian exile, the prisoners come to understand the fragility of their own Empire.Simion, in Markovits (1975), p.6 Beyond commentary on the \\"burlesque bankruptcy of militarism\\", the reportage is a humorous critique of capitalism. Chinezu reads this in Markovits' depiction of officers, including aged ones, who quickly retrain and build themselves lucrative careers as shoemakers or shopkeepers. The Romanian critic concludes: \\"the eternal opposition of exploiters and exploited takes its form here, in the heart of Asia.\\" The spark of revolution achieves the destruction of social convention, but also replaces monotony with the presentment of doom. \\"At one with the events,\\" Simion writes, \\"the individual or collective dramas and tragedies unfold in accelerated rhythms, in an often demented cavalcade. The extraordinary, the apocalyptic are metamorphosed into diurnal experience.\\" According to Pierre, Markovits' literary effort is on par with the published diaries of another Siberian captive, Edwin Erich Dwinger. Dwinger and the Hungarian author depict \\"the same destitution, the same sexual perversions, a disruption of ideas and convictions after the Russian Revolution, the camp's transformation into a workers' phalanst√®re.\\" With Reb Ancsli √©s m√°s avasi zsid√≥kr√≥l sz√≥l√≥ sz√©phist√≥ri√°k, Markovits alienated his Hungarian Romanian public, a fact noted by Ivan Sanders. \\"This curious collection\\", Sanders writes, \\"is indeed much closer in spirit and style to popular Yiddish literature than to Transylvanian Hungarian writing, and [Ern≈ë] Ligeti notes this, too, with a mixture of amusement and disdain.\\" Legacy In Communist Romania, Rodion Markovits' overall work was considered for translation and republication during the mid-1960s‚Äîa project of the state-run ESPLA Publishing House, with assistance from his former Timi»ôoaran colleagues Zolt√°n Frany√≥ and J√≥zsef M√©liusz. Markovits continued to be respected by the national communist authorities, even as the diplomatic contacts with Hungary began to worsen. Around 1968, the Romanian regime promoted Markovits, Jen≈ë Dsida, S√°ndor Makkai, Alad√°r Kuncz and some others as the canonical authors of Hungarian-Romanian literature, but, Hungarian observers wrote, it remained silent about the more unpalatable political stances these authors took.Andreescu et al., p.906, 908‚Äì909 In a 1981 review of Hungarian Romanian literature, published by the Romanian Communist Party's Era SocialistƒÉ, Kuncz and Markovits were introduced as authors of \\"anti-militarist novels [...] unmasking the cruelty of World War I\\".\\"Romanian Survey of Hungarian Minority Literature Reviewed\\", in the Foreign Broadcast Information Service East Europe Report, April 3, 1984, p.2 (digitized by the Defense Technical Information Center) A Romanian edition of Szib√©riai garnizon was eventually re-translated by Dan Culcer, and published with Bucharest's Editura Kriterion. After being researched and collected by writer J√°nos Szekerny√©s, Markovits' articles were grouped in the 1978 volume P√°holyb√≥l (\\"From the Booth\\").Andreescu et al., p.911 Markovits' work continued to be revered even after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 toppled communism. Editura Dacia republished Garnizoana din Siberia, and his work was included in a commemorative anthology of writers from Satu Mare County. \\"Colocviu pe tema literaturii sƒÉtmƒÉrene\\", in Gazeta de Nord-Vest, December 14, 2010 The writer's home in Gher≈£a MicƒÉ is preserved as the Rodion Markovits Memorial House.

Wrongfulness  Conduct will be wrongful in terms of this action if it is objectively unreasonable and without lawful justification: \\"Having a valid defence means that the conduct is justified and the behaviour is not wrongful or unlawful.\\"Loubser 26.  Fault  There must be fault in the form of intention, although this is controversial, as some in South Africa contend that the action has developed in the last century to include some instances, such as those involving deprivation of liberty, where liability is strict, and others such as defamation involving the media, where liability is negligence- based.Loubser 26.

M. Ryan (born 1945 in Wisconsin) is the author of Vaudeville in the Dark (2010), which was lauded by the New York Times as having been \\"written at the juncture of rapture and rupture.\\" He is also the author of two other volumes of poetry from Louisiana State University Press and two novels. R. M. Ryan‚Äôs most recent book is a collection of poems and a personal meditation on surviving cancer called The Lost Roads Adventure Club (2017). In 2015, Ryan published an autobiographical novel called There‚Äôs A Man With a Gun Over There based on his experiences in the US Army as a detective and translator investigating black marketing in Germany during the Vietnam era. In this novel, Ryan, trained as poet and drafted into the military, is a kind of innocent abroad as he learns the very high price of essentially becoming a fascist for the American Empire and the remnants of Nazi Germany. Nominated by its publisher for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, There‚Äôs a Man With a Gun Over There is about what could happen to anyone in the US Army, and a cautionary tale about America‚Äôs War Machine. Publisher Martin Shepard describes the author as \\"the Norman Mailer of this generation.\\" Poet, screenwriter, playwright, and winner of a ‚ÄúGenius‚Äù Award from the MacArthur Foundation, Naomi Wallace comments that in reading the novel she is astonished by \\"the battle of consciousness Ryan has with himself concerning right, wrong, war, lies: all are in continuous flux and deeply alive.\\" Carol Polsgrove, author of Divided Minds: Intellectuals and the Civil Rights Movement and Professor Emerita at The Indiana University School of Journalism, comments: \\"R.M. Ryan‚Äôs poems are not for the faint of heart. They saunter, they soar, they dive down to despair. Vaudeville in the Dark brings together poems written over the last thirty years ‚Äì since his publisher, Louisiana State University Press, brought out his first volume in 1980. That was right after he abandoned graduate school for stockbroking, which he has now abandoned for a writer‚Äôs life.\\" In an introduction of Ryan for a reading at Marquette University, professor and novelist C. J. Hribal said, \\"Rick ‚Äì R.M. ‚Äì Ryan has quietly been writing some of the best poems of the new century: elegiac comedies, hymns to memory and to the small, incidental moments of our pasts that connect us to who we are now . . . these poems are generous in their humor and their sadness, they are wise and wounded, they are intensely human and humane.\\" For six years, Ryan was the lyricist for the northern California rock-and-roll band The Thugz and wrote many of the songs on their two CD‚Äôs released by Puffin records‚ÄîGoin‚Äô To Town (2009) and Peace of Mind (2011). Ryan also founded firestarter press, which has published eccentric artifacts by writers including Abby Frucht, Mark Strand, Tobias Wolff, Fred Chappell, and John Koethe. Ryan received his undergraduate degree in English at Cornell College, where he studied with Robert Dana, and his master's in Poetry from the University of Arkansas; he continued graduate studies (ABD) at Washington University in St. Louis with Howard Nemerov and John N. Morris, and later had a career as a writer and financial advisor for a brokerage company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

This can result in interventions in the public space, sculptures or installations that undermine or underline this perception of the world. Biography From 1992 until 1997 Marc Bijl studied at the Royal Academy of Art & Design in 's-Hertogenbosch. In 1996 he studied for a year at Glasgow School of Art.http://artnews.org/marcbijl/?s=4 In his early work Marc Bijl reacted to global themes and to popular fascination with symbols of political power, globalization of the economy, religion and nationalism. This resulted in interventions in public space, videos, sculptures and installations that underscored or undermined world views. Bijl endeavours to expose superficialities and myths via his work. Bijl switches in his work between political activity and street culture as he does between the media of image, text and music. He exposes the superficialities, icons and myths of popular culture in his work to stimulate the spectator to contemplate about moral and ethical issues. The symbol, the logo and the label are his potential targets and his artistic tools. He likes to upset, relocate and re-connote their superficial image and their mythmaking ‚Äì always aiming at a critical analysis of the social conditions of the society. Bijl employs visual elements borrowed from punk and Gothic subcultures and from anarchism. His early works are representational, cartoon-like and often textual. His recent work is more abstract and minimalistic, exemplifying a shift in approach, by which he pares down different perspectives and methodologies to a new essence. The crux is no longer the 'symbolism' but what that symbolism represents and signifies. In these most recent works Bijl makes clear references to modernist art- historical icons such as Mark Rothko, Mondriaan, De Stijl (Rietveld chair) and more subtle references to Jannis Kounellis and Joseph Beuys. Bijl adapts these classical works to his own corporate style. He seeks a more abstract formal language that is in many respects more ambiguous than his earlier vocabulary. Bijl undermines systems but at the same time he is depended on these systems. Bijl's work is often rebellious and tends to the illegality. His work is clearly rooted in street culture and possesses elements of graffiti, performance and installation art.Paco Barrag√†n, Marc Bijl. In case you didn't feel like showing up, 2009 NAi Publishers, Rotterdam, blurb Works As said earlier the symbols and logos are often the Leitmotiv in Bijls work. In 2000 when the European Football Championship was hosted by the Netherlands and Belgium, Bijl set up a gallery/shop in Rotterdam selling orange color coated bricks endued with the Nike slogan Just do it for the \\"potentially violent hooligan\\" to bring the championship into discredit with the help of the official sponsor. The work La revoluzione siamo noi (2002) shows Bijls fascination with popular culture. The work is a lifelike sculpture of the famous icon Lara Croft. She is covered in tar, holding two pistols and smoking a cigarette. With this black dripping compound she had to give up her vivid youthfulness and sex appeal and turned into a scary mutant-like appearance. On the wall behind her is sprayed La revoluzione siamo noi (We are the revolution), the famous slogan which Joseph Beuys often used in his artworks. Like the Nike Logo, the heroine of the computer game Tomb Raider is a prominent icon in Bijl's work. Bijl's textual installations take an important place in his oeuvre. In these installations he sprays with graffiti short messages on places in the public space. In 2002 he sprayed RESIST on the entrance to the exhibition space Portikus in Frankfurt am Main. During Documenta 11 in September 2002 het sprayed te words TERROR on each of the six columns of the entrance to the Museum Fridericianum in Kassel. The very next morning all the letters were gone and the audience ‚Äì still shocked from September 11, 2001 ‚Äì could visit the exhibition without worrying. In January 2009 he sprayed the words MODERN CRISIS on the same entrance to the Fridericianum. Bijl also posted his name on the hoardings of prominent building sites, mimicking the corporate identity of the hoardings concerned, he was following the strategy of the corporate players who appropriate the realm. He surfed on their strategies and demanded his place within the economic and urban-planning establishment.Paco Barrag√†n, Marc Bijl. In case you didn't feel like showing up, 2009 NAi Publishers, Rotterdam, 6-7 In 2002 Bijl made a fake edition of the art magazine Flash Art. With this he reacted on the art system using that systems own rules. In bookshops his artist's book was hardly distinguishable from an actual edition of Flash Art. In recent works Bijl refers to Rietveld's famous zigzag chair, but unlike Rietveld's colored chair Bijl makes the chair unattractive, covering it with a thick layer of tar. He also relates to the geometrical language of shapes of Piet Mondrian. When abstraction was supposed to lead Mondrian to the \\"nature of all things\\", Bijl rather sees the actual social wish for structure and orderliness in it.

It was written by Robert Padnick and directed by Jeffrey Blitz. The episode aired on NBC in the United States on November 17, 2011. \\"Gettysburg\\" guest stars Lindsey Broad as Cathy Simms. The series‚Äîpresented as if it were a real documentary‚Äîdepicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) takes some of the office staff on a field trip to Gettysburg for inspiration. Meanwhile, the rest of the office, under orders from Robert California (James Spader), are tasked with coming up with a new business idea for Dunder Mifflin. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) proposes several vending machine ideas that capture California's imagination. \\"Gettysburg\\" is the last episode to feature Jenna Fischer before her maternity leave. The episode received mixed reviews, with commentators mainly criticizing the episode for recycling jokes. According to the Nielsen Media Research, \\"Gettysburg\\" drew 5.50 million viewers, and ranked first in its time slot and was the highest-rated NBC show of the night. Synopsis Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) thinks that a field trip to Gettysburg would boost office morale. At Gettysburg, Andy is unhappy with the lack of morale and belief in his leadership and attempts to make an analogy between running a paper company and fighting in the Civil War. Andy starts to lead a haphazard tour, and eventually most of the office members sit down to rest. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) follow Andy after he presses on, and eventually tell him to stop trying to impress the office. They explain that no one is responding to his analogies because they are not true, and reinforce the fact that his co-workers like him the way he is. During the tour, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) argues with Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) about what he claims is the northernmost battle of the Civil War: the Battle of Schrute Farms. Dwight maintains that its absence from the history books is an example of re-writing history, whereas Oscar maintains that the battle is a fictitious creation. Oscar is further annoyed when Dwight attempts to convince Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) that the Battle of Schrute Farms is real. After tracking down a historian, Dwight and Oscar learn that the Battle of Schrute Farms did in fact take place. However, the \\"battle\\" was really a code term. During the Civil War, Schrute Farms was a safe haven for artists and poets (and, as heavily implied, homosexuals). Oscar finds this fascinating, whereas Dwight leaves in disgust. Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) is sidetracked by another tour group who assume that he is an Abraham Lincoln impersonator. He acquiesces and delivers an improvised but applauded performance. At the office, half of the employees opts to stay behind. Robert California (James Spader) makes a spontaneous visit and asks them to come up with Dunder Mifflin/Sabre's next big idea. However, the office fails to impress Robert with their ideas. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) details an idea he has about cookie placement in the vending machine, but Robert gets the impression that he is extremely clever and is speaking only in metaphors. The employees try to offer analogies to Kevin's words, but Robert gives credit to Kevin. Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who has been annoyed the entire day with Kevin being creative and Robert rejecting his ideas, later tricks Kevin into explaining an idea he has involving the Big Mac, and Robert realizes that there was no subtext to Kevin's ideas. Production \\"Gettysburg\\" is Jenna Fischer's last episode before her maternity leave. The episode was written by story editor Robert Padnick, his second writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff the previous season. It was directed by frequent director of The Office, Jeffrey Blitz. The episode also marks the second appearance of Lindsey Broad, who plays Cathy, Pam's replacement during her maternity leave. She appeared in a recurring role for the season. Due to Jenna Fischer's actual pregnancy, \\"Gettysburg\\" is the last episode of 2011 to feature Pam. The episode was not filmed on location in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt noted that the writers' used Andy's \\"overeager qualities\\" to have the office group skip the official tour, allowing for \\"some random California heritage site\\" to stand in for the real Gettysburg. The Season Eight DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Andy preparing the office to go to Gettysburg, and Kevin discussing his newfound approval by California. Novak later said that \\"He thinks Kevin is a genius who speaks in metaphors. Everyone's jealous that Kevin's become his favorite.\\" Reception =Ratings= In its original American broadcast on NBC on November 17, 2011, \\"Gettysburg\\" was viewed by an estimated 5.50 million viewers and received a 2.9 rating/7 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49. This means that it was seen by 2.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 7 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. The episode marked a three percent decrease in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Pam's Replacement\\". Despite this, the episode ranked first in its timeslot, beating the Fox drama series, Bones which received a 2.7 rating/7 percent share, CBS drama, Person of Interest which received a 2.6 rating/7 percent share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, and the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) medical drama, Private Practice which received a 2.6 rating/7 percent share, although all three shows received more total viewers than \\"Gettysburg\\". =Reviews= \\"Gettysburg\\" received mixed reviews from critics, ranging from negative to slightly positive. Hollywood writer Hannah Lawrence was heavily critical of the episode and wrote, \\"This episode seemed like a joke to me.

He concluded that although \\"The Office is still capable of finding humor in ... situations [but] it doesn't feel like the show is willing to explore that humor, instead content on making the same statements the show has been making for quite some time.\\" He ultimately gave it a \\"C‚Äì\\". Not all reviews were negative. IGN writer Cindy White awarded the episode 7 out of 10, signifying a \\"good\\" episode. However, she heavily criticized the recycling of story lines, writing, \\"It may have been heartwarming in the premiere, but now it feels repetitive, and it's still not funny.\\" M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\". Chris Plante from New York wrote a generally positively review, saying \\"No episode has done the ensemble work better than 'Gettysburg', a kind of sitcom buffet, its many stories giving the audience a small taste of every personality. That isn't to say every character has been fleshed out well. ... Andy and California seem off point.\\" The episode's opening, featuring Pam Halpert (Fischer) faking her water breaking, received mixed reviews. White called the sequence her \\"favorite part\\" and felt an empathetic connection to the character. Kratzer claimed that he enjoyed the scene. McNutt, however, wrote that the opening concludes that \\"Pam and Jim are basically total jerks\\".

Thanks to technical consulting from Astronaut Mike Massimino, who also plays himself on the show, the production crew was able to put together sets that realistically depict the Soyuz capsule and the ISS. A small portion of a chamber that is a model of the ISS was rented and used as the set for the ISS. \\"Unique camera angles and creative framing\\" were used to make the set look larger. To simulate weightlessness, the production crew decided to use \\"long skinny platforms\\" to support the actors from below, rather than use tethers to suspend from above.

Jesse Schedeen of IGN criticized the storylines, writing that \\"The entire episode was pretty much predicated on two jokes ...

Capital Good Fund offers loans for car purchase/refinance, immigration costs (including fees relating to US citizenship), weatherization, security deposits, and other consumer purposes. History The organization was founded in 2009 by Brown University students Andy Posner and Mollie West. It was a student run organization until 2010 when Posner became the first full-time employee. According to the Brown Daily Herald, the startup had dispersed more than $100,000 in 70 loans to Providence entrepreneurs by January, 2011. By the middle of May, 2011, the Capital Good Fund, which began as a college class project, had awarded its 100th loan. In 2011, the Bank of Rhode Island has announced that it is awarding a $2,000 grant to the Capital Good Fund to \\"support financial coaching for low-income Providence residents\\". In fall of 2016 Capital Good Fund expanded its services online to Delaware and Florida, hiring their first full-time employee in Miami during early 2017. As of 2017, Capital Good Fund is an officially recognized Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) located at 22 A Street in Providence, RI. As of 2017, Good Fund has dispersed just over $2,000,000 in 1,560 loans and graduated over 1,000 families of their Financial Health & Coaching Program. Capital Good Fund is one of the few CDFIs nationally‚Äîand the only in Rhode Island‚Äîthat specializes in small-dollar personal loans. Their primary competitors are companies such as payday lenders, pawnshops, auto title lenders, rent-to-own stores, and loan sharks. Products =Financial Coaching= Capital Good Fund's Financial Health & Coaching program (FC Plus)'s resources are freely available to anyone via their online client portal. For Rhode Island residents, Good Fund offers in-person financial coaching. FC Plus is designed to provide low-income individuals with access to reliable financial and health information and opportunities for skill building. FC Plus consists of four ninety-minute sessions and two check-ins conducted over the course of a year by a highly trained Financial Coaching Fellow. Each Fellow undergoes 25 hours of training before shadowing sessions with an experienced Fellow. This preparation eventually leads to coaches hosting sessions by themselves. Sessions cover topics such as banking, credit, debt, savings, budgeting, and health needs. The cost of coaching is $15 per month for a year, or the duration of the program. These payments are then reported to the credit bureau TransUnion, building the credit of financial coaching clients. After completing the financial coaching program, clients often go on to take a business or consumer loan to continue on their pathway out of poverty.http://www.capitalgoodfund.org/ourservices/financialcoaching = Loans = As a Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI), Capital Good Fund provides loans to low and moderate income households. The amount and terms vary by state and product. Loan purposes include: * \\"Emergency Loan\\" - For financial emergencies such as debt repayment, bill catch-up, utilities, unforeseen expenses, etc. * \\"Residency Loan\\" - For the security deposit on a new and safer apartment, past-due rent or utilities, moving expenses, etc. * \\"Immigration Loan\\" - For paying fees for acquiring U.S. citizenship, securing or renewing a Green Card, applying for family members to come to the U.S. and other immigration steps. * \\"Other Personal Loans\\" - For any other personal purchase or expense such as security deposits, car repairs, computer purchase, etc. * \\"Car Purchase and Refinance Loan\\" - Refinance or purchase of a new or used car. * \\"DoubleGreen Loan\\" - For covering the cost of energy-efficient upgrades in moderate-income homes in partnership with National Grid. All of Capital Good Fund's loan products are credit-building, with each on-time payment reported to the three major credit bureaus. FC Plus Schools In 2013 Capital Good Fund started their Randomized Control Trial (RCT) called FC Plus Schools that measures the impact of the FC Plus coaching on low-income families of children ages pre-kindergarten to 5th grade in the Providence Public School District. The theory of change is that as families reduce financial stress, put healthy food on the table, and manage health issues that present a financial burden, they will create a home environment that prepares children to excel academically. Over time, this can serve to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. FC Plus Schools tracks financial, educational, and health-related outcomes for two groups of families: a treatment group that attends four FC Plus sessions and participates in check-ins over the course of a year, and a control group that receives no intervention and is merely tracked. Participants are randomly assigned to one group or the other. Both treatment and control groups complete a standardized 38-question survey at intake and at six, twelve, and twenty-four months after intake. Comparative analysis of treatment and control groups in September 2016 showed strong outcomes within the treatment group. Treatment participants applied lessons learned from our Coaching to consistently increase their interaction with financial and healthcare services. As a result, increases in income, credit score, savings, and food security among the treatment group have been observed. As of February 2017, 132 treatment group families and 114 control group families either have sessions in progress or have completed the study in full. The final goal is to enroll 180 families in the treatment group and 150 in the control group by fall 2017. Capital Good Fund is set to complete the service delivery portion of the study by fall 2017, and have all check-ins completed by early 2019. Supporters Capital Good Fund has received national recognition from CNN, National Public Radio. the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and the Aspen Institute. In 2013 Good Fund became a member of the Opportunity Finance Network. In 2011 the Hitachi Foundation recognized the work of founder, Andy Posner, by awarding him with a prestigious Young Entrepreneur award. BankRI also awarded Good Fund a grant in 2010. Posner also was selected in 2013 as an American Express Emerging Innovator and as a Rhode Island Foundation Fellow in 2015.

He has been part of the Penn State administration since 1995, when he was promoted to dean of the graduate school; in 1997 he was named vice president for research.

However, on November 17, 2011, the Board of Trustees removed the \\"interim\\" tag from Erickson's title and formally named him as Penn State's president. It is very unusual for American universities, especially major research universities like Penn State, to promote someone to the presidency from within. However, several trustees felt that given the gravity of the sex abuse scandal, Erickson would provide a measure of stability. Additionally, University of Virginia economist David Breneman believed it unlikely \\"anybody worth getting\\" would even consider the post if Penn State mounted a national search. Terry Hartles of the American Council of Education believed that the move was necessary as the institution needed \\"stable, effective leadership\\" and not a year-long search for a successor.

An Australian international and New South Wales interstate representative forward, he played club football in Sydney for Balmain, winning the 1946 NSWRFL Premiership with them and later being appointed their captain. Background De Belin's father Ernest Hector Fred de Belin (1896-1971) lived in Glebe, Sydney when he enlisted in 1916 then three months shy of his twentieth birthday, as reserve for the 1st Battalion AIF. Ernest de Belin embarkation He served on the Western Front as a machine gunner and saw action at Bullecourt and Ypres. He was wounded three times but returned to the front line. Ernest de Belin returned to Australia in July 1919 well after hostilities ended.

Pre-war playing career Fred de Belin started playing junior rugby league for the Balmain Police boys club, reaching first grade with the Balmain DRLFC of the NSWRFL premiership in the 1942 season. Before the war he won the New South Wales amateur wrestling championship. War service De Belin joined the Royal Australian Air Force as part of the Empire Air Training Scheme. He spent some months in the summer and autumn of 1942-43 training on the airfields of Temora and Cootamundra. At Temora he was to be a pilot but transferred to the Air Observers School at Cootamundra to train as a navigator. He received further training in Canada ‚Äì changing course to the specialized role of ‚Äòbomb aimer‚Äò. He was then transferred to England and into action. He flew the maximum number of 30 bombing missions over Germany, in a Lancaster named \\"H of Harry\\", rising to the rank of Flying Officer.de Belin Profile at Maher Cup His sorties targeted enemy munitions factories and other sites of military importance. War hero who couldn't be baited During his service period he secured the combined Australian services light heavyweight boxing title. He also won representative selection in the British Empire force's rugby union side and played at the war's end played in England, Wales and France. Post war playing career De Belin resumed his playing career with Balmain in 1946. That season he played in the Tigers' victory over St. George in the final. The following year Balmain again won the premiership but de Belin did not play in the final. In 1948 de Belin made his d√©but for New South Wales and then won his first Australian jersey, becoming Kangaroo No. 238 in the second Test against New Zealand, helping Australia to a narrow victory that levelled the series. In the 1948 post season, De Belin was selected as a member of the first Kangaroo side to tour Great Britain and France after World War II. After breaking his leg in the first match of the tour, he recovered to make three Test appearances. He then won selection for the 1949 tour of New Zealand. The eighth and last of de Belin's Test appearances came against Great Britain in 1950, when Australia reclaimed The Ashes on home soil for the first time in thirty years. The 1950 NSWRFL season would be de Belin's last with Balmain. During the 1951 premiership's pre- season, after playing trial matches for Balmain, de Belin newly married to wife Joan, announced that he was taking up a two-year contract worth ¬£450 as captain-coach with the Cootamundra club in the Maher Cup competition. Injury and poor form in Cootamundra led to de Belin's drop to reserve grade in that first year in the country. He and Joan stayed in town, Fred coached the reserve grade side and the Bethungra village team, became manager of the Cootamundra Baths, led a team of basketballers to the finals and became the town‚Äôs table tennis champion.

Following his death, de Belin was awarded life membership of the Balmain District Football Club. He was also inducted into the Balmain Tigers' Hall of Fame. In 2011 de Belin's grandson Jack started his Australian professional rugby league career with the St George Illawarra Dragons under-20s team. By 2018 Jack had played 150 National Rugby League first grade games and that year made state selection for New South Wales in the State of Origin series.

The operation began at 04:00 KST on 25 June 1950 along the 38th parallel north without a declaration of war. The operation was planned by the DPRK and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) with the USSR supplying weapons such as tanks and aircraft to its ally. The DPRK was able to take control of the southern capital Seoul within a few days. The original goal for the operation was to occupy the entire Korean Peninsula by 15 August 1950 ‚Äï 50 days, with an average 10 km advance each day ‚Äï in commemoration of the 5th anniversary of the Gwangbokjeol. However, heavy losses incurred by the DPRK II Corps, which was in charge of the eastern front, at the hands of the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA) 6th Infantry Division, enabled the ROK to delay the DPRK advance. The United States joined the war on 27 June and the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 84 on 7 July. Background Joseph Stalin‚Äôs influence over Kim Il-Sung dictated the timing of the invasion. Kim Il-Sung and ROK leader Syngman Rhee both wanted to reunify Korea. Kim's objective was to achieve reunification through force. Kim was not able to achieve his goal without Stalin‚Äôs assistance. On 30 January 1950, Stalin contacted Ambassador Terenty Shtykov and explained he was ready to help organize an invasion plan. Stalin noted that in order to capture South Korea, Kim Il-Sung would need to be prepared to minimise the risk of a lengthy battle. In the lead up to April 1950, Kim requested to launch an invasion on repeated occasions but Stalin did not allow Kim to launch the invasion until favorable tactical conditions in the Far East emerged. Since March 1950, the Korean People's Army (KPA) started to build up its armament, and redeployed its troops to get ready to attack South Korea. On 16 May officers of the DPRK and USSR began final inspections for the war. Kim Il-sung met Stalin in Moscow in April 1950 to formulate the invasion plan. Stalin permitted the plan on the condition that the Chinese allies were also in agreement. On 13 May 1950, Kim Il-Sung went to Beijing to meet Mao Zedong. On 14 May 1950, Mao reviewed Stalin‚Äôs telegram and approved the North Korean invasion. Stalin had dispatched Lieutenant General Vasiliev, to prepare the invasion plan before the Stalin-Kim meeting was held in Moscow in April 1950. On 29 May 1950, Vasiliev and General Kang Kon, the Chief of the General Staff of the KPA, finalised the invasion plan. On 10 June the DPRK Ministry of People's Defense secretly summoned all division and brigade commanders to Pyongyang for a meeting. Kang Kon, ordered troops to be fully ready for an offensive operation in disguise of defensive operation by 23 June. On 11 June the KPA was reorganized into two corps and the divisions that were placed at the rear started to move as close as 10 to 15 km of north to the 38th Parallel. Advanced forces from the KPA 2nd Division moved to Kumhwa on the same day. The entire division was placed in Kumhwa by 14 June 1950. By 23 June 1950, all KPA forces involved in the invasion were positioned around the 38th Parallel. On 18 June the Ministry of People's Defense sent Reconnaissance Order Number 1 (Ï†ïÏ∞∞Î™ÖÎ†π Ï†ú1Ìò∏) to division commanders to gather information about locations of the ROKA forces and terrain. On 22 June after completion of reconnaissance and reorganization and approval from Stalin, Soviet military advisors ordered the Ministry of People's Defense to send Engagement Order Number 1 (Ï†ÑÌà¨Î™ÖÎ†π Ï†ú1Ìò∏) to its divisions. In the meantime, Kim Il-sung informed Stalin that the war would be started on 25 June and Stalin consented to the plan. As scheduled, the KPA began the operation and crossed the 38th Parallel at 04:00 KST on 25 June 1950. When the war began, Kim Il- sung held a governmental emergency meeting and stated the following to the members of the Workers' Party of Korea who did not realize the situation:  Order of battle  Almost the entire forces from both sides were involved in the operation either directly or indirectly. The order is at the beginning stage of the operation, and only the major combatants are listed below. = Democratic People's Republic of Korea =  Army  * I Corps ** 1st Infantry Division *** 1st Infantry Regiment *** 2nd Infantry Regiment *** 3rd Infantry Regiment ** 3rd Infantry Division *** 7th Infantry Regiment *** 8th Infantry Regiment *** 9th Infantry Regiment ** 4th Infantry Division *** 5th Infantry Regiment *** 16th Infantry Regiment *** 18th Infantry Regiment ** 6th Infantry Division *** 13th Infantry Regiment *** 14th Infantry Regiment *** 15th Infantry Regiment * II Corps ** 2nd Infantry Division ** 5th Infantry Division *** 10th Infantry Regiment *** 11th Infantry Regiment *** 12th Infantry Regiment ** 7th Infantry Division ** 8th Infantry Division *** 81st Infantry Regiment *** 82nd Infantry Regiment *** 83rd Infantry Regiment ** 15th Infantry Division *** 48th Infantry Regiment *** 49th Infantry Regiment *** 50th Infantry Regiment * 9th Infantry Division * 10th Infantry Division * 13th Infantry Division * 105th Armored Brigade ** 107th Armored Regiment ** 109th Armored Regiment ** 203rd Armored Regiment ** 206th Mechanized Regiment * 549th Infantry Regiment * 766th Infantry Regiment  38th Parallel Guard  * 1st Guard Brigade * 3rd Guard Brigade = Republic of Korea =  Army  * Capital Division ** 3rd Infantry Regiment ** 18th Infantry Regiment * 1st Infantry Division ** 11th Infantry Regiment ** 12th Infantry Regiment ** 13th Infantry Regiment * 2nd Infantry Division ** 5th Infantry Regiment ** 16th Infantry Regiment ** 25th Infantry Regiment * 3rd Infantry Division ** 18th Infantry Regiment ** 22nd Infantry Regiment ** 23rd Infantry Regiment * 5th Infantry Division ** 15th Infantry Regiment ** 20th Infantry Regiment * 6th Infantry Division ** 2nd Infantry Regiment ** 7th Infantry Regiment ** 19th Infantry Regiment * 7th Infantry Division ** 1st Infantry Regiment ** 9th Infantry Regiment * 8th Infantry Division ** 10th Infantry Regiment ** 21st Infantry Regiment * 17th Infantry Regiment  Controversy over origins of battle  There have been conflicting accounts regarding the opening phases of the battle from sources on both sides. This resulted in discrepancies about which army initiated military action on 25 June 1950. A report on behalf of UNCOK was submitted on 24 June 1950 by two Australian military observers, Major F. S. B. Peach and Squadron Leader R. J. Rankin. The report made claim that ROK forces were organised entirely for defence and were in no condition to carry out an attack on a large scale against the forces of the north. The inadequate resources of the ROKA, in particular the absence of armor, air support and heavy artillery, rendered a South Korean invasion of the North militarily impossible. At 17:00 on 25 June the field observers had reported that North Korean forces had that morning mounted a surprise attack all along the 38th Parallel. However, Kim Il Sung had claimed in a broadcast made on 26 June at 09:20 that South Korea had attacked the north in the section of Haeju, provoking counterattacks. In the light of the report by Peach and Rankin, UNCOK unanimously rejected the North Korean contention. There remains undisclosed information from the Soviet and North Korean side. Battle On 24 June 1950, the North Korean forces were ordered in their starting positions by 24:00. On 25 June Washington received a report at 10:00 detailing that North Korean forces has invaded the south across several locations that morning. The report claimed combat was initiated at 04:40 when Ongjin was hit by North Korean artillery fire. Individual KPA units advanced 3 to 5 kilometres into South Korean territory within the first three hours. The ROKA put up a strong resistance in the direction of Ongjin, Kaizin and Seoul. Osin, Kaesong and Sinyuri were captured on the first day. KPA forces advanced 12 kilometres in the Sunsen direction and 8 kilometres along the eastern coast. Two amphibious landings occurred on the coast south of Kangnung at 05:25. One landing occurred in the Korio region and consisted of two battalions of naval infantry and 1,000 partisans. The other landing occurred in the Urutsyn area and consisted of 600 partisans. The city of Urutsyn was captured. The South Korean military engaged the North Korean warships but the landings were successful. The KPA invasion was spearheaded by Soviet manufactured T-34 medium, diesel-fuelled tanks that could operate at up to thirty kilometres an hour. The T-34 was equipped with high-velocity 85 mm guns and was lined with medium armour. The armor proved nearly impregnable to the ill-equipped ROKA which lacked tanks and antitank guns capable of penetrating the T-34's armor. The T-34 weighed 29 tons, making it light enough to withstand limits on Korean railroads due to bridge capacities being thirty tons. Air support was provided 150 Soviet manufactured Yakovlev Yak-9 fighters, Ilyushin Il-10 attack bombers and Yakovlev Yak-11 trainer aircraft. The aircraft utilised blitzkrieg warfare strategy and bombarded Seoul and strategic locations. The battle continued on 26 June with further advances by KPA forces into South Korea.The Kaisan and Ongjin peninsula were cleared. The 1st and 4th Divisions captured Tongducheb and Bunsan. The 2nd Division took Siunseen. The 6th Division crossed the bay and captured the point in the direction of Kimpo Airfield. The forces from the amphibious landings advanced and had taken the port of Tubuiri. The main force advanced through the Uijeongbu corridor towards Seoul. The South Korean forces did not have enough aircraft or tanks to counter the invasion. A significant portion of the South Korean forces, numbering 65,000 combat troops and 33,000 support troops, began deserting. On 28 June ROK forces demolished the Hangang Bridge in an attempt to slow the KPA invasion. The demolition resulted in South Korean refugee casualties and stranded the ROKA 5th Division. KPA forces were able to cross the river later that day and occupy Seoul. North Korean command during battle A Soviet report made during the invasion highlighted the inadequacies in KPA operations. Communication within the KPA was inefficient. The general staff did not direct battle, since from the beginning of the forward advance staff communication was weak. The unit commanders did not receive commands from senior staff. The report stated that the KPA command did not have battle experience. Once Soviet military advisers withdrew the battle was poorly commanded. The directed use of tanks and artillery in battle was tactically unsound. However, the KPA soldiers were enthusiastic and dedicated to completing their role. The people of North Korea also responded positively to the news of the invasion. They had a strong belief in the North Korean government and the KPA.  Propaganda In the United States, the invasion was reported in mainstream media as an act of aggression by North Korea. The event also became an additional source of political division during the Cold War period. An article from The New York Times (27 June 1950) headlined U.S. Blames Russia describes the event as an ‚Äúact of aggression‚Äù, ‚Äúlawless‚Äù and \\"an invasion of the American-sponsored republic as another threat by Russia into a soft spot of the free countries.‚Äù It also claimed ‚Äúthe [US] Administration held Soviet Union responsible as the motivating power behind the North Korean government.‚Äù The official North Korean history of the Korean War describes the battle under the title ‚ÄòOutstanding and Brilliant Victory‚Äô, and claims that the battle was an anti-imperialist defence measure against the ‚Äúenemies of the people‚Äù [US]. The United States imperialists had successfully overtaken South Korean. The United States prompted the South Korean forces to launch a surprise armed invasion of the DPRK at dawn on 25 June 1950. Over 100,000 South Korean soldiers attacked, penetrating two kilometres into Northern Korea territory. The aim was to conquer the [North] Korean people. The report refers to the South Korean troops as ‚Äúpuppets‚Äù of the ‚Äúaggressive, imperialist‚Äù United States and that the ‚Äúcountry and people were faced with a grave danger.‚Äù Aftermath On 30 June President of the United States Harry S. Truman released a statement that indicated the invasion of South Korea had grown the threat of Communism to the Pacific area and the United States. In response to the invasion, Truman ordered United States provide assistance with air and land forces in Korea. Moreover, Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Formosa and strengthened the United States forces in the Philippines. As a result of North Korea‚Äôs invasion, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 84. The Resolution authorised the use of the UN flag in operations against North Korean forces and those nations partaking. The UNSC provided a recommendation to members to provide assistance to the Republic of Korea in repelling the North Korean attack and restoring worldwide peace and security.

Military service in World War II In 1939 Ciclitira enlisted into the Territorial Army, serving in the 2/4th Essex Regiment, before graduating from an Officer Cadet Training Unit and being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the South Staffordshire Regiment on 20 April 1940. After two years with the South Staffordshire Regiment, Ciclitira volunteered to serve with the Special Operations Executive, and in October 1942 was assigned to \\"Force 133\\", SOE's Cretan section, based in Cairo. He was responsible for organising clandestine deliveries of arms and supplies to the Cretan resistance, and also the exfiltration of those for whom it had become too dangerous to remain. In December 1943 Ciclitira took over from Xan Fielding as commander of SOE activities in western Crete, operating from a mountain hideout near Canea. In May 1944, after the abduction of General Kreipe, Ciclitira organized the evacuation of Patrick Leigh Fermor, W. Stanley Moss, and their captive by Motor Launch, and met them at a remote beach on the southern coast. Just as Leigh Fermor and Moss realised that neither knew enough Morse to make the correct recognition code Ciclitira arrived, having been ordered to return to Cairo, took the torch, called them \\"bloody fools\\", and made the correct signal. Ciclitira returned to Crete in September 1944, remaining there until the end of the war. In March 1945, he negotiated a prisoner exchange, swapping 36 German prisoners for 12 Cretans, including Konstantinos Mitsotakis, later the Prime Minister of Greece. On 8 May 1945, V-E day, Ciclitira arranged for Generalmajor Hans-Georg Benthack to formally surrender all German forces on the island to Major-General Colin Callander. Post-war career On 23 May 1946, Ciclitira received a mention in despatches \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in the Mediterranean Theatre\\". His father having died in 1943, Ciclitira and his brother John revived the family business in the late 1950s, forming Demos Ciclitira Ltd. The company remains one of the UK's leading importers of dried fruit, as well as other products, and is run by Ciclitira's nephew Andrew. Dennis Ciclitira died on 9 June 2000.

J. Ourso College of Business of Louisiana State University, located on the university's main campus in Baton Rouge, LA. The department currently consists of 30 faculty members, including five chairs and several professorships. Some of its features include the Securities Market Analysis Research and Trading (SMART) Lab and the Real Estate Research Institute. The department is both a CFP Board-Registered Program and a CFA Program Partner offering curricula for undergraduate and graduate students interested in careers in corporate finance, asset management, real estate, insurance, banking, financial planning and business law through B.S, M.S., and Ph. D programs.  History  The Department of Finance is one of seven degree-granting units in the E. J. Ourso College of Business. The roots of the department and college go back to 1899 when LSU created a four-year curriculum in commerce within the College of Arts and Sciences. By 1928, roughly coincident with the university's move to its present campus, a separate College of Commerce was established, in which the Department of Economics and Business Administration provided instruction in finance. Graduate education became part of the department's mission in the mid-1930s, with the Master of Business Administration (1935), the Master of Science (1936), and a doctoral program (1938). \\"Insurance and Real Estate\\" was the first finance-specific undergraduate curriculum to appear in the university catalog, in 1945. In 1959, the college was reorganized and renamed the College of Business Administration, with a separate Department of Finance, consisting of eight faculty members, and a curriculum in Finance. Business law was included within the department, possibly because of the financial aspects of property law, securities law, and contract law. Reflecting the trend toward quantitative analysis as a part of the research and practice of finance; between 1963 and 1971, the department provided instruction in statistics, and was titled the Department of Business Finance and Statistics. In 1965, the first privately supported, named chair on campus, the Louisiana Bankers Association Chair of Banking, was established in the department. In 1971, the college again reorganized, separating the department into a Department of Quantitative Methods and a Department of Finance. Business law faculty remained within the Department of Finance. In 1978, the college moved from Himes Hall to Patrick F. Taylor Hall (Formerly known as the Center for Engineering and Business Administration, or CEBA). In 1981, the Louisiana Real Estate Commission Chair in Real Estate, the first fully endowed chair on the LSU campus, was established. The mid-1980s also saw the establishment of the Real Estate Research Institute within the department. In 2002, the Department opened the SMART Lab, a 50-station simulated interactive trading floor and research facility. In 2005, the LSU Foundation established the Student Managed Investment Fund, an investment portfolio funded by the LSU Foundation and managed by a select group of students each semester. The contributions of alumni and other benefactors over the years has resulted in the endowment of five chairs and several professorships for the department. In 1996, the college was renamed the E. J. Ourso College of Business Administration in honor of its major benefactor. In 2005, the name was officially shortened to the E. J. Ourso College of Business. The college also recently unveiled its state-of-the-art Business Education Complex, designed to provide business students with a \\"campus within a campus.\\"  Program partnerships  = CFA partnership = In 2009 the E. J. Ourso College of Business was named a CFA Program Partner by the CFA Institute, a global association for investment professionals that awards the Chartered Financial Analyst designation. Recognition as a CFA Program Partner provides a signal to potential students, current students, and the marketplace that the E. J. Ourso College's curriculum is closely tied to professional practice and is well suited to preparing students to sit for the CFA exams. The official partnership signing for LSU was held in the Securities Markets Analysis Research and Trading (SMART) Lab on April 21, 2009 with CFA Institute University Relations Head Bob McLean, CFA representing the organization. Representing LSU were E. J. Ourso College Dean Eli Jones and Gary Sanger, distinguished chair in finance and director of the SMART Lab. = Registered CFP Program = Department of Finance has registered with the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards Inc. to provide a new financial planning undergraduate specialization (Fall 2011). Students who complete the financial planning pathway at LSU will be eligible to sit for the national CFP¬Æ Certification Examination administered by CFP Board to become Certified Financial Planner‚Ñ¢ professionals. Chad Olivier, CFP¬Æ, president of the Baton Rouge Financial Planning Association, has vocally voiced his support of the program. LSU Finance also offers a new option for MS Finance CFP concentration, where MS Finance students can specialize in financial planning.  Institutes and labs  = Securities Market Analysis Research and Trading (SMART) Lab = Funded by LSU's Center for Computation & Technology (CCT), the E. J. Ourso College of Business's Securities Markets Analysis Research and Trading Lab, or SMART Lab, recreates a simulated interactive trading floor where students gain experience in securities analysis, research and trading. The lab's 50 networked workstations are equipped with professional analytic software, which gives students significant on-the-job-style training in portfolio construction, risk management, and financial engineering. In addition, the SMART Lab provides faculty and graduate students access to professional tools for research in experimental economics and price discovery theory. The SMART Lab is home to no less than Twelve Bloomberg Terminals. The current lab Director is Dr. Gary Sanger, former Department Chair, and active CFA Institute member. Dr. Sanger is most noted for his contributions to the CFA Exams by volunteering to write questions grade exams. In 2010 he was awarded the C. Steward Sheppard Award by the CFA Institute. = Student Managed Investment Fund (SMIF) = Each semester the SMART Lab serves as both a classroom and teaching aide for the students managing the LSU Student Managed Investment Fund (SMIF), or the Tiger Fund. The Tiger Fund was founded in the spring of 2005 by a grant from the LSU foundation. The primary investment objective of the Tiger Fund is to achieve long-term capital growth by investing in marketable U.S. equities and exceed the total return of the Fund's benchmark index. The Fund previously used the Standard & Poor's 100 Index as a benchmark, but now uses the Russell Indexes, specifically 200 Index. = Real Estate Research Institute = The Real Estate Research Institute was formed to encourage, support, and conduct research in real estate. The Louisiana Real Estate Research Institute was established in 1985 with funding from the E. J. Ourso College of Business and the Louisiana Real Estate Commission. Continued funding for the institute has been provided various private sources along with grants. Institute faculty are subsidized by the Louisiana Real Estate Commission Endowed Chair of Real Estate, the Latter and Blum Professorship of Business Administration, and the C. J. Brown Professorship of Real Estate. In terms of professional outreach, the RERI, along with the Baton Rouge Association of Realtors, hold the annual Trends in Baton Rouge Real Estate which typically attract between 300-500 attendees.  Student organizations  = Tigers on the Street = Founded by LSU finance alum Ryan Roberge, Tigers on the Street is a network of undergraduate and graduate finance majors. = Student Finance Association = The Student Finance Association (SFA) is an informative support group for finance students and faculty. Activities are designed to encourage students to socialize with fellow students, faculty members, and economists in the business community. The society also offers assistance with job searches and graduate school information. = Student Real Estate Association = = Masters Student Finance Association = The Masters Student Finance Association (MFSA) is a registered student organization concentrated on educating Finance majors by bringing in professional speakers, internship/career opportunities, and participating in outside activities such as the investment club, the annual trip to New York City, community service around Baton Rouge and more. Degree programs =Master of Science Program= =PhD Program= The PhD program in Business Administration with a major in Finance is an intensive course of study in the theory and empirics of Finance. Coursework has been designed to introduce the student to all basic areas of Finance, but the responsibility for mastering the material, of course, lies with the student. To be successful in this program, the student must be committed to the highest level of academic achievement. Forums The LSU Finance Stakeholder's Forum provides involvement and internship opportunities for LSU Finance students.

Early life Prince Leopold was born on 18 July 1855 in Dessau as the first child of Hereditary Prince Frederick of Anhalt-Dessau-K√∂then and his wife Princess Antoinette of Saxe-Altenburg. He was named after his grandfather Duke Leopold of Anhalt-Dessau-K√∂then. In 1863 his grandfather, Duke Leopold, became Duke of the united Duchy of Anhalt following the death of the last Duke of Anhalt-Bernburg. On 22 May 1871, Duke Leopold died and Prince Leopold's father succeeded to the Duchy of Anhalt. Leopold himself now became hereditary prince. Marriage and issue In the autumn of 1883, Hereditary Prince Leopold proposed to Princess Viktoria of Prussia, daughter of Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia and Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom. But his proposal was refused. In April 1884 Friedrich von Holstein recorded that:Kevin R. Brady To Marry for Marrying‚Äôs Sake In the end of December 1883 Hereditary Prince Leopold was engaged to Princess Elisabeth of Hesse-Kassel, the eldest daughter of Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Anna of Prussia.

(1741-1810) was a Presbyterian minister and one of the co-founders of Tusculum College, originally called Greeneville College. Early life and education He was born in 1741 in Harford County, Maryland along Deer Creek. There is very little information about Balch's early life. His parents are Col. James Balch (1714 - 1779) and Anne Goodwin (1719 - 1760). Family tradition states that Balch was named after his father. Other sources disagree that the elder Hezekiah Balch was his father referring to the man as his cousin. While he was still a child, Balch's family moved south to Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. Due to the recommendation of a local preacher, he attended Princeton starting in 1758. In 1766, Balch received his Master of Arts from Princeton and was ordained in 1770. While at Princeton, he was one of the founders of the Cliosophic Society. Work Balch's first acts as a pastor were as a missionary in the rural areas of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina. After his travels as a missionary, he settled in Greeneville, Tennessee and then founded a church in 1783. Balch was a part of a group of Presbyterian preachers in Eastern Tennessee who taught a form of abolitionist Evangelicalism. This formed the basis of the abolitionist movement in the state in the 1830s. Due to the growth in the number of congregations in the area, Balch worked to establish a presbytery in Greeneville in 1800. In 1795 he helped found Greeneville College, the first college west of the Appalachian Mountains, in Greeneville, Tennessee. The school's first location was a frame building on Balch's farm. At the first meeting of the school's board of trustees, on 18 February 1795, Balch was chosen as the college's president. He stayed in the position until his death in 1810. After being named the college president, Balch traveled through New England raising money for the new college. In 1805, Balch received a Doctor of Divinity from Williams College. Death The last years of Balch's life were plagued with illness, but in April 1810, Balch came down with \\"brief but most distressing illness\\" and died. He was buried in Harmony Graveyard in Greeneville, Tennessee. The inscription on the tomb of Rev.

The station was established in 1933, and has played an important role in the telecommunications between the Svalbard archipelago and the outside world. The station was destroyed by both sides during World War II, and rebuilt in 1946. The station was important for ships traffic and air traffic. Satellite communications were established in 1979, but depreciated when a fiber optic cable between Svalbard and the mainland was finished in 2004. Isfjord Radio was automated and depopulated in 1999. Parts of the outdated installations have been preserved as a historical site. History Isfjord Radio in 1933 During the early 1930s there were two main coast radio stations in Svalbard: Svalbard Radio in Longyearbyen and Barentsburg Radio. Ship traffic for export of coal increased during the period, but neither of the coast radio stations had good coverage and in 1932 there were two Soviet ships which went aground. Arktikugol took initiative to better the navigational aids in Isfjorden, including a better location for a coast radio station. Planning was carried out between the Lighthouse and Buoy Authority, the Telegraphy Administration, the Ministry of Trade and Industry and the Norwegian Polar Institute, resulting in Kapp Linn√© being proposed as a suitable location for a radio station. The plans were approved by Parliament on 16 May 1933, along with a grant of 100,000 Norwegian krone (NOK). On 19 June Parliament allocated additional spending to purchase the land Russekeila from Arthur S. Lewin.Kristiansen: 65 The Polar Institute was responsible for planning the building and appointed Anders Kristian Orvin to be in charge. The Telegraphy Administration was responsible for the technical equipment. The transmission and lighthouse equipment was shipped from Oslo on 24 June, arrived 8 July and was unloaded by 13 July. Construction was carried out by twelve men, working eleven-hour shifts, allowing completion on 13 September. The work included a radio transmitter, three buildings, a boathouse, a forge, a slipway and three lighthouses‚Äîat Kapp Linn√©, Festningen and Vestpynten. The main building was , with the smaller buildings being .Kristiansen: 66 The transmitter was a Telefunken telegraphy and telephony transmitter with a 300-watt capacity. It was decided that support for radio bearing would not be installed,Kristiansen: 67 as it would cost NOK 5,000. The station opened on 13 November 1933; at first it had three employees, later four. The crew were hired for one year at a time, with the telegraphist normally taking over the role as manager the following year.Kristiansen: 68 A fatal accident occurred on 10 October 1939, when Ole Sivertsen was hit in the head by a crank which had loosened from a crane.Kristiansen: 91 The crew which built the station in 1933 Ing√∏y Radio was bombed by the German Luftwaffe on 6 June 1940 during World War II. The Norwegian population on Svalbard was evacuated to Scotland on 3 September 1941. To avoid the infrastructure coming into the hands of Germany, Isfjord Radio and other radio stations were destroyed prior to the evacuation.Kristiansen: 70 The German battleship Tirpitz bombarded Isfjord Radio on 8 September 1943 as part of Operation Zitronella, as the Kriegsmarine did not know if the station was operative or not.Kristiansen: 71 Planning of the reestablishment of Isfjord Radio started in 1945, following requests from the Polar Institute and the Norwegian Meteorological Institute to the Ministry of Trade and Industry. The Polar Institute was given the responsibility for building the station, while the Telegraphy Administration was given the responsibility for the technical equipment. Transport of equipment started on 29 June 1946 and arrived at Kapp Linn√© on 11 July. Construction started on 15 July and was at first led by Gunnar Horn; he died after only a few days and the work was subsequently led by Reidar Lyngaas.Kristiansen: 73 Twenty-seven men worked on the construction, of which nineteen lived in a barracks and the rest in tents. Seven soldiers and a Jeep were used to dig down of cable.Kristiansen: 75 The main building was a copy of the pre-war building and was built on the foundation, which had survived the war. It was supplemented with a radio building and a barracks for 21 people. The slipway and boathouse survived the war.Kristiansen: 76 The new station was equipped with radio bearing.Kristiansen: 79 Following two ships running aground at the mouth of Isfjorden in 1949, demands were raised for Isfjord Radio to be equipped with radar. Neither vessel had been equipped with this and it was argued that a radio at Isfjord Radio could be used to aid vessels traveling up the fjord. Parliament granted funding and the radar was installed upon a tall mast at the station in 1950. It remained in use until 1968. Trans-polar flights between Europe and North America started in 1955 and needed to use Isfjord Radio as a navigational aid. The International Geophysical Year of 1956‚Äì57 saw increased activity in Svalbard and also increased communication over Isfjord Radio. These required an increased staffing and expansion of the station. The technical part of the main building was completed in the fall of 1956, allowing the station's staff to increase to five. The residential part was completed the following year, allowing the staff to increase to eleven. The number of telegraphists increased from four to five in 1959. The operation of radiosondes every six hours for meteorological surveys continued until 1960, after which the staff was reduced to eight.Kristiansen: 80 Map of Isfjord Radio and the surrounding area At first the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation's (NRK) radio broadcast was sent to Svalbard Radio and broadcast as medium wave. NRK was not satisfied with the quality and in 1969 started planning a better transmission system. They concluded that it would be necessary to build a microwave radio relay between Isfjord Radio and Svalbard Radio. As a temporary solution, a reception antenna was built at Kapp Linn√© and a reception antenna in Longyearbyen. Construction of the relay was approved in 1972 and carried out the following year. A reflector was built on Sokolovfjellet and the system had a capacity for 120 lines.Kristiansen: 81 The reflector blew down in a storm on 5 March 1976, and a temporary connection with four lines could not be reestablished until 1 April. Sokolovfjellet was considered unsuitable and the reflector was instead installed at Kapp Starostin. Because of the size of the reflector it could not be flown up and not until the summer could the relay be re-established. However, delays resulted in that installation had to wait until May 1977.Kristiansen: 92 The coast radio station was unmanned in 1976 and remotely controlled from Svalbard Radio, which had moved to the tower at Svalbard Airport, Longyear. Planning of a satellite connection to Svalbard had its background in the need for satellite communication with oil platforms in the North Sea via Intelsat.Kristiansen: 115 This work had commenced in 1972 and resulted two years later in Norway receiving four concessions to operate smaller than normal receives.Kristiansen: 116 Trials with satellite communications were carried out for two weeks during 1974. A antenna was installed and was able to connect with Intelsat IV.Kristiansen: 117 The success resulted in demands from the local population that the service become permanent and connected to the telephone system in Longyearbyen.Kristiansen: 118 Additional tests were necessary an experimental receiver, used to measure reception from several satellites, was installed at Isfjord Radio in 1976. Norway Telecom signed an agreement with Nera in May 1978 to build a permanent earth station at Isfjord Radio. The equipment arrived on 1 July 1979,Kristiansen: 120 and the parabolic antenna was taken into use on 19 December.Kristiansen: 121 A proposal to use Isfjord Radio for accommodation was first put forward in 1992. The idea was reconsidered in 1995,Kristiansen: 157 this time the idea was approved. The service was introduced the following year. It is only feasible to operate during the winter season, as transport has to take place on snowmobile. The service was at first provided by Telenor Svalbard, but from 1999 it was taken over by Svalbard Polar Travel.Kristiansen: 159 Station The station Telenor Maritim Radio operates a marine VHF radio transmitter at Isfjord Radio, which is remotely operated from Bod√∏ Radio.

Opened in February 2001, the centre includes 71 stores, cafes and restaurants, including Boots, Debenhams, H&M; and Next as anchor stores. A multi-screen Odeon cinema with an IMAX screen is also part of the centre. A number of existing old buildings in Uxbridge High Street were restored and incorporated into the new shopping centre, which was designed with the intention of it blending into its surroundings. Construction Former logo of The Chimes Planning for the shopping centre began in the 1990s, under the proposed name of St George's, although another development in Harrow at the time subsequently took the name. The new development, bordered by the High Street and Chippendale Waye was built beside Uxbridge tube station and incorporated many of the existing buildings on one side of the High Street. The George Street car park, a joinery works, builders' yard, garages and a row of houses on Chippendale Waye were demolished to make way for the construction, Chippendale Waye was widened to become a dual carriageway to support the extra traffic expected once the centre opened.Sherwood 2007, p.64 Bronze Age remains were found during initial excavations as part of an archaeological investigation of the site, dating from before 700 BC.Sherwood 2007, p.5 The development in Uxbridge of what would become The Mall Pavilions shopping centre in the 1970s had seen the demolition of a large area of the opposite end of the High Street in favour of an open shopping development, but was widely considered to have been unsuccessful.Sherwood 2007, p.47 During the 1980s, the centre was refurbished and a roof was built.Sherwood 2007, p.50 During the planning for The Chimes, developers with encouragement from the London Borough of Hillingdon sought instead to avoid such a move by retaining many of the original old buildings in the High Street. The name The Chimes was eventually chosen by the developers as a reference to the sound of the bells from the market house on the High Street nearby, which were traditionally rung to announce the opening of the town's market. A statue, named \\"Anticipation\\", featuring a woman, child and dog was unveiled near the front entrance of the centre on 25 June 2002 by Elizabeth II and the Prince Philip. The statue had been commissioned by Hillingdon Arts Association and was created by Anita Lafford. Her design was chosen on March 2001 following an open competition which began in January 2000. Clarke Nicholls Marcel (CNM London) were the civil & structural engineers for the new-build shopping centre. Since opening The Chimes entrance in 2010 Anchor stores including Boots and Debenhams were established in the centre, as was a multi-screen Odeon cinema.Sherwood 2007, p.59 The 19th century-built offices of the local building company Fassnidge were also refurbished and included in the new development, becoming a PizzaExpress restaurant. A new public area known as the piazza was developed in front of the Fassnidge building, and a second restaurant was built beside it, using preserved timber salvaged during the demolition of older buildings in Uxbridge in earlier years. The new restaurant was designed to resemble a Tudor-style house.Sherwood 2007, pp.62-63 The tenth anniversary of the opening of The Chimes was celebrated in February 2011, at which time it was said to be attracting 12 million customers each year. The centre was renamed \\"Intu Uxbridge\\" in 2013, following the renaming of parent Capital Shopping Centres Group plc to Intu Properties plc. In June 2014, Intu Properties sold an 80% majority stake in the centre to the Malaysian pension fund Kumpulan Wang Persaraan for ¬£175 million. Under the terms of the sale, Intu retained 20% and continued to manage the centre. Stores Stores in the centre include, Accessorize, ALDO, Boots, Debenhams, River Island, Sunglass Hut, Swarovski, French Connection, Clintons and Waterstones. A number of independent stores, as well as restaurants and a multi-screen Odeon cinema are also within the centre. In popular culture The Chimes was used to film scenes for the Channel 4 television comedy The Inbetweeners, offering itself as a shooting location on just three days' notice after another shopping centre withdrew.

No white man ever works as a slave.‚Äù ‚ÄúVery well,‚Äù replied Nitschmann, ‚ÄúI am a carpenter, and will ply my trade.‚Äù History of the Moravian Church, Chapter VI, The Foreign Missions and Their Influence After some difficulty, the missionaries found support from the Danish Queen and her court, and although the Danish West Indian Company refused to grant them passage, a ship was eventually procured. Leaving Copenhagen on Oct 8, 1732, they arrived in St. Thomas two months later on December 13. While in the St. Thomas, they lived frugally and preached to the slaves, and they had a certain amount of success. The Missions of the Church of the United Brethren, pages 241-246. By 1734 they had both returned to Germany, but other Moravian missionaries continued the work, establishing churches on St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John‚Äôs, Jamaica, Antigua, Barbados, and St. Kitts. Moravian missionaries baptized 13,000 converts before any other missionaries arrived on the scene. History of the Moravian Church, Chapter VI, The Foreign Missions and Their Influence After returning from the West Indies, both men continued to serve in the Moravian church, and both were ordained as bishops. Dober remained in Europe, but Nitschmann traveled with John Wesley and helped to found the mission at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Missions of the Church of the United Brethren, pages 241-246.

Its mission is to improve wages and working conditions for the nation's low wage restaurant workforce. Its tactics and strategy have drawn fire from business groups and restaurant industry lobbyists. As of 2013, ROC claimed to represent 13,000 restaurant workers, 100 employers and 2,000 consumer members in 32 cities across the United States. History The group was founded with funding from multiple foundations with a stated goal to ‚Äúorganize all unorganized restaurant workers in New York City.‚Äù ROC-NY was founded by immigration attorney Saru Jayaraman and Windows on the World waiter Fekkak Mamdouh and other restaurant workers who survived the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 to provide support for the displaced workers, including undocumented immigrants. These workers had worked in restaurants in the WTC, including in the Windows on the World restaurant located on its top floors.The Real News Network, 11 November 2011, \\"9/11 Survivors Create Worker Owned Restaurants 9/11: Restaurant worker survivors open fair wage businesses\\" Jayaraman is author of Behind the Kitchen Door (2013), a book that follows the lives of restaurant workers in eight American cities, seeking to call attention to their low wages, along with unfair labor practices, exploitation, and unsanitary kitchen practices. Mamdouh is the co- author, with Rinku Sen, of The Accidental American: Immigration and Citizenship in the Era of Global Immigration (2008), a book that argues for a free flow of international labor to match globalization‚Äôs free flow of capital. The March 2013 announcement by Richard L. Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, that organized labor would work more closely groups focusing on aid immigrant workers is one factor in the decision by business groups to target ROC. ROC supports the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2013. ROC is a target of the National Restaurant Association and allied lobbyists like Richard Berman. Activities ROC conducts labor campaigns to encourage restaurant owners to increase wages and change working conditions for employees. Also, ROC provides free training in all areas of restaurant work for restaurant workers and workers seeking employment.Restaurant Opportunities Center of New York, \\"What We Do\\" accessed November 11, 2011 In early 2012, ROC launched its \\"Dignity at Darden\\" campaign, targeting what it alleged to be discrimination and wage theft by Darden Restaurants, which owns and operates such chains as Red Lobster, Olive Garden, LongHorn Steakhouse and Capital Grille. In the Darden campaign, ROC charged that in addition to paying the lowest wages possible to Darden employees (as low as $2.13 per hour), not providing health insurance or paid sick days for a workforce of 200,000 people, the company was also an opponent of paid sick day legislation providing for a low-wage worker to stay at home and recover instead of going to work sick, which led to public exposure to hepatitis A and other medical threats.http://restaurant- hospitality.com/hrlegal/labor-activists-try-scare-tactics-darden ROC organizers appeared at Darden's 2012 annual shareholder's meeting to advance their complaints. ROC dropped the lawsuit in mid-2012.http://www.equality- law.co.uk/news/2308/66/US-Restaurant-workers-group-drops-racial- discrimination-charges-against-Darden/ In January 2014, in an unrelated lawsuit, 20,000 former and current Darden workers joined a federal lawsuit alleging that the company underpaid them. Research The organization also undertakes research on the state of the food industry with a special focus on issues that affect food workers. ROC's more than 15 published reports have been widely cited and covered by media. ROC says that in its ‚ÄúDiners‚Äô Guide‚Äù it promotes workplace \\"best practices\\" that serve as models for employers to facilitate business profitability while treating employees fairly. The methodology of the report states that when rating national chains that did not respond at the corporate level or were franchised, ROC only called individual locations in four Southern states. The report did not list the survey questions asked of the restaurants in the study or the individuals that researchers spoke with to obtain the survey answers. In a 2010 report, ROC related that 90% of 4,000 restaurant workers surveyed between 2003 and 2010 reported not receiving health insurance through their employer, while 61.5% reported that they had no insurance at all. Expansion Since its founding, ROC has expanded to 32 cities across the country with more than 13,000 restaurant workers, 100 employers and 2,000 consumers claimed as members. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United was founded in January 2008 following a national restaurant workers' convention that took place in Chicago in August 2007. ROC has affiliate offices in New York, D.C, Miami, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Houston, New Orleans, Detroit, Chicago, Oakland, and Pittsburgh. COLORS restaurants ROC-NY also helped create a worker-owned restaurant called COLORS in New York City, in an effort to demonstrate that a restaurant that treats employees fairly can still be profitable. The restaurant, according to critics, has been a consistent money loser, is closed to the public for long stretches, and has received multiple citations from the New York City Health Department for \\"critical violations.\\" The restaurant also serves as a training facility for students in ROC's training sessions for skills. ROC-Michigan opened a COLORS restaurant in downtown Detroit in September 2011.Detroit News, \\"Colors-Detroit cooks up good food and training opportunities\\" accessed November 8, 2012Huffington Post, \\"COLORS-Detroit Restaurant Cooks Up Local Foods, Labor Rights\\" accessed November 20, 2012 Attacks Washington lobbyist Richard Berman, of Berman and Company and the Center for Consumer Freedom has taken out full-page ads attacking ROC and set up a website attacking its work. Berman's Employment Policies Institute produces reports used by restaurant industry groups in their lobbying campaign against the increase in the minimum wage, although the quality and reliability of such reports has been contested by academics. Controversy In 2007, ROC was sued by its worker-owners for matters related to the profit that will come from the restaurant Colors, and requiring them to pay monthly dues, attend protests, and lobby for ROC causes and other unrelated causes, including against the war in Iraq. The workers that objected were fired by Saru Jayaraman, although all claims in the lawsuit were dismissed by the court.All claims in the lawsuit were dismissed by the court;see decision: Godoy v. Restaurant Opportunity Center of New York, 615 F.Supp.2d 186 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). In 2010 it was reported that COLORS New York was ‚Äústruggling to pay its bills, and it's sorting out management problems dating back to its inception.‚Äù U.S. Congressman Darrell Issa (R-CA), chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, wrote in a letter to Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis that Colors in New York City had a \\"troubling history of poor sanitation.\\"New York Post, \\"House probes NY restaurant-harass group\\" accessed November 12, 2012 In addition, the House Committee on Education and the Workforce is investigating whether ROC should be subject to federal labor laws.

After the fall of the Soviet Union, Chernomyrdin organized the Soviet oil industry into the Gazprom corporation. Aims The Gore- Chernomyrdin Commission was formed in order to promote cooperation between Russia and the United States on issues of space exploration, energy, trade and business development, defense conversion, science and technology, health, agriculture, and environment. =Space Exploration= The U.S. and Russia agreed to cooperate in terms of space exploration by working more as a team, rather than against one another. The U.S. and Russia agreed on several occasions to attempt to build one space station together, the International Space Station, to further improve space shuttle designs, and cooperative U.S. and Russian space technology research. The leaders of the space cooperation agreements of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission included NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin and General Director of the Russian Space Agency Yuri Koptev. =Energy= The energy agreements and policies of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission were facilitated by Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary and Minister of Fuel and Energy Yuri Shafranik. These agreements included increasing the safety of nuclear reactors, increasing the efficiency and productivity of Russian natural gas extraction, and also ties into the environmental policies on the Commission which included reducing pollution of the environment. The Commission also prohibited the use of plutonium in nuclear weapons. The environmental policies were led by Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner and Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources Victor Danilov-Danilyan. =Trade and Business= The United States and Russian trade and business agreements included methods to increase the financial strength of both countries. The U.S. hoped to increase investment in the Russian economy, while also hoping to open U.S. businesses in Russia. The two countries also attempted to create a private Russian gasoline corporation, in hopes of determining the most effective conditions for prosperity of such a company. The trade and business policies were aided by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov. =Defense Conversion= The defense conversion policies were led by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, First Deputy Minister of Defense, Andrei Kokoshin, and First Deputy Minister of the Economy, Valeriy Makhailov. These policies attempted to convert military production away from the government to civilian production. These efforts were large financial endeavors. =Science and Technology= The sector of science and technology, run by OSTP Director Jack Gibbons and Minister of Science Boris G. Saltykov, included improvements of highways systems and other transportation issues, biological research, geological research, engineering, and oil and natural gas research. The health policies of the Commission included improvement of health education and treatments, as well as health policies and reforms, and were led by Secretary of Health Donna Shalala and Minister of Health and Medical Industry Eduard Nechayev. =Agribusiness= One of the later forming committees was that of Agribusiness. The Agribusiness committee included improvement of the agriculture industry in terms of production and trade. This committee was led by Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman and Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha. Abuses of the Commission In the early 1990s, the United States government gave responsibility to the Harvard Institute for International Development to help the Russian government transition from a public economy to a private economy.Wedel, Janine R. 2009. Shadow Elite: How the World‚Äôs New Power Brokers Undermine Democracy, Government, and the Free Market. New York, NY: Basic Books Group. The Harvard Project was led by Andrei Shleifer and Jonathon Hays. Anatoly Chubais, a Russian economist, politician, and businessman represented Russia in privatization effort. This group of individuals had a great deal of power and influence over the privatization process. As part of their privatization strategy, Chubais, Shleifer, and Hays (along with several others) used their insider access to different types of information to limit that information to their private network, enriching themselves and many others in the process (see Russian oligarchs). One of the committees on which the members of this small group sat was the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which Janine Wedel describes as follows :\\"Members of the intertwined Chubais- Harvard network appointed each other to visible binational posts in economic, energy, and high tech areas. They arranged for each other to be well represented on the high-level Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission...which helped to facilitate cooperation on U.S.-Russian oil deals and the Mir Space Station, among other issues.\\" References Category:Russia‚ÄìUnited States relations ","title":"Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission"},{"id":"33716269","title":"1976 South American Youth Championships in Athletics"},{"id":"33716299","text":"Ron McKay is a New Zealand former rugby league footballer who represented New Zealand in the 1954 World Cup.

Known for her beauty, wit, and business acumen, White accumulated a significant fortune over the course of her career, married a middle-class lawyer in her thirties, and died suddenly a year later. Rumors that White had been poisoned caused a public outcry, which forced an inquest into her death. Early life Jane Augusta Funk was born on March 22, 1823 in Cherry Valley, Otsego County, New York, the eldest daughter of farmers Jacob and Jane B. Funk.Life and Death, p. 5.‚ÄúSudden Death of a Notorious Woman‚Äù, The New York Times, October 18, 1860 Her mother died when she was just 8 years old, while her father died in 1847.Cherry Valley Cemetery Funk received a basic education and was considered a bookish girl. At age seventeen or eighteen, Funk \\"became the victim of a seducer.\\"Life and Death, p. 6Sanger, p. 454. A \\"seducer\\" was an older man who seduced na√Øve young women, often with a promise of marriage, only to abandon them. \\"Seduced and abandoned\\" women were considered ruined and were shunned by middle class Victorian society.Sanger, p. 495 Seduction reportedly was the third most common \\"cause\\" of prostitution in New York in the early 1800s, after economic motives and \\"inclination,\\"Sanger, p. 488. and was viewed as a social problem by moral reformers.Hill, pp. 140-141. In the fall of 1842, Funk went to New York City, to her older brother John H. Funk, a house carpenter who had moved there six years earlier.‚ÄúThe Blankman Will Case Testimony of John H. Funk.‚Äù, The New York Times, March 5, 1861Bungay, p. 25. Funk's husband would later accuse John of refusing to help his ruined sister.‚ÄúThe Blankman Will Case.‚Äù, The New York Times, February 19, 1861 Funk found menial work at a hotel to try to support herself. In 1843, Funk joined a \\"house of prostitution at 120 Church street,\\" where she assumed her professional name of Fanny White. Career In ante- bellum New York most brothels were owned and controlled by women.Hill, pp. 24-25. The average prostitute entered the business before age 21 and lasted four years.Sanger, p. 455. Most practiced the trade part-time; few continued past age 30.Sanger, pp. 252.Hill, pp. 91-95. Many contracted tuberculosis or syphilis.Hill, pp. 232-234. Fanny White had the business sense and good luck to beat the odds. A few months after starting work at 120 Church Street, White moved up to Julia Brown's brothel on West Broadway, near the National Theater.Life and Death, p. 7. By 1847, the 24-year-old White was managing the brothel at 120 Church Street where she used to work.Hill, p. 104. Also by 1847, she had met lawyer and Tammany Hall brother Daniel Sickles.Kenneally, p. 16 White's staff considered Sickles to be her \\"man\\". Nineteenth century prostitutes commonly had a \\"man\\" or a \\"friend\\" with whom they developed a romantic attachment.Hill, p. 269. A prostitute's paramour did not normally pay for her attention, although Sickles did give White generous gifts of jewelry and money.Swanberg, p. 83. In 1851, White purchased a building at 119 Mercer Street,Hill, p. 102. which she outfitted as a discreet, high-class brothel. \\"[H]er customers were merchants, Congressmen, and those belonging to the diplomatic corps on visits to New York.\\" White carefully maintained good relations with the police so her establishment would escape official notice. White's indiscreet relationship with Daniel Sickles, however, attracted considerable notice. After Sickles was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1847, he brought White to his hotel in Albany, where he introduced her around the breakfast table to the dismayed guests.Kenneally, p. 17. He took White to visit the State Assembly Chamber, for which action he was censured by the Whigs. Another evening the two of them went out on the town with White illegally dressed as a man, and ended up spending the night in jail. Sickles almost certainly arranged the mortgage on White's Mercer Street brothel, using the name of his friend (and future father-in-law) Antonio Bagioli.Hill, p. 281. Rumors that White contributed her own earnings to Sickles' election campaign would haunt Sickles for the rest of his political career.Swanberg, p. 339. In September 1852, Sickles hastily married sixteen-year-old Teresa Bagioli.Swanberg, p. 86. White was rumored to be so angry that she followed him to a hotel and attacked him with a riding whip.Life and Death, p. 8. But in August 1853, when Sickles traveled to England as the secretary to James Buchanan, the U. S. Minister to the Court of St. James, White accompanied him in lieu of his wife.Kenneally, pp. 1-3. One source alleges that Sickles arranged for her passport. Fellow madam Kate Hastings moved to 119 Mercer to manage White's brothel in her absence. In England, White accompanied Sickles openly to theaters, operas, and diplomatic events.Kenneally, p. 38. Most sources agree that White made her curtsey to Queen Victoria at a reception at Buckingham Palace, where Sickles introduced her as \\"Miss Bennett of New York.\\"Swanberg, p. 92. Historians speculate that White talked Sickles into the introduction, and that Sickles was further motivated by his intense dislike of both the monarchy and of the editor of the New York Herald, James Gordon Bennett, Sr. Queen Victoria apparently never learned the truth, but Bennett was furious at the use of his name. The Life and Death of Fanny White, however, alleges that White legally changed her name before she left for Europe. And after 1853, White signed bank drafts and business contracts with the name \\"J. Augusta Bennett.\\"‚ÄúSurrogate‚Äôs Court.; The Blankman Will Case Continuation of Contestants‚Äô Testimony‚Äù, The New York Times, February 28, 1861‚ÄúSurrogate‚Äôs Court.; The Blankman Will Case Contestants‚Äô Testimony Continued.‚Äù, The New York Times, March 2, 1861 When Teresa Bagioli Sickles arrived in London in the spring of 1854, White left.Swanberg, p. 93.

Back in New York, White established a second brothel behind the St. Nicholas Hotel and also resumed management of 119 Mercer Street. By 1856, White was seen riding around New York in the carriage of the wealthy, much older Jacob Rutgers LeRoy, one of the LeRoys of the Triangle Tract in western New York.Hill, p. 282.Belluscio.

Reform of Jane Augusta Blankman About 1857, White met criminal defense lawyer Edmon Blankman, seven years her junior. They married in 1859 and White became Jane Augusta Blankman.Life and Death, p. 13. At the time of her marriage, \\"it was said she owned several houses in the city, which were allegedly gifts from suitors, as well as a $5,000 annuity and a real- estate lot reportedly given to her by a male friend.\\" Jane Blankman was generous to her family. In 1856 she paid her brother John $2,500 for a lifelong lease on a house he owned, and gave the lease to their widowed sister, Mrs. Eliza Williams. Blankman contributed half the money to purchase a Funk family lot at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. Blankman bought her younger brother, Hiram Funk, enough shares in the Resolute Fire Insurance Company that he was able to obtain a position as surveyor for the company.Costello. She helped to raise and she paid for the schooling of her niece, Lillian Bennett.‚ÄúThe Case of Mrs. Blankman.; Verdict‚Äù, The New York Times, October 22, 1860 She owned the fashionable property at No. 49 West. 34th Street where she and her new husband lived as Mr. and Mrs. Blankman.Life and Death, p. 14. She refused, however, to sign the property over to Edmon when he asked for it. When a friend asked her why not, Blankman allegedly replied that \\"she was not such a fool,\\" and \\"that ever since her suspicions had been aroused with regard to [Edmon] trying to have intimacy with her niece, she had lost all confidence in him.\\" Controversial death Edmon Blankman, Esq. On October 12, 1860, Jane Blankman died suddenly at her home. She was 37 and had no known children. Rumors began immediately that her husband had poisoned her to gain access to her fortune. Her brother arranged for an autopsy to be conducted by Doctors Finnell and Sands, who concluded that Blankman had died of apoplexy (a stroke). Her body was packed in ice and taken to Green-Wood Cemetery to be interred. But on October 16, motivated by continued rumors of poisoning, city Coroner Schirmer and District Attorney Waterbury ordered that Blankman's remains be re-examined at Bellevue Hospital.‚ÄúThe Case of Mrs. Blankman.; A Second Post-Mortem‚Äù, The New York Times, October 22, 1860 The three-day inquest became a cause c√©l√®bre and was reported in The New York Times. The doctors who re-examined Blankman's body reported signs of exposure to tuberculosis and syphilis, as well as symptoms of cardiovascular disease and extensive bleeding in the brain, but found no sign of poisoning. The Life and Death of Fanny White describes her as \\"frail,\\" but the doctor who pronounced her dead described her as \\"very stout.\\" On October 20, 1860, the Coroner affirmed the verdict of death by apoplexy. Blankman's siblings wanted to bury her in the Funk family plot, but her remains were buried on March 25, 1861 in the Blankman family plot at Green- Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.Green-Wood Cemetery National Historic Landmark The \\"total value of her property at the time of her death was variously estimated at from $50,000 to $100,000\\"Life and Death, p. 16. ‚Äì or $1 to $2 million U.S. ‚Äì but that may have been a significant underestimate of its real value.Hill, p. 103 In the will presented by Edmon Blankman, she left almost her entire estate to her husband.

Population: Jewish History A Jewish community was organized in Sataniv in the second half of the 16th century, in the kingdom of Poland. Jews in Sataniv were involved in the import of goods from the east, leasing of estates and customs dues, manufacture of alcoholic drinks, and goldsmithery. The town was periodically attacked by the Tatars and Cossacks, including combined attacks in 1651 and from the Cossacks in 1703. The synagogue in Sataniv was built as a fortress to allow the Jews and the wider community to defend themselves in such attacks. In the 18th century Sataniv was Podolia's leading community. In 1756 its dayyanim (religious judges) held a trial of the Frankists. In 1765 there were 1,369 Jews paying the poll tax in Sataniv. The Jews there were involved in international commerce, traveling to fairs in Leipzig, Breslau, and Frankfurt, until 1793, when Sataniv was incorporated into Russia. The Hebrew writer and maskil Isaac Satanow lived in Sataniv, and was active there in the latter half of the 18th century. He, Menachem Mendel Lefin, and Alexander b. ·∫íevi Margaliot, all of whom also lived in the town, were among the pioneers of the Haskalah movement. From the end of the 18th century and during the 19th, Sataniv was an important center of Hasidism. Until 1862 the Jewish settlement there was restricted by the authorities, because of Sataniv's closeness to the Austrian border. The Jewish population was 2,848, 64% of the total, in 1897. In 1919, Jews in Sataniv underwent pogroms by Ukrainian nationalists. In 1926 Satanov probably had 2,359 Jews, then declining to 1,516, or 40% of the total population. A rural Jewish council existed in the Soviet period. On 6 July 1941 the Germans entered Sataniv, and on 14 [15(?)] May 1942 they locked 286 Jews into two cellars, letting them suffocate. (The Remains of the 286 victiums were found July 27.2020)Jewish Telegraph Agency July 27,2020. Throughout 1942, 210 Jews were shot. The Germans murdered 800 people according to official numbers, most of them Jews.

The is a mid-13th century emaki, a Japanese picture scroll, inspired by the private diary (nikki) of Murasaki Shikibu, lady-in-waiting at the 10th/11th centuries Heian court and author of The Tale of Genji. This emaki belongs to the classical style of Japanese painting known as yamato-e and revives the iconography of the Heian period. Today there remain four paper scrolls of the emaki in varying condition and stored in different collections: Hachisuka, Matsudaira, Hinohara scrolls (Tokyo), and Fujita scroll (Fujita Art Museum, Osaka). Of the extant scrolls, the first relates the celebrations on occasion of the birth of prince Atsunari (Atsuhira, later Emperor Go-Ichij≈ç) in 1008 and the last those of the birth of Prince Atsunaga (later Emperor Go-Suzaku) in 1009. This difference in time indicates that the original emaki most likely consisted of more scrolls than exist today.  Description  records the daily life of the Heian era lady-in-waiting and writer, Lady Murasaki Shikibu, author of The Tale of Genji. Most likely written between 1008 and 1010, the largest portion consists of descriptive passages of the birth of Empress Sh≈çshi's (Akiko) children (future Emperors Go-Ichij≈ç and Go-Suzaku) and related festivities, with smaller vignettes describing life at the Imperial court and relations between other ladies-in-waiting and court writers such as Izumi Shikibu, Akazome Emon and Sei Sh≈çnagon. It also gives a lively account of the regency of the powerful Fujiwara no Michinaga. Like the romantic novel Genji Monogatari, the diary deals with emotions and human relationships, particularly with Murasaki Shikibu's constraints at the court of Akiko, loneliness and futility after her husband's death (in 1001). The author is critical of her contemporaries, the men for their discourteous ways (including Fujiwara no Michinaga) and the women for their inexperience and lack of education and will. The diary is considered a masterpiece of Nikki Bungaku. Emaki, which are long paper scrolls telling a story through texts and paintings, came to Japan through exchange with the Chinese Empire around the 6th century and spread widely among the Heian aristocracy. The subsequent Kamakura period was marked by internal strife and civil wars that fostered the rise of the warrior class. If the warriors of the bakufu preferred \\"quick- moving narrative scrolls\\" such as war tales or legends, the production of emaki at the Heian court subsisted. Pictures illustrating The Tale of Genji continued to be popular into the early Kamakura period and revived interest in the author, Murasaki Shikibu. Towards the end of the 13th century, a renewed interest in the refined culture of the Heian period led some artists to return to painting styles of the Imperial Court; many emaki were produced during this period. The Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki belongs to this golden age of the emaki and according to Penelope Mason \\"may be regarded as one of the finest extant examples of prose-poetry narrative illustration from the Kamakura period\\". It was created about 200 years after the diary was written, in the mid-13th century.Suzuki Keiz≈ç, a scholar of the history of costume dated it to around 1250. It transcribes the solitude and the observations of palace life from the diary but adds to the text a certain nostalgia for the glorious past of the Heian court which is typical for the 13th century, giving an overall feeling of \\"lost golden age\\", according to Mason, even during happy events such as parties. The explanatory notes (or captions), i.e. the non-painting part, show little textual deviations from the diary. An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is mentioned in the Meigetsuki (\\"Record of the clean moon\\"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned to create a new emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, the best known of these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case. The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Goky≈çgoku (Âæå‰∫¨Ê•µËâØÁµå, 1169‚Äì1206), despite definitive evidence.  Style and composition  Two elements are found in the illustrations of the emaki: people indoors engaging in activities typical of the aristocracy of the period, such as writing letters, playing instruments, exchanging poems or talking to each other; and the gardens outside their buildings. For this reason, Mason calls the people in the emaki \\"house bound\\". The leftward direction of scroll reading is reflected in the composition of paintings and pictures which may build to a climax from right to left; or a main event presented on the right may be followed by its after- effects to the left. Stylistically the emaki follows the principles of the onna-e genre of yamato-e and is in this respect similar to the Tale of Genji Scrolls (1120‚Äì1140) but differs from them in many other aspects. Typical for onna-e, the paintings depict life at the palace with a sense of nostalgia, timeless and very retained, but purely decorative elements such as landscapes and contemplative scenes are added. Illustrations are relatively shortIn the case of the Genji Monogatari Emaki, on average. compared to emaki of war or folktales,Where a single scene could be more than long which according to Mason, \\"heightens the symbolic quality of non-figural motifs\\". The painting technique of tsukuri-e (\\"built painting\\"), used mainly in emaki of the court in the twelfth century, is also used here. It is done in three stages: a first sketch of the scene is made with Indian ink (probably by a master of the workshop), then the color is applied on the entire surface of the paper in a specific order, from large areas in the background to fine details. Finally, the contours are enhanced or revived in ink to emphasize the depth. However, a visible change in style may again be noted, because the pigments are here less opaque than usual, and the more subtle shades are highlighted by fine outlines in ink; and in addition, the decorative aspect emerges strongly through extensive use of gold dust, and sometimes of silver. According to Mason, the technique seems to be less careful than in the past, as can be seen in elements of the architectural interior (sliding doors, screens ...) which lack detail or in the silver powder which is used much less often in general compared to gold. The cultural changes after the Heian period resulted in a more realistic depiction of figures including movements and gestures. Abandoning the Heian period hikime kagibana style (\\"slit eyes, hooked nose\\"),technique of representing the faces with four lines on a white background, similar to Noh masks to mark the extreme reclusiveness of the aristocrats figures were painted individual features and facial expressions that conveyed emotions and moods. More generally, M. Murase notes that the expression of feelings subtly changed compared to the scrolls of the 12th century; here the rooms (or the inner space, because it depends on the fusuma) in the palace are larger and less intimate or private, and nobles come and go naturally and determined. Unlike earlier scrolls such as the Genji Emaki, in which architecture and landscape were used as metaphors for people's emotions, interpersonal or societal pressures, in these scrolls the people's feelings are painted directly on the faces or shown through gestures, in addition to being expressed by the placement of characters within the scene. Architectural elements such as pillars, beams or platforms continued to be used to convey moods. Landscapes stand on their own as they are detached from the characters' emotions and gain a new function as a place to escape from the constraints of court life. Like most emaki, the composition is based on the fukinuki yatai (\\"blown-off roof\\") technique, which consists of a perspective of looking down from above into the inner spaces resulting in a plunging view. Furthermore, diagonals are used to mark depth. Compared to earlier scrolls, in these scrolls, the interior spaces are depicted from a more normal perspective such as through rolled up bamboo blinds (misu) or spaces in the walls where sliding panels (fusuma) had been removed. The pace that is intentionally slow in tsukuri-e, here seems slightly faster with illustrations depicting a single occurrence in time and temporally related events positioned close to each other in the emaki. This new decorative approach to paintings of the court (onna-e) inspired by the themes of literature is evident in several other works of the Kamakura period, such as uta monogatari (e.g. The Tales of Ise Emaki), tsukuri monogatari (e.g. Sumiyoshi Monogatari Emaki) and romances (e.g. ).  Historiography  The illustrations provide insight into life and festivities at the Heian Palace; which sometimes consisted of something as simple as games on the lake although those might have been perceived differently at the time of manufacture. Like other picture scrolls on court life such as the Genji Monogatari Emaki or the Pillow Book Emaki (Makura no S≈çshi Emaki) they provide valuable information on the architectural shinden- zukuri style (particularly on interiors) which is characterized by a mixture of Tang and traditional Japanese influences. Extant scrolls It is thought that the emaki originally consisted of 10‚Äì12 scrolls. The ancestral heritage of the emaki before the Edo period is not known and an investigation conducted during the Meiji period, found that only four scrolls had survived, each high and about long. The owners and state of preservation of all four scrolls has since changed. The extant parts correspond to about 15 percent of the original diary and are not in sequence. They consist of 24 scenes of varying widths distributed among three scrolls, six single sheets and two hanging scrolls in six different locations: Fujita Art Museum, Gotoh Museum, Tokyo National Museum and three private collections. Each scroll begins with a text section and generally alternates scene descriptions with illustrations, ending with a painting. In two instances a long text section is split in two parts3rd text of Hachisuka and 4th text of Hinohara scroll. and the Hachisuka scroll has an accumulation of three illustrationsPaintings 3, 4 and 5. unseparated by text, and an accumulation of two unseparated independent text sections.Texts 6 and 7. =Hachisuka scroll= Chronologically the oldest scenes of the emaki, combined with some of the later anecdotes in the diary, are contained in the Hachisuka scroll. Named after its former owner, the Hachisuka clan, rulers of the Tokushima Domain in Awa Province, this scroll is privately owned. It consists of eight illustrations and seven text sections on 16 paper sheets. The long third text section is split in two parts and followed by three illustrations. The seventh text section immediately follows the sixth without a painting between the two. The full scroll is long and has been designated as Important Cultural Property. Scenes 1‚Äì5 correspond to a continuous part of the diary and are the oldest diary entries represented by any of the four extant emaki scrolls. Scenes 6 and 7 correspond to later diary entries and appear in the diary after several of the scenes described in the other three extant scrolls. Third day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç Nobles offering congratulations The Hachisuka scroll starts with a description of a banquet given by the queen's majordomo and managed by the governor of ≈åmi Province on Kank≈ç 5, 9th month, 13th day (October 14, 1008), the third night of the birth of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç, the later Emperor Go-Ichij≈ç. On that occasion, the mother, Empress Sh≈çshi received presents such as baby clothes and furniture. The illustration associated with this scene shows court nobles on the balconies outside of the principal building in which the queen is located. Fifth day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç Fourth painting (right), fifth painting (middle) and fourth text section (left) The second to fifth scenes of the Hachisuka scroll are set in the evening of Kank≈ç 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008). On that day, the prime minister and baby's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga, celebrates the birth. In the second text scene of the emaki, Murasaki Shikibu describes how everybody including servants, minor officials and high nobility was joyful and happy. Tables with rice balls (mochi) were placed in the garden, the full moon shone beautifully and torches made the scene as bright as in daylight. There is one illustration following this scene. The third text is split in two parts, followed by three illustrations. The text contains a detailed description of how the dinner was served to the queen including the names of the maids of honour and their father's names. The ladies who had not been selected to attend \\"wept bitterly\\". Other people involved in the ceremony included uneme,beautiful women selected for their beauty mohitori,officials in charge of wells, soy sauce and ice-houses migusiage,attendants whose hair was done up with hairpins tonomori,King's housekeepers kanmori no nyokwancleaners and door keepers. According to Murasaki Shikibu so many people were involved that it was hard to get through. Court lady exits beneath blinds The relatively short fourth scene describes that the maids of honour exit from the queen's room which had been partitioned off by misua thinly woven bamboo curtain hung before great people and women's apartments entering the torch-lit garden. It also gives more details and an interpretation of the dress of one of those maids, Lady Oshikibu. The seventh painting, located between the 5th (right) and 6th (left) text sections The short fifth passage is a continuation of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept night watch telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot see such a lovely thing every day, to which he replies: Indeed! indeed! clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly behind the screen. Our lady of the chronicle Murasaki Shikibu (right) reading to Empress Sh≈çshi (left). A scroll of is spread on a maki-e writing desk between them. This anecdote, the sixth scene of the Hachisuka scroll, occurs at an unspecified date in 1009. It is part of a description of the lady Saemon no Naishi who, Murasaki Shikibu writes in the diary, hated her. Naishi spread the rumour that Murasaki Shikibu was proud of her Chinese learning (which in the Heian period was the domain of the male aristocracy) and gave her the name \\"Japanese Chronicle Lady\\".After the Chronicles of Japan written in Classical Chinese. In the anecdote, Murasaki Shikibu explains she learned Chinese in childhood, that she was taught not to be proud of her learning, keeping it a secret during her life in fear of how others would judge her. The text in the emaki relates how Empress Sh≈çshi requested that Murasaki Shikibu read to her in Chinese and teach her the poetical works of Bai Juyi (in particular the part known as ) in secrecy. Nevertheless, the Emperor and Prime Minister found out about it and presented to the Empress a number of poetical works. Gosechi dancers This final scene in the Hachisuka scroll is about a scene from the Gosechi, an ancient dance performed by young beautiful girls in the 11th month to celebrate the harvest. The emaki text begins with a description of the appearance and clothing of two of the participating girls and ends with a scene in which the girls throw down their fans as the secretaries of the sixth rank approached them to take away their fans. Murasaki Shikibu considered the dancers graceful but unlike girls. This particular scene is set on Kank≈ç 5, 11th month, 22nd day (December 22, 1008). Painting only scenes The Hachisuka scroll contains paintings which are not associated with any text sections of the scroll. The fifth painting of the scroll corresponds to a scene described in the second text section of the Hinohara scroll, where Murasaki Shikibu is looking back to her first time at court. The painting shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a room with closed tsumado (hinged plank door) and shitomido (latticed shutters). Next to her is an old- fashioned interior light-fixture consisting of a wooden pole with an oil- filled dish and wick on top of it (t≈çdai).For a reproduction as relief see the lower image on this page. The final illustration of the Hachisuka scroll has no corresponding text section in the extant emaki fragments. However its content can be matched to a scene from the diary in which Murasaki Shikibu expresses her sorrows as a widowHer husband had died in 1001. worrying about the future. She relates how she is gazing dreamily at the moon when she is \\"hopelessly sad\\" and lonely. Playing the koto (a kind of horizontal harp) on a cool evening makes her even more miserable. This section of the diary also contains a short description of her room containing two bookcases, one with books that her husband had placed there and that no one has touched since, the other with \\"old poems and romances\\", likely referring to her own works. This scene is set on an unknown date in Kank≈ç 6 (1009). The illustration present in the emakiFor a reproduction as relief see the upper image on this page. For a recent reproduction of the painting see this image . shows Murasaki Shikibu inside a tatami room playing the koto with a court lady walking outside her room on the balcony (engawa). =Fujita scroll= Formerly in possession of the , rulers of the Tatebayashi Domain in K≈çzuke Province, the extant Fujita scroll alternates five sections of text and five paintings. Based on this ancestral heritage it is sometimes referred to as former Akimoto scroll. A sixth text only section has been preserved as a 19th-century copy from the original emaki. The extant scroll is long, in possession of the Fujita Art Museum, Osaka and was designated as National Treasure of Japan on June 28, 1956. It covers the time from the evening of the 5th day celebration of the birth of the first Imperial Prince, Atsuhira-shinn≈ç, the later Emperor Go- Ichij≈ç, and ends with the furnishing of Michinaga's residence for the visit of Emperor Ichij≈ç. Fifth day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç Second painting. Set shortly after the fifth scene of the Hachisuka scroll, this scene relates events from the evening of Kank≈ç 5, 9th month, 15th day (October 16, 1008), the day Michinaga celebrated the birth of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç. Some people were casting daA gambling game played with dice now not known. others composed poems. Murasaki Shikibu then praises Fujiwara no Kint≈ç's repartee and skills in the composition of poetry; however on this evening he did not participate in the exchange of poems. The queen gave gift of robes and baby dresses to the highest ranked ladies; lined kimonos to those of 4th rank; and hakama to the lesser sixth ranked ladies. A boating party The second section is a direct continuation of the previous scene, recounting an outing of young courtiers, dressed in white, going boating on a moonlit night the following day (Kank≈ç 5, 9th month, 16th day, or 17 October 1008 in the Gregorian calendar). The ladies left behind appeared jealous according to Murasaki Shikibu. Ox-drawn carts of Emperor's ladies-in-waiting (illustration of the 3rd scene) Continuing from the previous scene, confusion occurs among the people in the boats as palanquins of ladies-in-waiting of the Emperor's court appear near the shelter for conveyances. Michinaga welcomes them happily and distributes gifts among them. Birth celebration organized by the Imperial Court Murasaki Shikibu (center) catches a glimpse at the Empress (left) with undone hair beyond the misu. The Emperor celebrated on Kank≈ç 5, 9th month, 17th day (October 18, 1008), the seventh day of the birth of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç. Presents were exchanged between court nobles and the Emperor. During the evening ceremony, Murasaki Shikibu catches a glance of the queen, remarking that she appeared weary, having lost weight and gaining a pale complexion. Her \\"hair would be better tied up\\" writes Murasaki Shikibu; however she stops the description, realizing the impropriety of her depiction of the \\"mother of the nation\\". Preparations for the Imperial visit Set some time between Kank≈ç 5, 10th month, 13th day and the morning of 16th day (November 13 to 16, 1008), this scene begins with a description of planting chrysanthemumsChrysanthemum flowers are associated with the Imperial Family. at Michinaga's mansion in preparation for the Emperor's visit. In the second part of the section, Murasaki Shikibu is musing about her melancholic life because of an \\"extraordinary sorrow\\", wishing to be more adaptable and mindless. Wondering whether she is too sinful, she yearns for a religious life. Seeing waterfowl playing heedlessly in a pond, she writes the following waka: Waterfowl floating on the water‚Äî They seem so gay, But in truth It is not gay to live anxiously seeking means of existence. Day of the Imperial visit (Tanaka Shinbi copy) A sixth text section of the Fujita scroll has been preserved in the form of a copy from the original manuscript made by (1875‚Äì1975), researcher and collector of Japanese fine arts who also assisted in the reproduction of old writings and ancient paintings including the Genji Monogatari Emaki. Starting in 1894 he worked on the reproduction of the Murasaki Shikibu Nikki Emaki. This text fragment does not include any illustration and is in possession of the Tanaka family.Final painting of the extant scroll corresponding to the sixth scene: Michinaga on the veranda of his boathouse watching courtiers enjoying themselves in the boats he has provided The scene, which in the diary directly follows the fifth scene of the Fujita scroll, tells of an exchange of letters between Murasaki Shikibu and the Lady Koshosho. Writing her response at the time of a brisk shower in a hurry in order not to keep the messenger waiting as the \\"sky looked threatening\\", Murasaki Shikibu adds the following poem to her letter: There are pauses between the showers of the outer world, But there is no time when my sleeves, wet with tears, are dry. After dark she receives the following reply from Lady Koshosho: The dark sky dulls my dreamy mind, The down- dripping rain lingers‚Äì O my tears down falling, longing after thee! Changing topic, Murasaki Shikibu mentions shortly that at the same day, Michinaga inspected two new boats, one with a dragon's head the other with a phoenix head at the prow,Both figures were said to have magical powers to prevent ships from sinking. reminding her of animated living figures. The painting located in the emaki after the fifth text section, at the end of the extant Fujita scroll and originally before the sixth scene, illustrates this inspection of boats. Penelope Mason sees this diverse composition as a nostalgic representation of the 13th century Imperial Court past its golden age, as despite of the \\"gaiety and splendor the scene is permeated with fleeting nature of joy and pleasure.\\" =Matsudaira or former Morikawa scroll= In 1920 Morikawa Kanichir≈ç (Ê£ÆÂ∑ùÂãò‰∏ÄÈÉé, 1887‚Äì1980) from Nagoya discovered a 5-segment scroll of the Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki consisting of alternatingly five illustrations and five captions. Formerly in possession of the Matsudaira clan, rulers of the Saij≈ç Domain in Iyo Province, this scroll is referred to as \\"Matsudaira clan edition\\" or after its finder as \\"Former Morikawa edition\\" (not to be confused with the Morikawa edition below which refers to the Morikawa family). Two years after discovery Morikawa sold the scroll to the Niigata businessman and master of the tea ceremony, Masuda Don≈ç (ÁõäÁî∞ÈàçÁøÅ, 1847Ôºç1938, who had it cut into parts. One part (Morikawa edition), the fifth segment, is bequeathed to the Morikawa family and today in a private collection. A year later, in 1933, Don≈ç detached the third segment and reformatted it as a hanging scroll (now in possession of the Agency for Cultural Affairs). The remaining three scenes (numbers 1, 2, 4) were framed in 1934, changed owner once more, eventually (via the Takanashi family) ending up in the collection of the Gotoh Museum. They are known collectively as \\"Gotoh edition\\". Today's Matsudaira scroll is spread over three locations and includes one National Treasure and two Important Cultural Properties. While this scroll has not survived in one piece, a 20th-century reproduction measures in at long. With the exception of the first scene of the Gotoh edition, the Matsudaira clan scroll depicts events on Kank≈ç 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the ika-no-iwai, the 50th day of birth celebration of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç, the later Emperor Go-Ichij≈ç. Gotoh edition The Gotoh edition corresponds to scenes 1, 2 and 4 of the Matsudaira clan scroll and had been partitioned off from the scroll in 1932 and 1933 by Masuda Don≈ç. It consists of 3 paintings and 3 associated captions each framed individually (six items in total). This set has been designated as National Treasure on June 28, 1956 and is located at the Gotoh Museum. =Moonlit night= The image of Murasaki Shikibu (bottom right) on the 2000 yen bank note is taken from this scene. The scene dated to Kank≈ç 5, 10th month, 17th day (November 17, 1008), shows two drunk courtiers trying to gain entrance to Murasaki Shikibu quarters after she had enjoyed the garden outside her apartment. In the illustration, Murasaki holds her window shut against the men. First to arrive at the scene is the palace steward Sangi (on right) who opens the upper part of Murasaki's lattice door and inquires whether anybody is at home. According to Murasaki Shikibu his intention is to be mentioned to Akiko. Sanenari is joined by the consort's steward (associated with Akiko), Sangi who also calls out: \\"Is anyone here?\\" Murasaki replies faintly, avoiding anything that could be regarded as flirting. Together the two courtiers are requesting her to open the lower part of the door. Such behaviour, somebody of higher rank trying to enter the house of somebody of lower rank, was in the Heian period considered disgraceful and only excused by the young age of the two courtiers. In the top right corner, Murasaki's friend, the maid Saish≈ç no Kimi, is visible. The large garden occupying the left half of the painting and the diagonally positioned building are considered to be a bold scene arrangement. According to Penelope Mason, this is \\"one of the saddest and most beautiful [scenes] in the scroll\\", contrasting the beauty of the moonlit garden and pond on the left with the constraints of court life. The latticed shitomi and the stewards separate Murasaki Shikibu from the outside world, keeping her a prisoner in the room. =50 day celebration of the birth of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç= As with all but the first scene of the Matsudaira scroll, this scene is set on the evening of Kank≈ç 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008), the day of the Ika-no-iwaiIka-no-iwai is a celebration (mainly celebrated by Heian aristocrats) 50 days after the birth in which the father or the maternal grandfather (or others) made the baby eat mochi. of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinn≈ç, the later Emperor Go-Ichij≈ç. The painting shows a room inside a shinden partitioned off by kich≈ç room dividers featuring the design of decaying trees. Empress Sh≈çshi, with the baby in her arms, is partially visible at the top. Court ladies are serving various types of ritual food. The third scene held by the Gotoh museum was originally the fourth segment of the Matsudaira clan scroll. It is therefore preceded by the segment held by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and followed by the 5th segment of the Matsudaira clan scroll which is in possession of the Morikawa family. Like those segments, this scene is dated to the evening of the Ika-no-iwai celebration of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç. It shows drunk and disordered court nobles amusing themselves with court ladies. This painting is particularly notable for its lifelike depiction of facial expressions and shapes of each figure in the scene. Former ≈åkura family fragment This item, consisting of one painting and associated caption/text, was originally the third scene of the Matsudaira clan scroll before being reshaped into a hanging scroll by Masuda Don≈ç in 1933. At some point it was in possession of the ≈åkura clan (Â§ßÂÄâÂÆ∂), but it is now owned by the Agency for Cultural Affairs and in custody of the Tokyo National Museum. It was designated an Important Cultural Property on March 31, 1953. Like its preceding and successive scenes (scenes 2 and 3 from the Gotoh edition), the painting depicts the celebration for the 50th day of the birth of the Imperial Prince Atsuhira-shinn≈ç, the later Emperor Go-Ichij≈ç in the evening of Kank≈ç 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008). The main characters are in full dress in a room decorated with kich≈ç partitioners and the prince's grandfather, Fujiwara no Michinaga at the bottom is offering rice cake (mochi) to the prince in a form of ceremonial ritual. The female servant at the bottom right is presumably the author of the diary Murasaki Shikibu. 3rd segment of former Morikawa edition. Morikawa family fragment Each of you compose a poem. If you do, you shall be excused. (ca. wide, part of the fragment with 14 lines of calligraphy cut off at the right in this image) The 5th segment of the five-segment Matsudaira clan scroll was separated in 1932 and mounted as hanging scroll. This fragment is wide. Named after their present owners, it is known as the Morikawa clan edition. It consists of a single scene with a very short illustration showing the inside of a traditional Japanese style room with fusuma sliding doors, tatami and a curtain. Like all but the first segment of this scroll, the scene is set in the evening of Kank≈ç 5, 11th month, 1st day (December 1, 1008) on occasion of the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsuhira-shinn≈ç, the later Emperor Go-Ichij≈ç. Murasaki Shikibu and Saish≈ç no Kimi had been hiding from the drunken carousal of that evening, but were discovered by Michinaga, Saish≈ç no Ch≈´j≈ç and others. The painting is dominated by the massive figure of Fujiwara no Michinaga dressed in brocade jacket and trousers and placed in the centre of the room. Murasaki Shikibu and Saish≈ç no Kimi are huddled near the border of the painting with heads bent down as a sign of submission and deference. On discovering the two court ladies in hiding, Michinaga demands a poem from each of them. Murasaki being frightened and helpless in this situation recites the following waka: :On the fiftieth day how should one number those that follow? :May the Prince's life span more than eight thousand years. Despite being drunk, Michinaga answered quickly with another poem: :O would I might live the life of a crane‚Äî :Then might I reckon the years of the Prince :Up to one thousand! which according to Murasaki's diary \\"came from his innermost desire\\". Based on the topic, this scene resembles the Azumaya edition of the Genji emaki where another court noble demands a response from a woman. This part of the scroll was designated Important Cultural Property on July 19, 1952. =Hinohara or former Hisamatsu scroll= Formerly in possession of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira clan, a branch of the Matsudaira clan and rulers of the Iyo-Matsuyama Domain, this scroll is now privately owned by the Hinohara family (Êó•ÈáéÂéüÂÆ∂). Due to this ancestral heritage it is variously referred to as \\"former Hisamatsu scroll\\" or \\"Hinohara scroll\\". The scroll is long and consists of alternatingly six sections of text and six associated paintings on 13 sheets of paper. The fourth text part is relatively long and has been split in two. The scroll has been designated as an Important Cultural Property of Japan. Day of the Bird festival Ukiyo-e reproduction of 1st painting Murasaki Shikibu tells of an anecdote at the festival of the Kamo Shrine held on Kank≈ç 5, 11th month, 28th day (December 28, 1008), the last .Last day of the Rooster in the 11th month. On this day, Fujiwara no Norimichi, son of Michinaga, had the role of the Emperor's substitute. After a night of merriment, a joke is played on the Naidaijin by making him believeThrough the content a characteristics of the present themselves. that a present he had received is directly from the Empress; thus requiring an open return. Murasaki Shikibu goes on to describe how noble and dignified Norimichi looked on that day and how his nurse was overwhelmed by his appearance. In a sacred dance performed at night, the mediocre performance of one dancer who had been \\"very handsome last year\\" reminded Murasaki Shikibu \\"of the fleeting life of us all\\". The illustration associated with this scene shows the Imperial Messenger, Fujiwara no Norimichi, his head decorated with wisteria branches on the top of a staircase of a shrine building. The train of his garment is flowing down the staircase and he is watched by three courtiers positioned near the bottom of the stairs.For an ukiyo-e reproduction of the painting see . Thinking of the first time at court Ukiyo-e reproduction of 2nd painting Set on the evening of Kank≈ç 5, 12th month, 29th day (January 27, 1009), in this scene, Murasaki Shikibu returns to the Imperial Court after a visit to her parents' home. As it is the anniversary of her coming to the court she is looking back at her former life nostalgically. Feeling lonely she goes to sleep murmuring the following waka: :My life and the year are closing together. :At the sound of the wind dreary is my heart. The painting following this text section shows a man on the stairs of a house and two men on a boat just outside the house. The illustration matching the scene described in the text is now the fifth painting of the Hachisuka scroll.For an ukiyo-e reproduction of the painting see . Incident at night All the night through, knocking louder than a water-rail, I stood in vain at the door of hinoki wood weary and lamenting. This scene from an unknown day in the year Kank≈ç 6 (1009) shows Murasaki asleep at night in a room close to the corridor; a man is knocking on the door. Afraid to open, she spends the night without making a sound. The next morning her nightly visitor reveals himself as Michinaga through a poem he sent to her. She replies with the lines: :A cause of deep regret, indeed, :Had the door opened at the knocking of the water- rail! 50th day celebration of Atsunaga-shinn≈ç Courtiers carrying food on the balconies of a building. Scenes four to six describe the 50th day celebration of the birth of Atsunaga-shinn≈ç, the later Emperor Go-Suzaku, on Kank≈ç 7, 1st month, 15th day (February 1, 1010). The lengthy fourth section of text is split into two parts. Murasaki Shikibu briefly mentions her friendly relationship with Lady Kokosho and that they join their rooms separating them by kich≈ç partitions only when both are at home. This behaviour made Michinaga believe that they are gossiping about other people. Murasaki Shikibu then describes the day's festivities: the Queen and her audience, the clothing, names and titles of the participants which included the Emperor, the infant prince and various court ladies. Dazzled in their presence, she escapes to an inner room. As the nurse, Madam Nakadaka comes away from the Emperor and Queen under the canopy, carrying the prince in her arms, Murasaki Shikibu praises her dignified demeanour, tranquility and earnestness. The painting associated with this scene shows four courtiers on the balcony (engawa) of a Japanese style building outside fabric enclosed rooms, which are not visible. Two of the men are shown walking, the others are kneeling and appear to be talking to a person inside the building or to be handing something to someone inside. Two of the men (one standing, one walking) carry trays with cups.For an ukiyo-e reproduction of the full painting see . For a recent reproduction of the full painting see this image . Ukiyo-e reproduction of 5th painting In the subsequent scene, the dais at which the main persons are seated, covered by misu, is opened and Murasaki Shikibu notes that the people present at the event and seated around the dais on the balcony were either of high rank or court ladies. Lower rank officials later joined them on the steps below where the royalty is seated to perform music with a lute (biwa), harp (koto) and flute (sh≈ç). The painting corresponding to this scene shows two ladies on the balcony with rolled up misu. Both are squeezed in the corner of the image and appear to be talking to each other.For an ukiyo-e reproduction of the painting see . Ukiyo-e reproduction of 6th painting A short text section follows, which is the final scene of the scroll and the final part of the known diary. The official musicians mentioned in the previous scene are joined by outsiders, one of which \\"made a mistake in the notes and was hissed\\". The Minister of the Right made a great mistake in praising the six-stringed koto. The emaki text (and diary) ends abruptly with mention of Michinaga's gift of flutes in two boxes. The illustration to this scene shows three courtiers seated in a row on the balcony with their backs facing the outside. The left figure is shown with a Japanese harp (koto) in front of him, his head is turned toward the other two who appear to be concentrating on something in front of them (likely instruments).

Jacono starred in the Discovery Fit & Health television program Facing Trauma, as the volunteer surgeon who reconstructed faces disfigured in abusive relationships and other violent circumstances.Maxine Shen (February 18, 2011). \\"Dr. Jacono faces 'Trauma'\\". New York Post. Retrieved October 4, 2019. He is the founder of the New York Center for Facial Plastic & Laser Surgery and the co-founder of T.H.A.I (Through Healing All Indigent) Children, a non-profit organization committed to helping impoverished children in third world countries receive free plastic surgery for their facial deformities.

Education After completing his undergraduate studies in chemistry at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Jacono earned his medical degree from the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. He completed an internship in general surgery at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center, after which he completed his surgical residency in head and neck surgery at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.

Typically the guild has included professional puppeteers, teachers, librarians, scout leaders, and other walks of life. Some members are performers who perform for small groups, others are professionals, and others are just people who like the art. Some members like to collect puppets, and have extensive collections of puppets from all over the world. The only common element is an appreciation of the art of puppetry.  Origins  The Puppet Guild of Greater Saint Louis, Inc. was founded largely through the efforts of Iona Hedges. She had attended the first Puppeteers of America Festival in 1936 and signed herself and Susan Barnes as charter members of that organization. In 1939 the Puppet Guild of St. Louis was formed, and dues were 10 cents. At that time, the main thrust of guild activity was to bring the Puppeteers of America National Festival to Saint Louis in 1940. However it did not actually happen until 1941. Those persons at the first meeting on June 12, 1939, at the home of Iona Hedges, 5445 Maple Avenue, in the City of St. Louis were as follows: (No listing of the charter members has been found. A transcript of a 1959 speech of Leona Thompson references 12 founding members instead of the listed 16 attendees.) * Miss Helen Addington * Mrs. Josephine Harrington * Miss Doritha Lancton * Mr. Joseph Peek * Miss Dorris/Dorothea Allen * Mrs. Iona Hodges * Miss Laverne Lockmueller * Miss Ruth Rubin * Miss Susan Barnes * Miss Margaret Johnson * Miss Nelly Mendham * Mrs. Beverly Stanford * Miss Elizabeth Green * Mr. David Kemmerer * Miss Sally O‚ÄôFallon * Miss Barbara Yore The first two meeting were held at the Hedge‚Äôs home. The third meeting was held on June 26, 1939, at the Cabanne Branch of the Saint Louis Public Library. It was at that meeting that Carolyn Meyer joined the guild and new officers were elected: Wendell Chilton, President; Ruth Rubin, office not specified; Doritha Lanctot, corresponding secretary; Robert Rowlson, office not specified. According to 1993 interviews with Carolyn Meyer and Susan Barnes, and the 1959 transcript, charter members of the Puppet Guild of Greater St. Louis were as follows: (Again the listing has 16 names not the 12 referred to in the 1959 transcript.) * Miss Helen Addington * Miss Louise Ewing * Miss Ruth Rubin * Mrs. Robert Rowlson * Mrs. Dorris Allen * Mrs. Edith Finney * Mrs. Ellen Proctor * Miss Sally O‚ÄôFallon * Miss Susan Barnes * Mrs. Iona A. Hedges * Mr. Romaine Proctor * Mr. Caroline Singleton * Mr. Wendell Chilton * Miss Doritha Lancton * Mr. Robert Rowlson * Miss Barbara Yore The guild grew and at the October 23, 1939, meeting, the guild had 27 paid members and a treasury of $24.25. At the March 25, 1940, meeting dues were raised to 50 cents. In the years since, the guild has been responsible for bringing many puppeteers from throughout the country to perform in Saint Louis. Among the eighteen charter members of the Puppeteers of America in 1938, Susan Barnes, Iona Hedges, and Ellen and Romaine Proctor were also members of the Puppet Guild of Greater Saint Louis.  Circa 1939-1964  The presidents of the guild were * 1939-40 Wendel Chilton * 1940-41 Carolyn Meyer * 1941-42 R. C.

A former amateur competitor at Toyo University, he made his professional debut in March 2004, reaching the top makuuchi division for the first time in March 2010. He has both a makushita and a j≈´ry≈ç division championship. His highest rank has been maegashira 9. He is one of the shortest wrestlers in professional sumo at . Early life and sumo background Isobe began practicing sumo as a fourth grader in Mishima City, his hometown. His father encouraged him to drink milk to try to increase his height. In his sixth year of primary school he won a national boys sumo tournament, earning the title of \\"young boy yokozuna\\" for this accomplishment. In junior high school as a representative for Shizuoka prefecture in a national tournament, he won both the team and individual competitions. In his second year of high school in 1998 he took the championship to take the high school yokozuna title. In his third year, he won a Kanazawa tournament and was chosen for a tournament expedition to China, which was also attended by many future stars in sumo. He defeated the future top makuuchi division wrestler Futeno, and also finished ahead of the future Asash≈çry≈´. He was a bronze medallist in the inaugural Junior World Sumo Championships in 1999. He went on to Toyo University where the future Kimurayama was his teammate. Career Joining Irumagawa stable in March 2004, he was below the official height requirement at just 166 cm but was accepted after passing a secondary examination. Initially fighting under his own surname of Isobe, he recovered from an elbow injury sustained in 2006 to reach the second highest j≈´ry≈ç division in November 2007. He was the second wrestler to pass the secondary height exam and reach juryo, following Toyonoshima. After changing his shikona to Sagatsukasa he initially remained near the bottom of j≈´ry≈ç and was demoted to makushita on several occasions. However he fought his way back and reached the top division in March 2010 after a 9‚Äì6 score at j≈´ry≈ç 1. He lasted only one tournament in makuuchi and a series of poor performances back in j≈´ry≈ç saw him demoted to makushita once again. Returning to j≈´ry≈ç in May 2011 he won the y≈´sh≈ç or championship with a 13‚Äì2 record and was promoted back to the top division. He lasted four tournaments at the top before being relegated to j≈´ry≈ç for the March 2012 tournament. After six tournament in the second division, the last two of which he achieved consecutive 9‚Äì6 records, he was promoted back to the top division for the March 2013 tournament. However, he was injured and missed the last seven days of the tournament and was again relegated. He only lasted one tournament in j≈´ry≈ç and dropped out of the salaried divisions back to makushita in July 2013 where he has remained, apart from one brief appearance in j≈´ry≈ç in March 2014. Fighting style Sagatsukasa's Sumo Association profile lists his favoured techniques as kuisagari, an unusual move employed by shorter wrestlers that involves pushing the head against the opponent's chest and grabbing the front part of the mawashi, oshi (pushing) and nage (throwing). His most common winning kimarite in his career to date have been oshi dashi (push out), hiki otoshi (pull down) and tsuki otoshi (thrust over). In September 2011 he defeated Tochinowaka with the spectacular ipponzeoi move, which had only been seen twice in the top division since 1974.

He excelled both on the track and in the breeding shed.Pedigreequery.com Retrieved on 2011-11-11 On the Track As a yearling, Glenelg was purchased by August Belmont for $2,000. Due to his size and temperament it was decided that he should not race as a two-year-old. To give him time to mature, he was not started until well into his three-year-old season, his first start being in the Belmont Stakes. Belmont wanted Glenelg‚Äôs stable-mate, Fenian, to win, so Glenelg was held back in second. He went on to the Jerome Stakes, beating Vespucius but lost to that colt a week later in the Annual Stakes. He then won the Travers Stakes and finished his three-year-old season with one more victory, giving him three wins and two seconds in five starts.

During his early years at stud, Glenelg performed poorly. He was later sold to Milton H. Sanford for $10,000 in a package deal along with two mares and improved his stud performance.

The book is a neo-slave narrative, incorporating many elements of traditional slave narratives. The book is divided into three sections: \\"The Darky\\", \\"The Wench\\" and \\"The Negress\\".Mildred R. Mickle, \\"\\"Dessa Rose\\", in William L. Andrews, Frances Smith Foster & Trudier Harris (eds), Oxford Companion to African American Literature, New York/Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997, pp. 210-211. The sections represent a different stage of growth in the life of the protagonist, Dessa Rose. Plot summary The book begins with Dessa Rose, a pregnant slave fugitive in a prison cell in Marengo County, Alabama. Captured along with many of her fellow runaways, Dessa's execution was postponed until the birth of her child. Shortly before she gives birth, three men appear at night and rescue her. The four travel to a small plantation in Sutton managed by Ruth Elizabeth. Her husband had departed on a business trip several years ago and never returned. The slaves took off and Mrs. Rufel (as everyone calls her) began harboring runaway slaves to replace them. The fugitives devise a plan to free themselves. Mrs. Rufel must sell the slaves during the day, then pick them back up at night, cheating the buyers out of their money. When the small band has accumulated enough money, the slaves will flee west. Historical context The book is based on two historical incidents. In 1829 a pregnant slave woman led a revolt against slave traders, and in 1830 a white woman had a habit of taking in runaway slaves. The book combines the two stories, with the two women meeting and participating in a plan to free the runaways. The novel was written as a response to William Styron's The Confessions of Nat Turner. The white man assuming the voice of an African-American man enraged the black community. In Dessa Rose, Sherley Anne Williams, a black woman takes the voice of a white woman. Film Adaptation Irwin Winkler was going to direct a film adaptation in 1988 starring Natasha Richardson, Angela Bassett, Donald Sutherland, Laurence Fishburne, and Cicely Tyson however the film was shut down by United Artists days before shooting with the studio writing off the $5 million cost.

It is native to Europe and Asia. It is present in North America as an introduced species and invasive weed. This plant is a perennial herb that may grow up to two to three meters in height. The erect, branching stem is hollow and prickly. The leaves are oppositely arranged, each leaf pair joined around the stem and clasping it, their bases forming a cup which often collects water. The species is monocarpic, living for multiple years but only flowering once before dying. The inflorescence is an egg-shaped head subtended by long bracts. The head may contain up to 1500 flowers. Each individual flower lasts one day. The middle of the head blooms first and then the upper and lower parts. The fruit is an achene just under a centimeter long.Gucker, Corey L. 2009.

This teasel may be distinguished from its relative, common teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) by flower color and leaf shape. Cutleaf teasel has white flowers and deeply cut leaves, while common teasel has purple flowers and toothed or wavy-edged leaves. Cutleaf teasel is a weed in the United States, where it is most prevalent in the Midwest and northeastern states. It has been known in New York and Michigan since before 1900. It is now a dominant species in some areas, such as a tallgrass prairie in Illinois. It grows in a variety of habitat types, and does best on good soil; individuals growing on fertile soil reach large, robust sizes. Due to a lack of biological control agents in areas such as the Midwest that it is not native to, it can form large monocultures, displacing native species. The plants can also tolerate saline soils. In August Two moths useful for biological control were tested in Slovakia in 2003-2004 (following the identification of seven insects associated with the plant and their consideration), including the monophagous Endothenia gentianaeana. Although Endothenia gentianaeana was able to be reared in high numbers and its presence was found in nearly 100% of teasel plants surveyed in Slovakia, and despite the high level of damage caused by the second moth, Cochylis roseana (which was not targeted by local parasitic wasps frequently as was Endothenia gentianaeana), the USDA has not approved either of these moths for introduction as of February 2018. Instead, the USDA continues to suggest the use of herbicidal chemicals. The mite Leipothrix dipsacivagus was also suggested as a possible biological control agent in 2007, based on research.Pecinar, I., et al. 2008.

Pure bending occurs only under a constant bending moment (M) since the shear force (V), which is equal to \\\\frac{dM}{dx} = V, has to be equal to zero. In reality, a state of pure bending does not practically exist, because such a state needs an absolutely weightless member. The state of pure bending is an approximation made to derive formulas.

Grasby was born at Balhannah in South Australia to Yorkshire-born farmer William Grasby and Frances, n√©e Catton. He was educated at home, and from the age of thirteen was a pupil- teacher. He travelled to Europe in 1881 and returned to Australia to teach in primary schools, founding the Payneham Boys' Field Club in 1887 and advocating reform in educational policies in South Australia. In 1891 he published Teaching in Three Continents, the result of two years' study of education in North America, Great Britain and Europe. He summarised his proposals in Our Public Schools, a polemic that advocated kindergartens, practical education, abolition of school fees, results-based wages for teachers and extended educational training. He edited the Educator (1893-94) for the duration of its publication. In 1892 he was appointed director of agronomy and manual training at Way College in Unley. From 1894 he taught at Roseworthy Agricultural College and was a member of the Central Bureau of Agriculture. He married Tasmanian Quaker Hannah Propsting on 13 October 1896. In 1897 he returned to teach at Way College and continued his involvement in agricultural circles. He established the journal Australian Garden and Field in 1896, which he edited until 1904. In 1887 and 1890 he had contested elections for the South Australian Parliament; in 1903 he stood for the Senate as an independent without success. In 1904 Grasby moved to Western Australia, being appointed agricultural editor of the Western Mail and the West Australian and writing highly popular weekly columns. He continued to teach agriculture, holding classes at Perth Technical School and Guildford Grammar School. His 1912 publication Principles of Australian Agriculture was an important textbook, and his strong support for tertiary education for Western Australia led to his appointment to the University of Western Australia's first senate in 1912. In 1911 he was involved in founding the Kindergarten Union. He and Charles Harper together developed the first wheat varieties to be grown exclusively in Western Australia. An early conservationist, he decried the hunting of animals for scientific collections. He retired from public life in 1928 and died at East Guildford in 1930 of diabetes and gangrene.

Marano worked for economic equity for women and low-income workers. She is a designated Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project, which described her as a \\"brilliant strategic thinker\\". Personal life and education Cindy Marano was born in Philadelphia in 1947. Her family moved frequently due to her father's work, and she attended nine different schools before she graduated high school. She was inspired by her 8th grade teacher and joined the Peace Corps in the 1960s, serving for two years in Ecuador. The work she did in Ecuador with poor women and children affected her deeply, and she would go on to establish a distribution network for the hand-woven goods the women made. She attended Northwestern University for two years. She went on to join the Peace Corps and served two years in Ecuador. She went on to George Mason University where she graduated in 1972 with a degree in English. At the time of her death in 2005 from adenoid cystic carcinoma she lived in Oakland, California. Professional career She lived in Washington, D.C. from 1969 until 1997. Upon arriving in Washington she was director of public affairs for the National Federation of Business and Professional Women until 1975. Starting in 1972 she served as director of the National Workforce Network and president of Wider Opportunities for Women. In Washington, testified before congressional committees and formed legislative proposals about job training, vocational education and welfare-to-work. At Wider Opportunities for Women she developed outreach for women to become involved in the construction trade and other jobs not often filled by women. She also worked to create women's literacy programs. Her work contributed to four federal laws, including the Nontraditional Employment for Women Act of 1992, which provided women access to training for related jobs. She also helped to develop the Family Economic Self-Sufficiency which is used by some U.S. states to determine living wages for families based on age and number of children and geographical location. Starting in 1988 she began advocating for affordable child care for working mothers, stating that educations, employers and politicians were \\"failing miserably at providing women a way out of poverty.\\" Marano also examined women's roles in media. In 1990 she spoke out against the lack of roles for women in television, showing concern about the consequences of young women not seeing themselves represented appropriately in programming. She left Washington in 1997 for California and started her own business, Marano and Associates, which developed strategies for helping low-income people move out of poverty. In 2001, she joined the National Economic Development and Law Center in Oakland. She would eventually serve as director of its National Network of Sector Partners project, which sought to improve economic development and employment opportunities for low-income people, families and communities. Marano founded the Washington-based Women Work! The National Network for Displaced Homemakers and the Older Women's League, the National Coalition on Women, Work and Welfare Reform, and the National Women's Vote Project. She served as vice chairwoman of Equal Rights Advocates and the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy. Marano also served on advisory commissions for three U.s. secretaries of labor and the Private Industry Council. She was awarded the Ms. Foundation for Women's Gloria Award for Women of Vision and the National Award for Women's Economic Justice. Marano also provided support to her community in Oakland, working with the Reconciling Program for the LGBT community at Lake Merritt Unified Methodist Church. She was a vocal activist within the Methodist Church about same-sex marriage. Legacy After her death in April 2005, a public memorial service was held in Oakland at Lake Merritt Unified Methodist Church. The Cindy Marano Memorial Fund was founded to support strategic and immediate actions and policies that can impact the lives of low-income people, specifically women. In 2005 the Sector Skills Academy, a program of the Aspen Institute, named their inaugural Academy class \\"Marano Fellows\\" as a tribute to Marano.

In June 2016, Bradley County Commissioner Dan Rawls handed over allegations and evidence of alleged improper and deceptive practices by Watson to the 10th Judicial District Attorney General Steve Crump's office, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney's Office. Allegations of misconduct included the selling of a county owned surveillance van to a Nashville bail bondsman underpriced, using his patrol vehicle to transport his wife to the county jail to write bonds for prisoners, assigning deputies to investigate the activities of his wife's bail bonding coworkers, and abuse of county credit cards and funds. In late 2016, the Tennessee Department of Revenue began investigating claims that Watson's side used car sales exceeded the legal limit. In Tennessee, a dealer's license is required to sell more than five motor vehicles per year, and Watson had a salesman's license. In July 2017, Watson was arrested and charged with six felony counts of altering and falsifying the titles of six vehicles. His charges were dismissed in January 2018. Personal life Watson is a member of the National Rifle Association, Southern Gospel Music Association, and Keep America Beautiful. He married Tenille Crabtree, a bail bondsman, in 2010. He has three stepchildren.

It is designated to house part of E. J. Ourso College of Business. The groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 19, 2010, the anticipated completion date of December 2011. The purpose of the BEC is to have the Business School located in one central area, thus creating a ‚Äúcampus within a campus‚Äù. The project is located on Nicholson Drive Extension next to Patrick F. Taylor Hall, formally known as Center for Engineering and Business Administration (CEBA), on LSU‚Äôs Baton Rouge campus. The BEC will consist of four buildings with approximately 156,385 square feet that will be used for undergraduate and graduate students attending Business College. It will also include a large public space for dining as well as faculty offices and offices for administration staff. One of the four buildings will house a large auditorium. Cost/Funding The budget for the Business Education Complex was $60 million. At a press conference in early November 2009, Louisiana‚Äôs Governor, Bobby Jindal, announced the state would commit $30 million in capital outlay funds for the new Business Education Complex. Michael V. Martin, Chancellor at Louisiana State University and A&M; College, commented that, ‚ÄúThe Business Education Complex is a visionary example of the investment of the state of Louisiana and private citizens working together with educational institutions to improve economic sustainability and workforce development for the future‚Äù &. Even with the State's $30 million and LSU privately raising $18 million there is a $12 million shortfall. To cover the shortfall LSU is planning to use an $8.1 million internal bridge loan that will be secured by LSU‚Äôs new revenue acquired from the Southeastern Conference‚Äôs deals with CBS and ESPN. The additional $4 million will come from the private LSU Foundation in anticipation of bequests made over the next two years. The complex is the first building on LSU‚Äôs campus that is a public- private partnership. Martin has stated with the favorable construction market he hopes the internal bridge loan of $8.1 million will not be needed. Design of Complex After presenting the lowest bid of $39,978,000, Lemoine / Brasfield & Gorrie was selected to construct the complex. Coleman Partners Architects designed the BEC with a blending of glass, metal and stone with sloped gabled roofs and arches in order to capture and reflect LSU‚Äôs Italianate architectural style. The complex will consist of four buildings surrounding a 14,000 square foot exterior quadrangle lined with covered galleries. The largest building is a four story, 56,000 square foot Rotunda. This building will be used for the Business School administration offices, and academic affairs. The ground floor will have the student‚Äôs common area, lobby and caf√© for the Business School and the community along with a Business Disaster Recovery Command Center. The second building is a two-story structure that will be the Undergraduate Pavilion, which will include classrooms, SMART Lab and faculty offices. The third building will be known as the Graduate Pavilion and will have classrooms, study rooms, team rooms and offices for faculty. The second floor of the Undergraduate and Graduate Pavilions will contain departmental offices for Management, Marketing, ISDS, Accounting, Economics and Finance, as well as Ph.D. suites. The fourth building will be the auditorium. This two-story, 12,600 square foot building can seat 300 people and will be used by the Business School and the community. The second floor of the Auditorium will have graduate classrooms and labs. Both Pavilions and the Auditorium will connect through covered archways on the first floor and enclosed walkways on the second floor.

The bill was sponsored by Sen. Ron Wyden and Rep. Jason Chaffetz. Since its initial proposal in June 2011, the GPS Act awaits consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee as well as the House. According to its proponents, the GPS Act sets forth \\"a legal framework designed to give government agencies, commercial entities and private citizens clear guidelines for when and how geolocation information can be accessed and used.\\" Advocates drafted the bill to address controversies surrounding prior incidents in which police had attached GPS devices to suspects' vehicles without warrants and to set a legal precedent for such tracking in the future. History Current legislation surrounding the issue of tracking an individual's location has proven to be legally ambiguous and technically outdated. To date, primary precedent draws from the 1983 ruling of United States v. Knotts (1983) and the contentious Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. In that case the court ruled that electronic \\"beepers\\" could be fairly used to track a suspect's vehicle without warrant, because the suspect in that case had willingly taken the device that was used to track them. Justice Rehnquist delivered the majority opinion that the monitoring of such \\"beeper\\" devices did not invade any individual's \\"legitimate expectation of privacy\\". As a person traveling on public streets is visible to the naked eye, the practice was thus upheld as neither a \\"search\\" nor a \\"seizure\\" under Fourth Amendment definitions. = United States v. Jones = One notable incident of warrantless GPS tracking in 2005 led to United States v. Jones, decided by the United States Supreme Court. In Jones the police obtained a warrant to attach a GPS device to the underside of the defendant's car but then violated the warrant's scope in both geography and in length of time. The Department of Justice (DOJ) defended the police's actions by contending that a warrant was unnecessary in the first place. It pointed to a two-decade precedent of warrantless GPS tracking. Roger L. Easton, the principal inventor of modern GPS technology, filed an amicus brief urging the court to renounce the DOJ's proposal.https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/10/gps-inventor-surveillance/ Roger L. Easton Urges Court to Reject Warrantless Tracking In reply, the U.S. Department of Justice argued that an individual has \\"no reasonable expectation of privacy\\" in his or her movements around public streets, and that legislation requiring certain standards for warrants would \\"severely impede\\" law enforcement officials in their work. During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia suggested that legislatures could create restraints on law enforcement officers that would prevent such tracking. The Supreme Court justices voted unanimously that the attachment of a GPS device on a vehicle and its monitoring, even on public streets, constituted a search under the Fourth Amendment. However, only four of the justices argued that the search violated reasonable expectations of privacy while the other five rested their conclusion on other grounds. The GPS Act would effectively endorse the minority's position and establish that geolocational searches are presumptively unreasonable. However, this ruling does not provide full protection from geolocational tracking methods, such as those used by telecommunication companies who reserve the right to collect geolocational information.  Contents  If passed, the GPS Act would require probable cause and an accompanying warrant before government agencies could obtain private geolocational information on an individual, either through a mobile device or by the placement of a tracking bug. Taking a strong stance on consumer rights, the bill would further forbid private businesses from sharing customer location data without explicit consent of the individual. The bill would cover real-time tracking data as well as previously acquired historical location data. The bill has set forth certain exceptions under which the acquisition of private tracking data by private or public entities would not be unlawful: * As a response to theft, and for the purpose of tracking stolen merchandise * As a personal safety net for children, as set forth by a parent or legal guardian * In the case of emergency, where the individual has either personally requested assistance or is in known peril * When the tracking information in question has been publicly broadcast Reception = Support = The bill was initially co-sponsored by Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition and the Internet. Since the bill's introduction, six other members of the House, as well as Senator Mark Kirk (R-IL). have signed on as co-sponsors. The bill has also gained support from a variety of civil liberties organizations including the ACLU, CCIA, Competitive Enterprise Institute, Digital Liberty Organization, and Electronic Frontier Foundation. Similar bills include one written by Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT), who aims to require a warrant to obtain GPS data from companies, and one by senators Al Franken (D-MN) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who would require device manufacturers to receive explicit consent from the end-user before tracking their location. In her concurrence in U.S. v Jones, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that the administration's defense of warrantless GPS tracking, if upheld, would allow federal agencies to track individuals through any cellular device, as law enforcement groups can also intercept signals the phones emit. =Opposition= The Obama Administration has expressed potential opposition to the GPS Act based on the belief that GPS tracking is no more invasive than visual surveillance.

Early life and education Nesbit was born at Angaston in South Australia to schoolmaster Edward Planta Nesbit and Ann, n√©e Pariss. He was a cousin of the English writer Edith Nesbit. His mother died when he was two. Something of a child prodigy, by the age of ten Nesbit could speak German, French and Latin, and had translated the works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller into English. Nesbit attended Rev. Gustav Rechner's school at Light's Pass and M. P. F. Basedow's grammar school at Tanunda, topping the scholarship examinations for South Australia; he also studied music with Carl Linger. In 1868, having worked briefly in a bank, he was articled as a clerk to Rupert Ingleby, QC. He formed the Articled Clerks' Debating Society with Charles Kingston and edited the organisation's journals; his political views developed in a progressive vein. Nesbit was called to the Bar in 1873 and embarked on a successful career in the courts. He married Ellen Logue on 9 December 1874 at St Paul's Anglican Church in Adelaide. In 1880 he joined in partnership with Rupert Ingleby and Eustace B. Gundy, which in 1883 admitted Rupert Pelly to form Grundy, Nesbit & Pelly; in 1884 Nesbit left the partnership. He drafted a number of parliamentary laws in the 1880s, and was appointed Queen's Counsel in 1893. In 1896 he formally changed his name to \\"Paris Nesbit\\"; he was widely acknowledged joint leader of the Bar with Josiah Symon. He had run without success for the South Australian House of Assembly in 1884, and later became a strong supporter of Federation. Nesbit's career was dogged by scandal, the first of which broke in 1885 when he was arrested for wilful trespass in Melbourne, apparently pursuing a lady who spurned him. He spent a week in Melbourne Gaol before being sent to Kew Lunatic Asylum, having been certified a lunatic. After several months he was released and sent back to South Australia, but on the steamer back to Adelaide he jumped overboard and swam back to Melbourne, where he was returned to the asylum. He began to acquire something of a reputation and was described in Adelaide gossip as an \\"absinthe-drinking, woman-loving, tobacco-enslaved ... Prince of Bohemia\\". He was a talented painter, a member of the Adelaide Easel Club, a Shakespeare scholar, and an engaging speaker. He was confined again in 1896 in Adelaide Lunatic Asylum, running in 1896 for the House of Assembly once more without success. He was now a firm opponent of Kingston. In Parkside Asylum from January to July 1898, the Kingston government illegally imposed a detention order to avoid his release but was overruled by the Supreme Court. After his release he published The Beaten Side, a tract against Darwinism, and in 1900, with his sister Agnes Benham, he launched Morning (renamed Morning Star in 1902), a weekly publication that championed Nesbit's causes. He contested Labor preselection for the 1906 federal election but was defeated, resigned from the Labor Party and defected to the Liberal Union, which he helped organise. The Liberals' views proved incompatible with his own, however, and at the 1910 election he contested Boothby as an independent. In 1915 he was confined again, briefly. After his estranged wife's death on 16 February 1921, he married his long-time mistress, actress and divorcee Cecilia Elizabeth Hughes, on 22 February. Nesbit died in 1927 of a perforated duodenal ulcer.

Stewart was born at Sebastopol to Scottish-born parents: miner John Stewart and Anne, n√©e Erskine. His father worked as caretaker of the botanical gardens in Creswick and he took numerous jobs in his youth. Active in the early labour movement, he struggled to find permanent employment after being placed on an employers' blacklist. On 25 June 1891 he married Mary Edwards at Fitzroy. He was a member of the Australian Workers' Union and was its delegate on the Ballarat Trades and Labor Council until 1910. He helped found the Ballarat branch of the Labor Party in 1902 and was its secretary from 1905 to 1906; he was involved in James Scullin's ultimately unsuccessful attempt to unseat Alfred Deakin at the 1906 federal election. In 1908 Stewart ran for the Victorian Legislative Assembly, standing unsuccessfully as the Labor candidate for Ballarat East. He was also narrowly defeated standing in 1910 and 1913 for the federal seat of Grampians. After the 1910 election he moved to Melbourne and was elected senior vice-president of the Political Labor Council, later taking on the secretaryship in 1911. In 1914 he was considered one of the \\"powers behind the throne\\" of Andrew Fisher's federal administration, and he was appointed the first secretary of the ALP's federal executive in 1915, serving until 1925. A staunch anti- conscriptionist, he organised opposition to Billy Hughes' conscription referenda in 1916-17 and avoided a second split over the socialist objective in 1919-21\\\\. In 1925 he died at his home in Sandringham of tuberculosis. A memorial tablet was unveiled at Stewart's grave in December 1926 by the then president of the Victorian branch of the ALP. Stewart is buried at Coburg Cemetery, Preston, Victoria.

Stirrup pants (or stirrup leggings) are a type of close-fitting ladies' pant that tapers at the ankle, similar to leggings, except that the material extends to a band, or strap, that is worn under the arch of the foot to hold the pant leg in place. The band of material is often elasticized to prevent the material around the foot from tearing. Stirrup pants were originally sportswear for women, and remain sportswear for horse riding and skiing. However, they have come in and out of fashion during the 20th and early 21st centuries, peaking in popularity as street fashion during the 1980s. History Stirrup pants were first worn as jodhpurs for horse riders. The purpose of the strap under the foot was to hold the pant legs in place in the boots of the rider. As ladies moved away from riding sidesaddle, they began wearing riding breeches in the 1920s in a similar style to those worn by men. By 1934, Jodhpurs as riding pants with foot straps were being advertised in the United States mail order catalogue for Sears. Horse riding breeches are still made with an elastic foot strap in some designs. Stirrup pants for skiing were introduced at the 1936 Winter Olympic Games in Germany. Stirrup stretch pants were a mainstay of ski wear for both men and women during most of the 1960s and part of the 1970s. In the 1960s this style was used for women's and girls' stirrup pants. They were popular for several years as shown in clothing catalogs of the day, such as J.C. Penny, Sears, and Montgomery Ward. Stirrup pants became a popular casual fashion for women in Europe and America from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s. In 1985, Linda Pender wrote in Cincinnati Magazine that stirrup pants were \\"being touted as the wardrobe basic of the year, and everybody is buying them\\". On the one hand, the style was promoted as being \\"easy to wear\\" and giving \\"most figures a long, lean line\\"; on the other hand, a salesclerk pointed out to Pender that the style was not flattering unless the wearer was \\"slim and fit\\". Leggings in general became fashionable streetwear during the 1980s, as did sweatshirts, leg warmers, and other items that originated in sports and dance studios.

She modeled for Victoria's Secret, appearing in the brand's annual fashion show from 2011 to 2018. She has also appeared in many of the brand's campaigns, especially for the sub-division PINK. In 2015, she was announced as one of 10 new Victoria's Secret Angels. She has also played professional basketball in Sweden. Career Growing up in Sweden, Hosk was presented with offers to model during high school after her father submitted photographs to various modeling agencies in Sweden when she was 13; she began modeling at 14. She did some modeling in high school but decided to primarily concentrate on her studies instead (she did some notable work with Guess and other companies however). After graduating, she decided to pursue a career in the Swedish women's basketball league. Hosk has commented that the level of play in the Swedish professional basketball league was not on par with the WNBA, and that interest in the sport was not as great in Sweden as in the United States. Although she ultimately abandoned professional basketball for modeling, Hosk has said that the intense rigor of practices (8 per week when playing basketball) and travel helped prepare her for the physical and travel demands of the modeling world. After playing professional basketball for two years, she began receiving many job offers and soon moved to New York City to begin modeling full-time. Some writers have speculated that her work with Victoria's Secret was what brought her into the top tier fashion world, but Hosk also identifies her work with photographer Ellen von Unwerth in campaigns for Guess. She is ranked 15th on the Top Sexiest Models list by models.com. She opened the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2016 and wore the Swarovski outfit in 2017. She was chosen to wear the \\"Dream Angels\\" Fantasy Bra in the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show held in New York City on 8 November 2018. The bra, worth $1 million, was designed by Atelier Swarovski and hand-set with 2,100 Swarovski created diamonds. She has walked for designers like Versace, Dior, Jean Paul Gaultier, YSL, Balmain, Moschino, Calvin Klein, Isabel Marant, Brandon Maxwell, LaQuan Smith, Valentino, Michael Kors, Miu Miu, Alberta Ferretti, Blumarine, Max Mara, Dolce&Gabbana;, Escada, Etro, Jeremy Scott and many more. Personal life Hosk is the daughter of Swedish father P√•l and Finnish mother Marja. She has two brothers. Her cousin, Alice Herbst, is also a model. Herbst won the televised competition of Sweden's Next Top Model in 2012. Hosk has worked to support the anti-human-trafficking organization, FAIR Girls. She became interested in the issue after seeing the movie The Whistleblower, which dealt with issues of sex trafficking. Though the media often notes her striking physical resemblance and nominal correlation to Queen Elsa from Disney's 2013 film Frozen, she denies that the character was made in her image. Since the beginning of 2015, she has a relationship with a British businessman Tom Daly. In September 2020, they revealed that they are expecting their first child.

Johnson studied architecture in Paris and then attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, graduating in 1910 and returned to Pasadena. His father would consecrate St. Paul's Cathedral in Los Angeles in 1924, designed by Reginald. Johnson made a good living in the 1920s designing houses in Montecito and Pasadena. Johnson made his name by designing houses for the rich, but also designed more affordable housing, a cause that assumed greater importance to him as the Great Depression wore on. In 1931 Johnson won an award for best design for a small house, receiving the award from Herbert Hoover. Johnson designed Rancho San Pedro for Los Angeles as a public housing project in 1939. Through the 1930s Johnson worked on the design of Baldwin Hills Village in Los Angeles, which was designed as an up-to-date community of inexpensive housing.

While having little effect on the culture of the city except to spur further growth, it would provide a temporal reference point for the remainder of the century and beyond. Background View of Pittsburgh as seen from the Ohio River before the Great Fire, from William Coventry Wall's print, Great Conflagration at Pittsburgh. The pollution that would be a contributing factor is evident. The city of Pittsburgh originated in the mid-18th century as a French military settlement at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers. It remained relatively small through the end of that century, but the 19th century brought rapid growth of a population made up of natives of English, Scottish, and German descent, as well as large numbers of immigrants. By 1845, its population topped 20,000Hoffer, p. 64 and was swelled by crews completing the new Pennsylvania Canal. The city‚Äôs growth had been haphazard, resulting in a patchwork of the rich homes and businesses of the city fathers intermingled with tightly packed abutting wooden structures housing its largely-immigrant labor force.Hoffer, pp. 71‚Äì72 Its outstripped infrastructure provided poor water pressure and an insufficient volume to its ten ill-equipped volunteer fire companies,Hoffer, p. 73 which were more social clubs than effective public service organizations. The year before, the city had completed a new reservoir, but had then closed the old one.Cook, p. 127 However, the water lines and pumpers were inadequate. There were just two water mains for the entire city, and the fire companies had insufficient hose to reach the center of the city from the rivers, most of the existing hose having been condemned.Cook, pp. 127‚Äì128 Iron manufacturing had developed in the city, and had come to represent a quarter of its industrial output.Hoffer, p. 68 The furnaces driving Pittsburgh‚Äôs iron and glass industries had filled the air with coal dust and soot, as an 1823 observer reported, coating the walls and leaving the men working in the streets \\"as black as Satan himself,\\"Hoffer, pp. 66, 70Adams, p. 19 while the British author, Charles Dickens, had written in 1842 that the city had a \\"great quantity of smoke hanging over it.\\"Hoffer, p. 70 Other industries released flour dust and cotton fibers into the air, contributing to a particularly incendiary mix of dust to settle on the city.Hoffer, p. 69 In addition, the seasonal weather had deprived the city of rain for six weeks, leaving the reservoir \\"dangerously low,\\" while frequent near-gale-force winds from the west hit the city at mid- day.Cook, pp. 128‚Äì129 These conditions left Pittsburgh primed for the disaster that would strike in 1845. Conflagration Detail from Nathaniel Currier print, Great Conflagration at Pittsburgh, Pa The dawn of April 10, 1845, brought a warm, windy day. During a brief interlude in the winds just before noon, Ann Brooks, who worked on Ferry Street for Colonel William Diehl, left unattended a newly stoked fire lit to heat wash water.Cook, pp. 129‚Äì130 A spark from this fire ignited a nearby ice shed or barn.Cook, p. 130 The fire companies responded, but got nothing but \\"a weak, sickly stream of muddy water\\" from their hoses, and the flames quickly spread to several buildings owned by Colonel Diehl, including his home, and to the Globe Cotton Factory.Hoffer, p. 77Adams, p. 19-20Cook, p. 133 The bells of the Third Presbyterian Church had given the original alarm, but the church itself was only preserved by dropping its burning wooden cornice into the street. Once saved, its stone walls served as a barrier to the further spread of the fire toward the north and west.Hoffer, p. 77-78Adams, p. 20Cook, p. 133-135 Then the wind veered to the southeast and gave the fire added vigor; a witness stated that \\"the roar of the flames was terrific, and their horrible glare, as they leaped through the dense black clouds of smoke, sweeping earth and sky, was appalling.\\" By 2:00 pm, with the fire throwing embers into the air that then started new fires where they landed, many of the citizens who had been fighting the flames instead fled to save their own possessions.Adams, p. 21-22 During its height, between 2:00 and 4:00, the fire marched block by block through the intermixed structures of Pittsburgh's poor and elite, residences and businesses, with \\"the loftiest buildings melting before the ocean of flame,\\" which consumed wood, melted metal and glass, and collapsed stone and brick. The Bank of Pittsburgh, thought to be fireproof, fell victim when the heat of the fire shattered the windows and melted the zinc roof, the molten metal igniting the wooden interior and burning all except the contents of the vault.Hoffer, p. 78Cook, p. 136 A similar fate met the grand Monongahela House, called the \\"finest Hotel in the west,\\" when its cupola caught fire and collapsed within, resulting in a total loss. The mayor‚Äôs offices and churches fell. As it spread up Second Street to Market Street it destroyed the region where the city‚Äôs physicians had been concentrated. Detail from an 1845 James Baillie print Great Conflagration at Pittsburgh, Pa Although the flames were intense, they moved slowly enough that residents had time to remove themselves and many of their belongings. Some fled to the highlands to the east (the modern Hill District), then undeveloped except for the newly built courthouse, an area which remained untouched by the flames.Hoffer, p. 82 Of those who fled south to the Monongahela River, some were able to cross the Monongahela Bridge (located at the site of the present Smithfield Street Bridge), which connected the city to the southern bank of the river and was the first of what would be many bridges spanning Pittsburgh‚Äôs rivers. However, this soon became congested, and then the wood-covered structure ignited, being fully consumed in about 15 minutes and leaving nothing but its supporting pylons.Adams, p. 22 Those counting on riverboats to take their belongings away fared less well because the boats that did not flee burned, leaving the refugees to pile their belongings on the riverbank.Hoffer, p. 79Adams, p. 21 Most of this material was burned by the advancing flames, stolen or looted, while the escaping population was typically left with nothing more than they could carry.Hoffer, p. 80Cook, pp. 136‚Äì137 The docks and warehouses on the waterfront were likewise consumed, and as with the residences, attempts to save materials from the warehouses by bringing them to the riverbank only delayed their destruction.Adams, pp. 21, 25 The fire followed the river into Pipetown, an area of workers' housing and factories, again spreading destruction.Adams, p. 23 It only halted when the winds died down about 6:00, and by 7:00 it had fully abated within the city, having burned its way to the river and cooler hills. The factories of Pipetown burned on until about 9:00. Throughout the night, there were occasional flare-ups along with the repeated sounds of buildings collapsing.Hoffer, pp. 81, 83Cook, p. 137 Fighting the fire Map of Pittsburgh and vicinity, 1845, from Foster, A Full Account of The Great Fire at Pittsburgh The burgeoning fire companies of the city found themselves overwhelmed. In a city flanked by rivers, their equipment and infrastructure were insufficient to bring water to the site of the blaze. The volunteer companies, which functioned more as gentlemen's clubs than professional firefighting organizations, lost most of their hoses and two of their engines in the blaze.Adams, p. 24For an account of the fire through the perspective of the fire companies, see Dawson, particularly pp. 270‚Äì280 Help also came from individual volunteers. While the vessels on the Monongahela fled the city, those on the Allegheny side, to the north, were active in ferrying refugees across the river and bringing back men from Allegheny City to help fight the flames and evacuate residents. Among those crossing to help was a young Stephen Foster, who would later become known as the 'father of American music'. Congregation members rushed to save the Third Presbyterian Church. The thirteen-year-old John R. Banks went to the roof of the Western University of Pennsylvania (forerunner of the University of Pittsburgh) in an attempt to prevent it from being ignited by the falling cinders. However, as described by a witness, \\"the cupola of the University burnt for a few minutes like paper and went down.\\"Dawson, p, 276 The home of the University president was also lost.Hoffer, p. 91Adams, pp. 20, 23 Others went into the evacuating areas to loot the abandoned homes and goods left in the streets. One hotel was saved within the burned area by using gunpowder to blow up the adjacent structures, creating a gap that the flames did not cross. Aftermath Pittsburgh After the Great Fire, by William Coventry Wall, the painting which served as the basis for his print By the morning of April 11, a third of the city was burned to the ground, leaving only scattered chimneys and walls amid the ruins,Cook, pp. 139‚Äì140 although occasional buildings were inexplicably left untouched amid the destruction. It was said that \\"the best half of the city\\" had been burned,Hoffer, p. 81 an area representing 60 acres, and the entire Second Ward of the city had just two or three dwellings untouched.Adams, p. 25 Local artist William Coventry Wall captured this landscape in a series of paintings which he quickly had printed as a lithograph.Cook, p. 148 This was published in Philadelphia and saw a broad market, as did prints by Nathaniel Currier in Boston and James Baillie in New York (both of whom based their works on newspaper reports), in line with a growing market for \\"disaster prints.\\" The fire destroyed as many as 1200 buildings, while displacing 2000 families, or about 12,000 individuals, from their homes.Cook, pp. 137‚Äì138 Household belongings were piled on the hills surrounding the city. Surprisingly, only two people died. One was lawyer Samuel Kingston, who was thought to have returned to his house to rescue a piano but apparently lost his bearings in the heat and smoke, since his body was found in the basement of a neighbor's destroyed house. The other body was not found until weeks later, and is thought to be that of a Mrs. Maglone, whose family had advertised not having seen her since the fire.Cook, p. 145-146 Estimates of the cost range from $5 to $25 million,Adams, p. 26 with one recent author placing it at $12,000,000, which he equated to $267 million in 2006 dollars. Almost none of this was recoverable, as all but one of Pittsburgh's insurers were bankrupted by the disaster.Cook, p. 141 Views of Pittsburgh the day after the Great Fire. Detail from William Coventry Wall's print, Great Conflagration at Pittsburgh. Local ministers declared the disaster to be the judgment of God upon the iniquities of the industrial city and the mayor of neighboring Allegheny City called for fasting, humiliation and prayer.Hoffer, pp. 86‚Äì87Cook, pp. 131‚Äì132 The mayor and attorney Wilson McCandless personally traveled to the state capitol of Harrisburg to appeal for relief, and their petition was supported by Governor Francis R. Shunk.Cook, p. 146, who misnames the Mayor as the long-dead John Darragh. The Legislature agreed to grant the city $50,000, to refund taxes for destroyed structures, and to give the entire city a three-year break from taxes. The latter had an unanticipated disadvantage, forcing public schools to remain closed for want of funding, while the Legislature subsequently made attempts to renege on some of the relief money they had granted.Hoffer, p. 94 Public and private donations totaling almost $200,000 were received from as far away as Louisiana and even Europe, while several cities and towns in the United States, such as Wheeling and Meadville, Pennsylvania, made donations of commodities such as flour, bacon, potatoes and sauerkraut.Adams, p. 28Cook, p. 147 The moneys were distributed on a sliding scale to those making claims, the last being disbursed the following July. The first response of the city was one of despair, as can be seen in reports to newspapers in other cities and in initial descriptions: > It is impossible for any one, although a spectator of the dreaded scene of > destruction which presented to the eyes of our citizens on the memorable > tenth of April, to give more than a faint idea of the terrible overwhelming > calamity which then befell our city, destroying in a few hours the labor of > many years, and blasting suddenly the cherished hopes of hundreds ‚Äì we may > say thousands ‚Äì of our citizens, who, but that morning were contented in the > possession of comfortable homes and busy workshops. The blow was so sudden > and unexpected as to unnerve the most self possessed.Cook, p. 143 B. F. Smith lithograph of Pittsburgh viewed from Coal Hill, 1849, showing the recovering city However, this mood did not last long and the city was shortly rebuilding.Cook, pp. 142‚Äì143 The sudden dearth of structures resulted in skyrocketing property values and a coordinate construction boom that quickly replaced many of the destroyed structures, and after two months, even though \\"passways [were] scarcely opened through the heaps of stone, brick and iron,\\"Dawson, p. 277 400‚Äì500 new buildings had been erected in the burned area.Hoffer, pp. 95, 99Cook, p. 139 Although the new homes, warehouses and shops were built of better materials and improved architecture compared to those destroyed, the problems remained, with industrialist Andrew Carnegie commenting in 1848 on the fire-prone wooden buildings, and later on the smoke and soot-filled air.Hoffer, p. 96 The market for replacement homes and household articles further invigorated the industries, and the fire was held to have \\"spurred the city to greater growth,\\" an attitude encouraged by Pittsburgh's industrialists.Hoffer, pp. 89, 101 This role of the fire was commemorated a century later with a celebration of the anniversary.Hoffer, p. 102 Historical markers On the building at 411 Smithfield Street, between Fourth Avenue and Forbes Avenue, is a stone historical marker saying \\"These buildings form the bordering line of the burnt district of April 10th, 1845.\\" See also *Great Chicago Fire *Great Fire of London ‚Äì 1666 *Great Fire of Toronto (1849) *Great Toronto Fire ‚Äì 1904 References Sources   Category:History of Pittsburgh Category:1845 in Pennsylvania Category:Fires in Pennsylvania Category:Urban fires in the United States Category:Disasters in Pennsylvania ","title":"Great Fire of Pittsburgh"},{"id":"33719410","text":"Long Branch is an unincorporated community in Wyoming County, West Virginia, United States.

He was an adoptive son of Jin's first prince Li Keyong and later served in a number of major campaigns under the reign of Li Keyong's son (Li Cunshen's adoptive brother) Li Cunxu, helping Li Cunxu to establish Later Tang as its Emperor Zhuangzong.  Background  Fu Cun was born in 862, during the reign of Emperor Yizong of Tang. His family was from Wanqiu (ÂÆõ‰∏ò, in modern Zhoukou, Henan), and his father Fu Chu () was an officer for the army of Chen Prefecture (Èô≥Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian, Henan), which Wanqiu was a part of. When he was young, there was an occasion when he was to be executed for an offense, and he asked to be buried under a part of the city wall that had tilted, so that his body would not be uncovered. The executioner agreed and was set to move his execution to just next to the city wall to facilitate the burial. However, at that time, a high-level officer was holding a feast and sitting with his favorite servant girl; the officer wanted someone to sing for them during the feast, and the servant girl, who was acquainted with Fu, stated, \\"Fu Cun often sang for me, and he sang well.\\" The officer sent a messenger to summon Fu, and Fu, with the execution having been moved, was not yet executed. Fu sang well at the feast, and was spared.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 25.

Late in the Qianfu era (874-879) of Emperor Yizong's son and successor Emperor Xizong, the Tang realm was overrun by agrarian rebels, and Fu led a group of locals in defending the prefecture. Later, when Li Hanzhi, who was also from Chen Prefecture and who had been an agrarian rebel, became a Tang general and was made the prefect of Guang Prefecture (ÂÖâÂ∑û, in modern Xinyang, Henan), Fu went to join Li Hanzhi's army. Later, when Li Hanzhi was pressured by the renegade general Qin Zongquan, who had declared himself emperor of a new state centered around nearby Cai Prefecture (Ëî°Â∑û, in modern Zhumadian), Li Hanzhi abandoned Guang Prefecture and joined the army of Zhuge Shuang the military governor (Jiedushi) of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan), and Fu followed him to serve as a minor officer at Heyang; Fu subsequently distinguished himself in battles against Qin's army. After Zhuge's death, Li Hanzhi was forced by Zhuge's other subordinates to become the defender of Huai Prefecture (Êá∑Â∑û, in modern Luoyang, Henan) and Li Hanzhi's soldiers were distributed. Fu thereafter went to the domain of Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) instead. Li Keyong adopted him as a son and changed his name to Li Cunshen; he became a commander of the wing of Li Keyong's army that Li Keyong put his adoptive sons in charge of.  Service under Li Keyong  As Li Cunshen served under Li Keyong, he was said to draw more and more of Li Keyong's favor due to his bravery in battle and his careful speaking. He often accompanied Li Keyong on his campaigns and distinguished himself during them. During the campaign against Helian Duo, for example, he fought hard and suffered a number of wounds, which Li Keyong personally attended to. During Li Keyong's 894 campaign against Li Kuangchou the military governor of Lulong Circuit (ÁõßÈæç, headquartered in modern Beijing), Li Keyong deployed the tactic of facing Li Kuangchou's army headfirst himself, while having Li Cunshen circle around and attack Li Kuangchou's army in the back, leading to a rout of Li Kuangchou's army and Li Kuangchou's subsequent flight and death.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. In 895, when Li Keyong, under the directives of Emperor Xizong's brother and successor Emperor Zhaozong, attacked Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Li Cunshen was instrumental in defeating Jingnan's elite troops and capturing Longquan (ÈæçÊ≥âÂØ®, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), leading to Wang's subsequent defeat and death. After the battle, Li Cunshen was given the honorary title of acting Zuo Pushe (). In a subsequent campaign between Li Keyong and Li Keyong's archrival Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) (after Li Hanzhi, who was by that point serving under Li Keyong as well, had seized Zhaoyi Circuit (Êò≠Áæ©, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), turned against Li Keyong, and submitted to Zhu), Li Cunshen defeated the Xuanwu general He Delun ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 901, when Zhu launched a major attack on Li Keyong and nearly captured Hedong's capital Taiyuan Municipality, Li Keyong's subordinate Li Tang () the prefect of Fen Prefecture (Ê±æÂ∑û, in modern L√ºliang, Shanxi) surrendered Fen Prefecture to Zhu; after Zhu's subsequent withdrawal, Li Keyong sent Li Cunshen to attack Li Tang; Li Cunshen took Fen in three days, capturing and executing Li Tang.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. He was then made the commander of Li Keyong's infantry guards. In 903, when Wang Jinghui (), an officer at Yun Prefecture (Èõ≤Â∑û, in modern Datong, Shanxi), killed Yun's prefect Liu Zaili () and submitted to Liu Rengong the military governor of Lulong (who had been a vassal of Li Keyong's but who had by that point turned against Li Keyong), Li Keyong sent his nephew Li Sizhao and Li Cunshen to attack Wang. When Liu subsequently came to Wang's aid, however, Wang was able to escape; angry over Wang's escape. Li Keyong caned both Li Sizhao and Li Cunshen and stripped them of their posts.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. However, the posts appeared to have been subsequently restored, as in 906, Li Sizhao and Li Cunshen were the ones attacking Zhaoyi (which had been taken by Zhu's subordinate Ding Hui) and who accepted Ding's surrender (as Ding had by that point become disaffected with Zhu due to Zhu's assassination of Emperor Zhaozong in 905) ‚Äî by this point, Li Cunshen was apparently the deputy commander of all Han and non-Han cavalry and infantry forces directly under Li Keyong, with Li Sizhao serving as the commander of all Han and non-Han cavalry and infantry forces.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. In 907, Zhu forced Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu. Li Keyong, who carried the Tang-bestowed title of Prince of Jin, refused to recognize the new Later Liang emperor (as did several other major warlords ‚Äî Yang Wo the Prince of Hongnong, Li Maozhen the Prince of Qi, and Wang Jian the Prince of Shu) and continued to use the Tang era name Tianyou. In effect, however, he was the ruler of his own state of Jin by this point. In 908, Li Keyong died and was succeeded by his son Li Cunxu as the Prince of Jin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Li Cunshen continued to serve under Li Cunxu.  Service under Li Cunxu  = During Jin = One of the first crises that Li Cunxu had to deal with was the siege that Later Liang forces were conducting against Zhaoyi's capital Lu Prefecture (), defended by Li Sizhao. Li Cunxu himself and Zhou Dewei commanded the subsequent successful relief mission to Lu, and Li Cunshen served under Zhou during the battle. After the battle, he was given the honorary title of acting Situ (Âè∏Âæí, one of the Three Excellencies), and made the prefect of Xin Prefecture (ÂøªÂ∑û, in modern Xinzhou, Shanxi) and the commander of all Han and non-Han cavalry and infantry forces. In 910, he was made acting Taibao () and the deputy overseer of all Han and non-Han. That year, when Li Cunxu himself went to the rescue of the former Later Liang vassal Wang Rong the Prince of Zhao, who was under attack by Later Liang forces, he put Li Cunshen in charge of Taiyuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267. After defeating Later Liang forces, Li Cunxu put Li Cunshen in charge of the defense of the new southeastern border between Jin/Zhao and Later Liang, stationed at Zhao Prefecture (Ë∂ôÂ∑û, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei). In 912, when Li Cunxu sent Zhou to attack Liu Rengong's son and successor Liu Shouguang ‚Äî who had declared himself the emperor of a new state of Yan ‚Äî Later Liang's Emperor Taizu decided to try to come to Liu Shouguang's rescue by attacking Jin and Zhao from the south. Li Cunshen, whose forces were far outnumbered by Later Liang forces under Emperor Taizu himself and his general Yang Shihou, tricked the Later Liang forces by dividing his troops into multiple groups, commanded by himself, Shi Jiantang (), and Li Sigong (ÊùéÂó£ËÇ±, another adoptive son of Li Keyong's), eventually misleading Emperor Taizu into believing Li Cunxu and the main Jin forces were at the front and that he was nearing defeat, causing him to withdraw in a panic and ending his attempt to save Yan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. As a result of this victory, Li Cunshen was made the military prefect (ÂúòÁ∑¥‰Ωø, Tuanlianshi) of Xin (ÈÇ¢Â∑û, in modern Xingtai, Hebei), Ming (Ê¥∫Â∑û, in modern Handan, Hebei), and Ci (Á£ÅÂ∑û, also in modern Handan) Prefectures (which were not yet under Jin control at that time). Later, at Li Cunxu's direction, Li Cunshen took his ethnic Tuyuhun and Qibi () cavalry soldiers to reinforce Zhou's troops. (Without Later Liang aid, Yan eventually fell in 913.) Late in 912, Later Liang's Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, and Zhu Yougui took over the throne (after claiming that instead, it was his adoptive brother Zhu Youwen the Prince of Bo who had carried out the assassination but who had been executed). The Later Liang military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Zhu Youqian, did not believe Zhu Yougui and resisted Zhu Yougui's subsequent summons to the capital Luoyang. When Zhu Yougui subsequently sent the generals Kang Huaizhen () and Niu Cunjie () to attack Zhu Youqian, Zhu Youqian submitted to Jin and requested immediate aid. Li Cunxu sent Li Cunshen, Li Sigong, and Li Si'en (ÊùéÂó£ÊÅ©, another adoptive son of Li Keyong's) to aid Zhu Youqian; they had some victories over Later Liang forces, and after Li Cunxu himself joined them, Later Liang forces withdrew from Huguo. In 915, by which time Zhu Yougui had been killed and replaced by his brother Zhu Zhen, Yang, who had been the military governor of the powerful Tianxiong Circuit (Â§©ÈõÑ, headquartered in modern Handan, also known as Weibo (), died. Zhu Zhen, believing that the Weibo army was difficult to control and needed to have its influence reduced, divided Tianxiong into two circuits, with three of its six prefectures, including Tianxiong's capital Wei Prefecture (), governed by He Delun, and with the other prefectures made into a new Zhaode Circuit (), headquartered at Xiang Prefecture (Áõ∏Â∑û, in modern Anyang, Henan), with Zhang Yun () as its military governor. The Tianxiong forces did not want to be divided, and they mutinied under the leadership of Zhang Yan (), kidnapping He Delun and forcing him to submit to Jin. Hearing of what happened at Tianxiong, Li Cunxu proceeded quickly toward Wei Prefecture, joining forces with Li Cunshen to Linqing (Ëá®Ê∏Ö, in modern Lintai). Li Cunxu subsequently entered Wei Prefecture and took over the military governorship of Tianxiong himself. Li Cunshen engaged in several subsequent major battles with the Later Liang general Liu Xun, who was trying to recapture Tianxiong, defeating Liu (along with Li Siyuan and Li Cunxu himself). After the Yan Bao (), the Later Liang military governor of Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered at Xing Prefecture) subsequently surrendered the circuit, Li Cunxu made Li Cunshen the military governor of a new Anguo Circuit, headquartered at Xing Prefecture. After the Later Liang military governor of Shunhua Circuit (È†ÜÂåñ, headquartered in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), Dai Siyuan subsequently abandoned Shunhua, Li Cunxu made Li Cunshen the military governor of Henghai Circuit (Ê©´Êµ∑, i.e., Shunhua, which was originally named Henghai during Tang times). By this point, Jin had taken all of Later Liang territory north of the Yellow River except for the city of Liyang (ÈªéÈôΩ, in modern Hebi, Henan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. Li Cunxu subsequently bestowed the honorary chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () on Li Cunshen. The Jin victories were then tempered by the news, in 917, that Khitan's Emperor Taizu (Yel√º Abaoji) had launched a major attack on Lulong's capital You Prefecture (), putting Zhou under siege inside the city. Li Cunxu originally hesitated at launching an army to save Zhou, given that the Yellow River border with Later Liang was a new one and Later Liang forces were still in the vicinity. It was at the urging of Li Cunshen, Li Siyuan, and Yan that he decided to send them north to confront Khitan forces. They defeated Khitan forces near You Prefecture and forced them to flee, lifting the siege on You Prefecture. (Still, it was said that this Khitan incursion dealt a heavy blow to Lulong Circuit, which from this point on was periodically subject to damaging Khitan incursions.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. In late 918, Li Cunxu decided to, against Zhou's advice, launch a major attack across the Yellow River against Later Liang's capital Daliang itself. In a subsequent battle at Huliu Slope (ËÉ°Êü≥ÈôÇ, in modern Heze, Shandong), Jin forces were initially routed and suffered heavy damage (with Zhou killed in the battle), although it subsequently recovered somewhat and dealt heavy damage to Later Liang forces as well, avoiding a complete disaster. After Zhou's death, Li Cunxu transferred Zhou's title as the overseer of all Han and non-Han to Li Cunshen. In 920, when Liu Xun was attacking Huguo, Li Cunxu sent Li Cunshen, Li Sizhao, Li Jianji (), and Li Cunxian (ÊùéÂ≠òË≥¢, another adoptive son of Li Keyong's)While the Zizhi Tongjian called this individual Li Cunzhi, the real Li Cunzhi was already dead in 908. The description of Cizhou prefect (ÊÖàÂ∑ûÂà∫Âè≤) matches that of another adopted son, Li Cunxian, perfectly. to aid Zhu Youqian. They were successful in repelling Liu. (On this mission, Li Cunshen made an incursion into Later Liang territory as far as the Guanzhong region and offered tributes to the tombs of the Tang emperors before withdrawing.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In 921, Wang Rong was assassinated by his adoptive son Wang Deming, who took over the Zhao realms, changed his name back to the original name of Zhang Wenli, and slaughtered the Wang clan. Li Cunxu subsequently prepared for a campaign against Zhang Wenli (who soon died and was succeeded by his son Zhang Chujin). As part of his preparation, he had Li Cunshen and Li Siyuan stationed at Desheng (Âæ∑Âãù, in modern Puyang, Henan) and Qicheng (ÊàöÂüé, in modern Puyang as well) respectively and then pretended to withdraw to lure Later Liang forces under Dai. When Dai attacked, Li Cunxu himself (along with Li Siyuan and Li Cunshen) defeated him. This victory allowed Li Cunxu himself to leave the front and go to the Zhao front himself. In 922, Dai, hearing that Li Cunxu had left to siege Zhao's capital Zhen Prefecture (), launched another major attack on Desheng. Li Cunshen defended the city, and Dai was unable to capture it. Li Cunxu subsequently came to his aid, and Dai withdrew. Zhang Chujin's mutineers turned out to be much more challenging to defeat than Li Cunxu anticipated, with several successive Jin commanders of the siege (Yan, Li Sizhao, and Li Cunjin (another adoptive son of Li Keyong's)) either defeated or killed in battle during the siege. In fall 922, Li Cunxu made Li Cunshen the overall commander of the Zhen operations. Zhang Chujin's officer Li Zaifeng () opened the city gates and welcomed Jin forces in, allowing Li Cunshen to capture it, putting Zhang Chujin and his brothers to death. For this victory, Li Cunshen received the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong (). In 923, when Khitan was again attacking You Prefecture, Li Cunxu, at the suggestion of his chief of staff Guo Chongtao, despite the fact that Li Cunshen was ill at the time, made Li Cunshen the military governor of Lulong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. = During Later Tang = Shortly after Li Cunshen was commissioned as the military governor of Lulong, Li Cunxu declared himself emperor, as the successor to Tang, establishing Later Tang as its Emperor Zhuangzong. He gave Li Cunshen the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (). Later in the year, he launched a surprise attack on Daliang after defeating and capturing the Later Liang general Wang Yanzhang, whose defeat left Daliang defenseless. Zhu Zhen committed suicide, ending Later Liang and allowing Later Tang to take over the rest of Later Liang territory. Meanwhile, Li Cunshen was distressed that, despite being the most senior among Later Tang generals, he was the only main one who did not participate in the conquest of the Later Liang capital. He repeatedly requested to get a chance to pay homage to Emperor Zhuangzong again, including making the requests through his wife Lady Guo, but Guo Chongtao, who was jealous of Li Cunshen, repeatedly had the requests suppressed. Only in spring 924, when Li Cunshen was seriously ill, was the request approved, along with a new commission as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit. Before Li Cunshen could leave Lulong, however, his illness grew worse, and he died at You Prefecture. Emperor Zhuangzong gave him posthumous honors and, per his dying request, had him buried at Taiyuan. It was said that Li Cunshen often warned his sons not to take their high status for granted, pointing out to them that he grew up in a low social station and had to fight his way to the top, stating that arrows had to be removed from his body more than 100 times ‚Äî and showing them the arrowheads, which he had preserved, as proof. Several of his sons became important generals, including Fu Yanqing, whose honored status persisted to the early Song Dynasty.

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on December 4, 2011. In the episode, Peter Griffin and his friends Joe, Quagmire and Cleveland (who has returned to Quahog) decide to go on a road trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. Whilst driving they are stopped by a police officer, arrested and thrown in jail by the sheriff who abuses his power, and plants marijuana in their car. The group then attempt to escape the prison due to their stay being extended indefinitely, and return to Quahog. The episode served as a follow-up to the exit of the main character Cleveland Brown, who left Family Guy in order to star in his own Fox spin-off, entitled The Cleveland Show. Main cast member and former series writer Mike Henry returned to the series to provide the voice of Cleveland. The episode also featured a crossover between Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, both of which were created by executive producer Seth MacFarlane, and included cameo appearances by two of The Cleveland Shows main characters. First announced at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International, the episode was written by Artie Johann and Shawn Ries, and directed by Brian Iles. The episode received mixed reviews, praising its structure and humor, but criticizing it for not living up to the 1967 drama film Cool Hand Luke, which the episode was named after. According to Nielsen ratings, it was watched by 7.14 million people in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Ralph Garman, Bob Gunton, Sanaa Lathan, Julius Sharpe, and Jennifer Tilly, along with several recurring guest voice actors from the series. Plot When Cleveland Brown returns to Quahog for a week, he visits his old friends Peter, Joe and Quagmire. When Peter gets tired of his wife, Lois, constantly demanding for him to do chores so the group decides to take a road trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. Whilst their husbands are away, Lois, Bonnie and Donna proceed to enjoy \\"girl time\\", resulting with them doing wine-induced childish antics which include forcibly dressing Brian in a humiliating bumblebee costume. While driving through a rural area in Georgia, Peter and his group are pulled over by the local sheriff, and Peter makes every effort to talk as annoyingly and rudely to him as possible. But the Sheriff is more offended by Cleveland's attempt to calmingly explain themselves, punching out their left headlights and then planting a bag of marijuana in their trunk. The group are then sent to a county work camp where they are forced to perform various tasks, including ditch digging and rock crushing. As their stay in the jail supposedly comes to an end, the warden then approaches them and tells them that their stay has been extended an additional thirty days. Learning from another prisoner that they might be locked up forever, the group decides to break out of the prison when the prison guard's eyes are diverted. Successful in their attempt, they soon come across a house where they discover a set of handcuff and shackle keys. They then discover that they are in the sheriff's home, who returns soon after. Peter tries to pretend to be his wife while hiding in a closet, and he convinces the sheriff to let the fugitives go free. This exchange ends with the sheriff asking for a hug, which makes Peter jump out of the closet and reveal the group. The entire police force then comes after them, until they are able to jump on a train and arrive in Quahog, only to be met by the sheriff and his deputies. Joe, however, had called ahead and arranged for the Quahog police department to arrive and rescue them. Joe then wrecks the sheriff's car, shoots him in the leg, and demands he leave Quahog. Production and development Mike Henry returned as Cleveland in the episode. The episode was directed by series regular Brian Iles and written by Artie Johann and Shawn Ries, in their first episode of the series. Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Spencer Porter, Anthony Blasucci, Mike Desilets, and Deepak Sethi serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Walter Murphy, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for the episode. The episode saw the re-appearance of former main cast member Mike Henry as the voice of Cleveland Brown. The actor had previously left the role on Family Guy, in order to star as the character in his own spinoff, entitled The Cleveland Show, which was co-created by Henry. Sanaa Lathan, who portrays Donna Tubbs on The Cleveland Show, also guest starred as her character in the episode. \\"Cool Hand Peter\\" was first announced at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 23, 2011 by series showrunners and executive producers Steve Callaghan and Mark Hentemann. In addition to the regular cast and Lathan, actor Bob Gunton, voice actor Julius Sharpe, and actress Jennifer Tilly, who portrayed the sheriff, warden, UPS Guy and Bonnie Swanson, respectively, guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, voice actor Ralph Garman, and writer John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Recurring cast members Adam West, and Patrick Warburton also appeared in the episode, portraying the characters of Adam West and Joe Swanson, respectively. Bob Gunton's voicing of the warden is probably a nod to his most famous role, that of the warden in the film The Shawshank Redemption. Cultural references The title of the episode is a reference to the 1967 American film Cool Hand Luke. In the opening scene of the episode, while Peter, Joe, Cleveland and Quagmire are drinking at the local bar, Peter's wife, Lois, calls him on his phone. The theme song from The Cleveland Show then begins playing as Peter's ringtone. While the group drives to New Orleans, they attempt to pass the time by playing various games in the car. One of the games involves deciding whether to be a \\"hobo,\\" or former German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. After the group is pulled over by the sheriff, and arrested for drug possession, they are all taken to court, where the jury is revealed to be various characters from the Fox animation series The Simpsons. Peter and Joe then debated over whether the Simpson jurors were actually a jury of their peers. The warden of the prison resembles the warden in the movie The Shawshank Redemption, who is also authoritarian and cruel. In fact, the voice of the warden is the voice of Bob Gunton, the actor who portrayed the warden in the film. After the group escapes from jail, Peter remarks that he is filled with hunger, and would like to stop at a \\"Burger Queen\\" or \\"McDaniels\\" along the way back to Quahog, a reference to the American fast food restaurants Burger King and McDonald's, as indicated by Quagmire. who expresses his disdain that they are \\"on television\\". Reception \\"Cool Hand Peter\\" was originally broadcast on Fox in the United States on December 4, 2011. It was watched by 7.14 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with the Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Good Wife on CBS and Sunday Night Football on NBC. The episode also acquired a 3.6/8 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating Allen Gregory and The Cleveland Show, in addition to significantly edging out both shows in total viewership. The episode's ratings increased significantly from the previous week's episode, \\"Amish Guy\\". The episode received mixed reviews, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club calling the storyline \\"disappointing.\\" He wrote of the episode, \\"At this juncture, disappointment is an expectation, something I have to fight against whenever I sit down to watch the show in an attempt to give each episode a fair shake.\\" He continued, \\"This week, I was at a bit of a loss, because despite a return to an older, more successful formula, with a clearly plotted path, Family Guy didn't muster up enough material to fill out the A-plot of a half hour.\\" McFarland also stated that the episode did not live up to the 1967 drama film Cool Hand Luke, that the title of the episode was named after. He concluded his review of the episode by giving the episode a grade of C. Terren R. Moore of Ology also found the episode to be unimpressive, noting, \\"It's good fun while it's on, but nothing here really sticks or adds to anything new to love about Family Guy.\\" Moore also commented, \\"it's a pretty weak episode of Family Guy, where the most memorable joke of the night involves a thought bubble where Quagmire pulls a string of beads out of a woman's vagina.\\" In the conclusion of the review, Moore gave the episode a 6/10 score.

When the French Revolution broke out, he was banished; in 1794 he returned, and after the reorganization of the Academy in 1809 was appointed professor of Greek. He resigned his post in 1824, making way for his son. In 1826 he was decorated by the Royal Society of London. Works Schweigh√§user's first important work was his edition of Appian (1785), with Latin translation and commentary, and an account of the MSS. On Brunck's recommendation, he had collated an Augsburg MS. of Appian for Samuel Musgrave, who was preparing an edition of that author, and after Musgrave's death he felt it a duty to complete it. His Polybius, with translation, notes and special lexicon, appeared between 1789 and 1795. But his chief work is his edition of Athenaeus (1801‚Äì1807), in fourteen volumes, one of the Bipont editions. According to Paul Louis Courier, this edition is a great progress on the one of Isaac Casaubon, which was two centuries old at the time. His Herodotus (1816; lexicon, 1824) is less successful; he depends too much on earlier editions and inferior MSS., and lacks the finer scholarship necessary in dealing with such an author. Mention may also be made of his Enchiridion of Epictetus and Tabula of Cebes (1798), which appeared at the time when the doctrines of the Stoics were fashionable; the letters of Seneca to Lucilius (1809); corrections and notes to Suidas (1789); and some moral philosophy essays. His minor works are collected in his Opuscula academica (1806). Family His son, Johann Gottfried, was also a distinguished scholar and archaeologist. Bibliography See monographs by J. G. Dahler, C.

AFTAH contends that there is a fundamental conflict between gay rights and religious freedom. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) designated it as an anti-LGBT hate group.

Activism In 1997, LaBarbera, then an editor for the Family Research Council, criticized US President Bill Clinton for supporting the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) stating: \\"He's out there using his presidential power to boost the gay lobby. I think there is an increasing acceptance [of homosexuality], but the majority of Americans are put off by the kind of homosexual advocacy they are seeing.\\" In 2009, AFTAH filed a lawsuit in US Federal Court against a Naperville, Illinois, Holiday Inn Select, because of the cancellation of a banquet the AFTAH planned to hold October 6, 2007, at the hotel.

Built in the Renaissance style from 1588 to 1591 and expanded in 1622, it is set on a castle bank in the middle of an artificial lake in a forested area. Wilhelm Dinesen, father of writer Karen Blixen, spent his childhood years at Katholm. History As seen from east - anno 1885 Katholm traces its history as a farm back to the 15th century and was in 1545 turned into a manor house by Christian Fasti. His son, Thomas Fasti, began the construction of today's castle with the completion of the east wing in 1588 and the north wing in 1591. Thomas Fasti died in 1600 but his widow Christence Bryske continued to live at Katholm until her own death in 1611. They are buried in a chapel at the local Als√∏ church. Albret Skeel Christence Bryske's brother inherited the estate after his sister but when he died a few years later it was passed on to his two sons, Gert and Truid. However, they encountered economic difficulties and in 1616 sold Katholm to Albret Skeel who was appointed Admiral of the Realm and admitted into the Privy Council that same year. He expanded the complex with a low west wing (1622) as well as a large farm south of the house. The estate remained in the possession of the Skeel family for the next few generations but in 1681 Albret Skeel's granddaughter married Jens Maltesen Sehested and when she died in 1684 he bought out his mother in law as well as his brother in law, Christian Reedtz. Palle Krag 1657 - 1723 In 1690, Katholm was acquired by Palle Krag who had recently married Helle Nielsdatter Trolle, a wealthy widow. A skilled soldier, Krag had distinguished himself in the Scanian War and would later do so again in the Great Northern War. Palle Krag and Helle Trolle had no children and when Krag died in 1723, one year after his wife, Katholm was sold to Major-General Poul Rosen√∏rn. After his death in 1737, Katholm was passed on to his widow, Mette, n√©e Benzon, and their son Peder Rosen√∏rn. The last Rosen√∏rn to own Katholm was Mathias Peter Otto Rosen√∏rn who in 1802 sold the estate to Jens J√∏rgensen, who for many years had been a tenant of Rosenholm Castle. The following decades were a time of financial difficulties for large landowners and in 1823 the State had to take over Katholm along with a number of others estates. Wilhelm Dinesen, father of Karen Blixen In December 1839 Katholm was sold on public auction. The buyer was First Lieutenant Adolph Wilhelm Dinesen. An active participant in public life, he was both a councillor and an MP. Dinesen had eight children, including Wilhelm Dinesen, the father of writer Karen Blixen. When Adolph Wilhelm Dinesen died in 1876, his oldest son Wentzel Laurentzius Dinesen took over Katholm while Wilhelm later acquired Rungstedlund north of Copenhagen where Karen Blixen was born. Collet era In 1916, Holger Collet acquired Katholm from the daughter of W. F. Dinesen. Holger Collet built a new stable and later a new tenant residence and stable with garage. In 1935 the farm buildings were devastated by fire, which caused substantial damage. In 1942 Carl Frederik Collet took over Katholm the year before the death of his father, C.F. Collet. He reformed the operations, rendering the estate more efficient. Peter Collet took over at Katholm in 1971. Architecture As seen from east - anno 2013 Located on a castle bank in an artificial lake, Katholm consists of three wings built in red brick to a simple Renaissance design. The two capped corner towers and the staircase in the central yard all date from the original house along with the east wing which has a Dutch gable with curved contours. The lower and slightly younger west wing has a crow-stepped gable. The central yard opens to the south where a bridge in masonry leads across the moat to the remains of the farm, a barn from 1618 and a stable from 1619. Katholm Castle today Katholm has since 2007 been owned by Marie Therese Collet, fourth generation of Collets at the manor. The estate covers 1170 hectares.

The siege resulted in Portsmouth falling to Parliament after a little under a month of conflict. Build-up In the lead up to the war, Portsmouth was viewed as highly valuable by both Parliament and the king.Webb (1977), p. 1. The Fortifications of Portsmouth were so strong that after it was captured by Parliament and properly garrisoned, it was suggested by some that it would take as many as 40,000 men to seize it. Its governor at the time was George Goring who managed to convince both sides of his loyalty and as a result received funds from both the king and Parliament.Godwin (1973), pp. 9‚Äì10. In 1641, Goring began to work on the town's defences. By November, Parliament had received reports that the work was focused on the landward side and this along with other claims that brought into question his loyalty to Parliament resulted in Goring receiving a summons to Parliament to explain himself. With his defence, Goring was not only able to convince the House of the innocence of his actions but received its applause and further monetary payments.Webb (1977), pp. 5‚Äì7. Opening skirmishes Goring declared for the king on 2 August. Parliament managed to implement a sea blockade on 8 August under Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick. On land, the Parliamentary forces were able to assemble on the top of Portsdown Hill on 10 August.Godwin (1973), pp. 11‚Äì13. Goring's preparations for a siege were far from comprehensive. Not only was his work on improving the defences incomplete but the town's stores held supplies for as little as two days.Webb (1977), p. 13. Between 10 and 12 August, the Portsmouth garrison raided the farms of Portsea Island for food with both grain and livestock being seized and either taken within the city walls or, in the case of some of the livestock, being left to graze beneath the city's guns. The Parliamentarian forces responded by landing a force with two cannons at the south east of the island and ferrying women, children, cattle and sheep across Langstone harbour to Hayling Island. At this point, Goring's forces peaked at about 500 men. Fall of Portsbridge The Royalist defences on the bridge over Portsbridge Creek were attacked by 20 Parliamentarians on the evening of 12 August. The defenders numbering just eight put up little resistance. One was captured while the other seven managed to escape.MacLachlan (2000), p. 39. The Parliamentarians also took the small fort to the north of the bridge.Mitchell (1988), p. 1. The siege With the Parliamentarian forces now on Portsea Island, a few sallies by Parliamentarian forces resulted in indecisive skirmishes, which resulted in a handful of casualties for both sides, along with a similar number of prisoners, some of which were exchanged.Godwin (1973), pp. 15‚Äì16. Desertion was soon a problem for the Royalist force and by 15 August, the Royalist garrison numbered just 200, of which it was thought half would desert if given a chance.Godwin (1973), p. 14. By comparison, the Parliamentarian besiegers numbered some 740 men in total. During this phase of the conflict, a number of parleys took place, but aside from prisoner exchanges nothing was achieved as a result. The conflict was not entirely limited to battles ashore. On the night of 15 August, Parliamentarian forces under Captain Browne Bushell captured the Henrietta Marie in a cutting out operation.MacLachlan (2000), p. 43. At around the same time, the force blockading Portsmouth from the sea rose to number seven ships. Meanwhile, the Parliamentarian forces began to prepare a firing position in Gosport under the direction of John Meldrum. The Royalist forces attempted to bombard the position but their shots had little effect. The Parliamentarians opened fire on the city with two cannons from the works on 20 August; counter-battery fire from Portsmouth's guns again had little effect. The cannon on the rest of the works opened fire on 2 September.Godwin (1973), pp. 17‚Äì19. Fall of Southsea Castle By the start of September, the Royalist garrison of Southsea Castle consisted of only a dozen men. On the night of 4 September, a Parliamentarian force of 400 infantry equipped with ladders and backed by cavalry set out to attack the castle. Although the force was spotted and fired on by the guns of Portsmouth, they were able to make to the seaward side of the castle. Simultaneously, a small party approached the main gate and called on the castle to surrender. Captain Challoner was at the time somewhat inebriated and asked them to come back in the morning. At around this time, the guns of Portsmouth once more opened fire on the assaulting force, and the Parliamentarians responded by scaling the walls and capturing the castle without further opposition. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being recaptured.Webb (1977), pp. 18‚Äì19. Surrender With the fall of Southsea Castle, the Royalists suffered further desertions with their forces falling to just 50‚Äì60 men, many of whom lacked training. Negotiations over the terms of surrender started at 10:00 on 4 September,MacLachlan (2000), p. 50. with a final agreement being reached by 19:00. Under the terms of the agreement, the garrison was granted safe passage and all prisoners were released with the exception of Parliamentarian deserters. Goring chose to go via sea to Holland.Godwin (1973), pp. 21‚Äì23. The Royalists were in part able to obtain such favourable terms due to the threat of detonating Portsmouth's gunpowder reserves, including 1,200 barrels stored in the Square Tower.Webb (1977), pp. 20‚Äì21. A couple of days were allowed for Goring and the garrison to settle their affairs and Parliament came into formal possession of the town on 7 September at 06:00.
