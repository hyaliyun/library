Any or all of these event can happen during the event weekend. The 6 events are the following: * The Bats Day Black Market - A large gathering of vendors selling spooky items, including clothing, music, artwork, books, collectibles, toys, and other original genre items from the Dark Subculture. * The Bats Day Ghoulish Gala (originally called The Bats Day Creepy Cocktail Party) - This event typically happens the night of the Black Market, and is a catered hors d'≈ìuvres cocktail party with a raffle. * The Nightmare Before Bats Day Dinner - A full sit down dinner. * The Bats Day Dark Park Festival - A live music and DJ event festival geared to the Dark Alternative Subculture. This event was added in 2008. * The Bats Day Happy Haunts Swing Wake: A Costumed Celebration - A new event as of 2011, this is a costumed gala event where attendees are required to dress as the deceased or their favorite Disneyland Haunted Mansion Character. Creativity is celebrated, and costumes and characters from all time periods are encouraged to attend and celebrate the afterlife. This event happens Friday night, the start of the weekend of events, and is a catered hors d'≈ìuvres cocktail party for the first hour, with a raffle, DJs and live entertainment. * Bats Day in the Fun Park - The Big Spooky Trip to Disneyland. Bats Day patrons dress in their Gothic attire for the annual visit to the park. There are other scheduled events and gatherings on this day, including a large group picture in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle, group pictures at the Haunted Mansion, and a photo scavenger hunt. History The event started as a relatively small goth \\"meet up\\" event of about 80 people from two dance clubs, Absynthe and Release the Bats. It has grown to include more aspects of the goth subculture. Other dark subcultures represented at the event include Horror punk, Halloween, Rockabilly, Psychobilly, Black metal, Steampunk, Hearse Societies, Industrial and EBM. Artist, Club Promoter of the Los Angeles, Hollywood Ca scene, Noah K. (Absynthe) has been producing event since the beginning of the event and still continues to produce the event to this day. The event draws people from not only the local area but all over the world, including New Zealand, England, Brazil, France, Germany and Mexico. It has evolved into a family friendly event as well. Parents in this subculture are able to bond with their children at the \\"Happiest Place on Earth\\" more comfortably at an event such as this one, whereas they might be regarded as out-of-place on any other weekend at Disneyland or other theme parks. Information about this event, as well as photos from prior years, can be found on the official website. An article on the event appeared in the June, 2009 issue of Gothic Beauty Magazine. Though there are rumors that this event occurred due to the success of a similar event called 'Baumaus', the two clubs promoting this event claim that they had no idea that 'Baumaus' ever happened. The event turned 20 years in May 2018 and is going back to its roots of just a park meet, for the time being. The pre-events will make a return when the time is right.

He was largely responsible for the foundation of the modern city of Liverpool. Johnson was born in Liverpool in 1664. Left a considerable fortune by his father, he traded as a merchant with the British colonies in North America; he was particularly involved in the slavery, tobacco and sugar trades. He is recognised as one of the earliest recorded slave traders in Liverpool . In 1715, he transported 130 Jacobite prisoners to the American plantations. He also played an important role in the emergence of the rock salt industry in Cheshire. Johnson succeeded his father in 1689 as bailiff of Liverpool and in 1695 as mayor. He effected the separation of Liverpool from the parish of Walton-on-the-Hill in 1699 and obtained from the Crown a grant to the Corporation of the site of the old castle, where he planned the town market. He was the chief promoter of the construction of the first dry dock in 1708 and steered a bill through Parliament to authorise it. In addition, the building of St Peter's and St George's churches (both now demolished) were due in great measure to his efforts. From 1701 to 1723 he was Member of Parliament for Liverpool, sitting as a Whig. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1708. In 1723, having lost in speculation the fortune which he had inherited from his father, he retired from Parliament and was appointed collector of customs on the Rappahannock River in Virginia. Many sources suggest that he went out to Virginia himself, and died in Jamaica in 1729, but Hayton et al.'s recently published volume in the authoritative History of Parliament series contradicts this, stating that he either never took up the post or exercised it through a deputy, and that he died in lodgings at Charing Cross on 28 December 1728. A Liverpool street is named Sir Thomas Street after him.

It is east of Bridgwater and north-west of Langport. It borders the hamlets and villages of Pathe, Burrowbridge, Middlezoy, Westonzoyland and Aller, which it meets at Beer Wall. The border with Burrowbridge was defined in 1985, reducing Othery to 553 ha (1,366 acres). Many of these borders are defined by ditches and walls created and rearranged, from the 13th century onwards, to drain and channel the waters of the River Cary and the River Parrett as they flooded the low-lying levels on their way to the Bristol Channel.  History  The name means \\"Other- island\\". The \\"island\\" of Othery rising above the Levels is a mixed sedimentary and alluvial deposit: marl, Mercia mudstone, sand and gravel (\\"Burtle Beds\\"), peat, and deposits from the basin of the River Parrett. The moors on the shallowest deposits are just above sea level, with the highest hill, on the southwest side of Othery, standing above sea level. The parish of Othery was part of the Whitley Hundred. Othery once had three pubs, but currently has just one, The London Inn. It had a village shop (closed), a post office (closed), a bakery (Maisey's) and a primary school. There is also a very active village hall. Othery borders two Sites of Special Scientific Interest, both designated in 1985: Southlake Moor and Sedgemoor, to the north of Beer Wall.  Governance  The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.  Religious sites  Othery was a chapelry of Sowy parish with its own chaplain from the 13th century. In 1515, when Sowy was divided, Othery became a separate parish with its own parish church and vicar. The church of St Michael was dedicated before 1203.http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=15113&strquery;=colmer The church, perpendicular in style, was remodelled in the 15th century, and partly rebuilt after 1844. Its typical Somerset tower was restored in 1849 and in 1853, when pinnacles and niches were built; sculptures of heads and angels were added in the following years. There are five bells in the tower; the oldest dates to the 1650s and was made by Robert Austen. The other bells date from between 1692 and 1815. Roundels of medieval glass, originally from Glastonbury Abbey and depicting the heads of three doctors of the church, have been preserved. Stained glass by Hardman, Bell, and Holland of Warwick was installed in the 1850s in the chancel, vestry, and north transept. The church houses a memorial to the three Chard brothers, who included Colonel John Chard, V.C. (d. 1897), who led the defence of Rorke's Drift, South Africa, and whose father lived at Pathe. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The church registers go back to 1560, but the oldest register appears to be a rather poor late 17th-century copy of the original, \\"crudely arranged in alphabetical order of Christian names and with a gap from K-Q.\\" The Othery Cope, found under the mediaeval pulpit at the time of the Victorian renovations, is an extremely rare 16th-century ecclesiastical robe, restored and now housed at the Glastonbury Abbey Museum. Othery church is one of the churches dedicated to St Michael that falls on a ley line proposed by John Michell. Other connected St Michaels on the ley line include churches built at Burrow Mump and Glastonbury Tor. The first Vicar of Othery Parish was John Colmer (1515‚Äì1522).

He oversaw the opening of the London branch of the Llandudno jewellers Wartski, having married the daughter of its founder, Morris Wartski, and went on to become its chairman. Early life Emanuel Snowman was born in Hampstead, London, the son of Abraham Snowman (1849‚Äì1918), a picture dealer, and his wife Rachel, both of whom were born in Poland. His elder brothers were the prominent mohel and medical doctor Jacob Snowman and the painter Isaac Snowman. As a teenager he acted as secretary to Israel Zangwill. In 1898, he spent a year at the agricultural college at Mikve in Palestine where he met Theodore Herzl.\\"Obituary: Emanuel Snowman Connoisseur of fine jewels\\" in The Times, 4 March 1970, p. 12. Career In 1911, he managed the opening of the Regent Street, London, branch of his father-in- law's business, up until then only based in Llandudno, Wales. Whilst under the management of Snowman, Wartski received several Royal warrants, and Queen Mary was a regular customer. Purchases from Russia From 1925, Snowman made regular visits to Russia. He often travelled with Armand Hammer and they both established good relations with the Soviet authorities, allowing Snowman to obtain many exceptional works of art, including nine imperial Faberg√© eggs, intended for resale in London, which he acquired between 1925 and 1938. One of these was the 1913 Winter egg, which was the most expensive ever made, and which sold for a world record $9.6 million at Christie's in New York in 2002. Snowman's visits to the country continued until 1939. The Tsarist government before the Russian Revolution had already tried to foster an interest in Russian decorative arts. After the Revolution, the new government faced a pressing need for hard currency and the sale of objects from the Church and the aristocracy was one way to raise funds quickly.\\"Faberg√© and America\\" by Paul Schaffer in G√©za von Habsburg and Marina Lopato. (1993) Faberg√©: Imperial Jeweller. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 161. There was some discomfort amongst Russian √©migr√© circles in London about the purchase of items that had previously belonged to Russian aristocrats or the royal family as although property confiscated by the Soviets could be legally sold, as the Soviet Government was internationally recognised, some of the items were identifiably the personal property of living individuals or relatives of the recently deceased.\\"Tracing Faberg√© treasures after 1918\\" by Alexander von Solodkoff in G√©za von Habsburg and Marina Lopato.

Korolevstvo krivykh zerkal) is a 1963 Soviet fairy tale film directed by Aleksandr Rou based on the novel, Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors, by Vitali Gubarev. At the end of 2007, Russia TV filmed a musical remake with the same name, featuring stars Nikolay Baskov, Alla Pugacheva, and the Tolmachevy Sisters. The original film contains introduction music and a fairytale style of the early 1960s. It is also notable for its use of actual twins in the leading roles. The film was also the inspiration for a restaurant in Moscow which only hired twins as waiting staff.The Moscow restaurant only hiring twins  Plot summary  Similar in subject to and perhaps inspired by the novel Through The Looking Glass, the film centers around an encounter between a girl named Olya and a mysterious counterpart, Yalo, while staring into a mirror. The characters are exact opposites: Yalo is the absolute opposite of Olya in every way. Where Yalo is organized and precise, Olya is careless and absent-minded. In the story, Olya steps through the mirror into the Kingdom of Crooked Mirrors where Yalo resides. The kingdom, under the rule of King Yagupop LXXVII (reverse of Popugay, meaning parrot), produces crooked mirrors that brainwash its people through subtle changes in reality. When Yalo's friend, a boy named Gurd (reverse of Drug, meaning friend), is suddenly imprisoned for refusing to make crooked mirrors by the evil leaders Anidag (reverse of Gadina, meaning snake), Nushrok (reverse of Korshun, meaning kite) and Abazh (reverse of Zhaba, meaning toad), Olya decides to accompany Yalo to rescue him. They meet a character who introduces herself as Aunt Aksal (reverse of Laska, meaning kindness), one of the king's cooks, who in order to help them reach the king and save Gurd, disguises them as pages of the king. On meeting the king, Anidag, Nushrok, and Abazh reveal themselves to be the actual powers behind the throne. The latter half of the story focuses on their ultimate defeat and the rescue of Gurd with the help of Anidag's humiliated old servant Bar (reverse of Rab, meaning slave), who rebels against his master.

Life Rohault was born in Amiens, the son of a wealthy wine merchant, and educated in Paris. Having grown up with the conventional scholastic philosophy of his day, he adopted and popularised the new Cartesian physics. His Wednesday lectures in Paris became celebrated; they began in the 1650s, and attracted in particular Pierre-Sylvain R√©gis. Rohault died on December 27, 1672 in Paris. Works Oeuvres posthumes, 1682 Rohault held to the mechanical philosophy, and gave qualified support to its \\"corpuscular\\" or atomic form of explanation, assuming that \\"small figured bodies\\" were the underlying physical reality. His Trait√© de physique (Paris, 1671) became a standard textbook for half a century. It followed the precedent set by Henricus Regius in separating physics from metaphysics. It also included the theory of gravitation of Christiaan Huygens, given in terms of an experiment. The translation of Samuel Clarke (initially into Latin) gained an independent status, and numerous editions, through its annotations that purported to correct it with reference to the theories of Isaac Newton. Rohault's experimental orientation remained popular, despite the criticisms of his theories. The Trait√© referred to a model of the eye that Rohault had worked on. A wide range of experiments used by Rohault included some mentioned by Descartes, and two well-known ones of Blaise Pascal, but also others taken from medical men: Gaspard Asselli, Louis Gayant, William Harvey, Jean Pecquet, and Nicholas Steno.

In a career which lasted from June 1899 until October 1901 he ran sixteen times and won six races. He showed modest form as a two-year-old in 1899 but improved to be the leading colt of his generation in 1900 when he won the British Triple Crown. His other wins included the Eclipse Stakes, then one of the most valuable horse races in the world. He was retired to stud at the end of the 1901 season and was later exported to Argentina. Diamond Jubilee was noted throughout his life for his unpredictable and sometimes violent temperament. Background Diamond Jubilee was bred by his owner, the Prince of Wales. He was foaled in the year of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. Diamond Jubilee's sire, St. Simon was an undefeated racehorse who was considered one of the best British runners of the 19th Century. In an outstanding stud career he won nine sires‚Äô championships, having sired ten Classic winners. Perdita, the dam of Diamond Jubilee was a successful racehorse who was bought by the Prince on the advice of John Porter. As a broodmare she produced, in addition to Diamond Jubilee, the 1896 Derby winner Persimmon and the Jockey Club Cup winner Florizel II. Such was the quality of Diamond Jubilee's pedigree, and the status of his owner, that his birth was noted in the press. Racing career=1899: two-year-old season= Diamond Jubilee won only one of his six races as a two-year-old. He was strongly fancied to win the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot on 13 June, starting 6/5 favourite but finished unplaced behind the gelding Democrat, after behaving badly in the paddock and before the start. Among other unpleasant traits he kicked a spectator, delayed the start of the race by repeatedly \\"rearing\\" and attempted to attack and bite his own jockey, the highly experienced John Watts. In the July Stakes at Newmarket the \\"ramapagious beast\\" threw Watts and galloped free for several minutes prior to the start before finishing unplaced again. It was decided to replace Watts with Morny Cannon. Gelding the colt was also a possible solution, but a veterinary examination revealed that the colt had an undescended testicle, making the operation difficult and potentially dangerous. With Cannon as his jockey, Diamond Jubilee showed much improved form to finish second to Epsom Lad in a Prince of Wales's Stakes at Goodwood in late July, but even then his courage was questioned by critics who accused him of showing \\"the white feather.\\" In autumn, Diamond Jubilee ran three times at Newmarket. He recorded his first win when beating moderate opposition in the Boscawen Stakes, and was then moved back up into top class for the Middle Park Stakes on 13 October. He was on his best behaviour finished half a length second to Democrat, after which his trainer Richard Marsh was reported to have described him as \\"the winner of next year's Derby\\". On his final start of the year two weeks later, he finished second behind Democrat again in the Dewhurst Stakes, although he produced an improved effort and gave the winner a more difficult race on this occasion. Despite his relatively modest form Diamond Jubilee was seen as a colt with Classic potential, partly because his pedigree suggested that he would improve with age and distance, whereas Democrat was regarded as essentially a precocious, sprinting type. =1900: three-year-old season= Diamond Jubilee with Herbert Jones, circa 1900 Spring: 2000 Guineas Diamond Jubilee appeared to thrive during the winter of 1899‚Äì1900, and appeared to go particularly well in training for an inexperienced nineteen- year-old jockey named Herbert Jones. When the colt attempted to savage Morny Cannon after a training gallop, Marsh decided to give the ride to Jones. Diamond Jubilee's improved form became well known and when he made his seasonal reappearance in the 2000 Guineas on 2 May he was made 11/4 third favourite in a field of ten runners. He impressed observers before the race with his physical appearance and behaved impeccably. Ridden by Jones, he took the lead after two furlongs and was never in any danger of defeat. He won impressively by four lengths from Bonarosa and Sidus. Two weeks later he ran in the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs and started 1/2 favourite against five opponents. Diamond Jubilee took the lead soon after half way and won by a head from Chevening. The fact that Jones never had to use his whip suggested that the win was rather more comfortable than the narrow margin indicated. Summer: Epsom Derby At Epsom on 31 May, Diamond Jubilee started 6/4 favourite against twelve opponents, with Forfarshire second choice on 100/30. The crowd was reported to be smaller than usual, possibly because of the cold, windy weather. Jones tracked the leaders on the royal colt and turned into the straight disputing second place. Two furlongs from the finish, Jones sent Diamond Jubilee into the lead and he stayed on strongly to win by half a length from Simon Dale, with Disguise third. The royal victory was warmly received with the sky reportedly turning \\"black with hats\\" thrown into the air at the finish. Diamond Jubilee's winning time of 2:42.0 equalled the race record set by his brother Persimmon. At Newmarket the colt started 4/5 favourite for the ¬£10,000 Princess of Wales's Stakes over one mile on 5 July, for which as the Derby winner, he had to carry a weight penalty. He was unable to give twenty pounds to the filly Merry Gal, who led from the start and won by four lengths, but finished ahead of some good horses and was felt to have run creditably. On his next appearance he again had to carry a penalty in the ten furlong Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on 20 July. He produced his most impressive performance to date, taking the lead in the straight and winning decisively from Chevening, to whom he was conceding ten pounds. His winning time of 2:07.4 was a new course record. Autumn: St Leger On 12 September, Diamond Jubilee attempted to become the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown in the St Leger at Doncaster. His temperamental problems returned to the fore as he sweated profusely and took twenty minutes to be saddled. In the race, for which he started 2/7 favourite, he led after half a mile and after being briefly challenged by Elopement in the straight, won easily by a length and a half. On his final start of the season, he ran in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket. Once again, his behaviour caused problems as he delayed the race for several minutes by refusing to leave the paddock. On this occasion however, he was unable to reproduce his best form, and after racing prominently for part of the way, he dropped out in the closing stages and finished unplaced behind Disguise. After the St Leger, Diamond Jubilee was described as \\"the undoubted champion of England\\". Although he was admired for his \\"bulldog courage\\" he was considered clearly inferior to his brother Persimmon. Diamond Jubilee's earnings of ¬£27,985 were largely responsible for ensuring that the Prince of Wales was the leading owner, in terms of money won for the 1900 British season. He was also instrumental in securing the trainers' championship for Richard Marsh and the Sires' Championship for St. Simon =1901: four-year-old season= When the Prince of Wales became King Edward VII in January 1901, he leased all his racehorses to the Duke of Devonshire for the rest of the year. Diamond Jubilee was reported to have made good progress over the winter and was expected to have another successful season. Diamond Jubilee ran only three times, in three of the season's most valuable races (the \\"Ten Thousand Pounders\\"). He had some training problems in spring which affected his progress and his trainer was not optimistic when the royal colt made his first appearance. In the Princess of Wales's Stakes on 4 July he finished second to Epsom Lad, who was winning his first race since beating Diamond Jubilee as a two-year-old. In the Eclipse Stakes later in the month, Diamond Jubilee delayed the start with his familiar antics, but ran well to finish a close fourth in a \\"blanket finish\\" behind Epsom Lad, to whom he was conceding three pounds. Diamond Jubilee ran his last race on 3 October at Newmarket when he finished third to Pietermaritzburg and Epsom Lad in the Jockey Club Stakes, after which he was retired to stud. Stud record Diamond Jubilee began his stud career at standing at the Royal Studs at Sandringham, Norfolk, at a fee of 300 guineas. He was considered no more than a \\"qualified success\\" in England and late in 1905 he was sold for 30,000 guineas and exported to Argentina early the following year. The best of Diamond Jubilee's English-bred offspring were the colt Sancy (Prince of Wales's Stakes) and the filly Jubilee (Park Hill Stakes). In Argentina, Diamond Jubilee announced his arrival at the Haras las Ortigas by attempting to savage the stud manager, but settled down to become a highly successful second career, being the Champion sire in Argentina on four occasions (1914, 1915, 1916 and 1921). Diamond Jubilee retained his unpredictable temper until the end of his life. A few months before his death he escaped from the stud farm and galloped through the neighbouring town of Mor√≥n before being recaptured. He died in 1923 at the age of twenty-six.

By the following day the Portuguese authorities had successfully suppressed the revolt. 4 January is now Colonial Martyrs Repression Day, a national holiday in Angola. Revolt On 3 January, agricultural workers employed by Cotonang, a Portuguese-Belgian cotton plantation company, staged a protest to force the company to improve their working conditions.

The protest led to a general uprising, to which Portuguese authorities responded with an air raid on twenty villages in the area, killing large numbers of Angolan villagers.

The emirate originated in 1013 and lasted until 1091. Visigoths \\"Garnata\\" or \\"Garnata al-Yahud\\" (Granada of the Jews) was a settlement next to the town the Christians called \\"Elvira\\", after the former Iberian name \\"Ilbira\\". Granada as a polity The nearby Iberian (pre-Roman) town of Elvira became the capital of the Al-Andalus Caliphate of C√≥rdoba province. Civil conflicts that wracked the Caliphate in the early eleventh century led to the destruction of the city in 1010. Zawi ben Ziri, the Zirid, was chief of one of the Berber armies that took part in the Caliphate civil war that destroyed Medina Azahara in C√≥rdoba, and later destroyed Medina Elvira. Under his leadership the Elvira townsmen abandoned the provincial capital and established themselves in the Jewish settlement of Gharnata al-Yahud, thereby founding the city of Granada. He founded the first Taifa of Granada kingdom and moved the capital from Elvira to Garnata al-Yahud. The Zirid was a Berber Sanhaja family from the region of Kabylia in Algeria whose members became chiefs and kings in many other Islamic regions, such as in Tunisia. Role of the Jews \\"The peak of Sephardic Judaism as a political as well as cultural reality is found in eleventh- century Granada. The Zirid state that existed for half a century was a Jewish kingdom in everything but name. The Muslim ruler was a powerless figurehead.\\" Jews did not hold the foreigner (dhimmi) status typical of Islamic rule. A Jew, the rabbi, scholar, and poet Samuel ha-Nagid, commanded an army, something not seen again until the modern state of Israel. It has been said that the power and status of the Granadan Jews was not only unique in al- Andalus, but in the entire Islamic world.

It was the first indigenously-developed French helicopter, as well as being one of the first practical European helicopters to be produced.Boyne 2011, pp. 73‚Äì74. The Djinn was also the first rotorcraft to harness tip-jet propulsion to enter production. The Djinn was developed to function as a practical implementation of the earlier experimental Sud-Ouest Ariel rotorcraft. Atypically, the rotors were driven by compressed-air jets at the end of each blade, which had the benefit of eliminating the need for an anti-torque tail rotor. On 2 January 1953, the proof-of-concept S.O.1220 performed its maiden flight; it was followed by the first of the S.O.1221 Djinn prototypes on 16 December 1953. During the subsequence test program, one of the prototypes was recorded as having achieved a world altitude record. Having been suitably impressed by the performance of the Djinn during testing, both the French Army and the German Army chose to procure the type, as well as a number of other customers. Operationally, the type was used for various purposes, including liaison, aerial observation, training, and casualty evacuation. The Djinn was phased out of production during the 1960s as a consequence of the greater success of the comparably more conventional A√©rospatiale Alouette II and A√©rospatiale Alouette III helicopters. Development Positive experiences that had gained from the earlier Ariel experimental tip jet helicopter had given French aviation company Sud-Ouest a strong desire to pursue development of a practical light helicopter that would harness this technology. Out of their efforts towards this aim emerged the design of a light twin-seat rotorcraft, which was promptly designated as the S.O.1221 Djinn.Boyne 2011, p. 101. While this newer design did not share an identical tip jet system to the Ariel, the type did rely upon the same basic concept of feeding compressed air, which was generated by an onboard pump, to the tips of the vehicle's rotor blades to drive the movement of the blades.Boyne 2011, p. 74. A single seat prototype, designated S.O.1220, was constructed to function as an aerial test bed for the rotorcraft's propulsion concept.\\"Helicopter Runs On Air.\\" Popular Science, April 1953.\\"Hot Air Whirler\\" Flight, 18 December 1953. p. 8. On 2 January 1953, the S.O.1220, which was a simple uncovered structure with an exposed seat for the pilot, conducted its maiden flight; early test flights of the rotorcraft proved the viability of the propulsion system. Accordingly, it was decided to proceed with the production of five two-seat prototypes, designated as the S.O.1221; the first of these flew on 16 December 1953.McGowen 2005, p. 74. Within a few days, one of the prototypes had climbed to a recorded altitude of 4,789 m (15,712 ft) to establish a record in its class.Apostolo 1984, p. 94. During the late 1950s, an improved version of the Djinn, tentatively designated as the Djinn III or Super Djinn, was being studied by Sud Aviation, who held the intention of pursuing further development of the type at one point. As envisioned, the modifications present upon the projected Super Djinn variant would have included the adoption of the newer Turbomeca Palouste IV engine; alongside other changes, it would have possessed both greater power and endurance than the original production model.\\"Hew French Helicopters.\\" Flight International, 17 April 1959. p. 512.\\"Helicopters of the World...\\" Flight International, 15 May 1959. p. 684. Design Close up view of the Djinn's upper section and rotor The Sud-Ouest Djinn was the first tip-jet propelled rotorcraft to enter production. As such, the propulsion system involved a Turbomeca Palouste gas turbine engine that drove a pump to produce compressed air, which was in turn fed into the aircraft's hollow rotor blades to exit at their tips, causing the blades to rotate. The rotor hub assembly, which freely oscillated around a spherical thrust bearing, was mounted on a steel pylon by means of a ball joint and rubber shock absorbers. Unlike some of the experimental tip-jet designs of the era, a 'cold' tip-jet approach was used: that there was no combustion activity present at the exhaust nozzles installed at the ends of the rotor blades. Consequently, the nozzles produced little noise in operation, and were claimed by Sud-Ouest to be \\"noiseless\\".\\"The World's Helicopters.\\" Flight International, 23 January 1953. p. 114. The all- metal rotor blades, through which the compressed air travelled to be ejected at the blade tips, consist of a spar of tapering thickness, a honeycomb-filled trailing edge, and feature faired roots to the increase their lift coefficient. It was claimed that the blades possessed a highly homogenous structure, a highly finished surface and a constant profile, and could be easily dismantled to facilitate inspection of the main spar. The blade had no risk of icing owing to the internal current of warm air. The Djinn used relatively standard flight controls, such as the collective pitch control (upon which the throttle was positioned) and adjustable friction trims. Apart from its method of propulsion, the Djinn was a relatively conventional helicopter, featuring a two-seat side-by-side configuration in an enclosed cabin. The cockpit is provided with an array of plexiglas panels, which provide the occupants with a high level of all-round visibility.\\"Helicopters of the World...\\" Flight International, 21 March 1958. p. 376. Directly to the rear of the cockpit was the rotorcraft's single Palouste engine. The engine lacked any electronics and had to be hand-started via a crank handle located on the starboard side of the fuselage. The Djinn possessed the ability to fly at high overload weights for around 5 sec by correctly harnessing the accumulated kinetic energy of the rotor; this 'jump' technique was successfully used to achieve certification for it to be operated to carry heavy payloads, some of which could represent up to 54% of the rotorcraft's overall gross weight. The Djinn featured a two-seat cockpit as standard, which accommodated a pilot and passenger. A range of specialised equipment could be outfitted to suit mission roles, such as stretcher carriers, spray bars, radio sets, electrical systems, additional fuel tanks, and a load-bearing hook. Akin to the later A√©rospatiale Alouette II helicopter, the Djinn made considerable use of pneumatic systems. According to aerospace publication Flight International, considerable weight savings had been on the rotorcraft via the use of bleed air to operate various cockpit indicators and functions, including the blind-flying instruments, fuel gauges, cabin heaters, windshield demisters, trimmers, air/sea rescue hoists and crop-spraying equipment. The rotorcraft was equipped with an uncovered tail boom, fitted with twin fins and a rudder; both directional control and stability were provided by the controlled deflection of exhaust gases from the engine.Mutza 2010, p. 20. As a consequence of the torque-free method of rotor propulsion, the Djinn did not require the presence of an anti-torque tail rotor. A simplistic wheel-equipped twin-skid arrangement was also present; this was retractable by the same manually-operated crank handle used for engine start.\\"S.O. 1221S Djinn.\\" Flight International, 2 November 1956. p. 733. The Djinn could also be deployed with multiple armaments. In the ground-attack role, it could be equipped with a single machine gun, which was manned from the second seat of the cockpit. For performing anti-tank warfare, the Djinn was able to carry a guided missile. When deployed in an effective manner against an adversary, the manufacturer claimed the combination to be extremely difficult for an opposing tank to sight its adversary and to defend itself during the anticipated rapid speed of engagements. Operational history Having observed the development of the Djinn with considerable interest, the French Army encouraged the construction of a pre-production batch of 22 helicopters, which were used for evaluation purposes. The first of these pre-production aircraft flew on 23 September 1954. Three of the pre-production helicopters were subsequently acquired by the United States Army, designating it as the YHO-1, for the purpose of participating in their own series of trials; according to aviation author Stanley S. McGowen, the US Army held little interest in the type. According to author Wayne Mutza, the US Army had found the YHO-1 to be an excellent weapons platform, but had been compelled to abandon interest in the programme by political opposition to the procurement of a rotorcraft that had non-American origins.Mutza 2010, p. 19. The French Army ordered a total of 100 helicopters. The Djinn was operated by the French Army in variety of mission roles, such as liaison, observation, training purposes; when flown with a single pilot, it could be outfitted with two external litters for the casualty evacuation mission. In addition to the French military, a further ten countries placed orders for the type; such as a batch of six rotorcraft which were procured by the German Army. Production of the Djinn came to an end during the mid-1960s, by which point a total of 178 Djinns had been constructed; the type had effectively been replaced by the more conventional and highly successful A√©rospatiale Alouette II.\\"France.\\" Flight International, 11 May 1961. p. 626. Some Djinns were sold on to civil operators; in this capacity, they were often equipped for agricultural purposes, fitted with chemical tanks and spray bars.

The family spent some time on a relative's farm before ultimately settling in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where David grew up. =Education= At age 19, he graduated from the City College of New York while simultaneously receiving a bachelor's degree in Hebrew literature from the Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS). In 1947, at age 22, he earned his master's in philosophy from Columbia, and he received his ordination from JTS a year later, in 1948. In 1951, he received a doctorate in Hebrew literature from JTS. His dissertation was on Tehilim, which he loved. =Family= David met the love of his life and wife of 63 years, Esther Kobre, through her brother, with whom he was good friends, and also through Hashomer Hadati (now Bnei Akiva). In 1943, when David Lieber was 18 and Esther Kobre was 16, they became engaged, and they married two years later on June 10, 1945.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD‚Äî Extensions of Remarks E129 Drs. David and Esther Lieber had four children: Michael, Daniel, Deborah, and Susan. =Career= From 1950 to 1954, he served as rabbi at Sinai Temple in Los Angeles. From 1954 to 1956 he served as chaplain in the U.S. Air Force. In 1956, he was named Dean of Students at the University of Judaism. In 1964, he was named president of the University of Judaism, a post which he held for 29 years. As the university's first full-time president, Dr. Lieber oversaw the institution's expansion and established its rabbinic program, the first on the West Coast for Conservative Judaism, as well as its MBA program for non-profit management. When he stepped down as president in 1993, David Lieber was one of the nation's longest-serving college presidents. His career did not end with his retirement. After stepping down from the post of president, Dr. Lieber continued to teach as the Flora and Arnold Skovron Distinguished Service Professor of Biblical Literature and Thought at the UJ, he served as president of the Rabbinical Assembly from 1996 to 1998, and he also served as senior editor for the Etz Hayim Humash, the first official Torah and commentary of the Conservative Movement.The Lieber Humash by the AJU Dr. David Lieber first conceived of the idea of writing the Etz Hayim Humash in 1969, in order to create a \\"new Torah commentary to reflect the age in which it is made,\\" but began working on the project eighteen years later, in 1987. The Etz Hayim Humash is more accepting of biblical criticism than the Humash previously used by the Conservative movement, the Hertz, containing a number of essays which challenge the historicity of some of the biblical narratives. It also reduces the frequency with which the word \\"He\\" is used to describe God. Dr. David Lieber described his work on the Etz Hayim Humash as \\"a great privilege\\" and stated that he \\"worked with great scholars,\\" and \\"Just seeing how they worked was an inspiration.

Named after the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) annual pay-per-view event WrestleMania, it was the first WWF licensed game available for these computers which were still dominant in Europe. It was followed on most of these computers by 1992's WWF European Rampage Tour. In February 1993, the Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were released as part of the Super Fighter compilation with Pit-Fighter and Final Fight. Visually, the game resembles the arcade game WWF Superstars, and it plays somewhat similarly as well. Gameplay Commodore Amiga version of WWF Wrestlemania The player can choose from either Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, or The British Bulldog and must defeat five opponents to become the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. The opponents are, in order, Mr. Perfect, The Warlord, \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase, The Mountie, and Sgt. Slaughter. Before each match, the opponent will taunt the player's wrestler with a comment, and the player will then be able to choose from several replies in a nod to the WWF house style at the time. Each wrestler is able to perform basic punches and kicks as well as a range of more advanced moves such as dropkicking, clotheslining, and one signature grapple maneuver which is performed by \\"waggling the joystick\\". In addition, there is a chair outside the ring which can be used as a weapon. Matches have a five-minute time limit, and a time limit draw or count-out will have the same effect as losing a match. The player has a total of four credits. The game also features a practice mode in which the player faces a prone opponent. Another player can also control the second wrestler, but it will always be Mr. Perfect. Reception The game was well received. Crash said that \\"Ocean have captured the atmosphere of the sport perfectly.\\" Sinclair User liked the game, but criticized the lack of alternate difficulty options. Your Sinclair said \\"The graphics in WWF are really slick\\", and also praised the multiplayer option, which they described as \\"the best two-player game that's been seen on any Speccy fighting game\\".

Biography Fife graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1918 and served in both World War I and World War II in submarines and surface combatants. Prior to the Second World War, he served aboard USS S-3 (SS-107) and USS R-22 (SS-99), and was commanding officer of USS N-7 (SS-59), USS R-19 (SS-96) and USS R-18 (SS-95). In addition to his service on submarines, he also served on the battleship USS Idaho (BB-24) and the destroyers USS Leary (DD-158) and USS Hatfield (DD-231) from 1923 until May 1935. When the U. S. entered World War II, Admiral Fife was Chief of Staff of Submarine Squadron 20 in the Philippines (part of the Asiatic Fleet under Admiral T. C. Hart). After the squadron was dissolved into Submarines, Asiatic Fleet, he served as Chief of Staff to Admiral Hart until May 1942. About this time he and Captain J. E. Wilkes, his former squadron commander, were instrumental in identifying several deficiencies of the submarine force, especially the difficulties with the Mark 14 torpedo and the Hooven-Owens- Rentschler diesel engine. Fife would later conduct some of the experiments that isolated the Mark 14 torpedo's defective components in cooperation with Rear Admiral Charles A. Lockwood, then Commander, Submarines, Southwest Pacific. In late 1942 he served with General MacArthur as the representative of Admiral A. S. Carpender during the Buna campaign. Following this he commanded the submarines of Task Force 42 (later Task Force 72) in Brisbane, Australia, where he meticulously planned and directed his submarines' missions. In 1944 Admiral Fife transferred to the staff of Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet (COMINCH) Admiral Ernest J. King in Washington, D.C. as a war planner. Admiral Fife was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for meritorious service as the Chief of Staff to Commander Submarines, Asiatic Fleet, the Air Medal (by the Army), and a Gold Star in lieu of a second Distinguished Service Medal for action in the Pacific area. At the close of 1944 he returned to Australia as Commander, Submarines, Seventh Fleet; Commander, U.S. Naval Forces, Fremantle, Western Australia; and Commander Task Force 71. As a result, he was awarded a Gold Star in lieu of a third Distinguished Service Medal. From April 1947 until 1950, he commanded the Submarine Force, Atlantic Fleet (COMSUBLANT). This assignment was followed by duty as Assistant Chief, and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations (Operations). His final assignment before retirement was as U. S. Naval Commander in Chief, Mediterranean, under Admiral Mountbatten, Royal Navy. Fife retired from the Navy in August 1955, and was promoted upon retirement to full admiral. In retirement he served as the Director of Mystic Seaport museum in Stonington, Connecticut. During his tenure at Mystic Seaport he oversaw a great expansion of the museum's exhibits and the refloating of the historic whaling ship Charles W. Morgan. He died in 1975 in Stonington, Connecticut and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Legacy Fife bequeathed his estate in Stonington to the U.S. Navy, which turned it into a recreational area. The park is located at 571 Stonington Road (U.S. Route 1). A commemorative plaque is located on the property. Commemorative Plaque Fife Hall, a navigation training facility at Naval Submarine Base New London is named in his honor. The USS Fife (DD-991), commissioned 31 May 1980 and decommissioned in 2003, was named in his honor.

The Bartholdi Hotel, built in 1885 and later demolished, occupied the southeast corner of 23rd Street and Broadway, according to New York's Early Skyscrapers: \\"1880s: Bartholdi Hotel\\" During the 1950s the chain expanded to the Newark, New Jersey, Albany, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Baltimore, Maryland, and Washington, D.C. areas.Jackson, Kenneth T., editor.

Coffee, donuts and hot dogs, with a unique mustard relish in a toasted bun, were added to the Nedick's menu. The chain became known for the orange with white decor of its locations as well as the slogans \\"Good food is never expensive at Nedick's\\" and \\"Always a pleasure\\". Following intense competition in the 1970s from national chains including McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, and criticism in 1981 for the quality of its concession at the Central Park Zoo, Nedick's ceased operations. An attempt was made in 2003 to revive the chain by new owners who had purchased the rights to use the Nedick's name. Three locations were opened in New York City during 2003 but were closed after operating for a number of years. An article in The New York Times once referred to the Nedick's chain as \\"The Starbucks of New York\\". History The Nedick's chain was founded by Robert T. Neely, a real estate investor, and Orville A. Dickinson, who operated a store in the Bartholdi Hotel located at 23rd Street and Broadway, in 1913. The original Nedick's stand opened in a hotel storefront at the Bartholdi Hotel. Nedick's business plan was modeled after an Atlantic City juice stand named Clements. Growing from one location they expanded to 13 locations by 1917. In 1924 it was reported that the Nedick's Corporation had signed a 21-year lease, at an aggregate cost of $1,000,000, for three locations on Coney Island with one located on the Coney Island Boardwalk. By 1927 Nedick's had expanded to 135 locations and reported serving 25,000,000 customers annually with a gross profit of $2,500,000. Two- thirds of Nedick's sales were from their orange drink and in 1928 plans were made to operate a bottling plant for this beverage. In later years Nedick's orange drink was advertised for sale at a large number of retail outlets. Hot lunches were added to the Nedick's menu beginning in 1930. The Great Depression took a toll on the Nedick's chain and by 1934 only 40 locations remained. Robert Neely, the sole remaining owner, lost control of the company when a group of investors purchased the assets of Nedick's, at auction, for $48,000 on April 11, 1934. The new owners of Nedick's worked aggressively to rebuild the brand and began using radio advertising that touted the health benefits of vitamin B1 that was being added to the traditional Nedick's orange drink. Some of the new the radio commercials for the Nedick's chain featuring a character called \\"Little Nick\\". A loss leader breakfast was offered in order to bring in customers and it was hoped that this would increase business throughout the day. Within a five-year period, from 1941‚Äì1946, sales numbers at Nedick's tripled. In 1948 it was advertised that a carbonated version of the Nedick's orange drink was to be sold only through independent retailers. In 1953, Nedick's, with 75 locations, began running a contest in which customers could enter to win daily prizes ranging from $1‚Äì$25 at each location and a monthly drawing where one Nedick's customer would win a mink coat. During this time Nedick's also offered advertising token coins, included in packages of cigarettes that were sold at Nedick's, that could be used for purchasing products at their locations before the expiration date stamped on the token. After being acquired in May 1965 by the ABC Consolidated Corporation, plans were announced to expand and modernize the then 83 store chain with a goal of making Nedick's a national chain. Nedick's was a sponsor of the New York Knicks basketball team, which gave rise to the catchphrase of the Knicks' long-time radio announcer, Marty Glickman: \\"Good like Nedick's\\", intoned after the team scored a basket.Vecsey, George. \\"Sports of the Times; Glickman is Back Where He Belongs\\", The New York Times, December 18, 1988Sandomir, Richard. \\"Marty Glickman: 1917‚Äì2001 ‚Äì The Snub, the Voice, the Heart; A Precise, Animated Diction That Captivated the Listener\\" The New York Times obituary, January 7, 2001 Another common phrase was \\"Meet me outside Nedick‚Äôs\\", as the well-known and highly visible locations were very familiar for people to rendezvous.Vecsey, George. \\"Sports of the Times; With the Dolans Involved, Expect More Ugliness\\", The New York Times, July 15, 2007 Following intense competition in the 1970s from such national chains as McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts, and criticism in 1981 for the quality of its concession at the Central Park Zoo, Nedick's ceased operations during the 1980s. =Revival of brand name= In 2001, the Riese Organization, which operated a number of Dunkin' Donuts and Pizza Hut locations, sought to revive the Nedick's brand and purchased the rights for the Nedick's name. Three Nedick's locations were opened in New York City in 2003 at Penn Station, 1286 Broadway and 416 8th Avenue. These new locations featured an expanded menu from the original Nedick's stores and it was reported that research was done on Nedick's history to make the dining experience as close to the original, but it was admitted that most of the information obtained was anecdotal. All locations have since closed and Nedick's is no longer featured on Riese Restaurants webpage.

The original series spawned a 2-hour TV special in 2006 which followed the main character, Kuryu, five years later. That special sets up the lead-in for the 2007 feature film. The all-star cast of this film includes the original cast from the TV series; cameos by Ayase Haruka and Nakai Kiichi (from the 2006 special), as well as guests Koshiro Matsumoto, Tamori, and special guest, Korean star Lee Byung-hun. This film mainly portrays the events that occurs in the courtroom, which was rarely done in the TV series. The region-2 DVD (Korean subtitles version also available) was released on March 8, 2008 by Pony Canyon. A sequel feature film, also titled Hero, was released in theatres in July 2015. The film follows Kuryu and the cast of the 2014 TV Series and features the return of Amamiya, who was inexplicably absent from the second TV series. Plot The film begins six years after Kuryu Kohei was transferred to Ishigaki Island (in the TV series finale). We learn in the interim that he has since been transferred to Sapporo and then to a brief tenure in Yamaguchi Prefecture (the events of the 2006 Hero TV Special). Kuryu Kohei returns to the same Tokyo District Prosecutors Office from the TV series and reunites with his old workmates. The events of the film takes him to Korea, wraps up plot threads from the TV special and allows Amamiya and Kuryu to rekindle their relationship which had been in limbo since their date at the 2002 World Cup (5 years). Kuryu prosecutes a fatal hit and run case, but runs into obstruction and interference as the chief suspect is a witness to a high profile political case. As such, Kuryu must face an elite, powerful lawyer, played by Koshiro Matsumoto. Proving his suspect guilty risks collapsing the national case. However, as always, Kuryu only cares about finding the truth and justice about his case and goes to great lengths (even travelling to Korea) to find it. While the TV episodes focused mostly on Kuryu's pre-trial investigative abilities, the film showcases Kuryu's legal skills within the courtroom, leaving Amamiya and the other co-workers to do much of the legwork.

The final match is a championship bout with The Legion of Doom in New York City's Madison Square Garden. Each wrestler possesses several basic wrestling attacks like punches and kicks, dropkicks, clotheslines, press slams and backbreakers. The action can be less confined to the ring as the player has more room to move around the centre stage and can choose from a variety of weapons to use against opponents. Unlike its predecessor WWF WrestleMania, there is no time limit for the matches.

Design and development The LDA-01 was a single-seat tandem-wing monoplane, fabric covered with metal construction. The foreplane had a common design to the separately-made port and starboard wings of the main plane, giving it half the area. The intention was to reduce the number of spare parts needed by re-using the same wing component interchangeably in each location. The main wings were mounted at the rear-end of the box structure fuselage and the fore wing was attached underneath the front. The fuselage was fitted initially with a four-wheeled landing gear and was designed to be fitted with a detachable payload container to allow easy conversion between roles. The landing gear was changed later in development to a more conventional tricycle configuration. It was powered by a rear-mounted pusher engine. The LDA-01 G-AVOR first flew on 24 August 1971 at Wisley in Surrey, under the power of an 85 hp (63 kW) Continental C85 piston engine, but was later refitted with a more powerful Lycoming O-320 engine. The aircraft (which by this time had been re-registered G-UTIL), and had been renamed the Boxer 500, was being modified to planned production configuration by Brooklands Aerospace at Old Sarum Airfield when it was destroyed in a fire on 16 January 1987.

Description  Workers are up to 4 mm long. They are more diurnal than other fungus growers, but also work a little at night. Winged forms were found during July.Urich 1895, in: Wheeler 1925 Habitat In young colonies this leads to a small chamber about 15 cm below, which is situated to the right or left of a gallery. When the colony increases new chambers are formed by piercing through the first. Colonies do not exceed 200 individuals, and a nest thus consists of up to three fungus-growing chambers opening into the first one, which is then used as an antechamber, where material brought in by workers is deposited prior to bringing it into the growth chambers, which are about 6 cm in diameter. Small roots growing into them are not cut away but used to hang the gardens on, which resemble a coarse grey sponge. Scattered throughout this mass are adults, pupae and larvae. White bodies of about .25 mm are strewn thickly upon the surface of the garden, which consist of an aggregation of hyphae with spherical swellings at the end. These bodies, called \\"Kohlrabi\\" clumps by M√∂ller, are used for food by the ants. When held in artificial nests, they preferred fruits, especially oranges over other matter like flowers, leaves, and even the organic glue from the back of an old book, which they will all put to use. Of the oranges they take very small particles of the white skin.  Behavior  The queens appear to mate with only one male during their nuptial flights. Example species The nests of S. urichi are most often found in the grass, and can be easily recognized by their peculiar raised entrance. They are always excavated in soil rich in clay, and the cylindrical entrances raise almost 3 cm above the surface. S. diego from Colombia was found to build a fungus garden about 20 cm below the surface. Workers feign death when encountered. They collect little green vegetable particles resembling an alga, on which they grow their fungus.Forel 1896, in: Wheeler 1925 S. zacapanus was first found on the clay banks of a small irrigation ditch in an orchard at Zacapa, Guatemala. The nests had small craters of about 6 cm diameter and were covered with the ejected fragments of old fungus substrate.Wheeler 1911, in: Wheeler, 1925 S. impexus was found in a sandy area at Kartabo, Guyana, to which S. amabilis from Panama is very closely related.Wheeler, 1925 Species * Sericomyrmex amabilis Wheeler, 1925 * Sericomyrmex aztecus Forel, 1885 * Sericomyrmex beniensis Weber, 1938 * Sericomyrmex bondari Borgmeier, 1937 * Sericomyrmex burchelli Forel, 1905 * Sericomyrmex diego Forel, 1912 ‚Äî Colombia * Sericomyrmex harekulli Weber, 1937 * Sericomyrmex impexus Wheeler, 1925 ‚Äî Guyana * Sericomyrmex luederwaldti Santschi, 1925 * Sericomyrmex lutzi Wheeler, 1916 * Sericomyrmex mayri Forel, 1912 * Sericomyrmex moreirai Santschi, 1925 * Sericomyrmex myersi Weber, 1937 * Sericomyrmex opacus Mayr, 1865 * Sericomyrmex parvulus Forel, 1912 * Sericomyrmex radioheadi Je≈°ovnik/Schultz, 2017 ‚Äî Venezuela * Sericomyrmex saussurei Emery, 1894 * Sericomyrmex scrobifer Forel, 1911 * Sericomyrmex urichi Forel, 1912 * Sericomyrmex zacapanus Wheeler, 1925 ‚Äî Guatemala FootnotesReferences  * ITIS: Sericomyrmex species list Category:Formicinae Category:Ant genera ","title":"Sericomyrmex"},{"id":"15089088","text":"The Guard is a Canadian drama television series portraying the life of the Canadian Coast Guard along the British Columbia Coast. Filming takes place in Squamish, British Columbia with Howe Sound standing in for the fictional Port Hallet and a real 47-foot Coast Guard lifeboat Cape St. James has been renamed Cape Pacific for the series. The show primarily revolves around the four main characters: Miro Da Silva (Steve Bacic), Laura Nelson (Claudette Mink - Season 1; Sonya Salomaa - Seasons 2 and 3), Andrew Vanderlee (Jeremy Guilbaut), and Carly Greig (Zoie Palmer). There is also a strong supporting cast, including Gordon Michael Woolvett (as Barry Winter), who worked with Bacic previously on Andromeda, and Eve Harlow, who won a 2009 Leo Award for her role on the show. The show focuses on both the professional and personal lives of the lead characters, confronting issues such as addiction, post traumatic stress disorder, and family problems. It was picked up by Ion premiering March 13, 2010. By late April, it was put on hiatus on the basis that it \\"did not find a broad enough audience on the network\\", explained a spokesperson. It subsequently aired for a period on the ION Life digital channel. Episodes While there is agreement that 22 episodes of The Guard have been produced, the organization into seasons has provided some controversy. Originally, Halifax Film announced a first season consisting of 7 episodes. Halifax announced on October 9, 2008 that season 2 would consist of 15 episodes beginning on 29 October 2008. In the final press kit, it states, \\"The Guard returns with a new season of 15 one-hour episodes on October 29 in its new timeslot Wednesday at 10 PM on Global TV.\\" However, in this same press kit (edited after the series was completed), Halifax Film opts to relabel the episodes for marketing purposes in other markets so that season 1 consists of 13 episodes, while season 2 consists of 9 episodes. Many television viewers, however, regard the most appropriate organization to consist of three seasons. The first season consisting of 7 episodes was shown in the period 22 January 2008 to 4 March 2008. This was followed by a hiatus of 7.5 months where no new programs were shown. The second season consisted of 7 episodes in the period 29 October 2008 to 10 December 2008. Again, there was a hiatus, this time for over five months, until a third season, consisting of 8 episodes, was shown in the period 18 May 2009 to 6 July 2009.

He accepted the English pardon offered to pirates in 1718 but was killed by his own men. History Little is known of Fife‚Äôs early life. Public records show that he was active in early 1718, capturing the sloops Portsmouth and Elizabeth and two others between February and April near the Turks Islands. Fife took his 4-gun, 10-man sloop to Puerto Rico in March to share out money and valuables, including pistols and captured bits of ambergris. Some of his pirates took a small boat to chase down a nearby canoe and Fife sailed away without them: > ...On 14th March last in the evening the sloop being att anchor near > Portorico (an Island belonging to the Spaniards) a conao was espied near the > shoar, whereupon their boat was got ready and all the profest pirates but > three went on board and put off and stood for the conao.

In January 1718 Governor Woodes Rogers of the Bahamas announced a general pardon from King George I for all pirates who surrendered before September 1718. Following the example of Henry Jennings, hundreds of pirates accepted the pardon. Fife and the remaining crew who had left their fellow pirates behind tried to take the pardon as well but were too late and had to await trial. Trial records for members of Fife‚Äôs crew show that he used a number of forced men aboard his vessel, some of which were acquitted of piracy for that reason. Some time after he accepted the 1718 pardon, Fife was reportedly killed by a group of forced men from his crew. See also *John Evans - Another pirate who was killed by his own crew.

On April 1, 1880, the White River opened a line from White Cloud north to Merrill Township, in Newaygo County. In 1881 the line was extended a further to what would become Bitely in 1889. In either late 1883 or no later than February 7, 1884, the White River completed the line all the way to Baldwin, for a total length of . On the completion of the first segment of the line in 1880 the C&WM; had leased the White River for a period of 999 years (effectively in perpetuity). When in 1881 the C&WM; reorganized as the Chicago and West Michigan Railway this arrangement continued. The annual reports filed to the Michigan Railroad Commission listed the White River's trackage with the C&WM; under the White River's own report appeared the banner \\"Controlled and Operated by the Chicago & West Michigan Railway Company.\\" Finally, on February 7, 1884, the C&WM; bought the White River, and it ceased to exist as an independent company. During its short operating history the White River turned a profit, due in large part to lumber revenues; the company issued a dividend in 1882 and never floated a bond, which was unusual for a construction railroad. The White Cloud-Baldwin line survived the cutbacks of the 20th century and as of 2011 is operated by Marquette Rail, a short-line railroad which leased CSX Transportation's Ludington and Manistee Subdivisions on November 12, 2005. Among other commodities, the Marquette Rail hauls paperboard, continuing the White River's old purpose as a lumber road.

Complete testing of a web-based system before going live can help address issues before the system is revealed to the public. Issues may include the security of the web application, the basic functionality of the site, its accessibility to handicapped users and fully able users, its ability to adapt to the multitude of desktops, devices, and operating systems, as well as readiness for expected traffic and number of users and the ability to survive a massive spike in user traffic, both of which are related to load testing.  Web application performance tool  A web application performance tool (WAPT) is used to test web applications and web related interfaces. These tools are used for performance, load and stress testing of web applications, web sites, web API, web servers and other web interfaces. WAPT tends to simulate virtual users which will repeat either recorded URLs or specified URL and allows the users to specify number of times or iterations that the virtual users will have to repeat the recorded URLs. By doing so, the tool is useful to check for bottleneck and performance leakage in the website or web application being tested. A WAPT faces various challenges during testing and should be able to conduct tests for: * Browser compatibility * Operating System compatibility * Windows application compatibility where required WAPT allows a user to specify how virtual users are involved in the testing environment.ie either increasing users or constant users or periodic users load. Increasing user load, step by step is called RAMP where virtual users are increased from 0 to hundreds. Constant user load maintains specified user load at all time. Periodic user load tends to increase and decrease the user load from time to time.

Grady is largely famous for an apocryphal story about his committing four fielding errors on a single play, a story he would repeatedly tell long after his playing days were over; however, there is no contemporaneous record of this ever having occurred, and the story is almost certainly fictional. https://sabr.org/bioproj/person/eabc11fa Grady compiled a .294 career average over his 11 major league seasons. He led the league in OPS (a commonly used stat today that adds on-base percentage with slugging percentage) for a catcher in 1904 and 1905, and finished third in that category in his final season in 1906. All told, Grady finished his career with 884 hits, 35 home runs and 461 RBIs. After a shaky rookie season during which he posted a .900 fielding percentage, he improved his defense considerably, rounding out his career with a .950 mark in that category. He later was a player/manager in 1907 and 1908 in the Tri-State League.

In December 1944, four German paratroopers and a naval cadet escaped from the camp and stole a US Navy LCVP, in which they made their way to the German occupied Channel Islands. There they relayed substantial intelligence on the Allies' disposition in the Granville area, including the fact that several ships were in the harbour discharging coal, which was in short supply in the Channel Islands and the location of US troops. (The former POWs were killed on 25 December, while returning to Germany in a transport plane that was shot down by an Allied night fighter. Also killed in the transport was Korvettenkapit√§n Fritz Breithaupt, a recipient of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and commander of Minensuchflottille 24 [Mine Sweeping Flotilla 24].) The new garrison commander of the Channel Islands, Vizeadmiral Friedrich H√ºffmeier, a former captain of the German battleship Scharnhorst, used the intelligence to plan a raid against the Allies to restore morale to his garrison and obtain needed supplies. On the night of 6‚Äì7 February 1945, a first attempt was aborted, due to a combination of bad weather and the detection of an escorting Schnellboot (\\"E-boat\\"), by US Navy submarine chaser PC-552. =Raid= The raid, led by Kapit√§nleutnant Carl-Friedrich Mohr, was carried out on the night of 8‚Äì9 March. H√ºffmeier's raiding force comprised four large M class minesweepers (M-412, M-432, M-442, M-459), three armed barges (artillery lighters) carrying 8.8 cm guns, three fast motor launches, two small R type minesweepers, and a sea-going tug. As the Germans had received intelligence regarding the identification signals needed to enter the harbour, they were initially able to land unopposed. They damaged the harbour locks and started fires on shore.USN chronology The Germans mined the British-registered merchant freighters Kyle Castle, Nephrite, Parkwood and the Norwegian freighter Heien. The captain of the Kyle Castle, was killed while resisting the Germans, although an officer named Richard Reed remained hidden on the vessel with a shipmate, until after the Germans left. Outside the port, the submarine chaser USS PC-564, raised the alarm and was attacked by German vessels. About 14 US Navy personnel were killed in action on PC-564, others were wounded, its 3-inch gun was disabled and the pilot house destroyed. The captain, Lieutenant Percy Sandel, gave the order to abandon ship, but he and other crew members remained on board, and managed to evade the Germans, before intentionally grounding PC-564 on the shore. Sandel and the remaining crew were later rescued. (PC-564 was salvaged and, renamed USS Chadron, remained on the US naval register until 1963.) At the Hotel des Bains, which housed nine senior US officers, two US Marines resisted the Germans and were killed in action. A Royal Navy officer and five enlisted personnel from the RN were also killed during the raid.until the end. Page 7 Some sources claim that 30 Allied personnel were taken, as prisoners to the Channel Islands, including 15 of those who had earlier abandoned PC-564. Allied resistance caused significant delays to the German raiders. By the time they were ready to depart, the tide was so low that only one captured collier, , containing 112 tonnes of coal, could be taken back to the Channel Islands. It also carried 67 German former prisoners of war who were working in the area and rescued by the raiding party. A German minesweeper, De Schelde (M-412), ran aground, and was scuttled with explosives. =Aftermath= While the charges on the British freighters detonated successfully, all of them remained either afloat, aground or accessible at low tide. Reed and others managed to repair the hull damage on Kyle Castle. While her engines were unusable, she had been anchored outside the port and Reed allowed Kyle Castle to drift to a position south of the Channel Islands. Using hatch covers as makeshift sails, they managed to steer Kyle Castle into the English Channel, where they were received assistance and were towed to Plymouth. Mohr was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on 13 March 1945, while Oberleutnant zur See Otto Karl, who had commanded artillery lighter AF 65, was awarded the Knights Cross on 21 March 1945.Viceadmiral Friedrich H√ºffmeier (Friedrich Hueffmeier) In a later operation, an 18-man German sabotage raid from Jersey landed from rubber boats on Cape de la Hague on 5 April 1945, intending to destroy installations. The mission failed, and the team was captured.Sanders, Paul:The British Channel Islands Under German Occupation, 1940‚Äì1945: 1940 ‚Äì 1945. Soci√©t√© jersiaise, Jersey Heritage Trust. Paul Sanders, 2005. Page 181. A further raid was planned for 7 May 1945, but Admiral Karl D√∂nitz ordered H√ºffmeier not to carry out any more offensive operations so close to the end of the war. Among the notable casualties was Commander Roger Lightoller, a Motor Torpedo Boat skipper and son of Charles Lightoller (the second officer of the RMS Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage), who was killed.

He played for a number of Major League Baseball teams from 1896 to 1908, including the Louisville Colonels, Cleveland Blues, Philadelphia Athletics, St. Louis Browns and Washington Senators. On April 24, 1901, Pickering was the leadoff batter for the Cleveland Blues (precursor to the Indians), which was the visiting team facing the Chicago White Sox in the first game ever played in the American League. The three other games scheduled that day were rained out. Thus, Pickering was the first person to bat in the American League. According to The Cleveland Indians Encyclopedia, based on an account from the Cleveland Plains-Dealer, this transpired: \\"The date was April 24, in Chicago‚Äôs White Sox park (a.k.a. South Side Park), when Ollie Pickering stepped to the plate for the Cleveland Blues. Pickering, an outfielder, hit the second pitch from Chicago White Sox right-hander Roy Patterson to center field. William Hoy, a deaf-mute who was cruelly nicknamed Dummy, caught the routine fly, and with that the American League was officially underway.\\" Chicago went on to win, 8-2. thumb Pickering is also credited with giving baseball the term ‚ÄúTexas leaguer,‚Äù a pejorative slang for a weak pop fly that lands unimpressively between an infielder and an outfielder for a base hit. According to the April 21, 1906, edition of The Sporting Life, John McCloskey, founder of the Texas League and then-manager of the Houston Mudcats ‚Äì who would later go onto manage the St. Louis Cardinals ‚Äì signed 22-year-old Pickering to play center field on the morning of May 21, 1892. That afternoon, Pickering turned in one of the most remarkable performances in the history of the Texas League, stringing together seven consecutive singles in one game, each a soft, looping fly ball that fell in no-man's land between either the first baseman and right fielder or the third baseman and left fielder. News of Pickering‚Äôs feat spread quickly throughout the nation and the term \\"Texas leaguer\\" became ingrained in the baseball lexicon. Pickering‚Äôs seven consecutive singles in a game still stands as a Texas League record. On May 5, 1904, Pickering, playing for the Philadelphia Athletics, twice came close to spoiling Cy Young‚Äôs perfect game for the Boston Americans, the first ever thrown in the American League. Of Pickering‚Äôs performance, author Michael Coffey wrote: ‚ÄúIn the fourth ‚Ä¶ Ollie Pickering looped one into the no-man‚Äôs land beyond the second-base bag ‚Äì in a bid for the kind of hit he made famous ‚Äì only to have center fielder Chick Stahl make a fine running catch. Pickering was almost the spoiler again, with one down in the top of the sixth, when he tapped a slow roller to short, but Freddy Parent charged the ball and nipped Pickering by half a step.‚Äù alt= Pickering played and managed in the minor leagues into his 50s. His playing days ended in 1920 at the age of 50 with the Redfield, SD, Reds. He last managed with the Paducah, KY, Indians in 1922. Upon his retirement from the game, he became an umpire and later retired in Vincennes, Indiana. Pickering's great-great- grandson is NFL side judge Jimmy Russell.

Some fit in the realms of a particular religion, others do not. In general these concepts were uniquely evolved from the Chinese values of filial piety, tacit acknowledgment of the co-existence of the living and the deceased, and the belief in causality and reincarnation, with or without religious overtones.  Practices and beliefs  * Ancestral worship () ‚Äì A practice to honor the deeds and memories of the deceased. This is an extension to the filial piety from the teachings of Confucius and Laozi. Elders, seniors, extended families and particularly parents are to be respected, heeded and looked after. Respects continue after their deaths. In addition to the Qingming and Chongyang festivals, descendants should pay tribute to ancestors during the Zhongyuanjie, more commonly known as the Ghost Festival ( but ghost festival is on Dongzhi \\"‚Äù) In addition to providing a tombstone or urn cover, descendants are traditionally expected to install an altar () in their home to pay homage regularly each day with joss sticks and tea. The ancestors, including parents and grandparents, are worshipped or venerated as if they are still living. * Three Realms () ‚Äì the belief that Heaven, the living and the deceased exist side by side; heaven a place for saints or rested souls, hell for the criminous deceased. Three wun seven pak () explains a person's existence. The three realms is where a person exists, and the seven states are what makes a person exist. The Pumi people, for example, are a supporter of this concept.China.com.cn. \\"China.com.cn.\\" Retrieved on 2010-07-24. * Jian () ‚Äì The living world where people exist in reality is referred to as Yang Jian (). The underworld where spirits exist after death is regarded as Yin Jian (), though this is not necessarily a negative place such as hell. * Fan Tai Sui () ‚Äì is when an individual faces major obstacles in health, job and studies.HKstandard. \\"HKstandard .\\" Rats to lucky number eight.

Hence 2008 in China was one of the most turbulent year with Tibetan unrest, Sichuan earthquake and many more events. Another example is Henry Tang suffering from Fan Tai shui in 2012 where he experienced the illegal basement controversy as well as many other events during the 2012 election. Tang would end up losing the election. * Zung saang gei () ‚Äì is when a piece of hair is placed in a particular fung shui location in an attempt to extend a person's life. A publicised example is Hong Kong actress Tina Leung who performed this practice in 1998 at a place near the Xingdao Lake () in Beihai, Guangxi, China. The maximum that she could extend was 12 years.

This Chinese tradition of automatic writing continues to be practiced in Taoist temples in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China. * Mun mai (ÂïèÁ±≥) ‚Äì is communication directly with spirits who have died. The most common usage is for finding and contacting deceased relatives or loved ones. The general cultural term is that people are raised from the underground or down from heaven to communicate. A western comparison is likely seance or necromancy. * Yum si lou () ‚Äì is the idea of flooding the spiritual road with spiritual money to ensure the person who died will reach their destination safely. In Chinese culture, the road to heaven, diyu or reincarnation may not be clear. By overloading the path with spiritual money, hopefully all troubled souls on the way will be too occupied with the money and leave the traveling-soul alone. This is an assurance for the living. * Villain hitting () ‚Äì is a folk sorcery popular in the Guangdong area of China and Hong Kong used for exorcising.\\"Demon-exorcising Service at 'Goose-neck Bridge' \\" .

This is a category because the composition of two continuous linear maps is again a continuous linear map. The category is often denoted TVect or TVS. Fixing a topological field K, one can also consider the subcategory TVectK of topological vector spaces over K with continuous K-linear maps as the morphisms. TVect is a concrete category Like many categories, the category TVect is a concrete category, meaning its objects are sets with additional structure (i.e. a vector space structure and a topology) and its morphisms are functions preserving this structure. There are obvious forgetful functors into the category of topological spaces, the category of vector spaces and the category of sets. TVectK is a topological category The category is topological, which means loosely speaking that it relates to its \\"underlying category\\", the category of vector spaces, in the same way that Top relates to Set. Formally, for every K-vector space V and every family ( (V_i,\\\\tau_i),f_i)_{i\\\\in I} of topological K-vector spaces (V_i,\\\\tau_i) and K-linear maps f_i: V\\\\to V_i, there exists a vector space topology \\\\tau on V so that the following property is fulfilled: Whenever g: Z\\\\to V is a K-linear map from a topological K-vector space (Z,\\\\sigma), it holds that :g: (Z,\\\\sigma)\\\\to (V,\\\\tau) is continuous \\\\iff \\\\forall i \\\\in I: f_i\\\\circ g: (Z,\\\\sigma)\\\\to(V_i,\\\\tau_i) is continuous. The topological vector space (V,\\\\tau) is called \\"initial object\\" or \\"initial structure\\" with respect to the given data. If one replaces \\"vector space\\" by \\"set\\" and \\"linear map\\" by \\"map\\", one gets a characterisation of the usual initial topologies in Top. This is the reason why categories with this property are called \\"topological\\". There are numerous consequences of this property. For example: * \\"Discrete\\" and \\"indiscrete\\" objects exist. A topological vector space is indiscrete iff it is the initial structure with respect to the empty family. A topological vector space is discrete iff it is the initial structure with respect to the family of all possible linear maps into all topological vector spaces. (This family is a proper class, but that does not matter: Initial structures with respect to all classes exists iff they exists with respect to all sets) * Final structures (the similar defined analogue to final topologies) exist. But there is a catch: While the initial structure of the above property is in fact the usual initial topology on V with respect to (\\\\tau_i,f_i)_{i\\\\in I}, the final structures do not need to be final with respect to given maps in the sense of Top. For example: The discrete objects (= final with respect to the empty family) in \\\\textbf{TVect}_K do not carry the discrete topology. * Since the following diagram of forgetful functors commutes ::\\\\begin{array}{ccc} \\\\textbf{Vect}_K & \\\\rightarrow & \\\\textbf{Set} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\uparrow & & \\\\uparrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\textbf{TVect}_K & \\\\rightarrow & \\\\textbf{Top} \\\\end{array} :and the forgetful functor from \\\\textbf{Vect}_K to Set is right adjoint, the forgetful functor from \\\\textbf{TVect}_K to Top is right adjoint too (and the corresponding left adjoints fit in an analogue commutative diagram). This left adjoint defines \\"free topological vector spaces\\". Explicitly these are free K-vector spaces equipped with a certain initial topology. * Since \\\\textbf{Vect}_K is (co)complete, \\\\textbf{TVect}_K is (co)complete too.

It has a long eel-like body and is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Its bite can be dangerous to humans. Appearance and characteristics alt=Photo of undulating moray on top of a coral colony The Mediterranean moray has an elongated, eel-like body and can reach a length of 1.5 meters and weigh over 15 kilograms. Its coloration varies from dark grey to dark brown with fine dark spots. The skin is slimy and without scales. The dorsal fin begins behind its head and continues to the caudal fin (fused with the anal fin). Pectoral fins are absent, teeth are long and sharp-pointed (like other morays), the mouth is long and robust and reaches behind the gills. Ecology Captured morays on fishmarket in Madeira The Mediterranean moray inhabits the coastal waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean from the British Isles to the coast of Senegal; the waters of the Canary Islands and the Azores; and the Mediterranean Sea. It prefers rocky bottoms and lives in depths of from 16.5 to 264 feet (5 to 80 meters). It is a solitary and territorial species. The Mediterranean moray spends most of the day in cavities and clefts between rocks and is more active at night. It hunts fish, crayfish and cephalopods, but also feeds on dead animals. The Mediterranean moray's reproduction is not well known. They spawn about 60,000 eggs into open water, from which planktonic transparent leptocephali hatch.

The plane crashed in the Fairview area near Five Points West in the Ensley neighborhood and subsequently injured four persons on the ground, as well as destroying two homes. Of the 15 occupants on board, there were 13 fatalities. The cause of the crash was attributed to the captain's decision to attempt an instrument approach into severe thunderstorms resulting in a loss of control of the airplane.NTSB/AAR-92/01 NTSB Aircraft Accident Report, L'Express Airlines, Inc. Flight 508 To date it is the deadliest commercial aviation accident in Alabama history. Flight L'Express Flight 508 was operated with a Beech C99 twin-engine turboprop aircraft. Seating on the plane was five rows of two seats, one on each side of a central aisle. A single seat was located across from the left passenger loading door and a double seat at the rear of the aircraft. Passengers boarded through the rear passenger door. The flight left New Orleans, LA with one passenger, at 4:05 pm CDT, landing in Mobile, AL, at 4:50 pm CDT. After changing crews and boarding 12 passengers, the flight departed for Birmingham Municipal Airport at 5:05 pm CDT. As the flight approached Birmingham, strong thunderstorms developed in the vicinity of the airport. Around the same time four other aircraft either diverted to other airports or delayed their approach and entered a holding pattern until the weather improved. The crew of Flight 508 was aware of the thunderstorm activity but elected to continue the approach. Francis Fernandes, the L'Express captain at the controls of Flight 508, later said the plane experienced a \\"significant roll to the left\\" on landing approach. Fernandes told investigators that while he and the first officer tried to level the aircraft, it experienced an \\"extreme updraft\\" that pushed the plane's nose into the air.Pilots Struggled to Control Plane in Storm Before Crash; The Washington Post, July 12, 1991 After entering a severe thunderstorm cell southwest of the airport, the crew lost directional control and was unable to recover the aircraft prior to impacting two houses in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham at 6:11:27 pm CDT. The airplane struck one home, crossed a tree lined residential street, and slammed into a second home, immediately erupting into flames. The lone surviving passenger was encountered in the home by the residents before all fled the burning home. The captain was taken to UAB Hospital, passenger Mabry Rogers to Carraway Methodist Medical Center, and three residents to Baptist Princeton. Twelve passengers and the first officer perished in the crash; the captain, one passenger, and four residents were injured. Media coverage The accident occurred during the 6:00 p.m. local evening news broadcasts. Local media reports began around 6:45 pm CDT with local ABC television affiliate WBRC broadcasting live by 6:45 pm CDT. Radio and television coverage continued through the night. Notably, WBRC was recording weather radar images around the time of the crash, these images would later be used in the official NTSB investigation and other crash-related litigation. Coverage of the crash was carried on the front page of newspapers nationwide in the days following the accident. NTSB investigation The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched a team to investigate the accident. The focus of the investigation was immediately centered on the weather at the time of the accident. Investigators were surprised by the presence of a cockpit voice recorder in the airplane as such recorders were not required for the involved airplane at the time. Following a detailed investigation, the NTSB issued its final report on March 3, 1992; AAR-92/01. The formal probable cause of the accident was \\"the decision of the captain to initiate and continue an instrument approach into clearly identified thunderstorm activity, resulting in a loss of control of the airplane from which the flightcrew was unable to recover and subsequent collision with obstacles and the terrain.\\" Survivors The only survivors of the crash were the captain, Francis Fernandez of Niceville, Florida and a passenger from Birmingham, Alabama.

Tip mentions Enchanted Bluff, a rock surrounded by a plain in New Mexico, where Native Americans used to live before the Spaniards came along. Once, the men were down the rock hunting and an army party killed them. The women and children starved to death on the rock, as an \\"awful storm\\" or waterspout had destroyed the stairs needed to go down the rock. The boys eventually get back to their house, and later talk about their plan to go there. Years later, none of them ever made it to the Enchanted Bluff. Percy is a stockbroker in Kansas City; Otto worked on the railway and has now taken up his father's tailor shop with his brother; Arthur had done nothing with his life.

He was proudest of his work as a publisher. The publishing house Contraponto, his creation, released works by many previously unpublished Portuguese writers (Herberto Helder, Nat√°lia Correia, M√°rio Cesariny de Vasconcelos, Verg√≠lio Ferreira, Ant√≥nio Maria Lisboa), and introduced Sade to the Portuguese readers. Morreu Luiz Pacheco , P√∫blico Morreu Luiz Pacheco , SIC Life He was born in an old house at Rua da Estef√¢nia in the S√£o Sebasti√£o da Pedreira district. His father was a civil servant and an amateur musician. Only child of a middle-class family with roots in Alentejo, soon Luiz Pacheco had read all the books of his family considerable-sized library. Since early age he was asthmatic and short-sighted, and later in his life it became impossible for him to read, something rather cruel to anyone, but in particular to a person who needed to read to feel sane. He was arrested twice while a minor for romantic involvements with young girls. He compulsively married one of these girls who became pregnant when he was 18 years old. She was 15 years old. After one year, he turned to her younger sister. The three of them lived together during a spell, with all his children. It was then that he wrote A Comunidade (The Community), his centrepiece; it portrays that period. His women were always his intellectual inferiors, the first two were peasants. He loved to teach them to read. He had eight children from three different wives. He studied in Cam√µes high school, being the best student of his year, and later he was enrolled at the Faculdade de Letras of the University of Lisbon, dropping out due to financial troubles. M√°rio Soares, Urbano Tavares Rodrigues and Artur Ramos were his classmates. He used to say his highschool grade was 18 (out of 20), while Urbano Tavares Rodrigues‚Äô was 12. Urbano, a somewhat popular Portuguese writer, was one of Pacheco's ‚Äòfavourite enemies‚Äô. After dropping out from the University of Lisbon, Pacheco decided to become an autodidact, and he did manage it. He was a compulsive reader and always had an analytic point of view, as one could see from some of his books, always underlined and with his own comments. In 1946 he got a job at the state-run Inspec√ß√£o Geral de Espect√°culos as a fiscal for theatre plays, music shows and movies. Some people say he was a censor, but nothing could be farther away from the truth. In fact, he saw this as an opportunity to watch plays and films for free. There was never a single play or movie prohibited or altered due to his action. This was perhaps a way to antagonize the dictatorship he always condemned with all his strengths. But then he decided that he couldn't take it and left. Since that time he never had a proper job again. He wrote articles for newspapers and magazines, including O Globo, Bloco, Afinidades, O Volante, Di√°rio Ilustrado, Di√°rio Popular and Seara Nova, he made translations, and was an excellent proof reader. A libertine, always living through hardships, he depended on his friends' good will; he used to classify them according to the amount of money he could borrow from them each time. He sold books and pamphlets edited by Contraponto for survival. When there was money to spend he was extremely generous toward his friends and people in need. During the years of financial instability, he lived in many houses, rented rooms, pensions, all over the country, and many important documents have been lost in these constant moves. Charismatic places for Pacheco, where he wrote many of his works were Caldas da Rainha and Set√∫bal, but, as he once said, being away from Lisbon blurred his view and critical sense. He never had an affiliation to any political party, although in his late years he publicly asked the Portuguese Communist Party to accept him, because he wanted to be warm when he died, and what better than the Party's flag! This irreverent posture, always laughing at stupidity, made his life a living hell. But he couldn't live it any other way. A dedicated literary and cultural critic, he became famous (and feared) for his sarcastic and irreverent critical writings. He denounced intellectual dishonesty and the censorship imposed by Salazar's Estado Novo regime. Tall, thin and skinny, bald, wearing eyeglasses with thick lenses, dressing second-hand clothes (sometimes ragged and undersized ones), hypersensitive to alcohol (he enjoyed red wine and beer), hypochondriac, always foreseeing his own death (due to asthma and a poor heart condition), cynical but honest, paradoxical, he is a worthy heir of Lu√≠s de Cam√µes, Bocage, Gomes Leal or Fernando Pessoa. Writings Luiz Pacheco published many of his writings in Contraponto, mainly short stories and critical texts concerning Portuguese literature. He wrote thousands of letters to friends with enormous literary value and many of them were published in different books. Comunidade, O Libertino passeia por Braga, a idol√°trica, o seu esplendor and Teodolito are his most acclaimed books. Pacheco versus Cesariny is an 'epistolary novel' of the surrealist movement in Portugal. His frontal way of analysing works was feared by many. Fernando Namora, a known Portuguese writer, is an example of this: Luiz Pacheco heard about some coincidences between two books by Fernando Namora and Virgilio Ferreira. Deciding to decipher the mystery, he bought every edition of the two books he could lay his hands on and compared them in order to find the coincidences and who copied whom. The result was published by the name of O Caso do Son√¢mbulo Chupista. Most of his books are currently not available in book stores. Here is an incomplete list of his published works. * Hist√≥ria antiga e conhecida (1956) - republished in ‚ÄòCr√≠tica de circunst√¢ncia‚Äô in 2002 as ‚ÄòOs doutores, a salva√ß√£o e o menino Jesus‚Äô * Caca, cuspo & Ramela (1958)- with Nat√°lia Correia and Manuel de Lima * Carta-Sincera a Jos√© Gomes Ferreira (1959) * O Teodolito (1962) * Comunidade (1964) * Coro de esc√°rnio e lamenta√ß√£o dos cornudos em volta de S.Pedro (1966) * Cr√≠tica de Circunst√¢ncia (1966) * Textos Locais (1967) * O Libertino Passeia por Braga, a Idol√°trica, o Seu Esplendor (1970) * Exerc√≠cios de estilo (1971) * Literatura comest√≠vel (1972) * Pacheco versus Cesariny - folhetim de fei√ß√£o epistologr√°fica (1974) * Textos de Circunst√¢ncia (1977) * Carta a Gonelha (1977) * Textos Malditos (1977) * Textos de Guerrilha 1 (1979) * O Caso das Criancinhas Desaparecidas (1981) * Textos de Guerrilha 2 (1981) * Textos do Barro (1985) * O Teodolito e a velha casa (1985) * Textos Sadinos (1991) * Carta a F√°tima (1992) * O uivo do coiote (1992) * Memorando, Mirabolando (1995) * Cartas na mesa: 1966-1996 (1996) * Prazo de validade (1998) * Isto de estar vivo (2000) * Uma admir√°vel droga (2001) * Mano forte (2002) * Os doutores, a salva√ß√£o e o menino Jesus (2002) * Raio de Luar (2003) * Figuras, figurantes e figur√µes (2004) * Di√°rio remendado 1971-1975 (2005) * Cartas ao l√©u (2005) * O crocodilo que voa (2008) - interviews =Dictionnaire Philosophique translation= Circa 1965, Luiz Pacheco's friend Bruno da Ponte asked him for help translating volume one of Voltaire's Dictionnaire Philosophique. Even though Pacheco was paid in advance for the job, he missed the deadline without completing any of the work assigned to him. After much pressure from Bruno da Ponte, he began typing away his translation as he read from the book, but not having a dictionary at hand, he decided to temporarily replace every word he didn't know with a vulgarism in red ink. Unfortunately, he forgot about it and the draft was rushed to print without being proofed by either translator or the editor. The printers obediently set every word given to them and, as it was common practice, used italics for those words typed in red. Pacheco eventually realised he had forgotten to take out the vulgarisms and raced to the printers in time to halt production of the book. However, his revisions weren't thorough enough, and the first edition of the book still came out with a footnote on page 273 bearing reference to \\"delicious shit sandwiches\\". , directed by Ant√≥nio Jos√© de Almeida, RTP Voltaire, Dicion√°rio Filos√≥fico -- 1.¬∫ Volume, trans.

Before this time, Zealandia shared its past with Australia and Antarctica. Since this separation, the New Zealand biota and landscape has evolved in near-isolation. The exclusively natural history of the country ended in about 1300 AD, when humans first settled, and the country's environmental history began. The period from 1300 AD to today coincides with the extinction of many of New Zealand's unique species that had evolved there. The break-up of Gondwana left the resulting continents, including Zealandia, with a shared ecology. Zealandia began to move away from the part of Gondwana which would become Australia and Antarctica approximately 85 million years ago (Ma). By about 70 Ma, the break up was complete.PDF Trewick SA, Morgan-Richards M. 2009 New Zealand Biology. Pages 665‚Äì673 in Encyclopedia of Islands (Eds R.G. Gillespie and D.A. Clague). University of California Press, Berkeley. Zealandia has been moving northwards ever since, changing both in relief and climate. The present biota of New Zealand does include descendants of Gondwanan lineages, but has lost many others, such as the Saint Bathans mammal, and has received many immigrant populations.Wallis, GP, Jorge, F. Going under down under? Lineage ages argue for extensive survival of the Oligocene marine transgression on Zealandia. Mol Ecol. 2018; 27: 4368‚Äì 4396. https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14875 Several elements of Gondwana biota are present in New Zealand today: predominantly plants, such as the podocarps and the southern beeches, but also distinctive insects, birds, frogs and the tuatara. In the Duntroonian stage of the Oligocene, the land area of Zealandia was at a minimum. It has been suggested that water covered all of it, but the consensus is that low-lying islands remained, perhaps a quarter of the modern land area of New Zealand.Oligocene paleogeography of New Zealand: maximum marine transgression. DC Mildenhall, N Mortimer, KN Bassett, and EM Kennedy. New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics, 2014 Vol. 57, No. 2, 107‚Äì109, http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288306.2014.904387 Accessed 25 April 2020  Before the split (Gondwana, 85 million years ago)  Zealandia (lower right), between Australia and Antarctica near the South Pole, 90 million years ago. The present position of New Zealand is outlined in white (centre left). In the late Cretaceous, Gondwana was a fraction of its original size, however, the landmasses that would become Australia, Antarctica and Zealandia were still attached. Most of the modern 'Gondwanan fauna' had its origin in the Cretaceous. During this time Zealandia was temperate and almost flat, with no alpine environments. = Gondwanan fauna = Fossils found at Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, suggest that 110 million years ago (Ma), Australia supported a number of different monotremes, but did not support any marsupials. Marsupials appear to have evolved during the Cretaceous in the contemporary northern hemisphere, to judge from a 100-million-year-old marsupial fossil, Kokopellia, found in the badlands of Utah. Marsupials would then have spread to South America and Gondwana. The first evidence of mammals (both marsupials and placental) in Australia comes from the Tertiary, and was found at a 55-million-year-old fossil site at Murgon, in southern Queensland. As Zealandia had rifted away at this time it explains the lack of ground dwelling marsupials and placental mammals in New Zealand's fossil record. Dinosaurs continued to prosper but, as the angiosperms diversified, conifers, bennettitaleans and pentoxylaleans disappeared from Gondwana 115 Ma together with the specialised herbivorous ornithischians, whilst generalist browsers, such as several families of sauropodomorph Saurischia, prevailed. The Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event killed off all dinosaurs except birds, but plant evolution in Gondwana was hardly affected. Gondwanatheria is an extinct group of non-therian mammals with a Gondwanan distribution (South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, and Antarctica) during the Late Cretaceous and Palaeogene. Xenarthra and Afrotheria, two placental clades, are of Gondwanan origin and probably began to evolve separately when Africa and South America separated. = Gondwanan flora = The plant genus Nothofagus provides a good example of a taxon with a Gondwanan distribution, having originated in the supercontinent and existing in present-day Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, and South America's Southern Cone Angiosperms evolved in northern Gondwana/southern Laurasia during the Early Cretaceous and radiated worldwide. The southern beeches, Nothofagus, are prominent members of this early angiosperm flora. The Late Cretaceous pollen record show that some types of flora evolved across Gondwana, while others originated in Antarctica and spread to Australia. Fossils of Nothofagus have also recently been found in Antarctica. The laurel forests of Australia, New Caledonia, and New Zealand have a number of species related to those of the laurissilva of Valdivia, through the connection of the Antarctic flora. These include gymnosperms and the deciduous species of Nothofagus, as well as the New Zealand laurel, Corynocarpus laevigatus, and Laurelia novae-zelandiae. At this time Zealandia was mostly covered in forests of podocarps, araucarian pines and ferns.  Rafting away (latest Cretaceous 85‚Äì66 Ma)  The remains of Gondwana 83 Ma, with Zealandia lower left Plesiosaur (Kaiwhekea), 7 metres long and lived around 70‚Äì69 million years ago in the seas around Zealandia. The Australia-New Zealand continental part of Gondwana split from Antarctica in the late Cretaceous (95‚Äì90 Ma). This was followed by Zealandia separating from Australia (c.85 Ma). The split started from the Southern end and eventually formed the Tasman Sea. By about 70 Ma, the continental crust of Zealandia separate from Australia and Antarctica. However, it is unknown when the division of land above sea level occurred and for some time only shallow seas would have separated Zealandia and Australia in the north. Dinosaurs continued to live in New Zealand and had about had 10‚Äì20 million years to evolve unique species after it separated from Gondwana. In the Cretaceous, New Zealand was much further south (c.80 degrees south) than it is today, however, it and much of Antarctica was covered in trees as the climate of 90 Ma was much warmer and wetter than today. New Zealand's present native fauna does not contain land mammals (other than bats) or snakes. Neither marsupials nor placental mammals evolved in time to reach Australia before the split. The multituberculates, a primitive type of mammal, may have evolved in time to cross to New Zealand using the land bridge. The evolution and dispersal of snakes is less certain, due to their poor fossil record, it is uncertain as to whether they were in Australia before the opening of the Tasman Sea. Ratites evolved around c. 80 ma and may have been present in Zealandia at this time.  Swamps and rifting (Paleocene to Eocene 66 to 33.9 Ma)  At the start of the Paleocene New Zealand's biota was recovering from the extinction of dinosaurs and those species which survived were expanding into the empty niches. There was a slight decrease in mean temperature at the start of the Paleocene leading to a change in canopy species. Zealandia was largely covered by shallow seas with low-lying land and swamps. The oldest penguin fossil in the world and various other sea birds are found in New Zealand from this time. The Tasman sea continued to expand until the early Eocene (53 Ma). The western half of Zealandia then along with Australia formed the Australian Plate (40 Ma). In response to this a new plate boundary was created within Zealandia between the Australian Plate and Pacific Plate. This led to the formation of a subduction arc with active volcanism forming islands north and west of present New Zealand.New Zealand splits from Gondwana from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand New Zealand was low lying due to this extension and swamps became widespread. Today these are recorded as large coal seams in the geological record. The isolation of Antarctica and formation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current is credited by many researchers with causing the glaciation of Antarctica and global cooling in the Eocene epoch. Oceanic models have shown that the opening of these two passages limited polar heat convergence and caused a cooling of sea surface temperatures by several degrees; other models have shown that CO2 levels also played a significant role in the glaciation of Antarctica. Published estimates of the onset of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current vary, but it is commonly considered to have started at the Eocene/Oligocene boundary. Whales were completely marine creatures by 40 Ma, while New Zealand oldest whale fossils are from 35 Ma.  New Zealand's shallow seas (Oligocene 33.9 to 23 Ma)  New Zealand before the activation of the Alpine Fault (30 Ma) From the early Oligocene, at maximum submersion of the Zealandia landmass, almost all New Zealand's rocks are marine. Oligocene terrestrial sediments are few, scattered, and not well-dated. It has been suggested that at some point, Zealandia was entirely underwater, and consequently all land biota would be descended from later immigrants. Molecular estimates of divergence times between 248 extant New Zealand lineages and their closest relatives elsewhere follow approximately a smooth exponential over the last 50 million years or more. Some 74 of these lineages appear to have survived the Oligocene in New Zealand. There is no evidence for a deficit of pre-Oligocene lineages, nor an excess of lineages arriving just afterwards. This strongly suggests that New Zealand was never submerged completely. Although there is no obvious peak of lineage extinction in the Oligocene, the limited diversity of mitochondrial DNA in kiwis, moas, and New Zealand wrens indicate that all three lineages underwent a genetic bottleneck (small effective populations) roughly coinciding with the maximum submersion; New Zealand at this time probably consisted of low-lying islands with a limited diversity of habitats. Significant uplift occurred by the mid- Oligocene (~32‚Äì29 Ma) in the modern Canterbury Basin, where palaeochannels eroded through the early Oligocene Amuri Limestone lead eastwards to the present Bounty Trough.Andrea Barrier, Andrew Nicol, Greg H. Browne, Kari Bassett. Marine Geology Volume 418, December 2019. Early Oligocene marine canyon-channel systems: Implications for regional paleogeography in the Canterbury Basin, New Zealand. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.margeo.2019.106037 Available online 29 August 2019. Accessed 25 April 2020 The North and South island have been separate for most of the last 30 million years allowing for the development of separate sub species.  The Southern Alps, Foulden Maar and Saint Bathans Fauna (Miocene - Pliocene 23 to 2.6 Ma)  Major uplift occurred on the Alpine Fault, which started to form the hills and the mountains that became the Southern Alps. This reconstruction of the lake at Foulden Maar 23 million years ago was commissioned by palaeontologist Dr Daphne Lee and drawn by artist/ecologist Dr Paula Peeters. Foulden Maar a maar-diatreme volcano preserved a high diversity of freshwater fish, arthropods, plants and fungi at a lake 23 Ma. It is the only known maar of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere and is one of New Zealand's pre-eminent fossil sites. The fossil evidence derived from pollen and spores suggests a warm temperate or sub-tropical rain forest with canopy trees, with an understorey of shrubs, ferns and on the margins pioneer species. Climatically, the area resembled modern-day south-eastern Queensland a humid sub-tropical zone with species that no longer occur in the New Zealand flora. The lake contained small and large galaxiid fishes and eels, ducks (inferred from coprolites), and likely crocodiles as well. A restoration of Dinornis robustus (the moa), and Pachyornis elephantopus, both from the South Island. The Saint Bathans Fauna represents a detailed record of New Zealand's terrestrial life in the Miocene. It shows that small land mammals and crocodile existed and have since become extinct. The earliest moa remains come from the Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna. Known from multiple eggshells and hindlimb elements, these represent at least two species of already fairly large sized species. The boundaries defining the Pliocene are not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer Miocene and the relatively cooler Pliocene. The upper boundary was set at the start of the Pleistocene glaciations. Uplift intensified on the Alpine Fault forming the Southern Alps. This global cooling coupled with an increase in elevation led to the local extinction of many groups of plants, which are now still found in New Caledonia. The new niches created in the mountains were filled with migrants from Australia and those species which could quickly evolve.  The Taupo Volcanic Zone and ice age (Pleistocene - Holocene 2.6 Ma to today)  The ice age began 2.6 Ma, at the start of the Pleistocene epoch, and is defined by the presence of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. During the warmer periods sea level was higher than today leading to raised beaches around New Zealand. New Zealand's flora is still recovering from the last glacial maximum. About 2 Ma, extension and subduction under the North Island formed the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Leading to the central North Island being covered in cobalt deficient soils which restrict forest development. One of the largest eruptions being the Lake Taupo eruption of 186 AD. Since the last glacial maximum there have been three major climatic periods the coldest period from 28‚Äì18,000 years ago, an intermediate period from 18‚Äì11,000 years ago and our current climatic condition the warmer Holocene Inter Glacial over the last 11,000 years. In the first period global sea levels were about lower than today. This made most of New Zealand a single island and exposed great sections of the currently submerged continental shelf. Temperatures were about 4‚Äì5 ¬∞C lower than today. Much of the Southern Alps and Fiordland were glaciated and much of the rest of New Zealand was covered in grass or shrubs, due to the cold and dry climate.New Zealand during the last glacial maximum from Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand These vast tracks of exposed land with little vegetation cover increased wind erosion and the deposition of loess (windblown dust). This deforestation led to a reduction in the forest cover and many canopy species were restricted to the northern areas of the country. The Kauri was at the time only present in Northland but has progressively moved south from there over the last 7000 years, reaching its current limit about 2000 years ago.

The tradition that Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus Christ) lived in India is followed by around one thousand Nizariun devotees of Maryam's son Isa, who live in several scattered villages in northwestern Afghanistan, centered on Herat. This was first discovered by Burke, who personally interviewed their spiritual leader, Abba Yahiyya (Father John), while researching Ishmaili Sufism in the area.Omar Michael Burke, Among the Dervishes (London: Octagon Press, 1976) 107.

Angevine, I'm a Muslim and Jesus is my Lord: Muslims for Jesus, Bloomington: 1stBooks, 2003  Overview  In Among the Dervishes, author Burke records that in Herat he encountered around a thousand Nizariun Sufis who followed the teachings of \\"Isa, son of Maryam.\\" Their chief, Abba Yahiyya or Father John, was able to recite a succession of Mages through sixty generations back to the Rock and finally \\"Isa, son of Mary, of Nazara, the Kashmiri.\\" These clerics were partnered to \\"sadiqin\\" in India belonging to the house of Amram and Harun's line, which may be a reference to the Aga Khan, all the way back to Isa's maternal relatives Jakub Assadiq, Yahiyya and Zakariya. According to their tradition, their Magian ancestors had been seduced by the anti-namus dualism of Nasiruta until the Rock's missionaries came to guide their apostasy from Nasiruta back towards the siratulmustaqim, considering themselves a direct continuation of the pre- Islamic Sabiah Hunafa. The essential differences from other Ishmaelis are that they regard Muhammed as nothing more than a title for the chief Mages (the ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿ¶ who may be male or female) in their magisterium of ÿ•ÿÆŸàÿßŸÜ, which continues the roles of the nabi and observe a sabbath from Friday nights and whose responsibility is to protect the identity of the 36 pairs of Zealot families and their priestly kahan Azwajrasul, from the general laity through a system of social eligibility rules concerning courtship. The Traditions of the Masih (arranged and translated by Harvard University Press) is the holy book of the community which they say completes the injeel, the Gospels being only part of the truth. Burke describes Abba Yahiyya as \\"a towering figure with the face of a saint,\\" an erudite man who knows his own scriptures and the Jewish writings. Father Yahiyya considered the various sects of Christians known to us today as heretics. Every celebratory occasion is marked by a festive meal called Al- Maeda, which always commences with a breaking bread blessing, and concludes with a thanksgiving toast although they do not drink wine. They carry daggers which are never drawn, use bathing garments, grow their hair long and wear turbans like the Sikhs. Ramadaan and Hajj are considered to occur at the right time (winter and spring respectively) for three years in a row at intervals of 33 years. At such a Hajj, Alenzar vows are fulfilled with sacrifices, headshaving, free-association and edible vine products.

The canal along its main artery is long but has additional of minor arteries. Its construction lasted 15 years and was directed by the engineer Franz Mayor de Montricher; the canal opened on July 8, 1849. The canal was a significant achievement of 18th-century engineering, combining bridges, tunnels and reservoirs over mountainous terrain. Until 1970, it was almost the sole water source for Marseille, and it still provides two thirds of the city's drinking water. The canal as it leaves the Roquefavour Aqueduct. History Marseille is along the hilly Mediterranean seafront and is crossed only by the irregular Huveaune River and its tributary, the . The waters were canalised in the 14th century but gradually became an open sewer.The Jarret was completely covered in the 20th century.source: Mus√©um de Marseille Water quality continued to decline, and distribution suffered because of the lack of maintenance of the network.source : Mus√©um de Marseille Also, since the river has only a small flow, droughts were devastating to the region. For example, in 1834, the river nearly dried out completely, and only was available per person, per day.Museum of Marseille In the 1830s, Marseille began to experience rapid population growth and an epidemic in 1832 to 1835 of cholera convinced the elected officials to act to restore health and to ensure enough water for the city. The river left This cholera epidemic caused the death of 100,000 people throughout France.The 1830s French cholera epidemic is described by Jean Giono in his novel Le Hussard sur le toit. Originally from Asia, the disease spread along the Ganges Valley in 1826 and the Caspian and Volga in 1829. In 1830, the disease overtook Moscow and Poland and, in 1833, Hamburg. In March 1832, cholera reached Paris, and 18,000 died, and the eipedemic killed many people in Haute-Provence. In July 1833, the epidemic reached Marseille. By December 1834, the death toll had been 865, and in 1835, it was 2,500. Fears were revived of the Great Plague of Marseille, just over a century earlier, which had caused around 100,000 deaths. In July 1833, a gathering of 30,000 residents in the city centre protested the poor sanitary conditions.From Les malheurs des Temps, histoire des fl√©aux en France (The misfortunes of time, history of plagues in France), n.d.

However, the river was far and separated from the city by mountain chains (cha√Æne des C√¥tes, plateau de l'Arbois, massif de l'√âtoile). The plan had water to be captured quite high on the Durance and gravity to be harnessed to overcome the terrain so that water would arrive in Marseille at the highest point of the city, Saint-Antoine (), thus allowing water to serve the whole city. Construction The building of the canal took 15 years, from 1839 to 1854, and covered , of which being underground. The canal also crosses 18 bridges. The Roquefavour Aqueduct, near Aix-en-Provence. The canal crossing the Roquefavour Aqueduct. Indeed, a major challenge was passing the canal over the valley of the Arc, which has an altitude of less than between Aix-en-Provence and the Etang de Berre. The project's chief engineer, Franz Mayor de Montricher, rejected the proposal of a bridge trap and decided instead to build an aqueduct where the escarpments on both sides of the valley were closest, at . That would become the Roquefavour Aqueduct at Ventabren, inspired by the Roman architectural work Pont du Gard. Since then, the Roquefavour Aqueduct, long, has been regarded as one of the main tourist attractions of Aix-en-Provence. The canal is mostly concrete, but some portions are made of stone or brick. The canal's flow is per second, and the slope is per . The width at the top is , and the width at the basin is . Water began flowing through the partly-finished canal on November 19, 1849 in Marseille. Between 1854 and 1869, of pipes, tanks and basins were constructed, allowing access to water throughout Marseille and the neighboring communes of Plan-de-Cuques, Allauch and Aubagne. Although the population over the next 40 years, Marseille in 1876 had over 30 times more water per capita: for domestic usage and for industrial activities, daily. Through Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne The canal entering a tunnel near Coudoux The initial intake of the canal from the Durance was at the Pertuis Bridge in the Vaucluse at an elevation of and from Marseille. From there, the canal travels west to Lew Puy-Sainte-R√©parade and then northwest to Saint-Est√®ve-Janson. Then the canal continues north-west to the bridge Cadenet, where it feeds the pondSt. Christopher. thumb The route then clings to the hills, passes over La Roque-d'Anth√©ron and Charleval, exits the Durance and EDF, turns to the south and finally enters a long tunnel under the west end of the cha√Æne des C√¥tes, a mountain range. After Lambesc, the canal's path becomes more complex: many bridges and tunnels are required to travel the valleys and near Coudoux. The canal travels around the hill of Ventabren, and comes to the River Arc, where it enters the Roquefavour Aqueduct. Near this area, the Paris-Marseille high speed railway line passes it, and the railway bridge structure has been designed to harmonize with the aqueduct. thumb A tunnel crosses under the southern Arbois plain until the canal enters the treatment plant Giraudets. Finally, the water flows into a entrance lead into Marseille. Present day=Water quality= The water treatment plant, in Saint-Barnab√© in the 12th arrondissement of Marseille. The canal is no longer the sole water source for Marseille. The Canal de Provence, almost completely underground, is a network of canals from the Verdon River built in the 1970s that now brings water to not only Marseille but also Aix-en-Provence and Toulon. Today, that water is approximately two thirds of the water brought into Marseille, the remaining third comes from the Verdon through Provence.Water People in Marseille str ... 78 Both sources are connected. The water is treated in two water treatment facilities: Sainte-Marthe and Saint-Barnab√©. The main operations performed by the treatment facilities are pre-chlorination, clarification by flocculation with a coagulant, sand filtration and disinfection with ozone and chlorine. In 2006, the health authority of Marseille carried out a number of tests on the water quality, determining that the canal's water conformed to all required norms. In 2009, a young mother and her baby where found dead in their apartment: the culprit was chlorine gas from the water supply. That led to a citywide survey of the gasses in system but not before others were admitted to hospitals from all over the city.Rapport 2007 sur la qualit√© des eaux, Ville de Marseille - Voir le site en ligne de la SEM ici et le renvoi sur les rapports d'analyses de la DDASS =Administration= The canal was operated by the City of Marseille from 1849 to 1941. However, the destructive fire of the store \\"Nouvelles Galeries\\" in November 1938 in which 73 people died, the city government was put under trusteeship, and the operation of the canal was entrusted to the (SEEM) () and Raoul Dautry, who had assisted in the creation of the SNCF and was named the first president. Since then, SEEM, owned equally by Veolia Environnement and Lyonnais des eaux, has controlled the canal's operation. =Support and maintenance= Upon entering the treatment facility at Sainte-Marthe in the 14th arrondissement, the canal water is filtered at the bassin du Merlan before it exits the structure to enter the distribution network of Marseille. However, the canal is for more than sanitary purposes. Historically, the structure assisted in irrigating fields for farmers and gardeners and greatly boosted the growth of gardening in the area. The canal's offshoot irrigation ditches are controlled by the aygadiers,de aygo : eau en proven√ßal who have the right to cross private property ito assist in the repair and operation of the canal. The focus of SEEM and the aygadiers has recently been on centring the use of the canal on drinking water. Therefore, irrigation rights are not being renewed, and the city is providing pressurised water instead. Furthermore, the canal authority employs 15 chercheurs de fuite (French: literally \\"searchers of leaks\\"), who are responsible for finding leaks in the distribution system. To help them, they use geophones, which amply sound up to 400 times. Employees have allowed the efficiency of the canal to raise to 85%.L'eau dans Les gens de Marseille..., p 79 =Security= The canal in Marseille (Saint-Barnab√©, 12th arr.) The canal outside Marseille proper is open to the air and can be followed along the road except for the underground sections. However, within the city limits, efforts are being made to cover the canal, prompted by safety concerns over the unpredictable nature of the water's flow following valve openings and the steep and slippery walls. In addition, there are ongoing campaigns aimed at adding fences, lifelines and barriers and posting warning signs along the canal's route =As tourist site and cultural attraction= left The canal passes through many picturesque regions of Provence and contains bicycle and walking paths along its route. Notable remarkable sites include: * The aqueduc de Roquefavour, near Aix-en- Provence ; * The palais Longchamp, an historic monument in the center of Marseille ; * The r√©servoir de Sainte-Marthe ; * The banks of the canal along the Plateau d'Arbois. Marcel Pagnol French novelist Marcel Pagnol refers to the canal in his memoirs, Le Ch√¢teau de ma m√®re, and states that his father gave a key to enable him to enter the canal through private property and thus shorten his journey.

At the center of the community is an 18-hole golf course and country club as well as a small business district of retail stores and offices, garden apartment complexes and condominium developments, public and private educational institutions, and assorted houses of worship. The area's unusual name (pronounced WIHK'-uh-gihl or WICK-uh-gill) is commonly believed to have originated through the combination of two Native American words: wigwos, meaning birch bark, and keag, meaning country. The name most likely resulted from the shortening the name of an Algonquian- speaking band of Lenape who originally inhabited the area. History Around the end of the 19th century, this area of \\"Upper Rochelle\\" was still primarily farm land with the exception of the adjoining Wykagyl Country Club, which relocated to its current site in 1905. By 1912, New Rochelle's home development was rapidly extending northward, with North Avenue serving as the central thoroughfare. A syndicate of bankers and investors began amassing expansive tracts of forest and farm land surrounding the club, eventually incorporating under the name Wykagyl Reservation. The reservation was ideally located to take advantage of the new transportation facilities afforded by the recently completed New York, Westchester and Boston Railway commuter line through the area. Alfred Feltheimer, the architect who designed and named the railroad's stations, chose \\"Wykagyl\\" in association with the its location adjacent to the golf club. The new rail line spurred new construction and commercial activity, prompting a population boom. Developers immediately set to the task of providing them with fine homes and desirable communities on the waiting large tracts of farmland. \\"Wykagyl Gardens\\", one of the largest apartment complexes in the country at the time, was built adjacent to the station.

Paine's home, the Thomas Paine Cottage, was built in 1793 after a fire destroyed the previous home. The cottage was moved to its current location, which is on land that was part of the farm owned by Paine. The house, which is a National Historic Landmark, is currently operated as a museum. and The Thomas Paine Memorial Museum building, which houses the library and museum collection of the Thomas Paine National Historical Association, was built in 1925.MuseumPHOTOS of STATUES of TOM PAINE and some of his writings - tompaine.htm * Israel Secord House, 1337 North Avenue at Quaker Ridge Road. The original section of the house on this site is believed to have been constructed in the 1770s by Israel Secord, on land deeded to him by his father, James. During the Revolutionary War, Sir Lord William Howe, commander of British forces, made his headquarters in the Secord farmhouse before marching his troops to the Battle of White Plains, October 1776. In the rear of the home stood the ‚Äúhanging tree‚Äù, an oak tree from the 1700s reportedly used to execute prisoners during the Revolutionary War. It was struck by lightning in the 1950s and subsequently cut down, though pieces of the tree were kept by area residents. Although the Israel Secord farmhouse was enlarged and remodeled over the years, it still retains many of its historical elements. The farm‚Äôs cider mill is now the home at 22 Quaker Ridge Road. Records show that the land remained in the Secord family until the turn of the 20th century, when it was purchased by Charles and Regina Niehaus. Charles was a nationally recognized sculptor who created many notable sculptures in Washington; Regina became a renowned horticulturist. The farmland was sold off, bit by bit, to the developers of Bonnie Crest neighborhood. From approximately 1946 to 1970, the Israel Secord House was home to Daniel F. Sheehy, a packaging executive and prominent Roman Catholic layman, his wife Ruth and their six children. During that time, the interior of the home was decorated with early American and Victorian furnishings, and quality Colonial style reproductions. During that time, more of the land was lost, especially frontage on North Avenue and Quaker Ridge Road taken by the city for road improvements. The family received several offers to sell the property for commercial development, and at one point, the City of New Rochelle considered constructing their new library on the site. The home received a 2008 New Rochelle Heritage Award. * The Brewster Schoolhouse - one of the oldest structural relics in Westchester County, dates back to the 18th century, and is by in dimensions. * Norman Rockwell's studio - home and studio where the artist created much of his iconic Saturday Evening Post work * St. John's Wilmot Church - a historic Episcopal parish located in the northern end of the City at the intersection of North Avenue and Wilmot Road, formerly referred to as \\"Cooper's Corner.\\" =Parks and recreation= * Wykagyl Country Club - a private facility that has hosted Ladies Professional Golf Association tournaments. * Ward Acres - a combination of untouched forest, wild lawns and meadows, acres of hiking and exercise trails, and historic horse stables and cemeteries.

Mburucuy√° National Park () is a National park in Argentina. It is located in the north west of the Corrientes Province around 150 km from the city of Corrientes and covers an area of 176 square kilometres of the Iber√° Wetlands. The area is important for the provision of water, the regulation of floods and draughts in the local region through its effects on the regional microclimate. History Around 5,000 years ago the area was populated by indigenous peoples, in more recent times the area was occupied by the Guaran√≠ who introduced the cultivation of maize, squash, beans, Cassava, cotton and yerba mate. When the territory was colonized by the Spanish many of the original settlements were occupied and substantially modified. The introduction of large scale agriculture saw the indiscriminate deforestation of native trees. The creation of the national park occurred in the 20th century. After the Second World War Dr. Troels Pederson donated the territory for the creation of the national park. The objectives of the park are to maintain the environment and show the region in its historical context. Natural resources The zone is divided between three distinct natural regions chaque√±a, espinal and selva paranaense. =Chaco Oriental= Composed of woodland, palms, grass plains and wetlands. Some characteristic native species are quebracho (quebracho Colorado and quebraco blanco), urunday and virar√≥, prosopis, palms and caranday. =Selva Paranaense= The area is characterised by small hills, local species include the syagrus romanzoffiana palm timb√≥ and laurel. =El Espinal= The region is populated with yatay palms, poaceae and diverse xerophile woodland. Fauna The park has around 150 species of birds, and many species of animal including capybara, caymen, foxes armadillos jaguars and brown howler monkeys.

Deborah Kass works in mixed media, and is most recognized for her paintings, prints, photography, sculptures and neon lighting installations. Kass's early work mimics and reworks signature styles of iconic male artists of the 20th century including Frank Stella, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock, and Ed Ruscha.http://www.artsy.net/artist/deborah-kass Kass's technique of appropriation is a critical commentary on the intersection of social power relations, identity politics, and the historically dominant position of male artists in the art world.Kass, Deborah, and Lisa Liebmann. Deborah Kass: Before and Happily Ever after. New York: Skira Rizzoli, 2012. Early Life Deborah Kass was born in 1952 in San Antonio, Texas. Her grandparents were from Belarus and the Ukraine, first generation Jewish immigrants to New York. Kass‚Äôs parents were from the Bronx and Queens, New York. Her father did two years in the U.S. Air Force on base in San Antonio until the family returned to the suburbs of Long Island, New York, where Kass grew up. Kass‚Äôs mother was a substitute teacher at the Rockefeller Center public schools and her father was a dentist and amateur jazz musician. At age 14, Kass began taking drawing classes at The Art Students League in New York City which she funded with money she made babysitting. In the afternoons, she would go to theater on and off Broadway, often sneaking for the second act. During her high school years, she would take her time in the city to visit the Museum of Modern Art, where she would be exposed to the works of post-war artists like Frank Stella and Willem De Kooning. At age 17, Stella‚Äôs retrospective exhibition inspired Kass to become an artist as she observed and understood the logic in his progression of works and the motivation behind his creative decisions.  Education  Kass received her BFA in Painting at Carnegie Mellon University (the alma mater of artist Andy Warhol), and studied at the Whitney Museum Independent Study Program Here, she created her first work of appropriation, Ophelia‚Äôs Death After Delacroix, a six by eight foot rendition of a small sketch by the French Romantic artist, Eug√®ne Delacroix.  Influences  At the same time Neo-Expressionism was being helmed by white men in the late Reagan years, women were just beginning to create a stake in the game for critical works. ‚ÄúThe Photo Girls‚Äù consisted of artists like Sherrie Levine, Cindy Sherman, and Barbara Kruger. Kass felt that content of these works connected those of the post-war abstract painters of the mid-70s including Elizabeth Murray, Pat Steir, and Susan Rothenberg. All of these artists critically explored art in terms of new subjectivities from their points-of- view as women. Kass took from these artists the ideas of cultural and media critique, inspiring her Art History Paintings. Kass is most famous for her ‚ÄúDecade of Warhol,‚Äù in which she appropriated various works by the pop artist, Andy Warhol. She used Warhol‚Äôs visual language to comment on the absence of women in art history at the same time that Women‚Äôs Studies began to emerge in academia. Reading texts on subjectivity, objectivity, specificity, and gender fluidity by theorists like Judith Butler and Eve Sedgewick, Kass became literate in ideas surrounding identity. She engaged with art history through the lens of feminism, because of this theory which ‚ÄúThe Photo Girls‚Äù drew upon.  Works  Kass's work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art; Whitney Museum of American Art; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; Jewish Museum (New York); Museum of Fine Art, Boston; Cincinnati Museum of Art; New Orleans Museum; National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; Fogg Museum, Harvard Art Museums; and Weatherspoon Museum, among others.The New York Times, Riffing On Forefathers And Mothers, 10/28/2012 The New York Times, retrieved April 25, 2014 In 2012 Kass's work was the subject of a mid-career retrospective Deborah Kass, Before and Happily Ever After at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, PA.Has Deborah Kass Saved Warhol Appropriation?, Hyperallergic January 4, 2013, Retrieved April 25, 2014 An accompanying catalogue published by Skira Rizzoli, included essays by noted art historians Griselda Pollock, Irving Sandler, Robert Storr, Eric C. Shiner and writers and filmmakers Lisa Leibmann, Brooks Adams, and John Waters. Kass's work has been shown at international private and public venues including at the Venice Biennale, the Istanbul Biennale, the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, the Museum of Modern Art, The Jewish Museum, New York, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. A survey show, Deborah Kass, The Warhol Project traveled across the country from 1999‚Äì2001. She is a Senior Critic in the Yale University M.F.A. Painting Program.http://art.yale.edu/DeborahKass Kass's later paintings often borrow their titles from song lyrics. Her series feel good paintings for feel bad times, incorporates lyrics borrowed from The Great American Songbook, which address history, power, and gender relations that resonate with Kass's themes in her own work. =Art History Paintings 1989‚Äì1992= In Kass's first significant body of work, the Art History Paintings, she combined frames lifted from Disney cartoons with slices of painting from Pablo Picasso, Jasper Johns, Jackson Pollock, and other contemporary sources. Establishing appropriation as her primary mode of working, these early paintings also introduced many of the central concerns of her work to the present. Before and Happily Ever After, for example, coupled Andy Warhol‚Äôs painting of an advertisement for a nose job with a movie still of Cinderella fitting her foot into her glass slipper, touching on notions of Americanism and identity in popular culture. The Art History Paintings series engages critically with the history of politics and art making, especially exploring the power relationship of men and women in society. Deborah Kass's work reveals a personal relationship she shares with particular artworks, songs and personalities, many of which are referenced directly in her paintings. =The Warhol Project 1992‚Äì2000= In 1992, Kass began The Warhol Project. Beginning in the 1960s, Andy Warhol‚Äôs paintings employed mass production through screen-printing to depict iconic American products and celebrities. Using Warhol‚Äôs stylistic language to represent significant women in art, Kass turned Warhol‚Äôs relationship to popular culture on its head by replacing them with subjects of her own cultural interests. She painted artists and art historians that were her heroes including Cindy Sherman, Elizabeth Murray, and Linda Nochlin. Drawing upon her childhood nostalgia, the Jewish Jackie series depicts actress Barbra Streisand, a celebrity with whom she closely identifies, replacing Warhol's prints of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Marilyn Monroe. Her My Elvis series likewise speaks to gender and ethnic identity by replacing Warhol's Elvis with Barbra Streisand from Yentl: a 1983 film in which Streisand plays a Jewish woman who dresses and lives as a man in order to receive an education in the Talmudic Law. Kass's Self Portraits as Warhol further deteriorates the idea of rigid gender norms and increasingly identifies the artist with Warhol.http://www.newcombartgallery.tulane.edu/kass.html By appropriating Andy Warhol's print Triple Elvis and replacing Elvis Presley with Barbara Streisand‚Äôs Yentl, Kass is able to identify herself with history‚Äôs icons, creating a history with powerful women as subjects of art. The work embodies her concerns surrounding gender representation, advocates for a feminist revision of art, and directly challenges the tradition of patriarchy. America‚Äôs Most Wanted America's Most Wanted is a series of enlarged black-and-white screen prints of fake police mug shots. The collection of prints from 1998‚Äì1999 is a late-1990s update of Andy Warhol‚Äôs 1964 work 13 Most Wanted Men, which featured the most wanted criminals of 1962. The ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù are identified in titles only by first name and surname initial, but in reality the criminals depicted are individuals prominent in today's art world. Some of the individuals depicted include Donna De Salvo, deputy director for international initiatives and senior curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art; Thelma Golden, director and chief curator of the Studio Museum in Harlem, and Robert Storr, dean of the Yale School of Art. Kass's subjects weren‚Äôt criminals. Through this interpretation, Kass show's how they are wanted by aspirants for their ability to elevate artists‚Äô careers.https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/arts/design/review-deborah-kass- takes-mug-shots-of-the-art-world.html?ref=arts&_r=1 The series explores the themes of authorship and the gaze, at the same time problematizing certain connotations within the art world. =Feel Good Paintings for Feel Bad Times 2002‚Äì2013= In 2002, Kass began a new body of work, feel good paintings for feel bad times, inspired, in part, by her reaction to the Bush administration. These works combine stylistic devices from a wide variety of post-war painting, including Ellsworth Kelly, Frank Stella, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, and Ed Ruscha, along with lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, Laura Nyro, and Sylvester, among others, pulling from popular music, Broadway show tunes, the Great American Songbook, Yiddish, and film. The paintings view American art and culture of the last century through the lens of that time period's outpouring of creativity that was the result of post-war optimism, a burgeoning middle class, and democratic values. Responding to the uncertain political and ecological climate of the new century in which they have been made, Kass's work looks back on the 20th century critically and simultaneously with great nostalgia, throwing the present into high relief. Drawing, as always, from the divergent realms of art history, popular culture, political realities, and her own political and philosophical reflection, the artist continues into the present the explorations that have characterized her paintings since the 1980s in these new hybrid textual and visual works. =OY/YO= In 2015, Two Tree Management Art in Dumbo commissioned of a monumentally scaled installation of OY/YO for the Brooklyn Bridge Park. The sculpture, measuring 8√ó17√ó5 ft., consists of big yellow aluminum letters, was installed on the waterfront and was visible from the Manhattan. It spells ‚ÄúYO‚Äù against the backdrop of Brooklyn. The flip side, for those gazing at Manhattan, reads ‚ÄúOY.‚Äùhttp://www.brooklynbridgepark.org/press/two-trees- management-company-presents-deborah-kass-oy-yo An article and photo appeared on the front page of the New York Times 3 days after its installation in the park. An instant icon, OY/YO stayed at that site for 10 months where it became a tourist destination, a favorite spot for wedding, graduation, class photos and countless selfies. After its stay in Dumbo it moved to the ferry stop at North 6th Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for a year, where it greeted ferry riders. Since 2011, OY/YO has been a reoccurring motif in Deborah Kass's work in the form of paintings, prints, and tabletop sculptures. Kass first created ‚ÄúOY‚Äù as a painting riffing on Edward Ruscha‚Äôs 1962 Pop canvas, ‚ÄúOOF.‚Äù She later painted ‚ÄúYO‚Äù as a diptych that nodded to Picasso's 1901 self-portrait, ‚ÄúYo Picasso‚Äù (‚ÄúI, Picasso‚Äù).deborahkass.com OY/YO is now installed in front of the Brooklyn Museum. Another arrived at Stanford University in front of the Cantor Arts Center late 2019. A large edition of OY/YO was acquired by the Jewish Museum in New York in 2017 and is on view in the exhibition Scenes from the Collection. =No Kidding= On December 9, 2015 Deborah Kass introduced her new paintings that incorporated neon lights in an exhibition at Paul Kasmin Gallery entitled \\"No Kidding\\" in Chelsea, New York. The exhibition was an extension of her Feel Good Paintings for Feel Bad Times, but it sets a darker, tougher tone as she reflects on contemporary issues such as global warming, institutional racism, political brutality, gun violence, and attacks on women's health, through the lens of minimalism and grief. The series is ongoing.http://www.paulkasmingallery.com/artists/deborah-kass  Personal Life  Deborah Kass is married to artist Patricia Anne Cronin in July 2011. Cronin is a professor of art at Brooklyn College. She graduated from Rhode Island College, got and MFA in painting from Brooklyn College, and studied at both the Yale Summer School of Art and Music and the Skowhegan School of Art.

He was a Teachta D√°la (TD) for Dublin West from 1982 to 1987. Dublin West by-election Richard Burke, the Fine Gael TD for Dublin West, resigned his seat on 30 March 1982 to take up an appointment as Ireland's European Commissioner. Burke's appointment by the Taoiseach Charles Haughey was seen as a political \\"stroke\\". The appointment was in the gift of the Taoiseach, and all previous appointments had been from the governing party, but Haughey's government did not have a majority in D√°il √âireann, and could ill-afford to risk losing a seat in the by-election which would result from appointing a Fianna F√°il TD. Burke had been a Commissioner from 1977 to 1981, and had returned to the D√°il at the 1981 general election. However, his conservative approach was out of step with the liberal ethos of Fine Gael leader Garret FitzGerald, who did not offer Burke a cabinet job, and Haughey's offer of a return to the commission was the only promotion in sight. The Dublin West seat was seen as winnable for Fianna F√°il, and Haughey's appointment of Burke raised the prospect of Fianna F√°il gaining a seat rather than losing one. In selecting a candidate, Fine Gael cast its net outside its own ranks, and chose Skelly, a businessman who had not previously even been a member of a political party. After a closely fought campaign, Skelly won the Dublin West by-election on 25 May 1982. He polled slightly fewer first- preference votes than Fianna F√°il's Eileen Lemass (who had been TD for Dublin West until her defeat at the February 1982 general election), but Skelly won the poll with transfers from other candidates as they were eliminated. In the D√°il Skelly held the seat at the November 1982 general election, but found himself increasingly out of step with the direction taken by the government, and eventually resigned the Fine Gael whip. He sat as an independent for the rest of the 24th D√°il, but when he stood as an independent at the 1987 general election he won only 3.4% of the first-preference votes and lost his seat.

The production team covered the breadth and depth of India, from the Himalayan mountains in the north to the reef-fringed islands of the Indian Ocean, to capture footage of the country's wild places and charismatic wildlife. Land of the Tiger was co-produced by the BBC Natural History Unit and the WNET/13 network. It was produced by Mike Birkhead and presented by leading Indian naturalist Valmik Thapar. The series is characterised by scenes of Thapar riding on an elephant in locations across the country. The series forms part of the Natural History Unit's Continents strand. It was preceded by Spirits of the Jaguar in 1996 and followed three years later by Andes to Amazon. Episodes=1. \\"The Tiger's Domain\\"= The series begins in the Gir Forest in the western state of Gujarat. This is the last refuge of the Asiatic lion, which unlike its African cousin can be approached on foot, as demonstrated by presenter Valmik Thapar. After a preview of scenes from the forthcoming programmes, the rest of this episode concentrates on the wildlife of India's central forests and grasslands, the stronghold of the Bengal tiger. Much of the footage is from the Kanha National Park, a protected reserve. Here, the characters of Kipling's Jungle Book can still be observed, among them the sloth bear, wolf, dhole, and tiger. Many of the animals are sacred or revered by Hindus, including elephants, monkeys, peacocks and snakes. A female tiger with young cubs is filmed. To provide for her cubs, she must hunt. Spotted deer (or chital) are her favourite prey, but although distracted by the rut, her first hunt is unsuccessful. In the afternoon, chitals and langur monkeys move into open meadows, and here the female tiger succeeds in killing a langur. Other unusual behaviour filmed includes a golden jackal family defending their pups from a sloth bear and a peacock attacking a snake. Cobras are shown being protected by local villagers. The young are dug out of their underground nest and are handled by children despite the risk of a venomous bite (Thapar reveals that there are 20,000 deaths from cobra bites in India each year). The programme closes with a warning message. Wildlife of the central forests face an uncertain future due to disappearing habitat and poaching. Traditional beliefs instilled a feeling of respect for wild animals, but this is now being eroded =2. \\"Sacred Waters\\"= The second programme features the wildlife of India's sacred rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra. Beginning at Devaprayag, the confluence of two tributaries which together give rise to the Ganges, Thapar explains how the fertility of the waters is dependent on the summer monsoon. The rains bring a peak flow of of water every second down the rivers, flooding the plains of northern India and Bangladesh with fertile silt. The Bharatpur wetland sanctuary near the Taj Mahal is actually a man-made environment but is now a haven for hundreds of thousands of birds, including 2,000 pairs of painted storks which are filmed building nests, mating, incubating eggs and feeding their chicks. Other animals shown are monitor lizards which prey on fallen eggs and chicks, fishing cats and endangered gharials, a fish-eating crocodile. Young gharials call to their mother as they hatch so she can dig them out of their underground nest. The females co-operate, taking turns to guard their vulnerable young in a cr√®che. As the monsoon draws to a close, more birds arrive, including sarus cranes, filmed conducting their courtship dances, and millions of waterfowl. The huge concentration attracts over thirty kinds of birds of prey. On the Brahmaputra in the north eastern state of Assam, Thapar introduces the animals of Kaziranga, including Indian rhino, wild elephants and one of the last populations of wild buffalo and barasingha. These attract a huge density of tigers, and one bold individual is filmed trying to take on an adult buffalo. The sacred rivers eventually flow into a vast delta at the Bay of Bengal, and here in the mangrove swamps of the Sundarbans, animals and people are adapted to the tidal conditions. Mudskippers, monitor lizards, macaques and pythons are all shown. It is also home to over 500 tigers and is now a protected reserve. In a remarkable sequence, the fishermen of the delta are shown using smooth-coated otters tethered to their boats to flush out fish into their nets. =3. \\"Unknown Seas\\"= Opening the program at a traditional boatyard at Veraval in north-west India, Thapar travels down the Arabian Sea coast to the coral islands of Lakshadweep, encountering dolphins and a feeding whale shark along the way. The reefs around the islands teem with life. Powderblue surgeonfish are shown defending their algae garden from a parrotfish and, less successfully, from a marauding shoal of convict tangs. The abundant reef fish attract predators such as the bluefin jack, whitetip reef shark and, 30m down on the sandy bottom, a stingray. In the evening, land-based hermit crabs come down to the beaches to scavenge for food. A sequence filmed at night shows sharks, moray eels and groupers hunting on the reef. The islanders are filmed climbing coconut palms and fishing for tuna, displaying adept teamwork. The journey continues around the southern tip of India to the Indian Ocean, where shoaling manta rays are encountered. Pulicat is one of the few unspoilt places on the eastern coast, and is home to many wading birds and waterfowl. Spot- billed pelicans fly with fully laden beaks 40 km inland to the huge pelicanry at Nelapattu where 1,500 birds gather to raise their young. 1200 km off the east coast lie the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Isolated from mainland Asia 60 million years ago and now home to unique species. Many are uninhabited and still covered in pristine rainforest. Logging is a problem - working elephants are used in the timber industry and are filmed swimming between the islands. The Nicobar megapode is an endemic bird that incubates its eggs in a mound of sand and rotting vegetation. Cunning monitor lizards are filmed stealing the eggs and laying their own in the mound, which is still attended to by the oblivious birds. Animals filmed in the reefs around the islands include damselfish, clownfish and cuttlefish. Olive ridley turtles mate at sea and come ashore at Gahirmatha beach in their thousands, where Thapar watches the millions of hatchlings return to the water. =4. \\"Desert Kingdom\\"= India's Thar Desert spans the western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. More people live here than in any other desert, with a population density 100 times that of the Sahara, and growing all the time. Fortunately the people of the desert look favourably on their wild neighbours, as demonstrated by the villagers of Khichan, who feed large flocks of demoiselle cranes over the winter. The birds are revered as symbols of fortune. Thapar visits a desert dwelling of the Bishnoi people, strict vegetarians and guardians of the animal population. Despite this, poaching is rife and the blackbucks, filmed in the breeding season, are being increasingly marginalised. The chinkara or Indian gazelle is an even hardier animal, getting all the moisture it needs from plants and the morning dew. Wolves and jackals are also shown. Around a camp fire, the nocturnal inhabitants of the desert are filmed as they emerge from the sand: dung beetles, gerbils and predatory saw scaled vipers and scorpions. The people of Jodhpur are vegetarians but use domesticated oxen, camels and buffalo as working animals. When they die, the carcasses are taken to the edge of the city and left as food for scavengers, among them Asian king vultures, Indian white-rumped vultures and griffon vultures. Waterholes attract many animals before they dry up during the heat of summer. It is also used by people and their livestock for washing and drinking. Birds shown include pied kingfisher, red-wattled lapwing and black-winged stilt. To escape egrets, frogs hop across the surface of the water. At night, climbing perch leave the water and travel across land to find other pools, and an ingenious ratel uses logs to reach a stricken kingfisher chick. The most extreme environment is the Rann of Kutch salt flats where only the monsoon brings relief to the last population of Indian wild asses. In the closing scenes, Thapar observes flocks of flamingos which come to the salt flats in times of flood. =5. \\"Mountains of the Gods\\"= The Himalayas, created during the collision of the Indian and Asiatic continental plates, form the northern boundary of the Indian subcontinent. Valmik Thapar begins in the cold, dry desert of Ladakh, the northernmost region of India. A sequence of aerial mountain shots and typical fauna including snow leopard, Himalayan ibex and lammergeier is shown, followed by scenes of Buddhist monasteries and winter festivals. The Buddhist's respect for all nature stems from the ancient animist belief system in which animals were thought of as living embodiments of the spirit world. Wildlife is often plentiful around villages, where chukar, robin accentor and red-billed chough are commonly seen. Temperatures plunge to -30 Celsius in winter. Bharal can survive at great height by digging for roots or even climbing trees. Across the border in Pakistan, markhor are not so hardy, and must descend to lower elevations. In spring, melting snows reveal winter's casualties. Himalayan griffon vultures strip a carcass in 20 minutes, then lammergeiers carry away the bones. Further west in the meadows of Deosai, rarities such as Himalayan brown bears, kiang and black-necked cranes are filmed. Bar-headed geese cross the mountains to breed here, and marmots play fight in the meadows. Thapar then travels to the south side of the mountains where lush forests of oak, birch, spruce and rhododendron thrive on the monsoon rains. Animals in this region include Himalayan tahr, yellow-throated marten and grey langurs, shown feeding on Indian horse chestnut shoots. The golden langur, discovered in the 1950s, survives in the wild only in Bhutan and western Assam. In the north east of India, the animals of the Arunachal Pradesh are very different. Here, species from China and East Asia have colonised the forests. They include spectacular pheasants such as Himalayan monal, Temminck's tragopan and Blyth's tragopan. Mammals include red panda, Malayan giant squirrel and Hoolock gibbon, India's only non-human ape. Valmik Thapar ends the programme at Namo Buddha in Nepal where legend has it Lord Buddha gave his life to a starving tigress and her cubs, and in doing so instilled a protective attitude to all creatures in his followers. =6. \\"Monsoon Forest\\"= The final programme looks at India's dwindling rainforests, now confined to the Western Ghats, upper Assam and Sri Lanka. The once extensive forests have been decimated by logging, firewood collection and hunting. In the opening scene, Valmik Thapar tracks lion-tailed macaques in southern India, a very rare fruit and seed eating monkey. In the Western Ghats, there are 120 species of amphibian, including flying frogs. Invertebrates use colour for camouflage, warning and defence, but mantises and crickets still fall prey to slow-moving chameleons. A faster reptile, the flying lizard, is shown gliding from tree to tree. Also filmed is the ancient practice of collecting honey from wild bees' nests high in the canopy. Birds visiting a fruiting fig tree include great Indian hornbills, Malabar grey hornbills, blossom-headed parakeets and fairy bluebirds. Mammals are also attracted by the fruit: Nilgiri langurs, bonnet macaques and Malabar giant squirrels. On the forest floor, wild boar and barking deer feed on the rejected figs, drawing a prowling leopard. Monkeys spot the danger and raise the alarm. The many varieties of fig tree provide food year-round for all these animals. Each fig is pollinated by a particular species of wasp, which lay their eggs in the fruits. Thapar visits the world's largest fig, a sacred banyan tree that draw pilgrims from far and wide. In the hill forests of southern India, Thapar tracks Nilgiri tahr on the grassy peaks. Here, the rains last for 6 months, creating huge waterfalls. The Sinharaja forest of Sri Lanka has more unique species than anywhere else on the subcontinent, including dozens of kinds of jumping spiders, each with their own courtship signals. A tiger is filmed stalking a rutting gaur herd. Gaur are the world's biggest cattle but they have been known to fall prey to tigers. The program ends on a sober note, filming elephants crossing tea plantations where forests once stood. The problem elephants are caught and trained as working animals. A wild calf is shown being caught by lasso. The distressed animal is broken by torture, but it is also worshipped: one of the paradoxes of the subcontinent.

It is part of the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes, one of the four volcanic belts in the Andes chain. The volcano has evolved in close contact with glacial ice. It differs from many calderas in that Sollipulli appears to have collapsed in a non-explosive manner. The age of collapse is not yet known, but it is presently filled with ice to thicknesses of . The ice drains through two glaciers in the west and the north of the caldera. Sollipulli has developed on a basement formed by Mesozoic and Cenozoic geological formations. Sollipulli was active in the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs. A large Plinian eruption occurred 2,960‚Äì2,780 years before present, forming the Alpehu√© crater and generating a high eruption column and ignimbrite deposits. The last activity occurred 710 ¬± 60 years before present and formed the Chufqu√©n scoria cone on the northern flank. Sollipulli is among the 118 volcanoes which have been active in recent history.  Geomorphology and geography  Sollipulli lies in the Araucania Region, Caut√≠n Province, Melipeuco commune. The Sollipulli volcano is in the western part of the Nevados de Sollipulli mountain range, which is bordered to the north, south and east by river valleys. The communes of Curarrehue, Cunco, Panguipulli, Pucon and Villarrica are in the area, Melipeuco lies northwest. The volcano is also part of the K√ºtralkura geopark project. = Regional = Sollipulli is part of the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes, one of the four belts of volcanoes which are found in the mountain range. The other three are the Northern Volcanic Zone, the Central Volcanic Zone (both north of the Southern Volcanic Zone) and the Austral Volcanic Zone (south of the Southern Volcanic Zone). These volcanic zones are separated by gaps where there is no volcanic activity and the subduction of the Pacific Ocean crust is shallower than in the volcanically active areas. About 60 volcanoes have erupted in historical time in the Andes, and 118 additional volcanic systems show evidence of Holocene eruptions. There are 60 volcanoes in the Southern Volcanic Zone; among these are Cerro Azul and Cerro Hudson, which experienced large eruptions in 1932 and 1991 that resulted in the emission of substantial volumes of ash. The volcanoes Llaima and Villarrica have been regularly active during recent history. = Local = Sollipulli is a stratovolcano, which has one caldera on its summit and southwest of it the Alpehu√© crater. The crater is draped by pyroclastic flow deposits, and its rim reaches a height of . The rims of the caldera rise above the ice in the caldera; the highest summit of Sollipulli lies on the southern flank of the caldera and reaches an elevation of above sea level. On the southern and eastern side the caldera is bordered by several lava domes. The caldera most likely was not formed by a large explosive eruption, considering that no deposits from such an eruption have been found. The volcano is formed by lava flows, lava domes, scoria, pillow lavas as well as pumice falls, pyroclastics and other material. The edifice has a volume of about and covers a surface area of about . Radial valleys extend away from the top. A number of particular landforms on Sollipulli formed under the influence of glacial ice, such as the caldera structure. The Nevados de Sollipulli mountain chain west of the Sollipulli caldera are a chain of volcanoes which is heavily eroded. They are formed by breccia and lava flows; glacial action has left cirques. Closer to the caldera they are better preserved, with individual flows issuing from fissure vents. This chain is one of several eastnortheast striking volcano alignments in the Southern Volcanic Zone, the regional tectonics favour magma ascent along such alignments. The flanks of the volcano are covered by lava flows, which gives them irregular contours. Glaciers and streams have cut valleys into the slopes and smoothed the lava flows. Two scoria cones are situated on the northern flank, Chufqu√©n and Redondo, each associated with lava flows; about a dozen such craters dot the flanks of the volcano.  Glaciers  Both the main caldera and the Alpehu√© crater contain glaciers, which in the caldera reached a thickness of in 1992 and fills it; the total volume was estimated at in 1992. These glaciers feature typical ice structures such as crevasses and there may be a subglacial lake in the caldera. Three lakes are found in the caldera at its margins, the easterly Sharkfin lake, the southeasterly Dome lake and the southwesterly Alpehu√© lake. These glaciers drain to the north and northwest; the latter glacier flows from the caldera through the Alpehu√© crater into the valley of the same name, which is drained by the Rio Alpehu√© into the Rio Allip√©n river. Other than the caldera and crater glaciers, the only snow cover on Sollipulli is seasonal. Glaciers have been present on the volcano before the last glacial maximum. The glacier within the caldera of Sollipulli is shrinking; its surface area decreased between 1961 and 2011 and the Alpehu√©n outlet glacier retreated by . Some smaller ice fields around Sollipulli either shrank between1986 and 2017 or disappeared altogether. The process of glacier retreat is probably accelerated by ash being deposited on the glacier through eruptions at the neighbouring volcano Puyehue-Cord√≥n Caulle; activity at the other volcanoes Llaima and Villarrica may have the same effect. In 2011, the volume of the glacier was . Melting of the glacier risks generating lahars and putting water supplies in the region into jeopardy.

About 27 million years ago, the Farallon Plate broke up and the pace of subduction increased, resulting in increased volcanic activity and a temporary change in the tectonic regime of the Southern Andes. Sollipulli volcano developed on a basement which consists of the Jurassic‚ÄìCretaceous Nacientes del Biob√≠o formation and the Pliocene-Pleistocene Nevados de Sollipulli volcanics, with subordinate exposures of the Miocene Curamall√≠n and the Cretaceous-Tertiary Vizcacha-Cumilao complex volcano-sedimentary formations. Miocene granites are intruded into the basement. = Composition = Rocks erupted from Sollipulli range from basalt over basaltic andesite and andesite to dacite. Composition has changed over the evolution of the volcano; sometimes one type of rock is found as inclusion in another. Minerals contained in the rocks include apatite, clinopyroxene, ilmenite, olivine, orthopyroxene, plagioclase and titanomagnetite. Xenoliths are also found, including diorite and granophyre. The petrogenesis of the Alpehu√© rocks has been explained with the penetration of more primitive magma into a dacitic magma chamber, which was then subject to magma mixing. The primitive magmas sometimes pass through the flanks of the edifice and form parasitic vents in these cases. Obsidian was obtained on Sollipulli and exported over large distances; it has been found as far as Argentina's steppes and northern Chile, and is chemically and in appearance different from obsidian obtained on Chaiten volcano. One source has been identified at a lava dome on the western side of Sollipulli. A route starting south of Melipeuco leads up on the volcano; this route was used for the transport of obsidian in the 1980s.  Vegetation  The region is forested, with deciduous trees including Nothofagus, with laurel forests around the lakes of the area and woods consisting of Araucaria araucana and Austrocedrus chilensis at altitudes exceeding . In addition there are open grasslands called mallines which were used for grazing.  Eruption history  Sollipulli was active during the Pleistocene and Holocene; the Nevados de Sollipulli are less than 1.8 million years old with argon-argon dating having obtained ages of 490,000 ¬± 30,000 and 312,000 ¬± 20,000 years ago. Six separate volcanic units form the edifice; from the oldest to the youngest they are the Sharkfin, Northwest, South, Peak, Alpehu√© and Chufqu√©n units. The first two may be contemporaneous to the formation of the caldera, or they may predate it. The Sharkfin unit was emplaced in a subglacial environment and later disrupted by faulting, later units show substantial evidence of having been altered by glaciers. Radiometric dates have been obtained on the Sharkfin unit (700,000 ¬± 140,000 and 350,000 ¬± 90,000 years before present), the Northwest unit (120,000 ¬± 16,000, 120,000 ¬± 140,000, 110,000 ¬± 30,000 and 100,000 ¬± 30,000 years before present) and the South and Peak units (68,000 ¬± 14,000, 64,000 ¬± 15,000 and 26,000 ¬± 5,000 years before present). The caldera is nested within an older and eroded caldera, and some parasitic cones are heavily eroded whereas others appear to be younger. Pyroclastic flows from Alpehu√© have been dated to 2,960‚Äì2,780 years before present. The Alpehu√© unit was emplaced during a large Plinian eruption, which generated a eruption column and ejected about of pumice falls; layers of tephra identified in a bog of South Georgia away as well as in an ice core at Siple Dome in Antarctica and dated to about 980 BCE may be a product of the Alpehu√© eruption. Alpehu√© tephra has been used as a tephrochronology tool. Pyroclastic flows from the eruption melted the caldera ice sheet, forming lahars that propagated northwest away from Sollipulli. Ignimbrites from this eruption cover surfaces of at least around Sollipulli, their volume has been estimated to be about . They are brown to grey in colour and unwelded with the exception of part of the ignimbrite that is emplaced within the Alpehu√© crater. The eruption reached a level of 5 on the volcanic explosivity index. Radiocarbon dating at Chufqu√©n has yielded an age of 710 ¬± 60 years before present. This eruption deposited ash onto the caldera ice, while it is absent from the central parts of the Chufqu√©n valley; either it was removed by a later glacier advance or it landed on a glacier which later retreated. The eruption occurred relatively recently, indicating that Sollipulli is still active. Presently, fumaroles and geothermal phenomena occur at the northwestern foot of Sollipulli. = Hazards = The substantial ice body in the caldera means that there is a significant risk of mudflows or glacier bursts in the case of renewed activity. Conversely, a retreat of the caldera-filling glacier might facilitate the onset of explosive eruptions at Sollipulli. A repeat of the Alpehu√© eruption would be a regional catastrophe, comparable to the 1991 eruption of Cerro Hudson volcano. The Chilean geological service Sernageomin monitors the volcano and publishes a hazard index for it. The towns of Cunco, Melipeuco and Villa Garc√≠a are close to the volcano. Melipeuco has devised a Volcanic Emergency Plan to deal with future eruptions of Llaima or Sollipulli.

Hanging Bridge is a medieval bridge spanning the Hanging Ditch, which connected the rivers Irk and Irwell in Manchester, England. The first reference to the bridge was in 1343, when it was called Hengand Brigge, but the present structure was built in 1421, replacing an earlier bridge. Material taken from Manchester's Roman fort may have been used in its construction. It has been speculated that the Hanging Ditch may be of Roman origin, part of a defensive circuit between the rivers Irk and Irwell. The name may derive from the Old English hen, meaning wild birds, and the Welsh gan, meaning between two hills. At its Irwell end, the Hanging Ditch was wide and deep. A stream flowed through the ditch, from the Irk to the Irwellpossibly the lost River Dene, which gave its name to Deansgate. The bridge has two arches and was built using sandstone from Collyhurst. It is long and wide. Hanging Bridge formed part of Manchester‚Äôs medieval defences, when it was the main route from Manchester to the cathedral, then a parish church. Hanging Bridge in 1890from the Manchester Times newspaper In 1600 the Hanging Ditch was condemned as an unsanitary open sewer, and in the following years the ditch was culverted and the bridge buried and built over. A directory published in 1772 recorded that nine houses had been built along the line of the bridge, suggesting that it may have been covered over during the first phase of Manchester's town planning, some time in the 1770s. The bridge was then forgotten, remembered only in the name of the area where it had stood, until its rediscovery and subsequent excavation as a result of demolition work carried out in the 1880s. The bridge was put on display, and in three months had about 32,000 paying visitors. It was once again covered up during the Victorian expansion of Manchester. More than 100 years later it was uncovered again, and following restoration work it went on display in 2002 as a main attraction of Manchester Cathedral's newly built visitor centre. Today the bridge is largely hidden by modern buildings, but it can be seen in the basement of Manchester Cathedral Visitor Centre, where it forms one side of the refectory. The bridge is listed as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

A structural biologist, her work includes structural analysis of protein-nucleic acid complexes, and the role of water in molecular interactions. She is also the founder and director of the Nucleic Acid Database, and leads the Protein Structure Initiative Structural Genomics Knowledgebase.Demasters K: ON THE MAP; A Bank Where the Currency Is Molecules. New York Times 2000-11-26. Accessed 2008-10-22.Helen Berman‚Äôs story from Rutgers University Office for the Promotion of Women in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Background and education Berman was born in Chicago, Illinois, and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. Her father, David Bernstein, was a physician and her mother, Dorothy Bernstein (n√©e Skupsky), managed her father's office practice. Inspired by her hard-working and scholarly father, she was interested in science as a young girl and planned to become a scientist or doctor. Her mother, who was strongly involved in the community and volunteer work, influenced her to be involved in community activities throughout her life. During high school, Berman worked in Ingrith Deyrup's laboratory at Barnard College. Deyrup encouraged Berman to attend Barnard as an undergraduate. While at college, she worked in a Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons laboratory with Barbara Low. There, Berman learned about crystallography, which would become a lifelong passion. She graduated from Barnard with an A.B. in chemistry in 1964. Following college, Berman attended the University of Pittsburgh for graduate school, a place she selected because it was the only place in the country with a crystallography department, and one of the few where crystallography was offered as a subject. There she worked with George A. Jeffrey on carbohydrate structure, receiving her Ph.D. in 1967. Berman remained at the University of Pittsburgh for two more years as a postdoctoral research fellow. Career In 1969, Berman moved to the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, where she worked in Jenny P. Glusker's laboratory before starting her own independent research program as a faculty member in 1973. At Fox Chase, Berman became interested in nucleic acid structures and in bioinformatics. She knew that logical organization of data would make it useful to a variety of scientists. In June 1971, Berman attended a symposium at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where several scientists agreed that data on the expanding number of protein structures should be archived in a database.Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology, vol. XXXVI (1972) That meeting led to the creation of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1989, Berman moved to Rutgers and in 1992, along with other scientists, she co-founded the Nucleic Acid Database (NDB) to collect and disseminate information about nucleic acid structure.About the Nucleic Acid Database At Rutgers, she continued to study nucleic acids, their interactions with proteins, and also researched the structure of collagen in collaboration with Barbara Brodsky and Jordi Bella. She is listed as a depositor on 38 structures in the PDB from 1992 to 2011, of protein/nucleic acid complexes and their components (e.g. 1RUN, 3SSX, 2B1B), collagen fragments (e.g. 1CGD, 1EI8), and other macromolecules. In 1998, Berman and Philip Bourne together competed for and won the contract for the Protein Data Bank and the database moved from Brookhaven to the auspices of the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB), currently a collaboration between Rutgers and the University of California, San Diego. With colleagues, Berman redesigned the data management system, added new user tools, and made the database searchable. Since 2003, the PDB archive has been managed by the worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), a partnership founded by Berman that consists of organizations that act as deposition, data processing and distribution centers for PDB data ‚Äì the RCSB, the PDBe in Europe, and the PDBj in Japan. In 2006 the BioMagResData (BMRB) databank for Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) structures became the fourth member of the wwPDB. As of July, 2018, the NDB holds over 9600 nucleic acid structures and the PDB holds more than 142,000 macromolecular structures. Also led by the RCSB, the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) Structural Genomics Knowledgebase was launched in the Spring of 2008 to provide a continuously updated portal to research data and other resources from the PSI efforts. Berman has also been active in the scientific community, serving as president of the American Crystallographic Association in 1988, advising both the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, and serving on the editorial board of several journals. Her work has been widely published in peer reviewed scientific journals.

The apparitions apparently communicated various messages to the schoolchildren, including an apocalyptic vision of Rwanda descending into violence and hatred, possibly foretelling the 1994 Rwandan genocide.Immacul√©e Ilibagiza, Steve Erwin. Our Lady of Kibeho: Mary Speaks to the World from the Heart of Africa. 2008, page xvii In 2001, the local bishop of the Catholic Church officially recognised the visions of three schoolchildren as authentic.Curran, Bridget. The Miracles of Mary: Everyday Encounters of Beauty and Grace. 2010, page 128 Apparitions Kibeho is a small village located in southwestern Rwanda. The reported apparitions there began on November 28, 1981, at a time of increasing tension between the Tutsi and Hutu groups. They occurred at Kibeho College, a secondary school for girls, and included an apocalyptic vision of Rwanda descending into violence and hatred which many believe foretold the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Over the course of the 1980s, the Virgin Mary was reported to have appeared to three young women, identifying herself as Nyina wa Jambo (Kinyarwanda for ‚ÄúMother of the Word‚Äù), which was synonymous with Umubyeyi W'Imana (\\"Mother of God\\"). The teenaged seers reported that the Virgin asked everyone to pray to prevent a terrible war. In the vision of August 19, 1982, they all reported seeing violence, dismembered corpses, and destruction.Rogers, Lois. \\"Our Lady of Kibeho\\", The Monitor, January 20, 2012, Diocese of Trenton The longest series of visions were attributed to Alphonsine Mumureke, who had received the initial vision shortly after her admittance into Kibeho High School in October 1981 after her primary education, and the last on November 28, 1989. Anathalie Mukamazimpaka was the next one to have visions, which lasted from January 1982 to December 3, 1983. These emphasised endless prayer and expiation, with the Virgin even instructing Mukamazimpaka to perform penances through mortification of the flesh. Marie Claire Mukangango, who had initially bullied Mumureke at school because of the visions, herself experienced apparitions which lasted from March 2 to September 15, 1982. The Virgin told Mukangango that people should pray the Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows to obtain the favor of repentance.\\"The Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows\\", Marians of the Immaculate Conception During his 1990 visit to Rwanda, Pope John Paul II exhorted the faithful to turn to the Virgin as a ‚Äúsimple and sure guide‚Äù and to pray for greater commitment against local divisions, both political and ethnic. =Links with the Genocide= In the 100 days that followed the April 6, 1994 assassination of dictator and President of Rwanda Juv√©nal Habyarimana, 800,000 to over a million Rwandans were slaughtered by their countrymen and, in some cases, their next-door-neighbors. The Genocide was the culmination of intensifying animosity between the two ethnic groups ‚Äì the Hutus and Tutsis ‚Äì and the civil war that had preceded it.\\"Remembering Rwanda\\", The Monitor, January 20, 2012, Diocese of Trenton Kibeho itself was the site of two huge massacres: the first at the parish church in April 1994, and the second a year later where more than 5,000 refugees who had taken shelter there were shot by soldiers.Linskey, Regina. \\"Our Lady of Kibeho: Forgotten apparitions\\", Catholic News, Singapore, Vol. 58, No. 25, December 7, 2008 Marie Claire Mukangango and her husband were among those killed in the April 1995 massacre. =Approved visionaries= Only the visions of the first three seers (Alphonsine Mumureke, Nathalie Mukamazimpaka, and Marie Clare Mukangango, aged 17, 20, and 21, respectively) received the solemn approval of Augustin Misago, Bishop of Gikongoro.Misago, Augustin. \\"Judgement on the Apparitions of Kibeho\\" =Non-approved visionaries= Others who claimed to have similar visions were Stephanie Mukamurenzi, Agnes Kamagaju, Vestine Salima, and Emmanuel Segastashya, the last of whom was previously a pagan and became a Christian evangelist. Segastashya‚Äôs alleged visions included meeting Christ in a beanfield. Interpretation The visions may be regarded as an ominous foreshadowing of the Rwandan genocide, and particularly the second Kibeho Massacre in 1995. The school where the visions occurred became a place of slaughter during the Genocide as dozens of children were shot and hacked to death by Hutu terrorists. The visionaries had either fled the violence or were among the casualties of the Genocide. Approval Augustin Misago, the Bishop of Gikongoro, approved public devotion linked to the apparitions on 15 August 1988 (the Solemnity of the Assumption of Mary) and declared their authenticity on 29 June 2001. He was accused in 1999 of involvement in the Rwandan Genocide, and acquitted on 24 June of the following year. The feast day of Our Lady of Kibeho is November 28, the anniversary of the initial apparition to Alphonsine Mumureke in 1981. Shrine The Marian sanctuary at Kibeho was named \\"Shrine of Our Lady of Sorrows\\" in 1992. The first stone was laid on 28 November 1992. In a 2003 agreement between the local ordinary and the Society of the Catholic Apostolate (Pallotines), the rectorate of the Shrine of Our Lady of Kibeho is entrusted to the Pallotine Fathers.

The maneuver was developed in 1938 and originally was taught to dive bomber pilots during World War II. The maneuver is used to equalize pressure in the middle ear. Today, the maneuver is also performed by scuba divers, free divers and by passengers on aircraft as they descend. The Frenzel Maneuver is performed as follows: * the way out of the nasal cavity is blocked, typically by pinching the nostrils or by a nose-clip; * the way out of the mouth cavity is blocked by the tongue, either performing an alveolar closure (as when the sound [t] or [d] is produced; this is the standard version) or a velar closure (using the back of the tongue; this is the advanced version, leaving very little possibility for the piston movement by the tongue, mentioned below); * the larynx is closed, sealing off the lungs; * the body of the tongue (or only the back of the tongue, if velar closure has been made) is gently moved upwards and backwards, in order to compress the air; * further compression of the air follows from moving the closed glottis upwards (this is easily noticed in the elevation of the \\"Adam's Apple\\"). By performing this technique, the compressed air is forced into Eustachian tubes, and thus into the middle ear. In situations where the ambient pressure rises (typical causes are decreasing altitude in the case of an airplane or increasing depth in the case of a diver submerging), the maneuver results in the equalization of the pressure on both sides of the eardrum. Compared with the Valsalva maneuver, the Frenzel maneuver carries a significantly lower risk of over-pressurizing the middle or inner ear; given e.g. a nose-clip, it also allows hands-free equalisation. The maneuver can be done at any time during the respiratory cycle and it does not inhibit venous return to the heart. Effort to perform the maneuver is minimal, and it can be repeated many times quickly.

Its ancestors have inhabited the island since 1807, and, as an invasive species, has had a considerable environmental impact. History In the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans released domestic pigs on many subantarctic islands. Various introductions of pigs were made to uninhabited Auckland as a source of food for stranded sailors or visiting whalers; the first took place in 1807, with further liberations in 1840, 1842 and the 1890s. By the end of the 19th century, the island held a thriving population of pigs of mixed origin which was largely undisturbed until the late 20th century, interbreeding to produce a distinctive local population.RBCSNZ: Auckland Island Pigs accessed 7 January 2008 Description The physical appearance and size of the pigs on Auckland Island is similar to the feral pigs located on the main island of New Zealand. They have coats of thick hair which are black, or white or brown with black markings. They also have long, narrow heads and snouts, straight tails, are relatively small and very athletic. The average weight of an adult boar is 41.7 kg, and an adult sow 37.3 kg. =Genetics= Population genetic variation is low within the Auckland Island pig population compared to other breeds of pigs found in Europe and Asia. These relatively pathogen-free pigs have been used to derive a biocertified herd as a source of cells for xenotransplantation. Behaviour and ecology=Distribution and habitat= As of the late 20th century, the substantial pig population occupied the whole of the island, with equal numbers of males and females. During the summer, the pigs inhabit both the coastal forest and high open country of the island, while during the winter, a majority of the pig population resides in the coastal forest and not the open country. The pigs' diet is simple, consisting mostly of plant food. In the high country, they eat a variety of different plants and earth worms. Those that inhabit the coast also eat a wide variety of plants, but their diet also includes bark, invertebrates, the remains of dead birds and sea lions, and the regurgitations of sea lions. =Effects on vegetation and wildlife= The pigs have destroyed much of the islands' flora, though remnant plant communities of Pleurophyllum, Stilbocarpa, and Anisotome are relatively safe because they are only accessible on cliffs where the pigs cannot go. Since the depletion of many plant food resources, the pig population on Auckland Island has remained relatively low. The feral pigs have also had negative effects on other wildlife throughout the island. They have dug up burrows of birds to steal their eggs such as petrels, albatrosses, mollymawks, penguins, and shags. =Management= A decision was made by New Zealand's Department of Conservation that species introduced to the Auckland Islands should be eradicated in the course of a program to restore the natural ecosystems. Consequently, the Rare Breeds Conservation Society of New Zealand (RBCSNZ) decided to attempt to preserve the population in captivity. In 1999, a RBCSNZ expedition caught and removed 17 pigs, including several pregnant sows, from Auckland Island, transferring them to Invercargill, New Zealand. These animals have since bred successfully and the variety is not at risk.

Ronald Bayton, the original owner of the independent, music-minded KYTE, sold the station a year later for $60,000 to Thomas R. and A. H. Becker of Newport, Oregon. Further changes came during 1961 and 1962, when KYTE moved from its original base to a new downtown studio, reopened after a month's silence under new management, and changed its call letters to KSNN on February 26, 1962. The new managers, Tommy Thompson and Daniel C. Libeg, also acquired the station itself: in 1965, Libeg bought out Thompson's share in KSNN. After a vandalism attempt in April 1967 in which someone shot out the tower lights with a .22-caliber rifle, the station sought approval to move its transmitter site as part of a $100,000 expansion that also included new studio facilities and the construction of an FM station at 93.7 MHz, KSNN-FM. The new offices opened in September 1968, while the FM outlet launched in 1969. KSNN also was hit with a lawsuit from the Associated Press in July 1969 for failure to pay a wire service bill. While the AM and FM outlets simulcast for the latter's first years in operation, the two stations split the simulcast in 1977, with the FM continuing to offer a Top 40 format while the AM flipped to oldies. In March 1978, KSNN-AM-FM was sold to the KSNN Broadcasting Company, composed primarily of three businessmen from Hutchinson, Kansas, for $159,000. The new ownership changed the call letters of the AM station to KISU on May 1. A format change in April 1981 resulted in new KZBQ call letters, allowing the television station at Idaho State University to pick up the KISU-TV calls later that year. KZBQ was acquired by its current owners, Idaho Wireless, in 1985 for $325,000; by this time, it ran an adult contemporary format. On January 23, 1995, the station changed its call sign to the current KOUU, call letters that had resided on the then-unbuilt 104.1 station at American Falls which became KORR.

It was run by the Pallottine Sisters and closed in June 1988. History St. Patrick's offered classes from the 3rd to 8th grade. Since 1937, most of the students were boys and boarders but there were a few girls and boys day students from local towns and municipalities. The school was closed in June 1988 after it was determined that it was a sound course of action. The decline in the interest of boarding military academies and the high cost of monthly tuition, was the principal cause of the school's demise. The school was established in 1937 and was originally named St. Patrick's Academy and later changed to St. Patrick's Semi Military Academy. The Alumni of St. Patrick's just recently found out that the school was never located in Harriman, New York, but in Monroe, New York. The address of the school was covered by the Harriman Post Office only. =Former School Chaplains= *Auxiliary Bishop Joseph Maria Pernicone (Archdiocese of New York) (D) *Monsignor James Bacon Sullivan (D) (Former Cadet New York Military Academy) *Father Salvatore Paterno (D) =Former Drill Instructors= *Mr. Jerry Impellittiere (D) *Mr. Harry Adams (D) *Captain Prue *Major Hickey =Former Music Directors= *Mrs. Angela Menna Adams (D) Glee Club * Mr. Robert Ortone (D) Marching Band =Former Principals= *Mother Mary Vincent (D) *Mother Mary Valeria (D) *Sister Mary Victoria Age 97 in 2015 Campus The St. Patrick's campus was originally built in 1922, when the Pallottine Sisters opened the Mother House of the United States. Following the school's closure in June 1988, the crosses on top of both buildings were removed. The facilities were later rented to the Monroe-Woodbury Central School District and much later other schools and organizations. In 2013, in anticipation of selling the property, the entire St. Patrick Military Academy Campus, including the Sister's Residences and Old Chapel were demolished. The sisters moved to new quarters within the property. The property has not been sold, as of June, 2015. The Cornerstone of the Dormitory Building (1960) survived and it is being stored for history. Curriculum The Educational Curriculum of the school included 3rd Grade to 8th Grades Grammar School. This included Mathematics, History, English, Geography and Civics. Monsignor Sullivan and the sisters taught religion and the Catechism. The Bishop came to the school each Easter for Confirmation and Monsignor Sullivan took care of First Holy Communion. Mass was said each day at the school for the sisters and the students could attend, if requested. Mass was said for the Regiment on Sunday if it was a closed weekend with no free time at home. Extracurricular activities The school had a Basketball Team for a while that entered into competition with other local schools. The school had company level baseball teams, but nothing of a serious nature. It was basically considered \\"Play Time\\". The school took the children to the then Ford Motor Plant in Mahwah, New York. The school took the children to go Bowling in Monroe, New York. However, the school concentrated its activities surrounding the Glee Club and its Marching Band. The Glee Club was the best of its class. They performed each year at the Center Concourse of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Bus Terminal, In front of the Golden Statue of the Skating Rink at Rockefeller Center and in 1964 at the New York Pavilion of the World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, New York. The entire Regiment of Cadets marched each year in the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade and Columbus Day parade. The school also sent partial units to include the color guard and the marching band to local Memorial Day events in Monroe, New York.

India Currents. Vol. 19. Iss. 4. p. 12. In 2002, the law was changed and the spouse of a person with L-1A or L-1B status were allowed to request authorization to work in the United States. A spouse in L-2 status who wants to work must obtain an Employment Authorization Document (EAD). A person in L-2 status with an EAD is allowed to work for any employer. Dependent children in L-2 are not authorized to work in the United States. They are allowed to attend school.  Renewals  L-2 status may be renewed and extended within the United States when the L-1 visa is renewed. Renewal in the United States applies to status only, not the actual visa in the passport. For visa renewal, the applicant must go to a U.S. consulate or embassy outside the United States. An alien cannot leave the United States and then re-enter without a valid L-1 or L-2 visa, and must appear personally before a consular officer for visa issuance. This often leads to difficulties for applicants, because it means leaving their adopted home in the United States for as long as it takes the embassy to issue their new visa. At particularly busy times of year, or at some consulates or embassies, this can take several weeks or more. The L-2 visa The L-2 visa allows the dependent spouse and unmarried children under 21 years of age of qualified L-1 visa holders to enter into the U.S. Privileges The applicant may: * Reside in the U.S. for the duration of the L-1 visa holder's authorized duration of stay * Work on a full-time basis in the U.S. with proper employment authorization from the USCIS * Engage in full-time study in the U.S. * Travel in and out of the U.S. on short trips and return Allowable length of stay The allowable duration of stay is as long as the primary L-1 visa holder maintains valid status, or up to a maximum of seven years, whichever is shorter. How to apply The following must be submitted: * Completed visa application along with the applicable draft amount * Original valid passport * Two recent color photographs * Original marriage certificate * Copy of the applicant's parent's or spouse's L-1 approval * Parent's or spouse's employment verification letter * Demand draft for visa application fee * Demand draft for visa issuance fee Length of processing The law states that the USCIS shall issue Employment Authorization documents within 90 days. However, at some service centers, the wait exceeds 90 days. Employment Authorization is not received within 90 days There is an option to submit a new Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, along with copies of the required supporting documents and the receipt for the original application at the Service Centre closest. Based on this, the applicant will receive an Employment Authorization document which is valid for 240 days while the USCIS processes the two year employment authorization document. Length of validity The Employment Authorization document is valid for two years and may be renewed. Type of employment There is no limit on the nature of the authorized employment. The USCIS refers to this as 'open market' employment authorization. H-1B temporary professional working status Time in the U.S. on L-2 visa will not count against the six years the law allows the applicant to work in the U.S. on H-1B visa. The USCIS approves H-1B status for professional workers in up to three year intervals. If the applicant was unemployed or out of status between H-1B jobs, the USCIS would count that time. Adjustment to legal permanent resident The applicant can apply for Adjustment of Status. Form I-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status must be filed with the USCIS. Advance Parole when travelling abroad There is no need to apply for Advance Parole if the L-2 visa holder wishes to travel internationally. This is true as long as nonimmigrant status is maintained. Change from H-4 to L-2 status to get work authorization If the applicants spouse qualifies for L-1 status, they can apply for a change of status from H-4 to L-2 status and the spouse from H-1B to L-1 status. To obtain work authorization, submit Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization, together with Form I-539, Application for Change or Extension of Status.

The founder of the School is Mosse J√∏rgensen. The New School is a semi-private/semi-public (i.e. free), not for profit organisation owned by the parents of the children (primary and secondary school children). The movement behind the school traces its origins to the core of the historical establishment of research-based Pedagogics at the University of Jena in 1927 by Professor Peter Petersen. Pedagogy was then a novel science as a humanistic science within the University, Academic sector. The New school was precedented by a high school, The Research High School in Oslo, founded by Mosse J√∏rgensen in 1969, based on the same research and tenets as the New School of 2004 in Oslo, Norway. The movement behind is understood as the movement creating the Unity school reform in 1936 in Norway, and is associated with the international school reform-movement for a child friendly, child oriented school. This reform made the Norwegian school system to be the first in the World to found a national public educational system on the findings of the scientific research on the novel science of Pedagogy. That is a school that takes as its primary reasons the individual potential for practical and theoretical learning, communal responsibility and democratic skills. The New School is defined by the following parameters. (It is thought that scientific research on learning has shown that these principles makes the best conditions for education and learning): Self-initiated learning Education (i.e. educational programmes) is not synonymous with learning. The best effect of learning comes when the pupils are motivated; that the initiative for the learning process comes from the pupil. Therefore this tenet of the New School define those who receives and guides the initiative of the motivated pupil into knowledge/practice/skills/wisdom as teacher. Democracy In all New Schools there are a common place, now called the Ring, that functions as a kind of old Norse Thing, or parliament. Here all who works at the school contributes to the democratic arrangements of everyday life at the school. This implies that this is an assembly where the children/students always will be the majority in numbers. A school-meeting can by principle be summoned whenever someone wishes to do so. It is done by signaling with a bell, or by the help of an adult or elder pupil at the school. In practice anyone involved in the situation are obliged to meet. Once a week a regular school-meeting is held where issues of concern are discussed, processed and decided. The democratic school-meeting is in principle the highest organ. It is the intention that democracy is sought to be trained on an everyday level and that practical participation in the democratic development and arrangement of the school is one of the most vital tasks for schools in our time. Democracy is recognised as the primary tool to solve conflicts non-violently. Siblings groups The New School's most distinctive mark is an organisational feature: The New School organizes groups with mixed age instead of the tradition inherited from the Prussian Military antecedent of the traditional public schools in the educational systems of the occidental world of the industrial age. There is still only one New School in Norway, but the school has many \\"siblings\\" in other countries based on similar concepts. The New School is a member of the international \\"New Education Fellowship\\".

The breed has two names because the same horse was bred in two regions in the most north-western part of Germany: East Frisia and the former grand duchy of Oldenburg. The name \\"Alt-Oldenburger\\" - alt meaning \\"old\\" - simply distinguishes this horse from its descendant, the modern Oldenburg, which is bred for sport. The AO/OF is bred by preservationists to fit the pre-World War model. Unlike the registries of the sport horses that followed them, their studbook is partly closed. However, external evaluation and performance testing of the breeding stock is still a key element in these registries. Traditionally, the region settled by the Frisians was highly agricultural, based on the fertile though marshy soil. Though Hanover is geographically close by, its terrain is more hilly and their cultures were far apart. Furthermore, the region of Oldenburg was passed back and forth between Denmark and Germany. This unique cultural mixture gives the region a distinct identity all its own, and horse breeders there responded to a dynamic market. Geographic origins The damp, low-lying region of Germany which lies between the Weser River and the Ems River is called Ostfriesland (\\"East Friesland\\"). It borders the Netherlands, and is part of a greater region traditionally known as Frisia. Frisia is characterized by the languages and dialects of the peoples who settled it, but also by its low-lying, coastal geography. In the west, it includes what are now the Dutch provinces of Friesland and Groningen; centrally, the Oldenburg region of Lower Saxony, and its northeastern region includes much of what is now Schleswig-Holstein to the border of Denmark. Frisia is the region best known for heavy warmbloods. Foundation The word \\"Oldenburg\\" was first mentioned in reference to a town in 1108, and has had many meanings over the centuries. The name applies both to the city of Oldenburg, and also the surrounding rural district, and historically a state or Grand Duchy. Prior to the 17th century, the horses of Oldenburg were of the same types found throughout Europe in the Middle Ages: small, hardy farm horses, smooth-stepping saddle horses, quicker \\"coursers\\", and a very few highly prized, powerful destriers. However, as the availability of firearms grew, heavily armored knights and their heavy mounts became impractical \\"relics of the past.\\" The Spanish horses, ancestors of the Andalusian, the Danish Fredriksborg, and the Neapolitan horse were particularly popular among the German nobility during the 17th and 18th centuries. As they collected these stallions, the residents bred them to their heavy mares, setting a foundation we would identify today as \\"baroque\\". From this base of thick, primarily dark-colored horses, the Groningen, Friesian, East Friesian, and Oldenburg would eventually be born. Kranich, an Oldenburg stallion bred by Anton G√ºnther around 1640, shows Spanish influence that was popular at the time The horses of Oldenburg have never had a State Stud, and they first gained recognition under Anton G√ºnther (1583‚Äì1667), Count of Oldenburg, who is said to have taken great personal interest in the breeding of horses. Count Anton G√ºnther returned from a trip lasting several years with a number of horses he admired in Spain, Italy, Turkey, and Poland. Later, a gift of Oldenburg horses kept the Count of Tilly from sacking Anton G√ºnther's dominion. While the breeding of horses in Ostfriese and Oldenburg was driven primarily by the nobles, without the aid of a studbook registry, the world's first ever stallion K√∂rung occurred in the region. In 1715, Georg Albrecht Prince of Ostfriese adopted this practice of rigorous evaluation of potential herd sires. The K√∂rung process spread to Oldenburg in 1755 even though state- mandated stallion inspections were almost 100 years in the future. The results were excellent, and the products were in high demand and exported for carriage driving. While the breeders at Celle developed a more refined cavalry mount around 1800, those of the Frisian marshlands sought out Cleveland Bays and Yorkshire carriage horses in greater numbers. The results were solid, good- natured heavy coaching horses, which were molded into a stable mare base by the mid-17th century. Following the state regulation of stallion inspections in 1820, the breeders of Oldenburg horses formed their own registry in 1861 and the breeders of the Ostfriesen horses did the same in 1869. Both employed rigorous selection along similar breeding goals, though up until the 20th century, few breeders kept pedigrees, and many mares and stallions were unregistered. However, participation improved as the 19th century came to a close and the threat of obsoletion became quite real. At this time, technological and economic developments were rendering irrevocable changes for the horse. Suited for the simple labor of unmechanized agriculture, the horses were now overshadowed by the versatile, powerful horses of Hanover, England, and Normandy. The Karossier 1898 lithograph of a carriage-type Oldenburg, showing the traditional neck brand and \\"O\\" and crown on left hip The heyday of the elegant heavy carriage horse was the years between 1880 and 1920. Reporting from a local horse market in 1864, an observer writes that each year the sale has more horses to offer, all well-bred and beautiful, and that their buyers came from far and wide. \\"Trading is brisk, especially for the luxury horses, for which high prices are paid\\". Producing Ostfriesen and Oldenburg horses had become quite lucrative. They were exported even to the southern reaches of the German-speaking region; Oldenburg stallions populated the freshly rebuilt Bavarian State Stud of Schwaiganger from 1870 on. Their success was such that in a very important decision, the stud commission of the Saxon State Stud of Moritzburg developed a heavy warmblood plan in 1873 which aimed to produce a horse \\"similar in type to that of the Oldenburger\\". From 1877 and 1920, two thirds of the state stallions were Oldenburgers. The first part of the 20th century saw the State Stud of Zweibr√ºcken follow suit. The population of horses in Ostfriesland alone exceeded 30,000, about 40% of which were 3 years old or younger. The new breeding direction, calling for a strong, attractive, heavy horse \\"for use as both an elegant, high-stepping carriage horse and a work horse\\" was fruitful. The K√∂rkommission in particular looked for excellent trot mechanics in the stallion selection. In Oldenburg, the progress towards the Karossier type hinged on the use of Anglo-Normans, Cleveland Bays, and halfbred Hanoverians, and had advanced so well that already a considerable number of Oldenburgs were being sent to Ostfriesland. Soon all the Ostfriesen stallion lines were headed in the same, new direction. 1910 was the height of Ostfriesen horse breeding. The type was described as possessing a distinct outline, strong foundation and a friendly, expressive head, not to mention the \\"certain elegance about the whole appearance.\\" In 1911 a spectator at the K√∂rung in Aurich noted that three types reappeared year after year: > A) A horse similar to the Oldenburg, a type of noble, heavy Karossier with a > swinging gait and great nerve, though slightly drier than most Oldenburgs; > B) A horse with reference to the Oldenburg type, though they are not always > very distinctly outlined, and are without much nobility and usually quite > common, but they are massive, robust, compact and strong. These stallions > are excellent sires for agricultural horses, > C) An elegant, easy-mannered horse, which is influencing the Hanoverian and > which the Hanoverian is more or less approaching. This type is most often an > elegant chestnut, and is relatively rare. These are the horses that made Oldenburg famous for elegant carriage horses. War era After World War I broke out, the market for luxury horses suddenly became the market for military remounts. The increased availability of cars and tractors limited the roles that horses could play in agriculture and transportation. Starting in the forties, technical advancements in agricultural machinery initially required a new type of horse, but soon after made the horse superfluous altogether in the field. So to adapt, starting in 1920 the direction changed radically: a heavy warmblood of great economy with a good walk, calm temperament, which matures early and utilizes its feed well. The type was so heavy, it stood on the boundary with the lighter coldbloods. The coldbloods of Germany were already well-suited to the new demands of farming given their immense power, and the Ostfriesen had to prove it could offer these same qualities. The one advantage for the warmbloods was their versatility. They were subsequently bred to have greater depth, breadth and strength, at the expense of the dryness, nerve, expression and gait qualities for which they had previously been selected. From 1908 to 1940, the average height of Ostfriesisches decreased 4 cm while average weight increased from 630 kg to 760 kg. Other regions began to breed heavy warmbloods: Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Hesse, Bavaria, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, Saxony, and Silesia. While they were founded on their own stock, horses from Oldenburg and Ostfriesland were sold there each year to help them realize their goals. The end of World War II saw the breeding in Ostfriesland reach record-breaking numbers, as these horses had become indispensable agricultural horses. In 1923 the two registries merged to form the Verband der Z√ºchter des Oldenburger Pferdes e.V. (Oldenburg Horse Breeders' Association), which today serves the modern Oldenburg. Post-war era By 1964, in the face of the superiority of tractors, the breeding of the heavy warmblood had completely collapsed. Stallions covered 10% of the mares that they had 20 years before. This scene played out in the 1950s and 60's throughout German horse breeding. During this time, though, increasing leisure time meant that horses soon found their modern cultural niche: recreational riding. The breeders of Ostfriesland aimed to develop their horses along this path, producing a lighter riding horse with all the economical traits that had made them popular before. Fearing that the Thoroughbred would detract from the amenable nature of their horses, the Ostfriesen breeders chose to use Arabian blood instead. Beginning in 1948, such stallions were made available to the breeders, who scarcely used them, being hard-put to change their beloved horses so drastically. However, the evidence was convincing, as the Freisen-Arabs were horses of excellent character, great capacity and riding quality. Unfortunately, they had missed the mark: the market demanded a light, elegant, but tall riding horses, and the Freisen-Arabs were smaller than their warmblood mothers. Limited in their competitiveness in dressage and jumping, the Freisen-Arabs did not sell, and the Ostfriesen horses seemed doomed to extinction. Meanwhile, the Oldenburg horses were being systematically redirected by the use of Anglo-Norman stallions like Condor, Thoroughbreds like Adonis xx, and Anglo-Arabs like Inschallah AA. Though the blood remained in their pedigrees, the Alt-Oldenburg mares could not produce stallion sons. Purebred Ostfriesisch-Oldenburg stallions were replaced in the studrows by Hanoverians, Trakehners, Thoroughbreds and Arabs. In 1967, 71% of the original mares had riding horse mates. The Ostfriesen mares were permitted into the Hanoverian forebook after producing a noble warmblood foal, but could not become stallion mothers. The last k√∂rung at Aurich took place in 1973, and in 1975 the Ostfriesische studbook became a district association of the Hanoverian Verband. The products of this new breeding direction became the modern Oldenburg (horse). Rescue By the mid-eighties the stock of purebred mares had dwindled to just a handful, though there were some mares only a generation or two removed. In 1983 a group of supporters formed a special breed association under the jurisdiction of the Weser-Ems Studbook, approving stallions that were half- Hanoverian, half-Ostfriesen or Alt-Oldenburg. However, as the mares themselves were typically only halfbred, the foals did not have the desired type, and furthermore the genepool was simply too small. To replenish it, the breeders looked to the studs where Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburger stallions had stood for generations, picking up a few horses here and there. More horses came from greater strongholds: Silesian Heavy Warmbloods of Poland, the Danish Oldenbourgs, and the Groningen horse of the Netherlands. But the efforts of Dr. Herta Steiner, Moritzburg State Stud Equerry, were the keystone to saving the breed. She had championed for the last remaining heavy warmbloods in Saxony and Thuringia. Soon the old type was revived. Since 1995, two Dutch Harness Horse stallions have been chosen to add elegance and responsiveness, though it is worth noting that these stallions had primarily Ostfriesen and Groningen pedigrees themselves, and no Hackney blood. The Zuchtverband f√ºr das Ostfriesische und Alt-Oldenburger Pferd e.V. (\\"Association for the Breeding of East Freisian and Old-Oldenburg Horses\\") was founded in 1986, and was recognized as an independent organization in 1988. Even after 20 years of hiatus, the goal is to produce a heavy, quality horse, responsive with an exceptionally good temperament. The unique character of the former farm horse is of paramount importance, as it was the peasant farms that led such kind horses to be bred in the first place. The breeding objective these days stretches back before the horses were called to haul tractors and artillery, to when they were heavy, elegant, and impressive Karossiers. The Ostfriesen and Alt-Oldenburg today A combined driving team of Ostfriesen/Alt- Oldenburger geldings Today there are 20 approved stallions and 160 broodmares in the northern population of heavy warmbloods. They are bred with a pure- breeding scheme, using Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburg, Groningen, Saxony-Thuringian Heavy Warmbloods, and Silesian Heavy Warmbloods. The goal is a versatile, correct and balanced horse with a calm temperament. Desirable is a horse with a strong constitution, peaceful companionable temperament, which utilizes its feed well, has high fertility, and is suitable as a riding and driving horse. The walk and trot should be efficient and expansive, the latter with some action. The physique should speak of a moderately elegant horse of great depth and breadth, well-sprung ribs and a strong hind end. The head should be expressive with a large, friendly eye. The neck is muscular, medium-length, well-formed and set high on a long, sloping, muscular shoulder with defined withers. The back is medium-long, solid and elastic with a broad loin, the croup slightly sloped, wide and muscular. The limbs should be correct and dry with great bone strength, very strong joints suited to the horse's size, ending in the all-important well-shaped hooves. At three years the horse is expected to stand between 158 and 165 cm tall, with a canon circumference of 22 to 24 cm. The primary colors are black, seal brown, and dark bay, though bay, chestnut, and grey do occur. Typically, they are conservatively marked. They are traditionally shown in a wide white leather bridle without the cavesson. Because of their gentle natures, Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburgers are useful not just in sport and driving, but for recreation, police work and therapeutic riding. They are also used in forests for ecological reasons. Fourteen black Ostfriesen/Alt-Oldenburg geldings were sold recently to the Household Cavalry.

King Faisal II, Prince 'Abd al-Ilah, and Prime Minister Nuri al-Said were killed during the uprising. As a result of the overthrow of the Iraqi Hashemite dynasty, the coup d'√©tat established the Iraqi Republic. The coup ended the Hashemite Arab Federation between Iraq and Jordan that had been established just 6 months earlier. Abd al-Karim Qasim took power as Prime Minister until 1963, when he was overthrown and killed in the Ramadan Revolution. Pre-coup grievances=Regional disturbances= During World War II, Iraq was home to a growing number of Arab nationalists. They aimed, in part, to remove British imperial influence in Iraq.. This sentiment grew from a politicised educational system in Iraq and an increasingly assertive and educated middle class.. Schools served as instruments to internalise Pan-Arab nationalist identity as the leaders and the designers of the Iraqi educational system in the 1920s and 1930s were Pan- Arab nationalists who made a significant contribution to the expansion of that ideology in Iraq as well as the rest of the Arab world. The two directors of the educational system in Iraq, Sami Shawkat and Fadhil al-Jamal, employed teachers who were political refugees from Palestine and Syria. These exiles fled to Iraq because of their roles in anti-British and anti-French protests, and subsequently fostered Arab nationalist consciousness in their Iraqi students. The growing general awareness of Arab identity led to anti- imperialism. Similarly, Pan-Arab sentiment grew across the Arab world and was promoted by Egypt's Gamel Abdel Nasser, a rising politician and staunch opponent of imperialism. Hashemite Iraq faced and confronted these sentiments as well. Nuri al-Said, the Iraqi Prime Minister during most of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, was interested in pursuing the idea of a federation of Arab States of the Fertile Crescent, but was less enthusiastic about a Pan-Arab state. Al-Said brought Iraq into the Arab League in 1944, seeing it as a forum for bringing together the Arab states while leaving the door open for a possible future federation.. The League's charter enshrined the principle of autonomy for each Arab state and referenced pan-Arabism only rhetorically. =Economic climate= The Iraqi economy fell into a recession and then a depression following World War II; inflation was uncontrolled and the Iraqi standard of living fell.. Al-Said and the Arab Nationalist regent, Abd al- Ilah, were continually in opposition to each other, failing to agree on a cohesive economic policy, infrastructure improvements, or other internal reforms. In 1950, al-Said persuaded the Iraqi Petroleum Company to increase the royalties paid to the Iraqi government. Al-Said looked to Iraq's growing oil revenues to fund and propel development.. He determined that 70 percent of Iraq's revenue from oil was to be set aside for infrastructure development by a Development Board with three foreign advisors out of six total members. This foreign presence provoked popular disapproval of al-Said's policy.. Despite anti-Western sentiments toward oil and development, al-Said hired economist Arthur Salter to investigate the prospects for development in Iraq because al- Said's oil revenue reallocation seemed to be ineffective.. Salter continued to make suggestionsSalter, A., and S. W. Payton. The development of Iraq; a plan of action by Lord Salter, assisted by S.W. Payton. 1955. London: Caxton, for the Iraq Development Board as to how to implement development projects despite massive Iraqi dislike of his presence. =Political grievances= During World War II, the British reoccupied Iraq and in 1947, through the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1948 (also known as the Portsmouth Treaty) on 15 January, Salih Jabr negotiated British withdrawal from Iraq. This agreement included a British and Iraqi joint defence board to oversee Iraqi military planning, and the British continued to control Iraqi foreign affairs.. Iraq was still tied to Great Britain for military supplies and training. This treaty was to last until 1973‚Äîa 25-year period that Arab nationalists in Iraq could not accept.. As a strong reaction to the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1948, Arab nationalists led the Wathbah Rebellion a year later in protest of the continued British presence in Iraq. Al-Said repudiated the Portsmouth Treaty to appease the rebellious Iraqi and Arab nationalists. In 1955, Iraq entered into the Baghdad Pact with Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey. The pact was a defence agreement between the four nations and was endorsed by the UK and the United States as an anti-communist Cold War strategy, but was greatly resented by Iraqis in general.. Egypt saw the Baghdad Pact as a provocation and a challenge to its regional dominance. In 1956, when Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal, Iraqi-Egyptian relations were further strained. When British, French and Israelis invaded Egypt, Iraq, as a British ally, had to support the invasion. The fact that imperial ties dragged Iraq into supporting this invasion of Arab lands led to wide disapproval across the Iraqi populace, which largely sympathised with Egypt and responded to pan-Arab ideology. They felt that the invasion of Egypt was another sign of Western aggression and dominance in the region. Similarly, when Egypt and Syria united to form the United Arab Republic (UAR) under the banner of pan- Arabism in 1958, Iraqi politicians found themselves in a vulnerable position. Iraqi leaders had no interest in uniting with Egypt and instead proposed and ratified their own pan-Arab union with Hashemite Jordan in May 1958. Great Britain and the United States openly supported this union, but many Iraqis were suspicious of its purpose and regarded the Arab Union of Iraq and Jordan as another \\"tool of their Western overlord\\". =Precursors= The primary goal of the coup was to liberate Iraq from its imperial ties with the British and the United States. The Western powers dominated all sectors of Iraqi governance: national politics and reform, regional politics with its Arab and non-Arab neighbours, and economic policies. As a general rule, many Iraqis were resentful of the presence of Western powers in the region, especially the British. Furthermore, Hashemite monarchic rule could not be divorced from the image of imperial masters behind the monarchy. The monarchy had struggled to maintain power during the Al-Wathbah uprising in 1948 and the Iraqi Intifada of 1952. =Discord mounts= A growing number of educated elites in Iraq were becoming enamoured with the ideals espoused by Nasser's pan-Arab movement. The ideas of ' found many willing adherents, particularly within the officer classes of the Iraqi military. Al-Said's policies were considered anathema by certain individuals within the Iraqi armed forces, and opposition groups began to form, modelled on the Egyptian Free Officers Movement that had overthrown the Egyptian monarchy in 1952. Despite al-Said's efforts to quell growing unrest with the military ranks (such as economic programs designed to benefit the officer class, and brokering deals with the U.S. to supply the Iraqi military),. his position was significantly weakened by the events of the Suez Crisis. Al-Said suffered for his association with Britain; the latter's role in the Crisis seeming a damning indictment of his ' policies; . Despite al- Said's efforts to distance himself from the crisis, the damage was done to his position. Iraq became isolated within the Arab world, as highlighted by its exclusion from the \\"Treaty of Arab Solidarity\\" in January 1957.. The Suez Crisis benefited Nasser's pan-Arab cause while simultaneously undermining those Arab leaders who followed pro-Western policy. Al-Said's policies fell firmly within the latter camp, and covert opposition to his government steadily grew in the wake of Suez. =Building to a crisis= On 1 February 1958, Egypt and Syria boosted the pan-Arab movement immeasurably with the announcement that they had united as the United Arab Republic (UAR).. The move was a catalyst for a series of events that culminated in revolution in Iraq. The formation of the UAR and Nasser's lofty rhetoric calling for a united Arab world galvanised pan-Arabism in Iraq and Jordan. Their governments attempted something of a response with the creation of the Arab Federation on 14 February.‚Äîa union of the two states‚Äîbut few were impressed by this knee-jerk reaction to the UAR. The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen (North Yemen) joined the UAR soon after its formation. Attention then shifted to Lebanon, where Syria sponsored the Arab nationalist movement in its civil war campaign against the pro-Western government of Camille Chamoun.. Al-Said recognised that Chamoun's defeat would leave Iraq and Jordan isolated. He bolstered Chamoun's government with aid throughout May and June 1958. More fatefully he attempted to bolster Jordan with units from the Iraqi army, a move that was a direct catalyst for the coup d'√©tat. 14 July revolution Leaders of the 14 July 1958 revolution in Iraq, including Khaled al-Naqshabendi (front row, left), Abd as-Salam Arif (back row, second from left), Abd al-Karim Qasim (back row, third from left) and Muhammad Najib ar-Ruba'i (back row, fifth from left). Also included is Michel Aflaq (front row, first from right). On 14 July 1958, a group that identified as the Free Officers, a secret military group led by Brigadier Abd al-Karim Qasim, overthrew the monarchy. This group was markedly Pan-Arab in character. King Faisal II, Prince Abd al-Ilah, and Nuri al-Said were all killed.. The mutilated corpses of Prince 'Abd al-Ilah of Hejaz (left) and Prime Minister Nuri al-Said (right). Arabic text: \\"Prince 'Abd al-Ilah hung and cut up by shawerma knives, Pasha Nuri al-Said pulled around.\\" The Free Officers were inspired by and modelled after the Egyptian Free Officers who overthrew the Egyptian Monarchy in 1952. They represented all parties and cut across political factions.; . Qasim was a member of the generation that had launched the revolution in Egypt, and had grown up in an era where radicalism and Pan-Arabism were circulating in schools, including high schools and military academies.. As a group, most of the Free Officers were Sunni Arabs who came from a modern middle class.. The Free Officers were inspired by a number of events in the Middle East the decade before 1952. The 1948 War against Israel was an experience that intensified the Egyptian Free Officers' sense of duty. They understood their mission as deposing the corrupt regimes that weakened a unified Arab nation and thrown their countries into distress. The success of the Free Officers in overthrowing the Egyptian monarchy and seizing power in 1952 made Nasser a source of inspiration too. The Iraqi Free Officer group was an underground organization and much of the planning and timing rested in the hands of Qasim and his associate, Colonel Abdul Salam Arif. The Free Officers sought to ensure Nasser's support and the assistance of the UAR to implement the revolt because they feared the members of the Baghdad Pact would subsequently overthrow the Free Officers as a reaction to the coup. Nasser only offered moral support, whose material significance remained vague, so Egypt had no practical role in the Iraqi revolution. The dispatching of Iraqi army units to Jordan played into the hands of two of the key members of the Iraqi Free Officers movement: Arif and the movement's leader, Qasim. The Iraqi 19th and 20th Brigades of the 3rd Division (Iraq) (the former under Qasim's command and the latter including Arif's battalion) were dispatched to march to Jordan, along a route that passed Baghdad. The opportunity for a coup was thus presented to and seized upon by the conspirators. Arif marched on Baghdad with the 20th Brigade and seized control of the capital (with the help of Colonel Abd al-Latif al- Darraji) while Qasim remained in reserve with the 19th at Jalawla.. In the early hours of 14 July, Arif seized control of Baghdad's broadcasting station, which was soon to become the coup's headquarters, and broadcast the first announcement of the revolution. Arif \\"denounced imperialism and the clique in office; proclaimed a new republic and the end of the old regime...announced a temporary sovereignty council of three members to assume the duties of the presidency; and promised a future election for a new president\\". Arif then dispatched two detachments from his regiment, one to al-Rahab Palace to deal with King Faisal II and the Crown Prince 'Abd al-Ilah, the other to Nuri al- Said's residence. Despite the presence of the crack Royal Guard at the Palace, no resistance was offered, by order of the Crown Prince. It is uncertain what orders were given to the palace detachment, and what level of force they detailed. At approximately 8:00am the King, Crown Prince, Princess Hiyam ('Abd al-Ilah's wife), Princess Nafeesa ('Abd al-Ilah's mother), Princess Abadiya (Faisal's aunt), other members of the Iraqi Royal Family, and several servants were killed or wounded as they were leaving the palace.. Only Princess Hiyam survived although how and why she did is unclear. With their demise, the Iraqi Hashemite dynasty ended. Meanwhile, al-Said temporarily slipped the net of his would-be captors by escaping across the Tigris after being alerted by the sound of gunfire. By noon, Qasim arrived in Baghdad with his forces and set up headquarters in the Ministry of Defence building. The conspirator's attention now shifted to finding al-Said, lest he escape and undermine the coup's early success. A reward of 10,000 Iraqi dinar was offered for his capture. and a large-scale search began. On 15 July he was spotted in a street in the al- Battawin quarter of Baghdad attempting to escape disguised in a woman's abaya.. Al-Said and his accomplice were both shot, and his body was buried in the cemetery at Bab al-Mu'azzam later that evening. Mob violence continued even in the wake of al-Said's death. Spurred by Arif to liquidate traitors, uncontrollable mobs took to the streets of Baghdad. The body of 'Abd al-Ilah was taken from the palace, mutilated and dragged through the streets, and finally hanged outside the Ministry of Defence. Several foreign nationals (including Jordanian and American citizens) staying at the Baghdad Hotel were killed by the mob. Mass mob violence did not die down until Qasim imposed a curfew, which still did not prevent the disinterment, mutilation and parading of Al-Said's corpse through the streets the day after its burial.: \\"At first he [Said] was buried in a shallow grave but later the body was dug up and repeatedly run over by municipal buses, 'until, in the words of a horror- struck eyewitness, it resembled bastourma, an Iraqi [pressed] sausage meat'.\\" Aftermath=Immediate effects= Crowd of men and soldiers in downtown Amman, Jordan, watching a news report about the deposition, 14 July 1958 Abd al-Karim Qasim's sudden coup took the U.S. government by surprise. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director Allen Dulles told President Dwight D. Eisenhower that he believed Nasser was behind it. Dulles also feared that a chain reaction would occur throughout the Middle East and that the governments of Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran would be doomed.. The Hashemite monarchy represented a reliable ally of the Western world in thwarting Soviet advances, so the coup compromised Washington's position in the Middle East. Indeed, the Americans saw it in epidemiological terms.As in Kuwait for example: \\"The situation in Kuwait is very shaky as a result of the coup in Iraq, and there is a strong possibility that the revolutionary infection will spread there.\\" See The frantic Anglo-American reaction to the developments in Iraq, which Allen Dulles asserted was \\"primarily a UK responsibility\\", makes for an interesting read, beginning here. Qasim reaped the greatest reward, being named Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Arif became Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior, and deputy Commander in Chief. Thirteen days after the revolution, a temporary constitution was announced, pending a permanent organic law to be promulgated after a free referendum. According to the document, Iraq was a republic and a part of the Arab nation and the official state religion was listed as Islam. Both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies were abolished. Powers of legislation were vested in the Council of Ministers, with the approval of the Sovereignty Council; the executive function was also vested in the Council of Ministers. =1959 instability= On 9 March 1959, The New York Times reported that the situation in Iraq was initially \\"confused and unstable, with rival groups competing for control. Cross currents of communism, Arab and Iraqi nationalism, anti-Westernism and the 'positive neutrality' of President Gamal Abdel Nasser of the United Arab Republic have been affecting the country.\\" The new Iraqi Republic was headed by a Revolutionary Council. At its head was a three-man sovereignty council, composed of members of Iraq's three main communal/ethnic groups. Muhammad Mahdi Kubbah represented the Shi'a population; Khalid al-Naqshabandi, the Kurds; and Najib al Rubay‚Äôi, the Sunni population.. This tripartite Council assumed the role of the Presidency. A cabinet was created, composed of a broad spectrum of Iraqi political movements, including two National Democratic Party representatives, one member of al-Istiqlal, one Ba'ath representative and one Marxist. By March 1959, Iraq withdrew from the Baghdad Pact and created alliances with left-leaning countries and communist countries, including the Soviet Union.. Because of their agreement with the USSR, Qasim's government allowed the formation of an Iraqi Communist Party. =Human rights violations and mass exodus= Kanan Makiya compared the trials of political dissidents under the Iraqi monarchy, Qasim's government, and Ba'athist Iraq, concluding: \\"A progressive degradation in the quality of each spectacle is evident.\\" The 1958 military coup that overthrew the Hashemite monarchy brought to power members of \\"rural groups that lacked the cosmopolitan thinking found among Iraqi elites\\". Iraq's new leaders had an \\"exclusivist mentality [that] produced tribal conflict and rivalry, which in turn called forth internal oppression [...]\\" According to Shafeeq N. Ghabra, a professor of political science at Kuwait University, and, in 2001, director of the Kuwait Information Office in Washington D.C.:Ghabra, Shafeeq N., \\"Iraq's Culture of Violence\\", article in Middle East Quarterly, Summer 2001, accessed 16 October 2013; in a footnote at the end of the first sentence (\\"... political compromise.\\"), Ghabra cites Sa‚Äòd al-Bazzaz, Ramad al-Hurub: Asrar ma Ba‚Äòd Hurub al-Khalij, 2d ed. (Beirut: al-Mu'assasa al-Ahliya li'n-Nashr wa't-Tawzi‚Äò, 1995), p. 22. :After the 1958 revolution, Iraq's ruling establishment created a state devoid of political compromise. Its leaders liquidated those holding opposing views, confiscated property without notice, trumped up charges against its enemies, and fought battles with imaginary domestic foes. This state of affairs reinforced an absolute leader and a militarized Iraqi society totally different from the one that existed during the monarchy. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqis fled the country within four years of the 1958 revolution.

Wang was implicated during the murder trial of the United Bamboo Gang leader Chen Chi-li, when evidence arose that Chen claimed that Wang had ordered him to go to Daly City, California to kill the dissident journalist Henry Liu in 1984. American officials travelled to Taiwan to interview him and administer a polygraph examination in February 1985; then-President Chiang Ching-kuo was at first reluctant, but on 8 February acceded to their demand. Wang denied that he had ordered Chen to kill Liu, stating he only wanted Chen to \\"teach Liu a lesson\\", and further denied that his superiors had approved the killing. His three interviewers agreed that the polygraph results showed that both of his statements were false. On 19 April 1985, he was sentenced to life in prison by a Taipei military tribunal; He could have faced the death penalty. Less than a month later, Chen retracted all of his testimony implicating Wang. Wang was imprisoned at the Taiwan Garrison Command facility for political prisoners in Jingmei, Taipei County (now Wenshan District, Taipei City); his cell was reportedly equipped with a kitchen and a study, and his family was allowed to live with him. He, Chen, and Chen's associate Wu Tun were granted clemency in 1991 and released from prison, having served less than six years of their life sentences. It was never determined for whom Wang was covering up, though scholars agree that he was not the initiator of the plan. Later analysts suggest that Chiang's son Chiang Hsiao-wu ordered the killings. However, as late as 2007, Republic of China officials continued to deny any connection of Chiang's to the case.

His father sold Base and his brother Tattoo of Tektos to the Yakuza to act as drug runners, but they were eventually captured by Dr. Oonagh Mullarkey's Mutagenic Search Squad. His memories were rewritten so that he believed he had been an orphan brought up by a secretive group of warrior priests known as the Hikari-No- Michi, which means the Path of Light, and that he had been advancing under their training, but had to flee when his powers went out of control and he accidentally destroyed the temple. He was also conditioned to believe that Mullarkey found him, befriended him, and helped him control his powers. Mullarkey sent the newly created Genetix after Killpower when he was sent through time.Killpower: the Early Years #1-4 The Genetix were still working as agents of Gena-Sys under Dr. Mullarkey when they battled the organism Sporr.

Parlour boarders are described by a modern historian as paying more than the other pupils, in return for which they got a room of their own. A parlour was a small reception room, from the French \\"parler\\", implying a place for quiet conversation; \\"board\\" means meals, as in the expression room and board. The term is mostly historic in British English. In 18th and 19th century England, there were a profusion of small schools, always single-sex, with the number of pupils ranging from fewer than a dozen to a few score, on a much more domestic scale than the so-called public schools such as Eton and Harrow. Many of these small schools were operated on a family basis, often by a married couple (for boys), or by sisters or female friends (for girls). They would accept day pupils, common boarders, and parlour boarders. 18-19th centuries Elizabeth Lachlan was at school in London when its owner, a Miss Shepherd, impulsively decided to move her school from Percy Street to France during the Peace of Amiens in 1802. She set out on this venture with \\"thirty to forty girls of respectable families, and ten or twelve ladies as parlour boarders\\".cited in Skedd, footnote 24 Thomas Reynolds (1771‚Äì1836), the Irish informer, son of a wealthy textile manufacturer, was sent at eight years old as a parlour boarder to the school of Rev. Archibald Crawford at Chiswick, then a village on the outskirts of London. :The school was composed of eight parlour-boarders, and about sixty other lads. The parlour-boarders lived entirely at the Doctor's table, and joined in all his society as part of his family. In their walks they were usually accompanied by the Doctor himself, who rarely intrusted that responsibility to an usher. 20th century The Indian diplomat Venkata Siddharthacharry was largely educated in England, and entitled a chapter of his memoir \\"Parlour Boarder\\". He defines it as a situation that allows access \\"to both the family dining room and the family drawing room\\", \\"a great privilege naturally, paid for sumptuously\\". One much-valued benefit was the fire, which was lit from mid- autumn \\"right up to the end of spring\\", in contrast to the frigid dormitories. The Jesuit school named after Francis de Sales in Nagpur, India, even in the mid 20th century: :ran a three tier system of boarding. Parlour boarders, ordinary boarders, and charity boarders. The Parlour boarders were treated like residents of a five star hotel, Ordinary like two star residents, and Charity like poor relations, only a little better off than the orphan children described in the novels of Charles Dickens. One Anglo-Indian family sent the light-skinned son as a parlour boarder, while his darker brothers were merely ordinary boarders.page 106 above (See Discrimination based on skin color or \\"colorism\\".)

He was born and raised in Minnesota. He went to high school in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, and then attended St. Olaf College in Northfield. After graduating with a B.A. in political science, he earned a Master's of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary in New York City.

He is married to his wife of 34 years, Sara, with whom he has three daughters, Hannah, Audrey and Naomi. He is a pacifist and a Lutheran. Views In his book Brave New World Order (first published 1992, reissued 2017), Nelson-Pallmeyer provides a definition of \\"national security state\\". He describes seven defining characteristics, starting with the military exerting influence over economic and political affairs and progressing through maintaining an appearance of democracy while ultimate power rests with the national security establishment; concentration of capital by elites; obsession with enemies; and restricting and distorting information, among others. He summarizes how this found expression in El Salvador and discusses \\"similar dynamics\\" within the United States. 2006 U.S. House election Nelson-Pallmeyer announced his intention to challenge incumbent Democrat Martin Sabo for Minnesota's 5th congressional district U.S. House of Representatives seat in early 2006. After Sabo announced he was retiring, several other Democrats announced their intentions to run for the House seat. At the district convention in May, Keith Ellison won the endorsement after Nelson-Pallmeyer withdrew from the endorsement process and threw his support to Ellison, who went on to win the general election. 2008 U.S. Senate election On October 10, 2007, Nelson-Pallmeyer announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Norm Coleman. He ran against Al Franken for the DFL Party nomination.

History The club was formed in 1978 by Croatian migrants and languished in the lower leagues of the Schwaben football league system for most of its short existence. It climbed into higher-level competition through the financial support of Croatian construction company Enikon. The team rose rapidly through the early 1990s, earning four consecutive promotions. A championship in the Bezirksliga Schwaben-S√ºd (VII) in 1992 advanced the side to the Bezirksoberliga Schwaben (VI). After finishing second there, they won promotion to the Landesliga Bayern-S√ºd (V) through the promotion play-off. Another second-place result and a successful promotion round with the other Landesliga runners-up gained the team entry to the Bayernliga (IV) for the 1994‚Äì95 season. Enikon's primary objective was to one day play league games against the long established and well-known local side FC Augsburg. They narrowly missed that goal as FCA was promoted ahead of them to the Regionalliga S√ºd (III). The club found competition in the Bayernliga to be more difficult and struggled for survival there. After a promising start in which Enikon won their first two matches of the season, the club quickly fell into the relegation zone. They finished in 16th place with a record of ten wins, nine draws and fifteen defeats and would have been immediately sent down if not for the withdrawal of 1. FC Amberg from the league allowing Enikon to take Amberg's spot in the relegation play- offs.Bayernliga table 1994-95 Weltfussball.de, accessed: 1 May 2011 They won their first round match over Alemannia Haibach (2:1), but were sent back down to Landesliga play after losing to SpVgg Weiden. =Disbanding of the club= As the club's Bayernliga campaign was coming to a close it became clear that sponsor Enikon could not continue its support and that without their financial backing the team could not afford to carry on in the upcoming season. The decision was made to withdraw and FC was disbanded after the 1994‚Äì95 season. A proposal to merge with TSG Augsburg to retain a Landesliga spot for an Augsburg team did not materialize as TSG were themselves struggling financially. =Legacy= Like many immigrant-based clubs in Germany, Enikon suffered from the lack of a home ground and training facilities throughout its existence, having to share facilities with other clubs in Augsburg. The club was well recognized in the region for the technical skill of its players, who were mostly, but not exclusively, of Croatian origin. Support for this is found in the club's rapid rise, and its 1994 win in the Schwaben indoor football championship followed by a second-place result in the Bavarian championship. FC Enikon remains to this day the most successful non-Turkish migrant club in Bavaria.

A shell stitch (or fan stitch) is a crochet motif often used as a border around other patterns or in staggered rows to create a distinctive fabric pattern. Shell stitches take the shape of arcs and semicircles, hence the name.Stoller, p. 57. Shell stitches are often used as edging for crocheted items such as Afghan blankets and sweaters.Eckman, p. 218. Construction A pet blanket constructed from a single granny square with a shell stitch border, enhanced in a contrasting color with half double crochet. The basic method of producing shell stitches is to anchor several long stitches into the same base, anchoring both ends with short stitches in a manner that spreads out the cluster like a fan. Although many variations are possible, a basic shell stitch in United States terminology would be single crochet, skip two, five double crochets into previous single crochet, skip two, then single crochet into middle double crochet. In abbreviated terminology, it would read 5 dcs into previous sc, sk 2 dcs, sc into middle dc. Variant patterns may use longer stitches such as triple crochet, may vary the number of stitches, or alter the anchoring method. Schematic of solid shell stitch, in international symbols. The chain stitches at the bottom are shown only for scale, and are not repeated in the main fabric. Shell stitch borders can be worked around any regular pattern.Dilmont. Accessed 7 January 2008. The visual effect of a shell stitch border may be enhanced by working a single or half double crochet in a contrasting color into the base row and over the shells. When the entire fabric consists of shell stitches the visual effect may be enhanced by alternating two or three different colors; one for each row. Fan stitch The outer half of this doily was done in a fan stitch. Schematic of a crochet fan stitch, in international symbols. Fan stitch is closely related to shell stitch. We may define a \\"shell\\" as five crochet stitches (usually double crochets) done into a single stitch, whereas a \\"fan\\" is two such stitches, followed by a chain and two more such stitches. Fan stitch crochet also differs in that the fans are generally stacked on top of one another, with each fan being done into the middle chain of the fan in the previous row, which splits the previous fan into two symmetrical parts. For comparison, shells are not split and, in solid shell stitch, are half-staggered; each shell is done into the single crochet between the shells of the previous row.

An enigmatic figure, of whom little biographical information has yet emerged, he was one of the earliest composers of madrigals as well as a prominent musician at the Este court in the early 16th century.  Biography  Nothing is known of his early life, other than that he was French, for the earliest reference to him in the records of the Este court in Ferrara are as a \\"singer from France.\\" He received his first payment from them in 1512, and remained employed there until his death 26 years later. During that time, as evident from the number of dedications made to him and favorable commentary in the records, he must have been honored; and he was maestro di cappella, choirmaster, for an unknown amount of the time. Several contemporary writers, including influential music theorist Adrianus Coclico, mention him as an expert composer.Nugent, Haar, Grove online Several composers with similar names have been confused with Maistre Jhan. Pioneering 19th-century French musicologist Fran√ßois-Joseph F√©tis mistook him for Jhan Gero; records at Ferrara seem to identify him with Jehan le Cocq and Johannus Gallus, people who have since been determined to be separate individuals; a Maistre Jhan in Verona has turned out to be Jan Nasco.Einstein, V. I p. 307  Works and influence  While famous during his time, Jhan's work has largely faded into obscurity. He wrote in most of the genres current in the early 16th century, including, in sacred vocal music, masses (all but one of which are lost), motets, and lamentations. In style the sacred music is similar to the work of Josquin des Prez (died 1521), using imitative passages alternating with homophony. Jhan wrote his one surviving setting of the mass for the accession to the dukedom of Ercole II d'Este (1534); it uses cantus-firmus technique. Jhan's secular music includes madrigals and at least one chanson. The madrigals appear in publications from 1530 to 1550; his five madrigals published in 1530, along with works by Philippe Verdelot, are part of the first book of madrigals ever to be published with that name. In 1542 three of his madrigals appear alongside composers such as Costanzo Festa, Francesco Corteccia, and Hubert Naich; the style of his works is similar to that of Verdelot, and represents the earliest stage of the genre, before it developed its peculiar individuality.

He also served as a member of the Authority for the Advancement of Women and the Israel Women's Network. After the Likud won the 2001 elections and Ariel Sharon became Prime Minister, Hasson was appointed head of the Public Affairs Division in the Prime Ministers Office. Hasson served as the advisor to the PM on Public Inquiries during Sharon's term. In 2005, PM Sharon made a political shift, left the Likud and established the centrist Kadima party. Hasson and other figures from the liberal wing of the Likud and from the Labor party, such as Tzipi Livni and Shimon Peres, also joined Kadima under Sharon‚Äôs leadership. In the 2006 elections, Hasson was elected 29th on Kadima‚Äôs primary list, which won 29 seats for the Knesset. In June 2006, Hasson was nominated as the President of the 35th World Zionist Congress.

Towards the Israeli legislative election, Yoel Hasson was placed seventh on the list of candidates for the newly established Hatnuah Party. However, the party won six seats, so he did not enter into the next Knesset term. Knesset Term 20 Prior to the legislative elections on March 2015, Hasson was involved in the process of establishing the \\"Zionist Union\\", which is a political union between the Labor Party led by Isaac Herzog and Hatnuah Party led by Tzipi Livni.

He went on to study at the prestigious Amirim Program of Excellence at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he gained a BA with distinction in economics. Plesner then spent several years in the business world, first as a consultant to major financial corporations in Britain, and then as co-founder and manager of an international software company. He studied at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he earned an MPA in political economics and security studies, and spoke regularly on behalf of Israel. Upon his return to Israel, Plesner assumed the position of Head of Special Projects in the Prime Minister's Office under then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. When the Kadima Party was founded in early 2006, Plesner was appointed the first Secretary-General of the nascent party, and led the formation of its organizational infrastructure. Plesner lives in Hod HaSharon with his wife Shimrit and their three children Talia, Abigail and Dan. He also has two daughters, Michaela and Ayala, from a previous marriage to Matat, a lawyer.http://www.mako.co.il/weekend- articles/Article-7d56a246bc75831006.htm Member of the Knesset from 2007 to 2013 Plesner became a member of Knesset in 2007. During his time in the legislature, Plesner spoke out on issues ranging from national security and electoral reform to preservation of the environment and excellence in education. The Knesset Ethics Committee censured Plesner in 2011 for making ‚Äúinsulting and harmful comments that are not connected to political stances and public life, but rather an MK‚Äôs personal life.‚Äù Plesner, during a Haneen Zoabi speech on the Gaza Flotilla, said of Zoabi, ‚ÄúGo to Gaza for a week and see what happens to you, a single 38-year-old woman.‚Äù Plesner was, in 2012, Deputy Chairman of the Kadima Faction and a member of both the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee and of the Defense and Foreign Relations Committee. He was also founder of the European Forum of the Knesset, a parliamentary group dedicated to improving relations between the Knesset and European legislators, and chaired the Knesset's permanent delegation to the Council of Europe. Placed third on the Kadima list for the 2013 elections, he lost his seat when the party was reduced to two MKs.Kadima Central Elections Committee Post-Knesset career In 2014, Plesner was appointed President of the Israel Democracy Institute, replacing Dr. Arye Carmon upon his retirement. Plesner Committee In 2012, Plesner chaired the Keshev committee, though widely known as the Plesner Committee, for revision in Haredi conscripting policy for the replacement of the Tal Law which was set to lapse on 1 August 2012. The committee was dissolved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu due to disagreements between coalition parties, yet Plesner publicized the recommendations which included aggressive draft goals, as well as criminal charges, fines, or loss of benefits for draft dodgers under the plan.

She has written books that comprise the Tailorstown series. Early life McKenna grew up in Draperstown, Northern Ireland. She attended the Belfast College of Art where she obtained an honours degree in Fine Art and studied postgraduate English at the University of Ulster. In 1986, she left Northern Ireland and spent a decade teaching abroad. Since then she has lived and worked in Spain, Turkey, Italy, Ecuador and Mexico. McKenna is the seventh of nine children brought up on the farm in the townland of Forgetown. Her love of literature began in the early 1970s when her English teacher gave her a copy of Seamus Heaney's Door into the Dark. She asserts that his poetry \\"opened a door in the fearful me and I took refuge in the wonder of his prose. When I met him on those pages at that tender age I simply knew that one day in the far future I would be a writer.\\" In 2003, she started work on her memoir, My Mother Wore A Yellow Dress. To date she has published seven books, three non-fiction titles and four novels. Publications My Mother Wore A Yellow Dress (2004 Neil Wilson Publishing, Glasgow, Scotland) charts her struggle to make sense of the hidebound Catholicism of her childhood, and how art and poetry freed her to follow a more spiritual path. The memoir contains a chapter detailing her experience of the paranormal when, at age eleven, she and her family were subjected to prolonged poltergeist activity, which required a visit by an exorcist. She would later draw on this episode when writing her next work of non-fiction. The Dark Sacrament (2006 Gill & Macmillan, Dublin) co-authored with her husband, David M. Kiely, contains ten contemporary cases of exorcism in Ireland. A special American edition was published in October 2007 by HarperOne, San Francisco. It contains additional material. Ireland's Haunted Women (2010 Poolbeg Press, Dublin) is a collection of true-life ghost stories set in the Ireland of the present day. The cases range from the bizarre to the utterly chilling as Christina faithfully records the testimony of ten women visited by the paranormal. In contrast to other collections in the genre, all the cases are told here for the first time. The Misremembered Man her first novel, is set in rural Northern Ireland in 1974. It's a tragi-comic work, which charts the progress of a lonely farmer in his attempts to find a wife. All the while he is pursued by dark ghosts from a less-than-happy childhood, when he suffered at the hands of an order of nuns who ran an orphanage in the city of Derry. Since 2011 The Misremembered Man has sold over half a million copies, has garnered more reviews on Amazon than any other book by an Irish author, held the Number One slot in Literary Fiction on Amazon.com during the Spring of 2013. It has been translated into German, Spanish and Norwegian, with Russian, Lithuanian and Korean translations in the pipeline. Contrary to press reports, the film rights to this book have not been sold. Her second novel, The Disenchanted Widow is again set in Tailorstown, the same fictional village as The Misremembered Man. It was published on 27 August 2013 by Lake Union Publishing. To date it has sold over 150,000 copies. The third novel in the series, The Godforsaken Daughter, was published on 17 March 2015, by Lake Union Publishing and became a bestseller in the US, UK and Australia. McKenna's fourth novel, The Spinster Wife, was published on 12 October 2017 by Lake Union Publishing. It is a psychological thriller set in Northern Ireland. McKenna's first novel, The Misremembered Man, was rejected by a succession of publishers in Ireland and the UK so she attempted to have it published in the USA. In 2009 the hardback version was published by The Toby Press in Connecticut. The publishing house ceased trading in 2010, however the novel's fate was saved by Amazon Encore, who published the paperback version in May 2011. McKenna has also been involved in a theatre version of The Misremembered Man in 2013.https://www.independent.ie/regionals/argus/news/aisteoiri-theatre-group- prepares-for-stage-debut-29787987.html  References External links * Christina McKenna website Category:Women novelists from Northern Ireland Category:People from County Londonderry Category:Living people Category:Alumni of Ulster University Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women dramatists and playwrights from Northern Ireland Category:20th- century British women writers Category:21st-century British women writers Category:21st-century novelists from Northern Ireland ","title":"Christina McKenna"},{"id":"15092113","text":"Vranƒçiƒá is a Croatian surname, and may refer to: *Antun Vranƒçiƒá (1504‚Äì1573), Croatian cardinal, writer and diplomat *Damir Vranƒçiƒá (born 1985), Bosnian- Herzegovinian footballer *Faust Vranƒçiƒá (1551‚Äì1617), Croatian scientist and inventor *Mario Vranƒçiƒá (born 1989), Bosnian-Herzegovinian and German footballer *Vjekoslav Vranƒçiƒá (1904‚Äì1990), Croatian politician ","title":"Vranƒçiƒá"},{"id":"15092117","text":"Yuke may refer to: * Yukhoe, a variety of hoe (raw dishes in Korean cuisine) * A slang word for Euclid Trucks, and more broadly an articulated or off-road Dump truck, also spelled \\"Euc\\" * Yukes, a race in the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles universe ","title":"Yuke"},{"id":"15092128","title":"Live Until I Die"},{"id":"15092134","text":"Dicentra nevadensis, the Sierra bleeding heart or Tulare County bleeding heart, is a perennial plant endemic to gravelly outcroppings in the Sierra Nevada peaks of Tulare and Fresno Counties in California.

This is the 13th film starring Oland as Chan; it was directed by H. Bruce Humberstone for 20th Century-Fox in 1936. Oland and Demarest also appeared in The Jazz Singer (1927).  Plot  Charlie Chan (Warner Oland) gets to watch a performance that's to die for. For seven years, opera star Gravelle (Boris Karloff) has been locked in an insane asylum, his identity a mystery ‚Äì even to himself. But when his memory unexpectedly returns, he begins to recall that his wife and her lover tried to murder him ‚Äì and now he's determined to make them face the music. Gravelle escapes from the asylum and makes his way to the San Marco opera house and begins hiding out in the various rooms and passageways. Soon, members of the opera company are being murdered one by one. Chan soon investigates the killings and despite the presence of Gravelle, there are other suspects who may be the real killer. They suspects, excluding Gravelle, include Lilli Rochelle, the opera company's prima donna who has been having a secret affair with Enrico Barelli, the baritone; Mr. Whitely, Madame Rochelle's husband who has warned Barelli to stay away from his wife; Anita Barelli, the opera company's number two soprano who has learned of her husband's affair with Lilli Rochelle; and Phil Childers, the fianc√©e of Lilli's unacknowledged daughter who has been refused permission to marry the daughter. Clues found by Chan to apprehend the killer include a torn newspaper, a charred note, a heel mark on a newspaper picture, and a bloodstained belt. Among the questions asked are who has been threatening Lilli Rochelle's life, the mystery man in Barelli's dressing room before he is murdered, and why does Chan insist that the opera be performed twice in one evening?

The 1998 Statutory Instrument listed 166 such schools.

Under the Tripartite System of secondary education in England between the 1940s and 1960s, approximately a quarter of children were selected by the eleven plus exam for entry to grammar schools, either \\"maintained\\" grammar schools fully funded by the state or direct grant grammar schools. Most of the maintained grammar schools were closed or converted to comprehensive schools in the 1960s and 1970s, though a few local authorities resisted this move and retained a selective system.

Maldives and is the largest natural island in Huvadhu Atoll. Gan Island was formerly inhabited, but its inhabitants moved to neighboring islands after a severe epidemic at the end of the 18th century. Before that point, there is evidence of continuous human habitation since very ancient times. There are still large cultivated fields of yams, manioc and coconut trees on this island, which are used by neighboring islanders from Gaddu. The origin of the word \\"Gan\\" is in the Sanskrit word \\"Grama\\", meaning \\"village\\". This island should not be confused with other Maldive islands called \\"Gan\\" in Addu Atoll and Haddummati Atoll. Archaeology There are several ancient Buddhist ruins in this island, including one of the largest stupas in the Maldives: * A large ruin called ‚ÄúGamu Haviththa‚Äù located at the centre of the island is 73 m in circumference and 18 m in height. Local tradition says it was a Buddhist place of worship. * Another mound 55 m in circumference and 1.5 m in height is situated on the western shore of the island. * Another mound with a circumference of 15 m and a height of 1 m is on the northwestern shore of the island. * Another mound with a circumference of 58 m and a height of 9 m is on the southeastern shore of the island. * On the northwest of the centre of the island is a mound with a circumference of 42 m and a height of 6 m. *There is another mound near the latter with a circumference of 37 m and a height of 3 m. Thor Heyerdahl visited this island and investigated one of the ruined stupas there in the 1980s accompanied by Mohamed Lutfi. This included the foundation of the perimeter of the vihara or temple compound. However, most ruins have not yet been well researched. References *Hasan A. Maniku. The Islands of Maldives. Novelty.

Its postcode is 6258. History After the Government Trading Concerns Act 1912 was passed in December of that year, several State-operated businesses were established. One of these was State Saw Mills, which commenced with purchasing the South-West Timber Hewers' Co- operative for ¬£80,000. Construction on the State's Number 1 sawmill, later called Deanmill, began in 1913, as did construction of the Number 2 and 3 mills at Big Brook, later called Pemberton. The mills cost an estimated ¬£138,000, and were to provide timber railway sleepers for the Trans-Australian Railway. Construction of the mills was delayed by heavy rainfall, and the railway sleepers were delivered late. Other problems included shipping disputes and the Commonwealth government's price for sleepers. State Saw Mills created a township surrounding the Number 1 mill, called Deanmill after a construction engineer named A. Dean. They followed accepted practice at the time of placing a timber mill in a valley with accommodation and other facilities close by. Deanmill Primary School was built in 1914 by the Public Works Department in association with State Saw Mills. The school initially consisted of a single classroom, administration building and shed, all constructed out of timber. Today Deanmill currently consists of the sawmill, mill houses, the Deanmill Workers' Club, the Deanmill Football Oval and part of the Deanmill Tramway and Heritage Trail. Premier Geoff Gallop visited Deanmill in December 2002 when the State government was compiling its Forest Management Plan, to start in 2004. The Government entered into negotiations with Sotico to provide a guaranteed volume of jarrah sawlogs over 10 years, to maintain the timber industry in the area. Sotico was a subsidiary of Wesfarmers, which sold the company in 2004. Several assessments have been made regarding the environmental impact of the sawmill and associated activities. A 2004 assessment by Wesfarmers showed arsenic contamination in and surrounding a drainage channel to Lefroy Brook.

Mitchell began his senior career at Scottish Premier League club Falkirk who also loaned him to Ayr United. He then had a season in England with Bradford City before joining Queen of the South in 2012. In his first season at Queens he won the Scottish Challenge Cup and Scottish Football League Second Division. At the end of that season he was named in the division's PFA Scotland Team of the Year. Mitchell had a brief spell at Clyde in 2015‚Äì16. Complications from spinal surgery ended his professional career at Queen of the South, and he left Clyde to establish a new career. Mitchell suffered depression due to his change of career and took his own life at a level crossing at the age of 27.  Football career =Falkirk= Stirling born Mitchell was in the youth system at Livingston then Falkirk. At Falkirk he graduated to the first team. In a pre-season game in 2007 he scored the winning goal against Dutch team Ajax. He made his competitive debut on 22 December 2007 as an added-time substitute in a 3‚Äì0 Scottish Premier League victory at Motherwell. He finished his first season with five appearances the last three of which were starts. On 21 November 2009 he scored his only competitive goal for the Bairns. This 20-yard free kick was in a 2‚Äì0 home win against Hamilton Academical for a first league win of the season. Mitchell moved to Ayr United on loan on 22 January 2010 for the rest of the season. He made ten appearances for the Honest Men in the Scottish Football League First Division. He scored the opening goal of a 1‚Äì1 draw at Raith Rovers on 27 March again from another free kick but from 30 yards. In his time at Falkirk he won seven caps for the Scotland national under-21 football team. The first was on 20 May 2008 in a 4‚Äì1 friendly loss to Norway at Rugby Park in Kilmarnock. =Bradford City= Mitchell signed for Bradford City on 1 July 2011 on a one-year deal along with Falkirk teammate Mark Stewart. He made his debut against Aldershot Town at Valley Parade on 6 August. He played the full 90 minutes in this 1‚Äì2 loss on the opening day of the Football League Two season. On 27 August Mitchell provided three assists during a 4‚Äì2 home win against Barnet. On 8 November he scored the winning spot-kick as the Bantams defeated Yorkshire neighbours Sheffield United 6‚Äì5 in a penalty shootout. This was in the quarter-finals of the Football League Trophy. On 19 November Mitchell scored his first goal for the club in a home game Yorkshire neighbours Rotherham United. Despite Mitchell's headed equaliser his side lost 2‚Äì3. On 28 April 2012 Bradford announced that he would leave the club with his contract ended by mutual consent. Michael Flynn and Craig Fagan were also included in the announcement.\\"Flynn and Mitchell leave City - Fagan on his way\\" Bradford City F.C. 28 April 2012. Retrieved 28 April 2012. =Queen of the South= On 26 July 2012 Mitchell returned to Scotland initially on a one-year contract. He signed for newly relegated Scottish Football League Second Division team Queen of the South. He scored nine minutes into his debut for the Doonhamers. This goal on 4 August opened a 5‚Äì2 win over Alloa Athletic in the first round of the Scottish League Cup. On 7 April 2013 Mitchell played in the Scottish Challenge Cup final at the Almondvale Stadium in Livingston. He played the full 120 minutes of the 1‚Äì1 draw against Partick Thistle. Mitchell scored with his side's penultimate kick in a penalty shootout they won 6‚Äì5. In his first season in Dumfries he played in 33 league games of a title winning campaign. He scored twice in that campaign ‚Äì both against Stenhousemuir. QoS had six players including Mitchell named in the division's PFA Scotland Team of the Year. Next season back in the second tier Queens finished fourth making the play offs. Injury disrupted Mitchell's third and final season at Palmerston Park. =Clyde= On 11 May 2015 Mitchell agreed to join Clyde of Scottish League Two on a one-year deal. The 4‚Äì2 win over Elgin City at the Broadwood Stadium on 14 November 2015 was Mitchell's only career dismissal. He left Clyde in February 2016 in order to focus on a new job. Death Complications from surgery for spinal injury caused Mitchell to go from playing professionally for Queen of the South to part-time for Clyde while working in a factory. He eventually left the sport to train as a salesman for his uncle's company, but during his training he confessed that he was depressed and his family took him to see a psychologist; he was placed on medication but stopped taking it due to side effects. On 7 May 2016, while his partner Louise Rooney was in London, Mitchell went to a level crossing in Cornton near his home in Stirling and telephoned her to say that he was intending to kill himself. The call was still live when he was fatally struck by the train. =Reaction= On 10 May, Clyde paid tribute to Mitchell in their play-off game against Queen's Park. Falkirk did the same against Hibernian four days later. Clyde, Falkirk, Queen of the South and Bradford joined with Mitchell's family to make a charitable foundation in his name, to help former professionals make the transition into new jobs.

The series, hosted by Hazel Scott, ran during the summer of 1950, and is most notable for being one of the first U.S. network television series to be hosted by any person of African descent.Brooks, Tim & Marsh, Earle (1964). The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows (3rd ed.). New York: Ballantine. .McNeil, Alex. Total Television. Fourth edition. New York: Penguin Books. . Broadcast history The Hazel Scott Show was a 15-minute-long musical program hosted by pianist and singer Hazel Scott, who would perform show tunes and other numbers live on the show. Scott was no stranger to performing before she began appearing on the program: she had appeared in nightclubs, on radio and television programs, on Broadway, and in five feature films. The program first aired on July 3, 1950. The show was produced and distributed by the DuMont network, and aired Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 7:45 pm to 8 pm ET on most DuMont affiliates. The Joan Edwards Show was in the same time slot on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Trinidad-born Hazel Scott was described as a \\"novelty on the entertainment scene\\",Bogle, Donald (2001). Primetime Blues: African Americans on Network Television. Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 520 p. Excerpt and the series was well received by critics. Variety wrote: \\"Hazel Scott has a neat little show in this modest package. [The] most engaging element [...] is the Scott personality, which is dignified, yet relaxed, and versatile.\\" Despite critical acclaim and decent Hooper Ratings, the series was cancelled after just a few months. On June 22, 1950, Scott's name had appeared in Red Channels, an anti-Communist publication which named supposed Communist sympathizers. Although Scott appeared voluntarily before the House Un-American Activities Committee on September 22 and vehemently denied the charges, The Hazel Scott Show found itself without a sponsor. The DuMont network cancelled the series just one week later, as her being listed in Red Channels meant the series would be very unlikely to get a sponsor, and DuMont likely could not afford a sustained program in the time-slot. The final network telecast was on September 29, 1950. The network replaced the series with The Susan Raye Show which only lasted from October 2 until November 20.

As a player, he stood tall, weighed , batted left-handed and threw right-handed. Three-sport high school star Hriniak was a three-sport star at Natick High School where he was a first-team All-State selection in all three sports: as quarterback in football, center in hockey, and shortstop in baseball. He was also voted the outstanding hockey player in eastern Massachusetts and some speculated that he could have pursued a career in professional hockey. Instead, he chose baseball and signed a $75,000 bonus contract with the Milwaukee Braves in 1961. Professional baseball playing career Initially a shortstop in the pros, Hriniak batted over .300 in each of his first two professional seasons, but in 1964, while playing for the Austin Senators in the Double-A Texas League, he was seriously injured in a car accident that took the life of a teammate (pitcher Jerry Hummitzsch)The Associated Press, May 23, 1964 and was on the disabled list for nearly three months. It would take Hriniak almost four seasons to regain his batting stroke. By then, 1968, he had become a catcher and utilityman, and was no longer a top prospect. But during that season, with the Shreveport Braves of the Texas League, Hriniak was managed by Charley Lau, who soon would become the most celebrated batting instructor in Major League Baseball of the 1970s. Hriniak hit .313 and was promoted to the MLB Braves that September; more important, he adopted Lau's theories about hitting and would use them as the basis for his instruction after his playing career had ended. He also became Lau's close friend.Yankee Magazine, \\"Hit Man of Fenway Park\\", July/August 1987 Hriniak would play only those few weeks in 1968 plus the 1969 season at the Major League level, for the Braves (by then based in Atlanta) and the San Diego Padres. He appeared in 47 games, batted 99 times, and hit .253 with no home runs, no extra base hits, and four runs batted in. His 25 singles is the post-1900 record for all non-pitchers with no extra base hits. By 1972, he had become a minor league manager in the Montreal Expos organization. Becoming a batting coach At age 30, Hriniak became a Major League coach for the first time, coaching first base for Gene Mauch's Expos in 1974‚Äì75. After Mauch's firing, Hriniak was reassigned to the minor leagues by Montreal in 1976, then was hired as bullpen coach by the Boston Red Sox for the 1977 season. He earned a reputation as a tireless worker, especially as a batting practice pitcher. He threw so many innings of \\"BP\\", he damaged his right shoulder permanently. Although the Red Sox had no formal batting coach until Johnny Pesky's appointment to that job in 1980, some Boston players began approaching Hriniak about his theories on hitting, and he began to work with them before and after games. By the early 1980s, future Baseball Hall of Fame members Carl Yastrzemski and Wade Boggs, as well as All-Stars Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman, were Hriniak disciples. With Pesky's retirement after the 1984 season, Hriniak was promoted to Red Sox batting coach. He concurrently served as first-base coach for the 1986‚Äì87 seasons. With the Red Sox: Differing philosophies Hriniak's batting theories had many adherents among Red Sox players, but he also had detractors. Ted Williams, the Hall of Fame hitter and all-time Boston great, was outspoken in his criticism of Hriniak's methods. Williams and his followers felt that Hriniak robbed his hitters of extra-base power by teaching them to hit the ball up the middle, \\"swing down on the ball\\", or to take the upper hand off the bat at the end of their swing‚Äîwhich may have been oversimplifications of Hriniak's philosophies. \\"I don't have a problem with Ted Williams\\", Hriniak told Yankee Magazine in 1986. \\"He teaches his way, and I teach mine. I don't teach a level swing, a downward swing, or an uppercut swing. Hitters are all different, so I teach all three ... You don't have to hit my way, you don't have to hit his way. Just make up your minds. Don't keep changing lanes. You can't hit when you're confused.\\" White Sox coach Finally, after 12 years with Boston, four as the team's official batting coach, Hriniak moved to the Chicago White Sox in 1989 as one of the highest- paid coaches in baseball. (Lau was serving as the White Sox' batting coach in 1984 when he died from colorectal cancer at age 50. Hriniak wore Lau's old No. 6 uniform in tribute during his Chicago tenure.) Hriniak coached White Sox hitters for seven years, through 1995, before opening his own hitting school and becoming a private batting instructor. Former White Sox slugger Frank Thomas was one of his most loyal adherents. When basketball great Michael Jordan surprised the sports world in 1994 by signing a minor league baseball contract with the White Sox, Hriniak was brought in to help him with his batting technique. Jordan's baseball career was a brief one, batting only .202 for the Birmingham Barons, the White Sox' Double-A affiliate. In 1989, Hriniak authored A Hitting Clinic: The Walt Hriniak Way, which outlined his theories of batting and included participation from Boggs, Evans and Gedman. Awards In June 2010, Hriniak was elected as a charter member of the Natick High School Athletic Hall of Fame in recognition of his many sports achievements while still in high school.Natick Athletic Hall of Famed website In 2004, he was also elected to his high school's Wall of Achievement which honors alumni for their exceptional achievements and contributions to society.Natick Public Schools website ReferencesSources * Allen, Mel, \\"Hit Man of Fenway Park\\", Yankee Magazine, September 1986. * Balzer, Howard, ed., The Baseball Register, 1980 edition.

Most motorists going from Cape Town prefer to use the N1 to Winburg, the N5 to Harrismith & the N3 from here onwards to reach Durban rather than passing through the South Coast, as this route is safer & less complicated. Route The N5 begins in Winburg, at an interchange with the N1 National Route north-west of the town centre. It is initially co-signed with the R708 Route eastwards. After 9 kilometres, the R708 becomes its own road south-east towards Marquard, leaving the N5 as the easterly road. From the R708 split east of Winburg, the N5 heads east for 54 kilometres to the town of Senekal.

It is located near the Beirut Marina and consists of a high-rise apartment building, Marina Tower, and two mid-rise apartment buildings, Marina Court and Marina Garden. Designed by the renowned firm of architects Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the Marina Towers project is built on over 7,000 square metres of land with the main tower reaching a height of 150 metres, making it the second tallest building in Lebanon. The Marina Towers project is on the Mediterranean Sea. The project consists of three distinct elements, the Marina Tower, the Marina Garden, and the Marina Court; covering over 2000 square metres of land.  The Tower  The orientation of the Marina Tower is set on the radial axis of the harbor, emphasizing its vital link with the Beirut Western Marina. A crescent shape has been used in the design of the structure to incorporate the naturally rounded forms of waterfront architecture and provide each of the apartments with dramatic panoramas to the sea, the mountains, the Beirut Central District Park and the Marina. The contemplative, clean-lined architecture consists of 26 floors that stretch 150m above sea level. The entire structure uses stone and glass with a combination of aluminum curtain walls and clear double-glazing that extends all the way to the top. Residents with boats can use a nearby floating slip that gives access to the sea.  The Garden  Directly adjacent to the Marina Tower is the Marina Garden, an area offering the choice of smaller, units that are surrounded by over 3,000 square metres of gardens.

The post was attacked and destroyed by Tlingits in 1805. It consisted of 7 buildings inside a stockade, and 5 buildings outside. The buildings were burnt in 1805, and the site was never again occupied. The events at New Russia represent a pivotal moment in Russian-Tlingit relations. As an archaeological site, it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1978. and Description and history The site of New Russia is located outside the city of Yakutat on the Phipps Peninsula, a swampy spit of land which forms the southeastern edge of Yakutat Bay. The site is on the south-facing shoreline of the peninsula, wedged between the Pacific Ocean and a group of saltwater lakes called the Ankau Saltchucks. The site is now densely forested, with little visible evidence of human occupation, beyond a single log wall section seen during a state archaeological survey in 1971. The site's subsurface artifacts include a charcoal layer, clear evidence of significant fire occurring at the site, and it has long been reported locally as a source of other types of artifacts, including cannonballs and iron scraps. New Russia was established in 1796 by the Russian-American Company as one of a series of outposts and settlements that extended as far south as Old Sitka (called Redoubt St. Archangel Michael by the Russians). The Yakutat site was contemplated as a possible site for the capital of Russian America. The land was purchased from the local Tlingit people by Alexander Baranov in 1794, with settlement planned for the following year. The 1795 settlement attempt was called off due to the hostility of the Tlingits to a hunting party sent to the area in advance of the settlers.Grinev, p. 106 A settlement group of 192 Russians were finally landed in June 1796; that year they built two large log buildings, a palisade, and a blockhouse. By 1805 the settlement had grown to include seven buildings within the palisade, and five outside, and there was a small shipyard which had built two boats. The settlers continued to be viewed with hostility by the Tlingits, who made occasional attacks on hunting parties. In 1802 the Tlingits launched a major attack on Redoubt St. Archangel Michael, destroying that settlement. Alexander Baranov organized a response to this attack, and used the New Russia site as a launching point for the 1804 operation which resulted in the founding of present-day Sitka. In 1805 the Tlingit attacked the New Russia settlement. It was burned to the ground, and all of its occupants except for a few women and children were slaughtered. The site was never reoccupied. After the attack, the Tlingit successfully prevented the Russians from penetrating into Yakutat Bay, and the area did not receive significant attention. Visiting American traders in the 1870s noted that the site's cellar holes had trees in diameter growing out of them. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978.

It runs roughly from north to south, connecting the N1 with the N2. Route=Eastern Cape= The N6 begins in the City of East London in the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality of the Eastern Cape Province, next to the Nahoon River, at an interchange with the N2 Highway. South of the highway, it is the R72 Road. It begins by going northwest for 31 Kilometres to the town of Macleantown, where it leaves the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality. It continues northwest for another 21 Kilometres to meet the R63 Road at an intersection near Kei Road. It continues northwest for 19 kilometers to the town of Stutterheim. It proceeds northwest for another 47 kilometers to the town of Cathcart. It proceeds north-north-west for 54 kilometres, crossing the Black Kei River, to reach Queenstown (town renamed Komani in February 2016). 14 kilometers before Komani, the R61 meets the N6 and they are one road into the town of Komani. In the Stuttaford suburb of Komani, the R61 becomes its own road westwards at the junction with the R67. The N6 continues northwards for 162 kilometres, bypassing Sterkstroom, passing through Jamestown, to the town of Aliwal North, where it meets the R58. At the junction with Barkly Street in Aliwal North, the N6 makes a left turn and proceeds to cross the Orange River into the Free State as the General Hertzog Bridge. =Free State= From the Orange River crossing at Aliwal North, the N6 goes north-north-east for 34 kilometres to the town of Rouxville, where it meets the R26. It turns to the north-west and continues for 37 kilometres, crossing the Caledon River, to the town of Smithfield, where the R701 joins it in the southern suburbs before they split in the northern suburbs. From Smithfield, the N6 continues north-north-west for 70 kilometres to the town of Reddersburg, where it is joined by the R717 from Edenburg in the southern suburbs before they split in the central area. From Reddersburg, the N6 makes a direct line for Bloemfontein, going northwards for 49 kilometres to reach a four-way junction south-west of the Bloemfontein suburb of Mangaung (which is also the name of the Metropolitan Municipality in which the city is located). As the road northwards from this junction is the M30 Metropolitan Route towards the Mangaung suburb and Bloemfontein Central, the N6 becomes the road westwards and proceeds to end at the next junction, which is an interchange with the N1 Highway (Bloemfontein Western Bypass). History Prior to 1970, the N6 began from King William's Town in the Buffalo City Metropolitan Municipality and proceeded through Stutterheim. Today, the road from King William's Town to Stutterheim is designated as the R346 Road. Also, the N6 used to end at its current junction with the R717 south of the Reddersburg Town Centre, as the R717 from Edenburg to Reddersburg, together with the N6 from Reddersburg to Bloemfontein, formed part of the N1 National Route.Anonymous.

Credit theories of money, also called debt theories of money, are monetary economic theories concerning the relationship between credit and money. Proponents of these theories, such as Alfred Mitchell-Innes, sometimes emphasize that money and credit/debt are the same thing, seen from different points of view.As Innes mentions in What is money? (1913), whenever he uses the word credit or debt, \\"the thing spoken of is precisely the same in both cases, the one or the other word being used according as the situation is being looked at from the point of view of the creditor or of the debtor.\\" Proponents assert that the essential nature of money is credit (debt), at least in eras where money is not backed by a commodity such as gold. Two common strands of thought within these theories are the idea that money originated as a unit of account for debt, and the position that money creation involves the simultaneous creation of debt. Some proponents of credit theories of money argue that money is best understood as debt even in systems often understood as using commodity money. Others hold that money equates to credit only in a system based on fiat money, where they argue that all forms of money including cash can be considered as forms of credit money. The first formal credit theory of money arose in the 19th century. Anthropologist David Graeber has argued that for most of human history, money has been widely understood to represent debt, though he concedes that even prior to the modern era, there have been several periods where rival theories like metallism have held sway. Scholarship According to Joseph Schumpeter, the first known advocate of a credit theory of money was Plato. Schumpeter describes metallism as the other of \\"two fundamental theories of money\\", saying the first known advocate of metallism was Aristotle.Chpt 1 Graeco-Roman Economics , 'History of Economic Analysis, Joseph Schumpeter , (1954) The earliest modern thinker to formulate a credit theory of money was Henry Dunning Macleod (1821-1902), with his work in the 19th century, most especially with his The Theory of Credit (1889). Macleod's work was expanded on by Alfred Mitchell-Innes in his papers What is Money? (1913) and The Credit Theory of Money (1914),Originally published in The Banking Law Journal, since reprinted in books such as Wray (2004) and made available online by the CES where he argued against the then conventional view of money arising as a means to improve the practice of barter. In this alternative view, commerce and taxation created obligations between parties which were forms of credit and debt. Devices such as tally sticks were used to record these obligations and these then became negotiable instruments which could function as money. As Innes puts it in his 1914 article: Innes goes on to note that a major problem in getting the public to understand the extent to which monetary systems are debt based is the challenge in persuading them that \\"things are not the way they seem\\". Since the late 20th century, Innes' credit theory of money has been integrated into Modern Monetary Theory. The theory also combines elements of chartalism, noting that high powered money is functionally an IOU from the state, and therefore, \\"all 'state money' is also 'credit money'\\". The state ensures there is demand for its IOUs by accepting them as payment for taxes, fees, fines, tithes, and tribute.√âric Tymoigne and L. Randall Wray, \\"Modern Money Theory 101: A Reply to Critics,\\" Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, Working Paper No. 778 (November 2013). In his 2011 book Debt: The First 5000 Years, the anthropologist David Graeber asserted that the best available evidence suggests the original monetary systems were debt based, and that most subsequent systems have been too. Exceptions where the relationship between money and debt was less clear occurred during periods where money has been backed by bullion, as happens with a gold standard. Graeber echoes earlier theorists such as Innes by saying that during these eras population perception was that money derived its value from the precious metals of which the coins were made,This is the classic Metallist view. but that even in these periods money is more accurately understood as debt. Graeber states that the three main functions of money are to act as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; and a store of value. Graeber writes that since Adam Smith's time, economists have tended to emphasise money as a medium of exchange.Polanyi goes as far as to say Ricardo \\"indoctrinated\\" economists into viewing money just as a medium of exchange - see chapter 16 of The Great Transformation. For Graeber, when money first appeared its primary purpose was to act as a unit of account, to denominate debt. He writes that coins were originally created as tokens which represented a unit of account rather than being an amount of precious metal which could be bartered. Economics commentator Philip Coggan holds that the world's current monetary system became debt-based after the Nixon Shock, in which President Nixon suspended the link between money and gold in 1971. He writes that \\"Modern money is debt and debt is money\\". Since the 1971 Nixon Shock, debt creation and the creation of money increasingly took place at once. This simultaneous creation of money and debt occurs as a feature of fractional reserve banking. After a commercial bank approves a loan, it is able to create the corresponding amount of money, which is then acquired by the borrower along with a similar amount of debt.The new debt will generally soon exceed the newly created money due to added interest. Coggan goes on to say that debtors often prefer debt-based monetary systems such as fiat money over commodity-based systems like the gold standard, because the former tend to allow much higher volumes of money to circulate in the economy, and tend to be more expansive. This makes their debts easier to repay. Coggan refers to William Jennings Bryan's 19th century Cross of Gold speech as one of the first great attempts to weaken the link between gold and money; he says the former US presidential candidate was trying to expand the monetary base in the interests of indebted farmers, who at the time were often being forced into bankruptcy. However Coggan also says that the excessive debt which can be built up under a debt-based monetary system can end up hurting all sections of society, including debtors. In a 2012 paper, economic theorist Perry Mehrling notes that what is commonly regarded as money can often be viewed as debt. He posits a hierarchy of assets with goldIn the Financial sector, gold is often said to be the only financial asset that does not represent someone else's liability to pay. at the top, then currency, then deposits and then securities. The lower down the hierarchy, the easier it is to view the asset as reflecting someone else's debt. A later 2012 paper from Claudio Borio of the BIS made the contrary case that it is loans that give rise to deposits, rather than the other way round.\\"The financial cycle and macroeconomics: What have we learnt?\\", by Claudio Borio, Bank for International Settlements December 2012 In a book published in June 2013, the writer Felix Martin, influenced by Werner (2003, 2005), argued that credit based theories of money are correct, citing many of Werner's sources, such as Macleod: \\"currency ... represents transferable debt, and nothing else\\". Martin writes that it is difficult for people to grasp the nature of money, because money is such a central part of society, and alludes to the Chinese proverb that \\"If you want to know what water is like, don't ask the fish.\\"Richard A. Werner (2003), Princes of the Yen, 2nd edition by Quantum Publishers [www.quantumpublishers.com] Chapter 1 Advocacy The conception that money is essentially equivalent to credit or debt has long been used by those advocating particular reforms of the monetary system, and by commentators calling for various monetary policy responses to events such as the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. A view held in common by most recent advocates, from all shades of political opinion, is that money can be equated with debt in the context of the contemporary monetary system. The view that money is equivalent to debt even in systems based on commodity money tends to be held only by those to the left of the political spectrum. Regardless of any commonality in their understanding of credit theories of money, the actual reforms proposed by advocates of different political orientations are sometimes diametrically opposed. =Advocacy for a return to a gold standard or similar commodity based system.= Former US presidential candidate Ron Paul has spoken out against fiat money, partly on the grounds that it encourages the buildup of debt. Advocates from an Austrian School, right- libertarian perspective often hold that money is equivalent to debt in our current monetary system, but that it need not be in one where money has inherent value, such as a gold standard. They have frequently used this view point to support arguments that it would be best to return to a gold standard, to other forms of commodity money, or at least to a monetary system where money has positive value. Similar views are also occasionally expressed by conservatives. As an example of the latter, former British minister of state The Earl of Caithness made a 1997 speech in The House of Lords where he stated that since the 1971 Nixon Shock, the British money supply had grown by 2145% and personal debt had risen by almost 3000%. He argued that Britain ought to move from its current \\"debt-based monetary system\\" to one based on equity: In the early to mid-1970s, a return to a gold-anchored system was advocated by gold-rich creditor countries including France and Germany. A return has repeatedly been advocated by libertarians, as they tend to see commodity money as far preferable to fiat money. Since the 2008 crisis and the rapid rise in the price of gold that soon followed it, a return to a gold standard has frequently been advocated by goldbugs. =Advocacy against the gold standard= From centristDuring the two centuries leading up to WWII, it was mostly only those who leaned towards the left who opposed the Gold Standard, but this has since become a centrist position. and left-wing perspectives, credit theories of money have been used to oppose the gold standard while it was still in effect, and to reject arguments for its reinstatement. Innes's 1914 paper is an early example of this. =Advocacy for expansionary monetary policy= From a moderate mainstream perspective, Martin Wolf has argued that since most money in our contemporary system is already being dual-created with debt by private banks, there is no reason to oppose monetary creation by central banks in order to support monetary policy such as quantitative easing. In Wolf's view, the argument against Q.E. on the grounds that it creates debt is offset by potential benefits to economic growth and employment, and because the increase in debt would be temporary and easy to reverse. =Advocacy for debt cancellation= Arguments for debt forgiveness have long been made from people of all political orientations; as an example, in 2010 hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry, a strong believer in free markets, argued for a partial cancellation of Greece's debt as part of the solution to the Euro crisis. But generally advocates of debt forgiveness simply point out that debts are too high in relation to the debtors‚Äô ability to repay; they don't make reference to a debt-based theory of money. Exceptions include David Graeber, who from a radical perspective, has used credit theories of money to argue against recent trends to strengthen the enforcement of debt collection, such as greater use of custodial sentences against debtors in the US. He also argued against the over-zealous application of the view that paying one's debts is central to morality, and has proposed the enactment of a biblical style Jubilee where debts will be cancelled for all. = Advocacy for full-reserve banking = The 2008 financial crisis has led to renewed interest in full reserve banking and sovereign money issued by a central bank. Monetary reformers argue that fractional reserve banking and debt-based money lead to unpayable debt, growing inequality, inevitable bankruptcies, and an imperative for perpetual and unsustainable economic growth. = Advocacy for the ongoing establishment of new community banks = Werner argues that the knowledge and understanding of banks as creators and allocators of the money supply should be harnessed to benefit humanity in general and ordinary people in particular - instead of abolishing this power, as the 'monetary reform' movement demands. According to Werner this can be done by establishing hundreds of not-for-profit community banks, modelled on Germany's local co-operative banks, Raiffeisenbanks and Sparkasse savings banks. These banks have been one of the drivers of the striking success for German small firms over the past two centuries in delivering job creation, strong exports and constantly upgraded technology. Werner says that instead of further centralising the power of money creation in the hands of ever fewer people, as monetary reformers and central planners demand, this public privilege should be returned \\"to the people to whom it belongs\\", and this can only be done in a meaningful way with sufficient accountability by copying the traditional German community banks.Richard A. Werner (2018), Shifting from central planning to a decentralised economy, www.professorwerner.org see also Local First Community Interest Company and their movement to establish community banks Relationship with other theories of money Debt theories of money fall into a broader category of work which postulates that monetary creation is endogenous.Simply put, this contrasts with exogenous creation where money is created by events such as new finds of gold occurring outside of a narrowly conceived economy. Historically, debt theories of money have overlapped with chartalism and were opposed to metallism.In the 19th century, and to an extent the early 20th century, metallism enjoyed an almost \\"unchallenged\\" position as the dominant theory of money ‚Äì see for example Chapter 1 of Schumpeter's History of Economic Analysis This largely remains the case today, especially in the forms commonly held by those to the left of the political spectrum.Chartalists will sometimes say money derives it value by virtue of being the legal way to pay ones debt to the State as taxes. Debt theories can be broader in scope ‚Äì Graeber, Innes and others have argued that organic debt based monetary systems that did not involve the state continued to operate well into the 19th century. Conversely, in the forms held by late 20th-century and 21st-century advocates with a conservative libertarian perspective, debt theories of money are often compatible with the quantity theory of money and with metallism, at least when the latter is broadly understood.

Known for his wide range of materials, works are made from paint cans, phone books, metal, cement, wood and, even the skull of a water buffalo. In 1999, Ireland collaborated with sound artist GX Jupitter-Larsen remixing and re-recording tapes from the audio archives of 500 Capp St. The outcome was released as a CD on Vinyl Communications. To accompany Ireland's first solo exhibition in London, Ridinghouse published David Ireland: Sculptures, Paintings, Drawings. This catalogue features a selection of Ireland's works from over four decades. An introduction to the work of this artist, this publication also includes an essay by Kenneth Baker, art critic of the San Francisco Chronicle. One of his most prominent works Angel-Go-Round (1996) is in the permanent collection of di Rosa, Napa.http://napavalleyregister.com/lifestyles/di-rosa-acquires- ireland-s-angel-go-round/article_f96100ce-1276-5586-8fcf-eeffdec8cbc8.html In early 2016, the San Francisco Art Institute organized an exhibition of Ireland's work, in conjunction with the public opening of 500 Capp Street.

Rains' short career spanned the early to the mid-1960s and consisted of 4 LP recordings released on Decca Records and the Vocalion label. These LPs were released during the golden era of Hawaiian and Exotica music and the Tiki culture in the United States. The Gene Rains Group repertoire featured popular Hawaiian and Polynesian Island melodies as well as popular American tunes of the era. Gene Rains was \\"discovered\\" by the enormously popular Hawaiian crooner of the era, Alfred Apaka. At the time, Apaka was the talent director for the Hawaiian Village Hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii. Apaka recruited the Gene Rains Group to perform in the Shell Bar at the Hawaiian Village, which was the hot spot for the Island's top performers, including Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman. It was also Alfred Apaka who introduced Rains to Decca Records. Today, Rains is considered the third man of Exotica, behind Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman. Although he did not achieve the level of renown of Denny or Lyman, Rains' albums nonetheless are textbook examples of the style of Exotica. With the resurgence of the Tiki culture in the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, Gene Rains' albums have become much sought after by collectors of the genre. In July 2014, Real Gone Music released a compilation CD featuring 19 tracks and containing large portion of each of Rain's three LP's. During the production of the CD, Universal music, the holding company for Decca's catalog, stated that the Gene Rains master tapes had been destroyed in a fire years earlier. As a result, the Real Gone Music team called upon Mark Riddle a/k/a Digitiki to supply the cleanest possible LP transfers. Riddle is the host of a popular Exotica-themed podcast \\"Quiet Village Podcast.\\" Even though the compilation was LP sourced, the audio is exceptionally clean.

It opens with a novella of the same name, followed by seven short stories. The novella is a prequel to the entire Mythago Wood cycle. According to the author it was written \\"to fill in the background and back-story to Mythago Wood\\" at the request of a screenwriter who was working on a planned movie version of Mythago Wood.Holdstock, Robert Merlin's Wood, (London: Gollancz, 2009), page 451. The 1991 and 1992 editions of the book contain seven short stories in addition to the novella The Bone Forest., after which the volume takes its name. The additional stories in The Bone Forest bear little relation with either time or events in the Mythago Wood cycle, yet the short stories are largely influenced by the fantasy realm created as part of the Mythago Wood cycle.The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, eds. John Clute and John Grant (New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, 1997), page 475. The Bone Forest has both won and been nominated for fantasy literature awards.

Novella plot summary The Bone Forest with original U.S. cover art by Tom Canty. The main narrative expands the back story of tensions in the Huxley family taking place in time before the events in Mythago Wood. In this novella George Huxley must contend with a Doppelg√§nger mythago of himself, who is physically threatening and interacting with his family in undesirable ways. In particular the relationship between George Huxley and his sons is explored.Newman, Kim St. James Guide to Fantasy Writers, ed. David Pringle (Detroit, MI: St. James Press, 1996), pages 285-286. The story takes place between January 1935 and the late Summer of 1935. The Huxleys reside in Oak Lodge, on the outskirts of Ryhope Wood. One Winter night they are visited by the \\"Snow Woman\\". She is a mythago, but the Huxley boys believe she is a gypsy. The Snow Woman leaves a talisman, a necklet of bone and wood, which Steven keeps. In the Spring, George Huxley and Edward Wynne-Jones undertake explorations in Ryhope wood, become separated and encounter dangerous mythagos spawned by Steven's imagination. In a dramatic encounter taking place at an ancient Horse Shrine, George Huxley physically collides with a mythago stallion; this collision results in the creation of the Gray-Green mythago, an alter ego of George Huxley. When George Huxley returns to Oak Lodge, he discovers the Gray-Green man is writing in his journal, upsetting his children, and having intimate relations with his wife. Both forms agree they must try to recombine, but disagree on the method. This leads to a climactic final scene in which they race to the Horse Shrine (and back in time). The Gray-Green mythago tries to destroy Ash and hang George Huxley, but fails. George relives the collision with the wild stallion, which results in the Gray-Green mythago being banished to the woods and Wynne-Jones reappearing. The story ends back at Oak Lodge with George realizing that many of the intervening events, but not all, seem to have never happened.Langford, David Supernatural Fiction Writers, Second Edition, Volume 1, ed. Richard Bleiler (New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003), pages 446-453. Novella characters=Human characters= ; Christian Huxley : A boy as well, Christian is the more rambunctious older brother of Steven Huxley. ; George Huxley : George is the protagonist of the story and father of Steven and Christian. George is a 45-year-old, tall and lean man who is a scientist in the field of psychology. He has studied with Carl Jung, researched archaeology and obsessed over various myths. Over the course of his studies of Ryhope wood, George produces a scientific journal in six volumes, a personal diary and a detailed map of Ryhope wood. ; Jennifer Huxley : Wife of George and mother of Steven and George. ; Steven Huxley : A young boy who has just celebrated his 8th birthday prior to the events of The Bone Forest. ; Edward Wynne-Jones : A researcher in historical anthropology who teaches at Oxford University. Wynne-Jones is a diminutive and fussy man who smokes a pipe. He is approximately the same age as George Huxley. Together Wynne-Jones and George Huxley study Ryhope Wood extensively in the 1930s. Wynne-Jones makes scientific equipment designed to interact with the paranormal in Ryhope Wood. =Mythagos= Many mythagos appear in The Bone Forest. The major mythagos are listed below in detail. Minor mythagos appearing include the recurring Robin Hood or Merry Man, and Green Jacks or Jack o' the Greens. Non-recurring mythagos include \\"Crow Ghost\\" (a fast, aggressive male with a painted face), three half-man/half-wolf creatures, and a monkey-faced man (perhaps a Cro-Magnon). The Twigling mythago is mentioned in passing, but plays no part in the narrative. ; Ash/The Snow Woman : This powerful woman has copper colored hair and wears white fox furs. She is the composite of an ancient shaman prototype and a character from a child's story housed in Steven's imagination. She possesses deep knowledge of both Ryhope wood and its mystical artifacts. She holds power over untamed horses and can manipulate both time and the seasons within the forest. ; The Four Horse Hunters : These four men herd stallions through the woods. Their faces are painted red, green, yellow, and blue. ; The Gray-Green Man : This mythago is a Gray-Green version of George Huxley; he moves unnaturally fast and is sinister in nature. He is an archetypal representation of the trickster. He exhibits animal litheness and is in much better physical shape than the human George Huxley. ; Urscumug : A male half boar/half human representation of the first hero from earliest myth. The malevolent and ancient Urscumug, a variation on the wodewose, is sought out by George Huxley, but never encountered. Short story plot summaries ; Thorn Thomas, a mason, is the protagonist of this short story. He is compelled to work at night to finish a secret carving on his village's first Christian stone church. The church is being constructed on Dancing Hill, a site of both pagan and Christian religious significance. His project is to carve a semi-animated stone block depicting Thorn, lord of the wood, also known as the Green Man. Completing the project before similar carvings of the twelve apostles are finished will imbue Thorn with power over the church. This story simultaneously explores tension between Christian and pagan and a growing conflict between Thomas‚Äô conscience and the god Thorn. The story was inspired by William Golding's novel The Spire. The story was also included in The Oxford Book of Fantasy, edited by Tom Shippey.Holdstock, Robert Merlin's Wood, (London: Gollancz, 2009), page 454. ; The Shapechanger This story takes place in England, AD 731 at a Saxon village adjacent to the Dancing Hill, which holds the ruins of an ancient shrine (the setting of the previous short story, Thorn.) The two main characters are Wolfhead, a wild shaman, and Inkmarker, an orphaned child of 10, who subsequently escapes from a monastery and joins Wolfhead. Wolfhead is summoned by Gilla, the chief of the nearby village, to help rid the village of a demon whose power emanates from a stone-lined well in the center of the village. A weakened stone god at the ruins of the ancient shrine warns Wolfhead and Inkmarker of this outsider demon Mabathagus, god of the earth, and father of Hecate. Inkmarker undertakes ritualistic coming-of-age tasks, but becomes hopelessly entangled with the demon as he confronts it. ; The Boy who Jumped the Rapids This is the story of Caylen, an adolescent boy and member of a forest community in mainland Europe. Caylen is the son of Caswallon, his village's chieftain. Caylen is considered possessed because he is able to see through two illusions, one a sheer cliff wall known as Wolfback, and the other a river which appears as rapids, but is actually calm and placid. This river marks the geographical boundary of Caswallon's lands. North of the river is a changing landscape with ancient stone buildings and a tall metal totem, both constructions beyond the skill of Caswallon's people. One day a red haired warrior of Nordic origin visits the village. The warrior wears a horn-helmet and long black robes that flow and billow. He bears a child's spear, that of Rianna, a girl of honor among his people who was brutally murdered by a mercenary. While Caylen makes friends with a 9-year-old boy named Fergus and avoids the bullying abuses of another boy Domnorix, both from his village, the warrior builds a small wooden shrine to honor Rianna in a glade, Old Stone Hollow. On Caswallon's orders, Glamach, the village druid, ritualistically abuses Caylen to cleanse him of his evil. Caylen flees the village to avoid this abuse just as five warriors from the north appear to hunt and execute the warrior. As Caylen flees, he is faced with a decision to between saving the warrior's sacred spear or his friend Fergus. ; Time of the Tree This is an episodic short story told from the viewpoint of an anthropomorphic land. Each episode chronicles events taking place on the land's surface, or skin. The episodes along with brief summaries are: **Tundra ‚Äì Describes the retreat of ice cover from the land and migration of animals. **The Birch Accession ‚Äì Describes the growth of forests upon the land's skin and how the lifespan of trees is used to measure time. **The Coming of the Wildwood ‚Äì As the land warms, temperate forests and larger animals begin to take hold. **The Elm Decline ‚Äì Trees are being cleared for the first human settlements; their burning of trees feels like pinpricks on the skin of the land. **The First Totems ‚Äì Humans organize into clans that develop religious icons, boats and engage in tribal warfare. **The Temple Builders ‚Äì A temple of circular stones is built by humans and witnessed by travelers from afar. **Ritual Sacrifice ‚Äì A young woman is sacrificed and sunk to the bottom of a lake, becoming part of the earth. **Journey to the Underworld ‚Äì The spirit of the sacrificed woman, embodied in various elements of the natural world, travels throughout the lands. **Our Lady of the Chromosomes ‚Äì The land passes the secret of fire-hardened flints to humans via the spirit woman. Forsaken, the spirit woman is reborn as a disastrous flood, temporarily wiping out the humans. **Anger of the Gods ‚Äì After a long sleep, the land awakens to find itself covered with an urban landscape. This irritation is scraped away, destroying the civilization. ; Magic Man This short story takes place in the North American plains and explores the magical power of ocher cave painting. The story involves a group of Native American tribal hunters living off bison, deer and reindeer. The main character is One Eye, an elderly village shaman/painter who resides in a shrine-cave which overlooks the village and grasslands beyond. ‚ÄúHe Who Carries a Red Spear‚Äù is the tribal leader whose son frequents One Eye's cave. The tribal leader persistently pressures One Eye to use magical paintings to improve his hunting success, not just those of the overall village. The tribal leader's son has innate cave painting abilities and an interest in bears, one of the few animals that will hunt humans. As tensions mount between One Eye and the tribal leader, the son discovers the power of his own cave paintings. ; Scarrowfell This short story focuses on Ginny, a young girl, and the part she plays in a ritualistic dancing festival.

This involves counterfactual analysis, that is, \\"a comparison between what actually happened and what would have happened in the absence of the intervention.\\"White, H. (2006) Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, World Bank, Washington, D.C., p. 3 Impact evaluations seek to answer cause-and-effect questions. In other words, they look for the changes in outcome that are directly attributable to a program. Impact evaluation helps people answer key questions for evidence- based policy making: what works, what doesn't, where, why and for how much? It has received increasing attention in policy making in recent years in the context of both Western and developing countries. It is an important component of the armory of evaluation tools and approaches and integral to global efforts to improve the effectiveness of aid delivery and public spending more generally in improving living standards. Muaz, Jalil Mohammad (2013), Practical Guidelines for conducting research. Summarising good research practice in line with the DCED Standard Originally more oriented towards evaluation of social sector programs in developing countries, notably conditional cash transfers, impact evaluation is now being increasingly applied in other areas such as the agriculture, energy and transport.  Counterfactual evaluation designs  Counterfactual analysis enables evaluators to attribute cause and effect between interventions and outcomes. The 'counterfactual' measures what would have happened to beneficiaries in the absence of the intervention, and impact is estimated by comparing counterfactual outcomes to those observed under the intervention. The key challenge in impact evaluation is that the counterfactual cannot be directly observed and must be approximated with reference to a comparison group. There are a range of accepted approaches to determining an appropriate comparison group for counterfactual analysis, using either prospective (ex ante) or retrospective (ex post) evaluation design. Prospective evaluations begin during the design phase of the intervention, involving collection of baseline and end-line data from intervention beneficiaries (the 'treatment group') and non-beneficiaries (the 'comparison group'); they may involve selection of individuals or communities into treatment and comparison groups. Retrospective evaluations are usually conducted after the implementation phase and may exploit existing survey data, although the best evaluations will collect data as close to baseline as possible, to ensure comparability of intervention and comparison groups. There are five key principles relating to internal validity (study design) and external validity (generalizability) which rigorous impact evaluations should address: confounding factors, selection bias, spillover effects, contamination, and impact heterogeneity. * Confounding occurs where certain factors, typically relating to socioeconomic status, are correlated with exposure to the intervention and, independent of exposure, are causally related to the outcome of interest. Confounding factors are therefore alternate explanations for an observed (possibly spurious) relationship between intervention and outcome. * Selection bias, a special case of confounding, occurs where intervention participants are non-randomly drawn from the beneficiary population, and the criteria determining selection are correlated with outcomes. Unobserved factors, which are associated with access to or participation in the intervention, and are causally related to the outcome of interest, may lead to a spurious relationship between intervention and outcome if unaccounted for. Self-selection occurs where, for example, more able or organized individuals or communities, who are more likely to have better outcomes of interest, are also more likely to participate in the intervention. Endogenous program selection occurs where individuals or communities are chosen to participate because they are seen to be more likely to benefit from the intervention. Ignoring confounding factors can lead to a problem of omitted variable bias. In the special case of selection bias, the endogeneity of the selection variables can cause simultaneity bias. * Spillover (referred to as contagion in the case of experimental evaluations) occurs when members of the comparison (control) group are affected by the intervention. * Contamination occurs when members of treatment and/or comparison groups have access to another intervention which also affects the outcome of interest. * Impact heterogeneity refers to differences in impact due by beneficiary type and context. High quality impact evaluations will assess the extent to which different groups (e.g., the disadvantaged) benefit from an intervention as well as the potential effect of context on impact. The degree that results are generalizable will determine the applicability of lessons learned for interventions in other contexts. Impact evaluation designs are identified by the type of methods used to generate the counterfactual and can be broadly classified into three categories ‚Äì experimental, quasi- experimental and non-experimental designs ‚Äì that vary in feasibility, cost, involvement during design or after implementation phase of the intervention, and degree of selection bias. White (2006)White, H. (2006) Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, World Bank, Washington, D.C. and Ravallion (2008)Ravallion, M. (2008) Evaluating Anti-Poverty Programs discuss alternate Impact Evaluation approaches. =Experimental design= Under experimental evaluations the treatment and comparison groups are selected randomly and isolated both from the intervention, as well as any interventions which may affect the outcome of interest. These evaluation designs are referred to as randomized control trials (RCTs). In experimental evaluations the comparison group is called a control group. When randomization is implemented over a sufficiently large sample with no contagion by the intervention, the only difference between treatment and control groups on average is that the latter does not receive the intervention. Random sample surveys, in which the sample for the evaluation is chosen randomly, should not be confused with experimental evaluation designs, which require the random assignment of the treatment. The experimental approach is often held up as the 'gold standard' of evaluation. It is the only evaluation design which can conclusively account for selection bias in demonstrating a causal relationship between intervention and outcomes. Randomization and isolation from interventions might not be practicable in the realm of social policy and may be ethically difficult to defend, although there may be opportunities to use natural experiments. Bamberger and White (2007)Bamberger, M. and White, H. (2007) Using Strong Evaluation Designs in Developing Countries: Experience and Challenges, Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation, Volume 4, Number 8, 58-73 highlight some of the limitations to applying RCTs to development interventions. Methodological critiques have been made by Scriven (2008)Scriven (2008) A Summative Evaluation of RCT Methodology: & An Alternative Approach to Causal Research, Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation, Volume 5, Number 9, 11-24 on account of the biases introduced since social interventions cannot be fully blinded, and Deaton (2009) has pointed out that in practice analysis of RCTs falls back on the regression-based approaches they seek to avoid and so are subject to the same potential biases. Other problems include the often heterogeneous and changing contexts of interventions, logistical and practical challenges, difficulties with monitoring service delivery, access to the intervention by the comparison group and changes in selection criteria and/or intervention over time. Thus, it is estimated that RCTs are only applicable to 5 percent of development finance. =Quasi-experimental design= Quasi-experimental approaches can remove bias arising from selection on observables and, where panel data are available, time invariant unobservables. Quasi-experimental methods include matching, differencing, instrumental variables and the pipeline approach; they are usually carried out by multivariate regression analysis. If selection characteristics are known and observed, they can be controlled for to remove the bias. Matching involves comparing program participants with non-participants based on observed selection characteristics. Propensity score matching (PSM) uses a statistical model to calculate the probability of participating on the basis of a set of observable characteristics and matches participants and non-participants with similar probability scores. Regression discontinuity design exploits a decision rule as to who does and does not get the intervention to compare outcomes for those just either side of this cut-off. Difference in differences or double differences, which use data collected at baseline and end-line for intervention and comparison groups, can be used to account for selection bias under the assumption that unobservable factors determining selection are fixed over time (time invariant). Instrumental variables estimation accounts for selection bias by modelling participation using factors ('instruments') that are correlated with selection but not the outcome, thus isolating the aspects of program participation which can be treated as exogenous. The pipeline approach (stepped-wedge design) uses beneficiaries already chosen to participate in a project at a later stage as the comparison group. The assumption is that as they have been selected to receive the intervention in the future they are similar to the treatment group, and therefore comparable in terms of outcome variables of interest. However, in practice, it cannot be guaranteed that treatment and comparison groups are comparable and some method of matching will need to be applied to verify comparability. =Non- experimental design= Non-experimental impact evaluations are so-called because they do not involve a comparison group that does not have access to the intervention. The method used in non-experimental evaluation is to compare intervention groups before and after implementation of the intervention. Intervention interrupted time-series (ITS) evaluations require multiple data points on treated individuals before and after the intervention, while before versus after (or pre-test post-test) designs simply require a single data point before and after. Post-test analyses include data after the intervention from the intervention group only. Non-experimental designs are the weakest evaluation design, because to show a causal relationship between intervention and outcomes convincingly, the evaluation must demonstrate that any likely alternate explanations for the outcomes are irrelevant. However, there remain applications to which this design is relevant, for example, in calculating time-savings from an intervention which improves access to amenities. In addition, there may be cases where non-experimental designs are the only feasible impact evaluation design, such as universally implemented programmes or national policy reforms in which no isolated comparison groups are likely to exist.  Biases in estimating programme effects  Randomized field experiments are the strongest research designs for assessing program impact. This particular research design is said to generally be the design of choice when it is feasible as it allows for a fair and accurate estimate of the program's actual effects (Rossi, Lipsey & Freeman, 2004). With that said, randomized field experiments are not always feasible to carry out and in these situations there are alternative research designs that are at the disposal of an evaluator. The main problem though is that regardless of which design an evaluator chooses, they are prone to a common problem: Regardless of how well thought through or well implemented the design is, each design is subject to yielding biased estimates of the program effects. These biases play the role of exaggerating or diminishing program effects. Not only that, but the direction the bias may take cannot usually be known in advance (Rossi et al., 2004). These biases affect the interest of the stakeholder. Furthermore, it is possible that program participants are disadvantaged if the bias is in such a way that it contributes to making an ineffective or harmful program seem effective. There is also the possibility that a bias can make an effective program seem ineffective or even as far as harmful. This could possibly make the accomplishments of program seem small or even insignificant therefore forcing the personnel and even cause the program's sponsors to reduce or eliminate the funding for the program (Rossi et al., 2004). It is safe to say that if an inadequate design yields bias, the stakeholders who are largely responsible for the funding of the program will be the ones most concerned; the results of the evaluation help the stakeholders decide whether or not to continue funding the program because the final decision lies with the funders and the sponsors. Not only are the stakeholders mostly concerned, but those taking part in the program or those the program is intended to positively affect will be affected by the design chosen and the outcome rendered by that chosen design. Therefore, the evaluator's concern is to minimize the amount of bias in the estimation of program effects (Rossi et al., 2004). Biases are normally visible in two situations: when the measurement of the outcome with program exposure or the estimate of what the outcome would have been without the program exposure is higher or lower than the corresponding \\"true\\" value (p267). Unfortunately, not all forms of bias that may compromise impact assessment are obvious (Rossi et al., 2004). The most common form of impact evaluation design is comparing two groups of individuals or other units, an intervention group that receives the program and a control group that does not. The estimate of program effect is then based on the difference between the groups on a suitable outcome measure (Rossi et al., 2004). The random assignment of individuals to program and control groups allows for making the assumption of continuing equivalence. Group comparisons that have not been formed through randomization are known as non-equivalent comparison designs (Rossi et al., 2004). =Selection bias= When there is an absence of the assumption of equivalence, the difference in outcome between the groups that would have occurred regardless creates a form of bias in the estimate of program effects. This is known as selection bias (Rossi et al., 2004). It creates a threat to the validity of the program effect estimate in any impact assessment using a non-equivalent group comparison design and appears in situations where some process responsible for influences that are not fully known selects which individuals will be in which group instead of the assignment to groups being determined by pure chance (Rossi et al., 2004). This may be because of participant self-selection, or it may be because of program placement (placement bias). Selection bias can occur through natural or deliberate processes that cause a loss of outcome data for members of the intervention and control groups that have already been formed. This is known as attrition and it can come about in two ways (Rossi et al., 2004): targets drop out of the intervention or control group cannot be reached or targets refuse to co-operate in outcome measurement. Differential attrition is assumed when attrition occurs as a result of something either than explicit chance process (Rossi et al., 2004). This means that \\"those individuals that were from the intervention group whose outcome data are missing cannot be assumed to have the same outcome-relevant characteristics as those from the control group whose outcome data are missing\\" (Rossi et al., 2004, p271). However, random assignment designs are not safe from selection bias which is induced by attrition (Rossi et al., 2004). =Other forms of bias= There are other factors that can be responsible for bias in the results of an impact assessment. These generally have to do with events or experiences other than receiving the program that occur during the intervention. These biases include secular trends, interfering events and maturation (Rossi et al., 2004). Secular trends or secular drift Secular trends can be defined as being relatively long-term trends in the community, region or country. These are also termed secular drift and may produce changes that enhance or mask the apparent effects of a (Rossi et al., 2004). For example, when a community's birth rate is declining, a program to reduce fertility may appear effective because of bias stemming from that downward trend (Rossi et al., 2004, p273). Interfering events Interfering events are similar to secular trends; in this case it is the short-term events that can produce changes that may introduce bias into estimates of program effect, such as a power outage disrupting communications or hampering the delivery of food supplements may interfere with a nutrition program (Rossi et al., 2004, p273). Maturation Impact evaluation needs to accommodate the fact that natural maturational and developmental processes can produce considerable change independently of the program. Including these changes in the estimates of program effects would result in bias estimates. An example of this form of bias would be a program to improve preventative health practices among adults may seem ineffective because health generally declines with age (Rossi et al., 2004, p273). \\"Careful maintenance of comparable circumstances for program and control groups between random assignment and outcome measurement should prevent bias from the influence of other differential experiences or events on the groups. If either of these conditions is absent from the design, there is potential for bias in the estimates of program effect\\" (Rossi et al., 2004, p274).  Estimation methods  Estimation methods broadly follow evaluation designs. Different designs require different estimation methods to measure changes in well-being from the counterfactual. In experimental and quasi- experimental evaluation, the estimated impact of the intervention is calculated as the difference in mean outcomes between the treatment group (those receiving the intervention) and the control or comparison group (those who don't). This method is also called randomized control trials (RCT). According to an interview with Jim Rough, former representative of the American Evaluation Association, in the magazine D+C Development and Cooperation, this method does not work for complex, multilayer matters. The single difference estimator compares mean outcomes at end-line and is valid where treatment and control groups have the same outcome values at baseline. The difference-in-difference (or double difference) estimator calculates the difference in the change in the outcome over time for treatment and comparison groups, thus utilizing data collected at baseline for both groups and a second round of data collected at end-line, after implementation of the intervention, which may be years later. Impact Evaluations which have to compare average outcomes in the treatment group, irrespective of beneficiary participation (also referred to as 'compliance' or 'adherence'), to outcomes in the comparison group are referred to as intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Impact Evaluations which compare outcomes among beneficiaries who comply or adhere to the intervention in the treatment group to outcomes in the control group are referred to as treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) analyses. ITT therefore provides a lower-bound estimate of impact, but is arguably of greater policy relevance than TOT in the analysis of voluntary programs.Bloom, H. (2006) The core analytics of randomized experiments for social research. MDRC Working Papers on Research Methodology. MDRC, New York  Debates  While there is agreement on the importance of impact evaluation, and a consensus is emerging around the use of counterfactual evaluation methods, there has also been widespread debate in recent years on both the definition of impact evaluation and the use of appropriate methods (see White 2009 for an overview). = Definitions = The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) defines rigorous impact evaluations as: \\"analyses that measure the net change in outcomes for a particular group of people that can be attributed to a specific program using the best methodology available, feasible and appropriate to the evaluation question that is being investigated and to the specific context\\". According to the World Bank's DIME Initiative, \\"Impact evaluations compare the outcomes of a program against a counterfactual that shows what would have happened to beneficiaries without the program. Unlike other forms of evaluation, they permit the attribution of observed changes in outcomes to the program being evaluated by following experimental and quasi-experimental designs\\".World Bank (n.d.) The Development IMpact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative, Project Document, World Bank, Washington, D.C. Similarly, according to the US Environmental Protection Agency impact evaluation is a form of evaluation that assesses the net effect of a program by comparing program outcomes with an estimate of what would have happened in the absence of a program.US Environmental Protection Agency Program Evaluation Glossary, accessed on January 6, 2008 According to the World Bank's Independent Evaluation Group (IEG), impact evaluation is the systematic identification of the effects positive or negative, intended or not on individual households, institutions, and the environment caused by a given development activity such as a program or project.World Bank Independent Evaluation Group, accessed on January 6, 2008 Impact evaluation has been defined differently over the past few decades. Other interpretations of impact evaluation include: *An evaluation which looks at the impact of an intervention on final welfare outcomes, rather than only at project outputs, or a process evaluation which focuses on implementation; *An evaluation carried out some time (five to ten years) after the intervention has been completed so as to allow time for impact to appear; and *An evaluation considering all interventions within a given sector or geographical area. Other authors make a distinction between \\"impact evaluation\\" and \\"impact assessment.\\" \\"Impact evaluation\\" uses empirical techniques to estimate the effects of interventions and their statistical significance, whereas \\"impact assessment\\" includes a broader set of methods, including structural simulations and other approaches that cannot test for statistical significance. Common definitions of 'impact' used in evaluation generally refer to the totality of longer-term consequences associated with an intervention on quality-of-life outcomes. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Development Assistance Committee (OECD- DAC) defines impact as the \\"positive and negative, primary and secondary long- term effects produced by a development intervention, directly or indirectly, intended or unintended\\".OECD-DAC (2002) Glossary of Key Terms in Evaluation and Results-Based Management Proposed Harmonized Terminology, OECD, Paris A number of international agencies have also adopted this definition of impact. For example, UNICEF defines impact as \\"The longer term results of a program ‚Äì technical, economic, socio-cultural, institutional, environmental or other ‚Äì whether intended or unintended. The intended impact should correspond to the program goal.\\"UNICEF (2004) UNICEF Evaluation Report Standards, Evaluation Office, UNICEF NYHQ, New York Similarly, Evaluationwiki.org defines impact evaluation as an evaluation that looks beyond the immediate results of policies, instruction, or services to identify longer-term as well as unintended program effects. Technically, an evaluation could be conducted to assess 'impact' as defined here without reference to a counterfactual. However, much of the existing literature (e.g. NONIE Guidelines on Impact Evaluation adopts the OECD-DAC definition of impact while referring to the techniques used to attribute impact to an intervention as necessarily based on counterfactual analysis. What is missing from the term 'impact' evaluation is the way 'impact' shows up long-term. For instance, most Monitoring and Evaluation 'logical framework' plans have inputs-outputs-outcomes and... impacts. While the first three appear during the project duration itself, impact takes far longer to take place. For instance, in a 5-year agricultural project, seeds are inputs, farmers trained in using them our outputs, changes in crop yields as a result of the seeds being planted properly in an outcome and families being more sustainably food secure over time is an impact. Such post-project impact evaluations are very rare. They are also called ex-post evaluations or we are coining the term sustained impact evaluations. While hundreds of thousands of documents call for them, rarely do donors have the funding flexibility - or interest - to return to see how sustained, and durable our interventions remained after project close out, after resources were withdrawn. There are many lessons to be learned for design, implementation, M&E; and how to foster country-ownership. = Methodological debates = There is intensive debate in academic circles around the appropriate methodologies for impact evaluation, between proponents of experimental methods on the one hand and proponents of more general methodologies on the other. William Easterly has referred to this as 'The Civil War in Development economics'. Proponents of experimental designs, sometimes referred to as 'randomistas', argue randomization is the only means to ensure unobservable selection bias is accounted for, and that building up the flimsy experimental evidence base should be developed as a matter of priority. In contrast, others argue that randomized assignment is seldom appropriate to development interventions and even when it is, experiments provide us with information on the results of a specific intervention applied to a specific context, and little of external relevance.Bamberger, M. and White, H. (2007) Using Strong Evaluation Designs in Developing Countries: Experience and Challenges, Journal of MultiDisciplinary Evaluation, Volume 4, Number 8, 58-73 There has been criticism from evaluation bodies and others that some donors and academics over-emphasize favoured methods for impact evaluation,http://www.europeanevaluation.org/download/?noGzip=1&id;=1969403 EES Statement on the importance of a methodologically diverse approach to impact evaluation and that this may in fact hinder learning and accountability.http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/odi- publications/opinions/127-impact-evaluation.pdf The 'gold standard' is not a silver bullet for evaluation In addition, there has been a debate around the appropriate role for qualitative methods within impact evaluations. = Theory-based impact evaluation = While knowledge of effectiveness is vital, it is also important to understand the reasons for effectiveness and the circumstances under which results are likely to be replicated. In contrast with 'black box' impact evaluation approaches, which only report mean differences in outcomes between treatment and comparison groups, theory-based impact evaluation involves mapping out the causal chain from inputs to outcomes and impact and testing the underlying assumptions. Most interventions within the realm of public policy are of a voluntary, rather than coercive (legally required) nature. In addition, interventions are often active rather than passive, requiring a greater rather than lesser degree of participation among beneficiaries and therefore behavior change as a pre-requisite for effectiveness. Public policy will therefore be successful to the extent that people are incentivized to change their behaviour favourably. A theory-based approach enables policy-makers to understand the reasons for differing levels of program participation (referred to as 'compliance' or 'adherence') and the processes determining behavior change. Theory-Based approaches use both quantitative and qualitative data collection, and the latter can be particularly useful in understanding the reasons for compliance and therefore whether and how the intervention may be replicated in other settings. Methods of qualitative data collection include focus groups, in-depth interviews, participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and field visits, as well as reading of anthropological and political literature. White (2009b) advocates more widespread application of a theory-based approach to impact evaluation as a means to improve policy relevance of impact evaluations, outlining six key principles of the theory-based approach: # Map out the causal chain (program theory) which explains how the intervention is expected to lead to the intended outcomes, and collect data to test the underlying assumptions of the causal links. # Understand context, including the social, political and economic setting of the intervention. # Anticipate heterogeneity to help in identifying sub-groups and adjusting the sample size to account for the levels of disaggregation to be used in the analysis. # Rigorous evaluation of impact using a credible counterfactual (as discussed above). # Rigorous factual analysis of links in the causal chain. # Use mixed methods (a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods).  Examples  While experimental impact evaluation methodologies have been used to assess nutrition and water and sanitation interventions in developing countries since the 1980s, the first, and best known, application of experimental methods to a large-scale development program is the evaluation of the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) program Progresa (now called Oportunidades) in Mexico, which examined a range of development outcomes, including schooling, immunization rates and child work.Gertler, P. (2000) Final Report: The Impact of PROGRESA on Health. International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington, D.C. CCT programs have since been implemented by a number of governments in Latin America and elsewhere, and a report released by the World Bank in February 2009 examines the impact of CCTs across twenty countries.Fiszbein, A. and Schady, N. (2009) Conditional Cash Transfers: Reducing present and future poverty: A World Bank Policy Research Report, World Bank, Washington, D.C. More recently, impact evaluation has been applied to a range of interventions across social and productive sectors. 3ie has launched an online database of impact evaluations covering studies conducted in low- and middle income countries. Other organisations publishing Impact Evaluations include Innovations for Poverty Action, the World Bank's DIME Initiative and NONIE. The IEG of the World Bank has systematically assessed and summarized the experience of ten impact evaluation of development programs in various sectors carried out over the past 20 years.Impact Evaluation: The Experience of the Independent Evaluation Group of the World Bank, 2006  Organizations promoting impact evaluation of development interventions  In 2006, the Evaluation Gap Working Group argued for a major gap in the evidence on development interventions, and in particular for an independent body to be set up to plug the gap by funding and advocating for rigorous impact evaluation in low- and middle-income countries. The International Initiative for Impact Evaluation (3ie) was set up in response to this report. 3ie seeks to improve the lives of poor people in low- and middle-income countries by providing, and summarizing, evidence of what works, when, why and for how much. 3ie operates a grant program, financing impact studies in low- and middle-income countries and synthetic reviews of existing evidence updated as new evidence appears, and supports quality impact evaluation through its quality assurance services. Another initiative devoted to the evaluation of impacts is the Committee on Sustainability Assessment (COSA). COSA is a non-profit global consortium of institutions, sustained in partnership with the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) Sustainable Commodity Initiative, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), and the United Nations International Trade Centre (ITC). COSA is developing and applying an independent measurement tool to analyze the distinct social, environmental and economic impacts of agricultural practices, and in particular those associated with the implementation of specific sustainability programs (Organic, Fairtrade etc.). The focus of the initiative is to establish global indicators and measurement tools which farmers, policy-makers, and industry can use to understand and improve their sustainability with different crops or agricultural sectors. COSA aims to facilitate this by enabling them to accurately calculate the relative costs and benefits of becoming involved in any given sustainability initiative. A number of additional organizations have been established to promote impact evaluation globally, including Innovations for Poverty Action, the World Bank's Strategic Impact Evaluation Fund (SIEF), the World Bank's Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) Initiative, the Institutional Learning and Change (ILAC) Initiative of the CGIAR, and the Network of Networks on Impact Evaluation (NONIE).  Systematic reviews of impact evidence  A range of organizations are working to coordinate the production of systematic reviews. Systematic reviews aim to bridge the research-policy divide by assessing the range of existing evidence on a particular topic, and presenting the information in an accessible format. Like rigorous impact evaluations, they are developed from a study Protocol which sets out a priori the criteria for study inclusion, search and methods of synthesis. Systematic reviews involve five key steps: determination of interventions, populations, outcomes and study designs to be included; searches to identify published and unpublished literature, and application of study inclusion criteria (relating to interventions, populations, outcomes and study design), as set out in study Protocol; coding of information from studies; presentation of quantitative estimates on intervention effectiveness using forest plots and, where interventions are determined as appropriately homogeneous, calculation of a pooled summary estimate using meta-analysis; finally, systematic reviews should be updated periodically as new evidence emerges. Systematic reviews may also involve the synthesis of qualitative information, for example relating to the barriers to, or facilitators of, intervention effectiveness.

Differences between the term \\"crew manager\\" and \\"crew commander\\" There is no difference in the term \\"crew commander\\" and \\"crew manager\\". They are the same \\"rank\\" or role. A \\"crew commander\\" is simply referred to as \\"crew manager\\" when on station engaged in daily administrative duties, or non-emergency situations. The \\"crew manager\\" is then referred to as \\"crew commander\\" when responding to / dealing with incidents or on the fire ground. Some firefighters dislike the use of the term \\"manager\\" as it implies an administrative role rather than a front line role. \\"Ranks to roles\\"  Confusingly firefighters and fire officers still wear markings on their uniforms to identify their role and status or seniority in the Fire Service. This has caused many firefighters and officers to question what \\"rank to roles\\" has really achieved. The new ranks to roles system has caused some confusion amongst firefighters on the fire ground, and from an administrative point of view at officer level. For instance a firefighter would have traditionally known that a divisional officer was a high-ranking officer in the brigade and should be addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\" (and sometimes should be saluted). However some divisional officers are now known under \\"role names\\". In the old rank system there would have been a \\"divisional officer\\" responsible for training new recruits, or a divisional officer in the fire safety department. Clearly both officers are of the same rank but perform different roles. The new regime tries to resolve this by calling the divisional officer responsible for recruit training a \\"training manager\\" whilst the divisional officer in fire safety is a \\"fire safety manager\\". If the officer in question is wearing rank markings on his / her uniform, other personnel can immediately determine his or her seniority. But if the officer corresponds by email, letter or telephone giving their new title other personnel may not be able to distinguish the officer's level of authority or seniority. This has caused great confusion between neighbouring brigades especially when not communicating in person because they may give their senior officers slightly different titles (they would wear identification marks on their uniform and therefore their seniority would be instantly quantifiable by officers from other brigades) Previous ranks and their present equivalents *Station officer - now referred to as watch commander (B) - 2 impellers on epaulettes. *Sub-officer - now referred to as watch commander (A) - sub officer used to have two silver bars on epaulettes but the new watch commander A role has two impellers on epaulettes, the same as a watch commander (B). *Leading firefighter - now referred to as crew commander - leading firefighter used to display one silver bar on epaulettes, crew commander has two bars on epaulettes. *Firefighters - no change.

Missouri's tallest habitable building from 1864 to 1894, it is now part of Gateway Arch National Park and operated by the National Park Service for historical exhibits and events. History Land for the courthouse was donated in 1816 by Judge John Baptiste Charles Lucas and St. Louis founder Auguste Chouteau. The NPS site says the donation was from \\"Auguste Chouteau.\\" Several members of the Chouteau clan have that name. It could also mean Auguste Pierre Chouteau. Lucas and Chouteau required the land be \\"used forever as the site on which the courthouse of the County of St. Louis should be erected.\\" The Federal style courthouse was completed in 1828. Interior of the courthouse rotunda. It was designed by the firm of Lavielle and Morton, which also designed the early buildings at Jefferson Barracks as well as the Old Cathedral. Lavielle and Morton was the first architecture firm west of the Mississippi River above New Orleans. As street commissioner in 1823‚Äì26, Joseph Laveille devised the city's street name grid, with ordinal numbers for north-south streets and arboreal names for east-west streets.Laveille and Morton - stlcin.missouri.org - Retrieved January 21, 2008 Missouri became a state in 1821, and the St. Louis population tripled in 10 years. A new courthouse was soon needed. In 1839, ground was broken on a courthouse designed by Henry Singleton in the Greek Revival style, with four wings, including an east wing that comprised the original courthouse and a three-story cupola dome at the center. In 1851, Robert S. Mitchell began a redesign of the courthouse in which the east wing was torn down and replaced. From 1855 to 1858, the west wing was remodeled. The famous Dred Scott citizenship case was heard in the west wing before the remodeling. In 1861, William Rumbold replaced the cupola with an Italian Renaissance cast iron dome modeled on St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. The United States Capitol dome, built at the same time during the American Civil War, is also modeled on the basilica. The St. Louis dome was completed in 1864, and Karl Ferdinand Wimar was commissioned to paint murals, which are featured in the rotunda.\\"Old Courthouse\\", National Park Service The last slave auction held at the Old Courthouse took place in 1861. Slave auctions were held in the Probate Courts of the Old Courthouse near the East Door. The Court ordered sales of slaves whose owners had died without a will or had declared bankruptcy. This was common practice in all Missouri courthouses. Rumbold's dome in the courthouse is wrought and cast iron with a copper exterior. Four lunettes in the dome have paintings by Carl Wimar, depicting four events in St. Louis history. Ettore Miragoli painted over them in 1880, but they were restored in 1888. Louis Brandeis was admitted to the bar in the Old Courthouse, in 1878.Jefferson National Expansion Memorial application for National Register of Historic Places - dnr.mo.gov When St. Louis County, Missouri and the city split in 1877, the courthouse became city property. The courthouse was abandoned by the city in 1930 after it built the Civil Courts Building, and descendants of Chouteau and Lucas sued to regain ownership. In 1935, during the Great Depression, St. Louis voted for a bond issue to raze nearly 40 blocks around the courthouse in the center of St. Louis for the new Gateway Arch National Park, which was then known as Jefferson National Expansion Memorial. President Franklin Roosevelt declared in an Executive Order the area would be a national monument and landscape design, sidewalks and other infrastructure was added. The courthouse formally became part of the new monument area in 1940. Replaced in 1941, the roof was renovated in 1955, 1985 and 2010. The National Park Service maintains four history galleries on St. Louis and NPS offices within. The courthouse once had up to 12 courtrooms, but now there are two in period presentation. The east wing has Circuit Court #13 restored to its 1910 appearance, while the west wing has Circuit Court #4 restored to an approximate 1850s detail. The courthouse building was the tallest building in Missouri and St. Louis until 1896 when Union Station was built. It remained the largest structure in the national monument until the Gateway Arch was built in 1965. Notable cases *In 1846 the slave Dred Scott sued for his and his wife's freedom as they had been held as slaves in free states. All of the trials, including a Missouri Supreme Court hearing, were held in the Old Courthouse. The case was ultimately decided by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford, which ruled against the Scotts, saying they did not have grounds as citizens to sue. *In 1872 Virginia Minor attempted to vote in a St. Louis election and was arrested. Her trials, including the deliberations before the Missouri Supreme Court, were held in this building. The United States Supreme Court in Minor v. Happersett (1875) upheld the male-only voting rules, as the Constitution did not address voting rules, which were set by the states.

Vienna, 19 April 1691) was an Austrian physician and sanitary engineer. He went to school in Paderborn, then attended the University of Padua, where apparently he obtained his degree of Doctor of Philosophy and Medicine. He practiced as a physician in Rome, Cologne, and Arnhem, and in August, 1652, was made a member of the medical faculty of the University of Vienna. In 1655 he became professor of theoretical medicine at the same university, and in 1666 professor of practical medicine. In 1658 he was appointed court-physician to the Empress- Dowager Eleonora. In 1676 he rebuilt at his own expense the students' hall \\"Goldberg\\" and added a chapel to it. During the Great Plague of Vienna (1679), the Emperor Leopold I appointed him official councillor and chief supervisor of sanitary conditions in Vienna. Soon after this he was ennobled. In 1681 he resigned his professorship and founded a scholarship for medical students. During the siege of Vienna by the Turks in 1683 he commanded the company formed of students as chief sergeant-major. His tomb is in the Cathedral of St. Stephen in Vienna. In 1909 the national association of the official doctors of Austria selected Sorbait's portrait as the insignia of the association.

The story was nominated for a Retro Hugo Award in 2001.1951 Retro Hugo Awards Plot summary The story is set in Manhattan during a protracted war between the United States and the Soviet Union; midtown Manhattan has been rendered an uninhabitable wasteland by a Soviet \\"Hell Bomb,\\" though the rest of the city is still occupied. The narrator is a British citizen named Wysten Turner, who is in New York to barter, in exchange for grain, electronic equipment that he suspects will be used in the construction of an American military base on the moon. As the story begins, he pulls a young woman out of the way of a car; apparently it is a favorite gang activity to snag women's clothing with fishhooks welded to their cars' fenders, although this car came a bit too close. Turner involves the police, but they do not regard the incident as serious, and he ends up bribing them to go away. The wearing of masks, akin to the Muslim burka but carrying no religious significance, has become all but mandatory for fashionable American women. Turner therefore cannot see the face of the woman he has helped, and he is intrigued. She arranges for him to meet her later, and they go to a nightclub. She begs him to help her escape America, explaining that her boyfriend, a professional wrestler, beats her when he loses a wrestling match. Turner's sense of chivalry is aroused, and a fight occurs when the boyfriend arrives. Turner, to his surprise, knocks the boyfriend down, but when he does, the girl turns on him rather than thanking him for defending her. Her quasi-seduction of Turner is a ploy she has used on other men in the past, as all those around her already know. She never intended to leave the wrestler, as she craves his abuse. Turner rips the mask from her face, but is repulsed by her lack of grooming and by her expression of hatred. He leaves, anxious to return to England. Reception Coming Attraction was among the stories selected in 1970 by the Science Fiction Writers of America as one of the best science fiction short stories published before the creation of the Nebula Awards. As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964. It has been anthologized and collected at least 25 times.

Little scientific knowledge exists of their total extent and the cause of their unique coloration.

The subspecies was reported by William Healey Dall in 1895. This variation can be seen on individual bears that are often lighter on their backs and shoulders, with their legs and belly being much darker or even black. Habitat and range The glacier bear's habitat ranges have been reported to be the Alaskan coastal areas between Cross Sound and Cape St. Elias and from Prince William Sound to Glacier Bay in southeast Alaska, with a few sightings as far east as Juneau, Alaska, and the Taku River.https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/episodes/bears-of-the-last- frontier/hour-two-the-road-north/black-bear-fact- sheet/7012/http://bear.org/website/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=35:classification- of-black-bears&catid;=15&Itemid;=38 This region includes Glacier Bay National Park and portions of Tongass National Forest, a temperate rainforest preserve.Threatened Wildlife of the United States, U.S. Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, Washington, for sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. Govt. Print. Office. Few studies document the subspecies' range in association with other black bears. See for instance Hall's 1981 The Mammals of North America.(Erickson 1965) Hall, E. Raymond. 1981. The Mammals of North America, Vols. I & II. John Wiley & Sons, New York, New York. Glacier bears share most of the characteristics of black bears such as their habitat preferences, food sources, size, and reproductive cycles. They prefer forest with thick understory and landscapes with abundant vegetation, but can be found in urban populated areas. The glacier bear habitat is dependent upon food source availability, and they move between forest, meadows, streams, and mountains in search of food and shelter. Black bears in general are very capable climbers and can use trees as a place of protection and refuge. Glacier bears move into their dens in early winter, which can be an overturned tree, a rock ledge, or a cave. Diet Glacier bears, like all other black bears, are omnivores, with their diets varying depending on the food source available during the season and the location. Their diet includes young shoots and roots in early spring. During the summer in Alaska, the glacier bear eats the abundant Pacific salmon spawning in the streams. In some areas, moose and deer are a food source for black bears. During the fall, the bears eat the starchy roots of ground cones and the variety of berries found in Alaska such as blueberries, salmonberries, raspberries, and cranberries. Reproduction Breeding habits are much like any other black bear. The glacier bear female normally has her first litter by 3‚Äì5 years of age. This breeding period takes place in June through July. Gestation lasts 235 days and cubs are born in January to early February.Powell, Roger A., Zimmerman, John Wayne and Seaman, David Erran (1997) Ecology and behaviour of North American black bears: home ranges, habitat, and social organization. Vol. 4. Springer, . Because of the increasing range of all subspecies of black bears since the last glacier maximum, interbreeding is taking place. It is thus possible to see a black- colored bear give birth to a bear with the glacier bears' pelage and vice versa. Research Very little is known about this rare color variation, so some potential threats could become an issue for the glacier bear. Some of these threats are overharvesting and gene swamping. Currently, no population projections are made due to the lack of genetic understanding. With the interbreeding capabilities of other black bears with different pelage, determining the future distinctive color variation and population density may become even more complicated. Also, speculation exists that the glacier bear had its origins in hybrids between black bears and grizzlies.Bear facts Further reading * Canadian Geographic: The north's elusive: Glacier bear, by Ann Britton Campbell, 139, #1, january/february 2019, pp 37 ‚Äì 44, cf.

The book is named after its main character, Alcatraz Smedry. Plot summary Alcatraz Versus the Evil Librarians is a young adult novel about Alcatraz Smedry, a young teen who is always breaking things. After receiving a bag of sand for his thirteenth birthday, he is involved in a strange set of events which begins with a group of librarians stealing his bag of sand, which turns out to have rather unusual properties. The book starts with Alcatraz setting fire to his foster parents' kitchen. It is revealed that he has been in countless foster homes, always ending up with Alcatraz \\"destroying\\" things precious to the people taking care of him. Ms. Fletcher, Alcatraz's personal caseworker, arrives and scolds him for destroying his foster parents' kitchen. The next day an old man arrives at the house and claims to be his grandfather, telling Alcatraz that he has a special, powerful talent, which is breaking things. He later finds out that there is a secret society called the Librarians, whose purpose is to conquer the remaining Free Kingdoms and rule the world. Characters The plot evolves around the title character and a small group of freedom fighters operating against the cult of evil librarians that secretly rule the world. These freedom fighters include Alcatraz's grandfather, Leavenworth, usually just referred to as \\"Grandpa Smedry\\"; Bastille, Grandpa's bodyguard and a Crystin Knight; Sing Sing - Sing for short - Alcatraz's Polynesian cousin; and Quentin, another cousin. The Librarians include Shasta / Ms. Fletcher, Alcatraz's case worker and Radrian Blackburn, a Dark Oculator. Smedry Talents In the course of the book, it is revealed that Alcatraz's biological family, the Smedrys, all are born with amazing talents that they use to combat the evil cult of librarians. Alcatraz has the talent of breaking things. Grandpa Smedry, Alcatraz's grandfather, has the power to arrive late. As such, he is always running behind the clock. But his power also allows him to arrive late to other things, like bullets, which always miss him, and his blood can arrive late to wounds so that he doesn't bleed to death. In his own words \\"I've been arriving late to my own death for years now.\\" Sing, Alcatraz's cousin's talent is the ability to trip and fall to the ground. This helps when this is a sign of danger. Quentin, another cousin, has the talent to speak gibberish or nonsensical phrases. His talent proves beneficial when he is captured by the librarians, as they cannot understand him and thus cannot gain important information from him, even through torture. It is through some of Quentin's supposed gibberish that Alcatraz is prompted to know what to do in future events. Smedrys from ancient days had grand talents, though relatively unexplained. One could get unbelievable amounts of water on the ground when she did the dishes, which allowed her to end a drought. Another could make rude noises at inappropriate moments, breaking enemies' concentration so they could not use weapons. If someone not related to the Smedrys marries a Smedry, the person marrying into the family gets their spouse's Talent. Sequels Alcatraz Versus the Scrivener's Bones was released in the United States November 1, 2008. A third Alcatraz book, called Alcatraz Versus the Knights of Crystallia, was released on October 1, 2009. The fourth book, Alcatraz Versus the Shattered Lens, and was released on December 1, 2010. In early 2013, because Scholastic only commissioned the first four books, and was unwilling to publish the fifth book, Sanderson bought back the rights to the series.http://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Dark_Talent He later sold the series to Tor Books who republished the series. The fifth book of the series, entitled Alcatraz Versus the Dark Talent, was released September 6, 2016. The sixth book, ( Bastille vs. the Evil Librarians: The Worldspire) is almost finished, and is expected to be released in 2021-2022.

In 2004 the owner of the Docks, Forth Ports, announced plans to close the port and carry out a major redevelopment of the area.

As such, it was published in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964. Plot summary In a post-apocalyptic technocratic future Earth, religion has been banned and the Catholic church has gone underground, relying on secret cells and symbols as in the days of the early church. The narrator is a crypto-priest named Thomas, who is charged by the secret Pope with finding the resting place of a semi-legendary figure called Aquin. Aquin had been an evangelist of great power who converted all those who listened to him preach, and his body supposedly never rotted after his death. The Pope believes that this miracle, if true, will be a powerful tool in winning new converts. Thomas is provided with an intelligent multi-terrain transportation device called a \\"robass,\\" to assist him in reaching the area where Aquin's body supposedly rests. To his surprise, the vehicle is theologically literate and tries to persuade him to abandon his quest, arguing for example that he had not been asked to find Aquin, but rather to report that he had so that the pope could begin the process of canonization. Thomas resists the robass' persuasive arguments in the main, though he does succumb to the temptation to drink and carouse with a pretty half-Martian barmaid in a small town. The people in the town discover he is a priest, beat and rob him, leaving him for dead. He is ignored by all passers-by, but Abraham, an orthodox Jew, rescues him and nurses him back to health. He is able to return to his quest with the help of several secret believers in God. Various episodes from the New Testament are echoed as his quest continues. Ultimately, Thomas does locate Aquin, only to find that he was a robot, and that therefore the legend of his incorruptibility was true...in a sense: his body could not possibly have decayed as he was never made of flesh. The robass had known this all along. The priest realizes that if a robot, with its perfect logic, believed in God, others can be convinced of God's existence by simply using perfect reason. Thomas orders the robass to leave him alone and the story ends with him praying by the side of Aquin's body. Notes This story makes reference to the short story \\"Reason\\" by Isaac Asimov, specifically referring to a robot on a space station that venerated a non-human creator.

Klunder (July 12, 1937 - April 7, 1964) was a Presbyterian minister and civil right activist, born in Colorado. He died when he was run over by a bulldozer while protesting the construction of a segregated school in Cleveland, Ohio. Klunder graduated from Yale Divinity School and then went to Cleveland in 1961 as assistant executive secretary of the Student Christian Union at Western Reserve University. He quickly became involved in the city's civil rights fight. He had a passionate interest in civil rights, headed the local chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and led a restaurant sit-in in Sewanee, Tennessee in 1962. He was married, with two young children. Death Klunder frequently did picket duty, demonstrating for fair housing and against racially segregated public facilities and racial discrimination in hiring. When the Cleveland City School District decided to build new schools that would have reinforced the pattern of segregated neighborhood enrollment, Klunder took the lead in attempting to stop construction. One afternoon about 100 demonstrators threw themselves at the wheels and treads of bulldozers, power shovels, trucks and mobile concrete mixers to prevent the school from being built. A power shovel operator watched as six people‚Äîincluding a woman five months pregnant‚Äîleaped into a ditch and stretched out prone just beneath the shovel's jaws. Police officers tried to disperse the demonstrators, but many came out of the muck fighting. Twenty-one were arrested that day, and two were injured. The next day Klunder and about 1,000 other demonstrators returned to the school. Already awaiting them were dozens of Cleveland police officers. Moments later, Klunder, two women, and another man dashed across the school lot toward a bulldozer. Three of them flung themselves into the path of the steel treads. Klunder lay down behind the machine. The driver, John White, 33, stopped when he saw the three in front. He looked around but did not see Klunder, and he backed up. When he finally stopped the vehicle, Klunder was dead. Klunder, after he had been crushed to death  Aftermath  Klunder's death ignited angry confrontations that devolved into \\"rock-throwing, car- smashing disorders\\". Cleveland police eventually used tear gas to disperse the crowds, which numbered more than 3,500 protesters. The Plain Dealer reported that \\"police ... were forced to use tear gas bombs to scatter crowds that would not clear out of the neighborhoods.... Thirteen persons, including eight policemen, were injured in the fighting. Twenty-six persons, including women, were arrested and jailed.\\" The next day, demonstrators formed a silent memorial in front of the Board of Education Building in downtown Cleveland. Funeral services for Klunder were held at the Church of the Covenant. Eugene Carson Blake, head of the United Presbyterian Church, delivered the eulogy and 1,500 people attended. Klunder's death polarized the Cleveland community. Some saw his death as an inevitable result of the breakdown of law and order. Others viewed his activism as an act of love. Klunder is one of the 41 individuals listed as civil rights martyrs at the national Civil Rights Memorial in Montgomery, Alabama. In 2013, the school whose construction sparked the protests was torn down and long-time Cleveland residents were interviewed about its history. Rev. E Theophilus Caviness of the Greater Abyssinia Baptist Church was at the scene in 1964; he told the Plain Dealer: \\"Every time I pass that school, it's sacred ground. It's a sacred location to all of us who were here and saw what the struggle was all about.\\" See also *United Freedom Movement References External links   * ‚Äì photo of Joanne Klunder and daughter picketing the National Governors Conference * ‚Äì information about the Businessmen's Interracial Committee on Community Affairs, an organization formed in the wake of Klunder's death and supported by the Greater Cleveland Associated Foundation, which merged into the Cleveland Foundation Category:1937 births Category:1964 deaths Category:American civil rights activists Category:American Presbyterian ministers Category:Oregon clergy Category:Oregon State University alumni Category:Yale Divinity School alumni ","title":"Bruce W.

The Sirius was built with modern specifications at the Boele shipyard in the Netherlands in 1950 as one of 7 pilot vessels. The ship, originally owned by the Royal Dutch Navy, was sold to Greenpeace during 1981 while in dry dock. The ship was refitted, repaired, and repainted. It took ten weeks to paint her. The ship's colour scheme was soon changed to a green hull and rainbow colours and a white dove of peace with an olive branch was painted on the bow. Sirius was refitted with more modern navigation systems, communication equipment, lifeboats, and rafts. The pantries were turned into outdoor engine rooms and the mess room became a storage room. Sirius served as the flagship of Greenpeace Netherlands through 1998, after which she was retired. Until 2018 she was docked at Amsterdam, where she serves in an educational capacity, offering shipboard tours and environmental education. At around midnight on September 30‚Äì31, 1988, while on passage from Cabrera to Barcelona, Sirius was forced to seek shelter in Majorca during a Force 9 severe gale. After turning the vessel, the crew sighted distress flares 8 miles from Dragonera Island. Sirius set course for the flares, and a small sailing yacht was found to be sinking. One of her four British crew was missing overboard, but two young men were rescued. A fourth, skipper Ron Davies of Honor Oak, Lewisham, went down with the yacht when it sank during the rescue. Sirius continued to search for the missing men and then took the two survivors to Port D'Andratx when she was relieved by a navy patrol boat and a tug sent from Palma.Greenpeace Press Statement, Saturday September 31, 1988.

As collected in Blish's The Seedling Stars, it was revised to incorporate material from his earlier story \\"Sunken Universe\\", published in Super Science Stories in 1942.Index to Science Fiction Anthologies and Collections Plot summary A human colonization ship crash-lands on a distant planet which is Earth-like but whose only landmass is completely covered in shallow puddles of water and mostly microscopic life forms. Normal humans could not survive on this planet, so the crew must genetically engineer their descendants into something that can survive. (Blish coined the term pantropy to refer to this concept.) They create a race of microscopic aquatic humanoids to complete their mission and colonize the planet. The majority of the story concerns one group of these genetically engineered colonists and their intelligence, curiosity, and evolving technology. In particular, the tiny aquatic humanoids develop a \\"space ship\\", or rather \\"air ship\\", which enables them to pierce the previously impenetrable surface tension of the water and travel through what is, to them, hostile space‚Äîopen air‚Äîto other worlds in other puddles of water.

It was originally published in the United States in 1997 (and in the United Kingdom under the title Gate of Ivory in 1998.) The story is a prequel to Mythago Wood and explores Christian Huxley's quest into Ryhope Wood and the apparent suicide of his mother, Jennifer Huxley. The title of the book refers to the gates of horn and ivory described in both Homer's Odyssey and Virgil's Aeneid. Conception The tale The Cattle Raid of Cooley was an inspiration according to the author.Holdstock, Robert Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn, (New York, NY: Roc Books, 1997), Acknowledgements page. David Langford, an author, editor and literary critic, points out that the multitude of impossible tasks placed before one of the main characters is based on the Mabinogion's incomplete tale of Culhwch and Olwen.Langford, David Supernatural Fiction Writers, Second Edition, Volume 1, ed. Richard Bleiler (New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003), page 450. Plot summary Original UK cover by Larry Rostant Christian Huxley enters Ryhope wood on a search for the compelling mythago Guiwenneth and for a better understanding of his mother's suicide. Inside the wood he joins a small group of mythago companions who, in turn, join a vast army of mythagos, numbering in the thousands. This army includes many mythic archetypes including shaman, shapeshifters, and warriors. Among these mythagos are those whose creation is influenced by King Arthur and the Welsh tales of the Mabinogion, specifically the tale of Culhwch and Olwen. Echoing the tales of Culhwch and Olwen, Christian is assigned with completing many impossible tasks. Holdstock uses the story within a story device to have Kylhuk retell a tale involving himself, Olwen and Pwyll, among others. This army, known as a legion, is pursued by the angry dead on its search for the gates to the underworld. As Christian nears the end of his quest in the wood, he has an opportunity to enter the underworld (like Orpheus) and grapple with the suicide of his mother which has two very different manifestations, one true and one false. While in the underworld he is also faced with a difficult choice of rescuing only one of two loved ones from death.Langford, David Supernatural Fiction Writers, Second Edition, Volume 1, ed. Richard Bleiler (New York, NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2003), page 449.

Awards Gate of Ivory was a nominee for the British Fantasy Society's Best Novel award in 1998. Chronology of works in the Mythago Wood cycle The order in which the Mythago cycle works were written/published does not necessarily correspond to the order of events within the realm of the Mythago Wood cycle. For example, Gate of Ivory, Gate of Horn and the novella The Bone Forest are prequels to Mythago Wood even though they were published at a later date. The novel Merlin's Wood (1994) and short stories in The Bone Forest and Merlin's Wood have little bearing on the events in the Ryhope wood.

Plants in this genus are epiphytes with long, sometimes branched, fibrous stems, leathery leaves in two ranks and large numbers of small, densely crowded flowers on a pendulous flowering stem. There are about eighty species found from tropical and subtropical Asia to the Western Pacific. Description Orchids in the genus Robiquetia are epiphytic, monopodial herbs with pendulous, fibrous, sometimes branching stems and many smooth roots. The leaves are arranged in two ranks and are thick and leathery, oblong to elliptic, with a divided, asymmetrical, tip. Many small, densely crowded flowers are arranged on a pendulous flowering stem that emerges from a leaf axil. The sepals and petals are similar to each other and the labellum has three lobes and an inflated spur on its tip. Taxonomy and naming The genus Robiquetia was first formally described in 1829 by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupr√© and the description was published in his book Voyage autour du monde from a specimen collected in the Maluku Islands.

Minnick, who long considered himself a political independent, was recruited to run against incumbent Republican Senator Larry Craig in the 1996 Senate election in Idaho by then-Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Although Minnick originally intended to enter the race as an Independent, he was convinced to run as a Democrat by former Idaho Governor Cecil D. Andrus.Broder, David S. Tales From Longworth. The Washington Post. January 8, 2009. Minnick lost the race 283,532 votes (57.02%) to 198,422 (39.91%).United States Senate election in Idaho, 1996 U.S. House of Representatives=Elections=2008 Minnick ran unopposed in the 2008 Democratic primary held in late May. An expected primary challenge by 2006 nominee Larry Grant was averted when Grant withdrew from the race and endorsed Minnick the previous month. Although the 1st is a heavily Republican district, Democrats thought they had a realistic chance of winning the district because the Republican incumbent, Bill Sali, had been a lightning rod for controversy. In the November 4, 2008 general election, Minnick narrowly defeated Sali, taking 50.6 percent of the vote to Sali's 49.4 percent. While Minnick carried only seven of the district's 18 counties, he prevailed largely by winning Ada County, home to Boise and more than two-thirds of the district's vote, by 4,000 votes. With his victory, Minnick represented the third most Republican district in the nation to be held by a Democrat and he became the first Democrat to represent Idaho at the federal level since Larry LaRocco, who represented the 1st District for two terms until the 1994 elections. At the time, the district had a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+18. John McCain easily carried the district with over 60 percent of the vote in 2008. 2010 Minnick was the only Democrat endorsed by the Tea Party.\\"Walt Minnick: The Tea Party's 'token Democrat'?\\" The Week.

Orchids in this genus are epiphytic plants with thick roots, relatively thick, fibrous stems and many large, thick, leathery leaves arranged in two ranks. The flowers are usually small and yellowish with light brown or purple markings. The flowers have broad sepals, narrower petals and a labellum which has three lobes and is often hairy. There are about 85 species distributed from tropical and subtropical Asia to the north-western Pacific. Most species grow in rainforest. Description Orchids in the genus Trichoglottis are epiphytic or climbing herbs with a monopodial habit, thick roots and straggly or pendulous stems. There are many large, leathery linear to elliptic leaves arranged in two ranks with their bases sheathing the stems. From one to a few relatively small flowers are arranged on flowering stems arising from leaf axils. The flowers are resupinate and commonly yellowish with light brown or purple markings. They tend to be produced sporadically throughout the year and last for about a week. The sepals are free and subsimilar. The petals are also free from each other and slightly shorter than the sepals. The labellum is fixed rigidly to the column, fleshy, pubescent or hairy, formed by three lobes and features a sac or spur. Taxonomy and naming The genus Trichoglottis was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume and the description was published in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´. =Species list= The following is a list of species of Trichoglottis accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families as at January 9019: * Trichoglottis acutifolia Ridl. * Trichoglottis adnata J.J.Sm. * Trichoglottis agusanensis Ames & Quisumb. * Trichoglottis amesiana L.O.Williams * Trichoglottis angusta J.J.Sm. * Trichoglottis atropurpurea Rchb.f. * Trichoglottis australiensis Dockrill * Trichoglottis biglandulosa (Blume) Kocyan & Schuit. * Trichoglottis bimae Rchb.f. * Trichoglottis bipenicillata J.J.Sm. * Trichoglottis bipunctata (C.S.P.Parish & Rchb.f.)

She worked the Glasgow to New York transatlantic route and was sunk by the German submarine on 7 February 1917. Building SS California was (6,791 under deck and 5,403 net), with a length of , a beam of and a draught of . The California had three decks: the poop deck was long, the bridge long and the forecastle long. She had two black funnels, two giant masts (one fore and one aft), twin screw propeller propulsion and was capable of achieving a speed of . She was fitted with a triple expansion engine with 6 cylinders of 27, 46 and 75 inches each pair; it had a stroke of 54 inches and produced 827 nominal horsepower. The engine was built by the same company that built her hull. The ship was capable of carrying a total of 1214 passengers: 232 first class, 248 second class and 734 third class. She was outfitted with the latest appointments, including electric light and refrigerating machinery. History SS California in New York Harbor around 1907 =Launch= She was officially launched on 9 July 1907, having been christened by the Lady Ure Primrose, wife of Sir John Ure Primrose, Lord Lieutenant of the County of the City of Glasgow. Captain J Blaikie was appointed to the ship that same year. She was given the call sign \\"HLQJ\\", and the official registration number 124230. Her maiden transatlantic voyage from Glasgow to New York began on 12 October 1907. =Grounding on Tory Island= On 28 June 1914 California ran aground on Tory Island off the north- west coast of Ireland in dense fog with over 1,000 passengers on board. The ship‚Äôs bows caved in upon impact, and though she took on water through two holes in her hold she remained above water. Three British warships including the destroyer Swift, as well as the ocean liner Cassandra, aided the stricken vessel and assisted in transferring stranded passengers back to shore. The ship was towed back to Glasgow on 20 August 1914, and less than two months later was repaired and refloated. She resumed Glasgow - Liverpool - New York sailings for the Cunard - Anchor joint service on 13 October 1915. =Fire in Manhattan= Shortly after 8 pm on 13 May 1916 a fire began in her Number 1 cargo hold as she was docked at Pier 64 on the North River in Manhattan. Of great concern to the first responders and her crew was that she was in the process of being loaded up with, amongst other things, highly volatile war munitions destined for Liverpool, England. The quick action of the Superintendent of the Pier, and his subsequent sounding of the alarm, led to a quick response by a nearby fireboat that assisted the crew in fighting the blaze. The fire was successfully extinguished shortly after 1030 pm that same night. The fire was ultimately deemed accidental, and as the damage was minimal, she set sail the following Monday as scheduled. Had the fire not been noticed by the superintendent in time, or had the ship been fully loaded with munitions when the fire erupted, the ship and surrounding section of Manhattan might have sustained a catastrophe comparable to the Halifax Explosion. =Loss= California sailed on her last Glasgow to New York voyage on 12 January 1917. She began her return voyage on 29 January 1917 with 184 crew and 31 passengers on board. On 3 February 1917, as she sailed on her return trip towards Scotland, German U-boats attacked and sank the SS Housatonic, an act which led to the breaking off of diplomatic relations between the United States and the German Empire. On the morning of 7 February 1917 when homeward- bound and approaching Ireland under full steam, she was attacked by in a surprise attack. The German submarine, under the command of Kapitanleutenant Willy Petz, fired two torpedoes at California; one struck the ship squarely on the port quarter near the Number 4 hatch. Five people were killed instantly in the explosion; thirty-six people drowned either as the ship went down or when one filled lifeboat was swamped in the wake of the burning vessel, which plowed ahead losing little headway as she went down. She sank in nine minutes, W by S of Fastnet Rock, Ireland with a loss of 41 lives. Though Captain John L Henderson stayed on the bridge through the entire incident, and subsequently went down with the ship, incredibly he made his way to the surface and was rescued. According to the Royal Navy, on 12 March 1917 the Q-ship avenged the sinking of California. Posing as an unarmed merchant vessel, the crew of Privet lured U-85 to the surface after sustaining heavy damage in an unprovoked attack by the submarine. As Privet‚Äôs highly trained crew feigned abandoning ship, they uncovered the ship‚Äôs hidden guns and opened fire on the submarine at close range. U-85 was sunk by gunfire, and Kapitanleutenant Petz and his crew of 37 men were killed.

The incident resulted in the ejection of both nations, and while the Soviets had already been eliminated from medal contention, the disqualification cost Canada a medal ‚Äì potentially the gold. The brawl is famous for officials having turned off the arena lights in a desperate attempt at ending the 20-minute melee. Much of the blame was placed on Norwegian referee Hans R√∏nning, who had been selected for the game based on his perceived neutrality rather than experience. Following the brawl, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) suspended the players involved for 18 months and the coaches for three years. The players' suspensions were later reduced to six months on appeal, allowing several players from both teams to return for the 1988 tournament in Moscow. Both nations won medals in 1988; Canada won the gold medal while the Soviets won silver. The brawl dramatically raised the profile of the World Junior Hockey Championships in Canada, where it is now one of the top events on the annual sports calendar. The fervent patriotism displayed by Canadian Broadcasting Corporation analyst Don Cherry in the aftermath led to a sharp rise in his own popularity with Canadian fans. Several players in that game went on to play in the National Hockey League, including Brendan Shanahan, Theoren Fleury, Mike Keane, Sergei Fedorov, Alexander Mogilny, and Vladimir Konstantinov. Hockey's \\"Cold War\\" Canada and the Soviet Union had engaged in an increasingly intense rivalry since the Soviets first emerged on the international scene by winning the 1954 World Ice Hockey Championships. From 1963 until 1983, the Soviets captured 17 World Championship titles amidst repeated accusations from Canada that their teams were made up of professionals masquerading as amateurs. The accusations eventually led to Canada boycotting all World Championships and Olympic hockey tournaments between 1970 and 1976. Finally, the 1972 Summit Series was organized, pitting the Soviet all-stars against Canada's NHL all-stars. The eight-game series was won by Canada 4‚Äì3‚Äì1 as Paul Henderson scored the winning goal late in the deciding contest. The Soviets handily won a second Summit Series against the World Hockey Association all-stars in 1974. The series led to the creation of the Canada Cup, a tournament held five times between 1976 and 1991. Canada won four titles, losing to the Soviet Union in 1981. Also from 1976 until 1991, top Soviet club teams toured the NHL in what became known as the Super Series. The World Junior Championships were formally created in 1977, and to that point had been dominated by the Soviet Union with seven championships. Until 1982, Canada sent either their Memorial Cup champion or an all-star team. 1982 was the first time Canada sent a national junior team, under the auspices of Hockey Canada's Program of Excellence. The Canadians won that tournament, and again in 1985. The \\"Cold War\\" culminated in 1987 with Rendez-vous '87, as the Soviet national team played a two-game series against the NHL all-stars in place of the NHL All-Star Game. The series was split, with the NHL winning the first game 4‚Äì3, and the Soviets the second, 5‚Äì3. The 1987 Canada Cup followed, and was won by Canada two games to one, with the third game being described as the greatest in hockey history. The winning goal was scored by Mario Lemieux on a pass from Wayne Gretzky. Game summary In 1987, the World Junior Hockey Championship was a round robin tournament. The teams with the top three records won the gold, silver and bronze medals. Finland had finished their schedule with a 5‚Äì1‚Äì1 record to lead the tournament. Canada entered the game with a 4‚Äì1‚Äì1 record, and had already been assured the bronze medal. A victory against the Soviets would have guaranteed Canada the silver, and a victory by 5 goals or more would have won the gold medal. The Soviet Union, entering the game with a 2‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, had already been eliminated from medal contention. The match-up between the two squads was deliberately scheduled to be the final game of the tournament as organizers expected at least one of the teams would be playing for the gold medal. The IIHF assigned Norway's Hans R√∏nning as the referee for this game. The assignment was made based on his neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level. Upon hearing of R√∏nning's assignment, Canadian representative Dennis McDonald sought out IIHF supervisor of officials, Ren√© Fasel, hoping to convince him to select a different referee. Aside from the question of his competence to call a game of this magnitude, the Canadians were concerned about R√∏nning following an earlier game in the tournament he officiated between Canada and the United States. A wild brawl had broken out during the pre-game warm-ups against the Americans three days earlier. The officials were not on the ice when the melee occurred; however, R√∏nning ejected one player from each team at random for starting the brawl. Canadian captain Steve Chiasson was thus barred from the game against the Americans, as well as the following game after being assessed a match penalty. Unable to convince IIHF officials to change the assignment, McDonald was concerned about how the game would be played. R√∏nning's inexperience at that level was later identified as a significant cause of the brawl, as several stick infractions by both sides had gone uncalled, causing anger to rise between both teams. Off the opening faceoff, Sergei Shesterikov elbowed Canadian Dave McLlwain, who responded by cross-checking the Soviet player. Neither player was assessed a penalty. Five minutes in, Theoren Fleury scored the opening goal for Canada. In celebrating the goal, Fleury slid across centre ice on his knees acting as if his stick was a machine gun and pretended to \\"open fire\\" on the Soviet bench. Canadian Amateur Hockey Association president Murray Costello later called it an \\"inflammatory act, completely unnecessary, lacking any sort of respect.\\" The first period continued in similar fashion with both teams repeatedly slashing their opponents and Canada emerging with a 3‚Äì1 lead. Interviewed by the CBC during the intermission, Fleury described the atmosphere on the ice: \\"The boys are up for the gold medal. Everybody is so tense. Tempers are flying. It's really tough out there ... I can't believe it. It's so tense. It's so tense.\\" Early in the second period, the game was paused for a moment of silence in memory of four Swift Current Broncos players who were killed when their team bus crashed in Saskatchewan five days previous. There was a drop in intensity in the five minutes of play that followed. However, just after the six-minute mark, following a minor scuffle that sent two players from each team to the penalty box, the teams resumed shoving and slashing at each other. Each team also scored a goal, giving Canada a 4‚Äì2 lead halfway through the game. =The brawl= The scoreboard in the darkened arena showing Canada leading 4‚Äì2 The brawl began after a face-off as Shesterikov collided with Everett Sanipass with 6:07 left in the second period, resulting in a fight between the two. Soviet player Pavel Kostichkin also leveled a two-handed slash at Fleury, leading to another fight. The battle quickly escalated into a line brawl involving all skaters on the ice for both teams. Returning from a commercial break, Canadian commentator Don Wittman understated the severity of the fighting by saying \\"well, we had a real skirmish just moments ago following a face-off.\\" Evgeny Davydov was the first player from either team to leave his bench to join the melee, prompting all players from both teams to leave their benches. Mike Keane paired off against Valeri Zelepukin, with the Canadian \\"fighting like it was for the world title\\" according to Fleury. In another fight, Vladimir Konstantinov leveled a head-butt that broke Greg Hawgood's nose; Brendan Shanahan later described it as \\"the greatest head-butt I've ever seen\\". St√©phane Roy was pummeled by two Soviet players. The remaining players paired off as the officials attempted to break up the fighting. There were at least a dozen separate fights over the entire ice surface. Unable to control the situation, R√∏nning and his linesmen eventually left the ice under the orders of Czechoslovakian officials. In a desperate attempt at ending the brawl, tournament officials had the arena lights turned off, leaving the players to fight in the dark as the fans whistled loudly in disapproval of the entire situation. The whole stadium shouted \\"My chceme hokej, my chceme hokej\\", which translates to \\"We want hockey, we want hockey\\". By the time the fights had finally broken up, the IIHF declared the game null and void. =Boxscore=Aftermath The IIHF held an emergency meeting in an arena office to decide how to handle the incident. Each team was represented by a delegate, and the meeting was chaired by IIHF President G√ºnther Sabetzki. The delegates voted 7‚Äì1 in favour of ejecting both teams from the tournament, the lone dissenting vote being that of Canada's Dennis McDonald. McDonald was incensed by the voting: Finland, Czechoslovakia and Sweden all stood to gain medal position by voting the two teams out, the Americans only promised support if other nations supported Canada, and Sabetzki could barely control his disdain for the Canadians. After voting to eject the two teams, IIHF officials banned the Soviets from the tournament banquet and medal ceremony but still invited Canada. McDonald stated the Canadians were not interested, Sabetzki and Czechoslovak officials ordered the Canadian team out of the arena within half an hour. They were met by armed soldiers who escorted them across the border and out of Czechoslovakia. The IIHF voided the individual standings of both teams. In the words of McDonald, \\"it was like we were never here.\\" However, the other teams kept the points they gained in the matches against both teams. Both teams attempted to blame the other for allowing the violence to get out of hand. Soviet official Anatoly Kastriukov blamed a Canadian trainer for igniting hostilities by running over to the Soviet bench and punching one of their assistant coaches in the stomach. The Canadians, meanwhile, pointed to Davydov being the first off the bench as being the spark that led to the brawl. CBC commentator Don Cherry was one of the first to float a conspiracy theory that the Soviets had done so as a deliberate attempt to have Canada ejected, and therefore lose a medal. Alan Eagleson suggested that the IIHF's decision would have been different had it been the Soviets in contention for a medal, and not the Canadians. Soviet administrator Yuri Korolev expressed regret that the incident occurred but did not admit any guilt. He felt that the game should have been finished instead of both teams being disqualified from the tournament. The IIHF voted to suspend all players involved from competing in international events for 18 months, and all coaches for three years. The player suspensions were later cut to six months, which allowed eligible players to participate in the 1988 tournament, and Alexander Mogilny to play in the 1988 Winter Olympics. The IIHF also considered either demoting both teams to the B pool or banning them from the 1988 tournament as further punishment, but backed off as the next year's tournament was set to be held in the Soviet Union, while Canada represented the only media revenue the tournament generated at the time. Among the Canadians, only two players were not suspended: goalie Jimmy Waite and forward Pierre Turgeon. One other Canadian Steve Nemeth was on the ice along with Waite, but neither threw a punch. Waite felt he could not risk being ejected for fighting under the belief that the game would resume, and that the Canadian backup goaltender, Shawn Simpson, was injured. Nemeth would later apply for early reinstatement arguing that he was not fighting, but trying to help break the players apart. Turgeon was the only Canadian who did not initially leave the bench until Canadian head coach Bert Templeton convinced him to go on the ice. Regarding not leaving the bench, Turgeon stated in 2017: \\"that wasn't my job. I didn't have to fight.\\" Many of their teammates never forgave Turgeon for failing to defend his teammates. In the words of Everett Sanipass: \\"I'm looking for someone to help (St√©phane) Roy out and I look over at the bench. There's this dog Turgeon, just sitting there, with his head down. He wouldn't get his ass off the bench ... just sitting there when everyone's off the Soviet bench and at least one of our guys is in real trouble getting double-teamed.\\" Legacy At the 1988 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Moscow, Canada and the Soviet Union won the gold and silver medals, respectively, as both teams' rosters featured several players from the 1987 tournament. Since the 1987 tournament, the two nations have maintained their dominance of the tournament. Canada has won 15 gold medals between 1988 and 2020, while the Soviet Union, and its successor, Russia, has won six. Hans R√∏nning's assignment to officiate the game was viewed by other on-ice officials as a nod to organizers from Lillehammer, Norway, who had just won the right to host the 1994 Winter Olympics and were observing the game. At age 38, R√∏nning expected the 1987 tournament to be among his last international assignments. R√∏nning never officiated another international game, though he did referee two more seasons in Norway before retiring. In Canada, public sentiment widely supported the players. Opinion polls taken in the aftermath of the brawl saw 87‚Äì92% of respondents supporting their actions. Don Cherry's passionate defence of the Canadian team led to a sharp increase in his popularity. Toronto Maple Leafs owner Harold Ballard had special gold medals made up for the Canadian team. Ballard stated that \\"I believe the Canadian boys deserve the gold medal and I'm going to see to it that they get them. Imagine how these Russians [sic] engineered this whole thing over there just because they've got a lousy team and were scared to go home finishing in sixth place.\\" Canadian hockey officials criticized the players for the brawl. In 2005, the suggestion of a reunion for the 1987 team was met with uncomfortable silence and \\"I don't think so\\" from Hockey Canada officials. Immediately following the tournament, Canadian officials were seen as trying to distance themselves from the team: \\"The CAHA (Canadian Amateur Hockey Association) didn't do anything for these kids\\", reporter Jim Cressman said. \\"These kids were good enough to make this team. They gave up their holidays, did their best, risked getting hurt and ended up on the wrong end of a bad decision - and the CAHA basically handed them their tickets.\\" Winnipeg Jets assistant general manager Mike Smith was in the Vienna airport while the Canadian juniors were waiting for their flight, and took the opportunity to criticize them for their play at the tournament as well as the brawl. Before Pie≈°≈•any, the junior tournament had a small following in Canada. Only one Canadian reporter flew overseas to cover the 1987 tournament. That changed in 1988, as the major Canadian media outlets all sent reporters to Moscow. The tournament's prestige in Canada continued to grow. By the 2005 tournament, over 100 Canadian reporters covered the tournament in Grand Forks, North Dakota. The brawl was seen as an embarrassment by Soviet officials who prided themselves on the discipline of their teams. A senior official, Anatoly Kostryukov, said that the \\"ice hockey department and the Ice Hockey Federation of the USSR will soon analyze the Soviet team's performance at the championship, and those guilty of the incident will be strictly punished\\". The Soviet media agency, Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, was highly critical of the coaching staff's inability to control the players. Head coach Vladimir Vasiliev was fired as the coach of the Soviet national junior team as a result of Pie≈°≈•any. Players Of the 20 players who dressed for Canada in that game, 19 went on to play in the National Hockey League. (Shawn Simpson was drafted by the Capitals, and dressed for two games for them, but ultimately only played for their associate team.) In 1987, only one Soviet had ever played in the NHL, Victor Nechayev. The players for this Soviet team would be among the first wave of Eastern Bloc players to arrive in the NHL with the fall of the Iron Curtain. Five of them would ultimately win the Stanley Cup. { CELLSPACING=\\"15\\" -----  VALIGN=\\"TOP\\"  ; Canada 1 ‚Äì Shawn Simpson, G 2 ‚Äì Greg Hawgood, D 3 ‚Äì Glen Wesley, D 4 ‚Äì Steve Chiasson, D 5 ‚Äì Chris Joseph, D 6 ‚Äì Kerry Huffman, D 8 ‚Äì Luke Richardson, D 9 ‚Äì Yvon Corriveau, F 10 ‚Äì Theoren Fleury, F 11 ‚Äì Mike Keane, F 12 ‚Äì Everett Sanipass, F 14 ‚Äì Dave McLlwain, F 15 ‚Äì Pat Elynuik, F 16 ‚Äì Scott Metcalfe, F 18 ‚Äì Brendan Shanahan, F 19 ‚Äì Steve Nemeth, F 20 ‚Äì Pierre Turgeon, F 21 ‚Äì St√©phane Roy, F 22 ‚Äì David Latta, F 30 ‚Äì Jimmy Waite, G  VALIGN=\\"TOP\\"  ; Soviet Union 1 ‚Äì Vadim Privalov, G 3 ‚Äì Dmitri Tsygurov, D 4 ‚Äì Andrei Smirnov, D 7 ‚Äì Igor Monayenkov, D 8 ‚Äì Alexander Mogilny, F 9 ‚Äì Sergei Fedorov, F 10 ‚Äì Valeri Zelepukin, F 11 ‚Äì Aleksandrs Kerƒçs, F 12 ‚Äì Dmitri Medvedev, F 15 ‚Äì Alexander Galchenyuk, F 16 ‚Äì Sergei Shesterikov, F 17 ‚Äì Anton Zagorodny, F 19 ‚Äì Valeri Popov, F 20 ‚Äì Valeri Ivannikov, G 21 ‚Äì Sergei Osipov, F 22 ‚Äì Evgeny Davydov, F 24 ‚Äì Vladimir Konstantinov, D 26 ‚Äì Vladimir Malakhov, D 27 ‚Äì Pavel Kostichkin, F 28 ‚Äì Vadim Musatov, D } See also *Fighting in ice hockey References  * External links *1987 CBC News report on the brawl Category:1987 in Czechoslovak sport Category:Brawls in team sports Category:Canada‚ÄìSoviet Union relations Category:1986‚Äì87 in Soviet ice hockey Category:1986‚Äì87 in Canadian ice hockey Category:World Junior Ice Hockey Championships Category:Politics and sports Category:Violence in ice hockey 1987 ","title":"Punch-up in Piestany"},{"id":"15093839","text":"A 1775 color triangle by Tobias Mayer. The sRGB color triangle, shown as a subset of x,y space, a chromaticity space based on CIE 1931 colorimetry A colour triangle is an arrangement of colours within a triangle, based on the additive combination of three primary colors at its corners. An additive colour space defined by three primary colors has a chromaticity gamut that is a color triangle, when the amounts of the primaries are constrained to be nonnegative. Before the theory of additive color was proposed by Thomas Young and further developed by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz, triangles were also used to organize colors, for example around a system of red, yellow, and blue primary colors. After the development of the CIE system, color triangles were used as chromaticity diagrams, including briefly with the trilinear coordinates representing the chromaticity values. Since the sum of the three chromaticity values has a fixed value, it suffices to depict only two of the three values, using Cartesian co-ordinates. In the modern x,y diagram, the large triangle bounded by the imaginary primaries X, Y, and Z has corners (1,0), (0,1), and (0,0), respectively; colour triangles with real primaries are often shown within this space. Maxwell's disc Maxwell was intrigued by James David Forbes's use of color tops. By rapidly spinning the top, Forbes created the illusion of a single color that was a mixture of the primaries: Maxwell took this a step further by using a circular scale around the rim with which to measure the ratios of the primaries, choosing vermilion (V), emerald (EG), and ultramarine (U). Initially, he compared the color he observed on the spinning top with a paper of different color, in order to find a match. Later, he mounted a pair of papers, snow white (SW) and ivory black (Bk), in an inner circle, thereby creating shades of gray. By adjusting the ratio of primaries, he matched the observed gray of the inner wheel, for example:James Clerk Maxwell (1855), Experiments on colour as perceived by the eye, with remarks on colour-blindness 0.37V+0.27U+0.36EG=0.28SW+0.72BK To determine the chromaticity of an arbitrary color, he replaced one of the primaries with a sample of the test color and adjusted the ratios until he found a match. For pale chrome (PC) he found 0.33PC+0.55U+0.12EG=0.37SW+0.63BK. Next, he rearranged the equation to express the test color (PC, in this example) in terms of the primaries. This would be the precursor to the color matching functions of the CIE 1931 color space, whose chromaticity diagram is shown above.

It is the motto of the Congregation of Holy Cross, Congregation of Holy Cross Web-site Edith Stein, and of Daniel Cardinal DiNardo, Archbishop of Galveston-Houston. It is found inscribed on the back of the Processional Crucifix in the Church of SS. Peter and Paul, in the village of Yattendon, Berkshsire, England. The inscription forms the shape of a cross with OCRVXAVE downward and SPESVNICA forming the cross piece.

One of two breweries selling Jax beer, along with Jacksonville's Jax Brewing Company, it was popularly known as the Jax Brewery. At its height, it was the largest brewery in the Southern United States. Its French Quarter building is now a historic landmark in New Orleans and houses restaurants, apartments, and entertainment venues. History 1940 photo of Jax signs in Melrose, Louisiana by Marion Post Wolcott The brewery was founded by Lawrence Fabacher in 1890 as Jackson Bohemian Brewery; its name was later changed to Jax Beer and finally Jackson Brewing Company, after Andrew Jackson and Jackson Square. It soon grew to be a prominent regional brewery and it, along with Dixie, were the only New Orleans breweries to survive Prohibition.Jackson Brewing Company (1890-1970) (2012). Tulane University Special Collections. Retrieved July 29, 2016. In 1935, Jackson Brewing Company entered a legal dispute with Jacksonville Brewing Company over the \\"Jax Beer\\" trademark, used by both companies. This resulted in a compromise in which Jacksonville Brewing Company got exclusive rights to sell in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, while Jackson Brewing got states to the west. Jackson Brewing expanded in the 1940s, as demand increased. In the 1950s, the company suffered competition from the growing national breweries. In 1954, it bought exclusive rights to the Jax trademark from the Jacksonville company, which ended brewing operations. This move made Jackson Brewing the 10th largest brewery in the U.S. and the largest in the South.

A self-complementary graph is a graph which is isomorphic to its complement. The simplest non-trivial self-complementary graphs are the 4-vertex path graph and the 5-vertex cycle graph. Examples Every Paley graph is self-complementary. For example, the 3 √ó 3 rook's graph (the Paley graph of order nine) is self-complementary, by a symmetry that keeps the center vertex in place but exchanges the roles of the four side midpoints and four corners of the grid.. All strongly regular self-complementary graphs with fewer than 37 vertices are Paley graphs; however, there are strongly regular graphs on 37, 41, and 49 vertices that are not Paley graphs.. The Rado graph is an infinite self-complementary graph.. See in particular Proposition 5. Properties An n-vertex self-complementary graph has exactly half number of edges of the complete graph, i.e., n(n ‚àí 1)/4 edges, and (if there is more than one vertex) it must have diameter either 2 or 3..

Anatomically, Minicrania bears a strong resemblance to the Yunnanolepiformids (i.e., Yunnanolepis and Chuchinolepis). However, other anatomical features, especially the head-width ratios, separate it from the Yunnanolepiformids. Zhu and Janvier regard it as the sister taxon of the sinolepids and the Euantiarchi (i.e., the bothriolepids and the asterolepids), representing a transitional form between the Euantiarchi and the more primitive Yunnanolepiformids. There are two recognized species. The type species, M. lirouyii, is found in Lochkovian-aged strata in Qujing, Yunnan, and is characterized by the presence of numerous tubercles covering the dermal surface of the armor. The specific name honors a Mr. Li Rou-yi, who assisted in collecting the first specimens. The second species, M. lissa, is found in Lochkovian deposits in northern Vietnam, near the Chinese border. M. lissa's tubercles are comparatively very small and ill-defined, if present, hence the specific epithet \\"lissa\\" meaning \\"smooth.\\" Otherwise, the armor is very similar, if not identical to that of M. lirouyi.

Description Kanawinka was declared Australia's First National Geopark in June 2008. It occupies a significant portion of a geological feature known as the Otway Basin (Douglas et al. 1988). Kanawinka Geopark has an area of about across two States and nine local government areas, with some 374 volcanic sites and many other significant geological sites and formations. It was deregistered from Geopark status in 2012. The term kanawinka is taken from the language of the Buandik aboriginal peoples, the traditional owners of the land and means \\"Land of Tomorrow\\". Buandik lands stretched along the coast in the far south of modern day South Australia and across to the Victorian border regions. The geological fault line which runs from the Naracoorte area down and across into Victoria is known as the Kanawinka Fault Line and the name was also given to a parish in the Casterton/Coleraine area. As it is important in the UNESCO assessment of granting Goepark status to link geology to culture and society the name Kanawinka was chosen to represent the connection of ancient culture, European settlement and the desire to educate through the Geopark status. The Otway Basin that hosts Kanawinka occupies the southern margin of South Australia and Victoria, and also has a significant portion located offshore. This basin formed when Australia rifted away from Gondwana (the southern supercontinent), which occurred about 95 million years ago (Drexel et al. 1993) . The sequence of sediments in the basin was deposited from Jurassic through to recent times. The South Australian portion of the Geopark lies in the Limestone Coast of the state, and adjoins the World Heritage area of Naracoorte Caves. The Victorian part lies in the Western Districts region of that state. Both areas are famous for their cheese, wine, forestry and rural industries. The eastern extremity of the Geopark in Victoria is located only about one hour's drive from the state capital city, Melbourne. At the Victorian/ South Australian Border the distance is about four and a half to five hours drive from Melbourne. In the South Australian section it is located four to five hours' drive from that state‚Äôs capital of Adelaide. Volcanic activity in Victoria younger than 7 million years is known as the Newer Volcanics Province or Newer basalts. The activity in Kanawinka Geopark falls into this category. Most of the volcanism is estimated to have taken place from about 5 million years before present (B.P.) to around 5,000 years ago. Included are 6 sites of International Significance, 14 of National significance along with many of state, regional and local significance. (Geological Survey of Australia Victorian Division and the Standing Committee on Geoheritage, National Estate listings 1980). The region varies from volcanic basalt plains dotted with eruption points through to limestone caves and crater lakes to the ‚ÄòTerra Rosa‚Äô of the Coonawarra, with its wonderful wines. The basalt plains of Western Victoria are listed in the top 6 in the World for extent and complexity, and the Blue Lake of Mount Gambier is of International significance with its unique colour change each year. (Sheard, M. 1978) The Kanawinka Geopark Board was a community-based organization funded by seven of the nine local government areas and was the driving factor in the Geopark proposal. It held support of Tourism Victoria, South Australian Tourism Commission, The National Trust and the Geological Society of Australia along with the Management bodies of the Sites of Significance of the region. However the group has now disbanded.

In the past it was also recorded in the southeastern Atlantic, including South Africa, but this was caused by confusion with close relatives; C. africana, C. fulgida and an undescribed species tentatively referred to as \\"C. agulhensis\\". It is a true jellyfish displaying radial symmetry with distinct brown markings shaped like elongated V's on its bell. C. hysoscella adults are highly susceptible to the parasite Hyperia medusarum but this hasn't had any significant effects on the population. This organism has a benthic polyp stage before developing into a pelagic adult medusae. Compass jellyfish consume a variety of marine invertebrates and plankton and are preyed on by very few. C. hysoscella contribute to the global issue of jellyfish overpopulation which is concerning to humans for various reasons including recreational interference, economic turmoil for fishing communities, and depleted fish resources. Body plan As an adult, the bell of the compass jellyfish typically has a diameter of . It usually has 16 brown elongated V-shaped markings on the translucent yellow- white bell. The markings surround a central brown spot and resemble the face of a compass, hence the common name compass jellyfish. It is usually colored yellowish white, with some brown. Its 24 tentacles are arranged in eight groups of three. Each tentacle has stinging cells for capturing prey and defense from predators. A sense organ is located between each group of tentacles, which can perceive changes in light and helps the jellyfish determine and maintain its position in the water column. It has 4 oral arms that can be distinguished from the tentacles because the arms are noticeably longer and have a folded, frilly appearance. These arms are used to facilitate transfer of captured prey from the tentacles to the mouth which is between the oral arms at the center of the underside of the bell. Habitat Chrysaora hysoscella in Vancouver Aquarium Video of the Chrysaora hysoscella (compass jellyfish) from the Monterey Bay Aquarium The compass jellyfish is found in coastal waters of the northeast Atlantic, including the Celtic, Irish, North and Mediterranean Seas. They inhabit these waters mostly at the top of the water column, and although they inhabit shallow water, they move up and down in the water column often ranging from surface waters to just above the seabed. They are rarely found deeper than 30 m from the surface. Feeding and predation Compass jellyfish are carnivores, consuming other marine invertebrates and plankton. They feed on a variety of benthic and pelagic organisms including but not limited to: dinoflagellates, copepods, crustacean eggs, larval fish, and chaetognaths. They stun and capture their prey with stinging cells on their tentacles. The oral arms facilitate movement of captured prey into the oral opening. Compass jellyfish have very few predators. They are known to be consumed by the leatherback sea turtle and ocean sunfish.Jones, Georgina. A field guide to the marine animals of the Cape Peninsula. SURG, Cape Town, 2008. Life cycle Like other Scyphozoans, Chrysaora hysoscella undergo metamorphosis as the organism develops and experiences a polyp and then medusa form. Females release planular larvae which swim to find a suitable place to settle. The planulae attach to a benthic substrate and develop into a sessile polyp which releases immature medusae through asexual reproduction called strobilation. Chrysaora hysoscella function as a male upon maturity and then develop female gametes, meaning this organism is protandrously hermaphroditic. Reproduction Chrysaora hysoscella utilize both sexual and asexual reproduction throughout development. Mature individuals reproduce sexually by broadcast spawning. Males release sperm from their mouths into the water column. Females fertilize the sperm internally and can fertilize sperm from multiple male partners. The larvae released from the female settle as benthic polyps that reproduce asexually. The polyps release multiple ephyrae through strobilation. Ephyrae are the earliest form of the medusa stage. Research indicates that Chrysaora hysoscella polyps are capable of releasing ephyrae over time and therefore are not limited to a single reproductive event. Parasite Hyperia medusarum Adult Chrysaora hysoscella are often parasitised by Hyperia medusarum. C. hysoscella found inshore and closer to the surface are more likely to have the parasite. The parasite can be found inside of the body cavity in the umbrella and gonads but tends to move from umbrella to gonads if there is space for them there. The gonads are more enriched in carbon and protein content then any other part of the body, making this region the ideal location to settle and feed. They have also been found on the oral arms of the jellyfish where they can eat prey caught by the medusae. Effects of global warming Scyphozoa populations are increasing with the warming climate and warmer ocean temperatures. Studies suggest that warmer winter temperatures allow for a longer strobilation period and subsequently higher ephyra production per polyp, higher percentages of polyp strobilation, and higher polyp survival rate. Polyps will be more successful in warmer temperatures but not in extreme temperatures. C. hysoscella are predicted to migrate further northwards to maintain ideal conditions. =Impact= Thriving jellyfish populations have been found to take over as top predators in areas that fin fish have been over-exploited. Increased abundance of jellyfish negatively impacts fish populations in the same region because jellyfish feed on fish eggs and larvae. Jellyfish and larval fish can also share common dietary preferences. Competition for food resources can result in depleted fish populations. Overpopulation of jellyfish is a concern to humans for many reasons. Jellyfish stings are painful and sometimes deadly to humans. Fishing nets can be overwhelmed with jellyfish bycatch or torn by jellyfish caught in the nets. Jellyfish can clog water inlets to power plants, causing serious problems for power production. Jellyfish can invade aquaculture cages, ruining the production of the organism being farmed.

Rabbinical career After graduating from the gymnasium, Lehmann studied in Halberstadt under Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer. He then went to Berlin University, and thence to Prague, to continue his theological and secular studies. He was graduated Ph.D. from the University of Halle. In 1853 the congregation of Mainz, when building its new temple, provided for the introduction of an organ.Rothschild, Jacob (2007). \\"Lehmann, Marcus.\\" Encyclopaedia Judaica. 2nd ed. Edited by Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA. Vol. 12, p. 616\\\\. Retrieved 2018-02-28 via Gale Virtual Reference Library. Those of the members who were opposed to this innovation organized a Religionsgesellschaft (private religious society‚Äîit was illegal to form a new community until 1871), which in 1854 extended to Lehmann a call as rabbi and preacher. He accepted the position and remained with the congregation until his death. In 1856 he dedicated a new synagogue, which the congregation owed mostly to his efforts (this was replaced in 1879), and he founded a religious school which in 1859 was developed into a Jewish school where both religious and secular studies were taught. Literary career With the establishment of the Israelit, Lehmann attained a high position as one of the leaders of the movement for the maintenance of Orthodox Judaism in Germany. In 1860 Ludwig Philippson's Allgemeine Zeitung des Judenthums was practically the only Jewish periodical exerting a profound influence in extending the ideas of the Reform party. In May of that year the Israelit made its appearance, and from the outset it acquired a great reputation and wide circulation. In the course of time it absorbed the Jeschurun (the periodical edited by Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch) and assumed the title of Israelit und Jeschurun, which paper, after the death of Lehmann, was continued under the editorial care of his son Oskar Lehmann, who for a number of years had been a member of its staff. Lehmann was known as a prolific writer of short stories, most of them being first published in his paper. They afterward appeared collectively as Vergangenheit und Gegenwart, 6 vols., Frankfort-on-the-Main, 1872-88. Lehmann wrote also many novels, including: Rabbi Josselmann of Rosheim, 2 vols., ib. 1879-80, The Royal Resident (a biography of his ancestor Rabbi Issachar Berend Lehmann), and Akiba (biography of Rabbi Akiva based on Talmudic and classical sources). Of his other writings may be mentioned: ‚ÄúBustenai‚Äù; \\"Die Orgel in der Synagoge\\", Mayence, 1862; \\"Die Abschaffung des Kol Nidre, und Herr Dr. Aub in Mainz,\\" Mayence, 1863; and \\"Der Talmud Jeruschalmi.

The beetle's head and leg-bearing thorax are minuscule relative to its large abdomen. This part of the body is bent back towards the anterior (head) end, covering the rest of its body. It is the abdomen alone which is visible from above, providing a deceptive 'umbrella' that looks like a termite. The rear end thus acts as the termite 'head', and its appendages (legs and antennae) are composed of moving flaps attached to the abdomen's upper side. Although the mimicry is not as convincing as that of other mimics, such as the ant mimic Labidus praedator, the evolution of the resemblance is certainly remarkable considering the changes required. In Climbing Mount Improbable, Richard Dawkins describes this imitation as \\"one of the most astonishing spectacles in all natural history.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Category:Staphylinidae Category:Parasitic insects Category:Parasites of insects ","title":"Coatonachthodes ovambolandicus"},{"id":"15093988","text":"√ó Asconopsis, abbreviated Ascps. in the horticultural trade, is an intergeneric hybrid between the orchid genera Ascocentrum and Phalaenopsis (Asctm x Phal).

The site is a deeply stratified site, at which archaeologists have located nine complexes ranging dating from approximately 6500BC to AD1700. The site has been of critical benefit for the study of Arctic cultures, and is used to determine the cultural chronology of the region. The district was added to the National Register of Historical Places in 1972 and and was declared a National Historic Landmark District in 1978. Setting The Onion Portage site is located on the northern banks of the Kobuk River. Above the site is a sandy knoll, from which material is washed onto the site from deeply eroded gullies. Archaeological history The Onion Portage site was first identified by the pioneering Arctic archaeologist J. Louis Giddings in 1940, during his first visit to the Kobuk River. He returned to the site in 1941, at which time some house pits were excavated, but the site's potential was not fully known. After World War II Giddings focused his efforts on other areas (notably the Iyatayet Site and sites at Cape Krusenstern, both also National Historic Landmarks, where he began to assemble a chronology of Arctic cultures. In 1961 he visited the site again, at which time its highly stratified nature was discovered. Giddings led a major excavation at the site in 1964, the last year of his life, seeking evidence of older cultures in the many layers of deposits. The only built structure to be included in the district is the Giddings Cabin, used by J. Louis Giddings during the 1964 excavation. The National Park Service has preserved the cabin.

It is one of the better-known species of the genus Digitaria, and one that is known nearly worldwide as a common weed. It is used as animal fodder, and the seeds are edible and have been used as a grain in Germany and especially Poland, where it is sometimes cultivated.Georgia, Ada E. 1914. A Manual of Weeds. The Macmillan Company. Digitaria sanguinalis section This has earned it the name Polish millet.Polish millet - Merriam- Webster Online Description It is an annual grass with an inflorescence of up to nine very long, very thin, radiating branches atop its stems. Each branch is lined with pairs of very tiny spikelets. The inflorescences may be reddish or purplish. Image:Digitaria sanguinalis.jpg Image:Harig_vingergras_detail_plant_(Digitaria_sanguinalis).jpg Image:Harig vingergras ligula (Digitaria sanguinalis).jpg Image:Digitaria sanguinalis inflorescence.jpg Uses During the European Middle Ages, Digitaria sanguinalis was cultivated by Slavic peoples in Eastern Europe, where it was cooked in soups and porridges. The plant was brought to the United States by immigrants to serve as hand-foraged grain. The grass is also highly nutritious, especially before the plant exhausts itself producing seed. It is frequently sown in fields to provide graze for animals, or clipped and bundled as hay. Compared to other grasses, it has a relatively high protein percentage. Farmers will sometimes till patches in their pastures in the late spring, with the intent of encouraging crabgrass seed. For human consumption, crabgrass necessarily must be harvested by hand, because it produces grain throughout summer, rather than simultaneously. Machine harvesting would require monthly passes, and even then much of the seed would go to waste. Crabgrass produces an exceptionally high amount of grain, it smothers other weeds, it acts as its own mulch, and it can survive both heat and drought. Its adaptability makes it a candidate for environmental small-farming. Control Its usefulness to nineteenth-century homesteaders has made its seed widespread, and today is generally considered an unattractive nuisance. Crabgrass takes advantage of low fertility and drought, since this tends to weaken other grasses and it tends to invade manicured turf. It is difficult to kill, as it will regenerate, and chemicals will likely harm surrounding grasses. As an annual, it can be controlled by preemergent herbicides. The most efficient means of control is to pull patches, and keep the rest of the lawn watered and mowed at a height of two-three inches.Digitaria sanguinalis - Cabi See also *Digitaria compacta, raishan, used as a grain crop in northeast India *Digitaria exilis, white fonio, used as a crop in West Africa *Digitaria iburua, black fonio, used as a crop in West Africa ReferencesExternal links *Jepson Manual Treatment *Grass Manual Treatment *PIER Worldwide Profile * sanguinalis Category:Grasses of Europe ","title":"Digitaria sanguinalis"},{"id":"15094118","text":"SS California was the World's first major ocean liner built with turbo- electric transmission. When launched in 1927 she was also the largest merchant ship yet built in the US, although she was a modest size compared with the biggest European liners of her era. In 1938 California was renamed SS Uruguay. From 1942 to 1946 she was operated through agents by the War Shipping Administration as the troopship Uruguay. She was returned to civilian service as SS Uruguay in 1948, laid up in 1954 and scrapped in 1964. Building California was the first of three sister ships built by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia for the Panama Pacific Lines, a subsidiary of American Line Steamship Corporation which was a part of J. P. Morgan's International Mercantile Marine Coompany. California was the largest American built passenger liner at the time. The ship's keel was laid 20 March 1926 as hull number 325, launched on 1 October 1927 and delivered to American Line on 13 January 1928. Mrs. Roland Palmedo, wife of the businessman Roland Palmedo and daughter of the president of International Mercantile Marine, sponsored the launch. The ship left New York for the Pacific Coast on 28 January 1928 to begin the regular route between the coasts by way of the Panama Canal. Californias sister SS Virginia was and the third of the trio, Pennsylvania, was . All three sisters entered the fleet Panama Pacific Lines. California was a steamship, with oil-fired furnaces heating her boilers to power two steam turbo generators that ran at a constant 2,800 RPM. These supplied current to her -high electric propulsion motors, which had a combined rating of 2,833 NHP or 17,000 shp. The turbo-generators and propulsion motors were built by General Electric, which was the world pioneer of turbo-electric propulsion, having supplied the turbo-generators and electric motors for , the World's first turbo-electric ship, a decade earlier. California was equipped with submarine signalling apparatus and wireless direction finding equipment, and from about 1934 she was equipped with a gyrocompass. Californias first class accommodation was air conditioned and some first class cabins had en suite bathrooms. With Panama Pacific Lines, Californias two funnels would have been red with a blue top, with a white band dividing the blue from the red. SS California Panama Pacific Line, part of the American Line Steamship Corp, operated California and her sisters between New York and San Francisco via the Panama Canal until 1938. California, Virginia and Pennsylvania were subsidised to carry mail on this route for the United States Postal Service. San Francisco to New York \\"Farewell Dinner\\" on board SS California Oct 10, 1936 In March 1936 an unofficial strike aboard California in port at San Pedro, Los Angeles, held without the sanction of the International Seamen's Union, led to the foundation of the National Maritime Union. The dispute was about wage rates and overtime payments. The strike lasted only three days but Panama Pacific never fully recovered from it. In June 1937 the United States Congress withdrew all maritime mail subsidies, which by then included a total of $450,000 per year for Panama Pacific's three liners. At the beginning of March 1938 the Panama Canal tolls were revised, increasing Panama Pacific's costs by $37,000 per year. As a result of these cost increases and continuing labor difficulties Panama Pacific discontinued its New York ‚Äì California service and took all three liners out of service. California was the last to leave service, joining Pennsylvania and Virginia in New York at the beginning of May 1938. SS Uruguay On 10 June 1938 the United States Maritime Commission (MC) purchased the ship, made repairs and placed it under an operating agreement with Moore McCormack Line 13 January 1939. The MC operating agreement continued until 30 January 1942 when the operation of commercial type ships was turned over to the War Shipping Administration which then continued the operating agreement with Moore McCormack until 9 July 1946. In 1938 Newport News Shipbuilding drydocked and extensively refurbished California as hull 377. New propellers were fitted. All three sisters were fireproofed to comply with Federal safety regulations, which had been revised as a result of the fire in 1934 that destroyed the liner . Californias state rooms were improved, her air conditioning was extended to her tourist class accommodation, a new swimming pool was installed, and her after deck was rebuilt with the addition of a veranda caf√©. California had been built with two funnels but during the refit this was reduced to one. The refit increased Californias tonnage by about 2,000 tons. On 4 October 1938 Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., contracted to operate California, Virginia, Pennsylvania and 10 cargo ships between the US and South America as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy. Moore-McCormack renamed the three passenger liners Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and assigned them to the fleet of its American Republics Lines subsidiary. On 17 January Uruguay became the first of the three sisters to depart from New York on Moore-McCormack's service to and from Buenos Aires via the Caribbean, Brazil and Montevideo. With Moore-McCormack Lines Californias funnel would have been buff with a black top. A broad green band divided the buff from the black. On each side of the funnel the green band bore a red capital M within a white disk. Troop ship When the USA entered the Second World War, Uruguay the War Shipping Administration (WSA) took over all ocean transport operations and had the ship converted into a troop ship. The work was carried out from 2 January 1942 to 1 March 1942, and included the installation of a hospital. The ship, a large and fast vessel capable of independent voyages without escort, was operated by WSA agents and allocated in support of Army troop transport requirements with a passenger capacity of 4,473.The previous reference, Troopships of World War II, has a detailed list of voyages with dates, departure and destination points. On 3 March 1942 Uruguay sailed from Brooklyn, New York carrying US troops. She sailed via the Panama Canal and Bora Bora, reaching Auckland, New Zealand on 9 April. She then sailed Melbourne, Australia and back to New Zealand. She left Wellington Harbour on 28 April carrying Royal New Zealand Air Force cadets, and arrived in San Francisco, California on 14 May. On 26 May Uruguay sailed from San Francisco carrying US troops, reaching Auckland on 12 June. On 6 August 1942 Uruguay left Brooklyn carrying the USAAF 301st Bombardment Group. She sailed via Halifax, Nova Scotia and Gourock, Scotland to Swansea, Wales, arriving on 25 August. In October and November 1942 Uruguay carried troops via Gibraltar to Oran, French Algeria in Operation Torch, the invasion of Vichy French North Africa. On 12 December 1942 she sailed from New York again with troops to Casablanca, French Morocco. Oil tanker , which accidentally rammed Uruguay on 12 February 1943 On 8 February 1943 Uruguay sailed from New York with 5,000 troops bound for the UK. On 12 February 1943 in the North Atlantic the oil tanker suffered a steering fault and accidentally rammed Uruguay amidships. The tanker's bow made a hole in Uruguays hull and penetrated her hospital, killing 13 soldiers and injuring 50. One injured soldier, Sergeant Cecil Davis, landed on the tanker's deck, where he was not discovered until Salamonie had changed course to Bermuda for repairs. Uruguays crew contained the damage by building a temporary bulkhead and three days later she reached harbor, also in Bermuda. President Franklin D. Roosevelt decorated Uruguays Master, Captain Albert Spaulding, with the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal for saving many lives, his ship and her cargo. Uruguay was out of service for three months for repairs. On 15 May 1943 she left New York, heading via the Panama Canal to Brisbane, Australia. On 3 August she sailed from Los Angeles for Fremantle, Australia and Bombay, India. She crossed the Equator on 9 August, the International Date Line on 17 August and reached Bombay on 10 September. On 18 November Uruguay left Los Angeles. She called at Hobart, Tasmania on 6 December and reached Bombay on 26 December. Uruguay spent most of 1944 and the first half of 1945 crossing and re-crossing the North Atlantic. On 5 February she left New York for Liverpool, England. On 7 April she left Boston for Liverpool and the Firth of Clyde. On 12 May she left New York for the Clyde and Liverpool. On 3 July she left Boston for Liverpool. On 11 August she left New York for the Clyde. On 20 September she left New York for the River Mersey. On 30 October she left New York for an unrecorded destination in the United Kingdom. In November and December 1944 Uruguay took all the cadets of the West Point Military Academy from New York to Baltimore and back for the annual Army‚ÄìNavy football game on 2 December. Three destroyers escorted Uruguay and the convoy kept close to shore because of the threat of German U-boats. The inshore voyage was rough and all the cadets were seasick, but their team beat the Navy 23‚Äì7. On 9 December Uruguay left New York for Southampton, England. On 10 January 1945 she left Boston for the Solent, England and Le Havre, France. On 27 February she left New York for Le Havre and Southampton. On 8 April she left New York for Southampton. On 19 May 1945 Uruguay left New York for Livorno, Italy. From Livorno she sailed via Gibraltar and the Panama Canal to Manila, Leyte, Honolulu and then San Francisco. On 22 September she left San Francisco and returned to Manila. On 22 November she left San Pedro for Yokohama. On 17 January 1946 Uruguay left San Francisco for Manila and Yokohama. On 15 February 1946 she left Yokohama carrying European diplomats and dignitaries whom Japan had detained during the Second World War, and wounded US soldiers. She sailed via the Panama Canal and took her European evacuees to Southampton. On 20 April 1946 Uruguay left New York for Le Havre. On 15 May 1946 she left New York for Southampton and Le Havre. In US Army service Uruguay carried a total of more than 200,000 US troops. Post-war On 25 June 1946 Uruguay reverted to the Maritime Commission and Federal Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Kearny, New Jersey was awarded a $4,437,000 contract to convert her back into an ocean liner. On 23 June 1947 she entered Todd Shipyards' No. 1 Graving Dock. Her hull was sand-blasted to bare metal, 87 of her steel plates and 85,000 rivets were replaced before she was repainted. Work was delayed by a shipyard workers' strike but were completed on 6 September. Uruguay was extensively modernised and her interior was completely restyled in a restrained style designed by William F Schorn, who at the same time designed the new interior of her sister ship . On 23 January 1948 Uruguay left Todd Shipyards for an 18-hour sea trial, and the next day the Maritime Commission restored her to Moore- McCormack Lines. Captain Spaulding resumed command and on 30 January Uruguay started a nine-day Caribbean cruise to Nassau and Havana. On 10 February 1948 Uruguay was given the US Navy Reserve pennant and her library was dedicated in memory of Thomas K Locke, a Moore-McCormack employee who died on active service as an infantry captain in the Second World War. On 12 February Uruguay sailed from New York on the Buenos Aires run for the first time since 1941. On 17 June 1951 Albert Spaulding retired, having spent the last decade of his career in command of Uruguay. Captain Howard F Lane succeeded him. On her first voyage under Lane's command, Uruguay achieved her fastest time from Rio de Janeiro to Trinidad, covering the distance in six days, 14 hours and 42 minutes and averaging . On 8 August 1952 about out of New York Uruguay struck a submerged object that damaged and disabled one of her propellers. This caused excessive vibration, so she diverted to Newport News for the propeller to be repaired. Moore-McCormack deemed Uruguay to be the least efficient of the three sister ships, so in 1954 the company withdrew her from service. She completed her last South American voyage when she docked in the North River in New York on 29 March 1954. Tugboat crews were on strike at the time so Uruguay docked unaided. She was transferred to the US Federal Government and was laid up as part of the James River Reserve Fleet at Fort Eustis, Virginia. Late in 1963 the United States Department of Commerce offered Uruguay for sale. In 1964 she was sold to the North American Smelting Co of Wilmington, Delaware for scrap. Notable passengers In October 1935 the California politician William A. Sutherland died of a heart attack aboard California. In 1939 Carmen Miranda left Brazil aboard Uruguay to start her career in the USA. She arrived in New York on 18 May. In 1940 Leopold Stokowski and his All-American Youth Orchestra toured South America, and recorded native Brazilian music aboard Uruguay. In February 1943 the American Football coach Bear Bryant was en route to North Africa aboard Uruguay on the voyage when USS Salamonie accidentally rammed her. In November and December 1944 Bernie Abrams, Doc Blanchard, Glenn Davis, Alexander Haig and Brent Scowcroft were among the West Point Cadets who sailed from New York to Baltimore and back aboard Uruguay. In 1948 the golfer Henry Cotton sailed on Uruguay to South America. In 1950 the novelist Taylor Caldwell sailed on Uruguay.

She is currently a professor of physics at the University of Texas at Austin, where she holds the Jeff and Gail Kodosky Endowed Chair in Physics. She is known for her work in theoretical cosmology at the interface of particle physics and astrophysics. Education and Academic Career Freese received her BA from Princeton University, one of the first women to major in physics at Princeton. She obtained her MA from Columbia University, and her PhD at the University of Chicago from advisor David Schramm. After postdoctoral fellowships at Harvard University, at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics at University of California, Santa Barbara, and as a Presidential Fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, she became an Assistant Professor at MIT. She moved to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where she was the George E. Uhlenbeck Professor of Physics. From 2007-2014 she was Associate Director of the Michigan Center for Theoretical Physics. In September 2014, she assumed the position of Director of Nordita, the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics, in Stockholm, and held a position as Visiting Professor of Physics at Stockholm University. In 2019, Freese moved to the University of Texas at Austin, where she holds the Jeff and Gail Kodosky Endowed Chair in Physics. Contributions Freese has contributed to early research on dark matter and dark energy. She was one of the first to propose ways to discover dark matter. Her idea of indirect detection in the Earth is being pursued by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory experiment, and the \\"wind\\" of dark matter particles felt as the Earth orbits the Milky Way (work with David Spergel) is being searched for in worldwide experiments. Her work decisively ruled out MACHO (Massive compact halo object) dark matter in favor of WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles).James Glanz, New York Times, Feb. 2000, , \\"In the Dark Matter Wars, WIMPs beat MACHOs\\", She has proposed a model known as \\"Cardassian expansion,\\" in which dark energy is replaced with a modification of Einstein's equations.Dennis Overbye, New York Times, Nov. 2003, , \\"What is Gravity, Really?\\" Recently she proposed a new theoretical type of star, called a dark star, powered by dark matter annihilation rather than fusion. Freese has also worked on the beginnings of the universe, including the search for a successful inflationary theory to kick off the Big Bang. Her natural inflation model is a theoretically well-motivated variant of inflation; it uses axionic-type particles to provide the required flat potentials to drive the expansion. In 2013, observations made by the European Space Agency's Planck Satellite show that the framework of natural inflation matches the data. She has studied the Ultimate fate of the universe, including the fate of life in the universe.Philip Ball, , \\"Never Say Die\\", New Scientist, Aug. 2002\\" Freese has served on the Board of the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara and the Board of the Aspen Center for Physics. From 2008-2012 she was a Councilor and Member of the Executive Committee of the American Physical Society, and from 2005-2008 she was a member of the Astronomy and Astrophysics Advisory Committee (AAAC). Currently she serves on the Board of the Oskar Klein Centre for Cosmoparticle Physics in Stockholm.  Honors  Freese was elected Fellow of the American Physical Society in 2009. She received a Simons Foundation Fellowship in Theoretical Physics in 2012. In September 2012, Freese was awarded an Honorary Doctorate (Honoris Causa) from the University of Stockholm. She was awarded the 2019 Julius Edgar Lilienfeld Prize from the American Physical Society \\"For ground-breaking research at the interface of cosmology and particle physics, and her tireless efforts to communicate the excitement of physics to the general public.\\" In 2020 she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Personal life Freese was born in Freiburg, Germany, to Ernst Freese and Elisabeth Bautz Freese. At age nine months she emigrated to the United States. From her ten year marriage to Fred Adams she has a son, Douglas Quincy Adams. Her brother Andrew Freese, Chief of Neurosurgery at Brandywine Hospital, resides in Chester Springs, PA. Her uncle Ekkehard Bautz, now retired, was a molecular biologist and chair of the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the University of Heidelberg. Her cousin Anja Freese, a German actor, currently resides in Los Angeles. Popular science Freese has written a review for the general educated public on dark matter and energy as they relate to recent research in cosmology and particle physics, titled The Cosmic Cocktail: Three Parts Dark Matter (Science Essentials, 2014, ). The book is partly autobiographical.

R is an alkyl chain of variable length, which may be saturated or unsaturated. Anacardic acids are phenolic lipids, chemical compounds found in the shell of the cashew nut (Anacardium occidentale). An acid form of urushiol, they also cause an allergic skin rash on contact, known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis. Anacardic acid is a yellow liquid. It is partially miscible with ethanol and ether, but nearly immiscible with water. Chemically, anacardic acid is a mixture of several closely related organic compounds. Each consists of a salicylic acid substituted with an alkyl chain that has 15 or 17 carbon atoms. The alkyl group may be saturated or unsaturated; anacardic acid is a mixture of saturated and unsaturated molecules. The exact mixture depends on the species of the plant. The 15-carbon unsaturated side chain compound found in the cashew plant is lethal to Gram-positive bacteria. Folk use for tooth abscesses, it is also active against acne, some insects, tuberculosis, and MRSA. It is primarily found in foods such as cashew nuts, cashew apples, and cashew nutshell oil, but also in mangos and Pelargonium geraniums. Experimental antibacterial properties The side chain with three unsaturated bonds was the most active against Streptococcus mutans, the tooth decay bacterium, in test tube experiments. The number of unsaturated bonds was not material against Cutibacterium acnes, the acne bacterium. Eichbaum claims that a solution of one part anacardic acid to 200,000 parts water to as low as one part in 2,000,000 is lethal to Gram-positive bacteria in 15 minutes in vitro. Somewhat higher ratios killed tubercle bacteria of tuberculosis in 30 minutes.Eichbaum FW 1946 Biological properties of anacardic acid (O- pentadeca dienylsalicylic acid) and related compounds. General discussion-bactericidal action. ¬´Mem√≥rias do Instituto Butantan¬ª, 19, pp. 71-86. Heating these anacardic acids converts them to the alcohols (cardanols) with reduced activity compared to the acids. Decarboxylation, such as through heating done in most commercial oil processing, results in compounds with significantly reduced activity.Patel NM Patel MS 1936 Cashew-nut shell oil and a study of the changes produced in the oil by the action of heat. Journal of the University of Bombay, Science: Physical Sciences, Mathematics, Biological Sciences, Medicine 5 (pt2) 114-131. It is said that the people of the Gold Coast (now Ghana) use cashew leaves and bark for a toothache.http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/Anacardium_occidentale.html#Folk%20Medicine Cashew plants in folk medicine. Industrial uses Anacardic acid is the main component of cashew nutshell liquid (CNSL), and finds use in the chemical industry for the production of cardanol, which is used for resins, coatings, and frictional materials. Cardanol is used to make phenalkamines, which are used as curing agents for the durable epoxy coatings used on concrete floors. History The first chemical analysis of the oil of the cashew nut shell from the Anacardium occidentale was published in 1847. It was later found to be a mixture rather than one chemical, sometimes the plural anacardic acids is used. Synergies Anacardic acid is synergistic with anethole from the seed of anise (Umbelliferae) and linalool from green tea in vitro [Muroi & Kubo, p1782]. The totarol in the bark of Podocarpus trees is synergistic with anacardic acid in its bactericidal effects. Other and potential uses There is also a suspicion that inhibiting anacardic acids may arrest the growth of cancer tumors such as breast cancer. [Kubo et al., 1993] Anacardic acid (2-hydroxy-6-alkylbenzoic acid) provides resistance to small pest insects (aphids and spider mites). Anacardic acid kills methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cells more rapidly than totarol.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 3 Aug. 2014 Life An account of her life was written, in both medieval Latin and the Italian vernacular, by a Brother Alberto of the church of the Holy Spirit (S. Spirito). She was born at the Castello Estense, the seat of her family's power. About her youth Alberto wrote: {:Passoe li anni de la sua adolescentia in pompe et fauori del seculo: in delitte de la sua carne, in ornamenti et uanitate de diuerse facte come √® usanza di nobile femina et seculare.  :She passed the years of her adolescence in the pomp and appearances of the age: in delights of the flesh, in ornamentation and vanity of diverse fabrication, as is typical of noble, secular women. } She became the object of the courtly love of Rambertino Buvalelli, a Bolognese troubadour who traveled widely in northern Italy. In nine of his cansos Rambertino celebrates the beauty and character of Beatrice, whom he frequently calls by the senhal (a \\"sign\\", as in a nickname) Mon Restaur (\\"My Refreshment\\" in Occitan). The relationship between Rambertino and the young Beatrice was purely poetic, lyric, and musical. Beatrice became a Benedictine nun at Solarola near Padua at the age of fourteen, and in 1221 founded a religious house at the site of an abandoned monastery in Gemmola, formerly inhabited by hermits. In the 17th century it was turned into villa by a Venetian merchant. Today the Villa Beatrice d'Este houses a nature museum.Villa Beatrice d'Este Gemola Villa Beatrice d'Este Sant'Antonio in Polesine Cloister of Sant'Antonio in Polesine The name \\"in Polesine\\" does not refer to the area of Polesine, but to its original situation, high ground surrounded by water.

It has been the subject of negative publicity throughout its history, including accusations of trademark infringement, tax avoidance and inefficient fundraising practices. It was named \\"the worst charity in the nation\\" in a 2013 review of charities with wasteful spending practices. In 2012, of the $18.6 million the Kids Wish Network raised, only $240,000 was spent on granting wishes, which represents less than one percent of the money donated. Background Wrestler John Cena during a wish granted in 2009 The Kids Wish Network was founded in 1997 as the \\"Fulfill a Wish Foundation\\" by Mark Breiner, his wife Shelley Breiner and Shelley's mother Barbara Askin in honor of Shelley's father, who died of cancer in 1993. In 1998, the company's name was changed to \\"Kids Wish Network\\" as part of a settlement after the Make-A-Wish Foundation sued the organization on the premise that it had a confusingly similar name. The organization's beneficiaries are children between the ages of 3 and 18 who have overcome life-altering circumstances, often enduring a great deal of pain and suffering. In 2004, it had granted 143 wishes and in 2013 it granted 800 wishes. But in other cases, parents have accused the organization of exploiting their children to generate money without actually providing any benefit to the child.. Some of its wishes have been granted by celebrities such as musician Brad Paisley, professional wrestler John Cena, R&B; artist Keyshia Cole, NFL coach Jon Gruden, country singer Taylor Swift, and the Green Bay Packers. Fundraising In 2008, Charity Navigator gave Kids Wish Network zero out of four stars in its \\"efficiency rating\\" based on how much money is spent on fundraising in comparison to charitable activities. The American Institute of Philanthropy also gave it a failing \\"F\\" grade. Kids Wish Network claimed the fundraising spending was needed for new non-profits to develop a donor base. A Charity Navigator spokesperson alleged the Kids Wish Network was taking advantage of tax loopholes for non-profits by counting some of its fundraising activities as charity work and that it had the highest percent of funds spent on fundraising out of all 24 wish-granting charities. Representatives of the charity said comparing them to other wish-granting services was unfair, since they also provide funeral services and other services. Kids Wish Network has received higher marks in other areas, for example receiving four stars for organizational capacity the prior year. America's worst charities (2013) In 2012 the Tampa Bay Times, CNN and the Center for Investigative Reporting undertook a year long joint investigation of \\"America's Worst Charities\\" which ranked Kids Wish Network at the top of the list of the worst charities in the United States. based on percentage of money collected from donors that was paid to corporate telemarketing solicitors from 2003 to 2013.

CNN joined the partnership in March 2012. In 2012, Kids Wish raised $18.6 million but only spent one percent on granting children's wishes‚Äî$240,000. It reported that the organization had spent $110 million on fund-raising solicitors over the prior decade, making it number 1 on the list. According to the report, only three cents out of every dollar raised is spent on wish-granting. The report also said that the organization was paying several million dollars on services to companies operated by Breiner, who retired as the Executive Director in 2010. Since his retirement, Kids Wish Network has paid Breiner's companies $3.3 million. The charity first reported the payments in amended tax filings in 2012 after an employee took her concerns about insider dealings to the charity‚Äôs board. According to the report, \\"Kids Wish violated IRS rules by waiting four years to disclose the money it paid Breiner. The charity blamed the delay on a mistake by its accountants.\\"http://www.tampabay.com/americas-worst-charities/charities/kids- wish-network-inc Breiner said that Kids Wish Network had recently completed an IRS audit, which reviewed his contracts with the organization and found no conflicts of interest. According to its 2011 IRS filing, the charity has 51 employees. Melissa Schwartz, a New York City-based crisis-management specialistSchwartz \\"previously worked for the federal government after the 2010 BP oil spill\\". hired by Kids Wish Network said that the charity contracts corporate telemarketers so that Kids Wish Network staff can focus on \\"working with children\\" not on \\"raising donations.\\" She said the 100 percent of money pledged directly to Kids Wish Network‚Äîas opposed to donations collected through telephone solicitors‚Äîgoes directly to charity. She \\"is focused on the future.\\" NotesReferencesExternal links * Kids Wish Network Category:Children's charities based in the United States Category:Charities based in Florida Category:Organizations established in 1997 ","title":"Kids Wish Network"},{"id":"15094278","text":"Bifrenaria, abbreviated Bif. in horticultural trade, is a genus of plants in family Orchidaceae. It contains 20 species found in Panama, Trinidad and South America. There are no known uses for them, but their abundant, and at first glance artificial, flowers, make them favorites of orchid growers. The genus can be split in two clearly distinct groups:Cogniaux, Celestin A.(1902). Bifrenaria in Flora Brasiliensis K.F.P.von Martius & auct. suc. (eds.) vol.3 p. 5: 476. published on Internet. one of highly robust plants with large flowers, that encompass the first species to be classified under the genus Bifrenaria; other of more delicate plants with smaller flowers occasionally classified as Stenocoryne or Adipe. There are two additional species that are normally classified as Bifrenaria, but which molecular analysis indicate to belong to different orchid groups entirely. One is Bifrenaria grandis which is endemic to Bol√≠via and which is now placed in Lacaena,Kraenzlin, Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig (1928). While Lacaena grandis in Repertorium specierum novarum regni vegetabilis. Ed. Selbstverlag des Herausgebers, Berlin, at vol.25: 25. and Bifrenaria steyermarkii, an inhabitant of the northern Amazon Forest,Dunsterville, Galfried Clement Keyworth & Garay, Leslie A. (1976). Bifrenaria steyermarkii in Venezuelan Orchids Illustrated vol.6: 56. London. which does not have an alternative classification. Description Bifrenaria tyrianthina showing the prominent banana-like pseudobulbs of larger species. By contrast, the pseudobulbs of smaller species, such as this Bifrenaria racemosa, a much less noticeable. Bifrenaria are generally robust plants, of sympodial growth, between ten and sixty centimeters tall. They are characterized by round-section root with thick velamen, four-angled fleshy pseudobulbs of one internode, often basally protected by dried sheaths and with only one apical leaf (except for Bifrenaria steyermarkii, which occasionally has two),Foldats, Ernesto (1970). Xylobium steyermarkii em Novedades Cientificas, Contribuciones Occasionales del Museo de Historia Natural La Salle vol.35: 1. Serie Botanica. Caracas. plicate (fan-folded) enervated leathery leaves, yet malleable and not exceedingly thick, with a pseudo-petiole of basal round section, and a basal inflorescences bearing up to ten flowers, which seldom surpass the leaves' length. Bifrenaria flowers are strongly scented, they have sepals slightly larger than the petals, with the lateral ones basally united to the column foot forming a calcar with truncated extremity. The column is slightly arching, generally without wings or any other appendages, bearing a foot which the labellum is hinged to, whose shape varies, articulated to the column, with a longitudinal channeled callus often with a basal claw. Flowers show two elongated stipes, hardy ever one, at least twice longer than wide, with salient viscidium, visible caudicles and retinacle in inverted positions. The superposed pollinia number four, and are protected by a deciduous incumbent anther. Fruits are green, erect or pendulous; they take about eight months to ripe and hold hundreds of thousand yellowish or brownish elongated seeds up to 0.35 mm long.Dressler, Robert L. (1993). Phylogeny and classification of the orchid family. Cambridge University Press. Among all the mentioned, the main characteristic distinguishing Bifrenaria from its closest relatives is the presence of the calcar.Frederico C. Hoehne (1953). Bifrenaria in Flora Bras√≠lica, Vol 12, 7. Instituto de Bot√¢nica de S√£o Paulo. Other important characters are the four- sided single-leaved pseudobulbs besides the raceme inflorescence with two to ten flowers.Campacci, Marcos A. (2003). Colet√¢nea de Orqu√≠deas Brasileiras II, Bifrenaria. Ed. Brasil Orqu√≠deas. Little is known about pollination in Bifrenaria. Apparently the only existing records report the presence of some large species' pollinia observed on the back of male Eufriesea violacea bees (Euglossinae),Dressler, Robert L. (1990). The orchids natural history and classification. London: Harvard University Press. and of Bombus brasiliensis (Bombini).Singer, Rodrigo B. & Koehler, S. (2004). Pollinarium morphology and floral rewards in Brazilian Maxillariinae (Orchidaceae). Annals of Botany 93: 39‚Äì51. Although there are no reports of flower pollination being directly observed, a paper published in 2006 studied the micromorphology of the labellum in Bifrenaria species, looking for substances useful to insects as food.Davies, K.L. & Stpiczynska, M. (2006). Labellar Micromorphology of Bifrenariinae Dressler (Orchidaceae). Annals of Botany Company. Oxford University Press. published on the Internet The absence of such substances on the densely pubescent surface of most Bifrenaria labelli seems to indicate possible pollination by large bees as the major mean. Another indicator of this possibility is the strong smell emanated by species like B. tetragona which are similar to those of plants in other families which are also pollinated by these bees. The smaller pubescent species may be pollinated by smaller bees, while the smooth ones, which have strong colored flowers, as B. aureofulva, might be pollinated by hummingbirds. Taxonomy and phylogeny The first Bifrenaria species to be described was in 1824 by English Botanist William Jackson Hooker, under the name Dendrobium harrisoniae.Hooker, William Jackson (1824). Dendrobium harrisoniae in Exotic Flora. 2: t. 120. Edinburgh. Three years later, he also described the first small-flowered species, B. racemosa, but placed it in Maxillaria.Hooker, William Jackson (1827). Maxillaria racemosa in Botanical Magazine vol. 54: t. 2789. Curtis Ed., London. With these two publications began a long series of species descriptions and confusing genera creation which generated much doubt for the next two centuries. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew registers the submission of 69 species or subspecific taxa under Bifrenaria since the description of the first species. Among these, twenty are generally accepted but only seventeen are truly well established, with no doubts about their limits and classification. Thirteen other species are still accepted but now placed in other genera, and four or five, due to deficiencies in their descriptions, might never be definitely identified. In 1832, John Lindley proposed the genus Bifrenaria and described its type species, Bifrenaria atropurpurea,Lindley, John (1832). Bifrenaria in The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants: 152. previously named by Conrad Loddiges as Maxillaria atropurpurea.Loddiges, Conrad L. (1832). Maxillaria atropurpurea em Botanical Cabinet vol.19: t.1877. London. The name Bifrenaria comes from bi, two, and freno, brake, a reference to the shape of the two pairs of pollinia hold by separated caudicles presented by its flowers. In 1837, Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, considering the noticeable vegetative difference between the few Bifrenaria known at the time, proposed the genus Adipe, based on B. racemosa morphology, described by Hooker few years before, to which he added the description of a supposed new species, Adipe fulva (today treated as a synonym of B. racemosa).Rafinesque, Constantine Samuel (1837). Adipe in Flora Telluriana vol. 2: 101. The next year Lindley received a specimen from Amazonia, which was morphologically even more distant from the known species, but nonetheless described it as Bifrenaria longicornis'. Five years later, apparently not aware of Rafinesque's previous genus Adipe, Lindley changed his mind and suggested that this species should be classified under a new genus, Stenocoryne.Lindley, John (1843). Stenocoryne in Edwards's botanical register 29(Misc.): 53 Ed. James Ridgway, London. Six species were subsequently attributed to Stenocoryne by various taxonomists, but the genus Rafinesque proposed remained unused until 1990. Wolff M.(1990)\\"Adipe Raf., ein 'vergessener Name.'\\" Die Orchidee 41:35‚Äì37. Bifrenaria leucorhoda is one of the easier to identify small species because of its delicate pale pink flowers and darker purple veins on the labellum. Two species similar to Bifrenaria, but that showed a highly salient claw at the base of the labellum and lateral lobes abruptly divided were then classified under this genus. In 1914, Rudolf Schlechter suggested they should be classified under the genus Lindleyella, with Lindley's Bifrenaria aurantiaca (which presented the mentioned differences) as the type. However this genus name was already occupied (It is a synonym of Lindleya, in the Rosaceae).Schlechter, Rudolf (1914). Lindleyella in Orchideen: 414. Just thirty years later, in 1944, Frederico Carlos Hoehne, working on the first revision of genus Bifrenaria, corrected the suggestion of Schlechter. Hoehne initially proposed the genus Schlechterella for these species but, coincidentally, this name was also taken, this time by African Asclepiadaceae.Hoehne, Frederico Carlos (1944). Schlechterella in Arquivos de Bot√¢nica de Estado S√£o Paulo, n.s., f.m., 2: 13. Finally a genus with an available name in homage to Schlechter was erected in the very next issue of the journal, Rudolfiella, by which time the number of species had increased to seven. On this revision, besides Rudolfiella, Hoehne divided Bifrenaria into two genera, accepting Lindley's Stenocoryne but calling attention to the existence of Rafinesque's Adipe, which should have nomenclatural priority, while also raising doubts about the identity of several described species.Hoehne, Frederico Carlos (1944). Rudolfiella in Arquivos de Bot√¢nica de Estado S√£o Paulo, n.s., f.m., 2: 14. In 1990, Manfred Wolff formally resurrected the genus Adipe and transferred to it ten Bifrenaria species, besides the two already described by Rafinesque; his change was purely nomenclatural and he did not revisit the species.Koehler, S., N. H. Williams, W. M. Whitten & M. C. E. Amaral. (2002) \\"Phylogeny of the Bifrenaria (Orchidaceae) complex based on morphology and sequence data from nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and chloroplast trnL-trnF region.\\" International Journal of Plant Sciences 163:1055-1066 Making the picture even more complex, in 1994, Karheinz Senghas, based on several characteristics shared only by B. tetragona and B. wittigii, described the genus Cydoniorchis to accommodate them.Senghas, Karlheinz (1994). Cydoniorchis em Journal f√ºr den Orchideenfreund 1: 11. In 1996, Gustavo Romero and Germ√°n Carnevali transferred to Bifrenaria a species originally described by Schlechter as Maxillaria petiolaris and now classified as Hylaeorchis petiolaris.Romero, Gustavo A. & Carnevali, German (1996). Bifrenaria petiolaris em Richard Spruce: Botanist and Explorer 180. On the same year, Vitorino Castro Neto published a revision of Bifrenaria, with five sections, which is the classification generally used today.Castro Neto, Vitorino P. (1996). Contribution to the study of the genus Bifrenaria. Proceedings of the 15th World Orchid Conference. Turriers, Naturalia Publications, Rio de Janeiro, pp. 376-383. Bifrenaria has traditionally been classified in subtribe Bifrenariinae of tribe Maxillarieae (Epidendroideae), however, the relationships among the several genera within this tribe are not well defined and changes are expected in the upcoming years. The genus closest to Bifrenaria is Rudolfiella. Other related genera are Teuscheria, Guanchezia, Hylaeorchis and Horvatia, in addition to the more distant Scuticaria and Xylobium. The unification of subtribes Lycastinae, Maxillariinae and Bifrenariinae has recently been suggested. However, there is no consensus on the path to be followed.Whitten, W. Mark, Williams, Norris H. & Chase, Mark W. (2000). Subtribal and generic relationships of Maxillarieae (Orchidaceae) with emphasis on Stanhopeinae: combined molecular evidence. American Journal of Botany. 2000;87:1842-1856. Published on the Internet Contrary to what was previously thought, the relationship among Bifrenaria and all these genera from Central America seems to indicate a primitive origin of Bifrenaria in Central America and its posterior dissemination towards the Southeast of Brazil, where it found fertile grounds to its more recent evolution. In 2000, the first relatively complete molecular analysis on Bifrenaria species were made. Sixteen species from it and six of close genera were studied searching for confirmation of their phylogenetic relations, besides the delimitation of each species and each of Bifrenaria's groups. The results did not allow for the acceptance of Adipe as a separate genus and, although they confirmed the monophyly of Cydoniorchis (B. tetragona and B. wittigii), they dissuade its recognition because six other genera would then be required to accommodate the remaining species. The study also expounded on convenience of splitting two species that are similar to each other and variable among themselves, but with many hard intermediate forms hard to delineate as B. charlesworthii and B. racemosa. It also confirmed the position of B. steyermarkii outside of Bifrenaria, but without suggesting a new name. = Species = Bifrenaria vitellina This small species is similar to B. stefanae, but its flowers are more open and the colors more vivid. Bifrenaria is formed by about twenty species divided in two main groups of plants, large and small, with some visible morphological subdivisions highly confirmed by phylogeny. Large species: is the group originally classified as Bifrenaria. They present four sided pseudobulbs, with relatively short and erect inflorescence bearing up to ten fleshy large flowers but generally less. Usually the flowers are grouped and are fragrant or exhale strong scent. The labellum has three or four lobes and an elongated low callus. They are epiphytes, or often lithophytes. All originated in the southeast of Brazil. This group can be split in three subgroups: *The first subgroup is formed by plants that show a pollinarium with entire stipe and a salient callus just on its anterior region. The species are two, Bifrenaria calcarata, That has the intermadiate lobe of the labellum approximately triangular and the lateral ones square, and B. mellicolor, which has more rounded lobes. These species are similar and preferably epiphytes. *The second subgroup also is formed by plants that show a pollinarium with entire stipe but the callus is entirely salient and fleshy. It is formed by the two species Senghas moved to genus Cydoniorchis, Bifrenaria tetragona that presents a totally smooth labellum with rounded apex, and B. wittigii, that has a partially pubescent labellum of acute apex. *The third subgroup is formed by the four species with a bifurcated stipe: Bifrenaria atropurpurea, the only one with a cuneated viscidium; B. tyrianthina, the only to have rounded viscidium; B. inodora with greenish flowers and two lobed callus; and B. harrisoniae, highly variable species of several colors, that always has three lobed callus on the labellum. The species of this group are often or exclusively lithophytes. *Bifrenaria verboonenii placement is not well defined so far, yet surely among the large species. Small species: is formed by the plants that once belonged to Stenocoryne, or more accurately, Adipe, which normally are epiphytes. They present smaller and not as noticeably four sided pseudobulbs, and long and delicate inflorescence bearing a higher medium number of flowers than the large species, although also never surpassing ten. The flowers are smaller and not fleshy, with an entire labellum, or sometimes slightly lobed on the apex. These species take less luminosity and more humidity than those and are not particularly fragrant. According to their morphology they can be split in four distinct subgroups: *The first subgroup is formed by the two Amazonian species, with elongated rhizome: Bifrenaria venezuelana, that has short inflorescence and highly reduced calcar; and Bifrenaria longicornis, with long inflorescence and noticeable calcar. *Within the second subgroup there is only Bifrenaria aureofulva, easily identifiable because of its bright orange flowers with acute sepals, petals and labellum, which do not open well. *The third subgroup is formed by the two species which present petals que apresentam petals parallel to the column; These two species are hard to separate due to the high number of intermediate varieties: Bifrenaria charlesworthii, that has more open and hairy flowers; and a Bifrenaria racemosa. *The last subgroup is formed by species that present petals oblique to the column. Two have petals and sepals marked with other colors: Bifrenaria clavigera, that has a calcar formed by the fusion of the lateral sepals bases, and Bifrenaria silvana where the calcar is a result of their superposition; Bifrenaria leucorhoda has white flowers with labellum veined of pink color. The two remaining species have highly similar yellow flowers, although of diverse sizes, the smaller and often paler is Bifrenaria stefanae, the larger and of brighter color is Bifrenaria vitellina. Other species: the remaining species are plants about which classification consensus has not been achieved: Bifrenaria maguirei, also classified under the genus Guanchezia, and Bifrenaria grandis, under Lacaena. Bifrenaria steyermarkii is a species highly different from all other Bifrenaria because its inflorescence is very long ant its flowers highly narrow, therefore it does not fit in any group, nevertheless the only other option of classification that has been published so far is under Xylobium what possibly is not a choice either. Distribution and habitat Bifrenaria inodora Despite described with the name of B. inodora, this large species is one of the most fragrant Bifrenaria. It has two main varieties, the one on the photo was also described as B. fuerstenbergiana and has this varietal name, the other one is greener and has a yellow labellum. Bifrenaria exist from the north of South America, one species reaching Trinidad, until Rio Grande do Sul, the farther south State in Brazil, however they are split in two isolated areas:R. Govaerts, M.A. Campacci (Brazil, 2005), D. Holland Baptista (Brazil, 2005), P.Cribb (K, 2003), Alex George (K, 2003), K.Kreuz (2004, Europe), J.Wood (K, 2003, Europe): World Checklist of Orchidaceae. The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Published on the Internet. (Access March 2009). Amazon Forest and Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The later, where seventeen species are present, may be considered their recente center of distribution. The montane area of Rio de Janeiro State and Esp√≠rito Santo is particularly rich with fifteen species registered. Serra dos √ìrg√£os mountains area, in Rio, is reported as habitat of fourteen Bifrenaria species,Miller, David, Richard Warren, Izabel Moura Miller & Helmut Seehawer (2006). Serra dos √ìrg√£os sua hist√≥ria e suas orqu√≠deas. Rio de Janeiro. however, some of these species are considered synonyms today,Koehler, S. & do Amaral, M.D.E. (2004). A taxonomic study of the South American genus Bifrenaria Lindl. (Orchidaceae). Brittonia 56: 314-345. being eleven a more realistic number of species existing in the said area. The species with large flowers are more common on Region Southeast of Brazil, however, they inhabit from the sunnier areas of the seashore to rocky mountain areas of Minas Gerais e Bahia States, from almost sea level up to 2,000 meters of altitude, some species reaching Rio Grande do Sul state.Castro Neto, Vitorino P. (2006). Bifrenaria atropurpurea in Icones Orchidacearum Brasilienses. No species of large flowers exist in Amazon Forest. Some species grow directly attached to the famous Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro which can be observed by the commuters in the cable car. The recent centers of irradiation of this group are the seashore close to Serra do Mar chain of mountains, and the high chains of mountains of Minas Gerais. The most common species in this group, spread from Rio Grande do Sul to Bahia, is B. harrisoniae.Castro Neto, Vitorino P. (2006). Bifrenaria harrisoniae in Icones Orchidacearum Brasilienses. The smaller species of Bifrenaria, which some taxonomists classify under the genus Adipe, are more common on less sunny areas and can be found between 300 and about 1,600 meters of altitude. Six species are native in Serra do Mar Chain of mountains and its arms, place considered the center of distribution of the small species. Only three small species inhabit Amazon, B. longicornis, which is more common at low artitudes;Koehler, Samantha (2001). Estudo taxon√¥mico e an√°lise clad√°stica do complexo Bifrenaria Lindl. (Maxillarieae, Orchidaceae). Universidade Estadual de Campinas. Instituto de Biologia. Published on the Internet Bifrenaria venezuelana, up to 1,450 meter of altitude, and B. steyermarkii from even higher altitudes, in Roraima State, in Brasil, and nearby areas in Venezuela and Surinam.Freitas Luz, Francisco J. (2001). Orqu√≠deas na Amaz√¥nia. Instituto Brasileiro de Cultura, Ed. On Line. The most common species is B. aureofulva,Lindley, John (1843). Bifrenaria aureofulva in Edwards's botanical register 29: t.52. Ed. James Ridgway, London. however, because the geographic characteristic of its territory, without obstacles, B. longicornis is the species spread throughout the largest area, reaching Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Surinam, Guyanas, Trinidad and all Amazonic area in Brazil.Lindley, John (1838). Bifrenaria longicornis in Edwards's botanical register 24: t.93. Ed. James Ridgway, London. Two species seem to be endemic in highly restricted areas: B. silvana. discovered in 1987 at Serra da Ouricana mountains, nearby Itoror√≥, in Bahia which belongs to Adipe group;Castro Neto, Vitorino P. (1991). Bifrenaria silvana in Boletim CAOB 3(4): 41. and B. verboonenii, discovered in September 1995 on Serra do Cip√≥ mountains, close to Diamantina, Minas Gerais, of the large Bifrenara group.Romero, Gustavo A. & Castro Neto, Vitorino P. (2000). Bifrenaria verboonenii in Harvard Papers of Botany 5: 187 Cambridge. Bifrenaria harrisoniae This is the most variable species of all Bifrenaria: there are numberless colors varieties. It can be distinguished from B. tyrianthyna only through its three keeled callus and shorter calcar. Bifrenaria species inhabit three different environments. The large species generally live in well illuminated areas, occasionally epiphyte on trees of sparse foliage, more often as lithophytes, in campos rupestres, montane rocky areas that exist mostly in Rio and Minas Gerais States of Brazil, or over rocks in jungle's clearances. B. tyrianthina is exclusively lithophyte,Toscano de Brito, Antonio & Cribb, Phillip (2005). Bifrenaria tyrianthina in Orqu√≠deas da Chapada Diamantina. Ed. Nova Fronteira. B. tetragona and B. wittigii hardly ever do. B. atropurpurea is the only species found living terrestrially, but in rare occasions. The large species always show . The small species from Southeast Brazil live in cloud montane forests, where the appear in much darker places than the large species. Within this sort of forests the temperature presents noticeable difference between day and night and also through the seasons. These also are plants of caespitous growth, almost all epiphytes, despite there is at least one record of Bifrenaria aureofulva living lithophylically in Chapada Diamantina, Bahia.Toscano de Brito, Antonio & Cribb, Phillip (2005). Bifrenaria aureofulva in Orqu√≠deas da Chapada Diamantina. Ed. Nova Fronteira. The species from Amazon inhabit tropical lowland forests and equatorial forests. Bifrenaria longicornis is mostly found in flood areas along the igap√≥s and igarap√©s (seasonal flood streams and small rivers of Amazon), and occasionally in open fields where the humidity is high and temperature constant through the year, normally in well illuminated places, although not under direct sunlight.Miranda, Francisco (2006). Orqu√≠deas da Amaz√¥nia Brasileira. Ed. Express√£o e Cultura, 1996. B. venezuelana inhabits forests in higher elevations, closer to the Andes.Castro Neto, Vitorino P. (2002). Bifrenaria venezuelana in Icones Orchidacearum Brasilienses. Amazon species are epiphyte and the only Bifrenaria species with elongated rhizome and ascendant growth. Cultivation Bifrenaria tetragona has a strong scent of rotten meat and is not suitable for house decoration. Bifrenaria are comparatively easy to grow orchids. They should be preferably potted on well drained vegetable fiber because their roots and pseudobulbs rot easily when kept humid for long periods. One of three different environments is needed depending on the species' origin to successfully grow these plants. The larger species need more light than the others. The smaller species from Southeast Brazil may be cultivated at the same medium temperature but under less than 10-20% luminosity. Bifrenaria from the Amazon Forest require higher and more constant temperature and humidity than other species. All species need most water and fertilizer during their active growth season.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966.James Dillon (September 1975) , National Park Service and It now houses a museum dedicated to the history of Wells Fargo, and is part of Old Sacramento State Historic Park, itself a National Historic Landmark District. Description The B.F. Hastings Bank Building is located in Sacramento's historic downtown area, at the southwest corner of 2nd and J Streets. It is an architecturally undistinguished two-story brick structure, presenting four bays to J Street and nine to 2nd Street. A single-story canopy extends across the sidewalk in front of both facades, supported by simple square posts. A metal staircase rises in the middle of the 2nd Street facade to an entrance on the second floor. History The building was constructed in 1852. When the Pony Express began service in 1860, this building was selected by its operators as the western terminus of the service, whose eastern end was in St. Joseph, Missouri, more than away. The building was also the first location of the California Supreme Court. The building is now home to one of two museums about the history of Wells Fargo in Sacramento. This location features a re-created 19th-century Wells Fargo Express Company office, artifacts of company history and the California Gold Rush era, and exhibits about the company's role in California Gold Rush commerce.

He was elected unopposed to the British Parliament in 1929 in a byelection for the Londonderry constituency, a seat once held by his father. He was re-elected unopposed for the same constituency in 1931 and 1935. He was returned again in 1945 and again in 1950 with majorities of 50.75% and 62.59% respectively, before resigning his seat in 1951, triggering an uncontested by-election which was won by the Ulster Unionist Party. Personal life His wife was Lady Dorothy Evelyn Francis Ross. It is not clear if they had any children (see NPG). He died in 1958, aged 69.

The only personal information available is what he wrote himself in his work: that he was a Dominican priest from Tolkemit (Tolkmicko) near Frauenburg (Frombork) just north of Elbing (ElblƒÖg) in the Monastic State of the Teutonic Order. He preached in Danzig (Gda≈Ñsk) and claimed to have met Pope Leo X and Polish King Sigismund I the Old. The chronicle was written in the German language sometime between 1517 and 1529. Its 24 chapters deal with Prussian landscape, agriculture, inhabitants, their customs, and history from earliest times to up to 1525 when the Protestant Duchy of Prussia was created. It also contains a short (about a hundred words) vocabulary of the Prussian language, one of the very few written artifacts of this extinct language. While often biased and based on dubious sources, this work became very popular and is the principal source of information on Prussian mythology. The chronicle circulated as a frequently copied manuscript and was first published in 1876. Modern historians often dismiss the Preussische Chronik as a work of fiction. Author bias Division of Prussia into Royal Prussia (pink) and Ducal Prussia (striped) Grunau lived at the time of political division and fierce religious conflicts in Prussia, and as a Catholic priest, was biased against Protestants. In 1525, the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights was transformed into the Duchy of Prussia, the first Lutheran state in the world. Royal Prussia, under the sovereignty of the Crown of Poland, also became largely Lutheran; only the Bishopric of Warmia remained Catholic. Traditions of the Old Prussians, the indigenous people of the region prior to the Prussian Crusade and influx of German colonists, were used in an attempt to find a common ground. Under such circumstances, Grunau was extremely critical of the Teutonic Knights and favored local Prussians, emphasizing their non-German origin. He wrote about their origins, customs, and religion trying in order to differentiate the Prussians from the Germans. Legendary content The so-called Flag of Widewuto was introduced by Grunau Grunau claimed that he incorporated an ancient chronicle, written by the first Prussian bishop Christian (died in 1245). Supposedly Grunau discovered the manuscript, called Liber filiorum Belial, three hundred years after it was written. Christian's manuscript itself used three sources: personal observations by Christian, a book written by parish priest Jaroslav from P≈Çock, and notes by naturalist Dywonys, who was a sole survivor of an expedition stranded in Prussia by accident. Dywonys kept a diary in Russian using the Greek alphabet. His notes were discovered only 1200 years later by Christian. No such manuscripts are known to exist and scholarly consensus is that the entire story was invented by Grunau. For the history of more recent times Grunau used all available sources (such as chronicles by Peter von Dusburg, official documents of the Teutonic Knights, and especially works by Erasmus Stella) and added his own imagination. For example, he took a description of Prussian holy place Romove (Romuva temple) from Peter von Dusburg and improved it by adding an eternally green oak, decorated with portraits of three idols and guarded by vestal virgins. Scholars agree that this addition was most probably borrowed from Adam of Bremen and his description of the Temple at Uppsala. These stories were widely copied by other authors and spread into folklore. In 1853, Max Toeppen was the first to draw serious criticism to historical accuracy and value of Grunau's work. Modern historians almost universally dismiss the chronicle as a work of fiction except for excerpts about events that Grunau eye-witnessed himself. However, some Lithuanian researchers, including Gintaras Beresneviƒçius, believe such approach is overly critical and the chronicle should be more carefully analyzed to identify possibly valid information. Prussian glossary To prove that Prussians had their own language, which was different from the Polish and from Lithuanian languages, Grunau included a hundred-word glossary in the chronicle. Some words are distorted, but as one of the very few written sources for now extinct Prussian language, it is still valuable. Grunau claimed that he could speak some Prussian, but he often mixed in Polish or Lithuanian words as if they were Prussian. Grunau also included Lord's Prayer, allegedly written in Prussian. In 1983, Wolfgang P. Schmid proved that the prayer is actually a mixture of Latvian and Curonian languages. Since the only other Prussian dictionary is the Elbing-Prussian Vocabulary from about 1350 and no written sources of Lithuanian or Latvian existed till after Grunau's death, the list by Grunau is still a very important document for the study of the Baltic languages.

The film deals with the Battle of Nanjing and the following massacre committed by the Japanese army during the Second Sino-Japanese War. The film is also known as Nanking! Nanking! or Nanjing! Nanjing!. The film was released in China on April 22, 2009 and became a major box office success in the country, earning CN¬•150 million (approximately US$20 million) in its first two and a half weeks alone. Plot City of Life and Death is set in 1937, shortly after the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Imperial Japanese Army has just captured Nanjing (or Nanking), capital of the Republic of China. What followed is historically known as the Nanking Massacre, a period of several weeks wherein massive numbers of Chinese prisoners-of-war and civilians were killed by the Japanese military. After some commanders of the National Revolutionary Army flee Nanking, a Chinese soldier Lieutenant Lu Jianxiong and his comrade-in- arms Shunzi attempt to stop a group of deserting troops from leaving the city, but as they exit the gates, they are captured by Japanese forces that have surrounded the city. As the Japanese comb the city for enemy forces, Superior Private (later Sergeant) Kadokawa Masao and his men are attacked by Lu Jianxiong and a small unit of both regular and non-regular soldiers, who fire at them from buildings. Lu and his companions are eventually forced to surrender as more Japanese troops arrive. The Chinese prisoners-of-war are systematically escorted to various locations to be mass executed. Shunzi and a boy called Xiaodouzi survive the shootings and they flee to the Nanking Safety Zone, run by the German businessman and Nazi Party member John Rabe and other Westerners. Thousands of Chinese women, children, elderly men and wounded soldiers take refuge in this safety zone. However, the zone is forcefully entered several times by bands of Japanese soldiers intent on making sexual advances on female refugees. Due to the repeated intrusions, the women are urged to cut their hair and dress like men to protect themselves from being raped. A prostitute called Xiaojiang refuses to do so, saying that she needs to keep her hair in order to earn a living. Meanwhile, Kadokawa develops feelings for a Japanese prostitute named Yuriko, and struggles to come to terms with the omnipresent violence around him with his own conflicting impulses. Despite his feelings of alienation, Kadokawa brings Yuriko candy and gifts from Japan, and promises to marry her after the war. Rabe's secretary Tang Tianxiang and a teacher named Jiang Shuyun manage the daily operations of the safety zone. Even though he is in a privileged position, Tang is still unable to protect his young daughter from being thrown out of a window by a Japanese soldier, and his sister-in-law from being raped. When the Japanese officer Second Lieutenant Ida Osamu demands that the refugees provide 100 women to serve as \\"comfort women\\", Rabe and Jiang tearfully make the announcement to the community. Xiaojiang and others volunteer themselves, hoping that their sacrifice would save the refugees. Kadokawa meets Xiaojiang and brings her rice but witnesses another soldier raping her as she lies almost lifeless. Later, many \\"comfort women\\", including Xiaojiang, die from the abuse, and Kadokawa sees their naked bodies being taken away. Kadokawa feels further estranged when he witnesses Ida shooting Tang's sister-in-law May, who has become insane. Rabe receives an order to return to Germany because his activities in the safety zone are detrimental to diplomatic ties between his country and Japan. Tang and his wife are allowed to leave Nanking with Rabe. However Tang changes his mind at the last moment and trades places with a Chinese soldier pretending to be Rabe's assistant, saying that he wants to stay behind to find May. Mrs Tang reveals that she is pregnant before bidding her husband farewell. Not long after Rabe left, Ida has Tang executed by firing squad. The Japanese disband the safety zone and start hunting for Chinese men who were previously soldiers, promising that these men would find work and receive pay if they turn themselves in. However, men deemed to be soldiers are huddled into trucks and sent for execution. Shunzi, who survived the earlier mass killings, is physically checked and initially deemed to be a non-combatant, but is later recognised by a Japanese soldier and brought onto a truck as well. After Minnie Vautrin and other Westerners plead with the Japanese, Ida permits each refugee to choose only one man from the trucks to be saved. Jiang Shuyun rescues a man, pretending to be his wife, and then returns for Shunzi, claiming that he is her husband, while Xiaodouzi acts as their son. Kadokawa sees through Jiang's ruse but does not expose her. Despite this, another Japanese soldier points her out to Ida and the three of them are captured. Shunzi is taken away again, this time together with Xiaodouzi. Jiang, knowing that she will be raped, asks Kadokawa to kill her. He grants her her wish and shoots her, much to his comrades' surprise. Afterwards, Kadokawa looks for Yuriko and learns that she has died after leaving Nanking. He says that she was his wife and requests that she be given a proper funeral. As the Japanese perform a dance-ritual to celebrate their conquest of Nanking and honour their war dead, Kadokawa reveals his emotional turmoil over what he has done and witnessed. Kadokawa and another Japanese soldier march Shunzi and Xiaodouzi out of town to be executed, but to their surprise, Kadokawa releases them instead. Kadokawa tells the other soldier, \\"Life is more difficult than death.\\" The soldier bows to show his respect for Kadokawa's decision and walks away. Kadokawa then weeps before shooting himself to escape from his guilt. In the end credits, it is revealed that Mrs Tang lived into old age, as did Ida Osamu, and that Xiaodouzi is still alive today.

The film endured a lengthy period undergoing analysis by Chinese censors, waiting six months for script approval, and another six months for approval of the finished film. It was finally approved for release on April 22, 2009. However, the Film Bureau did require some minor edits and cuts, including a scene of a Japanese officer beheading a prisoner, a scene of a woman being tied down prior to being raped, and an interrogation scene of a Chinese soldier and a Japanese commander. Release City of Life and Death was released on 535 film prints and 700 digital screens on April 22 grossing an estimated US$10.2 million (70 million yuan) in its first five days. This made it the second biggest opener in 2009, after the second part of Red Cliff, which opened with US$14.86 million (101.5 million yuan) in its first four days of release. The film is also the highest new box office record for director Lu Chuan, whose second feature film Kekexili: Mountain Patrol grossed US$1.26 million (8.6 million yuan) in 2004. The film received a limited U.S. release in May, 2011. Despite its success, City of Life and Death created controversy upon its release in mainland China. In particular, some criticised the film's sympathetic portrayal of the Japanese soldier Kadokawa. The film was nearly pulled from theaters, and Lu even received online death threats to both himself and his family. Awards The film won the top Golden Shell prize at the 2009 San Sebastian Film Festival and also won the Best Cinematography prize. At the 2009 Asia Pacific Screen Awards, the film won Achievement in Directing (Lu Chuan) and Achievement in Cinematography (Cao Yu).

It lives on reefs in the Caribbean, usually more than below the surface of the ocean. It takes various forms, and its color is reddish orange. Description The orange elephant ear sponge is very variable in form. It may be encrusting, developing a thickness up to thick or have large, flabby lobes or be fan-, tube- or ridge-shaped. Large specimens may combine several of these forms. The surfaces are perforated by small holes, both circular and irregularly elongate, especially on the side away from the current. The flesh is tough, firm and resilient and the thick surface skin is rough to the touch. The colour can vary from yellow, through orange to brick red or brown. This sponge can be confused with Agelas citrina but that species is usually pinkish or creamy yellow. Another similar species is Agelas sventres but that has round holes on the exposed side, each with a noticeable rim. Distribution The orange elephant ear sponge is found in the Caribbean Sea, the Bahamas and Florida. It is found on reefs and reef slopes and on vertical rock surfaces, particularly where the current is strong, and usually at depths greater than . Biology Like other demosponges, the orange elephant ear sponge is a filter feeder. Water circulates through the sponge, entering through fine pores and leaving through the larger holes. Oxygen and food particles (mostly bacteria) are removed from the water as it passes through the sponge, and waste products are carried away. The orange elephant ear sponge is a hermaphrodite; different individuals in a particular population synchronise their spawning activity. In Cura√ßao, they usually choose an afternoon in the second half of July when the moon is in its fourth quarter. By all spawning at the same time, the sponges maximize their reproductive success. The eggs are surrounded by a mass of nurse cells which may provide nutrients to the developing larvae. The orange elephant ear sponge also reproduces asexually. When pieces of sponge become detached they may later reattach themselves to the substrate. The sponge contains secondary metabolites that are distasteful to predatory fish such as the blue-headed wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum). Researchers found that the compounds involved were identical in various members of the genus Agelas, showing that such chemical defences must have been in use before the species evolved from a common ancestor.

He was named SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week after a game against Tulane on October 21 in which he received a 99 percent offensive line grade. Professional career Going into his senior year in 2007, Dunlap was considered to be one of the top offensive tackle prospects in the 2008 NFL Draft. However, due to his poor senior season, his draft stock dropped. =Philadelphia Eagles= Dunlap was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles with the 230th pick overall in the seventh round of the 2008 NFL Draft. He signed a four-year contract with the team on June 17, 2008. He suffered an ankle injury in the 2008 preseason and was placed on injured reserve on August 30, ending his season. Dunlap played in twelve games in the 2009 season and saw significant playing time in a game against the Oakland Raiders after starting left tackle Jason Peters suffered a knee injury during the first quarter. Dunlap took over for Peters in Week 5 against the San Francisco 49ers in 2010 after Peters suffered a knee injury. Dunlap gave up three sacks in the game. He made his first NFL start on October 17, 2010 in a week 6 game against the Atlanta Falcons due to Peters's injury. His main assignment was to block defensive end John Abraham, who made zero sacks in the game. With Peters out again for a week 7 game against the Tennessee Titans, Dunlap again started in place of him. Dunlap, however, suffered a bone bruise and a hyperextension of his knee during the game, and was replaced by left guard Todd Herremans. Dunlap was did not play in weeks 9 and 10 due to his injuries. In a week 13 game against the Houston Texans on December 2, starting right tackle Winston Justice hyperextended his knee and Dunlap took over for him. Dunlap started his first game at right tackle in place of Justice in a week 14 game against the Dallas Cowboys on December 12. He started again in week 15 against the New York Giants in place of Justice at right tackle. Dunlap started in a week 17 matchup against the Cowboys due to the Eagles' decision to rest starters before their playoff run. During the wild card playoff game against the Green Bay Packers, Dunlap was inserted at right tackle to replace Justice, who had three penalties and ineffective play. On October 2, 2011, Dunlap blocked a field goal against the San Francisco 49ers. He became an unrestricted free agent following the 2011 season, but was re-signed to a one-year contract on March 30, 2012. =San Diego Chargers= On March 12, 2013, Dunlap signed a two-year contract with the San Diego Chargers.Chargers sign King Dunlap, according to report In 2014, Dunlap played all 16 games and starting all of them for the first time in his career, while only allowing three sacks.

It was discovered in 1998 as a factor purified from human cells that was essential for productive, in vitro Pol II transcription on a chromatinized DNA template. FACT consists of 140 and 80 kilodalton (kDa) subunits. The 140 kDa subunit is encoded by a human gene (SUPT16H) which is 36% identical to the S. cerevisiae gene Spt16 and the 80 kDa subunit is human SSRP1 (POB3 in S. cerevisiae). Both of these subunits in yeast affect Pol II transcription elongation, and purified human FACT binds specifically to mononucleosomes and the histone H2A/H2B dimer, but not to the H3/H4 tetramer (see: Nucleosome core particle) or Pol II. Co- immunoprecipitation assays with tagged recombinant proteins showed that the Spt16 subunit interacts with H2A/H2B dimers and mononucleosomes, but not H3/H4 tetramers, whereas the SSRP1 subunit interacts only with H3/H4 tetramers and not mononucleosomes. Deletion of the highly acidic carboxy-terminus of Spt16 (a common feature of known histone chaperones) does not prevent Spt16 from forming a stable complex with SSRP1, but it does eliminate interaction with mononucleosomes and ability to stimulate in vitro transcription on chromatinized templates. The two subunits together, but neither alone, can stimulate formation of nucleosomes from free histones and DNA (histone chaperone activity). These two subunits are highly conserved across all eukaryotes, and in addition to transcription, have been shown to affect DNA repair and replication as well. In cells, FACT is enriched on parts of the genome involved in actively elongating Pol II, as seen in fluorescent-antibody staining of Drosophila polytene chromosomes and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays on Drosophila Kc cell extracts.

After some time stopped, they decided to return to Platina, and in 1988, with another name: Slogan that soon after were changed to Cherokee. With another formation, with Renato Nunes on the guitar, the album were released by Baratos Afins again. Soon after, Cherokee dissolved. In 1989, Wander Taffo, one of the most famous brazilian guitarist, invited the Busic Brothers, to record the album Taffo, with specials participations of famous artists in Brazil, such as Herbert Vianna, Lulu Santos and Lob√£o. The cd were recorded at Nas Nuvens Studio(RJ) and mixed in Los Angeles (United States). The cd were released by WEA in 1989. The band made several appearances in television and received many prizes.

Their likely eponymous forefather, Khimshia Abazasdze, fought Timur's invading army in 1399 and then was granted by the king of Georgia lands in Kakheti. According to the historian Cyril Toumanoff, the latter-day Kakhetian noble family of Khimshiashvili descended from these \\"Abazads of Marili\\". The Khimshiashvili are included in the list of the Kakhetian princes (tavadi) attached to the Russo‚ÄìGeorgian Treaty of Georgievsk of 1783. On Russian annexation of Georgia, they had their rank (knyaz) recognized by the new regime, officially in 1850. Many of the Khimshiashvili pursued military careers, such as Georgy Khimshiyev (1836‚Äì1917), general of artillery in the Imperial Russian ranks, and Gogi Khimshiashvili (1892‚Äì1923), colonel in the Georgian service, who was executed by the Soviet regime.  In Adjara =Origin= In the 18th century, a branch of the Khimshiashvili family was established of Adjara in southwest Georgia, then ruled by the Ottoman Empire. By the end of that century, they had been in control of Upper Adjara as one of the most important derebeys, semi-autonomous \\"lord of the valleys\\" in Ottoman Georgia. The circumstances of their appearance in this region are poorly documented; an oral tradition in Adjara had it that a Khimshiashvili nobleman, having killed a man in the Aragvi valley in eastern Georgia, had fled justice to the mountains of Adjara and settled in the village of Nigazeuli. On the other hand, Prince Ioann of Georgia, compiling his genealogy of Georgian noble families in the 1800s, claimed that the Khimshiashvili were originally from Adjara and some of them fled the Ottoman expansionism to Kakheti in 1605. In 1879, ≈ûerif Bey Khimshiashvili asked the Russian authorities to help into inquiry into his family's genealogy, but the results of the research were not convincing. =Rise and fall= The first documented Adjarian Khimshiashvili was Abdullah Bey, killed during his raid into the neighboring Georgian Principality of Guria in 1784. His son Selim Bey sought to bring all of Ottoman Georgia under his rule and staged a coup in Akhaltsikhe in order to gain control of the Eyalet of Childir. After Selim's death in an Ottoman punitive expedition in 1815, his sons and successors, especially, Ahmed Bey, cooperated with the Ottoman government and extended their influence over the territory from the Gurian hills to the Oltu √áay. The Ottomans had to rely on these beys in their efforts to counter the Russian expansion. During the Russo-Turkish War (1828‚Äì29), they posed more threat to the Russians than the Ottoman \\"new model\\" army operating in the Caucasus. During the following two decades, the Ottoman government's \\"westernizing\\" tanzimat eliminated the semi- autonomous rule of derebeys. A revolt against this policy led by Kor Hussein Bey Khimshiashvili was put down in the 1840s. Eventually, ≈ûerif Bey of Adjara, a Khimshiashvili, defected to the Russians during the war of 1877‚Äì78 and, thereby, was able to retain his property after the Russian takeover of Adjara. After the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Soviet invasion of Georgia in 1921, many of his numerous descendants fled to Turkey, where they still live as Ham≈üioƒülu.

He and his older sister Mimma perform circus acts for their village. Barbu and Mimma are sold by their parents to Caruso, a German circus master to supposedly become part of his circus act in Berlin. On their arrival to Germany, Barbu is taken to the circus, in reality being a training camp of young thieves, and Mimma is sold to Cardinal for prostitution in his brothel. Barbu develops a bond with Caruso and Julie, Caruso's wife, and they feel he is the son they never had. Barbu is trained to pickpocket by Marcel, an older Albanian boy. Caruso eventually discovers that Marcel is keeping a small amount of the cash that he steals, resulting in having him lashed and then sold. Now working on his own, Barbu learns that Mimma has been forced into prostitution, and attempts to free her by entering the brothel with a colt pistol left for him by Marcel. Barbu fails and is violently returned to the circus by Cardinal. Caruso denies that he knew Mimma was in Germany, and says it will cost 100,000 euros for her freedom. Barbu steals all of Caruso's hidden stash of money, and attempts to flee with Mimma by having her escape from the brothel window. He is again unsuccessful and severely punished by Caruso. While being lashed, Julie comes in with a pistol and shoots Curuso in the arm. She then takes Barbu to the brothel where they shoot their way to Mimma's room and rescue her. Caruso arrives to the brothel as the three are leaving, and fatally shoots Julie. He lets Barbu and Mimma leave, and then returns to the circus and burns down his big top whilst inside.

In 1996, the station adopted a Classic rock format, which was initially successful but a 1998 realignment of Zimmer Radio's Mid- Missouri stations sent much of the classic rock programming to co-owned KCMQ. At this time, the frequency became Adult Contemporary \\"Mix 93.9,\\" still with the KLSC call letters. Late in 1999, the station became \\"Kiss 93.9\\" and featured an oldies-heavy Soft Adult Contemporary format, adopting the KSSZ call letters. \\"Kiss 93.9\\" failed to gain traction in the market, largely due to a lack of promotion and the heavily-automated format, which utilized personalities recorded from Seattle, Washington.
