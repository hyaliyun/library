Clark launched The Neighbors in 1939 with the Chicago Tribune-New York Daily News Syndicate. Similar to his earlier Side Glances (1928-1939), it explored subtle aspects of middle-class family humor. He soon added a Sunday strip, Our Neighbors, the Ripples, a title eventually shortened to The Ripples(1939-1948). The Sunday strip was dropped in 1948, but his daily panel continued until 1976.

They are mainly concerned with providing knowledge-intensive support for the business processes of other organizations. As a result, their employment structures are heavily weighted towards scientists, engineers, and other experts. It is common to distinguish between T-KIBS, (those with high use of scientific and technological knowledge - R&D; services, engineering services, computer services, etc.), and P-KIBS, who are more traditional professional services - legal, accountancy, and many management consultancy and marketing services. These services either supply products which are themselves primary sources of information and knowledge, or use their specialist knowledge to produce services which facilitate their clients own activities. Consequently, KIBS usually have other businesses as their main clients, though the public sector and sometimes voluntary organisations can be important customers, and to some extent households will feature as consumers of, for instance, legal and accountancy services. The first discussion of KIBS to use the term seems to have been in a 1995 report to the European Commission \\"Knowledge-Intensive Business Services: Users, Carriers and Sources of Innovation\\" https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream?publicationPid=uk-ac-man- scw:75252&datastreamId;=FULL-TEXT.PDF In the decade since this appeared these sectors of the economy have continued to outperform most other sectors, and have accordingly attracted a good deal of research and policy attention. They are particularly of interest in European countries such as Finland. Care should be taken in reading literature on the topic, since a number of related terms are in wide use. The European Union has recently been referring to a much broader concept of \\"knowledge-intensive services\\" recently (extending well beyond the business services) and to \\"business-related services\\" (including many services which have large markets among final consumers). An extract from a description found in Harvard Business Online tells us: \\"A common characteristic of knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) firms is that clients routinely play a critical role in co-producing the service solution along with the service provider. This can have a profound effect on both the quality of the service delivered as well as the client's ultimate satisfaction with the knowledge-based service solution. By strategically managing client co-production, service providers can improve operational efficiency, develop , and generate a sustainable competitive advantage.\\" Client Co-Production in Knowledge-Intensive Business Services $6.95 The European Monitoring Centre on Change (EMCC) has published online a number of reports and studies of KIBS. In the first of these, \\"Sector Futures: the knowledge-intensive business services sector\\" ef0559en1-3.qxd the KIBS sectors are defined in terms of the standard industrial classification (NACE revision 1). To summarise, the main KIBS sectors are: From NACE Division 72: Computer and related activities 72.1: Hardware consultancy 72.2: Software consultancy and supply 72.3: Data processing 72.4: Database activities 72.5: Maintenance and repair of office, accounting and computing machinery 72.6: Other computer related activities From NACE Division 73: Research and experimental development 73.1: Research and experimental development on natural sciences and engineering 73.2: Research and experimental development on social sciences and humanities From NACE Division 74: Other business activities 74.11: Legal activities 74.12: Accounting, book-keeping and auditing activities; tax consultancy 74.13: Market research and public opinion polling 74.14: Business and management consultancy activities 74.15: Management activities of holding companies 74.20: Architectural and engineering activities and related technical consultancy 74.3: Technical testing and analysis 74.4: Advertising 74.5: Labour recruitment and provision of personnel 74.8: Miscellaneous business activities n.e.c. 74.81: Photographic activities 74.84: Other business activities n.e.c. In the revision of NACE (rev. 2) there is some more clarity - most KIBS are located in section M (Professional, Scientific and Technical Activities), which is differentiated from more routine section N (Administrative and Support Service Activities). However, computer and related activities are in section J (Information and Communication Activities). The System in use in Canada and the USA, NAICS, does group these services together with the other KIBS. These categories cover firms and organisations that specialise in producing these services. But other sectors may supply knowledge-intensive business services together with their main products; and such services are of course routinely produced by firms for their own use - almost all firms will have some internal office, computer, marketing activities, for instance. KIBS firms are simply specialists in these service activities, which these are their main products. Some KIBS specialists may be lurking in many of these‚Äîare either knowledge-intensive services such as health, education, telecommunications, finance, or business-related services such as administration and security. But in general, the following sectors are not regarded as KIBS: Health/medical services, Postal services and Transport and Distribution (some specialised logistics services may be seen as KIBS), Consumer Financial and Real Estate services, Education services (other than specialised training for industry), Broadcast and other mass media (again with possible exceptions, such as when these media are also used for specialised delivery of business services as in data broadcast or encoded business video transmissions), public administration (again with some possible exceptions in industry support schemes), Repair/maintenance (with the exception of IT- related activities), retail and wholesale, Social welfare services, Hospitality, Catering, Leisure/tourism, Personal consumer services, Entertainment. Some consultancy and other specialist support KIBS-type activity often serves such industries. KIBS have attracted a good deal of attention from innovation researchers. They are both highly innovative - among the most innovative service sectors if we can go on the results of Community Innovation Surveys (CISs - these surveys are well-documented, for instance on CORDIS CORDIS : Guidance : Innovation Services ) (see also the work of Howells and TetherInnovation in Services: ) - and many of them play important roles in diffusing innovations and helping their clients innovate more generally.

She was most notably the keyboardist and vocalist in the musical group Eleven, along with her partner, bandmate Alain Johannes. Shneider contributed to tracks for Chris Cornell and Queens of the Stone Age, and together with Johannes toured with Cornell on his Euphoria Morning tour in 1999 and with Queens in 2005 on their Lullabies to Paralyze tour. She died of cancer in 2008. Life and career Shneider was born in Riga, Latvia (at the time a member state of the Soviet Union), to a Jewish family. She proved musically gifted from an early age and both of her parents were musicians. In the early 1970s, Shneider was a member of 'Sovremennik', a state-run pop orchestra, that featured her on vocals and piano, as well as her first husband Serge Kapustin on guitar and percussion. Her brother Vladimir Shneider produced and played piano and keyboards for the 'Singing Hearts', which was one of Russia's hottest groups in the mid-1970s, whose output and sound were heavily controlled by the Soviet authorities. Vladimir Shneider recalled: \\"We'd sing 37 songs about how good the Communist Party is, and at the end‚Äîif we were lucky ‚Äî we were allowed to play a mellow song like Killing Me Softly or Ain't No Sunshine. But never rock.\\" In May 1976, Natasha Shneider, her husband Kapustin, and her brother Vladimir defected to the West, arriving in New York City without finances or connections. Her son was born just two months after arriving. They took day jobs and played evening gigs around the city. In 1978 they arrived in Hollywood where they met Guy Costa, the head of Motown's Studio Operations, who introduced them to Berry Gordy, founder of Motown Records. As a consequence of the meeting with Gordy they were signed to the label, reputedly the first Russian band to be on a major label. In June 1980 their newly named group, Black Russian, released an album of R&B; styled pop that was well received by Billboard who highlighted the songs Mystified, Leave Me Now (which was later released as a single), Emptiness, New York City, and Love's Enough.Billboard, June 14, 1980 The album was not a commercial success and Black Russian did not continue. Natasha Shneider and Serge Kapustin then divorced. http://2010odysseyarchive.blogspot.com/2015/07/natasha-shneider-dead- at-52.html?m=1 In 1987, Natasha married her second husband Alain Johannes and they released the album Walk the Moon under the MCA label. In 1990 they formed the band Eleven with drummer Jack Irons and released their debut album Awake in a Dream the following year. The group would go on to release four more albums over the next twenty years, with Irons leaving during their third album (Thunk) in 1995 to play with Pearl Jam, and coming back for the fifth album (Howling Book) in 2003. Shneider and Johannes participated with Josh Homme and other artists on The Desert Sessions, Volumes 7 & 8\\\\. They also contributed to the 2002 Queens of the Stone Age album Songs for the Deaf, and joined the band as part of their touring line-up in support of their 2005 album, Lullabies to Paralyze (Alain Johannes also contributed on several Lullabies' tracks). They wrote, performed and produced with Chris Cornell for his 1999 solo album, Euphoria Morning, and formed part of his band for the subsequent tour. The song \\"Someone to Die For\\" that Shneider wrote alongside Cornell and Johannes, was part of the soundtrack of Spider-Man 2 (2004), performed by Jimmy Gnecco of Ours and Brian May of Queen. A demo version of the song performed by Cornell and Eleven is available on the internet. Acting career Shneider acted in two feature films, playing the roles of Soviet cosmonaut Irina Yakunina in the 1984 film, 2010, and as Polish former exchange student Wanda Yakubovska in the film Spiker (1986). She also had minor roles in the TV shows Miami Vice and Hill Street Blues. Shneider wrote and performed the song, \\"Who's in Control\\", for the 2004 film Catwoman and contributed harpsichord to the 2008 Louis XIV track \\"Guilt By Association\\". Later life and death On July 2, 2008, Shneider died from cancer. The news broke with a message posted on the MySpace page of the band Sweethead, of which Natasha's close friend and former band-mate Troy Van Leeuwen is a member: The following message later replaced the main page at qotsa.com: Shneider is buried at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles.  Legacy  On August 16, 2008, Queens of the Stone Age performed a concert in celebration of Shneider's life at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles. They were joined on stage by Alain Johannes, Tenacious D's Jack Black and Kyle Gass, Matt Cameron, Brody Dalle, Jesse Hughes, Chris Goss and PJ Harvey, playing a variety of QOTSA and non- QOTSA songs. Proceeds from the concert went to defray the costs associated with Natasha's illness. In late 2009, a song she co-wrote with Johannes, \\"Time for Miracles\\", was recorded by Adam Lambert and used in the movie 2012. In 2010 the track WYUT, co-written by Shneider, Johannes and Natalie Imbruglia, appeared on Imbruglia's album Come to Life. While on his solo tour between 2011 and 2016, Chris Cornell would often pay tribute to her and play the song \\"When I'm Down\\", (from the album Euphoria Morning that Shneider produced) accompanied by a vinyl recording of the original piano track that Shneider performed for the song.

The village of Rippon developed in the mid-19th century at the crossroads of the Berryville and Charles Town Turnpike (U.S. Route 340), Withers-LaRue Road, and Myerstown Road. The town was named after nearby Ripon Lodge, although an extra \\"p\\" was added to avoid confusion with a town in Wisconsin. According to the 2000 census, the town has a population of 223. History The 1852 S. Howell Brown Map indicates that there was a school, two shops, a store and several dwellings present at the crossroads. The largest and most well-known of these appears to have been Barney Ott's shop, where the local Farmer's Alliance held its meetings. \\"Newburg\\" was the name given to the post office established there in October of the same year. A number of farms with large old homes still surround the village, as they have since the earliest settlement in the county. These include Ripon Lodge, built in 1833 on a part of the Wheatlands tract by William E Turner; Wayside and Glenwood which were built by Daniel Hefflebower in the early 19th century; and Fairview, built by Gourdon Pendleton, brother of notable Civil War General William Nelson Pendleton (December 26, 1809 ‚Äì January 15, 1883) and owned for over one hundred years by the LaRue family. =Civil War= Several military engagements occurred in the vicinity of Rippon during the Civil War. In one of these, on November 9, 1862, Union General John W. Geary undertook a reconnaissance mission from Harpers Ferry. About five miles from Rippon, Gen. Geary discovered several Confederate camps that had been used by four or five regiments of the 12th Virginia Cavalry. The Union troops vigorously attacked the camps, forcing the Confederates to abandon the camps and retreat to Berryville. Gen. Geary then returned to Harpers Ferry. On October 18, 1863 Confederate Gen. John Imboden attacked Charlestown in an attempt to dislodge the Union troops garrisoned there. The assault was successful and Imboden captured several hundred Union soldiers. Moving south along the Berryville Turnpike, Imboden was attacked by a union force that had advanced from Harpers Ferry. Imboden formed a line of defense just north of Rippon and succeeded in holding off the Union attack. ‚ÄúThere were a number of killed and wounded on each side in this action.‚ÄùJefferson County Historical Society, Charles Town, WV, 2010 One of the largest engagements in Jefferson county between two cavalry units took place near Rippon during the Civil War. On November 18, 1864, Union Captain Richard Blazer and his Independent Scouts were searching for Confederate Colonel John S. Mosby's Partisan Rangers. Lieutenant Adolphus (Dolly) Richards, serving under Mosby, was leading a group of Rangers when he learned of Blazer's approach. In the ensuing engagement, Richards' group of Rangers suffered one casualty and four wounded. Blazer lost 24 men, had 12 wounded and 62 captured, including Blazer himself. =After the war= The Shenandoah Valley Railroad was built immediately to the west of town in the late 1870s. A depot was constructed to take advantage of the crossroads access to Myerstown and Kabletown to the east. St. John's Episcopal Church was established in 1873. The first church building was replaced in 1890 with the Gothic style structure that still stands on U.S. Route 340. The bell tower, porch and choir room were added in 1893. In 1910, a parcel of land was acquired on Withers-LaRue Road to build a parish hall. The hall was replaced by a modern parish facility attached to the back of the church in the mid 1970s. In 1890, the town also contained an Episcopal church as well as a Presbyterian church which was about one mile from the village, on the Bullskin Run. Rippon had two Baptist churches for black residents: the Old School Baptist Church, later known as the Second Zion Primitive Baptist Church, and the New School Baptist Church, now called the Sylvannah Baptist Church. The Old School Baptist Church was founded sometime in the late 19th century. The New School Baptist Church changed its name to Sylvannah Baptist Church in 1908. A school for the white children of Rippon was built in 1874 at the fork of Meyerstown Road and U.S. Route 340. The earliest known school for the black students of Rippon was a one-room school near the railroad tracks on Withers- LaRue Road, but it is unclear what year it was started. In 1900, a new one- room brick school for white students was built on the south side of Withers- LaRue Road. The brick school, enlarged to two rooms, was used until 1971. It is now a private residence. Also in 1900, the school on Meyerstown Road became the Rippon Colored School. The Rippon Colored School remained open until 1939; the building no longer stands. Although some buildings have changed or disappeared over the past 100 years, Rippon still bears a strong resemblance to its appearance in the early 20th century.

Formed in 1943, it was largely destroyed in the battle of Brody, reformed, and saw action in Slovakia, Yugoslavia and Austria before being renamed the first division of the Ukrainian National Army and surrendering to the Western Allies by 10 May 1945. Background After World War I and the dissolution of Austria‚ÄìHungary, the territory of Eastern Galicia (Halychyna), populated by a Ukrainian majority but with a large Polish minority, was incorporated into Poland following the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War. Between the wars, the political allegiances of Ukrainians in eastern Galicia were divided between moderate national democrats and the more radical Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. The latter group itself splintered into two factions, the more moderate OUN-M led by Andriy Melnyk with close ties to German intelligence (Abwehr), and the more radical OUN-B led by Stepan Bandera. When Poland was divided between Germany and the Soviet Union under the terms of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact in 1939, the territory of eastern Galicia was annexed to Soviet Ukraine. In 1941 it was occupied by Germany. Ukrainian leaders of various political persuasions recognised the need for a trained armed force. The Germans had earlier considered the formation of an armed force made up of Slavic people, but they decided this to be unacceptable as they regarded Slavs as sub-humans (untermenschen) compared to the Germanic √úbermenschen master race.Domenico Losurdo, \\"Toward a Critique of the Category of Totalitarianism\\", Historical Materialism 12.2 (April 2004), p.25-55, p.50.

Organizing the division Galician division's recruitment poster, 1943 The idea to organize a division of volunteers from Galicia was proposed by the German Governor of District Galicia, Dr. Otto von W√§chter. He suggested creation of a Waffen-SS division composed of Galician volunteers and designed for regular combat on the Eastern Front. The creation of 14th Voluntary Division SS Galizien was announced in April 1943 at ceremonies throughout Galicia. At least 50 documents including contemporary newspaper clippings, radio broadcasts and speeches etc. record the date of 28 April. By June 1943 the first phase of recruitment had taken place. Initially W√§chter's proposal (which he was certain would be supported by Ukrainian circles) was rejected. In Berlin W√§chter was able to get support from Heinrich Himmler who made the stipulation that the division would only made up of Galicians, who Himmler considered \\"more Aryan-like\\".Hajke Wolf-Dietrich The Ukrainian Division \\"Galicia\\" Toronto, 1970 p. 17 The terms \\"Ukrainian\\", \\"Ukraine\\", could not be used when addressing the division, stressing the Imperial Austro-Hungarian heritage of the term \\"Galizien\\".Idzio, V.

(1988). Ukraine: a History. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. pg. 457 The Ukrainian Catholic Church demanded the presence of its chaplains in the division, which was usually not permitted by Germans. Thus the Ukrainian division along with the Bosnian one became notable exceptions. Germans made two political concessions: It was stipulated that the division shall not be used to fight Western Allies, and would be used exclusively to \\"fight Bolsheviks\\". The other concession was in that its oath of allegiance to Hitler was conditional on the fight against Bolshevism and in the fact that Christian (mostly Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and Ukrainian Orthodox) chaplains were integrated into the units and allowed to function (in the Waffen-SS, only the Bosnian division and Sturmbrigade Wallonien had a clerical presence). The latter condition was instituted at the insistence of the division's organizers in order to minimize the risk of Nazi demoralization amongst the soldiers. Indeed, Nazi indoctrination was absent within the division. The creation of foreign SS units had been carried out previously in the name of fighting against communism; with French, Dutch, Latvian, Estonian, Croatian, and Belarusian units, among others, had been created.Mazower, Mark (2008) Hitler's Empire, pp 454‚Äì460 The creation of a Ukrainian SS division was perceived by many in Ukraine as a step towards the attainment of Ukrainian independence and attracted many volunteers. The Division's Support The Division enjoyed support from multiple political and religious groups within the western Ukrainian community. The Division's prime organizer and highest ranking Ukrainian officer, Dmytro Paliiv, had been the leader of a small legal political party in the Second Polish Republic. Many of his colleagues had been members of the pre-war moderate, left-leaning democratic UNDO movementTimothy Snyder. (2004) The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press: pg. 218. that before the war had also been opposed to the authoritarian OUN. The Division also obtained moral support from officers of the exiled Polish-allied Ukrainian National Republic such as General Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko.John A. Armstrong. (1963). Ukrainian Nationalism. New York: Columbia University Press, pp. 170‚Äì175 The Division was also strongly supported by Andriy Melnyk's moderate faction of the OUN, who saw it as a counterweight to the extremist Banderist-dominated UPA. The Bandera faction of the OUN-B opposed the idea of creating the division, in part because it was an organization outside its control, and had claimed in its propaganda that the division was to be used by the Germans as cannon fodder. Nevertheless, it did not interfere in its formation and once the division was formed it sent some of its members, a number of whom would obtain prominent positions, into the division in order for them to gain military training and to prevent it from completely getting out of their hands. Despite this infiltration, Bandera's OUN failed to gain control over the division. It also had the support of both the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. Among its members was a son of Mstyslav Skrypnyk, the Orthodox Bishop of Kyiv. Commanders and personnel 1943 propaganda leaflet in Ukrainian containing a description of the division inauguration ceremony The Division SS \\"Galizien\\" was commanded by German, Austrian and Ukrainian officers.Mitcham, p162 Training for the recruits began within the SS-Special Purpose Training Battalion (SS-Ausbildungs-Battalion z.b.V), commanded by SS Sturmbannf√ºhrer Bernard Bartlet while the man appointed to oversee the forming of the Division was General Walter Schimana (until October 1943). Schimana never commanded the actual division, as up until the point of his departure it was still a training battalion, staffed mostly by temporary training personnel. From 20 November 1943 it was led by SS-Brigadier General Fritz Freitag. Captain Wolf Dietrich Heike (temporarily seconded from the Wehrmacht) was the chief of staff from January 1944. All regimental commanders were Germans. In total 81,999 men enlisted for service in the division. Of these, 42,000 were called up during the first 'recruitment phase' which took place in May and June 1943 from which only 27,000 were deemed fit for military service and 13,000 were enlisted.Michael Logusz. (1997). Galicia Division. Altglen, PA: Schiffer Military History. pg. 75. To boost the recruitment figures the height minimum requirement was lowered from 1.65m to 1.61m.

Deployment =Anti-partisans actions with Kampfgruppe Beyersdorff= In mid-February 1944, the division received an order to form a battle group known as SS Kampfgruppe Beyersdorff for action against Soviet and Polish partisans. It operated in the Zamo≈õƒá area together with elements of the 5th Regiment, while elements of the 4th Regiment were sent to the Brody area. The SS Kampfgruppe performed its duty well enough that it earned the rare praise of German Field Marshal Walter Model.* =Brody= In July the division was sent to the area of Brody, where heavy combat was under way, and was attached to the 13th Army Corps. Together with six under-strength German infantry divisions, the Galicia Division was responsible for holding a frontage of approximately . On 8 July, the 13th Corps was transferred to the 1st Panzer Army. The Galician Division was placed in reserve. Deployed at Brody were the division's 29th, 30th, 31st regiments, a fusilier and engineering battalion, and its artillery regiment. The 14th SS Field Replacement Battalion was deployed behind the other units. On 13 July, Soviet forces under the command of Marshal Ivan Konev launched their attack. By the next day, they routed a German division to the north of the 13th Corps and swept back an attempted German counterattack. On 15 July, the 1st and 8th Panzer Divisions along with the Galicia Division bore the brunt of a fierce assault by the Soviet Second Air Army, who in only a five-hour period flew 3,288 aircraft sorties and dropped 102 tons of bombs on them as they attempted a counterattack.cited in Michael Logusz's Galicia Division: the Waffen-SS 14th Grenadier Division, 1943‚Äì1945. On 18 July, the division's Field Replacement Battalion was destroyed with its remnants fleeing west, whilst the remainder of 13th Corps, consisting of over 30,000 German and Ukrainian soldiers, was surrounded by the Soviets within the Brody pocket. Within the pocket, the Galician troops were tasked with defending the eastern perimeter near the castle and town of Pidhirtsy and Olesko. The Soviets sought to collapse the Brody pocket by focusing their attack of what they perceived to be its weakest point, the relatively inexperienced Galician Division, and on 19 July attacked. The 29th and 30th regiments of the division, supported by the division's artillery regiment, put up unexpectedly fierce resistance. Pidhirtsy changed hands several times before the Galicians were finally overwhelmed by the late afternoon, and at Olesko a major Soviet attack using T-34 tanks was repulsed by the division's Fusilier and Engineer battalions. On 20 July, the German divisions within the pocket attempted a breakout which failed despite early successes. The Division's 31st regiment was destroyed in fighting. A second German breakout attempt that began at 1:00 am on 21 July ended in failure. to the west of the pocket, however, a German Panzergrenadier Regiment broke through Soviet lines and briefly established contact with the Brody pocket, resulting in the rescue of approximately 3,400 soldiers, including approximately 400 Galicians, before being repulsed. By the end of that day, in the face of overwhelming Soviet attacks, the 14th Division as a whole disintegrated. Its German commander, Fritz Freitag, resigned his command and decreed that everyone would be on his own during the breakout. He and his staff formed their own battle group and headed south, abandoning the division. Some Ukrainian assault groups remained intact, others joined German units, and others fled or melted away. The Ukrainian 14th SS Fusilier battalion, which at this point had also largely disintegrated, came to form the rearguard of what was left of the entire 13th Corps. Holding the town of Bilyi Kamin, it enabled units or stragglers to escape to the south and was able to withstand several Soviet attempts to overwhelm it. By the evening of 21 July, it remained the only intact unit north of the Bug River. In the early morning of 22 July, the 14th Fusilier battalion abandoned Bilye Kamin. The Brody pocket was now only long and wide. The German and Galician soldiers were instructed to attack with everything they had by moving forward until they broke through or were destroyed. Fighting was fierce and desperate. The German and Ukrainian soldiers surging south were able to overwhelm the Soviet 91st Independent Tank Brigade \\"Proskurov\\" and its infantry support, and to escape by the hundreds. The remaining pocket collapsed by the evening of 22 July. Despite the severity of the fighting, the division maintained its discipline and some of its members were ultimately able to break out of the encirclement. Of the approximately 11,000 Galician soldiers deployed at Brody, about 3,000 were able to almost immediately re-enter the division. Approx 7,400 were posted as \\"Missing in combat\\". It has been mistakenly suggested that the losses for the 14th SS Division in Brody, which ran at 73%, were higher than the rest of the Corps. The other battle-hardened German units which had formed XIII.A.K. produced similar casualty reports. About 5,000 men of Korpsabteilung 'C' which formed the spearhead of the breakout forces escaped the encirclement with sidearms but without vehicles, horses, and other weapons, supplies, and equipment. A total of 73 officers and 4,059 NCOs and men were listed as killed or missing. By comparison, the 361st Infantry Division which deployed fewer troops at the beginning of the battle than the Galician Division and together with it formed the rearguard, suffered equal losses. Between 16‚Äì22 July, it sustained almost as many casualties with total losses amounting to 6,310 officers and men (dead, missing or wounded). The necessary manpower required to rebuild this and the other German formations was not available and they were subsequently disbanded and the survivors incorporated into other divisions. As for XIII.A.K., the final report of the Corps's liquidation commission (applicable to its regular army units only) recorded 21,766 killed or missing in action, which together with the 7,000 killed or missing men from the Galician Division brings to the total lost to about 29,000. This figure corresponds with General Lange's own estimate of a total of 25‚Äì30,000 killed in the encirclement. On the other hand, the recently declassified secret Soviet General Staff report states that during the course of the battle their forces destroyed more than 30,000 soldiers and officers, 85 tanks and self- propelled guns, over 500 guns of various calibres, 476 mortars, 705 machine guns, 12,000 rifles and submachine guns, 5,843 vehicles, 183 tractors and trailers and 2,430 motorcycles and bicycles. It also claims that over 17,000 soldiers and officers were taken prisoner, 28 tanks and self-propelled guns were captured, as were over 500 guns of various calibres, more than 600 mortars, 483 machine guns, 11,000 rifles and sub-machine guns, over 1,500 vehicles, 98 tractors and trailers, 376 motorcycles and bicycles, in excess of 3,000 horses and 28 warehouses full of military goods. An estimated total number of survivors of all XIII.A.K. units has been given by the adjutant of the 349th Infantry Division as 15,000 officers and men, while a slightly lower figure of 12,000 was subsequently given by Oberst Wilck. =The division in Slovakia= The Germans rebuilt the division over two months using reserve units.

Fremal, the division's \\"members were helping in anti-partisan, repressive, and terrorist actions and committed murders and other excesses\\". The overall degree of criminality was less than that of Einsatzgruppe H or the Slovak collaborationist Hlinka Guard Emergency Divisions. Jan Stanislav, the director of the National Uprising Museum in Slovakia, denied that the division or that Ukrainians took part in brutalities committed against the Slovak people at this time. About 200 soldiers deserted from the division while it was in Slovakia; many joined the partisans. =Anti-partisans actions on the Slovenian-Austrian border= In the end of January 1945, it was moved to Slovenia, where from the end of February until the end of March 1945, it together with other SS and SD formations fought Yugoslav Partisans in the Styria and Carinthia (province) areas near the Austrian-Slovenian border.Karel Prusnik-Gasper, Gemsen auf der Lawine. Der K–¥rntner Partisanenkampf (Ljubjana/Klagenfurt 1981) During this time, the division absorbed the 31 SD Schutzmannschafts Battalion, also known as the Ukrainian Self Defense legion.WOLF-DIETRICH HEIKE.UKRAINISCHE DIVISION \\"GALIZIEN\\". Geschichte der Aufstellung und des Einsatzes (1943‚Äì1945) 1970 When on 31 March Soviet forces commenced an attack from Hungary into Austria that ruptured the German front, the division was ordered to advance northward to Gleichenberg in a desperate attempt to halt the Soviet advance. =Graz= From 1 April until the end of the war, with a strength of 14,000 combat troops and 8,000 soldiers in a Training and Replacement Regiment, the division fought against the Red Army in the region of Graz in Austria where in early April it seized the castle and village of Gleichenberg from Soviet forces (including elite Soviet airborne troops from the 3rd Guards Airborne Division) during a counterattack and on 15 April repulsed a Soviet counterattack. The division at this time maintained a 13-km front.On-line Ukrainian-language translation Of Wolf-Dietrich Heike's book THE UKRAINIAN DIVISION \\"GALICIA\\" THE HISTORY OF ITS FORMATION AND MILITARY OPERATIONS The English-language synapse mentions that the division \\"distinguished itself\\" and maintained a sector of the front until German capitulation During one critical situation, Freitag became so alarmed by the developments at the front, that in the presence of the commander of the 1st Cavalry Corps General der Kavallerie Harteneck, he reacted instinctively and announced his abdication as Divisional commander and responsibility for its performance in action ‚Äì as he had done at Brody. General Harteneck refused Freitag's resignation and ordered him to remain at his post. Due to his performance during the battles surrounding Gleichenberg, Waffen- Obersturmf√ºhrer Ostap Czuczkewycz was awarded the Iron Cross, 1st class.Michael Melnyk. (2007).

Gallician SS Volunteer Division. Helion and Company. pg. 268 1st Ukrainian Division UNA On 17 March 1945, Ukrainian √©migr√©s established the Ukrainian National Committee to represent the interests of Ukrainians to the Third Reich. Simultaneously, the Ukrainian National Army, commanded by general Pavlo Shandruk, was created. The Galician Division nominally became the 1st Division of the Ukrainian National Army, although the German Army's High command continued to list it as the Ukrainian 14th SS Grenadier Division in its order of battle.Gosztony, Peter, Endkampf an der Donau 1944/45, Wien: Molden Taschenbuch Verlag, 1978. The Division surrendered to British and US forces by 10 May 1945. =Rimini= Most of The Ukrainian soldiers were interned in Rimini, Italy, in the area controlled by the II Polish Corps. The UNA commander Pavlo Shandruk requested a meeting with Polish general W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders a prewar Polish Army colleague, asking him to protect the army against the deportation to Soviet Union. There is credible evidence that despite Soviet pressure, Anders managed to protect the Ukrainian troops, as former citizens of the Second Republic of Poland. This, together with the intervention of the Vatican prevented its members from being deported to the USSR. Bishop Buchko of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church had appealed to Pope Pius XII to intervene on behalf of the division, whom he described as \\"good Catholics and fervent anti-Communists\\". Due to Vatican intervention, the British authorities changed the status of the division members from POW to surrendered enemy personnel.Howard Margolian. (2000). Unauthorized Entry: The Truth about Nazi War Criminals in Canada, 1946‚Äì1956. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000. . pg. 135 176 soldiers of the division, mainly prewar Polish Army officers followed their commander in joining W≈Çadys≈Çaw Anders's Polish army. Former soldiers of SS \\"Galizien\\" were allowed to immigrate to Canada and the United Kingdom in 1947. The names of about 8,000 men from the division who were admitted to the UK have been stored in the so-called \\"Rimini List\\". Despite several requests of various lobby groups, the details of the list have never been publicly released, however the list is available on line and the original List is available for public inspection at the Schevchenko Archive in Linden Gardens London. In 2003 the anti-terrorist branch of Scotland Yard launched an investigation into people from the list by cross- referencing NHS patient, social security and pensions records; however, the order to release confidential medical records was met with outcry from civil liberties groups. Daniel Foggo, Police to use NHS records to find Nazi war criminals, The Telegraph, 22 June 2003 Atrocities Although the Waffen-SS as a whole was declared to be a criminal organization at the Nuremberg Trials, the Galizien Division has not specifically been found guilty of any war crimes by any war tribunal or commission. However, numerous accusations of impropriety have been leveled at the division, and at particular members of the division, from a variety of sources. It is difficult to determine the extent of war criminality among members of the division.Howard Margolian. (2000). Unauthorized Entry: The Truth about Nazi War Criminals in Canada, 1946‚Äì1956. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2000. . pp. 132‚Äì145 If prior service in Nazi police units is a measure of criminality, only a small number were recruited from established police detachments. Among those who had transferred from police detachments, some had been members of a coastal defence unit that had been stationed in France, while others came from two police battalions that had been formed in the spring of 1943, too late to have participated in the murder of Ukraine's Jews. According to Howard Margolian, there is no evidence that these units participated in anti-partisan operations or reprisals prior to their inclusion into the division. However, before their service within the police battalions, a number of recruits are alleged to have been in Ukrainian irregular formations that are alleged to have committed atrocities against Jews and Communists. Nevertheless, in their investigations of the division, both the Canadian government and the Canadian Jewish Congress failed to find hard evidence to support the notion that it was rife with criminal elements. The division did destroy several Polish communities in western Ukraine during the winter and spring of 1944.Timothy Snyder. (2004) The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press: pp. 165‚Äì166 Specifically, the 4th and 5th SS Police Regiments have been accused of murdering Polish civilians in the course of anti-guerilla activity.

Yale historian Timothy Snyder noted that the division's role in the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia and Eastern Galicia was limited, because the murders were primarily carried out by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. In a speech to the soldiers of the 1st Galician division, Heinrich Himmler stated: In June 2013, Associated Press published an article stating that an American, Michael Karkoc, who was alleged to be a former \\"deputy company commander\\" in the Division, was implicated in war crimes committed before he joined the Division in 1945. According to Associated Press, before joining the Division Karkoc had served as a \\"lieutenant\\" of the 2nd Company of the German SS Police-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion (USDL).Rising, David, R.

The Polish historian Grzegorz Motyka has stated that the Germans formed several SS police regiments (numbered from 4 to 8) which included \\"Galizien\\" in their name. Those police regiments joined the division in Spring 1944. On 23 February 1944, before being incorporated into the division, the 4th and 5th police regiments had participated in anti-guerrilla action at Huta Pieniacka, against Soviet and Polish Armia Krajowa partisans in the village of Huta Pieniacka, which had also served as a shelter for Jews and as a fortified centre for Polish and Soviet guerrillas. Huta Pieniacka was a Polish self-defence outpost,G.

Five days later, a mixed force of Ukrainian police and German soldiers shelled the village before entering it and ordering all the civilians to gather together. In the ensuing massacre, the village of Huta Pienacka was destroyed, and between 500Ukrainian state archives and 1,000 of the inhabitants were killed. According to Polish accounts, civilians were locked in barns that were set on fire, while those attempting to flee were killed.. Accessed 3 September 2009. Archived 3 September 2009. Polish witness accounts state that the soldiers were accompanied by Ukrainian nationalists (paramilitary unit under W≈Çodzimierz Czerniawski's command), which included members of the UPA, as well as inhabitants of nearby villages who took property from households. The NASU Institute of History of Ukraine of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine concluded that the 4th and 5th SS Galizien Police regiments did kill the civilians within the village, but added that the grisly reports by eyewitnesses in the Polish accounts were \\"hard to come up with\\" and that the likelihood was \\"difficult to believe\\". The Institute also noted that, at the time of the massacre, the police regiments were not under 14th division command, but rather under German police command (specifically, under German Sicherheitsdienst and SS command of the General Government).Institute of Ukrainian History, Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, Chapter 5, pp. 284 .

The Polish Institute of National Remembrance stated: \\"According to the witness' testimonies, and in the light of the collected documentation, there is no doubt that the 4th battalion 'Galizien' of the 14th division of SS committed the crime\\" =Pidkamin and Palikrowy= The village of Pidkamin was the site of a monastery where Poles sought shelter from the encroaching front. On 11 March 1944, around 2,000 people, the majority of whom were women and children, were seeking refuge there when the monastery was attacked by the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (unit under Maksym Skorupsky command), allegedly cooperating with an SS-Galizien unit. The next day, 12 March, the monastery was captured and civilians were murdered (at night part of the population managed to escape). From 12 to 16 March, other civilians were also killed in the town of Pidkamin. Estimates of victims range from 150, by Polish historian Grzegorz Motyka,Grzegorz Motyka, Ukrai≈Ñska Partyzantka 1942‚Äì1960, Warszawa 2006, p. str. 181, 385 to 250, according to the researchers of the Institute of History of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences. Members of another SS-Galizien sub-unit also participated in the execution of Polish civilians in Palykorovy, located in the Lw√≥w area (Lviv oblast) near Pidkamin (former Tarnopol Voivodeship). It is estimated that 365 ethnic Poles were murdered, including women and children. =The Canadian Desch√™nes Commission= Memorial to SS-Galizien division in Chervone, Lviv Oblast, western Ukraine The Canadian \\"Commission of Inquiry on War Crimes\\" of October 1986, by the Honourable Justice Jules Desch√™nes concluded that in relation to membership in the Galicia Division: However, the Commission's conclusion failed to acknowledge or heed the International Military Tribunal's verdict at the Nuremberg Trials, at which the entire Waffen-SS organisation was declared a \\"criminal organization\\" guilty of war crimes. Also, in its conclusion, the Desch√™nes Commission only referred to the division as 14. Waffen-Grenadier-Division der SS (Galizische Nr.1). Thus, in legal terms, it only acknowledged the formation's activities after its name changed in August 1944, although the massacre of Poles in Huta Pieniacka, Pidkamin and Palikrowy occurred when the division was called SS Freiwilligen Division \\"Galizien\\". Despite that, a subsequent review by the Canadian Minister of Justice again judged that members of the Division were not implicated in war crimes.

There are eight modules: *six core modules (Old Testament, New Testament, Church, Christology, Sacraments and Morality) *two specialist elective modules The core modules explore the Scriptures, the Person of Jesus Christ, the Church and its sacramental life and moral understanding. The specialist modules relate to each participant's ministry in the Church, covering such areas as Religious Education in schools, Parish Catechesis, Liturgy, Justice and Peace. Other modules of a practical nature for teachers, for catechists, for youth workers, for liturgists are available. Each module requires: *ten hours‚Äô contact time *an assignment of 1500 words of equivalent. The Course is offered in all five Catholic Colleges of Higher Education and at centres in every diocese in England and Wales. The certificate is issued after all eight modules are passed. There is a maximum time limit of five years from the start of the first module to complete the eight modules.

He also created other syndicated strips and panels for King Features.  Biography  Born in Newark, New Jersey, Hoest spent two years in the Navy and studied art at Cooper Union. He started his art career in 1948 as a greeting card designer with Norcross Greeting Cards, continuing in that field until 1951 when he left to become a freelancer. His cartoons soon began appearing in Collier's, Playboy, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines.Lambiek: Bill Hoest =Comic strips= Hoest entered the comic strip community in 1960 with My Son John, for the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate.

After an injury from a 1965 traffic accident kept Haenigsen away from the drawing board, Hoest took over most of the work, although Haenigsen still supervised and signed each Penny strip. Hoest was one of the cartoonists featured in Think Small, a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by Volkswagen dealers. Top cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with amusing automotive essays by such humorists as H. Allen Smith, Roger Price and Jean Shepherd. While working on Penny, Hoest began his cartoons about a bickering couple, The Lockhorns, as a single-panel daily on September 9, 1968, with the Sunday feature launched April 9, 1972. He then took an alternate route with Bumper Snickers (1974), a cartoon series about cars and drivers for the National Enquirer. His King Features comic strip, Agatha Crumm, was published as both a daily and a Sunday strip from 1977 to 1996. What a Guy!, co-created with his assistant John Reiner, was syndicated by King Features from 1987 to 1996. =Laugh Parade= Hired as the cartoon editor of Parade in 1979, Hoest created Laugh Parade for that Sunday supplement magazine in 1980.

The area's name was first given in 1961, honoring the Quapaw Indians who lived in the area centuries ago. As many as fifteen separate National Historic Register Districts make up the Quapaw Quarter, including more than 200 separate homes and buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. Trapnall Hall, along East Capitol Avenue, was among the first of the homes built in 1843 as the home of early state legislator Frederic Trapnall and his wife, Martha. Structures housing businesses on Main Street and Broadway south of Interstate 630 are also among this group. Throughout the Quapaw Quarter, many small and large homes from the Antebellum and Victorian eras can be found, in addition to several examples of Craftsman-style architecture. Scott, Center and Spring streets, in particular, are where many such homes stand today. The exterior of the Villa Marre, one such home, was known nationally as the outside of the home containing the office of Sugarbaker Designs, the fictional Atlanta-based interior design firm on the CBS sitcom Designing Women. The actual home is along Little Rock's Scott Street, and has been a former home for the office of the Quapaw Quarter Association, the chief organization that sponsors historic preservation efforts in the area. Notable Quapaw Quarter neighborhoods =Governor's Mansion District= Along with the Villa Marre, the exterior of the Arkansas Governor's Mansion was also featured on Designing Women, shown as the home of Suzanne Sugarbaker. The mansion and its grounds comprise a city block, dividing Center Street in its 1800-numbered block, and anchor the city's Governor's Mansion Historic District, encompassing many homes and businesses along and around lower Broadway. The first official residence of Arkansas's governors opened on January 10, 1950, to a week-long open house for all Arkansans. The Georgian Colonial Revival home was renovated and expanded from 2000 through 2002, reopening for the inauguration of Mike Huckabee's second full term as governor in early 2003. =MacArthur Park Historic District= The MacArthur Park Historic District, dedicated in 1981, adjoins the city's MacArthur Park along East 9th Street, including the Arkansas Arts Center and the circa-1840 Tower Building of the Little Rock Arsenal. This building in the district contains the birthplace of General Douglas MacArthur, a foremost commander of American forces in the Pacific Theater during World War II. =South Main Residential Historic District= The South Main Residential Historic District ‚Äî nicknamed SoMa by some area locals ‚Äî was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2007 according to the Department of Arkansas Heritage. The district which runs along South Main Street between 19th and 24th streets is notable for its assortment of quality late 19th and early 20th century residential architecture, including the Queen Anne, Craftsman and Colonial Revival styles. Area landmarks =Mount Holly Cemetery= Another area landmark is Mount Holly Cemetery, at the intersection of 12th and Broadway streets, with one of the largest collections of gravesites of notable Arkansans, from past governors, senators and mayors to Confederate spy David Owen Dodd and Arkansas Gazette founder William E. Woodruff. The cemetery dates from 1843, and is among the several locations throughout the Quapaw Quarter on the National Register of Historic Places. =Notable businesses= The edge of the Quapaw Quarter, near the downtown central business district, contains the headquarters of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, the state's largest newspaper, with roots in the Arkansas Gazette founded in 1819, and the Arkansas Democrat founded in 1878. Its headquarters are in a circa-1904 building at the intersection of East Capitol Avenue and Scott Street that formerly housed a branch of the YMCA.

She said \\"number one was it was the first show we shot after 9/11. And that whole week, while driving in LA, people would pull up and give me a very sad look and a quiet 'thank you' for making them laugh\\". Plot At the last minute, Monica decides to throw a Halloween party; enthusiasm diminishes markedly when she announces that everyone needs to come in costume. Monica dresses up as Catwoman, Phoebe as Supergirl, Chandler as a large pink bunny (Monica's idea), Ross as a potato satellite that looks a lot like feces, which he calls Spud-nik, and Joey as Chandler. On account of her pregnancy, Rachel shows up to the party in an expensive dress she wants to wear because she soon will not be able to fit into it. Rachel's maternal instinct kicks in when the first trick-or-treaters arrive, and she spends the evening handing out candy... most of it to a smart little girl who figures out how to charm her. She is then reduced to handing out cash until Gunther can get them some more. Finally a boy arrives who would rather have money than candy, and she yells at him until he runs away, crying‚Äîat which point guilt kicks in and she runs after him. She ends up giving him $50 and going to several houses with him posing as his girlfriend. On her return, she confesses to Joey that she is not entirely cut out for motherhood yet. Phoebe runs into her twin sister Ursula on the street. Ursula reveals that she is getting married next week and invites Phoebe to the wedding; to return the favor, Phoebe invites her and her fianc√© to Monica's Halloween party. Ursula's fianc√© Eric (Sean Penn), a 2nd-grade schoolteacher, arrives first and immediately slaps Phoebe's butt; after working through his embarrassment, they begin talking. It becomes clear after some conversation that Ursula has been lying to him, basically returning his own answers to him about her age, pastimes, history and employment, including herself being a teacher at the fictional \\"Top-Secret Elementary School for the Children of Spies\\". This, compounded by Eric's sudden urge to be impulsive and romantic, resulted in the two planning to be married barely three weeks after meeting. Phoebe, using Ursula's misplaced purse as evidence, breaks the news to him as gently as she can. Ross's girlfriend Mona also attends the party and is the first to correctly interpret Ross's costume; Ross is nervous that Joey, who has also shown attraction to her, will steal her from him.

Discovery In 1910, the American geologist Mignon Talbot was walking with her sister Ellen to Holyoke, Massachusetts, when they passed a farm and noticed a small hill nearby. It had a gravel pit at one side, and was formed by an accumulation of sand, gravel, and boulders left by a receding glacier. Talbot noticed a white streak on a sandstone boulder at the bottom of the gravel pit, and upon discovering these were bones, she told her sister she had found a \\"real live fossil\\", since many fossil tracks had previously been discovered in the Connecticut Valley (which she had often taken her students to see), but few actual dinosaur skeletons, and none at Mount Holyoke. She asked the owner of the land permission to collect the specimen for Mount Holyoke College (an all-women's college a few miles from there), where she was in charge of the department of geology, which was granted. The next day she brought a group of workmen to collect the specimen, and found another piece of sandstone that contained the rest of the fossil as well as impressions of those in the first slab. The specimen appeared to have been exposed for years with no one noticing it, the boulder having been broken open by people or frost. The fossil was brought to the laboratory where it was prepared and photographed. The specimen consisted of cervical (neck), dorsal (back) and caudal (tail) vertebrae, a partial humerus (upper arm bone), ribs, the pubis, the ischium, the femora (thigh bones), the left tibia and fibula (lower leg bones), metatarsals, pedal phalanges (toe bones), and possible skull fragments. The light and delicate bones were in their natural position or nearly so within the rock, except for the tail and possible skull fragments, which were a few centimeters away from the skeleton. The significance of the fossil was confirmed at an intercollegiate meeting of geology departments, and when the American paleontologist Richard Swann Lull subsequently encouraged Talbot to describe the specimen, she replied she did not know anything about dinosaurs, but Lull suggested she should study them and then describe it. In December 1910, Talbot read a preliminary description of the fossil at the Paleontological Society meeting at Pittsburgh, and in June 1911 she published a short scientific description, wherein she made the specimen the holotype of the new genus and species Podokesaurus holyokensis. The generic name is derived from the Greek words pod≈çkƒìs (œÄŒøŒ¥œéŒ∫Œ∑œÇ) which means \\"swift (or fleet)-footed\\", an epithet commonly used in reference to the Greek hero Achilles, and saura (œÉŒ±œçœÅŒ±) meaning \\"lizard\\", while the specific name refers to Holyoke. In full, the name can be translated as \\"swift-footed lizard of Holyoke\\". The discovery and naming of Podokesaurus made Talbot the first woman to find and describe a non-bird dinosaur.Turner, S., Burek, C. & Moody, R. T., 2010, \\"Forgotten women in an extinct Saurian 'mans' World\\", In: Moody, R. T., Buffetaut, E., Martill, D. & Naish, D. Eds. Dinosaurs and Other Extinct Saurians: A Historical Perspective. The Geological Society, London, Special Publication, 343: 111-153 The American paleontologist Robert T. Bakker stated in 2014 that while old professors grumbled that females were unfit for working with fossils, Talbot's discovery of Podokesaurus was a counterargument to that. By the time the description was published, the fossil had been sent to the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University for further preparation and study, where casts were also made of the bones as they lay in the rock. There, Lull drew a reconstruction of the skeleton with missing parts based on Compsognathus, and created a model of the animal in life, which Talbot later described as having a \\"sardonic smile\\". Lull expanded on Mignon's article in a 1915 publication, wherein he also proposed other identities for some of the bones than what she had originally suggested (including a partial coracoid instead of a scapula and part of the tibia instead of the ilium). Lull suggested the ledge that the boulder which contained the fossil came from must have lied on the south side of the Holyoke range, about two or three miles North from where it was found, and specified that it was from the Longmeadow Sandstone. Lull had sent his manuscript to the Danish ornithologist Gerhard Heilmann for criticism prior to publication, which Heilmann published in a 1913 Danish article in which he included previously unpublished photos of the fossil received from Talbot, as well as his own restorations. He disagreed with some of Lull's anatomical interpretations, and had corresponded about the fossil with the American zoologist Robert Wilson Shufeldt about his contentions. Heilmann's article was one in a series about the origin of birds, wherein he examined the skeletons of prehistoric reptiles to find traits that may have been ancestral to birds. In a 1916 Washington Academy of Sciences meeting, Shufeldt gave an account of his correspondence with Lull, Talbot, and Heilmann, and agreed with the latter in some of his criticisms of Lull's restoration of Podokesaurus. Talbot wanted the fossil to stay at Yale or Washington on permanent exhibition, where it could \\"be with its kind\\", but it was kept at Mount Holyoke in the old science building Williston Hall as a local specimen, where it became a \\"pet curiosity\\" for the students. During the Christmas break of 1917, Williston Hall burned down, and no remains of the Podokesaurus fossil were found in the rubble. The American writer Christopher Benfey pointed out in 2002 that Podokesaurus therefore had the peculiar distinction of being the dinosaur that vanished twice in history. The German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene was the last to study and describe the holotype specimen (in a 1914 publication) before it was destroyed. While the college's fossil collections were almost entirely destroyed by the fire, facilities and collections continued to grow and improve due to Talbot's efforts. No other Podokesaurus specimens have since been found, but casts of the type specimen remain at the Peabody Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Podokesaurus received little further attention until abundant material of Coelophysis was discovered in the late 1940s, and the anatomy of small theropod dinosaurs became clearer; the American paleontologists Edwin Harris Colbert and Donald Baird compared Podokesaurus with Coelophysis in 1958 by using casts of the former. Along with Anchisaurus, Podokesaurus was among the first adequate dinosaur skeletal material known from the East Coast of North America. Apart from a tooth, all other Early Jurassic theropod records on the East Coast are footprints.Weishampel, D. B., (2006) Another look at the dinosaurs of the East Coast of North America.

Description Size compared to a human The preserved body of the only known Podokesaurus fossil was long. Lull estimated the complete length of Podokesaurus to have been , the neck accounting for , the back for , the sacrum for , and the tail for . Colbert estimated the animal's length at about , which the American paleontologist Gregory S. Paul repeated with in 2016. in 1995, the American writer Jan Peczkis estimated Podokesaurus to have weighed , through pelvic height determination. Paul estimated it to have weighed . Talbot stated in a 1937 that those scientists who had seen the specimen did not think it was a young individual as there where no indications of cartilage where this would turn to bone with age, while Paul stated it was possibly juvenile. In general, the animal was lightly constructed, with hollow bones. As a coelophysoid, it would likely have been similar in build to for example Coelophysis, being slender, long-necked, and with sharp, recurved teeth. Since few other small theropods were known at the time Podokesaurus was described, it was mainly compared to the later genera Compsognathus and Ornitholestes, which were thought related. Due to the fragmentary nature of the Podokesaurus specimen and the fact that it is lost, the identity and shape of some of its bones were unclear. Since only casts of the specimen remain today, it is only possible to get a general impression of the preserved skeleton and its proportions. The skull bones were identified as such by Talbot because two of them were bilaterally symmetric, and one was broadly convex with a sulcus at the mid line, and according to Lull, was possibly placed at the upper wall of the skull, not far from the frontal bones. Other skull elements may have been part of the nasal bones. The vertebrae were very light and hollow, and some were slightly concave at each end. The cervical vertebrae were relatively large in legth and diameter compared to the dorsals, and had styliform cervical ribs similar to Compsognathus. The front dorsals were much shorter, whereafter they again increased in size toward the pelvis. They measured in length. The neural spines of the dorsals were high and curved, but not as expanded from front to back as in Compsognathus. The transverse processes formed a circular arc downward from each side of a dorsal, extending about as far from the centrum as the spinuous process was high. The zygapophyses were well-developed. The centra were relatively longer than those of Ornithomimus, while those of Compsognathus resembled those of Podokesaurus more, though shorter. While the hind part of the tail was located some distance away from the rest of the skeleton, Lull believed it was in its natural position and that it would have been very long, the intermediate vertebrae having been swept away. The caudal vertebrae were very long and slender, and along with their chevrons, resembled those of Ornitholestes. A typical caudal was long and in diameter. The caudals were very similar in length and did not decrease in length until the last few in the succession. The ribs were very slender and hollow, the largest being long and wide. Just in front of the pubis there was a cluster of slender abdominal ribs (gastralia), the longest of which was long. The humerus was small and very delicate, long, less than half the length of the femur. Lull found it similar to that of Ornitholestes, apart for the radial crest not being as high, showing little muscular power. He found the hand more similar to that of Compsognathus than of Ornitholestes. The pubis (pubic bone) was very long, expanding both at the front and hind ends. It was wide and long, and its lower expansion was in diameter. Talbot found the pubis similar to that of the then yet undescribed Procompsognathus of Germany. Lull argued that the pubis lay approximately in position in the fossil, pointing forwards. Heilmann instead believed the bone had been moved out of position before burial, and would have been directed backwards. Colbert and Baird suggested the pubis was directed forwards, but that it curved slightly upwards instead of downwards due to natural warping and cracking of the bone. The ischium was long, wide at the end closest to the body, and the shaft was in diameter. Lull found it similar to those of Compsognathus and Ornitholestes. The femur was slender, nearly straight, had thin walls, and was expanded at the back side of its lower end. It was and in diameter just below the fourth trocanther. The fourth trocanther was 18 mm long and about 2 mm high, and was situated past the middle of the shaft, towards the lower end. The tibia was a thin, narrow shaft, in length, and about in diameter. The very thin fibula lay close to the tibia and was of almost equal length. The three metatarsals of the lower leg were closely appressed together forming a compact structure, similar to what was seen in Ornithomimus, but not fused into a tarsometatarsus, as seen in birds. The length of the metatarsals was , while their width was . Classification Lull's illustration of the pelvic region When reading her preliminary description in 1910, Talbot suggested Podokesaurus to have been an \\"herbivorous dinosaur\\", but further work at Yale Univerisity showed that some bones had been incorrectly identified, and the ischium of the pelvis with its well-developed ridge resembled that of Compsognathus. She refrained from making a definite classification of the specimen in her 1911 description due to the lack of jaw and foot-bones which could have aided in this, but concluded it would have belonged to a \\"carnivorous dinosaur\\" based on the shape and position of the pubic bone, as well as the absence of a postpubis. She considered the fossil to be Triassic in age. In 1914, von Huene named the new family Podokesauridae, in which he, in addition to Podokesaurus, included Saltopus, Procompsognathus, Coelophysis, and Tanystropheus. He placed this group under Coelurosauria, which at the time was used to include any small theropods. Heilmann's comparison between the legs and pelvis of Podokesaurus (1 with backwards directed pubis, 2 forwards directed) and Archaeopteryx (3) Heilmann considered Podokesaurus very similar to the early bird Archaeopteryx in 1913, and wondered why Talbot had not made any comparisons to it. He particularly found the legs and the pelvis, when the pubic was interpreted as rotated backward, similar to what it might look like in a bird ancestor. He also found parts of the shoulder blade, forelimbs, and even tail bones similar to those of birds. He furthermore pointed out the abdominal ribs and that the bones were hollow, and concluded that nothing precluded Podokesaurus from being a very primitive proto-bird, with not yet fused middle-foot bones. The only feature he found inconcistent with this interpretation was the short finger with a claw, if it was not instead part of a toe. He suggested that the issue could be determined if the skull, sternum, and clavicle were found in the rock. Heilmann found it surprising that Lull's reconstruction of Podokesaurus showed an even more apressed middle-foot than was present in the later supposed descendant Ornithomimus, which he thought would have developed a completely bird-like middle-foot by that time. He also found Lull's forward directed reconstruction of the pubis unlikely, and suggested it would instead have been directed backward. Heilmann found Podokesaurus very unusual for a dinosaur Triassic in age, and thought it was one of the earliest bipedal vertebrates. He suggested that since it was so different from Thecodontosaurus and Plateosaurus, those may not have been dinosaurs, or Podokesaurus could instead have been related to Saltopus or parasuchians, but founds its fossils too insufficient to say anything definite about the issue. He found dinosaurs and parasuchians closely related nonetheless, and had many similarities, as well as bird-like traits. Shufeldt elaborated on his and Heilmann's interpretation of the pubis in 1915, and stated the bone had probably been displaced during fossilization. He pointed out that if it had faced forward, it would have been in focible contact with the abdominal ribs and would have been dangerous for internal organs during movement. Lull found Heilmann and Shufeldt's criticisms of his pelvis reconstruction probable in 1915. He listed Podokesauridae under the superfamily Compsognatha, and suggested Podokesaurus was perhaps ancestral to the later American genera Ornitholestes and Ornithimimus. In 1916, Heilmann pointed out that early dinosaurs, parasuchians, and pterosaurs all had similarities to birds, as well as to each other, and that Triassic reptiles like Scleromochlus, Saltopus, and Podokesaurus, were difficult to separate. He proposed that Podokesaurus and other bipedal reptiles from the Triassic were descended from pseudosuchians (which many types of archosaurs were classified as at the time) which may have evolved bipedality already in the Permian. He concluded that birds were descended from ornithosuchian pseudosuchians rather than from dinosaurs, due to their bipedality and bird-like legs. The American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborne showed Podokesaurus as an example of a \\"carnivorous dinosaur of the bird-like type\\" in 1917, while stating similarities between birds and dinosaurs were due to parallel evolution. The paleontologist Franz Nopcsa von Fels≈ë-Szilv√°s created the subfamily Podokesaurinae in 1928, wherein he included Podokesaurus, Procerosaurus, Saltopus, and TanystropheusNopcsa, B. F. (1928) The genera of reptiles. Palaeobiologica, 1, 163‚Äì188., and von Huene added more taxa to the Podokesauridae family in 1932. Replica of a natural cast of bones assigned to C. holyokensis in 1964 (when Podokesaurus was suggested to be a synonym of Coelophysis) In 1958, Colbert and Baird described a theropod specimen (now MOS 2001.248) consisting of natural bone casts in sandstone, including a pubis, tibia, and some ribs. They found the specimen similar to Coelophysis and Podokesaurus, referring to it as C. sp. (of unknown species). They considered the natural cast and Podokesaurus to be from the Portland Formation of the Newark Group in the Connecticut valley. Though Podokesaurus was smaller than the others (being comparable in size to the smallest known Coelophysis specimens), these researchers suggested that because it was so similar to them, this raised questions as to its validity.Colbert E. H. and Baird, D., 1958, \\"Coelurosaur bone casts from the Connecticut Valley Triassic\\", Am. Mus. Novitates 1901: 1-11 In 1964, Colbert formally synomymized Podokesaurus with Coelophysis, (since the latter name was older), coining the new combination C. holyokensis. He also suggested that the C. sp. described in 1958 belonged to C. holyokensis. Colbert stated that Podokesaurus could only be distinguished from Coelophysis by its neural spines of the vertebrae not being as long from front to back, and because the ischium differed in shape. He found these differences to be similar to those seen between modern reptile species within the same genera, and that they represented Eastern (C. holyokensis) and Western (C. bauri) species of the same genus. While he admitted that these conclusions were not ironclad, and that Podokesaurus may indeed have been distinct, he said the burden of proof should be on the proponents of such a view. 1917 restorations of animals from the Connecticut Valley then thought to have lived during the Triassic. The Portland Formation, which Podokesaurus is from, was redated to the Early Jurassic in 1977 In 1977, the paleontologists Paul E. Olsen and Peter Galton redated the Newark Supergroup (which the Portland Formation belongs to) to the Early Jurassic instead of the preceding Triassic as was previously thought. Olsen stated in 1980 that while the exact provenance and systematic position of Podokesaurus will probably remain uncertain, the Portland Formation it was thought to be from was probably Early Jurassic in age, and therefore 15 million years younger than Coelophysis from the Triassic. Since features shared between Podokesaurus and Coelophysis are also known other small theropods, such as Syntarsus, Olsen suggested that Podokesaurus should be retained as a separate genus of indeterminate theropod, to avoid overextending the temporal range of Coelophysis. He also applied this argument to the natural cast, regarding it as incertae sedis among theropods rather than as Podokesaurus or Coelophysis.Olsen, P. E. 1980 . A comparison of the vertebrate assemblages from the Newark and Hartford Basins (early Mesozoic, Newark Supergroup) of eastern North America. In: Jacobs, L. L. (ed.). Aspects of Vertebrate History. Mus. No. Arizona Press, Flagstaff. Pp. 35‚Äì54. The paleontologist Samuel P. Welles stated in 1984 that the family Podokesauridae had become a \\"catch-all\\" for most Triassic theropod. While he thought Coelophysis the most similar among theropods, he found the two to differ greatly in that the fourth trocanther of the femur in Podokesaurus being below midheight (unlike the higher position in most other theropods), and its metatarsals were of equal length. The American paleontologist Kevin Padian stated in 1986 that while Colbert's suggestion of synonymy was possible, the discernible similarities between Podokesaurus and Coelophysis were primitive theropod features, and the two were not as close in time as once thought.Padian, Kevin, 1986, On the type material of Coelophysis Cope (Saurischia: Theropoda) and a new specimen from the Petrified Forest of Arizona (Late Triassic: Chinle Formation), in Padian, K. ed., The beginning of the age of dinosaurs: Faunal change across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary: Cambridge, U.K., Cambridge University Press, pp. 57-60. Paul said in 1988 that while the family Podokesauridae was still used for Coelophysis and kin, Podokesaurus was not based on good remains to begin with, and with only bad casts remaining, he thought there would always be disagreement about the taxon. He found this to be too much ambiguity to put up with, and proposed the name Coelophysidae should be used instead (Halticosauridae, another contender, was also based on too fragmentary remains). In 1989, Colbert also doubted the synonymy of Podokesaurus with Coelophysis, and that the bone casts belonged to the latter. In 1990, the paleontologists Timothy Rowe and Jacques Gauthier considered Podokesauridae a taxonomic waste-basket, wherein taxa had been grouped based on phenetic resemblance and stragigraphic division, and therefore under continuous revision and instability. They found it possible that Podokesaurus and the natural cast specimen were Coelophysis, but found that their similarities were not shared exclusively by them, but were ancestral features among theropods. They therefore agreed that the name Podokesaurus should be restricted to the holotype, and that it and the natural cast should be considered Theropoda incertae sedis. In the same volume, the paleontologist David B. Norman agreed with this assesment, and stated the features used to unite Podokesaurus with Coelophysis merely confirm that they were dinosaurs rather than establish a specific relation between them. The paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz agreed in 1994 that the family name Podokesauridae should be replaced by Coelophysidae. The paleontologists David B. Weishampel and Luther Young suggested ceratosaurian affinities for Podokesaurus in 1996.Weishampel, D. B., and Young, L. (1996): Dinosaurs of the East Coast. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. 275 pp. Mounted skeleton of Coelophysis, which is thought to have been similar to Podokesaurus The paleontologist Ronald S. Tykoski and Rowe noted in 2004 that while Podokesaurus had coelophysoid features (such as a small, knob-like expansion on the lower part of the pubis), it did not have any derived traits that would unite it with Coelophysis. They agreed with earlier researchers that the name Podokesaurus should be restricted to the holotype, and concluded that the natural cast specimen may be a coelophysoid, but could not be identified beyond being a theropod.Tykoski, R. S. & Rowe, T. (2004). \\"Ceratosauria\\". In: Weishampel, D. B., Dodson, P., & Osmolska, H. (Eds.) The Dinosauria (2nd edition). Berkeley: University of California Press. Pp. 68 In 2004, paleontologists Matthew T. Carrano and Scott D. Sampson stated that Podokesaurus was almost certainly a coelophysoid similar to Coelophysis. It had coelophysoid synapomorphies such as a long, downward curved pubis, which was longer than the ischium, and an additional foramen on the pubis, below the oburator opening, but little more could be said about its affinities. Carrano and colleagues stated in 2004 that Segisaurus and Podokesaurus were among the lates surviving coelophysoids, and that the radiation of this group may have ended by the latest part of the Early Jurassic. Also in 2004, the paleontologists Anthea Bristowe and Michael A. Raath listed Podokesaurus as a synonym of Coelophysis without elaboration. Tykoski rejected synonymy between the two in his 2005 dissertation, but left Podokesaurus out of the analysis. Paleobiology Heilmann's outdated 1913 restoration of Podokesaurus running near a lake Talbot suggested that the sort, slender humerus, long, straight hindlimb bones, and the well-developed fourth trocanther of the femur indicated that Podokesaurus was bipedal. That the tibia was much longer than the femur, and that the metatarsals, very very long, over half the length of the tibia, and the skeleton's light construction, were indicative of rapid locomotion. Talbot stated that Lull thought this was an adaptation to climactic conditions, as the animal must have been able to travel fast and far for water in its semi-arid region. Talbot also reported a small piece of smooth, polished quartz among the ribs, and suggested it could have been a gastrolith (stomach stone), and thereby the first time these were found with a carnivorous dinosaur. Lull found the animal to have been essentially a slender, cursorial animal, with carnivorous habits, but that the slenderness that made it swift also confined it to small prey. In 1932, von Huene suggested that Podokesaurus well-adapted for running, similar to some ratite birds. In 1982, the British paleontologist Tony Thulborn estimated the speed of various dinosaurs, based on the relationships between speed, gait, and body size of modern animals (mainly mammals). By extrapolating the stride length and cadence of Podokesaurus, he estimated it could have run . He concluded that if a dinosaur could match a mammal in speed, it must have had similar levels of efficiency in locomotor ability and physiology. He cautioned that comparison was difficult because dinosaur anatomy differed significantly from that of mammals and birds, including their massive tails, and hindlimb retractor muscles that originated behind the femur, while these muscles originate more forward. Weishampel stated in 2006 that as a coelophysoid, Podokesaurus would have been a fleet-footed predator, with powerful forelimbs and grasping hands. Grallator cursorius footprint, which Lull correlated with Podokesaurus Lull found that fossil footprints named Grallator cursorius agreed with the foot and stride of Podokesaurus. These were abundant at a quarry in South Hadley (where they were found alongside large Otozoum moodii tracks), which he thought supported this identity. In 1926, Heilmann suggested that the foot of Procompsognathus was a better match for the G. cursorius tracks, due to the proportions of its toe bones. The American paleontologist Wilhelm Bock stated in 1952 that while very similar Grallator tracks had been attributted to various small dinosaurs, he considered such correlations too specific, and that the best that could be said was such tracks represented small coelurosaurians. The writer Donald F. Glut suggested in 1997 that a slab with tracks from the Brunswick Formation of New York previously attributted to Coelophysis may instead have been produced by Podokesaurus, based on its Jurassic age. This formation is now known as the Passaic Formation, and instead thought to be Late Triassic in age. Paleoenvironment The only known specimen of Podokesaurus is thought to have been collected from the Portland Formation (earlier known as the Portland Arkose) in the Hartford Basin of Massachusetts. The age of this formation was long unclear (it was thought to be Triassic until 1977), but it is currently thought to date to the Hettangian-Sinemurian stages of the Early Jurassic, between 201 and 190 million years ago. In 2016, the paleontologist Robert E. Weems and colleagues suggested the Portland Formation should be eleveated to a geological group within the Newark Supergroup (as the Portland Group), and thereby replacing the former name \\"Agawam Group\\". They also reinstated the Longmeadow Sandstone, where Podokesaurus was found, as a formation (within the uppermost Portland Group), while it had earlier been considered identical to the Portland Formation. The Longmeadow Sandstone consists of fluvial (deposited by rivers and streams) red mudstones, sandstones, conglomerates, minor red eolian (affected by wind) sandstones and siltstones. Other animals known form the Portland Formation include the sauropodomorph dinosaur Anchisaurus, the crocodylomorph Stegomosuchus, and fish such as Acentrophorus and Semionotus. Podokesaurus was originally thought to have lived during the Late Triassic Period, which was later disproved.

Throughout antiquity and the Middle Ages until the 16th century, the weapons relied on were the ship itself, used as a battering ram or to sink the opponent with naval rams, the m√™l√©e weapons of the crew, missile weapons such as bolts from heavy crossbows fixed on the bulwarks, bows and arrows, weights dropped from a yard or pole rigged out, and the various means of setting an enemy alight. The latter could be done by shooting arrows with burning tow or by Greek fire ejected through specially designed siphons. All galley actions were fought at close quarters, where ramming and boarding were possible. But the use of the ram was only available for a vessel driven by oars. While fleets depended on the methods of battle at close quarters, two conditions were imposed on the warship: light structure, so that her crew could row her with effect, and a large crew to work her oars and fight in hand-to-hand combat. Sails were used by virtually all types of galleys, ancient and medieval, in long-range strategic maneuvers, and to relieve the rowers from absolutely exhausting toil. Sails were lowered in action, however, and when the combatant had a secure port at hand, they were left ashore before battle. Early tactics From the earliest times of naval warfare boarding was the only means of deciding a naval engagement, but little to nothing is known about the tactics involved. In the first recorded naval battle in history, the battle of the Delta, the forces of Egyptian Pharaoh Ramesses III won a decisive victory over a force made up of the enigmatic group known as the Sea Peoples. As shown in commemorative reliefs of the battle, Egyptian archers on ships and the nearby shores of the Nile rain down arrows on the enemy ships. At the same time Egyptian galleys engage in boarding action and capsize the ships of the Sea Peoples with ropes attached to grappling hooks thrown into the rigging.Wachsmann (1995), pp. 28-34, 72 Introduction of the ram A schematic reconstruction of a defensive circle of galleys seen from above. Around the 8th century BC, ramming began to be employed as war galleys were equipped with heavy bronze rams. Records of the Persian Wars in the early 5th century BC by the Ancient historian Herodotus (c. 484-425 BC) show that by this time ramming tactics had evolved among the Greeks. The formations could either be in columns in line ahead, one ship following the next, or in a line abreast, with the ships side by side, depending on the tactical situation and the surrounding geography. There were two primary methods for attack: by breaking through the enemy formation (diekplous) or by outflanking it (periplous). The diekplous involved a concentrated charge in line ahead so as to break a hole in the enemy line, allowing galleys to break through and then wheel to attack the enemy line from behind. The periplous involved outflanking or encircling the enemy so as to attack them in the vulnerable rear or side by line abreast.Morrison, Coates & Rankov (2000), pp. 42-43, 92-93 If one side knew that it had slower ships, a common tactic was to form a circle with the bows pointing outwards, thereby avoiding being outflanked. At a given signal, the circle could then fan out in all directions, trying to pick off individual enemy ships. To counter this formation, the attacking side would rapidly circle, feigning attacks in order to find gaps in the formation to exploit.Morrison, Coates & Rankov (2000), pp. 54-55, 72 Ramming itself was done by smashing into the rear or side of an enemy ship, punching a hole in the planking. This did not actually sink an ancient galley unless it was heavily laden with cargo and stores. With a normal load, it was buoyant enough to float even with a breached hull. It could also maneuver for some time as long as the oarsmen were not incapacitated, but would gradually lose mobility and become unstable as it flooded. The winning side would then attempt to tow away the swamped hulks as prizes. Breaking the enemy's oars was another way of rendering ships immobile, rendering them into easier targets. If ramming was not possible or successful, the on-board complement of soldiers would attempt to board and capture the enemy vessel by attaching to it with grappling irons. Accompanied by missile fire, either with bow and arrow or javelins. Trying to set the enemy ship on fire by hurling incendiary missiles or by pouring the content of fire pots attached to long handles is thought to have been used, especially since smoke below decks would easily disable rowers.John Coates (1995), pp. 133-35 The speed necessary for a successful impact depended on the angle of attack; the greater the angle, the lesser the speed required. At 60 degrees, 4 knots was enough to penetrate the hull, but this increased to 8 knots at 30 degrees. If the target for some reason was in motion towards the attacker, less speed was required, especially if the hit came amidships. War galleys gradually began to develop heavier hulls with reinforcing beams at the waterline, where a ram would most likely hit. There are records of a counter- tactic to this used by Rhodian ship commanders where they would angle down their bows to hit the enemy below the reinforced waterline belt. Besides ramming, breaking enemy oars was also a way to impede mobility and make it easier to drive home a successful ramming attack.John Coates (1995), p. 133 Boarding Despite the attempts to counter increasingly heavy ships, ramming tactics were superseded in the last centuries BC by the Macedonians and Romans who were primarily land-based powers. Hand-to-hand fighting with large complements of heavy infantry supported by ship-borne catapults dominated the fighting style during the Roman era, a move that was accompanied by the conversion to heavier ships with larger rowing complements and more men per oar. Though effectively lowering mobility, it meant that less skill was required from individual oarsmen. Fleets thereby became less dependent on rowers with a lifetime of experience at the oar.Morrison, Coates & Rankov (2000), pp. 48-49 Success in ramming depended so much on a combination of skill and good fortune that it played a somewhat subordinate part in most ancient sea fights. The Romans baffled the ramming tactics of the Carthaginians by the invention of the corvus, or crow, a plank with a spike for hooking onto enemy ships which grappled the prow of the rammer, and provided a gangway for boarders. It's not certain whether the weight of the corvus destabilized Roman ships and led to whole fleets being lost in storms. The Romans did continue their boarding tactics in the naval battles of the Punic Wars, but are also reported as ramming the Carthaginian vessels after the abandonment of the corvus. An older and alternative way for boarding was the use of grappling hooks and planks, also a more flexible system than the corvus. Agrippa introduced a weapon with a function similar to the corvus, the harpax. =Middle Ages= By late antiquity, in the 1st centuries AD, ramming tactics had completely disappeared along with the knowledge of the original trireme and its high speed and mobility. The ram was replaced by a long spur in the bow that was designed to break oars and to act as a boarding platform for storming enemy ships. The only remaining examples of ramming tactics was passing references to attempts to collide with ships in order to roll it over on its side.Hocker (1995), pp. 95, 98-99. With the collapse of the unified Roman empire came the revival of large fleet actions. The Byzantine navy, the largest Mediterranean war fleet throughout most of the early Middle Ages, employed crescent formations with the flagship in the center and the heavier ships at the horns of the formation, in order to turn the enemy's flanks. Similar tactics are believed to have been employed by the Arab fleets they frequently fought from the 7th century onwards. The Byzantines were the first to employ Greek fire, a highly effective incendiary liquid, as a naval weapon. It could be fired through a metal tube, or siphon mounted in the bows, similar to a modern flame thrower. The properties of Greek fire were close to that of napalm and was a key to several major Byzantine victories. By 835, a similar weapon had spread to the Arabs, who equipped harraqas, \\"fireships\\", with it, though they never managed to quite replicate the Greek fire, which was a closely guarded state secret. Byzantine ship attacking with Greek fire. Madrid Skylitzes manuscript, 11th century. Once the fleets were close enough, exchanges of missiles began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows, caltrops and javelins. The aim was not to sink ships, but to deplete the ranks of the enemy crews before the boarding commenced, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy vessel and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. On Byzantine galleys, the brunt of the fighting was done by heavily armed and armored troops called hoplites or kataphraktoi. These would attempt to stab the rowers through the oarports to reduce mobility, and then join the mel√©e. If boarding was not deemed advantageous, the enemy ship could be pushed away with poles. Later medieval navies continued to use similar tactics, with the line abreast (i.e. side by side) formation as standard. As galleys were intended to be fought from the bows, and were at their weakest along the sides, especially in the middle. The crescent formation employed by the Byzantines continued to be used throughout the Middle Ages. It would allow the wings of the fleet to crash their bows straight into the sides of the enemy ships at the edge of the formation.Pryor (1983), pp. 193-94 Middle Ages also saw the introduction of forecastle and aftcastle, raised platforms on the fore and aft of the ship, which would provide archers with a raised platform for shooting down at enemies and a stronghold in case the ship was boarded. =Early modern period= Contemporary depiction of the battle of Lepanto in 1571 that shows the strict formations of the opposing fleets. Fresco in the Gallery of Maps in Vatican Museum. In large-scale galley engagements tactics remained essentially the same until the end of the 16th century. The same basic crescent formation in line abreast that was employed at the battle of Lepanto in 1571 was used by the Byzantine fleet almost a millennium earlier.Guilmartin (1974), pp. 157-58 The practical maximum size of the front ranks of a galley formation was about 65 ships in the center with another 53-54 ships on the left and right wings.Guilmartin (1974), pp. 201‚Äì2 Cannons and small firearms were introduced around the 14th century, but did not have any immediate effect on tactics. If anything, the forward offensive power of galleys was accentuated by naval artillery.Glete (2003), p. 35 Artillery on early gun galleys was not used as a long-range standoff weapon against other gun-armed galleys. The maximum distance at which contemporary cannons were effective, c. 500 m (1600 ft), could be covered by a galley in about two minutes, much faster than the reload time of any artillery piece. Gun crews would therefore hold their fire until the last possible moment, somewhat similar to infantry tactics in the pre-industrial era of short range firearms.Guilmartin (1974), pp. 199-200 The bow guns would often be loaded with scatter shot and other anti-personnel ammunition. The effect of an assault with a gun-armed galley could often be dramatic, as exemplified by an account from 1528 where a galley of Genoese commander Antonio Doria. On board the ship of Sicilian Don Hugo de Moncada he witnessed how a single volley from a basilisk, two demi-cannons and four smaller guns killed 40 men.Guilmartin (1974), pp. 200-1 The estimated average speed of Renaissance-era galleys was fairly low, only 3 to 4 knots, and a mere 2 knots when holding formation. Short bursts of up to 7 knots were possible for about 20 minutes, but only at the risk of exhausting rowers. This made galley actions relatively slow affairs, especially when they involved fleets of 100 vessels or more.Guilmartin (1974), pp. 203-5 The weak points of a galley remained the sides and especially the rear, the command center, and were the preferred targets of any attacker. Unless one side managed to outmaneuver the other, battle would be met with ships crashing into each other head on. Once the fighting began with galleys locking on to one another bow to bow, the fighting would be over the front line ships. Unless one was completely taken over by a boarding party, fresh troops could be fed into the fight from reserve vessels in the rear.Guilmartin (1974), pp. 248-49 In a defensive position with a secure shoreline, galleys could be beached stern first with its guns pointing out to sea. This made for a very strong defensive position, allowed rowers and sailors to escape to safety on land, leaving only soldiers and fighting men to defend against an assault.Guilmartin (1974), p. 53 See also *Sailing ship tactics *Naval artillery in the Age of Sail *Naval tactics in the Age of Steam *Modern naval tactics Notes References *Guilmartin, John Francis, Gunpowder and Galleys: Changing Technology and Mediterranean Warfare at Sea in the Sixteenth Century.

He is best known as the creator of the cartoon panel Hazel, which was later the basis for a television series of the same name, and also the creator of Peabody's Improbable History. College to cartoons Born in Fresno, California, Key was the son of Latvian immigrant Simon Keyser, who had changed his name from Katseff to Keyser, and then to \\"Key\\" during World War I. Though his family thereafter went by Key, Theodore Keyser did not legally adopt the name until the 1950s. Attending the University of California, Berkeley, Key became the art editor of the student newspaper, The Daily Californian, and was associate editor of the campus humor magazine, the California Pelican and was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity.Membership Directory, 2010, Pi Lambda Phi Inc. After graduating from college in 1933, Key relocated to New York City, where he published cartoons and illustrations in a number of periodicals, including Better Homes and Gardens, Collier's, The New Yorker, Ladies' Home Journal, Good Housekeeping, McCall's, Cosmopolitan, TV Guide, Mademoiselle, Look and Judge. Key also worked as associate editor of Judge in 1937. Hazel right Key's most famous creation, the single-panel Hazel, about a wry and bossy household maid, came to Key in 1943 in a dream that he drew the next morning and sent to The Saturday Evening Post, where it was accepted and began running regularly. He soon afterward gave the character a name and employment at the Baxter household. In 2008, the cartoonist's son, Peter Key, said, \\"He picked the name Hazel out of the air, but there was an editor at The Post who had a sister named Hazel. She thought her brother came up with the name, and she didn‚Äôt speak to him for two years.\\" The cartoon ran until the weekly magazine ceased publication in 1969. Hazel was then picked up for newspaper syndication by King Features Syndicate.Hazel at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 13, 2012. With the increased output of six cartoons a week, Key hired veteran gag cartoonist Stan Fine to lend a hand. Key later adapted his comic panel into the television show Hazel, starring Shirley Booth as the titular maid. It ran from 1961 to 1964 on NBC; for its final 1965 season, the show switched to CBS. Key continued to draw the strip until his retirement in 1993. King Features reprints panels in over 50 newspapers as of 2008. Films and television Key's other work in the comics field includes Diz and Liz, a two-page feature that ran in Jack and Jill magazine from 1961 to 1972, as well as conceiving and creating Peabody's Improbable History, the original Peabody segment for producer Jay Ward's animated television series The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. Key also provided illustrations for the long-running \\"Positive Attitude\\" series of motivational pamphlets and posters, published biweekly by Economics Press Inc. from the 1960s to the 1980s. Radio Key also wrote radio plays during the 1930s and 1940s. His radio drama, The Clinic, broadcast on NBC, was chosen for Max Wylie's Best Broadcasts of 1939-40 anthology. Films and books He was the screenwriter for three Disney films (The Cat from Outer Space, Million Dollar Duck and Gus), and he created several classic children's books, including Phyllis and The Biggest Dog in the World (later adapted into the film Digby, the Biggest Dog in the World). During World War II, Key served with the U.S. Army from 1943 to 1946, primarily in public relations, where he wrote a play aimed at recruiting women into military service. Key retired in 1993, but King Features continued to syndicate Hazel using material he had prepared for his retirement. Hazel still runs today in some 50 newspapers. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in late 2006, Key suffered a stroke in September 2007. He was 95 at the time of his death in Tredyffrin Township, Pennsylvania. Key was married twice; his first wife, Anne, died in 1984, and Key was survived by second wife Bonnie and by three sons: Stephen, David and Peter. Awards In 1977, Key received the National Cartoonists Society Newspaper Panel Award for his work on Hazel.

The film also features Scott Glenn, Michael Par√©, and Danny DeVito in minor roles, with voice narration by Giovanni Ribisi. The Virgin Suicides is based on the 1993 best selling debut novel of the same name by the American author Jeffrey Eugenides. The film follows the lives of five adolescent sisters, in an upper-middle-class suburb of Detroit during the late 1970s. After the youngest sister, Cecilia, makes an initial attempt at suicide, all of the girls are put under close scrutiny by their parents, eventually being confined to their home, which leads to their increasingly depressive and isolated behavior. As in the novel, the film is told in first person plural, from the perspective of a group of adolescent boys in the neighbourhood who are fascinated by the girls. Shot in 1998 in Toronto, the film was director Sofia Coppola's debut feature. It features an original score by the French electronic band Air. The film premiered at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, and received a limited theatrical release on April 21, 2000 in the United States, later expanding to a wide release in May 2000. The film was met with largely positive critical reception, with both the performances and Coppola's direction receiving note. It was also praised for its lyrical representation of adolescent angst, visual style, and soundtrack, and is now recognized as a cult classic. In 2015, the film ranked number 39 on Entertainment Weekly's list of the \\"50 Best High School Movies\\". The film marked the beginning of a working relationship between Coppola and star Kirsten Dunst, whom Coppola would cast as the lead in several films in the following years. Plot In the suburbs of Grosse Pointe, Michigan, a group of neighborhood boys‚Äînow grown men‚Äîreflect upon their memories of the five Lisbon sisters, ages 13 to 17, in the late 1970s. Unattainable due to their overprotective parents, math teacher Ronald Lisbon and his homemaker wife Sara, the girls‚ÄîTherese, Mary, Bonnie, Lux, and Cecilia‚Äîare enigmas who fill the boys' conversations and dreams. During the summer, the youngest sister, Cecilia, slits her wrist in a bathtub, though she survives. After her parents allow her sisters to throw a chaperoned basement party intended to make Cecilia feel better, she excuses herself and successfully ends her life by leaping from her second story bedroom onto a spiked iron fencepost. In the wake of Cecilia's suicide, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from their community and heightens the air of mystery surrounding the girls, particular to the neighborhood boys. At the beginning of the new school year in the fall, Lux forms a secret and short-lived romance with Trip Fontaine, the school heartthrob. In hopes of becoming closer to Lux, Trip comes over to the Lisbon residence and watches television with the family. Trip persuades Mr. Lisbon to allow him to take Lux to the homecoming dance by promising to provide dates for Therese, Mary and Bonnie, and going as a group. After winning homecoming King and Queen, Trip persuades Lux to ditch their group and have sex on the football field. Afterwards, Lux falls asleep and Trip abandons her. At dawn, Lux wakes up alone on the football field, and has to take a taxi home. Having broken curfew, Lux and her sisters are punished by a paranoid Mrs. Lisbon by being taken out of school and confined to the house indefinitely. Isolated and increasingly depressed, the sisters contact the boys across the street by using light signals and sharing records over the telephone to express their emotions. During this time, Lux rebels against her parents and becomes overtly promiscuous, having anonymous sexual encounters on the roof of her house late at night; the neighborhood boys spy from across the street. After months of confinement, the sisters begin to leave notes outside for the boys. The girls eventually send a final note to the boys asking them to come over at midnight, ostensibly to escape from their house. When the boys finally arrive that night, they find Lux alone in the living room, smoking a cigarette. Thinking they're going to help the girls escape, the boys are invited inside by Lux to wait for her sisters, while she goes to start the car. Curious, the boys wander into the basement after hearing a noise and discover Bonnie's body hanging from the ceiling rafters. Horrified, the boys rush back upstairs, only to stumble across the body of Mary in the kitchen. The boys then realize that the girls had all killed themselves in an apparent suicide pact moments earlier: Bonnie hanged herself; Mary put her head in the gas oven; Therese overdosed on sleeping pills; and Lux died of carbon monoxide poisoning by leaving the car engine running in the garage. Devastated by the suicides of all their children, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon quietly flee the neighborhood and are never seen again. Mr. Lisbon has a friend clean out the house and sell the family belongings in a yard sale; family photos and other mementos are put out with the trash and collected by the boys. The house is sold to a young couple from the Boston area. Unsure of how to react to the events, the adults in the community go about their lives as if nothing important really happened, but the boys cannot stop thinking about the Lisbon sisters and why they did what they did. Now middle-aged men themselves, they acknowledge that they had always loved the girls, and that the mystery surrounding their deaths will torment them for the rest of their lives.

Another script had already been written by Nick Gomez, but the production company that owned the rights at the time, Muse Productions, was dissatisfied with the script. After the rights to the novel lapsed, Coppola pitched her manuscript to Muse executives Roberta and Chris Hanley, the latter of whom signed on to co- produce. Coppola was inspired to write the film after reading the source novel: \\"I really didn't know I wanted to be a director until I read The Virgin Suicides and saw so clearly how it had to be done,\\" she said. \\"I immediately saw the central story as being about what distance and time and memory do to you, and about the extraordinary power of the unfathomable.\\"  =Casting= Kathleen Turner was the first actor to sign on to the project, playing the Lisbon girls' oppressive mother; Turner had known Coppola after they co-starred together in Peggy Sue Got Married (1986). James Woods was cast opposite Turner as the passive father; Woods was given the script by Coppola's father, Francis, and was so impressed by the script and the character's \\"dark humor\\" that he agreed to play the role. For the part of Lux, Coppola auditioned numerous actresses, but had a \\"gut choice\\" of Kirsten Dunst, who was sixteen years old at the time of her casting. Reflecting on the role, Dunst said: \\"I was nervous. It was my first role that was more of a 'sexy' thing. I was also unsure about how large the role was gonna be, because a lot of it was without dialogue. When I met Sofia, I immediately knew that she would handle it in a delicate way... [she] really brought out the luminous aspect of the girls; she made them like ethereal angels, almost like they weren't really there.\\" =Filming= The Virgin Suicides was filmed in 1999 in Toronto, Ontario, standing in for suburban Detroit, Michigan, on a reported budget of US$6 million. The shoot lasted roughly one month. Coppola was inspired by photographer Takashi Homma's photos of suburban Japan when choosing the filming locations; \\"I have always been struck by the beauty of banal details,\\" she said, \\"and that is what suburban style is all about.\\" The film's occasional use of stills and collages was intended to evoke the \\"fantasia\\" of adolescence. Cinematographer Edward Lachman shot the film. Coppola's brother, Roman Coppola, was the second-unit director on the film. Music =Score= =Soundtrack= In addition to original score composed for the film by Air, the film features songs by 1970s-era performers and five tracks from the 1990s by Sloan. Sofia Coppola wanted to convey the theme of adolescence in the suburbs in the soundtrack. She found that Air shared many of her suburban memories and experiences even though they grew up in a different country. A separate soundtrack album was released in 2000 featuring music from Todd Rundgren, Steely Dan, Boston, Heart, Sloan, The Hollies, Al Green, Gilbert O'Sullivan, 10cc, Styx, and two tracks by Air (one previously recorded; one composed for the film). =Track listing= Release The film had its world premiere at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival on May 19. It was given a limited release in the United States almost a year later on April 21, 2000. The theatrical release would expand to a wide release in May 2000. =Critical reception= The Virgin Suicides received positive reviews from film critics, though some noted the film's discomforting thematic material. It holds a 77% approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 99 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.03/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Virgin Suicides drifts with a dreamlike melancholy that may strike some audiences as tedious, but Sofia Coppola's feature debut is a mature meditation on disaffected youth.\\" On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 76 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Jeffrey Eugenides visited the set of the film for three days. He supported the film, but he did offer a few critiques in an interview with \\"Dazed\\". Eugenides envisioned the girls as more of an entity than actual people; he believed this idea could have been accomplished by casting different actresses to play the same character with each actress changing depending on whom they are speaking to. Graham Fuller of The New York Times gave the film a middling review, writing: \\"Ms. Coppola has made [...] a haunting metaphysical celebration of adolescence with the aura of a myth. Yet, on the surface, there is something wrong with this picture: how can a film in which a quintet of apparently normal girls commit suicide possibly be a celebration, and why would a filmmaker attempt to make it so unless she is uncommonly perverse?\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a positive review, unanimously praising Coppola's direction, the cast, and the production design, but also noted that while the film \\"is successfully venturesome... you need to know that it's also a real downer.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half out of four stars, and positively compared it to Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975): \\"[Coppola] has the courage to play it in a minor key,\\" he notes. \\"She doesn't hammer home ideas and interpretations. She is content with the air of mystery and loss that hangs in the air like bitter poignancy.\\" Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine noted the film's dreamy, childlike nature, writing: \\"The narrator speaks of youth as if it existed and still exists in a near-fugue state. In this respect, the film is as much a relevant view of adolescence and male/female relations as it is an act of remembrance. Scenes from the film (first kisses, gossiping about neighbors) are sinewy in nature and seem lifted from the pages of a lost photo album.\\" Critic Richard Crouse called the film \\"one of those rare occasions when a film surpasses the book it is based on,\\" and included it in his book The 100 Best Movies You've Never Seen (2003).

The government suspended the constitution and ruled by decree until a factional conflict broke out, culminating in an invasion by the United States on 25 October 1983.  History  The New Jewel Movement (NJM) under the leadership of Maurice Bishop was the main opposition party in Grenada during the 1970s. In 1979, the NJM overthrew the government of Eric Gairy, which had ruled the country since independence in 1974. The NJM launched an armed takeover of the radio station, police barracks, and various other key locations in Grenada while Gairy was on a trip outside the country. The armed takeover was conducted by the National Liberation Army (NLA), which had been formed in 1973 as the military wing of the NJM.Joseph Ewart Layne, We Move Tonight: The Making of the Grenada Revolution, (Grenada Revolution Memorial Foundation, 2014), 2-3. The NJM suspended the constitution and announced new laws. Maurice Bishop announced the formation of the PRG over radio, which organized a cabinet to run the country with Bishop as prime minister. All political organizations except for the NJM were banned, and membership in the NJM was thereafter tightly controlled. Maurice Bishop expressed his objective: \\"We are a small country, we are a poor country, with a population of African slave descendants, we are part of the exploited Third World and, definitively, our challenge is to seek the creation of a new international order that puts the economy at the service of the people and social justice\\". The new government worried the United States, which had previously supported Eric Gairy, and whose ambassador warned: \\"The United States government would dislike any inclination on the part of the Grenadines to develop closer ties with Cuba. The regime was particularly active in developing social policies: a Centre for Popular Education was established to coordinate government initiatives in education, including literacy campaigns. The learning of Grenada Creole was allowed at school. Nevertheless, the Bishop government's tendency to marginalize the Church's role in education contributed to the deterioration of relations with the clergy. In the health sector, medical consultations were made free of charge with the help of Cuba, which provided doctors, and milk was distributed to pregnant women and children. In economics, the authorities were setting up a system of financial loans and equipment for farmers, and agricultural cooperatives were being set up to develop the activity. The Bishop government was also working to develop infrastructure, including building new roads and upgrading the power grid. Finally, the government was attacking marijuana growing operations to promote food agriculture and reduce violence. The PRG established close relations with the government of Cuba and, with Cuban assistance began construction of a large international airport. Internationally, Grenada was increasingly isolated. The United Kingdom suspended its economic assistance and the United States used its influence to block loans from the IMF and the World Bank. The situation was also deteriorating internally: on 19 June 1980, a bomb exploded during a meeting during which Bishop was to intervene. The device killed three people and wounded 25. Bishop openly accused \\"American imperialism and its local agents\\". However, the real responsibility of the CIA was uncertain; if it had indeed imagined destabilization operations, the Carter administration was opposed to them. In 1983, Bishop finally went to Washington to try to \\"negotiate peace\\". Literacy and health statistics improved dramatically during Bishop's tenure, but economic woes led to a crisis. In 1983, internal divisions occurred within the central committee of the PRG. A group led by Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard, a hard-line militaristic element, attempted to convince Bishop to enter into a power-sharing agreement with Coard. Eventually Coard placed Bishop under house arrest and took control of the PRG government. The removal of Bishop led to large popular demonstrations in different areas of the country. In the course of one of these demonstrations, Bishop was freed by the crowd, and eventually reached the PRA headquarters at Fort Rupert. A unit from the PRA (People's Revolutionary Army) at Fort Frederick was dispatched to Fort Rupert. Fighting broke out between that force and the civilians at Fort Rupert resulting in many deaths. Afterwards, Bishop and seven others, including several cabinet ministers, were rounded up and executed. After the executions, a new government called the Revolutionary Military Council, led by General Hudson Austin, was formed to rule the country and the PRG ceased to exist. This government nominally ruled for six days before being ousted by the United States invasion of Grenada.

He is author of more than 50 books, including Total Forgiveness. Kendall is currently listed as part of the Word, Spirit & Power team, a non-denominational Charismatic ministry.Word, Spirit, & Power conferences Early life and family Kendall was born July 13, 1935 in Ashland, Kentucky and named after R. T. Williams who was a General Superintendent of the Church of the Nazarene. He married Louise Wallis of Sterling, Illinois on June 28, 1958, and together they raised a son and a daughter, Robert Tillman II (TR) and Melissa Louise. According to his testimony, Kendall came to a conviction regarding Calvinist theology and his own eternal security in 1955. He received degrees at Trevecca Nazarene University in Nashville, Tennessee (A.B., 1970), the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary (M.Div., 1972) in Louisville, Kentucky and the University of Louisville (M.A., 1973) before earning a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) at Regent's Park College, a hall of the University of Oxford. He later received a Doctor of Divinity from Trevecca Nazarene University (1988). Ministry While at Oxford, Kendall was pastor of Calvary Baptist Church in Lower Heyford from 1974 to 1977 (now Brackley Baptist Church) which mainly served USAF families based at RAF Upper Heyford and RAF Croughton. From February 1, 1977 to February 1, 2002 he was the Minister at Westminster Chapel in London. He succeeded Dr. Glyn Owen who himself followed Martyn Lloyd-Jones and G. Campbell Morgan. Kendall is well known for his view that later Calvinism departed from the teaching of John Calvin on the issues of assurance and the extent of the atonement. Kendall expounded his views in his D.Phil. thesis, The Nature of saving Faith, from William Perkins (d. 1602) to the Westminster Assembly (1642‚Äì1649) and his 1981 work Calvin and English Calvinism to 1649. Kendall's views prompted a response by Paul Helm, who wrote Calvin and the Calvinists in 1982. Kendall's 1983 publication of Once Saved, Always Saved on the nature of Christian perseverance prompted debate of antinomianism among Chapel members and others.Macleod, Donald. (June 1984) The Monthly Record of the Free Church of Scotland.Thomas, Derek (January 1984) Evangelical Presbyterian pp. 2ff. There were various disagreements over various issues. Indeed, so serious were these, that his predecessor, Lloyd-Jones, stated that Kendall should take no part in his funeral arrangements: His charismatic beliefs and affirmation of prophecies and association with Paul Cain and the Kansas City Prophets from the early 1990s led to some controversies with some Christian groups. A longtime member of Westminster Chapel had the following testimony regarding Kendall's preaching legacy: He instigated a \\"Pilot Lights\\" scheme of church members distributing tracts and orange stickers such as \\"Turn on to Jesus\\" and \\"Jesus Loves You\\" initially led by Arthur Blessitt on the streets of Westminster in different languages to the general public. These evangelism techniques were based on those of Arthur Blessitt who preached at Westminster Chapel for a few weeks along with Sherry Blessitt and their children in the late 1980s. The scheme continued for about a decade. As a result, significant number of conversions were witnessed and some even joined the congregation and became active members. Despite that, church membership declined over the same period. His \\"School of Theology\\" evenings attracted hundreds of visitors and church leaders from all over London. He introduced Thursday lunchtime services, which were visited by workers from nearby Whitehall. In 2002 he was introduced by the Archbishop of Canterbury's Envoy to the Middle East to meet the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.https://rtkendallministries.com/yasser-arafat Subsequently, the men met five times and RT Kendall had an opportunity to present the Christian gospel (The Christian belief that by putting their faith in Jesus Christ and His Substitutionary death by crucifixion that they will be forgiven by God, have a relationship with him on earth and go the Heaven when they die).http://www.christiantoday.com/article/yasser.arafat.may.have.become.a.christian.claims.rt.kendall/42751.htm Kendall is now in retirement in Hendersonville, Tennessee, from where he continues his work as an author and guest speaker at Christian conferences. He appears on Christian TV programmes and is a regular contributor to Christian publications.http://www.christianitymagazine.co.uk/features/godtoldmereally.aspx?external=ignite He is also the President of R.T.

He is the cousin of Onix Concepci√≥n (another former MLB player). Primarily a second baseman, Lind was highly regarded for his defensive skills, winning a Gold Glove award in 1992; That same year, however, he committed a crucial fielding error in the ninth inning of the 7th game of the National League Championship Series (NLCS) that led to a come-from-behind victory for the Atlanta Braves. Playing career In 1982, Lind began his professional career by signing with the Pittsburgh Pirates as an undrafted free agent. He did not hit for much power as a prospect, totaling only four home runs in five minor league seasons, but his strong defense helped him ensure a place in the organization's plans. Lind made his major league debut with the Pirates on August 28, , and the next day the Pirates traded incumbent second baseman Johnny Ray to the California Angels, clearing the full-time role for Lind. Lind would go on to play regularly for the Pirates for five more seasons, including the 1990‚Äì1992 squads that were the champions of the NL East. He never again equaled his rookie batting average of .322, but he contributed a strong defensive presence, winning a Gold Glove in 1992, which broke Ryne Sandberg's string of nine consecutive National League Gold Glove awards at second base and was the first by a Pirate second baseman since Bill Mazeroski's string of five consecutive awards from 1963‚Äì1967. He also acquired a reputation for whimsical behavior, as one might expect from a man nicknamed \\"Chico\\" (Spanish for \\"Boy\\"). The photo on his 1991 Upper Deck baseball card shows him jumping over the head of 5'11\\" teammate Mike LaValliere, and he often surprised fellow players in the clubhouse by playfully brandishing one of the many knives he kept in his locker. After the 1992 season, the Pirates traded Lind to the Kansas City Royals for Dennis Moeller and Joel Johnston. His performance declined in Kansas City, and at some point he began to use cocaine. He walked out on the Royals in the middle of 1995 after his wife filed for divorce, and they placed him on waivers shortly thereafter. The California Angels put in a claim, and he finished the year with them as a reserve. 1995 was Lind's last major league season. He finished his career with a .254 batting average, a .295 on-base percentage, and a .316 slugging percentage in 3,677 at bats. Defensively, he recorded a .988 fielding percentage playing every inning at second base. Off-field problems Lind's personal life continued to spiral out of control. Police were called to the home of his ex-wife, Lizza Lind, in July 1996, when he visited in violation of a restraining order and the situation escalated to physical violence, which was witnessed by his daughters. They arrested him for possession of cocaine, and he pleaded guilty to that charge in February of the next year. On November 21, 1997, highway police in Tampa, Florida stopped Lind for leaving the scene of an accident. They discovered that he was visibly intoxicated, and that he had been driving while naked from the waist down. A search of his car revealed seven cans of beer and one gram of cocaine. Lind ended up spending a year in jail. Managing career Lind underwent rehabilitation to compensate for his addiction, and after his release from prison he signed with the Bridgeport Bluefish as a player/coach. When manager Duffy Dyer left to take a position with the New York Mets in February 2003, Lind was promoted to fill the vacant position. In 2006, Jos√© was replaced as manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish by former MLB Journeyman Dave LaPoint.

It was the eleventh named storm, eighth hurricane, and the sixth and final major hurricane of the 2004 season. Karl formed on September 16, originating from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the coast of Africa. It rapidly intensified, becoming a major hurricane on two occasions. Karl peaked as a strong Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale on September 21 with 145 mph (230 km/h) winds. It weakened as it moved northward, becoming extratropical on September 24 in the north Atlantic before it was absorbed by another system on September 28. The extratropical storm affected the Faroe Islands, but no damage was reported there, nor were there any fatalities. Meteorological history Karl originated in a strong tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 13. The wave gradually became better organized, and it was declared Tropical Depression Twelve about 670 miles (1,080 km) west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands on the morning of September 16, as it headed westward in the open tropical Atlantic following the periphery of the subtropical ridge. That afternoon, the depression continued to rapidly organize and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Karl. Due to healthy outflow around an upper-level anticyclone over Karl and a favorable environment with the warmest sea surface temperatures of the year, rapid deepening began on the evening of September 17, with the storm developing a small eye and being upgraded to Hurricane Karl. With water around 28¬∞C (83¬∞F) and low wind shear, the cyclone continued to rapidly intensify on the morning of September 18. The intensity leveled off somewhat that afternoon as a strong Category 2 hurricane with winds of 110 mph (175 km/h). Late in the evening of September 18, Karl attained Category 3 status, becoming the sixth major hurricane of 2004. On September 19, Karl continued to strengthen, maintaining a well-defined eye, and strengthening late that day into a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 948 mbar. Early on September 20, the storm weakened slightly as a result of an eyewall replacement cycle, weakening back to a strong Category 3 hurricane. At this time Karl began to turn sharply northward into a weakness in the subtropical ridge. After intensification stopped on September 20 due to the eyewall cycle and slightly increased wind shear, Karl quickly restrengthened that evening over very warm water, and early on September 21 reached its peak intensity as a powerful Category 4 hurricane with 145 mph (230 km/h) winds and a minimum central pressure of 938 mbar. That morning, as Karl was moving northward, another eyewall replacement cycle began to take place and vertical shear increased, again weakening the storm temporarily. The trend continued into the evening, and the storm weakened to a Category 2 hurricane by early on September 22. The weakening trend slowed and eventually leveled off that afternoon with Karl remaining a Category 2 hurricane as the storm turned towards the north-northeast. Late that evening, Karl began to restrengthen once again as wind shear diminished. The intensification continued into the morning of September 23, as Karl became a major hurricane a second time, reaching a final peak of 125 mph (205 km/h) winds. Hurricane Karl becoming extratropical on September 24 Cooler waters and increased shear soon prevailed, however, and the storm quickly weakened, dropping to a Category 1 hurricane by late that evening as the low-level circulation became detached from the mid-level circulation due to the strong southwesterly vertical wind shear. Early on September 24, Karl continued its north-northeast track over the open north-central Atlantic and continued to gradually weaken. It started to come in contact with the baroclinic zone and began to lose tropical characteristics, while still a Category 1 hurricane. Karl became extratropical shortly afterward over the northern Atlantic at about 47¬∞N, with its winds dropping below hurricane strength shortly thereafter. The extratropical storm made landfall on the Faroe Islands with hurricane-force wind gusts. As an extratropical low, the cyclone moved northeastward and eastward across the North Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea, eventually reaching Norway before it was absorbed into another extratropical low late on September 28. Impact Karl made landfall on Norway as an extratropical storm with sustained winds near 70 mph (110 km/h) and with wind gusts up to 89 mph (144 km/h). No damages or deaths were reported, and no ships came directly into contact with Karl; the strongest winds reported were from the ship Rotterdam, which reported 52 mph (83 km/h) sustained winds in the north Atlantic while Karl was a Category 1 storm in extratropical transition.

In 1987, to capitalize on his growing success in Europe, Prince toured extensively to promote the album of the same name and sales increased accordingly. However, the United States remained resistant to his latest album, and sales began to drop; it was at this point that Prince decided to film a live concert promoting the new material, for eventual distribution to theaters in America. It featured the band that accompanied Prince on his 1987 Sign o' the Times Tour: dancer Cat Glover, keyboardist Boni Boyer, bassist Levi Seacer Jr., guitarist Miko Weaver, drummer Sheila E., keyboardist Doctor Fink, and the horn section of Eric Leeds and Atlanta Bliss; Wally Safford and Greg Brooks (of The Bodyguards from the Revolution era) reprised their roles as dancers, vocalists, and comic foils. The film sees the group perform live on stage; although \\"U Got the Look\\", featuring Sheena Easton, is represented by its promotional music video. Background The film was originally intended to consist of live material filmed in the Ahoy in Rotterdam, Netherlands on June 26‚Äì28 and in the Sportpaleis in Antwerp, Belgium on June 29. However, the footage from these concerts was deemed unsatisfactory, partly due to the film being grainy and unusable, but also because Prince was not satisfied with the sound. Sound engineer Michiel Hoogenboezem stated in Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant that the recording itself was good. Consequently, the live performance was reshot at Prince's Paisley Park Studios (where the between-song segues were also filmed). According to saxophonist Eric Leeds, around 80% of the final film was drawn from the Paisley Park reshoot.Hahn, A: \\"Possessed: The Rise & Fall Of Prince\\", Billboard, 2003. Most of the songs are linked by a themed narrative and many film critics were quick to praise Prince as being a better actor live than in the previous year's unsuccessful romantic comedy Under the Cherry Moon. In total, 13 songs appear on the video - 11 from Sign o' the Times and two others - a brief piano version of \\"Little Red Corvette\\" and a cover version of Charlie Parker's \\"Now's the Time\\" (performed without Prince and showcasing each member of the band). Initially, there had been plans to include the full concert which featured many other non-Sign o' the Times songs (including \\"Kiss\\", \\"1999\\", \\"Purple Rain\\", \\"When Doves Cry\\", \\"Girls & Boys\\", and \\"Let's Go Crazy\\") but these songs were eventually dropped. In the musical coda for \\"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man\\", the horn section, Eric Leeds, and trumpeter Atlanta Bliss lifts a section from \\"Rockhard In a Funky Place\\", a Camille track, also on the Crystal Ball track listing, but lost when the 3-LP set was trimmed down. It would later be heard on The Black Album.

Despite critical praise for Prince as a live performer, the film did not perform very well commercially and quickly slipped out of theaters; the sales of the album were not really boosted by the film and it quickly slid out of view in the United States. Nonetheless, when the film was released on VHS the following year, it became extremely popular and received positive reviews, particularly in the United Kingdom. Q magazine gave it four stars, whilst SKY Magazine suggested that it \\"was the greatest concert movie ever made\\". The film holds an 86% rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on fourteen critical reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. =Home media= The film was released in early 2005 on DVD in Canada by Alliance Atlantis, although the cut songs still failed to appear with the rest of the footage. The Blu-ray version was released in Australia by Via Vision Entertainment and Madman Entertainment on May 9, 2012. The film has yet to be released on DVD and/or Blu-ray in the United States and has been out of print in the US since 1991.

In 1996 he formed the London-based indie-band Theaudience, (featuring Sophie Ellis-Bextor on vocals). Theaudience quickly established themselves in the Camden scene of 1997. They scored two top 30 (UK) hits - \\"A Pessimist Is Never Disappointed\\" and \\"I Know Enough (I Don't Get Enough)\\" - and a top 20 (UK) eponymous album, before Reeves left the band following a disastrous Glastonbury 1998 performance. Prior to theaudience, Reeves had briefly been drummer for the bands Blow Up and The Grooveyard, and later formed indie band Congregation while working at the band's label Fire Records in the early 1990s. Reeves signed to Sony Records with a new act ('Yours') in 1999. He also ran the club ('Uncle Bob's Wedding Reception') which provided The Darkness with their first London show. Around this time he also had a brief stint in Los Angeles producing new artist demos for Rondor Publishing. His performing career was interrupted by injuries sustained in a near-fatal car accident in 2001, although he returned to live music from 2006 with the short-lived pop band Friends of the Bride, among other projects. A later project, Sugar Coat, was awarded with a Guinness World Record following the release of the world's first playable jigsaw puzzle. After recovering from his accident Reeves studied under the noted writer and journalist Chris Horrie at the University of Westminster. Reeves achieved a distinction in his post graduate degree under Horrie and was therefore able to reinvent himself as a radio producer and broadcaster on BBC London 94.9. His travel and sports reports are distinctive due to an eccentric delivery, which his friend Danny Baker has compared to the late Cyril Fletcher. He produced the 2005 Sony Award-winning Charlie Gillett Show (which featured Mavis Staples), and as part of the BBC London Travel Team has won two Frank Gillard Awards - in 2009 and 2011. The team was nominated for the 2011 Sony in the 'Multiplatform' category (for coverage of the Tube Strike) and commended in the 2011 Online Media Awards in the 'Twitter feed of the year' category. Outside of the BBC he presents a monthly podcast for Kscope Records, the forefront of the uniquely British 'post-progressive' rock scene. Reeves has also turned his hand to sports commentary for BBC Radio. He lends an eloquence to reports from Brentford FC, and commentates live on the club's website 'Bees Player' - as well as writing a column in the match-day programme.

S. Lewis's The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, part of the series The Chronicles of Narnia.  About  He appears as an old man with a silver beard that comes down to his bare feet, dressed in a robe that appears to be made \\"from the fleece of silver sheep\\". Once a star, he grew too old and descended to the island at the beginning of the end of the world where he lived for some time with his unnamed daughter (of uncertain parentage, but later the wife of Caspian X and Queen of Narnia). Each morning they would emerge from their home to sing a song during the length of dawn, perhaps causing the sun to rise. Then, a mass of white birds would fly out from \\"the valleys of the sun\\" and settle all over the island. One bird would carry a fire-berry, which it would place in Ramandu's mouth. Each time Ramandu ate a fire-berry he would grow younger, until he was an infant, when he was to become a star again.  Ramandu's Island  Ramandu's Island was the last island before the end of the world. The geography of the island was one of gentle hills, not with steep slopes, but instead \\"with slopes like pillows\\" (Lewis 1952). A pleasant \\"purple\\" smell came forth from the island. The island had many capes and points. The bay in which the Dawn Treader anchored was wide and shallow; at the head of that bay was a level valley, which had a heather- like ground covering. In the valley, there was a wide oblong ruin with columns and no roof.Lewis, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Chap. 13.  References  * Lewis, C.S. (1952).

As with other cell cycle proteins or genes such as Cdc2 and Cdc4, the \\"cdc\\" in its name refers to \\"cell division cycle\\". Dual-specificity phosphatases are considered a sub-class of protein tyrosine phosphatases. By removing inhibitory phosphate residues from target cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks), Cdc25 proteins control entry into and progression through various phases of the cell cycle, including mitosis and S (\\"Synthesis\\") phase. Function in activating Cdk1 Cdc25 activates cyclin dependent kinases by removing phosphate from residues in the Cdk active site. In turn, the phosphorylation by M-Cdk (a complex of Cdk1 and cyclin B) activates Cdc25. Together with Wee1, M-Cdk activation is switch- like. The switch-like behavior forces entry into mitosis to be quick and irreversible. Cdk activity can be reactivated after dephosphorylation by Cdc25. The Cdc25 enzymes Cdc25A-C are known to control the transitions from G1 to S phase and G2 to M phase.Morgan, David. The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control. London: New Science Press, 2007. 96-98, 34-35. Print.  Structure  The structure of Cdc25 proteins can be divided into two main regions: the N-terminal region, which is highly divergent and contains sites for its phosphorylation and ubiquitination, which regulate the phosphatase activity; and the C-terminal region, which is highly homologous and contains the catalytic site. Evolution and species distribution Cdc25 enzymes are well conserved through evolution, and have been isolated from fungi such as yeasts as well as all metazoans examined to date, including humans. The exception among eukaryotes may be plants, as the purported plant Cdc25s have characteristics, (such as the use of cations for catalysis), that are more akin to serine/threonine phosphatases than dual-specificity phosphatases, raising doubts as to their authenticity as Cdc25 phosphatases. The Cdc25 family appears to have expanded in relation to the complexity of the cell- cycle and life-cycle of higher animals. Yeasts have a single Cdc25 (as well as a distantly related enzyme known as Itsy-bitsy phosphatase 1, or Ibp1). Drosophila melanogaster has two Cdc25s, known as string and twine, which control mitosis and meiosis, respectively. Most other model organisms examined have three Cdc25s, designated Cdc25A, Cdc25B, and Cdc25C. An exception is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has four distinct Cdc25 genes (Cdc-25.1 to Cdc-25.4). Knockout models Although the highly conserved nature of the Cdc25s implies an important role in cell physiology, Cdc25B and Cdc25C knockout mice (both single and double mutants) are viable and display no major alterations in their cell cycles, suggesting some functional compensation either via other Cdk regulatory enzymes (such as Wee1 and Myt1) or from the activity of the third member of the family, Cdc25A. Hiroaki Kiyokawa's laboratory has shown that Cdc25A knockout mice are not viable. In human disease The Cdc25s, and in particular Cdc25A and Cdc25B, are proto-oncogenes in humans and have been shown to be overexpressed in a number of cancers. The central role of Cdc25s in the cell cycle has garnered them considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry as potential targets for novel chemotherapeutic (anti-cancer) agents. To date, no clinically viable compounds targeting these enzymes have been described. A large number of potent small- molecule Cdc25 Inhibitors have been identified that bind to the active site and belong to various chemical classes, including natural products, lipophilic acids, quinonoids, electrophiles, sulfonylated aminothiazoles and phosphate bioisosteres. Although some progress has been made in developing potent and selective inhibitors for Cdc25 family of proteins, there is scope for development of novel therapeutic strategies to target them. A new class of peptide-derived inhibitors, based on sequence homology with the protein substrate, can be developed. It is challenging to use these compounds as drugs due to their lack of suitable ADME properties.

Early life Collison was born in Beverley, Yorkshire, on 6 January 1772, and became articled to a solicitor in Bridlington. Taking a keen interest in the local Independent Chapel, he became an early Sunday school teacher, and in 1792 decided to give up law and train full-time as a minister at Hoxton College near London. In 1797 he settled close to London in the village of Walthamstow in Essex to carry out pastoral duties, becoming the minister of Marsh Street Congregational Chapel, in whose grounds he was buried in 1847. He undertook this ministerial role whilst also tutoring at Hoxton‚Äîuntil ill health led him to give up the latter in 1801. Detached from Hoxton, he was sought after by other educationalists, and was attracted to an offer to become the founding President and first tutor of a new theological institution, the Hackney Academy. This was to be based on the non-denominational principles George Collison was already familiar with, in his early associations with the London Missionary Society. Founding of the Hackney Academy (Hackney College) The Hackney Theological Seminary began in 1802 as a philanthropic non- denominational venture promoted by the Anglican Rev. John Eyre of Homerton, Secretary of the London Missionary Society and the Independent Rev. George Collison, with their associates. It started in Hackney village in 1803, gradually grew, moved across the city, and, long after Collison's death, it became part of the University of London. On taking up the Presidency of the Hackney Academy in 1803, Collison continued some of his pastoral duties at Walthamstow, but was succeeded in similar work for a small congregation he had recently gathered in Hackney at the Well Street Chapel. Here, his successor, the Rev. Mr Hughes, inherited a rapidly growing interest locally in Independent worship, and his congregation grew so rapidly that little time passed before a larger Independent chapel (Trinity Chapel) had to be built in nearby Devonshire Road. Collison found a philanthropic use for his original chapel; it became the Well Street Chapel Free School, established in 1807 with generous endowments that covered the cost of educating sixty poor children and orphans who made use of the chapel itself for religious aspects of their attendance and had their school rooms and facilities at the back. Collison's Students One of the Rev. George Collison's best known students was the philanthropist and founder of the London Orphan Asylum, the Rev. Dr Andrew Reed (1787‚Äì1862). Reed, who entered the college in 1807 and was ordained in 1811, became closely associated with Wycliffe Chapel in Shoreditch, where he remained pastor until 27 November 1861. One of the Rev. George Collison's other students, Isaac Phillips, was involved in a trial at The Old Bailey. In 1822 he gave evidence against James Hamilton, a local painter and decorator who had returned to george Collisons house and college after carrying out refurbishments, to steal Isaac Phillips' purse containing fifty sovereigns. At that date such a considerable theft might have attracted a capital punishment, but the defendant appealed to the Rev. George Collison to save his life. He was found guilty of stealing and imprisoned for one year. MR. ISAAC PHILLIPS . I am educating as a minister under the Reverend George Collison , who lives in Well-street, Hackney. About ten days before the robbery the prisoner had been painting; he was the only one employed ‚Äì he finished the job on 11 December, last. On the 10th, while he was working there I was giving one of the students change for a sovereign; the student said what a number I had got there ‚Äì I said there was 50 l. I do not know whether the prisoner heard it ‚Äì the prisoner returned a little before one o'clock on the 12th, which was our dinner hour. I saw the gold in the bag in the drawer that morning, between nine and ten o'clock, and on returning from dinner to the study, I found it locked as I had left it ‚Äì I unlocked it, and found the handle of a razor on the floor, my desk broken open, and the money gone ‚Äì I did not see the prisoner again till 10 June, when Tufts brought him down to Hackney ‚Äì I said I knew him, and asked if he did not know me; he said Yes; I said: \\"You know these studies,\\" he said Yes ‚Äì I said': \\"You are the person that painted them,\\" he said Yes; I then got into a coach with him, and on our way from Hackney in the coach, I asked him how he came to commit the offence; he said he would not answer any question of that kind, but begged me to spare his life. The study is at the bottom of the garden; it is attached to the dwelling-house by two walls, and inclosed with the premises by a wall all round. ROBERT TUFTS . I am a publican, and live in Upper East Smithfield. On 12 December, between five and six o'clock in the evening, the prisoner came to my house with two or three more, he called for a bottle of wine, took a bag out of his pocket, and gave me a sovereign; it was a small canvass bag with a red string ‚Äì there was a great deal more money in it. I changed him two sovereigns out of it ‚Äì I asked where he got the money; he said he had an uncle dead in the country, who had left him 50 l. He drank a 5 s. bowl of punch, and went away. I saw no more of him till 10 June. I saw him at my door ‚Äì I asked him in; he had no shirt on, and appeared distressed. I went out to buy him a shirt and handkerchief ‚Äì I told him there were hand-bills out against him for a robbery that he had done; he said he saw it pasted up in the Borough ‚Äì I said he must go with me to the place, which he was willing to do; I said I did not know where the house was ‚Äì he said I will shew you. We took a coach, and he said he hoped I would beg for his life, for it was the first crime that ever he did ‚Äì he took me to Mr. Collison's; he ordered the coachman to pull up at the door. We saw Mr. Phillips, who said to him: \\"Do you know this place;\\" he said he did. He begged of him to save his life. DAVID JONES . I am a painter, and live in Leonard-street, Finsbury. The prisoner was an out-door apprentice of mine ‚Äì I sent him to Hackney to work at Mr. Collison's. He called at the shop on Monday morning, 10 December, and said he should finish that evening ‚Äì I did not see him again till now. I had paid him no sovereigns. I knew of no uncle of his dying THOMAS HARRISON . I am a headborough. On the night of 12 December, I was fetched and took the prisoner ‚Äì he was brought to the watch-house, for having bad money. I found four sovereigns, a small bag, 2 l. 5 s. in silver, and some copper on him; I found they were all good, and asked him how he came by them; he said he had been doing a long job, and had left the money in his master's hands, and that he was going to have a spree with it. The bag was canvas, about six inches long and three wide. George Collison II The Rev. George Collison had one daughter, Hannah; and a son, George Collison II. George II took up his father's previous occupation ‚Äì law ‚Äì and became Secretary and Registrar of the Abney Park Cemetery Company when it was founded in the late 1830s; he is considered to be the cemetery's founder. It was his initial research, including a visit to Massachusetts to observe the New World's non- denominational approach to cemetery design at Mount Auburn, and a study of London burial statistics designed to show a sufficiency of income from burials to maintain Abney Park as a historic parkland, that enabled his project to succeed. His close links to wealthy City Congregationalists, and to Congregational Ministers, also enabled him to form an unusually like-minded group of backers to launch and finance the venture. All of the founders of the Abney Park Cemetery joint stock company were, like Collison, Congregationalists. The Congregationalists of London were already familiar with leading an avowedly non-denominational enterprise promoted largely by Congregationalists; their parallel in this regard being the London Missionary Society. George Collison II acted on behalf of the Abney Park Cemetery Joint Stock Company, to press home their 'New World' idea for a novel garden cemetery with a unique non-denominational design philosophy similar to the Congregationalists' approach to missionary work. George worked as the client representative to guide the company's architect William Hosking and its botanist and nurseryman George Loddiges, to bring about his desired effect. Underpinning his philosophical and urban design ideas, was George Collison's studies of the cemeteries of Europe and, more importantly of North America. His ideas were new to European cemetery design; influenced partly by Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston in Massachusetts which he visited in the 1830s. In the 1860s the cemetery's chaplain Thomas Barker was to write of the cemetery as 'sweet Abney' echoing the well-known poem 'Sweet Auburn' and adding that 'it is a spot of rare, if not unsurpassed loveliness; as a resting-place for the good it is indeed the most picturesque'. More directly, in 1840, George Collison himself wrote that: 'Mount Auburn, near Boston... may be considered a kind of prototype of the rest, is an object of transcendent interest to the traveller, and, is in a great degree similar to our own cemetery at Abney Park'. This remark about the weight Collison accorded to Mount Auburn Cemetery, together with Collison's wider cemetery studies, were collated and published in his methodical review and reflection entitled: * Cemetery Interment...Descriptions of Pere la Chaise, the Eastern Cemeteries, And those of America.. and more particularly of the Abney Park Cemetery Company 1840. This learned volume set out a meticulous listing of all the trees and shrubs commissioned for the Abney Park A to Z Arboretum, and for ornamental beds around the chapel, and for its rosarium of over one thousand cultivars, varieties and species; together with a potential design for a monument to commemorate the life of Dr Isaac Watts whose association with the Abney estate had been a principal motivation for Collison's commercial cemetery scheme, which appears to an extent to have become a vehicle to finance the preservation of, and public access to, the revered Abney Park. George Collison II was a keen promoter of there being a commemorative statue to Isaac Watts in London, and helped establish a committee to take the idea forwards. An early design was illustrated as the frontispiece to above book; and an eventual design by Edward Hodges Baily was adopted in 1844/5 with the support of city and religious philanthropists, but by this date George Collison had left the cemetery company in which he had formerly been so closely involved; he appears to have moved to Tenby by 18611861 Census of england and Wales: RG9; Piece: 4153; Folio: 30; Page: 8; and died at Hereford in 1867.FreeBMD: Deaths Dec 1867: Collison George 58 Hereford 6a 323 References *Budden, H.

Chip art, also known as silicon art, chip graffiti or silicon doodling, refers to microscopic artwork built into integrated circuits, also called chips or ICs. Since ICs are printed by photolithography, not constructed a component at a time, there is no additional cost to include features in otherwise unused space on the chip. Designers have used this freedom to put all sorts of artwork on the chips themselves, from designers' simple initials to rather complex drawings. Given the small size of chips, these figures cannot be seen without a microscope. Chip graffiti is sometimes called the hardware version of software easter eggs. Prior to 1984, these doodles also served a practical purpose. If a competitor produced a similar chip, and examination showed it contained the same doodles, then this was strong evidence that the design was copied (a copyright violation) and not independently derived. A 1984 revision of the US copyright law (the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984) made all chip masks automatically copyrighted, with exclusive rights to the creator, and similar rules apply in most other countries that manufacture ICs. Since an exact copy is now automatically a copyright violation, the doodles serve no useful purpose. Creating chip art Land Shark from Saturday Night Live inside an Analog Devices AD1939 codec chip. tiger on a Dallas Semiconductor test wafer. Integrated Circuits are constructed from multiple layers of material, typically silicon, silicon dioxide (glass), and aluminum. The composition and thickness of these layers give them their distinctive color and appearance. These elements created an irresistible palette for IC design and layout engineers. The creative process involved in the design of these chips, a strong sense of pride in their work, and an artistic temperament combined compels people to want to mark their work as their own. It is very common to find initials, or groups of initials on chips. This is the design engineer's way of \\"signing\\" his or her work. Often this creative artist's instinct extends to the inclusion of small pictures or icons. These may be images of significance to the designers, comments related to the chip's function, inside jokes, or even satirical references. Because of the difficulty in verifying their existence, chip art has also been the subject of online hoaxes (e.g. the never-seen \\"bill sux\\" comment on a Pentium chip--the reputed \\"photo\\" showing the inscription is a hoaxSee an account of \\"Bill Sux\\" as an urban legend.). The mass production of these works of art as parasites on the body of a commercial IC goes unnoticed by most observers and is discouraged by semiconductor corporations, primarily from the fear that the presence of the artwork (which is clearly unneeded) will interfere with some necessary function in the chip or design flow.The Secret Art of Chip Graffiti IEEE Spectrum article on chip artwork, by H. Goldstein, Volume: 39, Issue: 3, Mar 2002, pp. 50-55. Some laboratories have started collaborating with artists or directly producing books and exhibits with the micrographs of these chips. Such is the case of Harvard chemist George Whitesides, who collaborated with pioneer photographer Felice Frankel to publish On the Surface of Things, a highly praised photography book on experiments from (mostly) the Whitesides lab. Also, the laboratory of Albert Folch (who, perhaps not coincidentally, works in BioMEMS, the same field as George Whitesides) at the University of Washington's Bioengineering Dept. has a highly popular online gallery with more than 1,700 free BioMEMS-related chip art micrographs and has already produced three art exhibits in the Seattle area, with online sales.Folch Lab ART Webpage  Notes   References  *The Silicon Zoo - A portion of the Molecular Expressions web site from Florida State University, containing pictures of hundreds of discovered chip artworks.

Views on Ziyarat =Sunni view= Sunnis praying at the grave of Talhah Bin Ubaydallah in Basra, Iraq More than any other tomb in the Islamic world, the shrine of the Prophet Muhammad is considered a source of blessings for the visitor. A hadith of the Prophet states that, \\"He who visits my grave will be entitled to my intercession\\" and in a different version \\"I will intercede for those who have visited me or my tomb.\\" Visiting the Prophet's tomb after the pilgrimage is considered by the majority of Sunni legal scholars to be recommended. The early scholars of the salaf, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (d. 241 AH), Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh (d. 238 SH), Abdullah ibn Mubarak (d. 189 AH) and Imam Shafi'i (d. 204 AH) all permitted the practice of Ziyarah to the Prophet's tomb. According to the Hanbali scholar Al-Hasan ibn 'Ali al-Barbahari (d. 275 AH), it is also obligatory to send salutations (salam) upon Abu Bakr al-Siddiq and ‚ÄòUmar ibn al-Khattab after having sent salutations upon the Prophet.al-BarbahƒÅrƒ´, Shar·∏• al-Sunnah, p. 108 The hadith scholar Qadi Ayyad (d. 544 AH) stated that visiting the Prophet was \\"a sunna of the Muslims on which there was consensus, and a good and desirable deed.\\" Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852 AH) explicitly stated that travelling to visit the tomb of the Prophet was \\"one of the best of actions and the noblest of pious deeds with which one draws near to God, and its legitimacy is a matter of consensus.\\" Similarly, Ibn Qudamah (d. 620 AH) considered Ziyarat of the Prophet to be recommended and also seeking intercession directly from the Prophet at his grave.Ibn QudƒÅmah, Ab≈´ Mu·∏•ammad, Al-Mughnƒ´, (Beirut: Bayt al-AfkƒÅr al-Dawliyyah, 2004), p 795. Ibn Taymiyyah condemned all forms of seeking intercession from the dead and said that all ahadith encouraging visitation to the Prophet's tomb are fabricated (mawdu‚Äò). This view of Ibn Taymiyya was rejected by mainstream Sunni scholars both during his life and after his death. The Shafi'i hadith master Ibn Hajar al- Asqalani stated that \\"This is one of the ugliest positions that has been reported of Ibn Taymiyya\\". The Hanafi hadith scholar Ali al-Qari stated that, \\"Amongst the Hanbalis, Ibn Taymiyya has gone to an extreme by prohibiting travelling to visit the Prophet ‚Äì may God bless him and grant him peace\\" Qastallani stated that \\"The Shaykh Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya has abominable and odd statements on this issue to the effect that travelling to visit the Prophet is prohibited and is not a pious deed.\\" Other historic scholars who recommended Ziyarah include Imam al-Ghazali (d. 505 AH), Imam Nawawi (d. 676 AH) and Muhammad al-Munawi (d. 1031 AH). The tombs of other Muslim religious figures are also respected. The son of Ahmad ibn Hanbal named Abdullah, one of the primary jurists of Sunnism, reportedly stated that he would prefer to be buried near the shrine of a saintly person than his own father. =Shia view= There are reasons why Shƒ´‚Äòah partake in Ziyarah which do not involve the worship of the people buried within the tombs. Ayatullah Borujerdi and Ayatullah Khomeini have both said: The Shƒ´‚Äòah do however perform Ziyarah, believing that the entombed figures bear great status in the eyes of God, and seek to have their prayers answered through these people (a form of Tawassul) - Sayyid Muhammad Hasan Musawi writes: In this regard, Ibn Shu‚Äôba al-Harrani also narrates a hadƒ´th from the tenth ImƒÅm of the Twelver Shƒ´‚Äòas: Carrying corpses to the Holy Shrines, Persia, 19th century. The Ziyarah of the ImƒÅms is also done by the Shƒ´‚Äòah, not only as a means of greeting and saluting their masters who lived long before they were born, but also as a means of seeking nearness to God and more of His blessings (barakah). The Shƒ´‚Äòah do not consider the hadith collected by al-Bukhari to be authentic,Moojan Moman, Introduction to Shi'i Islam, Yale University Press, 1985, p.174 ; Ahmad Abdullah Salamah, Shia & Sunni Perspective on Islam, p.52. and argue that if things such as Ziyarah and Tawassul were innovations and shirk, Muhammad himself would have prohibited people as a precaution, from visiting graves, or seeking blessings through kissing the sacred black stone at the Ka‚Äòbah.Risalatan Bayn al-Shaykhayn, p.17. http://www.imamreza.net/eng/list.php?id=0113 Tawassul - Seeking a Way unto Allah al-islam.org It is a popular Shi'i belief that to be buried near the burial place of the Imams is beneficial. In Shi'i sacred texts it is stated that the time between death and resurrection (barzakh) should be spent near the Imams.

Construction The line was built at the urgings of local residents in and around Outram, even though there was little promise of traffic to actually justify the line's construction. There was an initial proposal to build a line from Allanton, near the site of Dunedin's current airport, but when landowners along a proposed route from Mosgiel agreed to make land available for free on the condition trains ran six days a week, their route was selected instead. Construction commenced in September 1875 with the Main South Line junction located just north of Mosgiel station's yard, and although the line crossed mainly flat land, one engineering difficulty was presented by the Gladfield swamp. A solid base could not be found even at a depth of twelve metres, and the problem was eventually solved by laying many layers of flax to provide a firm foundation for the line. Two bridges were required during construction, the 67 metres Taieri River bridge near Outram, and a 42-metre bridge across the Silver Stream. The line was remarkably straight: in its entire 14.5-kilometre length, it had a mere three curves. Only one staffed station and goods shed were built on the line, both at the terminus in Outram. It was opened for service on 1 October 1877.Otago Witness, 31 March 1898, \\"Chronological Index of the Settlement of Otago: 1877\\", accessed 13 October 2007. Operation In its early years, Outram served as the railhead during the construction of the Taieri Gorge section of the Otago Central Railway (now preserved as the Taieri Gorge Railway). Trains ran six days a week as promised, and due to restrictions on the weight of locomotives allowed to cross the Taieri River bridge, the line was operated by small tank locomotives such as the F class, with the WF class being the heaviest class permitted. In 1930, two services ran return daily, but this was seen to be excessive and trains were cut to run once daily. These services were mixed trains and they operated until 13 January 1950, when the passenger component was cancelled and the line became freight only. The line was proving uneconomic and the cessation of passenger services could not save its poor financial state. By the early 1950s, traffic was almost non-existent: 107 tonnes of agricultural lime and fertiliser were railed in a week, with a meagre seven tonnes of freight railed out. Outram was very adequately served by road transportation and the railway was overdue for maintenance - it was clear it would not be beneficial to keep it open any longer. Accordingly, the line was closed to all traffic on 5 December 1953. The branch today It is typical for both nature and human activity to reduce or wholly destroy traces of closed railway lines, and little remains of the Outram Branch. In Outram itself, the goods shed has been incorporated as part of a road transportation company's depot, and outside of the town, across the Taieri River, School Road uses the old route of the railway for nearly three kilometres. Concrete abutments at the location of a long-gone bridge over a small creek are still present, as are some traces of the line's formation at points along its former route, and the site of the Dukes Road station still possesses its concrete platform.

History The abbey was founded in 766 by Gamelbert of Michaelsbuch. For many centuries Metten was under the lordship of the Dukes and Electors of Bavaria. When Charlemagne stayed in Regensburg for three years after 788, Utto turned his abbey over to the Frankish ruler, making the Ducal Abbey a Royal Abbey. After the Carolingians became extinct, Metten was turned into an Imperial Abbey. Besides the work of land clearance in the Bavarian border territories, the monks were very active in education. Members of the abbey were not only schoolteachers, but also members of the Bavarian Academy of Science in Munich and professors of philosophy and theology in Freising and Salzburg. Gerhard, Bishop of Passau was abbot in the 10th century. After secularisation in 1803 the abbey's property was confiscated, and by 1815 had all been auctioned off. Over a number of years Johann von Pronath acquired the greater part of the former premises and succeeded in persuading King Ludwig I of Bavaria in 1830 to re-establish the monastery, which by 1837 had been set up to incorporate a boarding school (Gymnasium), in continuance of its educational traditions, which the monastery has run to this day. The re-founded abbey was very active in re-settling new monasteries. In 1846 Boniface Wimmer left from Metten to establish the Benedictines in the United States and founded Saint Vincent Archabbey in Latrobe, Pennsylvania.Stehle, Walter. \\"Boniface Wimmer.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. Monks from Latrobe in turn founded Saint John's Abbey in Minnesota, and the adjoining Saint John's University.\\"History\\", Saint John's Abbey Since 1858 Metten has been a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation. During World War II, more than 1,000 refugees from the East found shelter at Metten, located just 30 miles from the Czechoslovak border. \\"The last days of the war saw heavy fighting for the nearby bridges on the Danube, where SS troops held out against approaching U.S. forces. Elsewhere, an advance of combat forces was usually preceded by bombing, but none took place at Metten. Instead, American tank units spearheaded the attack, sparing the townspeople as well as the monastery from great destruction. Years later, the brothers at Metten learned that among the staff officers of the United States army unit that had marched into Metten were some who had studied at St. Vincent and St. John.\\"Granitsas, Margot. \\"Books in a Gilded Cage\\", The New York Times, December 3, 1989 Besides the boarding school, the abbey runs various craft enterprises. Dom Edmund Beck, a monk of Metten, edited many of the Syriac works of Saint Ephrem the Syrian in the Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium. School Like many Benedictine abbeys in Europe, the monks ran a school for local boys. St.-Michaels-Gymnasium is a state recognised coeducational day and boarding school still run by the abbey. It is a Humanistisches (\\"humanist\\") and Neusprachliches (\\"languages\\") gymnasium, meaning that its curriculum specialises in the classics and modern languages. Notable alumni include educationist Aloys Fischer, diplomat Karl von Spreti, military officer Vincenz M√ºller and Karl-Josef Cardinal Rauber. Library The original library was established in the 1260s and was expanded over the years.\\"Baroque Library of Metten Abbey\\", Atlas Obscura The present library was constructed between 1722 and 1726 in the Baroque style by Abbot Roman II M√§rkl. At the time of secularization, many of the books were sent to municipal and university libraries. The library was used to store grain. Upon the abbey's reestablishment, some were returned; others were donated from estates or closed monasteries. Because so many monastic libraries had been confiscated, the monks found a old manuscripts and early printed books on the market at reasonable prices. A 1415 manuscript found in the abbey's library helped identify the meaning of the abbreviations for the Vade retro satana (Step back Satan) formula that appears on Saint Benedict Medals. The library, which is open for tours, contains over 150,000 volumes on theology, philosophy and history, including a 1434 illuminated volume of Gregorian chant hand- written on sheepskin parchment.

(See Homer, Odyssey, Chapter III.) The main application of the term \\"katarche\\" in the Hellenistic and Roman period was to the branch of astrology now called electional astrology, or the art of choosing an auspicious time to begin a venture or an enterprise. Also included in this practice were techniques for analyzing an astrological chart drawn up for the beginning moment of an event that had already taken place, in order to foretell the likely success of a venture, or the timing of its development. Recently, in the late 20th century, some astrologers began to extend the use of the word katarche to interrogations or horary astrology, where a chart is cast for the moment that a question is posed to an astrologer. According to this modern interpretation there is a fluid connection between the notions of electional and horary astrology. This view, which is primarily advocated by Geoffrey Cornelius, is that the origins of the concept and core meaning of the term katarche lie in the ritual, sacrificial and divinitory connotations of the term, and that the later application of the term in the Hellenistic and Roman periods strictly to elections and inceptions were a result of some sort of decay in the understanding of the term.

Bow and stern planes  US of World War II, showing bow planes rigged upwards for stowage Diving planes are usually fitted in two pairs, the bow planes at the front of the submarine and the stern planes at the rear. The stern planes function in much the same way as an aircraft's elevator. As the planes are a long distance fore-and-aft from the hull's centre of buoyancy, they introduce a pitching moment. Ballast tanks within the submarine adjust buoyancy to be neutral, making the boat controllable. The position of the planes controls the pitch of the boat and, with the forward motion of the boat, this controls depth. If not carefully controlled, this could lead to a 'porpoising' motion whereby the planesman continually hunts for a stable combination of depth and pitch. For easier berthing close alongside a jetty, submarines have used folding bow planes that retracted alongside the hull. Earlier submarines (to World War II) used vertical folding planes perpendicular to their surface. US submarines referred to this stowage as 'rigging' the planes, and 'tilting' for their control movement. Later Soviet submarines have tended to fold backwards, into recesses in the casing. Stern planes of mounted directly in the prop wake, with fixed planes above.  Fairwater planes  from above, showing fairwater planes mounted on the sail Simon Lake of the Lake Torpedo Boat Company was the first to develop planes that could control depth without introducing a pitching moment. Stern planes and rudder were mounted below the stern akin to a conventional ship. The depth control planes were mounted on the beam, so that they acted vertically, without the lever arm to introduce the usual pitch. Diving planes located on the sail (conning tower) are called fairwater planes on US Navy submarines. Fairwater planes do not pitch the ship up or down; they cause the ship to rise or sink on a level plane as they are operated. surfaced through Arctic ice, with sail-mounted planes turned vertically When operating beneath polar ice, a submarine with planes on the sail must break them through the ice when surfacing. From the they were arranged to be able to be pointed vertically upwards, rather than being rigged or folded in. Newer boats, starting with the third-flight Los Angeles class subs (or 688is) have eliminated the sail planes, and operate instead with bow planes.  Controls  Control room of with separate operator positions for fore and stern planes From the outset, diving planes were controlled remotely by telemotors, early servomechanisms operated electrically or by hydraulics. Maintaining depth in a submarine is a sophisticated task. The planesman was provided with a prominent depth gauge to monitor this, usually a circular Bourdon gauge. For precise maintenance at periscope depth an additional shallow-depth manometer, a transparent vertical pipe, would be provided too. With the development of active sonar, depth control became even more complex. Rather than maintaining a simple depth, the planesman must now keep the boat beneath a thermocline in order to hide from sonar. To this end, the helm position may also show external water thermometers and salinometers. Combined helm of Early submarines had separate controls for each pair of planes, bow and stern. Together with the helmsman, this required three ratings in the already-crowded control room. By the 1960s, combined controls were introduced. These incorporated all planes onto a single aircraft-style control wheel.  Cars  In automotive terms, dive planes (which physically resemble submarine diving planes) are aerodynamic devices fitted on cars just ahead of the front wheels. They are most commonly found on racing cars such as the Le Mans Prototype Series and are used to create additional downforce and channel airflow to help balance the car. The 2012 Mercedes-Benz C63 AMG Black Series is one of the first road cars to feature these devices.

Typically m is much less than 1. These materials are deeply colored solids that exhibit a range of electrical and redox properties of potential applications. Preparation and structure These materials are prepared by treating graphite with a strong oxidant or a strong reducing agent: :C + m X ‚Üí CXm The reaction is reversible. The host (graphite) and the guest X interact by charge transfer. An analogous process is the basis of commercial lithium-ion batteries. In a graphite intercalation compound not every layer is necessarily occupied by guests. In so-called stage 1 compounds, graphite layers and intercalated layers alternate and in stage 2 compounds, two graphite layers with no guest material in between alternate with an intercalated layer. The actual composition may vary and therefore these compounds are an example of non-stoichiometric compounds. It is customary to specify the composition together with the stage. The layers are pushed apart upon incorporation of the guest ions. Examples =Alkali and alkaline earth derivatives= Potassium graphite under argon in a Schlenk flask. A glass-coated magnetic stir bar is also present. One of the best studied graphite intercalation compounds, KC8, is prepared by melting potassium over graphite powder. The potassium is absorbed into the graphite and the material changes color from black to bronze. The resulting solid is pyrophoric. The composition is explained by assuming that the potassium to potassium distance is twice the distance between hexagons in the carbon framework. The bond between anionic graphite layers and potassium cations is ionic. The electrical conductivity of the material is greater than that of Œ±-graphite.NIST Ionizing Radiation Division 2001 ‚Äì Major Technical Highlights. physics.nist.gov KC8 is a superconductor with a very low critical temperature Tc = 0.14 K. Heating KC8 leads to the formation of a series of decomposition products as the K atoms are eliminated: : 3 KC8 ‚Üí KC24 \\\\+ 2 K Via the intermediates KC24 (blue in color), KC36, KC48, ultimately the compound KC60 results. The stoichiometry MC8 is observed for M = K, Rb and Cs. For smaller ions M = Li+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Eu2+, Yb3+, and Ca2+, the limiting stoichiometry is MC6. Calcium graphite is obtained by immersing highly oriented pyrolytic graphite in liquid Li‚ÄìCa alloy for 10 days at 350 ¬∞C. The crystal structure of belongs to the Rm space group. The graphite interlayer distance increases upon Ca intercalation from 3.35 to 4.524 √Ö, and the carbon-carbon distance increases from 1.42 to 1.444 √Ö. Structure of With barium and ammonia, the cations are solvated, giving the stoichiometry (Ba(NH3)2.5C10.9(stage 1)) or those with caesium, hydrogen and potassium (CsC8¬∑K2H4/3C8(stage 1)). Different from other alkali metals, the amount of Na intercalation is very small. Quantum-mechanical calculations show that this originate from a quite general phenomenon: among the alkali and alkaline earth metals, Na and Mg generally have the weakest chemical binding to a given substrate, compared with the other elements in the same group of the periodic table. The phenomenon arises from the competition between trends in the ionization energy and the ion‚Äìsubstrate coupling, down the columns of the periodic table. However, considerable Na intercalation into graphite can occur in cases when the ion is wrapped in a solvent shell through the process of co-intercalation. A complex magnesium(I) species has also been intercalated into graphite. =Graphite bisulfate, perchlorate, hexafluoroarsenate: oxidized carbons= The intercalation compounds graphite bisulfate and graphite perchlorate can be prepared by treating graphite with strong oxidizing agents in the presence of strong acids. In contrast to the potassium and calcium graphites, the carbon layers are oxidized in this process: 48 C + 0.25 O2 \\\\+ 3 H2SO4 ‚Üí [C24]+[HSO4]‚àí¬∑2H2SO4 \\\\+ 0.5 H2O In graphite perchlorate, planar layers of carbon atoms are 794 picometers apart, separated by ClO4‚àí ions. Cathodic reduction of graphite perchlorate is analogous to heating KC8, which leads to a sequential elimination of HClO4. Both graphite bisulfate and graphite perchlorate are better conductors as compared to graphite, as predicted by using a positive-hole mechanism. Reaction of graphite with [O2]+[AsF6]‚àí affords the salt [C8]+[AsF6]‚àí. =Metal halide derivatives= A number of metal halides intercalate into graphite. The chloride derivatives have been most extensively studied. Examples include MCl2 (M = Zn, Ni, Cu, Mn), MCl3 (M = Al, Fe, Ga), MCl4 (M = Zr, Pt), etc. The materials consists of layers of close-packed metal halide layers between sheets of carbon. The derivative C~8FeCl3 exhibits spin glass behavior. It proved to be a particularly fertile system on which to study phase transitions. A stage n magnetic GIC has n graphite layers separating successive magnetic layers. As the stage number increases the interaction between spins in successive magnetic layers becomes weaker and 2D magnetic behaviour may arise. =Halogen- and oxide-graphite compounds= Chlorine and bromine reversibly intercalate into graphite. Iodine does not. Fluorine reacts irreversibly. In the case of bromine, the following stoichiometries are known: CnBr for n = 8, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 28. Because it forms irreversibly, carbon monofluoride is often not classified as an intercalation compound. It has the formula (CF)x. It is prepared by reaction of gaseous fluorine with graphitic carbon at 215‚Äì230 ¬∞C. The color is greyish, white, or yellow. The bond between the carbon and fluorine atoms is covalent. Tetracarbon monofluoride (C4F) is prepared by treating graphite with a mixture of fluorine and hydrogen fluoride at room temperature. The compound has a blackish-blue color. Carbon monofluoride is not electrically conductive. It has been studied as a cathode material in one type of primary (non-rechargeable) lithium batteries. Graphite oxide is an unstable yellow solid. Properties and applications Graphite intercalation compounds have fascinated materials scientists for many years owing to their diverse electronic and electrical properties. =Superconductivity= Among the superconducting graphite intercalation compounds, exhibits the highest critical temperature Tc = 11.5 K, which further increases under applied pressure (15.1 K at 8 GPa). Superconductivity in these compounds is thought to be related to the role of an interlayer state, a free electron like band lying roughly above the Fermi level; superconductivity only occurs if the interlayer state is occupied.

The opening of a superconducting gap in the œÄ* band revealed a substantial contribution to the total electron‚Äìphonon-coupling strength from the œÄ*-interlayer interband interaction. =Reagents in chemical synthesis: KC8= The bronze-colored material KC8 is one of the strongest reducing agents known. It has also been used as a catalyst in polymerizations and as a coupling reagent for aryl halides to biphenyls. In one study, freshly prepared KC8 was treated with 1-iodododecane delivering a modification (micrometre scale carbon platelets with long alkyl chains sticking out providing solubility) that is soluble in chloroform. Another potassium graphite compound, KC24, has been used as a neutron monochromator. A new essential application for potassium graphite was introduced by the invention of the potassium-ion battery. Like the lithium-ion battery, the potassium-ion battery should use a carbon-based anode instead of a metallic anode. In this circumstance, the stable structure of potassium graphite is an important advantage.

Design and development After a visit to England mid-1941, General Henry H. Arnold was so impressed by flight demonstrations of the Gloster E.28/39 jet aircraft he had witnessed that he arranged for the Power Jets W.1X turbojet engine to be shipped by air to the U.S, along with drawings for the more powerful W.2B/23 engine, so that the US could develop its own jet engine. General Electric's extensive experience in turbocharger production made them the natural choice for producing such an engine. The initial prototype, the General Electric I-A, was essentially based on the W.2B/23. It first ran on 18 April 1942 and developed a static thrust of 1250lbf. The I-A air intake consisted of two peripheral slots which led to a double-sided, centrifugal compressor. A series of vanes guided the air into the impeller eyes. After radial compression, the air was diffused and turned 90 degrees rearwards, before entering a set of ten reverse-flow combustion chambers (i.e. cans). A relatively short shaft connected the compression system to the single stage axial turbine. After expansion through the turbine, the combustion products exhausted the engine through the simple conical propelling nozzle, via the jet-pipe. For the turbine section, GE used a proprietary metal developed for their turbochargers, Hastelloy B.Machine Design (retrieved 30 May 2017) Problems were uncovered with overheating bearings, and solved by fitting the turbine with larger cooling blades and changing the air diffuser, as well as switching to a ram air cooling air inlet.Machine Design (retrieved 30 May 2017) Using their turbocharger expertise, General Electric were able to, in a short space of time, develop a -thrust version, known as the I-14. Later they increased the thrust to . This version was referred to internally as the I-16 However, the United States Army Air Forces later decided to standardise all their jet engine naming, at which point the I-16 became the J31. Production of the J31 started for the P-59 Airacomet in 1943, and by the time the lines shut down in 1945, a total of 241 had been built. GE also used the basic design to produce the much larger I-40 with 4,000 lbf, but this design was passed on to Allison as the J33, much to GE's chagrin. Another derivative of the J31, the General Electric I-20, given the military designation J39, was ordered but later cancelled. Meanwhile, the British version of the W.2B/23 turbojet entered production as the 1,600lbf thrust Rolls-Royce Welland 1 in October, 1943. The Gloster Meteor I fighter, which entered RAF service in July, 1944, was powered by the Welland I.

He also called for Canadian soldiers to be returned from Europe, arguing that large expenditures on overseas troops were hindering Canada's ability to run a modern navy (KWS, 11 November 1988). Johnson was considered a star candidate, and was backed by a strong local organization that outspent all other campaigns in the city (KWS, 25 May 1989). His support base was eroded by a strong Liberal campaign, however, and he finished third against Liberal Peter Milliken with 11,442 votes (20.10%). Following the election, Johnson was named Kingston chair of the peace group Project Plowshares (KWS, 21 December 1988). *Kitchener: Sue Coulter *Lambton‚ÄîMiddlesex: Larry Ross Green *Lanark‚ÄîCarleton: Bill Cox *Leeds‚ÄîGrenville: Barry Grills *Lincoln: John Mayer *London East: Marion Boyd *London West: Bruce Lundgren *London‚ÄîMiddlesex: Michael Wyatt *Markham: Susan Krone *Mississauga East: Walter Grozdanovski *Mississauga South: Sue Craig *Mississauga West: Paul Simon *Nepean: Bea Murray *Niagara Falls: Dick Harrington *Nickel Belt: John Rodriguez *Nipissing: Dawson Pratt *Northumberland: Gord Barnes *Oakville‚ÄîMilton: Richard J.

In most styles, shizentai is identical to hachiji dachi. Description The following is consistent with the teachings of shotokan karate. Different styles may vary slightly. In hachiji dachi, the feet are shoulder width apart, toes pointing forward. The karateka stands upright, facing straight forward. While in hachiji dachi, the karateka is usually in a yoi (ready) position. The yoi position is a preparatory position that gives a clear starting point for execution of other techniques. The main version of yoi means the arms are slightly moved forward, with fists closed. The fists point slightly to the centre line and are roughly half a shoulder width apart. The elbows should be bent very slightly. There are many variations to the movements leading to the yoi position. Note that some kata have very different yoi positions. The basic Shotokan kata all start at the stance and with the yoi position described above. Examples of basic kata are Heian shodan, Heian nidan and Heian sandan. Other yoi positions are found mostly in intermediate and advanced kata.

In the region, Periyar river perhaps branched into two like a cleft lip (an abnormal facial development) and thus gave it the name \\"Muciri.\\", again a speculation. It is frequently referred to as Muciri in Sangam poems, Muracippattanam in the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, and as Muyirikkottu in a copper plate of an 11th-century Chera ruler.

The land routes are shown in red, the maritime routes in blue. = Sangam literature = A tantalizing description of Muziris is in Akana·πâ≈´·πüu, an anthology of early Tamil bardic poems (poem number 149.7-11) in E·π≠·π≠uttokaiKulke, Hermann; Dietmar Rothermund (2004).

Tyndis is of the > Kingdom of Cerobothra; it is a village in plain sight by the sea.

The Periplus reveals how Muziris became the main trade port for the Chera chiefdom. The author explains that this large settlement owed its prosperity to foreign commerce, including shipping arriving from northern India and the Roman empire. Black pepper from the hills was brought to the port by the local producers and stacked high in warehouses to await the arrival of Roman merchants. As the shallows at Muziris prevented deep-hulled vessels from sailing upriver to the port, Roman freighters were forced to shelter at the edge of the lagoon while their cargoes were transferred upstream on smaller craft. The Periplus records that special consignments of grain were sent to places like Muziris and scholars suggest that these deliveries were intended for resident Romans who needed something to supplement the local diet of rice. = Pliny the Elder = Pliny the Elder gives a description of voyages to India in the 1st century AD. He refers to many Indian ports in his The Natural History. However, by the time of Pliny, Muziris was no longer a favoured location in Roman trade dealing with Southern India.

Asia's Maritime Bead Trade: 300 B.C. to the Present, pp . 119 University of Hawaii Press, 01-Jan-2002 Pseudostomus (literally, \\"false mouth\\", in Greek) is generally identified with modern-day Periyar river. = Muziris papyrus = This Greek papyrus of the 2nd century AD documents a contract involving an Alexandrian merchant importer and a financier that concerns cargoes, especially of pepper and spices from Muziris.Romila Thapar. The Penguin History of Early India: From the Origins to AD 1300. Penguin Books India, 2003 The fragmentary papyrus records details about a cargo consignment (valued at around nine million sesterces) brought back from Muziris on board a Roman merchant ship called the Hermapollon. The discovery opened a strong base to ancient international and trade laws in particular and has been studied at length by economists, lawyers as well as historians.Raoul McLaughlin.

With regard to Muziris and the Roman spice trade with Malabar, the Silappatikaram describes the prevailing situation as : > When the broadrayed sun ascends from the south and white clouds start to > form in the early cool season, it is time to cross the dark, bellowing > ocean. The rulers of Tyndis dispatch vessels loaded with eaglewood, silk, > sandalwood, spices and all sorts of camphor. = Peutinger's Map = Peutinger Map, an odd-sized medieval copy of an ancient Roman road map, \\"with information which could date back to 2nd century AD\\", in which both Muziris and Tondis are well marked, \\"with a large lake indicated behind Muziris, and beside which is an icon marked Templ(um) Augusti, widely taken to mean a ‚ÄúTemple of Augustus\\". A large number of Roman subjects must have spent months in this region awaiting favourable conditions for return sailings to the Empire. This could explain why the Map records the existence of an Augustan temple. It is also possible that there was a Roman colony in Muziris Romans in Muziris.  Great \\"floods\\" of Periyar  Muziris disappeared from every known map of antiquity, and without a trace, presumably because of a cataclysmic event in 1341, a \\"cyclone and floods\\" in the Periyar that altered the geography of the region. The historians Rajan Gurukkal and Dick Whittakker say in a study titled \\"In Search of Muziris\\" that the event, which opened up the present harbour at Kochi and the Vembanad backwater system to the sea and formed a new deposit of land now known as the Vypeen Island near Kochi, \\"doubtless changed access to the Periyar river, but geologically it was only the most spectacular of the physical changes and land formation that have been going on [there] from time immemorial\\". According to them, for example, a geophysical survey of the region has shown that 200‚Äì300 years ago the shoreline lay about three kilometres east of the present coast and that some 2,000 years earlier it lay even further east, about 6.5 km inland. \\"If Muziris had been situated somewhere here in Roman times, the coast at that time would have run some 4-5 km east of its present line. The regular silting up of the river mouth finally forced it to cease activity as a port.\\"  Archaeological excavations  A series of excavations conducted at Kodungallur starting from 1945, yielded nothing that went back to before the 13th century. Another excavation was carried out in 1969 by the Archaeological Survey of India at Cheraman Parambu, 2 km north of Kodungallur. Only antiquities of the 13th and 16th century were recovered.Srivathsan, A. \\"In search of Muziris\\". The Hindu [Madras]. 2 May 2010. Web. In 1983, a large hoard of Roman coins was found at a site around six miles from Pattanam. A series of pioneering excavations carried out by Kerala Council for Historical Research (KCHR, an autonomous institution) at Pattanam from 2007 uncovered a large number of artefacts. So far, seven seasons of excavations (2007‚Äì14) are completed by KCHR at Pattanam. The identification of Pattanam as Muziris is a divisive subject among some of the historians of south India. When KCHR announced the possible finding of Muziris based on Pattanam finds, it invited criticism from some historians and archaeologists. Historians such as R Nagaswamy, KN Panikkar and MGS Narayanan disagreed with the identification and called for further analysis. \\"Whether Pattanam was Muziris is not of immediate concern to us,\\" the chief of the Kerala Council for Historical Research recently stated to the media.S. ANANDAN Was Pattanam an urban trade centre? 28 May 2014 The Hindu Even the last field report on the excavations (2013) explicitly shows Pattanam as Muziris. While historian and academic Rajan Gurukkal throws his weight behind the ‚Äòsalvage of historic relics at Pattanam‚Äô by KCHR given the sites disturbance due to continual human habitation and activity, he thinks it [ancient Muziris] was no more than a colony of merchants from the Mediterranean. \\"The abundance of material from the Mediterranean suggests that traders arrived here using favourable monsoon winds and returned using the next after short sojourns,\\" he says. Feeder vessels transported them between their ships and the wharf, but it would be incorrect to say that it was a sophisticated port in an urban setting. The place did not have any evolved administration nor any sophistication. I believe it [Pattanam] was Muziris. Had it been elsewhere, Pattanam wharf and colony would‚Äôve found a mention in available records, he says.Kerala historians at loggerheads over archaeological findings at Pattanam KOCHI, 28 May 2014 The Hindu = Discoveries from Pattanam = Archaeological research has shown that Pattanam was a port frequented by Romans and it has a long history of habitation dating back to 10th century BC. Its trade links with Rome peaked between 1st century BC and 4th century AD.Oxford University to join Pattanam excavations THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, 25 December 2013 The Hindu A large quantity of artifacts represents the maritime contacts of the site with Mediterranean, Red Sea and Indian Ocean rims. The major finds include ceramics, lapidary-related objects, metal objects, coins, architectural ruins, geological, zoological and botanical remains. * Mediterranean: (100 BCE to CE 400) Amphora, terra sigillata sherds, Roman glass fragments and gaming counters. * West Asian, South Arabian & Mesopotamian: (300 BCE - CE1000 ) Turquoise glazed pottery, torpedo jar fragments and frankincense crumbs. * Chinese: (CE 1600 ‚Äì CE 1900) Blue on white porcelain sherds. * Regional/Local: (1000 BCE to CE 2000) Black and red ware sherds, Indian rouletted ware, gemstones, glass beads, semi precious stone beads/inlays/intaglio, cameo‚Äìblanks, coins, spices, pottery and terracotta objects. * Urban life: (100 BCE to CE 400) burnt bricks, rooftiles, ring-wells, storage jars, toilet features, lamps, coins, stylus, personal adornment items and scripts on pottery. * Industrial character: (100 BCE to CE 400) Metallurgy reflected in iron, copper, gold and lead objects, crucibles, slag, furnace installations, lapidary remains of semi-precious stones and spindle whorls indicating weaving. * Maritime features: (100 BCE to CE 400) Wharf, warehouse, canoe, bollards. The major discoveries from Pattanam include thousands of beads (made of semi-precious stone), sherds of Roman amphora, Chera-era coins made of copper alloys and lead, fragments of Roman glass pillar bowls, terra sigillata, remains of a long wooden boat and associated bollards made of teak and a wharf made of fired brick. The most remarkable find at Pattanam excavations in 2007 was a brick structural wharf complex, with nine bollards to harbour boats and in the midst of this, a highly decayed canoe, all perfectly mummified in mud. The canoe (6 meters long) was made of Artocarpus hirsutus, a tree common in Malabar Coast, out of which boats are made.KCHR reports 2007. P.J. Cherian et al. The bollards some of which are still in satisfactory condition was made of teak.Chambers, W. 1875. Chambers's Etymological Dictionary of the English Language. London. p. 513. Three Tamil- Brahmi scripts were also found in the Pattanam excavations. The last Tamil- Brahmi script (dated to c. 2nd century AD, probably reading \\"a-ma-na\\", meaning \\"a Jaina\\" in Tamil) was found on a pot-rim at Pattanam. If the rendering and the meaning is not mistaken, it establishes that Jainism was prevalent on the Malabar Coast at least from the 2nd century. This is for the first time the excavators are getting direct evidence relating to a religious system in ancient Kerala.  Muziris Heritage Project  Muziris Heritage Project is a tourism venture by Tourism Department of Kerala to reinstate the historical and cultural significance of Muziris.

He currently lives in Eindhoven. In addition to his shows, he has also made a number of appearances in films. Career Maassen won two of the biggest comedy contests in the Netherlands in 1990, the Groninger Studenten Cabaret Festival (GSCF), and Cameretten. The GSCF jury was not pleased with the quality of the contestants that year, and gave Maassen the first prize, remarking he was the best of the year, but still not very good. Since 1995, Maassens shows are shown on Dutch national television, making him more and more a household name. In 2006, Maassen received the 'Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds Theater Prijs 2006' (Prince Bernhard Culture Fund Theatre Prize 2006) for his 'daring combination of theatre and comedy'. The same year he also received the Prijs van de Kritiek (Prize of the critics), a yearly prize by Dutch theatre critics. He also has released a song titled Lauwe Pis (Lukewarm Piss) which peaked at #1 on the Dutch Top 40.

He also had a supporting role in the serie Dunya en Desie.  Personal life  Maassen once stole the UEFA cup from the stadium of football club PSV Eindhoven. For several years it was unknown who had been responsible for the disappearance of the trophy. The true story was confessed by Maassen himself, live on a TV talkshow about football. That night the show had several guests that were in the possession of rare football artifacts. When the host asked Maassen about his artifact, he took the UEFA cup out of his bag and put it on the table, in front of the baffled host and guests. He received a few hours of community service after being brought up on charges by the team. Later, he also showed on Studio Voetbal that he had stolen PSV's second prize of the UEFA Supercup. In 2008 Maassen started the organization Comedians for Congo to raise money for children fleeing the war torn country.

Its connections project extensively over the brain from the cerebral cortex down into the spinal cord. Its function is unknown, though several potential functions related to \\"limbic‚Äìmotor integration\\" have been proposed, such as controlling visceral activity and pain; gating sensory input and synchronizing cortical and subcortical brain rhythms. Its dysfunction may play a role in central pain syndrome. It has also been identified as a promising deep brain stimulation therapy target for treating Parkinson's disease. Its existence was first described by Auguste Forel in 1877 as a \\"region of which nothing certain can be said\\". A hundred and thirty years later in 2007, Nadia Urbain and Martin Desch√™nes of Universit√© Laval noted that the \\"zona incerta is among the least studied regions of the brain; its name does not even appear in the index of many textbooks.\\" Structure This nucleus is located medially to the internal capsule, ventral to the thalamus, and is contiguous with the thalamic reticular nucleus. The nucleus separates the lenticular fasciculus from the thalamic fasciculus (also known as the \\"field H1 of Forel\\") . Its cells are very heterogeneous differing widely in their shape and size. Its chemoarchitecture is also diverse containing up to 20 different types of neurochemically defined cells. It has been noted that \\"There are few diencephalic regions that have as much cellular and neurochemical diversity\\". In the rat four areas are usually identified. * a rostral sector that has densely packed spindle-shaped cells and scattered larger oval shaped cells. * a dorsal sector that has medium-sized oval-shaped cells. * a ventral sector made up of medium-sized multipolar or fusiform shaped cells that are more densely packed than the cells in the dorsal sector * a caudal sector made up of small and medium-sized somata that are either multipolar, fusiform or rounded in shape, together with a group of very large multipolar-shaped cells located medially. This is sometimes called the motor part of the zona incerta nucleus. This is the area targeted by deep brain stimulation area when the zona incerta is targeted in the treatment of Parkinson Disease. These areas lack clear cell-free borders and merge into each other. Zona incerta neurons have dendrites with a wide span 0.8 mm and their axons give off collaterals that arborized locally within the zona incerta providing a means for lateral inhibition. The ventral area of the zona incerta has been described as having \\"a network of GABAergic cells with widespread interconnections, so that cells in one subsector may influence the activity of cells in a different subsector\\". The zona incerta together with the hypothalamus is one of the two areas of the brain that produces the neuropeptide melanin concentrating hormone. Dopaminergic ones are also more prevalent. There are in addition populations of cells producing somatostatin, angiotensin II and melanocyte stimulating hormone. =Connections= The zona incerta has connections to the cerebral cortex, diencephalon, basal ganglia, brainstem and spinal cord. ;Cerebral cortex Projections to the zona incerta arise across the cortical mantel from the frontal to the occipital lobes. The heaviest projections are from cingulate cortex, frontal and parietal areas. The head area of the body seems from these areas to have the largest representation in the zona incerta. These projections preferentially go to cortical layer I neurons. There are projections from the zona incerta back to the cerebral cortex. ;Diencephalon Projections with the diencephalon are reciprocal and mainly to the thalamus such as the intralaminar nucleus (parafascicular nucleus and central lateral nucleus) and higher-order nuclei such as the lateral posterior nucleus. The zona incerta avoids the thalamus nuclei of the primary sensory areas such as the ventral posterior nucleus of the somatosensory system and the lateral geniculate of the visual system. Rostral zona incerta also sends inhibitory projections to paraventricular thalamus with GABAergic neurotransmission. ;Hypothalamus Projections to the hypothalamus through incertohypothalamic pathway go mainly to the paraventricular nucleus areas in the anterior hypothalamus, lateral hypothalamus, lateral preoptic area, horizontal diagonal band of Broca, and the parvocellular region of the paraventricular nucleus. ;Basal ganglia Zona incerta is connected in the basal ganglia to the substantia nigra (both pars compacta and pars reticulata) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (but only its pars dissipata area). It also has less important connections to the entopeduncular nucleus and globus pallidus. These projections are glutamatergic and excitatory rather than GABAergic and inhibitory. The zona incerta also receives input from these areas. ;Cerebellum The cerebellum sends a significant number of fibers to the zona incerta. These projections originate from various cerebellar nuclei and are glutamatergic. Given the cerebellar contributions to motor learning, timing and coordination, the interactions between the cerebellum with the zona incerta are likely to have profound influence on motor functions. ;Brainstem Zona incerta receives input from many parts of the brainstem nuclei including the periaqueductal gray, raphe nuclei, thalamic reticular nucleus, and the deep layers of the superior colliculus. It is regulated by inputs from brainstem cholinergic nuclei such as the Laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and pedunculopontine nucleus upon its neuron‚Äôs muscarinic receptors. ;Spinal cord Zona incerta afferents terminate within the spinal cord gray matter, particularly the anterior horn, while spinal projections back to the zona incerta arise from cells located across the posterior horn and intermediate gray. ;Other Zona incerta also has connections to the amygdala, basal forebrain, the osmoreceptors in the subfornical organ, olfactory bulb, posterior pituitary and habenula. Some of these projections appear in register; the representation of the same body part in cortex and spinal cord connect to the same areas in the zona incerta. This is possibly so with the superior colliculus. Function ;Visceral survival activities. Zona incerta controls such activities as water and food intake, sexuality and cardiovascular activity. This control is related to its effects upon the nearby posterior hypothalamus with which it shares similar connections and neurochemically defined cell types. Besides, activation of GABA neurons in rostral zona incerta evokes binge eating behavior with a preference to sweet and high-fat food. The inhibitory projection from zona incerta to paraventricular thalamus contributes to binge-like eating produced by zona incerta GABA neuron activation. The zona incerta receives pain input through the spinothalamic tract and this has been shown to control the activity of the pain transmission pathway in the posterior thalamus. Electrical or chemical stimulation of the zona incerta creates limbic-related movements, such as those associated with defense orientation and copulation. ;Sensory-motor activities. At rest sensory input to the higher sensory areas of the cerebral cortex is gated through the thalamus. It has moreover been proposed that the zona incerta provides a top-down disinhibitory mechanism of this gating when there is sensory-motor activity such as the tactile use of whiskers. This has also been linked to sensory gating changes between sleep and waking. In this occurs a zona incerta mediated inhibition of thalamic nuclei such the somatosensory posterior medial thalamus. This is most strong when cholinergic input to the zona incerta is reduced as during slow-wave sleep and during anesthesia. The consequence of this has been explained upon information processing: > As a result, posterior medial thalamus neurons fail to respond to ascending > sensory inputs, and function primarily in \\"higher-order\\" mode, concerned > with relaying trans-cortical information. By contrast, increased cholinergic > activity during wakefulness and enhanced vigilance suppresses zona incerta > -mediated inhibition, thereby ungating posterior thalamus responses to > ascending inputs. The zona incerta projects to the superior colliculus and these link to the initiation of orientating eye and head movements. In monkeys for example neuronal activity in the zona incerta \\"pauses\\" before the start of a saccade and resumes at the end of a saccade. ;Synchronizing cortical and subcortical brain rhythms and integration. The GABAergic input received from the cerebral cortex has been suggested to synchronize thalamocortical and brainstem rhythms by providing a link between basal ganglia output and the cerebello-thalamo cortical loop. This allows it to synchronize oscillations generate by the basal ganglia during the preparation and execution of intended movements. One function of the loop is to carry movement instructions to the motor cortex through zona incerta output to the ventral lateral nucleus neurons in the cerebello-thalamocortical loop and to brainstem motor neurons in the medial reticular formation and midbrain extrapyramidal area. This acts to synchronize the basal ganglia areas involved in planning and execution of the movement with those in the brainstem controlling axial and proximal limb muscles with those areas in the motor cortex that control distal limb movements. ;Synthesis John Mitrofanis at the University of Sydney has proposed a general theory that might underlie some of the above. > The zona incerta is in a position to form a primal synaptic interface of the > diencephalon, linking diverse sensory channels to appropriate visceral, > arousal, attention and posture-locomotion responses. The different sensory > inputs, whether exteroreceptive (somatic) or interoreceptive (visceral), > influence these activities by driving zona incerta cells with different > projection patterns and functions; each of these cells may be located in > different sectors of the zone‚Ä¶ In essence, it is suggested that the zona > incerta has the pathways to integrate both exteroreceptive (e.g. > somatosensory) and interoreceptive (e.g. thirst) sensory challenges, so that > visceral activity, arousal, attention and/or posture locomotion are altered > and/or generated. The zona incerta could form a neural niche in the thalamus > from where these responses are \\"recruited\\" immediately, as to give an > instant response. Clinical significance =Parkinson's disease= Parkinson's disease might disrupt the zona incerta as it is hyperactive in parkinsonian experimental animals. In humans with Parkinson's disease, surgical lesion of the zona incerta alleviates their parkinsonian motor symptoms. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in those with Parkinson's disease has identified the zona incerta as a promising target area for effective therapy. Unlike deep bilateral stimulation of the ventral lateral nucleus such stimulation of the zona incerta improves all aspects of tremor including both the distal and proximal parts of limbs and the body more generally. This also occurs without dysarthria and disequilibrium as this stimulation does not interrupt proprioceptive sensation and the processing of the fine motor skill movements of vocal cords. Researchers observed that \\"The ventral lateral nucleus has long been established as an effective surgical target for controlling distal limb tremor, including Parkinson Disease tremor. However, because it receives predominantly cerebellar afferents and no direct basal ganglia afferents, the reason why it is effective in controlling Parkinson Disease tremor has remained a paradox. The conduction of abnormal oscillations generated in the basal ganglia in Parkinson Disease to the ventral lateral nucleus via zona incerta would therefore explain this paradox and also explain why we observed such a potent anti-tremor effect from stimulating zona incerta in our patients with Parkinson Disease\\" The study further noted that deep brain stimulation upon the zona incerta \\"is effective in suppressing all components of tremor affecting both the distal and proximal part of the body. These results, if replicated in larger randomised controlled studies, have important implications for our current surgical management of patients with tremor and point to a more promising target area than the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus.\\" =Central pain syndrome= Central pain syndrome is pain initiated or caused by injury or dysfunction in the central nervous system. Recent research suggests that the development and maintenance of such pain could link to abnormal inhibitory regulation by the zona incerta of the posterior thalamus. It has been suggested that there exists > a significant suppression of both spontaneous and evoked activity in > inhibitory neurons in zona incerta and abnormally high spontaneous and > evoked activity of neurons in posterior thalamus in animals with central > pain syndrome. The positive association between behavioral and > neurophysiological thresholds in rats with central pain syndrome is > consistent with a causal role for suppressed incerto-thalamic inputs in > central pain syndrome.

It is on the Borderlands Line. The station and all trains serving it are operated by Transport for Wales. In 2008 the station was refurbished. The station was previously known as Heswall Hills, as there was previously another station serving Heswall, on the Birkenhead Railway's branch line from West Kirby to Hooton, that is now a footpath known as the Wirral Way. History The railway line between and was authorised on 31 July 1885, and was originally to be a line jointly owned by the Wirral Railway (WR) and the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway (WMCQ), but in 1889 the WR share was transferred to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;). Construction began in 1892; the line went through several changes of name, and by the time of its opening (goods 16 March 1896, passengers 18 May), was known as the North Wales and Liverpool Joint Railway. A station known as Heswall Hills was opened two years later, on 1 May 1898. The MS&LR; in due course became the Great Central Railway (GCR), which absorbed the WMCQ on 1 January 1905, so that by the time of the 1923 Grouping the line was wholly owned by the GCR, and so became part of the London and North Eastern Railway on 1 January 1923. Heswall Hills station was renamed Heswall on 7 May 1973. =Freight and goods= The station had an extensive goods yard with sidings to the south-west of the station, where daily shunting operations were carried out until the advent of diesel railcar operations in 1960, at which time light freight operations ceased. Although, the yard was still used until 30 October 1965. The goods yard and sidings were sold off for housing development in about 1967. However, the line continued to be used for heavy freight, as iron ore freight trains also passed through the station. These freight trains operated from Bidston Dock to the John Summers steelworks in Shotton. The steam locomotives could be heard at night for at least five miles climbing Storeton Bank, from Upton station to Heswall. The Class 9F locomotive 92203, later named as Black Prince, worked the final steam-hauled iron ore train in November 1967. The freight service itself ended around 1980. Future Proposals have been put forward to electrify the track as part of the Borderlands Electrification scheme. Merseyrail would like to see the line electrified to link with its own third-rail service, with a doubling of the frequency of services. This would allow the station to serve as a part of a direct service to Liverpool. In June 2018 it was announced that, as part of the new KeolisAmey franchise to operate the Wales and Borders rail service, the frequency of trains on the line would increase to 2tph from December 2021. Facilities The station facilities are somewhat rudimentary, and the station is unstaffed at nearly all times. Each of the two platforms has a waiting shelter with seating. There is a payphone, and live departure and arrival screens for passenger information, but no booking office. There is a small station car park, with space for 16 cars. Wheelchair and pram access to the platforms is possible, via the access ramps. Services From Monday to Saturday, there is an hourly service between Bidston and Wrexham Central (two-hourly in the evening and on public holidays). There is a service every 90 minutes each way on Sundays. Services are provided by an Transport for Wales Class 150/2 \\"Sprinter\\" DMU.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 17, 1996. It was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wes Archer. Kirk Douglas guest stars as Chester J. Lampwick, Alex Rocco as Roger Meyers Jr., Jack Sheldon as an anthropomorphic constitutional amendment, Suzanne Somers as herself, and Phil Hartman as Lionel Hutz. The end of the episode features Lester and Eliza, who resemble Bart and Lisa Simpson as they appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show in the 1980s. In the episode, Bart meets a homeless man, Chester J. Lampwick, who claims that he is the creator of Itchy from The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Lampwick sues Itchy & Scratchy Studios for stealing his idea. After a Judge awards Lampwick US$800 billion, the studio is forced into bankruptcy and closes. When The Itchy & Scratchy Show is replaced by a parody of Schoolhouse Rock!s \\"I'm Just a Bill\\" segment, Bart and Lisa try to bring back Itchy & Scratchy by studying copyright laws and legal precedents. The episode finished 47th in ratings for the week of March 11‚Äì17, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 9.2. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode received a generally positive reception from television critics. DVD Movie Guide and the Los Angeles Daily News enjoyed the episode's focus on The Itchy & Scratchy Show. Plot alt=Two images, one below the other. Above, a boy holds a microphone while gesturing to a girl, who waves towards an audience. Below, a boy and a girl are stationary on their bicycles. During a parade honoring The Itchy & Scratchy Show, Bart meets an elderly homeless man, Chester J. Lampwick, who claims to be the creator of Itchy, the mouse. He insists Roger Meyers Sr., the supposed creator of the characters Itchy & Scratchy, stole his idea. He shows Bart his 1919 animated short, Manhattan Madness, to prove he created Itchy, but the film catches fire and is destroyed by the projector. Bart lets Lampwick live at the Simpsons' house, but soon Marge wants him gone after he and Grampa fight. To compensate Lampwick for creating Itchy, he and Bart ask Roger Meyers Jr., CEO of Itchy & Scratchy Studios, for $800 billion. Meyers promptly throws them out. Lampwick sues Itchy & Scratchy Studios with the help of Bart and attorney Lionel Hutz. When Meyers' lawyer demands proof that Lampwick created Itchy, Bart remembers that he saw an original animation cel by Lampwick for sale at the Android's Dungeon. Bart buys the cel from Comic Book Guy and shows the courtroom its inscription, proving that Lampwick is the creator of Itchy. Meyers concedes that his father stole the Itchy character, but contends that most animation is based on plagiarism. The judge rules in favor of Lampwick and orders Meyers to pay him $800 billion. Bart is pleased that Lampwick is no longer poor, but he is sad when he realizes he has inadvertently killed The Itchy & Scratchy Show because the studio is forced to close after going bankrupt. Bart and Lisa find a legal precedent that could help resurrect the cartoon, but they discover that two other kids, Lester and Eliza, have beaten them to it. Lester and Eliza secure a large cash settlement for the studio when they realize that the design of Mr. ZIP, the post office mascot, was stolen from Roger Meyers Sr. Despite being happy that Itchy & Scratchy are back on the air, Bart and Lisa are disturbed that their spotlight has been stolen by two children who closely resemble them. Production During their tenure as executive producers of The Simpsons, Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein tried to include one episode related to The Itchy & Scratchy Show in every season.Oakley, Bill (2005). Commentary for \\"The Day the Violence Died\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. \\"The Day the Violence Died\\", written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Wes Archer, was The Itchy & Scratchy Show-related episode for the seventh season, and became a vehicle for jokes about animation.Weinstein, Josh (2005). Commentary for \\"The Day the Violence Died\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Seventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. After completing the episode, Oakley commented, \\"This episode is one of the craziest episodes ever, I would dare say. It is so packed with references and inside jokes and the ending is so bizarre that a lot of people didn't understand it.\\" The episode was considered polarizing. In one of its jokes, Bart asks Homer for a large sum of money and Homer immediately pulls out his wallet. Oakley described the scene as \\"very controversial\\" among the show's producers; Matt Groening, the creator of The Simpsons, in particular did not like it. In Swartzwelder's original script, the \\"Amendment to Be\\" segment was a cartoon that was consciously a parody of the humor style of The Simpsons, but the producers felt that it was not funny. As a result, it was replaced by the \\"Amendment to Be\\" cartoon, which is a parody of the \\"I'm Just a Bill\\" segment of the educational television series Schoolhouse Rock. Worried about potential lawsuits, the lawyer of The Simpsons made the animators change the design of the senator in the segment. Weinstein did the voice of the \\"Curly amendment\\" in the segment, claiming the other voice actors \\"couldn't do it exactly right.\\" The end of the episode features Lester and Eliza, who save Itchy & Scratchy Studios. Bart and Lisa typically solve problems in the show, but the writers decided to try something different and have a new pair of characters take their positions. Lester's design is a slightly altered version of Bart's design in The Tracey Ullman Show and is voiced by Tress MacNeille, who normally voices Bart on temporary tracks. Kirk Douglas (pictured in 1994) guest stars in the episode as the voice of Chester J. Lampwick. American actor Kirk Douglas guest stars in the episode as Chester J. Lampwick. William Hickey, not Douglas, was the producers' first choice for the role, who they described as \\"famous for being a grouchy, mean old man\\". Oakley and Weinstein, who often search for \\"the absolutely perfect voice\\" when looking for guest stars rather than simply using celebrities, felt that Hickey's gruff raspy voice would be perfect for the role, but he turned them down. In Nancy Cartwright's autobiography My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, she comments that the episode's script was a \\"gem\\" and recalls that Kirk Douglas' recording session, directed by Josh Weinstein, was fraught with interruptions. He refused to wear the earphones supplied to him in the recording studio, saying they hurt his ears, so he was unable to hear Weinstein from his booth. Cartwright directed Douglas, who was in a hurry and said that he would do two takes per line at the most. However, despite reading his lines all at once, he only had trouble with one scene; the scene in which Lampwick tells Bart he created Itchy & Scratchy required three takes, as Douglas continuously misread the line \\"I changed all that\\" as \\"I charged all that\\". Cartwright managed to get him to do a third reading of the line by pretending to sneeze during his second take. In his script, Swartzwelder randomly paired David Brinkley and Suzanne Somers together as the parade commentators. The producers were unable to get Brinkley to play his part, so he was instead voiced by Harry Shearer. However, they were successful in getting Somers to voice herself. Roger Meyers, Jr. was voiced by Alex Rocco, who also voiced the character in the episode \\"Itchy & Scratchy & Marge\\"; while the character had reappeared in several episodes, in those instances he was voiced by Hank Azaria. The episode also stars Pamela Hayden and Tress MacNeille, and Phil Hartman as lawyer Lionel Hutz. Cultural references Roger Meyers, Sr. being cryogenically frozen is a reference to the myth that Walt Disney was frozen. The entire plot, revolving around the legal question of who created the anthropomorphic mouse Itchy, is also a reference to the controversy over whether Mickey Mouse was created by Walt Disney or his animator Ub Iwerks. When Roger Meyers Jr. pleads his case in court, he mentions that several animated television series and characters were plagiarized from other series and characters: \\"Animation is built on plagiarism! If it weren't for someone plagiarizing The Honeymooners, we wouldn't have The Flintstones. If someone hadn't ripped off Sergeant Bilko, there'd be no Top Cat. Huckleberry Hound, Chief Wiggum, Yogi Bear? Hah! Andy Griffith, Edward G. Robinson, Art Carney.\\" The Manhattan Madness cartoon in \\"The Day the Violence Died\\" is based on one of the first animated cartoons Gertie the Dinosaur. The \\"Amendment To Be\\" segment is a parody of the educational show Schoolhouse Rock, and more specifically \\"I'm Just a Bill\\", and refers to the Flag Desecration Amendment. Jack Sheldon, who sang the original song in \\"I'm Just a Bill\\", voices the song in the \\"Amendment to Be\\" segment. The cartoon \\"Itchy and Scratchy Meets Fritz The Cat\\" is a reference to the 1972 animated film Fritz the Cat that depicts drug use and sexual situations openly. Fritz the Cat was also the first animated movie to be rated X, before the NC-17 rating existed. The first Itchy & Scratchy cartoon entitled \\"Steamboat Itchy\\", which originally appeared in \\"Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie\\", is a reference to Steamboat Willie, the first Mickey Mouse sound cartoon to be released, and Joseph P. Kennedy, father of former United States President John F. Kennedy, is listed as one of the cartoon's producers. The episode's title alludes to the line \\"the day the music died\\" from Don McLean's 1971 song \\"American Pie\\". Reception In its original broadcast, \\"The Day the Violence Died\\" finished 47th in the ratings for the week of March 11‚Äì17, 1996, with a Nielsen rating of 9.2. The episode was the highest rated show on the Fox network that week. \\"The Day the Violence Died\\" received generally positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson enjoyed the episode and called it a \\"hoot\\", praising Harry Shearer's impression of David Brinkley. \\"It's hard to top the original Itchy cartoon ‚Äì where else can you see a cartoon mouse kill both an Irishman and Teddy Roosevelt?\\", said Jacobson, further complimenting the episode's twist ending: \\"For once, when Bart and Lisa team up to do the right thing, it backfires badly.\\" He also applauded the casting of Kirk Douglas as a guest star, and ended the review by calling the episode a \\"winner\\". Total Films Nathan Ditum named Douglas the 18th best guest star on The Simpsons. DVD Movie Guide claimed that any show focused on The Itchy & Scratchy Show is \\"hard to beat\\" and the Los Angeles Daily News considered this a \\"cause for joy\\". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict said that the best part of the episode is during The Itchy & Scratchy Show copyright trial, when lawyer Lionel Hutz \\"stalls for time by calling all of his surprise witnesses again: a ventriloquist and his dummy, Santa Claus with a broken leg, a caricature of John Swartzwelder, Ralph Wiggum, and the fattest twins in The Guinness Book of World Records\\". Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B-. The episode was considered a classic by The Rockford Register Star, which enjoyed the \\"perfect parody of the old 'Schoolhouse Rock' cartoon, 'I'm Just a Bill. DVD Movie Guide \\"loved\\" the first The Itchy & Scratchy Show cartoon, \\"Itchy & Scratchy Meet Fritz the Cat\\". In the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Unofficial \\"Simpsons\\" Guide by Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, they comment that \\"The Day the Violence Died\\" is \\"a great episode, with some clever observations on ideas and copyright, and a superb ‚Äì and sinister ‚Äì twist ending featuring the return of both Bart and Lisa from their days on The Tracey Ullman Show\\". Columbia University offered a course that analyzed The Simpsons during the September 2005 school term. In one of the classes, entitled \\"The Simpsons' Self-Referentiality\\", students viewed \\"The Day the Violence Died\\", and later considered one of the episode's most memorable quotes to be: \\"Bart: 'Lisa, if I ever stop loving violence, I want you to shoot me.' Lisa: 'Will do.

Whether he was a Marja' (Grand Ayatollah) was disputed. His calls for radical political reform in Iran were very controversial and in 2010 the government-sponsored \\"Qom Theological Lecturers Association\\" (Jame-e-Modarressin) declared him no longer qualified for emulation as a Grand Ayatollah. However, many of his followers continued to consider him their Marja, and this was acknowledged by several influential Maraji such as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Naser Makarem Shirazi, Abdul-Karim Mousavi Ardebili and Hossein Noori Hamedani. Family, early life, and education Saanei was born in the Persian month of Aban 1318 SH and in the month of Shaban 1458 AH in the semi-desert farming village of Yingabad (now Nikabad), 60 km (37 mi) southwest of Isfahan. He was the third of four children (a fifth child died in infancy) of Hujjud-al-Islam Mohammed Ali Saanei (1892‚Äì1974) and his wife Sharbonoo (1899‚Äì1947). His father, despite having lost his own father at the age of six, and being partially sighted rose from untrained village mullah to study in hawza in his thirties, going on to serve his community for fifty years. Mohammad Ali's father Hajjmulla Yousef Yingabadi (1867‚Äì1899) was an Isfahan-trained cleric known for his strong sense of social justice, was active in the Isfahan-area activities of Ayatollah Shirazi's tobacco movement in the early 1890s. At age six he began his education at the local maktab, later studying at home with his father after the latter noticed his intellect, studying the Quran and other basic texts of the period. Shortly before his tenth birthday, in the autumn of 1947, together with his father and brother Hassan (who also became a cleric and political official) he left for hawza in Isfahan, studying at that city's Kasseh Garan Madrassa (his father later returned to Nikabad). In Isfahan, his most noted teacher was the historian Allamah Mirza Mohammed Ali Habib Abadi (1890‚Äì1976). Saanei completed his preliminary studies (the equivalent of secondary school) in 1951, whereupon he went to Qom to continue his studies. 1955 saw Saanei place well in the first-level examinations (equivalent to a bachelor's degree) thus awarded the commendation of Grand Ayatollah Borujerdi. While at Qom he was a student of the leading theologians of his day, among them Mohammad Mohaghegh Damad, Abbas Ali Shahroudi, Mohammad Ali Araki, and Borujerdi himself for about a year. His most lasting education came from the seven years he spent being taught by Khomeini until the latter's exile in 1964. At the age of 22, he was granted the degree of Ijtihad allowing him to formulate religious judgements for his own use. In September 1964, Ayatollah Saanei married Khanum Shafiei (d. 2012) and has two sons and a daughter. One son, Fakruddin (Saeed) is also a cleric, with the honorific of Hujjud-al-Islam. Career He taught regularly in the hawza of Qom beginning in the 1950s. In 1975, Saanei became a teacher at the Haghani School of Divinity. Later he became Grand Ayatollah. In 1980, he was appointed chairman of the Guardian Council. Saanei retired from the council in 1983 and has not held any political office since. According to the CBS GlobalPost, Saanei has been considered \\"the successor\\" of Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri and as \\"the spiritual leader\\" of the Iranian political opposition movement.CBSnews.com, Iran Unrest Could Boil Over January 16, Anniversary of the Fall of the Shah Could Spark Next Round of Demonstrations, 5 January 2010 After the urging of many students and scholars, Saanei published his risalah in 1993, thus becoming a Marja', or source of imitation on matters of religious law to others. Death Ayatollah Saanei fell at his Qom home on the night of 10 September, fracturing his pelvis and arm. Due to preexisting conditions (he suffered from Diabetes-related kidney problems, as well as sorosis of the liver, he died during dialysis treatment before surgery could be safely performed to repair his injuries.https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/452379/Ayatollah-Saanei-passes-away https://ifpnews.com/iranian-cleric-grand-ayatollah-saanei-passes-away He died shortly after the time of Fajr prayer on 12 September 2020.

It is self-evident in Islam that it is prohibited to have nuclear bombs. It is eternal law, because the basic function of these weapons is to kill innocent people. This cannot be reversed.\\" Ayatollah Yousef Saanei said clerical authorities have quietly expressed opposition to the development of weapons of mass destruction for many years, and he described it as the reason that Iran never retaliated with chemical weapons when Saddam Hussein used them to kill Iranian troops and Iran-backed Kurds during the 1980‚Äì 88 Iran-Iraq war. \\"You cannot deliberately kill innocent people,\\" he said. =Women= He has declared that women have equal status in Islam. Saanei held that a woman can lead a man in prayer, although a man leading is mustahab, and that a Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim man. https://t.me/saanei_office/4212 Like Zohreh Sefati, he believed that women can even become a marja' in Islam, i.e. that men and women can follow a female Islamic jurists' ijtihad. =Suicide bombing= He is particularly noteworthy for issuing a fatwa in which he declared suicide bombing as haram and a \\"terrorist act\\". =2009 Iranian election= During the 2009 Iranian election protests, rumours arose that he had issued a religious edict proclaiming that Mr. Ahmedinejad was \\"not the president and that it is forbidden to cooperate with his government.\\" These rumours were reported as such by several internet news agencies. =Forced confessions= He is reported to have said during an August 12 speech at Gorgan that \\"Confession in prison and detention has not been and is not valid ... all persons who have somehow been involved in issuing these confessions are sharing same sin ... they will receive the retribution of their perfidious acts in this world and in a fair, righteous court.\\"TehranBureau.com, Ayatollah Watch.

He held that the wilyiat al Faqi should have the support of the people (i.e. be elected). =Ethnic minorities= Having studied in clerical schools in Qom, Iraq and Tabriz; Saanei was raised fluent in the Persian, Arabic and Azerbaijani languages. After the death of Hossein Ali Montazeri According to one report, Saanei was likely to replace Hossein-Ali Montazeri as the leading clerical opponent of the regime and to be even more aggressive. Saanei declared the government illegitimate and warned that it \\"cannot reverse the situation in the country with terror, killing, torture and imprisonment.\\"TimesOnline.co.uk, Ayatollah's death stirs Iranian opposition to bitter protests A day after the funeral procession of Montazeri, around 1,000 members of Iran's Basij militia and \\"plainclothes men\\" attacked offices of Saanei in the central shrine city of Qom, a reformist website reported on 22 December 2009. The plainclothes militiamen broke the windows of Saanei's office and insulted him and his staff and also beat up his staff. They also put up posters of Iran's supreme leader Ali Khamenei, who has been a staunch defender of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's controversial June re- election and who ordered a post-election crackdown on opposition protests. Police sided with the militia and prevented Saanei's supporters from defending his office, the website said. There was no immediate official comment. However, earlier on Tuesday, the semi-official Fars News Agency said pro- government theology students had staged a rally in Qom to protest \\"the insult against sanctifies\\" during Montazeri's funeral procession. The demonstration ended outside Saanei's home, Fars said, but it was not clear whether it was linked to the attack on Saanei's house reported by the aforementioned reformist website. The demonstrators chanted \\"The city of Qom is no city for hypocrites,\\" and signed a statement calling for Saanei to be defrocked, Fars reported. One of the signatories, cleric Ahmad Panahian, said: \\"The trenches of the hypocrites in Qom must be destroyed.\\"Google.com, Iran militiamen attack offices of pro-reform cleric: websiteNYtimes.com, Iran Militia Attack Pro ‚Äì Reform Cleric Home ‚Äì Website On 3 October 2010, news sites linked with Iran's political opposition movement reported that Saanei's website was blocked.

The body said that it had launched a yearlong investigation into the qualifications of Saanei in response to repetitive inquiries on the issue. In a statement bearing the signature of Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, the former head of Iran's judiciary, the body announced that the result of the investigation indicate that Saanei is not eligible to be a marja'. Conservatives and traditionalists condemned this move by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi of Hoze Modaresin to disqualify Ayatollah Saanei as a Marja', questioned the authority of the government sanctioned and subsidised association, and pointed out that even a renowned Marja' such as Ayatollah Sistani is not even listed by them as such.Iran move to defrock dissident ayatollah opens rifts in theocracy CSMonitor References External links *Saanei.org, official website * RoozOnline.com, An interview with Ayatollah Sanei Category:1937 births Category:2020 deaths Category:Muslim reformers Category:People from Isfahan Category:Islamic democracy activists Category:Sharia judges Category:Iranian grand ayatollahs Category:Iranian democracy activists Category:Members of the Guardian Council Category:Islamic Republican Party politicians ","title":"Yousef Saanei"},{"id":"3610428","text":"In the Shadow of the Palms (2005) is a documentary produced and directed by the Australian filmmaker Wayne Coles-Janess.

Although his act was captured by a motion picture camera, Polish press omitted any mention of the incident, which was successfully suppressed by the authorities. Siwiec prepared his plan alone, and few people realized what he tried to achieve with his sacrifice. His story remained mostly forgotten until the fall of communism, when it was first recounted in a documentary film by Polish director Maciej Drygas. Since then, Siwiec has been posthumously awarded a number of Czech, Slovak, and Polish honors and decorations. Siwiec's death foreshadowed the much better known self-immolation of Jan Palach in Prague four months later. Siwiec was the first person from Central and Eastern Europe to self-immolate in protest of the invasion, and one of three in Polish history (the other being Walenty Badylak and Piotr Szczƒôsny). Biography Siwiec was born in Dƒôbica on 7 March 1909, under the Austrian Partition of Poland, then part of Austria-Hungary. He graduated from the Lw√≥w University with a degree in philosophy. Siwiec worked as an accountant since the 1930s in Przemy≈õl, where he moved shortly after graduation. During World War II he escaped forced labour for the Germans by taking employment as a gardener and joined the Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the Polish resistance movement. Ryszard Siwiec married in 1945 and had five children. Self-immolation According to friends and family, he had extensive historical knowledge and was deeply disillusioned with the reality of communist Poland. He supported the protesting students during the March 1968 Polish political crisis in Poland, printing bibu≈Ça leaflets and asking his daughter to distribute them. According to health professionals, he was of sound mind, and fully rational, at the time of his suicide. Siwiec planned his self-immolation months in advance, writing out a last will in April, and leaving written and tape-recorded statements explaining his revulsion at both the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the People's Republic of Poland's participation in it. Siwiec obtained passes to a national harvest festival taking place on 8 September 1968 at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium in Warsaw. His goal was to have his act be witnessed by nearly 100,000 spectators, including numerous journalists and the national leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party. He set himself ablaze during one of the festival dances using a flammable solvent. This method of protest was likely inspired by recent series of similar protests by Buddhist monks in Vietnam, most notably that of Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c. He had a banner with the words \\"For our freedom and yours\\" and \\"Honour, Fatherland\\" as well as some leaflets, which he is said to have thrown around right before the incident, though neither attracted much attention, and both items are primarily mentioned only in the documents of the investigating secret police. He refused immediate help and shouted \\"I protest\\". He retained consciousness after the flames had been extinguished, giving brief statements, as well as later when he was transferred to a hospital (Szpital Praski), where he was able to communicate with the medical personnel, and where he received a brief visit from his wife. In the hospital, he was put under police surveillance, dying four days later on 12 September. Significance and remembrance The incident was immediately suppressed by the authorities. A story invented on the spot was that it was an accident caused by drinking vodka and smoking, or spontaneously combusting, aiming to divert interest to gossip and portray Siwiec as an irresponsible drunk. He was also declared mentally ill. Despite many attendees at the festival, there were relatively few witnesses, and the incident did not cause any delay in the main proceedings. Journalists and others knew that they would not be able to publish any photographs or movies, so those aware of the incident did not bother recording it other than by accident, nor did any try to investigate it afterward. Most of the few photographs of the incidents have been destroyed or forgotten and lost. Siwiec was censored out of official photographs of the Central Photographic Agency (Centralna Agencja Fotograficzna), which had a monopoly on issuing photos for the press in the era of communist Poland. His act was captured in a 7-second film by a motion picture camera of the Polish Film Chronicle, but the official newsreels of the festival omitted any mention of the incident. This footage however survived, mislabeled either by accident or purpose, until it was rediscovered over twenty years later. Polish secret police (S≈Çu≈ºba Bezpiecze≈Ñstwa) made a routine investigation that ended quickly due to the \\"death of the culprit\\", followed by routine low-key surveillance of his friends and family, during which it intercepted Siwiec's last letter to his wife (delivered decades later). Overall, the authorities had little trouble suppressing the events, as none of the relatively few witnesses have shown any particular desire to make the event more widely known. There was some gossip about the incident, with most people considering it a suicide rather than an accident, but the reason for it was unclear, and no one connected Siwiec's dramatic actions to contemporary political events. As publicist Stefan Kisielewski wrote in his diary two days after Siwiec's death, \\"There are rumours about a self- immolation [during the festival] but none knows the reason for it.\\" =Funeral= Siwiec' funeral in Przemy≈õl was well attended, but did not turn into a political manifestation; it was guarded by police, and secret agents spread rumors aimed at damaging Siwiec's reputation. His family reported that while some acquaintances were supportive and aware of Siwiec's true purpose, many turned away from them, either intimidated by the authorities or believing the stories that Siwiec had been drunk or mentally ill. Siwiec's timing has been described as unfortunate, as he chose to commit his act during a dance (mazurka), at which time his cry was muffled due to the sounds of an orchestra playing. Some, like Tomas Kavaliauskas or Krzysztof KƒÖkolewski, have speculated that if he had chosen to act moments earlier, during a speech by Polish communist leader W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka, first secretary of the Polish United Workers Party, the commotion he caused would have likely interrupted it and his message might have been witnessed more widely. Publicist Antoni Zambrowski noted that many other self-immolators like Czech Jan Palach had cooperated with anti-communist opposition movements and left messages and other documents which helped publicize their activities; Siwiec worked alone and so the Polish anti-communist opposition with which he identified with was not aware of his action and the meaning behind it until much later. Radio Free Europe learned about the incident a few days or months (sources vary) after the incident but did not consider the message reliable nor newsworthy, as the broadcaster was also unaware of its political context. This changed only after the famous self-immolation of Palach in Prague four months later, on 19 January 1969, and after RFE received more information, which clarified the political statement that Siwiec wanted to make. The RFE broadcast about Siwiec aired in February, March or April (sources vary) that year. If Palach became aware of Siwiec's actions, it would thus have been due to word of mouth, rather than from RFE. =Recognition= Through the efforts of his family and friends, information about Siwiec became known to the anti-communist Solidarno≈õƒá opposition in Poland by the 1980s. A brochure about him was published in 1981. After the fall of communism, Siwiec became the subject of the 1991 documentary film Hear My Cry (Us≈Çyszcie m√≥j krzyk), by Polish director Maciej Drygas. The film won several awards including the European Film Awards \\"Felix\\" prize for \\"Best Documentary\\" that year. Drygas, who is credited with reconstructing and popularizing Siwiec's story, remarked that compared to other similar incidents of that time, such as the self-immolations of Palach or Romas Kalanta, Siwiec death's is unique in how little attention it attracted. Jan Nowak-Jeziora≈Ñski, the director of the Polish section of Radio Free Europe, expressed a similar sentiment: \\"This was an unheard of human tragedy... The tragedy lay in that his sacrifice went completely unnoticed.\\" In the same vein, Kavaliauskas interprets Drygas' movie as a critique of contemporary Polish society, saying that witnesses did not want to have this incident spoil their enjoyment of the festival on an otherwise \\"perfect day\\". Following Drygas' movie, Ryszard Siwiec was posthumously awarded a number of Czech, Slovak and Polish state decorations. Memorial plaques dedicated to his memory exist in Warsaw, Dƒôbica and Przemy≈õl. A bridge in Przemy≈õl, where he lived, was named after him in 1991, as well as a street in Prague in front of the Czech Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes, with a nearby memorial dedicated to him, unveiled in 2010. A street in Warsaw was named for him in 2011. Nonetheless, as noted by Kavaliauskas in 2010, he still is less known than other self-immolators of his time. Plaque dedicated to Siwiec at the stadium Honours Siwiec was awarded the following honours posthumously: * Order of Tom√°≈° Garrigue Masaryk, first class, awarded in 2001 by V√°clav Havel, President of the Czech Republic. * Order of Polonia Restituta, Commander's Cross, awarded in 2003 by Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski, President of Poland. * Order of the White Double Cross, 3rd Class, awarded in 2006 by Ivan Ga≈°paroviƒç, President of Slovakia.

The film is about an injured gunfighter who is nursed back to health by a Quaker girl and her family whose way of life influences him and his violent ways. Angel and the Badman was the first film Wayne produced as well as starred in, and was a departure for this genre at the time it was released. Writer-director James Edward Grant was Wayne's frequent screenwriting collaborator. In 1975, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. Plot Wounded and on the run, notorious gunman Quirt Evans (John Wayne) gallops onto a farm owned by Quaker Thomas Worth (John Halloran) and his family and collapses. When Quirt urgently insists upon sending a telegram, Thomas and his daughter Penelope (Gail Russell) drive him into town in their wagon. After wiring a claim to the land recorder's office, Quirt passes out, and Penny cradles him. Ignoring the doctor's advice to rid themselves of the gunman, the compassionate Worth family tends to the delirious Quirt, and Penny becomes intrigued by his ravings about past loves. Days later, when Quirt regains consciousness, Penny patiently explains the family's belief in non-violence. Three weeks later, Laredo Stevens (Bruce Cabot) and Hondo Jeffries (Louis Faust) ride into town looking for Quirt. When Penny's younger brother Johnny (Stephen Grant) rushes home to warn Quirt of his visitors, Quirt quickly prepares to flee. Penny, now smitten with Quirt, offers to run off with him. At the sound of approaching horses, Quirt grabs his gun and discovers that it has been emptied. Training his weapon on the doorway, Quirt calmly greets Hondo and Laredo. Thinking that Quirt has the upper hand, Laredo offers to buy his claim. When Quirt sets the price at $20,000, Laredo hands over $5,000 in gold and challenges him to come for the balance when he is able ‚Äì if he has the nerve. Angel and the Badman Afterward, Quirt saddles his horse, but when Penny begs him to stay, he changes his mind. Later, Quirt learns that cantankerous rancher Frederick Carson (Paul Hurst) has dammed up the stream that runs through the valley, thus draining the Worths' irrigation ditches. Quirt intimidates Carson into opening the dam. One Sunday, Penny asks Quirt to join the family for a ride. Before they leave, Marshal Wistful McClintock (Harry Carey) comes to question Quirt about a stagecoach robbery. The family swears that Quirt was with them at the time. The marshal then asks Quirt why he resigned as Wyatt Earp's deputy, sold his ranch and crossed over to the wrong side of the law soon after cattleman Walt Ennis was gunned down in a saloon brawl. When Quirt refuses to answer, the marshal leaves. Penny then begs Quirt to steer clear of Laredo, and he acquiesces because of his love for her. As Quirt and the Worths ride to the Quaker gathering, Quirt's erstwhile sidekick, Randy McCall (Lee Dixon), tags along. Randy tells Quirt that Laredo plans to rustle a herd of cattle and suggests that they then steal the herd from Laredo and let him take the blame. Mr. Worth gives Quirt a Bible as a reward for ending the feud with Carson. Fearing that he will never be able to live up to Penny's expectations, Quirt abruptly leaves with Randy. Quirt recovering under the care of the two women (from left to right: Rich, Russell, and Wayne) Quirt and Randy steal the herd from the original rustlers. They then celebrate with showgirls Lila Neal (Joan Barton) and Christine Taylor (Rosemary Bertrand). When Lila, sensing a change in her old flame, teases Quirt about his Bible, Quirt becomes angry and rides back to the Worth farm. Overjoyed, Penny throws her arms around him, just as the marshal arrives to question Quirt about the rustling. Quirt states that Lila can provide him with an alibi. Penny is hurt that Quirt was with his old flame. She heard him talk about Lila in his delirium, and thinks that Quirt prefers Lila's fair hair. Quirt realizes the depth of his feelings for Penny, and they kiss hungrily in the barn, while the camera fades out. The marshal warns Quirt that he is the wrong man for Penny. Quirt decides to propose to her anyway. Instead of replying, Penny invites Quirt to join her picking blackberries. Quirt answers Penny's questions about his early life. Kindly Walt Ennis raised him after his parents were massacred by Indians; then Ennis was murdered. On their way home, Quirt and Penny are ambushed and chased by Laredo and Hondo. Their wagon plunges over a cliff into the river. Penny develops a dangerous fever after the drenching. When the doctor informs Quirt that there is no hope for her, Quirt straps on his pistol and rides into town to exact revenge. After Quirt leaves, Penny's fever suddenly breaks. In town, Quirt sends Bradley to tell Laredo and Hondo that he is waiting for them in the street. Penny and her family arrive. She gets Quirt to surrender his gun to her.

Reception Upon the film's release, The New York Times reviewer wrote, \\"Mr. Wayne and company have sacrificed the usual roaring action to fashion a leisurely Western, which is different from and a notch or two superior to the normal sagebrush saga.\\" The reviewer continues: The reviewer concludes, \\"John Wayne makes a grim and laconic, converted renegade, who is torn by love, a new faith and the desire for revenge on an arch enemy. Gail Russell, a stranger to Westerns, is convincing as the lady who makes him see the light.\\" Remake The film was remade in 2009 for the Hallmark Channel by Terry Ingram, with Lou Diamond Phillips playing Quirt Evans and Wayne's grandson Brendan in a cameo appearance. The remake also stars Deborah Kara Unger as Temperance, Luke Perry as Laredo, and Terence Kelly as Thomas. Angel and the Badman also inspired two other successful \\"fish out of water\\" films: Witness (1985) starring Harrison Ford, and The Outsider (2003), starring Tim Daly and Naomi Watts.

The community is 16 kilometres north of the Town of Swan River. Bowsman was originally incorporated as a village in 1949.  History  Bowsman School, 1914 J.B. Tyrell, a surveyor, came up with the name \\"Bowsman\\" after the first man out of the bow of the boat who touched the land. Bowsman was originally known as \\"Bowsman River\\" because of the river. In 1952 the name was shortened to Bowsman. Bowsman completed their first municipal sewer lines and sewage treatment plant in October 1966. The project connected the majority of homes in town to the town sewer lines. For many people, this was the day that their outdoor pit toilet or \\"biffy\\" was replaced by an indoor flush toilet. Trucks hauled the discarded wooden biffies to make a large pile near the new sewage plant. On New Year's Eve, December 31, 1966, residents gathered to celebrate the beginning of Canada's Centennial year and the arrival of community sewer service by burning the pile of their old outhouses. A monument to commemorate the day of the \\"Biffy Burning\\" was dedicated on Canada Day, 1970. Bowsman's postal code was changed to R0L 0H0 which stands for \\"Roll Our Loyal Out Houses Over\\" in honour of this event.  Economy  The economy is supported by agriculture and logging.

Life Gamelbert is said to have been of noble descent and a lord of Michaelsbuch. In the mid-8th century he acquired from Duke Tassilo III a piece of woodland on the opposite bank of the Danube between Mariaposching and Deggendorf, for which he had to pay a tax known as the Medema. From this was derived the name of Metten both for the place itself and for the monastery, Metten Abbey, that was founded there. The first abbot was Gamelbert's godson Utto, who directed the construction of the monastery from his hermitage (the present Uttobrunn). In 766 twelve monks arrived from Reichenau Abbey as the first official occupants, although the place was well settled by then Other In art, Gamelbert is represented as a priest or as a pilgrim surrounded by birds. His feast is celebrated on 17 January. Grave finds from Uttenkofen near Michaelsbuch have been dated to the late 7th or early 8th century and have been associated with the founding family of Metten Abbey.

Relf was an all-rounder who batted in the middle order and bowled off-breaks at medium pace with great accuracy. He played Minor Counties cricket for Norfolk, a coaching engagement with the Earl of Wilton at Houghton Hall gaining him a residential qualification. At the age of 25, he returned to Sussex to play for the county of his birth, initially enjoying mixed success. At first he played as a batsman who bowled a bit, his bowling developed in 1903 to the point where he was picked for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour to Australia under Plum Warner. He played in two Tests, helping Tip Foster add 115 for the ninth wicket in his first match at Sydney. Most of Relf's 13-match Test career, though, was played on two tours to South Africa in 1905‚Äì06 and 1913‚Äì14, and he played only once against Australia in England, taking five wickets for 85 in a total of 350 at Lord's in 1909, but then being dropped to accommodate Sydney Barnes for the remainder of the series. In the first Test at Johannesburg in 1905‚Äì06, he bowled the ball, allegedly down the leg-side, that enabled South Africa to record the first-ever victory over England. Warner, again his captain, was reported to have sighed: \\"Oh, Albert. How could you?\\" In county cricket, Relf was prolific, achieving the \\"double\\" of 1000 runs and 100 wickets eight times, with a best in 1913 of 1846 runs and 141 wickets. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1914, where it was said of his batting style: \\"No one seeing him for the first time would suppose him capable of getting his hundreds in high- class company,\\" Wisden said. \\"He has a way of letting the ball hit the bat that is certainly not impressive to the eye. Still, the fact remains, that season after season he makes as many runs as men who look twice as good as he is.\\"Cricketers of the Year 1914: Albert Relf. Espncricinfo.com. Retrieved on 1 June 2018.

The funds raised included the generous donation of 100 guineas by his former captain, KL Ranjisinhji.

As one of the National Amenity Societies, The Georgian Group is a statutory consultee on alterations to listed buildings, and by law must be notified of any work to a relevant listed building which involves any element of demolition.  History  Founded in 1937 by Lord Derwent, Robert Byron and the journalist Douglas Goldring (who went on to become the first secretary), the Group was originally part of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, the poet and author Sir John Betjeman, Sir John Summerson, Robert Byron, the architect Sir Albert Richardson, Oliver Messel, and Sir Osbert Sitwell were among its most prominent early active members. Since 1971, The Georgian Group has been a national amenity society.  Work  The Georgian Group acts as a statutory consultee in the planning process in England and Wales, when consideration is being given to proposals to alter or demolish listed buildings dating, in whole or in part, from between 1700 and 1837. The Victorian Society plays a similar role for buildings built between 1837 and 1914. It is notified of many thousands of applications each year. (In Scotland the Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland, formerly the Georgian Group of Edinburgh, is now the relevant statutory consultee). The Group has a similar role in the Church of England and Church in Wales faculty systems, and also advises the internal planning bodies of the Methodist, Roman Catholic, Baptist and United Reformed Church, on alterations to listed churches and chapels, including on the re-ordering or removal of historic fixtures and fittings. In 2002 The Georgian Group introduced its annual awards which are aimed at recognizing exemplary conservation and restoration projects in the United Kingdom. An award is also given for high quality new buildings in a Georgian context. Its present headquarters is at 6 Fitzroy Square, London W1, a large Robert Adam town house which it has restored. Its extensive library and an important collection of architectural watercolours and engravings, the Pardoe Collection, are housed within its headquarters and are available for public examination by appointment. Since the early 1980s The Georgian Group has employed specialist regional caseworkers to undertake its advisory work within the planning process. Any member of the public can ask the Group for assistance in preventing the destruction of a Georgian building, although the Group's resources are limited. There are four casework regions: London and the South East, Central and Northern England, South West England and the Cotswolds, and Wales. The caseworkers are responsible to a Senior Caseworker and a committee of expert advisers. Recent senior caseworkers have included Clare Campbell MA, Andrew Martindale BA, and John Neale MA IHBC. Dr John Martin Robinson FSA was the founder of its specialist Casework Committee a group of architects, architectural historians and conservation professionals who regularly meet to discuss controversial development schemes. Its present (2017) Chairman is the architect Peregrine Bryant MA DipArch(Cantab) RIBA. The Georgian Group also has specialist representatives on conservation advisory panels in many English local authority areas including Brighton, Derby, Bristol and Newcastle upon Tyne. The Group also publishes works on the care and restoration of Georgian buildings and interiors. The Georgian Group's small grants fund for the repair and restoration of Georgian buildings, monuments and fixtures and fittings is called the F. E. Cleary Heritage Fund (commonly known as The Cleary Fund). Grants are normally awarded annually in October. The present (2017) Chairman is Christopher Boyle QC, who is restoring a large derelict listed country house in Cumbria.

Score is usually measured in the abstract unit of points (except in game shows, where scores often are instead measured in units of currency), and events in the game can raise or lower the score of different parties. Most games with score use it as a quantitative indicator of success in the game, and in competitive games, a goal is often made of attaining a better score than one's opponents in order to win. Video games In video games that feature scoring, points are usually an optional, side component of gaming. Players may achieve points through normal gameplay, but their score will often not have an immediate relevance to the game itself. Instead, playing to beat a \\"high score\\" set by the game program, another player or oneself becomes an extra challenge, adding replay value. In modern gaming, the presence of a score is not as ubiquitous as it was in the past. During the era of arcade games, when, because of the technical limitations of the time, games could not be \\"won\\" or \\"completed\\" but were instead endless cycles of continuous gameplay, points had a much greater relevance. Many modern games no longer keep track of scores, and many no longer feature an option to save or record high scores. However, some games, such as role-playing games, have experience points, skill points, and use money or treasure, which can all be used to buy or upgrade skills and objects. In fighting games, scoring a very high number of points could result in unlockable players or modes. In some games, reaching certain scores gives an extra life, or a continue. =Scoring= In puzzle games, scores are usually gained by solving the puzzles quickly. Higher scores can be gained by performing combos of puzzle solving. There is often a time bonus which can add extra points. The level number is often a multiplier on the points, so higher scores are possible on harder levels. Level multipliers can also be picked up in some games, to further multiply your points bonus. In other games, points are typically gained from defeating monsters and enemies. When defeating a boss, a proportionally large number of points is usually rewarded. Extra points can be gained from gathering items, such as power-ups or other pick- ups. Usually, when a player gets a certain number of points, they may get an extra life or go on to a higher level. Points can be often used as currency which can be redeemed for rewards and player upgrades. =High score= The high score of a video game is usually the highest logged point value. Many games will have a list of several high scores, called the high score table. History Sea Wolf, the first video game to use the term \\"high score\\". The concept of a high score first achieved cultural significance with the rise in popularity of pinball machines and electro-mechanical arcade games. Players who achieve a high score are often greeted with a congratulatory message and are able to enter their initials or name into the machine. Their score and name will remain there until someone \\"knocks\\" them off the high score list by achieving a higher score. For this reason, high scores are inherently competitive and may sometimes involve one-upmanship against other players. The high score has a close association to the \\"free game.\\" When in an arcade, many games will offer a player a free chance at another game if they achieve a high score. This has declined in popularity in recent years, as players are often allowed to play for as long as they can without losing, but not given free games even if they achieve a high score. The first video game to use the term \\"high score\\" was Midway's Sea Wolf (1976). The game saved the highest score achieved on the cabinet, but could be reset by a player at any time by pressing a button on the machine. The high score concept changed in 1978 with the release of Taito's shoot 'em up Space Invaders, where high scores were determined by gamers playing for as long as they could to stay alive, as high scores kept rising. The popularity of Space Invaders stemmed in part from players returning to beat the current high score, as players could now compete with each other over who had the highest score. In 1979, Space Invaders Part II Star Fire allowed players to enter initials next to their score. Since this data was stored in the machine's RAM, it was deleted every time the machine lost power, which in practice would almost invariably happen every night as operators preferred to leave the machines unplugged when the arcade was closed to avoid incurring unnecessary power costs. The popularity of the high score made it nearly ubiquitous and a defining feature for many games. Magazines such as Nintendo Power and Sega Visions would often publish high scores submitted by their readers. The high score became most popular when, starting in 1982, the Twin Galaxies Scoreboard began to appear in the pages of Video Games Magazine, Joystik Magazine, Computer Games Magazine, VideoGiochi Magazine, Video Games Player Magazine and Electronic Fun Magazine. Later, in the 1990s, all performances would have to be videotaped to verify the achievement. The high score also exists in online games in various forms. The spread of the Internet has made it possible to compete with the rest of the world, rather than the players of a single machine or game. Many modern games have the ability to post his/her high score to a central webpage. Online multiplayer games, especially first person shooters, real time strategies, and role-playing video games often have ranking systems. These new high score lists and ranking systems often are more complex than conventional high score lists. Some are based on tournaments, while others track game servers continuously, keeping statistics for all players. Some games include default \\"high scores\\" that do not actually represent real players, but are displayed whenever the machine's memory is reset, often with generic initials such as \\"AAA.\\" These scores often represent certain levels of achievement for a player to aspire to, ensuring that there is always something for players to compete with. Many video games also have default high scores built in, sometimes attributed to fictitious entities (e.g. Commander Keen) or to members of the game's development team. In popular culture The high score's prominence in video game culture, and even mainstream society has led to various pieces of art and entertainment. There is a cartoon titled High Score. There is also a book entitled High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games. A 2007 documentary, The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, follows the attempts to beat the high score in Donkey Kong. In an episode of the TV series Seinfeld, George is astonished to find that the Frogger machine he played as a teen still retains his high score. With the owners wanting to get rid of it, George decides to keep the machine for posterity, the catch being that he has to move the game without unplugging it, because if he unplugs the game the high score will be erased. Unfortunately, the machine is destroyed when he unsuccessfully tries to move it across the street in a spoof of the gameplay. On September 24, 2005, Twin Galaxies issued Poster #59, which publicized a $1,000 prize to the first gamer who could break George Costanza's fictitious Frogger high score of 863,050 points.Twin Galaxies' Poster #59, September 24, 2005 On August 1, 1982, the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard issued a colorful poster that listed the world record high scores for more than two dozen arcade video games. The poster was distributed among arcades worldwide. This was the first poster (#1) in a series of colorful posters that continues today, with poster #131 issued in October, 2008.Twin Galaxies' Tradition of Video Game Posters, 1982-2008 In an episode of Friends Chandler Bing puts in dirty words on all the high score positions on a Pac-Man machine. He then finds out that they are not blanked when the machine is reset so he has to break all his high scores to remove the offending words. (This is not possible on an actual Pac- Man machine; such machines only record one high score and do not allow the winning player to enter initials.) In the media According to the Twin Galaxies Intergalactic Scoreboard, \\"high-score\\" attempts enjoyed as much press coverage as any other video-game-related topic reported in the media during the 1982-1985 period. Though the media was often focused on the amazing growth of the video game industry, it was equally as fascinated with the human side of gaming, as typified by the \\"player vs machine\\" showdowns that led to new world record high scores set on nearly a daily basis. In fact, Twin Galaxies reports that during that early era it was not unusual for there to be multiple new world records reported in the media on a single day.

Both manuscripts are dated Dresden, 24 June 1722. Johann Mattheson mentioned the Labyrinthus musicus in his Critica musica (1722), describing Suppig as an organist in the Dresden suburbs. In 1863, the document was in the possession of Louis Kindscher of K√∂then who mentioned the work in the periodical Euterpe (22, 1863). Although the manuscripts were dedicated to the government of Dresden, the surviving documents surfaced in K√∂then in the 19th century.

It begins with an introduction by co-author Pierre Rigoulot describing Kang's new life in the Republic of Korea, then continues with a brief history of both North and South Korea since the Korean War in 1953. It shows how a powerful family with money and material goods has everything taken from them by the Workers' Party of Korea. Kang's family, while of Korean ethnicity, originally lived in Japan before emigrating to the DPRK at the behest of his communist grandmother. When Kang was nine years old, his grandfather was imprisoned for suspected activity against the State. Because of guilt by association (Sippenhaft), policy was to incarcerate the immediate family of political prisoners, Kang Chol-Hwan, his grandmother, father, uncle and younger sister Miho were all imprisoned at the Yodok concentration camp #2915. There they suffered and viewed many atrocities over a period of ten years including disease, starvation, torturous punishments and public executions. In the book, Kang states that, while in the camp, he met Pak Seung-zin, a member of the North Korean football squad in the 1966 FIFA World Cup. He says that Pak and other players had been imprisoned after returning from the tour. However, in the documentary film The Game of Their Lives, Pak and the other players were interviewed and they denied Kang's claim that there had been any retribution. Following his family's release (presumably upon the death of his grandfather, the original offender against the State), Kang worked in assigned occupations before becoming at risk of again being sent to a concentration camp. The end of the book details his subsequent escape to China and his attempts to seek asylum before escaping to South Korea. The most recent publication, in 2005, includes an account of his meeting with former U.S. President George W. Bush. Originally published in French in 2000, and translated into English in 2001 by Yair Reiner and later into Korean, it is one of the first published accounts of the North Korean prison system.

Although the area initially showed a high rate of growth in the 1850s and its founder believed that it would become an important centre of economic activity, growth stagnated when an all-important rail link bypassed it, and the community never grew larger than a small village. The self-proclaimed \\"Gateway to the Beaver Valley\\" recently lost its autonomy as a village when it was amalgamated with the surrounding Artemesia Township. Prehistory A paleolithic quartzite arrowhead that had been quarried north of the Great Lakes was discovered near Flesherton in 1974. Whether it was carried south to the Flesherton area around the east side of Georgian Bay, or dates back to a time when a land bridge existed between the Bruce Peninsula and Manitoulin Island, the arrowhead does point to prehistoric interaction between people of the Flesherton region and those of northern Ontario. Local archaeological digs indicate that by 1500 BCE, the area around Flesherton was settled by the Turtle First Nation, a member of the agrarian Petuns nation allied with the Hurons. Samuel de Champlain called them \\"Cheveux Rieleves\\"; later French traders referred to them as the Petuns (French for \\"tobacco growers\\"). Nineteenth century The Turtle First Nation continued to live in the Flesherton area until they surrendered their lands to the British Crown in 1818. =Settlement= In 1848, the land along the north-south Toronto-Sydenham road and the east-west Durham Road was surveyed and divided into 50-acre lots. The intersection of the two roads, which lay in a small valley, was named Artemesia Corners. To encourage settlement of the wilderness, the lots were granted to settlers, who then had to clear at least twelve of the acres within five years in order to receive free title to the lot. The first settler at Artemesia Corners was Aaron Munshaw Jr., a former member of Button's Troop during the War of 1812, and an active member of the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1838. Following the failed rebellion, he had fled into exile in the United States with William Lyon Mackenzie. In 1850, having been granted amnesty, Munshaw moved to Artemesia Corners and settled a 50-acre lot on the east side of the Toronto- Sydenham Road that straddled Durham Road. He built a small tavern and stagecoach stop at the intersection of the two roads. Munshaw's father, Aaron Sr., also moved to the area, becoming one of the first farmers in the district. Munshaw Hotel in 1895. (Compare to modern photograph above)William Kingston Flesher, a recent British immigrant, settled on the 50-acre lot on the opposite side of the Toronto-Sydenham Road from Munshaw in 1853 and built a saw mill, and then a grist mill on the Boyne River that flowed through the valley. Both Munshaw and Flesher also laid out the portions of their acreages as village lots, hoping to encourage people to move to the area. Throughout the 1850s, more settlers, mainly Scottish immigrants, claimed lots and began to clear the land; tradespeople quickly arrived and bought the village lots at Artemesia Corners. In 1864, as the village grew, Munshaw built a larger inn and stagecoach stop that incorporated some parts of the original hotel. This building, operated as a hotel by the Munshaw family until the 1960s, is now known as Munshaw House and still stands on the original spot. W.K. Flesher in captain's militia uniform, 31st \\"Grey\\" Regiment, at Niagara-on-the-Lake during the Fenian Raids of 1866. =Boom times= W.K. Flesher became a prominent local figure, acting at various times as postmaster, magistrate, druggist, and even doctor, as well as warden of Grey County (1855‚Äì1857, 1861‚Äì1862, 1865 and 1867), and reeve of the village (1854‚Äì1865 and 1866‚Äì1878). He organized a Masonic Lodge, and was a vocal booster of the village, convincing other businesses to settle in the area, including a woolen (fulling) mill owned by his son William Henry in 1863. Flesher also became captain of the local militia, No. 6 Company of the 31st Grey Regiment, and travelled with the regiment to train at Niagara-on-the-Lake during the Fenian Raids of 1866. In recognition of his contributions, the name of the settlement was changed first to Flesher's Corners, and then, when a more \\"village-like\\" name was seen as desirable, to Flesherton. The Gazetteer and Directory of the County of Grey for 1865-66 listed 27 prominent businessmen in the village and pointed out that much development had occurred recently: :\\"The Sawmill, the fulling mill, the stores, &c.;, are all the result of the last two or three years. The village has a post office, 3 stores, 2 taverns, several carpenters, a pump- maker, a blacksmith shop, a Sawmill, a carding and fulling mill, 2 churches, 2 resident clergymen, and a resident physician.\\" In 1872, Flesher was elected to the House of Commons as MP for the riding of Grey East, and he was re-elected in 1874. About this time, a mini-land boom ensued as speculators bet that the Toronto, Grey & Bruce Railway would pass through Flesherton. However, due to Flesherton's location in a valley, the railroad was routed around the edge of the valley 2 km (1.3 mi) to the west through the hamlet of Ceylon. The first train arrived in 1873 to much local celebration, but a serious blow had been dealt to the aspirations of the village. Flesherton Public School in 1903. Built in 1891, it was used as a schoolhouse until 1968, and was destroyed by fire in 2009. Flesherton C.P.R. Station, , located 2 km (1.3 mi) to the west of the villageMethodist circuit riders had been visiting the area since 1850, usually using someone's house or the parlour of the Munshaw Hotel for worship. By 1864, there were two wood-frame churches, a Methodist and a Wesleyan. In 1876, W.K. Flesher donated some of his land for construction of a permanent Methodist church. The red brick church was finished a year later, and dedicated on 18 November 1877 by Egerton Ryerson, provincial Minister of Education. Two years later, in 1879, the local Presbyterians erected Chalmers Presbyterian Church where the Toronto-Sydenham Road crossed the Boyne River. In 1886, Baptists built Cedar Springs Baptist Church at the east end of the village. In 1881, A.R. Fawcett published the first issue of the Flesherton Advance newspaper. In 1888, Fawcett sold the paper to Willard Thurston. Thurston, and eventually his son Frank, continued to publish the Advance until 1961. In 1891, W.K. Flesher donated land for the construction of a public school, which was built for about $1000. This large three-room yellow brick building became Flesherton Public School and served as the village children's elementary school until 1968. The year 1891 was also when telephone service was extended to Flesherton, and a village telephone exchange employed local women as operators until the introduction of dial service in 1967. In 1894, John Nuhn Sr. bought the woolen mill from Peter Campbell, who had purchased it in 1863, and was successful enough that Nuhn soon operated a mail order business across Canada for blankets, yarn, underwear and girls' black wool stockings. His son, John Jr., took over the business in 1931, and rebuilt another mill and warehouse when the original burned down in 1934. The mill continued to operate until the younger Nuhn's death in 1954. =Stagnation= By the mid-1880s, the nearby railway station in Ceylon was a busy place with three railyards, since goods travelling to western Canada‚Äîincluding troops sent to quell the Riel Rebellion of 1886‚Äîwere shipped up this line from Toronto to Owen Sound, and from there by boat to Lake Superior. However, the economic boom did not extend to the nearby village down in the valley. Although the train station was relatively close, new businesses balked at moving to the village, since their goods to be shipped by rail would first have to be hauled by horses out of the steep valley. Economic growth stagnated, and the population remained below 1000. Twentieth century Park House, originally built as a \\"temperance\\" hotelAt the turn of the 20th century, the Munshaw Hotel continued to serve alcohol despite the increasingly popular temperance movement, but local teetotalling businessmen raised funds in 1908 to build a hotel called Park House as a \\"dry\\" alternative. The hotel remained in business until the 1950s, and is now a private residence. Artemesia Rural High School.Smoking ruins of the Sproule Block.In 1910, the Artemesia Rural High School was built in Flesherton; students either rode from their farms to attend classes or boarded at Park House. That same year, a block of businesses on the north-east corner of the hamlet's main intersection, known as the T.J. Sproule Block, burned down due to unknown causes, destroying a quarter of the local businesses. In 1912, five years after the death of William Flesher in 1907, Flesherton was incorporated as a village. The following year, the coming of the automobile resulted in Flesherton's first gas station, attached to a hardware store. Cenotaph flanked by WWI-era Vickers machine gun and trench mortarTwo years later, in 1914, World War I broke out in Europe. Eighty-four local men enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, a significant percentage of the small village's population. Several were decorated for bravery, and 19 volunteers‚Äîalmost 1 in 4‚Äîwere killed. In 1920, the children of William Flesher donated land beside the Boyne River, close to the site of Flesher's original grist mill, for a Memorial Park. A cenotaph was erected, with the names of those who had died on the front, and those who had survived on the back. In 1917, the first airplane landed in Flesherton, piloted by Alf Witten of Camp Borden. In 1920, the Toronto-Sydenham Road that ran through Flesherton was assumed by the province and became King's Highway 10. Likewise in the 1930s, the Durham Road as far as the centre of Flesherton was assumed by the province as the easternmost extension of King's Highway 4. (In the 1970s, Highway 4 was extended from the centre of Flesherton eastward a further 12 km (5 mi) to the village of Singhampton. However, in 1998, the provincial government under Mike Harris downloaded most of Highway 4 back onto municipal governments, the result being that Highway 4 is now known as Grey Road 4 as it passes through Flesherton.) In 1921, Agnes Macphail, who had been born in nearby Proton Township, was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the Progressive Party of Canada for the Grey Southeast riding in the 1921 federal election. She was the first female MP in Canada. Macphail was re-elected in 1925, 1926, and 1930. In 1925, the United Church of Canada was formed from an amalgamation of the Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational Churches, and the following year, the Methodist church in Flesherton joined with Chalmers Presbyterian to form St. John's United Church. The combined congregations chose to retain the highly visible Methodist building, and sold the much smaller Presbyterian building. Fire continued to be a major threat to the village. In 1926, the original horse barn attached to the Munshaw Hotel burned down. The following year, a fire that started in a grocery store destroyed an entire block of homes and businesses. The dip in the highway south of the village marks the location of the 1931 sinkhole. The dark strip of asphalt the truck is about to cross marks the latest repair as the highway continues to sink.In 1931, during resurfacing of Highway 10, the existence of a large sinkhole just south of the village was revealed when a load of gravel caused a 30-metre (100-ft) section the highway to sink more than 3 metres (10 feet). Although filled in and paved over, this section of the highway continues to slowly sink and requires a new patch of asphalt every few years as the old asphalt is pulled apart. Grey Highlands Secondary SchoolIn 1939, enlistment at the start of the Second World War was again popular with local men; the names of the seven men who did not return were added to the cenotaph following the war. In 1949, a fire and explosion at a gas station destroyed or damaged several businesses. In 1952, the decision was made to expand the 40-year-old high school. However, during construction, a fire started in the older part of the structure, destroying it although sparing the new construction. The new extension continued to serve as the local high school. In 1968, Grey Highlands Secondary School was built in Flesherton to serve a large catchment area formerly covered by three smaller high schools. The placement of this school in Flesherton was considered a controversial decision at the time, since the town of Markdale, 10 km (6 mi) to the north, was larger and was already home to the local school board offices. The arrival of the new high school's teaching and support staff and their families raised the village's population from 480 to 700, the first significant growth in over 80 years. With the new secondary school in place, the former high school was converted to Macphail Memorial Elementary School; this new elementary school in turn replaced all of the one- and two-room schoolhouses in the district, including the 77-year-old Flesherton Public School. This was also the year that Walter Walls, owner of the Dundalk Herald, bought the Flesherton Advance, closed the paper's Flesherton offices after 87 years of operation and moved publication 15 km (11 mi) south to Dundalk. The Advance has been published in Dundalk since that time. Split rail fences near Flesherton.In 1969, yet another major fire in the downtown district destroyed several 19th-century buildings on the southwest corner of the main intersection. In 1974, village councillor Gilbert Little proposed a festival to promote local businesses and draw tourist traffic to the area. The result was the Split Rail Festival, named after the zig-zag fences built by pioneers using cedar rails. The festival was so successful that it became an annual September event that ran until 2008. At the same time, an increased interest in local history led to the construction of the South Grey Museum and Historical Library in a corner of Memorial Park in 1974. In 1998, Flesherton was amalgamated with the Township of Artemesia by the Mike Harris government. (In 2001, Artemesia itself was amalgamated with several other townships to form the municipality of Grey Highlands). The current Macphail Memorial Elementary School replaced an older school of the same name in 2006 Twenty- first century In 2006, the old Macphail Memorial Elementary School (originally Flesherton High School) was torn down and a new school with the same name was constructed close to the same spot. In 2008, the old Flesherton Public School, built in 1891 and unused since 1968, was destroyed by fire. The current community In addition to two schools, Flesherton also has an arena and community centre, post office, several parks, a hiking area known as The Flesherton Hills (100 acres located behind the High School), a swimming pond, the South Grey Museum, a Canadian Legion Hall, a public library, two churches, and a cemetery and crematorium. Businesses include art galleries‚Äîthe area has become home to many artists and musicians‚Äîseveral antiques and collectibles shops, restaurants, a hardware store, real estate offices, several auto sales and service businesses, a funeral home, and a branch of a national bank. Businesses in the area‚Äîincluding those in the villages of Priceville, Ceylon, Eugenia, Kimberley, Maxwell, Rock Mills and Feversham‚Äîare represented by the Flesherton and District Chamber of Commerce, which grew out of the Flesherton Service Club. The Chamber hosts the annual Community Awards since 1997, honouring business and community leaders, and supports the Walking Village Initiative - encouraging residents and visitors to enjoy the area on foot.

Founded in 1963 by Richard Roud and Amos Vogel with the support of Lincoln Center president William Schuman, it is one of the longest-running and most prestigious film festivals in the United States. The non-competitive festival is centered on a ‚ÄúMain Slate‚Äù of typically 20‚Äì30 feature films, with sidebars for experimental cinema and retrospectives, and recently introduced documentary and trans-media sections. Programming is led by a rotating selection committee, chaired by the director of the New York Film Festival, with many committee members remaining from year to year. Separate committees and individuals program the short film, experimental, and trans-media sections. Kent Jones was the festival director from 2013 to 2019. His successor has not been named yet. As of 2018, the main selection committee included Jones (chair); Dennis Lim, FSLC Director of Programming; and Florence Almozini, FSLC Associate Director of Programming.  Sections  As of 2018, the festival program is divided into the following sections: = Main Slate = The Main Slate is the Festival‚Äôs primary section, a program typically featuring 25-30 feature-length films, intending to reflect the current state of cinema. The program is a mix of major international art house films from the festival circuit, new discoveries, and studio releases targeting awards season. The studio films are often selected as Opening Night, Centerpiece, and Closing Night presentations. = Spotlight on Documentary = First distinguished from the general Special Events category as a series of three individually-titled programs in 2013, the non-fiction sidebar has been a single program under the name ‚ÄúSpotlight on Documentary‚Äù since 2014. The section includes 10-15 feature-length films. = Projections = Previously named ‚ÄúViews From the Avant-Garde‚Äù, Projections is the Festival‚Äôs experimental showcase, presenting many programs of short and feature-length work. Initiated in 1997 by co-programmers Mark McElhatten and Gavin Smith, the section was re- titled in 2014 following McElhatten‚Äôs departure. It has since been curated by Dennis Lim and Aily Nash, along with Smith through 2015. = Revivals and Retrospectives = The Revivals section, previously called \\"Masterworks\\", screens new restorations or rereleases of classic films without any unifying theme. Retrospective programs are centered around specific filmmakers. Recent retrospective subjects include Jean-Luc Godard, Nathaniel Dorsky & Jerome Hiller, Bertrand Tavernier, and Robert Mitchum. = Shorts = Several programs of short films, categorized as a sub-section of the Main Slate prior to 2017. = Special events = These screenings are an assortment of special guest appearances, premieres, and documentaries, and include the annual Film Comment Presents selection. = Convergence = Inaugurated in 2012 by co- curators Matt Bolish and Eugene Hernandez, Convergence is the Festival‚Äôs program for interactive and transmedia storytelling.  History  =Founding the Festival and Richard Roud= The NYFF's first programmer, Richard Roud, was recruited by Lincoln Center President William Schuman in 1962. Boston-born Roud was 33 years old at the time and based in London where he worked as a film critic for The Guardian and programmed the London Film Festival. Though Roud maintained his home base in London, he recruited Amos Vogel of the legendary Cinema 16 film club as his New York-based co-programmer. The first edition of the festival opened on September 10, 1963 with Luis Bu√±uel's The Exterminating Angel. In 1966, Roud and Vogel formed the festival's first selection committee, consisting of Arthur Knight and Andrew Sarris; Susan Sontag was added the next year. Vogel resigned from his position as Festival Director in 1968. Though Roud was previously designated Program Director, he presided over the festival from 1969 to 1987. Roud's 25 years at the festival were characterized by a focus on the European art cinema of the postwar years and the rise of auteurism.Smith, Gavin (September/October 2012). \\"Breaking the Waves\\". Film Comment. =The Richard Pe√±a era= Richard Pe√±a, then 34, took over as lead programmer in 1988. The Queens native was already an accomplished film historian, academic, and programmer. Prior to his work with NYFF, he worked at the Film Center of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Pe√±a came to NYFF as a seasoned festival-goer who held Roud in high esteem. During his stint as programmer (which also listed 25 years), Pe√±a honored the festival's traditions and unique character - retaining the selection committee process, the non-competitive format, the post-screening director Q&As;, and the festival's strict selectivity - while also working to expand NYFF's somewhat Eurocentric focus. Filmmakers like Hou Hsiao-hsien, Manoel de Oliveira, Leos Carax, Ra√∫l Ruiz, and Krzystof Kieslowski were introduced to NYFF audiences during the Roud era, and became regulars under Pe√±a. After 25 years as Program Director and head of the NYFF selection committee, Pe√±a led his final year at NYFF in 2012, during the festival's 50th presentation.Smith, Gavin (September/October 2012). \\"Breaking the Waves\\". Film Comment. =NYFF today= After Richard Pe√±a's departure, Robert Koehler briefly took over year-round programming duties, while Kent Jones, who left The Film Society of Lincoln Center in 2009 to serve as Executive Director of the World Cinema Foundation, returned to lead NYFF. Jones began his programming career at Film Forum and the Rotterdam Film Festival, before joining The Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1998 as Associate Director of Programming and a member of the NYFF programming committee.

The mall billed itself as the first enclosed mall in the United States.WGBA newscast, August 9, 2007 Demolition of parts of the shopping center began on August 8, 2007. History Construction on Valley Fair began on July 1, 1953.History at the Castle, \\"Fox Valley History\\" It was located in the town of Menasha, Wisconsin until the land on which it stood was annexed to Appleton. The mall was built by Hamilton Construction Company under the name Hoffman Shopping Centers, Inc. Designed by George Narovec of Appleton, it was one of the first malls in Wisconsin to be enclosed, The mall's grand opening was March 10, 1955. It opened fully on August 11, 1955. The mall originally had six stores: Krambo Supermarkets (renamed Kroger), House of Camera & Cards, Badger Paint & Hardware, Donald's, Hamilton Bakery and Eddie's Self-Service Liquor.Dead Malls dot Com, \\"Dead Malls dot Com features Valley Fair Mall\\", July 27, 2009, retrieved 27 August 2011. The next two years saw further expansion in phases, fronted on the eastern end by a W. T. Grant discount store. With this, the mall was fully completed by 1956. It remained relatively unchanged through 1976, when the Grant's anchor ceased with the rest of the entire chain. In a huge expansion and renovation project in 1978-1979, the mall re-tenanted, with less emphasis on local businesses and more on nationally known tenants. This project included: * An extension of the east wing of the mall, going through the former W.T. Grant store. Space was created for 15-20 new shops, most of them national chains. Included were Brauns, RadioShack, Fanny Farmer, Thom McAn, Walgreens, Woolworth's, and Hallmark Cards. This section fronted a huge Kohl's Department Store/Supermarket combo, one of four built north of Milwaukee.Milwaukee Sentinel June 14, 2002, , Retrieved 25 August 2011.Milwaukee Sentinel 10-28-1972, p. 6, pt. 2, retrieved 25 August 2011. Kohl's Department Store at Valley Fair eventually closed near the end of the 1990s, with new replacement stores opening near Darboy (a suburb in the Southeast corner of Appleton) and another one in Neenah. * A new Marcus 3-screen cineplex was built onto the rear of the mall adjacent to Center Court. In the late 1980s they were divided to create a 6-screen cineplex. * Alterations were done to the older 1950s portion of the mall to blend it into the newer section, including new carpeting laid atop the original concrete flooring, new lighting fixtures and exterior signage.< Through the 1980s and early 1990s, the mall changed ownership several times. Foot traffic started to decrease when Northland Mall on the north side of Appleton completed a major expansion. Another 15 stores in an existing 1960s-era strip were also connected to Kohl's, creating a rare instance of a hybrid strip/enclosed mall. Dartmouth Clothing & Lady Dartmouth (based in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin) opened a store in the Valley Fair Mall during the early 1980s. It eventually closed and re-opened under the name American Clothiers. Another attraction was the addition of Pedro's, at the time one of the first places in northeast Wisconsin to serve authentic Mexican food. Pedro's was eventually purchased by George Wall and the name changed to Sergio's Mexican Bar & Grill. This was followed by Fox River Mall opening in 1984 in Grand Chute, a suburb of Appleton. Tenants started to relocate to both malls as leases came up, though others would stick it out up through the late 1990s. YouthFutures YouthFutures was a non-profit, Christian-oriented organization created in 2002. Buying out the mall, it started to re-tenant a third time, removing all the national chains that were left, and refocusing on local tenants that were more family-oriented in nature. The former Kohl's building was split between an indoor skateboarding park, and a gathering place for teens, where local bands played on weekends. This venture would have created the nation's first functioning \\"youth mall\\" had it taken off, but it was bogged down by the high costs for heating and cooling the nearly 50-year- old structure, and remodeling was far beyond their financial reach. Present Youth Futures sold the mall on March 30, 2006 to \\"VF Partners\\", a partnership between Commercial Horizons, Rollie Winter and Associates, and Bomier, for $2.3 million. \\"VF Partners\\" has been redeveloping the 26-acre, Valley Fair site since 2006. They have demolished most of the property. Because the former Kohl's Food Stores building, the Chase Bank, and the Marcus Cinemas, were still new enough and structurally sound, they weren't torn down. In September 2007, the former Valley Fair site and surrounding blocks were placed into a tax district by the city council to facilitate improvement of the site and the surrounding area.Post-Crescent\\"Copps Food Center may break ground soon at Valley Fair mall site\\", September 30, 2009, retrieved 28 August 2011.

The building was constructed from 1971 to 1976, and serves as the official memorial to President James Madison. It is located between First and Second Streets SE on Independence Avenue, in Washington, DC. History Statue of James Madison (1976), Walker Hancock, sculptor. With the help of former Librarian of Congress Lawrence Quincy Mumford, plans for a third Library of Congress building were started in 1957. Congress appropriated planning funds for the structure in 1960, and construction was approved by an act of Congress on October 19, 1965 that authorized an appropriation of $75 million. The architect was John George Stewart (1890‚Äì1970, Architect of the Capitol. Excavation and foundation work began in June 1971, and work on the superstructure was completed in 1976. The cornerstone, inscribed with the date 1974, was laid on March 8, 1974. Dedication ceremonies were held on April 24, 1980, and the building actually opened on May 28, 1980. It was decided to name the building after Madison largely because he was the person who originally suggested in 1783 that the Continental Congress form a library containing a list of books that would be useful to legislators. The Architect of the Capitol was charged with the responsibility for the construction of the Madison Building under the direction of the Senate and House Building Commissions and the Joint Committee on the Library. The Madison building was originally designed and constructed with the intent to store books, and only after completion did they decide to use the building as office space for Library of Congress officials. These bodies also consulted with a committee appointed by the American Institute of Architects and the James Madison Memorial Commission. The total authorization for construction eventually was increased to $130.675 million. Designed by the firm of DeWitt, Poor, and Shelton Associated Architects, the James Madison Memorial Building is one of the three largest public buildings in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area (along with The Pentagon and the F.B.I.‚Äôs J.

He played professionally for Everton F.C., the New Bedford Whalers and Montreal Carsteel. He also earned eight caps with the English national team.  Biography  =Club career= Born 27 January 1889 in Ellesmere Port, England, Chedgzoy began his professional career with Everton F.C. in 1910, joining the club from amateur side Burnell's Ironworks. He spent sixteen season with the Blues, predominantly was a right wing forward. Everton were runners up in the then top division, Division 1, in the 1911‚Äì12 season; and won the championship 1914‚Äì15. In total, Chedgzoy made 300 appearances (279 in the league) for Everton. He scored thirty-six goals, with thirty-three coming in league games. Chedgzoy also guested for West Ham United during World War One, making 28 appearances and scoring 14 goals.  American Soccer League  In 1926, Chedgzoy emigrated to the United States where he signed with New Bedford Whalers of the American Soccer League.  Canada  Chedgzoy gained his first taste of Canada while vacationing there in 1922. In 1924, he spent the English League off season as manager of the Grenadier Guards, a Canadian armed forces team which competed in the Interprovincial League. When he left the Whalers in 1930, Len Peto, owner of Montreal Carsteel hired Chedgzoy as the team's player-coach in the National Soccer League. In his ten years with the club, he took them to seven league finals, losing the first four before winning the 1936, 1939 and 1940 titles. He made his final appearance as a player for Carsteel in the Canadian Club Final in 1939 at the age of fifty. He remained in Montreal until his death on 7 January 1967. Chedgzoy was inducted into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame in 2005. = National team = Chedgzoy earned his first cap with England in a 2‚Äì1 loss to Wales on 15 March 1920. He went on play a total of eight games with England, his last a 3‚Äì1 victory over Northern Ireland on 22 October 1924.Player Profile  Changing the laws of the game  In 1926, he forced a change in the laws of the game when he almost scored by dribbling the ball in from a corner kick. Contrary to popular belief, he hit the side netting and did not score. Prior to 1924 a goal could only be scored from a corner kick if another player made contact with the ball. In that year, the International Football Association Board (IFAB) changed the laws of football so that a goal could be scored directly from a corner kick (without another player touching the ball). However, the wording of the new law was vague. A Liverpool Echo sports journalist, Ernest Edwards, informed the Everton side of the lack of precision in the new rules. During a game against Woolwich Arsenal, Everton gained a corner kick that Chedgzoy took. Instead of crossing the ball in, he dribbled the ball into the penalty area and nearly scored while the other players and referee looked on in shock ‚Äì and then he successfully persuaded the referee that the rules permitted this way of scoring a goal. After deliberation by the Football Association, it was decided that the goal was legal, and the law was amended making it clear that the player taking the corner could only strike the ball before another player must make contact. This ensures that corner kicks cannot become corner dribbles, but also permits a goal to be scored direct from a corner.  Personal life  His son, Sydney (1911‚Äì1983), was also a footballer who played for various clubs in the 1930s. Chedgzoy served as a private in the Scots Guards during the First World War.

It was built by a private company and was later acquired by the government's Mines Department, and operated from 1876 until 1970. It provided a link from coal mines to the Main South Line, and was never integrated into the network managed by the New Zealand Railways Department, thus although it could be seen as a branch line of the Main South Line, it officially never was.  History  D Class locomotive F Class locomotive =Background= In 1873 local residents petitioned the Provincial Government to construct a Branch Line from the South Island Main Trunk to Ropers Creek near Kaitangata to enable coal to be easily transported from the mines.Proposed Kaitangata Railway, Bruce Herald, Volume VI, Issue 506, 27 June 1873, Page 6 In 1874 the Provincial Government applied for consent to raise a ¬£27,750 loan to construct the Branch line with an extension as far as Coal Point.Proposed Railway Resolutions, Bruce Herald, Volume VII, Issue 600, 26 May 1874, Page 3 This was unsuccessful and as a result the Kaitangata Rail Company began to investigate constructing its own line. Legislation was required to allow the construction of the railway by the Company. Initially this took the form of an ordinance by the Provincial Government, but this was disallowed by the Governor. Wishing to pursue this, the company pressed the General Assembly for consent. The ordinance was redrafted into a Bill and passed as the Kaitangata Railway and Coal Company Empowering Act 1875.Untitled, Bruce Herald, Volume VIII, Issue 728, 24 August 1875, Page 5 The legislation was passed some months after construction had commenced.Opening of the Dunedin and Clutha Railway, Bruce Herald, Volume VIII, Issue 731, 3 September 1875, Page 5 =Construction= On Friday, 26 February 1875 the Kaitangata Rail Company merged with the Kaitangata Coal Company to form the Kaitangata Railway and Coal Company.

Although the station bore much resemblance to buildings on the national network operated by the Railways Department, the line was never part of its network. Trains were initially operated by the Railways Department on behalf of the private owners and the line appeared in working timetables as the Kaitangata Branch, but by the 1880s, this practice had ceased and private operation took over. Passenger services were provided until 1937. Until 1963, an extension ran down a road to the Castle Hill Mine, and for much of its life the line was operated by both a tank engine built to the design of a D class engine (built by Scott Brothers Ltd, of Christchurch) and an \\"Improved F\\" 0-6-0 tank locomotive, constructed in 1896 by Sharp, Stewart & Co. Engines The first engines on the line were Government owned. These were followed in July 1876 by the Company's engine Jerusalem constructed by Davidson and Co of Dunedin.Untitled, Clutha Leader, Volume II, Issue 106, 21 July 1876, Page 5 By September 1877 the Company still only owned one engine.Kaitagata Railway and Coal Company, Bruce Herald, Volume X, Issue 943, 25 September 1877, Page 5 Demise In 1956, the Mines Department took over the branch and in August 1968 introduced a diesel shunter to work the trains, although the F was retained as a spare. By the end of the 1960s, the condition of the line had deteriorated markedly; accordingly, on 30 December 1970 it was closed by the Mines Department. The F was donated to the preservation society at Shantytown, near Greymouth on the West Coast, where it continues to operate and is named \\"Kaitangata\\" after its former home.

In each of these cases, the book of Judges says that the tribes later subjugated the Canaanites into forced labour. According to the Bible, God inflicted the later tribulations in Judges upon the Israelites partially because they failed to completely extinguish the Canaanite race despite his somewhat genocidal command elsewhere to the contrary. According to modern textual criticism the discrepancy with the picture of victory that Joshua portrays is down to the use of different sources. The less pious and more realistic presence of failures leading to the text being considered more historically reliable, and from a potentially earlier, less censured, source. The list does not consider the tribes who became the eastern half of the Kingdom of Israel, but the western part of the Kingdom of Israel are only described as failing, and the only successes are by those tribes which became the Kingdom of Judah. In particular, even where Judah fails, an excuse is given - the occupants had chariots. Hence, many biblical critics see the list as biased, and partly deliberate propaganda, by an author hailing from the Kingdom of Judah. One curious feature of the list is that Jerusalem is described as having not been conquered and containing Jebusites to this day. This is somewhat in contrast to the slightly earlier Judges 1:8, which says that everyone there was killed and the city burnt to the ground. Another unusual feature is that it lists every single tribe whose lands are west of the Jordan, except Levi, the holy tribe, and Issachar, who apparently had no failures, but also no successes worthy of mention. The list =Successes= The Tribe of Judah take: *The southern hill country *Hebron, where Caleb drives out the three sons of Anak The Tribe of Simeon together with that of Judah destroy: *Zepath, which they rename Hormah (which translates as destruction) =Failures= Owing to the occupants having iron chariots, the Tribe of Judah fails to take: *Gaza *Ashkelon *Ekron The Tribe of Benjamin fails to drive out the occupants of: *Jerusalem (also known as Jebus) The Tribe of Manasseh fails to drive out the Canaanites from: *Beit She'an *Taanach *Dor *Ibleam *Megiddo The Tribe of Ephraim is unable to drive out the Canaanites from: *Gezer The Tribe of Zebulun is unable to drive out the Canaanites from: *Kitron *Nahalol The Tribe of Asher is unable to drive out the Canaanites from: *Acco *Siddon *Ahlab *Aczib *Helbah *Aphik *Tel Rehov The Tribe of Naphtali is unable to drive out the Canaanites living in: *Beth Shemesh *Beth Anath The Tribe of Dan was confined to the hill country by the Amorites and could not capture: *Mount Heres *Aijalon *Shaalbim.

The book contains seven loosely related stories set in or related to Hong Kong. They all deal with the tension felt between insiders and outsiders, especially between locals and foreigners visiting for study or work.https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-33789-2 The stories =\\"The Secret of Bats\\"= Alice, a young English student, experiments with echolocation as a means to dealing with her mother's suicide, which attracts her confused and alienated American English teacher. She shares with her teacher a fragmented and strangely eloquent journal about her attempts at echolocation, which becomes a consuming personal project. The story ends on her apartment's rooftop, as Alice and the teacher embrace. Characters: Alice Leung: sixteen-year-old Chinese student who looks 12; tall girl, narrow face, pinched around the mouth, her cheeks pitted with acne scars. She pretends she is a bat, wandering around in a blindfold, trying to gain a bat's sense of orientation. She wants to show her teacher how it works to prove it to him. Unpopular; other girls ignore her and she keeps to herself. She experiments with echolocation as a means to dealing with her mother‚Äôs suicide. Alice‚Äôs mom: committed suicide. The reason Alice wants to act like a bat‚Äîso she can communicate with her mom Narrator: American teacher in Hong Kong. Becomes engulfed in the Chinese lifestyle (on the bus when an old woman gives him money for the New Year he says he has forgotten what America was like). He is a good, genuine person who wants the best for his students (stays after school for Alice‚Äôs experiments). Caring and optimistic (goes to visit Alice at her house when she invites him) =\\"The American Girl\\"= A young woman, a student from Oklahoma, visits a blind masseur regularly in order to pry from him information about his boyhood during the Cultural Revolution. Through the course of the story, what one first assumes is a friendship between the young woman and old man, is in fact a case of cultural misunderstanding, the American believing that telling his traumatic story would be healthy for the old man, and the Chinese man trying to avoid what he perceives as her invasive interrogation. =\\"The Train to Lo Wu\\"= A Hong Kong resident and businessman, Harvey, is drawn to a girl named Lin who lives in Shenzhen but comes from the rural province of Anhui. As they date and eventually become lovers, she expresses her desperate wish to remain on equal footing with him, despite the disparity in their incomes. In the end, Harvey is not able to fully understand her concerns and their relationship is not able to overcome cultural and social obstacles. =\\"For You\\"= An American photographer, Lewis, moves with his wife Melinda when her Boston-based company posts her in Hong Kong. Her new job forces her to work longer hours and offers fewer benefits. Unable to adjust to their new life, he retreats at her urging to a Zen monastery in South Korea. After some time, he finally realizes that in order to save his marriage, he has to tell his wife he cannot handle living in Hong Kong, and risks the possibility of divorce. =\\"The Ferry\\"= An African- American lawyer, Marcel Thomas, must tell another African-American working for his company, who is based in Hong Kong, that he is being fired. As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that while racism is involved, no one party is completely innocent of wrongdoing, as the Hong Kong businessman, Wallace Ford, admits to participating in illegal activities at the behest of the company. In return for Wallace's silence about such actions, he receives a very generous retirement package. Throughout his stay, Marcel must endure attention because of his race, but in the closing scene feels grateful that he is \\"gwai lo\\" in Cantonese, or \\"ghost\\", and in a sense invisible. (note that the correct here should be huckgwei) =\\"Heaven Lake\\"= A Chinese man in Hong Kong is raising his two daughters, twelve and sixteen, after the death of their mother six years before. The distance between them causes him to reflect on his early days in New York City, when he worked as a deliveryman for a Chinese restaurant for very little money while studying at Columbia University on a scholarship. One late night, he received a call for a large order in a dangerous part of the city, and upon delivery was mugged. The mugger is a man desperate for enough money to repay a bookie and escape danger. The young deliveryman ended up letting the mugger face his own danger rather than assisting him, and wonders about the morality of his decision. =\\"Revolutions\\"= An American painter who was thriving in Bangkok, Thailand, breaks a leg and must relocate to Hong Kong. Through his physical therapy at a Zen monastery he comes into contact with Ana, a Polish Buddhist nun. His despair and her compassion draws the two into an intense physical and emotional relationship. As he heals, emotionally and physically, Ana also explores areas that gave her pleasure, like dancing. Once he is well, she leaves him to rejoin the convent, and he continues to paint. Reception Kirkus Reviews called the book \\"an impressive debut from an admirably protean storyteller.\\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jess-row/the-train-to- lo-wu/ It also received positive reviews from Publishers Weekly.https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-33789-2 References Category:2005 short story collections Category:Single-writer short story collections Category:Hong Kong literature ","title":"The Train to Lo Wu"},{"id":"3610850","text":"Dundrennan Range is a weapons testing range on the Solway Firth, near Kirkcudbright in Dumfries and Galloway, in south west Scotland, it is part of the Ministry of Defence's Kirkcudbright Training Area.  History  Previously farming land, the site of was acquired by the British Army in 1942 to train forces for the invasion of mainland Europe. The area includes a sea danger area. The range takes its name from the nearby village of Dundrennan. There is evidence of Bronze Age settlement on the site evidenced by rock art, flint tools and fortified enclosures.  Rail gun & depleted uranium controversy  The range is the site of the Electro-Magnetic Launch Facility where, since 1993, the Ministry of Defence and the United States Army have been collaborating on a research project aimed at developing an electro- magnetic launcher, or railgun, capable of launching shells at and destroying a tank at a distance of . The weapon developed at the site by the Defence Research Agency is considered to be the most successful example of a rail gun developed as it holds a number of records on velocity. In 2001 local people raised concern over the use of depleted uranium shells on the site given health fears which had come to light after service personnel from the Gulf War had fallen sick from such ammunition, however a spokesperson from the British Army claimed the tests were entirely safe. Later that year the Scottish National Party lodged a debate in the House of Commons to call for the immediate suspension of tests on the site, however this was dismissed by the then Secretary of State for Defence Geoff Hoon. In 2003 the renewal of the project was opposed by the then First Minister of Scotland Jack McConnell until a local consultation on the use of the weapon could be carried out, however the site continued to operate. In 2006 concerns were again raised by local MSPs Alasdair Morgan and Chris Ballance regarding the use of depleted uranium shells at the site after calls by a number of international bodies to stop the usage of such armaments given their impact on human health. It is estimated that the site has fired over 6,000 rounds of depleted uranium, amounting to 20 tons, into the Solway Firth. In 2008 the then Scottish Government environment minister Michael Russell criticised the continued tests on site of depleted uranium despite previous moves to stop the live testing. In 2013, following European Union legislation to protect the marine environment campaigners urged the cessation of use of live shells into the sea, however notes from a Ministry of Defence meeting reveal that the legislation would not impact on the site as the shells were 'placed' not 'dumped' into the sea - a response campaigners concluded was a loophole. Later in 2013 the local MP Russell Brown said that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) had assured him that there were no plans to resume testing of such weapons on the site. In 2019 renewed testing at the site resulted in the closure of access, installation of fencing and removal of tenant farmers and their livestock. This caused opposition amongst local residents who claimed there had been no consultation, with the MoD saying the site could be closed for up to five years.  Current use  The site is used today as a field of fire and as a training site for infantry both with live and blank ammunition. The site is not open to public access during testing, except tenant farmers, as there is a danger of unexploded ordnance on the site. Given the lack of public access the Ministry of Defence report a number of rare plants in the botany of the range including glaucium flavum, yellow vetch and anacamptis pyramidalis. Limited public access is maintained on a number on specific paths and roads through the site when live testing is not being undertaken. In March 2018, the Ministry of Defence indicated that it was at the very early stages of plans to develop and enhance the training facilities at Dundrennan.

It was first brewed in 1885 by the National Brewing Company, but was eventually purchased by Pabst Brewing Company. Nearly 90 percent of National Bohemian sales are in Baltimore. The beer is currently brewed under contract at the Molson Coors brewing facilities in Albany, GA. and Trenton, OH.; and is also owned by Pabst Brewing Company. History For a time, National's president Jerold Hoffberger also owned the Baltimore Orioles; Natty Boh was served at Memorial Stadium and became the \\"official\\" beer of Baltimore in the late 1960s. The \\"Land of Pleasant Living\\" slogan reached its peak during the mid-late 1960s when National acquired a Chesapeake Bay skipjack (local sailing vessel) and named it the \\"Chesterpeake\\" after a pelican who appeared in their ads. The Chesterpeake traveled throughout the Maryland portion of the Chesapeake Bay visiting various local festivals, regattas, yacht clubs, etc. and was also seen in television commercials. After a 1975 merger with Canadian brewer Carling, the Baltimore brewery located at the intersection of O'Donnell and Conkling streets was closed in 1978 and production moved to the company's facility in nearby Halethorpe. Carling-National was itself bought out by the G. Heileman Brewing Company in 1979. Heileman added Tuborg to the list of beers brewed in Halethorpe. In 1996, G. Heileman was sold to the Stroh Brewery Company, which in turn, was bought by the Pabst Brewing Company. Brewing stopped at the Halethorpe facility by 2000. The facility was sold to a local interest. The Halethorpe brewing facility was demolished by 2006, while the original Baltimore brewing facility was redeveloped as the Brewers Hill complex by Obrecht Commercial Real Estate, Inc. In May 2010, Pabst Brewing was sold to C. Dean Metropoulos, a private investor, for $250 million. For over 15 years, the famous Baltimore beer was not available on draft, only bottles and cans, but in February 2011, local taverns in the Baltimore area celebrated the ability to serve National Bohemian from a keg. National Bohemian draft also became available at Oriole Park at Camden Yards for the home season opener in 2011. Marketing The company's mascot, the one-eyed, handlebar-mustachioed Mr. Boh, has been a recognizable icon since his introduction in 1936 by company president Arthur Deute. In an era when National Boh's main competition was another local brew Gunther Beer, whose slogan was \\"Gunther's got it\\". A popular joke asked \\"What happened to Mr. Boh's other eye?\\" to which the answer was given: \\"Gunther's got it.\\" According to Dawson Farber, who was promoted to Vice-President of marketing in 1950, he has \\"no idea why he only has one eye.\\" Farber confesses. \\"I don't think anybody does.\\" It is hinted that it could be so because Mr. Boh's head is supposed to be viewed from the side. The image was debuted in 1936, and through Farber's modern redesign it became a \\"potent brewery icon\\". By the end of National‚Äôs 1960s to mid-1970s run as one of Baltimore‚Äôs most prominent corporate ‚Äúcitizens,‚Äù Mr. Boh‚Äôs image largely gave way to the ‚ÄúNational Bohemian‚Äù name itself against a rectangular background which dipped in the middle to form a ‚ÄúV.‚Äù Indeed some of Boh‚Äôs popularity began to wane in 1967 when the brewer temporarily shifted its advertising slogan from ‚ÄúThe Land of Pleasant Living‚Äù to ‚ÄúEvery Man Should Have a Beer He Can Call His Own.‚Äù The mascot's image is licensed for a Maryland Lottery scratch off; by Smyth Jewelers; and was the official team mascot of the Baltimore Bohemians professional soccer team. A Mr. Boh neon sign currently sits atop the former site of the National Brewery building in the Brewer's Hill neighborhood of Baltimore and is clearly visible from I-95 just north of the Fort McHenry Tunnel. Mr. Boh still appears on all cans, bottles, and packaging; and merchandise featuring him can still easily be found in shops in Maryland, including several in Fells Point. The National line also included \\"National Bohemian Dark\\" and \\"National Premium\\", available in can, bottle, and draft versions. Both brands were discontinued following G. Heileman's sale to Stroh's in 1996; however, National Premium rights were purchased and the recipe re-bottled and distributed starting in 2012 by a couple located on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. National Bohemian also produces an ice beer called \\"Boh Ice\\" having an alcohol content of 5.8%. Mr. Boh has become an icon to the city of Baltimore. Entire stores are dedicated to products to featuring the character in Fells Point, Canton, and other locations. The citizens of Baltimore have fought to make Mr. Boh an unofficial spokesman for the city. Caps Puzzles National Bohemian added Cap Puzzles, a series of pictograms, or rebus that create a common phrase, in 1944. The bottles with Cap Puzzles were used by United States spies to aid the allies in World War II. After the conclusion of the war Cap Puzzles remained and are now a staple of the product. Community support and sponsorship From the 1950s through the demise of the National Brewing Company in 1978, the brewery was involved in many athletic sponsorships. Early involvements included bowling and golf tournaments held in the Baltimore metro area. During the 1950s and 1960s, National Beer sponsored the PGA Eastern Open Invitational held at the Mt Pleasant Golf Course in Baltimore. Beginning in the late 1960s, National Beer began sponsoring the National Beer Brewers softball team, composed primarily of Baltimore Clippers hockey players. From 1968 to 1985, the brewery sponsored the National Brewers ice hockey team in the Chesapeake Hockey League. Though the brand lost a great deal of local market share in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s (due mainly to the overwhelming media blitz of Anheuser-Busch) there has been a resurgence of interest in \\"Natty Boh\\" in recent years, particularly among younger beer drinkers.

Its negative result refuted some specific aether drag models, and confirmed special relativity. Overview Experiments such as the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment of 1887 (and later other experiments such as the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment in 1903 or the Trouton‚ÄìRankine experiment in 1908), presented evidence against the theory of a medium for light propagation known as the luminiferous aether; a theory that had been an established part of science for nearly one hundred years at the time. These results cast doubts on what was then a very central assumption of modern science, and later led to the development of special relativity. In an attempt to explain the results of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment in the context of the assumed medium, aether, many new hypotheses were examined. One of the proposals was that instead of passing through a static and unmoving aether, massive objects at the Earth's surface may drag some of the aether along with them, making it impossible to detect a \\"wind\\". Oliver Lodge (1893‚Äì1897) was one of the first to perform a test of this theory by using rotating and massive lead blocks in an experiment that attempted to cause an asymmetrical aether wind. His tests yielded no appreciable results differing from previous tests for the aether wind. In the 1920s, Dayton Miller conducted repetitions of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiments, which allegedly gave a positive result. However, several experiments conducted afterwards by others gave negative results. Miller claimed that this is due to entrainment of the aether, because the other experiments used heavily enclosed equipment. To test Miller's assertion, Hammar conducted the following experiment using a common- path interferometer in 1935. The experiment center Using a half-silvered mirror A, he divided a ray of white light into two half-rays. One half-ray was sent in the transverse direction into a heavy walled steel pipe terminated with lead plugs. In this pipe, the ray was reflected by mirror D and sent into the longitudinal direction to another mirror C at the other end of the pipe. There it was reflected and sent in the transverse direction to a mirror B outside of the pipe. From B it traveled back to A in the longitudinal direction. The other half-ray traversed the same path in the opposite direction. The topology of the light path was that of a Sagnac interferometer with an odd number of reflections. Sagnac interferometers offer excellent contrast and fringe stability, and the configuration with an odd number of reflections is only slightly less stable than the configuration with an even number of reflections. (With an odd number of reflections, the oppositely traveling beams are laterally inverted with respect to each other over most of the light path, so that the topology deviates slightly from strict common path.) The relative immunity of his apparatus to vibration, mechanical stress and temperature effects, allowed Hammar to detect fringe displacements as little as 1/10 of a fringe, despite using the interferometer outdoors in an open environment with no temperature control. Similar to Lodge's experiment, Hammar's apparatus should have caused an asymmetry in any proposed aether wind. Hammar's expectation of the results was that: With the apparatus aligned perpendicular to the aether wind, both long arms would be equally affected by aether entrainment. With the apparatus aligned parallel to the aether wind, one arm would be more affected by aether entrainment than the other. The following expected propagation times for the counter-propagating rays were given by Robertson/Noonan: :t_{1}=\\\\frac{AB}{c+v}+\\\\frac{BC+DA}{\\\\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}}+\\\\frac{CD}{c-v+\\\\Delta v} :t_{2}=\\\\frac{AB}{c-v}+\\\\frac{BC+DA}{\\\\sqrt{c^{2}-v^{2}}}+\\\\frac{CD}{c+v-\\\\Delta v} where \\\\Delta v is the velocity of the entrained aether. This gives an expected time difference: :\\\\Delta t\\\\simeq\\\\frac{2l\\\\Delta v}{c^{2}} On September 1, 1934, Hammar set up the apparatus on top of a high hill two miles south of Moscow, Idaho, and made many observations with the apparatus turned in all directions of the azimuth during the daylight hours of September 1, 2, and 3. He saw no shift of the interference fringes, corresponding to an upper limit of \\\\Delta v<0.074 km/s. These results are considered a proof against the aether drag hypothesis as it was proposed by Miller. Consequences for Aether drag hypothesis Because differing ideas of \\"aether drag\\" existed, the interpretation of all aether drag experiments can be done in the context of each version of the hypothesis. # None or partial entrainment by any object with mass. This was discussed by scientists such as Augustin-Jean Fresnel and Fran√ßois Arago. It was refuted by the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. # Complete entrainment within or in the vicinity of all masses. It was refuted by the Aberration of light, Sagnac effect, Oliver Lodge's experiments, and Hammar's experiment. # Complete entrainment within or in the vicinity of only very large masses such as Earth. It was refuted by the Aberration of light, Michelson‚ÄìGale‚ÄìPearson experiment.

It was released in 2005 in Japan and in September 2006 elsewhere. The story follows Kazuma Kiryu, a yakuza member who spent ten years in jail for a crime he did not commit. After being released, he learns that the criminal underworld is searching for 10 billion yen that has been stolen from the Tojo clan. He comes across an orphan named Haruka who is being targeted by the clan. She is believed to have the key to their lost money and Kiryu resolves to protect her. The game takes place in Kamurocho, a realistic recreation of Tokyo's Kabukicho district. Yakuza takes place in an open world and makes use of role-playing elements. The player gains experience from combat which is used to improve Kiryu's fighting capabilities. In order to finance the game's expensive production, Sega contracted a tie-in campaign with famous Japanese companies. A remake of the game, Yakuza Kiwami, was released for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 in 2016. The critical reception was mostly positive. Although some criticized its clunky mechanics, the game was received well for its presentation and story. Yakuza was a commercial success, having sold over 1 million units. It went on to spawn an entire franchise of games. Gameplay alt= Yakuza is a third-person open world action-adventure game where the player controls Kazuma Kiryu in the city of Kamurocho. The game also incorporates role-playing elements. With the experience gained from combat, the player can level up Kiryu's attributes and increase his fighting capabilities in order to perform Heat actions which greatly damage his enemies. Yakuza utilizes quick time events during the fights. While Kamurocho's map shows the linear path to continue the main story, the player may take on missions and side quests found around the city. The game is composed of three interconnected modes called Event, Adventure and Battle. In Encounter Battles, the player randomly encounters foes. Winning these battle nets some cash, which can be used to purchase equipment or healing items. Items can be bought in shops based on real life stores and are divided into multiple real companies. The Battle Mode includes the Underground Arena which is located in Kamurocho's Purgatory area. Cutscenes are enabled after completing specific actions or beating a certain character during the Adventure Mode. They also introduce the chapter's objectives. Various minigames are available within 'Adventure Mode' in the form of arcade machines scattered throughout the game world. These include a claw crane, a batting cage, a casino (baccarat, blackjack and roulette), toba and pachislot. Plot The game follows the story of Kazuma Kiryu (Darryl Kurylo/Takaya Kuroda), a yakuza whose life changes when his boss, Sohei Dojima, attempts to rape Kiryu's childhood friend, Yumi Sawamura (Eliza Dushku/Miyako Uesaka)). When Dojima is murdered by Kiryu's best friend and fellow yakuza, Akira Nishikiyama (Michael Rosenbaum/Kazuhiro Nakaya), Kiryu accepts blame for the murder, and is imprisoned for ten years. During his incarceration, Kiryu is expelled from his organization, the Tojo Clan, and Yumi goes missing. After his release, he learns that ten billion yen has been stolen from the Tojo Clan's private bank, and that the entire Japanese underworld is now searching for the lost wealth. Kiryu asks his former captain and adopted father, Shintaro Kazama (Roger L. Jackson/Tetsuya Watari), about Yumi's disappearance, but Nishikiyama, who now controls his own gang, shoots Kazama after he reveals that Yumi was connected to the lost money. Kiryu manages to escape from the Tojo, who now regard him as an enemy and put a contract out on his life. His escape is aided by a detective named Makoto Date (Bill Farmer/Kazuhiro Yamaji), who had been investigating Kiryu ever since the death of Dojima, and is now investigating the murder of Third Chairman Masaru Sera (Alan Dale/Ryuji Mizuki), the former Tojo Clan leader whose death has triggered a war between Kazama, Nishikiyama, and an ambitious yakuza boss, Futoshi Shimano (Michael Madsen/Naomi Kusumi). In his search for Yumi, Kiryu finds an orphan named Haruka Sawamura (Debi Derryberry/Rie Kugimiya) who is searching for her mother, Mizuki, who Date identifies as Yumi's younger sister. Haruka is also targeted by the yakuza, who believe that her pendant, which Yumi gave to her for safekeeping, is the key to the missing ten billion. Kazuma is forced to protect her from not just Shimano and Nishikiyama, but also Goro Majima (Mark Hamill/Hidenari Ugaki), Shimano's sadistic lieutenant, as well as the Omi Alliance, a rival yakuza organization, the Snake Flower Triad, led by Kiryu's old enemy Lau Ka Long (James Horan/Shinichi Takizawa), and the MIA, a mysterious group with ties to the Japanese government. Eventually, Kiryu learns from Kazama that Haruka is actually Yumi's daughter, and that \\"Mizuki\\" is Yumi under an assumed identity. Yumi suffered amnesia after she was attacked by Dojima, but recovered and married Kyohei Jingu (Robin Atkin Downes/Hiroaki Yoshida), an ambitious politician who allied himself with Sera. After accidentally killing a journalist who had tried to blackmail him with evidence that he had abandoned his family, Jingu asked Sera to have them murdered. Kazama saved Yumi and persuaded Sera to turn on Jingu, having learned that the latter was using the clan to launder the ten billion for his own purposes. Shimano ambushes them but Kiryu defeats him; however, Shimano mortally wounds Kazama with a grenade and his ally, Omi Alliance lieutenant Yukio Terada (Gregg Berger/Kenji Nomura), then shoots him dead in revenge. Before dying, Kazama confesses to Kiryu that he killed his parents when he was young and that he in fact operated the Sunflower Orphanage Kiryu grew up in. Armed with the knowledge of the money's location, Kiryu and Haruka head to Millennium Tower, where they meet Yumi, who has recovered her memories and now intends to destroy the money with a bomb. Jingu arrives with the MIA and the Omi Alliance, revealing that he intends to destroy the Tojo Clan and ally himself with the Alliance to control Japan. Kiryu subdues him and his men, but Nishikiyama arrives to challenge Kiryu and take the money for himself. Kiryu defeats him. Jingu appears and shoots Yumi before Nishikiyama stabs him and detonates the bomb by shooting at it, killing them both and destroying the entire floor in the process. Yumi then dies in Kiryu's arms, and with her, Nishiki and Kazama now dead, Kiryu decides to return to prison, but Date talks him out of it by reminding him that he is the only one who can take care of Haruka now. The Tojo Clan asks Kiryu to assume the role of Fourth Chairman in accordance with Sera's will, to which Kiryu complies but he retires instead mere hours later and names Terada as the new Chairman to rebuild the clan. The story ends with Kiryu beginning a new life as a civilian with Haruka as his newly-adopted daughter. Development Koma Theater, is a main landmark in the game. TV ads are displayed in-game and can be viewed in full screen. The game was first hinted at in August 2005 as \\"Project J.\\" Later that month, details were announced. Producer Toshihiro Nagoshi explained \\"For a while now, I've wanted to create a powerful, gritty drama where you feel the sense of humanity,\\" Nagoshi explained. \\"After a lot of thought, this is the product that we've arrived at.\\" The budget of the game was 2.4 billion yen (approx. $21 million). Nagoshi chose the focus on yakuzas due to the amount of violence the subject tends to incorporate. This was also done in order to attract more gamers with this theme, believing there were less gamers during the time the game was made. Most of the team members are from different backgrounds, such as developers that have their roots in the arcade with titles such as Virtua Fighter 3 and Super Monkey Ball, as well as team members having experience in novel console titles like Panzer Dragoon and Jet Set Radio. The team members all felt that they went against their careers considering that the new game didn't match anything they had previously done. Nagoshi felt that this was an advantage, making them all play on even playing field. Anything that was done had to go through Nagoshi first, since only he had a concrete idea of how the game is going to end up. During development, the team researched hostess clubs, which are prominently featured in the story, even attending hostess clubs themselves, including Roppongi and Kabukicho. The fictional setting of Kamurocho in the game was closely based on the red-light district of Kabukicho in Tokyo. The development team wanted to accurately portray yakuza, especially such as their obsession with jingi, their code of honor. Originally the game had scenes where pinky fingers were cut off, a traditional punishment, but these scenes were removed so that CERO would give Yakuza a favorable rating. Though using the gameplay schematics of one of Nagoshi's earlier titles, Spikeout, as basis for the combat, Yakuza utilized an entirely new engine crafted for the game. =Writing= The game's development team was divided into two groups: one writing the main plot and the other writing the subplots. Novelist Hase Seishu was the lead writer of the central plot. Seishu was brought on board two years before the game development started. Seishu had been a gamer since the days of Space Invaders, but over the past four or five years, he had lost interest, as he was less concerned with 3D visuals and gameplay than he was with story. Yakuza caught his attention, and he decided to accept the project even though it came at the busiest point of his professional writing career. Nagoshi wanted players to get enjoyment from merely walking through Kamurocho. Nagoshi reveals that the game's title, which translates to \\"Like a Dragon,\\" was his creation; Nagoshi felt that dragons have a strong image, which would evoke Kazuma's strength and manliness. Although Sega did have a plot in mind when they approached Seishu, they hoped that he could add realism and emotional weight to the scenes. Under Seishu's direction, the ages of Makoto Date and Kazuma Kiryu were modified. Writing the subplots did not prove challenging, as there was not a strict pattern to follow. The team wanted all subplots to keep the feeling from the main storyline. Several ideas did not make it into the game because the staff members found them silly. One subplot that made the final cut, which involves a man who tried to commit suicide when he was rejected by a girl, was nearly removed from this game for this reason. =Localization= In localizing the game, Sega funded an aggressive web and print advertising campaign, as well as an English voice cast composed almost entirely of cult performers like Michael Madsen, Eliza Dushku and Mark Hamill. Localization producer Kevin Frane recalls \\"When we released the original Yakuza, we knew that the game had been a hit in Japan, and we wanted to make sure that we put our best foot forward in releasing a new and unique product to the Western market that would draw just as much acclaim.\\" However, technical limitations of the format made it impossible for the team to include both audio tracks on the disc. Scott A. Steinberg at Sega of America commented \\"in bringing the game to the U.S. market, we wanted to ensure that the subtle nuances of the game were brought to life.\\" English voice actor Darryl Kurylo said that he wanted to sound as good as possible after being impressed by the characterization of Kiryu and the lines he had to give. However, he regrets some lines were lost in translation of the original game. Nevertheless, Kurylo enjoyed the experience to the point of playing the game multiple times alongside his son. In order to fit the lipsyncing from the original Japanese game, Kurylo often had to say a line in different styles. Kurylo still found more fun when doing the yells for the fight scenes. There were also problems with promoting Yakuza before its English release. Frane added that the first trailer for the game \\"was constructed using an old scratch track [an unfinished soundtrack]. This made the rounds fairly quickly across gaming fan sites, highlighting what was considered poor quality, but this trailer actually wasn't at all representative of the voice quality of the finished product. The damage had already been done, though, for the most part, and so a lot of fans probably still don't realize that.\\" =Soundtrack= The Ry≈´ ga Gotoku & Ry≈´ ga Gotoku 2 Original Sound Track (HCV-287) dual-disc boxset was published by Wave Master in Japan on January 25, 2007. The music was composed by Hidenori Shoji, Sachio Ogawa, Keitaro Hanada, Fumio Ito, Yuri Fukuda. The closing theme is John Newton's rendition of Amazing Grace, a classic hymn sung in English by Eri Kawai; additional performers are Makotch (vocals), Yuri (chorus) and Tomica (chorus). Marketing In order to both support the game's expensive production, including making Kamurocho a realistic recreation of Tokyo's Kabukicho, Sega contracted a tie-in campaign with famous Japanese companies. As a result, some in-game locations, such as the Don Quijote discount store and the Club Sega game centers are modeled after the real life buildings. Sega also used product placement, and introduced ads within the game. This includes a collaboration with the Japanese Suntory group which advertises in-game with ad banners, Boss Coffee ads and vending machines are also visible in Kamurocho; cans are purchasable within Kamurocho stores. Since the group produces local drinks and is a distributor of foreign alcohols, all brands appearing in Kamurocho's bars and pubs, being Whiskey, Jack Daniel's Bourbon or Carlsberg Beer, are real brands of Suntory. In promoting the game, Sega hired Takashi Miike. A member from the team had previously worked with Toei Company on V-cinema. Sega approached many companies to try to secure product placement, like car companies and fashion companies. But because of the mature nature of the Yakuza game, they were rejected by most of them. The whiskey distributor Suntory accepted, however, since they felt the game's demographic meshed nicely with the whiskey-drinking demographic. Other product placements include Shogakukan's Sabra magazine, Fujisankei Communications Group's SPA! magazine and Panini Group's World Club Cup stickers. The latter appears in a TV ad, together with a Suntory drink and a Sega mahjong game, which is displayed in the Kamurocho theater wall screen. Sega's UFO Catcher crane game machines are included as a minigame, and arcade cabinets of Virtua Fighter 4 and SpikeOut can be seen in the Club Sega game centers. =Editions= As part of the pre-ordering campaign, the Japanese first edition was bundled with two limited items, a Tojo Clan lapel pin replica (ÁâπË£Ω„Éî„É≥„Éê„ÉÉ„Ç∏, tokusei pin baju, lit. \\"deluxe pin badge\\") and a monography called Kamutai Magazine (December 2005 issue). The original PlayStation 2 the Best edition (SLPM-74234) included a bonus DVD with the trailer of Yakuza 2, while the reprint (SLPM-74253) which was released during the production of the spin-off was repackaged with a rose cover art instead of white (a.k.a. „É™„Éë„ÉÉ„Ç±„Éº„Ç∏Áâà, ripakkeji han lit. \\"repackage edition\\") and a bonus DVD with the trailer of Ryu Ga Gotoku Kenzan!, a voice cast message and a 20-minute producer interview. There were no special editions of the game released outside Japan, but Sega Europe and America did use online marketing. A flash game, \\"CodeYakuza.com\\", was created and an English subtitled version of the game's 2006 live-action adaption directed by Takashi Miike, Like a Dragon: Prologue, was freely downloadable on the game's official website. On November 1, 2012, a PlayStation 3 HD remaster of the Japanese original version of Yakuza and Yakuza 2 titled was released in Japan.Èæç„ÅåÂ¶Ç„Åè1ÔºÜ2 HD EDITION PlayStation¬Æ3 the Best, PlayStation official website - Japan This \\"HD edition\\" features both game remasters bundled in a single Blu-ray disc and later as a downloadable title on the Japanese PlayStation Store.

Reception The game was heavily acclaimed in Japan for combining innovative gameplay with cinema-like story telling and character development on the back of Japan's criminal underground. Yakuza received generally positive reviews among Western critics earning a 75 out of 100 in Metacritic. IGN praised its combat system and sense of style but criticized its tedious gameplay. Newtype USA called it \\"the adult-themed spiritual successor to the Dreamcast's Shenmue series\\" and found that the fighting system would interest many players. GamePro similarly compared it with Shenmue based on the amount of subscenarios. 1UP.com saw the potential of the fighting as it often earned the player money which can be used to buy items in the city. GameRevolution criticized the number of random encounters which resulted in a large amount of loading times. He also criticized the simplicity of the fighting system and few notable issues with GameTrailers agreeing on the difficulty in centering on an enemy. The amount of sidequests available received generally favorable response. The game has been praised for the design of the city and delivery of the English voice acting. GameRevolution also praised it as \\"From an audio/video standpoint, Yakuza is exceptionally well-produced. Although the cut-scenes are all use the in-game engine, the complicated facial expressions are shockingly intricate and colorful, while some of the floral tattoos look too good to be true.\\" UGO Networks praised the seriousness of the story as the game \\"respects and appreciates yakuza culture and its often forgotten roots in the samurai tradition/bushido code\\" and thus lamented the lack of the Japanese audio. GameTrailers also wished for a Japanese audio option, despite noting the English dub did a fine job. GameZone called it an \\"epic story that will keep you exploring the world filled with criminals and Kazuma's only friends who will help him along the way.\\" Eurogamer also commented on the narrative praising the contrast between Kiryu's kindness and Nishikiyama's brooding. The game sold 232,650 units in Japan during 2005. In 2006 it shipped 345,323 units. Due to its commercial success on the Japanese market, Yakuza had a PlayStation 2 the Best edition on October 26, 2006, and an exceptional reprint on December 6, 2007. In contrast, this Asian long seller title never had a Platinum or Greatest Hits re-release on the western markets. Total sales reached 1 million. =Legacy= According to Toshihiro Nagoshi \\"[Ryu ga Gotoku was successful] because there were only a few titles which directly portray original Japanese culture. Also, there is no other title which attempts to represent such a Japanese world view with a big budget title.\\" The game was also recognized for excellence in the 2007 Japan Game Awards. A sequel, titled Yakuza 2, was released in Japan on December 7, 2006,Sega promising an improved fighting system and further exploration. Nagoshi commented on some of his goals with Yakuza 2 being providing a deeper dramatic storyline over what was found in the original, the game also has some themes that were not in the original, including an adult love story. A remake of Yakuza, titled Yakuza: Kiwami, was released on January 21, 2016 in Japan for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. Kiwami improved the resolution, framerate, textures and loading times compared to the original game, and additional content was added to resolve some of the more confusing plot points and establish connections to the prequel title Yakuza 0. Live-action adaptations In 2006, Takeshi Miyasaka directed a prequel Like a Dragon: Prologue (Èæç„ÅåÂ¶Ç„Åè „ÄúÂ∫èÁ´†„Äú, ryu ga gotoku -joshou-) with mixed martial artist and puroresu wrestler Masakatsu Funaki as Kazuma Kiryu. A film adaptation Like a Dragon (Èæç„ÅåÂ¶Ç„Åè ÂäáÂ†¥Áâà, ryu ga gotoku: gekijoban) was directed by Takashi Miike in 2007. Kazuma Kiryu's role is played by actor Kazuki Kitamura, known outside of Japan for his roles in Shohei Imamura's The Eel, Takeshi Miike's Dead or Alive and Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill.LIKE A DRAGON (Japan, 2007) In September 2020, it was reported that Sega was developing a live-action adaptation for the video game with 1212 Entertainment and Wild Sheep Content. Erik Barmack, Roberto Grande and Joshua Long are set to produce the film.

Throughout their history, the Byzantine Greeks self-identified as Romans (), but are referred to as \\"Byzantine Greeks\\" in modern historiography. Latin speakers identified them simply as Greeks or with the term Romei. The social structure of the Byzantine Greeks was primarily supported by a rural, agrarian base that consisted of the peasantry, and a small fraction of the poor. These peasants lived within three kinds of settlements: the chorion or village, the agridion or hamlet, and the proasteion or estate. Many civil disturbances that occurred during the time of the Byzantine Empire were attributed to political factions within the Empire rather than to this large popular base. Soldiers among the Byzantine Greeks were at first conscripted amongst the rural peasants and trained on an annual basis. As the Byzantine Empire entered the 11th century, more of the soldiers within the army were either professional men-at-arms or mercenaries. Until the thirteenth century, education within the Byzantine Greek population was more advanced than in the West, particularly at primary school level, resulting in comparatively high literacy rates. Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants, who enjoyed a very strong position in international trade. Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants, they held their own throughout the latter half of the Byzantine Empire's existence. The clergy also held a special place, not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts, but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered the equivalent of the pope. This position of strength had built up over time, for at the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Constantine the Great (), only a small part, about 10%, of the population was Christian. Use of the Greek language was already widespread in the eastern parts of the Roman empire when Constantine moved its capital to Constantinople, although Latin was the language of the imperial administration. From the reign of Emperor Heraclius (), Greek was the predominant language amongst the populace and also replaced Latin in administration. At first, the Byzantine Empire had a multi-ethnic character, but following the loss of the non-Greek speaking provinces with the 7th century Muslim conquests it came to be dominated by the Byzantine Greeks, who inhabited the heartland of the later empire: modern Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, and Sicily, and portions of southern Bulgaria, Crimea, and Albania. Over time, the relationship between them and the West, particularly with Latin Europe, deteriorated. Relations were further damaged by a schism between the Catholic West and Orthodox East that led to the Byzantine Greeks being labeled as heretics in the West. Throughout the later centuries of the Byzantine Empire and particularly following the imperial coronation of the King of the Franks, Charlemagne (), in Rome in 800, the Byzantines were not considered by Western Europeans as heirs of the Roman Empire, but rather as part of an Eastern Greek kingdom. As the Byzantine Empire declined, the Byzantines and their lands came under foreign domination, mostly Ottoman rule. The designation \\"R√ªm\\" (\\"Roman\\") for the Greek-speaking Orthodox subjects of the Ottomans and \\"Rum millet\\" (\\"Roman nation\\") for all the Eastern Orthodox populations was kept both by Ottoman Greeks and their Ottoman overlords: \\"On the part of the Ottoman conquerors, already from the early years of the conquest, the word Rum meant at the same time their subjects of the Christian Orthodox faith and also those speaking Greek, as distinct from the neighbouring Albanians or Vlachs. \\" and lived on until the 20th century. Terminology The double-headed eagle, emblem of the Palaiologos dynasty. During most of the Middle Ages, the Byzantine Greeks self-identified as Rh≈çma√Æoi (, \\"Romans\\", meaning citizens of the Roman Empire), a term which in the Greek language had become synonymous with Christian Greeks.: \\"Roman, Greek (if not used in its sense of 'pagan') and Christian became synonymous terms, counterposed to 'foreigner', 'barbarian', 'infidel'. The citizens of the Empire, now predominantly of Greek ethnicity and language, were often called simply œå œáœÅŒπœÉœÑœéŒΩœÖŒºŒøœÇ ŒªŒ±œåœÇ ['the people who bear Christ's name'].\\". The Latinizing term Graiko√≠ (ŒìœÅŒ±ŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ, \\"Greeks\\") was also used,Paul the Silentiary. Descriptio S. Sophiae et Ambonis, 425, Line 12 (\\"œá·ø∂œÅŒøœÇ ·ΩÖŒ¥Œµ ŒìœÅŒ±ŒπŒ∫Œø·øñœÉŒπ\\"); Theodore the Studite. Epistulae, 419, Line 30 (\\"·ºêŒΩ ŒìœÅŒ±ŒπŒ∫Œø·øñœÇ\\"). though its use was less common, and nonexistent in official Byzantine political correspondence, prior to the Fourth Crusade of 1204.; ; . While this Latin term for the ancient Hellenes could be used neutrally, its use by Westerners from the 9th century onwards in order to challenge Byzantine claims to ancient Roman heritage rendered it a derogatory exonym for the Byzantines who barely used it, mostly in contexts relating to the West, such as texts relating to the Council of Florence, to present the Western viewpoint. The ancient name Hellenes was synonymous to \\"pagan\\" in popular use, but was revived as an ethnonym in the Middle Byzantine period (11th century).. While in the West the term \\"Roman\\" acquired a new meaning in connection with the Catholic Church and the Bishop of Rome, the Greek form \\"Romaioi\\" remained attached to the Greeks of the Eastern Roman Empire.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2009), \\"History of Europe: The Romans\\". The term \\"Byzantine Greeks\\" is an exonym applied by later historians like Hieronymus Wolf; \\"Byzantine\\" citizens continued to call themselves Romaioi (Romans) in their language.. Despite the shift in terminology in the West, the Byzantines Empire's eastern neighbors, such as the Arabs, continued to refer to the Byzantines as \\"Romans\\", as for instance in the 30th Surah of the Quran (Ar-Rum). The signifier \\"Roman\\" (Rum millet, \\"Roman nation\\") was also used by the Byzantines' later Ottoman rivals, and its Turkish equivalent R√ªm, \\"Roman\\", continues to be used officially by the government of Turkey to denote the Greek Orthodox natives (Rumlar) of Istanbul, as well as the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (, \\"Roman Orthodox Patriarchate\\"In Turkey, it is also referred to unofficially as Fener Rum Patrikhanesi, \\"Roman Patriarchate of the Phanar\\".). Among Slavic populations of southeast Europe, such as Bulgarians and Serbs the name \\"Rhomaioi\\" (Romans) in their languages was most commonly translated as \\"Greki\\" (Greeks). Some Slavonic texts during the early medieval era also used the terms Rimljani or Romei.Nikolov, A. Empire of the Romans or Tsardom of the Greeks? The Image of Byzantium in the Earliest Slavonic Translations from Greek. ‚Äì Byzantinoslavica, 65 (2007), 31-39. In medieval Bulgarian sources the Byzantine Emperors were the \\"Tsars of the Greeks\\" and the Byzantine Empire was known as \\"Tsardom of the Greeks\\". Both rulers of the Despotate of Epirus and the Empire of Nicaea were also \\"Greek tsars ruling over Greek people\\". Equally, among the Nordic people such as the Icelanders, Varangians (Vikings) and other Scandinavian people, the \\"Rhomaioi\\" (Romans) were called \\"Grikkr\\" (Greeks). There are various runic inscriptions left in Norway, Sweden and even in Athens by travellers and members of the Varangian Guard like the Greece runestones and the Piraeus Lion which we meet the terms Grikkland (Greece) and Grikkr referring to their ventures in Byzantine Empire and their interaction with the Byzantines.Jakobsson, Sverrir. (2016). The Varangian Legend. Testimony from the Old Norse sources. pp. 346-361 Society While social mobility was not unknown in Byzantium the order of society was thought of as more enduring, with the average man regarding the court of Heaven to be the archetype of the imperial court in Constantinople.. This society included various classes of people that were neither exclusive nor immutable. The most characteristic were the poor, the peasants, the soldiers, the teachers, entrepreneurs, and clergy. =The poor= According to a text dated to AD 533, a man was termed \\"poor\\" if he did not have 50 gold coins (aurei), which was a modest though not negligible sum.. The Byzantines were heirs to the Greek concepts of charity for the sake of the polis; nevertheless it was the Christian concepts attested in the Bible that animated their giving habits,. and specifically the examples of Basil of Caesarea (who is the Greek equivalent of Santa Claus), Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom. The number of the poor fluctuated in the many centuries of Byzantium's existence, but they provided a constant supply of muscle power for the building projects and rural work. Their numbers apparently increased in the late fourth and early fifth centuries as barbarian raids and a desire to avoid taxation pushed rural populations into cities.. Since Homeric times, there were several categories of poverty: the ptochos (, \\"passive poor\\") was lower than the penes (, \\"active poor\\").. They formed the majority of the infamous Constantinopolitan mob whose function was similar to the mob of the First Rome. However, while there are instances of riots attributed to the poor, the majority of civil disturbances were specifically attributable to the various factions of the Hippodrome like the Greens and Blues.. The poor made up a non-negligible percentage of the population, but they influenced the Christian society of Byzantium to create a large network of hospitals (iatreia, ) and almshouses, and a religious and social model largely justified by the existence of the poor and born out of the Christian transformation of classical society.. =Peasantry= There are no reliable figures as to the numbers of the peasantry, yet it is widely assumed that the vast majority of Byzantine Greeks lived in rural and agrarian areas.. In the Taktika of Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912), the two professions defined as the backbone of the state are the peasantry (ge≈çrgikƒì, , \\"farmers\\") and the soldiers (strati≈çtikƒì, ). The reason for this was that besides producing most of the Empire's food the peasants also produced most of its taxes. Peasants lived mostly in villages, whose name changed slowly from the classical kome () to the modern chorio ().. While agriculture and herding were the dominant occupations of villagers they were not the only ones. There are records for the small town of Lampsakos, situated on the eastern shore of the Hellespont, which out of 173 households classifies 113 as peasant and 60 as urban, which indicate other kinds of ancillary activities. The Treatise on Taxation, preserved in the Biblioteca Marciana in Venice, distinguishes between three types of rural settlements, the chorion (Greek: œáœâœÅŒØŒøŒΩ) or village, the agridion (Greek: Œ±Œ≥œÅŒØŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ) or hamlet, and the proasteion (Greek: œÄœÅŒøŒ¨œÉœÑŒµŒπŒøŒΩ) or estate. According to a 14th-century survey of the village of Aphetos, donated to the monastery of Chilandar, the average size of a landholding is only 3.5 modioi (0.08 ha).. Taxes placed on rural populations included the kapnikon (Greek: Œ∫Œ±œÄŒΩŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ) or hearth tax, the synone (Greek: œÉœÖŒΩŒøŒΩŒÆ) or cash payment frequently affiliated with the kapnikon, the ennomion (Greek: ŒµŒΩŒΩœåŒºŒπŒøŒΩ) or pasture tax, and the aerikon (Greek: Œ±Œ≠œÅŒπŒ∫ŒøŒΩ, meaning \\"of the air\\") which depended on the village's population and ranged between 4 and 20 gold coins annually.; . Their diet consisted of mainly grains and beans and in fishing communities fish was usually substituted for meat.. Bread, wine, and olives were important staples of Byzantine diet with soldiers on campaign eating double-baked and dried bread called paximadion (Greek: œÄŒ±ŒæŒπŒºŒ¨Œ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ).. As in antiquity and modern times, the most common cultivations in the choraphia (Greek: œáœâœÅŒ¨œÜŒπŒ±) were olive groves and vineyards. While Liutprand of Cremona, a visitor from Italy, found Greek wine irritating as it was often flavoured with resin (retsina) most other Westerners admired Greek wines, Cretan in particular being famous.. While both hunting and fishing were common, the peasants mostly hunted to protect their herds and crops.. Apiculture, the keeping of bees, was as highly developed in Byzantium as it had been in Ancient Greece.. Aside from agriculture, the peasants also laboured in the crafts, fiscal inventories mentioning smiths (Greek: œáŒ±ŒªŒ∫ŒµœçœÇ, chalkeus), tailors (Greek: œÅŒ¨œÄœÑŒ∑œÇ, rhaptes), and cobblers (Greek: œÑŒ∂Œ±Œ≥Œ≥Œ¨œÅŒπŒøœÇ, tzangarios). =Soldiers= Joshua portrayed as a soldier wearing the lamellar klivanion cuirass and a straight spathion sword (Hosios Loukas). During the Byzantine millennium, hardly a year passed without a military campaign. Soldiers were a normal part of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies.. While it is difficult to draw a distinction between Roman and Byzantine soldiers from an organizational aspect, it is easier to do so in terms of their social profile. The military handbooks known as the Taktika continued a Hellenistic and Roman tradition, and contain a wealth of information about the appearance, customs, habits, and life of the soldiers.. As with the peasantry, many soldiers performed ancillary activities, like medics and technicians.. Selection for military duty was annual with yearly call-ups and great stock was placed on military exercises, during the winter months, which formed a large part of a soldier's life.. Until the 11th century, the majority of the conscripts were from rural areas, while the conscription of craftsmen and merchants is still an open question.. From then on, professional recruiting replaced conscription, and the increasing use of mercenaries in the army was ruinous for the treasury. From the 10th century onwards, there were laws connecting land ownership and military service. While the state never allotted land for obligatory service, soldiers could and did use their pay to buy landed estates, and taxes would be decreased or waived in some cases.. What the state did allocate to soldiers, however, from the 12th century onwards, were the tax revenues from some estates called pronoiai (). As in antiquity, the basic food of the soldier remained the dried biscuit bread, though its name had changed from boukelaton () to paximadion. =Teachers= A page of 5th or 6th century Iliad like the one a grammarian might possess. Byzantine education was the product of an ancient Greek educational tradition that stretched back to the 5th century BC.. It comprised a tripartite system of education that, taking shape during the Hellenistic era, was maintained, with inevitable changes, up until the fall of Constantinople. The stages of education were the elementary school, where pupils ranged from six to ten years, secondary school, where pupils ranged from ten to sixteen, and higher education. Elementary education was widely available throughout most of the Byzantine Empire's existence, in towns and occasionally in the countryside. This, in turn, ensured that literacy was much more widespread than in Western Europe, at least until the twelfth century. Secondary education was confined to the larger cities while higher education was the exclusive provenance of Constantinople. Though not a society of mass literacy like modern societies, Byzantine society was a profoundly literate one.. Based on information from an extensive array of Byzantine documents from different periods (i.e. homilies, Ecloga, etc.), Robert Browning concluded that, while books were luxury items and functional literacy (reading and writing) was widespread, but largely confined to cities and monasteries, access to elementary education was provided in most cities for much of the time and sometimes in villages.; . Nikolaos Oikonomides, focusing on 13th- century Byzantine literacy in Western Asia Minor, states that Byzantine society had \\"a completely literate church, an almost completely literate aristocracy, some literate horsemen, rare literate peasants and almost completely illiterate women.\\". Ioannis Stouraitis estimates that the percentage of the Empire's population with some degree of literacy was at most 15‚Äì20% based primarily on the mention of illiterate Byzantine tourmarchai in the Tactica of Emperor Leo VI the Wise (r. 886‚Äì912).. In Byzantium, the elementary school teacher occupied a low social position and taught mainly from simple fairy tale books (Aesop's Fables were often used).. However, the grammarian and rhetorician, teachers responsible for the following two phases of education, were more respected. These used classical Greek texts like Homer's Iliad or Odyssey and much of their time was taken with detailed word- for-word explication. Books were rare and very expensive and likely only possessed by teachers who dictated passages to students.. =Women= Scenes of marriage and family life in Constantinople. Women have tended to be overlooked in Byzantine studies as Byzantine society left few records about them.. Women were disadvantaged in some aspects of their legal status and in their access to education, and limited in their freedom of movement.. The life of a Byzantine Greek woman could be divided into three phases: girlhood, motherhood, and widowhood.. Childhood was brief and perilous, even more so for girls than boys. Parents would celebrate the birth of a boy twice as much and there is some evidence of female infanticide (i.e. roadside abandonment and suffocation), though it was contrary to both civil and canon law. Educational opportunities for girls were few: they did not attend regular schools but were taught in groups at home by tutors.. With few exceptions, education was limited to literacy and the Bible; a famous exception is the princess Anna Komnene (1083‚Äì1153), whose Alexiad displays a great depth of erudition, and the renowned 9th century Byzantine poet and composer Kassiani.. The majority of a young girl's daily life would be spent in household and agrarian chores, preparing herself for marriage. For most girls, childhood came to an end with the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage.. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life.. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there is evidence of contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.. Due to prevailing norms of modesty, women would wear clothing that covered the whole of their body except their hands.. While women among the poor sometimes wore sleeveless tunics, most women were obliged to cover even their hair with the long maphorion () veil. Women of means, however, spared no expense in adorning their clothes with exquisite jewelry and fine silk fabrics. Divorces were hard to obtain even though there were laws permitting them.. Husbands would often beat their wives, though the reverse was not unknown, as in Theodore Prodromos's description of a battered husband in the Ptochoprodromos poems. Although female life expectancy in Byzantium was lower than that of men, due to death in childbirth, wars and the fact that men married younger, female widowhood was still fairly common. Still, some women were able to circumvent societal strictures and work as traders, artisans, abbots, entertainers, and scholars.. =Entrepreneurs= Gold solidus of Justinian II , struck after 692.. The traditional image of Byzantine Greek merchants as unenterprising benefactors of state aid is beginning to change for that of mobile, pro-active agents.. The merchant class, particularly that of Constantinople, became a force of its own that could, at times, even threaten the Emperor as it did in the eleventh and twelfth centuries.. This was achieved through efficient use of credit and other monetary innovations. Merchants invested surplus funds in financial products called chreokoinonia (), the equivalent and perhaps ancestor of the later Italian commenda. Eventually, the purchasing power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far afield as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, that is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite.. This had an end by the end of the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more. Following that phase, however, the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout during the time of the Third Crusade.. The reason Byzantine Greek merchants have often been neglected in historiography is not that they were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade. It rather originated with the way history was written in Byzantium, which was often under the patronage of their competitors, the court, and land aristocracy. The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime violence of the Italians. =Clergy= Unlike in Western Europe where priests were clearly demarcated from the laymen, the clergy of the Eastern Roman Empire remained in close contact with the rest of society.. Readers and subdeacons were drawn from the laity and expected to be at least twenty years of age while priests and bishops had to be at least 30. Unlike the Latin church, the Byzantine church allowed married priests and deacons, as long as they were married before ordination. Bishops, however, were required to be unmarried. While the religious hierarchy mirrored the Empire's administrative divisions, the clergy were more ubiquitous than the emperor's servants.. The issue of caesaropapism, while usually associated with the Byzantine Empire, is now understood to be an oversimplification of actual conditions in the Empire. By the fifth century, the Patriarch of Constantinople was recognized as first among equals of the four eastern Patriarchs and as of equal status with the Pope in Rome. The ecclesiastical provinces were called eparchies and were headed by archbishops or metropolitans who supervised their subordinate bishops or episkopoi. For most people, however, it was their parish priest or papas (from the Greek word for \\"father\\") that was the most recognizable face of the clergy. Culture =Language= Uncial script, from a 4th-century Septuagint manuscript. The Eastern Roman Empire was in language and civilization a Greek society.. Linguistically, Byzantine or medieval Greek is situated between the Hellenistic (Koine) and modern phases of the language.. Since as early as the Hellenistic era, Greek had been the lingua franca of the educated elites of the Eastern Mediterranean, spoken natively in the southern Balkans, the Greek islands, Asia Minor, and the ancient and Hellenistic Greek colonies of Southern Italy, the Black Sea, Western Asia and North Africa.. At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium, the koine (Greek: Œ∫ŒøŒπŒΩŒÆ) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings, while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators.. As Christianity became the dominant religion, Attic began to be used in Christian writings in addition to and often interspersed with koine Greek. Nonetheless, from the 6th at least until the 12th century, Attic remained entrenched in the educational system; while further changes to the spoken language can be postulated for the early and middle Byzantine periods. The population of the Byzantine Empire, at least in its early stages, had a variety of mother tongues including Greek. These included Latin, Aramaic, Coptic, and Caucasian languages, while Cyril Mango also cites evidence for bilingualism in the south and southeast.. These influences, as well as an influx of people of Arabic, Celtic, Germanic, Turkic, and Slavic backgrounds, supplied medieval Greek with many loanwords that have survived in the modern Greek language. From the 11th century onward, there was also a steady rise in the literary use of the vernacular. Following the Fourth Crusade, there was increased contact with the West; and the lingua franca of commerce became Italian. In the areas of the Crusader kingdoms a classical education (Greek: œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ±, paideia) ceased to be a sine qua non of social status, leading to the rise of the vernacular. From this era many beautiful works in the vernacular, often written by people deeply steeped in classical education, are attested. A famous example is the four Ptochoprodromic poems attributed to Theodoros Prodromos. From the 13th to the 15th centuries, the last centuries of the Empire, there arose several works, including laments, fables, romances, and chronicles, written outside Constantinople, which until then had been the seat of most literature, in an idiom termed by scholars as \\"Byzantine Koine\\". However, the diglossia of the Greek-speaking world, which had already started in ancient Greece, continued under Ottoman rule and persisted in the modern Greek state until 1976, although Koine Greek remains the official language of the Greek Orthodox Church. As shown in the poems of Ptochoprodromos, an early stage of modern Greek had already been shaped by the 12th century and possibly earlier. Vernacular Greek continued to be known as \\"Romaic\\" (\\"Roman\\") until the 20th century.. =Religion= King David in the imperial purple (Paris Psalter). At the time of Constantine the Great (r. 306‚Äì337), barely 10% of the Roman Empire's population were Christians, with most of them being urban population and generally found in the eastern part of the Roman Empire. The majority of people still honoured the old gods in the public Roman way of religio.. As Christianity became a complete philosophical system, whose theory and apologetics were heavily indebted to the Classic word, this changed.. In addition, Constantine, as Pontifex Maximus, was responsible for the correct cultus or veneratio of the deity which was in accordance with former Roman practice.. The move from the old religion to the new entailed some elements of continuity as well as break with the past, though the artistic heritage of paganism was literally broken by Christian zeal.. Christianity led to the development of a few phenomena characteristic of Byzantium. Namely, the intimate connection between Church and State, a legacy of Roman cultus. Also, the creation of a Christian philosophy that guided Byzantine Greeks in their everyday lives. And finally, the dichotomy between the Christian ideals of the Bible and classical Greek paideia which could not be left out, however, since so much of Christian scholarship and philosophy depended on it. These shaped Byzantine Greek character and the perceptions of themselves and others. Christians at the time of Constantine's conversion made up only 10% of the population. This would rise to 50% by the end of the fourth century and 90% by the end of the fifth century. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) then brutally mopped up the rest of the pagans, highly literate academics on one end of the scale and illiterate peasants on the other. A conversion so rapid seems to have been rather the result of expediency than of conviction. The survival of the Empire in the East assured an active role of the emperor in the affairs of the Church. The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative and financial routine of organising religious affairs, and this routine was applied to the Christian Church. Following the pattern set by Eusebius of Caesarea, the Byzantines viewed the emperor as a representative or messenger of Christ, responsible particularly for the propagation of Christianity among pagans, and for the \\"externals\\" of the religion, such as administration and finances. The imperial role in the affairs of the Church never developed into a fixed, legally defined system, however.. With the decline of Rome, and internal dissension in the other Eastern patriarchates, the church of Constantinople became, between the 6th and 11th centuries, the richest and most influential centre of Christendom.. Even when the Byzantine Empire was reduced to only a shadow of its former self, the Church, as an institution, exercised so much influence both inside and outside the imperial frontiers as never before. As George Ostrogorsky points out:. > \\"The Patriarchate of Constantinople remained the center of the Orthodox > world, with subordinate metropolitan sees and archbishoprics in the > territory of Asia Minor and the Balkans, now lost to Byzantium, as well as > in Caucasus, Russia and Lithuania. The Church remained the most stable > element in the Byzantine Empire.\\" In terms of religion, Byzantine Greek Macedonia is also significant as being the home of Saints Cyril and Methodius, two Greek brothers from Thessaloniki (Salonika) who were sent on state-sponsored missions to proselytize among the Slavs of the Balkans and east-central Europe. This involved Cyril and Methodius having to translate the Christian Bible into the Slavs' own language, for which they invented an alphabet that became known as Old Church Slavonic. In the process, this cemented the Greek brothers' status as the pioneers of Slavic literature and those who first introduced Byzantine civilization and Orthodox Christianity to the hitherto illiterate and pagan Slavs. Identity =Self-perception= 11th century Hagia Sophia mosaic. On the left, Constantine IX \\"faithful in Christ the God, Emperor of the Romans\\". In modern Byzantine scholarship, there are currently three main schools of thought on medieval eastern Roman identity. * First, a school of thought that developed largely under the influence of modern Greek nationalism, treats Roman identity as the medieval form of a perennial Greek national identity. In this view, as heirs to the ancient Greeks and of the Roman state, the Byzantines thought of themselves as Rhomaioi, or Romans, though they knew that they were ethnically Greeks.For statements of this view, see, for example, or : \\"As heirs to the Greeks and Romans of old, the Byzantines thought of themselves as Rhomaioi, or Romans, though they knew full well that they were ethnically Greeks.\\" (see also: ). * Second, which could be regarded as preponderant in the field considers \\"Romanity\\" the mode of self-identification of the subjects of a multi-ethnic empire at least up to the 12th century, where the average subject identified as Roman. * Third, a line of thought argues that the eastern Roman identity was a separate pre-modern national identity. The main lines of thinking in the research on medieval Eastern Roman iden-tity could be roughly summarized as follows: The first, extensively influenced by the retrospective Modern Greek national discourse, approaches this identity as the medieval form of the perennial Greek national identity. The second, which could be regarded as preponderant within the field, albeit by no means monolithically concordant in its various utterances, speaks of a multi-ethnic im-perial state at least up to the twelfth century, the average subject of which identified as Roman. The third, and more recent, approach dismissed the supposition of a multi-ethnic empire and suggested that Byzantium should be regarded as a pre-modern Nation-State in which Romanness had the traits of national identity. The established consensus in the field of Byzantine studies does not call into question the self-identification of the \\"Byzantines\\" as Romans.. : \\"the Byzantine were Romans who happened to speak Greek and not Greeks who happened to call themselves Romans\\". The defining traits of being considered one of the Rhomaioi were being an Orthodox Christian and more importantly speaking Greek, characteristics which had to be acquired by birth if one was not to be considered an allogenes or even a barbarian. The term mostly used to describe someone who was a foreigner to both the Byzantines and their state was ethnik√≥s (Greek: ), a term which originally described non-Jews or non-Christians, but had lost its religious meaning.. In a classicizing vein usually applied to other peoples, Byzantine authors regularly referred to their people as \\"Ausones\\", an ancient name for the original inhabitants of Italy.: \\"Just as the Byzantines referred to foreign peoples by classical names, making the Goths into Skythians and the Arabs into Medes, so too did they regularly call themselves Ausones, an ancient name for the original inhabitants of Italy. This was the standard classicizing name that the Byzantines used for themselves, not 'Hellenes.'\\" Most historians agree that the defining features of their civilization were: 1) Greek language, culture, literature, and science, 2) Roman law and tradition, 3) Christian faith.; ; ; . The Byzantine Greeks were, and perceived themselves as, heirs to the culture of ancient Greece,; ; : \\"All through the Middle Ages the Byzantines considered themselves the guardians and heirs of the Hellenic tradition.\\" the political heirs of imperial Rome,; ; .: \\"The Byzantines did not call themselves Byzantines, but Romaioi‚ÄîRomans. They were well aware of their role as heirs of the Roman Empire, which for many centuries had united under a single government the whole Mediterranean world and much that was outside it.\\" and followers of the Apostles. Thus, their sense of \\"Romanity\\" was different from that of their contemporaries in the West. \\"Romaic\\" was the name of the vulgar Greek language, as opposed to \\"Hellenic\\" which was its literary or doctrinal form.. Being a Roman was mostly a matter of culture and religion rather than speaking Greek or living within Byzantine territory, and had nothing to do with race. Some Byzantines began to use the name Greek (Hellen) with its ancient meaning of someone living in the territory of Greece rather than its usually Christian meaning of \\"pagan\\". Realizing that the restored empire held lands of ancient Greeks and had a population largely descended from them, some scholars such as George Gemistos Plethon and John Argyropoulos... put emphasized pagan Greek and Christian Roman past, mostly during a time of Byzantine political decline. However such views were part of a few learned people, and the majority of Byzantine Christians would see them as nonsensical or dangerous. After 1204 the Byzantine successor entities were mostly Greek-speaking but not nation-states like France and England of that time. The risk or reality of foreign rule, not some sort of Greek national consciousness was the primary element that drew contemporary Byzantines together. Byzantine elites and common people nurtured a high self-esteem based on their perceived cultural superiority towards foreigners, whom they viewed with contempt, despite the frequent occurrence of compliments to an individual foreigner as an andre√Æos Rh≈çmai√≥phr≈çn (, roughly \\"a brave Roman-minded fellow\\"). There was always an element of indifference or neglect of everything non-Greek, which was therefore \\"barbarian\\".. =Official discourse= In official discourse, \\"all inhabitants of the empire were subjects of the emperor, and therefore Romans.\\" Thus the primary definition of Rh≈çmaios was \\"political or statist.\\". In order to succeed in being a full- blown and unquestioned \\"Roman\\" it was best to be a Greek Orthodox Christian and a Greek-speaker, at least in one's public persona. Yet, the cultural uniformity which the Byzantine church and the state pursued through Orthodoxy and the Greek language was not sufficient to erase distinct identities, nor did it aim to. =Regional identity= Often one's local (geographic) identity could outweigh one's identity as a Rh≈çmaios. The terms x√©nos (Greek: ) and ex≈çtik√≥s (Greek: ) denoted \\"people foreign to the local population,\\" regardless of whether they were from abroad or from elsewhere within the Byzantine Empire. \\"When a person was away from home he was a stranger and was often treated with suspicion. A monk from western Asia Minor who joined a monastery in Pontus was 'disparaged and mistreated by everyone as a stranger'. The corollary to regional solidarity was regional hostility.\\". =Revival of Hellenism= From an evolutionary standpoint, Byzantium was a multi-ethnic empire that emerged as a Christian empire, soon comprised the Hellenised empire of the East, and ended its thousand-year history, in 1453, as a Greek Orthodox state: an empire that became a nation, almost by the modern meaning of the word.. The presence of a distinctive and historically rich literary culture was also very important in the division between \\"Greek\\" East and \\"Latin\\" West and thus the formation of both.. It was a multi-ethnic empire where the Hellenic element was predominant, especially in the later period. Spoken language and state, the markers of identity that were to become a fundamental tenet of nineteenth-century nationalism throughout Europe became, by accident, a reality during a formative period of medieval Greek history.. After the Empire lost non-Greek speaking territories in the 7th and 8th centuries, \\"Greek\\" (·ºùŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩ), when not used to signify \\"pagan\\", became synonymous with \\"Roman\\" () and \\"Christian\\" (ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ±ŒΩœåœÇ) to mean a Christian Greek citizen of the Eastern Roman Empire. In the context of increasing Venetian and Genoese power in the eastern Mediterranean, association with Hellenism took deeper root among the Byzantine elite, on account of a desire to distinguish themselves from the Latin West and to lay legitimate claims to Greek-speaking lands.. From the 12th century onwards, Byzantine Roman writers started to disassociate themselves from the Empire's pre-Constantinian Latin past, regarding henceforth the transfer of the Roman capital to Constantinople by Constantine as their founding moment and reappraised the normative value of the pagan Hellenes, even though the latter were still viewed as a group distinct from the Byzantines. The first time the term \\"Hellene\\" was used to mean \\"Byzantine\\" in official correspondence was in a letter to Emperor Manuel I Komnenus (1118-1180). Beginning in the twelfth century and especially after 1204, certain Byzantine Greek intellectuals began to use the ancient Greek ethnonym H√©llƒìn (Greek: ) in order to describe Byzantine civilisation.. After the fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204, a small circle of the elite of the Empire of Nicaea used the term Hellene as a term of self- identification.: \\"The new usage of 'Hellene' was limited to a small circle of scholars at the Nicaean court and emphasized the cultural identity of the Byzantines as the heirs of the 'Ancient Hellenes'\\". : \\"it is important to appreciate that this was a limited phenomenon. The examples of self- identifying Hellenism are actually quite few and do not extend beyond the absolute elite of Nikaia, where the terminology of Rhomaios also maintained its hold\\". For example, in a letter to Pope Gregory IX, the Nicaean emperor John III Doukas Vatatzes (r. 1221‚Äì1254) claimed to have received the gift of royalty from Constantine the Great, and put emphasis on his \\"Hellenic\\" descent, exalting the wisdom of the Greek people. He was presenting Hellenic culture as an integral part of the Byzantine polity in defiance of Latin claims. Emperor Theodore II Laskaris (r. 1254-1258), the only one during this period to systematically employ the term Hellene as a term of self- identification, tried to revive Hellenic tradition by fostering the study of philosophy, for in his opinion there was a danger that philosophy \\"might abandon the Greeks and seek refuge among the Latins\\"... For historians of the court of Nikaia, however, such as George Akropolites and George Pachymeres, Rhomaios remained the only significant term of self-identification, despite traces of influence of the policy of the Emperors of Nikaia in their writings.. During the Palaiologan dynasty, after the Byzantines recaptured Constantinople, Rhomaioi became again dominant as a term for self-description and there are few traces of Hellene, such as in the writings of George Gemistos Plethon; the neo-platonic philosopher boasted \\"We are Hellenes by race and culture,\\" and proposed a reborn Byzantine Empire following a utopian Hellenic system of government centered in Mystras. Under the influence of Plethon, John Argyropoulos, addressed Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425‚Äì1448) as \\"Sun King of Hellas\\" and urged the last Byzantine emperor, Constantine XI Palaiologos (r. 1449‚Äì1453), to proclaim himself \\"King of the Hellenes\\". These largely rhetorical expressions of Hellenic identity were confined in a very small circle and had no impact on the people. They were however continued by Byzantine intellectuals who participated in the Italian Renaissance. =Western perception= The Entry of the Crusaders into Constantinople, by Eug√®ne Delacroix, 1840. In the eyes of the West, after the coronation of Charlemagne, the Byzantines were not acknowledged as the inheritors of the Roman Empire. Byzantium was rather perceived to be a corrupted continuation of ancient Greece, and was often derided as the \\"Empire of the Greeks\\" or \\"Kingdom of Greece\\". Such denials of Byzantium's Roman heritage and ecumenical rights would instigate the first resentments between Greeks and \\"Latins\\" (for the Latin liturgical rite) or \\"Franks\\" (for Charlemegne's ethnicity), as they were called by the Greeks.: \\"The Frankish court no longer regarded the Byzantine Empire as holding valid claims of universality; instead it was now termed the 'Empire of the Greeks'.\\" Popular Western opinion is reflected in the Translatio militiae, whose anonymous Latin author states that the Greeks had lost their courage and their learning, and therefore did not join in the war against the infidels. In another passage, the ancient Greeks are praised for their military skill and their learning, by which means the author draws a contrast with contemporary Byzantine Greeks, who were generally viewed as a non-warlike and schismatic people. While this reputation seems strange to modern eyes given the unceasing military operations of the Byzantines and their eight century struggle against Islam and Islamic states, it reflects the realpolitik sophistication of the Byzantines, who employed diplomacy and trade as well as armed force in foreign policy, and the high-level of their culture in contrast to the zeal of the Crusaders and the ignorance and superstition of the medieval West. As historian Steven Runciman has put it:. ::\\"Ever since our rough crusading forefathers first saw Constantinople and met, to their contemptuous disgust, a society where everyone read and wrote, ate food with forks and preferred diplomacy to war, it has been fashionable to pass the Byzantines by with scorn and to use their name as synonymous with decadence\\". A turning point in how both sides viewed each other is probably the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182. The massacre followed the deposition of Maria of Antioch, a Norman-Frankish (therefore \\"Latin\\") princess who was ruling as regent to her infant son Emperor Alexios II Komnenos. Maria was deeply unpopular due to the heavy-handed favoritism that had been shown the Italian merchants during the regency and popular celebrations of her downfall by the citizenry of Constantinople quickly turned to rioting and massacre. The event and the horrific reports of survivors inflamed religious tensions in the West, leading to the retaliatory sacking of Thessalonica, the empire's second largest city, by William II of Sicily. An example of Western opinion at the time is the writings of William of Tyre, who described the \\"Greek nation\\" as \\"a brood of vipers, like a serpent in the bosom or a mouse in the wardrobe evilly requite their guests\\". =Eastern perception= In the East, the Persians and Arabs continued to regard the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Greeks as \\"Romans\\" (Arabic: ar-R≈´m) after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, for instance, the 30th surah of the Quran (Ar-Rum) refers to the defeat of the Byzantines (\\"Rum\\" or \\"Romans\\") under Heraclius by the Persians at the Battle of Antioch (613), and promises an eventual Byzantine (\\"Roman\\") victory.. This traditional designation of the Byzantines as [Eastern] Romans in the Muslim world continued through the Middle Ages, leading to names such as the Sultanate of Rum (\\"Sultanate over the Romans\\") in conquered Anatolia and personal names such as Rumi, the mystical Persian poet who lived in formerly Byzantine Konya in the 1200s. Late medieval Arab geographers still saw the Byzantines as Rum (Romans) not as Greeks, for instance Ibn Battuta saw the, then collapsing, Rum as \\"pale continuators and successors of the ancient Greeks (Yunani) in matters of culture.\\". The Muslim Ottomans also referred to their Byzantine Greek rivals as R√ªm, \\"Romans\\", and that term is still in official use in Turkey for the Greek-speaking natives (Rumlar) of Istanbul cf. Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople (, \\"Roman Orthodox Patriarchate\\"In Turkey it is also referred to unofficially as Fener Rum Patrikhanesi, \\"Roman Patriarchate of the Phanar\\".). Many place-names in Anatolia derive from this Turkish word (R√ªm, \\"Romans\\") for the Byzantines: Erzurum (\\"Arzan of the Romans\\"), Rumelia (\\"Land of the Romans\\"), and Rumiye-i Suƒüra (\\"Little Rome\\", the region of Amasya and Sivas).. Post-Byzantine history Distribution of dialects descended from Byzantine Greek in 1923. Demotic in yellow. Pontic in orange. Cappadocian in green, with green dots indicating individual Cappadocian Greek speaking villages in 1910.Dawkins, R.M. 1916. Modern Greek in Asia Minor. A study of dialect of Silly, Cappadocia and Pharasa. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Byzantine Greeks, forming the majority of the Byzantine Empire proper at the height of its power, gradually came under the dominance of foreign powers with the decline of the Empire during the Middle Ages. Those who came under Arab Muslim rule, either fled their former lands or submitted to the new Muslim rulers, receiving the status of Dhimmi. Over the centuries these surviving Christian societies of former Byzantine Greeks in Arab realms evolved into Antiochian Greeks, Melchites or merged into the societies of Arab Christians, existing to this day. The majority of Byzantine Greeks lived in Asia Minor, the southern Balkans, and Aegean islands. Nearly all of these Byzantine Greeks fell under Turkish Muslim rule by the 16th century. Many retained their identities, eventually comprising the modern Greek and Cypriot states, as well as the Cappadocian Greek and Pontic Greek minorities of the new Turkish state. These latter groups, the legacy Byzantine groups of Anatolia, were forced to emigrate from Turkey to Greece in 1923 by the Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. Other Byzantine Greeks, particularly in Anatolia, converted to Islam and underwent Turkification over time.. Other than the Western term \\"Graikoi\\" (\\"Greeks\\"), which was not in common use, but used as a term of self-designation up to the 19th century by scholars and small numbers of people related to the West, the modern Greek people still use the Byzantine term \\"Romaioi,\\" or \\"Romioi,\\" (\\"Romans\\") to refer to themselves, as well as the term \\"Romaic\\" (\\"Roman\\") to refer to their Modern Greek language.; ; . Many Greek Orthodox populations, particularly those outside the newly independent modern Greek state, continued to refer to themselves as Romioi (i.e. Romans, Byzantines) well into the 20th century. Peter Charanis, who was born on the island of Lemnos in 1908 and later became a professor of Byzantine history at Rutgers University, recounts that when the island was taken from the Ottomans by Greece in 1912, Greek soldiers were sent to each village and stationed themselves in the public squares. Some of the island children ran to see what Greek soldiers looked like. ‚Äò‚ÄòWhat are you looking at?‚Äô‚Äô one of the soldiers asked. ‚Äò‚ÄòAt Hellenes,‚Äô‚Äô the children replied. ‚Äò‚ÄòAre you not Hellenes yourselves?‚Äô‚Äô the soldier retorted. ‚Äò‚ÄòNo, we are Romans,‚Äô‚Äô the children replied..

Her ministry style was a model for Pentecostalism. Life Woodworth-Etter was born in New Lisbon, Columbiana County, Ohio, as Mariah Beulah Underwood. She was born again at the beginning of the Third Great Awakening at the age of thirteen. Maria immediately heard the call of God and dedicated her life to the Lord. Of her calling she would later write, \\"I heard the voice of Jesus calling me to go out in the highways and hedges and gather in the lost sheep.\\" In 1863, she married Philo Horace Woodworth, whom she divorced for infidelity in 1891. She had six children with Woodworth, five of whom died young. In 1902, she married Samuel Etter, who died in 1914.\\"Grandmother of the Pentecostal Mother\\", Healing and Revival, 2004. Accessed July 21, 2011. She studied the scriptures and began preaching the Lord's divine will in healing. It didn't take long to see that evangelism and healing went hand in hand as thousands were won to Christ as a result of seeing others healed. Sister Etter pioneered the way for Pentecostal manifestations that are so common in Charismatic and Pentecostal groups today. Ministry Her earliest exposure to religion was through a local Disciples of Christ congregation. After her marriage, she chose to enter evangelistic ministry. Prohibited from public preaching among the Disciples, she found support in a local Quaker meeting. It was while associating with the Quakers that she received the baptism in the Holy Spirit while praying for an \\"anointing for service\\".Blumhofer, Edith L. The Assemblies of God: A Chapter in the Story of American Pentecostalism. Volume 1. Springfield, Missouri: Gospel Publishing House, 1989. . Page 34-35. After this experience, she began to preach. Reporting hundreds of conversions, her campaigns attracted reporters from across the country. She was briefly affiliated with the Brethren in Christ but eventually joined the Church of God of the General Eldership founded by John Winebrenner. She was dismissed from the Church of God in 1904. She began to pray for the sick in 1885, believing that those with sufficient faith would be healed. Her meetings also became known for people falling to the floor in trance-like states. These people would later report profound spiritual experiences while in such a state. As she preached throughout the nation, her reputation grew, leading her to purchase an 8,000-seat tent in which to conduct her services. In 1912 she joined the young Pentecostal movement and preached widely in Pentecostal circles until her death, helping found the Assemblies of God in 1914.enrichmentjournal.ag.org In 1918 she founded what is today Lakeview Church (Temple) of Indianapolis, Indiana.

He was a point guard for the University of Pittsburgh Panthers from 2001 to 2006. Krauser is and weighs .  High school career  Krauser was born on May 13, 1981, to Joyeria Mays and musician Mario Krauser in the Bronxdale housing projects in The Bronx, New York, where he lived with over 3,500 other people. By the time he was 13, basketball was a large part of his life. Krauser talked about his competitive drive in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article about his peers at the time, \\"When they lost, they went and got an Icee or a juice. When I lost, I wanted to go play again.\\" He was also known for taken 1000 jump shots every night for practice. He went to dangerous neighborhoods to play at his Boys and Girls club and Rosedale \\"The Big Park\\" in the Bronx, and played streetball at Rucker Park. One nickname he had while living in New York City was \\"Black Magic\\". Krauser also played with other players who found success in their basketball careers including Seton Hall's Andre Barrett and former Duke star and NBA player Jay (Jason) Williams. Krauser's career took another step when he made the New York AAU team, the Broncos. When Krauser was 17, he had to repeat his junior year of high school, but instead of repeating the year at Stevenson High School, where he did not make the freshmen basketball team, he chose to attend St. Thomas More Prep. Krauser left St. Thomas More Prep in Connecticut and switched to Notre Dame Academy in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. After performing better academically, Krauser was heavily recruited by Hofstra and the University of Pittsburgh. Jamie Dixon, then the assistant coach at Pitt, was able to recruit Krauser successfully. In his final game at Notre Dame Prep, Krauser scored 51 points. Outside of basketball, Krauser was 2-0 as an amateur boxer.  College career  = 2001-2003 = Carl was known for his trademark symbol he made where after scoring a basket, put his hands over his head in the shape of an \\"X\\" and claimed it was to represent the Bronx. Krauser's first season at Pitt was the 2001-2002 basketball season. Carl was redshirted for his actual freshman season by former Pitt coach, future UCLA head coach, Ben Howland. After spending his first season at Pitt as a redshirt, Krauser came into a stronger Pitt basketball program with guards such as Julius Page and Brandin Knight. In Krauser's first playing season, he averaged 6 points, 2.8 rebounds, and 2.9 assists per game. Krauser had 93 assists in this season, which was the fourth most all time at Pitt by a freshman at that time. Krauser was also named the Most Improved Player at the team's banquet that year. The Panthers made it into the NCAA Tournament in 2002, advancing to the Sweet Sixteen where they lost to Kent State. = 2003-2004 = Krauser's sophomore season showed marked improvement from his freshman year. He received an All-American Honorable Mention by the Associated Press, the Big East's Most Improved Player, and All-Big East second team honors. Pitt chose him as the team's Most Inspiration Player and the best Free Throw Shooter. Krauser led the team averaging 15.4 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game in 2003-04. Carl helped to lead the Pitt Panthers to a berth in the NCAA tournament, where the Panthers again made the Sweet Sixteen before falling to the Oklahoma State Cowboys. = 2004-2005 = In his junior year, Krauser was the leader of team. Pitt had lost both Jaron Brown and Julius Page to graduation, and Krauser was now the floor general for younger players such as freshman guard Ronald Ramon. Some highlights from that season include 31 points against the University of Richmond Spiders, 5 steals against Robert Morris University, and 15 assists against West Virginia. Krauser received the John Wooden Award in his junior season and was also named as a Naismith All-American and a Bob Cousy Award finalist. He was honored by the Big East with two player of the week awards and by being named to the Second- Team All Big East. Krauser led the Panthers to another NCAA Tournament berth as a 9th seed where they lost to 8th seed University of the Pacific. In the offseason, Krauser entered the 2005 NBA Draft but removed his name without hiring an agent so he could retain his NCAA eligibility and play his fifth and final college season at Pitt. Krauser was included in a Sports Illustrated article where he was ranked as one of the top 10 point guards in the nation, and at midseason was predicted to be selected in the NBA Draft. = 2005-2006 = Pitt finished its non-conference season at 11-0 after beating the then No. 22 Wisconsin Badgers by 9 points. Pitt was one of the final seven teams as of January 3 to be undefeated. Krauser went on to lead Pitt to a 21-6 regular season, and Pitt finished 6th in the Big East. The Panthers would go on to lose the Big East Championship game against Syracuse. The Orange made the finals after winning three games in three days. On January 23, 2006 Krauser scored a career-high 32 points against Syracuse.2013‚Äì14 Pitt Men's Basketball Media Guide, 2013, p. 113. Krauser finished the regular season with 15.0 points per game, 4.7 assists per game, and 4.3 rebounds per game. As a 5 seed, Pitt lost in an upset to #13 seed Bradley in the second round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament‚ÄîKrauser's last game at Pitt. Though he struggled down the stretch with his shooting touch, he remained the emotional leader on a quickly maturing team. Krauser wore number 11 while at Pitt in honor of Isiah Thomas. Professional career Krauser spent the 2007‚Äì08 season as a member of the Pittsburgh Xplosion, of the Continental Basketball Association. He was joined by former Pitt player John DeGroat. Halfway through the 2008‚Äì09 season, Krauser joined the Romanian basketball club CSU Asesoft Ploie≈üti and appeared in 23 games for the team between January 17 and May 23 of the year 2009. He averaged 16.3 minutes and 5.5 points per game. In 2010, Krauser signed with the Waikato Pistons of the New Zealand National Basketball League.

An accomplished solo artist, he became known to the public as a member of the German bands Absolute Beginner and La Boom. He performed with his group 'Disko No.1' at the grand final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2011 in D√ºsseldorf, Germany. Biography Delay was born in Hamburg on 25 August 1976. He attended the bilingual Helene-Lange-Gymnasium from 1986 to 1995. In the 1990s, he became known as one third of the pioneering German hip hop group Beginner. His stage name is a reference to Young Deenay, a pop music act in the 90s: the delay/echo is an important effect in reggae and dancehall music. Jan Delay's most significant trademark is his somewhat nasal voice. He also frequently changes his stage name depending on his current music style, mood, and collaboration partners. Bald, he often wears a hat and sunglasses.  Eimsbush label  In 1997, Jan Delay founded his own record label Eimsbush together with partners from the Hamburg hip-hop scene. The label's main goal was to support and guide fresh underground talents and pave their way into the music business without having them \\"selling out\\" to the major labels. The label was initiated by the German hip hop scene while it was going through a boom phase in the mid and late 90s, which led to \\"every Horst [jerk] being allowed to rap if only he can hold up a mic\\" (Jan Delay, MTV Germany, 2007). As a result, real talent stepped back for fear of being seen as sellouts by the underground hip-hop scene. The label was shut down in 2003 due to financial reasons and as a result of the \\"naive idea of just believing in talent outside the mainstream\\" Discography =Albums= * 2001 ‚Äì Searching for the Jan Soul Rebels * 2006 ‚Äì Mercedes Dance * 2007 ‚Äì Searching ‚Äì the Dubs * 2007 ‚Äì Mercedes Dance ‚Äì Live * 2009 ‚Äì Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Soul (GER: 23rd best-selling album of 2009 ) * 2010 ‚Äì Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Soul ‚Äì Live * 2014 ‚Äì Hammer & Michel =Singles= * 1999 ‚Äì \\"Irgendwie, irgendwo, irgendwann\\" ‚Äî (cover version of Nena's song of the same name) * 2001 ‚Äì \\"Ich m√∂chte nicht, dass ihr meine Lieder singt\\" * 2001 ‚Äì \\"Vergiftet\\" * 2002 ‚Äì \\"Die Welt steht still\\" (Sam Ragga Band featuring Jan Delay) * 2006 ‚Äì \\"Klar\\" * 2006 ‚Äì \\"F√ºr immer und dich\\" * 2007 ‚Äì \\"Feuer\\" * 2007 ‚Äì \\"Im Arsch\\" (featuring Udo Lindenberg) * 2007 ‚Äì \\"T√ºrlich, T√ºrlich\\" / Word up * 2008 ‚Äì \\"Ganz anders\\" (featuring Udo Lindenberg) * 2009 ‚Äì \\"Oh Jonny\\" * 2009 ‚Äì \\"Disko\\" * 2010 ‚Äì \\"Hoffnung\\" * 2014 ‚Äì \\"Liebe\\" * 2014 ‚Äì \\"St. Pauli\\" * 2014 ‚Äì \\"Sie kann nicht tanzen\\" * 2018 ‚Äì \\"Gr√ºn-wei√üe Liebe\\" External links * Official website * Portrait of Jan Delay at laut.de (German) * Review of Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Soul(in English) Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:German male singers Category:Participants in the Bundesvision Song Contest Category:German rappers Category:German reggae musicians Category:Musicians from Hamburg Category:21st-century German singers Category:21st-century male singers ","title":"Jan Delay"},{"id":"3610993","text":"Glenn Mart√≠nez (born November 30, 1981 in Auburndale, Florida) is a former American football wide receiver.

Campbell was born in New Barnsley, West Belfast, Northern Ireland and moved to Dublin to work in the building industry. At some point, he joined the INLA, an Irish republican paramilitary group. After his death, his parents said they were unaware that he had been involved in politics. In the summer of 1999, the INLA became involved in a violent dispute with criminals in West Dublin. The INLA claims that it was trying to halt the sale of illegal drugs in the local working class community. Some reports claim that the businesses in an industrial estate appealed to the INLA for protection against a group of criminals and that the INLA were in fact offering support to the beleaguered community. On 6 October 1999, Campbell and two other INLA men captured the drug gang members in a warehouse in Ballymount Industrial Estate in Walkinstown. The INLA men were bundling the captured men into a van when other drug gang members arrived at the scene. During the scuffle that ensued, Campbell was stabbed in the leg with a samurai sword, severing an artery and causing a huge loss of blood, ultimately causing his death. He was buried with full military honours in Milltown Cemetery in Belfast by the INLA who staged a show of force including a uniformed colour party. Over 1,000 people attended his funeral. Campbell's funeral was one of the last high-profile republican paramilitary funerals in Ireland to date.

Among his translations into English are works by Alexis de Tocqueville, √âdouard Dujardin, Andr√© Malraux, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, Georges Simenon, Jean Cocteau, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. He also assisted in the translation of James Joyce's Ulysses into French. He was born at Kelvedon Hatch, Essex, on 25 October 1883, the only son of a retired army officer, Arthur Stronge Gilbert, and Melvina, daughter of Randhir Singh, the Raja of Kapurthala. He attended Cheltenham and Hertford College, Oxford, taking a first in Classical Moderations. He joined the Indian Civil Service in 1907 and, after military service in the First World War, served as a judge in Burma until 1925. He then retired, settling in France with his French-born wife Moune (n√©e Marie Douin). He remained there for the rest of his life, except for some time spent in Wales during the Second World War. Gilbert was one of the first Joycean scholars. He first read Ulysses while he was in Burma and admired it greatly. According to his wife, she and Gilbert were taking a walk in the Latin Quarter of Paris when they passed Shakespeare and Company, and saw some typescript pages of a French translation of Ulysses by Auguste Morel and Valery Larbaud displayed in the window. Gilbert noted several serious errors in the French rendering and introduced himself to Sylvia Beach, who was impressed by his criticisms of the translation. She took his name and telephone number, and suggested that Joyce, who was assisting in the translation, would contact him. This began many years of friendship between Joyce and Gilbert. He published James Joyce's Ulysses: A Study in 1930 (revised edition 1950); contributed an important chapter, \\"Prolegomena to Work in Progress,\\" to Our Exagmination Round His Factification for Incamination of Work in Progress (1929), a collection of perspectives on the fragments of Joyce's \\"work in progress,\\" later completed as Finnegans Wake (1939); and published a collection of Joyce's letters in 1957. One of Gilbert's major projects was the translation from French of Roger Martin du Gard's novel sequence Les Thibault. Running to nearly 1,900 pages in translation, it was published by the Viking Press in the United States in two volumes, The Thibaults (1939) and Summer 1914 (1941).

If they are caught using the other hand, they must 'chug' (rapidly finish) their drink. The game of Buffalo is commonly understood to continue for the players' entire lives, once they have agreed to play. People who play the game refer to themselves as \\"Buffalos\\", and groups of players may refer to themselves as a \\"Buffalo club\\", and the game itself is also sometimes called \\"Buffalo Club\\". History The history and origin of the Buffalo Club are obscure and many versions are in existence. A folk origin of the game states that Buffalo Club stems from the gunslinging days of the Wild West where the use of one's right hand (the shooting hand) was at times a matter of life or death. Thus, recreational activities such as playing cards or drinking were done with the left hand only to avoid severe consequences. The game is now popular around the world. Basic game The rules are fairly simple, though widely varying, and involve which hand a player may use to drink. The basic rule of the game is that a player can only drink with their non-dominant hand. If any other Buffalo players spot them drinking with their dominant hand, they call Buffalo on the player and that player must finish their drink as quickly as possible. If the player hesitates to finish their drink, the other players will usually proceed to make a ruckus chanting \\"Buffalo!\\" and banging on the table until the player finishes. Once a player begins playing Buffalo, they are playing it for the rest of their life. Variants * In one version of the game, all players must drink with their left hand, irrespective of their dominant hand. This removes the need for players to ask each others' dominant hand. * Completing a buffalo with the proper hand can be called a double buffalo, forcing the player to chug two drinks. * If the player calls Buffalo on somebody when they are actually drinking with the proper hand, they may return with a call of \\"False Buffalo\\" and the player is obligated to finish their own drink. If the buffalo-er does not currently possess a drink, the False caller must drink the nearest alcoholic drink available. * One notable exception to the Buffalo rules exists when a right-handed player is drinking a Left Hand milk stout. This beer is deemed an ‚Äúimmunity beer‚Äù, and a player is allowed to drink their drink with either hand. * If a player is ambidextrous and uses this as an excuse, they have to finish your drink and then a hand will be decided for them. * Some players rule that the dominant hand must be used when drinking non-alcoholic beverages, to discourage a player from adjusting their drinking hand for all drinks.

Breast development is commonly asymmetric and one or both breasts may be small. This condition may be a congenital defect associated with underlying abnormalities of the pectoral muscle (as in Poland's syndrome), related to trauma (typically surgery or radiotherapy) or it may be a more subjective aesthetic description. Self perceived micromastia involves a discrepancy between a person's body image, and her internalized images of appropriate or desirable breast size and shape. Societal ideals over breast size vary over time, but there exist many conceived ideas involving breasts and sexual attractiveness and identity across different cultures. Causes Micromastia can be congenital or acquired disorder and may be unilateral or bilateral. Congenital causes include ulnar‚Äìmammary syndrome (caused by mutations in the TBX3 gene), Poland syndrome, Turner syndrome, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. There is also a case report of familial hypoplasia of the nipples and athelia associated with mammary hypoplasia that was described in a father and his daughters. Acquired causes of micromastia include irradiation in infancy and childhood and surgical removal of prepubertal breast bud. Treatment The procedure to remedy micromastia is breast enlargement, most commonly augmentation mammoplasty using breast implants. Other techniques available involve using muscle flap-based reconstructive surgery techniques (latissimus dorsi and rectus abdominis muscles), microsurgical reconstruction, or fat grafting. Another potential treatment is hormonal breast enhancement, such as with estrogens.

Hilbert: √úber die stetige Abbildung einer Linie auf ein Fl√§chenst√ºck. Mathematische Annalen 38 (1891), 459-460. as a variant of the space-filling Peano curves discovered by Giuseppe Peano in 1890.G.Peano: Sur une courbe, qui remplit toute une aire plane. Mathematische Annalen 36 (1890), 157-160. Because it is space-filling, its Hausdorff dimension is 2 (precisely, its image is the unit square, whose dimension is 2 in any definition of dimension; its graph is a compact set homeomorphic to the closed unit interval, with Hausdorff dimension 2). H_n is the n th approximation to the limiting curve. The Euclidean length of H_n is \\\\textstyle 2^n - {1 \\\\over 2^n} , i.e., it grows exponentially with n, while at the same time always being bounded by a square with a finite area.

Accessed: 9 February 2019. File:The seventh order of a Hilbert curve.jpgPhoto of a David Hilbert with the seventh order of a Hilbert curve. Applications and mapping algorithms Both the true Hilbert curve and its discrete approximations are useful because they give a mapping between 1D and 2D space that preserves locality fairly well.. This means that two data points which are close to each other in one-dimensional space are also close to each other after folding. The converse can't always be true. Because of this locality property, the Hilbert curve is widely used in computer science. For example, the range of IP addresses used by computers can be mapped into a picture using the Hilbert curve. Code to generate the image would map from 2D to 1D to find the color of each pixel, and the Hilbert curve is sometimes used because it keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other in the picture. A grayscale photograph can be converted to a dithered black-and-white image using thresholding, with the leftover amount from each pixel added to the next pixel along the Hilbert curve. Code to do this would map from 1D to 2D, and the Hilbert curve is sometimes used because it does not create the distracting patterns that would be visible to the eye if the order were simply left to right across each row of pixels. Hilbert curves in higher dimensions are an instance of a generalization of Gray codes, and are sometimes used for similar purposes, for similar reasons. For multidimensional databases, Hilbert order has been proposed to be used instead of Z order because it has better locality- preserving behavior. For example, Hilbert curves have been used to compress and accelerate R-tree indexesI. Kamel, C. Faloutsos, Hilbert R-tree: An improved R-tree using fractals, in: Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA, 1994, pp. 500‚Äì509. (see Hilbert R-tree). They have also been used to help compress data warehouses. Given the variety of applications, it is useful to have algorithms to map in both directions. In many languages, these are better if implemented with iteration rather than recursion. The following C code performs the mappings in both directions, using iteration and bit operations rather than recursion. It assumes a square divided into n by n cells, for n a power of 2, with integer coordinates, with (0,0) in the lower left corner, (n ‚àí 1, n ‚àí 1) in the upper right corner, and a distance d that starts at 0 in the lower left corner and goes to n^2-1 in the lower-right corner. This is different from the animation shown above where the curve starts from upper left corner and terminates at upper right corner. //convert (x,y) to d int xy2d (int n, int x, int y) { int rx, ry, s, d=0; for (s=n/2; s>0; s/=2) { rx = (x & s) > 0; ry = (y & s) > 0; d += s * s * ((3 * rx) ^ ry); rot(n, &x;, &y;, rx, ry); } return d; } //convert d to (x,y) void d2xy(int n, int d, int *x, int *y) { int rx, ry, s, t=d; *x = *y = 0; for (s=1; s These use the C conventions: the & symbol is a bitwise AND, the ^ symbol is a bitwise XOR, the += operator adds on to a variable, and the /= operator divides a variable. The handling of booleans in C means that in xy2d, the variable rx is set to 0 or 1 to match bit s of x, and similarly for ry. The xy2d function works top down, starting with the most significant bits of x and y, and building up the most significant bits of d first. The d2xy function works in the opposite order, starting with the least significant bits of d, and building up x and y starting with the least significant bits. Both functions use the rotation function to rotate and flip the (x,y) coordinate system appropriately. The two mapping algorithms work in similar ways. The entire square is viewed as composed of 4 regions, arranged 2 by 2. Each region is composed of 4 smaller regions, and so on, for a number of levels. At level s, each region is s by s cells. There is a single FOR loop that iterates through levels. On each iteration, an amount is added to d or to x and y, determined by which of the 4 regions it is in at the current level. The current region out of the 4 is (rx,ry), where rx and ry are each 0 or 1. So it consumes 2 input bits, (either 2 from d or 1 each from x and y), and generates two output bits. It also calls the rotation function so that (x,y) will be appropriate for the next level, on the next iteration. For xy2d, it starts at the top level of the entire square, and works its way down to the lowest level of individual cells. For d2xy, it starts at the bottom with cells, and works up to include the entire square. It is possible to implement Hilbert curves efficiently even when the data space does not form a square. Moreover, there are several possible generalizations of Hilbert curves to higher dimensions.H. J. Haverkort, F. van Walderveen, Four-dimensional Hilbert curves for R-trees, in: Proceedings of the Eleventh Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments, 2009, pp. 63‚Äì73.

After the 1993 season, Moehler moved on to the Jacksonville Suns, where he pitched until late 1996, when he was called up by the Tigers. Moehler made his major league debut in 1996, pitching in 2 games for the Tigers. In 1997, Moehler went 11‚Äì12 in 31 starts, the following year he would have his best season of his career, going 14‚Äì13 with a 3.90 ERA and 4 complete games, including 3 shutouts. In 1999, he led the American league in losses with 16. In 1999, during his stint with Detroit, he gained national media attention when he got caught scuffing the baseball against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and was suspended for 10 games. He would rebound in the year 2000, going 12‚Äì9 for Detroit. 2001 and 2002 Moehler pitched just a combined 4 starts due to injury, he would later be traded in 2002 to the Cincinnati Reds.

It makes up 0.187% of natural calcium by mole fraction. Although it is unusually neutron-rich for such a light nucleus, its beta decay is extremely hindered, and so the only radioactive decay pathway that it has been observed to undergo is the extremely rare process of double beta decay. Its half-life is about 6.4√ó1019 years, so for all practical purposes it can be treated as stable. One factor contributing to this unusual stability is that 20 and 28 are both magic numbers, making 48Ca a \\"doubly magic\\" nucleus. Since 48Ca is both practically stable and neutron-rich, it is a valuable starting material for the production of new nuclei in particle accelerators, both by fragmentation and by fusion reactions with other nuclei, for example in the discoveries of the heaviest five elements on the periodic table, from flerovium to oganesson. Heavier nuclei generally require a greater fraction of neutrons for maximum stability, so neutron-rich starting materials are necessary. 48Ca is the lightest nucleus known to undergo double beta decay and the only one simple enough to be analyzed with the sd nuclear shell model. It also releases more energy (4.27 MeV) than any other double beta decay candidate. These properties make it an interesting probe of nuclear structure models and a promising candidate in the ongoing search for neutrinoless double beta decay.

With the Jaguars leading 20‚Äì13, the Saints used three laterals to score a touchdown as time expired in regulation. However, New Orleans kicker John Carney missed the ensuing extra point that would have sent the game into overtime, and instead gave Jacksonville the 20‚Äì19 victory. Background The Saints, at 7‚Äì7 entering the game, were attempting to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2000. However, they needed to win both of their final two games to have a chance at qualifying for the postseason. The Jaguars had already been eliminated from postseason contention. While the Saints led early on in the game 3‚Äì0 after a John Carney field goal, the scoring had been mostly dominated by the Jaguars. With just seven seconds left at the end of regulation, the Jaguars had built a 20‚Äì13 lead on the Saints. The play Jerome Pathon scoring the touchdown The Saints were on their own 25-yard line looking at second down and 10. Quarterback Aaron Brooks passed the ball to the right side of the field to receiver Dont√© Stallworth, who caught the pass at midfield. Stallworth then bounced off a tackle attempt by Jaguars cornerback Fernando Bryant and turned inside and broke two more tackles. The clock had already reached zero, and Stallworth pitched the ball to the 34-yard line to Michael Lewis, who ran the ball to the 25-yard line of Jacksonville. He then turned and pitched the ball to Deuce McAllister, who ran to the Jaguars' 20-yard line. McAllister then pitched the ball to the right side of the field to Jerome Pathon, who caught the ball at the 24-yard line of Jacksonville. Brooks, who had hustled all the way downfield, then laid a block on the last Jaguars defender and Pathon dove into the end zone. There was a lengthy delay while the officials determined that all of the ball transfers (after the pass to Stallworth) were indeed legal laterals. All the Saints needed was a John Carney extra point to send the game into overtime (Saints coach Jim Haslett eschewed a two-point conversion attempt to win the game immediately). Aftermath Carney lined up to kick the extra point, hit a dead push, and the kick sailed wide right. The famous reaction of Saints play- by-play radio announcer Jim Henderson was a horrified scream: \\"NOOOO!!! He missed the extra point wide right! Oh my God, how could he do that?\\" With no time remaining on the clock, the game was over, giving the Jaguars an improbable 20‚Äì19 victory. Earlier in the season, Coach Haslett had stated to the media that he trusted Carney so much, that he'd even stake his life on him. When reminded later that day of those same comments, Haslett stated, \\"Then I'd probably be dead right now. He's one of the great all-time kickers. I never would have guessed this would happen.\\"NFL Game Center: Post Game ‚Äì New Orleans Saints at Jacksonville Jaguars ‚Äì 2003 Week 16 With the loss, the Saints fell to 7‚Äì8 on the season and were eliminated from contention for the 2003 NFL playoffs. However, even if the Saints had won in overtime, they would have been eliminated from the playoffs, as the Dallas Cowboys won their tenth game of the season that day (9 was the highest possible number of wins the Saints could have had if they won) and the Seahawks eventually won their tenth game to gain a wild card. The Saints would, however, finish their season on a high note the next week with a 13‚Äì7 home victory over the playoff-bound Dallas Cowboys. For the Jaguars, the victory would lift them to a 5‚Äì10 record. They would go on to lose the next week, 21‚Äì14, to the Atlanta Falcons.

Geomorphology  Beaufort's Dyke is a submerged tunnel valley caused by glacial erosion during the last glacial period, and has been prevented from filling with sediment by strong tidal currents.  Dumped munitions  Because of its depth and its proximity to the Cairnryan military port, Beaufort's Dyke became the United Kingdom's largest offshore dump site for surplus conventional and chemical munitions after the Second World War: it had been used for the purpose since the early 20th century. The Ministry of Defence estimated that well over a million tonnes have been dumped there. In July 1945, 14,500 tonnes of artillery rockets filled with phosgene were dumped. Munitions have since been deposited by the tide on nearby beaches. In 1995, phosphorus bombs washed up on Scottish coasts, coinciding with the laying of the Scotland-Northern Ireland pipeline (SNIP), a gas interconnector constructed by British Gas. In the prior five years, antitank grenades had been washing up on Northern Irish and Isle of Man shores.

The Round Valley Indian Reservation is a federally recognized Indian reservation lying primarily in northern Mendocino County, California, United States. A small part of it extends northward into southern Trinity County. The total land area, including off-reservation trust land, is 93.939 km¬≤ (36.270 sq mi). More than two-thirds of this area is off- reservation trust land, including about in the community of Covelo. The total resident population as of the 2000 census was 300 persons, of whom 99 lived in Covelo.  History of the Round Valley Natives  The Round Valley Indians consists of the Covelo Indian Community. This community is an accumulation of people from several tribes: the Yuki, who were the original inhabitants of Round Valley, Concow Maidu, Little Lake and other Pomo, Nomlaki, Cahto, Wailaki, and Pit River peoples. They were forced onto this remnant of the land formerly occupied by the Yuki tribe. Round Valley Agency sutler and office, 1876 The Round Valley Indian Reservation began in 1856 as the Nome Cult Farm, an administrative extension of the Nome Lackee Reservation located on the Northwestern edge of the Sacramento Valley, one of the five reservations in California legislated by the United States Government in 1852.Anderson, M. Kat (2006). Tending the Wild: Native American Knowledge and the Management of California's Natural Resources, pp. 88-89. University of California Press. . The system of Indian reservations had a dual purpose: to protect Indians by segregating them from the settlers converging on California in greater and greater numbers; and to free Indian land for the settlers' use. When the reservation was established, the Yuki people (as they came to be called) of Round Valley were forced into a difficult and unusual situation. Their traditional homeland was not completely taken over by settlers as in other parts of California. Instead, a small part of it was reserved especially for their use as well as the use of other Indians, many of whom were enemies of the Yuki. The Yuki had to share their home with strangers who spoke other languages, lived with other beliefs, and who used the land and its products differently. Indians came to Round Valley as they did to other reservations - by force. The word \\"drive\\", widely used at the time, is descriptive of the practice of \\"rounding up\\" Indians and \\"driving\\" them like cattle to the reservation where they were \\"corralled\\" by high picket fences. Such drives took place in all weather and seasons, and the elderly and sick often did not survive. From years of intermarriage, a common lifestyle, and a shared land base, a unified community emerged. The descendants of Yuki, Concow Maidu, Little Lake and other Pomo, Nomlaki, Cahto, Wailaki, Pit River peoples formed a new tribe on the reservation, the Covelo Indian Community, later to be called the Round Valley Indian Tribes. Their heritage is a rich combination of different cultures with a common reservation experience and history.  Fort Wright  Between July, 1856, when Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Thomas J. Henley, requested official designation of the valley as Nome Cult farm, and the granting of his request in 1858, Round Valley slowly filled with farms and ranches despite its reservation status. Relations between the various Indian groups, settlers and White employees of the reservation reached a state of extreme hostility. Bloodshed became a frequent occurrence as settlers massacred Indians. Superintendent Henley requested that the United States Army be sent to the valley to mediate. Late in 1858, a company of the U. S. Army departed Benicia for Mendocino County. Due to inclement weather, the march was forced to halt at Fort Weller in Redwood Valley, but Lieutenant Edward Dillon was sent ahead with a party of seventeen men to occupy the barracks in Round Valley. Fort Wright was then established in December 1862, on the western edge of the Valley.Frazer, Robert W. (1965). Forts of the West, p. 34. University of Oklahoma Press. Originally the soldiers were to protect the Indians from White attacks but soon, as part of the Bald Hills War, were deployed to capture Indians throughout the area and bring them to confinement on the Reservation.  Federal legislation  Members of the Round Valley Indian Tribe retrace the 1863 route of the Nome Cult walk, a forced relocation of Indians from Chico, Calif., to Covelo, CA. President Ulysses S. Grant formally established the Round Valley Indian Reservation by Executive Order on March 30, 1870, pursuant to the Four Reservations Act of 1864.13 Stat. 39. Life on the Round Valley Reservation has since been affected by much government legislation. Two of the most significant impacts were from the Dawes Act of 1887, also known as the Allotment Act, and the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, known as the IRA. The Allotment Act caused the Reservation to be subdivided in 1894 into five and plots which were distributed to families. By assigning specific pieces of land to individuals, the Act opened the door to private land ownership for Indians. Although the land was allotted, it was still held in trust by the government. However, in 1920, allotees were allowed to \\"fee patent\\" their land: to receive a deed to it by giving up its trust status and accompanying benefits, such as freedom from taxation. Some Round Valley People lost their land as a result. Either they were unable to pay the new taxes on it or they sold it to whites or other Indians for the cash. Others prospered by establishing farming and stock-raising operations. They leased extra land and raised garden vegetables, hay, hogs, and cattle. In 1934, the United States Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act. In the interests of promoting self-government, only those Indian organizations consisting of elected councils, rather than those based on cultural traditions, were recognized as tribes by the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Indians of Round Valley jointly elected a tribal council and wrote a constitution both of which still function. Along with this alteration in tribal management, a whole range of new regulations intended to halt the loss of land from the Indian Community was also instituted. The IRA repealed the Allotment Act and Indians on the Reservation were deprived of the legal ability to buy and sell land, hold deeds and to take out loans. The land was put back into trust status and trust land could not be used as security. When first recognized, the tribe and reservation were both known as the Covelo Indian Community.Round Valley Indian Reservation History.

He was not inducted into the Carracci Academy. Forced to flee from Bologna, due to what Malvasia and Amorini describe as a quarrel leading to the death of the other party, he moved to Florence, where he painted frescoes, fa√ßade decorations, and altarpieces (1599‚Äì1606) including an Adoration of the Shepherds (Pitti Palace). In Florence, he mainly worked under Domenico Passignano, but also Bernardino Poccetti and Jacopo da Empoli. He was lured back to Bologna and Reggio Emilia, by Ludovico Carracci. His Grieving over a dead Jesus is in the Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna. He painted a series of frescoes for the Brami Chapel in the sanctuary, as well as other works, for the Basilica della Ghiara in Reggio Emilia. He also painted in Cremona (1623‚Äì24).

He lived in the sixth or early seventh century, in the early Byzantine era. He wrote an extensive compendium in Greek of the techniques of the Hellenistic astrologers who preceded him, and is one of our best sources for the work of Antiochus of Athens. Although no intact original manuscript survives of his work, we do have several late Byzantine versions of it. Rhetorius provides important confirmation of the survival of the more obscure astrological techniques of Vettius Valens, the practicing astrologer whose tradition is somewhat at variance with the more well-known methods of Claudius Ptolemy; for example, in his treatment of the Lot of Fortune as a horoskopos, much as Valens treated Lots, and in his use of sect with lots. In addition, Rhetorius discusses the late-Roman systems of time lords, a topic which came to be heavily developed by the Persians, Arabs and medieval Europeans. Rhetorius provides an informative link between the earlier Hellenistic tradition and the Arab and medieval practices that followed him.

There has been much other speculation as to the origin of the name 'Halizones', with connections to both the 'Amazons' and the River Halys being suggested. It is not even clear that Homer thought the Halizones really existed. Homer's scholiast derived the name from hals, sea, explaining that they lived in a land surrounded by the sea. However, he stated elsewhere that Odius was chief of the Paphlagonians. Herodotus (4.17, 52) placed the Halizones among the Scythians in the region of modern Vinnytsia Ukraine, while Ephorus, equating them with Amazons, located them near Cyme in Asia Minor.

A number of the stories deal with post-colonial life in the Caribbean, particularly in her native Guyana, as well as of some stories being set in London. Many of her characters, most of them displaced people from former colonies struggling to come to terms with a new life in Britain, attempt to find an identity, to reconcile their past and to escape from the restlessness hinted at in the title. Salman Rushdie described the collection as \\"notably sharp, funny, original...part Caribbean magic, part London grime, written in a slippery, chameleon language that is a frequent delight\\".

According to one reviewer: \\"A magnificent sense of pacing is the first of Melville's skills that impresses the reader of this mesmerizing collection. The second is her gift for voices ... she has an amazing range, from West Indians in London celebrating carnival, to the self-conscious, resentful Macusi Indian brought by her literal-minded British husband to a wedding in London, to the irritable Canadian wife whose husband has been sent to Guyana for two years to serve as unofficial liar for a mining corporation. Magic realism is the label most readers and critics will paste on Melville's work ... it is an appropriate but incomplete description.

The experiment was first performed by Frederick Thomas Trouton and Alexander Oliver Rankine in 1908. The outcome of the experiment was negative, which is in agreement with the principle of relativity (and thus special relativity as well), according to which observers at rest in a certain inertial reference frame, cannot measure their own translational motion by instruments at rest in the same frame. Consequently, also length contraction cannot be measured by co- moving observers. See also Tests of special relativity. Description The famous Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment of 1887 showed that the then-accepted aether theory needed to be modified. FitzGerald and Lorentz, independently of each other, proposed a length contraction of the experimental apparatus in the direction of motion (with respect to the Luminiferous aether) that would explain the almost null result of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment. The first attempts to measure some consequences of this contraction in the lab frame (the inertial frame of reference of an observer co-moving with the experimental apparatus) were made in the experiments of Rayleigh and Brace (1902, 1904), though the result was negative. By 1908, however, the then- current theories of electrodynamics, Lorentz ether theory (now superseded) and special relativity (now generally accepted, and lacking any aether at all), predicted that the Lorentz‚ÄìFitzGerald contraction is not measurable in a co- moving frame, because these theories were based on the Lorentz transformation. In the Trouton‚ÄìRankine experiment, it was expected that length changes due to Lorentz‚ÄìFitzGerald contraction would result in detectable changes in the measured voltage across a Wheatstone bridge as the circuit is rotated. Frederick Thomas Trouton, (after conducting the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment in 1903), instead did the calculations using his own interpretation of electrodynamics, calculating the length contraction according to the velocity of the experimental apparatus in the aether frame, but calculating the electrodynamics by applying Maxwell's equations and Ohm's law in the lab frame. According to Trouton's view of electrodynamics, the calculations then predicted a measurable effect of the length contraction in the lab frame. Together with Alexander Oliver Rankine, he set out to verify this in 1908 by attempting to measure the change of the resistance of a coil as they changed its orientation to the \\"aether velocity\\" (the velocity of the lab through the luminiferous aether). This was done by putting four identical such coils in a Wheatstone bridge configuration which allowed them to precisely measure any change in resistance. The circuit was then rotated through 90 degrees about its axis as the resistance was measured. Because the Lorentz‚ÄìFitzGerald contraction is only in the direction of motion, from the point of view of the \\"Aether frame\\" the length of the coils depended on their angle with respect to their Aether velocity. Trouton and Rankine therefore believed that the resistance as measured in the rest frame of the experiment should change as the device was rotated. However their careful measurements showed no detectable change in resistance. This showed that if the Lorentz‚ÄìFitzGerald contraction existed, it was not measurable in the rest frame of the object ‚Äì only theories containing the complete Lorentz transformation, like special relativity, are still valid.

Regarded as the father of Chicano theater in the United States,Hollywood Blockbusters, Independent Films and Shorts Selected for 2010 National Film Registry Library of Congress. Valdez is best known for his play Zoot Suit, his movie La Bamba, and his creation of El Teatro Campesino. A pioneer in the Chicano Movement, Valdez broadened the scope of theatre and arts of the Chicano community. Biography =Early life= Valdez was born in Delano, California, to migrant farm worker parents from Mexico, Armeda and Francisco Valdez.Film Reference The second of 20 children in his family, Valdez began to work the fields at the age of 6. One of his brothers is actor Daniel Valdez. Throughout his childhood, the family moved from harvest to harvest around the central valleys of California. Due to this peripatetic existence, he attended many different schools before the family finally settled in San Jose, California. =Education= Valdez began school in Stratford, California. His interest in theatre began in the first grade. Throughout grammar school, Valdez organized plays at school and put on puppet shows in his garage, which, he recalls, were usually about fairy tales.Beth Bagby; Luis Valdez \\"El Teatro Campesino Interviews with Luis Valdez\\" In high school, Valdez was part of the Speech and Drama department and acted in several plays. He described himself as \\"a very serious student.\\" Valdez graduated from James Lick High School in San Jose and went on to attend San Jose State University (SJSU) on a scholarship for math and physics. During his second year of college, he switched his major to English. While in college, Valdez won a playwriting contest with his one-act play The Theft in 1961. Two years later, in 1963, Valdez's first full-length play, The Shrunken Head of Pancho Villa, was produced by the drama department and debuted at SJSU.Bedford/St Martin's Literature web site. =Early Career: El Teatro Campesino= After graduation, Valdez spent the next few months with The San Francisco Mime Troupe, where he was introduced to agitprop theatre, guerrilla theatre, and Italian commedia dell'arte. These two techniques greatly influenced Valdez's development of the basic structure of Chicano theatre: the one-act presentational acto (act). In 1965, Valdez returned to Delano, where he enlisted in Cesar Chavez's mission to organize farm workers into a comprehensive union. Valdez brought together farm workers and students to form El Teatro Campesino, a farm worker's theater troupe. El Teatro was known for touring migrant camps with their actos, one-act plays, which were usually around fifteen minutes long. The plays were used to educate and inform not only the farm workers, but also the public. Valdez believed that humor was a major asset to his plays in El Teatro Campesino as it was a tool to lift the morale of strikers. Social and political commentary were intertwined within the humor to accomplish the goals of El Teatro Campesino. Original plays of El Teatro were based on the experiences of farm workers, but by 1967 their subject matter expanded to other aspects of Chicano culture; Los Vendidos, for example, discusses various Chicano stereotypes. Although Valdez left El Teatro in 1967, his legacy lived on. Thanks in large part to Valdez and El Teatro Campesino, the 1970s saw an explosion of Chicano theater. Theater groups sprang up with surprising speed on college campuses and in communities throughout the United States. What began as a farm workers' theater in the migrant camps of Delano flooded into a national Chicano theater movement. =Later career= In 1967, Valdez established a Chicano cultural center in Del Rey, California. In 1969 he moved both theater and cultural center to Fresno, where they remained for two years. During this time, he made the short film I Am Joaquin based on the legendary poem by Rodolfo \\"Corky\\" Gonz√°les (it was later inducted into the National Film Registry in 2010 and preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2017). While in Fresno, Valdez taught at Fresno State College and created TENAZ, the national Chicano theater organization, which was composed of many with theatre groups throughout the Southwest. Valdez moved the theater a final time in 1971, to San Juan Bautista, south of San Francisco. Combined now with the cultural center, it was called El Centro Campesino Cultural, and it became a fully professional production company. In 1989, Valdez and officials from the Hispanic Academy of Media Arts and Sciences and Nosotros formed the Latino Writers Group to improve opportunities and pay for Latino writers in Hollywood. Luis Valdez is a founding faculty member and director (c. 1994) of the California State University, Monterey Bay Teledramatic Arts and Technology Department. He is credited with assisting in the development of a university program that prepares students in the entertainment industry: filmmaking, writing, sound, cinematography, and the like.biography from The Harry Walker Agency Speakers Bureau website . His recent play Valley of the Heart, debuted October 30, 2018 at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. He resides in San Juan Bautista, CA. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2015. Zoot Suit (play and film) Valdez's first work that brought him attention to larger audiences was the play Zoot Suit which ran in 1978 at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and played for forty- six weeks to more than 40,000 people. With Zoot Suit, Valdez became the first Chicano director to have a play presented on Broadway in 1979. In 1981, it was made into a film.Hayward, Carl . Community Arts Network interview with Valdez. In Zoot Suit, Valdez weaves a story involving the real-life events of the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial‚Äîwhen a group of young Mexican-Americans were wrongfully charged with murder‚Äîand the Zoot Suit riots. In 2019, the film Zoot Suit was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". La Bamba The film that brought Valdez his \\"breakthrough into mainstream America\\" was La Bamba which debuted in 1987. The film, about Ritchie Valens, a popular Chicano 1950s rock and roller, \\"was an overwhelming box office success\\" according to BookRags.BookRags web page. It was inducted into the National Film Registry in 2017.

His father was a maker of vats (mastelli). Born in Bologna, he trained in the Carracci Academy degli Incamminati at about the time when Domenichino, Lucio Massari, and perhaps Albani were there. He belongs to the generation of Carracci- inspired or trained painters comprised by Giacomo Cavedone (1577‚Äì1660); Alessandro Tiarini (1577‚Äì1668), Lucio Massari, Lionello Spada (1576=1622), and Lorenzo Garbieri. Art biographer Malvasia claims he befriended the Genoese Agostino Tassi while in Rome. Between 1613-1614, he contributed to the decoration of the chapel of Saint Dominic in the Basilica of San Domenico in Bologna. On the right side of the chapel The Miracle of the Forty Drowned (1613) and on the left side the canvas Resurrection of the young Napoleone Orsini (1614). He also frescoed the patron saints of Bologna on the pendentives of the dome: San Floriano, St. Francis, San Procolo and San Petronio.

It was directed by Kim Ki-young and starred Lee Eun-shim, Ju Jeung-nyeo and Kim Jin- kyu. It has been described in Koreanfilm.org as a \\"consensus pick as one of the top three Korean films of all time\\". This was the first film in Kim's Housemaid trilogy followed by Woman of Fire and Woman of Fire '82. The film was remade in 2010 by director Im Sang-soo.  Plot  The film is a domestic horror thriller telling of a family's destruction by the introduction of a sexually predatory femme fatale into the household. The film begins with a scene of a composer, Dong-sik Kim, reading to his wife a newspaper story about a man falling in love with his maid. The story then jumps to the composer working at a factory. The composer has just moved into a two-story house with his wife and two children. When his pregnant wife becomes exhausted from working at a sewing machine to support the family, the composer hires a housemaid, Myung-sook, to help with the work around the house. The new housemaid behaves strangely, catching rats with her hands, spying on the composer, seducing him and eventually becoming pregnant by him. The composer's wife convinces the housemaid to induce a miscarriage by falling down a flight of stairs. After this incident, the housemaid's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. She threatens to kill the composer's newborn son. She tricks the composer's son Chang-soon into believing that he has ingested poisoned water, and in a panic, he falls to his death down a flight of stairs. Instead of turning her in to the police, Mrs. Kim offers to support Myung-sook in order to keep her from losing her job, and she asks for the husband. The composer moves upstairs with the maid and his wife labors over her sewing machine, falling asleep at her work every day. Unable to stand their new arrangement, both the wife and daughter attempt to poison Myung-sook, but she outsmarts them. Finally, Myung-sook persuades the composer to commit suicide with her by swallowing rat poison. He crawls downstairs and dies next to his wife, asking her to \\"Take good care of the children.\\" The film ends with the composer reading the story from a newspaper with his wife, returning to the very beginning of the film. The narrative of the film has apparently been told by the composer, who then smiles and warns the film audience that this is just the sort of thing that could happen to anyone.  Cast  * Kim Jin-kyu as Dong-sik Kim (the husband/father) * Ju Jeung-ryu as Mrs. Kim (the wife/mother) * Lee Eun-shim as Myung-sook (the housemaid) * Um Aing-ran as Kyung-hee Cho (the factory worker who takes piano lessons) * Ko Seon-ae as Seon-young Kwak (the factory worker who commits suicide) * Ahn Sung-ki as Chang-soon Kim (the son) * Lee Yoo-ri as Ae-soon Kim (the daughter) * Kang Seok-je * Na Jeong-ok Critical response In 2003, Jean-Michel Frodon, editor-in-chief of Cahiers du cin√©ma, wrote that the discovery of The Housemaid by the West, over 40 years after the film's debut, was a \\"marvelous feeling‚Äîmarvelous not just because one finds in writer-director Kim Ki-young a truly extraordinary image maker, but in his film such an utterly unpredictable work\\". Comparing the director to Luis Bu√±uel, Frodon wrote Kim is \\"capable of probing deep into the human mind, its desires and impulses, while paying sarcastic attention to the details\\". He called The Housemaid \\"shocking\\", noting that \\"the shocking nature of the film is both disturbing and pleasurable\\". Frodon pointed out that The Housemaid was only one early major film in the director's career, and that Kim Ki-young would continue \\"running wild through obsessions and rebellion\\" with his films for decades to come.

It is the science that studies ions and molecules in the gas phase, most often enabled by some form of mass spectrometry. By far the most important applications for this science is in studying the thermodynamics and kinetics of reactions.Pure & Appl. Chem., Vol. 70, No. 10, pp. 1969-1976, 1998. For example, one application is in studying the thermodynamics of the solvation of ions. Ions with small solvation spheres of 1, 2, 3... solvent molecules can be studied in the gas phase and then extrapolated to bulk solution. Theory =Transition state theory= Transition state theory is the theory of the rates of elementary reactions which assumes a special type of chemical equilibrium (quasi-equilibrium) between reactants and activated complexes. =RRKM theory= RRKM theory is used to compute simple estimates of the unimolecular ion decomposition reaction rates from a few characteristics of the potential energy surface. Gas phase ion formation The process of converting an atom or molecule into an ion by adding or removing charged particles such as electrons or other ions can occur in the gas phase. These processes are an important component of gas phase ion chemistry. =Associative ionization= Associative ionization is a gas phase reaction in which two atoms or molecules interact to form a single product ion. :A^* + B \\\\to AB^{+\\\\bullet} + e^- where species A with excess internal energy (indicated by the asterisk) interacts with B to form the ion AB+. One or both of the interacting species may have excess internal energy. =Charge-exchange ionization= Charge-exchange ionization (also called charge-transfer ionization) is a gas phase reaction between an ion and a neutral species :A^+ + B \\\\to A + B^+ in which the charge of the ion is transferred to the neutral. =Chemical ionization= In chemical ionization, ions are produced through the reaction of ions of a reagent gas with other species.Munson, M.S.B.; Field, F.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966, 88, 2621-2630. Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometry. I. General Introduction. Some common reagent gases include: methane, ammonia, and isobutane. =Chemi-ionization= Chemi-ionization can be represented by :G^* + M \\\\to M^{+\\\\bullet} + e^- + G where G is the excited state species (indicated by the superscripted asterisk), and M is the species that is ionized by the loss of an electron to form the radical cation (indicated by the superscripted \\"plus-dot\\"). =Penning ionization= Penning ionization refers to the interaction between a gas-phase excited-state atom or molecule G* and a target molecule M resulting in the formation of a radical molecular cation M+., an electron e‚àí, and a neutral gas molecule G: :G^* + M \\\\to M^{+\\\\bullet} + e^- + G Penning ionization occurs when the target molecule has an ionization potential lower than the internal energy of the excited-state atom or molecule. Associative Penning ionization can also occur: :G^* + M \\\\to MG^{+\\\\bullet} + e^- Fragmentation There are many important dissociation reactions that take place in the gas phase. =Collision-induced dissociation= CID (also called collisionally activated dissociation - CAD) is a method used to fragment molecular ions in the gas phase. The molecular ions collide with neutral gas molecules such as helium, nitrogen or argon. In the collision some of the kinetic energy is converted into internal energy which results in fragmentation. =Charge remote fragmentation= Charge remote fragmentation is a type of covalent bond breaking that occurs in a gas phase ion in which the cleaved bond is not adjacent to the location of the charge. Charge transfer reactions There are several types of charge-transfer reactions (also known as charge-permutation reactions): partial-charge transfer :A^{2+} + B \\\\to A^+ + B^+, charge-stripping reaction :A^+ + B \\\\to A^{2+} + B + e^-, and charge-inversion reaction positive to negative :A^+ + B \\\\to A^- + B^{2+} and negative to positive :A^- + B \\\\to A^+ + B + 2e^-.

Economy Carberry and the surrounding rural area are known as \\"King Spud Country\\", a nickname which pays homage to the high quality potatoes grown in the area due to ideal soil conditions for the crop. Many businesses in Carberry offer services and supplies to support the robust agriculture industry. Food processing makes use of locally produced crops and is a major employer in the community. A local factory owned by McCain Foods makes various potato products, and is a major supplier for McDonald's Restaurants in Canada and the United States as well as producing potato products that are found in other well known restaurants, grocery stores and other varied world markets. It is one of the most highly advanced facilities of its kind in North America and normally operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.McCain Foods Carberry location profile Along with potatoes, the local agriculture industry is very diverse and includes other vegetable, grain, pulse, and industrial hemp crops as well as dairy, poultry and livestock, among other mixed farming.TownofCarberry.ca :Business Climate Carberry's population increased by 4.1% between 2011 and 2016, due in part to the community's strong, stable economy along with other factors including its geographic location in relation to major transportation routes and the nearby city of Brandon. The close proximity of Carberry to Spruce Woods Provincial Park and the many unique recreational activities in the area make Carberry a popular tourist destination. Many businesses and services cater to tourists both on a seasonal and year-round basis. History =Early history= In the late 1760s, a small fur trading post called Pine Fort was established by independent fur traders from Montreal, south of Carberry's present site in what is now Spruce Woods Provincial Park along the Assiniboine River. At that time, a diverse group of Native peoples were travelling through the area and harvesting rich crops of beaver and other furs. Early fur trade accounts indicate that the Sioux from the south, resident Cree and Assiniboine, and eastern groups such as Saulteaux, Ottawa and various Ojibwa bands were all trading or hunting in the area. Pine Fort was later taken over by the North West Company, and was eventually abandoned in 1811. Native people continued to pass through or reside in the Carberry area and did so until the late 1870s when European settlement began to affect the landscape and game resources. The Native population in the area was eventually settled onto reserves according to treaty provisions with the Federal Government of Canada. =Incorporation= The town of Carberry was officially founded in 1882. It was settled primarily by settlers coming from Eastern Canada who were of British origin, and was named after the Carberry Tower located near Musselburgh, Scotland.Carberry and Area History Canadian Pacific Railway As is the case with most towns in the southern districts of Western Canada, the present town of Carberry owes its origin mainly to the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1882, the CPR established a station at De Winton, a now defunct town-site about 3.5 kilometres east of Carberry's present site. At the time, several CPR officials covertly purchased much of De Winton's town-site property, hoping for large personal profits as the new town grew around the new train station. This kind of speculation was strictly against the CPR's company rules, and on discovering the violation, the rail company decided to use 100 specially-hired men to physically move the train station to the present site of the town of Carberry. The extensive and secret operation was conducted in the middle of the night and was completed in less than 12 hours. When the station reached its new location, the town of Carberry was born. Carberry quickly grew into a prosperous town and was an important stop along the Canadian Pacific Railway. The CPR main line route runs through Carberry to this day, however the passenger train station has since been removed. Trans Canada Highway The Trans Canada Highway, another major national transportation route, was originally constructed on a routing that passed directly through the town of Carberry, which it did until the late 1950s when the route was changed according to plans for it to be upgraded to a 4-lane divided high-speed highway. Many businesses were established in Carberry to service the heavy traffic on the highway, many of which still exist. Today the Trans Canada Highway is located 3 km north of Carberry, and the old Trans Canada Highway route which passes directly through the town is known as Provincial Road 351 (within town limits it is known as 1st Avenue). =Military history= Wilfrid Reid \\"Wop\\" May, former Carberry Resident and WW1 Hero Camp Hughes In 1909, a military training camp named \\"Camp Sewell\\" was established 10 kilometres west of Carberry along what is now PR 351 on the south side of the Canadian Pacific Railway line. The name of the camp was changed in 1915 to \\"Camp Hughes\\" in honour of Major-General Sir Sam Hughes, Canada's Minister of Militia and Defence at the time. The soldiers and support staff stationed at Camp Hughes naturally maintained very close social and economic ties with the town of Carberry which was only a short distance away. Extensive trench systems, grenade and rifle ranges, and military structures were built at Camp Hughes between 1915 and 1916, and a variety of retail stores and entertainment complexes on a double-avenued area close to the main camp formed a lively commercial midway. During World War I, more than 38,000 troops of the Canadian Expeditionary Force trained at the camp, giving it the largest population in the province of Manitoba outside of the capital city, Winnipeg. Many of the soldiers who were trained at the camp were involved in the infamous Battle of Vimy Ridge.MB Heritage Site No. 82 The military continued to train soldiers at Camp Hughes until 1934, when troops were moved to CFB Shilo and CFB Winnipeg for financial and logistical reasons.W Galbraith 2004 Masters Thesis: Camp Hughes Camp Hughes has been designated as a Provincial Heritage Site, and although the site is no longer active, it is still monitored by the Canadian Department of National Defense. There is a roadside park named \\"Camp Hughes Wayside Park\\" located 13 kilometres west of Carberry on the Trans Canada Highway near the west intersection with PR 351, a short distance north of the actual Camp Hughes site, named in honour of the military camp. RCAF Station Carberry In December, 1940, troops of the Royal Air Force arrived in Carberry and established the Service Flying Training School Number 33 just south of Carberry, known as RCAF Station Carberry. It was used to train military pilots in the vast British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Thousands of military personnel from United Kingdom, Canada and other Commonwealth countries were moved to Carberry for flight training. The flight training school was disbanded at the end of World War II, and is now the present site of the McCain Foods processing facility.

With his unique double-handed playing style, Marshall finished runner-up to the great Pakistani player Jansher Khan at the World Open in 1994 and the British Open in 1995. When he reached the World No. 2 ranking behind Jansher in November 1994, many observers felt he seemed a strong candidate to displace the aging Pakistani champion as World No. 1. However, in 1995, Marshall was afflicted with glandular fever, the effects of which meant he was unable to play top-level squash for two years. Marshall returned to the professional tour in 1997, re-claiming his place in the England squad which went on to win the World Team Squash Championships title in Malaysia. He broke back into the world's top-10 in 1999, and won his third British National Championship title in February 2000. He was protecting a remarkable record, having been unbeaten in that event since December 1989.  Early career  Marshall won British junior titles at all age-groups (under-12, under-14, under-16 and under-19). He first became England's No.1 in November 1991, holding the position unchallenged for four years. His coach and mentor was the six-time British champion Jonah Barrington. In 1989, Marshall won the British Open U19. The following year, he became World Masters U23 Champion. His first full year of international competition was 1991, but it was in the 1994-95 season that Marshall's promise was most powerfully demonstrated. He was a finalist in five PSA Super Series events leading up to and including the 1995 British Open. Marshall was British and European No 1 for several years.  After retiring from the professional tour  Marshall released an autobiography about his battle against chronic fatigue syndrome in 2001 entitled Shattered: A Champion's Fight Against a Mystery Illness. Marshall has a BSc in Physiotherapy from the University of Nottingham and an Executive MBA from Imperial College London. He currently works for Ernst & Young. In 2008, Marshall won the Over-35 British National Championship in Manchester. He also won the British Open Masters Over-40 in 2016 and 2018. Marshall is an Ambassador for Access Sport, a charity focused on providing children from disadvantaged areas with access to local sports and promoting the real difference sport can make within deprived communities. He is also a trustee for the England Squash Foundation, a national charity with a vision to enhance young people's lives through squash. In May 2015, Marshall was given a Lifetime Achievement Award at the World Squash Awards for his achievements, continued support and commitment to the game.

This fruit has thin skin that ranges from yellow to a dark red or purple, is ovular in shape, and grows to around 4 cm in length. Its flowers grow either individually or in clusters of three, and each flower has five petals. P. cattleyanum reproduces through setting seed and through cloning. Clonally produced suckers tend to have a greater leaf area.Huenneke, L. (1990). Seedling and clonal recruitment of the invasive tree Psidium cattleianum: Implications for management of native Hawaiian forests. Biological Conservation 53(3): 199-211. Though native to Brazil, it is now distributed throughout many tropical regions. It was introduced in Hawaii as early as 1825 to create an agricultural market for its fruits, but it has yet to be a commercially viable product. It is now highly prevalent in tropical rain forest ecosystems due mainly to accidental transportation and its invasive plant properties.C. Wikler, J. Pedrosa-Macedo, M. Vitorino, M. Caxamb√∫, C. Smith. (1999). Strawberry Guava (Psidium cattleianum) ‚Äì Prospects for Biological Control. Proceedings of the X International Symposium on Biological Control of Weeds 4‚Äì14 July 1999. Montana State University, Bozeman, Montana. Edited by Neal R. Spencer pp. 659-665 (2000). P. cattleyanum has modest economic impacts in Hawaii due to its edible fruits and beads that are made by tying individual fruits together.Tunison, J. T., & Stone, C. P. (1992). Special ecological areas: an approach to alien plant control in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Alien plant invasions in native ecosystems of Hawaii. Hawai'i: management and research, 781-798. However, products made from P. cattleyanum are not commercially available because of a lack of market and the heavy presence of fruit flies. This renders the fruits inedible soon after they are picked. Additionally, its seeds have many health benefits, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties in addition to a high amount of Vitamin C.K. McCook-Russella, M. Nairb, P. Faceya, C. Bowen- Forbesa. (2012). Nutritional and nutraceutical comparison of Jamaican Psidium cattleianum (strawberry guava) and Psidium guajava (common guava) fruits. Food Chemistry 134(2): 1069-1073.  Ecology  P. cattleyanum occurs primarily in mesic tropical rainforest environments at an elevation of up to 1300m, but is found primarily below 800m.Smith, C. W. 1985. Impact of alien plants on Hawaii's native biota. pp. 180-250. in C. P. Stone and J. M. Scott (eds.). Hawaii's terrestrial ecosystems: preservation and management. Univ. Hawaii Coop. Natl. Park Resour. Studies Unit, University of Hawaii Press. pp. 584. Its native range is restricted to the Amazonian Basin in Brazil, but it has established in many other tropical areas of similar characteristics. P. cattleyanum does not dominate plant communities in its native range. But, it is invasive due to its robust tolerance to many different environments. P. cattleyanum is prevalent in both undisturbed and highly disturbed roadside habitats in its invasive range. Its invasive quality may be explained by a high amount of genetic variation, as variants of different fruit colors cluster at different elevations.Huenneke, L.F. and P. M. Vitousek. 1989. Seedling and clonal recruitment of the invasive tree Psidium cattleianum: implications for management of native Hawaiian forests. Biological Conservation 53: 199-211. Additionally, P. cattleyanum is both very shade- tolerant and able to withstand soils with a moderate to high pH level.Sem, G. S. 1984. A population study and distribution of strawberry guava (Psidium cattleianum) in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii. Master's thesis. Univ. Hawaii, Honolulu. 84 pp. It is also capable of withstanding heavy leaf litter and responding to bending or breaking of its branches by generating vigorous shoots. P. cattleyanum is often associated with invasive feral pigs The two species are often found near each other, most likely because feral pigs aid in the spread of P. cattleyanum. The pigs disturb habitats by digging in the soil, making it easier for P. cattleyanum seeds to reach the soil. Additionally, feral pigs may ingest the fruits, whose seeds reach the soil in the scat of the feral pigs. Preliminary research suggests that P. cattleyanum is allelopathic, as its roots have been found to inhibit the growth of at least two other plant species when soil pH was not a factor.Brown, R. L., C. S. Tang, and R. K. Nishimoto. 1983. Growth inhibition from guava root exudates. HortScience 13(3): 316-318. Invasive species Invasive growth in Hawaii Native to Brazil where it is known as ara√ß√° (ara-SAH) and adjacent tropical South America, it is closely related to common guava (P. guajava), and like that species is a widespread, highly invasive species in tropical areas throughout the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It tends to form dense, monotypic stands which prevent regrowth of native species, and is very difficult to eradicate; it also provides refuge for fruit flies which cause extensive agricultural damage. It is able to propagate quickly due to the spread of its seed, which occurs as its seeds fall and as birds and feral pigs transport fruits, as well as through its root sprouts. As an invasive species, P. cattleyanum is sometimes erroneously called Chinese guava. It was introduced to many of the areas it now invades due to human usage as a crop for its edible fruit. Cattley guava is sporadically naturalised in coastal areas of Queensland and northern New South Wales. It is also naturalised on Lord Howe Island, Norfolk Island and Christmas Island (Navie 2004; Queensland Herbarium 2008). The yellow variety bears even more heavily than the red and generally has larger fruit. P. cattleyanum grows effectively in undisturbed areas, complicating restoration efforts in sensitive habitats. Its ubiquity in damaged ecosystems further muddles management due to its high dispersal from these less-sensitive habitats to more fragile habitats. P. cattleyanum acts as an invasive by creating dense thickets that crowd out sunlight, limiting the potential for other plant species to coexist. Its ability to thrive in a variety of different habitats under many different ecological conditions threatens native flora of many different habitat types. Additionally, its potential allelopathic qualities further complicate the ability of other plant species to coexist.  Control Strategies  Dense thicket growth in Hawaii forests A variety of management strategies have been applied to P. cattleyanum management efforts due to its ubiquity and the various ways it spreads. Despite the great threat that P. cattleyanum poses to many tropical ecosystems, some studies indicate that isolated groups can be totally eradicated after three to four years of proper management applications, such as cutting and burning mature individuals and applying herbicide to stumps. However, continued follow-up management is necessary indefinitely after a period of high-intensity restoration. This management strategy, known as the ‚Äúspecial ecological areas,‚Äù is one of the strongest ways of controlling plant species over time. It works by focusing wood removal, burning, and other management efforts in the designated efforts. Feral pigs and non-native birds contribute to the spread of P. cattleyanum via seed dispersal. Thus, some control efforts involve removal and control of invasive fauna. However, results from such efforts are often unsuccessful due to the lack of dependence upon the animals for dispersal, as germination occurs under a wide variety of conditions. Another management technique is the introduction of insects that act as parasites on the invasive plants. This biological control approach is used because certain insects cause damage to P. cattleyanum in a way that either prevents the tree from reproducing or kills them outright. Most of the proposed insects infect the tree with bud or leaf galls, effectively preventing fruit growth or photosynthesis. For example, Diasineura gigantea caused bud galls that inhibited shoot growth. The Brazilian Scale is a potential biological control agent used in Florida,Wessels, Frank J., James P. Cuda, M. Tracy Johnson and Jos√© Henrique Pedrosa-Macedo. 2007. Host specificity of Tectococcus ovatus (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), a potential biological control agent of the invasive strawberry guava, Psidium cattleyanum (Myrtales: Myrtaceae), in Florida. BioControl. Volume 52, Number 4 / August, 2007. and Hawaii. However, some insects cannot be used due to the potential for certain species to attack more than P. cattleyanum. Once such species, the sawfly (Haplostegus epimelas), attacked commercially produced guava plants in addition to invasive P. cattleyanum. Uses The whole fruit can be eaten as both the thin skin and juicy interior are soft and tasty. It can also be used to make jam. The skin is often removed for a sweeter flavour. The seeds are small and white in colour. Its leaves may be brewed for tea. The wood of the tree is hard, compact, durable, and resistant, and is used for lathe work, tool handles, charcoal, and firewood. The plant is indispensable for mixed planting in reforestation of reclaimed and protected areas in Brazil.

It is now in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Front view; one of two enamelled hinge plates survive that would have attached a strap so that the reliquary could be carried, possibly around the neck. It is an early example of the chasse or house-shaped reliquary, that became popular across Europe later in the Middle Ages, perhaps influenced by Insular styles. The Monymusk Reliquary is now empty. Its dimensions are W 112mm x D 51mm x H 89mm.The Monymusk Reliquary at the National Museum of Scotland It has been said to be the Brecbennoch of St. Columba (modern Gaelic Breac Bannoch or \\"embossed peaked-thing\\"), a sacred battle ensign of the Scottish army, used for saintly assistance, but is now thought not to be the object mentioned in historical records. Very few Insular reliquaries survive, although many are mentioned in contemporary records. Style It is characterised by a mixture of Pictish artistic designs and Irish artistic traditions (perhaps first brought to Scotland by Irish missionaries in the sixth century), fused with Anglo-Saxon metalworking techniques, an artistic movement now classified as Insular or Hiberno-Saxon art. The casket is wooden, but is covered with silver and copper-alloy. It was made around 750, probably by Ionan monks. It shows a combination of the Pictish and Insular styles which appear in manuscripts such as the Lindisfarne Gospels (c. 715 AD). The silver plates on the front and lid of the casket are decorated with beasts leaping and twisting, and biting at their tails on a spotted field, characteristic of animal style in Celtic art. The stippled punch marks are characteristically Irish in style. The Brecbennoch The Monymusk Reliquary was said to have contained relics of St. Columba, the most popular saint in mediaeval Scotland, and from the 19th century was believed to be the \\"Brecbennoch of St. Columba\\", a sacred battle ensign of the Scottish army, though this is now doubted by scholars.The Monymusk Reliquary at the National Museum of Scotland The Brecbennoch may have been handed to the abbot of Arbroath Abbey during the reign of William I (r. 1165 - 1214), who in turn passed it to someone else's care at Forglen. The custodian was charged with the care of the reliquary, so that it could be used for saintly assistance by the Scots in battle. It was carried by the Scottish army who were victorious against the army of King Edward II of England at the Battle of Bannockburn (1314). History The Monymusk Reliquary was perhaps at Forglen until the sixteenth century, when both Forglen and Monymusk came into the hands of the Forbes family. In 1712 it was transferred to Sir Francis Grant of Cullen. It stayed in the Grant collection until 1933, when it was due to be auctioned, but was acquired by the National Museum of Scotland first, with the help of the Art Fund. It is arguably one of the most important pieces in the museum's collection.

It lies within the townland of Ballymurphy, between Falls Road and the M1 motorway. Milltown Cemetery opened in 1869 as part of the broader provision of services for the city of Belfast's expanding Catholic population. The cemetery was an important development in the episcopal reign of Bishop Patrick Dorrian of the Diocese of Down and Connor. Although the cemetery's history and story is often presented as a nationalist and Irish Republican site, in fact the overwhelming majority of the approximately 200,000 of Belfast dead who are buried there were ordinary, unknown Catholics. Within the cemetery there are three large sections of open space, each about the size of a football pitch, designated as \\"poor ground\\". Over 80,000 people are buried in the cemetery's poor grounds, many of whom died in the flu pandemic of 1919. Since 2007, the cemetery has undergone extensive work, reversing years of neglect. Republicanism The cemetery has, for some, become synonymous with Irish republicanism. Irish Republican Army prisoner Bobby Sands, who died on hunger strike on 5 May 1981, is buried in the cemetery. Fellow hunger-strikers, Kieran Doherty, Joe McDonnell and Pat McGeown (who died a number of years later from ill-health brought about by the hunger strike) are also buried there. In total, 77 IRA volunteers are buried in what is known as the 'New Republican Plot', a further 34 volunteers are buried in what is known as the County Antrim Memorial Plot and which was used between 1969 and 1972.National Graves Association leaflet 'Milltown Cemetery' Throughout the cemetery, many more IRA volunteers are buried in family graves. These include Tom Williams, who was executed in Crumlin Road Prison on 2 September 1942. Williams' body lay in a prison grave until January 2000, when a campaign, by the National Graves Association, Belfast, to have his remains re-interred in Milltown was successful. Members of the INLA, IPLO and Workers' Party are also buried there.Cemetery Records The cemetery was the scene of the Milltown Cemetery attack on 16 March 1988, when loyalist paramilitary Michael Stone attacked a funeral, killing three mourners as IRA volunteers Dan McCann, Se√°n Savage and Mair√©ad Farrell, were being buried. All three were killed by members of the SAS at Gibraltar during Operation Flavius.

It was director Kim Jee-woon's feature film debut. The story centers on a family who owns a hunting lodge in a remote area, whose customers always happen to end up dying. Among the film's main cast are pre-stardom Choi Min-sik and Song Kang- ho. The film was loosely remade in Japanese as The Happiness of the Katakuris by Takashi Miike, in Indian Tamil as Yaamirukka Bayamey, in Kannada as Namo Bhootatma and in Telugu as Next Nuvve.  Plot  An extended family has moved from the city (presumably Seoul) to live in a large house out in the mountains, which they convert into a lodge for hikers. Consisting of a middle aged father Kang Dae-goo (Park In-hwan), mother Jeong Soon-rye (Na Moon-hee), Dae-goo's younger brother Kang Chang-goo (Choi Min-sik), and their adult children Kang Young-min (Song Kang-ho), Kang Mi-soo (Lee Yoon-seong) and Kang Mina (Go Ho-kyung) they suffer a string of misfortunes as various patrons come to stay. Their first guest, a hiker, asks for a room and three beers. Left to himself, he spends the night forging his room key holder to be sharp enough to stab himself and is found dead the next morning. The father of the family decides on burying the body in the woods, under the assumption that no one would believe this to be a suicide. Later, a young couple drops in for a stay to have sex in the privacy of their room and end up dead together the next morning. A pair of friends from town stop by for drinks until one of the men falls for Mi-soo and subsequently attempts to rape her, but she is saved by Young-min, who accidentally ends up pushing the man off a cliff, while his friend is taken captive by the family to prevent him from calling the police. Mr. Park, the benefactor of the family (providing them the house) later asks for their lodging for his younger (and illegitimate) half sister to have a hitman check into the neighboring room at midnight and murder her so he can be the only successor to the claim inheritance of the soon profitable land. Uninformed of the plan, Uncle Kang senses foul play and sends the half sister home to Seoul when she is found to be restless. The plan goes further awry when the hitman arrives fifteen minutes late, and the room had been taken by an undercover cop investigating the recent string of missing people, mistaken to be the hitman. The hitman thus ends up killing the cop instead, and is later killed by a suspicious Young-min. A heavy rainstorm overnight nearly uncovers the buried corpses by morning, leaving the family no choice but to incinerate them. When Uncle returns from the trip to Seoul, he angers Dae-goo who had hoped to settle Mr. Park's plot without any trouble. A fight ensues as Uncle is beaten senseless but is saved from a blow to the head by Young-min who then trips, hitting his head on the stairs, he is whisked to the hospital, leaving the elderly parents the only ones left to finish the job. The local man, having been imprisoned, bound and gagged, tries to make his escape but gets his ropes tangled in several trees as he escapes the lodge. Soon enough, Mr. Park drops in unannounced to check if his sister-in-law has been terminated as planned, but is in complete shock when he sees Mr. Kang and Mrs. Jeong carrying the corpse of the undercover cop, knowing that he wasn't the hitman. A brief struggle begins when Mr. Park tries to escape without trying to figure out just what exactly has happened, and ends after he accidentally falls to his death down the stairs, adding yet another body to be done away with for the family. To drive away attention, Mrs. Jeong switches off the circuits throughout the lodge and outside storage where she and her husband are piling the corpses, dousing them in gasoline. Mina, trying to watch TV, asks for Uncle Kang to switch the circuits back on, inadvertently causing a socket in the storage to burst in flames, triggering the cremation fire prematurely, trapping the parents inside. Meanwhile, Young-min is in the hospital recovering from his concussion and laughing insanely over a news report on the shooting of a North Korean agent wandering through the forest. After an uncertain amount of time later, Uncle Kang, Young-min, Mi-soo, and Mina are preparing to serve dinner, totally unaware of the fire in the storage building. The parents return, in bandages, having survived the fire. Without a single word, the family quietly has dinner until there is a sudden knock at the door. Unsure of what to do, they all stand quietly in the doorway of the dining room, waiting for whoever is at the door to go away. When the dog starts barking at the knocking, the family, in unison hushes the dog; they have become the quiet family. The film ends with a wide shot of the lodge in winter, with Mina outside, looking at it, and then to the camera with an uncertain look on her face; all to the sound of The Partridge Family's \\"I Think I Love You\\".

The financial woes of the former British colony were worsened when two of the colony's commercial banks, the Union Bank of Newfoundland (established in 1854) and the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland (established in 1858), both located in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada, closed their doors to the public on December 10, 1894. Fish merchants sat on the boards of directors of both of these banks, and had approved large and risky loans to themselves, leaving the banks with dangerously small cash reserves leading into the crash. London banks suspended credit to the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and requested payment on some of its loans. The Commercial was unable to meet these demands and was forced to close two days later. A bank run ensued on both the Union and Savings Banks. The government-run Savings bank was able to weather the storm, but the Union was forced to close that day, never to re-open.  Aftermath  The crash had a disastrous effect on commerce and employment in the colony. Many families were left destitute. The crash brought Newfoundland to the brink of bankruptcy and resulted in the Canada Newfoundland Confederation talks. It also highlighted the weakness of its economy and the truck credit system on which it depended. Over a million dollars in bank notes from both the Commercial and Union banks were rendered worthless, at least temporarily. Savings accounts suddenly decreased in value and the country was in danger of defaulting in its public debt. The banks' directors were arrested and charged with larceny and conspiracy (they were all acquitted in 1897). Unemployed workers held street demonstrations demanding food and jobs. The government faced growing instability, going through three prime ministers in two months. Canadian banks began arriving within two week of the crash: the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Bank of Montreal, the Canadian Bank of Commerce, and the Merchant's Bank of Halifax (now the Royal Bank of Canada). The Bank of Montreal accepted the government's account in early 1895 and the country adopted Canadian currency in January of that year. This was the beginning of heavy involvement by the Canadian banks in the Newfoundland economy, which was an important factor in Newfoundland eventually joining confederation in 1949.

He renounced his post as director of this observatory in 1947 and returned to Mexico City, where he dedicated himself to writing articles on astronomy for the newspaper Exc√©lsior. As an amateur astronomer, he is also noted for his study of southern variable stars.

The \\"MacCrae's Corners\\" post office was established in 1854, and MacCrae was postmaster. In 1854, the settlement's name was changed from MacCrae's Corners to \\"Alma\\", after the Battle of Alma. James Ledingham and his family moved to Alma in 1864, and built a saw and chopping mill. In 1865, St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church was established in Alma. The church moved to a new stone church in Alma in 1892. The Wellington, Grey and Bruce Railway built a line through Alma in 1870. The line was eventually taken over by Canadian National Railway, and was abandoned in 1983. The Alma railroad station has since been destroyed. After the railway was constructed, Alma became \\"a bustling service centre for the local settlers and travellers\\". Alma was noted for having a post office, wagon maker, weaver, telegraph office, shoemaker, grist mill, several saw mills, several stores, three churches, and four hotels. In 1879, the population was 250. Wallace Cummings Park in Alma was constructed in 2003 on of donated land.

Production of allomones is a common form of defence, particularly by plant species against insect herbivores. Many insects have developed ways to defend against these plant defenses (in an evolutionary arms race). One method of adapting to allomones is to develop a positive reaction to them; the allomone then becomes a kairomone. Others alter the allomones to form pheromones or other hormones, and yet others adopt them into their own defensive strategies, for example by regurgitating them when attacked by an insectivorous insect.

The third instar feeds in a similar manner and may kill up to six termites at a time.

Role The judge Shamgar slaughters 600 men with an ox goad. From a medieval German manuscript. A cyclical pattern is regularly recounted in the Book of Judges to show the need for the various judges: apostasy of the Israelite people, hardship brought on as punishment from God, crying out to the Lord for rescue. The story of the judges seems to describe successive individuals, each from a different tribe of Israel, described as chosen by God to rescue the people from their enemies and establish justice. While judge is a literalistic translation of the Hebrew term used in the Masoretic text, the position as described is more one of unelected non-hereditary leadership. than that of legal pronouncement. However, Cyrus H. Gordon argued that they may have come from among the hereditary leaders of the fighting, landed and ruling aristocracy, like the kings (basileis) in Homer. Coogan says that they were most likely tribal or local leaders, contrary to the Deuteronomistic historian's portrayal of them as leaders of all of Israel, but Malamat pointed out that in the text, their authority is described as being recognized by local groups or tribes beyond their own. Historicity and timeline Timeline of biblical judges (one interpretation) The biblical scholar Kenneth Kitchen argues that, from the conquest of Canaan by Joshua until the formation of the first Kingdom of Israel and Judah (), the Israelite tribes may have formed a loose confederation. In this conception, no central government would have existed but in times of crisis, the people would have been led by ad hoc chieftains, known as judges (shoftim). However, some scholars are uncertain whether such a role existed in ancient Israel. Working with the chronology in Judges, Payne points out that although the timescale of Judges is indicated by Jephthah's statement (Judges 11:26) that Israel had occupied the land for around 300 years, some of the judges overlapped one another. Claiming that Deborah's victory has been confirmed as taking place in 1216 from archaeology undertaken at Hazor, he suggests that the period may have lasted from to . Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson wrote that if There is also doubt among some scholars about any historicity of the Book of Judges. Judges mentioned in the Hebrew Bible In the Hebrew Bible, Moses is described as a shofet over the Israelites and appoints others to whom cases were delegated in accordance with the advice of Jethro, his Midianite father-in-law.Exodus 18:13‚Äì26. The Book of Judges mentions eleven leaders who are said to \\"judge\\" Israel: Othniel, Shamgar, Deborah, Gideon, Tola, Jair, Jephthah, Ibzan, Elon, Abdon, and Samson. Ehud, described in the text between Othniel and Shamgar, is never said to judge Israel, but is usually included as a judge because the history of his leadership follows a set pattern characteristic of five of the others. The First Book of Samuel mentions Eli and Samuel, as well as Joel and Abiah (two sons of Samuel). The First Book of Chronicles mentions Kenaniah and his sons. The Second Book of Chronicles mentions Amariah and Zebadiah (son of Ishmael). The Book of Judges also recounts the story of Abimelech, an illegitimate son of Gideon, who was appointed as a judge-like leader by the citizens of the city of Shechem. He was later overthrown during a local conflict, and the classification of Abimelech as a judge is questionable.Judges 9:1-57. The biblical text does not generally describe these leaders as \\"a judge\\", but says that they \\"judged Israel\\", using the verb ◊©÷∏◊Å◊§÷∑◊ò (≈°-f-t). Thus, Othniel \\"judged Israel\\" (Judges 3:10), Tola \\"judged Israel twenty-three years\\" (Judges 10:2), and Jair judged Israel twenty-two years (Judges 10:3).

He started to write it on a trip to Los Angeles trying to get in touch with Roger Corman in order to sell to the famous Hollywood director four of his play scripts, but he was not welcomed. Caicedo devoted his time in the USA to seeing movies, studying blues and rock and writing this novel.Corporaci√≥n Otraparte: \\"El Atravesado, de Andr√©s Caicedo\\", Teatro Frastricida, Envigado, June 8, 2007.

That same afternoon, its author committed suicide.CAREAGA, Roberto, Fuguet prepara antolog√≠a de Andr√©s Caicedo, el primer enemigo de Macondo, La Tercera, Santiago de Chile, February 22, 2008. Link retrieved on June 14, 2008. Caicedo described his book as a result of an \\"ephemeral curiosity\\", but there is a small but dedicated core of readers who believe it to be one of the greatest novels among Colombian literature of the second half of the 20th century.  Context  The novel is set in the city of Cali, known also as the \\"World Capital of Salsa\\".Salsa.ch: Cali, Capital Mundial de la Salsa, link retrieved on June 14, 2008. It is also the native city of Caicedo, who reflects its barrios and streets and its people of the 1970s.  Plot summary  The novel has been seen as an invitation to a party without end, where the main character comes to see the world as a bottomless pit of debauchery, which she relishes. There is a secret pact with death itself involving the ever more frantic dance of Mar√≠a del Carmen Huerta, the blonde protagonist of the book. The novel also offers an affectionate view of the Colombian city of Cali as unique, magic, and different. Our introduction starts in the privileged north, with its Sixth Avenue (\\"la Sexta\\"), Parque Versalles, and its magical places, continuing to the ghetto in the South with its Caseta Panamericana (built especially for the 1971 Pan American Games), the Pance River, the neighborhoods beyond upper-class Miraflores, the winged Andes mountain range, and the hideouts of sex and salsa in the final stretches of 15th Street (\\"la Quince\\").  Mar√≠a del Carmen Huerta  She is a girl of good family, the daughter of a photographer of the Calean high society. But living in a high class comes to be for her boring and then she decided to explore the streets of the city. Through the eyes of Maria del Carmen, Caicedo shows the different social groups of the 1970s Cali, that reflects also the Colombian society and in a wider way Latin America. As a kind of Siddhartha of Hermann Hesse, Maria del Carmen goes from group to group looking for a sense for her life. The first group she found is of Marxists who used to go by the streets of Cali or Bogot√° with backpacks, untidy hair and Das Kapital to read anywhere to anyone who dare to listen to them as a kind of preachers. She got bored of this first team and abandoned them soon to look more pure emotions She came to the rock world imported to the city by the children of parents who were able to study in the USA and return to Cali wearing gang clothes. Maria del Carmen became a part of a gang to try any kind of drugs while listening to the Rolling Stones.  References   External links  * HERN√ÅNDEZ, Adriana, ¬°Qu√© viva la m√∫sica!

They are ethnically close kin to the peoples of adjacent New Ireland and tribes like the Tanga people and are thought to have migrated to the Gazelle Peninsula in relatively recent times, displacing the Baining people who were driven westwards. The majority of Tolais speak Kuanua as their first language (~100,000). Two other languages are spoken as first languages: Lungalunga and Bilur, each with approximately 2,000 speakers. The Tolais almost universally define themselves as Christian and are predominantly Roman Catholic and United Church. Christianity was introduced to the island when Methodist ministers and teachers from Fiji arrived in the New Guinea islands region in 1875. However, in 1878 when some of the tribespeople ate four of the missionaries, the Englishman who led the missionaries, George Brown, directed and took part in a punitive expedition that resulted in a number of Tolais being killed and several villages burnt down. In August 2007, the descendants of Tolai tribespeople who ate a Fijian minister and three Fijian teachers in 1878 publicly apologized for the incident to Fiji's High Commissioner, Ratu Isoa Tikoca. The apology was accepted. At the event, Papua New Guinea's Governor-General Paulias Matane told the crowd he appreciated the work of the early Fijian missionaries in spreading Christianity in the islands region. Notwithstanding the Christianization of the Tolais for more than a century, old beliefs and traditions still persist, e.g., the belief in the female spirits of the Tubuans with secret ceremonies performed by initiates of the Duk-Duk society as well as the belief in sorcery to either gain someone's love or to punish an enemy. The Tolais are divided into two moieties. Membership is determined by matrilineal descent.

The Apocalypse Hystory. Editora Evangraf, Porto Alegre, 2011. After this first concert, guitar player Ruy Fritsch and drummer Chico Fasoli joined their ranks, playing with the band at the Festival 1¬∫ √ìpera Rock. From the beginning, they presented a very different style, compared to the other local groups. They made use of organ, synthesizers, classical vocals and created songs influenced by Uriah Heep, Yes, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Rush, Genesis and Queen. From 1984 to 1988, the line-up changed several times.Apocalypse biography, ProgArchives.com In 1992, the line-up stabilized with Eloy Fritsch (keyboards), Ruy Fritsch (guitar), Chico Fasoli (drums) and Chico Casara (bass, vocals). Apocalypse was now signed to rock label Musea. The album \\"Perto do Amanhecer\\" was released in France in 1995. The good reviews from abroad soon started to arrive, which led to a rise in the band's popularity and another invitation from Musea, this time for the compilation \\"Le Melleur du Progressif Instrumental\\". This CD was edited in the end of 1995 with several European bands and Apocalypse representing Brazil. With its baroque influences and interplay of minimoog and guitar solos, the chosen song was ‚ÄúNotre Dame‚Äù. In their following album, ‚ÄúAurora dos Sonhos‚Äù, Apocalypse created several complex and long progressive rock tracks, such as \\"Do Outro Lado da Vida\\" and \\"Vindo das Estrelas\\". ‚ÄúAurora dos Sonhos‚Äù was again released in France by Musea and was well received. In 1998, the band was invited to play at the Planeta Atl√¢ntida music festival in Southern Brazil.Apocalypse (Brazil) , Gepr.net After this show, they signed with Atra√ß√£o, a Brazilian label and released a CD entitled \\"The Best of Apocalypse\\", with tracks from their French CDs.

One year later, in 1999, they are invited to play in the USA, at the long running progressive rock festival, Progday. This show would make history, because it was the first time a Brazilian band recorded a show in the USA for a CD release The album ‚ÄúLive in USA\\" was released as a double CD with a CD- ROM track containing a videoclip and a booklet with many photographs from the US trip. The CD saw the light of day in 2000 and Rock Symphony took over the distribution.

Gilliam is associated with the Washington Color School, a group of Washington, D.C. area artists that developed a form of abstract art from color field painting in the 1950s and 1960s. His works have also been described as belonging to abstract expressionism and lyrical abstraction. He works on stretched, draped and wrapped canvas, and adds sculptural 3D elements. He is recognized as the first artist to introduce the idea of a draped, painted canvas hanging without stretcher bars around 1965. This was a major contribution to the Color Field School. In his more recent work, Gilliam has worked with polypropylene, computer-generated imaging, metallic and iridescent acrylics, handmade paper, aluminum, steel, plywood, and plastic. Biography Sam Gilliam was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, the seventh of eight children born to Sam and Estery Gilliam. The Gilliams moved to Louisville, Kentucky shortly after he was born. His father worked on the railroad; his mother cared for the large family. At a young age, Gilliam wanted to be a cartoonist and spent most of his time drawing. In 1951, Gilliam graduated from Central High School in Louisville. After high school, Gilliam attended the University of Louisville and received his B.A. degree in Fine Arts in 1955 as a member of the second admitted class of black undergraduate students. In the same year he held his first solo art exhibition at the University. From 1956 to 1958 Gilliam served in the United States Army. He returned to the University of Louisville in 1961 and, as a student of Charles Crodel,https://www.leoweekly.com/2006/06/man-of-constant- color-sam-gilliama%C2%A2a%C2%ACa%C2%A2s-abstract-art-comes-home-for-a- retrospective/ received his M.A. degree in painting.Sam Gilliam Jr., A Study of Different Uses of Solid Forms in Painting, A Thesis Submitted to the Graduate School of the University of Louisville, 1961.Gilliam listened to his college professor's advice to become a high school teacher and was able to teach art at Washington's McKinley High School. Gilliam devoted on developing his painting during his weekdays reserved for the classroom.In 1962, Gilliam moved to Washington, D.C. after marrying Washington Post reporter Dorothy Butlerwho is also the first African American female reporter at the Washington PostGilliam currently lives in Washington, D.C. with his long-term partner Annie Gawlak. =Career in the 1960s, early 1970s= In the 1960s, as the political and social front of America began to explode in all directions, Gilliam began to take bold declarative initiatives, making definitive imagery, inspired by the specific conditions of the African-American experience. This was at a time that \\"abstract art was said by some to be irrelevant to black African life.\\" Abstraction remained a critical issue for artists such as Gilliam. His early style developed from brooding figural abstractions into large paintings of flatly applied color, pushing Gilliam to eventually remove the easel by eliminating the stretcher. During this time period, Gilliam painted large color-stained canvases, which he draped and suspended from the walls and ceilings, comprising some of his best-known artwork. In 1972, Gilliam represented the US at the Venice Biennale, the first African-American artist to do so. In 2017, he exhibited at the Venice Biennale once again, in the Giardini's central pavilion. Gilliam was influenced by German Expressionists such as Emil Nolde, Paul Klee, and the American Bay Area Figurative School artist Nathan Oliveira. Early influences included Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland. He says that he found many clues about how to go about his work from Tatlin, Frank Stella, Hans Hofmann, Georges Braque, Pablo Picasso, and Paul C√©zanne. In 1963, Thomas Downing, an artist who identified himself with the Washington Color School, introduced Gilliam to this new school of thought. Around 1965, Gilliam became the first painter to introduce the idea of the unsupported canvas. He was inspired to do this by observing laundry hanging outside his Washington studio. His drape paintings were suspended from ceilings or arranged on walls or floors, representing a sculptural third dimension in painting. Gilliam says that his paintings are based on the fact that the framework of the painting is in real space. He is attracted to its power and the way it functions. Gilliam's draped canvases change in each environment where they are arranged and frequently he embellishes the works with metal, rocks, and wooden beams. =Career in the 1970s and 1980s= In 1975, Gilliam veered away from the draped canvases, and became influenced by jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He started producing dynamic geometric collages, which he called \\"Black Paintings\\" because they are painted in shades of black. In the 1980s Gilliam's style changed dramatically once more, transitioning to quilted paintings reminiscent of African patchwork quilts from his childhood, using an improvisational approach. His most recent works are textured paintings that incorporate metal forms. Recognition Gilliam has had many commissions, grants, awards, exhibitions and honorary doctorates. A major retrospective of his work was held at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 2005. He was named the 2006 University of Louisville Alumnus of the Year. Other honors include eight honorary doctorates, and the Kentucky Governor's Award in the Arts. He has received several National Endowment for the Arts grants, the Longview Foundation Award, and a Guggenheim Fellowship. He also received the Art Institute of Chicago's Norman W. Harris Prize, and an Artist's Fellowship from the Washington Gallery of Modern Art. In 1987 he was selected by the Smithsonian Art Collectors Program to produce a print to celebrate the opening of the S. Dillon Ripley Center in the National Mall. He donated his talent to produce In Celebration, a 35-color limited-edition serigraph that highlighted his trademark use of color. The sale benefited the Smithsonian Associates, the continuing education branch of the larger Smithsonian Institution. In early 2009, he again donated his talents to the Smithsonian Associates to produce a 90-color serigraph entitled Museum Moment, which he describes as \\"a celebration of art\\". In April 2003, a dedication of the installation of his work, Matrix Red-Matrix Blue, was held at Rutgers Law School, Newark. In May 2011, his work From a Model to a Rainbow was installed in the Washington Metro Underpass at 4th and Cedar, NW. In 2016, Gilliam was commissioned to produce a piece as part of the grand opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC). Sam Gilliam participated in the 2017 Venice Biennale, Viva Arte Viva, May 13‚ÄìNovember 16, 2017. In 2018, his work was exhibited at ArtBasel. An exhibition at Dia:Beacon took place in August 2019, where his work was described by The Wall Street Journal as \\"innovative, loosely draped work is a light and luminous addition to the galleries at Dia Beacon.\\" The first major retrospective of his work in nearly two decades was announced and scheduled to open in 2022 at The Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, DC. Selected artwork Solar Canopy, 1986\\"Sam Gilliam, Solar Canopy, 1986\\", Unforgotten Masterpieces. Picture of Gilliam's Solar Canopy, 1986 An aluminum sculpture made by color field artist Sam Gilliam in 1986. It is a large 34'x 12'x 6\\" feet painted sculpture located at York College, City University of New York's Academic Core Lounge on the third floor across a huge open window. It is suspended from the ceiling at high. The artwork is made up of painted geometric shapes with many vibrant colors, some having a solid color while others have a tie-dye effect painted on them. The artwork is connected together in a horizontal diagonal with a circular shape in the middle. The circular middle is red on the outside and underneath is painted with many different colors in a tie-dye effect. It also has small blocks under it painted in solid colors of red, orange, blue and yellow. Attached to some of the small blocks are triangular blocks. Close-up of Solar Canopy Jamaica Center Station Riders, Blue, 1991 Picture of Jamaica Center Station Riders, Blue Located at the Jamaica Center train station (E,J,Z) is a large aluminum sculpture mounted high outside on a wall above one of the entrances. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority Arts for Transit project commissioned the work in 1991. It is made up of geometric shapes painted in solid primary colors (red, yellow, blue). The shape of the overall sculpture is circular, with the outer part being blue while the inner parts are red and yellow. In the artist's words, the work \\"calls to mind movement, circuits, speed, technology, and passenger ships...the colors used in the piece... refer to colors of the respective subway lines. The predominant use of blue provides one with a visual solid in a transitional area that is near subterranean.\\"\\"Jamaica Center-Parsons-Archer  Sam Gilliam\\", MTA Arts & Design, MTA. Personal life In 1962, Gilliam married Dorothy Butler, a Louisville native and the first African-American female columnist at The Washington Post. They divorced in the 1980s but have three daughters (Stephanie, Melissa, and Leah) and also have three grandchildren. After the divorce he met Annie Gawlak, owner of the G Fine Art gallery in Washington DC, who is now Gilliam's longtime partner. In the 1960s, Gilliam was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and prescribed lithium, which badly damaged his kidneys. He stopped taking the medication and changed his diet by cutting out red meats and eating fruits and nuts. Gilliam lives in Washington D.C. but in 2010 sold his studio on 14th Street, NW, just north of Colorado Avenue for $3.85 million.

It was published in 1985, after taking thirteen years to complete. The novel recounts the adventures of 10-year-old Pidge and his younger sister, Brigit, battling with characters from Celtic mythology. Plot  In a Galway bookshop, Pidge buys a book called A Book of Patrick's Writing and accidentally frees an evil serpent, Olc-Glas, from inside it. Pidge and his five-year-old sister, Brigit, are then caught up in a battle between good (the Dagda) and evil (the Morrigan). Talking animals and other figures from Celtic mythology help them, and they travel to T√≠r na n√ìg. Setting The Irish Times wrote that \\"the unspoilt countryside around Lough Corrib provided the inspiration\\" for the book. Links to Celtic mythology *Queen Maeve, her husband, Ailill, and their seven sons, the Maines *Cathbad *The goddess Brigid *Angus Og *The Morrigan, a triple goddess, and her two counterparts: **Bodb, the Scald Crow **Macha, the Queen of Phantoms *Saint Patrick *The Dagda *C√∫chulainn Critical responses ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books‚Äô‚Äô at the University of Chicago said that \\"The prose is rather relentlessly ornamented, but the images are always concrete and, like the narrative, have vigorous strength.\\" Imogen Russell Williams, writing in The Guardian nearly 30 years after the book's publication, described it as \\"a bravura feat of writing ... Its impossibly delicate balance of surreal humour and evoked beauty, knowledge, fearfulness, joy, and courage have never been bettered\\". Joanne Hall, in Fantasy Faction, identified \\"a level of darkness in the book that would be surprising in a contemporary children‚Äôs novel ... one of the most unsettling sequences in the book occurs when the fleeing children are trapped inside the Morrigan‚Äôs giant thumbprint, a maze lined with nauseating blisters of sweat where nothing can live\\". Influence on other writers Several writers have given The Hounds of the Morrigan as one of their favourite books or noted that it influenced them: * Sarah Rees Brennan * Roshani Chokshi * Barry Hutchison * Kieran Larwood * Ruth Frances Long * Katy Moran * Emmet O‚ÄôCuana * Sin√©ad O‚ÄôHart * Laura Perry * Taya Okerlund * Robyn Young Sequel O'Shea was working on a sequel at the time of her death. In an obituary, David Fickling wrote; \\"The few brilliant chapters of the unfinished sequel are almost worth publishing alone: a Christmas card scene, candelit shop windows, carol singers and a robin... and into this cheerful scene rides the great Irish witch the Morrigan with her wild sisters, bringing mayhem and magic and mischief\\".

It was the first of the French posts built in the Ohio Country,Fort Presque Isle Historical Marker and was part of a line that included Fort Le Boeuf, Fort Machault, and Fort Duquesne. History The fort was built as part of the French military occupation of the Ohio Country; rival claims to the area by the British led to the French and Indian War. After the 1759 British victory at the Battle of Fort Niagara, the French burned the fort and retreated from the area. The British built a new Fort Presque Isle, which was captured by American Indians during Pontiac's Rebellion. On June 19, 1763, the fort was surrounded by about 250 Ottawas, Ojibwas, Wyandots, and Senecas. After holding out for two days, the garrison of approximately sixty men surrendered on the condition that they could return to Fort Pitt. Most were instead killed after emerging from the fort. Forts of 1753-54 General Anthony Wayne first arrived in the area of Presque Isle in 1786. In 1795, 200 Federal troops from Wayne's army, under the direction of Captain John Grubb, built a blockhouse on Garrison Hill, in present-day Erie, Pennsylvania. Also named Fort Presque Isle, the blockhouse was used as part of a defense against Native American uprisings. It was also used during the War of 1812. General Wayne was stricken ill at Fort Presque Isle and died there in 1796. At his request, his body was buried under the flagpole of the northwest blockhouse of the fort. This blockhouse burned in 1852. In 1880, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania reconstructed the blockhouse at Second and Ash Streets, Erie, as a memorial to General Wayne. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has recognized the reconstructed blockhouse as eligible for placement on the National Register of Historic Places. The blockhouse is located at N 42¬∞ 08.400, W 80¬∞ 04.463. References  Sources  * \\"The Frontier Forts of Western Pennsylvania,\\" Albert, George Dallas, C. M.

Much of the work appears to be an attempt to synthesize the earlier works of the 1st century astrologer Dorotheus of Sidon and the 2nd century astrologer Claudius Ptolemy. Hephaestion is seen mainly as one of the later compilers of the Hellenistic tradition of astrology since he mainly draws from earlier astrologers, including Antiochus of Athens, and he summarizes large portions of Ptolemy and Dorotheus, which is helpful to modern scholars since we have no other record of many of the authorities that he quotes. Hephaestion's intention appears to have been to reconcile the authoritative Ptolemaic tradition with the earlier practices represented by Dorotheus of Sidon. He wrote at a time and in a place (possibly Alexandria) when astrological ideas were being summarized and consolidated, after the removal of the capital of the Empire from Rome to Constantinople. His contemporaries included Paulus Alexandrinus (378 AD) and the anonymous author of the well-known Treatise on Fixed Stars (379 AD). Although influential on later Byzantine astrologers, his work seems to have had little impact in the Arab tradition which followed. The first two volumes of the Apotelesmatics have been translated into English (by Robert Schmidt of Project Hindsight); the third volume on Katarchic astrology (e.g., electional) is in preparation.

The most accepted theory is that one or more rogue waves hit M√ºnchen and damaged her, so that she drifted for 33 hours with a list of 50 degrees without electricity or propulsion. Early career MS M√ºnchen was launched on May 12, 1972 at the shipyards of Cockerill, Hoboken, Flanders, Belgium and delivered on September 22, 1972. M√ºnchen was a LASH ship and was the only ship of her kind under the German flag. She departed on her maiden voyage to the United States on October 19, 1972. Her sister ship MS Bilderdijk was built for the Holland America Line at the Boelwerf Temse Shipyard, also in Flanders, Belgium (Yard number 859). She sailed under the Dutch flag until 1986 when she was renamed Rhine Forest. This ship was retired from commercial operation on December 15, 2007. She has been scrapped in Bangladesh. Last voyage and search operations M√ºnchen departed the port of Bremerhaven on December 7, 1978, bound for Savannah, Georgia. This was her usual route, and she carried a cargo of steel products stored in 83 lighters and a crew of 28. She also carried a replacement nuclear reactor-vessel head for Combustion Engineering, Inc. This was her 62nd voyage, and took her across the North Atlantic, where a fierce storm had been raging since November. M√ºnchen had been designed to cope with such conditions, and carried on with her voyage. The exceptional flotation capabilities of the LASH carriers meant that she was widely regarded as being practically unsinkable. M√ºnchen was presumed to be proceeding smoothly, until the night of December 11/12. Between 00:05 and 00:07 (all times GMT) on December 12,M√ºnchens radio officer J√∂rg Ernst was overheard during a short radio communication on a \\"chat\\" frequency. He reported bad weather and some damage to M√ºnchen to his colleague Heinz L√∂hmann aboard , a German cruise ship away. Ernst also transmitted M√ºnchens last known position as . The quality of the transmission was bad, so that not everything was understood by L√∂hmann. Since it was a standard communication, the information was not relayed back to the ship's owner until December 17. =Distress call= Around three hours later (03:10-03:20), SOS calls were received by the Greek Panamax freighter Marion, which relayed it to the Soviet freighter Marya Yermolova and the German tug boat Titan. MS M√ºnchen gave her position as , which was probably around off her real position. The messages were transmitted via morse code and only parts of them were received. One fragment received was 50 degrees starboard, which could be interpreted as a 50-degree list to starboard. Automatic emergency signals were also received by multiple radio stations starting at 04:43. No further calls were recorded after 07:34, probably because US stations stopped listening on the frequency 2182 kHz. At 17:30 on December 12, international search and rescue operations were initiated and co-ordinated throughoutSMC Lands End by HM Coastguard at Land's End, Cornwall. Wind speeds of 11-12 Beaufort were reported in the area of the search, hampering efforts. The initial search requested by HMCG was by a Royal Air Force Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime reconnaissance aircraft, co- ordinated by SRCC RAF Mount Batten. =Initial search efforts and further communications= The next day, December 13, an additional Lockheed C-130 Hercules aircraft from Germany and six ships searched for M√ºnchen. At 09:06 Michael F. Sinnot, a Belgian radio amateur in Brussels, received a voice transmission on the unusual frequency 8238.4 kHz, which is usually used by a radio station at Norddeich in Germany. The transmission was clear but interrupted by some noise, and contained fragments of M√ºnchens name and callsign. Later in court, Sinnot reported that the voice was calm and spoke in English but with a distinct German accent. Since Sinnot only had a receiver for this frequency, he relayed the message via telex to a radio station in Ostend. Between 17:00 and 19:14, ten weak Mayday calls were received by the US Naval Station Rota, Spain at regular intervals, mentioning \\"28 persons on board\\". The messages may have been recorded and sent automatically. M√ºnchens call sign, 'DEAT', which was sent in Morse code, was received three times on the same frequency. The Dutch ocean-going salvage tug Smit Rotterdam, which was returning from other Mayday calls in the Gulf of Breton and the English Channel, received the calls as well and went to the designated position under the command of Captain PF de Nijs. Lands End CG provided the search planning and areas to be covered and appointed the salvage tug Smit Rotterdam as Onscene Commander co-ordinating the activities of eventually more than 100 ships and also the 16 aircraft taking based all now temporarily based in the Azores. =The search intensifies= On December 14 wind speeds dropped to Force 9. By now four aircraft and 17 ships were participating in the search operation. Signals of M√ºnchens emergency buoy were received. At 19:00 the British freighter King George picked up an empty life raft at . The same day, Hapag-Lloyd's freighter Erlangen found and identified three of M√ºnchens lighters. The following day, December 15, a British Nimrod patrol aircraft discovered two orange objects shaped like buoys at and the salvage tug Titan recovered a second life raft. A third one was located at the next day by MS Badenstein; all were empty. A yellow barrel was also sighted that day. On December 17, at 13:00 D√ºsseldorf Express salvaged M√ºnchens emergency buoy. By now wind speeds dropped to Force 3. The freighter Starlight found two life belts, at Sealand Consumer picked up a fourth empty life raft. Also three life vests were sighted, two of them by Starlight and another one by Evelyn. =The search is called off= The international search operation officially ended in the evening of December 20, a week after it had begun. The West German government and Hapag-Lloyd decided to search for two more days, with British and American forces supporting them. Altogether 13 aircraft from the United Kingdom, the United States, Portugal and Germany, and nearly 80 merchant and naval ships had searched for M√ºnchen or her crew. On February 16, the car transporter Don Carlos salvaged the damaged starboard-side lifeboat of M√ºnchen, the last object discovered from her. Investigation The subsequent investigation into the disappearance of M√ºnchen centred on the starboard lifeboat and in particular the forward block from which it had hung. The pins, which should have hung vertically, had been bent back from forward to aft, indicating the lifeboat hanging below it had been struck by a huge force, that had run from fore to aft of the ship, and had torn the lifeboat from its pins. The lifeboat normally hung above the waterline. With the existence of rogue waves then considered so statistically unlikely as to be near impossible, the investigation finally concluded that the severe weather had somehow created an 'unusual event' that had led to the sinking of M√ºnchen. As the science behind rogue waves was explored and more fully understood, it was accepted that not only did they exist, but that it was possible that they could occur in the deep ocean, such as in the North Atlantic. Investigators later returned to the question of M√ºnchen and considered the possibility that she had encountered a rogue wave in the storm that night. Whilst ploughing through the storm on the night of December 12, she was suddenly faced with a wall of water, between high, looming out of the dark. M√ºnchen would have plunged into the trough of the huge wave, and before she could rise out of it, it collapsed onto her, breaking across her bow and superstructure, tearing the starboard lifeboat out of its pins and likely smashing into the bridge, breaking the windows and flooding her. Having lost her bridge and steering, she would probably have lost her engines. Unable to maintain her heading into the storm, she would have been forced broadside into the waves. She seems to have floated for a number of hours, during which the storm and inaccurate positioning prevented her from being located. The force of the waves then hulled or even capsized her; another rogue wave may have contributed to her distress. She would then have succumbed to the flooding and sunk within a short period. Media coverage The loss of M√ºnchen was featured in an edition of the BBC documentary series Horizon entitled \\"Freak Wave,\\" which was first shown on November 14, 2002. In 2003, the Science Channel created a documentary entitled Killer Waves which studied the disappearance of M√ºnchen and concluded that a rogue wave was the most likely cause of her loss. Contribution to case law In 1981, the North Carolina Court of Appeals set a legal precedent that resulted from the loss of M√ºnchen. In Rheinberg-Kellerei GmbH v. Vineyard Wine Co. 281 S.E.2d 425 (N.C. Ct. App. 1981), the court heard that 620 cases of wine, destined for Wilmington, North Carolina, were lost when the ship foundered. Rheinberg-Kellerei GmbH, which had produced and sold the wine, sued its North Carolina wine distributor, Vineyard Wine Co., for the purchase price of the lost shipment. But the North Carolina Court of Appeals held that the German wine producer could not recover the purchase price. It decided the seller must bear the risk of loss when they fail to give \\"prompt notice\\" that the shipment has been dispatched (see FOB). Without \\"prompt notice\\" that the shipment has been sent, the buyer is denied the opportunity to protect their goods, for example by obtaining insurance, against the risk of any loss, damage or theft. This appellate case is used as an example in many U.S. legal textbooks to illustrate the administration of the Uniform Commercial Code.

He was known for working with Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie in the early development of bebop during the 1940s, and in the next decade had stint with bandleader Stan Kenton. Levey retired from music in the 1970s to work as a photographer. Biography Born Adolph Stanley Levey in Philadelphia, Levey is considered one of the earliest bebop drummers, and one of the very few white drummers involved in the formative years of bebop. He played in Philadelphia with Dizzy Gillespie's group in 1942, at the age of 16. Soon after, he went to New York City, where he and Gillespie worked on 52nd Street with Charlie Parker and Oscar Pettiford. After his tenure with the Stan Kenton Orchestra he moved to the West Coast in 1954, joining Howard Rumsey, Don Joham and the Lighthouse All-Stars, and was a major influence in West Coast jazz. Though \\"cool\\" jazz was common on the West Coast, Levey's crisp, melodic style continued to have more in common with bop than cool, and he inspired every group he ever played in. A right-handed person, Levey played the drums, as if left-handed. Levey has played on thousands of recordings, including those with musicians Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Stan Getz, Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and with bands such as that of Quincy Jones, and Skitch Henderson and The Tonight Show Band. Levey retired from the music business in 1973 to become a professional photographer. He died at age 79, two months after surgery for cancer of the jaw, in Van Nuys, California. He was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.

Although it is not strictly a public information film, it is often considered to be so by fans of the genre. It was broadcast in its entirety several times on television, but was so controversial that it was replaced less than two years later by the slightly less graphic Robbie. It won at least two creative awards: Certificate of Appreciation (Top Category) and Oberhausen Mention at the Festival of Youth Paris. The film was also shown in several schools by invitation. Plot The film begins with the voice-over of a headmaster telling children he knows that some have been playing on the railway, before cutting to a young boy sitting on a railway bridge wall. As the boy ponders on his thoughts, he pictures a school Sports Day-style event being held on the railway line. The rest of the film shows his imagined idea of what would happen, with children being split into four competitive teams to take part in different activities often carried out by young people trespassing on the railway. Four \\"games\\" are held, in which the children are challenged to break through the fence surrounding the railway line, play \\"chicken\\" with the trains and throw things at passing trains. Each time we see the tragic consequences of these activities, such as one scene where a driver and passenger are left badly injured by broken glass after a child throws a brick through the train window. The final task is for the children to run through a tunnel, but after they enter, we see a train approaching. Only four children cross the end of the tunnel, each of them injured terribly. One boy who crosses the finish line collapses as the overhead speaker announces the final results. The film finishes as a group of adults appear and go into the tunnel to carry out the bodies of the dead and injured children, which are then laid out in a long line along the railway track. The camera pans out to show all the dead and bloodied children along the track before returning to the boy sitting on the railway bridge wall, who seems to be reconsidering the idea. Filming The film was directed by John Krish, written by Krish and Michael Gilmour, and produced by James Ritchie. It was filmed in the vicinity of the then-closed Watton-at-Stone railway station, Hertfordshire. The bridge that the boy at the beginning and end of the film is sitting on is the southern side of the Station Rd railway bridge. The main filming area for the actors was located immediately southeast of the bridge sandwiched between Church Lane and the railway line. The \\"stone-throwing\\" competition was filmed immediately north of the railway bridge on the western side embankment where the AWS signal ramp is. The \\"Great Tunnel Walk\\" scene was filmed about 3.5 miles (5.63 km) south of the current Watton-at-Stone railway station. The \\"start\\" was at the northern portal and \\"finish\\" was at the southern one.

Around 1363 the abbey suffered so much from flooding that a new site was chosen and it was rebuilt further inland for its patron, Robert de Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk (1298-1369). However, there was a great fire in c. 1379 and further rebuilding was necessary. The house was suppressed in 1537.A.

The impressive remains of the second abbey stand in the fields to the west of the road going north out of Leiston towards Theberton. After the Abbey was closed the estate was granted to Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk. The Abbey became a farm, the farmhouse being built into the abbey walls. A Georgian frontage was added to the house, which was extended in the 1920s. In 1928 the ruins and farm were bought by Ellen Wrightson for use as a religious retreat. At her death in 1946 she bequeathed the house, ruins, land and buildings to the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich. It was purchased in 1977 to become the home of the Pro Corda Trust, a centre for the specialized education and training of chamber musicians.

Close ties existed between the two houses, and with the Augustinian nuns at Campsey Priory, a de Valoines foundation established shortly before 1195.

He sought advice from the abbot of Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire (a Premonstratensian house founded in 1140), who with the king's support visited Pr√©montr√© Abbey to obtain permission for Robert, abbot of Durford Abbey near Rogate, Sussex (founded from Welbeck after 1161), to transfer to Ranulf's abbey at Leiston. Robert borrowed canons from both Durford and Welbeck, apparently because Ranulf did not wish Leiston to owe any exaction to a senior house. One of these laid out the site over the course of two months.H.M.

The manor of Leiston was confirmed to the canons by Pope Lucius III, and royal confirmation of the foundation was granted early in 1185, at which time the abbey church was already built.

In 1351, by a special patent, the king confirmed that the Earl of Suffolk held the advowson of \\"the priory of Leystone, now called the abbey of Leystone\\" with the manor of Benhall (as formerly held by de Criol and de Ferre), even though it had not been mentioned specifically in the grant of reversion.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III Vol. IX: A.D. 1350-1354 (HMSO, London 1907), p. 75 (Internet archive). The later abbey Ground-plan of Leiston Abbey ruins made by Alfred Suckling (1848) In November 1362 the abbot and convent obtained royal licence to rebuild their abbey in a safer place. The existing buildings near the sea faced ruin, having been \\"destroyed and drowned by flooding of the sea\\", and could not be repaired because the foundations were compromised.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Edward III, Vol. XII: 1361-1364 (HMSO, London 1912), pp. 264-65 (Hathi Trust). Robert de Ufford was mindful of his family interest as a de Valoines (and de Pecche) descendant: his brother Ralph, of the third Ufford generation to serve as Justiciar of Ireland,T.F. Tout, 'Ufford, Robert de', Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), Vol. 58 (Wikisource). was buried at Campsey Priory in 1346. The site now occupied by the abbey ruins at Leiston was chosen (some two-and-a-half miles west of the other), the plan of a new and splendid abbey was laid out, and construction began. Earl Robert died in 1369, and was buried beside his countess at Campsey Priory.(Abstract of will of) 'Robert, Earl of Suffolk', N.H. Nicolas, Testamenta Vetusta Vol. I (Nicholas and Son, London 1826), pp. 73-74 (Internet archive).J.M.

Tout, 'Ufford, William de', Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), Vol. 58 (Wikisource). It was in or shortly before 1380 that, having been withdrawn from the ravages of the sea, the entire newly built monastery apart from its church was destroyed by fire, together with their corn and other goods. (Traces of this may be represented by areas of reddening in the surviving fabric.) The Abbot and convent were obliged to petition for a writ of supersedeas for distraint of the tenth, being thrown completely into debt and deprived of subsistence, and were granted this relief.Calendar of the Close Rolls, Richard II, Vol. I: 1377-1381 (HMSO, London 1914), p. 486 (Internet Archive). Whether this fire was a harbinger of the Peasants' Revolt in East Anglia in 1381, or the result of accidental causes, is not reported. William de Ufford was certainly vigorous in suppressing that destructive uprising, but died suddenly without heir in 1382 and was buried at Campsey Priory. In the wake of the fire the last major rebuilding took place: the Earl's will, written 12 June 1381, left 500 marks to Leiston Abbey.R.E.C. Waters, Genealogical Memoirs of the Extinct Family of Chester of Chicheley, 2 Vols. (Robson & Sons, London 1878), I, pp. 333-36 (Hathi Trust). Ruins of the chapter house, south transept and presbytery, from the south After escheat to the Crown, in 1385 the dignity and estates (including the advowson of Leiston Abbey) were bestowed upon Michael de la Pole, an intimate friend of King Richard II, who was accused of treason by the Lords Appellant in 1387 and fled into exile before February 1388. Having repossessed de la Pole's estates, in August 1388 King Richard confirmed to the abbot and convent all their existing rights and possessions, reinstating their right to elect their own superiors without reference to the king or any other patron, and granting immunity from the seizure of their possessions during any vacancy and from any obligation to pay a pension or corrody to anyone.Suckling, History and Antiquities of Suffolk, II, pp. 434-35 (Internet archive); Calendar of Patent Rolls, Richard II, A.D. 1385-1389 (HMSO, London 1900), p. 510 (Internet archive). The advowson was regranted to Michael de la Pole the younger in 1398.Calendar of Close Rolls of the Reign of Richard II, Vol. VI: 1396-1399 (HMSO, London 1927), p. 343. The plan of the ruins taken by Alfred Suckling in 1848 provides an outline of walls still surviving, which can be recognized in views made by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck (1738), Thomas Hearne (engraved 1781), Henry Davy and others. The \\"ritual east\\" of the monastery was orientated somewhat to the south-east geographically. Suckling's plan is described as \\"entirely inadequate\\" by Sir Alfred Clapham, whose studies of Premonstratensian architecture laid the basis of modern interpretation.A.W. Clapham, 'VI. The architecture of the Premonstratensians, with special reference to their buildings in England', Archaeologia LXXIII (1923), pp. 117-46, at p. 137-39 and Plate 21. =The ruins= Blind flushwork tracery on the east front of Leiston Abbey church The remains of the abbey church confirm that it survived the fire of 1380, and show that it was built on an impressive scale. It was laid out with an aisled nave, a central transept crossing supporting a tower, and a presbytery to the east with choir aisles serving as chapels both north (Our Lady) and south (St Michael). The proportions are indicated by the high north wall of the north transept containing the arch of a window 45 feet high, while the length of the church is estimated at 165 feet. The choir aisles, not occupying the full breadth of the transepts, opened into them by a single arch to the west and into the presbytery by two arches supported by columns or half-columns of octagonal section. Their separately pitched roofs are shown by gabled offsets on the east walls of the transepts. Their altar-spaces and eastern walls were closed from the presbytery, which extended beyond by a single bay where the altar was lit by tall arched windows on either side and by a great east window. The south aisle wall (exterior), from the cloister. Externally the east wall and buttresses were embellished with flint flushwork in emergent Perpendicular style, while the offsets of stone tracery in the window-arches of the north transept and Lady chapel indicate curvilinear designs now lost. The piers of the eastern arch of the crossing survive to some height, but without their facing-stones. However fragments of the capital on the north side are of late Norman style, suggesting to Sir William St John Hope that the abbey had never been moved,W. St J. Hope, 'Observations at Leiston Abbey (23 June 1890)', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology VII Part 2 (1890), pp. 227-28 (Suffolk Institute pdf). and to Sir Alfred Clapham (more probably) that piers from the original church had been reconstructed in the new location. The internal structure of the nave, with its arcades and clerestory, is gone, but the outer walls, much patched, show on the south (cloister) side how the large arched windows of the south aisle, broadly spaced, rose up from the string course marking the roofline of the cloister walk. The Refectory, looking west The cloister wall on the east side shows the openings of the sacristy, the chapter house and (possibly) the infirmary, but the dormitory which ran above it and the body of the main structure is gone. This range extended further away to the south, towards the reredorter, two walls of which are standing. The full extent of the cloister south range is occupied by the walls of the Refectory, a high hall lit principally by a very tall west window, its arch still dominating that corner of the site. Standing walls from the ground storey of the western range, which probably included the cellarer's quarters, complete the enclosure of the cloister, rising towards the western end of the church nave. The main external entrance to the cloister ran through this building, and in around 1500 a tall brick gatehouse with two octagonal turrets was added, one side of which still remains.e.g., J.G. Fairclough, in 'Excursions 2003', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology XL Part 4 (2004), pp. 525-38, at pp. 533-34. At the north-western corner of the complex, a former farmhouse with a brick regency front represents the western limit of the church nave, an early timber house stands longways behind it occupying the former south aisle of the church, and a tall more recent building stands within the cloister yard itself. The Guest hall is not shown by Suckling, but partially survives in buildings standing apart at the north-west corner of the site.  Archaeological investigations  The north transept, from the south transept The Lady chapel was preserved by use as a roofed farm building during the 18th century, and was re-thatched as a place of worship during the 20th century. Excavations during the 1980s established the position of the lost south wall and turret of the brick entrance-gate structure, and explored the interior of the reredorter building. In a separate investigation, the interior of the presumed abbey Guest Hall was excavated. Two long upstanding medieval walls had survived: they are incorporated into a new structure for the use of Pro Corda.W. Filmer-Sankey, in E.A. Martin, J. Plouviez and H. Feldman, 'Archaeology in Suffolk 1985', Proceedings of the Suffolk Institute of Archaeology XXXVI Part 2 (1986), pp. 139-56, at p. 152. See also Vol. XXXVII, Part 3 (1991), p. 273.

In 2015 the project entered the third year of five proposed digging seasons under a licence granted by English Heritage. Its aim was to breathe new life into the Abbey, to provide opportunities for visitors to participate in the excavation work, and to integrate the historic site with the artistic and musical life of the Pro Corda music school. Fieldwork sought to characterize undefined earthworks and occupation evidence in three different areas of the site. Remote sensing was used to target thirteen small-scale excavation trenches: these were to locate and explore features indicated by geophysical anomalies or existing earthworks. A photogrammetry survey was conducted to produce a metrically accurate, three-dimensional digital elevation model of the Abbey Church. Low- level aerial photographic surveying, employing kite-mounted cameras and UAVs (drones), was carried out to assess structural evidence for buildings which may have formed an outer eastern range.

Brooks had earlier played first class cricket for NSW.AAP via Sydney Morning Herald, \\"Former cricket umpire Tom Brooks dies\\" 16 July 2007 First Class playing career New South Wales, between 1946/47 and 1952/53 seasons, taking 65 wickets at an average of 22.50, and scoring 192 runs at 16.00. Jack Pollard described him as a \\"spirited\\" bowler \\"who moved the ball appreciably in the air. He played first with the Waverley club but later with the Manly club. International Umpiring career He umpired 23 Test matches between 1970 and 1978. His first match was between Australia and England at Brisbane on 27 November to 2 December 1970, a drawn match in which Keith Stackpole scored 207 and Doug Walters a century. Brooks' partner was Lou Rowan. He was appointed to umpire what would have been the third of that series, with Rowan, which was scheduled for Melbourne, but the test was abandoned without a ball bowled. Notwithstanding that Brooks and Rowan were required to make decisions on several occasions during the first three days scheduled for play, relating to the possibility of play following any number of inspections of pitch and surrounds, the International Cricket Council (I.C.C.) decided that the test could not be recognised as such. A 40-over match was played in place of the test and was won by Australia by 5 wickets. Brooks (and Rowan) thus became the first umpires to stand in a One Day International match. Brooks stood in one other ODI, in 1975. =Snow-Jenner Incident= The last Test match of the 1970/71 series, at Sydney on 12 to 17 February 1971, was a dramatic game won by England by 62 runs to regain the Ashes. In this match captain Ray Illingworth led the English players from the field following a crowd disturbance after fast bowler John Snow had hit Australian lower-order batsman Terry Jenner on the head with a bouncer. Brooks' colleague Lou Rowan had issued Snow with a warning for intimidatory bowling and Snow's and Illingworth's displeasure was clear to the crowd who booed passionately. When Snow finished his over and moved to his fielding position on the boundary, he was grabbed by a spectator, and had beer-cans thrown at him. Following the English walk-off, Illingworth was advised by the umpires either to resume or forfeit the match, and the players returned after the ground was cleared. =World XI= In 1971/72 season, a scheduled tour of Australia by South Africa was cancelled following political and moral protests against the apartheid policies of the South African government. In its place a 'World Team' visited Australia and played a series of matches against Australia, which although first class, were never officially recognised as Test matches. Brooks stood in three of those matches. =Centenary Test= Brooks stood, with Max O'Connell in the Centenary Test Match between Australia and England, played at Melbourne on 12 to 17 March 1977, won by Australia by 45 runs ‚Äì identical to the result of the first Test 100 years before. Dennis Lillee took 11 wickets, Rod Marsh finally achieved a century against England, debutant David Hookes hit English captain Tony Greig for five consecutive fours, Rick McCosker batted with a broken jaw, and Derek Randall scored a gallant 174, in a memorable match, attended by many of the past great names of Australian and English cricket. =Last Test match= Brooks' last Test match was between Australia and England at Perth from 15 to 20 December 1978, won by England by 166 runs, in spite of 10 wickets in the match to Rodney Hogg. Brooks' colleague was Robin Bailhache. Brooks made a few dubious decisions, and said later that he felt during the match that he was no longer umpiring at his best, and that he would rather be watching than umpiring. He retired from Test umpiring immediately after the match ended.Barry Nicholls, The Establishment Boys, New Holland, Sydney, 2015, pp. 157‚Äì58. It was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald (Mossop) and the Adelaide Advertiser (Coward), that he admitted that his nerve had cracked in the match. This was never said in any form and following legal representation a retraction was later printed by the Sydney Morning Herald, on the basis that its report had been obtained from a source found not to be trustworthy. The Adelaide Advertiser provided both a published and private apology. Career Summary/Honours He officiated 95 first-class matches in his career between 1967 and 1979. In 1977 he stood for a full season in the English County Championship and on the basis of points allocated out of ten per match by the various county captains relating to performance, there were only 5 (out of 28) first class umpires who accumulated more.

The 24 members of the genus are mostly colourful birds, conspicuously barred in black and white, with some red and yellow. Taxonomy The genus Melanerpes was introduced by the English ornithologist William John Swainson in 1832 to accommodate the red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus). The title page gives the date as 1831 but the volume was not actually published until the following year. The generic name combines the Ancient Greek melas meaning \\"black\\" with herpƒìs meaning \\"creeper\\". The genus forms part of the large tribe Melanerpini, which also includes the North American sapsuckers in the genus Sphyrapicus and the monotypic genus Xiphidiopicus containing only the Cuban green woodpecker (Xiphidiopicus percussus). Characteristics Members of Melanerpes are small to medium-sized woodpeckers found exclusively in the New World. Some are West Indian endemics, and include species from Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and Guadeloupe; one subspecies, the Grand Bahama West Indian woodpecker (M. superciliaris bahamensis) became extinct in the 1950s. The majority of the species are from Central and South America. Most species are boldly marked in black and white, with some areas of red and yellow. The beaks are long and pointed, and sometimes curved. The sexes differ in many species, both in colour and in size. Some species such as the acorn woodpecker and the yellow-tufted woodpecker are sociable, foraging in groups, communicating vocally and nesting communally. These have complex breeding systems including some non-breeding adult helpers assisting in rearing the young. Like other woodpeckers, insects form a large part of the diet, being caught on the wing in some species, but fruit is also eaten in large quantities and some species consume sap. They all nest in holes that they excavate in trees, and the red-crowned woodpecker and the Hoffmann's woodpecker are unusual in that they sometimes enter their holes backwards. Species The genus includes 24 species: * White woodpecker, Melanerpes candidus * Lewis's woodpecker, Melanerpes lewis * Guadeloupe woodpecker, Melanerpes herminieri * Puerto Rican woodpecker, Melanerpes portoricensis * Red-headed woodpecker, Melanerpes erythrocephalus * Acorn woodpecker, Melanerpes formicivorus * Yellow-tufted woodpecker, Melanerpes cruentatus * Yellow-fronted woodpecker, Melanerpes flavifrons * Golden-naped woodpecker, Melanerpes chrysauchen * Beautiful woodpecker, Melanerpes pulcher * Black-cheeked woodpecker, Melanerpes pucherani * White-fronted woodpecker, Melanerpes cactorum * Hispaniolan woodpecker, Melanerpes striatus * Jamaican woodpecker, Melanerpes radiolatus * Golden-cheeked woodpecker, Melanerpes chrysogenys * Grey-breasted woodpecker, Melanerpes hypopolius * Yucatan woodpecker, Melanerpes pygmaeus * Red-crowned woodpecker, Melanerpes rubricapillus * Gila woodpecker, Melanerpes uropygialis * Hoffmann's woodpecker, Melanerpes hoffmannii * Golden-fronted woodpecker, Melanerpes aurifrons * Velasquez's woodpecker, Melanerpes santacruzi * Red-bellied woodpecker, Melanerpes carolinus * West Indian woodpecker, Melanerpes superciliaris ** Grand Bahama West Indian woodpecker, Melanerpes superciliaris bahamensis (extinct: 1950s) References  External links  * Melanerpes Category:Dendropicini Category:Bird genera * Category:Taxa named by William John Swainson ","title":"Melanerpes"},{"id":"3611925","text":"The South Carolina State House is the building housing the government of the U.S. state of South Carolina, which includes the South Carolina General Assembly and the offices of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina. Located in the capital city of Columbia near the corner of Gervais and Assembly Streets, the building also housed the Supreme Court until 1971. The State House is in the Classical Revival style; it is approximately tall, long, wide. It weighs more than and has of space. Old Carolina State House The old State House was constructed between 1786 and 1790. James Hoban, a young Irishman who emigrated to Charleston shortly after the Revolution, was the architect. Upon the recommendation of Henry Laurens, President Washington engaged him to design the executive mansion in Washington. Old pictures of the two buildings show architectural similarities.Statehouse history The Old State House was destroyed during the burning of Columbia in 1865. Historic photos Architecture Example of one of the six bronze stars, marking the spots hit by Sherman's cannons View of inside the dome inside the main lobby Statehouse underground facility The South Carolina State House was designed first by architect P. H. Hammarskold. Construction began in 1851, but the original architect was dismissed for fraud and dereliction of duty. Soon thereafter, the structure was largely dismantled because of defective materials and workmanship. John Niernsee redesigned the structure and work began on it in 1855, slowed during the Civil War, and was suspended in 1865 as General W.T. Sherman's U.S. Army entered Columbia on February 17. Several public buildings were \\"put to the torch\\" when United States troops entered the city. The new capitol building, still under construction, was damaged by artillery shells. The old capitol building was set afire by U.S. Army troops under Sherman's command. Reconstruction-era poverty slowed progress. The building's main structure was finally completed in 1875. From 1888 to 1891, Niernsee's son, Frank McHenry Niernsee, served as architect and much of the interior work was completed. In 1900 Frank Pierce Milburn began as architect, but was replaced in 1905 by Charles Coker Wilson who finally finished the exterior in 1907. Additional renovations were made in 1959 and 1998.

Statehouse grounds from the South The building's grounds are home to several monuments. On the north side, leading to the main entry, is the Confederate Monument which included a flagpole flying a traditional version of the Confederate battle flag until it was removed on July 10, 2015 by State Bill.Exterior Features of the State House The monument was established after a controversy during the state's 2000 presidential primary about the Confederate flag flying over the dome of the State House. The flag was originally placed over the dome in 1962 by a concurrent resolution of the state legislature during the commemoration of the Civil War centennial. The resolution failed to designate a time for its removal.\\"Journal of the House of Representatives of the Second Session of the 94th General Assembly of the State of South Carolina.\\" Confederate Flag Vertical File, South Carolina Political Collections, University of South Carolina. The flag was moved near the monument on July 1, 2000, after passage of the South Carolina Heritage Act of 2000. It was then removed from the grounds on July 10, 2015, by order of Republican governor Nikki Haley, and given to the South Carolina Confederate Relic Room & Military Museum.Bill 4895, South Carolina General Assembly, 113th Session, 1999-2000 On the east side is the African-American History Monument, authorized by Act 457 of the General Assembly and unveiled on March 26, 2001.African American History Monument The State House viewed from the south.

For most historical linguists there is no separate field of paleolinguistics. Those who use the term are generally advocates of hypotheses not generally accepted by mainstream historical linguists, a group colloquially referred to as \\"long-rangers\\".  Background  The controversial hypotheses in question fall into two categories. Some of them involve the application of standard historical linguistic methodology in ways that raise doubts as to the validity of the hypothesis. A good example of this sort is the Moscow school of Nostraticists, founded by Vladislav Illich- Svitych and including Aharon Dolgopolsky, Sergei Starostin, and Vitaly Shevoroshkin, who have argued for the existence of Nostratic, a language family including the Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, Altaic, Dravidian, and Kartvelian language families and sometimes other languages. They have established regular phonological correspondences, observed morphological similarities, and reconstructed a proto-language in accordance with the accepted methodology. Nostratic is not generally accepted, in part because critics have doubts about the accuracy of the correspondences and reconstruction. Other hypotheses are controversial because the methods used to support them are considered by mainstream historical linguists to be invalid in principle. Into that category fall proposals based on mass comparison, a technique in which relationships are postulated on basis of sets of words resembling each other in sound and meaning, without establishing phonological correspondences or carrying out a reconstruction. Prominent examples are the work of Joseph Greenberg and Merritt Ruhlen. Most linguists reject that method as unable to distinguish similarities from common ancestry from those from borrowing or chance.  Paleolinguists  Other linguists who may be considered paleolinguists due to their advocacy of long-range hypotheses include: John Bengtson, Knut Bergsland, Derek Bickerton, V√°clav Bla≈æek, Robert Caldwell, Matthias Castr√©n, Bj√∂rn Collinder, Albert Cuny, Igor Diakonov, Vladimir Dybo, Harold Fleming, Eugene Helimski, Otto Jespersen, Frederik Kortlandt, Samuel E.

Lyman Briggs College addresses the modern dilemma described by C. P. Snow's \\"Two Cultures\\" by educating STEM students in the natural sciences as well as the humanities and social sciences, effectively attempting to create a curriculum of \\"liberal sciences.\\" Science classes offered by LBC include chemistry, biology, physics, and math, and classes in the history, philosophy, and sociology of science. All of these classes reveal science's relationship with society, literature, history, and philosophy. Smaller class sizes allow for more interaction with professors, and LBC professors are leaders in discipline-based education research (DBER) and the scholarship of teaching and learning (SOTL). Lyman Briggs College is located in Holmes Hall (named for founder John Clough Holmes), the largest residence hall on campus. Many of the over 1250 students in the residence hall are members of LBC. Many of the students in the Lyman Briggs program intend to pursue careers in medicine, but there are a variety of other programs that are supported by Lyman Briggs. In all, there are over 30 coordinate majors, from human biology to computer sciences. LBC also has the unique distinction of being one of the few major schools to allow undergraduate students to assist in the classroom as \\"Learning Assistants.\\" Learning Assistants run supervised recitations and labs in chemistry, biology, math, and physics. Lyman Briggs College was made a school (i.e., a sub-unit) of the College of Natural Sciences in 1981 when the university was experiencing significant financial stress, with a name change to Lyman Briggs School of Science. In 2007, the school went through the formal process of regaining its status as a residential college, \\"in time for the school's 40th anniversary in the fall [of 2007].\\" The proposal to change its status was unanimously approved by the Faculty Council on April 10, 2007, presented to the Academic Council on April 17, 2007, and approved by the MSU Board of Trustees on June 15, 2007. The school's director, Elizabeth H. Simmons, was appointed dean and served through academic year 2016-2017. Mark Largent served as interim dean for academic year 2017-2018. Michele H. Jackson was appointed Dean on June 22, 2018. LBC partners with the James Madison College (JMC) and the MSU Department of Fisheries and Wildlife in the Science, Technology, Environment, and Public Policy specialization, which is based in JMC and offers a minor. LBC also partners with MSU's College of Arts and Letters to host the Bioethics minor. Relation to other MSU residential colleges The James Madison College at Michigan State University was founded in the same year on the same principle of residential college, but in the area of public policy, political theory, and the liberal arts. Madison and Briggs Colleges collaborate with the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife in offering an undergraduate specialization in Science, Technology, the Environment, and Public Policy (STEPPS). Students in the two colleges enjoy friendly competition through the annual fall Canoe Race and spring Olympics. In fall 2007, Michigan State opened a new Residential College in the Arts and Humanities.

Selected in the 29th round of the June 1982 MLB Amateur Draft, Hamilton eventually saw success as a member of the Pacific Coast League Albuquerque Dukes, batting over .320 over the course of two seasons before being called up to make his Major League Baseball debut on June 28, 1986. He was called up several times thereafter before becoming the Dodgers' full-time Third Baseman at the start of the 1989 season. After a successful 1989 campaign, Hamilton began 1990 as the Dodgers starting third basemen. But after playing with a sore shoulder in spring training, Hamilton was shelved in early April after it was discovered he had torn his rotator cuff - which eventually required season-ending surgery. Hamilton ended up only playing in 7 games for the entire 1990 season. Hamilton played portions of six seasons during his career, all with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Hamilton was a member of the Dodgers team that won the World Series in 1988 and was featured on the cover of the October 31st 1988 edition of Sports Illustrated. In 1989, he was sixth in the National League in doubles with 35 and led the NL in putouts by a Third Baseman with 139. He played his final MLB game on September 28, 1991, later retiring after a short return to the Albuquerque Dukes in 1992. Although he was a position player throughout his entire career, he did appear in a ballgame in 1989 as a relief pitcher during a 22-inning ballgame against the Houston Astros.

Endemic to the upper Sacramento- San Joaquin Estuary of California, it mainly inhabits the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone of the estuary, except during its spawning season, when it migrates upstream to fresh water following winter \\"first flush\\" flow events (around March to May).Sommer, T. et al. 2011. The spawning migration of delta smelt in the Upper San Francisco Estuary. San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science: 9(2). It functions as an indicator species for the overall health of the Delta's ecosystem. Because of its one-year lifecycle and relatively low fecundity, it is very susceptible to changes in the environmental conditions of its native habitat.Moyle, PB. 2002. Inland fishes of California. University of California Press, Berkeley. Efforts to protect the endangered fish from further decline have focused on limiting or modifying the large-scale pumping activities of state and federal water projects at the southern end of the estuary, thereby limiting water available to farming. However, these efforts have not prevented the species from becoming functionally extinct in the wild. Taxonomy and evolution The delta smelt is one of five currently recognized species within the genus Hypomesus, which is part of the larger smelt family, Osmeridae. The genus has been subject to many revisions since it was first classified by Gill in 1863. The first major revision occurred in 1963, when the family Osmeridae was re-examined by Canadian ichthyologist Donald Evan McAllister. Expanding on Japanese researcher Hamada's earlier determination that H. olidus was not a monolithic widespread species, but rather one of three distinct species of Hypomesus, McAllister assigned them new names, and further delineated what he believed were four subspecies. This was the first description of H. transpacificus, named for its supposed occurrence on both sides of the Pacific, and also \\"to the friendship of Japanese and Canadian ichthyologists.\\" He separated these geographically isolated populations into separate subspecies: H. t. transpacificus and H. t. nipponensis. Modern analysis of the genus would elevate all of McAllister's subspecies to full species status, based on fin ray counts and the number of chromatophores between their mandibles, a change which genetic analysis has supported. In fact, genetic analysis would conclude that despite their morphological similarities, H. nipponensis and H. transpacificus are actually members of different phylogenetic clades. The abbreviated distribution of Hypomesus species along both the east and west sides of the Pacific Ocean suggests that their common ancestor had a range that would have crossed the Pacific. Researchers have hypothesized that climatic changes may have reduced the range of the ancestral species during cooling periods, which would have created a reproductive barrier, allowing speciation to occur. Although the low number of species in the genus and high levels of homoplasy have frustrated attempts to determine whether the northern Pacific H. olidus or H. nipponensis are the basal species of Hypomesus, the most recent speciation event in Hypomesus is known to have been between the two native east Pacific species, H. pretiosus and H. transpacificus. This is plausibly due to a geographic isolation of a widespread eastern Pacific ancestor, of which some members were isolated in a freshwater basin in western California, possibly in the lakes that would have been located in the southern San Joaquin Valley during the Pleistocene epoch.  Habitat  The delta smelt is endemic to the Sacramento‚ÄìSan Joaquin River Delta in California, where it is distributed from the Suisun Bay upstream through the delta in Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Solano Counties. The delta smelt is a pelagic (lives in the open water column away from the bottom) and euryhaline species (tolerant of a wide salinity range). It has been collected from estuarine waters with salinities up to 14 parts per thousand. Historically, delta smelt were distributed from San Pablo Bay upstream to Sacramento on the Sacramento River and Mossdale on the San Joaquin River, which varied seasonally and with freshwater outflow.Radtke, LD (1966) Distribution of smelt, juvenile sturgeon and starry flounder in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In: Fish bulletin. California Department of Fish and Game, Sacramento, pp 115‚Äì129 Today, large areas of historic delta smelt habitat and designated critical habitat have become unsuitable for some life history stages of the species, though key environmental characteristics (e.g. temperature, salinity, water depth) of these areas have not changed.CDFG (2003) Comment letter on the five-year status review of the delta smelt.

Center for Biological Diversity, Bay Institute, & Natural Resources Defense Council. Delta smelt disappeared from the southern portion of their historic habitat in the late 1970s, which coincides with substantial increases in the amounts of water exported from the delta. Water export operations likely have a great effect on the distribution, abundance, and genetic diversity of delta smelt.Bennett, WA (2005) Critical assessment of the delta smelt population in the San Francisco Estuary, California. San Francisco Estuary Watershed Sci 3:1‚Äì71.  Lifecycle  The delta smelt is semelparous, living one year and dying after its first spawning. Their spawning occurs in spring in river channels and tidally influenced backwater sloughs upstream of the mixing zone where salt water meets fresh water. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers then transport the delta smelt larvae downstream to the mixing zone, normally located in the Suisun Bay. Young delta smelt then feed and grow in the mixing zone before starting their upstream spawning migration in late fall or early winter. The delta smelt is preyed upon by larger fish, especially striped bass and largemouth bass, which are introduced species in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.  Endangered status  Historically, delta smelt were relatively abundant in the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary, with populations declining dramatically in the 1980s.Newman KB (2008) Sample design-based methodology for estimating delta smelt abundance. San Francisco Estuary Watershed Sci 6:1‚Äì18. They were listed as threatened by both federal and state governments in 1993, and sustained record-low abundance indices, prompted their listing as endangered under the California Endangered Species Act in 2010.CDFG (2010) State & federally listed endangered & threatened animals of California. California Department of Fish & Game,State of California, The Natural Resources Agency, California.Federal Register 58:12863; March 5, 1993 Critical habitat was listed for delta smelt on December 19, 1994.Federal Register 59:65256 Delta smelt are threatened with extinction due to anthropogenic alterations to their ecosystem, including urbanization, non-native species, water diversions, contaminants, and the conversion of complex tidal habitats to leveed channels.Nichols FH, Cloern JE, Luoma SN, Peterson DH (1986) The modification of an estuary. Science 231:567‚Äì573. A survey in April 2015 found only one individual delta smelt. Although the fish is almost extinct in the wild, extant populations remain in a captive-breeding program at UC Davis and in a fish hatchery operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service near Shasta Dam. Court protection In 2005, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) issued a biological opinion that the Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project were not having an adverse effect on the recovery of the delta smelt. The Natural Resources Defense Council sued, and in 2007, Fresno U.S. District Court Judge Oliver Wanger found the biological opinion was arbitrary and capricious and ordered protections for the delta smelt while the document was redone.Natural Resources Defense Council v. Kempthorne, 506 F. Supp. 2d 322 (E.D. Cal. 2007). In 2008, at the close of the court's deadline, the FWS issued a new biological opinion.http://www.fws.gov/sfbaydelta/cvp-swp/cvp-swp.cfm This time, the FWS came to the opposite of its earlier conclusion, finding the water projects were jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt. When six new plaintiffs sued, Judge Wanger preliminarily ordered the FWS to give him weekly justifications of delta flow restrictions and appointed four scientists as his own expert witnesses.

The station is owned by Univision Communications along with KLNV. It forms as a part of the Uforia Audio Network. History The station signed on in 1963 as KBBW and was owned by the Bible Institute of Los Angeles. While the application had been filed in 1959, several changes, including a callsign change and a frequency change from the original 102.5 MHz, had occurred before the station went on air. In 1970, the Bible Institute, then doing business as Biola Schools and Colleges, sold KBBW and sister station KBBI in Los Angeles to PSA Broadcasting, a subsidiary of San Diego-based Pacific Southwest Airlines, for $1.15 million. PSA changed KBBW's callsign to KPSE, then to KEZL in 1974. The company operated four stations in California, all with easy listening formats. In 1984, KEZL dropped easy listening to become Top 40-formatted KSDO-FM, known on air as \\"KS103\\". Several different formats followed in the late 1980s and 1990s. On September 25, 1987, the station was renamed KSWV and began a two-year stint with a smooth jazz format known as \\"The Wave\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-10-02.pdf On August 31, 1989, the station flipped to classic rock as KSDO-FM (\\"Classic 103\\"), changing call letters to KCLX in March 1992; this format lasted until April 1995.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1989/RR-1989-09-01.pdf The classic rock format was then changed to 70s Hits and later a Soft AC format as KKBH (\\"The Beach\\"), followed by adult contemporary with the branding \\"Mix 102.9\\".http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1995/RR-1995-04-21.pdf In the fall of 1997, after market research showed some ratings reporters still wrote KJQY in their diaries, \\"K-Joy\\" was launched on 102.9 FM, marking the return of the callsign that had formerly existed on 103.7. Jacor, which owned KJQY along with other stations, bought Nationwide Broadcasting, which owned additional stations in the San Diego radio market, in 1997. The combination of the two clusters necessitated a sale to stay under FCC ownership limits. Jacor shed KJQY, along with KKLQ at 106.5, to Heftel Broadcasting, a forerunner to today's Univision Radio, and moved the KJQY calls and format to 94.1 MHz. Heftel, an operator of primarily Spanish- language radio stations, set up shop in San Diego, changing the station's calls to KLQV after 11 days with a placeholder callsign. After a stint as \\"K-Love 102.9\\" (no relation to the Christian radio network of the same name and, coincidentally, a name used by Los Angeles sister station KLVE, the station rebranded as \\"Viva 102.9\\" in 2004. In early 2006, prompted by the flip of XHOCL-FM to Spanish oldies, KLQV flipped to the format as well to provide competition. The move resulted in an immediate ratings boost; after the station rated a 1.0 in the fall 2005 Arbitron ratings, the number soared to 3.4, making it the #1 rated Spanish language radio station in the San Diego radio market. In April 2014, KLQV switched to Spanish Adult Hits as 102.9 FM M√°s Variedad. On February 6, 2018, Univision dropped the \\"M√°s Variedad\\" Spanish Adult Hits format and switched it to Spanish AC as Amor 102.9. Although the music and radio shows are syndicated and heard from KBRG in San Jose and KOMR in Phoenix simultaneously, which also carries the Amor format. The ‚ÄúAmor‚Äù stations are similar to KLVE in Los Angeles which is one of the most listened Spanish language radio stations in the United States. In March 2019, Univision placed all their stations into their new Uforia Audio Network, The station joined Uforia on March 15.

When one gene goes through a selective sweep, any other nearby polymorphisms that are in linkage disequilibrium will tend to change their allele frequencies too.Futuyma, Douglas J. 2013. Evolution: Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc: Sunderland, MA. Selective sweeps happen when newly appeared (and hence still rare) mutations are advantageous and increase in frequency. Neutral or even slightly deleterious alleles that happen to be close by on the chromosome 'hitchhike' along with the sweep. In contrast, effects on a neutral locus due to linkage disequilibrium with newly appeared deleterious mutations are called background selection. Both genetic hitchhiking and background selection are stochastic (random) evolutionary forces, like genetic drift. History Although the term hitchhiking was coined in 1974 by Maynard Smith and John Haigh, the phenomenon it refers to remained little studied until the work of John H. Gillespie in 2000. Outcomes Hitchhiking occurs when a neutral polymorphism is in linkage disequilibrium with a second locus that is undergoing a selective sweep. The neutral allele that is linked to the adaptation will increase in frequency, in some cases until it becomes fixed in the population. The other neutral allele, which is linked to the non- advantageous version, will decrease in frequency, in some cases until extinction. Overall, hitchhiking reduces the amount of genetic variation. Deleterious \\"passenger\\" mutations can also hitchhike, not just neutral mutations. Recombination can interrupt the process of genetic hitchhiking, ending it before the hitchhiking neutral or deleterious allele becomes fixed or goes extinct. The closer a hitchhiking polymorphism is to the gene under selection, the less opportunity there is for recombination to occur. This leads to a reduction in genetic variation near a selective sweep that is greater closer to the selected site. This pattern is useful for using population data to detect selective sweeps, and hence to detect which genes have been under very recent selection. Draft versus drift Both genetic drift and genetic draft are random evolutionary processes, i.e. they act stochastically and in a way that is not correlated with selection at the gene in question. Drift is the change in the frequency of an allele in a population due to random sampling in each generation. Draft is the change in the frequency of an allele due to the randomness of what other non-neutral alleles it happens to be found in association with. Assuming genetic drift is the only evolutionary force acting on an allele, after one generation in many replicated idealised populations each of size N, each starting with allele frequencies of p and q, the newly added variance in allele frequency across those populations (i.e. the degree of randomness of the outcome) is \\\\frac{pq}{2N} . This equation shows that the effect of genetic drift is heavily dependent on population size, defined as the actual number of individuals in an idealised population. Genetic draft results in similar behavior to the equation above, but with an effective population size that may have no relationship to the actual number of individuals in the population. Instead, the effective population size may depend on factors such as the recombination rate and the frequency and strength of beneficial mutations. The increase in variance between replicate populations due to drift is independent, whereas with draft it is autocorrelated, i.e. if an allele frequency goes up because of genetic drift, that contains no information about the next generation, whereas if it goes up because of genetic draft, it is more likely to go up than down in the next generation. Genetic draft generates a different allele frequency spectrum to genetic drift. Applications =Sex chromosomes= The Y chromosome does not undergo recombination, making it particularly prone to the fixation of deleterious mutations via hitchhiking. This has been proposed as an explanation as to why there are so few functional genes on the Y chromosome. =Mutator evolution= Hitchhiking is necessary for the evolution of higher mutation rates to be favored by natural selection on evolvability. A hypothetical mutator M increases the general mutation rate in the area around it. Due to the increased mutation rate, the nearby A allele may be mutated into a new, advantageous allele, A* \\\\--M------A-- -> --M------A*-- The individual in which this chromosome lies will now have a selective advantage over other individuals of this species, so the allele A* will spread through the population by the normal processes of natural selection. M, due to its proximity to A*, will be dragged through into the general population. This process only works when M is very close to the allele it has mutated. A greater distance would increase the chance of recombination separating M from A*, leaving M alone with any deleterious mutations it may have caused. For this reason, evolution of mutators is generally expected to happen largely in asexual species where recombination cannot disrupt linkage disequilibrium. =Neutral theory of molecular evolution= The neutral theory of molecular evolution assumes that most new mutations are either deleterious (and quickly purged by selection) or else neutral, with very few being adaptive. It also assumes that the behavior of neutral allele frequencies can be described by the mathematics of genetic drift. Genetic hitchhiking has therefore been viewed as a major challenge to neutral theory, and an explanation for why genome-wide versions of the McDonald-Kreitman test appear to indicate a high proportion of mutations becoming fixed for reasons connected to selection.

History 106.5 FM started as KPRI in 1960 and broadcast an MOR-Easy Listening format with the slogan \\"Island of Capri\\" (K-PRI) ; Beginning in December 1967, it began airing a freeform format in the overnight hours (Midnight to 3:00 AM), which would become full-time by June 1968, and would later evolve into album-oriented rock by 1973. In January 1984, the station flipped to an Adult Contemporary format as KLZZ, \\"Class FM.\\" KLZZ switched formats once again in September 1986, to classic rock as \\"California Classics\\", retaining the KLZZ callsign. On March 5, 1987, at 6 p.m., after KLZZ was purchased by Edens Broadcasting, KLZZ flipped to a dance-leaning Top 40 format, branded as \\"Q106\\" and adopted the KKLQ call letters. The first song on \\"Q106\\" was \\"Sign o' the Times\\" by Prince.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1987/RR-1987-03-13.pdf KKLQ was also heard on KOGO, 600 AM, as part of a simulcast, and later on now-Talk formatted KCBQ. Q106 was co-owned with KKBQ (93Q) in Houston, Texas, KOY-FM (Y95) in Phoenix, Arizona, WRBQ-FM (Q105) in Tampa, Florida, and WRVQ (Q94) in Richmond, Virginia. All 5 stations were top 40 stations. Edens also owned WWDE (2WD) in Norfolk, Virginia, during this time, but that station was Adult Contemporary. Q106 competed against KFMB-FM (\\"B100\\"). Q106 enjoyed high ratings success, as the station was ranked #1 for 12 continuous ratings periods. However, in April 1990, XHITZ-FM flipped from classic rock to a dance-leaning CHR format as \\"Jammin' Z90\\", which took away much of Q106's audience. To counter this, the station shifted towards a more mainstream Top 40 format by early 1991. In 1992, Edens went into receivership, as the company lost large amounts of money due to the fallout of WRBQ from competitor WFLZ-FM. Par Broadcasting, owned by local brewing company mogul Leon Parma, bought the station that year. Ratings slightly improved, but not to the unprecedented levels the station attained in the beginning. Jacor, ironically the owners of WFLZ who also purchased KECR-FM, bought the station in early 1997. Morning hosts Jeff and Jer left for KFMB-FM (which flipped to Hot AC as \\"Star 100.7\\" in June 1994) in April 1997 due to tensions between the duo and the new owners. In addition, the station shifted towards a more adult lean. The station's ratings still didn't improve. In July 1998, due to the Jacor/Nationwide merger and in order to meet ownership limits, KKLQ was sold to Hispanic Broadcasting Company, forerunner to today's Univision, who announced a format change to Regional Mexican. During the last week of July, KKLQ aired \\"11 Years of the Q\\", airing various airchecks, jingles, and promotions from the station's 11-year history, while also redirecting listeners to KHTS-FM. After the farewell concluded, during the first week of August, KKLQ began stunting with a loop of \\"Macarena\\" by Los Del Rio, and again redirected listeners to KHTS.

Exotic species with high invader potential are ones with high tolerance of different climates, dissolved oxygen content (for aquatic organisms), high propagule pressure and species with a large number of individuals introduced. The last factor is called a transport vector, for instance, sea lampreys and zebra mussels were transported into the Great Lakes through the vector of ballast water in ships. Transport vector is one of the most important factors, because if a large enough number of individuals are transported to an area that they cannot thrive in, a mutation within that population to thrive in the new ecosystem is more likely. Most invaders are adapted to disturbed areas, so ecosystems that have been disrupted or roadside ditches are susceptible to invasion. Climate matching is one of the most common measures of invader potential. Mostly exotic species that have already exhibited invasive traits are studied. Biotic resistance is a controversial concept in invader potential. Small scale studies have borne the concept of diversity resistance, that diverse ecosystems resist invasions better than less diverse ecosystems. However, evidence on regional scales finds a positive correlation between diversity and number of invasions. The exact interpretation of these studies is unclear.

History Created by Dr. Samuel Osaigbovo Ogbemudia, Bendel Insurance was one of the founding members of the Nigerian Premier League in 1972. The team had its first month of the 2007‚Äì08 season delayed because of a management dispute over who controlled the team. The crisis led to at one time two different clubs claiming the name Insurance. They were relegated at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season after finishing in last place, the first relegation from the top level in team history. In August 2008, the ownership crisis was settled and the Edo State government took control. Thus the name officially reverted to Bendel Insurance Football Club. However the financial problems continued throughout the season. In February 2009 Insurance was banned from using their stadium temporarily because it was not up to league standards. In March, they were one of eight teams threatened with having their participation suspended due to a backlog of debts and fines. Finally, they were exiled to Ilorin for their final home game of the season after crowd trouble in a 1‚Äì1 tie against Shooting Stars FC that put an end to their promotion chances. The reason to Bendel Insurance's breakdown was because of the ownership situations. Bendel Insurance were promoted back to the top flight for the 2019 season after spending over ten years in lower divisions.

In that role, the officeholder represents national unity and guarantees that Italian politics comply with the Constitution of Italy. The president's term of office lasts for seven years. The current holder is former Constitutional Judge Sergio Mattarella, who was elected on 31 January 2015. Qualifications for office The framers of the Constitution of Italy intended for the president to be an elder statesman of some stature. Article 84 states that any citizen who is fifty or older on election day and enjoys civil and political rights can be elected president. The article also states that the presidency is incompatible with any other office, therefore the president-elect must resign any other position before being sworn in. The 1948 Constitution does not put any term limit on the presidency, although until 2013 no president ever ran for a second term. On 20 April 2013, President Giorgio Napolitano agreed to run for a second term in an attempt to break the parliamentary deadlock in the 2013 presidential elections and was duly reelected the same day. However, he made it clear that he would not serve his full term and resigned in January 2015. Election The President of the Italian Republic is elected by an electoral college of about 1,000 members. It comprises both chambers of the Italian Parliament‚Äîthe Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic‚Äîmeeting in joint session, combined with 58 special electors appointed by the regional councils of each of the 20 regions of Italy. Three representatives come from each region (save for the Aosta Valley, which due to its small size only appoints one), so as to guarantee representation for all localities and minorities. The electoral college thus consists of: * Deputies (630) * Senators (315 elected, plus a variable number of Senators for life) * Regional representatives (58) According to the Constitution, the election must be held by a secret ballot, with the senators, deputies and regional representatives all being required to vote. A two-thirds vote is required to elect on any of the first three rounds of balloting and after that a simple majority suffices. The number of rounds has often been large thanks to the secret ballot and fragmented nature of the Italian Parliament The election is presided over by the President of the Chamber of Deputies, who calls for the public counting of the votes. The vote is held in the Palazzo Montecitorio, seat of the Chamber of Deputies, which is expanded and re-configured for the event. Presidential mandate President Mattarella delivering his inaugural speech in front of the Italian Parliament on 3 February 2015. The President of the Italian Republic assumes office after taking an oath before the Italian Parliament and delivering a presidential address. The term of the President of the Italian Republic lasts seven years. This prevents any officeholder from being reelected by the same houses, which have a five-year mandate, also granting some freedom from excessive political ties to the appointing body. The Italian president's term may end by voluntary resignation, death, permanent disability due to serious illness, or dismissal as for crimes of high treason or an attack on the Constitution. A former president of the Republic is called President emeritus of the Republic and appointed Senator for life. In the absence of the President of the Republic, including travel abroad, presidential functions are performed by the President of the Senate.  Role  The Constitution lays out the duties and powers of the President of the Republic, to include the following: # In foreign affairs: #* Accrediting and receiving diplomatic functionaries. #* Ratifying international treaties upon authorization of Parliament (if required according to Article 80 of the Constitution). #* Making official visits abroad, accompanied by a member of the government. #* Declaring a state of war as decided by Parliament. # In parliamentary affairs: #* Nominating up to five Senators for life. #* Calling the Chambers of Parliament into extraordinary session and dissolving them. #* Calling elections and fixing the date for the first meeting of the new Chambers. # In legislative matters: #* Authorizing the presentation of proposed governmental bills to Parliament. #* Promulgating the laws approved in Parliament. #* Remanding to the Chambers (with an explanation) and asking for reconsideration of a bill (permitted once per bill). # Appertaining to popular sovereignty. #* Calling referenda. # In executive matters and as to official protocol. #* Naming the Prime Minister of Italy and appointing Cabinet ministers on the advice of the prime minister. #* Accepting the oath of the government. #* Receiving the resignation of a government. #* Promulgating laws by decree, which are proposed by the government alone. Unless acted on by Parliament, these measures expire after 60 days. #* Naming certain high state functionaries. #* Presiding over the Consiglio Supremo di Difesa (Supreme Defense Council) and commanding the armed forces. #* Decreeing the dissolution of regional councils and the removals of presidents of regions. # In judicial matters: #* Presiding over the Consiglio Superiore della Magistratura (Superior Judicial Council). #* Naming one-third of the Constitutional Court. #*Naming 5 members of the Constitutional Court of Italy. #* Granting pardons and commutations. In practice, the president's office is mostly‚Äîthough not entirely‚Äîceremonial. The Constitution provides that nearly all presidential acts must be countersigned by a member of the government (either the prime minister or an individual minister) as most presidential acts are only formal and real political responsibility is upon the government. Many of the others are duties that he is required to perform. However, pardons and commutations have been recognized as autonomous powers of the president. Despite the seemingly ceremonial nature of the position the president's role still has important implications. His ability to send a piece of legislation back to Parliament is not taken lightly by legislators, who are unlikely to ignore it unless the legislation is critical. Moreover, in times of political instability the president has significant leeway in appointing prime ministers, such as when President Scalfaro appointed Lamberto Dini as prime minister against the wishes of outgoing Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, or when President Napolitano appointed Mario Monti in 2011 and Enrico Letta in 2013. This leeway extends even further to cabinet appointments, as in 2018 when President Mattarella blocked the appointment of Paolo Savona to the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Mattarella felt that Savona's Euroscepticism would endanger Italy's relationship with the EU; he took the line that as the guardian of the Constitution, he could allow this to not happen. Succession Standard of the Substitute President of the Republic According to Article 86 of the Constitution, in all the cases in which the president is unable to perform the functions of the office, these shall be performed by the president of the Senate, who would temporarily serve as Acting President of Italy. In the event of permanent incapacity, death in office or resignation of the president, the president of the Chamber of Deputies shall call an election of a new president within fifteen days, notwithstanding the longer term envisaged during the dissolution of the Parliament or in the three months preceding dissolution. Residence The officeholder resides in Rome at the Quirinal Palace and also has at his disposal the presidential holdings of Castelporziano, near Rome and Villa Rosebery in Naples. The residence at the Quirinal is guarded by the Corazzieri, an elite cuirassier honor guard that is part of the Carabinieri and has its historical roots in the guards of the House of Savoy.

In Late Antiquity, it was known as Constantina or Constantia () by the Romans and Byzantines, and Tella by the local Assyrian/Syriac population.  History  According to the Byzantine historian John Malalas, the city was built by the Roman Emperor Constantine I on the site of former Maximianopolis, which had been destroyed by a Persian attack and an earthquake. During the next two centuries, it was an important location in the Roman/Byzantine Near East, playing a crucial role in the Roman‚ÄìPersian Wars of the 6th century as the seat of the dux Mesopotamiae (363‚Äì540). It was also a bishopric, suffragan of Edessa. Jacob Baradaeus was born near the city and was a monk in a nearby monastery. The city was captured by the Arabs in 639. The city became the base for the Ottoman statesman of Kurdish origin Ibrahim Pasha, leader of the Kurdish Milan tribe, in the late nineteenth century. Beginning in 1891, Ibrahim Pasha led several regiments of the state-sponsored tribal light cavalries known as the Hamidiye Brigades. He enjoyed the favor of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and also extended protection to local Christian populations, with some 600 families taking up residence in the district by the early 1900s. The British spy and diplomat Mark Sykes claimed that Ibrahim Pasha had also saved some 10,000 Christians in the midst of the massacres of the 1890s. The historian Janet Klein writes that \\"on the eve of the Young Turk Revolution, Ibrahim Pasha was one of the most powerful figures in all of Kurdistan.\\" Yet after the revolution, Ibrahim Pasha could no longer count on the support of the palace. He died on 27 September 1908 of dysentery, hotly pursued by Ottoman troops near Nusaybin. On the eve of World War I, Viran≈üehir's Armenian population of numbered 1,339. The city's kaimakam apparently objected to May 1915 orders of raids on the population, but higher-ups eventually prevailed, and the entire population was massacred or sent to Ras al-'Ayn.  Modern city  Thanks to the income from cotton, Viran≈üehir is one of the fastest-growing towns in Turkey, the population having more than doubled from 57,461 in 1990 to 121,382 in 2000 (census figures). (The urban population is 89,940 as of 2009. The Mayor of Viransehir, Leyla G√ºven, was detained in December 2009 under Turkey's anti-terror legislation. Her trial began on 18 October 2010.

The company was founded by Minnesota native Frank W. Griswold, one of thirteen children born to attorney and local landowner Franklin C. Griswold. History =Bobby signal= Griswold got his start in 1923 with the invention of the \\"American Bobby,\\" a traffic signal designed for placement in the middle of an intersection that would collapse if struck by a vehicle. Many bobby signals were sold to municipalities throughout North America; this led to the development of the rotating banner signal. =Rotating banner signal= In 1927, Griswold introduced the rotating banner signal. This was a unique combination of highway flasher and rotating stop sign. An approaching train would trigger not just the requisite red flashing lights and bells, but a mechanism that rotated a yellow stop sign ninety degrees to face traffic as well. (The signs eventually changed to red.)See a photo of one without the lights at http://www.trainweb.org/dansrailpix/Griswold_calistoga.JPG This type of signal was relatively common throughout the Midwestern United States, where state regulators required use of the design. Some were also installed in the Western United States, especially along the Great Northern, Milwaukee Road, and Southern Pacific. =Surviving signals= Griswold signals on 22nd Avenue NE, Minneapolis, in 2018 As of November 2016, there are only half a dozen known Griswold signals still in service along active rail, all in Minnesota, none with rotating stop sign signals. The last pair with an operating banner protected 22nd Ave NE in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Griswolds in Tacoma, Washington and San Jose, California were both removed circa 2010. =Magnetic Signal Company= The firm purchased Los Angeles-based Magnetic Signal Company in the late 1940s and moved production to Minneapolis. Magnetic Signal is the company credited with the invention of the wigwag grade crossing signal once common throughout Southern California. =Railroad Accessories Corporation= Railroad Accessories Corporation (RACO) merged with Griswold Signal Company in 1964. Manufacturing of crossing signals continued in Minneapolis. =Safetran Systems= RACO and Marquardt Industrial Products merged in 1971 to form Safetran Systems. Management, sales, and manufacture of crossing signals continued in Minneapolis until 2000, when the division moved to Kentucky.

The car was meant to provide a speedier option for police departments in lieu of other full sized (and heavier) sedans on the market at the time. The SSP abbreviation means Special Service Package, a special Foxbody Mustang trim made exclusively for law enforcement use. One of the taglines used by Ford to help sell this car was This Ford chases Porsches for a living... The units served a number of uses, and were often customized to suit each law enforcement agency's particular needs. Law enforcement agencies from municipal to government agencies bought nearly 15,000 examples of these units. Many still exist today, either still in some role of law enforcement, from display cars to DARE cars, or in the hands of collectors and racers. History In 1982, the California Highway Patrol asked the Ford Motor Company to produce a capable and lightweight police car due to the bulkiness of current police cars like the Ford Fairmont and LTD/Crown Victoria and the problems incurred with Chevrolet Camaros with their camshafts and engine problemsMustang Monthly \\"Highly Pursued\\" text and photos by Donald Farr, May 2006 pg 88-90 at pursuit speeds. Taking the Fox 5.0 Mustangs in production at the time, Ford produced the Ford Mustang SSP and modified them to suit the needs of the police and law enforcement departments. 1982 Ford Mustang Coupe that was a former California Highway Patrol car 1985 Ford Mustang SSP 5.0 Coupe Kentucky State Police State Trooper car 1989 Ford Mustang SSP Coupe Alabama State Police State Trooper car 1992 Ford Mustang SSP Coupe owned by Florida State Police It is estimated that nearly 15,000 of these special units were made from 1982 until their discontinuation in 1993 for over 60 law enforcement organizations and government agencies. Their roles ranged from general patrol to pursuit units, with some used in special duties like drug interdiction to academy training units. Several units were specially tasked to help land the Lockheed U-2 Spyplane. Specifications The Mustang SSP was essentially a more rugged version of the 5.0 Mustang, with added features (some standard, some optional) not available to the general public. Some of the additional features were: * Engine oil cooler * Silicone radiator hoses and aircraft-style clamps * Auto transmission fluid cooler * 130 and 135 amp internally and externally regulated heavy duty alternators * Two-piece VASCAR speedometer cable * Certified calibrated speedometer 0-140 mph (1982-early 1989) and 0-160 mph (late 1989-1993) * Non-operational courtesy lights (safety feature) * Relocated rear deck release * Single key locking doors/trunk * Reinforced floor pans * Full size spare tire Depending on which agency bought them, extras like rollcages (installed by Oregon State Police and Kentucky State Police) and power windows (requested by New York State Police) made each SSP unique to their respective departments. The original configuration of the civilian Mustang with its small rear seat and manual transmission were generally considered ill-suited for a law-enforcement vehicle. Many SSPs had automatic transmissions, to free an officer's hand from using the manual transmission stick so that they could use the hand for other duties, such as speaking on a radio. Usage Some of the known users of the Mustang SSP include: =United States Government= *Drug Enforcement Administration *Federal Bureau of Investigation *Immigration and Naturalization Service *United States Postal Service - 6 were used in the Los Angeles area in California *United States Air Force - Used as a chase car for the U-2 Spy Plane. *United States Border Patrol - Drug interdiction; resides at USBP Museum in Texas. *United States Customs Service *US Fish and Wildlife Service =State governments= *Alabama State Troopers *Arizona Department of Public Safety *California Highway Patrol - Initial purchaser of the Mustang SSP *Colorado State Patrol *Connecticut State Police *Delaware State Police *Florida Highway Patrol - Second biggest user of the Mustang SSP. *Georgia State Patrol *Idaho State Police *Indiana State Police *Kansas Highway Patrol *Kentucky State Police *Louisiana State Police *Massachusetts State Police *Michigan State Police *Minnesota State Patrol *Mississippi Highway Patrol *Missouri Highway Patrol *Nebraska State Patrol *Nevada Highway Patrol *New Mexico State Police *New York State Police *North Carolina Highway Patrol *Oklahoma Highway Patrol *Oregon State Police *Pennsylvania State Police *Rhode Island State Police *South Carolina Highway Patrol *Tennessee Highway Patrol *Texas Department of Public Safety - Third biggest user of the Mustang SSP *Utah Highway Patrol *Virginia State Police - Manual transmission - Unmarked cars *Washington State Patrol *Wisconsin State Patrol *Wyoming Highway Patrol =City/County governments= * Arlington, TX Police Department * Douglas County, GA Sheriff's Department * Atlanta, GA Police Department * Smithfield, VA Police Department * Clearwater, FL Police Department * Fort Worth, TX Police Department * Jonesboro, AR Police Department * New York City Police Department - Highway Patrol Branch * Pensacola, FL Police Department * San Francisco Police Department * Winter Park FL Police Department * Beverly Hills, CA Police Department * Portland Police Bureau, OR * Gilroy, CA Police Department * Earth, TX Police Department * Tarrant County, TX Sheriff's Department * Stephenville TX Police Department * Parachute, CO Police Department * Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, Largo Florida =Canada= * Royal Canadian Mounted Police Disposition Ex Florida Highway Patrol Ford Mustang SSP Same Florida Highway Patrol Ford Mustang SSP after repainting Most of the Mustang SSPs have been retired from service, with a few examples still on the rosters of police departments as display or DARE cars. A few law enforcement agencies still keep them on active duty. Most examples have found their way into either racing or restoration. With its stiffened frame and beefed up suspension, many Mustang SSPs were modified for use in drag racing. The plentiful aftermarket of parts for the 5.0 engine made the SSP platform a desirable frame to work on, but with the dwindling supply and rising prices of genuine Mustang SSPs, these factors have limited racers from converting SSPs for racing purposes. Restoring Mustang SSPs have become a growing hobby as of late, with car clubs and websites devoted to the restoration of the law enforcement workhorse. Most enthusiasts strive for accuracy in their models, with many scouring for OEM parts, including police radios, shotgun holders, lights, sirens, and other related equipment. However, the hobby is limited, as many states have regulations on private citizens owning cars that could be mistaken for real law enforcement vehicles. Some get around the regulations by using magnetic decals and removable lights. Distinct models =CHP Hatchback= In 1982, the CHP ordered 400 Special Service Package notchback coupes (394 were built by Ford and shipped to the CHP), and at least 4 cars were SSP hatchbacks. These four hatchbacks were painted and equipped in the same manner as the SSP coupes. They were produced under a different 6-digit Fleet DSO number than the SSP coupes, and were retained for use and evaluation by the CHP. One of these hatchbacks exists in private hands. =CHP EVOC= Several Mustang SSPs were converted by the CHP to EVOC (Emergency Vehicle Operations Course) track vehicles. These EVOC vehicles were used for training the cadets how to drive at high speeds. The Mustangs were known for their 140+- mile per hour top speed. Modifications include a full roll cage, racing harnesses, and tuned front suspension (for high speed driving and cornering). The EVOC vehicles were highly maintained to ensure safety while on the track. =USAF U-2 chase car= Due to problems with landing the Lockheed U-2, a system was implemented where a second pilot would chase the U-2 (termed \\"mobile\\") and help guide the aircraft down to earth. The USAF usually utilized a performance car for this task.Modified Mustangs \\"They Come, They Go!: First in Harms Way\\" sidebar Story by Don Roy Photos by James Pickett, January 2007 pg 117 In 1986, the USAF was looking for a replacement for the Chevrolet El Camino as a chase car for the U-2. Beale Air Force Base asked the local California Highway Patrol to provide a Mustang SSP for testing. The test proved the Mustang SSP superior to the El Camino and the USAF ordered 20 for work with the spyplanes. Their career lasted until the late 1990s, when they were replaced by \\"Special Service\\" B4C Chevrolet Camaros. One of three examples from RAF Alconbury is preserved: 1988 Mustang SSP 88B 9971 \\"Mobile 1\\", serving with the 17th Reconnaissance Wing and the 95th Reconnaissance Squadron until its disposal in 1999. It is currently in the hands of a private collector in the United States after being ferried from its last operation in Italy to England. Saleen connections Noted manufacturer Saleen contributed to the history of the Mustang SSP. The Oregon State Police had ordered 34 coupes in 1988, but cancelled the order at the last minute. The dealership that ordered the coupes, Damerow Ford, scrambled to find a way to get rid of the order, and Saleen took custody of 14 of the cars. Saleen returned the cars after adding vehicle ID, rear spoiler, ground effects and interior upgrades. The dealer then resold them. While not a true SSP, Saleen modified another 5.0, a 1989 5.0 LX Hatchback, for the Seal Beach, California Police Department. Designated as an S442 model; this model served Seal Beach until its retirement in the late 1990s.Mustang Forty Years, by Randy Leffingwell, See also * Ford Mustang * Police vehicles in the United States References Book and magazine references * Mustang Forty Years, by Randy Leffingwell, * Mustang Monthly \\"For Special Service\\" by Miles Cook, November 2004 (PDF copy of article here) * Mustang Monthly \\"Highly Pursued\\" text and photos by Donald Farr, May 2006 pg 88-90 * Modified Mustangs \\"They Come, They Go!: First in Harms Way\\" sidebar Story by Don Roy Photos by James Pickett, January 2007 pg 117 External links * SSP Mustang VIN Project * Mustang Special Service Registry * Special Service Mustangs * SSP Mustang SSP Fox Mustang Category:Coup√©s SSP Category:Hatchbacks Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Police vehicles ","title":"Ford Mustang SSP"},{"id":"3612121","text":"Heidi Jo Mueller (born January 29, 1982) is an American actress.

The main line ran from Bay City north to Cheboygan; it operated from 1894 to 1992. At the end of 1925 it incorporated 375 miles of road and 470 miles of track; that year the Turtle Line reported 81 million ton-miles of revenue freight and 7 million passenger-miles. In 1967 it reported 124 million ton-miles on 224 miles of road. History The Detroit, Bay City & Alpena Railroad, was a narrow gauge short line operated from Bay City northward to the Lake Huron port of Alpena. The line was converted to in 1886 and was reorganized into the Detroit and Mackinac (D&M;) on December 17, 1894. During the late 1890s and the first decade of the Twentieth Century, the timber resources of northeastern Michigan were fully utilized and the D&M; expanded its trackage northward from Alpena to Cheboygan. The Bay City-Cheboygan main line prospered, and a stone passenger depot was constructed in Harrisville. The main constituent of the freight service offered by the D&M; and its predecessor railroads was timber from what was then the vast forests of northeastern Michigan; the D&M; built spurs and branch lines to the forested areas. Another branch line served the limestone quarries of Rogers City. In 1922, the railroad also had branch lines to Au Gres, Comins, Curran, Hillman, Lincoln, Prescott, and Rose City. In the 1940s, D&M; had enough revenue to be a Class I railroad and it was one of the first such to eliminate steam locomotives in 1948. In March 1976, the Detroit & Mackinac acquired a combination of trackage and operating trackage rights from the remains of the bankrupt Penn Central that created an alternate main line from Bay City northward, through Gaylord and Cheboygan, to Mackinaw City. However, adverse economic conditions continued to affect railroad operations in the northeastern United States. The road was sold to the Lake State Railway in 1992, and ended its existence as an independent railroad. The Detroit & Mackinac called itself the \\"Turtle Line\\" and its logo symbol was \\"Mackinac Mac\\".Detroit and Mackinac Railway photographs. The railroad bore the hostile backronym of \\"Defeated & Maltreated\\". =Passenger service= The D&M; mainline from Bay City to Alpena offered sleeping car and meal services between Detroit and Alpena in the 1930s. Continuing coaches were carried over Michigan Central Railroad tracks from Detroit to Bay City.'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1936, Detroit and Mackinac section By the 1940s, meal services had disappeared. By 1949, service was reduced to a morning trip from Bay City to Alpena and a reverse trip in the evening.'Official Guide of the Railways,' August 1949, Detroit and Mackinac section Sleeping cars and Detroit connections were also gone by the 1950s. Passenger service had been eliminated by 1951.

In 1960, the station was knocked off the air by a fire, started when a transmitter short circuited and ignited a rug, that caused $50,000 in damage. After Ferreira's 1964 death, Gustavo Faist Fern√°ndez became the new concessionaire. In turn, Faist transferred the station to Gustavo E. Astiazar√°n Rosas in 1969. In 1973, the concession was placed under its current concessionaire.

The central canal below at the ventricular system of the brain, from which it receives cerebrospinal fluid, and shares the same ependymal lining. The central canal helps to transport nutrients to the spinal cord as well as protect it by cushioning the impact of a force when the spine is affected. The central canal represents the adult remainder of the central cavity of the neural tube. It generally occludes (closes off) with age. Structure Cross section of central canal The central canal below at the ventricular system of the brain, beginning at a region called the obex where the fourth ventricle, a cavity present in the brainstem, narrows. The central canal is located in the third of the spinal cord in the cervical and thoracic regions. In the lumbar spine it enlarges and is located more centrally. At the conus medullaris, where the spinal cord tapers, it is located more ly. =Terminal ventricle= The terminal ventricle (ventriculus terminalis, fifth ventricle or ampulla caudalis) is the widest part of the central canal of the spinal cord that is located at or near the conus medullaris. It was described by Stilling in 1859 and Krause in 1875. Krause introduced the term fifth ventricle after observation of normal ependymal cells. The central canal expands as a fusiform terminal ventricle, and approximately 8‚Äì10 mm in length in the conus medullaris (or conus terminalis).Williams & Warwick. Gray's Anatomy .THIRTY-SEVENTH EDITION. Although the terminal ventricle is visible in the fetus and children, it is usually absent in adults. Sometimes, the terminal ventricle is observed by MRI or ultrasound in children less than 5 years old. =Microanatomy= The central canal shares the same ependymal lining as the ventricular system of the brain. The canal is lined by ciliated, column-shaped cells, outside of which is a band of gelatinous substance, called the substantia gelatinosa centralis (or central gelatinous substance of spinal cord). This gelatinous substance consists mainly of neuroglia, but contains a few nerve cells and fibers; it is traversed by processes from the deep ends of the columnar ciliated cells which line the central canal. The substantia gelatinosa of Rolando, is located more dorsally. =Development= The central canal represents the adult remainder of the central cavity of the neural tube. It generally occludes (closes off) with age. Function The central canal carries cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which it receives from the ventricular system of the brain. The central canal helps to transport nutrients to the spinal cord as well as protect it by cushioning the impact of a force when the spine is affected. Clinical significance Syringomyelia is a disease caused by the blockage of the central canal. Blockage of the central canal usually occurs at the lower cervical and upper thoracic levels. This typically damages white matter fibers that cross in anterior white commissure, leading to the loss of temperature, pain, and motor function at the affected levels on side opposite to the damage. Other relevant conditions include: * Spina bifida * Arnold-Chiari syndrome * Spinal tumor * Myelomeningocele * Syringomyelia * Hydromyelia. In hydromyelia, a dilation of the central canal of the spinal cord is caused by an increase of cerebrospinal fluid. * Syringohydromyelia (i.e., both Syringomyelia and Hydromyelia) * Tethered cord In some cases, the terminal ventricle may cause clinical symptoms due to its expansion.

The half-hour show was broadcast weekly on Sunday mornings at 12:30 am on KDLT. The program's original title was Captain Caribou. Initially, the program started out with a spoof of the long running Captain Kangaroo program, featuring Chuck Brennan as Captain Caribou. Premise Much of the show's comedy was often based on South Dakota topics, such as the abortion ban, gun control, and home schooling. A number of sketches appeared on the show regularly, including Booby Boobenheimer, Harry Back, and Ag East of Salem. Other sketches were parodies of well known television programs, such as Antiques Roadshow. The show also lampooned local political figures, including Dave Munson and Vernon Brown. The Caribou Show was written and directed by the show's creator, Todd Magnuson. Much of the show was actually shot in Todd Magnuson's home. The cast included Terri Lawrenz, John Barnes, Chuck Brennan, Amanda Bumann, Dan Eisenhauer, Todd Magnuson, Bart Naasz, T-Roy Nelson, Scott Pearson, and Brian \\"Ring a Ding\\" Dingler. Model Terri Lawrenz is the most recent addition to the cast. The show is owned and copyrighted by Caribou Productions. The Caribou Show was seen locally, and skits were updated on its website. Later, the show planned to expand to other markets. The program's nearly seven-year run ended with broadcast of the last episode on October 27, 2007. The show's successor was a spin-off from Caribou Productions called Out and About with Terri and Todd. This new program, based on the T n T segments from the Caribou Show, was broadcast on Saturdays at 10:00pm on KCPO-LP. In 2008, Todd Magnuson and Terri Lawrenz started a high-definition educational programs called Nature Adventures, which appears on locally in South Dakota on South Dakota Public Broadcasting, and nationally on Livewell Network, GetTV, and FamilyNet. Cast appearances on other networks Lawrenz has appeared on the Food Network as well as The Apprentice 6, Magnuson on the hay-oriented Bales, and Eisenhauer on The 700 Club. Movie projects In 2005, the people from Caribou Productions completed work on their first film, It's Really Something. The movie is a spoof of the 1969 film, It's Alive. The premise of the 2005 remake is that a crazed South Dakota farmer's pet dinosaur feeds on tourists. The film will be distributed on DVD worldwide by Troma Entertainment. Caribou Productions finished production of their second feature film Lost Valley of Cavemen the following year. This is an original, where campy scientists get lost in a valley of cavemen and dinosaurs. The premiere date was September 29, 2006. \\"Deery\\", the comedic television show about a deer who fights crime, is scheduled to premiere on Adult Swim once more episodes are finished.

A Chevrolet Suburban in service with the Toronto Police Service Emergency Task Force, 2008. A Communications Division Command Post vehicle in service with the New York City Police Department. Police vehicles in the United States and Canada are produced by several manufacturers and are available in three broad vehicle types: Police Pursuit Vehicles (PPV), Special Service Vehicles (SSV), and Special Service Package (SSP). Police Pursuit Vehicles are the most common police cars. They are equipped to handle the vast majority of tasks, including pursuit and high-speed response calls. Special Service Vehicles and Special Service Package are specialized vehicles, such as sport-utility vehicles and sports cars. They are generally heavier-duty and may come with specialized option packages for specific tasks, but are typically not recommended by the manufacturer for use as pursuit vehicles. History The first police car was a wagon run by electricity on the streets of Akron, Ohio in 1899. Since the 1920s, the New York City Police Department has employed a fleet of Radio Motor Patrol vehicles to aid in its fight against crime within the city. Ford's introduction of the flathead V-8 in its Model 18 in 1932‚Äì‚Äìthe first low-priced, mass-marketed car with a V8 engine‚Äì‚Äìproved popular amongst police departments and led to strong brand loyalty. In turn, this gave the company a market-capturing edge that lasted until 1968. In the 1940s and 1950s, the \\"Big Three\\" (Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler) began to offer specialized police packages with severe duty parts. Foremost amongst these was the Ford package of 1950, which utilized the larger and more powerful Mercury engine in the smaller, lighter Ford. This ended the practice of some state police buying larger and more powerful, but higher- priced models including Buicks, Hudsons, and Chryslers. In 1969, Plymouth took first place in the police market, with Chrysler's 440 cu. in. V8s, Torqueflite transmissions, and torsion bar suspensions giving them a compelling advantage. Chrysler held this lead until the 1970s energy crisis drove buyers to smaller cars, and Chrysler subsequently discontinued their rear-drive platform after the 1989 model year. In the United States and Canada, police departments have historically used standard-size, low-price line sedans since the days of the Ford Model A, although many police departments switched to intermediates‚Äì‚Äìsuch as the Plymouth Satellite, Ford Torino, and AMC Matador‚Äì‚Äìin the 1960s and 1970s. Some state highway patrols (including those of California and Missouri) adopted pony cars, such as the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, and AMC Javelin for use as high-speed pursuit vehicles. The Ford LTD, Plymouth Gran Fury, and Chevrolet Caprice were re-adopted as standard when the models were downsized in the late 1970s. Since the termination of the North American Chevrolet Caprice model in 1996 (though it would subsequently return in 2010 for exclusive law enforcement use), the Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor replaced it as the standard patrol car, however, most Ford Crown Victorias have now been phased out. In an attempt to better combat the threat of rear- end impacts that highway patrol vehicles face when stopped on the shoulder, new models can be optionally equipped with a fire suppression system. Other models such as the Chevrolet Impala (8th and 9th generations), Chevrolet Tahoe and Dodge Charger also gained a percentage of the market. In September 2011, however, Ford discontinued the Crown Victoria in favor of the 6th-generation Taurus. This has helped Dodge reclaim leadership in the market with the Dodge Charger Pursuit, as of 2012. Non-Crown Victoria police vehicles may be bought to diversify a police department's fleet in order to better minimize disruption should a recall occur. Despite some (primarily Canadian) jurisdictions electing to use front-wheel-drive sedans with smaller engines‚Äì‚Äìmainly the Chevrolet Impala, the current iteration of which being a V6‚Äì‚Äìthe rear-wheel-drive V8 configuration is still widely preferred, due in part to its consistency with pursuit driver training, as well as generally greater reliability. Furthermore, trials with FWD vehicles such as the Taurus and Impala have proven problematic in terms of maintenance costs.http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com/article/20110421/NEWS01/104210338 In 1994, for example, a Ford spokeswoman noted that \\"It is certainly true that any front-wheel-drive car would be more expensive and difficult to maintain if you subjected it to the kind of hard use they get in police departments.\\" Current vehicles Subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws, any vehicle, appropriately modified, can be used as a police vehicle, but the most common are those designed or modified by manufacturers as police or special service vehicles. Sport Utility Vehicles have become increasingly popular in police fleets in Canada and the United States. Benefits often cited include extra room for equipment and better outward visibility due to the higher seating position compared with sedans. The following model year 2019 and 2020 vehicles (in various drivetrain configurations) were submitted by manufacturers for the 2019 evaluation by the Michigan State Police and the U.S. National Institute of Justice: * 2019 Chevrolet Tahoe PPV (Police Pursuit Vehicle) * 2019 Dodge Charger Pursuit * 2019 Dodge Durango Pursuit * 2020 Ford Police Interceptor Utility (based on the 2019 Ford Explorer) * 2019 Ford F-150 Police Responder * 2019 Ford Police Responder Hybrid Sedan (based on the 2019 Ford Fusion) The Ford Taurus-based Police Interceptor Sedan was discontinued at the end of the 2019 model year, and was not included in the 2019 Michigan State Police and U.S. National Institute of Justice evaluation. Appearance An Akron, Ohio police cruiser A Royal Canadian Mounted Police Toyota Prius school liaison car in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. North American police cars were once noted for being painted black and white, But not just limited to black and white vehicles, with the car doors and roof painted white, while the trunk, hood, front fenders and rear quarter panels were painted black. The fleet vehicles that were used typically came painted in a single color, most commonly white or black, from the factory and were used as such. The contrasting black or white color was added to make the vehicle stand out from civilian vehicles. In 2007, the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) began converting its fleet back to a black-and-white scheme after decades of using other colors and varieties of paint jobs. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security recommends, but does not require, that local law enforcement agencies employ a uniform black and white vehicle color scheme for ease of visual identification nationwide. Beginning in the 1970s, police vehicle markings have become increasingly stylistic, with the widespread use of computer- graphics and vinyl striping. While black and white designs are still in use in many jurisdictions, cars may range from being all white to completely black. Blues and greens of various hues are also frequently used. Brown, beiges, and tans are favored by rural police and sheriff's offices. Official markings also vary by jurisdiction. The side doors and sometimes the hood of a marked police car usually bear the agency's badge or the city seal, often in reflective finish. Markings such as emergency telephone numbers, generic anti-drug or anti-crime messages, or even website URLs are also common. Some agencies also have identification numbers printed on the roofs of patrol cars for tracking from aircraft, or to distinguish specialized units, such as K-9 units or supervisors. Currently, in the United States and Canada, the paint scheme for each fleet is determined either by the individual agency or by uniform state legislation as in Minnesota. Usually, state laws exist that establish standards for police vehicle markings, and proscribe civilian vehicles from using certain markings or paint schemes as is the case in California. Today, most fleet markings on patrol vehicles are created from reflective vinyl with an adhesive backing that is applied in a peel-and-stick manner. Colors chosen to represent the department's identity are typically chosen by the individual department, although, as noted above, some states have specific guidelines for color schemes and markings. Vinyl used to produce fleet markings comes in large rolls that are fed through a plotter (cutter) or large-format printer/cutter. The designs are created in specialized computer software and sent to the machines via cable link for production. Once the design is cut into the vinyl, the excess vinyl on the sheet is removed in a process called \\"weeding\\". Finally, a paper pre-mask is applied to the top of the vinyl design to allow easy application of multiple letters and shapes at one time. Whatcom County Sheriff's Office- Stealth Dodge Charger (17248380012)Many enforcement agencies now use some \\"ghost cars\\" or \\"stealth cars\\" with smooth tops and minimal graphics for traffic enforcement. These vehicles have markings that are visible only at certain angles, such as from the rear or sides, making these cars appear unmarked when viewed from the front. These vehicles may meet the letter of the law as marked patrol vehicles, but are not as easily identifiable at a distance as a regular marked police vehicle. For public safety reasons, some jurisdictions do not allow officers in unmarked cars to pull over drivers. The graphics on a ghost car, minimal though they may be, are deemed sufficient in some jurisdictions to identify the vehicle as a legitimate police vehicle. Depending on the jurisdiction, such vehicles may or may not be permitted to engage in pursuits.

The D.A.R.E. cars appear at schools and in parades. Typically these cars are high-end or performance cars that have been seized in a drug raid. They are used to send the message that drug dealers forfeit all their glamorous trappings when they get caught. Cars include the Chevrolet Corvette, Ford Mustang, and Humvee. * The Edmonton, Alberta, D.A.R.E units are Hyundai Tiburons and Dodge Challengers. * The Monrovia, California Police Department has a 2000 Mazda MPV minivan used not just for D.A.R.E. functions but also for the Police Activities League. * The South San Francisco, California, Police Department has a 1981 White Motor Company RoadXpeditor refuse truck and a Chevrolet Camaro (police package) as their D.A.R.E. vehicles. * The Golden, Colorado Police Department has an old GTO that they use as their D.A.R.E. car.

Future  Ford ceased production of the ubiquitous Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor in 2011. The model was replaced by both the Ford Police Interceptor Sedan and the Ford Police Interceptor Utility.http://www.detnews.com/article/20091113/AUTO01/911130435/1148/auto01/Ford- fast-tracks-new-cop-car-to-replace-Crown-Vic On March 12, 2010, a prototype Ford Police Interceptor Sedan based on the sixth-generation Taurus's platform was demonstrated at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway; Ford assured law enforcement agencies that it would be in production when the last Crown Victorias were built in September 2011.http://www.detnews.com/article/20100312/AUTO01/3120341/1148/auto01/Ford- debuts-new-Police-Interceptor The car was also displayed to fleet managers from Canada and the United States at the National Association of Fleet Administrators (NAFA) exposition in Detroit in April. Months after the Sedan was unveiled, a prototype Ford Police Interceptor Utility based on the fifth generation Ford Explorer was unveiled at Ford's Chicago plant in front of its workforce by the then VP of U.S. Marketing, Sales and Service Ken Czubay. The production of the Police Interceptor Sedan began in 2012 as a 2013 model along with the Utility counterpart. The Dodge Charger Pursuit was first introduced as an LX body in 2006. In 2011, as an LD body, numerous changes were made to resolve a number of teething issues in previous cars. The 3.6 V-6 engine provides performance equal to or better than the P7B Crown Victoria, with a much better fuel economy. The 5.7 Hemi cars set record after record during yearly testing with the Michigan State Police. In late 2014, Dodge surpassed many of their own records with the new All-Wheel-Drive Pursuit. The AWD version became the only large Chrysler passenger sedan with AWD and the V8. By mid-2016, over 40% of all new Charger Pursuits were AWD. Prior to the release of the AWD Dodge, Ford held 60% of the police market. In 2015, and especially 2016 (after a price reduction), Dodge gained some ground on Ford, largely at the expense of the Taurus. The Mobile precinct station in both the models of a 26' trailer and AM General 6X6 military surplus vehicle have been inventoried in specific police departments within the United States.

Chan was born in China in 1901 and went to the United States in 1924, earning a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1929. Chan taught at Dartmouth College and Chatham University for most of his academic career. Chan's 1963 book A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy was highly influential in the English-speaking world, and was often used as a source for quotations from Chinese philosophical classics. Life and career Chan Wing-tsit was born on 18 August 1901 in Kaiping, a city in China's southern Guangdong Province. In 1916 he enrolled at Canton Christian College (later Lingnan University) near Canton (modern Guangzhou). After graduating with a bachelor's degree from Lingnan, he began his graduate studies at Harvard University in 1924. There he studied with Irving Babbitt, William Ernest Hocking, and Alfred North Whitehead, and was advised by James Haughton Woods, an eminent Sanskritist and translator of the Yoga Sutra. Chan received his Ph.D. in Philosophy and Chinese Culture in 1929. On his return to China in 1929, Chan received an appointment at Lingnan, which in 1927 had been reconstituted as Lingnan University, and served as its dean of the faculty from 1929 to 1936. In 1935 the University of Hawai'i offered him a visiting appointment. In 1937 he moved to Honolulu and taught there until 1942. He then taught at Dartmouth College from 1942 to 1966. He was Professor Emeritus of Chinese Philosophy and Culture at Dartmouth College, and from 1966 to 1982, Anna R.D. Gillespie Professor of Philosophy at Chatham University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Chinese translation of an oral memoir by Chan recorded from June, 1981 to June, 1983, and compiled and transcribed by Irene Bloom In retirement, Chan taught part-time at Chatham and at Columbia University. Chan was the author of A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, one of the most influential sources in the field of Asian studies, and of hundreds of books and articles in both English and Chinese on Chinese philosophy and religion. He was a leading translator of Chinese philosophical texts into English in the 20th century. He was also the author of articles on Chinese philosophy, Classical Confucian texts, Ou-Yang Hsiu, and Wang Yang-Ming in the Macropedia of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (15th edition, 1977 imprint). He expressed particular satisfaction over his chapter, The path to wisdom: Chinese philosophy and religion, in the book, Half the world: The history and culture of China and Japan (1973), edited by Arnold J. Toynbee. He had received numerous academic honors and was a member of the Academia Sinica. Chan died in Pittsburgh on August 12, 1994. The W.T.

In contrast to serial music, where the structuring features are more or less abstract and remain largely inaccessible to the listener's ear, in formula composition the musical specifications of pitch, dynamics, duration, timbre, and tempo are always directly evident in the sound, through the use of a concisely articulated melodic tone succession, the formula, which defines the large- scale form as well as all the internal musical details of the composition . Stockhausen's music Though foreshadowed in Stockhausen's once-withdrawn Formel (\\"Formula\\") of 1951, the technique made its first appearance in Mantra in 1970, and became the central focus of Stockhausen's music up to 2003. Stockhausen's mammoth opera cycle Licht is based on a three-strand \\"super- formula\\". Hermann identifies two kinds of formula composition in Stockhausen‚Äôs works prior to Licht: > formula compositions in which the form results from projection of the > formula, . . . [and] works in which melodies in themselves possess many > internal characteristics of formulas, but where the formal idea itself does > not originate from the formula(s) used in their realisation Works of the first type include Mantra (1970), Inori (1973‚Äì74), Jubil√§um (1977), and In Freundschaft (1977); works of the second type comprise Alphabet f√ºr Li√®ge (1972), the ‚ÄúLaub und Regen‚Äù duet from Herbstmusik (1974), Musik im Bauch (1975), Harlekin (1975), Der kleine Harlekin (1975), and Sirius (1975‚Äì77). Other works from the 1970s, such as Sternklang (1971), Trans (1971), Ylem (1972), the first three parts of Herbstmusik, Atmen gibt das Leben (1974/76‚Äì77), Tierkreis (1974‚Äì75), and Amour (1976) do not employ formula technique, according to Conen, though the composer includes Atmen gibt das Leben amongst the works composed using \\"formula complexes\\" . Other composers Pierre Boulez describes his composition Rituel, in memoriam Bruno Maderna (1975) as a \\"ceremony of memory\\", based on \\"numerous repetitions of the same formulas\\", and it has been seen as an analogue to Stockhausen's formula compositions‚Äîespecially to Inori, because of the shared ritual character of the two compositions . York H√∂ller, who studied with Stockhausen in 1971‚Äì72, uses a similar method, which he names Klanggestalt (literally, \\"sound-shape\\"), and at least one writer has used the expression \\"formula composition\\" to describe it . Finbar O'S√∫illeabh√°in, however, while accepting there are parallels between the techniques in H√∂ller's opera The Master and Margarita (1984‚Äì85) and Stockhausen's Licht cycle (1977‚Äì2003), concludes that H√∂ller's conception is \\"perfectly distinct\\" .

Coll√®ge Notre-Dame du Sacr√©-C≈ìur shares its name with the University of Notre Dame, which was also founded by the Congregation of Holy Cross. Notre-Dame means \\"Our Lady\\" in French and refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Sacr√©-C≈ìur means \\"Sacred Heart\\", which refers to the physical heart of Jesus Christ as a symbol of Divine love. It is generally considered one of the best French-language secondary schools in the city. The school is right in front of Saint Joseph's Oratory. In fact, Saint Andr√© Bessette, who built the Oratory, was the school's doorkeeper. History The school was founded in 1869 by the Congregation of Holy Cross and is administered by Roman Catholic priests and brothers. It adopts an educational approach that enhances the development of intellectual capability, spirituality, and of physical ability within a dynamic and favourable environment. Originally a boys-only school, it decided to allow female students in 1982 in grades 7 and 8 and then progressively became completely co-educational. Music, sports, theatre, and other extracurricular activities help create a healthy and balanced environment. Through all the years, the school is considered one of the best French schools in Quebec and is one of the top schools in Montreal, coming in first place but with a few other schools sharing that same position. In recent years, the institution has come into the public eye for a multitude of sex abuse cases and cover-ups spanning the better part of the second half of the 20th century. Uniform Since its inception, school uniforms have been compulsory at Coll√®ge Notre-Dame and must be worn at all times on school property. The dress code consists of a white or blue polo shirt and marine pants and/or a blue kilt for girls. Older polos might be colored yellow but these polos are not tolerated anymore since they are considered too marginal. The collar of the polo is coloured blue with yellow and royal blue stripes, which was the uniform until 2012. Since then, the polo is fully white, with a marine logo, and the marine polo now has white horizontal stripes. The gym uniform consists of a grey or blue T-shirt and a pair of blue shorts or cotton sweat pants; all have the school's emblem printed on them. Values * To respect others, the environment and yourself * To persevere and to strive for excellence * To be responsible * To participate and contribute to the community * Former l'esprit, le coeur et le corps Facilities The school library has over 20,000 books of all genres. It has three student-played orchestras. The computer labs have over a hundred computers. Teachers can use technology to teach in every single class. In some classes, there are touchscreen boards. Every class has computers. An indoor hockey arena, which seats around 400 spectators, is located behind the school and an auditorium. In addition, it has an indoor swimming pool, a football field,a soccer field, 2 fitness rooms, a race track and indoor and outdoor basketball courts. The school now wants to build another gym worth approximately $10 million. . The school is composed of 3 buildings, the old building, the C building and the P building. The old building is 5 floors, the C building is 5 floors and the P building is 5 floors. Also, the C Building has 2 huge study rooms full of desks. The rooms are used for the study period. Athletics The school's sports program is one of the most developed in the Province of Quebec. Coll√®ge Notre-Dame has five mandatory physical education classes on a six school days schedule and teams in a dozen of different sports. The football team, the Cactus, was created in 1958 and is playing in Quebec's AAA league. It has won fourteen provincial championships (87, 88, 89, 90, 94, 96, 01, 02, 05, 09, 10, 11, 13, 15) and is largely regarded among football analysts to be one of the great dynasties in Canadian Football. There are other sports teams, such as flag football for girls, broomball, basketball, cheerleading, hockey, soccer and volleyball. Music Music classes are mandatory in grade 7 and grade 8. The class lasts 5 months, which equals to a semester and is then replaced by ERC (religious class) for the second semester of the same school year. Students can choose from wind instruments, percussion or double bass. Students playing the bassoon, oboe or double bass will benefit from one private lesson per week with a specialist, since those instruments are particularly difficult for beginners. Depending on their performance, they can participate in a music concert at the end of the semester. Those who would like to enrich their music skills can register their name at the Music Department, take private lessons with an expert and play in the different orchestras depending on their school level and technical/musical abilities. Usually, the director of the department, Marc Deschamps, who is also the conductor, takes students from grade 9 (who have three years or more experiences in his/her major instrument) to grade 11 in his orchestra, the Wind Orchestra of College Notre-Dame (Orchestre √† Vent du CND). They play harmony music of level 3 or higher. An interesting fact about the conductor is that he has filled this position since the age of 19. Today, he is 54 years old. Every year, the different orchestras participate at the Festival des Harmonies et des Orchestre Symphoniques du Quebec held in Sherbrooke. There, the OAV plays different pieces (usually one warm-up piece and two competition pieces) and they are graded according to the orchestra's level. Musicians can also participate in the Concours Solistes et Petits Ensembles from the FHOSQ in Victoriaville. If they achieve a greater distinction mark, they win a prize, usually a certain amount of money for a specific music summer camp. Improvisation Coll√®ge Notre-Dame has an improvisation team in the ligue d'improvisation scolaire. It has won the Calembour cup twice. The school is represented in the \\"Cadet\\" category by the CoiNciDence, which has won the regional championship in 2013 and the \\"Juvenile\\" category by the inCaNDescence.

At the time of his father's death, in September 1106, he was 23 years old. He succeeded his father on 2 September 1106. Ali ruled from Morocco and appointed his brother as governor of Al-Andalus.

He commissioned a minbar now known as the Minbar of the Kutubiyya Mosque from a workshop in C√≥rdoba to furnish his grand mosque, the original Ben Youssef Mosque (destroyed under the Almohads), in the imperial capital, Marrakesh. The Almoravid Qubba also bears Ali's name. At the advice of Abu Walid Ibn Rushd (grandfather of Averroes), Ali built walls around Marrakesh as Ibn Tumart became more influential. There had been walls around the mosque and the palace, but Ali ibn Y≈´suf spent 70,000 gold dinars on the city's fortifications, doubling the city's size, and told the amirs of Al- Andalus to fortify their walls as well. He also established an irrigation system in Marrakesh, a project managed by Obeyd Allah ibn Younous al-Muhandes. This irrigation system made use of qanawat (, p. ). Ali also had the first bridge over the Tensift River built. Muwatta al-Imam Malik as read by Yahya ibn Yahya al-Laythi, written for Ali ibn Y≈´suf. In 1139, he lost the Battle of Ourique against the Portuguese forces led by the count Afonso Henriques, which allowed Afonso to proclaim himself an independent King.

It consists of the provinces of A Coru√±a, Lugo, Ourense and Pontevedra. It is bounded on the north by the Cantabrian Sea, to the south by Portugal, to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east by principality of Asturias and the community of Castile and Le√≥n.

Kings of Galicia In 910, Alfonso III the Great was forced to abdicate in favor of his sons, who partitioned the kingdom. This resulted in a briefly independent kingdom of Galicia: *Ordo√±o II (910‚Äì914) In 914, Ordo√±o acquired the throne at Le√≥n, reuniting his father's kingdom. On the death of his brother Fruela II of Le√≥n in 925, there was a period of competing claimants, being made king in Galicia: *Sancho I Ord√≥√±ez (926‚Äì929), first-born of Ordo√±o II The death of Sancho led to Galicia again becoming part of the Kingdom of Le√≥n, with which it was joined until 982, when the Galician nobility crowned in Santiago de Compostela an anti-king: *Bermudo II (982‚Äì985) Bermudo routed Ramiro III of Le√≥n in the battle of Portela de Areas, later becoming undisputed ruler of the Leonese kingdom, and so reunifying the realm. =Jim√©nez dynasty (1037‚Äì1111)= Upon the death of Ferdinand I of Le√≥n and Castile in 1065, Castile, Le√≥n, and Galicia became three separated kingdoms: *Garc√≠a II (1065‚Äì1072) - reigned in Galicia and Portugal until deposed by his brother Alfonso in 1072, after which he was kept chained in a castle until his death in 1090. Alfonso VI of Le√≥n reunited the Kingdoms of Castile, Le√≥n and Galicia. =House of Burgundy= *Alfonso VII (1111‚Äì1157) ‚Äì In 1111 he was crowned as the mediatized king of Galicia in Santiago de Compostela as his mother's heir apparent, and in 1126 he succeeded Urraca as king of Le√≥n, Castile and Toledo. Galicia was again merged within the larger realm, its size reduced in 1139 when Afonso Henriques won the independence of the County of Portugal. From 1152 on Alfonso VII associated his sons to the throne, Ferdinand receiving the title of King of Galicia. On the death of his father, in 1157, Fernando became King of Le√≥n. * Ferdinand II, king of Le√≥n (1157‚Äì1188) and Galicia (1152‚Äì1188) He was succeeded by his son: * Alfonso IX, king of Le√≥n and Galicia (1188‚Äì1230) On his death, he divided the kingdom between his daughters, who reigned a few months de jure: * Dulce, queen of Galicia (1230) de jure With the accession to the throne of Ferdinand III of Castile in 1230, the Kingdom of Galicia became dynastically united with the kingdoms of Le√≥n, Castile and Toledo inside the Crown of Castile, but maintaining its personality as a kingdom, and its own legal institutions. During the early reign Ferdinand IV, his uncle disputed the title with him and claimed to be king of Le√≥n, Galicia and Seville * John of Castile, Lord of Valencia de Campos, titular king of Le√≥n, Galicia and Seville (1296-1300) =Portuguese House of Burgundy= Following Peter I of Castile's death, a succession crisis occurred. During this time, the throne of Galiza was offered to Ferdinand I of Portugal, a member of the Portuguese House of Burgundy, and he was acclaimed in Galiza as King. His reign would see the opening of trade between the two nations and economic benefits for both. This reign, however, would be short, once Henry II of Castile demanded that Ferdinand give up the throne to Castile. Ferdinand did so easily, having not seen Galicia as an integral part of the Portuguese nation. =English House of Lancaster= In 1386, John of Gaunt pressed the claim for his wife (and himself), to the throne of Castile. He successfully invaded Galicia and held most of the country until he was defeated in 1387. =Portuguese House of Avis= Afonso V of Portugal and Juana la Beltraneja, acclaimed de jure kings of Galicia in 1475, saw their pretensions to the Castilian throne defeated at the Battle of Toro in 1479.

The proposed flood control measures in Bound Brook, New Jersey The worst flooding in the Green Brook basin occurs in Bound Brook, which partially lies on a natural flood plain of the Raritan River at the junction of the Green Brook and Raritan River. To address this flooding problem, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has proposed the Green Brook Sub Basin Flood Control Project, which entails numerous flood walls, levees, channel diversions, widening projects and retention basins throughout the Green Brook basin.US Army Corps of Engineers New York District: GREEN BROOK SUB BASIN, NJ , accessed May 10, 2006. Floodings during the project The Green Brook Flood Control project has languished for decades due to a lack of federal funding. Hurricane Floyd in 1999 caused yet more property damage and deaths in the Green Brook basin, especially in Bound Brook, and reinvigorated the flood control project. As of 2006, two levees have been built on the western and eastern sides of Bound Brook. An important levee (R2) on the southwestern side of Bound Brook, which would prevent the Raritan River from flooding the downtown and nearby residential areas, has been completed. Full 150 year protection of downtown and nearby residential areas of Bound Brook is effectively in place with final construction due to be completed by the summer of 2014. Downtown Bound Brook, New Jersey, April 16, 2007 The April Nor'easter of 2007 flooded Bound Brook with the second highest crest ever recorded in the area, as the envisioned flood protection systems were not yet fully in place. However, the April 2007 flooding did reinvigorate efforts to complete the flood levee protection system around Bound Brook, to protect it from future flooding. Flooding of downtown occurred in August 2011 when Hurricane Irene passed along the East Coast. Current status # The R2 levee system is functionally complete ‚Äì The R2 Levee System is designed to provide Bound Brook with protection from a 150-year flood level. The levee is built to the height of the raised Talmage Avenue Bridge. # Closure gates along Raritan are functionally complete ‚Äì The gate closures across the New Jersey Transit railroad tracks on the western side of Bound Brook and at the South Main Street railroad underpass that leads to Queens Bridge have been completed and are used to keep flood waters out of Bound Brook. # The new Talmadge Avenue Bridge that connects Bound Brook and Bridgewater, New Jersey is functionally complete. The replacement bridge was built to the height of the R2 Levee to prevent Middle Brook and Raritan River waters from entering Bound Brook from the west. # To improve water flow through Bound Brook, the former Conrail bridge over the Raritan River and its associated railroad embankment that were located east of Bound Brook were removed during 2007. The bridge and embankment, when they were in place, acted to block the river flow through the Bound Brook area. To build the main Bound Brook R2 levee, the bridge and embankment needed to be removed. February Meeting Minutes Finderne Wetlands mitigation project The Finderne Wetlands mitigation project Finderne Wetlands Mitigation Project (also known as Finderne Farms) is a wetlands project upstream of Bound Brook in Bridgewater, New Jersey that is tied into the Green Brook Flood Control project. When completed, Finderne Farms will serve as a Somerset County park with trails through wetlands and ballfields. More importantly, Finderne Farms will serve as an upstream wetland that will help to reduce flooding in the Raritan River valley by providing space for floodwaters to pool. A roadway bridge called the Sebrings Bridge, which crosses the Green Brook and links the towns of Green Brook and Middlesex, is in the process of being replaced, as part of the Green Brook Flood Control project. The bridge currently slows water flow in the Green Brook during periods of high water runoff and causes flooding in the areas upstream of the bridge. The new bridge will be widened and raised to ease water flow. Federal funding is in place for Fiscal Year 2014 for the bridge replacement. Replacement of the bridge also will allow for additional future flood mitigation measures in the areas adjacent to the bridge, such as additional flood walls and levees.

In the 1890s the Northern Pacific Railroad located a station and switching yard on the eastern shore of the basin. The first proposal for creating Capitol Lake came when Leopold Schmidt of the Olympia Brewing Company proposed in 1895 to \\" mak(e) a fresh water lake of it by building a dam and locks near the Westside (Olympia) bridge.\\" History of the Olympia Brewing Company In 1911, the State Capitol Commission held a nationwide competition for the design of the State Capitol Campus. The winning architects, Wilder and White, submitted a revolutionary City Beautiful movement and American Renaissance plan which included creating a body of water to reflect the Capitol Group of buildings on the bluff by installing a tidelock at the mouth of the Deschutes River. A more limited lake was also part of the original landscape design by John Olmsted to reflect the Washington State Capitol building on Puget Sound. The lake as envisioned by Olmsted would have been created with a north to south running berm, as opposed to an east to west running dam.Original Capitol Planners Called For Free Flowing Deschutes River , Squaxin Island Tribe In 1915, the State Capitol Commission rejected a plan by former Olympia Mayor and state legislator P.H. Carlyon to replace Olympia's bridge to the westside with a dam and locks.The myth of connection between Wilder and White and Capitol Lake, Olympia Historical Society That plan would have created a lake very much like the present Capitol Lake. Because of opposition from upriver Tumwater businesses, such as the Olympia Brewing Company and the Olympia Power and Light Company, that plan was not approved. The Capitol Group of buildings was constructed over several years from 1913 to 1940, and the State Capitol Committee then turned to the task of creating the Wilder and White reflecting Capitol Lake. In 1937, the state began purchasing the privately owned tidelands around the Capitol Campus.Capitol Lake Timeline, Save Capitol Lake In 1941, opposition from Tumwater was finally overcome during a special town meeting. In 1947, due in large part by intense lobbying by Thurston County legislators, the state legislature approved funding for the construction of the dam in order to create Capitol Lake. A shantytown known as \\"Little Hollywood\\" developed along the shores of the Deschutes River, at the foot of the Capitol Campus. The people living in the shanties dumped raw human waste and trash directly into the Deschutes River. This became an eyesore (July 7, 1948, The Daily Olympian) and probably a health hazard. Damming the Deschutes River destroyed the estuary, but also prevented the urban blight of the shantytown from recurring.History of Capitol Lake, by WA State Dept. of Enterprise Services https://www.des.wa.gov/about/pi/CapitolLake/Pages/CapitolLakeHistory.aspx Capitol Lake was finally created in 1951 when the dam was completed consistent with the Wilder and White plan. This allowed for the retention of the outflow from the Deschutes River to cover the tide flats. Railroad bridge crossing Capitol Lake. In the 1990s and 2000s, the North Capitol Campus Heritage Park was created with the Arc of Statehood from the Western Washington Inlet to the Eastern Washington Butte along the eastern edge of Capitol Lake and the North Campus trail and Law Enforcement Memorial with views across Capitol Lake to the borrowed landscapes of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. The February 2001 Nisqually earthquake did considerable damage to the 4th Avenue Bridge just north of the lake, as well as to the Deschutes Parkway on the west side of the lake.https://www.trpc.org/DocumentCenter/View/4151/Earthquake?bidId=Photos of earthquake damage from UW Capital Lakefair, centered on the lake, is held annually in July.Lake Fair official website. The trail around the lake is 1.5 miles long.Capitol Lake website. =Recommendation for Estuary Restoration= In 2009, after 12 years of intensive and independently verified scientific study, members of the Capitol Lake Aspect Insight Management reached a consensus regarding the Department of Natural Resource's efforts to remove the 5th Ave. dam and restore Deschutes Estuary. The DNR put out a report, and on page 6, issued this recommendation, stating: \\"The Department of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Ecology, Department of Natural Resources, Squaxin Island Tribe, and a majority of the Thurston County Commissioners are forwarding their recommendation to return the Capitol Lake Basin to an estuary.\\"https://www.des.wa.gov/SiteCollectionDocuments/About/CapitolLake/24-SteeringCommitteeRecommendation(September2009).pdf In response, CLAIM argued that the invasive species New Zealand Mud Snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) found within the lake are at such high quantities, that their potential to cause \\"unpredictable environmental degradation\\" suggests that their release into the Southern region of the Puget Sound should be avoided at all costs. Biologist Howard Durrael, employee at CLAIM had this to say: \\"We are undergoing efforts to manage the invasive mud snail population, but until population levels decrease by at minimum 78%, there can be no activity within or around the Lake.\\" Looking north along Capitol Lake. Because of a high rate of siltation, the lake has been dredged periodically in the past to keep it from filling in. After a 25-year hiatus, in 2011 the State Legislature appropriated $200,000 in order to seek permits to reimplement maintenance dredging in order to retain and improve Capitol Lake as part of the historic Wilder and White design of the State Capitol Campus during its centennial year.  Invasive Species  In 2009, the New Zealand mud snail, an invasive species the size of a grain of rice, was discovered in Capitol Lake. The lake has been closed to all public use, including boating and other recreation, since 2009. A heavy cold snap in 2013, combined with a drawdown in water level in preparation, was roughly estimated to have killed 40‚Äì60% of the mudsnail population.http://www.invasivespecies.wa.gov/documents/2011%20Invasive%20Species%20Council%20Annual%20Report.pdf An infestation of Eurasian milfoil was controlled using herbicide in 2004. Later efforts relied on scuba divers to remove this invasive plant. Controversy Controversy surrounds Capitol Lake because it replaced the Deschutes River estuary. Because of a high rate of siltation, the lake was dredged periodically in the past to keep it from filling in, a classic case of eutrophication. Additionally, poor water quality has caused the lake to be closed to swimmers due to unsafe levels of E. coli.https://fortress.wa.gov/ecy/publications/publications/1203008.pdf In June 2012, the Washington State Department of Ecology released a report titled: Deschutes River, Capitol Lake, and Budd Inlet Temperature, Fecal Coliform Bacteria, Dissolved Oxygen, pH, and Fine Sediment Total Maximum Daily Load Technical Report - Water Quality Study Findings by scientists; Mindy Roberts, Anise Ahmed, Greg Pelletier, and David Osterberg This study provided information in a question and answer format.

This is often referred to as an ordered set, though that is an ambiguous term that many authors reserve for partially ordered sets or totally ordered sets. The term pre-ordered set is unambiguous, and is always synonymous with a mathematical hierarchy. The term hierarchy is used to stress a hierarchical relation among the elements. Sometimes, a set comes equipped with a natural hierarchical structure. For example, the set of natural numbers N is equipped with a natural pre-order structure, where n \\\\le n' whenever we can find some other number m so that n + m = n'. That is, n' is bigger than n only because we can get to n' from n using m. This is true for any commutative monoid. On the other hand, the set of integers Z requires a more sophisticated argument for its hierarchical structure, since we can always solve the equation n + m = n' by writing m = (n'-n). A mathematical hierarchy (a pre-ordered set) should not be confused with the more general concept of a hierarchy in the social realm, particularly when one is constructing computational models which are used to describe real-world social, economic or political systems. These hierarchies, or complex networks, are much too rich to be described in the category Set of sets.We may need a bigger topos. This is not just a pedantic claim; there are also mathematical hierarchies which are not describable using set theory. Another natural hierarchy arises in computer science, where the word refers to partially ordered sets whose elements are classes of objects of increasing complexity. In that case, the preorder defining the hierarchy is the class-containment relation. Containment hierarchies are thus special cases of hierarchies. Related terminology Individual elements of a hierarchy are often called levels and a hierarchy is said to be infinite if it has infinitely many distinct levels but said to collapse if it has only finitely many distinct levels. Example In theoretical computer science, the time hierarchy is a classification of decision problems according to the amount of time required to solve them.

It is composed of four books of three pieces each; a complete performance lasts about 90 minutes. It is Alb√©niz's best-known work and considered his masterpiece. It was highly praised by Claude Debussy and Olivier Messiaen, who said: \\"Iberia is the wonder for the piano; it is perhaps on the highest place among the more brilliant pieces for the king of instruments\\". Stylistically, this suite falls squarely in the school of Impressionism, especially in its musical evocations of Spain. Score of El Corpus Christi en Sevilla, which gives an idea of the complexity of the writing for piano. It is considered one of the most challenging works for the piano: \\"There is really nothing in Isaac Albeniz's Iberia that a good three- handed pianist could not master, given unlimited years of practice and permission to play at half tempo. But there are few pianists thus endowed.\\" Composition =Book 1= Dedicated to Ernest Chausson's wife. * Evocaci√≥n (\\"Evocation\\", A minor and A major), an impressionist reminiscence of Alb√©niz's native country, combining elements of the southern Spanish fandango and the northern Spanish jota song forms. The rarely seen seven-flat key signature is itself part of the Evocaci√≥n. * El Puerto (D major), a zapateado inspired by El Puerto de Santa Mar√≠a, in C√°diz. * F√™te-dieu √† Seville (F minor and F major) (alternative titles sometimes found: Corpus Christi; El Corpus en Sevilla), describing the Corpus Christi Day procession in Seville, during which the Corpus Christi is carried through the streets accompanied by marching bands. Musically, this piece consists of a processional march that eventually becomes overwhelmed by a mournful saeta, the melody evoking Andalusian cante jondo and the accompaniment evoking flamenco guitars. The march and saeta alternate ever more loudly until the main march theme is restated as a lively tarantella that ends abruptly with a flamboyant fffff climactic chord; the piece concludes with a gentle coda again evoking flamenco guitars along with distant church bells. =Book 2= Ronde√±a, from Book II. * Ronde√±a (D major), after the Andalusian town of Ronda. A variant of the fandango, it is characterized by the alternation of measures of and . * Almer√≠a (G major), relating to the Andalusian seaport of Almer√≠a, is loosely based on tarantas, a flamenco form characteristic of the region of Almer√≠a. * Triana (F minor), after the Gypsy quarter of Seville. =Book 3= * El Albaic√≠n (B minor and B major) * El Polo (F minor) * Lavapi√©s (D major), after the district of Madrid. =Book 4= * M√°laga (B minor and B major) * Jerez (A minor ‚Äì arguably E Phrygian ‚Äì and E major) * Erita√±a (E major) Premiere performance The twelve pieces were first performed by the French pianist Blanche Selva, but each book was premiered in a different place and on a different date. Three of the performances were in Paris, the other being in a small town in the south of France. * Book I: May 9, 1906, Salle Pleyel, Paris * Book II: September 11, 1907, Saint-Jean-de-Luz * Book III: January 2, 1908, Palace of Princess de Polignac, Paris * Book IV: February 9, 1909, Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique, Paris. Recordings Among notable early recordings, pieces from Iberia were recorded by Arthur Rubinstein. Iberia was first recorded in its entirety by Alicia de Larrocha in 1958-9 (Hispavox / Erato DUE 20236/37, [EMI 64504?]). She recorded it twice more, in 1972 (London 448191 and 433926), and 1989 (London 417887). Luis Fernando P√©rez recording has been highly acclaimed and earned him the Alb√©niz Medal. It has also been recorded by Claudio Arrau (Books 1 and 2 only), Gustavo D√≠az-Jerez, Miguel Baselga, Ricardo Requejo, Michel Block, Guillermo Gonz√°lez (according to his own critical edition of the score), Marc-Andr√© Hamelin, Yvonne Loriod, Artur Pizarro, Jean-Fran√ßois Heisser, Esteban S√°nchez, and √Ångel Sanzo among others. Arrangements page=1 Enrique Fern√°ndez Arb√≥s and Carlos Surinach each arranged pieces from Iberia for full orchestra. There is an orchestral arrangement of the F√™te-dieu √† Seville by Leopold Stokowski, from the mid-1920s, which he recorded with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1928. More recently, Peter Breiner arranged the whole work for full orchestra. The composer Francisco Guerrero Mar√≠n, calling Iberia \\"the greatest Spanish work in the last hundred years\\", also made an arrangement of six pieces before his death in 1997. A version for three guitars was made by Christophe Dejour and recorded by Trio Campanella. A two-guitar overdubbing version has been released by French guitarist Jean-Marc Zvellenreuther.

He previously served as a front office executive for the Cleveland Browns, Baltimore Ravens, New York Jets, New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs. Pioli served as the Director - and later Vice President - of Player Personnel for the Patriots from 2001 to 2008 when the franchise won three Super Bowl championships. Early years Pioli grew up in Washingtonville, New York and attended Washingtonville High School, where he played linebacker and defensive line before graduating in 1983. Between 1983 and 1988 he attended Central Connecticut State University, graduating in 1988 with a degree in communications. He was a three-time Division II All-New England selection as a defensive tackle. In 2005, Central Connecticut inducted Pioli into their hall of fame. In 1988, after graduating with a degree in communications, he accepted a two-year graduate assistant position at Syracuse University, where he also earned a master's degree from the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. Pioli served as a graduate assistant with the Syracuse football team from 1988 to 1989. In 1990, he began a two-year stint at Murray State University as an offensive line coach in his first year (1990) and as a defensive line coach in his second year (1991). Professional executive career =Cleveland Browns/Baltimore Ravens= In 1992, Pioli was hired as a pro personnel assistant by Bill Belichick, then the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. Pioli's relationship with Belichick dated back to the mid-1980s, when as a student at Central Connecticut, Pioli would drive 90 minutes to the New York Giants training camp. Through a mutual friend, Pioli was introduced to then-Giants defensive coordinator Belichick, who was impressed at Pioli's dedication to travel to each practice and offered him a place to stay. In Cleveland, Pioli was responsible for the evaluation of both college prospects and veteran free agents, as well as negotiating various player contracts. When the Browns moved to Baltimore after the 1995 season, Pioli stayed with the team and was promoted to Pro Personnel Coordinator for the Ravens' 1996 season and was part of the personnel staff that drafted HOFer Jonathan Ogden and Ray Lewis. =New York Jets= In 1997, Pioli rejoined Belichick and was hired by the New York Jets as the team's Director of Pro Personnel. Pioli was credited with the signing of a number of veteran free agents, including Kevin Mawae, Vinny Testaverde and Bryan Cox, who played critical roles in the Jets' rebuilding process which helped the team rebound from a 1‚Äì15 record in 1996 to a 12‚Äì4 record in 1998. The 1998 Jets recorded a franchise-high 12 wins and their first division title since 1968. =New England Patriots= 2007 Patriots training camp When Belichick accepted the Patriots' head coaching position in 2000, Pioli became vice president of player personnel. The two eventually became the first personnel director/head coach tandem in league annals to win three Super Bowls during a four-year span (2001-2004). He and Belichick split the duties usually held by a general manager on most other NFL teams, though Belichick had the final say.Bell, Jarrett. Piecing the Patriots together. USA Today, April 21, 2005. Pioli's skills as a talent evaluator helped create a consistent championship contender in New England. He was regularly recognized for his ability to build a team, not simply collecting individual talent, helping to make the Patriots a \\"model franchise.\\" From 2000-2008, the Patriots had an NFL-best record of 102‚Äì42 (.708) and registered 14 playoff victories. Pioli worked in close coordination with Belichick, bringing players to the Patriots who fit into the framework of the club's team concept. Pioli and Belichick's teams were noted for the depth of talent at all the positions and used an effective combination of draft picks, free-agent signings, and trades to continually upgrade their roster. The most-notable selection in an NFL Draft by Pioli and Belichick was quarterback Tom Brady, who was chosen 199th overall in the 2000 NFL Draft. In his tenure with the Patriots, Pioli earned promotions from Assistant Director of Player Personnel to Director of Player Personnel in 2001, and to Vice President of Player Personnel in 2002. Also, Pioli earned a contract extension in 2005 after being pursued by several NFL teams to become general manager. In 2007, the Patriots finished their regular season with a 16-0 record, a first in NFL history. The team advanced to Super Bowl XLII but lost famously to the New York Giants 17‚Äì14 and failed to finish the season with a perfect 19‚Äì0 record. Prior to the season, Pioli executed trades to acquire wide receivers Wes Welker and Randy Moss, both of whom helped the Patriots set multiple NFL records on offense. =Kansas City Chiefs= 2009 After the 2008 Patriots season, Pioli was interviewed by the Cleveland Browns to replace the recently fired Phil Savage as the team's general manager. Though initially seen as a long-shot, Pioli was also interviewed by the Kansas City Chiefs and was reportedly the number one candidate to succeed Carl Peterson as general manager. The Chiefs confirmed that Pioli was hired on January 13, 2009. Later that day, Belichick released the following statement to the press: Pioli was introduced at a press conference in Kansas City the following day. On January 23, 2009, Pioli fired head coach Herman Edwards. To replace Edwards, Pioli hired Arizona Cardinals offensive coordinator Todd Haley as head coach on February 5, 2009. 2010 Following the season, Pioli hired former Notre Dame head coach Charlie Weis as offensive coordinator and former Cleveland Browns head coach Romeo Crennel as defensive coordinator; both held the same roles in New England for each of the three Super Bowl winning seasons during Pioli's tenure with the Patriots. In 2010, the Chiefs won their first AFC West division title since 2003 and completed the season 10‚Äì6. The move from worst to first in the AFC West earned him NFL Executive of the Year honors. 2011 The Chiefs were 7‚Äì9 in the 2011 season. Chiefs main passing receiver Tony Moeaki was injured in the last preseason game (against Green Bay which the Chiefs lost 20‚Äì19. The Chiefs were 4‚Äì3 in Week 8 after a four-game winning streak. Matt Cassel broke his hand in Week 13 in a loss against Denver and was out for the remainder of the season. After a 37‚Äì10 loss to the New York Jets in Week 14, Pioli fired coach Haley and elevated defense coordinator Crennel to acting coach. In Week 15, the Chiefs stunned the defending Super Bowl champion Packers 19‚Äì14 in the Packers only defeat of the regular season. The Chiefs remained mathematically eligible for the AFC West championship in a weak division clear to the next to the last week of the season and they defeated the eventual AFC West winner Denver Broncos in the final game of the season. 2012 Pioli's final year in Kansas City was fraught with controversy and fan unrest as the Chiefs floundered to franchise-worst 2‚Äì14 season in 2012, securing their first #1 pick in team history. In January, Kansas City Star reporter Kent Babb published a piece that interviewed former Chiefs' head coach Todd Haley in which Haley indicated his belief that the team had bugged his personal cell phone. Other employees referenced team security walking the halls of the offices to ensure that office blinds were always drawn during practice to not avoid giving away information, and one fan referenced threats of having personal belongings, like cellular phones, confiscated. Such behaviors were attributed to Pioli's desire to maintain absolute secrecy about the facility. Pioli's administrative practices were also the subject of an age-discrimination lawsuit, which is currently under review. Early in the season, a group of disgruntled Kansas City fans organized a movement, which called itself \\"Save Our Chiefs.\\". It engaged in several protests on Pioli's tenure, including a local pilot to fly over Arrowhead Stadium towing banners, urging for Pioli's ouster, during multiple home games. Pioli was the first person to confront Jovan Belcher on December 1, 2012. He walked to the entrance of the team's practice area, adjoining Arrowhead, pointing to where Belcher had a gun pointed at his head. Belcher had killed his girlfriend a few minutes earlier. Pioli was joined by Chiefs coach Romeo Crennel. Belcher shot himself in the head and was reported to have told Pioli, \\"I came here to tell you thank you...Thank you for my chance. I love you, bro.\\" Pioli had signed Belcher as an undrafted free agent in 2009 and gave a eulogy at Belcher's Kansas City funeral service.http://www.kansascity.com/2013/01/04/3988337/scott-piolis-career-as- chiefs.html The Chiefs won the game the following day against the Carolina Panthers, the only home game victory of the season. There were no protests on the day of the game, and both Crennel and Pioli received positive comments on how they had handled the situation. Both Crennel and Pioli were fired at the end of the season; Pioli was formally fired on January 4, 2013. The Chiefs had six players on the 2013 Pro Bowl team (Eric Berry, strong safety; Jamaal Charles, running back who set various NFL and franchise records during the season; Dustin Colquitt, punter; Tamba Hali, outside linebacker; Derrick Johnson, inside/middle linebacker); Justin Houston, outside linebacker). Berry and Hali were designated starters. However, only two of the six players were acquired by Pioli. Only three NFL teams had more Pro Bowl picks San Francisco (9), Houston (8), New England (7). The three teams made the playoffs. =Atlanta Falcons= 2014 Pioli was hired as the assistant GM of the Falcons on January 22, 2014.http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/10331790/scott- pioli-hired-atlanta-falcons-assistant-general-manager The team announced his resignation on May 16, 2019.

As is the case with all Norwegian dialects, it has no standardised orthography, and its users write either Bokm√•l, or in the case of 0.6% Nynorsk.http://www.sprakradet.no/Vi-og- vart/Publikasjoner/Spraaknytt/Arkivet/Spraaknytt_1996/Spraaknytt_1996_1/Nynorsk_i_Noreg_i_dag/ It is spoken in the region Tr√∏ndelag, the district Nordm√∏re and the municipality Bindal in Norway as well as in Frostviken in northern J√§mtland, Sweden, which was colonized in the 18th century by settlers from Nord- Tr√∏ndelag and transferred to Sweden as late as 1751. The dialect is, among other things, perhaps mostly characterized by the use of apocope, palatalization and the use of voiced retroflex flaps (thick L). Historically it also applied to contiguous regions of J√§mtland and H√§rjedalen (which sometimes but rarely are referred to as \\"√òst-Tr√∏ndelag\\" by locals and Norwegians). The word tr√∏ndersk is an adjective describing a Tr√∏nder (a person from Tr√∏ndelag) or anything coming from or relating to Tr√∏ndelag (including the dialect). Some of the more conspicuous variations of these dialects of Norwegian, in addition to the aforementioned apocope and palatalization, are that most of the personal pronouns are pronounced differently than in Standard Norwegian, e.g. Trondheim dialect: 1st person singular nominative , commonly rendered as \\"√¶\\" (Standard Norwegian \\"eg\\" (Nynorsk) / \\"jeg\\" (Bokm√•l)), or 2nd person plural accusative or , commonly spelled \\"dokker\\" or \\"d√•kker\\" (Standard Norwegian \\"dykk\\" (Nynorsk) / \\"dere\\" (Bokm√•l)). Variation among personal pronouns are common in most Norwegian dialects. Phonology Tr√∏ndersk features phonemic pitch accent in monosyllabic words, namely those that were disyllabic in Old Norse but later became monosyllabic due to apocope. This creates minimal pairs not found in most other varieties of Norwegian. In dialects with the dative case an example of that would be the difference between the dative form of a neuter noun as compared with the nominative form - the latter is pronounced with Tone 1, whereas the former often has Tone 2. Outsiders are rarely able to hear the distinction between them as in most other varieties of Norwegian (and Swedish) pitch accent is phonemic only in non-final syllables of polysyllabic words. The Meldal subdialect has a very original realization of , which is a syllabic, palatalized frictionless dental approximant . This sound is also found in some dialects of Swedish. In the subdialect of the traditional district of Namdalen, Old Norse is often realized as a wide diphthong . This is also the case in the interior dialect Sogn, as well as in Jamtlandic, the dialect of Voss, and the Icelandic language.

The company was active between 1983 and 1991, and shut down completely in early 1992.  History  In the early 1980s, Jim Mackonochie worked as development manager for British communications company Mirror Group Newspapers. On a trip to the U.S., Mackonochie got a hold of a Commodore PET personal computer, alongside a copy of VisiCalc, a spreadsheet application for the system. This combination led him to believe that Mirror, as a communications company, should be working more closely with computer software, wherefore he approached Mirror's board of directors in 1983, suggesting that they launch a software label under Mirror Group's name, and thereby diversifying the group's non-newspaper operations, which already included Mirror Boats and Mirror Books. The division, named Mirrorsoft, was officially launched in late 1983, and Mackonochie was allowed to task several of his staff from his department at Mirror Group to aid him with establishing the division. On 12 July 1984, Mirror Group was acquired by Robert Maxwell-owned Maxwell Communications. Initially, Mirrorsoft was unaffected by the ownership change, until Mackonochie received a call from Maxwell's son, Kevin, on Boxing Day 1984, in which he was told that he would be permanently moved from development manager of Mirror Group to full-time managing director of Mirrorsoft. On 5 November 1991, Robert Maxwell died after having previously disappeared from his yacht. Unaware of his fate, Mirrorsoft continued operations as usual, including the publishing of First Samurai, Mega-Lo-Mania and Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: The Coin-Op through Image Works and good projections for Christmas sales. However, subsequent to Maxwell's death, Maxwell Communications declared bankruptcy in 1992. Arthur Andersen was appointed administrator for Maxwell's companies, including Mirrorsoft, near the end of November. With the arrival of the administrators, they took over all day-to-day operations at the company, and shut down all Mirrorsoft sales, the division's only source of revenue. Several visits from potential buyers, including Infogrames and MicroProse, were arranged hastily, and a management buyout was considered, but the easiest option was found to be closing the company down and selling off its assets. The majority of Mirrorsoft's staff was laid off on New Year's Eve 1991, with a remaining few being kept for further 1‚Äì2 months to help with winding down the company. Several business assets were subsequently sold to Acclaim Entertainment.

Born on October 21, 1820, in Cambridge, Indiana he was a lawyer, a farmer and a newspaper editor before he entered politics. He was appointed governor of Utah Territory. Newspaper career Dawson, along with T.N. Hood, leased George W. Wood's interest in the Fort Wayne Times and People's Press for one year, starting on September 7, 1853. They changed the name to the Fort Wayne Times and continued to publish until Hood sold his interest to Dawson and Wood. Wood retired in 1854, leaving Dawson in charge of the paper. In 1854, the Times had a decidedly Anti-Nebraska sentiment while Thomas Tigar's Fort Wayne Sentinel had the opposite attitude. Dawson's political issues included being anti-abolition, temperance, free public schools, and various Know-nothing/Fusion Party/People's Party issues. The paper continued in various forms until 1865, when Dawson sold the paper to Henry Dills and Isaac W. Campbell. In 1866, the paper merged with the Fort Wayne Sentinel. Political career Dawson ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Indiana House of Representatives in 1854, Secretary of State of Indiana in 1856, and United States Congress in 1858. He started as a Democrat, but later became a Republican. Utah Governor Abraham Lincoln named him governor of Utah Territory in 1861, but he left the territory and his post as governor after only three weeks due to tensions with the Mormon residents. Dawson allegedly made \\"grossly improper proposals\\" to the Mormon widow Albina Merrill Williams, who responded by thrashing him with a fire shovel. Taking a mail coach eastward, he arrived at Ephraim Hanks' Pony Express station at Mountain Dell, Utah. There, Hanks assured Dawson he was now safe. However a group of young Mormon vigilantes named Jason Luce, Martin \\"Matt\\" Luce, Wilford Luce, Wood Reynolds, Moroni Clawson, Lot Hungtington, and Isaac Neibaur followed the retreating governor, and during a night of drinking, they plundered the governor's baggage, and attacked him, beating and kicking Dawson about the head, chest, and groin (and allegedly castrating one of his testicles).

In Game 4 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals on May 26, 2002, Walker made a 3-pointer at the end of halftime; by then the Sacramento Kings led over the Lakers 65-51. Although the shot counted, television replays showed Walker had released the ball after the buzzer went off. The Lakers won the game 100-99 on a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from Horry that tied the series at 2. The Lakers then won the series in 7 to advance to the Finals. Walker's shot influenced the NBA's decision to institute instant replay for review the following season. The Lakers reached the NBA Finals, defeating the New Jersey Nets in a four-game sweep to win their third straight championship and give Walker his first and only championship ring. Shaq has credited Walker for his contributions to the Lakers championship run, namely his play against Chris Webber of the Kings during the Western Conference Finals series.Open Court: Most Hated Matchups The following year, Walker was now the primary backup behind O'Neal and Horry, but still started in 39 of 67 games. The Lakers three‚Äìyear reign as champions ended with a loss to the Spurs in the conference semifinals. He became a free agent after the season, and the Lakers opted to sign Karl Malone and draft Brian Cook, effectively ending his run in Los Angeles.Walker Is Expected To Join Miami Today =Later years and international play= Walker signed as a free agent with the Miami Heat in 2003.Heat sign free agent forward Walker The following season, he signed with the Washington Wizards.

Under their rule, the Astur-Leonese kingdom went from a small mountain enclave to one of the dominant powers in Hispania. The first ruling family of Asturias lasted only two generations: Pelagius (718‚Äì737) and Fafila (737‚Äì739). The latter was succeeded by his brother-in-law, Alfonso I, the son of Duke Peter of Cantabria and wife of Fafila's sister, Ermesinda. He founded a dynasty that was to last almost 300 years.Roger Collins, The Arab Conquest of Spain, 710‚Äì797 (Basil Blackwell, 1989), pp. 151‚Äì152. For the first century, rule alternated between Alfonso's descendants and those of his brother, Fruela of Cantabria. With the death of Alfonso I's grandson, Alfonso II (842), Fruela's descendants took the throne permanently, headed by Ramiro I. At the death of Alfonso III (910), the kingdom was divided between his sons. The 10th century was thus characterized by family infighting, which was only brought to an end by the succession of Bermudo II in 984. During this period, however, the power of the neighbouring Kingdom of Pamplona waxed and in 1034 the Pamplonans captured Le√≥n. The rule of the dynasty was brought to an end three years later when Bermudo III was killed in battle against his brother-in-law, Ferdinand of Castile, of the Jim√©nez dynasty of Pamplona, who thereafter assumed the throne. The historiography produced by and for the dynasty, such as the Chronicle of Alfonso III (late 9th century), made Duke Peter a descendant of the Visigothic king Reccared I and stressed the dynasty's supposed Gothic descent.Julio Escalona, \\"Family Memories: Inventing Alfonso I of Asturias\\", in Building Legitimacy: Political Discourses and Forms of Legitimation in Medieval Societies, ed.

He also played grade cricket for Petersham- Marrickville in the Sydney grade cricket competition. He is the brother-in-law of former Australian swing bowler Terry Alderman. After making his first-class umpiring debut in the 1982‚Äì83 season, Emerson was promoted to the National Umpires panel in 1993‚Äì94. He made his ODI debut in a match between Sri Lanka and the West Indies in Brisbane in January, 1996. He immediately became controversial, no-balling Muralitharan seven times, and continuing to do so even when he switched to bowling legbreaks, which are regarded as being impossible to throw. This led to Muralitharan being dropped by Sri Lanka for the rest of the tour, as he was unable to bowl without being called. Emerson continued to officiate in ODIs for the next three years, standing in nine more games, all in Australia, but it was his last game which overshadowed even the first. On 23 January 1999 in Adelaide, standing at square leg, Emerson once again called Muralitharan, leading to Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga to lead his team off the field in protest and consult team management and the match referee. The match later continued after Emerson threatened to award the match to England, with Muralitharan confined to bowling legbreaks; Emerson claimed that cricket was controlled by Asian countries. Mahela Jayawardene went on to score a century and the Sri Lankans won in the last over with Muralitharan scoring the final runs. Emerson was subsequently stood down, and then was not reappointed to officiate again, claimed he had been asked to no- ball Murali by an Australian official and was ignored once the incident became a major issue. \\"I was called to a meeting with him (Australian Cricket Board Official) and, knowing that I had called some other players, he told me I had set standards in certain areas which I should uphold in Adelaide\\" Emerson said. \\"Yet everything blew up after I called Murali and when I saw him again he wouldn't even look at me\\". He subsequently retired from cricket, and as of November 2004, is the president of Swimming Western Australia. However, he remained defiant, saying that Muralitharan's action was \\"worse than ever\\". However, cricket commentator Peter Roebuck labelled Emerson a \\"nincompoop\\". As of early 2011, Emerson is working as a senior investigator in the corporate governance directorate of the Department of Health of Western Australia.

Biography He was born in Pau, Navarre (now in France). Gast√≥n de Peralta was appointed viceroy of New Spain in 1566, replacing Francisco Ceinos and the Audiencia Real of Mexico, which had been governing on an interim basis since the death of the previous viceroy, Lu√≠s de Velasco. After the death of Velasco, a conspiracy to obtain independence from Spain was discovered. Some personalities of high position, including some close relatives of Hern√°n Cort√©s -- Mart√≠n, Don Mart√≠n Cort√©s y de Zu√±iga, and Lu√≠s (his sons, and half-brothers of each other) -- were involved in this plot. It was made known to Peralta while he was still at the coast in Veracruz, before he entered Mexico City to take up his office officially. A local judge of the Audiencia Real of M√©xico had sentenced the conspirators to death, but Peralta personally reviewed the cases of each of the prisoners and suspended the death penalty for Lu√≠s and Mart√≠n Cort√©s. They were sent back to Spain to be dealt with by the Council of the Indies. Peralta arrived in Mexico City in a tense atmosphere. One of his first acts was to remove the artillery and soldiers that had been posted at the viceroy's palace and in the principle streets of the city. His leniency toward the conspirators alarmed the Audiencia, which accused him of sympathizing with the rebels and protecting them. Testimony was given that the new viceroy had a list of 30,000 rebel fighters ready to rise against the Crown. These accusations were communicated to Spanish king Philip II in a letter. Alarmed, King Philip dispatched two visitadores, Luis Carrillo and Lic. Alonso Mu√±oz, to New Spain to investigate the charges. They ordered Peralta back to Spain to explain his conduct.

Ferdinand was crowned a Tsar at the Declaration of Independence, mainly because of his military plans and for seeking options for unification of all lands in the Balkans region with an ethnic Bulgarian majority (lands that had been seized from Bulgaria and given to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Berlin). The state was almost constantly at war throughout its existence, lending to its nickname as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". For several years Bulgaria mobilized an army of more than 1 million people from its population of about 5 million and in the 1910s it engaged in three wars ‚Äì the First and Second Balkan Wars, and the First World War. Following the First World War, the Bulgarian army was disbanded and forbidden to exist by the Allied Powers, and all plans for national unification of the Bulgarian lands failed. Less than two decades later Bulgaria once again went to war for national unification as part of the Second World War, and once again found itself on the losing side, until it switched sides to the Allies in 1944. In 1946, the monarchy was abolished, its final Tsar was sent into exile and the Kingdom was replaced by the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Formation Ferdinand I of Bulgaria at the proclamation of Bulgarian independence, 1908 Despite the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria (subject to Ottoman suzerainty) in 1878, and the subsequent Bulgarian control over Eastern Rumelia after 1885, there was still a substantial Bulgarian population in the Balkans living under Ottoman rule, particularly in Macedonia. To complicate matters, Serbia and Greece too made claims over parts of Macedonia, while Serbia, as a Slavic nation, also considered Macedonian Slavs as belonging to the Serbian nation. Thus began a three-sided struggle for control of these areas which lasted until World War I. In 1903, there was a Bulgarian insurrection in Ottoman Macedonia and war seemed likely. In 1908, Ferdinand used the struggles among the Great Powers to declare Bulgaria an independent kingdom with himself as Tsar. He did this on 5 October (though celebrated on 22 September, as Bulgaria remained officially on the Julian Calendar until 1916) in the St Forty Martyrs Church in Veliko Tarnovo. Even before then, however, Bulgaria had only acknowledged the overlordship of the sultan in a formal way. Since 1878, Bulgaria had had its own constitution, flag and anthem, and conducted a separate foreign policy. Ferdinand took the Bulgarian title \\"Tsar\\" in honor of the rulers of the First and Second Bulgarian Empires. However, while previous Bulgarian \\"tsars\\" were reckoned as emperors, Ferdinand and his successors were called \\"king\\" outside Bulgaria. The Tarnovo Constitution was retained, with the word \\"tsar\\" replacing the word \\"prince.\\" The Balkan Wars In 1911, the Nationalist Prime Minister Ivan Geshov set about forming an alliance with Greece and Serbia, and the three allies agreed to put aside their rivalries to plan a joint attack on the Ottomans. Boundaries on the Balkans after the First and the Second Balkan War (1912‚Äì1913) ethnic Bulgarians were the majority of the population (in light green) in 1912 In February 1912 a secret treaty was signed between Bulgaria and Serbia, and in May 1912 a similar treaty was signed with Greece. Montenegro was also brought into the pact. The treaties provided for the partition of Macedonia and Thrace between the allies, although the lines of partition were left dangerously vague. After the Ottomans refused to implement reforms in the disputed areas, the First Balkan War broke out in October 1912. (See Balkan Wars for details.) The allies had an astonishing success. The Bulgarian army inflicted several crushing defeats on the Ottoman forces and advanced threateningly against Constantinople, while the Serbs and the Greeks took control of Macedonia. The Ottomans sued for peace in December. Negotiations broke down, and fighting resumed in February 1913. The Ottomans lost Adrianople to a Bulgarian task force. A second armistice followed in March, with the Ottomans losing all their European possessions west of the Midia-Enos line, not far from Istanbul. Bulgaria gained possession of most of Thrace, including Adrianople and the Aegean port of Dedeagach (today Alexandroupoli). Bulgaria also gained a slice of Macedonia, north and east of Thessaloniki, but only some small areas along her western borders. Bulgaria sustained the heaviest casualties of any of the allies, and on this basis felt entitled to the largest share of the spoils. The Serbs in particular did not see things this way, and refused to vacate any of the territory they had seized in northern Macedonia (that is, the territory roughly corresponding to the modern Republic of North Macedonia), stating that the Bulgarian army had failed to accomplish its pre-war goals at Adrianople (i.e., failing to capture it without Serbian help) and that the pre-war agreements on the division of Macedonia had to be revised. Some circles in Bulgaria inclined toward going to war with Serbia and Greece on this issue. In June 1913 Serbia and Greece formed a new alliance, against Bulgaria. The Serbian Prime Minister, Nikola Pasic, told Greece it could have Thrace if Greece helped Serbia keep Bulgaria out of Serbian part of Macedonia, and the Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos agreed. Seeing this as a violation of the pre-war agreements, and discreetly encouraged by Germany and Austria‚ÄìHungary, Tsar Ferdinand declared war on Serbia and Greece and the Bulgarian army attacked on June 29. The Serbian and the Greek forces were initially on the retreat on the western border, but they soon took the upper hand and forced Bulgaria into retreat. The fighting was very harsh, with many casualties, especially during the key Battle of Bregalnica. Soon Romania entered the war and attacked Bulgaria from the north. The Ottoman Empire also attacked from the south-east. The war was now definitely lost for Bulgaria, which had to abandon most of her claims of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece, while the revived Ottomans retook Adrianople. Romania took possession of southern Dobruja.  World War I  The largest territorial extent of the Kingdom of Bulgaria during World War I (including occupied territories) Bulgarian officers on the Macedonian front In the aftermath of the Balkan Wars, Bulgarian opinion turned against Russia and the western powers, whom the Bulgarians felt had done nothing to help them. Bulgaria, Romania and Greece were content to sit on the fence and observe the fortunes of war before deciding whether to declare their sympathies. The government of Vasil Radoslavov aligned Bulgaria with Germany and Austria‚ÄìHungary, even though this meant also becoming an ally of the Ottomans, Bulgaria's traditional enemy. But Bulgaria now had no claims against the Ottomans, whereas Serbia, Greece and Romania (allies of the UK and France) were all in possession of lands perceived in Bulgaria as Bulgarian. Bulgaria, recuperating from the Balkan Wars, sat out the first year of World War I, but when Germany promised to restore the boundaries of the Treaty of San Stefano, Bulgaria, which had the largest army in the Balkans, declared war on Serbia in October 1915. The UK, France, Italy and Russia then declared war on Bulgaria. Bulgaria, in alliance with Germany, Austria‚ÄìHungary and the Ottomans, won military victories against Serbia and Romania, taking much of Macedonia (taking Skopje in October), advancing into Greek Macedonia, and taking Dobruja from the Romanians in September 1916. However, the war soon became unpopular with the majority of Bulgarian people, who suffered great economic hardship and also disliked fighting their fellow Orthodox Christians in alliance with the Muslim Ottomans. The Agrarian Party leader, Aleksandar Stamboliyski, was imprisoned for his opposition to the war. The Russian Revolution of February 1917 had a great effect in Bulgaria, spreading antiwar and anti-monarchist sentiment among the troops and in the cities. In June Radoslavov's government resigned. Mutinies broke out in the army, Stamboliyski was released and a republic was proclaimed. In September 1918, the French, Serbs, British, Italians and Greeks broke through on the Macedonian front and Tsar Ferdinand was forced to sue for peace. Stamboliyski favoured democratic reforms, not a revolution. In order to head off the revolutionaries, he persuaded Ferdinand to abdicate in favour of his son Boris III. The revolutionaries were suppressed and the army disbanded. Under the Treaty of Neuilly (November 1919), Bulgaria lost its Aegean coastline to Greece and part of its Macedonian territory to the new state of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, and had to give Dobruja back to the Kingdom of Romania (see also Dobruja, Western Outlands, Western Thrace). Elections in March 1920 gave the Agrarians a large majority, and Stamboliyski formed Bulgaria's first genuinely democratic government. The interwar years Boris III of Bulgaria, who reigned from 1918 to 1943 = Political history = Territorial changes after the Treaty of Neuilly-sur- Seine Although it had not lost large amounts of territory, the nation had again struggled hard for nothing. The lost territories, especially the Dobroujea and Macedonia, were considered integral parts of Bulgaria and the pressure to retake them became an ultimately fatal obsession that drove the country into the arms of Nazi Germany. However, unlike the other defeated Eastern European state, Hungary, Bulgaria continued with essentially the same government as before. Stamboliyski faced huge social problems in what was still a poor country, inhabited mostly by peasant smallholders. Bulgaria was saddled with huge war reparations to Yugoslavia and Romania, and had to deal with the problem of refugees as pro-Bulgarian Macedonians had to leave the Yugoslav Macedonia. Nevertheless, Stamboliyski was able to carry through many social reforms, although opposition from the Tsar, the landlords and the officers of the much-reduced but still influential army was powerful. Another bitter enemy was the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (VMRO), which favoured a war to regain Macedonia for Bulgaria. Faced with this array of enemies, Stamboliyski allied himself with the Bulgarian Communist Party and opened relations with the Soviet Union. Aleksandar Stamboliyski The Bulgarian government had the same handicap as most constitutional monarchies, which was not drawing a clear line between what powers were granted to the king and what were granted to Parliament. The 1879 constitution was intended to put power in the hands of the latter, but still allowed a clever enough monarch to gain control of the machinery of government. Such was the case with the wily Tsar Ferdinand, who however had been forced to abdicate after the back-to-back losses of the Balkan Wars and World War I. His son Boris then succeeded him to the throne, but the young king could not replace the power his father had built through decades of intrigue. As such, Parliament came to dominate after Boris appointed Alexander Stamboliyski as prime minister. Stamboliyski's Agrarian Party soon dominated Parliament with over half the seats. The rest of the seats were taken by the Bulgarian Communist Party, which was the country's second largest political party and the only other one of any significance (there were a dozen or so minor parties, but they had no representation in Parliament or any real significance). The Agrarian Party chiefly represented peasants, and especially those who were disgruntled with the government in Sofia since Ferdinand's reign saw extensive corruption and theft of money from the peasantry. Also while most of the lower classes in Bulgaria supported annexation of Macedonia, they were disgruntled about the heavy bloodshed incurred in two unsuccessful wars to retake it. Indeed, Stamboliyski actually spent the war years in jail due to his vociferous criticism of it. As for the BCP, it was mainly staffed by intelligentsia and urban professionals, but its chief constituents were the poorest peasants and other minorities. The AP by comparison represented better-off peasants. Under this climate, Stamboliyski hastily enacted a land reform in 1920, which was designed to break up some state properties, church lands, and the holdings of wealthier peasants. Predictably, it gave him widespread support and forced the BCP into an alliance with the AP mainly to gain a voice in Parliament. However, Stamboliyski was a convinced anti-communist and sought to create an international movement to combat Marxism. This was his so-called \\"Green International\\", a counter to the communist \\"Red International\\". He traveled to Eastern European capitals promoting his view of a peasant alliance. But trouble began when he tried to spread it in Yugoslavia, a country that had very similar conditions to Bulgaria (i.e. very little industry and a large communist presence). Stamboliyski was well-liked in Belgrade because of supporting a peaceful solution to the Macedonia problem. He also advocated uniting all the Slavic-speaking nations in Eastern Europe into one large Yugoslav confederation. But he got into trouble because of the militant IMRO faction at home. Many Macedonian leaders had lived in Sofia since the failed 1903 revolt against the Ottoman Empire, and now they were joined by others who fled the Yugoslavian government (which maintained as its official position that Macedonians were ethnic Serbs). Since Bulgaria had been forced to limit the size of its armed forces after World War I, IMRO chieftains gained control of much of the border area with Yugoslavia. Aleksandar Tsankov In March 1923, Stamboliyski signed an agreement with Yugoslavia recognizing the new border and agreeing to suppress IMRO. This triggered a nationalist reaction, and on 9 June there was a coup organized by the armed forces under General Ivan Valkov's Military Union with support from the Tsar and other right wing elements of the Tsardom after the AP controlled 87% of Parliament in the elections that year. The Bulgarian government could only muster a handful of troops to resist, and even worse was a peasant mob with no guns rallied by Stamboliyski. Despite this, the streets of Sofia erupted in chaos and the hapless prime minister was lynched in addition to attacks on unarmed peasants. The whole affair seriously tarbrushed Bulgaria's international image. A right wing government under Aleksandar Tsankov took power, backed by the Tsar, the army and the VMRO, who waged a White terror against the Agrarians and the Communists. The Communist leader Georgi Dimitrov fled to the Soviet Union. There was savage repression in 1925 following the second of two failed attempts on the Tsar's life in the bomb attack on Sofia Cathedral (the first attempt took place in the mountain pass of Arabakonak). But in 1926 the Tsar persuaded Tsankov to resign and a more moderate government under Andrey Lyapchev took office. An amnesty was proclaimed, although the Communists remained banned. The Agrarians reorganised and won elections in 1931 under the leadership of Nikola Mushanov. Georgi Kyoseivanov Just when political stability had been restored, the full effects of the Great Depression hit Bulgaria, and social tensions rose again. In May 1934 there was another coup by the military organization Zveno, and an authoritarian regime headed by Colonel Kimon Georgiev was established. They dissolved all parties and trade unions and suppressed the IMRO. Their government introduced a corporatist economy, similar to that of Benito Mussolini's Italy. After participating in the Bulgarian coup d'√©tat of 1934, Zveno supporters declared their intention to immediately form an alliance with France and to seek the unification of Bulgaria into an Integral Yugoslavia.Khristo Angelov Khristov. Bulgaria, 1300 years. Sofia, Bulgaria: Sofia Press, 1980. p. 192. In April 1935 Boris III staged a counter-coup with the help of monarchist Zveno member General Pencho Zlatev and took power himself. The political process was controlled by the Tsar, but a form of parliamentary rule was re-introduced, without the restoration of the political parties, prime ministers were appointed by the monarch.\\"Balkans and World War I\\" SofiaEcho.com With the rise of the \\"King's government\\" in 1935, Bulgaria entered an era of prosperity and astounding growth, which deservedly qualifies it as the Golden Age of the Third Bulgarian Kingdom.King of Mercy, by Pashanko Dimitroff, Great Britain, 1986 It lasted nearly five years, governed by prime minister Georgi Kyoseivanov. Kyoseivanov's Premiership oversaw the trials of the instigators of the 1934 military coup and also concluded pacts with Yugoslavia and Greece as Nazi Germany undertook a policy of economic isolation of the Balkans. His government also oversaw a policy of rearmament after a treaty concluded with Ioannis Metaxas overturned the military clauses of the Treaty of Neuilly-sur- Seine and the Treaty of Lausanne. Although the signing of the Salonika Agreement of 1938 restored good relations with Yugoslavia and Greece, the territorial issue continued to simmer. = Economy = Interwar Bulgaria was highly backwards from an economic standpoint. Heavy industry was almost nonexistent due to a lack of major natural resources, and whatever manufacturing did exist consisted almost exclusively of textiles and handicrafts. Even these required extensive tariff protection to survive. Some natural resources did exist, but bad internal communications made it impossible to exploit them and nearly all important manufactured implements were imported. Farm machinery and chemical fertilizers were nearly unheard of. Agricultural products were almost the only thing Bulgaria could export and after 1929 it became very hard to do this. Bulgarian peasant girl in the 1930s Bulgarian agriculture was almost entirely one of small farmers and peasants. Plots were small and almost exclusively under , but they were working intensively and even the tiniest farms often produced crops for market sale. As elsewhere in Eastern Europe, Bulgarian peasants traditionally grew grains for their landowners which after the war could not be effectively marketed due to competition from the United States and Western Europe. However, they were able to switch with little difficulty to garden crops and tobacco in contrast to other countries where the peasantry suffered harder due to continued reliance on corn and wheat. While more successful than the rest of Eastern Europe, Bulgarian agriculture still suffered from the handicaps of backwards technology and especially rural overpopulation and scattered plots (due to the traditional practice of a peasant dividing his land equally among all surviving sons). And all agricultural exports were harmed by the onset of the Great Depression. On the other hand, an underdeveloped economy meant that Bulgaria had little trouble with debt and inflation. Just under half of industry was owned by foreign companies in contrast to the nearly 80% of Romanian industry. = Demographics = Since the population was 85% ethnic Bulgarians, there was relatively little social strife aside from the conflict between the haves and have-nots. Most inhabitants of Sofia maintained close ties to the countryside, but this did not prevent a rift between the peasants and urban class (i.e. Sofia versus everyone else), although some was the result of deliberate manipulation by politicians seeking to take advantage of traditional peasant distrust of the \\"effeminate city slicker\\". Mostly however, it was due to a quarrel between the rulers and the ruled. Around 14% of the population were Muslims, mostly Turks (i.e. the remnant of the landowning class), but also a handful of so-called \\"Pomaks\\" (ethnic Bulgarians who practiced Islam). The Muslim population was alienated from the dominant Orthodox Christians both due to religious and historical reasons. They neither pressed for minority rights nor tried to set up their own schools, and instead asked nothing more than to be left alone to mind their own business. The Bulgarian government obliged except for a great willingness to assist them in emigrating back to Turkey. Sofia University in 1935 By comparison to economics, Bulgaria's educational system was highly successful and less than half the population were illiterate. Eight years of schooling were required and over 80% of children attended. For the few special students who went past elementary school, the high schools were based on the German gymnasium. Competitive examinations were used to judge college applicants, and Bulgaria had a number of technical and specialized schools in addition to the University of Sofia. Many Bulgarian students also went abroad, primarily to Germany and Austria (educational ties with Russia ended in 1917). Overall, education reached more of the lower classes than anywhere else in Eastern Europe, but on the downside all too many students obtained degrees in the liberal arts and other abstract subjects and could not find work anywhere except in the government bureaucracy. Many of them gravitated towards the Bulgarian Communist Party. World War II The government of the Kingdom of Bulgaria under Prime Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov declared a position of neutrality upon the outbreak of World War II. Bulgaria was determined to observe it until the end of the war; but it hoped for bloodless territorial gains in order to recover the territories lost in the Second Balkan War and World War I, as well as gain other lands with a significant Bulgarian population occupied by neighboring countries. However, it was clear that the central geopolitical position of Bulgaria in the Balkans would inevitably lead to strong external pressure by both World War II factions. On 15 February 1940, following the resignation of Georgi Kyoseivanov, Bogdan Filov was appointed Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Bulgaria. On 7 September 1940, Bulgaria succeeded in negotiating the recovery of Southern Dobruja in the Axis-sponsored Treaty of Craiova. Bulgaria during World War II Bulgarian troops entering Southern Dobruja On 1 March 1941, Bulgaria formally signed the Tripartite Pact, becoming an ally of Nazi Germany, the Empire of Japan, and the Kingdom of Italy. German troops entered the country in preparation for the German invasions of the Kingdom of Greece and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. When Yugoslavia and Greece were defeated, Bulgaria was allowed to occupy all of Greek Thrace and most of Macedonia. Bulgaria declared war on Britain and the United States, but resisted German pressure to declare war on the Soviet Union, fearful of pro-Russian sentiment in the country. In August 1943 Tsar Boris died suddenly after returning from Germany (possibly poisoned, although this has never been proved) and was succeeded by his six-year-old son Simeon II. Power was held by a council of regents headed by the young Tsar's uncle, Prince Kirill. The new Prime Minister, Dobri Bozhilov, was in most respects a German puppet. Resistance to the Germans and the Bulgarian regime was widespread by 1943, co-ordinated mainly by the Communists. Together with the Agrarians, now led by Nikola Petkov, the Social Democrats and even with many army officers they founded the Fatherland Front. Partisans operated in the mountainous west and south. By 1944 it was obvious that Germany was losing the war and the regime began to look for a way out. Bozhilov resigned in May, and his successor Ivan Ivanov Bagryanov tried to arrange negotiations with the western Allies. Meanwhile, the capital Sofia was bombed by Allied aircraft in late 1943 and early 1944, with raids on other major cities following later. But it was the Red Army which was rapidly advancing towards Bulgaria. In August Bulgaria unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the war and asked the German troops to leave: Bulgarian troops were hastily withdrawn from Greece and Yugoslavia. In September the Soviets crossed the northern border. The government, desperate to avoid a Soviet occupation, declared war on Germany, but the Soviets could not be put off, and on September 8 they declared war on Bulgaria ‚Äì which thus found itself for a few days at war with both Germany and the Soviet Union. On September 16, the Red Army entered Sofia. Communist coup The Fatherland Front took office in Sofia following a coup d'√©tat, setting up a broad coalition under the former ruler Kimon Georgiev and including the Social Democrats and the Agrarians. Under the terms of the peace settlement, Bulgaria was allowed to keep Southern Dobruja, but formally renounced all claims to Greek and Yugoslav territory. 150,000 Bulgarians were expelled from Greek Thrace. The Communists deliberately took a minor role in the new government at first, but the Soviet representatives were the real power in the country. A Communist-controlled People's Militia was set up, which harassed and intimidated non-Communist parties. On 1 February 1945, the new realities of power in Bulgaria were shown when Regent Prince Kiril, former Prime Minister Bogdan Filov, and hundreds of other officials of the old regime were arrested on charges of war crimes. By June, Kirill and the other Regents, twenty-two former ministers, and many others had been executed. In September 1946, the monarchy was abolished by plebiscite, and young Tsar Simeon was sent into exile. The Communists now openly took power, with Vasil Kolarov becoming President and Dimitrov becoming Prime Minister. Free elections promised for 1946 were blatantly rigged and were boycotted by the opposition. The Agrarians refused to co-operate with the new regime, and in June 1947 their leader Nikola Petkov was arrested. Despite strong international protests he was executed in September. This marked the final establishment of a Communist regime in Bulgaria. See also *History of Bulgaria *History of Bulgaria (1878‚Äì1946)  References  *Khristo Angelov Khristov. Bulgaria, 1300 years.

It is the campus radio station of St. Francis Xavier University.  History  The station was conceived in 1969 by several students who used a home built 5 watt AM transmitter kit (Heathkit) to broadcast out of the common room of Fraser House (Bishop's Hall). Amateur announcers spun their own records on a simple turntable and microphone system. The station was called \\"VOX\\" (Voice of Xavier). The \\"pirate radio\\" station featured volunteer announcers offering a rock format. VOX was extremely popular with the student body and could be picked up on car and home radios in the Antigonish town area. The success of VOX sparked interest in establishing a more formal and funded \\"radio\\" station. CRTC licensing issues prevented a higher power transmitter being utilized hence the \\"pirate radio\\" format was abandoned in favor of a wired residence speaker system. Used turntables and broadcast quality microphones were acquired and a functioning broadcast studio was built in the basement of the old Student Union building (The Old Chapel next to Mockler Hall). \\"Radio St F.X.\\" began closed circuit broadcast in 1970. \\"Radio St.F.X.\\" was a voice for student opinion, popular music and had a major role in campus politics of the era. The broadcast studio was subsequently moved to a more modern facility in the basement of the new Student Union Building (Bloomfield Centre) in 1971. The \\"Radio St. F.X Society\\" functioned with Student Union funding and support and became a venue for many St. F.X. students with interest in communications and media production. Numbers of student volunteers worked to provide news and music programming. The original VOX dream of broadcasting locally with an actual licensed transmitter did not die and the society awaited less stringent Canadian Radio Television Commission rules to apply for a local low power broadcast license. In 1981, CFXU began broadcasting in student residences at 690 kHz AM via carrier current. This system used the ordinary electrical wires of the university buildings as an antenna. Students in residence could listen using an AM radio receiver. In 1984 CFXU also began broadcasting on through Eastlink cable's Antigonish system. Anyone with cable television could listen to the station through their television. In October 1999 CFXU broadcast its signal over the internet by way of a streaming MP3 signal using Shoutcast. They were the first Canadian university radio station to do this. In 2002 the station was granted a developmental FM license from the CRTC.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2002-257 In late September 2006, the station was successful in its application to the CRTC for a campus community broadcast license and broadcast ability increase. This new license will enable the station to grow in size over the next 3 to 4 years.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2006-478 The station is run on a day-to-day basis by a small but dedicated staff of full-time students and is funded by the St. FX Student Union.

Its purpose is to connect communication lines to the mainframe channel. It was a first communications controller of the popular IBM 37xx series. It was announced in March 1972. Designed for semiconductor memory which was not ready at the time of announcement, the 3705-I had to use 1.2 microsecond core storage; the later 3705-II uses 1.0 microsecond SRAM. Monolithic System Technology components, similar to those in S/370, were used. The 3705 normally occupies a single frame two feet wide and three feet deep. Up to three expansion frames can be attached for a theoretical capacity of 352 half-duplex lines and two independent channel adapters. The 3704 is an entry level version of the 3705 with limited features. Purpose IBM intended it to be used in three ways: # Emulation of the older IBM 2703 Communications Controller and its predecessors. The relevant software is the Emulation Program or EP. # Connection of Systems Network Architecture (SNA) devices to a mainframe. The relevant software is Network Control Program (NCP). When used in this fashion, the 3705 is considered an SNA PU4. # Combining the two methods above in a configuration is called a Partitioned Emulation Program or PEP. Architecture The storage word length is 16 bits. The registers have the same width as the address bus. Their length varies between 16, 18 and 20 bits depending on the amount of storage installed. A particular interrupt level has eight registers. Register zero is the program counter which gave the address of the next instruction to be executed; the other seven are accumulators. The four odd-numbered accumulators can be addressed as eight single-byte accumulators. Instructions are fairly simple. Most are register-to-register or register-immediate instructions which execute in a single memory cycle. There are eight storage reference instructions which require two or three storage cycles to complete. The only shift capability is to shift right one or to add a register to itself. Special hardware assists in the calculation of a cyclic redundancy check for detection of transmission errors. Both CRC-16 CCITT and CRC-16 IBM are supported. Assuming the running value is maintained in storage, the execution time to accumulate one more byte is five storage cycles (three instructions). Rapid context switching was a design objective. The register file is divided into four sections. The three commonly used interrupt levels and the background level have distinct sets of registers. Therefore, entry into most interrupt levels does not require saving the registers of the interrupted program. The infrequently used level which processed program and hardware errors shares registers with the next highest level and thus has to save and restore registers. The five program levels are: # Error processing # Communication line events # Channel adapter events # Service requests from other levels # Background level The 3705 has a flashing light style control panel which is superior to most other IBM panels of that style. The two unusual (for IBM) features are: # Storage (and some external registers) can be displayed while the program is executing. # The hex input switches and the two register-sized displays can be used by the program while the machine is running. This capability derived from the objective of emulating the IBM 2703 which has a fairly rich control panel. The 3705 has a maximum memory capacity of 512 KB, but this requires four physical frames (the base frame and three expansion frames). An Amdahl 4705 has a maximum memory capacity of 1024 KB, all of which is contained within the base frame. Peripherals Three types of peripherals were available: communications scanners, channel adapters and 8\\" floppy disk (only available in models without a channel adapter). The first Communication Scanner and the first Channel Adapter occupied the same frame as the CCU. Extra peripherals required extra frames. All Amdahl 4705s were provided with an 8\\" floppy drive, which was used for diagnostics as well as for remote program loading. This floppy drive and all Channel Adapters were contained in the Base Frame, although additional S/370 channel I/O interfaces could require an Expansion Frame. That is, more than four I/O interfaces required an Expansion Frame, which accommodated four additional I/O interfaces. Communication Scanners Three different communication scanners were offered: The Type 1 Communication Scanner was an entry level device which presented an interrupt on every received bit. Transmission also required an interrupt for every bit. In theory this would have allowed for rather imaginative uses such as Morse Code and connection to devices with unusual framing methods. A maximum of 64 half-duplex lines could be attached. The aggregate bandwidth was restricted due to the heavy processing requirements. The Type II Communication Scanner performed functions similar to a USART. There was an interrupt for every transmitted or received character. Six different asynchronous character formats, two forms of Bisync and HDLC/SDLC were supported. A single scanner could attach up to 96 (64 for the first scanner) half-duplex lines. This is the basis of the theoretical maximum capacity of 352 lines. In practice the limit was lower as a scanner with more than 48 half duplex lines could not support any 9.6 kbit/s lines. The Type III Communication Scanner was a high performance device for attachment of Bisync and HDLC/SDLC lines. It operated on entire frames. DMA was used to fetch and store the bytes of a frame. In theory the line attachment capacity was the same as for Type II Communication Scanner (352 line limit). The need to restrict scanner size to 48 lines to support 9.6 kbit/s was still present. Restricting scanner size to 16 lines allowed line speeds of up to 30 kbit/s. A scanner size of 8 lines allowed speed of about 60 kbit/s. Maximum Communication Line Connection Estimates With modem supplied clocking, a single line was limited to 56 kbit/s; with internal clocking the limit was 2.4 kbit/s. Aggregate line connection ability was limited by processing speed. For a Type II Communications Scanner, processing of a received or transmitted character might take fifty storage cycles (forty instructions). In a 3705-II this gives an aggregate capacity of 20 kB/s. This would allow about 160 half- duplex lines running at a mean speed of 120 cycles per second (cps). Alternatively sixteen half-duplex lines running at 1200 cps (9.6 kbit/s) would be the theoretical limit. IPSANET experience was that six full-duplex 9.6 kbit/s lines carrying a heavy load was the limit. IBM software may have had superior performance. For a Type III Communications Scanner cycle steal processing of a single character was fairly inexpensive--a single storage cycle was required. This would give a theoretical limit of a million cps (eighty 9.6 kbit/s half-duplex lines). In practice the limit was probably lower as some processing would be required for end of frame. Also if the frame contents were moved about in storage this would require 3.5 storage cycles per byte. IBM communications scanners were limited to 48 lines on the first communications scanner and 96 lines on communications scanners two through four. Amdahl communications scanners were theoretically capable of 128 lines per scanner, but this was artificially limited to 48 and 96 for marketing reasons. Channel Adapters Two types of channel adapter were offered: Type 1 and Type 4 Channel Adapters were designed for 270x emulation. They recognized up to 256 channel addresses and transferred data in small bursts (four bytes for the Type 1; 32 bytes maximum for the Type 4). The hardware could accept almost all of the 240 possible channel command codes. Software had to analyse the command from the channel and either reject the command or process it according to specific rules. Interrupt processing required about fifty storage cycles to process a four byte transfer. The 3705 could only have a single Type 1 Adapter but two Type 4 Adapters were permitted. An Amdahl 4705 could have four Type 4 channel adapters (Type 1 channel adapters were not offered). Type 2 and Type 3 Channel Adapters were designed for NCP use only. Only one device address was recognized. Data transfer was via cycle steal which made the overhead low if large buffers were used. The hardware accepted seven channel commands of which four were completely processed by the adapter. This left a read and two write commands for the software to process. These adapters could be connected to any of the three System/370 channel types but a block multiplexor channel was preferred. The Type 3 Adapter could be simultaneously operational (but not in mid-command) on two different channels which might be connected to different hosts. An Amdahl 4705 could have Type 2 channel adapters as well as Type 4 channel adapters (up to a total of four channel adapters). Amdahl's 4705 Type 2 channel adapter also simulated a Type 3 channel adapter. Related Machines  The Amdahl 4705 was compatible with and ran about 2.5 times as fast as a comparable 3705-II. The IBM 3704 was an entry level version of the 3705. It was restricted to 26 half duplex lines (assuming Type 2 Scanner). DMA devices were not supported on the 3704. Performance was about the same as a 3705-I. A 4704 (a 3704-compatible device) was planned, but was never introduced. The Amdahl 4745 was completely and in every respect a logical superset, or a physical subset of the IBM 3745. Whereas the IBM 3745 offered one or two physical processors, and one or two physical buses, both apparently for redundancy, the Amdahl offered one very highly reliable physical processor and one very highly reliable physical bus (but two logical buses), with no apparent need for redundancy. Whereas the IBM 3745 offered two buses, the Amdahl 4745 offered a single bus which throughput capacity exceeded the aggregate throughput capacity of the two buses of the IBM 3745. The design of the Amdahl 4745 was such that the control program (NCP) could not tell whether it was operating in an IBM 3745 or in an Amdahl 4745 (or, for that matter, in an IBM 3725 or in an Amdahl 4725). Amdahl's logical and physical simulation of the IBM 3745 (IBM 3725) was that complete. Later, a very high-speed scanner was offered with the Amdahl 4745 (and also with the Amdahl 4725, for which IBM had no such corresponding 3725 offering) which offered increased redundancy over the IBM 3745 very high-speed scanner (1.544 Mbit/s, T1, or 2.048 Mbit/s, E1) by having the line switchable to a backup 4725/4745 under operator console control. Demise The 3705 was eventually replaced by the 3720 and 3725. The 3745 was similar but not entirely compatible. The 3705 was withdrawn from marketing in December 1985. Hardware maintenance service was withdrawn in January 1999.

It is owned by TLC Casino Enterprises. The casino is named for its founder, Benny Binion, whose family ran it from its founding in 1951 until 2004. The hotel, which had 366 rooms, closed in 2009. TLC reopened 81 of the rooms as a boutique hotel called Hotel Apache in July 2019. History =Binion's Horseshoe (1951‚Äì2004)= Benny Binion bought the Eldorado Club and Hotel Apache in 1951, re-opening them as Binion's Horseshoe (also called the Horseshoe Casino). The casino's interior had a frontier flavor, like an old- style riverboat, with low ceilings and velvet wallpaper. It was the first casino in downtown Las Vegas (also called Glitter Gulch) to replace sawdust- covered floors with carpeting,Doug Swanson. Blood Aces, (New York: Penguin Books, 2014), p. 161. and was the first to offer comps to all gamblers, not just those who bet big money.Doug Swanson. Blood Aces, (New York: Penguin Books, 2014), p. 180. Linda Chase. Picturing Las Vegas, (Layton: Gibbs Smith, 2009), p. 17. Binion also instituted high table limits. When Binion first opened the Horseshoe, he set the craps table limit at $500--ten times higher than any other casino in Las Vegas at the time. Ultimately, Binion's raised the table limit to $10,000 and even eliminated table limits completely at times, which was an immediate hit. Unlike other casinos, the emphasis at Binion's was on gambling, not on big performing acts.Doug Swanson. Blood Aces, (New York: Penguin Books, 2014), p. 164. The casino was also very egalitarian; there were no private pits for high rollers. Other members of Binion's family were involved in the casino. His sons, Jack and Ted, supervised the games, while his wife, Teddy Jane, kept the books until her death in 1994.Retrospective on Horseshoe's history from UNLV Center for Gaming Research Benny served time in Leavenworth Penitentiary from 1953 to 1957 for tax evasion. He sold a majority share of the casino to fellow gambler and New Orleans oilman Joe W. Brown to cover back taxes and legal costs.Doug Swanson. Blood Aces, (New York: Penguin Books, 2014), p. 214-15. It was generally understood, however, that Brown was only a caretaker, and Benny regained controlling interest in 1957. He did not regain full control, however, until 1964. While Brown operated the casino, he installed the famous $1 million display on the casino floor. He sold the display in 1959 and it was later recreated using 100 $10,000 bills by Benny in 1964. The display became one of the casino's attractions. As a convicted felon, Benny was no longer allowed to hold a gaming license, so his sons took over day-to-day control when the family bought out Brown. Jack became president while Ted became casino manager. Benny assumed the title of Director of Public Relations.Doug Swanson. Blood Aces, (New York: Penguin Books, 2014), p. 246. In 1970, Jack began hosting the World Series of Poker (WSOP) at the Horseshoe. Eventually, the WSOP became the largest set of poker tournaments in the world. In 1988, the Horseshoe expanded by acquiring The Mint, a high-rise hotel on the west side of the casino. The expansion of the casino from this purchase provided room for Binion's first poker room. Ted was under constant scrutiny from the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1986 onward for drug problems and associating with known mob figure \\"Fat Herbie\\" Blitzstein. He would ultimately be banned from even entering his family's casino. In 1998, he was stripped of his gaming license for his continued association with Blitzstein. He was forced to sell his 20% interest to his younger sister, Becky. In 1998, Becky Behnen acquired controlling interest in the casino following a protracted legal battle with her older brother Jack. The battle ended with Jack being bought out while retaining a 1% interest in the casino so that he could retain his Nevada gaming license. Jack moved on to focus on Horseshoe Gaming Holding Corporation, running other casinos under the Horseshoe brand. Behnen became president of the Horseshoe while her husband, Nick, took over as manager. Behnen implemented several cost-cutting measures, most of which were unpopular with the gamblers. Among the most notable was the removal of the Horseshoe exhibit that held $1 million, having been sold to collector Jay Parrino, that had served as a backdrop for free pictures of visitors. She also made changes in the distribution of the money from the entry fees in the World Series of Poker that were unpopular with the casino dealers, and closed a popular restaurant in the casino. Benny had used one of the tables in the restaurant as his office. Despite these measures, the Horseshoe became bogged down in debt. Under her father and brothers, the Horseshoe had reportedly been the most profitable casino in Las Vegas (it was privately held, so it never had to report its earnings). Behnen also attracted the attention of the state regulators by failing to keep sufficient funds available to pay winners in the casino cage. Bob Stupak also drew negative publicity to the casino when he tried to redeem $250,000 in $5,000 casino tokens, some of which were stored in the casino's own safe deposit boxes, and Becky refused to honor them. Miller, Steve . Las Vegas Tribune, 5.1.2002. A Binion's poker table signed by numerous professional poker players and WSOP Champions Behnen's undoing, however, was a dispute with the unions that represented some of the Horseshoe's employees. In November 2002, the Culinary Workers Union and Bartenders Union filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Behnen hadn't signed a collective bargaining agreement and had fallen behind on medical insurance and pension payments. The parties reached a settlement in March 2003 in which the Horseshoe signed the collective bargaining agreement and agreed to pay the owed money. However, the Horseshoe fell behind on its payments, leading a federal judge to issue two separate judgments ordering the Horseshoe to pay over $1.5 million. The judgments gave the union the right to seize the money if regular payments weren't being met.Benston, Liz; and Jeff German. Horseshoe May Be Sold to Harrah's. Casino City News, 2004-01-12. However, the casino stopped making payments in June.Goldman, Adam. Agents shut down gambling at Binion's Horseshoe in Las Vegas 2004-01-11 After holding off numerous times, on December 5 the Culinary Union obtained a court order authorizing the seizure of up to $1.9 million from the Horseshoe casino cage.Casino in debt: Binion's forced to close. Las Vegas Review-Journal, 2004-01-10 The seizure took place on January 9; ultimately federal marshals and IRS agents seized $1 million in order to satisfy debts owed to the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Trust Fund and to the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union Welfare Fund. The seizure effectively depleted the Horseshoe's bankroll, forcing it to close. A day later, the hotel was shut down as well, and Behnen reached an agreement with the Nevada Gaming Commission to keep the casino closed until its bankroll was replenished.Binion's Horseshoe: Casino to remain closed. Las Vegas Review- Journal, 2004-01-11 A few days later, on January 23, Behnen reached a deal to sell the Horseshoe to Harrah's Entertainment.Binion's Horseshoe: Deal with Harrah's finalized. Las Vegas Review-Journal, 2004-01-23 =Post-Binion family (2004‚Äìpresent)= Days after the purchase by Harrah's closed, while retaining the Horseshoe and World Series of Poker brands, they sold the physical property and the Binion's brand on March 11, 2004, to MTR Gaming Group. Binion's reopened in April 2004, with MTR Gaming operating the hotel and Harrah's Entertainment operating the casino, while MTR Gaming completed the process of acquiring the required gaming license. Harrah's continued to operate the casino under a temporary contract until March 11, 2005, when MTR officially took control of the operation of the casino and renamed it Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel. MTR remodeled both the casino and hotel after the purchase. A notable feature of the remodeling was to replace the casino's worn carpet with surplus carpeting that Benny Binion had stored since initially carpeting the casino. In July 2005, Binion's hosted the WSOP main event for the last time. The tournament had outgrown the space at Binion's, and Harrah's wanted to host it at one of its properties. In 2005, all events, except the final three tables of the main event, were played at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino. The casino still retains a large poker area and features displays on the Poker Hall of Fame as well as previous WSOP Champions. On March 7, 2008, MTR sold the hotel-casino to TLC Casino Enterprises, owner of the Four Queens, for $32 million. The $1 million casino floor display, once a free tourist photo attraction, returned in August 2008. With $10,000 bills no longer widely available, the new display contains 2,700 $100 bills, 34,400 $20 bills and 42,000 $1 bills. The casino is . =Hotel Apache (2009‚Äìpresent)= On purchasing Binion's, TLC had announced a plan to expand the hotel with a new tower, but on December 14, 2009, they closed the hotel and coffee shop due to the late-2000s recession. TLC continues to operate the hotel at the Four Queens casino across the street, which has almost twice as many rooms. Previously, Binion's advertised the hotel as closed for renovations.https://www.flickr.com/photos/13587622@N05/5056674676/ However, due to the high cost of asbestos removal in the hotel, renovation plans were shelved. In February 2019, TLC announced plans to reopen 81 of the rooms as a new boutique hotel called Hotel Apache. The hotel will feature \\"vintage-style furnishings reminiscent of the original Hotel Apache that opened in 1932\\". The hotel opened on July 29, 2019. In media thumb The 1971 James Bond movie Diamonds Are Forever has a chase scene showing the Horseshoe several times. The music video for U2's 1987 song, \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", was filmed on Fremont Street and features several views of Binion's. Binion's makes a brief appearance in the 1997 Chevy Chase comedy, Vegas Vacation In 2005, the outside of the hotel (along with its famous former \\"Horseshoe\\" logo) is featured prominently in the music video for Snoop Dogg's 2005 single, \\"Signs\\" featuring Justin Timberlake. The hotel was seen in the 2007 film Lucky You. Its history was also mentioned in \\"Chum Goes AWOL\\", a second season episode of the History Channel reality television series Pawn Stars, which aired in 2010. A reality series, Casino Confidential which airs on DTour, gives a behind the scenes look at the Binion casino. In the 2013 film Last Vegas, the protagonists attempt to check in to Binion‚Äôs in an attempt to recreate a bachelor party from decades earlier, only to learn the hotel is undergoing renovations. Binion's was featured in a 2019 episode of Ghost Adventures.

Acquired by GM in 1953, it produced Hydramatic and other automatic transmissions for use in vehicles built by General Motors and other automakers. The factory first opened in 1941 as the Ford Willow Run facility, which built B-24 Liberator bombers during World War II, and its original building (still preserved within the fabric of the GM Powertrain plant) was designed by noted architect Albert Kahn. Following the war, the bomber plant was sold as surplus property to the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation, a partnership of construction and shipbuilding magnate Henry J. Kaiser and Graham-Paige executive Joseph W. Frazer. From 1947 to 1953, Willow Run built Kaiser and Frazer cars for Kaiser-Frazer and its successor Kaiser Motors. Kaiser also produced cargo planes during the Korean War at Willow Run under license from Fairchild Aircraft, including the C-119 Flying Boxcar. Willow Run Transmission plant, taken shortly before its final closing (2010) General Motors production The Willow Run factory was acquired by General Motors in late 1953, after the Detroit Transmission plant in Livonia, Michigan, which held GM's only Hydramatic production line, burned down in mid-August; the line was up and running at Willow Run a mere nine weeks after the fire.Kidder, Warren Benjamin, Willow Run, Colossus of American Industry Michigan:KFT, 1995 The plant grew over the years from the bomber plant to the nearly GM Powertrain factory and engineering center that the company abandoned as part of its 2009 bankruptcy. A parcel of land south of the Powertrain facility became Willow Run Assembly, which produced cars until 1992, later being sold by GM and becoming the Willow Run Business Center. In addition to making automatic transmissions, Willow Run Transmission also produced the M16A1 rifle and the M39A1 20mm autocannon for the U.S. military during the Vietnam War. =Products built by GM at Willow Run Transmission= This list is incomplete; please help by expanding it. * GM Turbo-Hydramatic 200 * GM Turbo-HydraMatic 425 * GM Turbo-Hydramatic 400 * GM Turbo-Hydramatic 125 * GM Turbo-Hydramatic 325 * GM 4L80 transmission * GM 4L85 transmission * GM 4T60 transmission * GM 6L60 transmission * GM 6L50 transmission * GM 6L90 transmission * M16A1 rifle * M39A1 20mm autocannon Closure and redevelopment On June 1, 2009, GM announced it would be closing the plant as part of its bankruptcy proceedings.

Her report to Eisenhower on the unfitness of American children as compared with their European counterparts led to the formation of the President's Council on Youth Fitness. Prudden authored 16 books on physical fitness and Myotherapy for all ages and abilities including two best sellers, How to Keep Slender and Fit After Thirty (1961) and Pain Erasure: The Bonnie Prudden Way (1980). She produced six exercise albums, hosted the first regular exercise spots on national television, had a syndicated television show, and wrote a column for Sports Illustrated. Schools, prisons, summer camps, factories, hospitals, clubs, YMCAs, universities, geriatric homes and facilities for the physically and emotionally challenged all used and benefited from the many physical fitness programs she provided for them. Prudden also designed the first fitness fashions and developed numerous pieces of exercise equipment that could be built in the average garage and used by the family. She also developed Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy in 1976. \\"A method of relaxing muscle spasm, improving circulation, and alleviating pain. Pressure is applied, using elbows, knuckles, or fingers, and held for several seconds to defuse 'trigger points.' The success of this method depends upon the use of specific corrective exercises of the freed muscles.\\" Bonnie Prudden, eleven years old, 1925 Early life Born Ruth Alice in New York City, Prudden began her climbing and dance career at age four when she ventured out the second story nursery window of her Mt. Vernon home to go night walking. After three such escapades a doctor told her mother, ‚ÄúThere is nothing wrong with this child that discipline and exhaustion won‚Äôt cure. Put her in the Russian Ballet School.‚Äù During her growing up years she trained in the Koslov, Magna and Alviene Schools of dance, drama, elocution and gymnastics. She attended German Turnverein and Finnish exercise, took piano, violin, voice, riding, writing and studied anatomy. In 1931 she was enrolled at Horace Mann School where she excelled in English, art, sports, music, and drama, and taught dance to her classmates. After graduating in 1933 she took extension courses in art at the Grand Central School of Design and journalism and psychology courses at Columbia. At the same time she began studying modern dance with Charles Weidman and Doris Humphrey and became part of the Weidman/Humphrey concert/theatrical dance group performing on Broadway. Mountaineering In 1936 she married Richard Hirschland, a mountaineer and skier. Their honeymoon in Switzerland was marked by a climb on the Matterhorn following one day of training and the purchase of a new pair of boots. Photo by Richard Hirschland. Bonnie Prudden Photo Collection She first climbed in the Gunks in 1936 with her husband along with Fritz Wiessner and Hans Kraus. In the winter of 1937, however, she badly fractured her pelvis in a skiing accident, which was followed by three months in traction and a doctors' prediction that she would always limp, would no longer be able to ski, climb, dance, or be able to have children. Nevertheless, daughter Joan Ellen was born in May, 1939 and Susan Ann in August, 1943. She rehabilitated herself with chair exercise and aqua- exercise to music. Prudden went on to become the first woman to hold a National Ski Patrol Badge, and formed the Addlepate Ski Club, the first dry ski club in the country. It was for children eight to eighteen and became the basis for the first Jr. Ski Patrols. Over eleven years she taught 1,000 children ages eight to eighteen without even one fracture. For her work she was awarded the Eastern Amateur Ski Association for ski safety. Seven years after her injury, Prudden returned to the Gunks, partnering with good friend Hans Kraus. From 1946 to 1955 (mentored by Hans Kraus) she became the most prominent woman climber with a documented 30 first ascents in the Shawangunks Mountains. In 1952, Prudden and Kraus attempted a new climbing route on the cliff known as The Trapps. After attempting the crux overhand, Kraus backed off, handing the lead to Prudden. She was able to find a piton placement that had eluded Hans at the crux, and went on to claim the first ascent of ‚ÄúBonnie‚Äôs Roof‚Äù. Since then, she has stated that she and Kraus always climbed as equal partners, always swapping leads. She stopped climbing in 1959 as she said she was working fourteen-hour days and no longer had weekends off. After the Hirschlands were divorced in 1954 Bonnie changed her name legally to Bonnie Prudden. She never remarried. Youth fitness After watching her daughter's gym class in 1947, she started Bonnie Hirschland‚Äôs Conditioning Classes for her two daughters and ten neighborhood children. In a matter of weeks the class had grown to 75. The schools offered their gyms as long as she accepted all applicants. In 1949 new students entered her classes. To gauge the effectiveness of her program she borrowed and applied to practical use a fitness test devised by Kraus and Sonja Weber of New York Presbyterian Hospital. The Kraus‚ÄìWeber test involved six simple movements and took 90 seconds to administer. To her surprise the new students failed the test at 58% while the students who had been in the program failed at only 8%. For the next seven years Prudden and her volunteers tested 4,458 children between the ages of 6 and 16 in the United States. The failure rate was 56.6%. While climbing in Europe, Prudden and Kraus arranged to test children in Europe. In Italy, Austria and Switzerland, the children tested exhibited an eight percent failure rate. In 1952 Bonnie (still Ruth Hirschland) and Kraus began writing papers for medical and physical education journals concerning their findings on Hypokinetic Disease: Role of Inactivity in Production of Disease and various media outlets began to pick up the story. Bonnie Prudden leads a class in exercises at her White Plains school Prudden bought an empty elementary school in White Plains, NY in 1954 and after renovating it opened The Institute for Physical Fitness. It housed three gyms, two dance studios, a Finnish sauna, a medical unit, two massage rooms, lockers, showers and an office. Taking classes barefoot was a requirement. Equipment, painted in bright colors, was designed after curbs, boulders, fences, railroad tracks, and walls of a less mechanized day. Chinning bars were built in every doorway. Every child used the 42 stairs between basement and top floor for conditioning, discipline and special muscle building. Outside was an obstacle course, that included America's first climbing wall, cargo nets, hurdles, parallel bars, ladders, ramps, balance maze, tightrope, slalom poles and a rappel roof. In 1955, armed with statistics and a personal invitation to the Eisenhower White House, Bonnie Prudden presented her findings on the fitness level of American public school children compared to that of their peers in Europe. This became known as The Report that Shocked the President or the Shape of the Nation and was the beginning of a change in American attitudes toward physical fitness. Kraus's presentation followed with the medical implications of not enough physical activity: obesity, back pain, high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary heart disease, psychiatric problems and muscle tension. President Eisenhower issued an executive order establishing the President‚Äôs Council on Youth Fitness (now the President's Council on Physical Fitness, Sports and Nutrition) Prudden served on the advisory committee for three years. Prudden and Kraus are credited as co-founders of the Council. In 2007 Prudden was awarded the Council's Inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award. The YMCA decided to adopt Prudden's methods of teaching exercise and follow her advice to admit women to their buildings for morning classes. Representatives were sent to White Plains Institute to be taught Kraus‚ÄìWeber testing and exercise. They went back to their respective states and set up the Prudden Program in their YMCAs. Prudden became a much sought after speaker and the YMCAs became the place to go for the Prudden Programs with diaper gym and swims, pre-natal classes, toddler, mixed teens and family exercise classes. Is Your Child Really Fit? the first book on children's fitness, was published in 1956. It enlarged on the President's report and outlined the solution to the problem. From 1957 through 1960 Prudden served as a columnist for Sports Illustrated introducing her fitness program and appearing on the cover in a full length leotard of her own design. Fitness fashions were born. Attracted by the fitness fashions The Home Show with Arlene Frances and Hugh Downs, booked her for a weekly family fitness TV spot. Following the closing of The Home Show she moved to the Today Show with Dave Garroway where she remained for two and a half years. She left the show when they started advertising a diet pill in connection with her spot and watchers thought she was endorsing it. At the same time she had regular spots on two radio shows, Tex and Jinx McCrary and Arthur Godfrey. From 1955 through 1975 Prudden continued her crusade for better bodies. She wrote 13 books, countless manuals, set up pilot programs of every kind imaginable, designed fitness clothing and equipment for home and school, lectured nonstop throughout the country, brought out six records, two films, 1 film strip, established five-day training workshops, wrote and taped 35 half-hour TV shows, The Bonnie Prudden Show.The Bonnie Prudden Show These were so successful that she contracted for 165 more shows. In 1962 The Reader‚Äôs Digest began underwriting the Prudden Program. This partnership lasted through the mid-80s. Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy Bonnie Prudden using Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy on her English Mastiff, \\"Blue\\" Tucson, AZ, 1994. Bonnie Prudden said that there were three friends in her life who made Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy possible. The first was Hans Kraus, who taught her Corrective Exercise beginning in 1943. The second was Janet Travell, who mapped trigger points and referred pain patterns in patients, in the early 1940s. The third was Desmond Tivy, who encouraged Prudden's research and coined what she had developed as Myotherapy. Four years after her ski accident Prudden developed back pain which was one of the results of her 1937 accident. She also said that she felt that the stress from her troubled marriage contributed to her physical pain. Back braces, heat, and cold became part of a daily routine. Her introduction to trigger points began in 1938 when she showed up at the Gunks for a climb with her friends including Kraus. When Kraus noted that she was holding her head in a lopsided position, he asked if she had pain and stiffness in her neck. When she said that she did, he used his thumb to press on the back of her neck. When he finished she no longer felt pain or stiffness and her head was straight. After this they all went climbing. From 1949 to 1958 Prudden received training in therapeutic exercise with Kraus, worked in his office with his patients and in 1954 received an appointment as Research Assistant from Howard Rusk. In 1952 Prudden started receiving trigger point injection therapy from Kraus for excruciating back pain which often kept her in bed for days at a time. The injections were followed by corrective exercises and allowed her to function for a few months before needing another round of injections. Prudden closed her White Plains Institute in 1959, bought 23 acres in Stockbridge, MA and in 1960 began building the Bonnie Prudden Institute for Physical Fitness. She continued her nationwide workshops, lecture series, Springfield College summer programs, maternity program at Wesson, and a new summer camp program for women, executives and children in conjunction with the YMCA and Lankenau Hospital in Philadelphia. Montgomery Ward added Prudden's fitness fashions and equipment to its catalog in 1960. During a summer training workshop, in 1965, Prudden hurt her knee demonstrating a ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù dance series. Medication for extreme pain was now needed in order for her to maintain her teaching and TV schedule. Ace bandages and bed rest, whenever possible, were also part of the treatment. By 1966 the right hip joint pain had progressed from annoying to limiting and the search for an answer began. In January 1969 at age 55, Prudden put in a call to Travell. In March of that year she began regular monthly trips to Travell's office in Washington, DC receiving a series of trigger point injections designed to make her more comfortable and save her hip. During the summer of 1970 she had her right hip replaced. From left to right Enid Whittaker and Bonnie Prudden demonstrate Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy on Michael Haines, Tucson, AZ, 1995 It was 1976 before all the pieces of the Myotherapy puzzle fell into place. Prudden's working arrangement with Tivy was that he would send the patient to Prudden who would find the trigger points, mark them and send them back to Tivy who would inject. The patient would them come back to Prudden for the corrective exercises. One morning a woman arrived with her head lopsided and with a stiff and painful neck. Later Prudden would say that she may have pressed the trigger point a little longer or pressed it harder when she was marking the point. However, afterward the woman no longer had pain, or a stiff neck and her head was straight. So began her development of Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy. Over the next four years using herself as a guinea pig, experimenting with staff, friends and patients she developed and mapped out the most common trigger points and the accompanying corrective exercises. It was Tivy who coined the word MYOTHERAPY and said that there were not many modalities available to him such as this with few side effects. In 1979 at age sixty-five Prudden's left hip was replaced. Because of her own Myotherapy, she was able to conduct an entire weekend fitness workshop just prior to her hip surgery. Six weeks later with the help of Myotherapy and aqua-exercise she was back on the gym floor. Bonnie Prudden in her office in Tucson, Arizona, 1996 In 1980 Prudden opened The Bonnie Prudden School for Physical Fitness and Myotherapy which trained students for the profession: Exercise Instructor, and Myotherapy and Corrective Exercise practitioner. The school also housed a nursery school where pre-school aged children exercised each day, learned anatomy, were exposed to music, learned to swim and were taught rudiments of foreign language through song and rhyme. In 1984 the Bonnie Prudden School registered the occupation Myotherapist with the U.S. Department of Labor. Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy was trademarked in 1990 to distinguish her system, which required 1300 hours of training for certification and approved CE hours to maintain certification, from other persons calling themselves Myotherapists. Prudden felt that if the average person had the correct information and tools that they could take care of themselves. She said that Bonnie Prudden Myotherapy is effective whenever the pain is muscle-related. Because the tools are fingers, knuckles and elbows, she felt that the average person would be able to use the discipline quite easily. Myotherapy: Bonnie Prudden‚Äôs Complete Guide to Pain-Free Living was published in 1982. Her three children's books were revised in 1986, 1987, 1988 to include chapters on Myotherapy for each age group.

With the exception of the northern flicker and the gilded flicker that both occur in North America and Fernandina's flicker that is endemic to Cuba, the species are restricted to Central and South America. Colaptes woodpeckers typically have a brown or green back and wings with black barring, and a beige to yellowish underside, with black spotting or barring. There are usually colorful markings on the head. Many of these birds - particularly the northerly species - are more terrestrial than usual among woodpeckers. Historically, there has been considerable uncertainty in assigning woodpecker species to genera and it is only by comparing DNA sequences that it has become possible to confidently place many of the species. Taxonomy The genus Colaptes was introduced by the Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825 with the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) as the type species. The name is from the Ancient Greek Œ∫ŒøŒªŒ¨œÄœÑŒ∑œÇ (kolaptƒìs) meaning \\"chiseller\\". The genus forms part of the woodpecker subfamily Picinae and has a sister relationship to the genus Piculus. The genus Colaptes is a member of the tribe Picini and belongs to a clade that contains five genera: Colaptes, Piculus, Mulleripicus, Dryocopus and Celeus. Some of the relationships between the species within Colaptes are uncertain, with various genetic studies reporting slightly different phylogenies, but it is evident that those species with \\"flicker\\" in their common name do not form a monophyletic group. The genus Colaptes contains 14 species. Of these, one species, the Bermuda flicker, is now extinct: * Golden-olive woodpecker (Colaptes rubiginosus) ‚Äì formerly placed in Piculus * Bronze-winged woodpecker (Colaptes aeruginosus) - formerly considered to be a subspecies of the golden-olive woodpecker * Grey-crowned woodpecker (Colaptes auricularis) ‚Äì formerly placed in Piculus * Crimson- mantled woodpecker (Colaptes rivolii) ‚Äì formerly placed in Piculus * Black- necked woodpecker (Colaptes atricollis) ‚Äì formerly placed in Chrysoptilus * Spot-breasted woodpecker (Colaptes punctigula) ‚Äì formerly placed in Chrysoptilus * Green-barred woodpecker (Colaptes melanochloros) ‚Äì formerly placed in Chrysoptilus * Northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) * Gilded flicker (Colaptes chrysoides) * ‚Ä† Bermuda flicker (Colaptes oceanicus) ‚Äì extinct, but may have survived into the historical period * Fernandina's flicker (Colaptes fernandinae) * Chilean flicker (Colaptes pitius) * Andean flicker (Colaptes rupicola) * Campo flicker (Colaptes campestris) The online edition of the Handbook of the Birds of the World has split five of the species listed above to give a total of 20 species in the genus. None of the splits were based on results of molecular genetic studies. In addition, the common name of the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) is changed to the \\"yellow-shafted flicker\\". These splits have not been adopted by the online edition of the Clements Checklist of Birds of the World maintained by ornithologists at Cornell University, nor by the American Ornithological Society.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Washington Nationals, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Chicago White Sox and then in Nippon Professional Baseball for the Yakult Swallows. He was the youngest player in MLB's National League during his rookie season in 2006.Year-by-Year League Leaders for Youngest Player Early life Milledge was born in Bradenton, Florida. At the age of twelve, he pitched and played third base and hit third for the Manatee East Little League team that was the national runner-up in the 1997 Little League World Series. He received the win on the mound in the semi-final game of the regional, giving up only one run on a solo home run to Matt Rigney in a win against Mississippi. In 2001, he led Team USA to a Gold Medal game victory over Venezuela in the International Baseball Federation's AA World Youth Championships. Later that year, Baseball America named Milledge the best 16-year-old player in the United States. He graduated from Lakewood Ranch High School in Bradenton, Florida in 2003 after leading his team to the state 5A title his senior year. Amateur draft Prior to the 2003 amateur draft, he was expected to be among the top three selections, but as draft day approached, press reports from 2002 resurfaced regarding Milledge's expulsion from Northside Christian School after his junior year for allegedly having sex with a minor. He subsequently transferred to Lakewood Ranch High School where he finished his education and amateur baseball career. As a result of the incident, Milledge was passed over in the 2003 amateur draft until the Mets selected him as the twelfth overall pick in the first round. The Mets began contract negotiations with Milledge, but the talks were interrupted in early August 2003, when the Mets learned of allegations of additional sexual misconduct against Milledge during his time at Northside. The Mets completed a private investigation of the matter and, satisfied with the results, signed Milledge to a contract with a $2.2 million signing bonus. Professional baseball career =Minor league career= The delay in signing Milledge prevented him from beginning his professional career until shortly before the end of the minor league season in 2003. He appeared in only seven games, hitting .231 for the Kingsport Mets of the Appalachian League. In 2004, he was slated to start the year with the class A Capital City Bombers, but he suffered a fractured metacarpal on his right hand in spring training, missing the first six weeks of the season. In 65 games with the Bombers, he hit .337 with 13 home runs, 58 RBI and 23 stolen bases, earning him a promotion to the St. Lucie Mets in August. In 2005, he continued his minor league success hitting .302 with St. Lucie in the first half of the season and .337 with the AA Binghamton Mets in the second half. He began the 2006 season leading off and playing right field for the AAA Norfolk Tides. =New York Mets= Rookie season Milledge made his major league debut on May 30, 2006, as the starting right fielder for the Mets in a 7-2 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks. He went 1 for 4 with a double off Arizona pitcher Miguel Batista. Milledge was 21 years, 55 days old on the day of his debut - exactly the same age as former Met Darryl Strawberry when he made his 1983 debut. In his three separate stints in the majors in 2006, Milledge hit .241 with 4 HR and 22 RBI in 56 games. On June 4, against the San Francisco Giants, Milledge hit a solo home run - his first major league career homer - off Giants closer Armando Ben√≠tez to tie up the game 6-6 in the bottom of the tenth inning. When the Mets returned to the field the following inning, Milledge, still excited, high-fived the home fans in attendance at Shea as he returned to his position, inciting the ire of his manager and some teammates, not to mention the national sports media. In late September, one of Milledge's Mets teammates placed a sign on his locker which read, \\"Know Your Place, Rook!\\" The sign-placer was identified in published reports as then-Mets closer Billy Wagner. 2007 After having an impressive spring training both on and off the field, Milledge was named to the Mets' opening day roster. He saw very limited game action, and was subsequently optioned down to AAA New Orleans after the game on April 12 to create room on the roster so that starting pitcher Mike Pelfrey could be called up and make his season debut in the following day's game. In May, it was reported that Milledge appeared in a rap song, \\"Bend Ya Knees\\", by Manny D, a childhood friend. The song contained the words \\"bitch\\", \\"ho\\", and \\"nigga\\". The Mets organization responded by saying, \\"We disapprove of the content, language, and message of this recording, which does not represent the views of the New York Mets.\\" Upon his recovery from a foot injury, Milledge was called up to the major leagues after the All-Star break on July 12. Veteran Julio Franco was designated for assignment to make room for Milledge. On November 30, , Milledge was traded to the Washington Nationals for Ryan Church and Brian Schneider.The Official Site of The New York Mets: News: Mets land Church, Schneider from Nats =Washington Nationals= Nationals in 2008 2008 Milledge served as the everyday starting center fielder for the Nationals. Up until the end of June, he had been batting third in the lineup in place of the injured Ryan Zimmerman, posting a .245 average, 7 home runs, and 32 RBI for the season. However, on June 28, he suffered a groin strain, and he was placed on the disabled list the next day. Roger Bernadina was called up to take his place. On July 24, the Nationals activated Milledge from the DL and designated Johnny Estrada for assignment. Milledge went 2 for 18 in his first five games after his return. However, in the month of August, he batted .336 with 6 HR and 16 RBI. 2009 On February 19, Milledge willingly gave up his uniform number, 44 for Adam Dunn, wearing #85 as his birthyear.Milledge, Dunn change numbers Milledge began the season as the Nationals' leadoff hitter. Because of his slow start where he batted .167 with 1 RBI and no extra base hits in 24 at-bats, he was optioned down to AAA Syracuse on April 15, 2009. On June 30, 2009, the Nationals traded Milledge and Joel Hanrahan to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Nyjer Morgan and Sean Burnett. =Pittsburgh Pirates= Pirates in 2009 2009 Milledge, still rehabbing from an injury that occurred at AAA Syracuse when the trade was made, was assigned to the Pirates' Gulf Coast League team in Bradenton, Florida to complete his rehab, and then moved to the Pirates' AAA affiliate, the Indianapolis Indians, with a short stint at the Lynchburg Hillcats during the AAA all-star break. After recovering from his injury he became the Pirates' everyday left fielder. He showed growth in his work ethic and his glove work improved. He finished a below par 2009 with 11 doubles, 0 triples, 4 home runs, 21 runs batted in, was walked 13 times, struck out 47 times, stole 7 bases, those went along with .276 average, a .323 on-base percentage, a .373 slugging percentage, in 244 at-bats. 2010 In the May 6 game against the Chicago Cubs, Milledge appeared to have hit his first home run of the season in the 4th inning. However, the ball actually hit the top of the left field wall in PNC Park and bounced back into play.

They produced a variety of television shows and short films for Nickelodeon, its sister channels YTV and Nickelodeon Canada, and CBC Television. Career The Grogs were founded by Jamie Shannon and Jason Hopley in 1992 in Toronto, Ontario. As a puppet troupe, they were somewhat unusual as they designed and moulded their puppets and sets as part of the creative process for writing, directing, and performing in their TV shows. They were present in the process from pre-production to post-production with the help of their partner Jack Lenz. The troupe's name comes from their work on interstitials for YTV featuring a group of monster puppets called the Grogs. In 1999, the Grogs began a partnership with Nickelodeon, producing a series of shorts called Nanalan' for the network and its sister channel Noggin. In 2004, Nickelodeon released the shorts to DVD. Nanalan was developed into a full-length series that finished airing in 2004. In the same year, the Grogs appeared and worked on the Nick Jr. series Whoopi's Littleburg. In 2005, they produced a teen-oriented sitcom for Nickelodeon titled Mr. Meaty, which likewise began as a collection of shorts. These were originally seen on TurboNick and during commercial breaks on Nickelodeon's channels. It was picked up for two seasons of 22-minute episodes that aired through 2009 on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons. Their other work has included Swami Jeff's Temple of Wisdom, The Grogs, Warren, Filth, Gidian, Iffer, Sorbet, Jasper and Cupcake, Al's Tales of the Tank, It's Alive!, and most recently Hotbox.

He represented the Halifax Atlantic riding in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly from 1991 to 2003. He succeeded Alexa McDonough as leader of the Nova Scotia New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1996. He served as the leader of the Official Opposition in the Nova Scotia Legislature from 1998 to 1999. He subsequently founded a consulting firm, was co-chair of the 2010‚Äì11 United Way of Halifax Region campaign, and sat on the Board of Governors of Dalhousie University. On May 2, 2011, Chisholm was elected as the Member of Parliament for the Dartmouth‚ÄîCole Harbour riding in Nova Scotia. As a member of the Official Opposition, he served as the Critic for Fisheries and Oceans and Deputy Critic for Employment Insurance until his defeat in the 2015 election. Provincial politics =1998 Nova Scotia general election= The NDP scored a surprise electoral success in the 1997 federal election, winning six of Nova Scotia's eleven electoral districts. This new-found electoral success boded well for the NDP's provincial party, which was able to take advantage of the new wave of popularity. Prior to 1997, the Nova Scotia NDP had not been considered contenders to form a provincial government. Chisholm subsequently lead the NDP to a record 19 seats (out of the House of Assembly's 52 seats) in the 1998 provincial election, putting them in a tie with the governing Liberal Party. The Liberals were able to continue ruling, as they received support from the third-place Progressive Conservatives, who held 14 seats. The NDP formed the Official Opposition, marking the first time they attained that position; the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), were the last democratic socialist party to hold that title, back in 1949. =1999 Nova Scotia election= 15 months later, the Liberal government was defeated by a motion of non- confidence from the Conservatives, forcing an election in the summer of 1999. During the campaign, it was revealed that Chisholm had a past criminal record for driving under the influence of alcohol when he was 19 years old. The NDP lost eight seats during the campaign, which saw the third-place Conservatives elected to a majority government. During this period, the NDP shared official opposition status with the Liberals (as both held 11 seats). The NDP became sole official opposition upon Russell MacLellan's resignation, and the subsequent election of Progressive Conservative Cecil Clark, which gave the NDP 11 seats to the Liberals' 10. Chisholm unexpectedly resigned the leadership after the campaign, at the November 6, 1999 NSNDP provincial council meeting. He said that he wanted to spend more time with his family and could not subject them to ten more years of political life. He remained sitting as an MLA in the Legislature and remained as leader until a new one was elected. He was succeeded by Helen MacDonald in 2000; and after she could not win a seat in the house, Darrell Dexter eventually became the leader in 2001. Chisholm did not run for re-election as an MLA in 2003 provincial election. Private life After the 2003 provincial election, Chisholm returned to the labour movement and worked as researcher for the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE). Since 2004, he has been a member of Dalhousie University's board of governors. In 2007, he became CUPE's Regional Director for the Atlantic Region. In the spring of 2009, he started a consulting firm with his wife Paula Simon: Simon Chisholm Consulting. Return to politics On January 18, 2011, Chisholm announced that he would seek the New Democratic Party nomination in Dartmouth‚ÄîCole Harbour for the 2011 federal election, and was officially nominated on January 25. On May 2, 2011, he was elected, winning 15,661 votes and defeating Liberal Party of Canada incumbent Mike Savage. Following the death of federal NDP leader Jack Layton, Chisholm was a candidate in the 2012 New Democratic Party leadership election, but after speaking English during a leadership debate in French on account of his lack of fluency in the latter language, he withdrew in December 2011 and subsequently endorsed Thomas Mulcair. In the 2015 federal election, Chisholm was defeated by Liberal Darren Fisher.

Winiarski owns and operates Arcadia Vineyards in the Coombsville AVA of Napa Valley, which produces Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. In 1976, Winiarski won the Judgment of Paris blind tasting for his 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon. He oversees the Winiarski Family Foundation, which supports educational and charitable causes, in addition to teaching courses at the St. John's College Summer Classics program in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 2017, Winiarski was inducted into the 11th class of the California Hall of Fame by Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. for his global efforts to showcase and preserve the quality and history of California wine. The Smithsonian Institution, through its National Museum of American History, awarded Winiarski the James Smithson Bicentennial Medal on November 21, 2019. Background Warren Winiarski was born to Stephen and Lottie Winiarski in 1928 in a large Polish section of Chicago, Illinois. His parents owned a livery business in Chicago and his father made honey wine, fruit-flavored, and dandelion wine at home which the family drank on special occasions. He studied the western classics curriculum at St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, graduating in 1952; Winiarski then began his graduate work at the University of Chicago in political theory with Leo Strauss. While at St. John's College, Winiarski met his wife, Barbara and they were married in 1958. During his studies at the University of Chicago, Winiarski spent a year in Italy (1954‚Äì55) studying the political thinker Niccolo Machiavelli. It was during that year he became convinced that he wanted to become a winemaker. He also lectured in the Basic Program of Liberal Education at the University of Chicago while working on his Ph.D. After contributing the chapter on Machiavelli in the Rand McNally textbook, Hisory of Political Philosophy (1963), he shortened his academic studies to an MA degree from the John U. Nef Committee on Social Thought. Winemaking In 1964, Warren and Barbara Winiarski moved to Napa Valley, California, where Winiarski accepted a job as an apprentice winemaker working with Lee Stewart at Souverain Cellars, before moving on to be the first winemaker at Robert Mondavi Winery in 1966, while Michael Mondavi was away at National Guard Service. In 1968, Winiarski left Robert Mondavi Winery to make wine in Colorado at Ivancie Cellars. He selected California grapes that were to be shipped to Denver where they were made into wine. Though Winiarski still lived in California, this project would kick start the Colorado wine industry. In 1970, Winiarski and several investors bought a 44-acre prune orchard in the Napa Valley and replanted it to a vineyard. He removed the prune, cherry, and walnuts trees on the property and planted Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. In 1973 Winiarski built a winery near the vineyard and founded Stag's Leap Wine Cellars, and the next year, 1974, he introduced a reserve line, Cask 23. In 1976, Winiarski won the Judgement of Paris blind tasting for his 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon. The achievement brought worldwide recognition to California, Napa Valley, and Stag's Leap Wine Cellars. In 1989, Warren chaired the Napa Valley Vintners committee that spearheaded and obtained passage of the California state law, State Senate Bill No. 771 (the Conjunctive Labeling Law), which required any wine bottled after January 1, 1990, and labeled with an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located entirely within Napa Valley must also include Napa Valley on the label \\"in conjunction with the other AVA designation of the wine.\\" This law helped build brand equity for the individual AVAs as well as the Napa Valley, ensuring the region always had two winners and no losers. The law strengthened Napa Valley's position as a recognized world-class wine region. In 2003, thirty winemaking alumni and the current winemaking team paid homage to Winiarski through the Hands of Time installation at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars. Each placed their hands into limestone aggregate to create a plaque. These plaques were mounted as a monument at the winery to remind those in the future of the opportunity to learn and go on. Those in attendance that day included John Kongsgaard, Bob Sessions, John Williams, Dick Ward, Rolando Herrera, Fran√ßoise Peschon, Paul Hobbs and Michael Silacci. Many of these winemakers had spent their formative years at Stag's Leap Wine Cellars with Winiarski. In 1996, Winiarski and his wife, Barbara, initiated The Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History's American Food & Wine History Project. The project uses food and wine history as a lens for understanding American history by tracing the long and diverse history of wine in the United States. Winiarski created and taught a seminar at the Red, White and American symposium at the Smithsonian Institution on the 20th Anniversary of the Judgment of Paris. The symposium, much like the Paris tasting 20 years earlier, was a milestone in the history of American wine because it marked the Federal Government's recognition of wine as part of American culture. In 2012, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars' 1973 Cabernet Sauvignon was received into the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. permanent museum collection. The bottle is included in the \\"American Food & Wine History Project\\". The bottle was included in the book, \\"The Smithsonian's History of America in 101 Objects\\", by Richard Kurin, the Smithsonian Institution's Under Secretary for History, Art, and Culture. Other items chosen for the book from the 137 million artifacts of the museum include Neil Armstrong's space suit, Charles Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis, and Lewis & Clark's compass. On Aug. 1, 2007, Stag's Leap Wine Cellars reached an agreement to be acquired for $185 million by UST Inc. and Marchese Piero Antinori. Winarski has continued his contributions to the Colorado wine industry. In honor of his influence and mentorship to the state's viticultural heritage, he was invited to participate as a Judge at the Colorado Governor's Cup Wine Competition from 2014‚Äì2018. In 2018, he was honored with the \\"Friends of the Colorado Wine Industry\\" award by the Colorado Association of Viticulture and Enology. Winiarski currently owns and operates Arcadia Vineyards, in the Coombsville AVA of Napa Valley which produces Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Philanthropy The Winiarski Family Foundation has made donations to many conservation and preservation efforts, including those of the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, wine and food history research, collecting of wine and food objects, the Smithsonian's Winemaker Dinners, Land Trust of Napa County, the Napa County Open Space District, the Jack L. Davies Napa Valley Agricultural Preservation Fund, If Given A Chance and The Pathway Home, among other organizations In 2018, the Winiarski Family Foundation made a $50 million matching grant to St. John's College in Annapolis and Santa Fe to help bridge the gap between what it costs the college to educate a student and what the student pays in tuition. The grant allowed the two Colleges to lower tuition costs by $17,000. In June 2018, Winiarski donated $3.3 million to build the world's most comprehensive collection of wine writers work within the library at the University of California, Davis. Land preservation Winiarski is among the original promoters of the Napa Ag Preserve passed in 1968, Measure J in 1990 and its extension Measure P in 2008, Measure I in 2006, Measure Z 2017 and Measure C in 2018. Since 1990, Winiarski has donated nearly 200 acres to the Land Trust of Napa County, including the Paris Tasting vineyard and his current property, Arcadia Vineyards, in Coombsville AVA.

March 13, 1583) was the fourth viceroy of New Spain, who ruled in the name of Philip II from November 5, 1568 until October 3, 1580. Like many of the viceroys of New Spain, Almanza was of royal heritage. He was a member of the House of Enr√≠quez, one of the four cadet branches of the House of Burgundy, the ruling dynasty in Castile, yet never inherited a title. Enr√≠quez was 60 when he was appointed viceroy in New Spain. He brought strength and stability in the wake of the encomenderos' conspiracy of the son of conqueror Hern√°n Cort√©s, Don Mart√≠n Cort√©s and other encomenderos who challenged the crown's power. He was subsequently viceroy of Peru, from September 23, 1581 until his death in 1583, a post he reluctantly accepted at age 72.Stafford Poole, \\"Mart√≠n Enr√≠quez de Almansa\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 2, p. 500. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. He was a very able administrator in Mexico, asserting crown control, and effective in establishing defenses against northern natives who threatened the vital link between the silver mines in north and Mexico's center.Parker, Geoffrey. Philip II fourth edition. Chicago: Open Court 2002, pp. 113-14. Early years Born Mart√≠n Enr√≠quez de Almanza y Ulloa, his father was Francisco Enr√≠quez de Almanza, 1st Marquess of Alca√±ices, great-great-grandchild of Infante Fadrique Alfonso of Castile, an illegitimate child of Alfonso XI of Castile. His mother was Isabel de Ulloa y Castilla, also a Castilian royal on her mother's side. Government and actions Having been chosen by the Council of the Indies (Consejo de Indias) as viceroy, his first actions upon arrival in New Spain, at Veracruz, were to dislodge the English pirates from the Isla de Sacrificios, a base they had been using to raid the coast and Spanish shipping. When he arrived in Mexico City, he immediately took steps to end the turmoil left by the former president of the Real Audiencia, Alonso Mu√±oz. Spanish Royal Family Enr√≠quez de Almanza also acted as a mediator between the bishops and the religious orders operating in New Spain. The dispute between these two religious groups dated from the viceroyalty of Gast√≥n de Peralta, 3rd Marquis of Falces, when a royal disposition stipulated that the administration of the parishes was the responsibility of the secular clergy, obliging friars, nuns and members of the regular clergy to retreat to convents. The regular clergy refused to obey this disposition, beginning the conflict. The Franciscans threatened to abandon the city, and in fact began a march to Veracruz. They were threatened by Indians and ordered to return by the viceroy. After receiving some concessions, they returned to Mexico City. In 1570 the viceroy personally led an expedition against the Indian tribes that had been devastating the interior, but he did not give into demand for total war against the Chichimeca.Poole, \\"Martin Enriquez de Almansa\\", p. 500. He established presidios at Ojuelos and Portezuelos, on the road to Zacatecas. He founded the Villa de San Felipe (Guanajuato) and many other towns and villages, as well as colleges and convents. In 1573 he began the construction of the Cathedral of Mexico City. Enr√≠quez brought medical attention to the unprotected and helped those in critical conditions. He established hospitals in the city to treat the victims of a terrible epidemic (thought to be chicken pox or varicella) that left 3,000 people dead. He published regulations in which the social protection of the Indians was guaranteed against their Spanish patrons, and a fair salary was assured for those who worked as peasants and farmers. =Establishment of the Inquisition in New Spain= During the government of Enr√≠quez de Almanza, the Holy Office of the Inquisition (Tribunal del Santo Oficio) was formally established in New Spain; it was simultaneously established in Peru. Pedro Moya de Contreras, the first inquisitor in New Spain, arrived in 1571. Composed of a group of high-ranking bishops and sometimes led by the archbishop of Mexico City, the Inquisition had special instructions to oversee and control the religious practices of Spaniards and non-indigenous residents in the territory, and to eradicate any crypto-Jewish communities (judaizantes), as well as any Protestants. Indians were excluded from its jurisdiction. This religious court became quite active. The first to be tried by the Inquisition in the Indies were two Englishmen and an Irishman, burnt at the stake in Mexico City April 15, 1574 for \\"Lutheran heresies\\". An estimated 200 people were tried in 1574, the year in which the first Autos de Fe were held. Most of these 200 people were burnt alive in public plazas or tortured to death in secret dungeons, both scattered throughout what is now downtown Mexico City. The viceroy was required to attend these ceremonies. Portrait of Enr√≠quez de Almanza, c. 1568 Viceroy of Peru King Philip II of Spain received outstanding comments about this viceroy, and he was aware of the obvious improvements made during his administration. In recognition of his labor, he was designated viceroy of Peru, Peru being a richer colony. Enr√≠quez de Almanza sailed from the port of Acapulco on the Pacific in 1580. He died in Lima, Peru in 1583, still in office. The Audiencia governed New Spain until the arrival of the next viceroy, Lorenzo Su√°rez de Mendoza, 4th conde de la Coru√±a. In Lima people knew him as el Gotoso (The Goutish One) because of his ill health. He was unable to accomplish much as viceroy of Peru and died three years into his term, so that he is thus not counted among the great viceroys. However, in New Spain where he served 12 years as viceroy, he was considered \\"a wise administrator; he is generally credited with having raised the prestige of the viceroy's office.\\"Poole, \\"Martin Enriquez de Almansa.\\" p. 500.

Many of the actors and sets used in the film were from the Dan Duryea television show China Smith. Aldrich and cinematographer Joseph Biroc also worked on the series. Aldrich later said the film \\"first embedded what I wanted to say in films. It was mainly about two men with good and bad points.Both men believed in individual liberty but the belief of one man was weaker than the other because he had no respect for humanity.\\" Plot Mike Callahan (Duryea) is an Irish √©migr√© and war veteran working in Singapore as a private detective. He takes on a case from a former flame, now a nightclub singer. She thinks her husband Julian March (Knowles) is involved in criminal activities and asks him to help out. Callahan learns that a man named Alexis Pederas (Lockhart) has involved Julian in a plot to kidnap a prominent nuclear scientist Sean O'Connor and hold him for ransom to the highest bidder. O'Connor is one of the only men in the world that knows how to detonate the H-Bomb. Cast * Dan Duryea as Mike Callahan aka Corrigan * Gene Lockhart as Alexis Pederas * Patric Knowles as Julian March * Reginald Denny as Major Ian Bone * Nigel Bruce as Governor Sir Charles Crotts * Keye Luke as Wong * Arthur Shields as O'Connor * Strother Martin as Corporal * Marian Carr as Frenessey March Production background Aldrich said he got the idea to make the film while directing episodes of China Smith. When production was on hiatus he wrote a story with a colleague. Bernard Tabakin, who produced China Smith, agreed to produce the film along with Aldrich. Aldrich says the script was almost entirely written by Hugo Butler but Butler does not get credit due to being blacklisted. Aldrich said \\"There are optimists in the society, not many left, who thought that someday those guys [on the Hollywood Blacklist] would get post-mortem credits for their work. So he wrote World for Ransom and I put my name on it to try and get him the credit. And it went into arbitration with the Writer's Guild, and another guy Lindsay Hardy got total screen credit on it. It was a joke. He no more wrote that script than walk on the water. Butler made that total screenplay.\\" Filming started 13 April 1953 at the Motion Picture Center Studio. The film was shot in 11 days, on a budget that has been reported between $90,000 and $100,000. It was shot over 6 days, then Aldrich halted production to shoot TV commercials in order to raise money for the film's post-production. Then there was a five-day shoot to finish it.TV Guide Movie Database \\"It was a strange and very enjoyable experience and ‚Äì except for the end result ‚Äì a marvellous collaboration\\", said Aldrich. \\"It really had no sets and thanks to Joe Biroc we had reflections in the water where there was no water and all sorts of silly things. I've always looked back on World for Ransom with a kind of wistful happy feeling..\\" The film is similar to another film noir with a nuclear theme by Aldrich, Kiss Me Deadly, the difference being that Callahan is trying to get an old girlfriend back, while Mike Hammer in Kiss Me Deadly was in it for the money. Reception The film had a considerable impact on Aldrich's career ‚Äì in July 1953 Harold Hecht hired him to direct Burt Lancaster in Apache. =Critical response= When the film was released, film critic Bosley Crowther was negative about the film but appreciated the actors, writing, \\"Nothing gives it distinction, save possibly the people in its cast ... Robert Aldrich produced and directed. He was trying. Some day he may learn how.\\"Crowther, Bosly. The New York Times, film review, June 5, 1954. Accessed: July 8, 2013. More recently, film critic Dennis Schwartz was positive about the film, and wrote, \\"This is a marvelously understated film noir that parodies all those big-budget spy/adventure films and in my opinion does a better job than most in getting to the underbelly of that genre. Aldrich was upset with censors for lifting the scene where Duryea learns his love interest is a lesbian. He could forgive her love for other men, but not with other women. The 1950s wasn't ready for such relationships, at least not in films. Nevertheless, this was a compelling film doing a fantastic job exploring the uncertainty of partnerships and the indeterminate nature of trust.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

Opened in 1927, the plant was the first that the UAW staged a strike against, in 1936. Initially, Lakewood was referred to as 'Atlanta' and coded as '8' on vehicle VIN plates, changing to 'A' when GM reshuffled their codes for 1953. For 1972, code 'A' Atlanta was now referred to as the Lakewood plant. From 1947 to 2008, Atlanta had a second GM assembly plant called Doraville Assembly, in the northern neighborhood of Doraville, Georgia. Lakewood assembled Chevrolets, Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles and Buicks at various points in its history, and also began assembling Chevrolet and GMC trucks from 1929 through 1981. The truck side of the facility lay dormant from that time until it was utilized for frame and trim operations for the Chevrolet Caprice beginning in spring 1987. The 1990 model year Caprice B-Body model line was the last vehicle produced at Lakewood before the plant closed on August 6. At the time of its demolition some years later, Lakewood was a facility.

Although the system generated relatively high acquittal rates, it was rarely used, in part because it required defendants to give up their rights to appeal the factual determinations made. The system lapsed by the end of World War II.Haley, JO, The Spirit of Japanese Law, Univ. of Georgia Press, 1998, p. 52. In 2009, as a part of a larger judicial reform project, laws came into force to introduce citizen participation in certain criminal trials by introducing lay judges. Lay judges comprise the majority of the judicial panel. They do not form a jury separate from the judges, like in a common law system, but participate in the trial as inquisitorial judges in accordance with the civil law legal tradition, who actively analyze and investigate evidence presented by the defense and prosecution.  Current system  On May 28, 2004, the National Diet passed a law requiring selected citizens to participate as judges (and not juries) in trials for certain severe crimes. Citizens chosen for such service, called , are randomly selected out of the electoral register and, together with professional judges, conduct a public investigation of the evidence in order to determine guilt and sentences. In most cases, the judicial panel is composed of six saiban-in and three professional judges. In cases where there is no substantial dispute over guilt, the panel is composed of four saiban-in and one professional judge. Unlike under the older jury system, the defendants are not allowed to waive trial by saiban-in. The saiban-in system was implemented in May 2009. = Process = In many respects, the new system is very different from a common law jury system. It is not a (lay) jury of an adversarial system of common law but one that involves a (lay) \\"judge\\" found in inquisitorial systems of civil law countries, such as those in continental Europe and Latin America. In a common law adversarial system, the judge acts as a referee over the contest between the defence attorney and the prosecutor, in which the two sides present the facts of their case to the panel of jurors; the judge in this system is mainly the referee of court procedure and decides only the applicable law. In the civil law inquisitorial system, the entire panel of judges conduct a public investigation of the crime at the trial, and pass the verdict and sentence those found guilty. For this reason, each member of the panel can initiate the examination of evidence and witnesses, and by a majority (including at least one professional judge, as explained below) can pass a guilty verdict and impose a penalty.Act Concerning Participation of Lay Assessors in Criminal Trials (Assessor Act), May 28, 2004, Art. 67. Lay judges roles are nevertheless constrained; notably, legal interpretations and determinations remain with the professional judges.Act Concerning Participation of Lay Assessors in Criminal Trials (Assessor Act), May 28, 2004, Art. 6. Unlike the Anglo-American rule for criminal jury trials, both convictions and acquittals as well as sentence remain subject to appeal by the prosecution and the defence. The Japanese system is apparently unique in that the panel consists of six lay judges, chosen randomly from the public, together with three professional judges, who come together for a single trial (like an Anglo-American jury) but serve as lay judges. As with any jury or lay judge system, it places a large amount of judicial power on randomly chosen members of the public with the aim of democratizing the judicial process. In this, Japan's law states its purpose explicitly as seeking ‚Äúthe promotion of the public‚Äôs understanding of the judicial system and . . . their confidence in it.‚ÄùAct Concerning Participation of Lay Assessors in Criminal Trials (Assessor Act), May 28, 2004, Art. 1. A guilty verdict requires a numerical majority of nine judges that includes at least one professional judge. Accordingly, the three professional judges as a collective have a de facto veto on any conviction that would be delivered by the lay judges. The Ministry of Justice specifically avoided using the term \\"jury\\" (Baishin-in) and use the term \\"lay judge\\" (Saiban-in) instead. Therefore, the current system is categorically not a jury system though this misunderstanding persists in common law countries due to lack of understanding of civil law criminal procedure. =First lay judge trial under new law= Katsuyoshi Fuji, 72, was found guilty in the stabbing death of a 66-year-old neighbor and sentenced to 15 years in jail at the first lay-judge trial held in the Tokyo District Court. On August 3, 2009, six citizens were chosen, to serve as ‚Äúsaiban-in,‚Äù to join three judges at the trial attended by 2,500 people queuing to get into the sixty-seat public gallery. Because Fujii had entered a guilty plea, the lay judges' role was primarily pertaining to the severity of the sentence to be handed down. According to the selection process, the judges selected were to be a minimum age of 20 and listed on the election lists. Judges must also have completed a secondary level education. The vote of a majority of the lay judges for acquittal results in acquittal, but for conviction a majority of the lay judges must be accompanied by the vote of at least one professional judge. Lay judges are allowed to directly question the defendant during the course of the trial and decide on the sentence corresponding to the verdict. The trial was open to the media. The previous system relied only on a panel of professional judges, and the majority of cases brought forward by prosecutors were those where conviction was high. Citizens chosen who do not serve in their role would be fined 100,000 yen. =Controversy= As in most common law countries where people are reluctant to serve as jury members, many Japanese have expressed reluctance to serve as lay judges. Polls suggest that, similar to developed jury systems, 70% of the population of Japan would be reluctant to serve as judges. Some Japanese have been introduced to mock trials over recent years to overcome their reluctance to express opinions publicly, debate, and defy authority figures. Others have written with concern regarding the harsh secrecy provision in the statute which includes the risk of criminal penalties for those lay judges who would publicly share confidential deliberation room discussion even after trial proceedings are complete. Another issue is that some criminal trials used to take years if the charge was serious and the defence contested the charge. After the system moved to include lay judges, the trial period was fixed to a maximum of a few weeks. Some commentators feel justice is compromised for the convenience of lay judges and that cases are not examined in enough detail.

A Sergeant in the United States Army, he was attached to Company I, 71st Infantry, 44th Infantry Division during World War II. Pre-War Born to Cardigan Scot Roland MacGillivary and Minnie Quinn, he attended Queens Square School in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada and joined the Merchant Marines at age 16. Shortly thereafter, MacGillivary emigrated to the United States, to live with his older brother in Boston, Massachusetts. When living with his brother, he learned about the Army and considered joining it. After hearing about the attack on Pearl Harbor, he decided the right thing to do was to volunteer for the U.S. Army. In January 1942, he joined the Army as a private soldier and was assigned to the European Theatre of Operations. He told the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and Border Security 50 years later, that when he was in boot camp: > an officer asked me and two other immigrants ... whether we wanted to become > U.S. citizens. [They took us] to a federal courthouse and [swore us] in > before a judge. I thought that if I was going to fight for this country, I > should be a U.S. citizen. Medal of Honor citation MacGillivary's first wartime action came during the Battle of Normandy, landing on Omaha Beach in 1944. From Omaha Beach MacGillivary would be involved in numerous battles throughout France, before reaching W≈ìlfling during the Battle of the Bulge. When his unit was surrounded on January 1, 1945 by the 17th German Panzer Grenadier Division a Waffen-SS Panzer unit in W≈ìlfling, France, MacGillivary, then 27, picked up a machine gun and knocked out four German machine gun nests, killing 36 German soldiers. He lost his left arm in this action. The unit he fought to win his decoration, was given the title G√∂tz von Berlichingen after a 15th-century German knight who lost his right hand. MacGillivary told a Boston Globe reporter in 1995: > I looked down and my left arm wasn‚Äôt there. When you get hit by a machine > gun, it‚Äôs like somebody put a hot poker in you. I stuck the stump of my arm > into the snow, but the warm blood melted the snow. I figured I was dying. > When they rescued me, my arm had a cake of bloody ice frozen around it, > sealing the wound. If it had been summer, I‚Äôd [have been] dead. Other awards For other actions during World War II MacGillivary also received the Purple Heart with three oak leaf clusters, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Bronze Star Medal, the Soldier's Medal, and the French Croix de Guerre. He was also received the American Campaign Medal, European- African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, the World War II Victory Medal and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He is honored with a bronze plaque on the lectern at the George Robert White Fund Memorial at the Veterans Memorial Park in the Back Bay Fens in Boston, Massachusetts. Post-World War II After the war MacGillivary returned home to Boston where for a short time he worked as a special agent for Boston's Treasury Department. He joined the United States Customs Service in 1950 starting as a warehouse officer, but soon became an agent for the United States Customs Office of Investigations, conducting special investigations. His daughter Charlene Corea remembered him as being particularly busy in the winter inspecting Christmas trees that entered the United States from Canada. He retired from the Customs Service in 1975. Sergeant Charles A. MacGillivary was enrolled as a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts the third oldest chartered military organization in the world on April 6, 1992. He was the seventh member of the company to receive the Medal of Honor. Death MacGillivary was a resident of Braintree, Massachusetts from 1957 until his death at age 83 on Saturday June 24, 2000 in the VA Hospital in Brockton, Massachusetts. Rev. Philip Salois, who had himself received a Silver Star in the Vietnam War officiated at the funeral. Then Governor of Massachusetts Paul Cellucci was in attendance at MacGillivary's funeral.

Life and history of aggression  Kasatka was captured off the coast of Iceland on October 26, 1978, at the age of approximately two. She was estimated to be born around late 1976. Her name probably comes from the Russian word Kasatka (Russian: –ö–æ—Å–∞—Ç–∫–∞), a generic name for orcas. Kasatka was captured with her pod-mate Katina. Katina was sent to San Diego, and Kasatka was sent to Ohio. They briefly reunited when Katina was sent to Ohio for the summer season in 1982. For four years the family members spent their time in captivity together, until Katina was sold to SeaWorld Orlando in 1984. After living in all four SeaWorld parks open at the time, she finally ended up in SeaWorld San Diego where she lived the rest of her life. Performing tasks for tourists, she went on to have four calves there. Kasatka was the matriarch and dominant orca in her park. After Kasatka gave birth to her first baby, she proved to be a fiercely protective mother and aggressive acts and incidents started to increase. According to David Kirby‚Äôs Death at SeaWorld, ‚ÄúSometimes when Takara called for her mother, Kasatka would split from the trainer‚Äôs control to spend time with her calf at the gate, or swim in angry circles around the pool until finally responding to a call-back signal to the stage. Kasatka grew more aggressive with trainers in the water after Takara was born.‚Äù These signs of aggression continued. In June 1993, Kasatka tried to bite her trainer Ken Peters. In June 1999, Kasatka again attempted to attack Peters, she circled him at high speeds and charged before they got him out of the water safe. In November 2006, Kasatka finally got a hold of Ken Peters. In the middle of a performance with thousands in attendance, Kasatka grabbed hold of Peters foot. She pulled the trainer down to the bottom of the tank numerous times. Held onto the trainer for a prolonged amount of time. People argue his relationship with Kasatka was the reason she finally let go of the trainer. He was able to get out of the tank, with injuries sustained to both feet. .  Illness and death  On August 1, 2016, SeaWorld announced publicly that Kasatka had been receiving treatment for bacterial respiratory infection. They first reported it was because of her age and weak immune system. In a statement on its website, SeaWorld wrote, \\"as her immune system aged, it became more difficult for her to fend off the illness and her medication took longer to have an effect.\\" Reports say that the infection started in 2008. Which means Kasatka had given birth while being treated for this infection. John Hargrove was a former seaworld trainer. Hargrove told Dolphin Project that ‚Äúcaptive orcas are regularly treated for persistent fungal infections. The severity of this fungal infection (Kasatkas) demonstrates the diminished capacity of Kasatka‚Äôs own immune system ‚Ä¶ Sadly, when I look at this photo, all I see is a diseased whale. Historically, when a necropsy is performed on an animal with this level of fungal infection, the fungal lesions are far worse internally than they are externally. It is also an incredibly painful way to die.‚Äù She was long and weighed at time of death. Kasatka was euthanized at age 40 on August 15, 2017. Offspring Kasatka was the matriarch of the San Diego Orca Seaworld group. She was the first captive cetacean to successively receive artificial insemination, according to John Hargrove, a trainer there. According to the Times of San Diego, Kasatka has been bred numerous times. She‚Äôs given birth to four calves and is a grandmother or great-grandmother to eight other orcas. She bore two daughters and two sons, resulting in 6 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren by the time of her death: *Takara (born 1991), female (SeaWorld San Antonio). Takara was the first born, they only lived together for 4 years before Takara was sold away. *Nakai (born September 1, 2001), male (Seaworld San Diego); first orca conceived by artificial insemination. Nakai was her first son and second child. He was separated from his mother, sold away where he was attacked by other orcas forcing him to lose most of his jaw. *Kalia (born December 21, 2004), female (SeaWorld San Diego). Kalia was the third child of Kasatka. *Makani (born February 14, 2013), male (SeaWorld San Diego).

Historians use the term \\"Democratic-Republican\\" to describe the societies, but the societies rarely ever used the name \\"Democratic-Republican.\\" They called themselves \\"Democratic,\\" \\"Republican,\\" \\"True Republican,\\" \\"Constitutional,\\" \\"United Freeman,\\" \\"Patriotic,\\" \\"Political,\\" \\"Franklin,\\" and \\"Madisonian.\\"Foner found only two that used the actual term \\"Democratic-Republican\\" including the \\"Democratic-Republican Society of Dumfries\\" Virginia, 1794. Foner and Morris, The Democratic- Republican Societies, pp 350, 370. The Germans of Philadelphia began the first society in April 1793, inspired by Peter Muhlenberg. Philadelphia was then the national capital and soon an English-speaking society was formed in the city by David Rittenhouse, Charles Biddle (a prominent Quaker merchant), Dr. George Logan and Alexander J. Dallas. Its charter was widely copied. At least 35 societies sprang up by 1795, located in most important American cities. Many leaders soon became active in Jefferson's Democratic-Republican Party, a national political party he founded. As foreign affairs became dominant issues of the day, members of such groups opposed the British and rallied behind Jefferson, proclaiming their friendship with France. Activities The societies usually met once a month, or more often during election season. Applicants for membership had to have five members attest to their \\"firm and steadfast friend of EQUAL RIGHTS OF MAN\\" and a couple members could blackball an applicant. \\"Apostasy from Republican principles\\" was ground for expulsion. Officers were rotated regularly‚Äîin one case every month. The societies politicked in local elections officially or quietly. They often joined parades and celebrations of July Fourth, and were credited in 1794 with having made that day \\"more universally celebrated\\" than it had been. They also celebrated July 14‚ÄîFrench Bastille Day. Some societies engaged in direct action to help France in her war with Britain, such as equipping French privateers. Endless discussions and rounds of resolutions fill the minute books; most common were general addresses and resolutions critical of the Washington administration. In western states, members of the societies agitated against the British for holding the frontier posts and against the Spanish for closing the Mississippi River; in the East, they denounced Britain for \\"piracy\\" against American shipping. In the Carolinas they demanded a uniform currency and adequate representation for the growing back country. The societies strongly protested the excise tax on whiskey. They denounced John Jay as special envoy to London and vehemently repudiated the treaty he brought back. They complained about secret sessions of Congress and the state legislatures, demanding that public officials abandon the use of \\"dark, intricate, antiquated formalities\\" and \\"obsolete phraseology\\" that only lawyers and classical scholars could understand.Foner and Morris, p. 10 Grievances The societies viewed excessive power as the enemy of liberty and were wary of the undue, corrupt accumulation of power in the central government. The Society of Newcastle, Delaware said, \\"If we consult the lamentable annals of mankind, and cast our eyes back over the historic page we shall find this solemn truth recorded in large characters; that all governments however free in their origin, have in the end degenerated into despotism.\\" These societies adhered to Jeffersonian thought and believed the infant nation was fragile and needed careful protection by a vigilant population. The societies feared that Hamilton‚Äôs financial policies edged too close to English aristocracy; they saw the policies as ‚Äúprescriptions of Aristocracy, under the masque of Federalism.‚Äù They opposed the growing class of commercial elites and speculators. One society in NYC said they had ‚Äúless respect to the consuming speculator, who wallows in luxury, than to the productive mechanic who struggles with indigence.‚Äù The societies grieved a lack of virtue and patriotism in the 1790s. They viewed \\"jealousy\\" and suspicion of the government not as protest, but as the duty of a virtuous, vigilant citizen to maintain the republic. Tunis Wortman, secretary of the Democratic Society of New York stated, ‚ÄúIt is a truth too evident to be disguised, that since the completion and final establishment of our revolution, the flame of liberty has burned less bright, and become less universal in its operation. The charms of wealth, the allurements of luxury, the thirst for gain and the ruinous system of speculation, have borne down like the irresistible flood upon us, and have threatened destruction to the most valuable elements of social life:-the desire of affluence and the love of ease, have absorbed every honorable and patriotic consideration; have rendered us supine and indolent, and have nearly banished from our minds the sentiment of public virtue, destroyed the ardor of liberty, and diminished our attachment to the sacred interests of our country.‚ÄùSchoenbachler. 237-61. Doctrines The societies preached equal justice and a general diffusion of knowledge as essential \\"pillars supporting the sacred temple of liberty.\\" A primary purpose of the societies was to disseminate political information, as members believed ignorance was the greatest threat to democracy. They worked closely with republican newspaper editors, publishing numerous letters, editorials and essays. \\"To support and perpetuate the EQUAL RIGHTS OF MAN\\" was the New York society's \\"great object,\\" and toward that end they would \\"constantly express our sentiments.\\" The \\"Equal Rights of Man\\" meant to them the right to freedoms of speech, press, and assembly; the right to criticize governmental representatives and to demand an explanation of their public acts; and the right to publish their reactions in a free press.Foner and Morris, p. 11 Born from the grassroots organization of the Sons of Liberty, the societies challenged existing notions of the social and political hierarchy. The societies united disparate groups of people from different classes. Usually lower and middle classes, made up of farmers, artisans, mechanics, and common laborers were led by richer merchants, local politicians, militia captains, naval officers, doctors, lawyers, and printers. Their persistence of egalitarian and republican thought revolutionized ideas about liberty through the Jacksonian era and beyond. The members often included dissenting teachers and theologians striving to create a more progressive, humanitarian, and enlightened society. Their ideas were also influenced by classical and modern republicanism, particularly the works of Aristotle and Machiavelli, and by the 'Common Sense' philosophy of the Scottish Enlightenment. This philosophy led the societies to oppose many of the Federalist Party policies. The societies advocated both a system of publicly funded and locally controlled education for all classes and a broadening of the franchise. Standing to Jefferson's ideological left, they advocated a much more democratic political agenda than he supported, including attempts to create a permanent organization of popular dissent directed against the federal government and an educational philosophy based on a dialectical and democratic approach to learning.Dotts 2005 =Pennsylvania frontier and Whiskey Rebellion= Most societies were urban but three formed on Pennsylvania's western frontier, the Democratic Republican Society of the County of Washington, the Society of United Freemen of Mingo Creek, and the Republican Society at the Mouth of the Youghiogheny. Members dreamed of a yeoman farmer empire and thought that western farmers were exploited by wealthy easterners, particularly merchants and land speculators. They demanded justice and were careful not to address with deference those who possessed wealth and power. They considered the whiskey tax inspector John Neville, a reasonably wealthy man, as an agent of their eastern enemies. James McFarlane, chairman of the Society of United Freemen, was killed while trying to force Neville's resignation, an event that triggered the Whiskey Rebellion.Sioli 1994 Decline The Federalists opposed such groups, saying they had been started by Citizen Gen√™t as a tool of the revolutionary government in Paris. Members responded by claiming they were inspired by the Sons of Liberty, the Whig Clubs and other republican groups of the 1770s. President Washington vehemently denounced the societies in late 1794, following his successful quelling of the Whiskey Rebellion. Washington complained that the Democratic- Republican societies in western Pennsylvania had helped instigate the revolt and thus were enemies of the new government and nation. By 1796, most of the groups had disbanded. As educational organizations, they had some influence. They believed that a republican nation required citizens to act together to deal with social problems at the grass roots. The mobilized citizenry was essential to defeat aristocracy (which they identified with Alexander Hamilton). In opposing rule by the few, they helped define what rule by the many might be.

Willow Run Assembly was a General Motors automobile factory near Ypsilanti, Michigan, located at 2625 Tyler Road, in the Willow Run manufacturing complex. Willow Run Assembly consisted of an assembly plant of 2.3 million square feet, another building that was known in later years as Willow Run Company Vehicle Operations, covering 23,000 square feet on 22 acres of land, and perhaps other parcels. Willow Run Assembly was to the south of the former Willow Run Transmission, the site of the bomber plant built by Ford in 1941. Production of automobiles began at Willow Run in 1959 with the Chevrolet Corvair; Willow Run also built the Chevrolet Nova (1962-1979), the X-bodies (1980-1985), the GM H body, and the Chevrolet Caprice. Corvairs were assembled at Willow Run during the car's entire 10-year production run. On May 14, 1969, the media was invited to Willow Run as the last Corvair came down the line; a departure from GM's policy of not permitting reporters to visit their manufacturing facilities. In 1968, General Motors began reorganizing its body and assembly operations into the GM Assembly Division (GMAD). GMAD required 16 years to completely absorb Fisher Body's operations, and Fisher would manufacture bodies at Willow Run until the 1970s. Assembly operations at Willow Run ended in July 1993 after a reduction in demand for the full-size B-bodies of the time. Operations were transferred to the Arlington Assembly Plant in Texas. What was the main plant at Willow Run Assembly had by 2010 become a giant warehouse, the Willow Run Business Center, part of which was leased to GM for use as a parts distribution facility. Willow Run Company Vehicle Operations became part of the abandoned GM properties managed by the RACER Trust in March 2011; in April 2013, RACER sold the Company Vehicle Operations facility to International Turbine Industries, an engine maintenance and repair company headquartered across Tyler Road from the former assembly plant.

It was the state's worst mine disaster, killing 82 men. Sigmund Kozma was the last remaining survivor of the disaster, passing away on January 3, 2009. Disaster Poston Mine Number 6 was said to be the Sunday Creek Coal Company's best mine and safest in the Hocking Valley. The explosion occurred 10,200 feet from the main shaft around 11:45 am. It was the result of an accumulation of gas in section 6 North, which was known for being gassy. The ignition was believed to be caused by an electrical arc between a fallen trolley wire and the rail. The section of the trolley rail where the explosion occurred was broken and therefore inactive. There was no reason for power to be on that line. The explosion caused many of the walls to cave in, wrecking the interior. It was so powerful that cars were pulled off tracks and beams were twisted up to 760 feet from the main shaft. Equipment was also found scorched near the explosion site. The mine had recently undergone improvement and they were in the process of making more. The President of Sunday Creek Coal Company, W.E. Tytus, was giving other top executives a tour of the new safety equipment at the time of the explosion. They entered the main shaft half an hour previous to the explosion and had made it about one and a half miles into the mine. These men were killed in the disaster.  Rescue  There were about 250 men at the mine that day and many of them were able escape after the explosion. Nearly 120 men escaped from the interior of the mine one way or another. Many of them used the ventilation shafts as exits. Most of the men lost in the disaster died from carbon monoxide asphyxiation. Only two men were believed to have been killed by serious burns from explosion. Distress calls were made to Columbus, Nelsonville, Cambridge, and Pittsburgh. Twenty- four Red Cross nurses, local doctors, and Salvation Army volunteers came to help the injured. About four hours after the explosion, the Chief Inspector, W.E. Smith, of the United States Bureau of Mines and three other inspectors arrived with mine rescue teams and equipment. Ten hours after the explosion, a rescue team found 19 men that barricaded themselves from the gas after the explosion. They used sheets of burlap, mud and sticks to protect themselves from the carbon monoxide. Only two of them were found conscious, but all survived. They were about three miles from the shaft entrance. Foreman John Dean was responsible for saving these men. He led the survivors to a ventilation partition used to protect them and risked his life in several trips. A dozen mules were brought in to retrieve the bodies and wreckage from the mine because it lost power after the explosion. It was important to work fast because there was fear of a second explosion. It wasn't until midnight that the first bodies were recovered. Seventy-three employees, five officials, and four visitors made up the eighty-two men that died in the disaster. Aftermath Sunday Creek Coal Company turned a storage room, pool hall, and store into temporary morgues. With a population of only about 1,500, the community of Millfield was profoundly affected; many families in the small community lost someone. The disaster created 59 widows and 154 orphans, and 14 families lost multiple family members. Many of those lucky enough to escape the mine suffered from poor health afterwards. The mine was not cleared of carbon monoxide until November 9, 1930. It was reopened about one month after the disaster and remained functioning until 1945. The Ohio State Mining Department investigated the cause of the explosion and later stated that Sunday Creek Coal Company was not responsible in regards to the orders, regulations, and recommendations in place at the time.  Legacy  The disaster attracted national press coverage and international attention, and it prompted improvement of Ohio's mine safety laws in 1931. A monument was erected in 1975 near the Millfield disaster site with the names of the men that were lost and the smokestack at Mine No. 6 still stands today. The Millfield Mine Memorial Committee was started in 1973 to honor the dead and remember the tragedy in their community. They hold an annual memorial service.  Sigmund Kozma  Sigmund Kozma, who was 16 at the time he survived the explosion, was recently identified as the last living survivor of the Millfield Mine disaster. He was loading coal with his father and twelve others about 500 feet from the blast. These men barricaded themselves from the poisonous gas and climbed up a ventilation shaft. It took them three hours to escape the mine. He was featured in a documentary of the explosion by Justin Zimmerman, entitled \\"Meeting Again\\". Sigmund Kozma died on January 3, 2009, coincidentally on the same day as his wife. He is survived by his 5 daughters.Elderly couple dies 90 minutes apart See also *List of mining disasters References External links *Millfield Tragedy Revisited Ohio Geology, Fall 1995. *Millfield Mine Disaster Correction Ohio Geology, Winter 1996. *Millfield Coal Mine Disaster *\\"Meeting Again\\" at brickerdown.com * Category:Coal mining disasters in Ohio Category:Athens County, Ohio Category:1930 mining disasters Category:1930 in Ohio Category:1930 disasters in the United States Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Ohio ","title":"Millfield Mine disaster"},{"id":"3612804","text":"Thomas Allen, 18th-century engraving by James Bretherton Thomas Allen (or Alleyn) (21 December 154230 September 1632) was an English mathematician and astrologer. Highly reputed in his lifetime, he published little, but was an active private teacher of mathematics. He was also well connected in the English intellectual networks of the period. Early life He was born in Uttoxeter, Staffordshire. He was admitted scholar of Trinity College, Oxford, in 1561; and graduated as M.A. in 1567. In 1571 he left his college and fellowship, and moved to Gloucester Hall. He became known for his knowledge of antiquity, philosophy, and mathematics. At Gloucester Hall Gloucester Hall suited Allen, a sympathiser at least with Catholicism, because there was no stringent religious observance required there; indeed there was no chapel in the Hall. Allen's beliefs have been classified as \\"church papist\\", but also his posture as \\"crypto-Catholic\\": a Catholic faith combined with outward conformity to the Church of England.Foster, p. 99. He joined there his friends Edmund Reynolds, Miles Windsor, and George Napper, who had also left their colleges at a time of increasing religious tensions on Oxford; Napper was to be a Catholic martyr. Trinity shed six more of its Fellows within a few years.Foster, p. 104. Allen encouraged other scholars to migrate there, such as John Budden and William Burton. He had a wide range of pupils and followers: Kenelm Digby and Brian Twyne in natural philosophy, with Theodore Haak coming later. The mathematical school of Allen included Thomas Harriot and Walter Warner, and Sir John Davies (to whom Allen taught Catholic doctrine). Mathematical geography was an important topical subject in which Allen was reputed, pursued by several groups in England, including another around Henry Briggs: Allen may have taught the geographer Richard Hakluyt. He did teach Robert Fludd and Sir Thomas Aylesbury. In the humanities there were Robert Hegge, and William Fulbecke. When the Camden Chair of Ancient History was being set up in the early 1620s, Allen successfully supported the candidacy of Degory Wheare with William Camden; and a few years later, in 1626, Wheare came to Gloucester Hall as Principal. Allen died at Gloucester Hall. Other associations Allen corresponded with Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland. Northumberland invited Allen to visit, and he spent some time with the Syon House group around the Earl; he became acquainted with Thomas Harriot, John Dee, and other mathematicians. He also knew well Sir Robert Cotton, William Camden, and their antiquarian associates. He pointed out the historian √Üthelweard (Fabius Quaestor) to Camden.philological.bham.ac.uk, Camden, English-Saxons. Astrologer Allen was noted as astrologer to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, as Dee was for Queen Elizabeth.A. L. Rowse, Simon Forman: Sex and Society in Shakespeare's Age (1974), p. 7. Foster believes Allen probably met Leicester through Lady Paulet, wife of Hugh Paulet, n√©e Elizabeth Blount, who was the widow of Sir Thomas Pope, the founder of Trinity College, Oxford.Foster, p. 120. There is a surviving 62-page horoscope cast for the teenage Philip Sidney in the Ashmole manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, in the period 1570‚Äì2 when he was studying at Oxford, where Leicester was Chancellor, and it has been attributed to Allen; the case has also been made that it was by Dee. A link between the two is that Edward Kelley is said to have worked briefly for Allen.Katherine Duncan-Jones, Sir Philip Sidney, Courtier Poet (1991), pp. 50‚Äì1.Peter J. French, John Dee: The World of an Elizabethan Magus, p. 129 note 4, and p. 113 note 2. Allen definitely cast a natal horoscope for Robert Pierrepont (1584), and cast also for William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke, a later Chancellor of Oxford, in 1626.Foster, p. 124. Reputation Allen's skill in mathematics and astrology earned him the credit of being a magician. In an incident related in John Aubrey's Brief Lives, it was in a visit to Holme Lacy as the guest of Sir John Scudamore that the servants threw his ticking watch into the moat, thinking it the Devil.Hugh Trevor-Roper, Archbishop Laud (2000), p. 62. The author of Leicester's Commonwealth accuses him of employing the art of \\"figuring\\" to further the earl of Leicester's unlawful designs, and of endeavouring by the \\"black art\\" to bring about a match between his patron and the Queen. There Allen's name is coupled with Dee's as atheists, in a series of claims that Leicester found physicians and other lackeys for his evil-doing at Oxford and elsewhere.Frank J. Burgoyne, History of Queen Elizabeth, Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leicester being a reprint of \\"Leycesters commonwealth\\", 1641 (1904), pp. 99‚Äì100; archive.org. After his death, funeral orations praising Allen were given by William Burton and George Bathurst (1610‚Äì1644). Burton's retailed the story of how Leicester had offered a bishopric to Allen, who declined the offer. Allen in fact was, by choice, not in holy orders.Forster, p. 127. Works He wrote a Latin commentary on the second and third books of Claudius Ptolemy of Pelusium, Concerning the Judgment of the Stars, or, as it is commonly called, Of the Quadripartite Construction, with an Exposition. He also wrote notes on John Bale's De Scriptoribus M. Britanniae. Library and legacy Allen collected manuscripts relating to history, antiquity, astronomy and astrology, philosophy, and mathematics. At least 250 items from his library can still be traced. He also acquired manuscripts from dissolved monasteries, such as Reading Abbey, for which his sources may have been Gerbrand Harkes, the Protestant dealer, and Clement Burdett. A considerable part of Allen's collection was presented to the Bodleian Library by Sir Kenelm Digby, to whom it had been left: over 200 manuscripts, which were rebound in calf. This bequest was strong in works by early English scientists, including Roger Bacon, Simon Bredon, John Eschenden, Robert Grosseteste, John Sharp, and Richard Wallingford. But Allen's library was in flux during his lifetime, as he lent or gave items, and was consulted by others. He was a significant supporter of Sir Thomas Bodley's effort to found the Library; and gave it a number of works. Some went to the Cottonian Library, presumably via Richard James. Sir Thomas Aylesbury, another former pupil, was another one of Allen's major legatees. The Cuthbert Gospel of St John, seen in his library by James Ussher, appears to have left his possession by 1622, as it is not in a catalogue of that date. Ussher wrote to Camden in 1606 of the help he had had from Allen's collection, consulting William of Malmesbury, and a papal bull from Giraldus Cambrensis via Johannes Rossus.Charles Richard Elrington The Whole Works of the Most.

It was closed in 1988. The factory produced the A-bodies and J-bodies. The Leeds Assembly Plant is located in the Leeds district of Kansas City, Missouri, at 6817 Stadium Drive. The GM operations are closed, and the facility has been sold and is now used as a warehouse and for outdoor storage. At its peak employment, over 4,500 persons hourly and salary worked at the Leeds plant producing 60 vehicles per hour on two production shifts. The early years The Leeds Assembly Plant began operations in 1929 as two separate divisions with GM-controlled Fisher Body and Chevrolet plants under one roof. Each division had its own staff including engineers and administrative positions. The wall down the length of the Leeds facility completely separated operations of Fisher Body and Chevrolet operations, and the car bodies were literally pushed through a hole in the wall from Fisher Body to the Chevrolet side. The Leeds sit-down strike The Leeds plant was one of the earliest sit-down strike locations, following the initial sit-down strike at the assembly plant in Atlanta. On December 16, 1936, Fisher Body workers began an eight-day strike that only ended because of the inability to bring food into the plant for workers. The basis for the strike was the firing of an employee the previous day; however Fisher Body employees were said to be paid less than Chevrolet workers and were to have had less job security, and the United Auto Workers (UAW) was pressing for national recognition of the union. Without car bodies being passed through the hole, the production of Chevrolet vehicles quickly ceased. On February 17, 1937, two months after UAW members at the Leeds plant sat down on their jobs, GM recognized the UAW, altering automobile labor relations. General Motors Assembly Division (GMAD) General Motors maintained the two division production at the Leeds Assembly plant for 40 Years The Fisher/Chevy Wall in the Leeds assembly came down in 1969 when the General Motors Assembly Division (GMAD) was formed. This consolidated all assembly operations under one division. General Motors divisions (Fisher Body, Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Cadillac and GMC) were divested of assembly responsibilities. In the 1970s Leeds produced the classic Chevrolet Monte Carlo, the Chevrolet Malibu, and the Chevrolet El Camino. BOC and the J-Car Leeds Assembly operated under GMAD until the early 1980s when the GM assembly operations were reconfigured into the Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac division (BOC) and the Chevrolet-Pontiac-GM Canada (CPC), with Leeds being placed in the BOC division. Following a plant retooling, Leeds produced the downsized Monte Carlo and Malibu, but after mediocre sales of the downsized vehicles, Leeds became one of four assembly plants chosen to produce the J-Car; the other plants were in Janesville, Wisconsin, Southgate in California, and Lordstown, Ohio. Leeds was the primary producer of the Buick Skyhawk and the Oldsmobile Firenza, with subsequent addition of Chevrolet Cavalier production. Floods The plant is physically located close to the Blue River. Beginning in the late 1970s the plant was subjected to flooding due to street runoff into storm drains upstream in Missouri and Kansas. In 1977 of water flooded the production area throughout the plant; three days later the plant was back in production. The plant flooded one more time while in production, and a third and final time after production had ceased. Closing The Leeds Assembly plant officially ceased automobile production on April 15, 1988. The landlocked facility was bordered on the east and west by railroad tracks, on the south by the Blue River, and was not a candidate for expansion. Attempts to bring the Chevrolet S-10 pickup truck to Leeds were not successful.

He was one of the leading figures in the musically progressive Ferrara school in the late 16th century, and one of the earliest composers in the seconda pratica style at the transition to the Baroque era. Life Fontanelli was born in Reggio nell'Emilia, the son of Count Emilio Fontanelli. His early musical education was with composer Gasparo Pratoneri, and he evidently showed a talent for writing as well; a number of his lyric poems survive. He married for the first time in 1580, and in 1584 began his career as a courtier, statesman, and musician to the Este family in Ferrara. It was in the employ of the Este family that he first went to Rome in 1586; while there he probably met the renowned madrigalist Luca Marenzio, as well as members of the Roman school of composition, aspects of whose style appear in his music. His diplomatic activity while in Rome enhanced his reputation greatly, for in 1588 he received two honors: he was named \\"music counselor\\" to the Accademia de Parteni in Ferrara, and he was made a gentleman of the Ferrara court. He rose steadily in influence between then and its dissolution in 1597, when the ruling Este family was removed to Modena and the region of Ferrara was absorbed into the Papal States. Fontanelli probably wrote most of his surviving compositions during the 1590s, and immediately after 1600. Not only was he active as a musician at the Ferrara court during the earlier part of this period, but he was active as a diplomat and statesman, traveling to the Gonzaga court in Mantua and the Medici in Florence, and mingling with local musicians in each place. In 1594 he traveled extensively with Carlo Gesualdo, going to Venice, Florence, Naples, and Venosa with the notorious composer and murderer. A correspondence from himself to his patron Alfonso II d'Este survives, containing much information on musical practice of the period.Newcomb, Anthony. \\"Carlo Gesualdo and a musical correspondence of 1594\\" in The Musical Quarterly, October 1968, vol. LIV no. 4 In 1591 Fontanelli's first wife died, and he married again, to Maria Biancoli, a marriage which was to prove troublesome. After the Este family moved to Modena, Fontanelli followed them there, maintaining his capacity as a diplomat: in 1600 and 1601 he went to Rome and Florence on their behalf. In November 1601, he discovered that his wife had been having an affair, and he murdered her lover (unlike Gesualdo, who in similar circumstances murdered them both, Fontanelli spared his wife); as a punishment he was stripped of his possessions and banished from the Este lands. He found refuge with the opulent Roman household of Cardinal Alessandro d‚ÄôEste, the younger brother of Duke Cesare who had banished him from Modena, and continued his musical life in Rome. By 1605 he had repaired his ties with Duke Cesare, and became the official representative of the Este family in Rome. Whether he repented of the murder, or was retained because of his exceptional skill as a diplomat, is not known. During the next ten years he traveled widely, including a stay in Florence to try to mediate conflicts among the Medici court musicians, and a sojourn in Spain in 1611 and 1612 as the Este representative. By 1615 he evidently had settled in Rome, becoming prominent in the musical life there; however no works of his from these years seem to have survived. Many surviving letters between members of the Roman aristocracy and church hierarchy however survive, giving many details of the musical life there, and Fontanelli's prominent position within it. Fontanelli became a priest in 1621, and died in early 1622 from an insect bite while in the Oratorio della Chiesa Nuova. Music and influence Along with Luzzasco Luzzaschi and Carlo Gesualdo, Fontanelli was one of the leaders of the Ferrarese school of madrigal composition in the last decade of the 1590s. His music was long neglected, coming again to light again towards the end of the 20th century. Gustave Reese, in his encyclopedic Music of the Renaissance, never mentions him, yet Alfred Einstein, in his comprehensive The Italian Madrigal, praised him as being the finest of the nobleman-composers at the end of the 16th century, a category that would include Gesualdo as well as Alessandro Striggio. Fontanelli apparently wrote only madrigals; neither sacred music nor specifically instrumental music has survived, even though he seems to have written some sacred music for the Oratorio dei Filippini at the Chiesa Nuova towards the end of his life. He published two books of madrigals, both for five voices: the first in Ferrara in 1595 printed by Vittorio Baldini, and the second in Venice in 1604 by Angelo Gardano.\\"A musical correspondence\\" In addition, 16 other madrigals, some of which are of uncertain authorship, have been attributed to him. Like Gesualdo and Luzzaschi, Fontanelli wrote madrigals which were intended to be appreciated by a small audience of connoisseurs, particularly the musica secreta of Alfonso II d'Este. Stylistically his music uses the most progressive techniques of the time, including chromaticism and cross-relations; unlike Gesualdo, however, the chromaticism is not a defining feature of his music. Most of Fontanelli's pieces are short, requiring less than three minutes to perform. None are obviously intended for arrangement for solo voice and accompaniment by a plucked chordal instrument (as are many of Luzzaschi's madrigals), being contrapuntal and disjunct in texture, and avoiding a dominant soprano line. Many of his madrigals, particularly from his first book, are written for two or three soprano voices, suggesting that they were written for the concerto delle donne. The second book of madrigals (1604), some of which must have been written in Rome (but were published in Venice), contains some pieces in a simpler polyphonic style, recalling the madrigalian style of decades before. This style was harmonious with the tastes of the Roman School composers, performers, and listeners, who were more conservative than the esoteric Ferrara school, and unaccustomed to its experimental music.

It also offers online hotel reservations and bookings for transportation, lodging, travel experiences, and restaurants. Its headquarters are in Needham, Massachusetts. History Stephen Kaufer, CEO, TripAdvisor Tripadvisor was founded by Kaufer, Steinert, Shanny, and Palka in February 2000. Kaufer said the original idea wasn't a user generated social media site to swap reviews: > \\"We started as a site where we were focused more on those official words > from guidebooks or newspapers or magazines. We also had a button in the very > beginning that said, 'Visitors add your own review', and boy, did that just > take off.\\" Seed money was obtained from Flagship Ventures, the Bollard Group, and private investors.  Ownership  In 2004, the company was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp. In August 2005, IAC spun off its travel group of businesses under the Expedia, Inc. name. In April 2009, Tripadvisor launched in China. In September 2010, SmarterTravel, part of TripAdvisor Media Group, launched SniqueAway (now Jetsetter), the first members-only site where each travel deal is endorsed by member reviews. In April 2011, Expedia, then led by Dara Khosrowshahi, announced that it would split into two publicly traded companies by spinning off TripAdvisor. The corporate spin-off was completed in December 2011. In November 2018, the company added DoorDash to its restaurant listings. In February 2020, the company changed its name from TripAdvisor to Tripadvisor, using a lowercase \\"a\\".  Composition and brands  The company's most notable brand, Tripadvisor.com, reached 463 million average monthly unique visitors in 2019. The website has versions in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. It features approximately 859 million reviews and opinions on approximately 8.6 million establishments‚Äîincluding 1.4 million hotels, inns, bed and breakfasts and specialty lodging, 842,000 rental properties, 5.2 million restaurants, and 1.2 million travel experiences worldwide. In 2019, Tripadvisor earned 33% of its revenues from Expedia Group and Booking Holdings and their subsidiaries, primarily for pay-per-click advertising.

In April 2018, the company acquired Icelandic startup Bokun, a provider of software for travel booking. Controversies =Criticism of reviews= Tripadvisor has been the subject of controversy for allowing unsubstantiated anonymous reviews to be posted about any hotel, bed and breakfast, inn, or restaurant.  Fake reviews  In March 2014, TripAdvisor's Chinese site came under scrutiny when a user was found to have reviewed 51 Parisian restaurants in one month, while also reviewing 50 hotels in other countries. In November 2017, Oobah Butler, a journalist for Vice Media, claimed to have made money posting positive reviews for restaurants he never visited, in exchange for payment. In September 2019, consumer organisation Which? said TripAdvisor was still failing to stop fake reviews. Its survey of nearly 250,000 reviews for the ten top-ranked hotels in ten popular tourist destinations around the world found that one in seven had \\"blatant hallmarks\\" of fake positive reviews. TripAdvisor responded: \\"We are committed to ensuring reviews on TripAdvisor offer useful and accurate information, and we are very aggressive in catching fake reviews and pursuing the fraudsters behind them.\\"  Phantom establishments  In May 2013, a fake restaurant was set up by a disgruntled businessman and reportedly had diners looking for the eatery in an alley filled with garbage cans. The fake listing went undetected on TripAdvisor for about two months. In November 2017, journalist Oobah Butler used fake reviews to boost a nonexistent restaurant named The Shed at Dulwich to the top of TripAdvisor rankings for restaurants in London.  Reviews alleging crime  Headquarters, Needham, Massachusetts In November 2017, it was reported that TripAdvisor had deleted numerous reviews which contained allegations of serious criminal activity at resorts in Playa del Carmen, Yucat√°n Peninsula, Mexico. The deleted reviews included those from two women who were raped at the Iberostar Paraiso Maya in separate incidents 2010 and 2015, one of which involved a hotel security guard. The women said they received assurances from hotel staff that they would help out and contact the authorities, but the staff failed to take any follow-up action. The women then posted advisories and warnings on TripAdvisor, but the reviews were deleted. The review of first victim, Kristie Love, was eventually reinstated, but the company claimed the review of the second victim, Jamie Valeri, was \\"hearsay\\" and it was not reinstated. The reports also highlighted at least 12 other such incidents at hotels and resorts across Mexico, including one of a 29-year-old man who was raped by a massage therapist at a resort in the same area, where reviewers had attempted to warn people through reviews on the company's site about criminal incidents that the resorts and local authorities had failed to pursue any criminal or legal action for, only to have those reviews either taken down or declined for posting by TripAdvisor.  Reviews in exchange for inducements  In October 2015, an ex-hotel manager at Australian property manager Meriton said guests were offered inducements to change ratings they left on the site. In 2018, Meriton was fined AU$3 million by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission for misleading consumers.  Malicious reviews  In March 2015, Dietmar Doering, a German hotelier based in Sri Lanka accused TripAdvisor of hosting malicious reviews of his resort The Cosy Beach in Marawila. He claimed he was compelled to take legal action for the estimated damages of US$500,000. In 2012, an action was brought in a Sheriff Court in Scotland, by Richard Gollin, the owner of a guesthouse in the Outer Hebrides who claimed damages for malicious statements. TripAdvisor asserted that the Scottish courts lacked jurisdiction. The outcome of this case was called a \\"landmark victory\\". TripAdvisor conceded that it could be sued in the UK's jurisdictions (having previously claimed to be outside the remit of Scots law because it is based in Massachusetts). The court ruled that TripAdvisor's terms of use constituted a contract, which was actionable/enforceable by the business being reviewed. The case was found to involve issues relating to the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Act of 1977, and these issues were referred to a higher court in Stornoway. The plaintiff eventually dropped the case because he could not afford to pursue it.  Fine for Improper commercial practices  In December 2014, the Italian Antitrust Authority fined TripAdvisor ‚Ç¨500,000 for improper commercial practices on the TripAdvisor website. The Italian Authority said TripAdvisor and its Italian arm should stop publishing misleading information about the sources of the reviews. In June 2015, a fake restaurant created by a newspaper rose to the top of the site's rankings in Italy. In August 2013, Kenneth Seaton lost a $10 million lawsuit against the company in which he claimed that the ranking for his Grand Resort Hotel and Convention Center in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, as \\"America's dirtiest hotel\\" was based on unsubstantiated rumors.  Breaches of Advertising Standards  In September 2011, after receiving a complaint submitted by online investigations company KwikChex, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) launched a formal investigation into TripAdvisor's claims to provide trustworthy and honest reviews from travelers. The ASA found that TripAdvisor \\"should not claim or imply that all its reviews were from real travellers, or were honest, real or trusted\\", and as a result of the investigation, TripAdvisor was ordered to remove the slogan \\"reviews you can trust\\" from its UK web site. It changed its hotel review section slogan to \\"reviews from our community\\". TripAdvisor said the branding change had been planned for some time and that changes began in June 2011, before the ASA investigation. ASA commented that \\"it was concerned that consumers might be fooled by fraudulent posts since the entries could be made without any form of verification\\", but recognized that TripAdvisor used \\"advanced and highly effective fraud systems\\" in an attempt to identify and remove fake content.TripAdvisor booth at ITB Berlin, 2014Approximately 30 hotels have been penalized on the website by the company for suspicious reviews, including a Cornwall hotel that bribed guests to leave positive reviews of the hotel.TripAdvisor store at Toronto Pearson International AirportTripadvisor has stated that reviews are subject to a verification process which considers the IP address and email address of the author, and tries to detect any suspicious patterns or obscene or abusive language. The website also allows the community of users to report suspicious content, which is then assessed by TripAdvisor staff. =Data protection breach= In March 2011, Tripadvisor informed its members that it suffered a data breach and an unauthorized party had stolen some of its email list and might use it for spamming. No passwords or other information was stolen. =Drip pricing= In July 2012, Tripadvisor was fined $80,000 by the United States Department of Transportation for violating fair trading regulations requiring taxes and fees to be shown for prices quoted for airfares. The rule had come into effect in January of that year. Layoffs and reductions On April 28, 2020, TripAdvisor notified employees the company be eliminating 600 jobs in Canada and the United States and 300 more in other countries as part of a 25 percent reduction in their workforce around the world. The company also said they would be closing offices in Boston and San Francisco (though the Needham, Massachusetts headquarters is in the Boston metropolitan area). The reduction was due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Awards In 2019, TripAdvisor was named America's Best Midsize Employer by Forbes.

An afghan is a woollen blanket or shawl, usually knitted or crocheted. It is sometimes also called a \\"throw\\" of indeterminate size. Afghans are often used as bedspreads, or as a decoration on the back of couches or chairs. Etymology The word afghan refers to the people of Afghanistan. The use of afghan in the English language goes back to 1831, when Thomas Carlyle mentioned it in his Sartor Resartus.\\"Sartor Resartus\\", Fraser's Mag. VIII 670/1 Afghaun shawls, Thomas Carlyle, 1833 The first mention of the word referring to the woven rug was in 1877.\\"Life and Letters of Elizabeth Prentiss\\", pp. 260, Letter: 13 Dec., 1868. Elizabeth Prentiss, George Lewis Prentiss, 1882. Types and styles There are many styles of afghans: * Single-piece afghans are the simplest style to make and are especially popular with beginners. * Mile-a-minute afghans are usually made in a number of separate strips, with a minimum of stitches per strip, and then the strips are joined together. * Join-as-you-go afghans are made up of many different pieces, one of which begins where the last leaves off. * Motif afghans are composed of many small motifs, squares, or blocks, such as a granny square. These motifs may be all of the same design or of different designs. However, to make it easier to join the motifs into an afghan, the blocks are typically the same size. Some favor the motif style because of its portability and versatility of design. The motif style is still a very popular and a complex design for making blankets, scarves, etc. Although not a requirement, an edge or border is most often added to nicely finish off the blanket. * A graphghan is an afghan made by following a flat chart. This method uses a grid of colored squares to create a visual design. There are three main methods to making a graphghan: pixel crochet, corner-to-corner crochet, and tapestry crochet.Senior, Kathryn. \\"What Is a Graphghan & How Do You Crochet One?\\" The Craftsy Blog.

His palace was allowed to fall into ruin after the Christian takeover, leaving only a lovely arcade and tower. Terraced gardens were reconstructed in the 20th century. The following is a section of one of Yusuf's poems from Hispano-Arabic Poetry: A Student Anthology, published by James Monroe. It is typical of the romantic, yearning poetry of al-Andalus, which inspired the later romantic poetry of European chivalry.

The plant was in operation from 1896 to 1996. Originally opened by the Stanley Steam Car Company, the plant was acquired by Maxwell-Briscoe in 1903 from the Ingersoll-Rand Drill Company. In 1913 Maxwell-Briscoe was renamed Maxwell Automobile Company. Separate portions of the complex were acquired by Chevrolet in 1914 and 1915. At this time Chevrolet was an independent company and not yet part of General Motors. In 1918 Chevrolet was integrated into General Motors. A range of General Motors products were assembled in Tarrytown over the years; most were Chevrolet products, starting with the Chevrolet Series 490. Its last vehicles produced were GM's second generation minivans. These were the Chevrolet Lumina APV, Pontiac TranSport, and Oldsmobile Silhouette, but sluggish sales spelled the end for GM's Tarrytown operations with its 2100 employees. It was closed at the end of June 1996 when production of minivans was moved to Doraville Assembly in Georgia.Lueck, p. B6 Metro- North Railroad's Hudson Line runs through the property, and some of the siding tracks that used to serve the factory have been taken over by Metro-North as overflow storage tracks for Maintenance of Way equipment. The plant was a noted polluter of the Hudson River. The plant used about 1 million gallons of water per day, which was returned to the river as waste. The plant's industrial waste (primarily lead chromate and other painting, cleaning, and soldering chemicals) would be emptied directly into the river. Domestic waste would be processed through the village's sewage treatment plant. Around 1971, the village's Sewer and Water Superintendent assured that the pollution reports were exaggerated, and that he and other residents would swim by a beach nearby, however Dominick Pirone, an ecologist and former director of the Hudson River Fishermen's Association (now Riverkeeper) was quoted as saying: \\"You can tell what color cars they are painting on a given day by what color the river is.\\" The site today is now being developed, with the parcel west of the railroad becoming a mainly-residential Toll Brothers development named \\"Edge-on-Hudson\\" and the east parcel retained by the Village of Sleepy Hollow for a new Department of Public Works garage and other facilities for the public.

The Prussians were led by Leopold I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, while the Austrians and Saxons were led by Field Marshal Rutowsky. The Prussians were victorious over the Royal Saxon Army and the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Emperor. Preliminary maneuvers Saxon Soldiers Two Prussian columns, one led by Frederick, the second by the Leopold the 'Old Dessauer' were converging on Dresden, the capital of Saxony, which was then an Austrian ally. Interposed between Leopold and Dresden was Rutowsky with an army of Saxons. Rapidly marching towards Dresden and Rutowsky was prince Charles who hoped to be able to reinforce both. Leopold moved slowly and deliberately forward entering Saxon territory on 29 November and advanced on Rutowsky at Leipzig, whereupon Rutowsky retired towards Dresden. By 12 December, Leopold reached Meissen and joined with a corps under Lehwaldt. Rutowsky was reinforced by some Austrians under Gr√ºnne and took up a position at Kesselsdorf, 5 miles west of Dresden, that covered Dresden while leaving him closer to the advancing Charles than Leopold was to Frederick. The Saxons deployed along a ridge that ran from Kesselsdorf to the river Elbe and that was fronted by a stream and marshy ground. The 7,000 Austrians under Gr√ºnne formed on the right near the Elbe. The line was long and there was a considerable gap in its center between the Saxons and the Austrians. On the fifteenth, Leopold finally came up. There was much snow and ice on the field. Battle Battle of Kesselsdorf The Prussians were slightly outnumbered 35,000 to 32,000. Additionally, the Saxons and Austrians had the advantage of the ground. Dessauer, a long experienced general now sixty eight years old, perceived that by taking the town of Kesselsdorf the enemies flank could be turned and concentrated his efforts against the Saxon portion of the army. The Saxons had the town defended with twenty-four heavy cannons, their engineers and carpenters enhancing its defensibility. Leopold made dispositions for an attack by an elite force of infantry and grenadiers, however the ground was very difficult and the first attack was repulsed with considerable loss, including the officer leading the attack, General Hertzberg. A second, reinforced attack was made and this too failed with the Prussians fleeing in disorder. The Prussians had suffered some 1,500 casualties from the attacking forces of 3,500. The Saxon grenadiers seeing the flight of the Prussians left their strong defensive position and made an impetuous pursuit of the Prussians which exposed them to a massed charge by the dragoons of the Prussian cavalry. The shock of the charge sent the Saxons tumbling back and through their former position in Kesselsdorf, driving them from the field. At this same time, Leopold's son, Prince Moritz, personally led an infantry regiment which broke through the Saxon center. The regiment, although isolated, held its ground while other Prussian regiments attempted but failed to link up with it due to the stubbornness of the Saxon defence. Eventually, Leopold's success in taking Kesselsdorf bore fruit and the Saxon flank was turned causing the Saxon line to collapse and their army to flee at nightfall. The Prussians' losses amounted to over sixteen hundred killed and more than three thousand wounded, while the Saxon losses were less than four thousand killed and wounded with almost seven thousand Saxons taken prisoner as well as forty eight cannon and seven standards.Tuttle 1888, pp. 43-44. During the battle, the Austrians on the right never fired a shot, while Charles, who had reached Dresden and could hear the cannon, failed to march to the aid of his ally. Aftermath The Saxons fled in a wild panic into Dresden. There, despite the presence of Charles and his army of 18,000 and the Austrians' willingness to renew battle, they continued to flee. Leopold then linked up his forces with those of Frederick, who was so delighted by the victory that he embraced Leopold personally. The Saxons then abandoned Dresden, which Fredrick and Leopold occupied on the eighteenth after demanding its unconditional surrender. The Austrians subsequently began to negotiate the peace of Dresden immediately, ultimately ending the Second Silesian War and leaving Prussia's ally, France, to conduct the rest of the war of the Austrian Succession alone.

He was born into a winemaking family in the town of Desne on Croatia's coastal region of Dalmatia. He is notable for being the winemaker behind the 1973 Chateau Montelena Chardonnay that bested several white Burgundy wines in the wine tasting event that became known as the Judgement of Paris. In recognition of his contributions to the wine industry, Grgich was inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's Vintner's Hall of Fame on March 7, 2008. \\"Vintners Hall of Fame Inductees,\\" Culinary Institute of America The tribute came at the same time that Grgich was celebrating his 50th vintage of winemaking in the Napa Valley. History He attended the University of Zagreb Faculty of Agriculture, where he studied viticulture and enology. However, he learned about California and wanted to leave the then- Yugoslavia to become a winemaker there. In 1954, he left communist Yugoslavia for West Germany, obtaining a fellowship to study there. From there he emigrated to Canada and upon finally receiving a job offer from a winery in California, Grgich was able to go there. After working at a number of wineries in the Napa Valley ‚Äî including Souverain Winery, Christian Brothers Cellars, Beaulieu Vineyard (working alongside Andr√© Tchelistcheff), and Robert Mondavi ‚Äî Grgich became the winemaker and limited partner at Chateau Montelena. His 1973 vintage Chardonnay was selected to compete in the historic Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, where it was ranked the number one white wine. A dramatized version of the story is told in the 2008 film Bottle Shock which did not depict Grgich because \\"he did not want to be part of it.\\" This success permitted Grgich (with business partner Austin Hills of Hills Brothers Coffee) to establish his own winery, Grgich Hills Cellar in Rutherford, California. The winery, which changed names to Grgich Hills Estate in 2006, owns of vineyards and produces 70,000 cases of wine each year. Its very first vintage won the Great Chardonnay Showdown, with 221 competitors from countries around the world.

The company is best known for their business intelligence software systems, starting with DataPivot on the Apple Macintosh. Brio Software was acquired by Hyperion in 2003. Hyperion was in turn acquired by Oracle four years later, absorbing Brio into the Oracle Hyperion Performance Management applications. History Brio Technology was founded in San Francisco in 1984 as a consulting company. It made money early by doing contract work for Metaphor Corporation and performing contract programming. =Business intelligence software= By 1990, Brio had developed its first product, Data Prism, a database query and analysis tool. The next year, Brio released Data Pivot, an innovative program designed to allow regular or sequenced data to be totaled automatically. This was one of the first OLAP software applications. The DataPivot code was later sold in the early 1990s to Borland and integrated into Quattro Pro. The essential idea of DataPivot (pivot tables) was also added to Microsoft Excel a bit later. Also Lotus Improv was built around a similar (though independently created) idea. Brio gained a patent for the idea behind DataPivot (\\"Cross Tab Analysis and Reporting Method\\") in 1999. In 1993, Brio released Data Edit, a tool which allowed more direct manipulation of data in relational databases such as Oracle, Sybase, and DB2. In 1995, Brio gained some much needed funding from the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. Kleiner Perkins insisted on some management changes (co-founder Yorgen Edholm was made the sole CEO of the company) and the ground was laid for taking the company public. Brio went public (former stock symbol of BRIO - Nasdaq) on May 5, 1998. Flush with money, Brio started looking for businesses to acquire. In order to complement its technology, Brio looked at and later acquired SQRiBE Technologies.Interview with Yorgen H. Edholm about merger with SQRIBE SQRiBE was a small company in Palo Alto, CA with reporting (SQR) and a new portal product (ReportMart). =Executive changeover= However, the merger with the company SQRiBE (also based in the Bay area) in 1999 did not work out well. Although the combined company did reach a record high of revenues in the year 2000 of $150 million (annualized), financial problems were looming. After reporting a net loss for first quarter of 2001, Yorgen Edholm resigned as CEO. Katherine Glassey was forced out of the company a few months later. Brio hired Craig D. Brennan, a former SVP of Global CRM at Oracle, as its new CEO January 1, 2001. After his first 90 days at Brio, he realized that the company was in worse shape than described by the board. Not only was the Tech Bubble bursting, the economy in a recession, but the merger between Brio and SQRiBE was in name only. There was no vision, strategy, or plan to integrate the two companies. There were either no formal business processes or there were multiple overlapping teams, processes, and so on. Brennan brought in a new executive team in his first six months and together they came up with a new vision for the company focused on Brio 8, their first integrated Business Intelligence Suite, with a complete redesign from mainframe and client-server to a web-based \\"zero footprint\\" architecture. The company survived the terrible business environment of 2001. The company was required to do two major layoffs in 2001 to reduce its operational losses and to conserve cash. By the end of 2001, the company had achieved cash flow break-even. Beginning in 2002, the company focused on installing business processes across all functions, dedicated most of its development resources to Brio 8, and managed new maintenance requirements for its most important customers. By the end of the year, the company launched Brio 8 to enthusiastic customers, partners, and press. The company was growing revenue again and had achieved a small profit. =Acquisition by Hyperion= In 2003, the executive team, working with the board, determined that the Business Intelligence market was going to consolidate and it made sense for the company to consider being acquired. The company focused on both growing its revenue and profitability while also seeking an acquirer. The best fit was Hyperion and over the course of several quarters, Brio Software was acquired and integrated into Hyperion's operations. A quarter after Hyperion acquired Brio Software, their new integrated capabilities gave them new sales opportunities, and Hyperion achieved YR/YR 30% product growth for several quarters. The Hyperion stock price went from $15 per share to over $50 per share over the next few quarters. In March 2007, Oracle announced that it was acquiring Hyperion, this deal was finalized four months later, in July 2007.

It was the second location that built Cadillacs, when Cadillac originally started out as the Henry Ford Company which was located at the intersection of Cass Avenue and Amsterdam Street. In 1902, the Cadillac Motor Company began operations, and began building cars at the all new Clark Street facility in 1921, where the factory manufactured Cadillac models until December 23, 1987, when production of Cadillac's full- size D-bodies moved to Arlington Assembly in Arlington, Texas, while production of downsized FWD DeVille/Fleetwood/Seville models were relocated to Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly and Orion Assembly by 1985. It is approximately 2 miles southeast of the original Lincoln factory located at 6200 West Warren Avenue. All Cadillac vehicles were built only at this facility, with production of popular selling models later added to Linden, New Jersey, South Gate, California or Arlington, Texas in \\"knock down kits\\" starting in the 1930s to meet demand.

The state is responsible for the creation of an educational system that enables every citizen access to education.United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. International Bureau of Education. \\"World Data on Education, Senegal\\". UNESCO-IBE, 2010. Web. Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution adopted in January 2001 guarantee access to education for all children.\\"Senegal\\". 2005 Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor . Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor (2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.Constitution du S√©n√©gal, Titre II : Des libert√©s publiques et de la personne humaine, des droits √©conomiques et sociaux et des droits collectifs (in French) However, due to limited resources and low demand for secular education in areas where Islamic education is more prevalent, the law is not fully enforced.  Primary and secondary education  Determined on February 16, 1991, official law n¬∞ 91-22 states three main objectives concerning Senegalese education. * Firstly the educational system should create conditions that enable development within the entire nation, by creating capable men and women who can work efficiently to improve their nation, and who have a specific interest in Senegal's economic, social and cultural development. * Secondly the educational system should promote Senegal's values: liberty, democracy, personal and civic morality, human rights, and the upholding of Senegalese society's laws and regulations. * Lastly the educational system should enhance the nation's culture by creating men and women who actively participate in national activities, who possess the ability to effectively reflect on problems, and who can contribute to the advancement of science. Education is compulsory and free up to the age of 16. In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 80%, and the net primary enrollment rate was 67.6%. Gross and net enrollment rates are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect attendance. In 2000, 41.2% of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. Primary school attendance statistics are not available for Senegal. As of 2001, 80% of children who started primary school were likely to reach grade 5. The Ministry of Labor has indicated that the public school system is unable to cope with the number of children that must enroll each year. As a result, many school-age children seek education and training through more informal means. A large number apprentice themselves to a shop, where they receive no wages. One government official estimated there are 100,000 children apprenticed in Dakar. The Agence Nationale de la Statistique et de la D√©mographie (ANSD) reports that, as of 2001, 32.7% of children age 10‚Äì14 had begun their professional lives. In 2000 Senegalese governments and authorities set out to make revision to the educational system. Senegal's Ten-Year Education and Training Program (PDEF) facilitated this reform in the United Nations special initiatives for Africa. In 2000 Senegal published an announcement stating the country's education goals for the 2000-2010 decade. The reform was composed of several goals. Firstly, increasing access to education throughout the country.Republique du Senegal. Ministere de L'Education. \\"Le developpement de l‚Äôeducation: Rapport National du S√©n√©gal\\". Jomtien, Dakar: La Direction de la Planification et de la R√©forme de l‚ÄôEducation, 2004. Web. Secondly, the creation of an educational system that was pertinent to all classes of Senegalese people. Thirdly the creation/revision of an effective relationship between politics and education. Lastly the reorganization of resource acquisition and use. The government's 2010 goal was the actualization of a nationally cohesive education system. =Preschool= In Senegal preschool is provided for children ages 3‚Äì5, for up to three years of study. Children who attend preschool have the opportunity to enroll in induction courses at the age of six instead of having to wait until they are seven. Preschool is not obligatory. According to article 10, law n¬∞ 91-22 decreed February 16, 1991 Senegal's preschool system has two goals: To consolidate children's identities by anchoring them in the national languages and cultural values. Also to develop their motor skills, intellects, and social skills to develop their personalities and create a strong foundation for their future learning. Since 2007 there has been a focus on DIPE (d√©veloppement int√©gr√© de la petite enfance). DIPE is a national priority for Senegal is based on the needs of the nations‚Äô children. In 2007, 57% of preschools and 36.9% of daycares were in Dakar. =Primary school= Primary school is designed for children ages 7 to 12. The Senegalese primary education system divides six years of study into three cycles of two years that culminate in the successful completion of the CFEE (Certificate of Elementary Completion) and an entrance test into the next cycle of education. For children enrolled in the education system, attendance is mandatory until the completion of second year elementary course. Article 11, law n¬∞ 91-22 dating February 16, 1991 states the Senegalese primary education goals. The curriculum places an emphasis on French grammar and reading, math and science, and geography, with less time being dedicated to arts education. =Middle school= Middle school education is aimed at students ages 13 and is composed of four years of study. To successfully pass middle school students must succeed on their BFEM (brevet de fin d‚Äô√©tudes moyennes). Article 12, law n¬∞ 91-22 instated on February 16, 1991 states the objectives of middle school in Senegal. In 2007 624 public middle schools and 376 private middle schools were registered. Of these schools 58.4% were centralized in urban areas, with 51.4% residing in Dakar, Thi√®s, and Ziguinchor. =High school= Senegalese secondary education can be ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù or technical (adhering to the standards of the French system of the lyc√©e). These secondary study programs last three years and are officially approved by the French baccalaureate. The technical secondary education program culminates in the passing of the BEP (brevet d‚Äô√©tudes professionnelles) and the BT (brevet de technicien). Senegal's objectives for secondary education are listed in article 12, law n¬∞ 91-22. While middle school education is for the most part uniform, secondary education offers four streams: general, long technical, short technical, and professional. =Multigrade teaching= Because of low population density, multigrade teaching is of particular significance in sub-Saharan Africa.Mulkeen, Aidan, and Higgins Cathal. Multigrade Teaching in Sub-Saharan Africa, Lessons from Uganda, Senegal, and The Gambia. Washington: The World Bank, 2009. Print. 1, 16-18 Although it is already an integral part of the education system in Senegal, the use of multigrade teaching is expected to increase along with efforts and strategies aimed to provide education for all Senegalese children. Multigrade teaching is perceived by some to be a ‚Äúsecond- rate‚Äù system. In Senegal 18% of schools have multigrade classes and 10% of children attending primary schools are in multigrade classes. There are two models of multigrade teaching in Senegal. The first, the more common model, consists of one teacher teaching two consecutives grades at once. The other model is referred to as Ecole √† Classe Unique and consists of one teacher working with up to six grades simultaneously. Multigrade schools usually reflect poor outcomes in the CFEE (Certificate of Elementary Completion) examination at the end of the year, with a 44% pass rate in Kaolack, 34% pass rate in Mbour, and a 46% pass rate in Mbacke. =Koranic schools= Senegalese state schools do not offer religious education, so children are sent to Koranic school instead. There is little data on Koranic education in Senegal. There is no defined structure for Koranic schools in Senegal.Andr√©, P., and J.-L. Demonsant. 2009. \\"Koranic schools in Senegal: A real barrier to formal education?\\" Paris: Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD). In 1999 World Bank identified three levels: *The primary Koranic level: Children are given basic knowledge of the Koran. *The secondary Koranic level: Children have large portions of the Koran memorize and are taught Islamic science. *Higher Koranic studies: Very few reach this level, taught by prominent Islamic masters, usually in prestigious Islamic universities. The aim of the Koranic school is to teach children to be good Muslims. In certain forms of Senegalese Koranic schooling children are fostered out to Koranic masters. Because of this they often are forced to become beggars to feed themselves. UCW: Understanding Children's Work estimates that 90% of child beggars in Senegal are students of this type of Koranic education. However, this sort of Koranic education is a minority. Usually Koranic schools in Senegal are in the form of Franco-Arab schools and are professional schools that balance French education and religious teaching.  Higher education  Senegal has diverse options of institutes for higher education with private and public universities. University-level instruction is only in French. In 2012 the Ministry of Higher Education in Senegal in cooperation with UNESCO‚ÄôS Regional Office in Dakar launched a project to improve the quality of higher education in Senegal. This project will establish training opportunities, prepare guides for foreign students, research on existing systems of quality assurance, and assess employment needs.\\"Improving the quality of higher education in Senegal.\\" UNESCO Office of Dakar. N.p., 19 Mar 2012. Web. 28 Oct 2013. Participants will discuss and learn from experts working in other African countries and throughout the world. =Challenges facing higher education in Senegal= According to Hassana Alidou, the chief of the Basic to Higher Education Section for UNESCO Dakar states that despite some improvements since 2000, the higher education system in Senegal struggles to cope with several challenges, such as the abundant student body attending the University of Dakar (UCAD). The rapid generation of private institutes of higher education has also been cause for concern. In addition, low performance and inadequate training resulting from a flawed system. Senegalese higher education institutions must address the unequal access between men and women. Lastly within the Senegalese system of higher education there is a matter of fraud in obtaining degrees. =Gaston Berger University= L'Universit√© de Saint-Louis was created January 1990 and was later renamed Universit√© Gaston Berger in 1997. Its mission statement can be found in article one of the 96-597 decree of July 10, 1996 and states that the university's main goals are to create a class of highly skilled individuals who contribute to scientific research at the national and international level, as well as to promote and develop African cultural values.\\"Aper√ßu g√©n√©ral de l‚ÄôUniversit√©.\\" Universit√© Gaston Berger. N.p. Web. 28 Oct 2013. The university is ten kilometers from the city of Saint-Louis and extends over 240 hectares. The university employs 185 professors/researchers, 348 administrative and technical workers, and 5347 students enrolled in 2010-2011. =Universit√© du Sahel= The University of Sahel is a private institute for higher education in Dakar. In 2007 the university was validated by CAMES (Conseil africain et malgache pour l‚Äôenseignement sup√©rieur) after their diplomas were determined to fulfill all the necessary requirements.\\"D√©couvrir l‚ÄôUniversit√©.\\" Universit√© du Sahel. N.p. Web. 28 Oct 2013. The university is composed of faculties, institutes, laboratories, and an administrative and education staff dedicated to teaching, research, and student life. =Universit√© Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar= The Universit√© Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar was created February 24, 1957 and was officially inaugurated December 9, 1959.\\"50 ans d'histoire.\\" Universit√© Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar. N.p. Web. 28 Oct 2013. It was renamed from the University of Dakar to Universit√© Cheikh Anta Diop de Dakar in 1987. Its focus is science and technical studies. The university's motto is ‚Äúlux mea lex‚Äù. =√âcole Sup√©rieure Multinationale des T√©l√©communications= Ecole Sup√©rieure Multinationale des T√©l√©communications (ESMT) is in Dakar and was founded in 1981. It is part of the United Nations initiative for development.\\"PR√âSENTATION.\\" √âcole Sup√©rieure Multinationale des T√©l√©communications. N.p. Web. 28 Oct 2013. =Centre Africain d‚ÄôEtudes Sup√©rieures en Gestion (CESAG)= The CESAG was founded in 1985 by the CEAO (Conf√©rence des Chefs d'Etat de la Communaut√© Economique de l'Afrique de l'Ouest) and was taken over by the BCEAO (Banque Centrale des Etats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest) in 1995.Centre Africain d‚ÄôEtudes Sup√©rieures en Gestion. N.p. Web. 28 Oct 2013. Today the school offers management programs for business in the public and private sector. = Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) = Four main functions of National Office for Vocational Training (ONFP) Technical and vocational training (TVET) addresses multiple demands of an economic, social and environmental nature by helping young people and adults to develop the skills they need for employment, decent work and entrepreneurship, promoting equitable, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and supporting transitions to green economies and environmental sustainability. The Ministry of Vocational Education, Apprenticeship and Crafts (MFPAA) runs the major public TVET schemes in Senegal in conjunction with the Ministry of National Education (MEN). Over the last decades the system has gone through changes which have improved it. Several bodies provide training in the Senegal system (state, private, national and international bodies such as non-governmental organizations, NGOs). There are also different sources of funds. The following bodies play a major role: * Fund for Financing Technical and Vocational Training (Fonds de Financement de la Formation Professionnelle et Technique, FFFPT ), which manages the funds collected by the training levy; * National Office for Vocational Training (Office National de Formation Professionnelle, ONFP), which is a training provider as well as other functions. Other institutional bodies involved in the system: * The African Network of Vocational Training Funds and Institutions (RAFPRO) is a network of national funding institutions; * Operational Repertoire for Occupation and Employment (R√©pertoire Op√©rationnel des M√©tiers et Emplois, ROAME) is a tool to enhance the quality of the TVET system. Challenges facing Senegalese Education In 1992 approximately 54 000 Senegalese youths were suspected to be apprentices in the workforce rather than in school. Although the legal age for these apprenticeships is supposed to be 15 it is believed that there are much younger children involved in the workforce. Children who live in rural parts of the country are at a disadvantage and usually work in agriculture instead of attending school. There is a focus on increasing enrolment among Senegalese girls, although in the past few years enrolment rates have elevated.  The 'Case des Tout-Petits' experience  The health and social status of children in Senegal is unfavourable and despite serious efforts the protection of children remains of great concern. In reaction to this situation, Senegalese national authorities now consider early childhood care a priority for development. Since 2002, the ‚ÄòCase des Tout-Petits‚Äô, a new model for the development of children in their early years, has coexisted alongside the various structures of formal, non-formal and informal pre-school education. While there is room for improvement, the programme is a valuable community- based experience grounded in local cultural traditions. The ‚ÄòCase des Tout- Petits‚Äô is a community structure for the support of children aged from 0 to 6. The case, or traditional house, connotes a lifestyle, a way of being and thinking, and symbolizes a commitment to African values. The case as a living, socialized, educational place par excellence is considered the starting point for the child's learning in life. These ‚Äòcases‚Äô were primarily designed for disadvantaged and rural milieus to guarantee access to adequate and integrated services. They are run by the people themselves and represent some 20% of Senegal's early childhood structures. Architecturally, the ‚ÄòCase des Tout- Petits‚Äô is a hexagonal structure comprising two rooms, one for the children's educational activities and the other for parental education. These structures develop a comprehensive and holistic approach to childhood care that includes education, health and nutrition programmes. While participation is not free, fees are lower than in other early childhood care structures within the formal sector. The financial participation is symbolic and allows families to work in synergy around a common good that belongs to the community and that the community is expected to preserve.

One of the Cross Lakes is the Cross Lake Indian Reserve (Pimicikamak Cree) of the Cross Lake First Nation where the main urban area is called Cross Lake. The other Cross Lake is on nearby provincial Crown land. The communities are located about 520 kilometres by air north of Winnipeg, and 120 kilometres by air south of Thompson. They are situated on the shores of the Nelson River where the river enters Cross Lake. An all-weather road, PR 374, connects the communities to PR 373 via the Kichi Sipi Bridge. In March 2016, Cross Lake appeared in the national news after First Nation officials declared a state of emergency because of an epidemic of suicides. The Canadian Press reported that there had been \\"six suicides in the last two months and 140 attempts in the last two weeks alone\\", and band councillor Donnie McKay said the community \\"is traumatized and needs immediate help from the provincial and federal governments\\".  Demographics  In the 2011 Census, the Cross Lake designated place had a population of 7,600 living in of its total private dwellings. The adjoining reserves of Cross Lake 19 (population 1,751 in 2011), Cross Lake 19A (population 1,889 in 2011) and Cross Lake 19E (population 682 in 2011) of the Cross Lake First Nation had a combined population of 7,622 in 2011. Together these communities formed a population centre of 9,033 in 2017. Notable people *Brady Keeper, professional hockey player  Geography  The communities are situated on the eastern shores of Cross Island and Cross Lake. The lake is on the Nelson River north of Lake Winnipeg. It is long and narrow and extends 102 km (63 mi) east-northeast. The Nelson enters and leaves on the west side. The Minago River enters on the west. From the Minago a portage trail leads to Moose Lake and the Saskatchewan River. On the east side via the Walker River, Walker Lake and Kapaspwaypanik Lake the Kapaspwaypanik Portage leads to the Carrot River and Oxford Lake on the Hayes River. = Climate = Cross Lake has a subarctic climate (Koppen: Dfc), typical of Northern Manitoba. Temperatures in the summer are warm, whilst in the winter they are bitterly cold.

The hills in the background are in Belmont County, Ohio. Wheeling Island is the most populated island in the Ohio River. It lies within the city of Wheeling in Ohio County, West Virginia, in the United States. The 2000 census showed a resident population of 3,142 people on the island, which has a land area of 1.514 km2 (374 acres). Neville Island, PA is larger (3.4 km2) but has fewer people (1,232). Wheeling Island lies at the mouths of Wheeling Creek of Ohio and Wheeling Creek of West Virginia. The island is home to the Wheeling Island Racetrack and Gaming Center at Wheeling Downs and Wheeling Island Stadium, home of the West Virginia State Football Championships. Wheeling Island has a number of historic homes featuring Victorian Architecture. An elementary school (Madison Elementary), churches, a public pool (Bridge Park Pool), and several restaurants are located on the island.  Transportation Wheeling Island is connected to downtown Wheeling via the Fort Henry Bridge, carrying Interstate 70, U.S. Route 40, and U.S. Route 250, and the Wheeling Suspension Bridge carrying the National Road. Two additional bridges cross the back channel of the Ohio River to connect the island to Bridgeport, one for Interstate 70, and a second for US 250 and US 40. The Aetnaville Bridge also crosses the back channel of the Ohio River, but was closed to vehicle traffic in 1988 and to the public in 2016 due to safety concerns.

History A woman at World Naked Bike Ride, London, 2017. Zaragoza and Vancouver hosted the first NBR. Pictured are participants in the 2009 WNBR in the Spanish city. Woman and a man riding at the Cardiff WNBR 2018 In 2003, Conrad Schmidt conceived the World Naked Bike Ride after organising the Naked Bike Rides of the group Artists for Peace/Artists Against War (AFP/AAW).Artists for Peace/Artists Against War's archived web page is currently hosted by The Work Less Party of British Columbia Initially, the message of the WNBR was protesting against oil dependency and celebrating the power and individuality of the human body. In 2006, there was a shift towards simplifying the message and focusing on cycling advocacy. The 2004 WNBR saw events in 28 cities, in ten countries on four continents. By 2010, WNBR had expanded to stage rides in 74 cities, in 17 countries, from the United States to the United Kingdom and Hungary to Paraguay. Two male riders were arrested during the 2005 WNBR in North Conway, New Hampshire, and charged with \\"indecent exposure and lewdness\\". The two riders agreed to having the charges reduced to \\"disorderly conduct\\" and paid a $300 fine, the majority of which was paid for by the WNBR Legal Defense Fund.More information about the case can be found at WNBR North Conway website Six male riders were charged with public indecency during the 2005 WNBR Chicago ride and later prosecuted with sentences ranging from fines and non-expungeable conviction to three months of court supervision. In 2007, during the first World Naked Bike ride in Denver, Colorado police surrounded the bike riders and wrote several people tickets. During the WNBR held on June 12, 2010, two males were arrested by campus police at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. Two riders were arrested in New York City in 2014 for \\"lewdness and indecent exposure\\". Simon Oosterman, the organizer of the 2005 WNBR in Auckland, and the first to be arrested during a WNBR event, is credited with going further and refocusing the issue on oil-dependency.

Vaginectomy is a surgery to remove all or part of the vagina. It is usually used as a treatment for vaginal cancer. Some transgender men and nonbinary people who were assigned female at birth have chosen to have a vaginectomy as part of their transition, because they do not want to have a vagina. Trans people can choose to have surgical changes made to their clitoris to make it more penis-like (metoidioplasty), or have a full- size penis constructed (phalloplasty) in addition to the vaginectomy. They can also choose not to do so, in order to create a relatively smooth, featureless genital area (genital nullification). In a partial vaginectomy, they leave a small canal open, unsuitable for sexual penetration but able to drain menses if the uterus and ovaries are still intact. This makes it possible to keep the uterus. In the \\"radical\\" or \\"total\\" version, the uterus and cervix must be removed as well, because menstruating into a closed body cavity is very dangerous.Surgical Treatment of Vaginal Cancer: eMedicine Obstetrics and Gynecology This can be done at the same time, but may require a different surgeon, such as an OB-GYN to assist a urologist. At least for total vaginectomy, the doctor will also remove the vaginal mucosa walls, since they would continue to secrete into the closed body cavity. There is always a risk of missing a section which will continue to secrete and cause health risks, requiring follow-up surgery. It is extremely rare for a transgender man to get vaginal cancer after hormone therapy and hysterectomy. However, there are documented cases of that happening.CASE REPORTS: Vaginal Carcinoma in a Female-to-Male Transsexual by Schenck TL, Holzbach T, Zantl N, Schuhmacher C, Vogel M, Seidl S, Machens H-G, and Giunta RE (Journal of Sexual Medicine: Volume 7, Issue 8, pages 2899√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú2902, August 2010) Anyone who has a vagina needs preventive screening for vaginal cancer.

Early life Rick Tuttle was born in New Haven, Connecticut, one of four children of Frederick Burton Tuttle and his wife, Mary Emily. His father was a descendant of a longtime New England family that originally settled in New Haven in 1638. His mother's family came from Arkansas. Due to his father's service in the U.S. Marine Corps, the family moved to Arkansas, then back to Connecticut and afterwards to Rhode Island before finally settling in Plattsburgh, New York, where he graduated high school. In civilian life, Frederick, Tuttle's father, was a high school track coach before becoming a school principal in a predominantly African-American New Haven neighborhood. He was also a member of the NAACP, and his involvement in civic affairs made a strong impression on his son. Education Tuttle received a Ph.D. in 1975 and an M.A. in history in 1964 from UCLA, as well as a B.A. in history, with honors and distinction, from Wesleyan University in 1962. He worked his way through college by working on various jobs, including at construction sites and as a farm hand. While an undergraduate at Wesleyan, Tuttle was a member of the university's Civil Rights Committee. Raised as an Episcopalian and Methodist, he served as president of its Alpha Chi Rho chapter and led a campaign to end what was then the fraternity's official policy of restricting membership to Christians. Civil rights era activism While a graduate student at UCLA, Tuttle participated in the Freedom Rides in 1961 and was recruited to join the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1963. He went to Greenwood, Mississippi to work on voter registration drives and also briefly spied on white supremacist and Ku Klux Klan meetings. After being driven out of Mississippi by threats, he joined the Chatham County Crusade for Voters in Savannah, Georgia, where he was arrested, without a proper warrant, for disturbing the peace and jailed for six weeks. Tuttle called Medgar Evers from jail to solicit his assistance a few hours before Evers was killed. He was ultimately released by a local judge after a prominent Savannah physician offered his property as bond in exchange for Tuttle's agreement to leave the county. Public service Tuttle was elected to four four-year terms in non- partisan elections as Los Angeles City Controller, serving from 1985 to 2001. In 1985 he was the only candidate running and won 100% of the vote, in 1989 he won with 79.3%, in 1993 with 77.41%, and in 1997 with 70.97%. By the end of his first term he had earned a reputation for fiscal responsibility. In a 1989 editorial endorsing his first re-election bid, The Los Angeles Times stated: And when he retired from public service, a Times columnist wrote: Tuttle is a member of the Democratic Party. His first public position was co-chairman of California Young Citizens for Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. A year later, he founded, along with U.S. Congressmen Howard Berman and Henry Waxman and Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, the Los Angeles County Young Democrats and succeeded Berman and Waxman as statewide president of the California Federation of Young Democrats. He had briefly considered returning to elected office in 2009 by running for the open Los Angeles City Council District 5 seat to replace the retiring Jack Weiss, but threw his support to Ron Galperin instead. Tuttle also served as a director of the Los Angeles West Chamber of Commerce and an interviewee of the Fellows Program at Coro of Southern California. Academic career A former associate dean of student activities at UCLA, Tuttle served for eight years as an elected member of the Los Angeles Community College Board of Trustees. After completing the statutory maximum of four terms as city controller, he returned to UCLA as executive director of the Dashew International Center for Student and Scholars, serving in that capacity until 2006. Since then he has taught courses in public policy as a lecturer in the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, and was voted public policy professor of the year three times. In these positions, he has stressed the importance of creating a strong democratic tradition at UCLA, which, in his words, is \\"the best large public university in a major city.\\" Tuttle has also been a member of the board of directors of UCLA's University Religious Conference and a board member of the UCLA Alumni Association. Awards Tuttle is a recipient of the Equal Justice in Government Award of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Distinguished Public Service Award of the Pacific Southwest Region of the Anti-Defamation League, the Lifetime Membership Award of the Los Angeles Business Council, the UCLA Alumni Public Service Award, and the Distinguished Leadership Award for 1996 presented by the Association of Government Accountants. He received the Los Angeles Employee of the Year Award in 1997 from the All City Employees Benefits Service Association (ACEBSA). Personal life Tuttle met his first wife, Muff Singer (February 14, 1942 ‚Äì January 16, 2005), while both were working on Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign in California. They married in 1976. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the University of Texas at Austin and former Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines, she would later become campaign coordinator and the first administrative assistant of Howard Berman while he was a member of the California State Assembly, prior to his election to the U.S. Congress. She left government service to pursue a career as a successful writer of children's books. Born in Chicago, Illinois, she died of ovarian cancer at their Los Angeles home. Rick Tuttle and Muff Singer are the parents of one daughter, Sarah Emily. In 2008 Tuttle married Rebecca Rona, a professional writer and social, environmental and political activist. She founded the grassroots organization Together, which for a decade promoted human relations and understanding; worked to end fracking and oil extraction in the Inglewood Oil Field, and has been the driving force behind an effort to convince Culver City to form the Culver City Equity and Human Relations Committee. In 2018, she was honored by the Los Angeles County Democratic Party with the Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt Award as Democrat of the Year for her Assembly District.

He was a muscular chestnut stallion who sometimes raced in pacifiers. He had an aversion towards wet ground and was most effective on ground which was at least dead. European career Reasonably well-bred and bred for stamina, Jeune was by Kalaglow out of Youthful, by Green Dancer. He began his racing career in Europe, becoming a Group Two winner over a mile and a half, as well as running several good placings in English middle distance races of the second rank. His owner, Sheikh Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum, sent him to Australia at the end of his 4-year-old season, where he was trained by David Hayes. Australian career Jeune established himself as a top-class performer in Australia with his victory in the Underwood Stakes (1800 metres) at Caulfield in the early part of the spring. Later that same preparation, he was runner-up in the Caulfield Stakes and the Mackinnon Stakes. In between time, he ran unplaced in the Cox Plate when hindered in the running. Jeune therefore entered the 1994 Melbourne Cup with solid middle-distance weight-for-age form. Nevertheless, he started at odds of 16/1 due to doubts about whether he would run the distance. He won by 2 lengths, while favoured Caulfield Cup winner Paris Lane, who had narrowly beaten him home in the Mackinnon three days earlier, was second. Jeune opened his autumn campaign by winning the much shorter group 1 C.F. Orr Stakes (1400 metres) against sprinters. He also won the Queen Elizabeth Stakes (2000 metres) to finish that campaign. However, in between time, Jeune developed the tendency of running second in major races. One of these efforts a close second to champion sprinter Schillaci in the Futurity Stakes over 1400 metres. He also lost the Australian Cup at Flemington to the Western Australian mare Starstruck, and the Rawson Stakes and The BMW at Rosehill to front-runner Stony Bay. Jeune raced on as a 6-year-old, and despite an early-season victory over Mahogany in the Craiglee Stakes (1600 metres) at Flemington, he thereafter lost form, failing in several major races. In the end, Jeune's overall racing record in Australia and England stood at 10 wins and 17 placing from 42 starts, and nearly A$3million in prizemoney. Stud record Jeune began his stud career at Hayes' Lindsay Park property in South Australia before transferring to Collingrove Stud in Victoria in 2004. Chief among Jeune's successful offspring was the ill-fated 2003 Caulfield Cup winner Mummify and On A Jeune, who ran second in the Melbourne Cup. He also sired Jeune Mark (so named because he closely resembled his sire), who won over $200,000 in prizes. Jeune Mark was made famous after saving his owner's life in the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria.http://www.smh.com.au/national/spirited-horse-helps-farmer-survive- worst-20090208-811c.html Despite his very good race record and ability to sire good progeny, Jeune was not the most commercial of stallions in Australia. The quality of mares he attracted in South Australia was only moderate and did not match those enjoyed by the more fashionable overseas shuttle stallions and speed-oriented locals, with whom he was competing. Nevertheless, over 5% of his runners won stakes races. On the morning of 4 January 2006, Jeune was found dead in his paddock at Collingrove Stud from an apparent heart failure.

She is most known for her portraits, images of southern architecture, and various photographic series featuring African Americans and Native Americans at the turn of the 20th century.  Life  The only surviving child of wealthy and well-connected parents established in Washington, DC, Frances Benjamin Johnston was born in Grafton, West Virginia. Her mother Frances Antoinette Benjamin was from Rochester, New York. She married Anderson Doniphan Johnston, of Maysville, Kentucky. The couple moved to the capital shortly after the Civil War. Frances Antoinette Benjamin Johnston had started in journalism as a special correspondent on Congress and was recognized as one of the first women to write on national affairs. She also served as a drama critic under the byline \\"Ione\\" for the Baltimore Sun.\\"Mrs. F.A.B. Johnston Dead\\", New York Herald, June 11, 1920; accessed September 1, 2018 The younger Frances Benjamin Johnston was raised in Washington, D.C., and educated privately. She graduated in 1883 from Notre Dame of Maryland Collegiate Institute for Young Ladies (it developed later into a college and as Notre Dame of Maryland University). Afterward she studied art at the Acad√©mie Julian in Paris and the Washington Art Students League. An independent and strong-willed young woman, Johnston wrote articles for periodicals before finding her creative outlet through photography. She was given her first camera by entrepreneur George Eastman, a close friend of the family, and inventor of the new, lighter, Eastman Kodak cameras and film process. She received training in photography and dark-room techniques from Thomas Smillie, director of photography at the Smithsonian. Self-portrait by Johnston, dressed as a man, sporting a fake mustache and holding a bicycle, ca. 1890. She took portraits of friends, family, and local figures before working as a freelance photographer and touring Europe in the 1890s. There she used her connection to Smillie to visit prominent photographers and gather items for the museum's collections. She gained further practical experience in her craft by working for the newly formed Eastman Kodak company in Washington, D.C., forwarding film for development and advising customers when cameras needed repairs. In 1894 she opened her own photographic studio in Washington, D.C., on V Street between 13th and 14th streets, and at the time was the only woman photographer in the city. She took portraits of many famous contemporaries, including suffragette Susan B. Anthony, writer Mark Twain and Booker T. Washington, principal of the Tuskegee Institute. Well connected among elite society, she was commissioned by magazines to do \\"celebrity\\" portraits, such as Alice Roosevelt's wedding portrait. She was dubbed the \\"Photographer to the American court.\\" She photographed Admiral Dewey on the deck of the USS Olympia, the children of President Theodore \\"Teddy\\" Roosevelt playing with their pet pony at the White House, and the gardens of Edith Wharton's famous villa near Paris. Self Portrait (as New Woman), an 1896 self- portrait taken in her Washington, DC studio Having grown up in a family that traveled in elite circles of the capital, Johnston built on her connections and familiarity with the Washington political scene: she was appointed as official White House photographer for the Harrison, Cleveland, McKinley, \\"TR\\" Roosevelt, and Taft presidential administrations. Johnston also photographed Natalie Barney in Paris, who was a famous American heiress and literary salon socialite. Perhaps her most famous work, shown here, is her self-portrait as the liberated \\"New Woman\\", with petticoats showing and a beer stein in hand. Johnston advocated for the role of women in the burgeoning art of photography. The Ladies' Home Journal published Johnston's article in 1897 of \\"What a Woman Can Do With a Camera\\". With Zaida Ben-Yusuf, Johnston co-curated an exhibition of photographs by twenty-eight women photographers at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris. It afterward traveled to Saint Petersburg and Moscow in the Russian Empire, and to Washington, DC. She traveled widely in her thirties, taking a wide range of documentary and artistic photographs of coal miners, iron workers, women working in New England's textile mills, and sailors being tattooed on board ship, as well as her society commissions. While in England she photographed the stage actress Mary Anderson, who was a friend of her mother. In 1899, Johnston was commissioned by Hollis Burke Frissell to photograph the buildings and students of the Hampton Normal and Agricultural Institute in Hampton, Virginia in order to show its success. This commission added to her reputation.Laura Wexler, \\"Black and White and Color: American Photographs at the Turn of the Century,\\" in Prospects: An Annual of the American Cultural Studies' 13 (1988): 343. This series, documenting the ordinary life of the school, is considered among her most telling work. It was displayed at The Exhibit of American Negroes of the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900.Anne Maxell, \\"Montrer l'Autre: Franz Boas et les soeurs Gerhard\\", in Zoos humains.

Her photographs of the Hampton Institute were utilized in Robert Wilson's production of August Strindberg's A Dream Play.Schroeder, Jonathan (2019), \\"Robert Wilson's Photographic Elements of A Dream Play,\\" in Johnston in her studio, 1896 She photographed events such as world's fairs and peace-treaty signings. Johnston took the last portrait of President William McKinley, at the Pan-American Exposition of 1901 just before he was assassinated there. With her partner, Mattie Edwards Hewitt, a successful freelance home and garden photographer in her own right, Johnston opened a studio in New York in 1913. Her mother and aunt moved into her new apartment. Hewitt wrote Johnston love letters over the course of their relationship, which are chronicled in The Woman Behind the Lens: The Life and Work of Frances Benjamin Johnston, 1864‚Äì1952. Many of the early letters focused on Hewitt's admiration for Johnston's work, but as their romance progressed, they increasingly expressed her love: \\"...when I need you or you need me ‚Äî [we] must hold each other all the closer and with your hand in mine, holding it tight...\\" Johnston lectured at New York University on business for women. The pair of women produced a series of studies of New York architecture through the 1920s. In early 1920 her mother died in New York. Frances Benjamin Johnston Collection/LOC cph.3a47220. Frances Benjamin Johnston, with Maddie (her mother), before a painted backdrop of the Cliff House in San Francisco, California, 1903 In the 1920s, Johnston became increasingly interested in photographing architecture. As New York changed under pressure of development, she wanted to document buildings and gardens that were falling into disrepair or were about to be redeveloped and lost. As her focus in architecture grew, she became interested in documenting the architecture of the American South. Johnston was interested in preserving the everyday history of the American South through her art; she accomplished this by photographing barns, inns, and other ordinary structures. She was not interested in photographing the grand homes and plantations of the South, but rather the quickly deteriorating structures in these communities that portrayed the daily life of common southerners. Her photographs remain an important resource for modern architects, historians and conservationists. In 1928 she exhibited a series of 247 photographs of Fredericksburg, Virginia, ranging from the decaying mansions of the rich to the shacks of the poor. The exhibition was entitled Pictorial Survey‚ÄîOld Fredericksburg, Virginia‚ÄîOld Falmouth and Nearby Places and described as \\"A Series of Photographic Studies of the Architecture of the Region Dating by Tradition from Colonial Times to Circa 1830\\", and as \\"An Historical Record and to Preserve Something of the Atmosphere of An Old Virginia Town.\\" \\"Arcady, where all the leaves are merry\\": Frances Benjamin Johnston's house, 1132 Bourbon Street, New Orleans, Louisiana As a result of this exhibit, the University of Virginia hired her to document its buildings, and the state of North Carolina commissioned her to record its architectural history. Louisiana hired Johnston to document its huge inventory of rapidly deteriorating plantations. She was given a grant in 1933 by the Carnegie Corporation of New York to document Virginia's early architecture. This led to a series of grants and photographs in eight other southern states; copies of all of her photographs from these projects were given to the Library of Congress for public use. In December 1935, Johnston began a year long project to capture historic structures of the Colonial Era in Virginia. This was intended to be a one-year project, but it developed into an eight-year extensive project. She traveled 50,000 miles and surveyed 95 counties in Virginia. Johnston was named an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects for her work in preserving old and endangered buildings. Her collections have been purchased by institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although her relentless traveling was curtailed by petrol rationing in the Second World War, the tireless Johnston continued to photograph. She bought a house in the French Quarter of New Orleans in 1940, and retired there in 1945. She died in New Orleans in 1952 at the age of eighty-eight.

The band released two full-length albums, and one EP before disbanding in 1988. They were most notable for Cyriis' high-pitched vocals, catchy songs, melodic riffs, and fast tempos mixed in with interest in UFOs. Agent Steel reformed in 1998 (without Cyriis, although he would return to the band in 2010, only to leave again in 2011) and released three more full-length albums before going on hiatus in 2011. The band reformed again in 2018, this time with Cyriis returning as the vocalist and without the previous members, and they will release their first studio album in 14 years, No Other Godz Before Me, in 2021. Biography =Early years and split (1984‚Äì1988)= Agent Steel was formed by John Cyriis shortly after his firing from Megadeth in 1984, as guitarist and now lead vocalist Dave Mustaine was against the idea of playing the ‚ÄúAliens Card.‚Äù In all actuality, however, Agent Steel does not exclusively touch upon subjective matter relating to the possibility of life existing on other galaxies ‚Äî but instead the philosophical format of the band was presented in a form of a polemic. The first legal registration of the name Agent Steel was registered by Cyriis on July 23, 1984 as a DBA at the Los Angeles County Clerk's Office. Beforehand, however, Agent Steel was initially named Sanctuary. Agent Steel's first incarnation recorded a demo in the studio, titled ‚Äú144,000 Gone‚Äù in the summer of ‚Äô84. ‚Äú144,000 Gone‚Äù was written by Cyriis when he was a guitarist in his previous band Sceptre, an underground metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 with his best friends, Tony and Phil Sardo. The lineup ‚Äî whom Cyriis personally invited ‚Äî consisted of drummer Chuck Profus, guitarists Bill Simmons and Mark Marshal, and bassist George Robb, respectively. They accepted the offer gratefully, but in the end only two out of the four who were invited stayed in the lineup until the group disbanded ‚Äî this for reasons unknown. Another member named John Gott joined, but left shortly afterwards. New guitarists Juan Garcia and Kurt Colfelt joined the band. From December 1984 to February 1985, they recorded their debut album Skeptics Apocalypse, which was released in June 1985 by Combat Records. Until this day, \\"Skeptics Apocalypse\\" is a world-renowned Speed Metal classic; its most popular song, \\"Agents of Steel\\", has over half a million listens on YouTube as of 2020. Shortly after the band's debut album was released, a falling out with John Cyriis led to the departure of Colfelt. Colfelt was then replaced with new guitarist Bernie Versailles. In October 1985, the band recorded an EP titled Mad Locust Rising, which was released in January 1986. Bassist George Robb was fired after the recordings and was replaced by Letchen Grey bassist Michael Zaputil shortly after. In March 1986, Agent Steel entered the studio once again to record their second album Unstoppable Force. The recordings came to a halt when the band went to perform at the Aardschok Dag Festival in Eindhoven in April 1986. In May 1986, they toured Europe with Anthrax and Overkill before returning to the studio to finish the recordings in June 1986. The album's release was then delayed due to complications with the cover artwork. An early 1987 release was then planned. In November 1986, Capitol Records expressed interest in signing the band, who had recently signed Megadeth. The band's management demanded more money, in which the label agreed to, with a stipulation that the band would have to wait until the new year to release the album, and with the acquisition of new department budgets. John Cyriis and Chuck Profus moved to Florida for various reasons, while the rest of the members remained in California. In January 1987, Capitol Records withdrew from the offer due to suspicions within the band's line-up changes. Unstoppable Force was released in March 1987 by Combat Records instead. Cyriis and Profus were then joined by guitarists James Murphy and Jay Weslord, and bassist Richard Bateman. The new line-up performed shows in Europe with Nuclear Assault in June 1987, one of them being at the Hammersmith Apollo, in which their final performance can be seen on the 1989 home video Mad Locust Rising. In 1988 the band disbanded, as their record label, Combat Records, put them on suspension. This suspension lasted for as long as the band's contract with the label lasted ‚Äî about three years or so. In an interview, Cyriis stated his version as to why Agent Steel was disbanded in 1988: ‚Äú....Agent Steel was buried alive by Combat Records, who put the band on suspension for no legitimate, justifiable reason. Why they did so, remains a mystery to this very day. There are many conspiracy theories‚Äô that dabble with the answer as to why Combat Records buried the Agent Steel band in 1987; however, there are many theories as to why this happened - including a few of my own - but all the same, no substantial proof as of this writing have been brought out supported by facts, to support the more popular theories which are in truth actual cover ups to the real factual based truth!‚Äù =First reformation (1998‚Äì2009)= In 1998, guitarists Juan Garcia and Bernie Versailles reformed Agent Steel without Cyriis' consent, featuring returning members Chuck Profus and Michael Zaputil, and new vocalist Bruce Hall. Zaputil left the band shortly after and new bassist Karlos Medina would replace him. The third album Omega Conspiracy was released on October 25, 1999. In 2001, the band changed their name to Order of the Illuminati due to legal pressure from Cyriis. Profus left the band in 2002 and was replaced with new drummer Rigo Amezcua. They would return to the Agent Steel name and would record their fourth album Order of the Illuminati, the same name they performed as at the time. It was released on June 10, 2003. In 2004, the band performed at the Dynamo Open Air festival, which is featured as a DVD, released on March 21, 2005, and also touring Europe with the band After All in the spring of 2005. On August 31, 2007, the fifth album Alienigma was released. =Reunion with John Cyriis and second hiatus (2010‚Äì2011)= On April 24, 2010, vocalist Bruce Hall announced his departure. He explained why, \\"I complain a lot and I've pretty much lost my stamina for bothering with anything new as far as Agent Steel goes. Sadly, the continual walk in John's shoes has entirely drained my passion for doing anything other than treating Agent Steel as a cover band. Y'know, go out, play the first two albums for a free trip to wherever and call it a swell hobby? Well, that wasn't going to work for anyone in the band but me. They still have the fire and desire to continue making new music with Agent Steel and I wish them the very best of luck with whomever they get to fill John's shoes\\". On May 3, 2010, Agent Steel announced that they would reunite with John Cyriis. They performed at the Thrash Domination event on September 18 & 19 in Kawasaki, and was also rehearsing their classic material as well as working on new songs for a future album release, in which one of the tracks that Cyriis would write lyrics to had a working title of \\"Behold...The Great Race\\". On January 24, 2011, Agent Steel announced that Cyriis would not perform with the band on the 70000 Tons of Metal cruise due to \\"unfortunate events\\". Helstar vocalist James Rivera and Steel Prophet vocalist Rick Mythiasin would fill in for him, in which they would perform as Masters of Metal. On February 24, 2011, the band would cancel their appearance at the Keep It True festival in April. The organizers of the event explained that they were \\"facing totally new demands from one part of the band, that we, as a still small and dedicated festival, could not meet and really also do not want to meet. This, plus the troubles within the band itself, led to the final cancellation of Agent Steel with John Cyriis.\\" Guitarist Juan Garcia denied any rumors that Rick Mythiasin was the band's new vocalist, but was only a temporary fill-in for Cyriis. Due to the circumstances surrounding the band, the organizers invited Agent Steel to still perform, but under a different name, and that Mythiasin would be invited to perform onstage with them. Cyriis later returned to the band and performed at the Sweden Rock Festival, which was claimed to be his final performance with the band, but was refuted by Cyriis during the event. Despite his apparent return, he would perform with his band S.E.T.I. at the Headbangers Open Air festival in July. Meanwhile, the remaining members of Agent Steel have continued to perform as Masters of Metal, releasing their debut album From Worlds Beyond on September 18, 2015. =Second reformation (2018‚Äìpresent)= In November 2018, John Cyriis returned once more to reform Agent Steel, fronting a line-up of new members. He announced that the band would perform at the Keep It True festival in April 2019, and release their first studio album in twelve years, originally titled 8 Lights Protocol, with a tentative September 2019 release. At the time of the event, the band performed for only 30 minutes instead of the originally scheduled one hour set. German-based magazine Underground Empire explained in an Instagram post that the band started later \\"because of a traffic jam\\", which then caused complaints from fans. The band posted a photo of the show the next day with the caption, \\"Germany truly was a phenomenon, but only the very beginning...\\" On June 20, 2019, the new members were revealed as guitarist Nikolay Atanasov, original guitarist Bill Simmons, bassist Joe McGuigan and drummer Dennis Kruse Str√∏mberg. They signed to Dissonance Productions and had changed the title of their sixth studio album to No Mercy from the Godz, which was originally due for release on October 18, 2019, with a tour to follow in late 2019 and throughout 2020. In July 2019, the band announced that they changed the title of the album again to No Others Godz Before Me. In December 2019, Agent Steel released two visualizer videos for demo versions of two new songs titled \\"Separation of Church and Fate\\" and \\"Way of the Mechanism\\". After a two-year delay, No Other Godz Before Me will be released on March 19, 2021.

Reference jurisdiction and the separation of powers In the latter case the Court is, strictly speaking, not exercising a judicial function but rather, pursuant to the ruling of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Attorney-General of Ontario v Attorney-General of Canada (Reference Appeal) [1912] AC 571, one of advising the executive branch of government, a jurisdiction expressly conferred on the Supreme Court by Papua New Guinea's Constitution. Other jurisdictions, notably the USA (federally, though not in all states) and Australia, eschew the reference function for their courts on the grounds that it violates the principle of the separation of powers as among the legislative, executive and judiciary; in Canada it is held that the principle is inapplicable in a parliamentary democracy. The constitutional convention which deliberated on the drafting of Papua New Guinea's Constitution immediately prior to Independence took counsel from Canadian academics and the reference procedure was readily adopted. In Papua New Guinean jurisprudence, as in Australia, the formula \\"separation of powers\\" is frequently referred to. However, as in Australia (and unlike in the USA where the principle was enunciated and where the executive is not responsible to the legislature) it has a special limited application, being confined to describing the well-established convention of an independent judiciary, dating from the English Bill of Rights 1689': the executive is, of course, responsible to the legislature in Papua New Guinea's Parliament. Developing the underlying law The Supreme Court (together with the National Court) has a special responsibility for developing the underlying law, i.e. the common law of Papua New Guinea, having resort to those rules of local custom in various regions of the country which may be taken to be common to the whole country. The responsibility has been given additional express warrant in the Underlying Law Act 2000 which purports to mandate greater attention by the courts to custom and the development of customary law as an important component of the underlying law. In practice the courts have found great difficulty in applying the vastly differing custom of the many traditional societies of the country in a modern legal system and the development of the customary law according to indigenous Melanesian conceptions of justice and equity has been less thorough than may have been anticipated in 1975; the Underlying Law Act does not yet appear to have had significant effect. An ardent proponent of the underlying law, David Gonol in his book titled The Underlying Law of Papua New Guinea: An inquiry into adoption and application of customary law expounded at length on these issues.D Gonol, The Underlying Law of Papua New Guinea : an inquiry into adoption and application of customary law (2016, UPNG Press and Bookshop) Further, in the 2017 Third National Underlying Law Conference, many notable speakers expressed similar sentiments that the underlying law is not being developed at sufficient pace. Hierarchy of precedent The hierarchy of case law precedent is that while the Supreme Court has authority to overrule any case authority, its own decisions are binding on the lower courts as are the decisions of the English superior courts prior to Papua New Guinea's independence, which are deemed to be part of Papua New Guinea's underlying law. Decisions of the pre- Independence Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea are deemed to be foreign law, equivalent in authority to decisions by any foreign court with a similar legal system, and of persuasive value only. The principle of the mere persuasiveness of overseas (and pre-Independence Papua New Guinea) authority vis-√†-vis the binding authority of pre-1975 English authority has been applied many times in, for example, Toglai Apa and Bomai Siune v The State [1995] PNGLR 43 that it is bound to follow the English case of Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129Rookes v Barnard [1964] AC 1129, available via http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/1964/1.html on the ineligibility of plaintiffs to an award of exemplary damages against ministers of the state or public servants other than in strictly limited circumstances, notwithstanding its having been decisively overruled by both the High Court of Australia and the Supreme Court of Canada. Appeals from the Supreme Court to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council were abolished by Ireland in 1933, Canada in 1949, India in 1950, Guyana in 1970, Sri Lanka in 1972, Australia federally in 1968,Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act, 1968 (Cth) and from Australian States in 1975.Privy Council (Appeals from the High Court) Act, 1975 (Cth) They accordingly did not exist from the High Court of Australia when Papua New Guinea was granted independence, and consideration of appeals to London from Papua New Guinea did not arise. Canadian appeals to the Privy Council were often heard by an Australian judge and vice versa; admirable cases decided in the other country are occasionally followed as are parliamentary statutes adopted even yet though seldom expressly acknowledged. Chief Justice The Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea, appointed under Papua New Guinea's Constitution by the Head of State,Constitution s 169(2) presides over the Supreme Court and the National Court.Constitution ss 161(1) and 164(a) The independence of the Bench was tested in 1979 during the Rooney Affair (see Law of Papua New Guinea), whose outcome was the resignation of Sir William Prentice, the second (and expatriate) Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea together with three other expatriate judges. Sir Buri Kidu then became the first national Chief Justice (1980‚Äì1993). At the end of his ten-year term, Kidu was succeeded by Sir Arnold Amet (1993‚Äì2003). Amet was succeeded by Sir Mari Kapi, who served as Chief Justice from August 16, 2003 until his resignation in 2008 for health reasons. Kapi was succeeded the same year by Sir Salamo Injia.

Major league career Manning, who was the second overall selection in the 1972 MLB draft, made his major league debut with the Indians during the 1975 season. In 1976, he was recognized for his defensive play by winning the American League Gold Glove Award. Manning had a romantic involvement with teammate Dennis Eckersley's wife, Denise; they eventually married, and then divorced. This may have led to the Indians' front office's decision to trade one of the players; there were other \\"official\\" and \\"unofficial\\" reasons given. Eckersley, a future Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher, was traded with Fred Kendall on March 30, 1978, to the Boston Red Sox for Rick Wise, Mike Paxton, Bo D√≠az and Ted Cox. After playing five more seasons with the Indians, Manning was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers during the 1983 season. As a member of the Brewers, he hit a 10th-inning single on August 26, 1987 as the Brewers defeated the Indians 1-0. Brewers fans actually booed Manning for driving in the winning run because Paul Molitor was on deck and looking to extend his 39-game hit streak. Manning's walk-off single deprived Molitor of one last chance to reach 40 games as he went 0-for-4 in the contest. Career highlights On May 15, 1981, Manning caught Ernie Whitt's fly ball, the final out of Len Barker's perfect game, in one of the most memorable images in Cleveland sports history; the Indians defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 3-0. Broadcasting career Since 1990, he has served as a color commentator for Indians telecasts. Manning has the longest tenure of any television announcer in team history. Manning can be seen doing Tribe games on SportsTime Ohio (alongside Matt Underwood). He resides in Chesterland, Ohio, during the season, and Goodyear, Arizona, (the spring training city for the Indians) in the offseason. He also occasionally provides color commentary on regional broadcasts for Major League Baseball on FOX, mainly when FOX shows an Indians game.

It was adapted and directed by John Huston and starred Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Saeed Jaffrey, and Christopher Plummer as Kipling (giving a name to the novella's anonymous narrator). The film follows two rogue ex-soldiers, former non-commissioned officers in the British Army, who set off from late 19th-century British India in search of adventure and end up in faraway Kafiristan, where one is taken for a god and made their king. Plot In 1885 in India, while working late at night in his newspaper office, the journalist Rudyard Kipling is approached by a ragged, seemingly crazed derelict who reveals himself to be Peachy Carnehan, an old acquaintance. Carnehan tells Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms Danny Dravot, ex-sergeants of the British Army who had become adventurers, travelled far beyond India into the remote land of Kafiristan. Three years earlier, Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances. After stealing Kipling's pocket-watch, Carnehan found a masonic tag on the chain and, realising he had robbed a fellow Freemason, had to return it. At the time, he and Dravot were working on a plot to blackmail a local rajah, which Kipling foiled by getting the British district commissioner to intervene. In a comic relief turn, Carnehan obliquely blackmails the commissioner in order to avoid deportation. Frustrated at the lack of opportunities for lucrative criminal mischief in an India becoming more civilised and regulated, partly through their own hard efforts as soldiers, and with little to look forward to in England except petty jobs, the two turn up at Kipling's office with an audacious plan. Forsaking India, they will head with twenty rifles and ammunition to Kafiristan, a country virtually unknown to Europeans since its conquest by Alexander the Great. There they will offer their services to a ruler and then help him to conquer his neighbours, but proceed to overthrow him and loot the country. Kipling, after first trying to dissuade them, gives Dravot his masonic tag as a token of brotherhood. After signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing drink and women, the two set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the Khyber Pass. Over the next few weeks, they travel through Afghanistan, fighting off bandits, blizzards, and avalanches as they make their way into the unknown land of Kafiristan. They chance upon a Gurkha soldier, Billy Fish, the sole survivor of a years-before British expedition. Speaking English as well as the local language, Billy smooths their way as they begin their rise, first offering their services to the chief of a much-raided village. When a force has been trained in modern weapons and tactics, they lead it out against some hated neighbours. During the battle, an arrow pierces Dravot's jacket but he is unharmed. Both sides take him to be a god, though in fact the missile was stopped by his leather bandolier. Victory follows victory, with the defeated added to the ranks of the swelling army. Finally, nobody is left to stand in their way and they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul by the high priest of the region. He sets up a re-enactment of the arrow incident, to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds. When his shirt is torn open, they are amazed to see the masonic tag around his neck. It contains the sacred symbol left by Sikander (their name for Alexander the Great), who had promised to send a son to rule over them. Hailing Dravot as king as well as god, they show him the royal treasury, which is full of unimaginable amounts of gold and jewels that are now all his. Carnehan suggests that they leave with as much loot as they can carry as soon as the snows have melted on the mountain passes. Dravot, however, is beginning to enjoy the adulation of the locals, settling their disputes and issuing laws, and even dreams of visiting Queen Victoria as an equal. He is also struck by the beauty of a girl called Roxana, the name of Alexander's wife, and cancels their pact to avoid women, saying he will marry her in order to leave the people an heir. When she is reluctantly brought to him, he tries to kiss her, but she, terrified that the touch of a god means death to a mortal, bites his cheek. Seeing him bleed, the people realise he is only human and try to grab the English impostors. Outnumbered in the ensuing battle and captured, Dravot is made to walk onto a rope bridge, where he lustily sings the hymn \\"The Son of God Goes Forth to War\\". When the ropes are cut, he falls thousands of feet to his death. Carnehan is crucified between two pine trees but, on being found still alive next morning, is freed. Crippled in body and unhinged in mind from his ordeal, he eventually made his way back to India as a beggar. Finishing his story, he leaves Kipling's office after putting a bundle on the desk. When Kipling opens it, he finds Dravot's severed head, still wearing a golden crown.

Huston had planned to make the film since the 1950s, originally with Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart in the roles of Daniel and Peachy.TimesTalks: Michael Caine: Five Favorite Films  The New York Times on YouTube He was unable to get the project off the ground before Bogart died in 1957; Gable followed in 1960. Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas were then approached to play the leads, followed by Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole. In the 1970s, Huston approached Robert Redford and Paul Newman for the roles. Newman advised Huston that British actors should play the roles, and it was he who recommended Connery and Caine.Huston, J. (1975). The making of the man who would be king. Allied Artists Pictures. Caine was very keen to appear especially after he was told that his part had originally been written for Humphrey Bogart, his favorite actor as a young man. Christopher Plummer was cast as Rudyard Kipling as a last minute replacement for Richard Burton. The role of Roxanne (the only listed female character in the movie) was originally slated for Tessa Dahl, the daughter of Roald Dahl and actress Patricia Neal. Dahl, excited to take the role, had prepared for the part by losing weight and capping her teeth.Patricia Neal: An Unquiet Life by Stephen Shearer (pg 313) However, at the last minute, director Huston had decided to cast someone whose appearance was more in keeping with natives of Kafiristan. \\"We've got to find an Arab princess somewhere\\", he is recounted as saying over dinner with Caine. At that same dinner, Caine's ethnic-Indian wife Shakira was present, so Huston and Caine persuaded her to take on the role. The film was shot at Pinewood Studios and at locations in France and Ouarzazate, Morocco. While on location, both Connery and Caine strongly objected to the racist treatment of Saeed Jaffrey, who had been cast to play the Gurkha guide Billy Fish. Stuntman Joe Powell doubled for Sean Connery and it was he who performed the fall from the rope bridge at the film's climax. Execution involved a potentially fatal fall of 80 feet onto a pile of cardboard boxes and mattresses. Huston was so impressed with Powell's performance he stated \\"That's the darndest stunt I've ever seen!\\" Michael Caine stated that Sean Connery did not like heights and was not fond of the final scene in which he had to walk to the middle of the bridge. Differences from the novella The movie is a generally faithful adaptation of the novella, but for some small narrative differences. In the movie: * Kipling, a journalist, is presented as the principal narrator, only implied in the novella. * Dravot and Carnehan are shown the treasures of Alexander, not in the novella. * Billy Fish is an ex-Gurkha soldier, the sole survivor of an expedition, rather than a native chief loyal to the Englishmen. * Billy Fish interprets for the pair; in the novella, Dravot speaks the local native languages. * Dravot is smitten by Roxanne's beauty, and then decides to marry her, rather than first seeing her at their wedding. * Dravot's head is left on Kipling's desk by Carnehan; in the novella he takes it with him, and is later found insane and dying by Kipling, without the head. Reception John Simon of New York magazine considered the film to be Huston's best work since The African Queen, twenty-three years earlier. Jay Cocks of Time commented \\"John Huston has been wanting to make this movie for more than twenty years. It was worth the wait.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and wrote: \\"It's been a long time since there's been an escapist entertainment quite this unabashed and thrilling and fun.\\" Some critics felt that the film was too long and that Caine had overplayed his part. A review in Variety was critical of the film mostly because of Caine's performance, stating \\"Whether it was the intention of John Huston or not, the tale of action and adventure is a too-broad comedy, mostly due to the poor performance of Michael Caine.\\" This film has a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 29 reviews. Both Connery and Caine considered the movie their favorite of all they had worked on.‚ÄúSean Connery still has special Bond with movie fans‚Äù. Sunday Post.

A key song, which figures within the plot of the movie, is a fusion of the music of the Irish song \\"The Minstrel Boy\\" with the lyrics of Reginald Heber's \\"The Son of God Goes Forth to War\\". This song is heard at key moments in the score, notably being sung by Dravot as he is being executed and as he tumbles to his death.

Published in 1782, the tract aimed to encourage Central European Jewry to accept the Edict of Toleration issued by Emperor Joseph II of Austria, which sought to promote a greater degree of acculturation and secularization among the Jewish community. The text was geared particularly toward Rabbinic leadership. Wessely wished to convince the Rabbinic authorities that the spread of secular education would be to the benefit of the Jewish community, and was not something that they should fear. He essentially differentiated between two different kinds of knowledge: Torat Ha-Elohim (divine, or religious knowledge) and Torat Ha-Adam (human, or secular knowledge). While both components are necessary, Wessely argued that the acquisition of secular education must precede the acquisition of divine knowledge; ultimately, secular learning is a universal body of knowledge which is to be supplemented by the religious instruction of the Torah. In many ways, Wessely's reprioritization of education was contrary to traditional Jewish practice. The study of secular subjects first and the Torah second seemed repugnant to many rabbis, who denounced the work in harsh terms. In Vilna, the book was burned publicly; however in Italy and other places, it was applauded as an enlightened and legitimate work.

This initiative began in early 2002, and the first phase was completed in December 2004. An external review was undertaken , recommending expansion of the FEAST concept to other countries, and a continuation of FEAST in Australia. After successful completion of its third round of funding in mid-2012, the fourth implementation was renamed Connecting Australian-European Science and Innovation Excellence (CAESIE) and placed a greater emphasis on innovation and business. This project concluded at the end of 2015, and no further implementations of the FEAST bilateral initiative have been implemented since.

Taliaferro and S. Carpenter. (2010) \\"Farms\\" in Life Science Ethics. ed. Gary L. Comstock. Many of these views are also used to guide decisions dealing with land use in general. (Please see the Wikipedia article on environmental philosophy.) In everyday usage, it can also be defined as the love of, search after, and wisdom associated with agriculture, as one of humanity's founding components of civilization.Lindsay Falvey (2005) Religion and Agriculture: Sustainability in Christianity and Buddhism. c.350pp. Institute for International Development, Adelaide and Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai. However, this view is more aptly known as agrarianism. In actuality, agrarianism is only one philosophy or normative framework out of many that people use to guide their decisions regarding agriculture on an everyday basis. The most prevalent of these philosophies will be briefly defined below. Utilitarian approach This view was first put forth by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill. Though there are many varieties of utilitarianism, generally the view is that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/ History of Utilitarianism This theory is a form of consequentialism; which basically means that the correct action is understood entirely in terms of the consequences of that action. Utilitarianism is often used when deciding farming issues. For example, farmland is commonly valued based upon its capacity to the grow crops that people want. This approach to valuing land is called Asset Theory (in contrast to Location Theory) and it is based upon utilitarian principles. Another example is when a community decides on what to do with a particular parcel of land. Let's say that this community must decide to use it for industry, residential uses, or for farming. By using a utilitarian approach, the council would judge which use would benefit the greatest number of people in the community and then make their choice based upon that information. Finally, it also forms the foundation for industrial farming; as an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. Indeed, a common argument in favor of industrial agriculture is this it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices.Conkin, Paul. (2009) Revolution Down on the Farm: The Transformation of American Agriculture since 1929. Raleigh: The University of Kentucky Press; Kingsolver, Barbara. (2007)Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. However, several scholars and writers, such as Peter Singer, Aldo Leopold, Vandana Shiva, Barbara Kingsolver, and Wendell Berry have argued against this view. For example, Singer argues that the suffering of animals (farm animals included) should be included in the cost/benefit calculus when deciding whether or not to do an action such as industrial farming.Singer, Peter. (2002) Animal Liberation. New York: Harper Collins. It has also been challenged on the grounds that farmland and farm animals are instrumentalized in this view and not valued in and of themselves.Thompson, Paul. (2010) \\"Land.\\" \\"Life Science Ethics.\\" ed. Gary L. Comstock. Raleigh: Springer Publishing. In addition, systems thinkers, deep ecologists, and agrarian philosophers (such as Aldo Leopold & Wendell Berry) critique this view on the grounds that it ignores aspects of farming which are morally applicable and/or intrinsically valuable.Leopold, A. (1948) A Sand County Almanac. Oxford: Oxford University Press; Berry, Wendell. (2002) The Art of the Commonplace: The Agrarian Essays of Wendell Berry. Berkeley: Counterpoint Press. The Slow Food Movement and the Buy Local Agricultural Movements are also built upon philosophical views morally opposed to extreme versions of this approach. Other critiques will be explored below when different philosophical approaches to agriculture are briefly explained. However, it is important to note that the utilitarian approach to agriculture is currently the most widespread approach within the modern Western World. Libertarian approach Another philosophical approach often used when deciding land or farming issues is Libertarianism. Libertarianism is, roughly, the moral view that agents own themselves and have certain moral rights including the right to acquire property.Vallentyne, Peter, \\"Libertarianism\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) In a looser sense, libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each person has a right to a maximum amount of liberty when this liberty does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well known libertarian theorist is John Hospers. Within this view, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for a farmer to inefficiently farm their land as long as they don't harm others while doing it. In 1968, Garrett Harden applied this philosophy to land/farming issues when he argued that the only solution to the \\"Tragedy of the Commons\\" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens.Harden, Garrett. (1968) \\"The Tragedy of the Commons.\\" Science, 162, 1243-1248 He then supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument and, indeed, one could argue that libertarianism is rooted in utilitarian ideals. However, this leaves libertarian based land ethics open to the above critiques lodged against utilitarian approaches to agriculture. Even excepting these critiques, the libertarian view has been specifically challenged by the critique that people making self-interested decisions can cause large ecological and social disasters such as the Dust Bowl disaster. Even so, it is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, by U.S. ranchers and farmers. Egalitarian approach Egalitarian-based views are often developed as a response to libertarianism. This is because, while libertarianism provides for the maximum amount of human freedom, it does not require a person to help others. It also leads to the grossly uneven distribution of wealth. A well known egalitarian philosopher is John Rawls. When focusing on agriculture, what this translates into is the uneven distribution of land and food. While both utilitarian and libertarian approaches to agriculture ethics could conceivably rationalize this mal- distribution, an egalitarian approach typically favors equality whether that be equal entitlement and/or opportunity to employment or access to food.Arneson, Richard, \\"Egalitarianism\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = However, if one recognizes that people have a right to something, then someone has to supply this opportunity or item, whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, the egalitarian view links land and water with the right to food. With the growth of human populations and the decline of soil and water resources, egalitarianism could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water. Ecological or systems approach In addition to utilitarian, libertarian, and egalitarian philosophies, there are normative views that are based upon the principle that land has intrinsic value and positions coming out of an ecological or systems view. Two main examples of this are James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis which postulates that the Earth is an organismLovelock, James (2009). The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A Final Warning: Enjoy It While You Can. Allen Lane. . and deep ecologists who argue that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities.Naess, Arne (1973) 'The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement.' Inquiry 16: 95-100 While these philosophies can be useful for guiding decision making on issues concerning land in general, they have limited usefulness when applied to agriculture because they privilege natural ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems are often considered not natural. One philosophy grounded in the principle that land has intrinsic value which is directly applicable to agriculture is Aldo Leopold's stewardship ethic or land ethic, in which an action is correct if it tends to \\"preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community\\".Leopold, A. (1948) A Sand County Almanac. Oxford: Oxford University Press Similar to egalitarian-based land ethics, many of the above philosophies were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian based approaches. Leopold's ethic is currently one of the most popular ecological approaches to agriculture commonly known as agrarianism. Other agrarianists include Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, J. Hector St. John de Cr√®vec≈ìur (1735‚Äì1813), Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803‚Äì1882), Henry David Thoreau (1817‚Äì1862), John Steinbeck (1902‚Äì1968), Wendell Berry (b. 1934), Gene Logsdon (b. 1932), Paul B. Thompson, and Barbara Kingsolver.

Montgomery was considered one of the foremost academics specializing in United States labor history and wrote extensively on the subject. He is credited, along with David Brody and Herbert Gutman, with founding the field of \\"new labor history\\" in the U.S.  Biography  =Early years= Montgomery entered undergraduate school at Swarthmore College following a stint in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, from which he was honorably discharged as a Staff Sergeant. He graduated in 1950 with Highest Honors and a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. Over the next 10 years, Montgomery worked as a machinist‚Äîfirst in New York City and later in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Montgomery became involved in union activity as an active member of the United Electrical Workers, the International Association of Machinists, and the Teamsters where he held numerous positions including shop steward, legislative committee member, and local executive board member. Montgomery may have been repeatedly targeted by the FBI when he was a labor organizer among machinists in St. Paul, Minnesota. Montgomery became a member of the Communist Party, USA In 1951 or 1952 due to the party's positions on international issues, racial justice and social unionism. He was active with the party in New York City and briefly in St. Paul. He left the party around 1957. Montgomery's experience in the Communist Party clearly influenced his research interest in labor radicalism, among other issues, throughout his scholarly career.James R. Barrett, \\"Class Act: An Interview with David Montgomery,\\" Labor: Studies in Working-Class History of the Americas 1:1 (Spring 2004): 23-54. =Academic career= In 1959, Montgomery entered graduate school at the University of Minnesota, from which he received his Ph.D. in 1962. The next year he was hired as an assistant professor of history at the University of Pittsburgh, where he remained for the next 14 years. At the University of Pittsburgh, Montgomery wrote his first book, Beyond Equality: Labor and the Radical Republicans, 1862-1872, which was published in 1967. On sabbatical from that institution, Montgomery spent two years working in England with historian E. P. Thompson to establish the Centre for the Study of Social History at the University of Warwick. He subsequently held visiting teacher positions at Oxford University and a number of other universities in Brazil, Canada, and the Netherlands. On his return to the United States, Montgomery returned to the University of Pittsburgh, becoming chair of the department. He was recruited by several other institutions, eventually accepting a position at Yale. Montgomery taught courses about the history of working people in the United States, Civil War and Reconstruction, and immigration. In 1988, his book The Fall of the House of Labor: The Workplace, the State, and American Labor Activism, 1865-1925, was published to wide acclaim. Noam Chomsky, the renowned professor of linguistics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and political activist, called the book one of the definitive works on the American labor struggle. The book was a Pulitzer Prize finalist nominee. Following the example of British historian E. P. Thompson, Montgomery encouraged a generation of labor historians to re- examine the core subject matter of labor history, thus defining the new labor history, which examines working-class culture, rather than simply their organizations. He was also influential through his editorship of the journal International Labor and Working-Class History. In 2001, Montgomery published a book in collaboration with Professor Horace Huntley of the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. The book, Black Workers' Struggle for Equality in Birmingham, uses oral histories to interpret and explore the involvement of African American workers in various unions and the organized labor movement for civil rights. During the 1990s, Montgomery wrote and spoke about academic freedom, calling for wider availability of information for research and in favor of a larger scope of academic freedom. He claimed that over the presidential administrations of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, access to government documents had been sharply reduced and that this has resulted in less academic freedom. Additionally, Montgomery criticized the USA's Patriot Act and its provisions for surveillance of academics and librarians, arguing they impede academic freedom. He also served as president of the Organization of American Historians (OAH) from 1999 to 2000. =Death and legacy= David Montgomery died on December 2, 2011. He is survived by his wife, Martel, and two sons, New York attorney Claude Montgomery and economist Edward B. Montgomery. An obituary for Montgomery appeared Monday, December 5, 2011 in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In the spring of 2012 the Executive Board of the Organization of American Historians approved a new book award in the field of Labor and Working Class History to be named after David Montgomery.\\"David Montgomery Fund,\\" Journal of American History, vol. 99, no. 4 (March 2013), pg. 1349.

It is located in the City of Port Adelaide Enfield, and is adjacent to Wingfield, Angle Park, Ferryden Park, Kilburn, Prospect, Dudley Park and Croydon Park. It is bounded to the north by Grand Junction Road, east by the Gawler railway line, south by Regency Road and to the west by Days and South Roads. The postcode for Regency Park is 5010. Regency Park is essentially an industrial suburb, consisting of factories, but primarily industrial warehouses. Its streets are dominated by semitrailers.  History  The approximate area of Regency Park was originally called Tam O'Shanter Belt after the ship Tam O'Shanter which was grounded for several days near North Arm in December 1836. The ship passengers walked to North Adelaide and saw the ship behind them over a distinct belt of trees. The southern half of today's suburb of Regency Park was acquired in October 1838 by John Wright, a wealthy English banker, and was subsequently sold to the Tam O'Shanter Land Company. The village of Tam O'Shanter was created and occupied the present area of Regency Park. Between 1850 and 1860, a school, and The Freshwater Springs hotel was constructed. It was a semi- rural area, producing mainly vegetables and dairy products. In 1879 land that is now Regency Park was acquired by the City of Adelaide for the purpose of constructing the Islington Sewage Farm which operated from 1881 until 1966. From that time the land fell into disuse until the creation of the new industrial suburb of Regency Park, named in honour of Queen Elizabeth II (the regent) on her first ever visit to Adelaide in 1970. Regency Park was subdivided by the Government for light industry in four phrases between 1975 and 1981. In 1981 Sunnybrae Farm, of land remaining from the subdivisions, was transferred to the City of Enfield and declared a Historic Conservation and Recreation Centre. The Enfield & Districts Historical Society was incorporated in 1982 and the old farm buildings at Sunnybrae were restored by the society in partnership with the council. The site now houses a function centre and includes a museum originally created by the historical society.  Commercial, educational and administrative facilities  The largest family owned Australian brewery, Coopers Brewery relocated from Leabrook to the corner of South Road and Regency Road in Regency Park in 2001. The Regency Campus of TAFE SA (formerly the Regency Institute of TAFE) is located in Regency Park along with a special school for children with a mental disability. Due to the heavy presence of commercial shipping in Regency Park, there is a Transport SA office in the suburb catering largely for the semi trailers associated with the local industry.  Tourism, sport and recreation facilities  Islington Sewage Farm Straining Shed, facing east in the late 19th century The historic Islington Sewage Farm Straining Shed in Pedder Crescent and Sunnybrae Farm Complex on Naweena Road and are both listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. From 1995 until 2012 the Enfield & District Historical Society operated a history museum at the Sunnybrae complex after which time the property passed into private hands. A large part of Regency Park west of South Road is occupied by the Regency Park Golf Course and adjoining recreation park facilities.  Transport  The 361 bus serves Grand Junction Road. The 300 bus serves Regency Road its entire length. The 230 and 232 buses only serve Regency Road as far as Days Road. The 239 bus serves Days Road and Grand Junction Road. The suburb is also served by Islington railway station on the Gawler railway line. The North-South Motorway runs through Regency Park.

Founded in 1989, the label specializes in country music artists, including Alan Jackson, Brooks & Dunn, Brad Paisley, and Carrie Underwood, Jared Johnson, Beau Davidson, Paula MacNeill. The label used to operate three sister labels: Career Records, Arista Austin, and Arista Latin. It is a subsidiary of Arista Records since Arista's relaunch in 2018, but during the dissolution, Arista Nashville was not affected and it remains a Sony Music label. History Arista Nashville was formed in 1989 by Tim DuBois and Clive Davis. Alan Jackson was the first artist signed to the label. Artists signed to the label within its first five years included Asleep at the Wheel, Exile, Rob Crosby, Steve Wariner, Michelle Wright, Pam Tillis, Brooks & Dunn, Diamond Rio, Lee Roy Parnell, Radney Foster, Blackhawk, and The Tractors. Brooks & Dunn remained with the label for the entirety of their career. The label founded Arista Texas in 1993, a sub-label specializing in Texas music artists. In 1997, it was split into Arista Austin, which featured Jeff Black, Robert Earl Keen, and Abra Moore, and a Spanish-language label called Arista Latin. Foster also moved to Arista Austin from Arista Nashville in 1997. In 1995, Arista Nashville founded a sister label called Career Records. Parnell was transferred to this label upon its foundation, while Brett James and Tammy Graham were newly signed to it. All three artists moved back to Arista Nashville when Career Records was dissolved. While Graham and James were dropped from it soon afterward, James re-signed to Arista Nashville between 2002 and 2003. From 2005 to 2017, Arista Nashville, Arista Records, and 19 Recordings promoted and distributed recordings by American Idol winner Carrie Underwood. In late 2009, Brad Paisley launched a personal label, Sea Gayle, which is distributed through Arista. The label's first signee was Jerrod Niemann. During the years after the dissolution of Arista Records in 2011, Arista Nashville remained Sony Music's only label with the Arista name until Sony reopened Arista in July 2018, becoming Arista Nashville's parent company again.

Jolly Mill was named for the local Jolly family. The mill also served as a grist mill, and continued to operate in that capacity until 1975. (includes 8 photographs from 1982) Due to the flood in late December 2015, the park was heavily damaged. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. History The success of the mill led to the establishment in the 1850s and subsequent growth of the town of Jollification, the name referring to the unnaturally jovial disposition of the people who worked in and around the distillery. The town was burned during the Civil War, but the mill survived. The town was somewhat rebuilt. In 1870, the railroad bypassed what was left of Jollification, which ultimately led to its dissolution. The mill was purchased in 1983 by The Friends of Jolly Mill and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In recent years, under the care of The Friends of Jolly Mill, the mill has undergone somewhat of a renaissance. The mill and surrounding land have been restored and converted into a park, with many period buildings moved in from other locations in an attempt to replicate the look and feel of the town of Jollification. The mill is also a primary trout-fishing location, managed by the Missouri Department of Conservation as Capps Creek White Ribbon Trout Area. Four miles of trout stream are stocked with rainbow and brown trout periodically, and fishermen are permitted to harvest up to 4 trout per day.

James told investigators he managed to jump free, but Wallace remained trapped in the vehicle until it stopped against a large boulder about 150 feet below the road. When rescuers got to the scene, they found Wallace alive with relatively minor injuries despite the intensity of the crash. She also smelled of liquor and had a massive wound behind her ear. A coroner later (1935?) removed bullet fragments from her brain.http://crimefeed.com/2017/05/meet-rattlesnake-james-the-last-killer- hanged-by-california/ Wallace was released from the hospital on October 8 and recovering at a cottage in Manitou Springs when about a week later, James and a grocer found her lying on her back in a half-filled tub. At the coroner's inquest, medical examiner George B. Gilmore testified that James told him his wife had ignored physician's orders to avoid washing her hair because of the head wound and drowned as a result. Prudential eventually paid off on Wallace's policy. Following the death of Busch, an autopsy was made on Wallace and the medical examiner testified that she suffered two skull fractures caused by a hard, moving object projected against in it. Fourth wife Robert James reported his fourth wife was Ruth Thomas but said he wasn't sure about their marriage because he was drunk.The San Bernardino County Sun, San Bernardino, California, 10 Aug 1936, Page 2 He reported the marriage annulled in New Orleans in 1934. Death of nephew James took out an insurance policy on his nephew Cornelius Wright, a young sailor. James invited Wright to visit him while he was on leave. During the subsequent visit, James allowed his nephew to use his car. Wright thereafter died when he purportedly drove the car off a cliff. The mechanic who towed the wreck back to James told him that something was wrong with the steering wheel. Death of fifth wife In March 1935, Ray James met Mary Emma Busch, who would become his fifth wife. In June 1935, Ray asked Charles Hope, one of his loyal customers who was struggling financially, to help him kill Mary for her $5000 life insurance, offering $100 plus expenses for two rattlesnakes, which he planned to use to poison Mary. Hope brought the snakes to the James' house on August 4 to find Mary Emma, who was pregnant at the time, strapped to the kitchen table with her eyes and mouth taped shut. James said that he managed to get his wife on the table by telling her a doctor was coming to \\"perform some kind of operation on her for pregnancy.\\" Hope watched as Ray put Mary Emma's foot in the box with the two snakes, which bit her, then left the house to return and pick up his wife. Returning to the house at 1:30 a.m. Hope found that Mary was still alive. Drunk and outraged, Ray took her to the bathtub, drowned her, and put her body by the fish pond in their backyard in an attempt to make it look like an accident. Hope left, having refused James's order to burn down the house. Mary's death was ruled a drowning until a drunken Hope bragged at a bar about his involvement in her murder. The bartender reported this to police and Hope was arrested. Under intense questioning, Hope explained the plot thoroughly and James was arrested in 1936. A snake bite on Mary's toe overlooked during the autopsy confirmed this. Both were found guilty of their crimes, with James receiving the death penalty and Hope life in prison. On May 1, 1942, Rattlesnake James was executed by hanging at San Quentin State Prison in California. The rope was the wrong length and it took over ten minutes for Rattlesnake James to die.

Published in 2005 by Hyperion Books, the novel is about an American boy named Oliver who lives in Paris. Oliver stumbles into an ancient battle waged between Window Wraiths and the malicious Master of Mirrors, when the American boy is mistaken for a mystical king. Plot summary On the night of Epiphany, after enjoying his piece of Epiphany kingcake and wearing a gold paper crown, Oliver gazes out the window. He is approached by a haunting vision of another boy in the reflection. This mysterious boy is a window wraith, and he mistakes Oliver for the new king. The window wraith boy calls Oliver to wield his sword and reclaim the kingdom, luring him into a journey of self-discovery that could save the world. The window wraiths are a cadre of France's deceased poets and artists, such as Moli√®re, who claim Oliver as the king who will save them from the evil force dwelling behind the mirrors of the world capturing the souls of those who stare too long. The element of mirrors in the book is also an ode to Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass and there is also a pivotal character who is a descendant of Alice Liddell. Background In a 2005 interview with Charlie Rose, Gopnik explained that he was inspired to write the novel when he saw his own son celebrate Epiphany in Paris.

Biography He was born in Dayton, Ohio, in March 1888 and died in 1957. He attended The Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, and spent two years at Yale University before returning to his father's construction company in 1911. He was a well-known polo player. =Family= Talbott's father was a wealthy engineer who was involved in the construction of the Soo Locks on Lake Superior and had various railroad and paper milling interests.Mrs. Talbott's Gesture - TIME Talbott Sr. was the first mayor of Oakwood, Ohio. He was also involved in the recovery of Dayton from the 1913 flood. He served as the director of the City National Bank of Dayton. His mother was active in the Dayton anti-suffrage league, which opposed giving women the right to vote. She was also involved in the Anti-Saloon League and was a patroness of the Dayton Westminster Choir. His brother Nelson \\"Bud\\" Talbott was the coach for the Dayton Triangles professional football team, a predecessor to today's Indianapolis Colts. His great-nephew Strobe Talbott was a deputy secretary of state in the Clinton administration. In 1925, Talbott married Margaret Thayer (1898‚Äì1962), who was the daughter of Marian Longstreth Morris Thayer, a survivor of the disaster, and John B. Thayer, a railroad executive who perished aboard the ship. Harold's and Margaret's children included Margaret Noyes, Pauline Toland, John Thayer Talbott, and H. E. Talbott III.Encyclopedia Titanica Message Board: Jack Thayer's full name In July 1962 his wife (Margaret Thayer) committed suicide by jumping from the 12th story of their Fifth Avenue apartment in New York City. During World War II, the Runnymede Playhouse on the Talbott family estate in a residential neighborhood of Oakwood, Montgomery County, Ohio (a suburb of Dayton), hosted the Dayton Project (the part of the Manhattan Project involved in creating the neutron-generating triggers for the first atomic bombs from radioactive polonium). Charles Allen Thomas, a Delco-GM and Monsanto Company chemist who was in charge of the project, was married to Harold's sister Margaret. =Career= From 1906 to about 1913 Harold Talbott served as president of Platt Iron Works in Dayton along with his polo teammate Edwin F. Platt. Talbott's interest in aviation dated from the early days of the Wright brothers. He was a pupil of Katharine Wright and a customer of the Wright's bicycle shop. In 1915 Talbott helped build one of the first wind tunnels for aviation experiments in Dayton. In the spring of 1916, his father, Edward A. Deeds, and Charles Kettering formed the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company, which reused the factory buildings of the 1909‚Äì1916 Wright Company but was a completely different business. The young Talbott became the company's president, while Orville Wright received a courtesy position as a consulting engineer. Talbott was a passenger on Orville's last flight in 1918. At the beginning of World War I, Deeds joined the US Army with the rank of colonel and became Chief of Aircraft Production. At McCook Field, a precursor to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Deeds supervised aircraft procurement. The Dayton-Wright Company took over the newly built Delco-Light plant. The expanded plant constructed the two-seat fighter, the DeHaviland‚Äì4, later modified to the DeHaviland‚Äì9, and turned out about 400 training planes. In 1918 the plant, which employed 12,000 people, produced 38 planes per day and manufactured more wartime aircraft overall than any other U.S. plant. During September 1918, Talbott was commissioned a major in the Air Service of the Signal Corps. His assignment as one of a group of officers in charge of aircraft maintenance and repair in France was canceled by the armistice. In October 1918 Supreme Court Justice Charles Evans Hughes and Attorney General Thomas Watt Gregory reported to President Wilson on the results of an investigation into wartime aircraft production. Justice Hughes criticized the close relationship between Colonel Deeds and Dayton-Wright. Hughes specifically mentioned improper communications between Deeds and Harold Talbott about matters affecting aircraft procurement. Justice Hughes recommended that Colonel Deeds be court-martialed, but the Army did not pursue the case. In 1919 General Motors acquired DELCO-Light, Dayton-Wright, and the Dayton Metal Products Company.Our Company - History All were businesses associated with Talbott, Deeds, and Kettering. In 1922 GM established the Inland Manufacturing Division to build wooden steering wheels at the former Dayton-Wright plant. Talbott served as president of Inland. In 1925 Talbott moved to New York and became a director of Chrysler Corporation.The New Administration - Time In the 1930s he served as President of the Cloud Club located on the 66th, 67th, and 68th floors of the Chrysler Building in New York City. General Motors Corporation took a controlling interest in North American Aviation and merged it with its General Aviation division in 1933. In 1932 Talbott became chairman of the executive committee of NAA. In the 1930s he was also a director of TWA. At the time North American held shares in Douglas Aircraft Company which was building military aircraft. Talbott prevailed on Donald Douglas to enter the commercial market by building the DC-1 and DC-2 aircraft to TWA's specification. Talbott was an active Republican presidential campaign fund-raiser in 1940, 1948 and 1952. He was chairman of the Republican national finance committee in 1948 and 1949. He also had been a member of the War Production Board during 1942 and 1943. He became the third Secretary of the Air Force on February 4, 1953, during a period when the Korean War had jolted Congress into authorizing additional wings and their supporting infrastructure. Consequently, he was able to focus his efforts on the needs of airmen and their families. He succeeded in obtaining more military housing than had his predecessors. Combining better housing with pay increases and other needed improvements, he raised the service personnel retention rate by linking enhanced military benefits to reenlistment. In September 1953, Talbott famously confronted Howard Hughes about his management of the AIM-4 Falcon project and the loss of top members of management, within the Hughes Aircraft Co.David Leighton, The History of the Hughes Missile Plant in Tucson, 1947-1960, Private Publication, 2015 As a result, ICBM development for the Air Force transitioned to the Ramo-Wooldridge Corp (later TRW Inc.). During his tenure, Talbott appointed a commission to assist him in selecting the permanent site for the Air Force Academy. After considering 580 proposed sites in 45 states, the commission recommended three locations. From those, he selected the site near Colorado Springs. In 1955, the Chattanooga Times uncovered that Talbott was using Air Force stationery to solicit business for an engineering firm of which he owned fifty percent, from contractors who sold to the Air Force. After a Congressional investigation, Talbott resigned his position as Secretary in August 1955. Talbott died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Palm Beach, Florida, on March 2, 1957.

The figure is recognized by the red scarf it wears around its neck. Myrh√∏j published a total of four books about Pondus the Penguin, all issued between 1966 and 1969. Pondus also serves as a mascot for Denmark's largest bank, Danske Bank, where Pondus-shaped piggy banks have been given to children since 1967.

(2007) Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914, Leuven University Press War crimes Depiction of the execution of civilians in Bl√©gny by √âvariste Carpentier In some places, particularly Li√®ge, Andenne and Leuven, but firstly Dinant, there is evidence that the violence against civilians was premeditated. However, in Dinant, the German army believed the inhabitants were as dangerous as the French soldiers themselves.Horne & Kramer, German atrocities, Chapter I, Third Army and DinantBeckett, I.F.W. (ed., 1988) The Roots of Counter-Insurgency, Blandford Press, London. =Victimization of civilians= German troops, afraid of Belgian guerrilla fighters, or (\\"free shooters\\"), burned homes and executed civilians throughout eastern and central Belgium, including Aarschot (156 dead), Andenne (211 dead), , Tamines (383 dead), and Dinant (674 dead).John N. Horne & Alan Kramer (2001) German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial, Yale University Press, New Haven, Appendix I, German Atrocities in 1914 (from August 5 to October 21 and from Berneau (Province of Li√®ge) to Esen (Province of West Flanders)), The victims included men, women, and children.Alan Kramer (2007) Dynamic of Destruction: Culture and Mass Killing in the First World War Oxford University Press, pp. 1‚Äì24. In the Province of Brabant, nuns were ordered to strip under the pretext that they were spies or men in disguise. However, there is no evidence that nuns were violated. In and around Aarschot, between August 19 and the recapture of the town by September 9, women were repeatedly victimized. Rape was nearly as ubiquitous as murder, arson and looting, if never as visible. =Sack of Leuven= On August 25, 1914, the German army ravaged the city of Leuven, deliberately burning the university library, destroying approximately 230,000 books, 950 manuscripts, and 800 incunabula. Civilian homes were set on fire and citizens often shot where they stood,B.Tuchman, The Guns of August, pp. 340‚Äì356 with over 2,000 buildings destroyed and 10,000 inhabitants displaced. Large quantities of strategic materials, foodstuffs and modern industrial equipment were looted and transferred to Germany during 1914. These actions brought worldwide condemnation.Commission d'Enquete (1922) Rapports et Documents d'Enqu√™te, vol. 1, book 1. pp. 679‚Äì704, vol. 1, book 2, pp. 605‚Äì615. (There were also several friendly fire incidents between groups of German soldiers during the confusion.) =Death toll= The Germans were responsible for the deaths of 23,700 Belgian civilians, (6,000 Belgians killed, 17,700 died during expulsion, deportation, in prison or sentenced to death by court) and caused further non-fatalities of 10,400 permanent and 22,700 temporary invalids, with 18,296 children becoming war orphans. Military losses were 26,338 killed, died from injuries or accidents, 14,029 died from disease, or went missing. Industrial dismantlement An industrial bakery near the Ypres Salient used to feed the German Army As raw material usually imported from abroad dried up, more firms laid off workers. Unemployment became a major problem and increased reliance on charity distributed by civil institutions and organizations. As many as 650,000 people were unemployed between 1915 and 1918. The German authorities used the unemployment crisis to loot industrial machinery from Belgian factories, which was either sent to Germany intact or melted down. The German policies enacted by the Imperial German General Government of Belgium would later create major problems for Belgian economic recovery after the end of the war, the Germans destroyed the Belgian economy so thoroughly by dismantling industries and transporting the equipment and machinery to Germany that it never regained its pre-war level. Wartime propaganda The slogan \\"The Rape of Belgium\\" was used in the United States as a propaganda device to build popular support for American intervention in the European war. Agreeing with the analysis of historian Susan Kingsley Kent, historian Nicoletta Gullace writes that \\"the invasion of Belgium, with its very real suffering, was nevertheless represented in a highly stylized way that dwelt on perverse sexual acts, lurid mutilations, and graphic accounts of child abuse of often dubious veracity.\\" In Britain, many patriotic publicists propagated these stories on their own. For example, popular writer William Le Queux described the German army as \\"one vast gang of Jack-the-Rippers\\", and described in graphic detail events such as a governess hanged naked and mutilated, the bayoneting of a small baby, or the \\"screams of dying women\\", raped and \\"horribly mutilated\\" by German soldiers, accusing them of cutting off the hands, feet, or breasts of their victims. Gullace argues that \\"British propagandists were eager to move as quickly as possible from an explanation of the war that focused on the murder of an Austrian archduke and his wife by Serbian nationalists to the morally unambiguous question of the invasion of neutral Belgium\\". In support of her thesis, she quotes from two letters of Lord Bryce. In the first letter Bryce writes \\"There must be something fatally wrong with our so-called civilization for this Ser[b]ian cause so frightful a calamity has descended on all Europe\\". In a subsequent letter Bryce writes \\"The one thing we have to comfort us in this war is that we are all absolutely convinced of the justice of the cause, and of our duty, once Belgium had been invaded, to take up the sword\\". Although the infamous German phrase \\"scrap of paper\\" (referring to the 1839 Treaty of London) galvanized a large segment of British intellectuals in support of the war, in more proletarian circles this imagery had less impact. For example, Labour politician Ramsay MacDonald upon hearing about it, declared that \\"Never did we arm our people and ask them to give up their lives for a less good cause than this\\". British army recruiters reported problems in explaining the origins of the war in legalistic terms. As the German advance in Belgium progressed, British newspapers started to publish stories on German atrocities. The British press, \\"quality\\" and tabloid alike, showed less interest in the \\"endless inventory of stolen property and requisitioned goods\\" that constituted the bulk of the official Belgian Reports. Instead, accounts of rape and bizarre mutilations flooded the British press. The intellectual discourse on the \\"scrap of paper\\" was then mixed with the more graphic imagery depicting Belgium as a brutalized woman, exemplified by the cartoons of Louis Raemaekers, whose works were widely syndicated in the US. Part of the press, such as the editor of The Times and Edward Tyas Cook, expressed concerns that haphazard stories, a few of which were proven as outright fabrications, would weaken the powerful imagery, and asked for a more structured approach. The German and American press questioned the veracity of many stories, and the fact that the British Press Bureau did not censor the stories put the British government in a delicate position. The Bryce Committee was eventually appointed in December 1914 to investigate. Bryce was considered highly suitable to lead the effort because of his prewar pro-German attitudes and his good reputation in the United States, where he had served as Britain's ambassador, as well as his legal expertise. World War I, US propaganda posterBooks.google.com, Slater, Tom, Dixey, Marsh and Halperin, James L, Political and Americana Memorabilia Auction, Heritage Auctions, Inc, 2005. p. 317. , Poster is by Ellsworth Young The commission's investigative efforts were, however, limited to previously recorded testimonies. Gullace argues that \\"the commission was in essence called upon to conduct a mock inquiry that would substitute the good name of Lord Bryce for the thousands of missing names of the anonymous victims whose stories appeared in the pages of the report\\". The commission published its report in May 1915. Charles Masterman, the director of the British War Propaganda Bureau, wrote to Bryce: \\"Your report has swept America. As you probably know even the most skeptical declare themselves converted, just because it is signed by you!\\" Translated in ten languages by June, the report was the basis for much subsequent wartime propaganda and was used as a sourcebook for many other publications, ensuring that the atrocities became a leitmotif of the war's propaganda up to the final \\"Hang the Kaiser\\" campaign. For example, in 1917 Arnold J. Toynbee published The German Terror in Belgium, which emphasized the most graphic accounts of \\"authentic\\" German sexual depravity, such as: \\"In the market-place of Gembloux a Belgian despatch-rider saw the body of a woman pinned to the door of a house by a sword driven through her chest. The body was naked and the breasts had been cut off.\\" Much of the wartime publishing in Britain was in fact aimed at attracting American support. A 1929 article in The Nation asserted: \\"In 1916 the Allies were putting forth every possible atrocity story to win neutral sympathy and American support. We were fed every day [...] stories of Belgian children whose hands were cut off, the Canadian soldier who was crucified to a barn door, the nurses whose breasts were cut off, the German habit of distilling glycerine and fat from their dead in order to obtain lubricants; and all the rest.\\" The fourth Liberty bond drive of 1918 employed a \\"Remember Belgium\\" poster depicting the silhouette of a young Belgian girl being dragged by a German soldier on the background of a burning village; historian Kimberly Jensen interprets this imagery as \\"They are alone in the night, and rape seems imminent. The poster demonstrates that leaders drew on the American public's knowledge of and assumptions about the use of rape in the German invasion of Belgium.\\" In his book Roosevelt and Hitler, Robert E. Herzstein stated that \\"The Germans could not seem to find a way to counteract powerful British propaganda about the 'Rape of Belgium' and other alleged atrocities\\".\\"Herzstein, Robert E., Roosevelt & Hitler, p. 8 About the legacy of the propaganda, Gullace commented that \\"one of the tragedies of the British effort to manufacture truth is the way authentic suffering was rendered suspect by fabricated tales\\". Aftermath =Later analysis= A relic of the Great War in Bonnington, Edinburgh. It depicts women being assaulted by soldiers In the 1920s, the war crimes of August 1914 were often dismissed as British propaganda. In recent years numerous scholars have examined the original documents and concluded that large-scale atrocities did occur, while acknowledging that other stories were fabrications.Horne and Kramer, (1994). There is a debate between those who believe the German army acted primarily out of paranoia, in retaliation for real or believed incidents involving resistance actions by Belgian civilians, and those (including Lipkes) who emphasize additional causes, suggesting an association with German actions in the Nazi era. According to Larry Zuckerman, the German occupation far exceeded the constraints international law imposed on an occupying power. A heavy- handed German military administration sought to regulate every detail of daily life, both on a personal level with travel restraints and collective punishment, and on the economic level by harnessing the Belgian industry to German advantage and by levying repeated massive indemnities on the Belgian provinces. Before the war Belgium produced 4.4 percent of world commerce, but the Germans destroyed the Belgian economy so thoroughly, by dismantling industries and transporting the equipment and machinery to Germany, that it never regained its pre-war level. More than 100,000 Belgian workers were forcibly deported to Germany to work in the war economy, and to Northern France to build roads and other military infrastructure for the German army. =Historical studies= Recent in-depth historical studies of German acts in Belgium include: * The Rape of Belgium: The Untold Story of World War I by Larry Zuckerman * Rehearsals: The German Army in Belgium, August 1914 by Jeff Lipkes * German Atrocities 1914: A History of Denial by John Horne and Alan Kramer.See Summary of book Horne and Kramer describe some of the motivations for German tactics, chiefly (but not only), the collective fear of a \\"People's War\\": The same authors identify a number of contributory factors: * inexperience leading to lack of discipline amongst German soldiers * drunkenness * 'friendly fire' incidents arising from panic * frequent collisions with Belgian and French rearguards leading to confusion * rage at the stubborn and at first successful defense of Li√®ge during the Battle of Li√®ge * rage at Belgian resistance at all, not seen as a people entitled to defend themselves * prevailing almost hatred of the Roman Catholic clergy in Belgium and France *ambiguous or inadequate German field service regulations regarding civilians * failure of German logistics later leading to uncontrolled looting =Legacy= At a commemoration ceremony on May 6, 2001 in the Belgian town of Dinant, attended by Belgium's defense minister Andre Flahaut, World War II veterans, and the ambassadors of Germany, France and Britain, state secretary of the German Ministry of Defence, Walter Kolbow, officially apologized for a massacre of 674 civilians that took place on August 23, 1914 in the aftermath of the Battle of Dinant: Mr Kolbow placed a wreath and bowed before a monument to the victims bearing the inscription: To the 674 Dinantais martyrs, innocent victims of German barbarism.Clive Emsley, War, Culture and Memory, The Open University, Milton Keynes, 2003, p. 28.

New members of the Governing Body are selected by existing members. History Since its incorporation in 1884, the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania has been directed by a president and board of directors. Until January 1976, the president exercised complete control of doctrines, publications and activities of the Watch Tower Society and the religious denominations with which it was connected--the Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses. When the Society's second president, J. F. Rutherford, encountered opposition from directors in 1917, he dismissed them. In 1925 he overruled the Watch Tower Society's editorial committee when it opposed publication of an article about disputed doctrines regarding the year 1914. In 1931, the editorial committee was dissolved. In 1943 The Watchtower described the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society as the \\"legal governing body\\" of anointed Jehovah's Witnesses. A year later, in an article opposing the democratic election of congregation elders, the magazine said the appointment of such ones was the duty of \\"a visible governing body under Jehovah God and his Christ.\\" For several years, the role and specific identity of the governing body remained otherwise undefined. A 1955 organizational handbook stated that \\"the visible governing body has been closely identified with the board of directors of this corporation.\\" cited by Raymond Franz, Crisis of Conscience, page 74 Referring to events related to their 1957 convention, a 1959 publication said \\"the spiritual governing body of Jehovah‚Äôs witnesses watched the developments [then] the president of the Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society [acted].\\" The 1970 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses noted that the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania was the organization used to plan the activity of Jehovah's Witnesses and provide them with \\"spiritual food\\", then declared: \\"So really the governing body of Jehovah's Witnesses is the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.\\" Frederick Franz at Watch Tower Society headquarters in Brooklyn. On October 1, 1971, Watch Tower Society vice-president Frederick Franz addressed the annual meeting of the Pennsylvania corporation in Buckingham, Pennsylvania, stating that the legal corporation of the Watch Tower Society was an \\"agency\\" or \\"temporary instrument\\" used by the Governing Body on behalf of the \\"faithful and discreet slave\\". Three weeks later, on October 20, four additional men joined the seven members of the Society's board of directors on what became known as a separate, expanded Governing Body. The seven directors at October 20 were Nathan Knorr, Fred Franz, Grant Suiter, Thomas Sullivan, Milton Henschel, Lyman Swingle and John Groh. The additional four to form the Governing Body were William Jackson, Leo Greenlees, George Gangas and Raymond Franz. The board of directors had until then met only sporadically, usually to discuss the purchase of property or new equipment, leaving decisions about Watch Tower Society literature to the president and vice-president, Nathan Knorr and Fred Franz.Testimony by Fred Franz, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh Transcript, Lord Strachan vs. Douglas Walsh, 1954, as cited by Raymond Franz, Crisis of Conscience, 2007, page 75-76. The Watchtower of December 15, 1971 was the first to unambiguously capitalize the term \\"Governing Body of Jehovah's witnesses\\" as the defined group leading the denomination, with a series of articles explaining its role and its relationship with the Watch Tower Society. The focus on the new concept of \\"theocratic\\" leadership was accompanied by statements that the structure was not actually new: The Watch Tower declared that \\"a governing body made its appearance\\" some time after the formation of Zion's Watch Tower Society in 1884, though it had not been referred to as such at the time. The article stated that Watch Tower Society president Charles Taze Russell had been a member of the governing body. The 1972 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses stated that following Rutherford's death in 1942 \\"one of the first things that the governing body decided upon was the inauguration of the Theocratic Ministry School\\" and added that the \\"governing body\\" had published millions of books and Bibles in the previous thirty years. Former member of the Governing Body, Raymond Franz, stated that the actions of presidents Russell, Rutherford and Knorr in overriding and failing to consult with directors proved the Bible Students and Jehovah's Witnesses had been under a monarchical rule until 1976, leaving no decisions to any \\"governing body\\". In 1972, a Question From Readers article in The Watchtower further reinforced the concept of the \\"Governing Body\\"; the magazine said the term referred to an agency that administers policy and provides organizational direction, guidance and regulation and was therefore \\"appropriate, fitting and Scriptural.\\" Organizational changes at the highest levels of the Watch Tower Society in 1976 significantly increased the powers and authority of the Governing Body. The body has never had a legal corporate existence and operates through the Watch Tower Society and its board of directors. =Reorganization= After its formal establishment in 1971, the Governing Body met regularly but, according to Raymond Franz, only briefly; Franz claims meetings were sometimes as short as seven minutes, to make decisions about branch appointments and conduct that should be considered disfellowshipping offenses. Franz claims that in 1971 and again in 1975, the Governing Body debated the extent of the authority it should be given. The Governing Body voted in December 1975 to establish six operating committees to oversee the various administrative requirements of the organization's worldwide activities that formerly had been under the direction of the president; furthermore, each branch overseer was to be replaced by a branch committee of at least three members. The change, which took effect on January 1, 1976, was described in the Watch Tower Society's 1993 history book, Jehovah's Witnesses--Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, as \\"one of the most significant organizational readjustments in the modern-day history of Jehovah's Witnesses.\\" =Headquarters purge= In 1980, dissent arose among members of the Governing Body regarding the significance of 1914 in Jehovah's Witnesses' doctrines. According to former Witnesses James Penton and Heather and Gary Botting, internal dissatisfaction with official doctrines continued to grow, leading to a series of secret investigations and judicial hearings. Consequently, dissenting members were expelled from the Brooklyn headquarters staff in the same year. Raymond Franz claimed he was forced to resign from the Governing Body, and he was later disfellowshipped from the group. The Watch Tower Society responded to the dissent with a more severe attitude regarding the treatment of expelled Witnesses. In his 1997 study of the denomination, Penton concluded that since Raymond Franz's expulsion in 1980, the Governing Body displayed an increased level of conservatism, sturdy resistance to changes of policy and doctrines, and an increased tendency to isolate dissidents within the organization by means of disfellowshipping. =Helpers= The April 15, 1992 issue of The Watchtower carried an article entitled Jehovah‚Äôs Provision, the ‚ÄúGiven Ones‚Äù which drew a parallel between ancient non-Israelites who had been assigned temple duties (the \\"Nethinim\\" and \\"sons of the servants of Solomon\\") and Witness elders in positions of responsibility immediately under the oversight of the Governing Body who did not profess to be \\"anointed\\". Both that issue of The Watchtower and the 1993 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses carried the same announcement: > In view of the tremendous increase worldwide, it seems appropriate at this > time to provide the Governing Body with some additional assistance. > Therefore it has been decided to invite several helpers, mainly from among > the great crowd, to share in the meetings of each of the Governing Body > Committees, that is, the Personnel, Publishing, Service, Teaching, and > Writing Committees. Thus, the number attending the meetings of each of these > committees will be increased to seven or eight. Under the direction of the > Governing Body committee members, these assistants will take part in > discussions and will carry out various assignments given them by the > committee. This new arrangement goes into effect May 1, 1992. For many years > now, the number of the remnant of anointed Witnesses has been decreasing, > while the number of the great crowd has increased beyond our grandest > expectations. Each of the current Governing Body members served as a committee \\"helper\\" before being appointed to the Governing Body itself. The appointment of helpers to the Governing Body committees was described in 2006 as \\"still another refinement.\\" =2000 and beyond= Until 2000, the directors and officers of the Watch Tower Society were members of the Governing Body. Since then, members of the ecclesiastical Governing Body have not served as directors of any of the various corporations used by Jehovah's Witnesses, and the Governing Body has delegated such administrative responsibilities to other members of the group. Committees The Governing Body functions by means of its six committees, which carry out various administrative functions. Each committee is assisted by \\"helpers,\\" who do not necessarily profess to be \\"anointed\\". Governing Body meetings are held weekly in closed session. According to Raymond Franz, decisions of the body were required to be unanimous until 1975, after which a two-thirds majority of the full body was required, regardless of the number present. * The Personnel Committee arranges for volunteers to serve in the organization's headquarters and worldwide branch offices, which are each referred to as Bethel (from a Hebrew term meaning house of God). It oversees arrangements for the personal and spiritual assistance of Bethel staff, as well as the selection and invitation of new Bethel members. * The Publishing Committee supervises the printing, publishing and shipping of literature, as well as legal matters involved in printing, such as obtaining property for printing facilities. It is responsible for overseeing factories, properties, and financial operations of corporations used by Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses. * The Service Committee supervises the evangelical activity of Jehovah's Witnesses, which includes traveling overseers, pioneers, and the activities of congregation publishers. It oversees communication between the international headquarters, branch offices, and the congregations. It examines annual reports of preaching activity from the branches. It is responsible for inviting members to attend the Gilead school, the Bible School for Single Brothers, and the Traveling Overseers‚Äô School, and for assigning graduates of these schools to their places of service. * The Teaching Committee arranges congregation meetings, circuit assemblies, and regional and international conventions as well as various schools for elders, ministerial servants, pioneers and missionaries, such as Gilead school. It supervises preparation of material to be used in teaching, and oversees the development of new audio and video programs. * The Writing Committee supervises the writing and translation of all material published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society, including scripts for dramas and talk outlines. It responds to questions about scriptural, doctrinal, and moral issues, specific problems in the congregations, and the standing of members in congregations. * The Coordinator's Committee deals with emergencies, disaster relief and other matters, such as investigations. It comprises the coordinators, or a representative, from each of the other Governing Body committees and a secretary who is also a member of the Governing Body. It is responsible for the efficient operation of the other committees. Representatives Initially, the Governing Body directly appointed all congregation elders. By 1975, the appointment of elders and ministerial servants was said to be \\"made directly by a governing body of spirit-anointed elders or by them through other elders representing this body.\\" In 2001, The Watchtower, stated that recommendations for such appointments were submitted to branch offices. As of September 2014, circuit overseers appoint elders and ministerial servants after discussion with congregation elders, without consulting with the branch office. The Governing Body continues to directly appoint branch office committee members and traveling overseers, and only such direct appointees are described as \\"representatives of the Governing Body.\\" Relationship with \\"faithful and discreet slave\\" The Governing Body is said to provide \\"spiritual food\\" for Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.Gov. Body as \\"Faithful & Discreet Slave\\" is explained in 8 minute clip. Until late 2012, the Governing Body described itself as the representative and \\"spokesman\\" for God's \\"faithful and discreet slave class\\" (Jehovah's Witnesses who profess to be anointed) who are collectively said to be God's \\"prophet\\" and \\"channel for new spiritual light\\".\\"The Things Revealed Belong to Us\\", The Watchtower, May 15, 1986, page 13. The Governing Body does not consult with the other anointed Witnesses whom it was said to represent when formulating policy and doctrines or approving material for publications and conventions; the authority of the Governing Body was presumed to be analogous to that of the older men of Jerusalem in cases such as the first-century circumcision issue. The majority of Witnesses who profess to be anointed have no authority to contribute to the development or change of doctrines. Anointed Witnesses are instructed to remain modest and avoid \\"wildly speculating about things that are still unclear,\\" instead waiting for God to reveal his purposes in The Watchtower. In 2009, The Watchtower indicated that the dissemination of \\"new spiritual light\\" is the responsibility of only \\"a limited number\\" of the \\"slave class\\", asking: \\"Are all these anointed ones throughout the earth part of a global network that is somehow involved in revealing new spiritual truths? No.\\" In 2010 the society said that \\"deep truths\\" were discerned by \\"responsible representatives\\" of the \\"faithful and discreet slave class\\" at the group's headquarters, and then considered by the entire Governing Body before making doctrinal decisions. In August 2011, the Governing Body stated that \\"we have no way of knowing the exact number of anointed ones on earth; nor do we need to know\\", and that it \\"does not maintain a global network of anointed ones.\\" At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society, the \\"faithful and discreet slave\\" was redefined as referring to the Governing Body only and the terms are now synonymous.

It is owned by the University of Southern California and airs a classical music format, simulcasting KDFC in San Francisco. KXSC broadcasts in HD. HD Radio Guide for San Jose KXSC (AM) is, somewhat confusingly, also the call sign of the University of Southern California's student-run radio station,KXSC (AM) which airs a traditional college radio format and is broadcast online, as well as via 1560 AM in the Los Angeles area.  History  KXSC (104.9 FM) began in 1961 as KHYD, a 3,000-watt station operating from a house on Mowry Avenue in Fremont, California. The station call letters changed to KFMR in 1964. 18-year-old Bill Stairs was among the alumni of early days of KFMR who went on to a career as a DJ, program director and broadcast consultant in markets from Spokane, Sacramento and San Diego in the west to Boston and Chicago in the east. Another early DJ at KFMR was writer Timothy Perrin, winner of the 2007 Angie Award for best screenplay. Under new ownership in the early 1980s, KFMR changed to a religious format. In 1983, it became Spanish-language KDOS. By December 1983, the station adopted KBRG, call letters that had been abandoned by another station earlier that year. The station continued the Spanish-language music and variety format, and the Oakland Athletics baseball games in Spanish, with Amaury Pi-Gonzales as announcer. The station was still licensed to Fremont, California. On December 31, 1997, in a three-station frequency swap, KBRG moved to 100.3 and 104.9 became KUFX. In August 1998, the station's owners (Jacor) changed the format to modern adult contemporary and the call letters to KLDZ. Six months later, the format and call letters were changed to new wave music/alternative rock classics KCNL, which was switched to alternative rock on January 15, 2001. KCNL's call letters were briefly changed to KMJO on October 14, 2005, and changed back to KCNL ten days later, though there was no format change involved. It was likely that Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), the owners at the time, wanted to park the KMJO call letters temporarily. On January 1, 2006, KCNL dropped alternative rock and flipped to Spanish. It was named \\"La Rom√°ntica\\" for a couple of months, but was later renamed \\"Enamorada 104.9\\". Ratings for the station had dropped from a 3.4 share to a 1.3 share during that time. Because of this, KCNL announced the return of the alternative rock format in late February 2007. The station relaunched on February 28, 2007, with \\"Beautiful Day\\" by U2 as the first song in the resurrected Channel 104.9 format. After 11 months without airstaff, on January 22, 2008, \\"Joe\\" returned to host afternoons. On September 18, 2009, KCNL switched to the \\"La Preciosa\\" Spanish-adult hits format. On March 2, 2010, Clear Channel Communications sold the station to Principle Broadcasting Network (San Jose, California) for $5 million. KCNL changed to the \\"iFM\\" Spanish-language variety format. On Saturday and Sunday nights from 8 pm to midnight, KCNL aired \\"Save Alternative,\\" which also aired 24 hours a day on an HD2 channel and online at www.savealternative.com. According to Radio Survivor, on March 30, 2012, Principle Broadcasting Network sold KCNL to the University of Southern California for $7.5 million. On May 2, 2012, it was announced that the Spanish-language format would end on Memorial Day (May 28), 2012. On May 20, 2012, \\"Save Alternative\\" ceased broadcasting on KCNL-HD2. On May 25, 2012, the call letters were changed to KXSC and the format to classical music, broadcasting programming from KDFC to the South Bay and the Peninsula areas. The change took place three days earlier than originally planned.  Additional frequencies  In addition to KXSC, the programming of KDFC is transmitted by these stations and translators to widen its broadcast area. * KDFC ‚Äî 90.3 FM, licensed to San Francisco, California * KOSC ‚Äî 89.9 FM, licensed to Angwin, California * KDFG ‚Äî 103.9 FM, licensed to Seaside, California * K212AA ‚Äî 90.3 FM, licensed to Los Gatos, California * K223AJ ‚Äî 92.5 FM, licensed to Lakeport, California References  External links  * Classical 90.3 KDFC website  The Enamorada KCNL Home Page, as of April 2, 2006 from Internet Archive * ‚ÄúChannel 104.9‚Äù KCNL changes from Alternative Classics to Alternative XSC Category:Radio stations established in 1961 Category:Sunnyvale, California Category:Classical music radio stations in the United States Category:Mass media in San Jose, California ","title":"KXSC (FM)"},{"id":"3613456","text":"MSN Games (also known as Zone.com - formerly known as The Village, Internet Gaming Zone, MSN Gaming Zone, and MSN Games by Zone.com) is a casual gaming web site, with single player, multiplayer, PC download, and social casino video games. Games are available in free online, trial, and full feature pay- to-play versions. MSN Games is a part of Xbox Game Studios, associated with the MSN portal, and is owned by Microsoft, headquartered in Redmond, Washington.  History  The first version of the site, which was then called \\"The Village\\", was founded by Kevin Binkley, Ted Griggs, and Hoon Im. In 1996, Steve Murch, a then-employee of Microsoft, convinced Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer to acquire the small online game site, then owned by Electric Gravity. The site was rebranded to \\"Internet Gaming Zone\\" and launched in 1996. It started with a handful of card and board games like Hearts, Spades, Checkers, Backgammon, and Bridge. For the following 5 years, the Internet Gaming Zone would be renamed several times and would increase in popularity with the introduction of popular retail- and MMORPG-games, such as UltraCorps, Age of Empires, Asheron's Call and Fighter Ace. The website also featured a community forum which was set-up in 2006. This lasted until the closure of MSN Groups in 2009. Microsoft announced in July 2019, it would be shuttering the MSN Games. For Windows XP and ME games, these would be shut down on July 31, 2019, while the remaining games on Windows 7 would be shut down January 22, 2020 (a little over a week after Microsoft ceased support for Windows 7).  Competitors  The Zone's first competitors were AOL's Games.com, as well Mplayer.com (and its successor Gamespy), Pogo.com and Sega's Heat.net. Formerly, the site competed with other similar free-game sites, such as Yahoo! Games and msngames.org.  Volunteers  MSN's competition with AOL Games resulted in the creation of a Volunteer Program for the Zone, which AOL also offered. The idea was to have volunteers moderating chat lobbies, hosting tourneys, offering tech support, and interacting with the gamers to collect general feedback. Volunteer Moderators for the Zone were initially designated as members of the \\"Zone Team\\", or zTeam, with assorted tokens assigned to five different teams: the Gaming Team (!), Helproom Team (+), Tournament Hosting Team (%), zStar Team (*), and Tech Support Team (?). Because of legal complexities when AOL was sued by their volunteers--and the volunteers won the case--MSN Games reformed their policy by contracting a third-party company to manage the program. In 2001, Participate Systems won the contract and would continue to lead the program until its official disbanding. During the volunteer program's conversion to its new management, all previous token designations were replaced with a single \\"+\\" token and a new name, the \\"Member Plus\\", or MPlus program. Participate Systems was acquired by Outstart.com in November 2004. The Zone sanctioned a number of independent groups to operate tournaments on the Zone, subject to the groups retaining a tokened tournament director and obeying the Zone Code of Conduct. Groups operatedgames in a number of games, including backgammon, cribbage, chess, hearts, and others. Some of these groups (for example RTW Online's Thunder and MrFixitOnline's Smackdown series of tournaments in the Age of Empires series of games) created an intense following, and the associated intercine rivalries. A few, such as GammonZone and Warpgammon (backgammon) and Pegging Pals (cribbage) even survived the demise of the Zone and migrated to other servers. Citing MSN's statement regarding the closure of CD-ROM games on the Zone on June 19, 2006, the Member Plus program was also disbanded at that time, due to the removal of chat capabilities from game lobbies and the end of support for the ZoneFriends client.  Setbacks  * In 2000, the site started to be a target of continuous crack attacks. Crackers, script kiddies for the most part, targeted the Zone software. In 2004, the worst crack attack occurred through the use of social engineering, giving the intruders access to the administrator tools. The intruders used their new-found tools to ban players and other site volunteers. * After the dot-com boom, web sites claimed difficulties managing their finances. MSN Games changed its market strategy and left the retail market to focus solely on free and premium games, a decision that finally culminated in their decision to retire support for CD-ROM games and lobbies on June 19, 2006. * Specialized programs, including the Fighter Ace and Allegiance teams, disbanded during the Zone's transition to the Member Plus program, due primarily to the planned retirement of their associated games.  Legacy  * Personalities such as Bill Gates and his friend, Warren Buffett, have played bridge on the Zone. Garry Kasparov, chess champion, played in a chess game organized by Microsoft. World champion Alex Moiseyev and grandmaster Tim Laverty also played checkers on Zone. The Sheik of The United Arab Emirates invited a few backgammon players from the Zone to play in his \\"2nd annual Abu Dhabi Backgammon Championship\\". Many of the \\"Giants of Backgammon\\" (top 32 in the world) participated in Zone tournaments, including Neil Kazaross, Johannes Levermann, Steve Sax, Howard Ring, Paul Weaver, Kit Woolsey, and Bill Robertie. * MSN Games is credited for assisting with the introduction of new games on Windows Live Messenger (formerly called MSN Messenger) and the development of Xbox Live Arcade. * Writer Dorothy Rosencrans wrote a book about her experiences at MSN Games and her encounter with Bill Gates. * MSN Games is credited with renaming DiamondMine to Bejeweled, which is one of the most popular casual games of all time. * Members Plus originally utilized a Microsoft-authored program called ZoneCommander to access lobbies directly, bypassing web pages. This was later replaced by ZoneOrchestrator, a program written by two Members Plus which improved upon ZoneCommander by adding chat monitoring facilities and an enhanced user interface. Some years later, ZoneCommander was retired in favor of ZoneOrchestrator, which became the official tool of choice and remained so until the lobbies closed on June 19, 2006.  Controversy  MSN Games announced in early 2006 the retiring of support for all lobby-based CD-ROM games, chat lobbies, the ZoneFriends client and the Member Plus program, scheduled for June 19, 2006: > \\"...as of June 19, 2006, we will be retiring our CD-ROM matchmaking service, > along with the original versions of several classic card and board games: > Classic Backgammon, Bridge, Classic Checkers, Chess, Cribbage, Euchre, Go, > Classic Hearts, Reversi, and Spades. We‚Äôll be sad to see them go! These > games are like old friends: they gave us our start, and helped us grow from > an innovative little entertainment site to a truly stellar online gaming > experience. But over the years, it‚Äôs become more and more difficult to > maintain the aging hardware and software that supports them. We held out > absolutely as long as we could, but it was finally time to make that > decision.\\" In a series of public chats held with various administrators and developers of the Zone, MSN outlined its plan to shift its gaming environment into Windows Live Messenger, a more frequently updated client than the outdated ZoneFriends messenger used on the Zone. However, due primarily to MSN's inability to provide a timeframe for the expected replacement of chat lobbies, tournaments, and its Member Plus volunteer moderator program, thousands of players appeared at each session to express their discontent, and began an online petition in an attempt to stop MSN's scheduled changes. As with previous changes, however, MSN has continued to stand firm in its commitment to the retirement of its services, citing outdated hardware and lack of economic viability for the old products. Although alternatives exist to the Zone for CD-ROM gameplay, many Microsoft game studios embedded Zone links and functionality into their games, including Rockstar San Diego' Midtown Madness and Ensemble Studios' Age of Empires game series. Ensemble only began their switch to an in-game matchmaking system with the release of Age of Mythology. Games as recent as Flight Simulator 98 and Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds utilized the Zone's lobby system for matchmaking. For many such games, no replacement service has been announced. The first game in the Flight Simulator series to use in-game matchmaking is Flight Simulator X, released early 2007, leaving a gap of several months without MSN supported matchmaking services.

The Ngapara Branch opened in 1877 and almost all of it closed in 1959; the remaining few kilometres, called the Waiareka Industrial Line, were removed in 1997. The Tokarahi Branch branched off the Ngapara Branch. It operated from 1887 until 1930 and was originally known as the Livingstone Branch, though it never progressed beyond Tokarahi to Livingstone. In early 2008 there is a proposal to reinstate the first 4.5 km of the Ngapara Branch. Construction In the early 1870s, residents in the Waiareka Valley inland from Oamaru started petitioning for a railway connection to the coast to provide easier access to farmland and to export agricultural produce and limestone. The provincial government granted approval for a line to Ngapara in 1872, with construction commencing during the first half of 1874. The Public Works Department began running trains on the line during 1876, but construction was hampered by delays and other problems, including an incident in May 1876 when two died after a contractor's locomotive exploded. On 1 April 1877 the 24.34-kilometre line from Waiareka Junction on the Main South Line opened to Ngapara. The junction points faced south, away from Oamaru, because north-facing points would have required an excessively sharp curve. In June 1879, construction of a side branch from Windsor Junction on the Ngapara Branch to Tokarahi began, and through the economic depression of the 1880s building the line was used to provide unemployment relief. The 19.22-kilometre line opened on 8 July 1887. There were proposals that the two branches be extended to join the Kurow Branch, but they were abandoned without any progress made. Stations The following stations were on the Ngapara Branch (in brackets is the distance from Waiareka Junction):John Yonge (editor), New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, 4th edition (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 27. * Weston (2.58 km) - site of McDonald Limeworks. * Siding to Taylor's Limeworks (4.6 km). * Cornacks (4.74 km) - the original Cornacks Loop was 300 m closer to Weston. * Lorne (6.4 km) - loop removed in 1949. * Enfield (8.43 km) - originally known as Teaneraki. * Elderslie (11.93 km) * Windsor Junction (16.52 km) - originally Windsor before the construction of the Tokarahi Branch; remained Windsor Junction even after it ceased to be a junction. * Corriedale (18 km) * Queens Flat (21.48 km) * Ngapara (24.34 km) Tokarahi Branch, distances from Windsor Junction on the Ngapara Branch: * Tapui (?? km) * Island Cliff (?? km) * Tokarahi (19.22 km) Operation Once the Tokarahi Branch opened, the two lines employed some inventive working. Each morning mixed trains from the two termini met at Windsor Junction, where they were marshalled into a passenger train to Oamaru and a slower goods train. The reverse of this took place in the afternoon. Although the two branches were set up to open up country and provide transport for farmland, the freight on the line was not purely agricultural: a coal mine and, at the turn of the 20th century, a flour mill were located in Ngapara, and limestone for both building blocks and agricultural uses was loaded from quarries along the line. Enfield had a ballast pit until the late 1940s or early 1950s, used to supply materials for the protection of Oamaru's foreshore. In the early days, motive power included the FA class, which were stationed in Ngapara and were known to haul the passenger train from Windsor Junction to Oamaru prior to 1918. Other classes utilised included the P, T, UB, UC, WD, and WF. T class are known to have operated to Tokarahi into the 1920s. The Ngapara and Tokarahi Branches were some of the first in the country to lose their passenger services, in December 1926, when buses replaced trains in an attempt to stem increasing financial losses. In 1927, Ngapara's locomotive depot closed and trains operated from Oamaru. The Tokarahi Branch closed on 14 July 1930. This was due at least in part to the decline in wheat farming; at the start of the 20th century, thousands of acres of the crop were grown in the region, but by the 1920s it was no longer a significant commodity. After the closure of the Tokarahi Branch, freight trains ran thrice weekly to Ngapara, typically on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. They departed Oamaru at 7:30am and arrived at Ngapara at 9:40am. The return working departed Ngapara at 10:30am, reaching Oamaru at 1:30pm. By 1951 trains ran on Tuesdays and Thursdays, except for services to the limeworks 4.74 kilometres from the junction with the main line, which provided a few hundred tonnes of freight daily. In 1958, regular services were cancelled and trains ran only when required, restricted to 10 km/h due to the poor condition of the track. Financial losses and the prohibitive cost of repairs meant that closure of the line past the limeworks came on 31 July 1959; despite local protests to keep the line open, the final train departed Ngapara behind AB 783\\\\. This class and the A were the mainstay of motive power on the branch for its final 25 years. The remainder of the branch, known from August 1959 as Taylor's Siding after the business it served, Taylor's Limeworks, continued to provide traffic until 1997, when the siding closed. The track was lifted in 1999. The branches today Traces of the Ngapara and Tokarahi Branches survive remarkably well. The old formation is often very distinct: rails are still embedded into the road surface at Weston, the Enfield station building and goods shed have been moved into a paddock and are in good repair, Corriedale yard is well preserved with the 11-mile peg still in place, and both Tokarahi branch tunnels survive, on private land. In Tokarahi very little remains of the terminus, but in Ngarapa some rails remain embedded in tar seal where the backshunt crossed the highway, the loading bank and platform edge survive, and the old station sign is affixed to the local rugby club's rooms. The old flour mill that once provided traffic for the railway is also still present in the town. Since 2008 there has been an annual \\"Over The Tunnels\\" recreational run/ride of the Tokarahi Branch organised by Waitaki Girls High School. The event consists of a half marathon and a cycle ride along the route of the line. The events have attracted hundreds of participants. Alps to Ocean Cycle Trail The final section of the Alps to Ocean cycle trail (from Duntroon to Oamaru) follows these two branchlines in places. The cycle trail follows beside the Karara Creek and intersects the Tokarahi - Windsor line at a point approx 4km from Tokarahi, and 1km from the Tokarahi-Ngapara Road. Trail, creek and railway formation run roughly parallel for a kilometre before creek and trail diverge, although the formation can be observed for most of the next kilometre. Approximately 5km further the trail drops down Tunnel Road to the western portal of the Rakis Tunnel and follows (mostly on) the formation for six or seven kilometres to a point about 1.5km short of the junction at Windsor. After leaving Enfield (on the Ngapara Branchline) the cycle trail follows on the railway embankment for about 1km (including a significant bridge) until rejoining the Weston-Ngapara Road. The trail again follows on the railway formation from east of the lime works at McCormacks, through Weston, to a point about 200m short of the former junction with the Main South Line at Waiareka. Reinstatement proposal In August 2006 a proposal was made to reinstate the first 4.5 km of the branch.Emma Bailey, \\"Shipping Deal Possible\\", Timaru Herald, 30 August 2006. Weston is under consideration as the location for a cement works, and if chosen, the harbour in either Timaru or Port Chalmers would be used for export purposes. The company intending to establish the cement works, Holcim, has stated a strong preference to use rail transport between the cement works and harbour and thus would seek to restore the line to Weston. The rail corridor is still owned by ONTRACK and the proposal would involve the operation of at least two trains each way daily. However, the rail corridor is designated as \\"closed\\" in the Waitaki District Council's district plan. ONTRACK asserts this is a clerical error and has filed with the Environment Court in September 2007 to have the status corrected so that the railway can be reinstated. The Waiareka Valley Preservation Society (WVPS), whose existence is premised upon opposition to Holcim's proposal, has challenged ONTRACK and filed with the Environment Court to have the railway's reinstatement declared to be in contravention of the Resource Management Act. If the railway cannot be reinstated it may jeopardise the Holcim proposal as access to rail transport is crucial to transport the cement. On 2 November 2007 the case went before the Environment Court, and Judge Jeff Smith and commissioner Sheila Watson reserved their decision and the matter may not be resolved before Christmas 2007. The Commissioners granted a consent for the cement works on 11 February 2008, but this was challenged by the WVPS, who sub sequentially won an appeal in the Environment Court, requiring the re-opening of the branch line to be notified. As of December 2009 the cement works project remains under consideration. A decision on the cement works proposal is expected to occur in August or September 2010. If the project goes ahead, a sand quarry will be established at Windsor, directly adjacent to the old Tokarahi Branch, with access along the old railway formation. There will also be an opencast coal mine at Ngapara, while the cement works and limestone quarry will be built close to the former Taylors limeworks at Cormacks References = Bibliography =  Hermann, Bruce J; South Island Branch Lines p 25 (1997, New Zealand Railway & Locomotive Society, Wellington) * External links *Branch lines with modelling potential: Ngapara - contains a map of the line and a brief history. * Category:Railway lines in New Zealand Category:Rail transport in Otago Category:Railway lines opened in 1877 Category:Railway lines closed in 1959 Category:Closed railway lines in New Zealand ","title":"Ngapara and Tokarahi Branches"},{"id":"3613472","text":"Neville Anthony Quinn (21 February 1908 ‚Äì 5 August 1934) was a cricketer who played in 12 Test matches for South Africa from 1929 to 1931‚Äì32. Early cricket career A left-handed lower-order batsman and a left-arm medium fast bowler, Quinn played first-class cricket for Griqualand West from 1927‚Äì28. The following season, in only his third first-class game, he took eight Border first-innings wickets for 37 runs, and this remained his best innings bowling performance. He followed that with six for 19 in 24 overs against Transvaal in the next match, and that secured his place on the 1929 South African tour to England. Tour to England He made his Test debut on the tour to England in 1929. He found the bowling conditions of a dry English summer suited his swing bowling, and played in four of the five Tests. He took 6‚Äì92 in England's first innings in the Third Test at Headingley, the only 5-wicket haul in his short Test career, and came second in the tourists' bowling averages behind Tuppy Owen-Smith. Quinn played in one Test of the series at home against England in 1930‚Äì31, the drawn Third Test at Durban which was dominated by the English bowlers, and then toured to Australia and New Zealand in 1931‚Äì32, also finishing second in the tourists' bowling averages, this time behind Sandy Bell. He dismissed Donald Bradman for only 2 in the Third Test in Melbourne, the only time Bradman was out for less than 100 in that series. Bradman wrote later: \\"In the First Test, Neville Quinn ... had me sorely puzzled, and I was missed off him twice in my innings, then went on to make 226 ... Quinn worried me more than any of their bowlers, and appeared to come off the pitch faster than any medium fast bowler I have met in this country with the possible exception of Maurice Tate.\\"Don Bradman, Farewell to Cricket, Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1950, pp. 48, 49.

Most frequently made of silver, jade or bakelite (popular in the past but now wholly replaced by modern plastics), cigarette holders were considered an essential part of ladies' fashion from the early 1910s through early to the mid 1970s. Purpose The holder was also a practical accessory and served several purposes: * The primary use was to keep falling ash off a woman's clothes, especially since women didn't wear smoking jackets. This is the reason for the long length, and for why the holders were longer for more formal occasions (which usually had more elaborate dress). * Kept side-stream smoke further from the smokers' eyes and out from under the ladies' hat (which often had wider brims than men's hats). * Helped prevent nicotine staining of the fingers and gloves. * Reduced staining of the teeth. * Kept the thin cigarette paper from sticking to, and tearing on, the smokers' lips. * Cooled and mellowed the smoke. * Holders sometimes encased a filter for taste and, later, for health reasons. * Before the advent of filtered cigarettes in the 1960s, the holder also helped keep tobacco flakes out of the smokers' mouth. In 1997, Philip Morris tested a new battery-powered cigarette holder that completely eliminated the smoke of the cigarette. Appearance =Materials= Cigarette holders range from the simplest single material constructs to incredibly ornate styles with complex inlays of metal and gemstones. Rarer examples of these can be found in enamel, horn, tortoiseshell, or more precious materials such as amber and ivory. A similar holder made of wood, meerschaum or bakelite and with an amber mouthpiece was used for cigars and was a popular accessory for men from the Edwardian period until the 1920s. =Size= As with evening gloves, ladies' cigarette holders are measured by four traditional formal standard lengths: * opera length, usually 16 to 20 inches/40 to 50 cm * theatre length, 10 to 14 inches/25 to 35 cm * dinner length, 4 to 6 inches/10 to 15 cm * cocktail length, which includes shorter holders Traditionally, men's cigarette holders were no more than 4 inches long.History of Men's Fashion, Nicholas Storey, 2008, p93. Notable users In Where There's Smoke There's Fire (ca. 1920s), Russell Patterson depicts a flapper whose cigarette holder is not only a fashion accessory, but an important element of the interplay of line in the drawing. Well-known women who used cigarette holders include Audrey Hepburn,\\"Audrey Hepburn: A Biography\\" Warren G. Harris, 1994 Lucille Ball, Jayne Mansfield, Jacqueline Kennedy,\\"Jackie After Jack: Portrait of the Lady\\" Christopher Anderson, 1999 Rita Hayworth, Princess Margaret,H.R.H.The Princess Margaret: A Life Unfulfilled, Nigel Dempster, 1981 Wendy Richard, Madalena Barbosa, Natalie Wood, Louise Brooks, and Ayn Rand. Scarlett Johansson is a contemporary example. Among the best-known men who used cigarette holders were Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ivor Novello, Enrico Caruso,Enrico Caruso: my father and my family, Dalton Trumbo, Enrico Caruso Jr and Andrew Farkas, 1990, page 374 Vladimir Horowitz,Vanity Fair: photographs of an age, 1914-1936, 1982, p97 Ian Fleming, No√´l Coward,Noel Coward: A Biography, Philip Hoare, 1995, p227 Hunter S. Thompson (though he regarded his as only a filter), Tennessee Williams, Fulgencio Batista, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Josip Broz Tito, and Hans von B√ºlow.  Cultural references  Holders can be seen in period films like Titanic, and are immortalised in films of the 1950s and 1960s. Holly Golightly, the na√Øve and eccentric caf√© society girl in the iconic 1961 classic Breakfast at Tiffany's who is portrayed by Audrey Hepburn, is famously seen carrying an oversized cigarette holder; the image of Hepburn wearing the famous Givenchy little black dress, with the foot-long cigarette holder in her hand, is considered one of the most iconic images of 20th century American cinema.Spoto, Donald. Enchantment: The Life of Audrey Hepburn. New York: Harmony Books, 2006. Page 203. Lucille Ball can be seen using one in certain episodes of I Love Lucy. In Troop Beverly Hills Shelly Long's character is seen throughout the movie using one. Cruella de Vil is seen using one repeatedly in the 1961 animated Disney film, One Hundred and One Dalmatians and in the 1996 remake portrayed by Glenn Close. Margo Lane (portrayed by Penelope Ann Miller) used one in The Shadow, as did Jade in Jonny Quest. Comedian Phyllis Diller had a stage persona which included holding a long cigarette holder from which she pretended to smoke (though she was a nonsmoker in real life). Fictional Peter Pan character Captain Hook possessed a unique double-holder, which allowed him to smoke two cigars (not cigarettes) at once. Batman's nemesis The Penguin also commonly uses a cigarette holder in the comics and the 1960s television series, as well as in the live-action film Batman Returns. Edna Mode from The Incredibles franchise is often seen with an unlit cigarette holder. Johnny Depp uses a cigarette holder in his role as Raoul Duke (alter ego of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson) in the film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. In cartoons, the Pink Panther, Colonel Sponsz from The Adventures of Tintin, and Jade from Jonny Quest use cigarette holders. The lyrics to Satin Doll by Duke Ellington and the cover art of the album Badfinger feature a cigarette holder. The video to Into the Great Wide Open by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers features Faye Dunaway using her cigarette holder as a magic wand. Rachel Menken, a character on the AMC series Mad Men, smokes cigarettes with a short holder.

Concept  The concept of opium replacement was first developed within an agricultural framework, most notably in Thailand. Agricultural engineers sought to identify crops that would generate more income than the opium poppy. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, rural development projects caused the terms opium replacement and opium substitution to be superseded by integrated rural development. In the 1990s, the term shifted to alternative development. This term and its minor variants are still used in Latin America (where crop-replacement approaches are used for coca). The United Nations refers to these crop replacement projects as sustainable alternative livelihoods; in Afghanistan, development agencies use the term sustainable livelihoods.  Worldwide  Opium has been grown in Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Nepal, Myanmar (formally Burma), Thailand, Laos, China, and Vietnam. It is also believed to be grown in the central post-Soviet states, including Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, Mexico (allegedly imported by immigrant Chinese opium users), and Colombia (reportedly as part of a collaboration between South-East Asian and Colombian drug traffickers). According to a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report published in the mid-2000s, large amounts of opium are only cultivated in Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Colombia. Small to intermediate amounts were produced by Laos, Mexico, and Pakistan, while Thailand and Vietnam produced negligible amounts. Of these countries, opium replacement has been implemented in Thailand, Laos, Myanmar, Vietnam, Pakistan, Mexico, and Afghanistan. In Colombia, much of the opium cultivation takes place under the protection of armed groups opposing the government, limiting the success of opium replacement attempts. Laos has experienced steep declines in cultivation, but former opium farmers are often left destitute due to the scarcity of legal, alternative crops. A similar situation had been observed in Pakistan, which is now experiencing an increase in cultivation due to over spill from Afghanistan. The opium replacement project in Afghanistan is slow, due to the large scale of cultivation, size of the country, poor security, destruction of infrastructure, and weakness of government institutions. =Myanmar= Myanmar has had some attempts at opium replacement: the United Nations has one project in the Wa State (in the north-east) and the Doi Tung project of Thailand also initiated some activities. The areas covered by such projects were too small to have a significant effect on national production. While opium production has been falling, it is attributed to Myanmar warlords new focus on methamphetamines rather than replacement projects. = Thailand = Thailand is widely considered the most successful example of opium replacement policies. Although peak production in Thailand was relatively low (150‚Äì200 tonnes annually), Thailand's approach to opium replacement is considered the broadest attempt to replace opium cultivation with cultivation of legal crops. More than 150 crops have been introduced to farmers, especially to farmers from temperate climates (suitable to growing opium). The crops include: cabbage, lettuce, kidney beans, tea, coffee, peaches, apples, herbs, and decorative flowers. In general, these crops were cash crops of medium to high value. While many are not native to Thailand, they have been integrated into Thai cooking and culture. Two particularly successful opium replacement projects are still in operation: the Royal Project (established in 1969) and the Doi Tung Project (established in 1988). Both have eliminated opium cultivation from their project areas and have helped farmers improve living conditions. They are used as models and are studied by practitioners of opium replacement from other countries. Scepticism Despite the success of Thailand and, to a lesser extent, Pakistan and Vietnam, many people claim that opium replacement is ineffective, noting that Thailand is the only \\"real\\" success, but that its success is due to unique and non-replicable factors. Development activities may cause opium cultivators to simply relocate (in what is known as the balloon effect). Despite the presence of opium replacement projects, the world's supply of illicit drugs is continually rising, while prices are falling.  Organisations  Opium replacement projects are typically implemented by national government agencies with the support of an international donor. A contractor implements the project in partnership with the national agency. At the moment, the largest providers of funding are the United States Agency for International Development and the European Union. Major contractors include the German Technical Cooperation Agency and several for-profit firms from the United States. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime helps coordinate different efforts, and also funds a few projects. Opium replacement projects are no longer planned and executed over long time frames, as was the case with Thailand's Royal Project and the Doi Tung project. Rather, they take place over two or three years.  Effectiveness  {{ {}#invoke:Unsubstdate=__DATE__ $B= }} There are three reasons why Opium Replacement was so successful in Doi Tung of Thailand. One is that Alternative Development (AD) was preceded by violent intimidation of people living in North Thailand. (Ref: Race, Jeffrey, (1974), The War in Northern Thailand, Modern Asian Studies, Vol 8, No. 1, (1974), pg. 105, Published by Cambridge University Press, https://www.jstor.org/stable/311628 ) The second is that it was such a very small project that a well financed (from foreign countries) NGO could handle it. It has no universal application. In 1988 when the AD project started in Doi Tung the total area under illicit poppy cultivation in Thailand was only 2811 hectares (pg. 23 of UNODC's World Drug Report 1999). The same year 1740 hectares had been eradicated. The third reason is that the AD project required eradication to succeed. Eradication still continues. 264 hectares of illicit poppy fields were eradicated in 2013 according to the World Drug Report of 2014. Had Alternative Development or Opium Replacement been so successful in Thailand, why is eradication continuing or for that matter opium use, which according to Table I of UNODC's South East Asian Opium Survey is consumed by 96,284 people? The Alternative Development lobby has in its anxiety to push this concept has ignored all these hard facts, as also that all resolutions on Alternative Development recommend Alternative Development as a means to assist eradication.

Completed in 1902, it is a major example of neoclassical Beaux Arts architecture designed by Carr√®re and Hastings for Henry Flagler, a leading captain of industry in the late 19th century, and a leading developer of Florida as a tourist destination. The building is listedNational Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary accessed on June 13, 2006 a National Historic Landmark. It now houses the Flagler Museum, named after its builder. History Henry Flagler, one of the founders of Standard Oil, built Whitehall for his third wife, Mary Lily Kenan. The site of the home was purchased for $50,000 in 1893 (as of 2010 that would be $1,197,562.39) by Flagler; later surveyed for construction in July 1900 and the home completed in time for Flagler and his wife to move in on February 6, 1902.Historic American Buildings Survey Library of Congress The architects were Carr√®re and Hastings, who had earlier designed the Ponce de Leon Hotel and several other buildings in St. Augustine for Flagler. Whitehall was to be a winter residence, and Henry gave it to Mary Lily as a wedding present. They would travel to Palm Beach each year in one of their own private railcars, one of which was No. 91. Flagler died of injuries sustained in falling down a flight of marble stairs at Whitehall in 1913, at the age of 83. Mary Lily died four years later, and the home was devised to her niece Louise Clisby Wise Lewis, who sold the property to investors. They constructed a 300-room, ten-story addition to the west side of the building, obliterating Mr. Flagler's offices, the housekeeper's apartment, and altering the original kitchen and pantry area. Carrere and Hastings were the architects of the 1925 reconstruction. In 1939 it was described as a $4,000,000 building and Palm Beach's second-largest hotel. In 1959, the site was saved from demolition by one of Henry Flagler's granddaughters Jean Flagler Matthews. She established the Henry Morrison Flagler Museum non-profit corporation, which purchased the building in 1959, opening it as a museum in 1960. The upper ten stories of the hotel addition were demolished in 1963 in preparing the museum for the public. Today, Whitehall is a National Historic Landmark and is open to the public as the Flagler Museum, featuring guided tours, changing exhibits, and special programs. It also hosts a variety of local galas and balls throughout the year. The Museum is located at Cocoanut Row and Whitehall Way, Palm Beach. Architecture Interior of the Main Hall, 1972 Fountain in the courtyard When it was completed in 1902, Whitehall was hailed by the New York Herald as \\"more wonderful than any palace in Europe, grander and more magnificent than any other private dwelling in the world.\\" It was designed in the Beaux Arts style; meant to rival the extravagant mansions in Newport, Rhode Island.http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/geo-flor/36.htm National Park Service Distinct from these northern homes, Whitehall had no outbuildings or subsidiary structures. Nor had it elaborately planned or cultivated gardens. Plants, flowers, trees and shrubs were allowed to grow unaided.The American Country House, Clive Aslet, Yale University Press, 2005 pg. 222 The mansion is built around a large open-air central courtyard and is modeled after palaces in Spain and Italy. Three stories tall with several wings, the mansion has fifty-five fully restored rooms furnished with period pieces. These rooms are large with marble floors, walls and columns, murals on the ceilings, and heavy gilding. =Flagler Kenan Pavilion= Officially opened February 4, 2005, the $4.5-million Flagler Kenan Pavilion is the first addition to the property since 1925.Palm Beach Post; January 16, 2005; Sunday ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT; Pg. 6J The pavilion is named after the mogul and William R. Kenan, Jr., Flagler's engineer, friend and brother-in-law. It was designed in the Beaux- Arts manner by Jeffery W. Smith of Palm Beach-based Smith Architectural Group, Inc. and took almost four years to build. The featured display in this pavilion is Flagler's restored No. 91 rail car.

Professor Bartlett had lectured over 1,742 times since September, 1969 on Arithmetic, Population, and Energy. Bartlett regarded the word combination \\"sustainable growth\\" as an oxymoron, since even modest annual percentage population increases can represent exponential growth. Over time, huge changes will then occur. He therefore regarded human overpopulation as \\"The Greatest Challenge\\" facing humanity. Career Bartlett received a B.A. in physics at Colgate University (1944), and an A.M. (1948) and Ph.D. (1951) in physics at Harvard University. Bartlett joined the faculty at the University of Colorado at Boulder in September 1950. In 1978 he was national president of the American Association of Physics Teachers. He was a fellow of the American Physical Society and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1969 and 1970 he served two terms as the elected chair of the four-campus faculty council at the university. He won the Robert A. Millikan award. Views on population growth Thomas Malthus, pioneer of the study of demographics. Human population curve showing the power of exponential growth Chart showing change in oil prices since the 19th century. The top curve is inflation-adjusted World population from 1800 to 2100, based on UN 2004 projections (red, orange, green) and US Census Bureau historical estimates (black). Bartlett often explained how sustainable growth is a contradiction. His view was based on the fact that a modest percentage growth will equate to huge escalations over relatively short periods of time. Over time, Bartlett argued, compound growth can yield enormous increases. For example, an investor earning a constant annual 7% return on their investment would find his or her capital doubling within 10 years. But the same exponential power, so advantageous to patient investors, may be potentially calamitous when applied to human population. A population of 10,000 individuals, if it were to grow at a constant rate of 7% per annum, would reach a population size of 10 million after 100 years. Bartlett regarded the failure to understand exponential growth as \\"The Greatest Challenge\\" facing humanity, and promoted sustainable living; he was an early advocate on the topic of overpopulation. He opposed the cornucopian school of thought (as advocated by people such as Julian Lincoln Simon), and referred to it as \\"The New Flat Earth Society\\". J. B. Calvert (1999) has proposed that Bartlett's law will result in the exhaustion of petrochemical resources caused by exponential growth of the world population (in line with the Malthusian Growth Model). Bartlett made statements relating to sustainability: > \\"The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand > the exponential function.\\" and his Great Challenge: > \\"Can you think of any problem in any area of human endeavor on any scale, > from microscopic to global, whose long-term solution is in any demonstrable > way aided, assisted, or advanced by further increases in population, > locally, nationally, or globally?\\" Death Bartlett died on September 7, 2013.

He is best known for his unique bowling style, which according to Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland \\"bamboozled batsmen\\" and could \\"regularly dumbfound the best batsmen in any team\\". Early years Gleeson was born in the northern NSW town of Wiangaree (14km north of Kyogle) and grew up in the country town of Tamworth. He was the son of a Wiangaree dairy farmer, and attributed the finger strength required to bowl with his two-fingered grip to his childhood, which he spent milking cows. Aged 15, he worked for the Postmaster-General's Department, and later for Telstra. Style He used a grip similar to that of the then unique \\"bent-finger\\" action of Jack Iverson, using two fingers: a bent middle finger and the thumb pressing against the ball on both sides in an attempt to find a new variety of bowling tricks. He was one of a small number of Australians who experimented with revolutionary bowling grips in the wake of Iverson's stay in international cricket. Gleeson preferred to bowl downwind on a greenish surface, since pace from the wicket compensated for his not being a large spinner of the ball. His accuracy resulted in his mainly being used for defensive purposes, rather than an attacking one. Under the old lbw law, batsmen could not be given out if they were struck outside off stump, allowing batsmen to safely use their pads without offering a shot to nullify his googly. Career Gleeson was one of the prominent debutants of the 1966‚Äì67 Australian cricket season in the Sheffield Shield, taking 23 wickets in six matches. In the 1966‚Äì67 season, he took four wickets in five balls, including a hat-trick, in a Sydney grade game, before taking 5/28 against Victoria. He was subsequently selected in an Australian \\"Second\\" team to tour New Zealand at the end of the year. He was selected for the 1967‚Äì68 Test series against India in Australia. He made his debut in the First Test at Adelaide Oval, taking 2/36 and 2/38. He managed less success in the remaining three Tests, taking five wickets to end with nine at an average of 28.55.John Gleeson at Statsguru In 1968 he won selection for the Ashes tour of England, playing all five Tests and taking 12 wickets at 34.66. The 1968‚Äì69 season saw a heavy workload for Gleeson, in five Tests against the West Indies cricket team. In the first two Tests he took 13 wickets, including hauls of 5/122 and 5/61, and finished the series with 26 wickets at an average of 32.46.Wisden 1970, pp. 882‚Äì895. He also peaked in his batting contributions, making his two highest scores of 42* and 45 in consecutive Tests at the Sydney Cricket Ground and the Adelaide Oval. The subsequent 1969‚Äì70 tour to India was to be Australia's last Test series win there for 35 years. He took match figures of 7/108 in the First Test at Mumbai, the leading return by an Australian in an eight-wicket victory, but only three wickets in the next four matches, ending the series with ten wickets at 34.70. In 1969‚Äì70, when Australia toured South Africa, Gleeson's value was such that he insured his right hand for A$10,000. Gleeson took 18 wickets in two first-class matches against provincial teams at the start of the tour and then another five in the First Test at Cape Town, and five in the second innings in the Third Test in Johannesburg. Most of the South Africans were seeing him for the first time and struggled to understand his action. It was Barry Richards, the most junior of them, who claimed to have worked him out. Not once in seven innings did Gleeson, who took 19 wickets at 38.94 in the series, dismiss Richards, as South Africa took a 4‚Äì0 series win. Gleeson was the top Australian wicket taker in the 1970‚Äì71 Ashes series, but his 14 wickets cost 43.21 as his quest for variety resulted in loose balls and he was punished by the English batsmen who had met him in 1968.p80, Ken Kelly and David Lemmon, Cricket Reflections: Five Decades of Cricket Photographs, Heinemann, 1985 Despite being able to use their legs without danger, batsmen were still unable to overcome him during the 1971‚Äì72 domestic season when he took 45 wickets at 16.31 in eight matches, including 19 wickets in two consecutive matches. Gleeson was recalled for the 1972 Ashes tour, but was dropped after the first three Tests, in which he managed only three wickets at 52.33. He had minor skills with the bat, with one first-class half-century and a Test top score of 45. After Gleeson toured South Africa with Derrick Robins' team in 1973‚Äì74, Graeme Pollock helped to organise a position for him in the Eastern Province team for his final first class season. Later life and death He served on the inaugural governing committee of World Series Cricket. After 40 years of service with Telecom, the Australian telecommunications company, he retired in 1995 as the New South Wales internal communications manager for the firm. Gleeson died on 7 October 2016 in Tamworth. James Sutherland, CEO of Cricket Australia, said that \\"John captured the imagination of cricket fans everywhere as he bamboozled batsmen with his odd bowling grip, borrowed from another mystery Australian spinner, Jack Iverson.\\" Gleeson is survived by wife Sandra, two sons and two daughters.

During her term in Parliament, Gadiel was Deputy Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in the Kristina Keneally Labor Government. On 8 December 2010, Gadiel announced that she will not contest the 2011 state election. Early years and background Gadiel was born in Cessnock, New South Wales and attended public schools, including Cessnock High School. She studied arts and law at university before becoming involved in the trade union movement, serving as an organiser with the Communications, Electrical and Plumbing Union of Australia and as an industrial officer with the Australian Workers' Union. She was subsequently employed as a senior policy adviser to then-Police Minister Michael Costa. She was married, but has been divorced for a number of years. State politics In late 2002, Gabrielle Harrison, the Member for Parramatta, announced she would retire from parliament at the upcoming 2003 state election. Harrison conceded that she had lost support among her branch members. It was reported that, :Right-wing party bosses want to replace former sports minister Gabrielle Harrison in Parramatta with Tanya Gadiel, a member of the staff of Police Minister Michael Costa...... Mrs Gadiel [does not] have the support to win local rank-and-file preselection ballots. Gadiel was preselected to take her place after a bitter internal contest against Parramatta Lord Mayor David Borger. In 2007, Borger went on to be elected as the Member for Granville. With Borger not contesting the election, Gadiel had a relatively clear run, as the protest vote split between an independent and the Green candidate. While many commentators predicted a larger swing considering the amount of adverse press coverage, it nevertheless caused a small swing to the Liberal Party in what was otherwise a landslide victory for Labor. Gadiel was re-elected at the 2007 state election and, in December 2010, announced her decision to not seek re-election at the 2011 state election, citing family reasons. Gadiel was the 19th NSW Labor member to stand aside at the March 2011 state election. Post-political career Since leaving politics, Gadiel has been the CEO of Community Services at Parramatta Mission.

There is a way that the strikings can be distinguished. The Royal Mint issue has the dies in medallic alignment, whereas, the Heaton's Mint issue has the dies in coin alignment. In 1854, Heaton's Mint were asked to strike a new coinage. There are two types of '4's' in the date: a plain '4', and a crosslet '4'. In 1857, Heaton's Mint were asked to strike this final coinage. The reason why this was the final coinage was, because the introduction of a decimal currency into Canada was being contemplated. In 1863, the Bank of Upper Canada complained to the Canadian government that it had a hard time trying to issue their final coinage because of the change to decimal currency. The government bought the coins and stored them in a warehouse as copper bullion. After Canadian Confederation, the coins were melted in 1873 under government supervision. Popularity The coins of Upper Canada are very popular with collectors of British Empire coins, not only those of Canada. There are a few scarce pieces in this series. The 1857 issue is quite difficult to find. The pieces have been given the affectionate nickname of \\"St. George Pieces\\", because of the obverse design. References * Coins of Canada by J.A.

Much of the park is land formerly used by the United States Army. GGNRA is managed by the National Park Service and is the most visited unit of the National Park system in the United States, with more than 15 million visitors a year. It is also one of the largest urban parks in the world, with a size two-and-a-half times that of the consolidated city and county of San Francisco. The park is not one continuous locale, but rather a collection of areas that stretch from southern San Mateo County to northern Marin County, and includes several areas of San Francisco. The park is as diverse as it is expansive; it contains famous tourist attractions such as Muir Woods National Monument, Alcatraz, and the Presidio of San Francisco. The GGNRA is also home over 3,000 plant and animal species, encompasses 59 miles (95 km) of bay and ocean shoreline and has military fortifications that span centuries of California history, from the Spanish conquistadors to Cold War-era Nike missile sites.  History  The park was created thanks to the cooperative legislative efforts of cosponsors Congressman William S. Mailliard (R-San Francisco) and Congressman Phillip Burton (D-San Francisco). The plan for a non-contiguous national recreation area was conceived by Dr. Robert Busha, an administrator in Mailliard's Washington office, as a way to circumvent the prevailing limitation that national park property should be contiguous. In 1972, President Richard Nixon signed into law \\"An Act to Establish the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.\\" The bill allocated $120 million for land acquisition and development. The National Park Service first purchased Alcatraz and Fort Mason from the U.S. Army. Then to complete the national park in the north bay, the Nature Conservancy purchased the land in the Marin Headlands that made up the failed development project called Marincello from the Gulf Oil Corporation. The Nature Conservancy then transferred the land to the GGNRA. These properties formed the initial basis for the park. Throughout the next 30 years, the National Park service acquired land and historic sites from the U.S. Army, private landowners and corporations, incorporating them into the GGNRA. The acquisitions range from the historic Cliff House restaurant and Sutro Baths in San Francisco, to large and expansive forest and coastal lands, such as Sweeney Ridge in San Mateo County and Muir Woods National Monument in Marin. Many decommissioned Army bases and fortifications were incorporated into the park, including Fort Funston, four Nike missile sites, The Presidio and Crissy Field. The latest acquisition by the National Park Service is Mori Point, a small parcel of land on the Pacifica coast. In 1988, UNESCO designated the GGNRA and 12 adjacent protected areas the Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve. In February 2005, Senator Dianne Feinstein introduced legislation in the United States Senate that would add of natural land to the GGNRA in San Mateo County including a 4,076 acre parcel known as the Rancho Corral de Tierra. The property, located south of Pacifica and surrounding the communities of Moss Beach and Montara, is home to many diverse plant and animal species. The bill passed in the Senate, but did not pass the House of Representatives. On December 9, 2011, Rancho Corral de Tierra was transferred from the Peninsula Open Space Trust to the GGNRA and the National Park Service.

History According to Eutropius and Festus, who in the second half of the 4th century historians, at a time when the Roman emperor Trajan was perceived as \\"a valuable paradigm for contemporary events and figures\\", wrote under the direction of the Emperor Valens, Assyria was one of three provinces (with Armenia and Mesopotamia) created by Trajan in AD 116 following a successful military campaign against Parthia that in that year saw him cross the River Tigris from Mesopotamia and take possession, in spite of resistance, of the territory of Adiabene and then march south to the Parthian capital of Seleucia-Ctesiphon and to Babylon.Theodore Mommsen, R√∂mische Geschichte (Berlin 1885), vol. V (Die Provinzen von Caesar bis Diocletian), pp. 400‚àí401 There is numismatic evidence for the Trajanic provinces of Armenia and Mesopotamia, but none for that of Assyria, whose existence is questioned by C.S. Lightfoot and F. Miller.C. S. Lightfoot, \\"Trajan's Parthian War and the Fourth-Century Perspective\\" in The Journal of Roman Studies, Vol. 80 (1990), pp. 115-126Erich Kettenhofen, \\"Trajan\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Iranica (2004)Simon Grote, \\"Another look at the Breviarium of Festus\\" in The Classical Quarterly, Volume 61, Issue 2 (December 2011), pp. 704-721 Despite Rome's military victory, Trajan's 116 conquest was plagued with difficulties. From the start, a Parthian prince named Santruces organized an armed revolt by the native peoples, during which Roman garrisons were driven from their posts and a Roman general was killed as his troops tried to stop the rebellion.David Magie, Roman Rule in Asia Minor to the End of the Third Century After Christ, Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1950: p. 609. Trajan overcame the revolt, capturing and burning Seleucia and Edessa, and even setting up a puppet Parthian king; but then, on his journey homeward in triumph, he fell sick and died on 8 August 117. Trajan's successor, Hadrian, implemented a new policy with respect to the recently acquired territories in the east. Believing that they overextended the empire, he withdrew to the more easily defensible borders.Charles Freeman, The World of the Romans, New York: Oxford University Press, 1993: p. 62.The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume XI, London: Cambridge University Press, 1970: p. 640. He left unfinished the work of overcoming the Parthians, which he saw would require an excessive increase in military spending. He sent the puppet Parthian king elsewhere and restored to the former ruler the lands east of the Euphrates, together with his daughter who had been captured, preferring to live with him in peace and friendship.Theodore Mommsen, R√∂mische Geschichte (Berlin 1885), vol. V (Die Provinzen von Caesar bis Diocletian), p. 403  Location  The fourth-century historians Eutropius and Festus assume that the supposed Roman province of Assyria was situated \\"east of the Tigris and usually identified with Adiabene\\". But some modern scholars argue that the Assyria Provincia was located between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, in present-day central Iraq, a location that is corroborated by the text of the 4th-century Roman historian Festus.C.S. Lightfoot, \\"Trajan's Parthian War and the Fourth-Century Perspective,\\" The Journal of Roman Studies, Volume 80, (1990), p. 121-122. Archaeologist Andr√© Maricq \\"convincingly equates it with the ƒÄsurestƒÅn of the 3rd century ≈†ƒÅpur inscription\\". However, other sources contend that the province was located near Armenia and east of the Tigris, in a region formerly known as Adiabene,Lightfoot p. 121; Magie p. 608. which was a Neo-Assyrian kingdom.  Further Roman activity in Mesopotamia  Hadrian's withdrawal in 118 did not mark the end of Roman rule in Mesopotamia. A second Parthian campaign was launched from 161-165 under the command of Lucius Verus, with the Roman army once more conquering territory east of the Euphrates.The Cambridge Ancient History p. 640. Rome pursued military action against the Parthians again in 197-8 under the command of emperor Septimius Severus.Magie p. 674-5; Fergus Millar, The Roman Empire and its Neighbors, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1967: p. 211. Following his successful campaign, Septimius Severus instituted two new Roman provinces: Mesopotamia and Osroene, a kingdom founded in the 2nd century BC,Matthew Bunson, A Dictionary of the Roman Empire (Oxford University Press 1995), p. 303 centered on Edessa. He also stationed two Roman legions in the new provinces to ensure stability and prevent against first Parthian, and later Sassanian attacks.Magie p. 674-5; Fergus Millar, The Roman Empire and its Neighbors, London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 1967: p. 211. Roman influence in the area came to an end under Jovian in 363, who abandoned the region after concluding a hasty peace agreement with the Sassanians and retreating to Constantinople to consolidate his political power.Ammianus Marcellinus The Later Roman Empire (354-378) A shameful peace concluded by Jovian 6.7 pg.303, Penguin Classics, Translated by Walter Hamilton 1986 Despite continued Roman activity in the region, no further reference is made to a Roman province of Assyria following Hadrian's evacuation in 118 AD. When Septimus Severus created the provinces of Osroene and Mesopotamia at the end of the 2nd century, no mention is made of a Roman province of Assyria. The Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus (c. 330 ‚àí c. 391) says that the district of Adiabene was formerly called Assyria, with no indication that either ever was a Roman province.Ammianus Marcellinus, Rerum gestarum libri 23.6.20 He says that Assyria was the nearest to Rome of the chief Persian provinces and that in his time it was known by a single name, though previously divided among several peoples and tribes.Ammianus 23.6.14‚àí15 He lists among the cities of Assyria Babylon, Seleucia and Ctesiphon.Ammianus, 23.6.23 He speaks of the Emperor Julian as, in his campaign against the Sasanian Empire, attacking Assyrians shortly before crossing the Euphrates into Osroene,Ammianus 23.2.6 as living near the Euphrates to the south of Carrhae,Ammianus 23.3.1 Thus, it seems that the province of Assyria only existed during Trajan's reign, if even then, and was not reinstated during later Roman occupations of the region. The general area coincided with ancient Assyria; however, and the Medes, Achaemenid Persians, Seleucid Greeks, Sassanids and Parthians all had similar names for the area (Ashur, Athura, Assuristan). The Assyrian people of the region had already begun to adopt Christianity by Trajan's time, and still retained an Akkadian-infused Eastern Aramaic as a spoken and literary tongue, as they do to this day.

Thomson, who \\"bowled off his front leg like a frog in a windmill\\" (hence his nickname) played in four Tests and one ODI in the 1970‚Äì71 season. He played District cricket with the Fitzroy Cricket Club, and took 5/39 against Richmond in their first innings, in his first ever first XI match for the club, on Saturday, 27 March 1965 (he had scored 10 runs for Fitzroy in their first innings on the previous Saturday). He was a right-arm fast-medium who delivered the ball with a windmill-like action. The flailing of his left arm, a split second before the delivery gave some people the impression that he'd bowled off the \\"wrong foot\\" but a slow motion replay shows that the delivery stride was conventional.Left-arm spin bowler Bob Bitmead, a Victorian and Fitzroy contemporary of Thomson, also delivered off the \\"wrong foot\\". Thomson made his first-class debut for Victoria against New South Wales in Sydney in January 1969, taking 6 for 114 in the first innings. In his next match, against the touring West Indians in Melbourne, he took 5 for 76 and 6 for 84. In 1969‚Äì70, with the Test team away in India and South Africa, he was the outstanding player of the season, with 55 wickets in 10 matches at an average of 18.74. Against New South Wales in Melbourne he took 5 for 54 and 8 for 87, which remained his best innings and match figures. A number 11 batsman who seldom reached double figures, he hit his top first-class score of 34 not out against Tasmania in Melbourne in January 1970.T. L. Goodman, \\"Australian Inter-state Matches\\", Wisden 1971, pp. 929‚Äì52. He toured New Zealand with an Australian team at the end of the season, opening the bowling in the first match against a Test-strength New Zealand team in Auckland and taking five wickets. At the start of 1970-71 Thomson took 6 for 80 and 3 for 101 in Victoria's tour match against the M.C.C. as the tourists were dismissed for 142 and 341 and lost by 6 wickets. As a result, he was called up for the First Test in the 1970-71 Ashes series, having by this stage in his career taken 120 wickets in 22 matches at 20.01, but he failed to live up to expectations. In the Fifth Test at Melbourne Thomson bowled bouncers at the England fast bowler John Snow, who had hit Garth McKenzie on the head in the previous Test, and six in one eight- ball over against the captain Ray Illingworth. Thomson was not warned for intimidatory bowling, which Snow thought was partisan umpiring as Snow was repeatedly warned throughout the series.p102, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 In the Sixth Test, his last, he shared the new ball with Test debutant Dennis Lillee. Like Lillee, he took five wickets in the match ‚Äì 2 for 94 and 3 for 79, his best innings and match figures in Tests. The series also saw the last Tests of his fellow pace bowlers Graham McKenzie, Alan Connolly and Ross Duncan. After 1970-71 he played irregularly for Victoria, and two wicketless matches in 1974-75 were his last. He is famous for taking the first-ever wicket in ODI cricket (Geoff Boycott caught by Bill Lawry for 8 runs) at the MCG on 5 January 1971; it was his only wicket in his only ODI match. He was the most economical bowler in the match, taking 1 for 22 off eight 8-ball overs. In 1971-72 he took 4 for 13 off eight 8-ball overs for Victoria against Queensland in Brisbane, his best List-A (interstate one day) match figures. He was also a senior Australian rules football umpire, umpiring Senior Grade VFL football, at a time when there was only one field umpire, and before the transformation of the VFL into the AFL. He officiated in six VFL matches between 1970 and 1972.VFL/AFL field umpires  Footnotes  External links * Alan Thomson at Cricket Archive * Alan Thomson at Cricinfo References * Carter, R., \\"‚ÄúSplit Personality‚Äù Sportsman\\", The Age, (Thursday, 13 March 1969), p.26.

Biography Born in 1859 in Antwerp, Delehaye joined the Society of Jesus in 1876,\\"Delehaye, Reverend Hippolyte\\", The Catholic Encyclopedia and Its Makers, New York, the Encyclopedia Press, 1917, p. 41 being received into the novitiate the following year. After making his initial profession of religious vows in 1879, he was sent to study philosophy at the University of Louvain from 1879 to 1882. He was then assigned until 1886 to teach mathematics at the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe in Ghent (named for the school in Paris, alma mater of Ignatius of Loyola). Delehaye was ordained in 1890. In 1892 Fr Delehaye was appointed by his Jesuit superiors to be a fellow of the Society of Bollandists, named for the 17th- century hagiographical scholar Jean Bolland, S.J.,and founded the early seventeenth century specifically to study hagiography, research towards the gathering and evaluation of historical documentary sources regarding the life and cult of Christian Saints. Delehaye soon displayed great competence in the field. He was an editor of the Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca (1895), a technical catalogue of Greek hagiographical writings, and of the journal Analecta Bollandiana. In 1912 he became the president of the Society. In the earlier part of the twentieth century fears arose in the Catholic Church about the theological consequences of some methods used in critical historical studies, including biblical scholarship. Later the Church accepted the principle of critical methodology, and in 1930 Pope Pius XI, himself a historical scholar, established a special historical section operating on similar lines, within the Sacred Congregation of Rites. However, at an earlier juncture suspicion fell for a time on a wide variety of Catholic scholarly institutes, including the Bollandists, whose purpose was to establish scholarly editions of hagiographical texts that were based on applying the critical method of sound documentary scholarship. These concerns about theological deviations generally referred to as Modernism prompted the 1907 encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis, in which St. Pius X condemned them.Pascendi dominici gregis As a consequence, in those years critical method encountered difficulties, within the Jesuit Order, within the Holy Office and among \\"integrist\\" opponents of critical approaches.Detailed in Bernard Joassart's study concentrating on the L√©gendes, Hippolyte Delehaye.

These were issues of broader scope that did not prevent Fr Delehaye from continuing as a priest in good standing to pursue his researches with the Bollandists for the greater part of his long life and maintaining his international reputation as a respected and able scholar. He was a member of the Austrian Archaeological Institute, and named Knight of the Order of Leopold. Delehaye wrote a number of articles for the Catholic Encyclopedia.

Its mountain ranges are part of the system of hills extending through Laos, Burma, and China and linking to the Himalayas, of which they may be considered foothills. The highlands in the north of Thailand are characterized by a pattern of generally steep hill ranges, intermontane basins and alluvial gorges. Elevations are generally moderate, little above for the highest summits. There is a wide range of elevations though, with floors ranging between above sea level. Towards the Lao border, the divide to the Mekong basin becomes higher with peaks occasionally rising above and streams flowing in narrow steep valleys.Heritage Thailand, Geography 4 The climate is typical of tropical mountains with clearly delineated wet and dry seasons. Winter temperatures can be cool with frosts occurring most years at higher elevations, but no snow even on the highest peaks.

They are linked to a wide system of ranges in neighboring Burma and Laos that do not have a specific name for the whole, \\"Thai highlands\\" being the term generally restricted to the Thai area.The Physical Geography of Southeast Asia, Avijit Gupta Broadly defined, and based on their geological composition, there are two mountainous subsystems in Northern Thailand: *In the western part the ranges stretching southwards from the Daen Lao Range, in the southern region of the Shan Hills or Shan Highland, with the two parallel mountain chains of the Thanon Thong Chai Range (‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏≤‡∏ñ‡∏ô‡∏ô‡∏ò‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏±‡∏¢).

The ranges separating the main rivers are generally steep, high and continuous. Towards the east, as well as in the Wang and Yom drainage basins, they are lower. The Pai River in the northwest flows westwards into the Salween and the northeastern part is drained by rivers of the Mekong basin, like the Kok and Ing. Geology Geologically in the southern subranges of the Shan Hills layers of alluvium are superimposed on hard rock. The ranges closer to Laos consist of Permo-Carboniferous limestone, which makes for a more jagged and steep relief, despite the more moderate height.Geology of Thailand - Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Bangkok Most of the Thai highlands are part of the Shan-Thai Terrane, a tectonic plate.  Environment and human impact Akha hut in the hills near Chiang Rai The natural environment of the hills used to be dense montane rain forest. Swidden agricultural practices and logging have much reduced the old-growth forest areas which have been replaced by secondary forest.Secondary forests in swidden agriculture in the highlands of Thailand For centuries the Thai highlands have been inhabited with hill tribes mostly from Chinese or Tibeto-Burman descent, such as the Akha, Yao, Lahu, Khmu, Hmong and Lisu. These human groups immigrated into this relatively empty region fleeing persecution or harsh central rule in their respective environments, as well as seeking new land for their shifting agricultural productions system. For the past decades these groups have been undergoing a process of integration into the Thai mainstream. Owing to the unrest in Burma, some refugee camps have been established for cross-border refugees in the Thai highlands.TBBC Certain Kayah and Karen communities, like the \\"long-necked Karen\\", are regularly visited by organized tourist groups.The Politics of Ethnic Tourism in Northern Thailand At higher elevations, above , one of the main crops was opium until the 1990s, when the combined effects of development became evident‚Äîfrom the construction of roads into the remote area, increasingly efficient policing, and opium replacement programs.Opium Reduction and Highland Development: Thailand Case Study Yearly wildfires are started by local farmers during the dry season in different areas of northern Thailand. Often speculators also hire people to set forests on fire in order to claim land title deeds for the areas that, post-fire, become \\"degraded forest\\". The smoke produced by these fires is the main cause of the intense seasonal air pollution in the Thai highlands, also known as the \\"northern haze\\".Mushroom Research Center Fires also contribute to the floods in the country by denuding forest undergrowth and the dry forest soil leads to lower water intake for the trees to extract when the rains arrive. Presently large tracts of the mountains are covered with a mixed vegetation resulting from the capacity of the efficient shifting agricultural system being exceeded. As a result, large areas end up becoming dominated by Imperata cylindrica grass, which is used throughout Thailand as roofing material. Cattle can graze on the grass to an extent, as agricultural science research in the 1970s showed.Lindsay Falvey, Cattle and Sheep in Northern Thailand, Chiang Mai (1979). 104pp The longer term environmental care of the region is associated with forestry and in the lower reaches, perennial fruit like peaches and other trees. Some projects for the restoration of forest cover have been undertaken in ecologically degraded areas.

It was originally known as the Library of Congress Building and is located on First Street SE, between Independence Avenue and East Capitol Street in Washington, D.C. The Beaux-Arts style building is known for its classicizing facade and elaborately decorated interior. Its design and construction has a tortuous history; the building's main architect was Paul J. Pelz, initially in partnership with John L. Smithmeyer, and succeeded by Edward Pearce Casey during the last few years of construction. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. Design The Main Reading Room View of approaches from the west fa√ßade of the Thomas Jefferson Building The Great Hall, View of first and second floors, with Minerva mosaic in background John L. Smithmeyer and Paul J. Pelz won the competition for the architectural plans of the library in 1873. The start of the project was delayed by congressional debates until a vote in 1886. In 1888, Smithmeyer was dismissed and Pelz became the lead architect. Pelz was himself dismissed in 1892 and replaced by Edward Pearce Casey, the son of Brig. Gen. Thomas Lincoln Casey, Chief of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, who at the time was in charge of the building's construction. While Smithmeyer was instrumental in securing the commission, Pelz appears to have been the main designer of the building and oversaw most of the exterior work. Casey is credited for the completion of the interiors and the artistic supervision of the building's unique decorative program. The Library opened to the public in 1897 and the finishing work was completed in 1898. The Thomas Jefferson Building, containing some of the richest public interiors in the United States, is a compendium of the work of classically trained American sculptors and painters of the \\"American Renaissance\\", in programs of symbolic content that exhibited the progress of civilization, personified in Great Men and culminating in the American official culture of the Gilded Age;According to a contemporary guidebook, \\"America is justly proud of this gorgeous and palatial monument to its National sympathy and appreciation of Literature, Science, and Art\\". the programs were in many cases set out by the Librarian of Congress, Ainsworth Rand Spofford. The central block is broadly comparable to the Palais Garnier in Paris, a similarly ambitious expression of triumphant cultural nationalism in the Beaux-Arts style that had triumphed at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893. On the exterior, sculptured portrait heads that were considered typical of the world's races were installed as keystones on the main storey's window arches. The second-floor portico of the front entrance facing the U.S. Capitol features nine prominent busts of Great Men as selected by Ainsworth Rand Spofford in accordance with Gilded Age ideals. From left to right when one faces the building, they are Demosthenes (portico north side), Ralph Waldo Emerson, Washington Irving, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Babbington Macaulay, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Sir Walter Scott and Dante Alighieri (portico south side). The sculptors were Herbert Adams, Jonathan Scott Hartley and Frederick W. Ruckstull. The Court of Neptune Fountain centered on the entrance front invites comparison with the Trevi Fountain; its sculptor was Roland Hinton Perry. The copper dome, originally gilded, was criticized at the structure's completion, as too competitive with the national Capitol Building. History Library of Congress building, c. 1902 Needing more room for its increasing collection, the Library of Congress under Librarian Ainsworth Rand Spofford suggested to the Congress that a new building be built specifically to serve as the American national library. Prior to this the Library existed in a wing of the Capitol Building. The new building was needed partly because of the growing Congress, but also partly because of the Copyright Law of 1870, which required all copyright applicants to send to the Library two copies of their work. This resulted in a flood of books, pamphlets, maps, music, prints and photographs. Spofford had been instrumental in the enactment of this law. After Congress approved construction of the building in 1886, it took eleven years to complete. The building opened to the public on November 1, 1897, met with wide approval and was immediately seen as a national monument. The building name was changed on June 13, 1980 to honor former U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, who had been a key figure in the establishment of the Library in 1800. Jefferson offered to sell his personal book collection to Congress in September 1814, one month after the British had burned the Capitol in the War of 1812. Inside the book tunnel  Book Conveying Apparatus  Prior to the 2000s, the Jefferson Building was linked to the Capitol Building by a purpose built book tunnel. This housed an electric \\"book conveying apparatus\\" that could transport volumes between the two buildings at 600 feet per minute. A portion of the book tunnel was destroyed to make room for the underground Capitol Visitor Center, which opened in 2008. Capitol Page School Senate, House and Supreme Court pages formerly attended school together in the Capitol Page School located on the attic level above the Great Hall. Upon the separation of the programs (and the closure of the Supreme Court Page Program), the schools split. Senate Pages now attend school in the basement of their dormitory. The House Page Program was closed in August 2011. A small suite in the northwest corner of the attic level remains home to the official office of the Poet Laureate of the United States. Coolidge Auditorium The Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Auditorium, which opened in October, 1925, has been home to more than 2,000 concerts, primarily of classical chamber music, but occasionally also of jazz, folk music, and special presentations. Some performances make use of the Library's extensive collection of musical instruments and manuscripts. Most of the performances are free and open to the public. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge was a wealthy patron of the arts and was no relation to Calvin Coolidge, who, coincidentally, was President of the United States at the time the Coolidge auditorium was established. Art More than fifty American painters and sculptors produced commissioned works of art.

Historically considered a masculine habit, the feminization of smoking occurred in tandem with the advent of fashion brands or premium brands of cigarettes specifically marketed toward women. Most often this is focused on young fashion-conscious professional ladies who are the target demographic for these brands, which are differentiated by slimness and added length over traditional brands of cigarettes. This development of the female market occurred in tandem with an expansion of the \\"luxury cigarette\\" concept aimed at men and women, through the appearance of \\"luxury, opulence and sophistication\\" of packaging. These brands include decorative ones like Eve, marketed strictly toward women like Virginia Slims, or as evening-out styles like Sobranie Cocktail, designed to appeal to women, and their counterpart Sobranie Black Russian, the darker colours of which targeted a male market. Many fashion houses have lent their name (through a licensing agreement) to cigarettes; Yves Saint Laurent is arguably the most successful of these (even though he admitted in a 1968 interview he smokes, but not his namesake brand, as he does \\"not like the flavour\\"), though many other brands have been marketed, from time to time, in select international markets: Givenchy, Versace, Pierre Cardin, Christian Lacroix and Cartier (a jewelry house). In the 1980s and early 1990s, manufacturers created longer, 164 millimeter versions of several ladies' cigarettes. However, finding only a small niche market, the machines that produced them have since been dismantled. With the anti-smoking movement in the United States, cigarette manufacturers have turned to Asia, where there is a distinct market for female oriented brands, and to the nouveau riche in Russia.

Founded in 1984, the company created the cultural phenomenon Big Mouth Billy Bass and popular brands like Airblown¬Æ Inflatable and LightShow¬Æ for holiday and seasonal decorating. Gemmy's diverse product line has created recognizable brands of outdoor d√©cor such as Airblown inflatables, LightShow light strings and pathway markers, and Projection Spotlights. Their animated products include Dancing Hamsters, Monkey Town USA, Frogz, Douglas Fir the Talking Tree, Pete the Repeat Parrot, Buck the Animated Trophy, Bud the Talking Bear Rug, and Big Mouth Billy Bass. Gemmy produces products based on popular licenses such as Star Wars, Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters, DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Peanuts, Dora the Explorer. SpongeBob SquarePants, M&M;'s, Hello Kitty, Frosty the Snowman, The Elf on the Shelf, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer, The Simpsons, Looney Tunes, Family Guy, South Park, Sesame Street, Garfield, Minions and many more. Their animated line also consists of life-sized Halloween animated figures, some of which (in the past) have represented movie villains such as Count Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, The Mummy, Wicked Witch of the West, Freddy Krueger, Ghost Face, Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, Pinhead, and Leatherface. Their animated products have since gained a cult following, and the company gained more attention when videos of some of their products of twerking animals arose on YouTube in 2015.  History  In 1984, Gemmy introduced its first product line‚Äîballpoint pens. An entrepreneurial company at heart, Gemmy soon found its creative legs and began developing novelty items that mirrored cultural trends in music and movies like Dancing Hamsters, Frogz, Pete the Repeat Parrot, Douglas Fir the Talking Tree and Big Mouth Billy Bass¬Æ. In 2000, Gemmy first released Big Mouth Billy Bass¬Æ, a sound and motion activated talking fish on a trophy plaque. The novelty item became a cultural sensation, with owners including the Queen of England. The first iteration of the animatronic fish featured the popular songs \\"Don't Worry, Be Happy‚Äù by Bobby McFerrin and \\"Take Me To The River‚Äù by Al Green. Subsequent versions were made for Christmas and later the iconic singing fish went high-tech with an Alexa-compatible version that responds to voice commands. In 2001, Gemmy introduced the Airblown¬Æ Inflatable brand, changing the way America decorates for the holidays. The popular line of yard d√©cor includes items for Christmas, Halloween, and a variety of other holidays. In 2008, Gemmy launched its LightShow¬Æ brand which now includes light strings, yard d√©cor, and Projection‚Ñ¢ spotlights for virtually any holiday imaginable. The LightShow¬Æ line of products included innovations in LED lighting and has grown into a large array of branded lighting technologies like ColorChanging‚Ñ¢, Shooting Star¬Æ, ColorMotion‚Ñ¢, Fire & Ice‚Ñ¢, Kaleidoscope‚Ñ¢, and Whirl-A-Motion‚Ñ¢. The company continues to add technology and products to its extensive line of LightShow¬Æ holiday lighting. In 2015, Gemmy introduced Points of Light‚Ñ¢, an outdoor spotlight with 98 effects and dozens of color options. Featured on TV in 2016, the lighting technology became a holiday favorite, selling out quickly. Also introduced in 2015 was the Dancing Twerking Fox, called one of the must-have toys of 2015. In 2017 and 2018, Gemmy continued to develop products with the latest technology used by consumers, introducing brands like AppLights‚Ñ¢ and SmartLights‚Ñ¢, as well as Alexa-compatible lighting technologies and animated characters. Gemmy also partners with the most recognized and beloved brands‚Äîsuch as Disney, Star Wars, Marvel, Peanuts, Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, and many more‚Äîto create licensed versions of their most popular products.

Newell's father encouraged his early interest in geology from a young age, often taking him to fossil deposits located in Kansas and Colorado. In 1929 at the age of 20 Newell received his B.S. degree from the University of Kansas, and his M.A. degree in 1931. He received his Ph.D. in geology from Yale University in 1933, where he was mentored by Charles Schuchert and Carl Dunbar.Rigby, J. K.

Wormall was a co-worker of Newell's at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Newell was also a talented saxophone player, and played in jazz bands to earn money through college. He briefly considered a career as a musician, but his intellectual interests moved him in a different direction.
