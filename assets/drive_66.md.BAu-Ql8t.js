Plot  In a sequence of flashbacks, a more cheerful Logan is shown placing a supply crate on the side of the road. He receives a call for help from a woman, Serena, who is trapped by a herd of walkers at a gas station. Logan asks Clayton for support over the radio, but he doesn't answer. He makes a desperate attempt to save Serena, but is too late as the walkers devour her (it is revealed that Clayton was unable to help because Sarah and Wendell stole his truck during the hurricane). A distraught Logan is soon found by a group riding on horseback, led by a woman named Virginia. She says she has been watching him and shares his vision. In the present, Logan's crew arrive at the oil field and a standoff ensues, with Logan declaring they are taking all of the oil. The smoke and fire from the oil field attract countless walkers, forcing everyone to take shelter. A reluctant Sarah saves Logan's life as they hide in an office. Meanwhile, Alicia and Strand receive a call from a woman holed up in the same gas station Serena was. Logan, who is listening, encourages the woman to commit suicide, but she is rescued by Wes. Alicia and Strand arrive, but the woman says they need to leave before the people she ran away from show up. The next morning, the oil field walkers are dispatched and the standoff resumes.

Bolkestein (born March 13, 1972) is a Dutch politician, who has been serving as a member of the House of Representatives since July 2020. He is a member of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). Before becoming an MP, Bolkestein had a career in the private sector at Royal Dutch Shell and a number of consultancy firms. He had also been a councilman in Bloemendaal (2014‚Äì2018) and a member of the States of North Holland (2019‚Äì2020).  Early life and education  Bolkestein was born on March 13, 1972 in the North Holland city Haarlem and grew up in the nearby villages Overveen and Bloemendaal. He attended the Stedelijk Gymnasium Haarlem before studying economics at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam between 1990 and 1997. During the last one and a half years of his study, he worked as financial manager at Russia Travel.  Non-political career  After completing his study, Bolkestein started working for oil and gas company Royal Dutch Shell in The Hague. His positions included financial and IT manager, and he worked for five years in Dubai for Shell Middle East (2006‚Äì2011). In 2012, Bolkestein became an ethics and compliance manager at Shell. Simultaneously, he became a partner at the consultancy firms N=2 Advisory and BlueSuit. The former company advises governments on mergers and divestments, while the latter gives advice on corporate finance to the private sector. Bolkestein left Shell in 2015 after having worked at the company for eighteen years. Bolkestein worked as managing consultant at the firm Berenschot between April 2017 and his appointment as member of parliament.  Local and regional politics  He became member of the Bloemendaal municipal council in March 2014 after the VVD received a plurality of five out of nineteen seats in the elections. Bolkestein was placed third on the party list. He succeeded Peter Boeijink as party leader in Bloemendaal in January 2015. He did not run for re-election during the 2018 municipal elections. While a council member, Bolkestein had been on the territory and audit committees. He also wrote a book in that period called (\\"Village politics: where is the local authority?\\") together with political scientist and fellow councilman Meindert Fennema. It was published by Uitgeverij Prometheus in February 2018 and describes the political turmoil in Bloemendaal and the problems local government is facing in general. The book also contains recommendations to bridge the gap between citizens and politics including basing the number of council members that are elected in an election on voter turnout and filling the remaining seats with inhabitants chosen through a lottery. Bolkestein appeared on place eleven on the party list of the VVD in North Holland during the 2019 provincial elections, but he was not elected. When two members of the States of North Holland belonging to the VVD became members of the new provincial-executive, Bolkestein was appointed to the former body in June 2019. He was made member of the nature, agriculture, and health care committee as well as the VVD's spokesperson in the areas livability and health care (environment), recreation and tourism, and animal welfare.  House of Representatives (2020‚Äìpresent)  During the 2017 general election, he was the fiftieth candidate on the VVD's party list. He did not become a member of parliament, as his party won 33 seats and Bolkestein received 735 preferential votes. He joined the House of Representatives on July 2, 2020 because of his place on the party list after Bas van 't Wout had vacated his seat to become State Secretary for Social Affairs and Employment.

He was the first Deputy Speaker of Parliament from then Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) following the signing of Unity Accord in 1987. During the Gukurahundi era, he was labelled a dissident and was arrested and detained. Mabhena was conferred with a National Hero honour in October 2010 by President Robert Mugabe but his family declined because Mebhena had instructed that he did not want to be buried at the National Heroes Acre in Harare along with other ZANU-PF members due to political squabble he had with Mugabe a decade earlier.  Early life and education  Mabhena was born in Zinyangeni in Inyathi. His family was ejected from their village of Inyathi by whites who were looking to settle there and were subsequently resettled in Nkayi District. His early education started at Zinyangeni Primary School from where he enrolled at Inyathi Mission School for his secondary education. After his secondary education, he moved to South Africa and enrolled at Tiger Kloof where he furthered his studies. After his return from South Africa, he became a music teacher at Inyathi.  Political career  Mabhena joined politics and nationalist movement in the 1950s to end white minority rule in the country who had forcefully evicted his family from their village Inyathi to Nkayi during the regime of Ian Smith. Mabhena was a member of the African National Congress which was led by Joshua Nkomo and later joined ZAPU. Mabhena served as Secretaty General of one of the main liberation parties, Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) which was later polarised due to internal wrangling and merged with Robert Mugabe‚Äôs ZANU resulting in a new political party, ZANU-PF in late 1980s. Mabhena was detained in Wha Wha and Salisbury prisons between 1962 and 1979 and later at Gonakudzingwa. While in prison, Mabhena enrolled for an Advanced level studies and earned a certificate in bookkeeping from the Fellowship of the Association of Certified Bookkeepers of South Africa. After Second Chimurenga war ended and the country gained independence, Mabhena was elected Chairman of Nkayi Rural District Council Secretary for ZAPU. In 1985, he was elected MP for Nkayi. In the early 1990s, Mabhena was appointed Governor of Matebeleland North Province and was re-elected in July 2000. While serving as governor he criticised President Robert Mugabe‚Äôs policies and lack of development in Matebeleland but was labelled a ‚Äòtribalist‚Äô and replaced with Orbet Mpofu. He was informed of his replacement after he had travelled from Bulawayo to Harare where he was to be sworn in. After this, he became less active in ZANU-PF activities sparking rumours that he had defected to opposition Movement for Democratic Change, MDC but became active in ZANU-PF in 2006 ending speculation of his defection.  Death  Mabhena died in 2010 of diabetes and high blood pressure which he claimed deteriorated during his incarceration at the time of Gukurahundi massacres. Mabhena was buried at Stanley Cemetery in Bulawayo instead of National Heroes Acre designated for the burial of citizens conferred with National Hero honour. He had advised his family that he would not want to be buried at National Heroes Acre alongside ZANU-PF officials.

Life Nahid Rachlin was born June 6, 1944 in Abadan, Iran. Her father Manoochehr Bozorgmehri was a circuit judge, and her mother Mohtaram Bozorgmehri had ten children. Brought up by an aunt until she was nine years old, she then lived with her parents, who were emotionally distant, under the shadow of restrictive gender expectations. Her closest family relationship was with an older sister, Pari. Pari underwent arranged marriage to a physically abusive older man, and then lost access to her son after she sued for divorce. Pari remarried, but suffered episodes of mental breakdown for which she was institutionalised, and died young after a home accident. In 1962, aged 17, Rachlin emigrated to the United States, gaining a BA at Lindenwood College. She married Howard Rachlin, a psychology professor, and in 1969 became a naturalized US citizen. In the early 1970s she pursued graduate study in creative writing, writing short stories for a class with Richard Humphries at Columbia University, and for a class with Donald Barthelme at City College of New York.

She served as a prominent news anchor for Chinese state owned English news channel CGTN in Beijing from 2012 to 2020 and also hosted the Global Business programme which airs on CGTN. In September 2020, after she had been detained by Chinese authorities in mid-August, a government official said Cheng Lei was \\"suspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China‚Äôs national security\\".  Early life  Cheng Lei was born in Yueyang, Hunan province, in 1975 and emigrated to Melbourne with her parents at the age of 10 and was raised in Australia. She has two children.  Career  She completed her higher studies in commerce from the University of Queensland. After her graduation, she pursued her career in the field of Finance in Australia. She was advised and influenced by her parents to become an accountant. After showing dissatisfaction over accountancy, she pursued her career as a television reporter. Cheng also worked as a China correspondent for CNBC, a US based business network for about nine years before joining the Chinese state owned network CGTN. In 2012, she entered the CGTN network as a news anchor.  Detention  On 14 August 2020, the Government of Australia received a formal notification regarding the detention of Cheng Lei which was later confirmed in a statement by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne. Australian public news broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation revealed that she was being held under so called residential surveillance, which allows the Chinese officials and authorities to keep detainees in secret custody for up to a period of six months without charge. She was held nearly two weeks before official news regarding her detention broke out in the media. After the news emerged regarding her detention, CGTN apparently removed the biography and details of the journalist from its official website. Her detention also further escalated the tensions between Australia and China. Zhao Lijian, spokesman for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters on September 8 that Cheng Lei was ‚Äúsuspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China‚Äôs national security‚Äù. Zhao did not provide any details about the accusations.\\"Cheng Lei: China says journalist 'endangered national security'\\" BBC News. September 8, 2020. Two Australian journalists based in China, Bill Birtles of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Michael Smith of The Australian Financial Review, were investigated by China's state security police due to Cheng Lei's case. Her arrest was described by Elaine Pearson, the head of Human Rights Watch Australia, as a possible instance of hostage diplomacy. The Guardian and some Australian media outlets have drawn parallels with the seizure of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in December 2018 that occurred after Canada arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. Minister Payne stated in a radio interview that the idea Cheng was being used as a pawn in the deteriorating relationship between the two countries was \\"speculative at best\\".

After World War II, from 1947 to 1951, it hosted a vocational school, followed by a stint until 1957 as a dormitory for students of Ivo Lola Ribar Gymnasium. Refugees from Croatia and Bosnia lived there during the years of direct Yugoslav control.

By that time he had already achieved a measure of notability more broadly as a poet and genealogist. Biography =Provenance= Karel Aeneas de Croeser was born at Brugge at a time when almost the entire southern part of the Netherlands was flourishing economically as a semi-detached Austrian province. His father, Karel Jozef de Croeser (1701-1775), was an army officer. Both his father and his mother, born Marie Charlotte Stochove (1724-1774), came from prominent Flemish families. =Early years= His secondary schooling was with the Augustinians in Brugge, after which he moved on to study successfully for a degree in Law at the (not yet split) University of Leuven on the far side of Brussels. By January 1792 he was back in Bruges. He embarked on a career in public administration, working as a municipal \\"Schepen\\" (sometimes translated as \\"magistrate\\") in the one but last city administration to be appointed before the entire region was over-run by French revolutionary \\"citizen armies\\". In 1794, as far as surviving sources disclose, he disappeared for three years. He resurfaced in 1797, still based in Bruges, as a member of the departmental council for the recently created department of Lys, in a by now greatly enlarged version of France. The departmental council quickly became indistinguishable, in terms of its membership and principal activities, from its Ancien R√©gime precursor. 1802 marked the start of his lengthy incumbency as chairman of the departmental council. =Mayor of Brugge= In addition, de Croeser was appointed Mayor of Brugge in 1803, remaining in post without a break till 1813. He was succeeded by Jean-Jacques van Zuylen van Nyevelt who after 1815 combined his civic responsibilities with membership of the Dutch parliament (\\"Tweede Kamer der Staten-Generaal\\"). However, in 1817 van Nyevelt abruptly withdrew from both national and city politics, probably in order to spend more time with his young second wife and their expanding family. Karel Aeneas de Croeser then returned to office as the city's mayor, serving between 1817 and his resignation in 1827. There was much that de Croeser did for the city. The arrival of French revolutionary invaders in 1794 had marked the start of a new age of government mandated secularism, and in 1800 he organised the removal of the great bell from the Church of Our Lady (\\"Onze-Lieve- Vrouwekerk\\") and had it rehung in the city belfry. In its new position the bell was first rung in order to celebrate the Treaty of Amiens, celebrated by politicians and historians on both sides as an important (if rather short- lived) triumph. As regards the bell tower, this would not be the last time that de Croeser provided for additions and enhancements to the bells that regulated business and life in the city. On the front of the belfry he had a large replacement statue of the Virgin Mary placed in the empty niche above the entrance, to replace the one that had been destroyed in the revolution a few years earlier. He had the Boeveriepoort (city gate) rebuilt in 1811. He also, in 1819, reinvigorated the \\"Noble Fraternity of the Holy Blood\\" after a two decades during which it had been repressed and subsequently become terminally dormant. One out of town project to which he devoted his energies was the development of the city's \\"Central Cemetery\\", a short distance outside the walls, along the route towards Oostkamp. The first burial there had taken place in 1787, but citizens had been reluctant to bury their deceased relatives outside the confines of the city, and it was only in 1804, under Mayor de Croeser, that burials within the city walls were ended. Prominent families were encouraged to set the right example, and he had a special mausoleum constructed at the cemetery for the bodies of leading citizens. His own was one of the first bodies to end up in it.  De Croeser and Napoleon  On 11 July 1803 de Croeser welcomed First Consul Napoleon to Brugge. He was clearly no great supporter of the new ruler, and was later reprimanded by the prefect (in an earlier life a Savoyard career diplomat) for having had the flag on the belfry lowered before Buonaparte had even left the city. The visit was subsequently celebrated with a painting by the establishment portraitist Joseph Denis Odevaere showing de Croeser and Napoleon, together with part of the first consul's horse). Completed in 1807, the painting still (in 2020) hangs in the city hall. When the artist embarked on his commission there was already available a portrait of de Croeser, possibly originally created as a preliminary study for another work. For his portrait of the two men together Odevaere carefully cut out the existing available portrait and had it carefully sewn in an appropriate position on his new canvas, with the result that keen eyed viewers may gain the initial impression that the portrait of the men together has at some stage been badly damaged and thereafter repaired. By the time of Napoleon's next visit to Bruges, a more portrait - arguably more impressive - portrait of Karel Aeneas de Croeser had been produced, by van der Donckt, which in 2020 was reportedly hanging in the city hall near the earlier, double portrait. During 1804 Napoleon promoted himself to the rank ot emperor, and by the time of for his second visit to Bruges, in 1810, had also discarded his wife. He arrived, instead, accompanied by a pretty new empress. The second visit was very much more cordial than the first, and Karel Aeneas de Croeser found himself awarded the prestigious Legion of Honour. The double portrait of the two men in the city hall was hastily amended to show the relevant insignia attached to the mayor's coat, which have also at some point found their way onto the Van der Donckt portrait.  Two homes  De Croeser owned a substantial house in the Gouden-Handstraat (literally \\"Golden Hand street\\"), but for much of each year he lived out of town at Ten Berge, a large castelated manor house a short distant outside the city, to the north. He owned an extensive library and family archive which inlcuded much written material from the sixteenth century historian Nicolaas Despars, some of which was later re-puboished during the nineteebth century. The archive also included the De Hooghe manuscript and the important Gruuthuse manuscript. There was, in addition, a large collection of ancestral portraits.  Family  Karel-Aeneas de Croeser married Anna de Carnin de Staden (1747-1803) in 1777. The marriage was followed by the births of the couple's four sons. Two of the four married and became patriarchs in their own right, but the family line is believed to have died out with the death of Alexandre de Croeser (1839 - 1903). He had married Euph√©mie de Ruysscher (1835-1911), but their only child was born dead.

In 2016, Clemens assumed the role of editor-in- chief of the American Journal of Sociology, the discipline's first journal in the United States, from Andrew Abbott who had held the position since 2000. = The People's Lobby = Clemens's first book The People's Lobby: Organizational Innovation and the Rise of Interest Group Politics in the United States, 1890-1925, which derived from her dissertation research, argues that beginning in the late nineteenth century American politics was transformed from a system oriented around political party organizations and elections to one oriented around interest groups. This shift was instigated by what Clemens refers to as 'the people's lobby', groups of citizens and voters that influenced party politics through novel forms of civic engagement, which bypassed traditional political processes. Clemens investigates the emergence of the people's lobby across the American states California, Washington, and Wisconsin, arguing that federalism allowed for distinct regional variations. The book was awarded the American Sociological Association's Section on Organizations, Occupations, and Work's Max Weber Book award in 1998 as well as the Political Sociology Section's Outstanding Contribution to Political Sociology award in 1999. Clemens's research developed in The People's Lobby is regarded as engaging with theories of sociological institutions with a focus on organizational innovation. Her scholarship on institutions has been discussed in reviews of sociological literature on social movements and institutionalism.

Following work at the Mental Health Study Center of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Kelly held tenured positions at Ohio State University, the University of Michigan, the University of Oregon (where he was Dean of the Wallace School of Community Service and Public Affairs), and UIC. Jim Kelly was a participant in the 1965 Swampscott Conference, an NIMH-sponsored event that was the origin of Community Psychology in the U.S. Throughout his long and exemplary career, Kelly became internationally known for his ecological perspective in Community Psychology. He understood that this new field would need new ways of thinking and acting, so read and integrated ideas from biological ecology to develop his seminal contribution of the ecological metaphor. His ecological thinking placed heavy emphasis on the importance of settings as resources for the health of communities. This approach has been employed across disciplines to design health and mental health research and the development of prevention programs in local communities. His focus was on understanding the interdependent connections between the individual and the community. A symposium on Jim Kelly‚Äôs contributions to Community Psychology and so many scholars in the field was presented during the eighth biennial meeting of the Society for Community Research and Action in Atlanta in 2001 and captured by Hayes, et al. He received the 1978 Distinguished Contribution Award and the 2001 Seymour Sarason Award from the Society for Community Research and Action (Division 27 of the American Psychological Association). He also received the Distinguished Contribution to the Public Interest from the American Psychological Association in 1997.  Early life  Kelly was born in Cincinnati, Ohio the only child of James Gordon Kelly and Cosmo Belle Gray. The elder Kelly was a foreman in the shipping department of Procter and Gamble. The younger Kelly attended West Oakley Elementary School and Walnut Hills High School (WHHS) in Cincinnati where he graduated in 1948. In high school, he developed his interest in jazz and baseball and was a radio announcer, actor, and sportswriter. He aspired to be a baseball announcer. He worked in a delicatessen after school and on weekends for cash to attend jazz events and games of the Cincinnati Reds. In December of his sophomore year (1945) his father died suddenly of a heart attack. High school faculty, friends, his grandmother, and parents of friends became important sources of support and advice. During the summer before entering college, he read: Listening with the Third Ear by Theodor Reik which was influential in his later work with community-organizations and developing his ecological model.  Education  Jim Kelly first attended Miami University of Ohio, but transferred to the University of Cincinnati to save on tuition costs. He graduated from the University of Cincinnati with Honors in Psychology in 1953. He received a Masters from Bowling Green University and a doctorate in Clinical Psychology from the University of Texas at Austin. During his Doctoral Training, he published with Robert Blake and Wayne Holtzman. He completed his doctoral dissertation in 1958 with Louis J. Moran testing the construct validity of concepts within George A. Kelly‚Äôs Personal Construct Theory. Kelly then studied with Erich Lindemann, a Harvard community psychiatrist, who left a lasting impression on him. He helped write the Community Mental Health and Social Psychiatry: A Reference Guide published for this new field of Community Mental Health by Harvard University Press in 1962. He then studied with Gerald Caplan at the Harvard School of Public Health on mental health consultation methods that were becoming an example of additional mental health resources available to public health nurses, classroom teachers, and community leaders. He received a Master‚Äôs in Public Health from Harvard while also working with Gerald Caplan and Donald Klein. To fulfill his requirement for his military draft deferment he joined the U.S. Public Health Service in 1960 where he was assigned to the Mental Health Study Center, a Field Station of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Prince George's County.  Academic career  Jim Kelly joined the Department of Psychology at Ohio State University (OSU) as an associate professor in 1964. He was drawn to OSU because George Kelly was there and Jim Kelly had done some early work on applying George Kelly's ideas. Jim Kelly's first research study at OSU explored the way students interact with each other and the faculty in high schools that varied in population exchange. Kelly identified different coping styles for students and faculty at each school. This experience encouraged him to test out his ideas that population exchange had affected student mental health. Kelly was recruited to the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1966. He was awarded a 6-year grant from the NIMH to study how junior high school boys with different needs to explore the school environment adapted to two schools with high and low turnover rates. The study supported his notion that person-environment fit was an important consideration for the boys‚Äô coping success as they transitioned to high school. The study also resulted in a book that included seven reports of doctoral students who worked on the project and commentaries by the high school administration in each school. This became a seminal work for those interested in how person-environments interact to support or hinder active coping. Kelly became Dean of the Lila Acheson Wallace School of Community Service and Public Affairs at the University of Oregon in 1972. He was Dean until 1981 when he left for his last full-time academic position in the Department of Psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Soon after arriving in Chicago, he published a book on the research process with Ricardo Munoz and Lonnie Snowden. This book included interviews with prominent community psychology researchers to learn about the process of how they conducted their research, rather than the specific outcomes. He continued his commitment to book-length writing with doctoral students at UIC and other colleagues that included lessons learned in the process of community intervention and consultation and research methods in community settings At the University of Illinois at Chicago Kelly received an invitation by the Illinois Department of Health to conduct an action research project with the Developing Communities Project (DCP) in the Roseland area of South Chicago. In keeping with his philosophy of community participation and shared ownership in his research projects, Kelly requested that the Director and the Executive Committee help develop a Planning Committee that would be evaluated by an outside organization. The project lasted over ten years as he applied his ideas of creating an eco-identity, developing trust with community partners, and identifying local competencies that filled different niches in the successful development of DCP. The Planning Committee developed the metaphor that each member of DCP had a tree of personal interests and skills. These competencies formed the structure and branches of the tree. The idea was to help create an organizational structure and process that would enable each citizen to collaborate in a manner that was compatible with their own preferences and talents. This work resulted in several seminal works about community leadership and action research that have been guiding community- based researchers since they were published. They represent his last large project and a culmination of topics and research questions that developed from his goals expressed at the earliest stages of his career. = Research = Kelly's most important contributions to the field of psychology are the applications of ecological theory from biology to Community Psychology and other sub-disciplines within psychology focused on the development, implementation, and evaluation of prevention interventions. The initial publication of ecological concepts by Kelly was the book: Research Contributions from Psychology to Community Mental Health. This contribution was based on two papers he presented at the 1967 meeting of the American Psychological Association ‚ÄúThe Ecology of Adaptation‚Äù and ‚ÄúTowards a Theory of Preventive Interventions‚Äù. He spent the subsequent 50-plus years demonstrating how to think and act ecologically in collaborating with diverse community groups and organizations on issues defined by the local residents. A compilation of his writings on ecological thinking, Becoming Ecological: An Expedition Into Community Psychology, is a classic text for community psychologists. Kelly‚Äôs ecological model focused on four key constructs from biological ecology that he applied to human systems and designing community- based intervention: 1) Interdependence; 2) Adaptation; 3) Resource Cycling: and 4) Succession. Interdependence is the idea that a program is connected to other aspects of the context in which it operates including behaviors other than the ones that are the focus of the intervention, other programs that may exist in the organization or community in which the intervention is located, and the cultural context in which the program operates. Adaptation applies to the idea that all interventions need to be able to adapt to changing environmental circumstances so they need to be organized in a flexible and modifiable fashion from the start. Resource Cycling focuses attention on the resources that must be obtained and managed over time including space, staff skills, financial, and other assets critical for organizational success. Succession is the idea that past history of any context needs to be considered for any new program development and that these considerations need to be integrated into planning for sustainability. This framework of applying ecological concepts to community-based work was a constant theme in his action research. He also applied these concepts in the teaching of his graduate course on Social Adaptation which focused on program development and implementation. His role in the development of the ecological metaphor for understanding and changing human communities shifted thought in Psychology and related fields such as Education and Public Health. His ecological ideas have become fundamental aspects of Community Psychologists‚Äô work worldwide. His ecological thinking also informed his work on the process of change and the development of academic-community partnerships which are guiding principles in Community Psychology. These include the development of trust by honoring local context and cultural humility and giving away the by-line so that the researcher is not the focus of the collaboration. He wrote about these ideas in some of his earliest works which he compiled into the book Becoming Ecological: An Expedition Into Community Psychology at the urging of colleagues and students. Kelly‚Äôs ecological ideas expanded to include a focus on structures and processes which he describes in his chapter for the Handbook of Community Psychology. He and his colleagues present four concepts for defining structure and four concepts for defining processes within social systems that are part of an ecological approach. The four concepts for the structure are personal resource potential, social system resources, social settings, and system boundaries. The four concepts for ecological processes include: reciprocity, networking, boundary spanning, and adaptation, This chapter closes with a discussion of how values, norms, and roles may help or hinder the development of these 8 characteristics of structure and process. The chapter is a classic reading for understanding ecological applications for developing preventive interventions in community settings.

Harley's Dozen were twelve new peerages created in December 1711 by the British Tory government of Robert Harley which was struggling to gain a majority in the Whig-dominated House of Lords.Jones p.84 This came at a time when the government were negotiating peace terms to end the ongoing War of the Spanish Succession, which were unlikely to pass the Lords where opposition Whigs and some Tories had joined together to block them under the slogan \\"No Peace Without Spain\\". Two of the men, Lord Bruce and Lord Compton, were heirs to existing earldoms and were advanced to the house in their own right using their father's baronies. Others included Harley's son- in-law George Hay, George Granville, Thomas Mansel, Thomas Trevor, Thomas Foley all of whom were close political allies of the First Minister.Hill p.173 Most controversial was that of Samuel Masham, the husband of Queen Anne's favourite Abigail Hill, a cousin and ally of Harley. While Bruce's letters patent were dated 31 December 1711, the other creations all took place on the subsequent day 1 January 1712. When Parliament resumed on 2 January they took their seats. Because their numbers resembled that of a jury, the Whig Lord Wharton mockingly asked if they were going to speak individually or elect a foreman to do so. Despite the controversy Harley was able to subsequently pass the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. However, the narrow Tory majority in the Lords disappeared in 1714 following the Hanoverian Succession when the Tory government was replaced by George I.Colley p.61 Harley's alleged abuse of royal power and the violation of the constitution were part of the articles of impeachment against him in 1715.Jones p.84 In 1719 partly in a response to Harley's earlier creations, the Whig government of James Stanhope proposed a Peerage Bill which would have largely limited further expansion of the House of Lords. However, this was defeated and the size of the Lords continued to grow during the eighteenth century.

The opening is named after the bong, a device designed for smoking cannabis and tobacco. Description As a joke opening, the Bongcloud enjoys a cult following within the online chess community. The opening goes against many basic chess principles, including protecting the king and piece coordination. In playing the Bongcloud, white almost immediately puts their king in danger, blocks the diagonals of the bishop and queen, and loses castling privileges, all of which are considered crucial for viable strategies in competitive chess. The opening is referred to as the \\"King David's Attack\\" in some sources (particularly as a response to the Sicilian), and has been called \\"rather silly\\". High-level usage The Bongcloud Attack has been widely popularized by Grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura. In 2018 Nakamura played the Bongcloud three times against GM Levon Aronian during the Chess.com Speed Chess Championship, winning one of the three games. Nakamura also played the Bongcloud against GM Vladimir Dobrov and GM Wesley So during the 2019 Speed Chess Championship, winning both of those matches. Nakamura further popularized the opening in a YouTube and Twitch series called \\"Bongcloud Speedrun to 3000 - Aim HIGH\\". On September 19, 2020, Nakamura used the attack against GM Jeffery Xiong in the final round of the online St. Louis Rapid and Blitz tournament and won the game. Magnus Carlsen has his own variation of the Bongcloud where he plays c3, f3, Qa4, Qh4, Kd1, and Qe1, essentially switching the positions of the King and Queen, which takes at least 6 moves to perform and gives a severe handicap to the opponent.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_6Zl1jNWYQ His win over Wesley So in a 2020 blitz tournament where he played 1.f3 (see Barnes Opening) and then 2.Kf2 has also been referred to as the Bongcloud.

Prime Minister of Afghanistan Mohammed Daoud Khan represented the Kingdom of Afghanistan at the 1961 First Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade. History =Soviet intervention in Afghanistan= Yugoslav diplomacy was highly alarmed by the 1979 Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, which similarly to Yugoslavia was at the time a non-aligned and socialist country outside of the Warsaw Pact. Yugoslavia officially condemned Soviet intervention and expressed \\"astonishment\\" and \\"deep concern\\" about developments in Afghanistan. The intervention happened when President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito health situation deteriorated with perception that Moscow is waiting for Tito to die in order to renew its pressure on Belgrade. The funeral of Josip Broz Tito turned into the largest state funeral in history. Yugoslavia insisted that the Non-Aligned Movement organize a special ministerial meeting where Soviet intervention would be condemned, kind of action which until then was always reserved for Western countries. India was not ready to support the Yugoslav initiative fearing it will strengthened position of Pakistan and China, while Cuba, the chair of the Movement at the time, was in fact closely aligned with Soviet Union.

Having emerged from the youth choir as a group singer, Hettiarachchi has been able to show his talents and sang several popular songs such as Mal Mal Vile, Amma Jeewana, Oya Nisa Mage Sina, Kelesaka Keewath and Nawala Annasi.  Personal life  Chandrasena was born on 7 September in Garagoda, Yatiyanthota as the third child of a rural family with six siblings. His father Hettiarachchige Gunawardena was a mason. His mother Waliwita Vidanelage Mary Nona worked in a rubber plantation. He has one elder brother, one elder sister and three younger sisters. He educated at Garagoda Sinhala Junior College. His mother died on 18 October 2018 at the age of 84. After school times, he went to work at Mahaweli Development Board in Bathalayaya. He had to cut down forests, roads and drains. However after taking first salary, he quit from the job. Then he packed a box full of plastic items and went from house to house selling them. He is married to Mangalika Hettiarachchi. The couple has one son Gayana Madhuwantha and one daughter; Lihini Vihanga. His daughter Lihini is also a singer who started career with the song Irai Hadai. Then she sang the songs, Tharu Dilena Ambare and Man Gawa Thani Wechchi. Lihini went to three schools. She was educated at the Sri Sangamitta Girls' College, Colombo. After that she moved to Gothami Balika in Colombo from the grade six to eleven. Finally studied A/L at Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo. She is currently an undergraduate at the University of Jayewardenepura. Career Since child age, Hettiarachchi participated in the singing competitions for the Sinhala New Year, Vesak and Poson where he was first in all these competitions. He wrote and mailed a song in his own words such as \\"Jayabhumi Sri Lanka - Rakaganna Jaya Bhumi Lanka\\" for a singing competition. In 1979 Youth Awards, he sang the first song Jayabhumi Sri Lanka at the Kegalle Girls' College. Hettiarachchi became the first from the Kegalle district and later competed in the All Island competition and became the first. In 1980, he joined with the youth choir which was first established by the National Youth Services Council (earlier known as Bellwood Music Academy) on September 01. Hettiarachchi learned music under the music teachers Premadasa Mudunkotuwa and Sisira Kumara Marasinghe. His contemporaries of the choir consist with Somasiri Medagedara, Marshall Janatha, Chandralekha Perera, Dhammika Karunaratne and Theja Damayanthi. Musicians Shirley Vaijayantha and Nihal Gamhewa were the lyricists. He sang the first duet Seetha Kandu Yaye with Chandralekha at the Batangala Training Center. His first recorded song was Lo Satha Hata Setha Sedu. But the first song that first popularized was Thavalam Api Yanawa, composed at the Bellwood Television Village. At Bellwood, he recorded two more songs; Sede Samayay Jeewithe and Yeheliyaka Se. Meanwhile, the artists in the youth choir made a music cassette called \\"Yowun Gee 1\\" under the banner \\"Sangeetha Samagama\\". On 20 September 2014, the concert 'Senehase Gee ‚Äì Oya Nisa' was held at the Maharagama Youth Services Council Theater to celebrate 35 years of singing career. On 7 September 2018, the concert 'Senehase Gee ‚Äì Thawalama' was held at 6.30 pm at the Maharagama Youth Services Council Theater to celebrate 40 years of singing career.

S. A., Inc. v. Jackson, 587 U.S. ___ (2019), was a United States Supreme Court case which determined that a third-party defendant to a counterclaim submitted in a state-court civil action cannot remove their case to federal court. The Court explained, in a 5‚Äì4 decision, that although a third-party counterclaim defendant is a \\"defendant to a claim,\\" removal can only be performed by the defendant to a \\"civil action.\\"Home Depot U. S. A., Inc. v. Jackson, 139 S.Ct. 1743, 1744 (2019). And this holds true even when the counterclaim is in the form of a class action. The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 permits removal by \\"any defendant to a class action\\" but this does not extend removal rights to a third-party counterclaim defendant because they are not a defendant to the original case.Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1745.28 U.S.C. ¬ß1453(b). Although the decision technically only governs what court hears‚Äîrather than the actual outcome of‚Äîa particular case, the ruling has been described as being \\"pro-consumer\\" because of its potentially broader implications. The practical effect of the Court's holding is to make it \\"more difficult for class action defendants to transfer their cases from plaintiff- friendly state courts to more business-friendly federal courts.\\" As such, while the case theoretically only deals with venue, it may in practice benefit consumers with plausible claims against corporations. Justice Samuel Alito, in the dissenting opinion, argued that a plaintiff who brings a lawsuit in their \\"own state's courts might ... enjoy ... a home court advantage against outsiders.\\"Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1751 (Alito, J., dissenting). To that end, he explained, Congress opened the \\"federal courts to certain disputes between citizens of different states.\\" While plaintiffs could take this option by simply filing their case in federal court, defendants did not have control over where a case was filed. So defendants were given the right of removal, which could be invoked to transfer a case from state to federal court. By denying removal here, Justice Alito argued, the majority had denied the defendant a \\"neutral forum.\\"  Legal background  Diversity jurisdiction refers to the jurisdiction of the federal courts over cases which involve citizens from multiple states. The purpose of such jurisdiction is to protect \\"litigants against potential prejudice in state courts\\" stemming from them being citizens of another state. For diversity jurisdiction to apply, however, there must be \\"complete diversity,\\" such that \\"in cases with multiple parties no plaintiff could share citizenship with any defendant.\\" There are two ways a case in diversity could end up in federal court: either the plaintiff files it there or the defendant invokes the right of removal after the plaintiff files the case in federal court. This case concerns the right of removal and, more specifically, who is entitled to invoke it and under what circumstances. = Removal to federal court = As relevant here, there are two laws which govern removal to federal court: 28 U.S.C. ¬ß1441 (the \\"general removal statute\\") and the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (\\"CAFA\\").Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-2, at https://www.congress.gov/109/plaws/publ2/PLAW-109publ2.pdf. The first provides for the removal of \\"any civil action over which a federal court would have original jurisdiction.\\"28 U.S.C. ¬ß1441(a). But such removal is only by \\"the defendant or the defendants\\" acting collectively. CAFA, on the other hand, authorizes the removal of a \\"class action\\" by \\"any defendant without the consent of all defendants.\\" The scope of the removal statutes is considered important because the forum a case is heard in can effect not just the outcome of the case itself but also what legal rules apply throughout the proceedings. For example, the Federal Judicial Center has noted the \\"establishment by federal judges of rules of decision that diverged from those of the state courts.\\" And \\"federal courts are widely considered to be more business- friendly than state courts.\\" As a result, removal to federal court is a \\"typical corporate tactic.\\" CAFA was enacted in response to the failure of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, which had targeted \\"perceived abuses of the class-action vehicle in litigation involving nationally traded securities, including spurious lawsuits, vexatious discovery requests, and manipulation by class action lawyers of the clients whom they ... represent.\\"Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1752 (Alito, J., dissenting).Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. v. Dabit, 547 U.S. 71, 81 (2006). These abuses, Congress concluded, \\"often forced\\" companies to \\"enter extortionate settlements in frivolous cases, just to avoid the litigation costs.\\" The Reform Act responded to these perceived problems by limiting possible money awards from class actions as well as curbing the recoverable attorney's fees from such suits. The Act also mandated \\"sanctions for frivolous litigation\\" and paused \\"discovery pending resolution of any motion to dismiss.\\" Businesses viewed federal courts as more sympathetic forums Because the Reform Act tilted the federal playing-field decisively in favor of corporate defendants, consumer lawyers \\"found a workaround.\\" Litigants could avoid the Reform Act's restrictions by simply pursuing their case in state court instead. Once their case made its way to state court, because diversity jurisdiction did not apply in the absence of complete diversity, plaintiffs could block federal removal by simply adding an \\"in-state defendant.\\" Prior to the Reform Act, \\"state- court litigation of ... class actions had been rare,\\" but \\"within a decade state courts were handling most such cases.\\"Merrill Lynch, 547 U.S., at 82.S. Rep. No. 109-14, p. 4 (2005). CAFA sought to change this by making it \\"easier for defendants to remove to federal courts\\" without the support of every defendant. This meant that an out-of-state defendant could remove a class action even if there was an in-state defendant who could not. = Third-party counterclaim = To circumvent CAFA's more generous removal provisions, consumer lawyers devised yet another tactic. This approach involved bootstrapping a class action in the form of a third-party counterclaim to an already-existing lawsuit against a consumer. For example, when a consumer is sued for an unpaid bill relating to the business they intend to sue, they would file a third-party countercomplaint against that business containing the claim they originally planned to sue the business for. The theory supporting this approach was that the third-party defendant would be unable to remove the case because, although they were a defendant to a \\"claim,\\" they were not a defendant to the original \\"civil action.\\"Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1754 (Alito, J., dissenting). Corporate lawyers fought back against this strategy by asserting that CAFA expanded who was eligible to remove a class action to the category of \\"any defendant.\\" And because, in their view, a third-party counterclaim defendant \\"qualifie[d] as one of 'the defendants' for purposes of removal,\\" they reasoned that \\"such a party qualifies as 'any defendant' for purposes of [CAFA].\\"Carrington, Sarah E (Nov. 9, 2018). Merits Brief for Home Depot in No. 17-1471, p. 13. That disagreement gave rise to this Supreme Court case.  Background  This case began in June 2016 when Citibank filed a debt-collection lawsuit against George Jackson, a North Carolina man, in North Carolina state court. The lawsuit alleged that Jackson had failed to make required payments \\"incurred on a Home Depot credit card.\\"Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1747. Jackson responded by filing a countercomplaint, which included claims against Citibank, as well as third-party class action claims against Home Depot‚Äîa corporation headquartered and domiciled out-of-state‚Äîand Carolina Water Systems, an in-state corporation. In his countercomplaint, Jackson alleged that Home Depot and Carolina Water Systems had conspired to \\"induce homeowners to buy water treatment systems at inflated prices.\\" On a legal level, Jackson charged that this scheme involved unlawful referral sales and deceptive and unfair trade practices in violation of state law.Gen. Stat. Ann. ¬ß¬ß 25A-37, 75-1.1 (N. Cal. 2013) Jackson's claim against Citibank was that it was jointly and severally liable for this scheme and that \\"his obligations under the sale were null and void.\\" In September 2016, Citibank agreed to \\"dismiss its claims against Jackson.\\" A month after that, Home Depot removed the case to federal court, invoking various provisions of federal law, including the general removal statute and CAFA.28 U.S.C. ¬ß1332.28 U.S.C. ¬ß1446.28 U.S.C. ¬ß1453. Jackson filed a motion to remand the case to state court, contending that a third-party defendant was not permitted to remove a case to federal court. The District Court agreed and remanded the case to the state court. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  Supreme Court  On April 23, 2018, lawyers for Home Depot filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, presenting the question: \\"Whether an original defendant to a class-action claim can remove the class action if it otherwise satisfies the jurisdictional requirements of the Class Action Fairness Act when the class action was originally asserted as a counterclaim against a co- defendant.\\"Carrington, Sarah E (Apr. 23, 2018). Petition for Certiorari in No. 17-1471, at https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1471/44281/20180423113333374_Home%20Depot%20Petition.pdf. In their petition, the lawyers argued that a third-party counterclaim defendant is a \\"defendant\\" permitted to remove a case to federal court under the general removal statute, and that, in any event, CAFA authorizes removal by \\"any defendant,\\" which includes third-party counterclaim defendants. Jackson's attorneys filed a brief opposing certiorari on June 25, 2018. In their brief, they argued the Court should not intervene because every court of appeals to consider the question to that point had agreed with their position, meaning there was no circuit split to resolve.Warwick, Brian (June 25, 2018). Brief in Opposition in No. 17-1471, p. 11, at https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/17/17-1471/51234/20180625145126000_17-1471%20Home%20Depot%20v.%20Jackson%20Brief%20in%20Opposition.pdf. They further argued that the decisions of the appeals courts were consistent with relevant Supreme Court precedent, weakening the case for review.Brief in Opposition, p. 18. After the petitioner filed a reply to Jackson's brief on July 10, the Court granted certiorari on September 27. = Oral arguments = The Court heard arguments in this case on January 25, 2019. William P. Barnette appeared on behalf of the petitioner, Home Depot, and began by observing that Home Depot was \\"just a defendant,\\" because Congress established a dichotomy between the two types of parties to a case: plaintiffs and defendants. As Home Depot was not a plaintiff, Barnette reasoned, they must be a defendant. As such, he contended that they were within the scope of both CAFA and the general removal statute. Barnette made this argument to get around an earlier decision of the Court (Shamrock Oil & Gas Corporation v. Sheets), which concerned whether a regular counterclaim defendant could remove their claim to federal court.Transcript of Oral Argument in No. 17-1471, p. 4, at https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2018/17-1471_2cp3.pdf. In Shamrock Oil, the Court concluded that removal was not permitted because the counterclaim defendant was the original plaintiff and therefore the one who originally chose to file the case in state court. Barnette tried to distinguish Shamrock Oil by arguing that while the counterclaim defendant in that case was the original plaintiff (and therefore not a defendant), Home Depot was not an original party to this case: it only became a party as a defendant to the counterclaim. Hence, his observation that Home Depot was \\"just a defendant.\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned Barnette's reasoning. She pointed out that, \\"putting this outside the class action setting, ... all defendants have to agree to removal\\" and Jackson was also a defendant in this action. She wondered why Home Depot therefore would not \\"need Jackson's approval to remove.\\" Barnette replied that the drafters of the general removal statute wanted to make sure that every side would \\"have one shot at a ... federal forum\\" and would not have wanted to give a counterclaim plaintiff a veto over removal by a counterclaim defendant.Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 5. Justice Sotomayor doubted this interpretation, noting that the law actually enacted by the drafters says that defendants only \\"have a shot at removal\\" if \\"all defendants ... agree.\\" Barnette justified his position by asserting that the counterclaim plaintiff was a \\"defendant\\" only to the original action, but that the third-party counterclaim was effectively a separate action. Justice Neil Gorsuch asked how \\"the word 'defendant' expands and contracts like that,\\" so as to include the original defendant only for certain purposes.Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 8. Barnette argued that a defendant who files a counterclaim \\"steps into the role of plaintiff\\" and ceases to be a defendant for those purposes.Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 10. In the end, Barnette's position was that the Court must evaluate who is a \\"defendant\\" for purposes of removal claim by claim. After Barnette concluded, F. Paul Bland began his argument for the respondent. Bland contended that the relevant section of the general removal statute spoke of \\"civil actions\\" while other sections, which were not at issue in this case, spoke of \\"claims.\\"Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 34. In Bland's view, this discrepancy was proof that if the general removal statute meant to adopt Barnette's claim-by-claim interpretation, it would have said so by referring to \\"claims,\\" not \\"civil actions.\\" Chief Justice John Roberts criticized this view, suggesting that whenever one party is suing another party, including in the case of a counterclaim, \\"even if you don't think that's a civil action properly conceived, it's certainly a proceeding of some kind.\\" Bland replied that while it may be a proceeding of some kind, removal is only available in the case of a \\"civil action.\\" Bland also argued that removal would not apply because the initial complaint by Citibank against Jackson was not within the \\"original jurisdiction\\" of the federal courts, and only a case within such jurisdiction can be removed.Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 39. Justice Alito asked if the case would have qualified for removal if the counterclaim was in the original complaint, and Bland confirmed it would have.Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 38. But Bland, in responding to a question from Justice Elena Kagan, agreed that original jurisdiction is determined \\"at the beginning,\\" so a later counterclaim cannot create original jurisdiction. Later in the argument, Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked Bland whether Home Depot was a \\"defendant\\" under CAFA. Bland replied that it was not because it was a \\"third-party claim defendant.\\"Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 55. Justice Kavanaugh criticized this distinction, pointing out that CAFA encompasses \\"any defendant.\\" Bland, however, argued that the phrase \\"defendant\\" had a fixed meaning under the general removal statute which did not include third-party counterclaim defendants and inserting the word \\"any\\" could not change the meaning of \\"defendant.\\" As an analogy, he referred to the phrase \\"any rabbit,\\" and pointed out that the use of \\"any\\" does not \\"mean that a weasel or a gerbil becomes a rabbit.\\"Transcript of Oral Argument, p. 56. Chief Justice Roberts questioned the analogy, noting that while those other animals would not become rabbits, it \\"still means that a brown rabbit is a rabbit\\" and Bland himself had agreed that a third-party counterclaim defendant was a \\"type of defendant.\\" Bland finally responded that a third-party counterclaim defendant was a \\"defendant in a colloquial way,\\" but not under the general removal statute or, by extension, CAFA. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was not present for oral arguments in this case and Justice Clarence Thomas did not ask any questions. = Majority opinion = Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court Justice Thomas wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan. The opinion proceeds in three main parts, with Thomas first describing the case's legal backdrop, then reviewing the general removal statute and CAFA in turn. In the first part, Thomas explains that the \\"federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.\\"Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1746. As an initial matter, the Constitution \\"delineates the character of the controversies over which federal judicial authority may extend\\" and then the inferior courts are further limited \\"to those subjects encompassed within a statutory grant of jurisdiction.\\" Accordingly, for a federal court to exercise jurisdiction, there must at a minimum be a statutory basis for its jurisdiction. These principles set the stage for the Court's analysis because they assigned the burden of persuasion. To succeed, Home Depot would have needed to convince the Court that either the general removal statute or CAFA authorized removal. In the second part, Thomas concluded that the general removal statute did not authorize removal by Home Depot. Although he agreed with Home Depot and the dissenting Justices that it was \\"plausible\\" to count Home Depot as a \\"defendant\\" under the general removal statute, he did not believe this was the \\"best\\" way to read the statute.Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1748. Focusing on the text and structure of the statute and invoking as support a book written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Thomas reasoned that the broader context of the statute excluded \\"any counterclaim defendant, including parties brought into the lawsuit for the first time by the counterclaim.\\" The general removal statute authorizes the removal of any \\"civil action\\" over which the federal courts have \\"original jurisdiction,\\" provided the defendant to that action opts to remove it. To determine whether the federal courts have original jurisdiction over a civil action, Thomas explained, the courts evaluate \\"whether the plaintiff could have filed its operative complaint in federal court either because it raises claims arising under federal law or because it falls within the court's diversity jurisdiction.\\" The defendant to a counterclaim is not the defendant to the operative complaint, which means that they are outside the scope of the general removal statute. In further support of that conclusion, Thomas pointed to other uses of \\"defendant\\" in related contexts. For example, Thomas noted that Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which governs \\"Third-Party Practice,\\" distinguishes between \\"'the plaintiff,' a 'defendant' who becomes the 'third-party plaintiff,' and 'the third-party defendant' sued by the original defendant.\\"Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1749. Similarly, the language of Rule 12 \\"distinguishes between defendants and counterclaim defendants.\\" In light of all this, Thomas believed it was unlikely Congress meant for \\"defendant\\" in the general removal statute to include third-party counterclaim defendants. Thomas next turned to CAFA, concluding that Congress's use of \\"any defendant\\" did not change who constitutes a \\"defendant\\" for purposes of removal. Thomas reasoned that Congress did not \\"expand the types of parties eligible to remove a class action,\\" and instead merely clarified that \\"certain limitations on removal that might otherwise apply do not limit removal under [CAFA].\\"Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1750. Thomas also noted that because the phrase \\"defendant\\" is used in a number of other places across the removal statutes, accepting Home Depot's interpretation would result in some of those provisions becoming \\"incoherent.\\"Home Depot, 139 S.Ct., at 1751. Finally, Thomas rejected the argument that the Court should interpret the statute to prevent defendants from using \\"the statute as a 'tactic' to prevent removal,\\" observing that the tactic was a \\"consequence of the statute Congress wrote\\" and could only be changed by Congress. = Dissenting opinion = Justice Alito wrote the dissenting opinion Justice Alito wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. In his opinion, Alito argues that CAFA's use of \\"any defendant\\" expanded the reach of the general removal statute to third-party class-action counterclaim defendants, that the distinction between third-party counterclaim defendants and regular defendants is \\"irrational,\\" and that, by accepting Jackson's argument, the Court had wrongly given its blessing to a \\"tactic\\" which allowed consumer attorneys to deny businesses access to a \\"neutral forum.\\"  See also  * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 587 References Category:United States Supreme Court cases ","title":"Home Depot U.

Early career  Pyotr Zalutsky was the son of a peasant, born in Krucha, in the Mogilev province of Belarus. the son of a peasant. He joined the revolutionary movement as a teenager in 1904, took part in the 1905 revolution, and joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1907. He worked for the party, illegally, in Vladivostok, before moving to St. Petersburg in 1911, where he worked in a factory, and, as a member of the Petersburg Bolshevik organisation he helped organise distribution of the illegal newspapers, 'Pravda' and 'Zvezda'. At the time of the February Revolution, Zalutsky was a member of the three-man executive of the Petrograd (St Petersburg) committee of the Bolshevik organisation, along with Alexander Shliapnikov and Vyacheslav Molotov. As the most senior Bolsheviks at liberty in the capital, they ran the party until more senior figures returned from exile in Siberia or abroad, and set at one of radical hostility to the Provisional Government which took power after the Tsar had been overthrown. They were overruled when Stalin and Lev Kamenev returned from Siberia in March, but when Lenin arrived from Europe, in April, he backed the hard line that Zalutsky had taken. Zalutsky was a political commissar with the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. In 1921, he was appointed secretary of the Petrograd committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), and in 1923 was elected to the Central Committee.  Left Opposition  Zalutsky was a political ally of Grigory Zinoviev, the Leningrad (Petersburg/Petrograd) party boss who was a member of the triumvirate who assumed control while Lenin was terminally ill, in 1923. The triumvirate was at first united in its hostility to Leon Trotsky and the left opposition within the party. In 1924, Zalutsky wrote a pamphlet which called for Trotsky to be expelled from the CPSU, a position which even Stalin opposed at the time as too extreme.. But during 1925, the triumvirate split, as Zinoviev and Kamenev opposed what they regarded as Stalin's turn to the right. In October 1925, a party member named Leonov, who may have been working secretly for the Stalin faction, claimed to have been shocked to hear Zalutsky denounce the communist party leadership in private conversation for \\"creating a bourgeois state\\" and a \\"kingdom of peasant narrow-mindedness\\", treating Leningrad as a 'province', and working to bring about a \\"Thermidor\\", while likening Stalin to August Bebel, the German Marxist who tried to take a middle position between communists and social democrats. This case was referred to the Central Control Commission, and the Leningrad party committee received orders from Moscow to remove Zalutsky from his position as the provincial party secretary. He was removed from the Central Committee at the CPSU party congress in December 1925. He was expelled from the CPSU, with other members of the Left Opposition, in December 1927, but in June 1928, he joined other members of the former Zinoviev faction in submitting to the party line in order to have his party membership restored.  Arrest and death  In 1928-34, Zalutsky worked for the economic council for the Lower Volga, but was arrested, with Zinoviev and others, in December 1934, days after the assassination of the Leningrad party boss, Sergei Kirov, but near the end of that month it was announced that there was insufficient evidence to charge him, and that he would be sent into administrative exile. In fact, he was tried in secret and sentenced to five years in prison. Though his name was not mentioned when Zinoviev, Kamenev went on trial, in the first of the Moscow show trials in August 1936, he was rearrested in September, and sentenced to death at a secret hearing on January 10 1937.

History  Patrick Henry was born Centreville, Mississippi, and raised in Daytona Beach, Florida. Henry's grandfather is Samuel O'Quinn, an African American businessman and landowner who was murdered in front of his home in Centreville. This incident was accounted by multiple sources, most notably in the book, Coming of Age in Mississippi, by Ann Moody. Patrick Henry's brother, Derrick Henry, has been the sitting mayor of Daytona Beach, Florida since 2012. His sister, Dannette Henry, has been the Zone 5 Commissioner for Daytona Beach since 2016.  Education  Henry graduated from Bethune-Cookman University with a degree in Sociology in 1982.  Political career  Henry served as the Daytona Beach City Commissioner from 2010-2016 until he resigned to run for State Representative. Henry succeeded term-limited Democrat Dwayne Taylor as the representative for District 26, when he defeated Republican nominee Michael Cantu in the 2016 General Election. During his time in office, Henry secured almost $500 million in appropriation funding for projects in Volusia County. He worked in a bipartisan effort to pass legislation to replace a statue of a Confederate General with Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune. This honor made her the first African American to be chosen as one of two statues to represent a state in the United States Capitol. Henry sponsored many pieces of legislation, and was a member of many committees and subcommittees, including the Agriculture & Property Rights Subcommittee; Government Accountability Committee; Agriculture and Natural Resources Appropriations Subcommittee; Health Innovation Subcommittee; Oversight, Transparency & Administration Subcommittee.

In 1890, he wrote the song \\"The Man That Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo\\", reputedly inspired by the true story of Charles Wells. Wells was a confidence trickster who won some ¬£40,000 at the Monte Carlo casino, using the profits from earlier frauds, but was later imprisoned for obtaining money by false pretences. Gilbert attempted to sell the song to various entertainers, but the only one interested was Charles Coborn. He paid Gilbert ¬£10 for the rights to the song, and first sang it in late 1891.Charles Coborn, The Man who Broke the Bank, 1928, p. 228 The song became a success, and Coborn continued to perform it until his death. Gilbert also wrote other successful songs, notably \\"Down the Road\\" (1893) for Gus Elen, and \\"At Trinity Church I Met My Doom\\" (1894) for Tom Costello.

Background Patient safety is a health care discipline that emerged due to the growing complexity of health care systems and the rise of patient harm in health care facilities. Patient harm, due to adverse events, is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The available evidence suggests that hospitalization in low- and middle-income countries leads to 134 million adverse events annually, which in turn result in 2.6 million deaths. In high-income countries, approximately one in ten patients is harmed while receiving hospital care.\\"The economics of patient safety \\" OECD.

She is best known for promoting conspiracy theories about COVID-19, vaccinations and 5G technology. Shemirani has been described by The Jewish Chronicle as \\"one of the leading figures in a movement that has united QAnon obsessives with far-left and far-right activists\\". Shemirani describes herself as a \\"Natural Nurse in a Toxic World\\". She was suspended by the Nursing and Midwifery Council in July 2020, in response to complaints that she was spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and about vaccines. Prior to her activism, Shemirani promoted pseudoscientific and unproven alternative cancer treatments.  Biography  Shemirani is known for her promotion of conspiracy theories on topics related to vaccines and 5G telephone networks, in particular in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. She has presented her views at events alongside other conspiracy theorists such as David Icke, Piers Corbyn and Mark Steele. Shemirani believes that anyone who disagrees with her or accuses her of lying must be \\"lying, misinformed or jealous.\\" She also believes that in particular, \\"overweight, envious nurses come in for particular criticism\\" will disagree with her because as she stated during an interview:  Promotion of conspiracy theories  = COVID-19 denialism = She describes the COVID-19 pandemic as a \\"plandemic\\" and a \\"scamdemic\\" and says that the coronavirus \\"does not exist\\". She has repeatedly stated that the lockdown is a conspiracy to control people. She believes that a vaccine for COVID-19 is going to be a \\"political tool to change people's DNA\\". In a video published in Spring of 2020, she said \\"Just before Christmas we had [been told] ‚Ä¶ we're all going to die of measles, Now we're suddenly all going to die of coronavirus. I'm not buying any of it‚Ä¶ I think it's really important that we don't just believe what the media tell us.\\" Shemirani has been suspended from Facebook several times for promoting harmful misinformation to her 54,000 followers, including linking 5G to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Hope Not Hate, who monitor online racism and conspiracy theories, her Facebook page describes the 9/11 attacks as a false flag, Satanic messages in music videos and the organised destruction of the nuclear family. By September 2020, her Facebook page had been removed. Shemirani has been the subject of complaints for likening measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic to Nazi war crimes and the Holocaust. She has referred to the COVID-19 lockdown and the National Health Service (NHS) as \\"Murder. Genocide. The NHS is the new Auschwitz\\". She asked in one post, \\"When are people going to wake up? \\"On the cattle truck? Or in the showers?\\" She believes that the government are behaving like the Nazis in their attempts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. She defended her statements by saying: The Jewish Chronicle investigated Shemirani and found that online she made references to Hitler and the Nazis when describing the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown and the NHS. Shemirani was a host and speaker at Resist and Act for Freedom, an protest event held at Trafalgar Square on 19 September 2020. The event gathered together protestors with a wide range of grievances relating to face masks, vaccinations, and a host of conspiracy theories. During her speech, she said that a vaccine for COVID-19 will mean that the government ‚Äúwill be able to look at every aspect of what‚Äôs going on in our brains‚Äú and ‚Äúnot only can they pick it up, they can download into us‚Äù. She also claimed, ‚ÄúThey want you all wearing a mask, there‚Äôs no science behind that mask. That mask is going to make you sick‚Äù. Whilst she was observing police officers amassing at the North West corner of the square, she urged members of the audience to confront the police. Protestors chanting \\"choose your side\\" formed a human blockade in order to prevent police actions and initially forced officers to retreat. Thirty protestors were arrested and the police dispersed the protest at approximately 3pm. A split in the campaign, with Steele and Shemirani on one side, and Icke and Corbyn on the other side, has been reported. = Antisemitism = Shemirani has espoused several anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. She stated in an interview that her ex-husband had taught her about the Committee of 300, she explained that he gave her ‚Äúan education in the New World Order, of the illuminati, the top families, who owns what. All the corruption, the murders, I knew all of that. But I never knew it would happen in my lifetime.‚Äù Shemirani contends that George Soros is responsible for the Black Lives Matter protests and online she compared him to the Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and showed images of Hitler and the Nazi swastika. She has promoted the anti-Semitic Committee of 300 conspiracy theory, a precursor of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion hoax. She believes Soros and Bill Gates are promoted what she thinks is an invented COVID-19 pandemic to their advantage. Shemirani thinks that abortions and Planned Parenthood are responsible for more black deaths than any other cause and that Soros funds the program. She also repeats QAnon conspiracy theories about figures in the US Democratic Party being \\"globalist\\", Satanic paedophiles. Shemirani promotes narratives that a kind of universal religious persecution operation exists and she believes that a large-scale conspiracy by the global elite is perpetrating the sexual abuse of children. She also claimed during a speech, ‚ÄúThe biggest cause of death amongst the American Black‚Ä¶ African Black American‚Ä¶ is abortion! They‚Äôre killing your babies before they even get out the womb! Who funds that? George Soros Planned Parenthood.‚Äù In May, she was interviewed for the American health website Vibe and espoused a conspiracy theory about the marriage Imran Khan and Jemima Goldsmith‚Äôs marriage. She claimed: = Satanism = Shemirani believes in Satanic cults and has tried to link them to various conspiracy theories about COVID-19, for example on 30 August she tweeted: In one of her speeches, she claimed:  Suspended as a nurse In June 2020, a virtual hearing of the Nursing and Midwifery Council, which regulates nursing and midwifery professions in the UK, gave Shemirani an interim suspension for 18 months. Shemirani's interim suspension was confirmed on 20 July 2020 in a hearing in which she was assisted by fellow conspiracy theorist Mark Steele who acted as her McKenzie friend. The reason for the suspension was to avoid risks of public harm, for promoting anti-vaccination and 5G networking conspiracy theories and claiming that the COVID-19 pandemic is a scam. Shemirani and Steele criticised the hearing for not listening to their facts about 5G and vaccination. Shemirani referred to nurses who carry out vaccinations as Nazis and to those who recognise the gravity of the pandemic as \\"complicit in the tyranny and lies\\". Steele described the Nursing and Midwifery Council as being complicit in genocide.  Personal life  Shemirani lives in Essex and has four children.

It was introduced in 1964 to meet the growing demand for louder amplifiers during the British Invasion era of rock and roll live performances. Most notable performers that used the AC50 was The Beatles as well as several other British pop rock bands during the mid to late 60's.  Amp Head  The head of the first AC50 MKI model originally had 2 inputs. 1 for a warmer \\"Normal\\" channel and another for a brighter \\"Brilliant\\" channel that sounds more comparable to a Vox AC30. The later MKII and MKIII models have 4 channels to meet the varied input needs of musicians. While the amp's output provided larger sound than the Vox AC30, the tube design called for two EL34 output tubes to achieve the power needed for tonal clarity. The preamp tubes were consistently one ECC82 (12AU7) tube and three ECC83 (12AX7) tubes. Early designs came outfitted with a GZ34 rectifier tube, while latter MKIII models housed a more predictable and stable diode rectifier to support the power supply.  Amp Cabinet  The AC50 many times accompanied the amplifier head with a speaker trolley cabinet loaded with Silver Alnico or Blue Alnico speakers and a Goodmans Midax Horn to push more bright clear sounds out into large crowds. The speaker trolley was cleverly designed to change in speaker tilt angle for adjusting down or up based on crowd locations beyond a main stage.

Early life Ludlow was born on August 2, 1750 in New York City to a long-established and wealthy New York family. He was the son of Gabriel Ludlow (1704‚Äì1773), a merchant, and Elizabeth (n√©e Crommelin) Ludlow (1715‚Äì1760). His sister, Elizabeth Ludlow, was the wife of Francis Lewis Jr. (brother of Gov. Morgan Lewis). From his father's first marriage to Frances Duncan, he had an elder half-brother, George Duncan Ludlow, who was appointed the first Chief Justice of New Brunswick in Canada in 1784. Another half-brother, Gabriel George Ludlow, was the first mayor of Saint John, New Brunswick (and the grandfather of Edward Hunter Ludlow). The first Ludlow in America was his grandfather, also named Gabriel Ludlow (1663‚Äì1736), who was born at Castle Cary and left Frome around 1694 to settle in New Amsterdam, and became a prominent and influential merchant, shipowner, landholder and longtime clerk of the New York General Assembly. He obtained a patent from King George II for a tract of 4,000 acres of land in what became Orange County, New York on the west bank of the Hudson River. His grandfather's grandfather, Thomas Ludlow, was the brother of both Gabriel Ludlow, Receiver of the Duchy of Lancaster during the reign of King Charles I, and Roger Ludlow, Deputy Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Through his maternal aunt, Mary (n√©e Crommelin) Verplanck, he was a first cousin of Gulian Verplanck, Speaker of the New York State Assembly who became president of the Bank of New York and in 1792 helped found the Tontine Association (a precursor of the New York Stock Exchange). The wealth and status of the Ludlow family gave Daniel and his elder half-brothers \\"several advantages, including education in a private school.\\" Career In 1765, his father sent him to Amsterdam in the Netherlands, to enter the counting house of Crommelin & Zoon, where his grandfather Charles Crommelin was a leader. During his five year tenure with the firm, Ludlow learned French, German, and Dutch in addition to learning the fundamentals of banking. After returning to New York around 1770, he joined his father‚Äôs mercantile business, which he took over after his father died in 1773. During the American Revolution, Ludlow was a Loyalist. Regarded as \\"arch-tory to the core,\\" his older brothers apparently \\"had no choice but to leave New York when the revolution was over,\\" though Daniel, remained and become a successful businessman. In 1783, following the end of the war, he joined the Chamber of Commerce. On January 1, 1784, he entered into a partnership with Edward Goold. In their first advertisement, a circular letter, they were vague about their line of business, but promised \\"to contribute to the Success of whatever Concerns may be entrusted to our Charge.\\" The firm likely imported goods on commission and on their own account were involved in marine insurance. In 1790, Ludlow dissolved the partnership to join his nephew, Gulian Ludlow, under the firm name Daniel Ludlow & Company. The company which was in business for fifteen years, was a marine insurer and a major importer of East India goods. It suffered significant underwriting losses during the Quasi-War with France in 1798, but recovered with the assistance from the bank of the Manhattan Company. In 1799, Ludlow became the first president of the Manhattan Company, which had been founded by Aaron Burr. Among the company's original stockholders were such men as Nicholas Fish, John Delafield, John Jacob Astor, Richard Varick, Stephen Van Rensselaer, Rev. John Rodgers, Joshua Sands, Peter Stuyvesant, George Clinton, Israel Disosway, John Slidell, Henry Rutgers, and Daniel Phoenix. In July 1800, the Bank started paying dividends and, in 1808, the company sold its waterworks to the city, pocketing $1.9 million dollars, and turned completely to banking.John Kendrick Bangs. Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Vol XCVIII No.DLXIII, December 1898, p971 et seq. \\"A Historic Institution: The Manhattan Company\\", p The same year, Henry Remsen, succeeded Ludlow as president of the company. In 1810, Ludlow moved to Skaneateles, New York when he purchased an extensive estate from Jacobus Annis (later known as the Anson Lapham place). Personal life On October 4, 1773, Ludlow married Arabella Duncan, a daughter of Thomas Duncan and Mary (n√©e Ketcham) Duncan. In 1764, the Duncan home, a 3-storey house in Pearl Street (then known as Queen Street), caught fire and burned to the ground, killing her mother and seven siblings in the nursery on the third floor. Only Arabella, her father and her sister Frances escaped. Frances later married their cousin and Daniel's elder half-brother, George Duncan Ludlow, in 1758. Their daughter, Frances Duncan Ludlow, was the second wife of Richard Harison, a law partner of Alexander Hamilton who served as the Recorder of New York City and the 1st U.S. Attorney for the District of New York. Together, the couple eleven children, five of whom lived to maturity, including: * Harriet Ludlow (b. 1774), who married Grove Wright, a New York merchant. * Daniel Ludlow Jr. (1779‚Äì1827), who became a partner in Daniel Ludlow & Co. and who died unmarried. * Robert Crommelin Ludlow (b. 1789), who married Mary Peters of Charleston, South Carolina. * Ferdinand Ludlow (b. 1790), a Lt. in the U.S. Navy, who died unmarried in Florence, Italy. * Edward Greenleaf Ludlow (1793‚Äì1877), a physician who married his cousin Mary Kennedy Lewis, a daughter of John Lewis and great- granddaughter of Francis Lewis, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, in 1828. After her death, he married Mrs. Van Horne. His wife Arabella died on December 7, 1803. Ludlow died at his country home at Skaneateles, New York on September 26, 1814. =Descendants= Through his eldest daughter Harriet, he was a grandfather of Henry Allen Wright, who married his cousin Louisa Ludlow Auchmuty (1805‚Äì1896), a resident of Newport, Rhode Island for fifty years. Through his son Edward, he was a grandfather of Arabella Duncan Ludlow (1844‚Äì1926), who married Edward Sherman Gould (1837‚Äì1905), a son of author Edward Sherman Gould.

Early life and career Nederburgh was the son of Advocate Herman Nederburgh, from The Hague and his wife Dina Adriana Spruyt. He obtained a law degree at Leiden University in 1782 and was appointed to various government posts. In 1785 he was appointed advocate of both the Council of State and the States General, being a very senior post for a young man of not even twenty-five. In 1787 he became the first advocate of the Dutch East India Company. Nederburgh married Elizabeth Geertruy Schelten on 9 October 1787. The Cape Colony As a result of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, the VOC began to experience serious financial problems. Nederburgh was commissioned to compile a report with the theme of how to save the VOC from collapse. His report led to his appointment with Simon Hendrik Frijkenius as Commissioners General in charge of the Company's possessions, with instructions to rectify matters abroad. Nederburgh and Frykenius arrived at the Cape on 18 June 1792 when they landed at Simon's Bay (present day Simon's Town). There the party was unloaded, and they had to continue on foot over land and reached Cape Town on 23 June 1792. From 3 July 1792, Nederburgh and Frijkenius, in their position as Commissioner-General, acted together as governors of the Cape Colony. They did away with certain governmental posts, combated smuggling and imposed new taxes, in an attempt to reduce expenditure and increase income. They granted the free burghers leave to export their products but, owing to lack of cargo space, this was of little benefit to the colonists. On 29 July 1793 Nederburgh wrote a letter to the Netherlands, informing the government that the mood at the Cape had been calmed. On 1 September 1793, he and Frijkenius handed over the administration to Abraham Josias Sluysken, former Director of the VOC in Suratte, who as a pensioner on his way to the Netherlands, had stopped in the Cape Colony. This was done because they did not form a high opinion of the acting governor, Johan Isaac Rhenius, and were of the opinion that he was not a suitable candidate.  Dutch East Indies  On 24 September 1793 Nederburgh and Frijkenius departed on their journey to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, where they arrived on 13 November 1793. In the Dutch East Indies, Nederburgh was confronted with numerous problems. One of the first challenges was the appointment of a new Director-General. The previous Director-General, H. van Stockum had already died in 1791. In spite of Frykenius's protests, Governor General Willem Arnold Alting, in collaboration with Nederburgh, appointed his own son in-law, Johannes Siberg, as Van Stockum's successor. Nederburgh usually got on well with Alting and Siberg, but clashes were unavoidable, particularly over the appointment and dismissal of officials and attempts to check corruption. As a result of these issues and during December 1795, Nederburgh requested the Lords XVII (Heren XVII) to be discharged. He learned only on 28 September 1799 that his request had been granted, whereupon he left Batavia on 12 October 1799.  Later career  On the way he stayed over at the Cape, which by that time was conquered by the English. When he resumed his journey, he was taken prisoner by an English frigate and transported to England but was freed on 16 July 1800. Upon his return to the Netherlands, he endured much criticism over his handling of matters in the Dutch East Indies. In 1803, he received an honourable discharge and the following year, he was appointed to the Asiatic Council. In 1806 he was made head of the first division for East Indian affairs and in 1809 he was appointed Director-General of the Public Treasury. Nederburgh died in at his home in 's-Gravenzande, the Netherlands on 3 August 1811.

When New Mexico was a territory, women had the right to vote in school board elections. When New Mexico created its state constitution in 1910, it continued to allow women to vote in school elections, but it was nearly impossible to modify the constitution for suffrage any further. Women in the state chose to pursue advocating for a federal women's suffrage amendment. They organized among both English and Spanish speaking groups. Many New Mexico politicians supported suffrage on a federal level. Continued advocacy on behalf of suffragists in the state allowed New Mexico to become the 32nd state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment on February 21, 2020.  Early efforts  Susan B Anthony by the Woman's Club of Albuquerque. Women under the Republic of Mexico in the land that became New Mexico had more rights than women in the United States did at the time. During the time that New Mexico was a territory of the United States, women were allowed to vote in school board elections. In the 1890s, women's clubs began to form in New Mexico, and these served as a way for women to communicate and advocate for various causes. Clubs formed in Las Vegas, New Mexico, Santa Fe, Las Cruces and in Albuquerque. Many women in the clubs admired leaders in the national suffrage movement. The Woman's Club of Albuquerque celebrated Susan B. Anthony's 85th birthday in February of 1905. In 1910, New Mexico was eligible to become a state and a state constitutional convention was held. Just before the convening of the convention, the New Mexico Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) held a public debate on women's suffrage. This debate took place in August in Mountainair, New Mexico and featured the president of the University of New Mexico and a socialist. Most delegates to the convention did not women participating in politics. Nevertheless, during the convention which began on October 3, librarian, Julia Duncan Brown Asplund, attended each day and petitioned delegates to provide partial suffrage for women in the right to vote in school elections. Delegate Solomon Luna, uncle of prominent New Mexican suffragist, Nina Otero-Warren, and H.O Bursum were both pro-suffrage. Delegate Reuben Heflin, a Democrat from Farmington introduced the school election provision early on during the convention. On November 8, the convention's Committee on Elective Franchise sponsored a \\"motion to strike out the limited franchise for women.\\" Two of the delegates were very opposed to women voting even in school elections were Delegates Dougherty and Sena. Dougherty stated that he didn't believe women in New Mexico wanted to vote and Sena claimed that voting would lead to harm for women. After this, the Woman's Club of Albuquerque presented a petition for partial suffrage to the convention through Delegate Stover. The provision to allow women to vote did pass and was adopted in the final draft of the constitution which was passed on November 21. However, the constitution was also written in such a way that adding other voting rights would be difficult. The constitution required that three-fourths of all voters in each county in New Mexico would have to approve any changes to suffrage in the state.  Organizing  Women preparing to campaign in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Mabel Vernon was the first organizer from the Congressional Union (CU) to visit New Mexico arriving in 1914. She started recruiting within the state WCTU, but then later switched tactics, focusing on the more socially influential clubwomen in other groups. In May of 1914, another CU organizer, Jessie Hardy Stubbs, organized a suffrage demonstration in Santa Fe that led to the creation of the New Mexico Women's Suffrage League. One of the politicians who created obstacles for women in New Mexico who wanted full suffrage was Senator Thomas Benton Catron. A letter-writing campaign to Catron was kicked off in 1914. Women also visited him at his home in Santa-Fe and in Washington, D.C., lobbying for women's suffrage. Representative Benigno Cardenas Hernandez followed the lead of Senator Catron in his role in the House. The lobbying and work against Catron began to make him a \\"political liability to the Republicans.\\" Also in 1914, the national General Federation of Women's Clubs (GFWC) came out in support of women's suffrage and the New Mexico chapter, the New Mexico Federation of Women's Clubs (NMFWC) followed suit. In July of 1915, the CU built on the endorsement of women's suffrage from NMFWC and held drives to organize. On October 15, 1915, around 150 women of both Hispanic and Anglo backgrounds marched for women's suffrage in Santa Fe. The parade, which ended at the house of anti-suffrage Senator Catron, included suffragists Dolores Ch√°vez de Armijo, Aurora Lucero-White Lea, and Trinidad Cabeza de Baca who lent her car to the parade. Leaflets given out during the event were printed in both English and Spanish. Lucero and Arabella Romero were among the women who gave speeches in favor of women's suffrage at Senator Catron's home. Catron, however, was not persuaded and instead explained why he thought women's suffrage was wrong. The event also included a visit from Ella St. Clair Thompson from the Congressional Union. Deane Lindsey helped found a local suffrage organization in Santa Fe that October. Lucero-White Lea and Otero-Warren traveled across New Mexico, speaking primarily to Hispanic women on behalf of the CU. By 1916, the CU had created a New Mexico chapter. Dr. Jessie A. Russell from California came in 1916 to help organize women's clubs and to get women involved in the Republican Party. The Republicans had nominated Frank Hubbell to run against Catron, but Hubbell, while pro-suffrage was an unpopular candidate. Russell helped organize women politically and Russell tried to attract more progressive-leaning women. However, Hubbell was defeated, but so was Senator Catron, who lost to Andrieus Aristieus Jones. After Senator Catron lost in 1916, women's suffrage gained more support and success in New Mexico. Jones began to immediately work in the U.S. Senate to introduce women's suffrage as a federal amendment as chair of the Senate Committee for Women's Suffrage. The Santa Fe chapters of the NAWSA and the National Women's Party (NWP) encouraged and educated women voters about how to vote in the upcoming school board elections in April of 1917. Women had a lot of difficulty voting in this election when polling places were changed without notice. Instead of being discouraged, the experience convinced more women that they needed to become involved in politics and have the right to vote in order to fix the problems they encountered. During World War I, suffragists in New Mexico were led in their contributions to the war effort by the wife of the governor, Deane Lindsey, who was also a suffragist herself. The women's efforts to aid in the war helped change the public opinion in favor of women's suffrage in New Mexico.  National amendment  Annie Fraher, Bertha Moller, Berthe Arnold and Anita Pollitzer leave the National Women's Party headquarters in Washington, D.C. to take a petition to Senator A. A. Jones of New Mexico. Otero-Warren lobbied Representative William Walton and convinced him to support women's suffrage and the national women's suffrage amendment. Walton voted on the suffrage amendment in the U.S. House in January of 1918. Senator Jones passed the amendment out of the Senate Committee and helped to see it pass the Senate in June of 1919. New Mexico became important to the ratification process of the Nineteenth Amendment. Many suffragists hoped that New Mexico would be the first state to ratify the 19th Amendment. Otero-Warren heavy lobbied Hispanic members of the state house of representatives and convinced them to support the ratification of the amendment. In January of 1919, the amendment passed easily in the New Mexico House, but was stalled in the Senate. In January of 1920, at the Republican conference in Denver, Otero- Warren attended as a delegate to the Republican Women's Committee. Also at the convention, Governor Octaviano Larrozolo announced that he would work towards ratification of the 19th Amendment in New Mexico. Plans to oppose women's suffrage included introducing state referendum amendments, which would stall the process and complicated plots to encourage Hispanic politicians to oppose suffrage so that anti-suffrage Anglos could blame them for the suffrage amendment not passing. That January, Governor Larrozolo called for a special session of the New Mexico State Legislature to convene on February 16 to address the ratification of the 19th amendment. On the last day of the special session, Otero-Warren held a 3 hour private meeting with the Republican Caucus. After this meeting, Dan Padilla withdrew his attempt to create a referendum amendment to stall the adoption of women's suffrage and the Republican leader, R. I. Baca, also shifted his support for suffrage. On February 18, the Senate gallery was \\"packed\\" with suffragists and the Senate passed the amendment. The House passed the next day, making New Mexico the 32nd state to ratify the amendment. Before women in Santa-Fe went to the polls for the first time in 1920 to vote in the general election, information on voting was provided in both English and Spanish. It became a custom among Nuevomexicanas to register to vote on their twenty-first birthday during the 1920s. Also after the passage of the 19th Amendment, a large number of New Mexican women entered politics and worked prominently in various state and local organizations. Many women ran for office and often ran on the Republican ticket. Some of these were former suffragists, such as Anna Larkin and Clara Strong.

Completed in 1923 for a local printing industry trade group, it continues to serve that role under original ownership, and houses one of its original tenants. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2020. Description and history The Printers Building is located just south of Worcester Common, on the east side of Portland Street between Austin and Federal Streets. It is a seven story structure, built out of reinforced concrete with a facing of brick and stone and covered by a flat roof. The main facade is five bays wide, each bay housing a storefront (or redesigned former storefront) on the ground floor except the one at center right, which houses the main entrance. The ground floor is separated from the upper levels by a decorative stone band with cartouches between the bays. The upper levels house groups of windows, the outer bays with two sash windows and the inner bays with four. The center bays of the 2nd through 6th floors are separated by bands of brickwork. Worcester's broadly diversified industrial economy included a number of printing businesses. In 1922, several of these banded together to provide a building in which printing and publishing operations could be equitably priced and supported. Among them were Commonwealth Press, which operated on the premises until 1989, and Davis Press, now Davis Publications, which continues to operate publication offices from the building. Ownership of the building was vested in a trust established for the purpose, which continues to maintain the premises. The building was designed by New York City architect Walter S. Timmis, a specialist in buildings for printers. As originally designed, it housed retail spaces on the ground floor, publication offices on the second, and printing operations on the upper levels. The upper levels were specifically reinforced to support the action of heavy duty presses of the time.

It spans northern Monona County and southern Woodbury County It serves the towns of Sloan, Hornick, Salix, Smithland, and the surrounding rural areas. The district was created in 1961, from the consolidation of Sloan, Salix, Smithland and Holly-Springs-Hornick. Schools The district operates two schools in a single facility in Sloan: * Westwood Elementary School * Westwood High School =Westwood High School= Athletics The Rebels compete in the Western Valley Activities Conference in the following sports: *Cross Country *Volleyball *Football *Basketball *Track and Field *Golf *Baseball *Softball *Wrestling *Archery Students can also participate in Soccer with Sergeant Bluff-Luton. Modern History The first Superintendent of the newly consolidated Westwood CSD was E.V. Heacock.He served for five years. The first people on the school board were President Warren Johnson of Sloan, Orval K. Cox of Hornick, Cyr Miquelon of Salix, Norman Stickney of Smithland, Alvin Sulsberger of Holly Springs. The board took one year to get organized while the other schools kept their education going. It took 17 years to get the new school building vote passed. The new K-12 Westwood building was built in 1988. Upon consolidation, the name ‚ÄúWestwood‚Äù was chosen for a community likeness towards the UCLA Bruins who are located in the Westwood region of Los Angeles, California. Hence, the Columbia Blue and Gold Colors were also adopted. In 1995, the school colors changed from Columbia Blue and Gold to Royal Blue and Gold. The mascot ‚ÄúRebel‚Äù was named after a high school student's dog. The student‚Äôs name was Rick Watson and he entered the name ‚ÄúRebel‚Äù into a contest and it was selected as the winner. ‚ÄúWillie The Rebel‚Äù is the mascot along with the icon, ‚Äúswords.‚Äù Diane Miller designed and drew Willie The Rebel. Early History =Salix= Orignial Salix School Second Salix School Building In 1880, the school authorities of Liberty Township purchased a quarter block of land at the southwest corner of the intersection of Willow and Tipton Streets and erected the first school building in Salix. On April 7, 1920, eight acres on the south edge of Salix, were purchased from the Harrington family for a new school site. The school was occupied on April 1, 1929. The land is currently a city park today. In 1961, the Salix Public School became a part of the newly organized Westwood Community School District. The Salix School building continued to serve the K-6th grades until 1988. =Sloan= Sloan High School Building The first school in Sloan was held on the second floor of the grocery store owned by Evans and Beall, with the first schoolteacher as Miss L. Hosmer. Church was also held on the second floor. A larger school building was constructed in 1916, that operated as a K-12. Carl Burris was superintendent during the 1920‚Äôs. In 1940, a new gymnasium was constructed for the Sloan Raiders basketball team. By 1949, enrollment had increased to 334, making Sloan Consolidated school the largest school in the county. Homecoming was first celebrated during the 1948-49 basketball season, with Marilyn Henry as the first homecoming queen. The Sloan ‚ÄúRaiders‚Äù retired their name in 1962 as the consolidation of Sloan, Hornick, Holly Springs, Salix, and Smithland happened. Although Westwood consolidated in 1961, they did not adopt the mascot ‚ÄúRebels‚Äù until the next year. The old Sloan school building was torn down in the 1990s. =Holly Springs= Holly Springs School Building The Holly Springs school closed in the 1960s as the Westwood Community School District was formed.

Currently, there are houses where the school used to be. The original school cost $5,000 to build. Some students rode on a bus pulled by horses to get to school. In 1916, the school added 11th and 12th grades. With that, they also built a new school building. In 1917, the new school building caught fire and burnt down. One year later they built a replica of the first school. Where the school was located is currently where the Hornick city park is today. When the Holly Springs school closed the 6-8th grade, it divided the K-5 with Hornick and Salix Hornick, Iowa, 1887-1987: History of our 100 years. (1987). . =Smithland= Smithland school building Smithland is one of the oldest towns in northwest Iowa. The first teacher at the Smithland school was Hannah Van Dorn. In 1854 when the Cornelius Van Dorn family moved into the Smithland area, Mr. Smith found a school teacher; Van Dorn‚Äôs daughter, Hannah, and promptly rallied the men of the community . Within 5 days, they had raised the first log cabin schoolhouse on what records state is tot 10, block 2, Smithland. (Roy Gambs, in 1958, noted this should be recorded to read Lots 7 and 8 Block 2.) The Smithland school house was the first schoolhouse in Woodbury county and was built of hewed cotton logs; the floors and doors were cottonwood puncheon. There were 23 students and Miss Van Dorn received $2.00 per week, paid by the school patrons in the proportion to the number of students in attendance. Mr. O.B Smith boarded her free of charge. In 1859, Elijah Adams built a new frame schoolhouse and in the late 1860‚Äôs, the ladies of Smithland, through the community club socials, raised money to buy a bell for the new school. The bell was ordered from the Ohio foundry at the considerable cost of $114.00. It was shipped to Dension, the nearest railroad town, and hauled to Smithland by Joe‚Äô Bowers‚Äô mule team. The inscription on the bell reads; ‚ÄúBuckeye Bell Factory, 1869, Vanduken and Tiet, Cincinnati.‚Äù In 1876 a large two-story school house was erected. It was a two-story frame,50x60 feet with ceilings fourteen feet high, and was ventilated by means of double chimneys. The lower story was divided into two rooms, each having a seating capacity of fifty pupils. The upper story was one room, and contained seats for 100 pupils. The school was graded and had a three years‚Äô high school course. The enrollment for 1889 was enlarged to 190, with an average of 160. In 1913 the present school house was erected. Each time, the bell was moved and employed to call the students to classes. The bell was retired at 84 in 1954 and in 1964 was placed in Memorial Park beside the first school house. Tragically, in 1969 the bell was stolen from the memorial park and never recovered. 1880 was the first graduating class with Regina Gambs Genness as the only graduate. The superintendent for that year was J.S Shoup. Since then there have been graduates all but for 13 years, the last year without graduates was 1902.

It was published in 1976, thirty-one years after the first novel in the series. The pace of events is rapid. George Warleggan and Ross Poldark are both elected to Parliament. A child is born to Morwenna. Sam Carne falls in love. Elizabeth confronts George over his suspicions. Demelza has a lover. The lover dies. Morwenna's husband has sex with her 14-year-old sister. Drake owns a successful business. Book One The main events of Book One are the election of George Warleggan to Parliament, the birth of Morwenna's child, the marriage of Dwight and Caroline Enys, Drake Carne becoming a successful blacksmith, Hugo Armitage's courtship of Demelza, Sam Carne falling in love with Emma Tregirls and Ossie Whitworth taking up a sexual relationship with his 14-year-old sister-in-law Rowella. * George Warleggan asks for a meeting with local physician Daniel Behanna, who was the attending physician at the birth of Valentine Warleggan. Warleggan interrogates the doctor about the physical characteristics of a full-term infant versus a pre-term infant. Behanna declines to offer an opinion one way or the other. Warleggan then seeks out George Tabb, who worked for Elizabeth in the months prior to Elizabeth's marriage to George. He interrogates Mr. Tabb about Elizabeth's social habits. This leads to no useful information. Warleggan interrogates Elizabeth as to whether she still retains warm feelings for Ross Poldark. She denies this. * Dwight Enys and Caroline Penvenen are married on November 1. * The faithful reader of the Poldark series learns for the first time that \\"Vennor\\" is Ross Poldark's middle name. * Lord (George) Falmouth has for years chosen the two Members of Parliament from Truro. They are technically elected by a 25-person body consisting of burgesses. The Members of Parliament chosen by the Falmouth interests are known as the \\"Boscawen nominees\\". It is believed that St. Ann's, is growing tired of the Falmouth supremacy. Bassett is a Whig, while Falmouth is a Tory. * Ross offers to buy a blacksmith shop (called \\"Pally's Shop\\") for Drake Carne. Drake, languishing in severe doldrums because of Morwenna's marriage to the execrable Ossie Whitworth, accepts. The business is located in St. Ann's. * Sam Carne encounters Emma Tregirls, the daughter of Lobby Tregirls. She is a housemaid for Dr. Thomas Choake. He is attracted to her and over the coming days, often reflects that converting her to Methodism and saving her soul would be a worthwhile adventure. He reflects on her face, which he thinks of as \\"bold, defiant and candid\\". He learns that she is regarded as a loose woman. This does not deter his interest. On subsequent encounters, he is more attracted. He learns that she is in a quasi-engagement with Tom Harry, one of George Warleggan's henchmen. * Morwenna's sister Rowella, who is not quite fifteen, comes for an unextended stay with the Whitworth's. She is described as having \\"very fine skin, a sly look, sandy eyebrows, an underlip that tended to tremble, and the best brain in the family\\". Ossie mulls over the fact that Morwenna does not appear to enjoy his frequent attentions. * Ross and Demelza are invited to a party at Tehidy, the home of Sir Frances Bassett. Hugo Armitage, one of the men saved from the French prisoner-of-war camp by Ross, is also a guest. He aggressively seeks Demelza's attentions and appears to be smitten by her. Sir Frances asks Ross to run for a seat in Parliament as one of the members from Truro, under his sponsorship and in opposition to the Falmouth slate. Ross declines. Sir Frances then extends this offer to George Warleggan who accepts and is eventually very narrowly elected. * After a life- threatening labor, Morwenna gives birth to a son, John Conan Osborne Whitworth. * The residents learn of and start to follow the exploits of Napoleon. This gives rise to fears of a French invasion on their coast. * Hugo Armitage looks for reasons to spend time with Demelza, and takes to sending her love poems. * A visiting Methodist supervisor advises Sam Carne that he has heard rumors of Sam's interest in a loose woman and advises that Sam stay away from any such attachment. * George goes to London for his first term as a Member of Parliament. He doesn't take Elizabeth. Their marriage is in noticeable decline. * Dwight Enys is called in to see Morwenna when John Conan is about a month old and perceives that she is doing very poorly. He believes this comes from an oppression of her spirits. She tells him that her husband has resumed his marital attentions. Dwight tells Ossie to desist for at least another month. * Ross Poldark and Elizabeth Warleggan unexpectedly encounter each other while visiting the grave of Aunt Agatha. He insists on bringing up their past, over her restraint and coldness. She tells him that her husband is suspicious of the parentage of Valentine. They air their issues. Ross kisses her. * Ossie follows Rowella into her bedroom one afternoon. She accedes to his ardent advances. * After Sam Carne has avoided Emma for a month, she accosts him at his home and demands to know why he has been keeping his distance. He tells her that he would happily marry her and that he loves her. She stalks off, believing she would hurt his life if they grew closer. Book Two Book Two begins in early summer 1796. * Hugo continues to court Demelza and to send her love poetry. * Dwight and Caroline experience some sadness in their marriage because he prioritizes his medical care of the local poor, while she wants him to spend more time with her. * Ossie continues his sexual relationship with Rowella: \\"Sometimes he wondered if she were a witch, a witch sent specially into the world fully fledged in all things evil while still a child. For she understood more about captivating a man, of inflaming a man, than either his first or second wife had ever dreamed of.\\" * Demelza encounters Jud Paynter and he mentions that he saw Ross and Elizabeth Warleggan \\"come to meet each other like two little birds on a tree\\", which is a reference to the time the two accidently met at Aunt Agatha's grave. Demelza leaves this conversation \\"with an apocalyptic face\\". * George Warleggan, home at Trenwith after his term in Parliament, orders his men to make trouble for Drake Carne's blacksmithing business. * Rowella notifies Ossie that she is pregnant. He hopes she will resolve the issue by killing herself, but such is not to be. In a week or two, she tells him she has thought of a solution. She will get the local librarian -- Arthur Solway -- to marry her. What stands in the way of this solution is that the newly-married young couple will need, Rowella says, ¬£500 from Ossie. He is furious but eventually relents and the young couple is married. * Since Rowella is no longer sexually available to Ossie, he attempts to resume his marital attentions with Morwenna. She rejects him and notifies him that she is aware of his affair with Rowella. She tells him that if he so much as touches her, the next day she will murder their son. He desists. * Drake Carne decides to approach Elizabeth Warleggan to see if she will agree to intervene with George to have the attacks on his blacksmith business come to a stop. He is waylaid by George's gang of henchmen who beat him brutally to within an inch of his life, leaving what is likely to be permanent disfigurement. Several weeks later, he again approaches Elizabeth, but this time at the Warleggan residence in Truro. He tells her what is happening to his blacksmith shop. She confronts George and in this argument, the deeper issue of the parentage of Valentine comes to the surface. She swears on a Bible that \\"I have never, never given my body to any man except to my first husband, Frances, and to you, George\\". She insists that George must give up his suspicions and that if doesn't agree to do so, then and there, the marriage will be effectively over. He concedes. * As the summer of 1797 approaches, Hugo Armitage is put on permanent leave from the Navy because his eyesight is failing. He visits Demelza on a day that Ross is elsewhere and asks her to take him to see a seal colony. They row there and on a beach near a cave, she allows him to make love to her. Book Three * Demelza examines her conscience in the wake of her adultery and reflects on her relationship with Ross. She loves him and is committed to their life together. * For the first year in a long time, there is a good pilchard harvest. This good news comes in the wake of a significant food riot that resulted in the arrest of several dozen ringleaders, and for which one man eventually hangs. As the village gathers to process pilchard, hostilities break out between Sam Carne and Tom Harry. Tolly Tregirls has been attempting to put together a round of wrestling at the upcoming Sawle Feast. Sam agrees to wrestle Tom there with the promise from Emma that if Sam wins, she will agree to attend meetings at the Methodist church for three months. * The Poldarks receive word that Hugo is ill and has requested the attendance of Dwight Enys, as well as a visit from the Poldarks. The Poldarks discuss deep questions of marital loyalty and Ross confesses that he saw Elizabeth. * Demelza arranges a rapprochement between Sir Frances Bassett and Lord Falmouth. * Rowella notifies Ossie that she wasn't pregnant after all. \\"I was -- was very young and I made a terrible mistake\\". * At the Sawle festival, Sam Carne loses his best two-out-of-three wrestling match with Tom on the third bout. Some spectators believe he lost deliberately. One of those spectators is Emma Tregirls. * Emma confronts Demelza while Demelza is picking blackberries with her children and demands to know why Sam would have deliberately lost the match, if her eternal soul was at stake. Demelza suggests that Emma should seek out Sam and ask him. Emma also tells Demelza that while everyone believes she is a loose woman, and that it is true that she does let men take certain liberties, \\"a man's never had me\\". * Further notifications about Hugo's declining health are received. The Poldarks visit. Hugo is in fact dying. While Demelza is alone with Hugo in the sickroom, Ross wanders about the house, feeling like his life needs a new purpose. He encounters Lord Falmouth who invites him to run for the seat in Parliament occupied by George Warleggan. Ross agrees. Ross also finds a love poem that, albeit somewhat ambiguously, appears to speak of a physical act of love having taken place between Hugo and Demelza. * Because of the rapprochement between Sir Frances Bassett and Lord Falmouth, Bassett notifies Warleggan that he will no longer support him in contests for Parliament. * Ossie periodically runs into Rowella in town and increasingly interprets her as making eyes at him. This \\"left Ossie hot and newly angry all over again and desperately aroused. It lent encouragement to his worst fantasies.\\" * In mid- September 1797, Ross Poldark is elected to Parliament by a one-vote margin over George Warleggan. Lord Falmouth then tells him that Hugo died the previous day. * As the book closes, Ross and Demelza try to find their way with each other as Demelza grieves Hugo's loss and it is made known between the two that Demelza and Hugo had a physical relationship.

Created at his studio in Rome, the painting was exhibited throughout Europe, creating interest in immigration to the United States. Measuring , the painting is a centerpiece of the 19th-century landscape collection at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C.  Background  Albert Bierstadt immigrated from Germany to New Bedford, Massachusetts, as an infant. He later went back to Germany to study art at the D√ºsseldorf Academy before returning to the United States to join the Hudson River School. After the gold rush to California, Bierstadt was part of an 1859 survey expedition, led by Frederick W. Lander, to scout a route for a railroad across the Rockies. Sponsored by the Union Pacific Railroad, over the next decade, he made several more such trips during which he painted scenes of California with the goal of attracting visitors and investors to the region. It was on one such journey to the Sierra Nevada in 1863 that Bierstadt saw the scene he later depicted in Among the Sierra Nevada. Albert Bierstadt - Valley of the Yosemite - Google Art Project.jpgBierstadt's Valley of the Yosemite (1864) Bierstadt Albert In the Mountains.jpgBierstadt's In the Mountains (1867)  Creation and early exhibition  Among the Sierra Nevada was created in Rome in winter 1867‚Äì68, four years after Bierstadt's trip to the Sierra Nevada. The painting was first shown in London the subsequent summer along with two other works by the artist. It was then shown at the Royal Academy in Berlin, where it earned a Gold Medal. It was later exhibited in Paris, Moscow and Saint Petersburg. A consummate promoter of his own work, Bierstadt presumably hoped to raise the price of the piece by exhibiting it around Europe. He would plant stories in newspapers and sell tickets to his exhibitions, turning the unveiling of his work into a theatrical event.  Provenance  One of the antique farm buildings of the Locusts on Hudson estate Bierstadt took the painting to the United States in 1869 and sold it to Alvin Adams, an art collector in Boston. Adams had also owned another Bierstadt piece, Lake Lucerne (1858). In 1873, Among the Sierra Nevada was acquired by William Brown Dinsmore (1810‚Äì1888), a businessman who wanted it for his country villa Locusts on Hudson in Dutchess County, New York. It passed down to his great-granddaughter, Helen Huntington Hull. Locusts on Hudson was demolished, and Hull had a new home built on the property in 1941. As part of the interior decoration, she had Among the Sierra Nevada removed from its frame and glued to an interior wall in the new house. Hull died in 1976 leaving the painting as a bequest to the Smithsonian Institution. William Truettner, a curator for the Smithsonian, was sent to Hull's house to retrieve the painting and also found the original ornate gilded frame‚Äîin four pieces but in good condition‚Äîin a barn on the property. Conservators spent about 600 hours to clean the painting, including the glue from the back of the canvas, before it was remounted on the original frame. In 1985, the painting became a centerpiece of the 19th-century landscape collection at Smithsonian American Art Museum.

It was released on June 19, 2020.  Background  On October 24, 2011, Stuart Duncan, Yo-Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer and Chris Thile (with Aoife O'Donovan) released their first album together, entitled The Goat Rodeo Sessions. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard Classical, Classical Crossover, and Bluegrass charts and reached number eighteen on the Billboard 200. It also won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album and the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical in 2013. The term ' refers to a chaotic event where many things must go right for the situation to work, a reference to the unusual and challenging aspects of blending classical and bluegrass music. Ma described a goat rodeo thus: \\"If there were forks in the road and each time there was a fork, the right decision was made, then you get to a goat rodeo.\\" Ma has stated in an interview that the group had the idea to make a second album in 2011, while recording The Goat Rodeo Sessions. In August 2019, Meyer shared photographs on social media of the group, including O'Donovan, in studio recording new material. On June 19 of the next year, this second album, Not Our First Goat Rodeo, was released. On September 1, 2020, a Tiny Desk Concerts was released by NPR in which the group performed three sounds from the album. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the musicians each recorded themselves individually from home for the set. The album has received praise from reviewers, who have cited the group's virtuosity, chemistry, and ability to bend genres.  Track listing   Personnel  The album features Stuart Duncan, Yo-Yo Ma, Edgar Meyer, and Chris Thile on all 10 tracks.

Catherine Nelson of The Strad praised the album's complexity and \\"sheer joyfulness of expression\\". Writing for AllMusic, Matt Collar described the album as a \\"deeply engaging, often rapturous album that balances keen and studied musicality with an almost chaotic passion for group interplay\\". Comparing the album to The Goat Rodeo Sessions, Justin Hiltner called Not Our First Goat Rodeo \\"more ornery, more confident, brash, and joyously off- kilter\\", and said that the ensemble \\"feels veteran\\" for a sophomore album. The album also reached number one on the Billboard Classical, Classical Crossover, and Bluegrass charts.

He was the son of Hubert van den Eynde, a master of the Guild of Saint Luke, and a member of the Van den Eynde family of sculptors. Van den Eynde was a close associate of Artus Quellinus II. He undertook several commission for the Antwerp Cathdral, including several altarpieces. Life Norbert van den Eynde was born in Antwerp, Spanish Netherlands, where he was baptized on December 11, 1628. Van den Eynde was born into a renowned family of sculptors, one of the top families of sculptors in Antwerp, and part of the informal Quellinus- Verbrugghen-Willemsens-Scheemaeckers-Van den Eynde partnership, which had turned the sculpture market of Antwerp into one of monopoly. The extensive collaboration between the workshops of these families in the late 17th century \\"may be the most important factor\\" to account for the intricate \\"unity of style and approaches that have made disentangling of hands particularly difficult for art historians.\\" He was either the son of Jan I van den Eynde and the nephew of Hubert (Hubrecht) van den Eynde, master of the Guild of Saint Luke, or the son of Hubert (or Hubrecht) and his second wife Elizabeth van Breen. Hubrecht's first wife Elizabeth Schorkens, by whom he might have had Sebastiaen van den Eynden (who was, at any rate, either Hubrecht's son or Hubrecht's nephew), another Van den Eynde who went on to become a master of the Guild, died on July 19, 1624, just a few weeks after giving birth. Hubrecht later remarried to Elizabeth van Breen, by whom he reportedly had Norbert II in 1628. Van den Eynde had three or four children with Van Breen: Norbertus II and possibly Cornelis (both sculptors), and Franchoise Theresia and Isabella Maria. The latter married Jan Pauwel Gillemans the Younger on March 3, 1693, by whom she had a son before dying prematurely in October 1697.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1113-1116 Van den Eynde and his wife lived in Arenbergstraat, in 'the Wapper' of Antwerp, where they owned at least two houses. They moved to Ghent for ten months between May 1692 and March 1693, leaving their house in the Wapper to their daughter Isabella Maria. Upon their return to Antwerp, they witnessed the birth of a grandson, as well as the deaths of their daughter Isabella Maria, her sister Franchoise Theresia, and their brother Norbert II. Van den Eynde experienced financial trouble, had to sell his two houses on the 'Wapper', but was finally able to pay all his debts before his death in 1704. Van den Eynde collaborated with Artus Quellinus II on many occasions, such as the high altarpiece of the now demolished Sint-Joriskerk; the high altarpiece of the Sint-Michielskerk of Ghent, and, between 1640 and 1670, the altar and altar garden of the fencers' guild in the Cathedral of Antwerp, completing the work commenced by Norbert's father Huibrecht. Between 1683 and 1688, Van den Eynde completed an altarpiece dedicated to Saint Catherine with Lodewijk Willemsens for the oudekleerkopers guild in the cathedral of Antwerp. In 1670, Van den Eynde and Hendrik Frans Verbrugghen were \\"specifically invited for their advice\\" to travel to Mechelen as consultants for works on the Cathedral there. Van den Eynde was a frequent supplier of marble plaques (used for ebony cabinets) to the Musson and Forchondt art dealing firms.

She spent her twenty-six-year career employed by the State, at a time when women could only be public employees, working for the ministry of civil engineering. Milica's career flourished in the period between the two wars, influenced mostly by Modernism. As a respected architect, she reached in 1940 the rank of inspector, the highest position and received numerous awards for her achievements. Early life and education Milica was born Milica ƒåolak- Antiƒá on 9 September 1887 in Kragujevac. Her father Paul was a Cavalry officer and son of Duke ƒåolak-Anta Simeonoviƒá, a famous vojvoda from the First Serbian Uprising; Her mother Jelena was the sister of painter Milan Milovanoviƒá. She had two brothers Antonije (1890-1908) a composer and Milivoje ƒåolak-Antiƒá (1884-1944) a Colonel in the army. After graduating from Belgrade's Gymnasium for Girls in 1906, she studied architecture at the University of Belgrade, she graduated in 1910. She married ≈Ωarko Krstiƒá, also an architect, while at University. Architecture career 350x350px In 1915 Milica Krstiƒá started her career in the architectural department of the Ministry of Construction. The architectural department was back then the largest architectural practice in the country. Her colleagues were Momir Korunoviƒá, Nikolaj Krasnov, Vasilij Androsov, Branislav Kojiƒá, and others. She started as a subarchitect to architect. The country was in cruel need of rebuilding after years of wars and foreign occupation, from 1915 to 1918 Belgrade was in the zone of Serbia under harsh Austro-Hungarian occupation, during the fighting preceding the invasion Belgrade alone lost 25% of its buildings. Like most women in architecture during those years, Krstiƒá was assigned educational architecture. The challenges was to design, on a low budget, a healthy, functional, and well-designed environment, for students and teachers. She designed Elementary Schools for small villages around Serbia incrorporating elements of local traditional architecture: Godacica (1923), Slatina (1924), Dugo Polje (1924), Gornji Matejevac (1925), Sala≈° Crnobarski (1926) and Viniƒçko (1928) before moving to monumental buildings in Belgrade. Her vision developed within the style and spirit of local building traditions. Her first monumental building was the Command of Gendarmerie in 1931 at 14 Saint Sava street in Belgrade, the Gendarmerie of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, today the building of Komercijalna Bank. It shows her commitment to a functionalist approach. Her most praised buildings are two monumental schools in Belgrade. In 1933 she designed the Second Gymnasium for Girls, the same school that she attended as a young girl, at 31 Queen Natalia street, today the Electro-technical Gymnasium Nikola Tesla, it was constructed in place of the Girls College and the building of the State Council. She created a sumptuous building simple in modern Serbian-Byzantine style or neo-Byzantine. The Second Gymnasium for Girls was designed without unnecessary decoration, the white facade and the rounded corners clearly show the influence of modernism and Milica Krstiƒá's application of the principles of Bauhaus and Modernism. The building has been declared a cultural heritage in 1964. In 1936 she designed the First Gymnasium for Boys at 65 Du≈°anova street. In contrast to her previous building she went for a more bare modern style. In 1989, The First Gymnasium for Boys was also declared a cultural heritage.

She tries to handle the convent's large debts which she inherits, but her plans are thwarted when Charles II of England borrows money, promises its return, but fails to pay back the convent during The Restoration. Life Knatchbull was born in Kingdom of England in 1610. When she was about fourteen she was amongst the founding members of a new Convent of the Immaculate Conception in Ghent. The convent was created by her aunt Lucy Knatchbull in 1624. The convent was founded by nuns from the Brussels convent and the original four were her aunt, Magdalen Digby, Eugenia Poulton and Mary Roper. Another of the early nuns, Margaret Knatchbull, was also a niece of the abbess. The convent grew rapidly gathering new members and funds from their dowries. Her aunt led the group and she commissioned a new building on the banks of the River Scheldt which they moved to in 1628. She rose through the ranks. Her aunt died in 1629, and by the time she was elected abbess in 1640 there was ¬£6,000 of debt. She tackled this in two ways, firstly she reduced the convent's expenditure, but she also renegotiated the convent's debts to spread and reduce the payments necessary to service the loans. Meanwhile the exiled Charles II was in Europe and Knatchbull enjoyed a close relationship with the King and his court. The convent played host to the court and received and passed on letters to the King's advisers including the Earl of Ormonde and Edward Hyde (later earl of Clarendon). Knatchbull communicated widely and her opinions were noted. She was considered one of the finest of abbesses and a person who played an important role in Charles II's restoration to the throne in 1660. Knatchbull died in Ghent.

Throughout the late 1970s and the 1980s the Women's Press was a highly visible presence, publishing feminist literature. Founding In 1977 Stephanie Dowrick cofounded the Women's Press with publishing entrepreneur Naim Attallah. Attallah owned Quartet Books, which had previously partnered with Virago Press, and Virago's success helped Dowrick convince Attallah that \\"there was space for a new feminist list that would reflect one of the most exciting political currents in society and make commercial sense.\\" As Attallah recalled, The logo of the Women's Press was a clothes iron, a symbol of domestic labour associated with women, with black and white strips running down the books' spine to represent an iron's electric cord. Dowrick was soon joined by Sibyl Grundberg, and in February 1978 the Women's Press issued its first book, a reprint of Jane Austen's Love and Freindship. Other reprints in the 1978 list included Elizabeth Barrett Browning's Aurora Leigh and Kate Chopin's The Awakening. As with Virago, the Woman's Press published a mix of classic and contemporary work, understood itself as raising consciousness, and operated with an advisory group of feminist academics and media workers. 1980s In 1981 Ros de Lanerolle became managing director. Under her leadership The Women's Press differentiated itself from Virago by emphasising contemporary political concerns, under the slogan \\"Live Authors, Live Issues\\". It also made an effort to publish black and Third World women's writing. In 1983 the Press had commercial success with the British publication of Alice Walker's best-seller The Color Purple, and it also published Tsitsi Dangarembga's Nervous Conditions (1988) and Pauline Melville's Shape-Shifter (1990). From 1985 to 1991 the Press also had a feminist science fiction list.Joan Haran, \\"Re-Visioning Feminist Futures: Literature as Social Theory\\", PhD thesis, University of Warwick, 2003, pp. 16‚Äì17. Accessed 1 September 2020. However, a publishing recession in the late 1980s and early 1990s left the Women's Press making losses. Though de Lanerolle argued that the cause was a general recession, and that the company was recovering, Attallah blamed the attention paid to Third World women writers. In late 1990 Attallah appointed Mary Hemming as deputy managing director, and in early 1991 rejected an attempted buyout offer of ¬£500,000 by de Lanerolle. De Lanerolle was forced to resign and accept a redundancy payout, and five other staff resigned in solidarity with her. Attallah appointed himself the firm's interim managing director and briefly recalled Dowrick before appointing Kathy Gale as managing director. Twenty-three Women's Press authors, including Merle Collins, Mich√®le Roberts, Gillian Slovo and Sheila Jeffreys, wrote to The Guardian to distance themselves from Attallah's actions.Rukhsana Ahmad, \\"What's Happening to the Women's Presses?\\", Spare Rib, May 1991, pp. 10‚Äì13.

Biography  Grandson of Italian Baron Paulo di Portanova, Enrico di Portanova was born in Los Angeles but raised by his father in Italy. He is heir through his mother, Lillie Cranz Cullen, to the fortune of his grandfather, Hugh Roy Cullen, an American oil magnate. Following the death of this maternal grandfather in 1957, he left Rome and his activities in jewelry to claim his inheritance in Houston in the early 1960s. The consortium responsible for managing his grandfather's fortune begins by paying him a monthly annuity of 5,000 dollars. This eventually increased and reached $1.2 million per month at the end of the 1970s. His fortune was then estimated at $50 million. The baron and his younger brother Ugo, however, decide to sue the Cullen conglomerate, demanding a fairer share of their grandfather's billions. One of the biggest lawsuits ever in an inheritance case in the United States followed. Roy Cohn, the lawyer for the two brothers, claims two billion dollars. In 1984, a judge dismissed the trial after a friendly settlement had been reached with the Cullen Fund. He died on February 28, 2000 at his property in Houston, certainly from cancer, at the age of 66, according to him. All his friends, however, agree that he was much older.  Privacy  After a first marriage with the Yugoslav basketball player Ljuba Otanovic, from whom he divorced in 1972, he married a flight attendant, Sandra Hovas, for a second time, to form one of the most observed couples in the American jet set. . The wedding took place in London in 19731. The couple only travel in their private plane, a Lear Jet that the baron calls his taxi. The device is called Barefoot Contessa, a tribute to the film by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. In 1984, Enrico di Portanova confided in Charlotte Curtis of the New York Times: \\"We have so much baggage that our private plane is no longer enough, we send the servants with the baggage on regular lines\\". Owner of houses in Rome, Houston and Acapulco, his life is dedicated to the pleasure of living and receiving in his residences. He is famous for the caviar tagliolini that he offers to his guests. He only drinks Dom P√©rignon and his motto is \\"Sun, sex and spaghetti\\".  The Houston Villa  After his marriage to Sandra, \\"Ricky\\" transforms his home in Houston. Originally a modest French- inspired pavilion, the house became one of the most extravagant in the Texan economic capital. To cool the gardens and the swimming pool, the property is completely covered with a glass protection. The interiors house a collection of animal sculptures: sphinxes, leopards, dolphins, jaguars. The candelabras are carried by statues of Nubian slaves. The decoration of the different rooms comes from the Rococo style and from the French Grand Si√®cle, with paintings from the 18th century. One of the attractions of the place is the baron's snake: the animal responds to the name of Katharina. The baron and the baroness like to give parties there. They are sometimes surprising, like a Christmas dinner with gospel choirs and camels roaming freely in the garden. During more intimate dinners, Ricky receives his guests in the style of Louis XV, cooking his own pasta with caviar, washed down with wines whose bottles bear a label that he has personally designed.  La Casa Arabesque  Main article: Villa Arabesque.In 1975, Enrico di Portanova bought land and his private beach in Acapulco, Mexico, to build a villa he wanted spectacular. The works lasted from 1978 to 1983. They mobilized 1,500 workers under the direction of the architect Aurelio Mu√±oz Castillo. Mediterranean in style, the Casa Arabesque is the largest villa built at the time in Acapulco: it covers six thousand square meters, has twenty-eight bedrooms and twenty-six bathrooms for the guests. It also has four swimming pools. The terrace that covers the villa has a private helipad, a funicular connects the different levels of the house. The ballroom being for the sole use of the baroness, the architect suggests that the baron build his private disco to avoid having to organize his parties, as he does at Armando's, a famous club in Acapulco. The decoration of this disco takes the aspect of the seabed. During construction, the original plans are modified to increase the number of service rooms. The servants went from fifteen to forty to ensure the service of famous guests, more and more numerous and succeeding one another without interruption: Henry Kissinger, Roger Moore, Sylvester Stallone, Pl√°cido Domingo, members of the international jet set‚Ä¶ Famous for the celebrations there, the Arabesque villa is visible in License to Kill, a film in the James Bond series. The set for the shoot, in 1989, was kindly offered by the Portanovas. The house contains very rich murals of women resembling a harem, the long wall sofas were decorated with stripped cushions and covered with leopard fur on many of them. To accompany the leopard decor, silver leopard statues resting on copper trees by D'Argenta were placed on the floor where giant square cushions formed the basis of large circular glass tables that house a variety of statues, candle holders and trays.

Career After four years of postdoctoral work at the University of Iceland and UBC, Flowers joined the faculty at Simon Fraser University (SFU) where she continued to study glaciers in western Canada. She was appointed a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in 2005 to study how glaciers and icecaps were affected by global warming and other climate changes. The position allowed her to travel to the Saint Elias Mountains and study the variability of glacial change in neighbouring mountain ranges with different microclimates. As a result of her research, Flowers received one of three 2006 Outstanding Young Scientist award from the European Geosciences Union. She studied the Saint Elias Mountains for five years with a team of four to six researchers, taking turns staying at the Traditional Territory of the Kluane First Nation, in the co-managed Kluane National Park and Reserve for two to four weeks. In 2010, Flowers' Canada Research Chair was renewed for another five year term and she was recruited by Dr. Gifford Miller to conduct research on the melting of the Barnes Ice Cap. In 2018, she was appointed Chair of the International Glaciological Society's Publications Committee while continuing her research in southwest Yukon. Her research team began mapping the Kaskawulsh Glacier and its reaction towards warming climate and diminishing snow cover.

His 1941 book How to Make Animated Cartoons was one of the first instructional books on animation in the United States, covering the work of a wide variety of animation studios including Warner Bros. and Terrytoons.  Early life and education  Nathan Isaac Falk was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1898 to Lithuanian Jewish parents. He began drawing at a young age, becoming the art editor of The Club, the magazine of the Alliance Athletic and Literary Club of the Jewish Educational Alliance in Baltimore, in 1917. He studied art at the Maryland Institute, and then at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia. 261x261px  Career  In the 1920s Falk moved to New York, where he drew illustrations for various newspapers and magazines, on subjects ranging from health tips to anti-Nazi political satire. He also illustrated book covers, including for the long-running Tom Swift and Don Sturdy series. In 1933 Falk published Magic Mother Goose, an illustrated collection of Mother Goose rhymes accompanied by a \\"magic glass\\" for viewing a hidden image in each picture. The following year he released Russian Folk Tales, a collection of six Russian folk stories for children, with Yock Schwab. He published his best-known work, How to Make Animated Cartoons: The History and Technique, in 1941. It covered virtually all U.S. animation studios in existence at the time and included a foreword by Paul Terry, the founder of Terrytoons and creator of such characters as Mighty Mouse. The book was one of the first of its kind available in the early golden age of American animation, and it influenced future animators including Richard Williams, who led the animation of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Because recordings of many early animated cartoons have not survived, How to Make Animated Cartoons also serves as a useful record of the period in animation history.  Personal life  In 1925, Falk married Katherine Sagal. The couple had two sons, the military historian Stanley L. Falk and the physicist David S. Falk. He died in New York in 1989, at age 91.

Somapacitan is a human growth hormone analog. Somapacitan-beco is produced in Escherichia coli by recombinant DNA technology. The most common side effects include: back pain, joint paint, indigestion, a sleep disorder, dizziness, tonsillitis, swelling in the arms or lower legs, vomiting, adrenal insufficiency, hypertension, increase in blood creatine phosphokinase (a type of enzyme), weight increase, and anemia. It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020. Somapacitan (Sogroya) is the first human growth hormone (hGH) therapy that adults only take once a week by injection under the skin; other FDA-approved hGH formulations for adults with growth hormone deficiency must be administered daily.  Medical uses  Somapacitan is indicated for replacement of endogenous growth hormone in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). GHD is a condition when the body doesn't produce enough growth hormone on its own. Growth hormone regulates many functions in the body including accumulation of fat in the trunk or central area of the body that can be associated with serious medical issues.  Contraindications  Somapacitan should not be used in people with active malignancy, any stage of diabetic eye disease in which high blood sugar levels cause damage to blood vessels in the retina, acute critical illness, or those with acute respiratory failure, because of the increased risk of mortality with use of pharmacologic doses of somapacitan in critically ill individuals without growth hormone deficiency.  History  Somapacitan was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT02229851) in 300 participants with growth hormone deficiency who had never received growth hormone treatment or had stopped treatment with other growth hormone formulations at least three months before the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive injections of weekly somapacitan, weekly placebo (inactive treatment), or daily somatropin, an FDA-approved growth hormone. The effectiveness of somapacitan was determined by the percentage change of truncal fat, the fat that is accumulated in the trunk or central area of the body that is regulated by growth hormone and can be associated with serious medical issues. The trial was conducted at 92 sites in 16 countries: the United States, Australia, Germany, India, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, Poland, Romania, Russian Fed, South Africa, Sweden, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Adult participants were assigned at random to weekly Sogroya or placebo injections for 34 weeks. Neither the participants nor the investigators knew which treatment was given until the end of the trial. One additional group of participants with GHD received daily injections of somatotropin (an approved treatment for GHD). At the end of the 34-week treatment period, truncal fat decreased by 1.06%, on average, among participants taking weekly somapacitan while it increased among participants taking the placebo by 0.47%. In the daily somatropin group, truncal fat decreased by 2.23%. Participants in the weekly somapacitan and daily somatropin groups had similar improvements in other clinical endpoints. It was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2020. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the approval of Sogroya to Novo Nordisk, Inc.

Biography  Miguel M√°rmol was born on 4 July 1905 in Ilopango, El Salvador. M√°rmol became a shoemaker, but when the October Revolution occurred in Russia, he began to have an interest in left-wing politics. In Ilopango, he met August√≠n Farabundo Mart√≠, a prominent left-wing Salvadoran activist, and together they founded the Society of Workers, Peasants and Fishermen of Ilopango (SCOPI), and they used the ideologies of Augusto C√©sar Sandino as a guide. On 30 March 1930, he founded the Communist Party of El Salvador. On 22 January 1932, indigenous and communist peasants staged a revolution in El Salvador against the regime of President Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez. The rebels took over large portions of western El Salvador and killed an estimated 100 people during the first day. In response, President Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez ordered the Army to put down the uprising by force. The ensuing killings became known as La Matanza where anywhere from 10,000 to 40,000 people were killed. August√≠n Farabundo Mart√≠ was execution following the uprising and Miguel M√°rmol was arrested. He was released and later rearrested and rereleased in 1934 while attempting to flee to Honduras. While he was incarcerated, the chief of police told him that was going to surely die. He remained in El Salvador and later became the president of the National Alliance of Shoemakers. In 1947, M√°rmol left El Salvador for Guatemala. He was forced to flee back to El Salvador in 1954, however, due to the United States-backed coup which brought Carlos Castillo Armas to power. In 1988, M√°rmol recounted his escape from Guatemala in an interview with William Bollinger and Georg M Gugelberger: M√°rmol participated in a steel workers' strike against the government of Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo. He fled El Salvador again on 13 July 1980 after receiving death threats from several Salvadoran death squads. M√°rmol returned to El Salvador and died in San Salvador on 23 June 1993.

Gelles (July 31, 1944-March 14, 2020) was a multimedia American artist who explored the interplaybetween art, sociology, and psychology using image and text. Over a forty-year career, she worked in photography, film and video, installation, and artist‚Äôs books. Her photography is known for documenting family and domestic life, especially her own, with an ongoing witty and frank reckoning with traditional roles for women as daughter, wife, and mother. She moved beyond her own family as subject, culminating in the decade-long Fourth Grade Project, a portrait study of the lives of 300 children from around the world. Her incisive use of language overlaid on or under her images was a signature mark of her work. Early Life She was born Judith Sue Isacoff in Somersworth, New Hampshire, where she grew up. Her Jewish family was a rarity in the community. She graduated from Somersworth High at age 16. Growing up in the 1950s, she told an interviewer she had little exposure to art and culture, but was raised to focus on marriage and family. She graduated with a Bachelor in Science from Boston University in 1965 to become a teacher. She received a MEd in Counseling from the University of Miami in 1968. After marrying sociologist Richard Gelles, she had two children and was their primary caregiver in Kingston, RI. Career Gelles did not foresee becoming an artist until 1977, when she started a diary about her life as a wife and young mother. She took a photography course at the University of Rhode Island, expecting to make \\"a perfect baby portrait.\\" That soon changed. \\"My goal with the ‚ÄúFamily Portrait‚Äù series was to break through the veneer of the Happy Family and the Content Mother and to expose the hidden and mundane events of family life: 5:00 AM feedings; toilet training; dirty dishes; messy rooms and messy relationships. To keep track of what was going on, I kept a daily journal.I soon began writing short autobiographical stories directly onto the photograph. These photographs were microcosmic of the Feminist reaction against the charade of the idyllic home life.\\" The series includes portraits of her breastfeeding, being on the toilet with children hovering by, and on the floor watching television, noting she had three one-and-a-half periods a week \\"to do something creative.\\" A woman's group motivated Gelles to see herself as an artist. \\"I took a Sharpie pen and wrote right on the photographic paper,\\" she said. \\"I was the member of a women's consciousness- raising group in the '70s and I had to decide whether I would further my career as an artist or stay as a guidance counselor and make money,\\" she said. \\"The group encouraged me to go for it and become an artist.\\" She then attended the Rhode Island School of Design, where she expanded her photographic and video craft and completed her MFA in 1991. Another key project was the Florida Family Project, 1982-2014. When she first took her family to see her parents at their Florida mobile home park, she took a group portrait. This resulted in 23 images over the years they visited, ending in the year before her mother died. Mother Son pairs photos of herself and ones of son Jason, each from age six, to age eighteen. The triptych form, with interwoven text between the images, explores their widely contrasting experiences and self-images at each age. She explained, \\"Autobiographical stories display the subtly significant and significantly subtle ways we are taught to be male and female in our culture.\\" During this time, Gelles's art photographs appeared primarily in group exhibitions. She continued themes of gender roles and family dynamics in a video. ‚ÄúLife Is Like a Play‚Äù, a slice of life shot in the home movie genre, is a visual diary documenting the artist's life with the insider/outsider critical eye characteristic of all her work, while also examining the world in which she lives. It examines the issue of gender difference through the eyes of three generations; her parents, her sons, her husband, and herself. In 1997, she received a Residency at the Visual Studies Workshop, and in 1998 was awarded a MacDowell Colony Fellowship. In 1998, Judy and Richard moved to Philadelphia, where she found expanded opportunities to display her work and extend the scope of her projects. From that time, her solo shows, grants, and awards increased. Now able to look beyond her immediate home, she explored family life more symbolically. During a trip to Australia, she photographed private family sheds on Brighton Beach as reflecting both the individuality and conformity of each. She also photographed her parents' Florida Trailer Park as a series of night studies. In a similar vein, A Soldier's Story was exhibited at the National Museum of Jewish American History in 2001. The subject was her father-in-law's WWII military keepsakes that revealed a Jewish-American's perspective on memory, on military service, and on family history. She also directed a film, \\"From Philadelphia to the Front,\\" focusing on six American veterans of WWII who had never talked about their years of service and recounted their confrontations with anti-Semitism as enlisted men until they talked to Gelles. Distributed worldwide in 2005, it won awards at film festivals. During a 1905 residency at the Atlantic Center for the Arts, New Smyrna Beach, FL, Gelles created the video of \\"Artists on Age,\\" which is unique for its revealing only the moving of the speakers' lips. This project led to public art. For example, in a one day residency at Love Park in Philadelphia on October 10, 2009, Gelles and Linda Brenner asked 100 people to create a fingerprint and answer the four questions. The results were printed up and displayed as part of a sculpture called \\"Glass House\\" in Philadelphia, as well as at the Pentimenti Gallery, her longtime exhibitor. She responded to larger events into her work as well, such as portraits of urban Muslim women taken in Cairo after 9/11 and \\"Word Portraits\\" including same-sex couples in 2008, an important year in the gay marriage debate. Based upon her projects with children, she conceived of the Fourth Grade Project. For ten years Gelles interviewed and photographed over 300 fourth grade students from a range of economic and cultural backgrounds in China, Dubai, England, India, Israel, Italy, Nicaragua, St. Lucia, South Africa, South Korea, and parts of the United States. She asked three questions and took portraits of the back of each to protect their privacy. The large scale portraits integrate each child's answers as part of the text. Gelles believed this project could help expand understanding and build bridges around the world. The material developed into a curriculum project free for users under the aegis of CultureTrust Greater Philadelphia, and has an Exhibits USA touring nationally from 2020 to 2025. Later Life In addition to traveling widely to speak at screenings and exhibitions, Gelles also taught at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Tufts University in Boston, Boston College, University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Tyler School of Art in Philadelphia, and the International Center for Photography in New York City. Her works were accessioned by museums around the country, including Brooklyn Museum of Art, MOMA, and the Skirball Cultural Center.https://www.judygelles.com/resume In 2019, she became key care taker of her husband following his brain cancer diagnosis. She kept a Caring Bridge diary to document his condition and her own state of mind.https://www.caringbridge.org/visit/richardgelles March 13, 2020 was the opening day for a group exhibit at the Pentimenti Gallery in Philadelphia. Late that evening Gelles went to the hospital with a headache, and died within hours on March 14 of a brain aneurysm.https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/opinions/coronavirus-funeral-social- distancing-isolation-gelles/index.html Her husband Richard Gelles died three months later.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/25/us/richard-gelles-dead.html Significance The arc of Gelles's career, from personal to community, from solitary to cooperative, reveals her continued exploration of art for social purpose and personal inquiry.. As Ann Landi reflected, \\"Gelles has been around long enough to have lived through the many changes that have affected the lives of women, but she approaches her subjects with warmth, humor, and consummate skill.\\" Of her projects involving architectural structures, one gallery observed such \\"works take a similar taxonomic approach to understanding the politics of space, raising questions about the manner in which our quarters define, connect, and divide us.\\" Martin Rosenberg, chair of the Rutgers University Department of Fine Arts, calls Gelles' Florida family photos \\"an amazing body of work because you see the children grow up, you see the parents age, you see the grandparents age and die. She lived through the entirety of the second wave of feminism, and her work has been long caught in the nexus of feminism, motherhood, finding a career, and developing as an artist. It's all about human relationships.\\" Despite recognition later in her career, Gelles was aware of implicit sexist bias with regard to her emphasis on domestic life. She ‚Äúfelt like a lone wolf. At the time nobody wanted to show the work.‚Äù By the time of her death, her early work of her daily experience as a wife and mother became a touchstone statement for contemporary considerations of women and family.

He is an expert on topics related to Indigenous architecture and vernacular architecture, housing, homelessness and overcrowding.  Early life  Paul Memmott was born to married couple Estelle \\"Cootch\\" Powell and Harry Memmott who were both pottery artists. He took art classes from Mervin Moriarty before enrolling at the University of Queensland. His program was influenced by student protests of human rights at the University in the late 1960s and early 1970s, as well as lecturers who considered art and architectural psychology as integral to the discipline. He tutored in art and exhibited as part of the Contemporary Art Society, Queensland. He graduated with a B.Arch in 1972.  Career  As part of his professional placement Memmott worked for the Queensland State Works Department and was recruited to join a project organised by Nugget Coombs to visit Mt Isa and Cloncurry where an Aboriginal community centre was to be constructed. He and fellow students formed a group called the Aboriginal Development Group as they looked at the fringe camps of the region, many before they were destroyed. The group would become the precursor of the Aboriginal Environments Research Centre at the University of Queensland. His analysis of Indigenous design led to a post graduate scholarship on the spatial behaviour of Aboriginal people in North West Queensland. Memmott studied social anthropology in 1974 and commenced his PhD, with Bruce Rigsby as one of his supervisors. He helped establish an Aboriginal Data Archive in 1976. He completed his PhD in 1979 at the University of Queensland. He established a research consultancy practice in 1980, for architectural and anthropological work. This led to work in Aboriginal land rights claims, native title claims and submissions to courts. Memmott is a lecturer at the University of Queensland and is a Director of the Aboriginal Environments Research Centre at the University. Memmott has published over 300 publications and has supervised over 50 postgraduate students.

Her father was a federal judge and state legislator, and a Confederate States Army officer during the American Civil War. Her mother was from Alabama. Governor, senator, and Speaker of the House James Lawrence Orr was her uncle. Orr attended a boys' school, because she wanted to learn Latin and mathematics. She pursued further education at Packer Collegiate Institute in New York, and studied German at the Diehl School for Oratory.Wilkerson-Freeman, Sarah. \\"Pauline Van de Graaf Orr (1861-1955): Feminist Education in Mississippi\\" in Martha H.

Later in life, in 1912, she earned a master's degree from Columbia University.  Career  From 1885, when the school opened, Orr was head of the English department at Mississippi's new Industrial Institute and College for the Education of White Women (now the Mississippi University for Women). She remained on the school's faculty for 28 years, until her resignation in 1913. One of her students was writer Blanche Colton Williams. Orr said of her career at the Institute, \\"I have desired, above everything else, the mental enfranchisement of the girls of Mississippi. I have tried to help them to realize and express themselves.\\" Orr was also a sought-after speaker off-campus. In 1891, she spoke on women's education to the Mississippi Teachers' Association. In 1915, she spoke on \\"Women's Clubs and Modern Industrial Life\\" at the Carnegie Library in Jackson, Mississippi. After leaving academia, Orr was active in the Mississippi Woman Suffrage Association, and testified in favor of women's suffrage at a hearing in the Mississippi State House of Representatives in 1914. In 1915, she became president of the association, and in that capacity lectured across the state, attended suffrage meetings in other states, and organized local suffrage groups and events. She was also active in the Daughters of the American Revolution.  Personal life and legacy  Orr had a long personal relationship with a fellow faculty member, classicist Miriam Greene Paslay. They lived together, and traveled together in Europe during joint sabbaticals in 1893 and 1905. The pair moved to New York City together in 1920, and shared a home with Orr's nephew and a former student. Paslay died in 1932, and Orr died in 1955, aged 89 years, in New York. In her nineties, she could still recite passages from Chaucer, and enjoyed visits with former students. A building on the campus of the Mississippi University for Women was named in her honor in 1954. It currently houses the university's Center for Women's Research and Public Policy.

Life and career = Early life = Miguel Jorge was born in Havana, Cuba in 1928. He displayed a high degree of intellect and an interest in art and design early in life, leading Jorge to pursue extensive academic studies in fine art and architecture. He studied architecture in the University of Havana, where he also took courses in color dynamics under Josef Albers of Yale, a mentor of his. During his upbringing and studies in Cuba he became strongly influenced by the art of Amelia Pel√°ez, one of the leaders of Cuba's Vanguardia movement. In 1953 he enrolled in the Harvard Graduate School of Design where he studied under famed Bauhaus modernist architect Walter Gropius. He gained early recognition in the arts for his exhibitions in Havana's prestigious Lyceum in the 1950s and had become close to the prominent G√≥mez-Mena family of Spaniard nobility and Cuban aristocracy by way of the Cuban sugar industry. They would become early supporters and patrons of his work and financed many of his trips to Europe and particularly Spain where they had property and strong ties. Among them were the Countess of Revilla de Camargo Mar√≠a Luisa G√≥mez-Mena the elder and her niece the leading Cuban art patron Mar√≠a Luisa G√≥mez-Mena the younger. The family was also tied by the marriage of Jos√© G√≥mez-Mena to other Cuban sugar barons such as the Fanjul family. Through the G√≥mez-Mena family Jorge was connected to other prominent collectors such as the Duchess of Alba. With the support of the G√≥mez-Mena family Jorge furthered his own personal studies in the arts with frequent visits to Paris, Madrid, Rome, and New York City. Despite this early success in the arts, architecture would be Jorge's main career until achieving broader artistic recognition in the United States during the 1970s. Following Fidel Castro‚Äôs rise to power in the Cuban Revolution, Jorge emigrated to first to Spain where he studied art in the Madrid School of Bellas Artes. In 1963 he returned to the United States. Throughout much of the 1960s he lived in New York where he studied at the Parsons School of Design. In 1968 he joined his mother in Miami, Florida and became part of the Cuban diaspora community in exile there. Jorge would subsequently work as a senior draftsman in architecture firms based in South Florida. Architecture would be an important influence on his art and connected him to several key figures of Miami‚Äôs early Latin art community, including Jes√∫s Permuy, Baruj Salinas, and Rafael Consuegra, each of whom shared architecture backgrounds. =Miami art career= Jorge continued to paint avidly while in his architecture career in Miami, though he sought to transition into a greater focus on his art. A major challenge to Cuban exile artists in the 1960s and 1970s was the lack of institutional support for Latin American artists. During this early period, two groups of established artists would come to shape the emerging Latin American Art market of South Florida. The first was the Grupo GALA (Grupo de Artistas Latinoamericanos), the first professional association of Latin artists in South Florida, whose membership was made up of the artists Baruj Salinas, Enrique River√≥n, Rosana McAllister, Rafael Soriano, Jos√© Mijares, and Osvaldo Guti√©rrez. GALA was noted for its prominent members and highly disciplined approach with regular meetings, scheduled group exhibitions, and official catalogs. The second group was the trio of Miguel Jorge, Lourdes Gomez Franca, and Dionisio (‚ÄúDenis‚Äù) Perkins. Their group was considered more informal and eccentric though also a significant force in Miami's early art scene with each going on to win awards and critical recognition. The three formed a close friendship that extended back to Cuba and would influenced each of their careers as well as those of younger generations of artists that followed this period in establishing the modern Miami art market, now dominated by Cuban and Latin American art. The three would influence their respective styles, assist each other professionally, and often attend social events as a group. =Recognition and death= Jorge was a neighbor of famed Cuban artist Juan Gonz√°lez while they resided within the main business and cultural hub of Coral Gables during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Following Gonz√°lez‚Äôs pivotal move to New York City where he would go on to achieve international success, Gonz√°lez‚Äôs former apartment and art studio would be converted into the Permuy Gallery, among the first Cuban fine art galleries in the United States. The gallery would become a significant cultural nexus that contributed to the establishment of Miami‚Äôs modern art market. Due to Jorge‚Äôs close proximity to the gallery, as well as his architecture background, Jorge became close to the gallery‚Äôs owners, architect and community leader Jes√∫s Permuy, and his first wife, prominent Coral Gables art dealer and patron Marta Permuy. This led to Jorge, Gomez Franca, and Perkins quickly becoming frequent fixtures of the Permuys' popular ‚ÄúFridays‚Äù event series of weekly exhibition openings followed by evening salon gatherings. The three would also be represented by Marta Permuy, the gallery‚Äôs general manager, and exhibited there regularly in the 1970s. As their visibility increased, Jorge further immersed himself in the gallery‚Äôs growing network and social orbit, which included business, cultural, and political figures in the greater South Florida area. One prominent member of this network that became a major collector of Jorge‚Äôs work was Cuban and Latin American art collector Marcos F. Pinedo and his wife Josefina Camacho Pinedo. To reflect Jorge‚Äôs close association with this early Latin art network, he created an original artwork to serve as a uniquely recognizable sign to be displayed whenever the gallery was closed. Jorge would go on to have a pivotal solo exhibition there in 1973 titled ‚ÄúMiguel Jorge: One Man Show‚Äù that led to a subsequent solo exhibition the following year at the Bacardi Gallery, owned by the multinational Bacardi Corporation, which exposed Jorge to a national audience. Over the ensuing decade Jorge would build on this exposure with increased media interviews, public engagements, and exhibitions in numerous locations throughout South Florida (Coral Gables, Miami, Coconut Grove), Detroit, and Spain (Madrid, Malaga) and remained close with Gomez Franca and Perkins, maintaining weekly meetings. A year after his Bacardi exhibition Jorge appeared on Enfoque, a popular spanish-language television program, where he was interviewed to discuss his views on contemporary art. The program aired on September 28, 1975 and was covered by the Miami Herald. Through the 1970s he had also been commissioned to paint several public art murals in South Florida and in Europe. In 1976 he painted a series of three murals for the Nova Club of Miami which were unveiled with an extensive exhibition of his work that featured over 30 paintings, including several from his Profeta (Prophet) series. On February 2, 1977 he gave a high-profile lecture on the art of Amelia Pel√°ez, a major influence of his, and the Cubist movement sponsored by the Miami-Dade Public Library System. In October of that year he also organized and led the illustrated conference \\"Jose Miguel Rodriguez: A Caribbean Painter in the Middle of Castille\\" in Miami. In 1978 Jorge was one of the featured artists included in the Lowe Art Museum's first traveling exhibition, which included a showing in the Museum of Modern Art of Latin America in Washington D.C. In the early 1980s Jorge was one of the central figures in organizing the landmark \\"Miami Generation\\" exhibitions, the first to focus on the generation of Cuban exile artists that were educated in South Florida and not by Cuban art institutions such as the Academia San Alejandro. This furthered his influence and impact on younger generations of Cuban and Latin American artists such as Humberto Calzada, who Jorge mentored. Even as his artistic recognition increased, Jorge continued to struggle with his mental health and suffered from depression. He died of suicide in 1984 at the age of 56 in Miami, Florida. Style Miguel Jorge‚Äôs artwork reflected his personality, which ranged from mercurial, sensitive, witty, acerbic, and self- critical. Jorge‚Äôs art utilized intricate, eccentric, and unpredictable geometric patterns informed by architecture that often incorporated ambiguous images, hidden images, angles and fragmenting effects. In addition to architecture, Jorge also drew influence from the art of Amelia Pel√°ez as well as Cubist approaches and themes rooted in psychological introspection, spirituality, and his Cuban cultural heritage. His subjects included the Madonna and child, Cuban tropical scenes, other figurative works such as still lifes and faces, as well as other works approaching total abstraction. Like his close associates Lourdes Gomez Franca and Dionisio Perkins, Jorge - the oldest of the three - is considered part of the modernist Vieja Guardia of Cuban Art that followed the Vanguardia movement. However, in a departure from their most identifiable bodies of work, color is not typically a dominant presence in Jorge‚Äôs art. Showing another influence of architecture, Jorge instead used color to highlight and draw contrast to form, figures, and patterns in order to keep these elements at the forefront. Jorge often utilized tropical flourishes that meshed the rigidity of both organic and mechanized elements with flowing and branch-like embellishments, such leaves. When he applied this approach to subjects such as faces, as in his Profeta (‚ÄúProphet‚Äù) series of female faces, it would create surrealistic effects informed by his psychological and intellectual approach. Cuban art scholar and former Director of the Museum of Modern Art of Latin America Jose Gomez-Sicre wrote the introduction for Jorge's work exhibited in the Lowe Museum's 1978 traveling exhibition and described Jorge' style as ‚Äúgliding from melodious curves to cutting edges [...] mixing and forming shapes to make baroque tangles with insinuations of vines or wicker.‚Äù Jorge's mediums included watercolor, acrylic paint, pastels, marker, and oil paintings on either canvas or sketching paper. Jorge typically signed his works with an addition sign (+) followed by Miguel Jorge, Mickey Jorge, MJ, or simply Jorge. Reputation and Legacy Miguel Jorge‚Äôs career has been discussed in published literature of Cuban, Latin American, and American art, including the books Cuban-American Art in Miami: Exile, Identity and the Neo-Baroque and The Cuban-American Experience: Culture, Images, and Perspectives, as well as media and literary publications such as The Miami Herald, The Miami Times, the American Library Association‚Äôs Choice and Latin American art journal Resumen. Jorge exhibited extensively in both individual and group showings throughout Cuba, Spain, and the United States. In 1981 Jorge won the Central National Bank of Miami Award at the Metropolitan Museum of Fine Art. He is credited as founding member Miami‚Äôs Latin American art market and became closely associated with other leading participants, including the Grupo GALA, Juan Gonz√°lez, the Permuys, and particularly Dionisio Perkins and Lourdes Gomez Franca. In his final years Jorge helped spearhead the landmark \\"Miami Generation\\" exhibitions to spotlight and support the first generation of Cuban exile artists that were educated in South Florida and the United States. His work with Gomez Franca and Perkins would also influence younger generations of Miami artists, such as the ‚ÄúMiami Generation‚Äù of the 1980s. Notable examples include Humberto Calzada, who Jorge mentored, and Pablo Cano, who would eventually collaborate extensively with Gomez Franca beginning in the 1980s and 1990s. Gomez Franca dedicated her 1989 poetry collection The Thorns are Green My Friend to Jorge after his death. Jorge‚Äôs artwork is featured in several prominent collections of Latin American Art, including the Lowe Art Museum as well as the Permuy and Pinedo Collections.

In March 2019, the company filed for land development permits to begin construction by demolishing several small preexisting buildings on the site. Around this time, the developers clarified that the residential units would be market rate apartments and not condominiums. By December 2019, these permits were still waiting for review by the city, with no firm construction schedule in place at that time. However, by March 2020, CA Ventures secured a $101 million construction loan for the site, and the buildings at the site were demolished the following month.

She was the daughter of Tomasa Erostarbe and Cipriano Tiz√≥n, a photographer and owner of a photography shop. She met Juan Domingo Per√≥n during the years of his military career, in 1925; she was working as a teacher at the time. They became a couple, and Per√≥n affectionately called her \\"Potota,\\" a childish play on the word \\"preciosa,\\" meaning \\"precious.\\" Per√≥n and Tiz√≥n married in a private ceremony on January 5, 1929, and they honeymooned in Bariloche.

Her debut novel, A Blade So Black, was released in September 2018. McKinney created the PublishingPaidMe Twitter hashtag in June 2020 to highlight racial disparities in writers' advance payments.  Career  McKinney enjoyed reading and writing from childhood. She studied video game design in college and went on to work at Hallmark as a greeting card writer. She held the position after the publication of her first book. McKinney published her debut novel A Blade So Black in fall 2018. The book is the first in the Nightmare-Verse series and is a contemporary retelling of Alice in Wonderland with a Black teenage girl protagonist. The second in the series, A Dream So Dark was released in September 2019 and a third is slated for 2021 release. In May 2020 she announced her forthcoming YA novel and first graphic novel, Nubia: Real One. It is a coming-of-age story about a Black girl with superhuman strength, and is an iteration of the character Nubia who debuted in Wonder Woman in 1976 as the DC Universe's first Black woman superhero. The book will be released by DC in February 2021.  Twitter activity  McKinney is an active member of the YA Twitterverse. In early 2019 McKinney was one of several writers who used Twitter to criticize the planned publication of Blood Heir by Am√©lie Wen Zhao due to its treatment of the book's African American characters. In February 2020, she used her account to protest Barnes & Noble's Diverse Edition collection, an initiative introduced for Black History Month featuring covers of classic books re- printed with people of color as the protagonists, including books like Frankenstein and Peter Pan. She referred to the campaign as \\"literary blackface\\" and recommended that the bookstore instead release classic Black literature with updated covers. The store cancelled the campaign in response to the criticism. On June 6, 2020 McKinney created the hashtag #PublishingPaidMe for writers to share their advance payments from publishing contracts, and in particular to highlight racial disparities between Black and white writers. She developed the hashtag in concert with the worldwide protests related to institutional racism that took place after the killing of George Floyd. McKinney was inspired by a Tweet from YA author Tochi Onyebuchi asking writers to share advance information for the sake of transparency. A spreadsheet was also created based on survey data collected by McKinney through Twitter, which amounted to over 1,200 entries. The data showed that Black writers often receive far lower advances compared to white writers, even after winning major awards, such as N. K. Jemisin.  Personal life  McKinney resides in Kansas City, Kansas.  Works  *A Blade So Black. 2018. Imprint/Macmillan, publication date 25 September 2018. * A Dream So Dark. 2019.

The episode was written by Molly Ostertag from a story co-written with Terrace and Rachel Vine, while Stu Livingston directed the episode. The episode was noted by several critics for its reveal that secondary character Amity Blight has a crush on Luz Noceda, with many seeing it as a major step for LGBT representation in Disney media. Terrace, who is bisexual said that she has wanted to include a bisexual character in the series, but initially struggled to get approval from Disney executives, through Disney eventually approved it. Plot While learning to make a Plant spell, Luz receives a text from her mother, Camila, asking how she is. Luz panics, as her mother believes that she's in a summer camp and is unaware that she's in another world learning how to be a witch, and responds that she is fine. After going to magic school Hexside, Luz discovers from friends Willow and Gus that a ceremony named \\"Grom\\", which somewhat resembles a prom, is coming to the school. Luz's other friend, Amity Blight, is selected as the Grom Queen, much to Luz's joy. However, Amity is sad about being chosen. While checking on the decorations for the Grom, Luz finds weapons, to which Amity reveals to her that the Grom Queen has to fight against Grometheus, a monster living below the school that takes the form of into anybody's worst fears, to prevent it from escaping and consuming the Boiling Islands. Seeing how Amity is reluctant to do, Luz suggests talking to Principal Bump out of it. Upon returning to the Owl House, Luz learns that her mentor, Eda, will be a chaperone at the Grom, while their roommate, King, will be the dance's emcee with Gus. Later, while walking through the forest, she finds Amity, who reveals that she will only be no longer Grom Queen if she can find a replacement, to which Luz offers herself. The next day, Amity and her siblings, Edric and Emira, help Luz prepare to fight Grometheus by creating illusions of her worst fears. That night, during the Grom dance, King is revealed to have stage fright and struggles to work as an emcee. Later, Luz's duel starts, and initially manages to hold off against Grometheus, until it takes the form of her greatest fear: Her mother learning of her witch training. Terrified, Luz runs from the school, causing everyone to panic, until King overcomes his stage fright and calms them down, directing the students towards the fight. As Luz tries to run from Grometheus, Eda appears to hold it on so she can run. However, Amity shows up and apologizes to Luz for having her fight Grometheus instead of doing it herself. As Amity faces Grometheus, the monster manifests Amity's greatest fear, which is revealed to be rejection from an unknown individual whom she wanted to be ask to Grom as her date, by taking the individual's physical appearance and tearing Amity's invitation letter in half. Upon watching it, Luz comforts Amity and offers to accompany her instead. Luz and Amity then dance-fight against Grometheus and manages to defeat it. As everyone celebrates their victory, Luz asks whom Amity wanted to be her date, but Amity dismisses the subject and throws her letter away. The letter is then revealed to be addressed towards Luz. Back in the Owl House, Luz finally sends a text to her mother about her experiences, albeit keeping it vague enough for her to be unaware of the Boiling Islands. Camila then responds by saying that she loves Luz letters, which Luz believes means her texts. However, it is revealed that someone has been sending her mother letters while claiming to be Luz... Production \\"Enchanting Grom Fright\\" was written by Molly Ostertag under a story from Ostertag, series creator Dana Terrace, and Rachel Vine, with storyboards by Charlie Bryant, Emmy Cicierega, Cat Harman-Mitchell, Hayley Foster, Madeleine Flores, Chris Pianka, and Spencer Wan. The episode was directed by Stu Livingston. Terrace has wanted to create an episode for the series centered on a prom-like concept ever since starting development on the show. She has also wanted to feature main LGBT characters in the series, as she is bisexual herself. However, while the idea has been \\"extremely supported\\" by executives at Disney, it was initially unapproved by \\"a certain Disney leadership\\", but was eventually approved. Wan, who storyboarded the dance sequence in the episode with Foster, referred to it as \\"the gay thing\\", and said that it was the first opportunity he had to storyboard \\"anything even remotely queer\\". Early drafts for the episode had a different prom-like concept, in which \\"P.R.O.M.\\" were the initials for \\"Perennial Ritual Offering Maiden\\", but was later changed during production. Reception The episode received universally positive reviews. Several critics highlighted the episode due to its confirmation of Amity's crush towards Luz. Several news outlets, such as Variety and NY Post said that the episode \\"made history\\" for including Disney's first main bisexual character. At the same time, Marcelo Garcia of CBR said that the episode was \\"a tremendous step in the right direction for Disney, a company that has struggled with LGBTQ+ representation in recent years.\\" Other critics also reviewed the episode positively. For instance, Palmer Harsch of Insider wrote that the episode \\"helped Disney Channel make a major step forward in terms of LGBTQ representation\\", and hoped the episode could serve as \\"a harbinger of further LGBTQ stories to come on Disney Channel.\\" Similarly, Kirby Beaton of Buzzfeed argued that \\"queer content on the Disney Channel is a huge stride in queer representation\\" while Matt Tracy of Gay City News stated that the series' portrayal of LGBT characters is \\"a refreshing development considering the lack of queer representation in animated television during recent years.\\" Additionally, Petrana Radulovic of Polygon praised the dance sequence between Luz and Amity as \\"ADORABLE and beautifully animated.\\" At the same time, some argued that the show's LGBTQ representation falls on the shoulders of the writers and creators of The Owl House instead of Disney while Michele Kirichanskaya of The Mary Sue wrote that shows like The Owl House, in tandem with She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, and The Prom, it breaks down \\"old heteronormative traditions\\" of prom itself. PFLAG praised the series for its LGBTQ+ visibility, while GLAAD similarly praised it for having an \\"inclusive, fair, accurate, and age-appropriate world through the representation of its characters\\". Doc McStuffins creator Chris Nee praised the series' inclusivity towards LGBTQ+ characters, while also noting how she struggled with including a multiracial lesbian couple in the Doc McStuffins episode \\"The Emergency Plan\\". Similarly, The Owl House voice actor Alex Hirsch thanked Terrace and the production team for including LGBT characters, while noting how he was forbidden to include LGBT characters in his own show, Gravity Falls. Hirsch also commented how the dancing sequence would be considered \\"inappropriate\\" by Disney in 2012, saying that Disney \\"did good\\" by allowing the scene to be featured. Also, Noelle Stevenson, creator of She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, invited her wife and the episode's co-writer Molly Ostertag to Grom, sharing their \\"Grom experience\\" with their followers.

He lives in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England, which is the focus of much of his activism. Steele describes himself as a \\"Weapons Expert\\", claiming to have worked on undisclosed projects for the Ministry of Defence. According to his Facebook profile, Steele has a degree in psychology and social sciences from The Open University. Promotion of conspiracy theories = 5G conspiracy theory = Steele claims that 5G networks are a deadly technology which have killed over 400 people. According to Steele, the 5G telephone network is part of a distributed \\"Kill Grid\\" which includes other street-furniture such as lamp-posts. He has repeated claims first disseminated by David Icke, that 5G networks are the cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2018, Steele addressed the Democrats and Veterans Party, on the subject of 5G Networks. The video of his speech was widely shared on YouTube. In 2019, he spoke at the \\"5G Apocalypse event\\", organised by \\"Bali- based New Age influencer Sacha Stone\\". BuzzFeed News and Vice News have reported that Steele and Stone used such events as well as legal defence funds to make money from their followers. According to Steele, children are being ‚Äúmicrowaved in their beds‚Äú by 5G. = Gateshead council trial = Steele's activism has focused on Gateshead council, who he claims are \\"secretly trialling the technology, causing cancer and microwaving babies in their beds\\". Steele has also described Gateshead councillors as ‚Äúbaby killers‚Äù. In 2016, Steele began investigating newly installed street-lighting when a neighbour complained that it was causing nosebleeds. Steele became convinced that the street-lights contained 5g technology. Steele claims that the installation of 5G equipment in Gateshead has destroyed the local sparrow population. Gateshead council issued a statement that, contrary to Steele's claims, street-lighting does not cause cancer. Steele's claims were publicised by the Daily Mail, causing the story to go viral online. In October of 2018, Steele won a court case overturning a July 2018 \\"gagging order\\", which had previously prevented him from blogging his claims on his personal website, but was placed under an injunction to stop him harassing council staff and councillors. However, later in October, Steele was convicted of having made threats against members of Gateshead council in April. = COVID 19 denialism = Steel has promoted conspiracy theories and misinformation linking the launch of 5G Networks in Wuhan, China to the COVID-19 pandemic. Steele describes 5G as \\"genocide\\" carried by \\"the deep state\\". When asked about links between 5G and coronavirus, Steele told The New York Times: \\"It's looking a bit suspicious, don't you think?\\" In May 2020, Twitter began labelling his posts about 5G and the pandemic as \\"misinformation\\". In September 2020, he spoke at an anti-lockdown rally in Glasgow. On 19 September, Steele claimed that he has ‚Äúraised tens of thousands‚Äù for the anti-mask and anti-lockdown causes, without any evidence to support his claim. Steele and fellow anti- vaccine campaigner and conspiracy theorist Kate Shemirani have been described as \\"controlled opposition\\" by supporters of David Icke and Piers Corbyn, both of whom have distanced themselves from a 19 September 2020 protest.  Shooting conviction  In 1993, Steele was convicted of the accidental shooting of a teenage girl, who had been hit by a shot from a hand-gun fired by Steele during an argument outside the Redskins Pub, Washington, Tyne and Wear. Steele, who was working as a bouncer at the pub, claimed that he was concerned about his safety and brandished the weapon out of \\"bravado\\". In court, Steele admitted to unlawful wounding, possession of a firearm with an intent to endanger life and illegal possession of ammunition. Steele was sentenced to a prison sentence of 8 years. The victim survived with significant paralysis.  Personal life  Steele is known to associate with far-right individuals. In 2019, he was photographed with a member of the far- right Islamophobic English Defence League (EDL).

He held a number of important diplomatic posts, before becoming an influential politician. Diplomatic career He joined the diplomatic service, filling the posts of Minister of Portugal in The Hague (1782‚Äì1788), Rome (1788‚Äì1790), and London (1792‚Äì1801). When in the Court of St James's, in the troubled times of the French Revolution and later the Napoleonic Consulate, Melo e Castro had the thorny mission of keeping neutral as Portugal wavered between France and the United Kingdom. Political career In 1801, Melo e Castro was named Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs and War by John, Prince Regent, with the demanding task of reorganising the Portuguese Army, badly ravaged following the War of the Oranges, due to the imminent threat of the European conflict. When Portugal and France re-established diplomatic relations following the signing of the Treaty of Amiens and the brief interval of peace in Europe, Jean Lannes was sent as the French ambassador to Portugal: he soon clashed with Melo e Castro (who he described as \\"a man of the English\\") and demanded his dismissal (a demand that was soon after endorsed by Napoleon). Melo e Castro was stripped of his office in August 1803. After the transfer of the Portuguese court to Brazil, from Rio de Janeiro, Melo e Castro was briefly Acting Secretary of State of the Navy and the Overseas. From 1812 to 1814, he tried to limit the growing British influence over Portugal as Secretary of State of Foreign Affairs and War. Titles For his services to the Crown, he was granted the title of Viscount of Lourinh√£ in 1797 (a title that had originally belonged to a childless uncle, Manuel Bernardo de Melo e Castro) and, later, on 17 December 1808, he succeeded his great-grandfather, Andr√© de Melo e Castro as Count of Galveias.

She is best known for introducing African fabrics into American fashion in the 1960s and 1970s. Early life and education Hazel Blackman was born Hazel Hyscinth Rodney in Kingston, Jamaica in 1921, to George and Alphasenia Rodney. She was the third of eleven children, including brothers Winston, Neville, Karl and sisters Ivy, Joyce, Winifred and Marcia. She grew up on Slipe Pen Road, in the city‚Äôs Cross Roads Neighborhood. In that neighborhood, she often encountered Marcus Garvey and members of his Universal Negro Improvement Association, whose headquarters were at nearby Edelweiss Park. Her grandfather, George Rodney, owned stock in Garvey‚Äôs Black Star Line, a connection that would surface in her later work. Blackman described her mother as a great sewer. In 1940, Blackman moved from Jamaica to New York to attend the Traphagen School of Fashion in Manhattan. After she graduated, in 1946, she worked as a seamstress, private dressmaker, and sample maker on Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. By the time she struck out on her own, in 1965 she had become an assistant designer. During her years working in the garment district, she continued to take classes, including on jewelry-making, painting on fabrics, and glove-making. Fashion career Blackman started putting on fashion shows as early as 1952, when she gave a show of burlap designs titled ‚ÄúHazel‚Äôs Adventures in Cotton.‚Äù In 1967, asked for advice, she said, ‚ÄúNegro designers should go to school and upon graduation get into the mainstream of fashion, even if it‚Äôs clipping threads.‚Äù Starting in the 1960s, Blackman was a member of the Congress of Racial Equality. In the 1960s Blackman‚Äôs business partner Lionel Phillips brought fabric samples back from a trip to Africa. She started designing with these fabrics as a hobby, and in 1964 her clothing was featured in the New York State Pavilion of the 1964 World‚Äôs Fair. Demand for her designs grew enough that in 1965 she and Phillips started a boutique, The Tree House, on East 147th Street in Manhattan. The boutique was an ‚Äúinstant hit‚Äù, according to Ebony Magazine in 1966. Blackman was widely quoted as saying, ‚ÄúLet other designers go to Paris for inspiration, I‚Äôll take Africa.‚Äù In 1965, the Chicago Defender newspaper called her ‚Äúprobably the only American fashion designer that specializes in African batik.‚Äù Blackman and Phillips imported African fabrics from various countries, including kanga and kitenge fabrics made at Tanzania‚Äôs government- owned Friendship Textile Mill, cobra skin from Morocco, and Akwete cloth from Nigeria. In one interview in 1970, Blackman told a reporter that a ‚Äúdress she designed from hand woven cloth geometrically designed in colors of green, gold and beige is the very last fabric to be had from Biafra.‚Äù In the late 1960s, the Denim Council, a trade group, noticed Blackman‚Äôs unique African fabric designs and asked her to design new looks in denim. She also produced designs for the National Cotton Council. The resulting combination of imported fabrics and new denim fabrics became a signature part of her aesthetic. Blackman produced a variety of styles, from jumpsuits and bell-bottom pants to skirts, dresses, and jackets, made in this unique hybrid style. Her boutiques stocked her designs as well as African-made clothing imported by Phillips from Liberia. Blackman also sold clothing to other boutiques in New York City, as well as stores in Washington, D.C, St. Louis, Kansas City, Portland, and San Francisco. In 1969, Blackman opened a second Tree House boutique, at 286 Lenox Avenue in Harlem, but a series of robberies in the summer after the store‚Äôs opening convinced her to close it. As one reporter put it, Blackman‚Äôs fashions at the Tree House ‚Äúwere later to get reams of publicity when done by other people.‚Äù She once noted that ‚ÄúI never thought that an American fashion business could be built on a djellaba.‚Äù In 1967, Blackman was ‚Äúthe only non- white designer showing at the New York Couture Business Council‚Äôs show for press women,‚Äù a precursor to New York Fashion Week. In 1968, Blackman‚Äôs designs were featured in the Harlem Cultural Festival‚Äôs ‚ÄúFashion ‚Äò68‚Äù show at Mount Morris Park Harlem. In 1969, her designs were featured in the Schaefer brewing company‚Äôs traveling ‚ÄúShow of Stars,‚Äù a prominent fashion show whose theme that year was ‚Äúfashion-power,‚Äù showcasing African American designers. Blackman‚Äôs notable clients included Nina Simone, who reportedly enjoyed her evening gown designs, as well as Marjorie Harding, the prominent wife of New York City‚Äôs first Black fire chief, Robert O. Lowery. Her designs were featured in Vogue, Glamour, Ebony, and The New Yorker, among other fashion publications. Blackman was also a member of New York City Mayor John Lindsay‚Äôs Cultural Development Committee. In 1970, Blackman visited San Francisco to help start two fashion and design cooperatives, in San Francisco and in Oakland. In the 1970s, Blackman also taught at the Jackson Community Center and Senior Citizens Cottage Industry. Blackman told one reporter, ‚ÄúAfrican fabrics defy the laws of design. Stripes are uneven and not equidistant from each other. It‚Äôs enough to drive a designer absolutely mad. And yet, it fascinates me!‚Äù Reflecting on her business in 1971, Blackman said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always had the problem of capital, and I suppose I could have gone much further if I had found backing when I was starting out. However, I‚Äôve enjoyed what I‚Äôve done.‚Äù Quilting career Blackman began quilting after a trip to Alabama in the 1960s, where she made designs for the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, a quilting cooperative, and in the process was inspired to take up the craft herself. Decades later, she helped found the New York chapter of the Women of Color Quilters Network. In a 2005 interview, Blackman said, ‚Äúto make a dynamic quilt is like a dance,‚Äù and reflected that ‚Äúmaking quilts is the last of my episode.‚Äù She made several story quilts, including ones that depicted Jamaican history, such as her quilt ‚ÄúThe Black Star Liner,‚Äù which shows a ship from Marcus Garvey‚Äôs shipping company. Her quilt, ‚ÄúUnity of the Mind,‚Äù which depicts Garvey and Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, is in the collection of Liberty Hall: The Legacy of Marcus Garvey, a museum in Kingston. Poetry and prose One of Blackman's quilts is featured on the cover of Patchwork: Poetry & Prose and Papers & Pictures Anthology book (1999) by Dale Benjamin Drakeford. Several of Blackman's original poems are featured in the anthology. Blackman also wrote an unpublished autobiography titled My Romance with Paint and Fabrics. Death Blackman returned to Jamaica after living decades in the Bronx, New York, then in Tampa, Florida. She died at 93 and is buried at Dovecot Memorial Park in Kingston, Jamaica.

It is a small, erect shrub with densely hairy branchlets, small, spatula-shaped leaves and red to pink flowers. Description Prostanthera grylloana is a erect shrub that typically grows to a height of and has densely hairy branchlets. The leaves are spatula- shaped, long and about wide on a petiole up to about long. Both the petiole and leaf blade have a longitudinal groove so that the two sides of the leaves almost touch. The flowers are arranged singly in leaf axils, each flower on a pedicel long. The sepals are long and form a tube long with two more or less triangular lobes about long and long. The petals are red to dull medium mauve- pink, and fused to form a tube long with two lips. The lower lip has three lobes, the centre lobe more or less triangular, long and wide, the side lobes about long wide. The upper lip is long and wide with a central notch about deep. Flowering occurs in February, May or from September to December. Taxonomy Prostanthera grylloana was first formally described in 1876 by Ferdinand von Mueller in his book Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected \\"in the desert around Ularing\\" by Jess Young. The specific epithet (grylloana) honours the actress Adelaide Ristori, the wife of the marchese Giuliano Capranica del Grillo. Distribution and habitat This mintbush grows on granite outcrops and ridges and on stony hills and undulating plains in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Mallee and Murchison biographic regions of Western Australia.

This ecoregion is distinct from the Eastern Java-Bali montane rain forests, which exists at higher altitudes where mountain forest habitat dominates. Very little of the natural lowland rainforest remains in its pre-human settlement state.  Location and description  The ecoregion covers the lowlands of the eastern half of Java and Bali. Also included are Madura Island and the Kangean Islands off the north coast of Java. The soil is mostly volcanic and alluvial deposits due to the large, active volcanoes in the center, and with some uplifted coral limestone.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical monsoon climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Am)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year (all months being greater than average temperature), and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, but more than (100-(average/25) mm. This climate is mid-way between a tropical rainforest and a tropical savannah. The dry month usually at or right after the winter solstice in the Nothern Hemisphere.  Flora and fauna  About 25% of the region is closed forest, 25% open forest, 35% cultivated/agricultural, and the rest urban or built up. Precipitation levels determine much of the forest character. Through the inland lowlands, the forests are moist deciduous, with 1,500-4,000 mm of precipitation per year and with a four-six months of dry season. Because precipitation levels decline towards the east of Java, these forests are not as wet as in the west. Typical trees in these moist deciduous forests include (Homalium tomentosum), Silk trees (Albizia lebbekoides), and Reonja (Acacia leucophloea) a 20-30 fit tree with yellow flowers. Along the southern coast of the ecoregion are semi-evergreen rain forests, with higher precipitation levels and only two-four months of dry season. Common south coast trees include (Artocarpus elasticus) (of the mulberry family), Yellow mahogany (Dysoxylum caulostachyum) and Duku (Lansium parasiticum). Along the northern coast precipitation levels are dryer (below 1,500 mm/year and with more than six months of dry season), resulting in a dry deciduous forest. Scientists in the ecoregion have recorded 103 species of mammals, notable 15 species of ecologically important fruit bats that provide pollination. Over 350 species of birds have been recorded.  Protected areas  Less than 3% of this ecoregion is official protected.

He has written a number of books and articles advocating for democratic reforms in Gabon. His work with the Gabonese opposition caused his dismissal as a prominent banking executive in the 1970s. He ran as an independent protest candidate in the 1998 Gabonese presidential election. Life and career Edzodzomo-Ela holds a PhD in economics. He worked as a senior executive at the Paribas-Gabon bank from 1975 to 1979, but he was dismissed for his opposition to the regime of Omar Bongo. Ever since his political activity in the 1970s, he has been a prominent member of the pro-democratic Gabonese opposition. Edzodzomo-Ela ran as an independent candidate in the Gabonese presidential election of 1998, where he finished with 1,548 votes, or 0.49% of the votes cast. Edzodzomo-Ela has written a series of books about the political, social, and economic situation of Gabon, including a book-length treatment of Gabonese democracy in the early 1990s and a political manifesto regarding the future of Gabon. He has also contributed journalistic and opinion articles to French African publications like the Libreville news and Cameroun Web, and he has been interviewed or quoted in outlets like the Courier des Afriques and Gabon Review. Much of his political commentary has revolved around the ramifications of the systems established by Omar Bongo, which Edzodzomo-Ela argues have been inconsistent with democracies and fair elections.

He was a member of Band of Talabene (1973), Buster Brown (1975) and Rose Tattoo (1976‚Äì1983). He died of an unspecified cancer in 1991 while being treated for heroin and alcohol addictions.  Biography  Dallas Leslie \\"Digger\\" Royall was born in July 1949, his father was a guitarist. Note: user may have to enter the title/performer for other tracks to access further information. According to Rose Tattoo's official website's biography, from October 1982, \\"[he is] a former Army chopper pilot who's spent the past fifteen years thrashing the kit & the bottle.\\" He started his professional career upon turning 21 and his early groups were swing bands. In 1969 he joined Reeb Revol in Melbourne on drums alongside Ian Gorman, Graham Patrick, Paul Reynolds, Ron Shepherd and Peter Smith. In the following year he was a member of Salty Dog with Gorman on guitar and vocals, Les Catterall on lead vocals, Scotty Ingram on guitar and vocals and Chris Willing on bass guitar. In January 1973 he joined a pop rock group, McAskill, on drums, which were formed in Sydney by Barrie \\"The Bear\\" McAskill on vocals, Michael Barnes on guitar, Steve Doran on organ and Doug Stirling on bass guitar. Soon Alvin Tutin replaced Barnes on guitar and Eddy McDonald took over from Stirling on bass guitar. That group relocated to Melbourne where Royall continued with McAskill and they were joined by Ian Mawson on keyboards (ex-Company Caine), Warren Ward on bass guitar (ex-the Flying Circus, Blackfeather) and Lindsay Wells on guitar (ex-Healing Force, Chain, Blackfeather). Also in 1973 Royall was briefly the drummer for Melbourne-based blues rockers, Band of Talabene. * 2nd Edn: * 1st Edn: In July 1975 he joined hard rock group, Buster Brown, alongside Angry Anderson on lead vocals, Ken Firth on bass guitar (ex-Tully), Billy Miller on guitar and vocals, and Dave Springfield on guitar.McFarlane 'Buster Brown' entry.

Royall and Anderson relocated to Sydney and joined fellow hard rockers, Rose Tattoo, in 1976.McFarlane 'Rose Tattoo' entry. Retrieved 20 May 2010. He was recorded on their first three studio albums, Rose Tattoo (October 1978), Assault & Battery (September 1981) and Scarred for Life (October 1982). Royall was also credited as co-composer for much of the group's first album including the early singles, \\"Rock 'n' Roll Outlaw\\" (September 1978) and \\"One of the Boys\\" (November). His drumming was broadcast on Countdown on \\"Rock 'n' Roll Outlaw\\" in October 1978. He left the group in 1983. Royall formed Illustrated Men in November 1984 with former Rose Tattoo band members, Mick Cocks on guitar (ex-Heaven by then), Gordie Leach on bass guitar, Ian Rilen on lead vocals (X), and Pete Wells on lead guitar.McFarlane, .

He joined Chris Turner's backing band (ex-Buffalo band mate of Wells) and was recorded on the album, Exile (1990). Dallas Leslie Royall died of an unspecified cancer in 1991 while being treated for heroin and alcohol addictions. Anderson told Nick Murphy of the Maitland Mercury, in March 2011, \\"I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound for Glory' single came off... there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.'... But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer \\"Digger\\" Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform.\\" At the ARIA Music Awards of 2006 in August, Rose Tattoo were inducted into the Hall of Fame at the Regent Hotel, Melbourne. In February 2017 Rose Tattoo issued a live album, Tatts ‚Äì Live in Brunswick, which features material from a 1982 concert with Royall on drums.

Description Mount Kinesava is located immediately west of Springdale, towering 3,400-feet (1,030 meters) above the town and the floor of Zion Canyon. Precipitation runoff from this mountain drains into tributaries of the Virgin River. Its nearest higher neighbor is The West Temple, to the northeast. Other notable mountains wthin view from the summit include The Watchman to the east-southeast, Bridge Mountain to the east-northeast, and Mount Spry is positioned to the northeast. This feature's name was officially adopted in 1934 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. It is so named for Kinesava, the Paiute deity of trickery.http://kinesava.com/ZiCC/aboutzicc/whowaskinesava/Ron Kay, Ron Kay's Guide to Zion National Park, Countryman Press, 2008, page 94. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Mount Kinesava. According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below 32 ¬∞F (0 ¬∞C), and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter. Geology Mt. Kinesava geologic map Stratification of sandstone deposits from vast dune fields laid down 175 to 200 million years ago can be seen exposed on the south aspect of the mountain. The uppermost 1,500-ft of this mountain is composed of light-colored Jurassic Navajo Sandstone. Below that layer is deep-red sandstone of the Kayenta Formation, probably best known for its dinosaur tracks, overlying the Springdale Sandstone Member. Continuing lower are the Whitmore Point Member and Dinosaur Canyon Member of the Moenave Formation. Near the base is the Petrified Forest Member of the Chinle Formation, surrounded by landslide deposits.USGS, 2009, page 19 Gallery File:Mount Kinesava from the Chinle Trail.jpg File:Ranch, Grafton Ghost Town, 4-30-14v (14120806300).jpg File:Fly In Ranch and Mt.

It is the sequel to Spelunky (2008) and it was released for Windows and PlayStation 4 in September 2020. The game has received positive reviews from critics. Gameplay Like its predecessor, Spelunky 2 is a 2D platform game. In the game, the player assumes control of Ana, the daughter of the explorer from the first game, who visits the moon in order to find her missing parents. In the game, Ana must navigate deadly underground caves filled with hostile enemies and traps to collect treasures. When Ana dies, she will have to start from the beginning of the level and lose most of her items, and the level is rearranged through procedural generation to present new challenges and paths. Each stage also features several layers which can be explored by the player. New areas, such as the lava-themed Volcana, are introduced. The game features a new liquid physics system, in which fluid will flow naturally throughout a level. In addition, the game introduces new monsters, traps, and ridable mounts. The game also supports four-player online multiplayer, with the introduction of both cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. Development Derek Yu, the creator of the first game, returned to develop the sequel. According to Yu, as he reflected on the development of the first game when he was writing a book about it for Boss Fight Books, he began to have more and more ideas for the sequel. He partnered with BlitWorks, the developer of the PlayStation ports of the first game, for the game's programming. Yu needed to outsource the game's development to BlitWorks because of the sequel's larger scope. Yu intentionally ensured that the game would not be radically different from the first Spelunky as he felt that sequels should be \\"extensions of the previous games\\", and that fans of the first game would feel like they are playing a \\"continuation\\". New features were added to the game, while the original gameplay loop was refined and remixed. Yu strived to create a game world that feels like a \\"living, breathing place\\" in order to keep new players engaged. To achieve this, he added a lot of lore and backstory for the world and the characters. The story, which focuses on the themes of family and kinship, is mostly delivered through journal articles in the game's world and the Base Camp where Ana can interact with the characters she has encountered during her adventure. Sony Interactive Entertainment announced the game at Paris Games Week in October 2017. Initially set to be released in 2019, Yu announced that the game would be delayed to 2020 in August 2019 as development required more time. The game was released for PlayStation 4 on September 15, 2020, and for Windows on September 29, 2020. Reception The game received critical acclaim when it was released, according to review aggregator Metacritic, with an average score of 91. Writing for The A.V. Club, William Hughes praised how the game embraced the success of the original game and seamlessly incorporated new features such as the turkey mounting system.

This case was among the most extensive and costliest investigations in Austrian history. For a long time, the investigators believed that a single serial killer was responsible for the murders. It was not until the introduction of DNA profiling and a DNA database that the murderers of Schriefl and Strau were arrested, in 2000 and 2001, respectively. Christina Beranek's killing is the only unsolved case left, although the public prosecutor and investigators alike believe that Herbert P., the man convicted of killing Alexandra, killed her as well.  Murder of Alexandra Schriefl  On the night of October 26, 1988, Austria's national day, 20-year-old Alexandra Schriefl, a local saleswoman, was attacked, abused and strangled. She had previously been to the \\"Azzurro\\" discotheque on Himberger Street with some friends, and was last seen at a nearby telephone booth around 2:30, from where she called her boyfriend to pick her up. When the boyfriend arrived, however, Alexandra was gone. When she had not shown up in the morning, a search was initiated. It was not until eleven hours after she vanished that he naked body was found tied to a tree behind a billboard on Himberger Street. She had been strangled with her own sweater and stockings. The investigators looked for a masked man who had molested and attacked women in this area several times since July, a cab driver who, according to testimony, had spoken to Alexandra and was seen in front of the discotheque, as well as three young boys who, according to another testimony, were seen following Schriefl after she had left the building. Within a few weeks, more than 500 people were questioned, including visitors to the discotheque and a nearby bowling alley, as well as sex offenders living in the area. However, the culprit remained unidentified. On November 11, 1988, Alexandra Schriefl was buried in the Vienna Central Cemetery, with her funeral attended by over 250 mourners.  Murder of Christina Beranek  On February 2, 1989, 10-year- old Christina Beranek disappeared while on her way home from school on Josef- Enslein-Platz in Favoriten. She was last seen alive shortly before 5 PM, when she bought a Mickey Mouse notebook from a tobacconist in Per-Albin-Hansson- Siedlung. After searching for her, Christina's father found her on the 14th floor of house number 2 on Per-Albin-Hansson-Siedlung, at around 11 AM the following morning. The girl was partially undressed, abused, strangled and tied with her clothes to the railing. Forensics determined that she was killed between 5 and 10 PM the day before, with the perpetrator intercepting her shortly after she visited the tobacconist a few meters away from her house. It remained unclear whether he killed her immediately or moved her to another place in the house first. The girl's school bag had been discarded on the lower floor, which contained an universal key purchaseable from hardware stores. The investigators immediately established a connection to Schriefl's murder, as this crime scene was less than a five minute walk away and the perpetrator had acted in a similar manner. In addition, in both cases, the killer had taken an article of clothing as a \\"trophy\\". The police suspected the perpetrator lived in Per-Albin-Hansson-Siedlung, one of the largest municipal housing estates in Vienna, with over 11,000 inhabitants at the time. What followed was the most extensive investigation in Austrian criminal history. The investigators examined around 1,000 people in Favoriten alone, including all 580 male residents of the complex who were older than 13 years. In addition, all 650 apartments were checked, in one case even with a court order. The entire floor on which Christina had been murdered was cut off and taken to the laboratory, with assistance provided by the Wiesbaden department of the German Federal Police. Hundreds of posters were put up in the area, on which Christina was shown in a color photo montage with the clothes she had worn on the day of her murder, with the Viennese municipality assuming all costs. The award for vital information about the crime was 160,000 schillings (around 22,000 euros on present-day currency). On February 13th, the officials finally believed that they had caught their killer: an officer from Lower Austria, who had been stationed in Vienna years ago tracked down 20-year-old Werner K. In 1984, he had sexually molested nine little girls in elevators in Per-Albin-Hansson-Sindlung, including one at the staircase where Beranek's body was found. The officers also found out that he had gone to the same school as Schriefl, and had no credible alibi for the night of the murder. Despite these coincidences, he was exonerated by a blood group test for Schrielf's killing, and proved to have a solid alibi on the night of Christina's death. On February 17th, Christina Beranek was buried in the crematorium of the Vienna Central Cemetery. Among the more than 400 mourners was then-Interior Minister Franz L√∂schnak.  Murder of Nicole Strau  On December 22, 1990, around 5:30 PM, 8-year-old Nicole Strau was on her way home after visiting her uncle, who lived in Simmeringer Hauptstrasse. She used tram line 71 and then changed to bus 15 A, but after that, her trail was lost. Her body was found the next day at around 10:20 AM in the Laa Forest. The forensic examination determined that Nicole had been raped, with the cause of death being strangulation, her killer using a broken branch to beat her and her shoelaces to ultimately strangle her. In this case, over 1,600 people were investigated for possible involvement, but the killer remained elusive.Are there any witnesses to the Strau murder? (Wienweb.at) (in German)  Investigation  All three murders occurred in the same area, were young females, raped and strangled. The murders occurred in 26 months, with the killer(s) uncaptured. As the first two victims were murdered in almost identical ways, this led investigators to believe for a long time that they were dealing with a serial offender. Almost 4,000 people were examined and questioned, including hundreds of men who had already been convicted of sexual offenses. Additional investigations conducted by the crew of Aktenzeichen XY ... ungel√∂st on the murders of Schriefl and Beranek (September 1989) and Strau (January 1991) failed to uncover new leads. At that time, there were no genealogical tests in Austria, only the less precise blood group tests. When the DNA database was introduced on October 1, 1997, Alexandra Schrielf's DNA was among the first to be included. The only thing missing now was a sample from a suspect.  Arrests and convictions  In September 2000, chance came to aid the investigators. Herbert P. (born 1968) was involved in a scuffle and attacked the intervening police officers, for which he was therefore arrested for civil disobedience. At the time, it was customary to take an oral cavity swab from suspect for this class of offenses, including for Herbert P. Three weeks later, a DNA match was made to the Schriefl case. Herbert P. was arrested on October 1, 2000, on suspicion of murder. He was among the first suspects questioned after the night of the murder in 1988, but due to a mistake at the Forensic Medicinal Institute in Vienna, an incorrect blood type was determined from him, and he was eliminated as a suspect. As a result, the files for other two murders were reviewed anew. The 25 closest suspects in the Nicole Strau case were again scrutinized, with the criminalists asking each of them for a DNA sample. Only one, Michael P. (born 1966), a known criminal, could not be located. At the time of Nicole's murder, he was in a relationship with her aunt, from whom he received an alibi at the time. On September 27, 2001, he was arrested near his home. He refused both to testify and to give a DNA sample, much like he did back in the 1990s, and was simply forgotten. This time, however, he was ordered by a judge to give a sample, which was applied in spite of his persistent refusals. On November 28th, he was linked to Strau's murder via his DNA. In the meantime, Herbert P. was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment on December 11, 2011, for Alexandra Schriefl's murder, spared from the maximum sentence of 19 years. On June 13, 2002, his appeal was discarded and the sentence finalized. He was additionally charged with Beranek's murder, but since DNA traces couldn't be acquired anymore, the proceedings were discontinued. Criminal psychologist Thomas M√ºller and public prosecutor Ernst Kloyber testified, however, that Herbert P. was certainly guilty of the killing.Schriefl murder: Supreme Court confirms 15 years imprisonment term (in German)Beranek murder case remains unsolved: proceedings are discontinued (in German) On December 2, 2003, Michael P. was sentenced to life imprisonment for Nicole Strau's murder. During the sentencing, the jury's decisions caused a stir. Although the chances were less than one in a quadrillion according to forensic medicine, one of the jurors pointed out to another person with the same genetic characteristics. For example, there was a 7:1 guilty decision on the sexual abuse charge. Even more astonishing, however, was the fact that two of the jurors believed him to the rapist, but not the killer. For the murder charge, the decision was 5:3 for his guilt. If only one other juror had voted otherwise, the decision would have been 4:4 and the accused would have been acquitted.Judgment in the Nicole Strau murder case: Life sentence for Michael P. (in German)  Television  An episode from the documentary series Im Kopf des Verbrechers, presented by Joe Bausch, was dedicated to this case.

The different locations vary greatly in their vegetation and wildlife habitat depending on the local soil types. The land has been greatly disturbed by human conversion to agriculture and illegal logging in recent years. Several of the sectors support significant populations of Asian elephants (Elephas maximus)'.  Location and description  The sectors of the ecoregion tend to be bounded on the south by Sumatran lowland rain forests, and on the northern side by Sumatran peat swamp forests. The freshwater swamps differ from the Peat swamp forest in having less waterlogged soil, more fertile soils, and more water derived from rivers and rainwater. The freshwater swamps are all on low plains, with the maximum elevation in the ecoregion only 63 meters.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical rainforest climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Af)). This climate is characterized as hot, humid, and having at least 60 mm of precipitation every month.  Flora and fauna  Trees in swamps must be able to endure prolonged periods of inundation, and many species have developed buttresses, stilt roots, and pneumatophores (ariel roots with specialized respiratory structures). Common species of trees include (Adina) (a shrub/tree of the coffee family), (Alstonia) (large trees producing commercially valuable timber), (Campnosperma) (of the cashew family), (Mallotus), the evergreen (Dillenia), (Dyera) (which can grow to 80 meters in height), Coral tree (Erythrina), and the evergreen (Eugenia). Mammals of conservation interest, aside from the Asian Elephants, include the endangered Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus) (very few left as of 1997), and the endangered Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris). The grasslands in the swamps provide important habitat for waterbirds.  Protected areas  Less than 4% of this ecoregion is officially protected.

The fresh protests were in a large part due to the day having been the scheduled election day for the Legislative Council; on 31 July, the Hong Kong government had the elections postponed by a year, citing the COVID-19 pandemic, a justification that was widely doubted. The unauthorized protests resulted in nearly 300 arrests, one of them on suspected violation of the national security law, and brought the total number of arrests during the entire protests since June 2019 to above 10,000. The national security law continued to exert a major influence both within Hong Kong and internationally, for its perceived devastating effect on the \\"One country, two systems\\" principle forming the foundation of governance in the city, even though Hong Kong and mainland government officials had asserted that it had rather acted as a stabilizer. The state visit of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to five European countries, which concluded on 1 September, was accompanied by protests at each stop, and the topic of Hong Kong was brought up by several of his hosts. The lack of substantial news of twelve detainees who had been caught by Chinese authorities on 23 August in a botched attempt to flee from Hong Kong to Taiwan met with broad condemnation, despite assurances by China that the detained did have legal support. Other news from throughout the month, from disparate areas, suggested that large parts of the population of the city had either rejected the local government's assurances that the national security law would only affect a small minority of the population, or saw the international negative responses and sanctions which were triggered by the law as exacting a heavy and lasting toll on the economy of the city, on top of the just recently calmed third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Events  = 1 September =  International response: Germany  German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas met with China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi as the final stop of Wang's European tour on bilateral talks. Before the meeting, Hong Kong activist Nathan Law along with tens of protesters waving Uighurs' flags and \\"Stand with Hong Kong\\" signs, staged a protest against China's visit. Law also presented a letter to German officials on August 30th, imploring Germany and other European countries to \\"go further\\" in their \\"reassessment of policy towards China\\". In the meeting with Wang, Maas called for the withdrawal of China's national security law in Hong Kong, claiming that Germany wished to see \\"the principle of 'one country, two systems' to be fully applied\\". Maas also brought up the now delayed Hong Kong legislative election, calling for the election to take place \\"quickly and unhindered\\". = 2 September =  Nathan Law urges the West to take action  The day after protesting Wang Yi's presence in Germany, Nathan Law held a 10-minute interview with German news agency Deutsche Welle. In the interview Nathan Law called on Germany and all democratic countries to form a united front of democracy to defend against Communist China's infiltration. Law urged every country to interact with China with dignity, and not to shy away from bringing up human rights issues.  National security law effect: British expat teachers in Hong Kong consider resigning  In interviews with British newspaper Daily Telegraph, British nationals teaching in Hong Kong's international K-12 schools expressed frustration and confusion, mulling resignation while reexamining their lessons as the new school year begins. With the new national security law that intends to criminalize anything \\"the authorities deem to be terrorism, secession, subversion, or foreign collusion\\", many teachers were told by their school administrators to maintain a neutral presence on social media and in real life. In addition, they were reminded that their students' families may have ties with China or may be Hong Kong government officials who decry the year-long pro-democracy protests. One teacher said that she had considered canceling a unit on peaceful protests, in which Rosa Parks from the United States' civil rights movements in the 1960s, would have been used as an example. Another teacher reported to have sought advice on how to present the 1989 Tienanmen Square Massacre factually without stepping over the new red line. 48% of protest-related arrestees are under 18 years of age.  National security law effect: academic and speech freedom threatened in a new school year  Many incidents, large and small, have occurred since the enactment of the Hong Kong national security law that affect the education sector from K-12 to higher education. For example, days after the enactment of the law, \\"sensitive\\" books were removed from libraries and students were banned from expressing their political views or participate in political protests. Later in July, tenured Hong Kong University associate law professor Benny Tai was fired by the university's governing council and against the recommendation of the university's senate, for his involvement in the 2014 Umbrella movement and his anti-China stance. At the same time, social worker, lawmaker, and pro-democracy activist Shiu Ka-chun was told that he will no longer be teaching at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) due to him being too \\"high profile\\". Many university campus newspaper journalists are confused if \\"covering a story\\" could be seen as \\"promoting\\" and therefore drawing national security concerns, leading to censoring their own work due to fear. At the secondary level, concerned groups of teachers and educators urged Education Secretary Kevin Yeung in an open letter recently to not censor textbook contents and \\"hinder students from independent thinking and stifle free thought\\" after several textbook publishers \\"revised content in eight sets of Liberal Studies textbooks following a voluntary screening conducted by the Education Bureau\\". To start off the school year, on September 1, a 16-year-old boy from Heung To High School was suspended for a week for his ‚ÄúLiberate Hong Kong‚Äù avatar icon, a phrase deemed ‚Äúseditious‚Äù by the Hong Kong Education Bureau under the new national security law. The student complied with the school's request and removed such photo from his profile picture within minutes. Nonetheless the school demanded that the student withdraw for damaging the school's reputation. If the student chose to stay he would have two ‚Äúdemerits‚Äù listed on his permanent record. After the one-week suspension the student told reporters that Heung To administration threatened expulsion if he were found participating in any anti-government political events in any shape and form. A Heung To teacher told reporters that the consequence was really lenient and that the student could find another school if he were unhappy with the school or the punishment. Finally, citing national security law, Heung To reported this incident to the Education Bureau for further investigation and evaluation. In a response to the Stand News, Education Bureau stated that school campuses are not the place for political activism and all schools can do a better job ameliorating the anti-government mindset common in youth. = 3 September =  Hong Kong-born Japanese journalist arrested by Hong Kong Police  Awaiting confirmation from the Japanese embassy, Japanese newspaper The Sankei News reported that one of its staff, a male photographer, could be one of the 15 arrested by police on 31 August in the Prince Edward station attack one-year commemoration protest. The journalist reportedly had been seen at numerous protests over the past year, and was once arrested at the Siege of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Police later stated that the journalist, a Hong Kong born Japanese citizen, had been working as a freelance reporter at the time when he was again arrested. They further stated that he had not told the police at the scene about him being a reporter and that police had not been able find evidence in his belongings to prove him to be one. He was arrested for illegal possession of an airsoft gun, and released on bail by 3 September pending further investigation. = 4 September =  International response: United Nations  A 14-page report made by the United Nations dated September 1 and made available today decried Beijing's newly enacted Hong Kong national security law as being in breach of international legal obligations. The report listed out the committee's deep concerns over the ambiguous language in the national security law and the violations of Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The committee report concluded with six actionable requests to China and Hong Kong governments, such as: explain how the legislation is compatible with the government‚Äôs \\"obligations under articles 2, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22 of the ICCPR and articles 11, 12, 19 and 20 of the UDHR and how it may remediate the aforementioned inconsistencies with international human rights standards enshrined in the Act\\" and \\"provide information on how your Government intends to enforce the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the legislation as enshrined in articles 36, 37, 38, and 55 to ensure compatibility with the ICCPR.\\"https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=25487 = 5 September =  Apple's statement on Hong Kong iCloud user data storage  Days after Beijing passed the Hong Kong national security law, international tech giants such as Google, Twitter, Microsoft and Facebook have already declared that they would not comply with Hong Kong or China authorities' requests for user data. However, with its China data center being state-run, tech company Apple has not made any statements to the public until today. \\"iCloud data for Hong Kong users is stored on US servers,\\" Apple stated, and therefore \\"any request from Hong Kong authorities to hand over the data must first be approved by the U.S. Justice Department and a warrant must be issued by a U.S. federal judge before handing it over.\\" Apple also further released some statistics relating to user data request: \\"Hong Kong authorities made 604 requests for device information, 310 requests for financial data, and 10 requests for user account data during 2019.\\" Data from July 2020, since the enactment of the national security law, will be released in the next transparency report. = 6 September =  The 12 detainees are denied lawyers; may be sentenced to prison for life  also see \\"12 Hong Kong Residents Captured by China\\" It has been over 15 days since the arrest of the 12 Hong Kong pro-democracy activists, aged 16-30, and little is yet released by authorities. Hong Kong Police claimed to know little about the legal process or timeline. Carrie Lam said on September 1 that Hong Kong government would do its part to protect Hong Kong citizens, but if illegal activities occur in other judiciary region then of course Hong Kong cannot intervene. A Sha Tin district representative has initiated a White House petition pleading that Hong Kong government make sure these 12 detainees be released and returned ton Hong Kong, citing precarious human rights practices by the Chinese authorities and the scarcity of information. Netizens started a hashtag \\"#save12hkyouths\\" hoping to spread awareness of the black-box operation of Chinese government under the national security law in Hong Kong. It is now known that one of the arrestees was Andy Li (ÊùéÂÆáËªí), a member of the Hong Kong localist group \\"Hong Kong Story\\" who was also arrested on August 10, the day Jimmy Lai and Agnes Chow were arrested by Hong Kong Police citing the national security law. As of 6 September these 12 individuals were detained in Shenzhen's Yantian District Detention Center. Multiple Chinese lawyers representing the detainees' families have requested to meet with the detainees but were all declined by Chinese authorities on the ground of \\"relationship (with detainees) cannot be verified\\". One lawyer then visited the Yantian police station hoping to learn more. According to one police official it is highly probable that these individuals could be charged with \\"smuggling ring head\\" instead of the originally presumed \\"unlawful border crossing (into Chinese territories)\\", a lesser crime. If convicted with smuggling-related charges these detainees could be sentenced to 2 years to life in prison.  Arrest of Tam Tak-chi  In the morning, political figure and radio personality Tam Tak-chi was arrested at his Tai Po home by national security officers for \\"uttering seditious words\\" at street booths earlier in the year. According to senior police superintendent Li Kwai-wah, Tam's speeches \\"brought into hatred and contempt of the government and raised discontent and disaffection among Hong Kong people\\".  Protests on original date of postponed LegCo election  There were protests in Kowloon on the day that the Legislative Council election was originally scheduled to be held. Nearly 300 were arrested for alleged illegal assembly, with one woman arrested under the national security law for allegedly chanting \\"pro-independence slogans\\". Some protesters hurled objects at the police, while police officers fired pepper balls. Police officers also reportedly pepper-sprayed citizens who scolded the police. Three members of the League of Social Democrats ‚Äì Leung Kwok-hung, Raphael Wong and Figo Chan ‚Äì were among those arrested. A video of Hong Kong Police officers tackling a 12-year-old girl went viral online. The girl's mother said that the family lives in the area and they were shopping for art supplies. When the police approached the girl, she became fearful and tried to dash away, but was knocked down and tackled by officers. The girl, her brother, and a passerby were subsequently ticketed for allegedly violating the Covid-19 ban on group gatherings of more than two people. The injured siblings were sent to Kwong Wah Hospital for treatment. Hong Kong Police stated that their officers used the minimum force necessary to subdue the girl. A New World First Bus (NWFB) bus captain was arrested after honking at and driving near police officers who were gathered on the carriageway of Nathan Road. Police alleged that his \\"driving attitude was very dangerous\\" and his honking was \\"unreasonable\\". In response, members of the New World First Bus Staff Union staged a work-to-rule protest on Monday in support of their colleague, and urged NWFB to examine the bus's \\"black box\\" records. = 7 September =  Hong Kong's separation of powers questioned  Article 85 of Hong Kong Basic Law states that Hong Kong courts \\"shall exercise judicial power independently, free from any interference.\\" The statement that Hong Kong has never had separation of powers, neither before, nor since the handover, came from Secretary of Education Kevin Yeung on August 31, as he denied allegations of and justified the latest liberal studies textbook revisions that removed references to \\"Hong Kong having a division of powers between the executive, legislature and judiciary\\". The following day Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam reinforced Yeung's statement in a press conference, reiterating that while there should be checks and balances, \\"the three institutions are accountable to Beijing through an executive-led system of governance\\". However, the Hong Kong Bar Association's statement the next day refuted Lam and Yeung's statements while pointing out several violations of Hong Kong Basic Law if Hong Kong were to operate without separation and independence of the three powers.https://www.hkba.org/sites/default/files/20200902%20-%20HKBA%20statement%20on%20separation%20of%20powers%20%28E%29.pdf In fact, according to numerous news outlets and archived government publications, before and after the handover, the idea of separation of powers, or trias politica, has been ingrained in Hong Kong. For example, in 1984 legislator Maria Tam publicly praised Hong Kong's prosperity as the direct result of separation of powers when drafting the Sino-Briitsh Joint Declaration. A government pamphlet in Chinese celebrating the Handover in June 1997 clearly stated the benefits of separation of powers, in addition to numerous liberal studies textbook editions. Today, Hong Kong Macao Affairs Office issued a statement denouncing part of the public for defending the \\"never existed\\" separation of powers, for undermining the China-appointed Chief Executive's powers, and for rejecting \\"Beijing's comprehensive jurisdiction over the [HK]SAR, and turn[ing] Hong Kong into an independent political entity.\\" = 9 September =  National security law effect: Japanese financial firm to leave Hong Kong  Japanese online financial firm Strategic Business Innovator, SBI Holdings, is considering moving its Hong Kong office to the Kobe and Osaka region once the 2020 business year is over in March 2021. The firm predicted that Hong Kong's status as an international hub will continue to decline in the coming months citing the Beijing-enacted national security law in Hong Kong. The company is seeking support from the Japan government's to not only relocate their office back to Japan, but to further develop Kansai region into a Hong-Kong-like international financial center that can readily absorb financial companies fleeing Hong Kong.  Over 10,000 arrests since the start of the protests: Hong Kong Police Force  The newest arrest number released by the Hong Kong Police Force showed that of the 10,016 arrested in relation to the protests since 9 June 2019, a total of 2,210, or about 22%, were indicted on charges of \\"rioting, illegal assembly or possessing weapons\\". Additionally, police stated that of the 550 offenders who have gone through trials within this past 15 months, 462 individuals have been subject to some kind of legal consequences. = 10 September =  International response: London, United Kingdom  London politician and Mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey made a motion in the London Assembly to suspend their 2006 \\"twinning\\" agreement with Beijing in response to the human rights abuse by China that undermines Hong Kong democracy and Uighurs' freedom. \\"The Assembly calls on the UK Government to propose a strategy to engage with China over human rights abuse, including if necessary, sanctions legislation targeted at individuals responsible. \\"https://www.london.gov.uk/about- us/londonassembly/meetings/documents/s84520/06%20Motions.pdf In addition, Bailey shared an open letter with Hong Kong Free Press that detailed his plan to support Hong Kongers should they decide to emigrate to London.  15 arrested for alleged Next Media stock \\"conspiracy to defraud and money laundering\\"  Police arrested 15 individuals accusing them of stock manipulation from 10‚Äì12 August. During that period, Next Digital stock surged by almost 300%, which was seen as support of Jimmy Lai as he was being arrested at Next Media headquarters and detained for over 30 hours by the police. The Securities and Futures Commission, the SFC, had issued a statement on August 11 warning the public \\"to exercise extreme caution when dealing in the shares of Next Digital Limited\\". According to Mainichi, the 14 men and a woman are aged between 22 and 53, and were said to have conducted \\"some 13,200 trading transactions involving 1.69 billion shares of Next Digital\\" in those three days and have made about \\"HK$38.7 million (US$5 million), including one who made more than HK$25 million.\\" However, not every investor profited; police cited one elderly man who had lost over $1 million HKD. Following the police's arrest of these 15 individuals, SFC further released a statement on September 11 clarifying that the agency will fully cooperate with the police investigation on money laundering of the arrested individuals. = 11 September =  Protest-related award: Freedom House Award  Freedom House, a US-based non profit research and civil rights organization, announced that it awarded their annual Freedom House Award to the \\"leaderless, people- led\\" Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Movement. The award citation praised Hong Kong protesters' commitment to \\"defending their rights for future generations in new and creative ways\\" as \\"Beijing‚Äôs sudden imposition of a repressive new national security law has made these efforts tremendously dangerous.\\" On September 16, Nathan Law, a former Hong Kong lawmaker and prominent pro- democracy activist now wanted by Hong Kong authorities after self-exiling to London at the time the security law went into effect, will be speaking at the award ceremony.  National security law effect: Fraser Institute report  Using 2018 data, Canada-based public policy think tank Fraser Institute ranked Hong Kong as number one in \\"economic freedom\\" of the world, followed by Singapore. However, the report acknowledged that the \\"apparent increased insecurity of property rights and the weakening of the rule of law caused by the interventions of the Chinese government during 2019 and 2020 will likely have a negative impact on Hong Kong‚Äôs score, especially in Area 2, Legal System and Property Rights, going forward.\\" Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam welcomed the 2018 ranking but denounced its \\"biased comments and unfair speculations based on selective ungrounded views\\".  US Secretary of State Pompeo questioned Lam's commitment to \\"protecting the rights of Hong Kong residents\\"  also see \\"12 Hong Kong Residents Captured by China\\" It's been 19 days since the arrest of the 12 individuals by China coastguards. More Chinese and Hong Kong lawyers were denied access to the detainees, and some of these lawyers were even threatened by Chinese national security authorities to drop the case and not to get involved. As the Hong Kong government remained silent, the US State department issued a press release stating US's deep concern over the lack of due process for these 12 individuals and urged Chief Executive Carrie Lam to safeguard Hong Kong citizen's human rights. = 12 September =  Press conference held by 12 detainees' families  also see \\"12 Hong Kong Residents Captured by China\\" After 20 days of secretive detention with zero news, the 12 families held a joint press conference stating their commitment to free their detained family members and sharing their legal obstacles when pleading with the Chinese authorities. As they seek international support to pressure China to follow international human rights protocols, they also ask the Hong Kong government to help negotiate their demands with the Chinese government. The four demands include allowing prescribed medications to be delivered and safely administered to the detainees, allowing phone calls with families, declining \\"state-mandated lawyers\\" assigned by Chinese government, and releasing these individuals to Hong Kong for a fair trial. = 13 September =  Losing confidence in Hong Kong: increased MPF permanent withdrawal  The Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) annual report showed a 32% year over year increase of Hong Kong working class withdrawing their money citing \\"permanent departure from Hong Kong\\", a move that strongly implicated possible emigration to another country, and a sign of citizens losing confidence in the Hong Kong government. The report year recorded MPF investment activities from June 2019 to June 2020, and thus included the mass anti-extradition protests. Over six billion HKD was withdrawn, comparing to 4.6 billion HKD withdrawn on the same ground in fiscal year 2018‚Äì19.https://www.mpfa.org.hk/eng/information_centre/publications/annual_reports/files_20182019/MPFA_AR_Full_set_e.pdf  Yantian confirmed 12 detainees' detention; Chinese diplomat called 12 detainees \\"separatists\\"  also see \\"12 Hong Kong Residents Captured by China\\" After the detainees' family press conference yesterday pleading Hong Kong government's intervention and possible extradition, Shenzhen's Yantian detention center officially confirmed, for the first time, that the 12 detainees are indeed located at Yantian. Meanwhile, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying publicly stated on Twitter that these 12 detainees are criminals trying to \\"separate Hong Kong from China\\", a more serious allegation than the \\"illegal boarder crossing\\", and an allegation punishable under the new national security law. Hong Kong government reaffirmed its stance to not interfere with China's jurisdiction, claiming that the relevant crime \\"falls within the jurisdiction of the mainland and the special administrative region government respects and will not interfere with law enforcement actions.\\" Meanwhile, more lawyer visits have been denied by authorities, and numbers of lawyers have quit taking on the case under political pressure from Chinese government. = 15 September =  National security law effect: US increased travel advisory to Hong Kong  The United States has increased its Hong Kong travel advisory to Level 3, \\"reconsider travel\\", citing how the Chinese government \\"arbitrarily enforces local laws, including by carrying out arbitrary and wrongful detentions and through the use of exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries without due process of law\\" since the imposition of the Hong Kong national security law on July 1st. In response to the heightened travel alert, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said to reporters that \\"China has always protected the safety and legal rights of foreigners in China in accordance with law. China is one of the safest countries in the world,\\" but foreigners in China also \\"have an obligation to abide by Chinese laws.\\"  National security law effect: another pro-democracy activist fled Hong Kong citing safety concerns  Sunny Cheung, another prominent pro-democracy activist in Hong Kong, has confirmed his departure from the city after he failed to show up to court for his June 4 Tienanmen Massacre commemoration vigil arrest. Cheung, age 24, won the second highest number of votes in the 2020 pro-democracy primaries for Kowloon West. Since the passing of the national security law many pro- democracy activists such as Agnes Chow and Joshua Wong have reportedly been stalked or subjected to surveillance by unknown individuals. Cheung has told reporters in August that he and his family have been harassed and monitored. = 16 September =  International response: USA and United Kingdom  US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo met with UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in Washington D.C. to discuss trade, Brexit, and China. Pompeo praised the UK for its new immigration policy that can help with Hong Kong activists fleeing China's tightening grip. Meanwhile, Raab reiterated the \\"U.K.-U.S. collaboration on shared global priorities‚Äù such as \\"standing up for the people of Hong Kong and holding China to its international obligations\\".  International response: European Union  In her State of the Union address to the European Union nations, president of the European Commission Ursula Gertrud von der Leyen stressed the importance of calling out China's human right abuses in Hong Kong and to the Uyghurs. She also announced that House will have a proposal soon to enact a European Magnitsky Act against human right abusers in Hong Kong and in Belarus after numerous calls. Prior to von der Leyen's address, nine European parliamentarians published an op-ed in French and German newspapers calling for a stronger European stance against China's violation of Hong Kong's autonomy. They termed Chinese authorities' responses to last year‚Äôs protests in Hong Kong as ‚Äúcoercion, control, and subjugation.‚Äù Two days prior, president of European Council Charles Michel released an official statement after the EU-China virtual meeting, raising \\"grave concerns\\" for the national security law for Hong Kong, calling on China to \\"keep their promises to the people of Hong Kong and the international community\\", and reiterating that \\"democratic voices in Hong Kong should be heard, rights protected, and autonomy preserved\\". = 17 September =  Protest-related award: the Havel Prize  The V√°clav Havel International Prize for Creative Dissent celebrates activists who \\"exhibit bravery, creativity, and artistic innovation in standing up against dictatorships.\\" One of three award recipient this year was known Australia-based exiled Chinese political cartoonist Badiucao, who continues to support Hong Kong's pro- democracy movement with countless pieces of protest artwork. According to the award description, Badiucao's creation \\"Lennon Flag\\" served as a \\"powerful protest symbol that inspired and mobilized the global community to stand in solidarity with Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy movement.\\" While the award winners were announced on September 17, the virtual award ceremony will take place on September 25 during the 2020 Oslo Freedom Forum. The forum features Nathan Law, an exiled Hong Kong pro-democracy politician and activist wanted by Hong Kong authorities. = 18 September =  International response: United Kingdom  In a speech to a parliamentary committee, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that people in Hong Kong and around the world began to see \\"the chilling of free speech, [people are] starting to see...the effect of that security rule, the Chinese legislation, already starting to bite on the people of Hong Kong\\". It is speculated that Johnson was referring to the recent Tam Tak-chi arrest over speech crime. Tam is denied bail and is charged of \\"uttering seditious words\\".  National security law effect: Australian judge resigned from Hong Kong court citing national security legislation  The September 18 Hong Kong government gazette announced that effective September 2, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam had \\"revoked the appointment\\" of Judge James Spigelman with no explanation or reason given.https://www.gld.gov.hk/egazette/pdf/20202438/egn202024385185.pdf However, newspapers today disputed the revocation. On an interview Judge Spigelman stated that he resigned from serving on the Court of Final Appeal citing \\"national security legislation\\" as a main reason. The resignation took place one day after Lam publicly acknowledged on September 1 that there has never been separations of power in Hong Kong. Spigelman's appointment would last for two more years if he had not resigned from the position. Chief Executive office later denied claims that Spigelman resigned over national security law. = 19 September =  Hong Kong officials on the 12 detainees; families responded  also see \\"12 Hong Kong Residents Captured by China\\" It has been 28 days since the capture of 12 Hong Kong pro-democracy activists by the Chinese coastguards and little is yet known. Secretary of Security John Lee acknowledged in a TVB interview that Hong Kong authorities were only being informed of the capture five days after, and as of right now all 12 detainees are in good health even though no one from the Hong Kong side has met with these 12 in person. He continued to claim that these detainees have already chosen their lawyers provided by China. Separately on a radio interview, Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung, said that \\"Hong Kong‚Äôs Immigration Department, and the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Guangdong had communicated with the families 80 times since the arrests\\" but claimed their hands are tied However, families of the detainees refuted the government's apparent effort, accusing the government as never having contacted the family members in the past 28 days, and \\"only shirked responsibility and confused the public with mere excuses‚Äù. Two families' members revealed to news reporters in a press conference the following day that they had separately gone to the police stations to report their missing sons, on August 26 and on August 28. While the missing person reports were not accepted by police, one policeman showed a record of the missing person's cellphone record to the family member, raising questions on how the records were obtained two days after the capture but three days before the news broke. The other family member was told that the son was now detained in Yantian, days before the detention location was reported by media. Family members asked the Hong Kong government to provide clear and accurate evidence of the maritime location, to provide a recent photo of each detainee, and to let the captured know the families have appointed lawyers for them.  Solidarity Protest: Vancouver, Canada  The theme of this protest in Vancouver was \\"Calling For the End of the Tyrannical Communist Party of China‚Äù and was attended by dozens of Hong Kong pro-democracy supporters and Taiwanese against the looming Chinese military threat. = 20 September =  ‚ÄúLunch with you‚Äù and ‚ÄúDine with you‚Äù localized protests continue  These protest events usually take place around lunch and dinner time and inside local malls. Although since the enactment of national security law along with the pandemic the number of participants and frequency have dramatically declined, these protests, nonetheless, continue to take place despite heavier police presence. For example, a ‚ÄúLunch With You‚Äù was organized on August 21 at 1pm in Yuen Long YOHO Mall and in Yuen Long MTR station to commemorate the 13th month remembrance of the 2019 Yuen Long attack. The YOHO protesters began chanting slogans while the other group began marching into Yuen Long‚Äôs Nam Pin Wai (ÂçóÈÇäÂúç), the reported gathering spot of white-shirt attackers in the 2019 Yuen Long attack. Both locations were met with heavy police presence. 18-year-old David Li, the lone protest participant along with journalists marching into Nam Pin Wai, were denied entry. This was the second time police denied David's entry into Nam Pin Wai; the first time was on July 21, 2020 on the one year anniversary of the attack. David continued to argue with police on what grounds they could deny entry of Hong Kong people into a public space for ‚Äúa leisurely walk‚Äù. Later, a web journalist was ticketed at Nam Pin Wai while 11 individuals, aged 17 to 44, were ticketed at YOHO for violation of social gathering ordinance. Earlier last week in Kwun Tong during lunch time, a ‚ÄúLunch With You‚Äù protest took place inside APM mall. Only a few individuals, led by the same 18-year-old \\"Brother Lunch David\\", chanted slogans and waved cellphone flashlights. And tonight at Maritime Square in Tsing Yi, substantially more participants were seen gathering for the ‚ÄúDine With You‚Äù event. Dozens of protesters came out and chanted protest slogan ‚Äúfive demands not one less‚Äù. They showed solidarity with paper cut out of \\"Fast Beat\\" Tam Tak-chi, a legislative council member arrested earlier for alleged speech crime and was denied bail. Participants waved their cellphone flashlights in support of Tam and the protest. Hundreds of police arrived soon after. No arrest was made. = 21 September = This vertical protest banner was a response to Hong Kong government's decision to postpone the much anticipated Legislative Council election for a year. The original election was dated September 6, 2020. This 20-meter vertical protest banner, printed on black fabric with white fonts, was found flying over Devil's Peak on Kowloon. The six Chinese characters on the banner demanded the government to \\"Initiate Legislative Council Election Now\\" („ÄåÁ´ãÂç≥ÂïüÂãïÈÅ∏Ëàâ„Äç). = 22 September =  National security law effect: man arrested for slogan chanting  The 30-year-old protester was chanting \\"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our time\\" in Tseung Kwan O PopCorn shopping center as Hong Kong citizens gathered to commemorate the one year passing of Christy Chan Yin-lam. His arrest became the 27th arrest in Hong Kong under the national security law since its enactment on July 1st. It is speculated that this protester, surname Ma, dressed as \\"Captain America\\" in numerous protest rallies and is also the administrator of a popular anti-government telegram channel. = 23 September =  Press freedom in Hong Kong continues to be under pressure  Press freedom has been seen as being under attack by Hong Kong Police since the beginning of the protests, exacerbated by the pandemic and the establishment of the national security law. There have been numerous incidents of police targeting reporters in mass protests by ticketing, stop-and-searching, tear- gassing, water-cannoning, detaining, arresting, and even charging. The conflict reached a new level on August 10 after the arrest of Jimmy Lai, where only 15 \\"trusted\\" media were allowed into the cordon area. On September 22 Hong Kong Police Force changed its media relation definition in the Police Ordinance Chapter 39 without notifying the public, and only invited selected media outlet for a briefing the day after. The new \\"media representatives\\" definition only recognizes \\"media agencies registered under the Government News and Media Information System (GNMIS)\\" or those \\"internationally recognized and reputable non-local news agencies, newspapers, magazines, radio and television broadcasters\\".https://www.police.gov.hk/info/doc/pgo/en/Epgo039.pdf As a result, freelance journalists, internet media, and student reporters are not deemed as credentialed reporters, and the press passes issued by Hong Kong Journalist Association (HKJA) or Hong Kong Press Photographers Association are no longer valid under the new ordinance, effective immediately. Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents' Club (FCC), Hong Kong Journalist Association (HKJA), seven joint-university educator group , internet media, and several lawyers and lawmakers all issued statements blasting the re-definition. China's Commissioner's Office of Foreign Ministry published a statement of \\"strong disapproval\\" of foreign journalists meddling with Hong Kong affairs in the name of press freedom, and Hong Kong Police Force defended its new practice as \\"fair, objective, and transparent\\". According to the World Press Freedom Index, Hong Kong's press freedom index has declined steadily since its beginning record in 2013, from rank 58 in 2013 to rank 80 in 2020.  International response to pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong's new arrest  Joshua Wong was arrested by the police at the station for wearing a mask and unlawful assembly in an October 2019 protest. While Wong was released after being questioned for about three hours, these new charges became his third arrest by the authorities. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to \\"respect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, as protected in the Joint Declaration\\". European Union spokesperson issued a statement questioning China's \\"will to uphold its international commitments\\" as this arrest becomes the \\"latest in a troubling series of arrests of pro-democracy activists since the summer\\" when the national security law was enacted by the Chinese government. Human Rights Watch also issued a statement calling on Hong Kong authorities to stop prosecuting pro-democracy activists.  International response: Denmark  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark penned an open letter to United Nations Human Rights Council expressing concerns over human rights abuses in other parts of the world and in Hong Kong, \\"especially with regard to the extensive erosion of rights and freedoms following the newly adoption and entry into force of the National Security Law\\". = 24 September =  National security law effect: Danish pension fund divests China investment citing Hong Kong human rights violation  Akademiker Pension, Denmark's first pension company formerly known as MP Pension, will divest around 400 million Danish Krone, about 62 million US Dollars, from Chinese government bonds and shares. Citing Hong Kong's national security law and Uighurs' detention camps as human rights violations, Akademiker Pension stated that they have long \\"had China under observation\\" and that the company can no longer turn a blind eye to China's systematical violations of human rights.  Swedish technology firm cut ties with Hong Kong Government, citing US Hong Kong sanction  An email by Stockholm-based Micro Systemation AB (MSAB) to Bloomberg confirmed that the MSAB will no longer provide cellphone data extraction services to the Hong Kong Police's Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau (CSTCB) or other Hong Kong government agencies under the United States' July 14 sanction. In July, pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong raised international attention when urging technology companies to stop selling phone hacking technology to Hong Kong and China. A court document provided by the police during one of Wong's trials showed that Hong Kong police used software bought from Israel-based company Cellebrite to hack not only Wong's phone but over 4,000 Hong Kong activists' phone data. In August, Cellebrite responded that the company does not have business ties with governments sanctioned by the US.  Sentencing of three protesters in relation to New Town Plaza protest, 14 July 2019  Three people were sentenced to prison by a District Court judge for the offence of rioting. Two adult defendants were handed four-year jail terms, while a minor was sentenced to three years and four months' imprisonment. The three took part in clashes with police at New Town Plaza, Sha Tin, during protests there on 14 July 2020.  Protest-related award: Siena Drone Awards  Architect and photographer Tugo Cheung's aerial photo titled \\"2,000,001\\" was taken on June 16, 2019 when more than two million Hong Kong citizens took to the streets to protest the anti-extradition bill that has since been withdrawn by the government. The drone photo was selected as the runner-up in the \\"People\\" category. = 25 September =  A new form of peaceful protest: Read With You  Following the leaderless protest events \\"Lunch With you\\", \\"Sing With You\\", and \\"Dine With You\\" throughout Hong Kong since June 2019, a new form of peaceful protest emerged: \\"Read With You\\". In support of the only pro- democracy print newspaper Apple Daily in Hong Kong, citizens not only helped rally its stock in the stock market, especially since the arrest of founder Jimmy Lai on August 10, but also have been physically purchasing extra copies of the printed newspaper in stores and newspaper stands. Many individuals, businesses and advocacy groups have also been showing their support by placing advertisements with Apple Daily. Recently, more and more people holding a copy of the day's Apple Daily are gathering at lunch time as a form of silent protest.  International response: European Union  European Union president Charles Michel gave a speech to the United Nations General Assembly stating the Union's commitment to protecting \\"peaceful cooperation, human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\" Michel further reiterated that the European Union nations \\"do not share the values on which the political and economic system in China is based\\" and will continue to promote \\"respect for universal human rights, including those of minorities such as the Uighurs. Or in Hong Kong, where international commitments guaranteeing the rule of law and democracy are being questioned.\\"  International response: United Nations Human Rights Council  Several countries called out China for its human rights violations in Hong Kong and to the Xinjiang Uighurs during the 45th session of the UN human Rights Council meeting. Britain specifically called on China to \\"uphold the rights and freedoms in the Joint Declaration\\" and to respect \\"the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary\\" while other countries demanded full access to Xinjiang's Uighurs re-education camps for full investigation. China representative rejected the \\"baseless allegation\\" but did not dispute them. Two days prior, a UK-led virtual discussion on Hong Kong was held with support from Canada and Australia to help provide more context to the attending members \\"on how the Hong Kong National Security Law is a breach of China‚Äôs international obligations\\". = 26 September =  Protests continue: hill-top vertical protest banners  Vertical protest banners have been repeatedly displayed by Hong Kong citizens to voice their dissatisfaction with the government even before the anti-extradition protests last year. In the 2014 Umbrella Movement for the first time vertical protest banner was found on top of Lion Rock and since then, many more hill-top vertical protest banners appeared. Some well-known recent hillside banners include \\"Corrupted Cops are the Rioters\\" hung on September 21, 2019 at Devil's Peak of Yau Tong, \\"Disband the Police\\" hung on Beacon Hill in Kowloon on September 23, 2019, \\"One Country One System. Hong Kong Game Over\\" on June 15, 2020, and \\"Initiate Legislative Council Election Now\\" on September 21, 2020. With the police rejecting the October 1st mass rally application put forth by Civil Human Rights Front, Hong Kong citizens put out a vertical protest banner in the hills of Shau Kei Wan today. The vertical protest banner roughly translates to \\"October 1st Celebrate His Mom\\", referring to the upcoming Chinese National Day holiday on October 1st.  Developing: the 12 Hong Kong detainees--three days exceeding maximum detention period allowed by Chinese law  also see \\"12 Hong Kong Residents Captured by China\\" After more than 33 days of silence from both China and Hong Kong authorities, Hong Kong government issued a press release informing the public that the 12 detainees were now approved to be \\"arrested\\". According to China's criminal law, the maximum numbers of days of detention before charges is 30 days.https://www.cecc.gov/sites/chinacommission.house.gov/files/documents/PRC%20Criminal%20Procedure%20Law%20Chinese.pdf = 28 September =  Second solidarity protest: Vancouver, Canada  For the second consecutive weekend, about 500 protesters gathered in front of Chinese Consulate Office in Vancouver to voice their opposition of Communist China's increasing presence and influence in Canada, and intrusion of India, Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. The participating organizations were \\"Friend of Canada- India, Canada Tibet Committee and the Tibetan Community, Friends of Canada India Organization, Vancouver Society of Freedom, Democracy and Human Rights for China, Vancouver Hong Kong Political Activists, Vancouverites concerned about Hong Kong, Vancouver Society in Support of Democratic Movement (VSSDM) and Vancouver Uyghur Association.\\" = 29 September =  Police defended mass protest application rejection; suggesting \\"real name registration\\" in future rallies  A mass rally protest march application, submitted by Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF), has been denied by the police, citing pandemic health concerns and threats of violence. CHRF further lost their appeal to the decision. This is the 7th time in the past few months that the Hong Kong police has rejected a mass rally application. A CHRF spokesperson, in a press conference, accused the police of violating Hong Kong Basic Law article 27, which states that Hong Kong citizens shall have freedom \\"of assembly, of procession and of demonstration\\". The Spokesperson further stated that police suggested to him that to get approval for future rallies, participants should register with their real name to gain rights and access to a march, so if anything were to happen police could quickly track down the participants. Security Bureau also reiterated that freedom and rights are not absolute, that they are \\"subject to restrictions as prescribed by law in the interests of public order and safety, as well as the well-being of others.\\" CHRF disputed that statement, accusing the government of using health concerns as an excuse to suppress Hong Kong citizen's right of assembly, especially when trains and subways are packed with commuters every day but only a mass rally is considered a health concern. = 30 September =  International response: Germany  German Chancellor Angela Merkel in a speech vowed to question China on its human rights violation in Hong Kong in the next day during the EU summit, stating that Germany has \\"flagged up our deep concern about the development in Hong Kong. The principle of one country, two systems stands but again and again it‚Äôs being undermined.\\"  Developing: the 12 Hong Kong detainees charged by Chinese authorities  also see \\"12 Hong Kong Residents Captured by China\\" It's been 39 days since the first announcement of the maritime arrest and no one has been allowed to meet with these 12 individuals and lawyer representations have all been denied. To date at least 14 Chinese human rights lawyer were threatened by Chinese authorities to terminate their lawyer license and have since withdrawn from participating in the case. Today, nine days exceeding the 30-day maximum detention period, two of the 12 were formally charged with organizing smuggling and the remaining 10 individuals were charged \\"illegal border crossing\\".  US soon accepts \\"refugees\\" from Hong Kong seeking asylum  There's been effort since the establishment of the Hong Kong national security law to add Hong Kong to the US refugee resettlement program should the activists choose to flee to the US.https://rcusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/RCUSA-on-Hong-Kong- Recommendations.pdf Announced today in the US Department of State website and awaiting presidential signature, starting October 1, Hong Kong residents fleeing to the United States could apply for refugee status seeking asylum under the new refugee resettlement program along with other developing countries including Iraq, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Cuba, and Venezuela.

It received protection as a National Historic Site in 1926. Overview The Atagozuka Kofun is located on the west bank of the Kurokawa River, in the northeast of the town center of Mibu Town. It is part of a group of tumuli, which include the nearby Kurumazuka Kofun and Ushizuka Kofun, which have different shapes, and which have separate National Historic Site designations. The tumulus is a built in two tiers, with a total length of 77 meters for the bottom tier and 53 meters for the upper tier. It is typical of kofun in this region and period for the rectangular portion to be larger and taller than the domed portion. The tumulus was surrounded by a moat with a width of over twenty meters, portions of which survive. *Overall length: 77 meters *Rear circle: 23 meter diameter x 5.5 meter height *Front width: 35 meters x 6 meter height The tumulus has never been excavated and details of the burial chamber are unknown, but from its design and from fragments of haniwa (including one of a man in armor) and Sue ware pottery which have been recovered from the vicinity, it is estimated to date from the mid-6th century. This was a period of transition between the Kofun period when the Shimotsuke area was ruled by independent local kings and the Asuka period, when the centralized Yamato state dominated. Its size, and location near other large tumuli and the site of the Shimotsuke Kokubun-ji indicate the importance of this region in Kofun period Shimotsuke. The top of the tumulus is occupied by a Shinto shrine (the Atago Shrine) from which the kofun gets its name. This shrine was built in 1694 by Matsudaira Terusada, daimy≈ç of Mibu Domain, as it was located in the Kimon, or \\"unlucky direction\\" from Mibu Castle. The Atagoyama Kofun is about a 15 minute walk from Mibu Station on the T≈çbu Railway Utsunomiya Line.

Early life  Harry Attridge Memmott was born in Brisbane, Queensland in 1921, the son of Harry Memmott, a bootmaker and his wife Amy Sandison. He spent his childhood in Annerley. His grandfather, J.T. Sandison, who had trained at Bendigo Pottery, owned a pottery works in Annerley and in addition to the kilns, they had a rich supply of local clay. Sandison was known for his speed of throwing and large pots, with most of his work in the creation of pots for gardens. Memmott studied art at the Brisbane Technical College with a growing circle of local artists. He married Estelle ‚ÄúCootch‚Äù Powell in 1943, and after serving in World War II in the army intelligence unit, he took up the offer of retraining which was generally made available to former servicemen. He completed a Fine Art course at the East Sydney Technical College alongside John Rigby, Margaret Cilento and Margaret Olley.  Career  Memmott, his wife ‚ÄúCootch‚Äù, who would later take up pottery and twin sons returned to Brisbane in 1950 and he set up a business making silk screen prints and picture frames. Sandison pottery was being run by Memmott's uncle, George Sandison and former industrial chemist, Mervyn Feeney. Mass production of pots overseas closed most of the commercial Brisbane pottery firms in the early 1950s. Memmott learnt to throw pots on a wheel at Sandisons under the guidance of George Sandison's partner, Mervin Feeney, alongside another artist and radio announcer, Milton Moon. In the mid-1950s, Memmott took over a section of the works and produced studio pottery and a range of souvenir wares for commercial markets, featuring Aboriginal designs and other works designed for the holiday souvenir market, fired in an electric kiln. In the late 1950s, Memmott began a studio pottery school. He visited Japan in the late 1960s and moved to the Dandenong Ranges, Victoria, to take up a position at the Prahran Technical College. His wife took over the studio pottery business. In 1970 Memmott published The Australian Pottery Book - a way with clay: the comprehensive guide to pottery. He returned to Brisbane in 1977, and continued to work as a potter until 1985. He died in 1991.  Legacy  The Sandison Pottery site was sold and a housing estate known as Potter‚Äôs Place was proposed for the area to honour its legacy. Memmott‚Äôs pieces are marked with 'Harry Memmott' on their base and are sought after by collectors and galleries.

Biography He began his studies at the Escuela de Bellas Artes de C√°diz then, in 1864, received a cholarship that enabled him to study in Paris. There, he enrolled at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with Alexandre Cabanel. He would remain in Paris until 1870. During that time, he particpated in several exhibitions; notably the Exposition Universelle (1867).Biography @ the Real Academia de la Historia When he returned to Spain, he settled in Madrid, where he made a name for himself by the decorative work he performed at the Palacio de Linares, home of , the Marqu√©s de Linares. Much of this work was floral in nature and set the tone for his career. In 1881, he was awarded a gold medal at the Exposici√≥n Regional de C√°diz and presented his first entry at the National Exhibition of Fine Arts. He was awarded a Third Class medal at the Exposition Universelle (1889). His greatest success came in 1897, at the National Exhibition, when he was awarded a First Class prize for his work \\"Flowers and Fruits\\". This was the first time that top honors had been given to a bodeg√≥n, rather than one of the dramatic historical or mythological scenes the jurors had favored up to that point.Biography and works @ the Museo del Prado Several well known painters were trained in his workshop, including Fernanda Frances Arribas, , Julia Alcayde y Montoya and Adela Gin√©s y Ortiz, his favorite student, with whom he lived, after becoming financially distressed. Her death from pneumonia, in 1918, left him destitute. His works may be seen at the Museo del Prado, Museo de C√°diz, , Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes (Argentina), and several private collections, such as the in Seville.

The area extends eastward from the Three Crosses Square and covers the broad parkland and housing estates surrounding Frascati and Nullo streets, located between the Polish parliament building, the Warsaw Stock Exchange and the National Museum. The neighbourhood was named after the Italian city of Frascati. History Poniatowski's estates in 1789, by Zygmunt Vogel. The 15-metre minaret and pavilions can be seen to the centre-left The history of Frascati dates back to 1779, when a road was constructed from Wiejska Street to the private palace of prince Kazimierz Poniatowski (1721‚Äì1800), lord chamberlain of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth and brother of king Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus. The sole remainder of that residence is the so-called Little White Palace (Bia≈Çy Pa≈Çacyk) situated on Na Skarpie Street. The complex currently houses the Museum of the Earth of the Polish Academy of Sciences. The extensive gardens that once adorned the palace were designed by Szymon Bogumi≈Ç Zug and are now occupied by the 53-hectare Marshal Edward Rydz-≈ömig≈Çy Park (often simplified to Marshal Rydz Park). In the early 19th century, French restaurateur Simon Chovot founded a recreational and entertainment park on Poniatowski's estates. The subsequent owners of the property, the aristocratic Branicki family, built a larger Renaissance Revival-styled chateau, which became known as the Red Palace (Czerwony Pa≈Çac) due to its clinker brick exterior. Designed by Leandro Marconi, the palace housed the French Embassy to Poland until 1939 and was eventually destroyed during World War II. Princely Park (Na KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôcem), established in 1779 Another garden, situated north of today's KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôca Street (Princely Street), was established for Poniatowski between 1776 and 1779. The hilly garden contained many novelty and oriental structures, including a 15-metre minaret, a Chinese pavilion and a Middle Eastern outbuilding, which was dubbed by locals as the \\"Imam House\\" (Domek Imama). None of these remain standing today with the exception of \\"Elizeum\\", an underground brick-laid rotunda and a series of corridors and tunnels which once served as a maison de plaisance retreat for the wealthy. A neo-historic waterwell pavilion was erected after the Second World War, when the gardens were transformed into a public park. One of the historical villas at Frascati The Frascati neighbourhood was inhabited by many notables and dignitaries, among them nobles, financiers, business tycoons, generals and statesmen like the much- detested Nikolay Novosiltsev, the council commissar in the Congress Kingdom of Poland. With the private gardens parceled in 1929, several modern villas were erected north of the Polish parliament, around today's Nullo, Frascati, Konopnicka and Senacka streets. These were once owned or occupied by Warsaw's wealthiest and most important residents. The majority of buildings and infrastructure survived the Second World War intact, particularity the ornate tenement houses at Wiejska Street. It remained an exclusive suburb under the Polish People's Republic, frequently visited by heads of state and communist officials. The large headquarters building of the Polish United Worker's Party (PZPR) was completed in 1952 on Frascati's northern edge. At present, Qatar and Kuweit have their embassies and consulates in Solec. A colony of embassies also exists to the south, just outside of the neighbourhood's borders and around the Ujazd√≥w Park.

Early History The Tiger Hill, a 1,481-ton ship, was built in 1887 by Archibald McMillan & Son Ltd., Dumbarton, Scotland. The cargo vessel was originally built for the Panhellenic Steamship Co. (Navigation a Vapeur Panh√©llenique) of Piraeus, Greece and sailed as the SS Thrace in the period 1887-1910. It then went through various names and owners until it was renamed as the SS Tiger Hill and was owned by the General Steamship Company of Panama and sailed under a Panamanian flag. However the crew was Greek. Last Voyage The ship sailed from Constan≈£a, Romania on August 3, 1939 laden with between 750-800 Jewish refugees with a destination of the Palestine Mandate. The refugees were overwhelmingly of Czech, Austrian and German origin (being the three territories the Nazis then controlled) plus some from the Free City of Danzig. Hundreds of bulk beds had been assembled within the holds of the cargo ship. Passengers were allowed a maximum of 25 kgs of luggage. The voyage was a very long one. Towards the end of the voyage the Tiger Hill rendezvoused with another Panamanian vessel, the S.S. Frossoula off the coast of Lebanon, on August 29, 1939, and several hundred more Jewish refugees were transshipped to the \\"Tiger Hill\\". Many of the refugees were malnourished and dysentery broke out amongst the passengers. The Frossoula (another Panamanian-flagged Greek ship) had set sail even earlier (from Sulina in Romania on 29th May 1939) {{cite webtitle=Frossoulaurl=http://paulsilverstone.com/ship/frossoulaaccess- date=2 September 2020} with its voyage having been organised by a few Slovakian Jews from Bratislava (working as the Black Rose organisation) with the agreement of the Nazi government. The ship did not have approval to land therefore the passengers were technically illegal immigrants in the eyes of the British, that then controlled the Mandate. On the 1st of September 1939 (the day that World War II began) was intercepted and fired on by Royal Navy gunboats off Tel Aviv. Two passengers were killed when the vessel was strafed by British planes. The vessel was ran aground on Frishman Beach at Haifa. It is estimated that there were between 1,150 and 1,400 refugees aboard. Crowds gathered on the beach and cheered as the refugees descended from the stranded ship. Fate The wreck was broken up in situ in 1940.

In 2001, he was convicted and sentenced to death, but the following year, as a result from numerous miscarriages of justice, the Governor of Illinois George Ryan imposed a moratorium on capital punishment, commuting all prisoners' sentences to life imprisonment. Biography Lorenzo Fayne was born on April 2, 1971 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in a family of several other brothers and sisters. Fayne spent his childhood and adolescence in the northwestern part of the city, a region plagued by poverty and crime. He grew up in an unstable family, as both of his parents had scrapes with the law, suffered from alcohol and drug dependancies, and frequently subjected Lorenzo to beatings, from which he suffered psychological trauma. In 1978, at the age of only 7, he was sexually assaulted by a neighbor boy. In his teen years, he spent a lot of time on the streets, often skipping school and failing academically, eventually dropping out of school altogether. Between 1984 and 1989, he was arrested several times for robbery, burglary, assault and auto theft, spending several years in juvenile prisons, where he was also physically and sexually assaulted by fellow inmates. During his incarceration, an IQ test determined his IQ to be between 68 and 75 points, qualifying him as borderline intellectually disabled. In 1989, after he was released from prison, Lorenzo left Milwaukee and moved in with his grandmother, Nelly Willis, in East St. Louis, Illinois, where he lived for the next four years. Exposure Fayne first came under suspicion as a suspect in the July 23, 1993, murder of 17-year-old Faith Davis, who lived next door from his grandmother's house. Davis had been attacked in her apartment, during which she was raped and stabbed to death. In order to erase the evidence, the killer set fire to the apartment, but was spotted by witnesses, who identified him as Lorenzo Fayne. Police soon arrived to interrogate him, and while examining his clothes and home, blood stains were located. Fayne was taken to the police station, where he would eventually confess to robbing Davis' apartment, but refused to admit any involvement in her murder. On August 4th, while examining fingerprints found at the crime scene, it was determined that it matched the ones found on the body of 6-year-old Aree Hunt, a young boy who had been raped and strangled on July 14, 1989, not far from Fayne's grandmother's house. After he was confronted with these findings, Lorenzo confessed to murdering both Hunt and Davis. According to his testimony, the motive for killing Aree was an inferiority complex, which drove him commit these vicious crimes so he could feel better about himself. After his family learned about his confessions, his grandmother talked to him in late August, during which Fayne confessed to three additional killings. They were of 14-year-old Latondra Dean, raped and stabbed to death on March 20, 1992; 9-year-old Fallon Flood, raped and strangled on July 20, 1992 and 17-year-old Glenda Jones, who was raped and stabbed to death on June 25, 1993. All of the victims lived and were killed within a several hundred meter radius from the house in which Lorenzo and his grandmother lived. He was also suspected of killing another girl: 16-year-old Nicole Willis, who was raped and beaten to death a few hundred meters away from the East St. Louis High School on October 16, 1989, but Fayne denied having anything to do with her death. Trial In early 1994, Lorenzo Fayne was put on trial for the murder of Aree Hunt, and was found guilty by the juries. The prosecution demanded that the court impose a death sentence on the child killer, while his lawyers insisted on leniency towards their client and that a life term was given instead, citing the childhood abuse Lorenzo had suffered, which eventually led to mental, emotional and behavioral problems. This was confirmed by his grandmother Nelly, who attended the court hearings and testified in defense of her grandson, describing him in an extremely positive manner. While he managed to remain calm for most of the trial, upon hearing his grandmother's testimony, Lorenzo lost his composure and burst into tears. In August, the jury voted 11-1 to impose the death penalty on him, but as the decision was not unanimous, he was instead sentenced to life imprisonment without the chance of parole. After his conviction, Fayne was sent to serve his sentence at the Menard Correctional Center. He was soon put on trial for the murders of Dean, Flood, Jones and Davis. Based on his confessions and other evidence, in 2001, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. However, in January 2003, the Governor of Illinois, George Ryan, commuted the death sentences of 157 convicts, and he was among those listed. In September 2009, on the basis of DNA profiling, Fayne was linked to the murder of 32-year-old Rita Scott, who was found beaten to death with a blunt object on September 15, 1989 in Milwaukee. He was interrogated for the murder on October 27, 2009, during which he confessed to killing Scott, and having sex with the corpse post-mortem. In conclusion Fayne remained a suspect for the murder of Nicole Willis, until he was eventually excluded via DNA testing. Another East St. Louis resident, 51-year-old Carlos Garrett, was charged and later convicted of her murder in 2013. He continues to serve his sentence at the Menard Correctional Center to this very day.

India's chemical industry ranks as sixth largest in world, and third in Asia. The value of the chemical industry in India was estimated at 100 billion dollars in 2019. The chemical industry of India generates employment for five million people. The Indian chemical industry produces 80,000 different chemical products. India was also the third largest producer of plastic in 2019. As of September 2019, the alkali chemical industry produced 71% of all chemicals produced in India. India's chemical industry accounts about 14% of production in Indian industries. Introduction The Indian chemical industry mainly produces basic types of chemicals as well as knowledge type chemicals and specialty type chemicals as of 2018. In India, Gujarat was the largest state contributor to the chemical industry of India in 2018. India also produces products related to petrochemicals, fertilizers, paints, varnishes, glass, perfumes, toiletries, pharmaceuticals, etc. The India chemical industry is divided into six sub-segments. These sub-segments are Basic Organic Chemicals, Specialty Chemicals, Chlor-alkali, Pesticides, Dyestuff, and alcohol-based chemicals. India is a major producer of basic organic chemicals.  History  In India, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) was established in 1942 with the aim of providing scientific and industrial research to maximize the scientific, economic, and environmental benefits to the people of India. The Indian Chemical Manufacture association, now called Indian Chemical Association (ICC) was founded in 1938 in by P. C. Ray, Rajmitra B. D. Amin and other Industries to promote the national chemical industry of India. In India, the first pharmaceutical company set up was Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceutical. Bengal Chemicals and Pharmaceutical was set up by P.C Ray, professor of chemistry at Calcutta University. After 9 years of settlement of this company, one more company called Alembic Chemical works at Baroda (Now as Vadodara) in Gujarat was set up. Before World War II, foreign companies had the domain in the drug industry of India. After World War II, foreign company domain in drugs decreased and more Indian drug companies were established. During this time, the Indian government established five drug companies. The two of them are Hindustan Antibiotics Limited and Indian Drugs and Pharmaceutical companies. After India got independence from the British Raj in 1947, India established many units of basic chemicals, dyes, textiles and fertilizers. In 1964, a downstream plant was established in Mumbai. In the 1980s and 1990s, the petroleum industry of India had grown faster with the development of the gas cracker, along with related downstream industries for polymers, synthetic fibers, aromatic and other chemicals. In early 1980, the IPCL had established a plant-based on a cracker in Gujarat and Maharashtra. India has been suppressed by inadequate supply and high import duties in the petroleum industry, which led to private industry entry into the petroleum industry. Reliance industries have set up many parts in PatalGanga (Maharashtra), Jamnagar (Gujarat), Hazira (Gujarat). This led to an increased role of Reliance industries in the petroleum industry. This has led to the entry of Reliance industries into the polyester business, such as purified terephthalic acid, and polyethylene terephthalate resin. These new materials are used to make polyester fibre, bottle and filamentation.  Productions  =Basic Organic Chemical Industry= The organic chemicals industry is one of the most significant sectors of the chemical industry in the world. It plays a vital role in providing inputs for other industries of paints, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, dyestuffs and intermediates, leather chemicals, pesticides, etc. Methanol, acetic acid, formaldehyde, pyridines, phenol, allylamines, ethyl acetate, and acetic anhydride are major basic organic chemicals that are produced in India. Six major chemicals are produced in India: Methanol, Aniline, Alkyleamines, and its derivatives Formaldehyde, Acetic Acid, and Phenol contributing to nearly 2/3 of Indian basis organic chemical industry.  Chlor-Alkali Chemical Industry  The chlor-Alkali is an industrial process for the electrolysis of sodium chloride solutions. In India chlor-alkali industry mainly consists of the production of three inorganic chemicals. The mainly three inorganic chemicals that are produced in the form of this industry are Caustic Soda (NaOH), Chlorine (Cl2) and Soda Ash(Na2CO3).https://www.omrglobal.com/industry-reports/india-chlor-alkali- market Hydrogen is also produced in this industry in small amounts. The chlor- alkali industry inputs are mainly used in soaps & detergents, pulp & paper, textiles, aluminium processing industry for caustic soda and for soda ash in glass, silicate production etc apart from soaps & detergents., In fincial year 2019- 2020 of chlor-alkali industry of India over four million metric tons of alkali chemicals were produced. The products that are produced in this industry are soda ash, caustic soda, and liquid chlorine.https://www.statista.com/statistics/726866/india-alkali-chemicals- production-volume/  References  Category: Chemical industry of India ","title":"Chemical industry in India"},{"id":"65194316","text":"Iphthiminus serratus is a species of darkling beetles in the subfamily Tenebrioninae.. Originally I. sublaevis and I. salebrosus were considered subspecies of I. serratus due to minor geographical variation, but this variation is gradual and they are now considered synonyms.  Appearance  They are differentiated from the other species of Iphthiminus as they have only a moderately wrinkled prothorax with moderate serrations of the lateral edges.

Two stations were opened at Grochowska - Rogatki Moskiewskie and Groch√≥w . In July 1915, the Russian troops blew up the Rogatki Moskiewskie station. In 1925, after a tram line was launched along the street, steps were taken to liquidate the railway. On September 7, 1939, the cable car lines were suspended due to hostilities and then reactivated a month later. The Warsaw Uprising prevented the line from running. The WKD Jab≈Çonowska railway was reborn as a state-owned enterprise in 1945. The last time the railway was used at Grochowska Street was on January 31, 1956.

It is situated east of Frascati on the southeastern edge of Downtown and south of the Powi≈õle suburb. Solec was a self governing settlement and town from 1675 until its incorporation into Warsaw in 1791. The name \\"Solec\\" is derived from the Polish word for salt ‚Äì s√≥l ‚Äì which was extensively traded and transported through the neighbourhood since the late Middle Ages. However, contemporary Solec is mostly occupied by residential tower blocks and commercial buildings. History =Middle Ages‚Äì1700s= The village of Solec was first documented in 1381 and in 1382 Janusz I the Old, Duke of Masovia, granted the settlement autonomy, which included trade privileges. Archaeological examinations and excavations have revealed the existence of a medieval port at which barges transporting salt would moor. These barges travelled across the Vistula carrying salt from distant regions such as Krak√≥w and, notably, from the salt mining town of Wieliczka. Symonowicz Palace from 1768 Solec was granted town privileges in 1675 and became part of the jurydyka system, a fully autonomous enclave within lands governed by Warsaw's council. Large salt storehouses were built along the river, including granaries, agricultural facilities and inns for the barge rafters. In 1698, the Trinitarian Order began the construction of a temple which is now the Church of the Holy Trinity. In 1708, an epidemic broke out in the district which killed all of the Trinitarian monks and in 1713 the town was flooded. By the beginning of the 18th century, Solec was already inhabited by 5,000 people. In 1762, a small palatial residence was erected for a wealthy merchant; it was later acquired by an Armenian noble called Simon de Symonowicz. Despite war damage, the Symonowicz Palace still stands today. In 1770, Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski ordered the construction of an entrenchment (Lubomirski Ramparts) which defined the southern border of contemporary Solec. The western part bordering Frascati was then redeveloped into a palatial parkland for Kazimierz Poniatowski, brother of king Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus and lord chamberlain of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth. The Princely Park (Na KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôcem), situated between Frascati and Solec on KsiƒÖ≈ºƒôca Street, was once a venue for oriental structures and pavilions. A 15-metre decorative minaret from the late 18th century stood on the park's grounds until its destruction by the Nazis in 1944, during the Warsaw uprising. =1800‚Äì1939= Solec embankment by Aleksander Gierymski, 1883 The early 19th century brought considerable industrialization to Warsaw and its region; small manufacturing facilities, factories, breweries and cotton mills were built in Solec which further attracted settlement from nearby villages and other countries. On 29 November 1830, the November uprising against the Russians began after a Polish squadron destroyed the Weiss Brewery in the vicinity of the Russian army barracks. With industrialization came gentrification and poverty; Solec became inhabited mostly by middle- or lower-class factory workers and tradesmen. This was in contrast to the adjacent Frascati suburb which was inhabited by the upper classes; nobles, business tycoons and statesmen. In December 1918 a tram line began operation on the neighbourhood's main streets. Despite modernization attempts, the embankment between the Poniatowski Bridge and Marshal Rydz Park (contemporary Wio≈õlarska Street) were occupied by a slum comparable to London's Docklands. This extended to Powi≈õle. In the interwar period (1918‚Äì1939), the areas of Rozbrat and G√≥rno≈õlƒÖska streets was urbanized; a colony of luxurious villas and manors built for Warsaw's intelligentsia which still exists today. =1939‚Äìcontemporary= Powi≈õle Park commercial building The Warsaw uprising in 1944 brought severe destruction to most of the suburb's already low quality shanty buildings, particularly in the south. Some of the most brutal fighting took place in Solec; the Germans hanged or executed most of the captured partisans, including women, in a paint factory. In post-war years, the authorities of the Polish People's Republic attempted to remove the previous slum and industrial character of the neighbourhood. The factories with most workhouses were not reconstructed and were instead replaced by socialist tower blocks and apartment buildings in the 1960s and 1970s. The tram line ceased operation in 1960. Since 1989, the suburb has undergone a major transformation with the construction of new housing estates, hotels, commercial facilities and gradual modernization.

Research The laboratory of Bart Deplancke develops microfluidics, high-throughput sequencing, and single cell genomics tools to study the origin, diversity and functions of stromal cells in adipose tissues as well as to better understand how genomic variations may affect molecular and organismal diversity, with a specific focus on metabolic phenotypes. In particular, Deplancke uses adipogenesis as a model system to better understand the regulatory networks driving cellular differentiation, focusing on the role of transcription factors and transcriptional co-regulators. Using single cell transcriptomics, Deplancke's team discovered the previously unknown adipogenesis-regulatory cells (Aregs), which are endowed with the ability to suppress adipogenesis, a finding that may have important implications for the treatment of chronic metabolic disorders such as obesity or type 2 diabetes. Deplancke's lab has also contributed to the understanding that non-coding genetic variants have broader impact on molecular and organismal diversity than previously expected, thus introducing the concept of variable chromatin modules (VCMs). Together with the laboratory of Trudy Mackay, Deplancke and colleagues characterized the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, with the aim to improve the robustness of genotype to phenotype relationship studies, allowing elucidation of important genetic principles underlying variation in gut immunocompetence.

It is a stepwise, highly efficient process realized in repeated cycles. The procedure makes it possible to prepare millions or even trillions of compounds as mixtures that can be used in drug research. History According to traditional methods, most organic compounds are synthesized one by one from building blocks coupling them together one after the other in a stepwise manner. Before 1982 nobody was even dreaming about making hundreds or thousands of compounds in a single process. Not speaking about millions or even trillions. So the productivity of the split and pool method invented by Prof. √Å. Furka (E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd University Budapest Hungary), in 1982 seemed incredible at first sight.

The split and pool synthesis Flow diagram of the S&P; synthesis. Circles: colored BBs, black and white support, divergent arrows: dividing into equal portions, vertical arrows: coupling; convergent arrows: mixing and homogenizing The split and pool synthesis (S&P; synthesis) differs from traditional synthetic methods. The important novelty is the use of compound mixtures in the process. This is the reason of its unprecedentedly high productivity. Using the method one single chemist can make more compound in a weak than all chemists produced in the whole history of chemistry. The S&P; synthesis is applied in a stepwise manner by repeating three operations in each step of the process: * Dividing a compound mixture into equal portions * Coupling one different building block (BB) to each portion * Pooling and thoroughly mixing the portions The original method is based on the solid-phase synthesis of MerrifieldMerrifield R.B. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. I. The Synthesis of a Tetrapeptide (1963) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85, 2149-2154. The procedure is illustrated in the figure by the flowing diagram showing of a two-cycle synthesis using the same three BBs in both cycles. Choosing the solid phase method in the S&P; synthesis is reasonable since otherwise removal of the by-products from the mixture of compounds would be very difficult. =Features of the synthesis= Efficiency The high efficiency is the most important feature of the method. In a multi step (n) synthesis using equal number of BBs (k) in every step the number of components in a forming combinatorial library (N) is: N=kn This means that the number of components increases exponentially with the number steps (cycles) while the number of the required couplings increases only linearly. If a different number of building BBs are used in the cycles (k1, k2, k3‚Ä¶.kn) the number of the formed components is: N=k1.k2.k3‚Ä¶kn. This feature of the procedure offers the possibility to synthesize a practically unlimited number of compounds. For example if 1000 BBs are used in four cycles 1 trillion compounds are expected to form. The number of needed couplings is only 4000! The reason of the high efficiency Rationalized traditional synthesis. Each formed compound is divided then reacted with one of the reactants of the next step The explanation of the extraordinary efficiency is the use of mixtures in the synthetic steps. If in a traditional reaction one compound is coupled with one reactant and one new compound is formed. If a mixture of compounds containing n components is coupled with a single reactant the number of new compounds formed in the single coupling is n. The difference between the traditional and the split and pool synthesis is convincingly shown by the number of coupling steps in the traditional and the split and pool synthesis of 3,2 million pentapeptides. Conventional synthesis: 3,200,000x5=16,000,000 coupling steps cca 40,000 years S&P; synthesis: 20x5=100 coupling steps cca 5 days It is possible to conduct the conventional synthesis rational way as is shown in the figure. In this case, the number of coupling cycles is: 20+400+8,000+160,000+3,200,000=3,368,420 cca 9,200 years =Components of the library form in equal molar quantities= As far as the chemistry of the couplings make possible the components of the libraries form in nearly equal molar quantity. This is made possible by dividing of the mixtures into equal samples and by homogenization of the pooled samples by thoroughly mixing them. The equal molar quantity of components of the library is very important considering their applicability. The presence of compounds in unequal quantities may lead to difficulties in evaluation of the results in screening. The solid phase method makes it possible to use the reagents in excess to drive the reactions close to completion since the surplus can easily be removed by filtration. The possibility of using two mixtures in the synthesis In principle, the use of two mixtures in the S&P; synthesis can lead to the same combinatorial library that forms in the usual S&P; method. The differences in the reactivity of BBs however, bring about large differences in the concentrations of components, and the differences are expected to increase after each step. Although a considerable amount of labor could be saved by using the two mixtures approach when a high number of BBs are coupled in each position, it is advisable to stick to the normally used S&P; procedure. =The presence of all structural varieties in the library= Formation of all structural variants that can be deduced from the BBs is an important feature of the S&P; synthesis. Only the S&P; method can achieve this in a single process. On the other hand, the presence of all possible structural varieties in a library assures that the library is a combinatorial one and is prepared by combinatorial synthesis. =Forming of one compound in the beads= Formation of one compound on one bead The consequence of using a single BB in couplings is the formation of a single compound in each bead. The formation of OBOC libraries is an inherent property of the S&P; synthesis. The reason is explained in the figure. The structure of the compound formed in a bead depends on the reaction vessels in which the bead happens to occur in the synthetic route. It depends on the decision of the chemist to use the library in the tethered (OBOC) form or cleave down the compounds from the beads and use it as a solution. =Realization of the split and pool synthesis= Manual split and pool synthesizer. The device is an aluminum tube mounted on a laboratory shaker and evacuated by a water pump The split and pool synthesis was first applied to prepare peptide libraries on solid support. The synthesis was realized in a home-made manual device shown in the figure. The device has a tube with 20 holes to which reaction vessels could be attached. One end of the tube is linked to a waste container and a water pump. Left shows loading and filtering, right coupling-shaking position. In the early years of combinatorial chemistry, an automatic machine was constructed and commercialized at AdvancedChemTech (Louisville KY USA). All operations of the S&P; synthesis are carried automatically under computer control. At present, the Titan 357 automatic synthesizer is available at aapptec (Louisville KY, USA).https://www.peptide.com/peptide-synthesizers/titan/ Encoded split and pool synthesis Although in the S&P; synthesis a single compound forms on each bead its structure is not known. For this reason, encoding methods had been introduced to help to determine the identity of the compound contained in a selected bead. Encoding molecules are coupled to the beads in parallel with the coupling of the BBs. The structure of the encoding molecule has to be easier determined than that of the library member on the bead. Ohlmeyer et al. published a binary encoding method.Ohlmeyer MHJ, Swanson RN, Dillard LW, Reader JC, Asouline G, Kobayashi R, Wigler M, Still WC (1993) Complex synthetic chemical libraries indexed with molecular tags, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90; 10922-10926. They used mixtures of 18 tagging molecules that after cleaving them from the beads could be identified by Electron Capture Gas Chromatography.

Sarkar et al. described chiral oligomers of pentenoic amides (COPAs) that can be used to construct mass encoded OBOC libraries.Sarkar M, Pascal BD, Steckler C, Aquino C., Micalizio GC, Kodadek T, Chalmers MJ (1993) Decoding Split and Pool Combinatorial Libraries with Electron Transfer Dissociation Tandem Mass Spectrometry, J Am Soc Mass Spectrom 24(7): 1026-36. Kerr et al. introduced an innovative kind of encoding.J. M. Kerr, S. C. Banville, R. N. Zuckermann J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 2529. An orthogonally protected removable bifunctional linker was attached to the beads. One end of the linker was used to attach the non- natural BBs of the library while to the other end the encoding amino acid triplets were linked. One of the earliest and very successful encoding methods was introduced by Brenner and LernerS. Brenner and R. A. Lerner Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1992, 89, 5381. in 1992. They proposed to attach DNA oligomers to the beads for encoding their content. The method was implemented by Nielsen, Brenner, and JandaJ. Nielsen, S. Brenner, K. D. Janda J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 9812. using the bifunctional linker of Kerr et al. to attach the encoding DNA oligomers. This made it possible to cleave down the compound with the DNA encoding oligomer attached to it. =Split and pool synthesis in solution= Han et al. described a method that made it possible to keep the advantages of both the high efficiency of S&P; synthesis and that of a homogeneous media in the chemical reactions.H. Han, M. M. Wolfe, S. Brenner, K. D. Janda Liquid-phase combinatorial synthesis Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1995, 92:6419. I their method polyethyleneglycol (PEG) was used as soluble support in S&P; synthesis of peptide libraries. MeO-CH2-CH2-O-(CH2-CH2-O)n-CH2-CH2-OH PEG proved suitable for this purpose since it is soluble in a wide variety of aqueous and organic solvents and its solubility provides homogeneous reaction conditions even when the attached molecule itself is insoluble in the reaction medium. Separation from the solution of the polymer and the synthesized compounds bound to it can be achieved by precipitation and filtration. The precipitation requires concentrating the reaction solutions then diluting with diethyl ether or tert-butyl methyl ether. Under carefully controlled precipitation conditions the polymer with the bound products precipitates in crystalline form and the unwanted reagents remain in solution. In the solid phase, S&P; synthesis a single compound forms on each bead, and as a consequence, the number of compounds can‚Äôt exceed the number of beads. So, the theoretical maximum number of compounds depends on the quantity of the solid support and the size of the beads. On 1 g polystyrene resin, for example, a maximum of 2 million compounds can be synthesized if the diameter of the resin beads is 90 ¬µm, and 2 billion can be made if the bead size is 10 ¬µm. In practice, the solid support is used in excess (often tenfold) to be sure that all expected components are formed. The above limitation is completely removed if the solid support is omitted end the synthesis is carried out in solution. In this case, there is no upper limit concerning the number of components of the library. Both the number of components and the quantity of the library can be freely decided based only on practical considerations. An important modification was introduced in the synthesis of DNA encoded combinatorial libraries by Harbury and Halpin.Harbury DR, Halpin DR (2000) WO 00/23458. The solid support in their case is replaced by the encoding DNA oligomers. This makes it possible to synthesize libraries containing even trillions of components and screen them using affinity binding methods. A different way of carrying out solution-phase S&P; synthesis is applying scavenger resins to remove the byproducts. Scavenger resins are polymers having functional groups that make it possible to react with and bind components of the excess of reagents then filtered them out from the reaction mixtureSteven V.

Two examples: a resin containing primary amino groups can remove the excess of acyl chlorides from reaction mixtures while an acyl chloride resin removes amines. A fluorous technology was described by CurranDennis P. Curran Strategy-Level Separations in Organic Synthesis: From Planning to Practice Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 1998, 37, 1174 ‚Äì 1196. The fluorous synthesis employs functionalized perfluoroalkyl (Rf) groups like 4,4,5,5,6,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,9-Tridecafluorononyl {CF3(CF2)4CF2CH2CH2-} group attached to substrates or reagents. The Rf groups make it possible to remove either the product or the reagents from the reaction mixture. At the end of the procedure, the Rf groups attached to the substrate can be removed from the product. By attaching Rf groups to the substrate the synthesis can be carried out in solution and the product can be separated from the reaction mixture by liquid extraction using a fluorous solvent like perfluoromethylcyclohexane or perfluorohexane. It can be seen that the function of the Rf groups in the synthesis is similar to that of the solid or soluble support. If the Rf tag is attached to reagent its excess can be removed from the reaction mixture by extraction. Polymer supported reagents are also used in S&P; synthesis.Stephen W Kaldor, Miles G Siegel Combinatorial chemistry using polymer-supported reagents. Current Opinion in Chemical Biology (1997) 101-106. https://doi.org/10.1016/S1367-5931(97)80115-9. = Special features in the synthesis of DNA encoded combinatorial libraries= Self-assembling DNA encoded libraries Self-assembling library. Circle and pentagon are BBs, blue and red rectangles are their codes. Green rectangles are hybridizing domains One of the best examples of the special features caused by DNA encoding is the synthesis of the self-assembling library introduced by Mlecco et al.Melkko S, Scheuermann J, Dumelin CE, Neri D (2004) Encoded self- assembling chemical libraries Nat Biotechnol 22; 568-574. First, two sublibraries are synthesized. In one of the sublibraries BBs are attached to the 5‚Äô end of an oligonucleotide containing a dimerization domain followed by the codes of the BBs. In the other sublibrary the BBs are attached to the 3‚Äô end of the oligonucleotides also containing a dimerization domain and the codes of another set of BBs. The two sublibraries are mixed in equimolar quantities, heated to 70oC then allowed to cool to room temperature, heterodimerize and form the self-assembling combinatorial library. One member of such two pharmacophore library is shown in the figure. In affinity screening, the two BBs of the pharmacophore may interact with the two adjacent binding sites of the target protein. DNA templated libraries Scheme of a stepwise templated synthesis. Circle, square, star are BBs, color rectangles are codes of BBs Coupling in yocto-reactor In the synthesis of DNA templated combinatorial libraries, the ability of the DNA double helix to direct region- specific chemical reactions is harnessed by Gartner et al.Gartner ZJ, Liu DR (2001) The generality of DNA-templated synthesis as a basis for evolving non- natural small molecules. J Am Chem Soc 123, 6961‚Äì3. doi:10.1021/ja015873n. Xiaoyu Li and David R. Liu DNA-Templated Organic Synthesis: Nature‚Äôs Strategy for Controlling Chemical Reactivity Applied to Synthetic Molecules Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004, 43,4848 ‚Äì 4870. The DNA- linked reagents are kept in close proximity. This is equivalent to the virtual increase of local concentration that is nearly constant within a distance of 30 nucleotides. The proximity effect helps reactions to proceed. Two libraries are synthesized. A template library containing at one end one of the BBs and its code followed by two annealing regions for the codes of the BBs of the two reagent libraries. Each of the two reagent libraries contains a coding oligonucleotide linked with cleavable bonds to the reagent (BB) capable of forming a bond with the already linked BB taking advantage of the proximity effect. The synthesis is realized in two steps as shown in the figure. Each step has three operations: mixing, annealing, coupling-cleaving. Synthesis in Yoctoreactor The yoctoreactor method introduced by Hansen et al.Margit Haahr Hansen, Peter Blakskj√¶r, Lars Kolster Petersen, Tara Heitner Hansen, Jonas Westergaard H√∏jfeldt, Kurt Vesterager Gothelf, Nils Jakob ,Vest Hansen A Yoctoliter-Scale DNA Reactor for Small-Molecule Evolution J. AM. CHEM. SOC. 2009,131, 1322‚Äì1327. is based on the geometry and stability of a three-dimensional DNA structure that creates a yoctoliter (10-24 l) size chemical reactor in which proximity of BBs brings about reactions among them. The DNA oligomers comprise the DNA-barcode for the attached BBs and form the structural elements of the reactor. One kind of yoctoreactor format is shown in the figure. Sequence encoded routing Sequence encoded routing Synthesis of a single- pharmacophore library by stepwise coupling and encoding Harbury and Halpin developed DNA template libraries that direct like genes the synthesis of DNA encoded organic libraries.D. R. Halpin, P. B. Harbury DNA Display I. Sequence- Encoded Routing of DNA Populations PLoS Biology. 2004, 2, 1015-1021.D. R. Halpin, P. B. Harbury DNA Display II. Genetic Manipulation of Combinatorial Chemistry Libraries for Small-Molecule Evolution- PLoS Biology 2004, 2, 1022-1030. The members of the template combinatorial library contain the codes of all BBs and their order of couplings. The figure shows one member of a simple ssDNA template library (A) containing the codes of three BBs (2, 4, 6) that planned to be successively attached. The coding regions are separated by the same non-coding regions (1, 3, 5, 7) in all members. The sequence directed procedure uses a series of columns of resin beads each coated with the anticodon of one of the BBs (B). When the template library is transferred to an anticodon column the proper template member is captured by hybridization then is coupled with the appropriate BB. After finished with all anticodon columns of a coupling position (CP) the libraries are eluted from the beads of the anticodon columns mixed and the mentioned operations are repeated with the series of anticodon columns of the next CP. In figure, C shows one member of the template library captured by the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù second CP anticodon library. The template contains the ‚Äúred‚Äù BB already coupled in CP1 and the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù BB attached after its capture. The final library contains all of the synthesized organic compounds attached to their encoding DNA oligomers. Stepwise coupling and coding One of the most forward-looking method commonly used for DNA-encoding is applied in the synthesis of single-pharmacophore libraries.Mannocci L, Zhang Y, Scheuermann J, Leimbacher M, De Bellis G, Rizzi E, Dumelin C, Melkko S, Neri D. High-throughput sequencing allows the identification of binding molecules isolated from DNA-encoded chemical libraries. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 2008; 105:17670‚Äì17675. As the figure shows the library is built repeating the usual cycles of S&P; synthesis, The second operation of the cycle is modified: in addition to coupling with the BBs the encoding DNA oligomer is elongated by attaching the code of the BB by ligation. =Synthesis using macroscopic units of solid support= Modifications had been developed enabling the split and pool synthesis to produce known compounds in larger quantities than the content of a bead of solid support and retain the high efficiency of the original method. As published by Moran et al.E. J. Moran, S. Sarshar, J. F. Cargill, M. Shahbaz, A Lio, A. M. M. Mjalli, R. W. Armstrong J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995, 117, 10787. and Nicolau et al.K. C. Nicolaou, X ‚ÄìY. Xiao, Z. Parandoosh, A. Senyei, M. P. Nova Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 36, 2289. the resin normally used in the solid phase synthesis was enclosed into permeable capsules including a radiofrequency label recording the BBs in order of their coupling. Both manual and automatic machine was constructed to sort the capsules into the appropriate reaction vessels. A different kind of labeled macroscopic solid support unit was introduced by Xiao et al. X.-Y. Xiao, C. Zhao, H. Potash, M. P. Nova Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl., 1997, 36, 780. The supports are 1x1 cm polystyrene grafted square plates. The medium carrying the code is a 3x3 mm ceramic plate in the center of the synthesis support The code is etched into the ceramic support by a CO2 laser in the form of a two- dimensional bar code that can be read by a special scanner. String synthesis Solid support units. Permeable capsule (A), grafted square plate (B), Mimotope crown with stem, coin-like capsule for automatic sorter Sorting of support units The String Synthesis introduced by Furka et al.√Å. Furka, J. W. Christensen, E. Healy, H. R. Tanner, H. Saneii The string synthesis. A spatially addressable split procedure J. Comb. Chem. 2000, 2, 220. uses stringed macroscopic solid support units (crowns) and the units are identified by their position occupied on the string. One string is assigned for every building block in the synthesis. In the coupling stage, the string is in the proper reaction vessel. The content of the strings coming out from a synthetic step must be redistributed into the strings of the next step. The units are not pooled. The redistribution demonstrated in the figure follows the combinatorial distribution rule: all products formed in a synthetic step are equally divided among all reaction vessels of the next synthetic step. Different distribution formats can be followed that allows the identification the content of each crown depending on the position on the new string and the destination reaction vessel of the string.Furka √Å Redistribution in Combinatorial Synthesis. A Theoretical Approach. Combinatorial Chemistry & High Throughput Screening 2000, 3, 197-209. Stringed crowns (A), sorter trays with slots (B), crowns in slots (C), stringed crowns in reaction vessel (D), third stop in sorting, crowns transferred in this stop are marked black (E) Sketch of the automatic sorter. Stringed crowns (A), sorter trays with slots (B), crowns in slots (C), stringed crowns in a reaction vessel (D), the third stop in sorting, crowns transferred in this stop are marked black (E) The stringed crowns and the trays used in manual sorting are shown in the figure. The destination tray is moved step by step in the direction of the arrow. The crowns are transferred in groups from the slots of the source tray into the all opposite slots of the destination tray. The transfers are directed by computer and the products are identified by the positions of the crowns occupied on the final strings. A fast automatic sorter machine had also been described.√Å. Furka US Patent 7/16/2002. The sorter is outlined in the figure. It has two sets of aligned tubes. The lower ones are step by step moving in the direction showed by the arrow and the coin-like units are dropped from the upper source tubes into the lower destination ones. The tubes may serve as reaction vessels too. A software had also been developed that can direct sorting if not a full combinatorial library is synthesized only a set of its components are prepared that are picked out from the full library.√Å Furka, G Dib√≥, N Gombosuren Preparation of Cherry-Picked Combinatorial Libraries by StringSynthesis.
