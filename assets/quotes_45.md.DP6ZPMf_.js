His reputation is principally based on his popular travel writing: Raggle-Taggle (1933), Spanish Raggle-Taggle (1934) and Don Gypsy (1936). He is known as a translator of Spanish literature, and as a leading authority on the Romani people (Gypsies). He spoke the Romani language fluently. Early life Born in Ballybrack, Killiney, County Dublin, he was the eldest son of William Joseph Myles Starkie (1860‚Äì1920) and May Caroline Walsh. His father was a noted Greek scholar and translator of Aristophanes and the last Resident Commissioner of National Education for Ireland in the United Kingdom (1899‚Äì1920). His aunt, Edyth Starkie, was an established painter married to Arthur Rackham and his godfather was John Pentland Mahaffy, the tutor of Oscar Wilde. The academic Enid Starkie was his sister. Starkie grew up surrounded by writers, artists and academicians. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1920, taking first-class honours in classics, history and political science. After winning first prize for violin at the Royal Irish Academy of Music in 1913, his father, wanting a more traditional career for his son, turned down an opportunity for Walter to audition for Sir Henry Wood, conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra. His violin teacher was the celebrated Italian virtuoso and composer, Achille Simonetti, a master who had been taught by Camillo Sivori, the only pupil of Niccolo Paganini.Walter Starkie, Scholars and Gypsies (1963), P. 90-91. He became the first Professor of Spanish at Trinity College in 1926; his position covered both Spanish and Italian (there was an earlier \\"Professorship of Modern Languages\\" created in 1776 also covering both Italian and Spanish). One of his pupils at Trinity was Samuel Beckett.James Knowlson, Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett (1996), p. 52. As Starkie suffered with chronic asthma throughout his life, he was sent to the warmer climate of Italy during World War I where he joined the YMCA providing entertainment for the British troops. After the armistice in November 1918, he befriended in the town of Montebello Vicentino five Hungarian Gypsy prisoners of war and aided them in acquiring wood to construct makeshift fiddles. To one of them, Farkas, he became a bloodbrother and he swore that he would someday visit Farkas in Hungary and mix with the Gypsy's tribe. That oath would affect the course of his life.Walter Starkie, Raggle- Taggle: Adventures with a Fiddle in Hungary and Romania (1933), p. 3-6. While on tour in Northern Italy he met Italia Augusta Porchietti, an Italian Red Cross nurse and amateur opera singer who was singing to patients and wounded soldiers at a hospital ward in Genoa. They were married on 10 August 1921 and had a son, Landi William, and a daughter, Alma Delfina. Abbey Theatre After the publication of his book on Luigi Pirandello, Starkie became a director of the Abbey Theatre in 1927 at the invitation of W.B. Yeats.Robert Welch, Bruce Stewart, The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature (1996), p.534. Recent productions had been fraught with controversy, and one of his roles was to act as arbiter among the factions. In 1928, while Starkie was away in Italy, Yeats, along with Lady Gregory and Lennox Robinson, the other two board members, rejected Se√°n O'Casey's fourth play, The Silver Tassie, his lament of the First World War. When he returned to Dublin he voiced his disagreement with the other board members saying that, \\"This play was written with the purpose of showing the useless brutality of war and the public should be allowed to judge it for themselves. O'Casey is groping for a new kind of drama and the Abbey should produce the play\\".Kokomo Daily Tribune, Indiana, 6 July 1928 In light of his previous successes at the Abbey Theatre the rejection caused much controversy and O'Casey severed his relations with the theatre and took the play to London where it premiered on 11 October 1929 at the Apollo Theatre with Charles Laughton and Barry Fitzgerald under the direction of Raymond Massey. To many observers the loss of O'Casey marked the beginning of a decline in the fortunes of the Abbey. The following year (1928) the board rejected Denis Johnston's modernist play Shadowdance, and Starkie was charged with giving Johnston the bad news. In his spindly handwriting he wrote on the draft title-page the five words (referring to Lady Gregory), \\"The Old Lady Says NO\\", which Johnston used to retitle the play before putting on at Dublin's Gate Theatre the following year to considerable critical acclaim. At the start of World War II, Britain chose to send Catholics to Spain as their representatives, and so the Irish-Catholic, fiddle-playing Starkie was sent to Madrid as the British Council representative, which took him away from the theatre and nightlife of Dublin, and into World War II Spain. He resigned from the Abbey Theatre on 17 September 1942 and on the same day he accepted the invitation of Hilton Edwards and Miche√°l MacLiamm√≥ir to be on the board of directors at the Gate Theatre. He was one of the founders of the Centre International des √âtudes Fascistes (CINEF).Richard Griffiths, Fascism: 1880‚Äì1930 (2005), p. 42. Its only publication, A Survey of Fascism (1928), had an article by him, \\"Whither is Ireland Heading ‚Äì Is It Fascism? Thoughts on the Irish Free State?\\"Griffiths, p. 125.Clair Wills, That Neutral Island (2007), p. 347-8. During the 1930s, along with George Bernard Shaw and W.B. Yeats he was an apologist for Benito Mussolini, whom he had interviewed in 1927.The Irish Times ‚Äì Weekend Edition, Adrian Frazier, 8 February 2003 In general terms he was influenced by the Irish poet and mystic George William Russell (AE) in his writing on co-operatives. He travelled to Abyssinia in 1935 and later wrote in favour of the Italian campaign there, opposing √âamon de Valera's call for sanctions,Clair Wills, That Neutral Island (2007), p. 347. fearing they would further isolate Italy and drive Benito Mussolini into an alliance with Adolf Hitler. However soon after his appointment in Madrid his wife dropped her first name \\"Italia\\" to avoid being branded an agent of Mussolini.Jimmy Burns, Papa Spy: Love, Faith and Betrayal in Wartime Spain, (2009), p. 252-253. British Institute, Madrid Sent to Spain as the British cultural representative he was the founder and first director of the British Institute in Madrid (1940‚Äì1954), and went on to open branches in Barcelona, Bilbao, Seville and Valencia. The institute was backed by the British Council and through lectures and exhibitions worked to influence Spanish opinion during World War II and help maintain Spanish neutrality. Upon accepting this position he made a promise to Lord George Lloyd not to write any new books and to put the \\"Raggle-Taggle Gypsies\\" to rest for the duration of the war. However, Spain, owing to her non-belligerent status, became an asylum for refugees from all over Europe, so his promise to curtail hobnobbing with Gypsies became impractical.Walter Starkie, In Sara's Tents (1953), p.7-10. The Institute stood apart from the British Embassy which tended to be stand-offish toward their local nationals. It was in itself an embassy to the survivors of Spain's intellectual eclipse following the Spanish Civil War. One Starkie's early triumphs was organising a recital by the Czech pianist Rudolf Firku≈°n√Ω who, in October 1940, was passing through Madrid on his way to the United States. Starkie was able to locate a new Steinway and the concert went ahead bringing together a significant gathering of Madrid society as well as representatives from the American Embassy and Dutch, Polish, Egyptian, Turkish and Czech Ministers. In May 1943, the actor Leslie Howard came to Madrid to present a lecture on Hamlet in which he showed similarities between the play and the actions of Hitler. On his return trip to London from Lisbon the plane on which he was travelling, BOAC Flight 777, was shot down over the Bay of Biscay. Among the 4 crew and 13 passengers who perished was the prominent Jewish activist Wilfrid Israel, Francis German Cowlrick and Gordon Thomas MacLean who had lunched together at the Madrid British Institute.Ian Colvin, Flight 777: The Mystery of Leslie Howard, (1957), London On any one evening one could count on finding in the Institute at Calle Almagro 5, a great novelist such as P√≠o Baroja, a rising star like Camilo Jos√© Cela (Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature, 1989), the essayist Azor√≠n, composers like Joaqu√≠n Rodrigo and painters such as Ignacio Zuloaga.Tom Burns, The Use of Memory: Publishing and Further Pursuits (1993), p.102-103. Burns was First Secretary and Press Attach√© at the British Embassy in Madrid during World War II. He left behind him a thriving Institute. During the war he also helped organise and operate an escape route across the Pyrenees for British airmen shot down over France.James Michener, Iberia (1968), p.793-794. Walter and Augusta also allowed their large flat at number 24 Calle del Prado to be used as a safe house for escaping prisoners of war and Jewish refugees.Jimmy Burns, Papa Spy: Love, Faith and Betrayal in Wartime Spain, (2009), p. 253. He was professor of comparative literature at the Complutense University of Madrid, from 1947 to 1956. After he retired from the British Institute he accepted a university position in the United States. It was his third American tour, taking him to the University of Texas, Austin (1957‚Äì58), New York University (1959), Kansas University (1960), Colorado University (1961), and finally to the University of California, Los Angeles (1961‚Äì70) where as Professor-in- Residence he was assigned to lecture in six Departments (English, Folklore- Mythology, Italian, Music, Spanish-Portuguese, and Theatre). After his retirement from U.C.L.A. he returned with his wife, Italia Augusta, to live in Madrid. After suffering from a severe cardiac asthma attack he died on 2 November 1976 in Madrid. Italia followed him six months later on 10 May 1977. They are buried in the British Cemetery in Madrid. Writings He won fame for his travels and was profiled by Time Magazine as a modern-day 'gypsy'. He published accounts of his experiences as a university vacation vagabond following the trail of the Gypsies in Raggle Taggle, subtitled \\"Adventures with a fiddle in Hungary and Roumania\\" and sequels, Spanish Raggle Taggle and Don Gypsy which are picaresque accounts in the tradition of George Borrow, with frontispieces by Arthur Rackham. His observations of Gypsy life, while more anecdotal than scholarly, provide insights into these nomadic people. As Julian Moynahan said in reviewing Scholars and Gypsies for The New York Times Book Review (24 November 1963): \\"Many lives have been more interesting and enviable in the telling than the living, but not so here. Emerging from the shadow of a somewhat blighted inheritance, Walter Starkie chose and enjoyed a lifelong freedom which most of us throw away with both hands on the day we leave school and take our first jobs.\\" He was the President of the Gypsy Lore Society from 1962 to 1973. In addition to publishing a 1964 translation of plays from the Spanish Golden Age in the Modern Library volume as Eight Spanish Plays of the Golden Age, he published an abridged translation of Don Quixote in hardcover for Macmillan Publishers in London in 1954. Illustrated with drawings done by Gustave Dor√© in 1863 for the French language edition, Starkie's biographical introduction of Cervantes was 116 pages long. In 1957 the abridged version of his translation was published for Mentor Books in the United States with the introduction shortened to seven pages. In 1964 Starkie published his complete and unabridged version of his translation for New American Library. Written in contemporary English, both unabridged and abridged versions have been in print since their publications, and are considered highly accurate, but Starkie does occasionally put Irish slang and phrase construction (e.g. the phrase \\"I'm thinking\\", instead of \\"I think\\", and the oath \\"Bad 'cess to you!\\") into the mouths of its peasant characters. This is a trait he repeats in his translation of The Mask, a brief one-acter by Lope de Rueda published in Eight Spanish Plays of the Golden Age.

It was consecrated by Narayana Guru. It is dedicated to Gokarnanatha, a form of Lord Shiva. This temple was built in 1912 by Adhyaksha HoigeBazar Koragappa. The temple is 2 km from the centre of Mangalore city. The temple has Gopuram (tower like structure) decorated with murals of various gods and goddesses. Murals depict scenes from Hindu epics and legends.  History  Narayana Guru: Spiritual Guru of Billavas. Founder of the temple = Origin = The Billava community traditionally warriors (chieftains/ soldiers specialized in archery in the army) and local medics wanted to carve a niche (a place of their own liking in terms of spiritual offerings) for themselves in the realm of spirituality. It is in such a scenario that the community found a messiah in Narayana Guru to guide them in this spiritual quest. Narayana Guru with his knowledge and experience in spirituality (Shaivism) became the ideal guide and guru (from the south of India closest to Mangalore) for the billavas to help them build a temple of their deity, Lord Shiva Learning about the work undertaken by Narayana Guru, through his temples in Kerala, a prominent Billava leader Adhyaksha H. Koragappa visited Shri Narayana Guru in 1908. Adhyaksha Koragappa, the builder of the Gokarnath Temple. A great devotee of Shri Narayana Guru and Bhagawan Nityananda of Ganeshpuri Adhyaksha HoigeBazar Koragappa was a very well-known businessman in Mangalore, renowned for his integrity and philanthropy. He owned a large tile factory in Hoige Bazaar where he had his business offices. The tile factory was called HAMIDIAH Tile Works (Est in 1905). Shri Koragappa also conducted extensive trade in the 1900s up to the Second World War, with business enterprises in the Middle East, Africa, Singapore, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, trading in Mangalore tiles, copra, spices, dried fish and other natural products. He was a very wealthy businessman who was also honoured by King George V for his philanthropic work. He used to replace the \\"K\\" (Koragappa) in his name with a \\"C\\" (Coragappa) which proved to be lucky for him in business An additional reason for Shri Koragappa to undertake the trip was that his son-in-law H. Somappa was very ill. Adhyaksha Koragappa went to Shri Narayana Guru for his blessings to cure his son-in-law. The Gokarnath temple pond in Kudroli had a marker in marble in memory of H. Somappa. In the \\"modernization\\" of the temple this plaque lost. Sometimes modernization can pay a heavy price in terms of history. This desecration is not forgotten and people losing elections happened after this terrible act. Narayana Guru visited Mangalore in 1908 after accepting the invitation of Adhyaksha Koragappa. Narayana Guru in Mangalore selected the place Kudroli (between places Narayana Guru had chosen, Kudroli and Mulihithilu) while riding in a horse-drawn coach provided by Adhyaksha Koragappa. Mulihithilu in Mangalore was also a place of interest for the Shiva temple as there was heightened Shiva aaradhana at that place with the presence of saints from the NATH tradition such as Matsyendranath (blessed the construction of Shri Mangaladevi (linga roopa - Goddess Parvathi) temple), Tilaknath (His place in mulihithilu has a shrine of Kallurti Kalkuda Daiva/ Demigod/ Bhootha (cohorts of Lord Shiva), Machindranath and Gorakhnath are also believed to have set foot from nethravati on mulihithilu, all these saints being ardent followers of Lord Shiva and coming across generations. It is said that Narayana Guru had got the Shiva Lingam (main deity) specifically for this temple. How Narayana Guru got this Lingam and from where he got this Lingam is still a mystery. With the blessings given by Shri Narayana Guru to Adhyaksha Koragappa to commence work, smooth progress in the temple's construction was ensured. Gokarnanatha Kshethra, Mangalore, foundation stone was originally laid by the couple Siri Amma Poojarthi and Chennappa Poojary in 1908. They were foster parents of Koragappa Poojary. Chennappa Poojary is the son of Ugga Poojaary who was responsible to build Brahma Baidarkala Garadi Kshethra, Kankannady, Mangalore in the year 1882. Narayana Guru formally consecrated the temple in February 1912 with the establishment of sacred Shiva Linga.The information is referred from the original record of the Gokarnanatha Kshethra. He named this place as Gokarnanatha Kshethra. As per the Guru's advice, idols of Ganapathy, Subramanya, Annapoorneshwari, Bhairava, the Nava Grihas (Lords of nine planets), Shanishwara and Krishna are installed at the Kshethra. This has helped devotees worship at all these sannidanams (abodes) and seek blessings and solace for their problems. Not only did Adhyaksha Koragappa donate the land needed for the Kshethra, in addition he was also chosen as the first administrative head of the temple. Till date Koragappa Family has been leading the temple administration with equal support if not more from many distinguished members of the community such as Janardhan Poojary (Former Union Minister and Congress President) (Renovation Mastermind/ Architect), Vishwanath (BNS Hotel), Chandrashekar (SCS group), Damodar Suvarna (Roopa Hotel), Jaya C. Suvarna, to name a few. = Renovation = Shri Somasunderam, son of Koragappa (President of Kudroli temple), and Vishwanath (BNS Hotel) (President Development committee) discussed the possibility of renovating the temple with Janardhan Poojary (Former Union Minister and Congress President). It was then decided that the temple committee would go to the people to raise funds. It was here that Janardhan Poojary earned the title \\"Renovation Mastermind/ Architect\\". Rallies were organized across the country focusing mainly on Dakshina Karnataka, Udupi and Mumbai areas. Janardhan Poojary was a part of many such rallies and in one such rally in Dakshina Karnataka, the story goes that a person wearing shorts walked up to Janardhan Poojary and gave him 5 paise as his contribution to the development work. Janardhan Poojary astonished took the money. After the speech of Janardhan Poojary people tried to search for this person but no one could trace him. Some believe that it was Lord Shiva Incarnate who blessed this collection of funds by the way of this man in shorts. It is believed that after this incident funds started pouring in. The people just came forward and contributed to their temple. It was one great movement that showed the strength of the masses. This temple started off with one man's vision - founder H Koragappa and today with the guidance of the eminent members of the community and temple committee what stands is the love, effort and sweat of the masses who contributed in their very special way to make the current Gokarnanatheshwara temple a reality. Sthapadi K. Dakshinamoorthy was the architect who designed and built the present temple in the Chola style of architecture from its original Kerala style. The new gopuram is 60 feet in height and very beautiful. The renovated Gokarnanatha Kshethra was inaugurated by the former Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, shortly before his assassination during an election rally. A marble statue of Narayana Guru was erected at the entrance of the temple in 1966 and a crown studded with precious gems was given by the devotees later. It's estimated the renovation cost Rs. 1 crore, and now it has become one of the largest temples in Mangalore.Kudroli Sri Gokarnatheshwara temple Later in the year 2007 Bhagwaan Hanumaan Mandir was built in the Gokarnanatha Kshethra premises at the entrance. Bhagwaan Hanumaan Mandir in turn adds beauty to the Kshethra. The samadhis of H. Koragappa, H. Somappa along with their deceased family members lie with appropriate markers in the family plot in Gori Gudde (cemetery) in Attavar, Mangalore. The tomb of Uggappu, Shri Koragappa's original mother can still be found in Gori Gudde erected by Shri Koragappa himself Pages from a book that describes the first meeting of Bhagawan Nityananda and Adhyaksha Koragappa at Hoige Bazaar, Mangalore Adhyaksha Koragappa was also a great devotee of Bhagawan Nityananda of Ganeshpuri and Bhagawan performed several miracles at the home of Adhyaksha Koragappa on Goodshed Road in Bunder. The first meeting of Bhagawan Nityananda and Adhyaksha Koragappa is described in the book Avadhoot Bhagawan Nityananda, on page 31. The book is authored by Swami Vijayananda of Nityananda Dhyana Mandira, Bevinakoppa. It is an astonishing fact, that given the close connection that the Supreme Dattatreya Avadhoot Bhagawan Nityananda had with Adhyaksha Koragappa, the authorities of the Gokarnath Temple never installed a statue of Bhagawan Nityananda in the temple premises. Shri H. Somasunder, Adhyaksha Koragappa's son was the president, during whose tenure effort was put into addressing temple matters and bringing the temple to prominence. Today HS Sairam, Adhyaksha Koragappa's grandson is the president and continues this legacy and vision of Shree Adhyaksha Koragappa to help spirituality empower and enable masses. This along with Sairam's effort to enhance the grandeur of the temple, the latest addition being the Mahastamba where he personally visited Kerala and got the design crafted by able designers. The eminent Indian-American mathematician Sagun Chanillo is a great grandson of Adhyaksha Coragappa and the grandson of H. Somappa.http://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~chanillo  Miracles of Narayana Guru  Narayana Guru was revered in the southern part of India for his spiritual quests in the field of Shaivism. He performed many miracleshttp://www.sreenarayanaguru.in/content/miracles helping people all along  Festivals  leftThe temple observes many festivals. Maha Shivaratri, Krishnashtami, Ganesh Chaturthi, Nagara Panchami, Deepavali, Navaratri, Sri Narayana Jayanthi are celebrated with traditional gaiety and splendour. It has worshipers from all over the world. The temples branches are in Mulki, Udupi and Katpady. The birthday of Sri Narayana Guru is ceremoniously followed. The Kshethra also follows the ritual of feeding devotees who visit it daily. Community Sri Satyanarayana Pooja, Sri Shani Pooja, free mass marriages and distribution of scholarship to deserving students are traditions, too. Today, the Kshethra attracts devotees from all religions and communities. The Billava community has come of age. The Kshethra can be rightly called the melting pot of all religions symbolising unity in diversity. = Navaratri = The dasara festival is celebrated with much grandeur. The dasara celebrations of this temple is popularly called Mangalore Dasara. Mangalore Dasara was started by B.R.Karkera. In addition to idols of Sharada Matha and Maha Ganapati, life-size idols of Nava Durgas are installed in the premises in an attractive way during Navaratri. All religious rites are observed for the entire period. Tableaux form a special part of the festivities and are taken around the main thoroughfares of Mangalore. Mangalore Dasara is celebrated in a very spectacular way by worshiping the idol of Ganesh, Adhi Shakthi Maatha, Sharada Maatha, Navadurgas such as Shaila Puthri Maatha, Brahmachaarini Maatha, Chandrakaantha Maatha, Kushmaandini Maatha, Skanda Maatha, Kathyaahini Maatha, Maha Kaali Maatha, Maha Gowri Maatha and Siddhi Dhaathri Maatha. All these idols are grandly worshiped for nine days of navarathri. On the tenth day, these idols are taken in the grand procession of Mangalore Dasara throughout the city; the procession returns to Gokarnanatha Kshethra on the next day morning where all the above idols are immersed in the lake inside the temple premises.

Controversies Shri Janardhan Poojary performed Urul seva (rolling around the temple) so that Sonia Gandhi could be cured, and she could win the General elections of 2014. Since Shri Poojary is very much part of the administration of this temple, it would appear that the temple administration has injected politics into religion.

Born in Pendleton, South Carolina on April 29, 1814, Miller moved with his parents to Rabun County, Georgia in 1820. He attended the common schools and graduated from the Medical College of South Carolina in 1835. He continued medical studies in Paris and commenced practice in Cassville, Georgia, in 1838. Miller was an unsuccessful Whig candidate for election as a U.S. Representative to the twenty-ninth United States Congress in 1844. Miller was a slave owner. In 1840, he owned 10 slaves. In 1850, he owned 3 slaves. In 1860, he owned 20 slaves. During the Civil War, Miller served in the Confederate army as a surgeon and as a medical director, surgeon of posts, and inspector of hospitals in Georgia. He resumed the practice of medicine in Rome, Georgia and was a member of the faculty of the Atlanta Medical College. Subsequently, he was trustee of the University of Georgia in Athens. Miller was a member of the state Reconstruction convention in 1867. Upon the restoration of Georgia's congressional representation, Miller was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate on July 28, 1868. However, he did not qualify (and thus was not seated) until February 24, 1871. He served until the end of his term on March 3, 1871. Miller's tenure in the Senate, at a mere seven days long, ranks (as of 2017) as the second-shortest in American history. The shortest Senate tenure belongs to Sen. Louis C. Wyman from New Hampshire, who served for only three days from his appointment on December 31, 1974, to the end of his term on January 3, 1975. (The second tenure of Sen. Salmon P. Chase from Ohio is shorter, lasting two days from the beginning of his term on March 4, 1861, to his resignation on March 6, 1861; however, Chase had previously already served a full term from March 4, 1849, to March 3, 1855, so he is not the shortest-serving senator.) The third- shortest Senate tenure belongs to Sen. Alva M. Lumpkin from South Carolina, who served three days longer than Miller; he served for ten days from his appointment on July 22, 1941, to his death on August 1, 1941. Miller died in Atlanta on May 31, 1896, and was interred in Myrtle Hill Cemetery in Rome, Georgia.

The word sipsi is possibly onomatopoeic. In ancient Greece, it was known as kalamavlos (Œ∫Œ±ŒªŒ¨ŒºŒ±œÖŒªŒøœÇ), meaning cane-flute. The sipsi can be made of bone, wood, or reed, though the reed variant is most common. Its size varies from region to region, but it generally contains five finger holes in the front, and one finger hole in the back. The sipsi is one of many reed instruments in Turkey used to play lead melodies in instrumental folk music. It is generally played in the Western part in the Aegean Region of Turkey. Most folk tunes played in this area with the sipsi are in 9/8 time. Playing The timbre of the sipsi is similar to that of the Irish bagpipe, and players of the sipsi also employ the circular breathing method, in which air is breathed through the nose while it is being pumped out of stored air in the cheeks. This breathing method is used to form an uninterrupted sound. To tune the sipsi, one must wrap a thread around the bottom of the reed, which is placed into the main body of the instrument. Adjusting the reed with the string is the way to tune. The instrument's range is greater than its six finger holes would suggest, the upper registers can be attained by particular approach to breathing.

They are a major component of kaolin and other clay minerals. Andalusite, kyanite, and sillimanite are naturally occurring aluminosilicate minerals that have the composition Al2SiO5. The triple point of the three polymorphs is located at a temperature of 500 ¬∞C and a pressure of 0.4 GPa. These three minerals are commonly used as index minerals in metamorphic rocks. Hydrated aluminosilicate minerals are referred to as zeolites and are porous structures that are naturally occurring materials. Feldspar is a common tectosilicate aluminosilicate mineral made of potassium, sodium, and calcium cations surrounded by a negatively charged network of silicon, aluminum and oxygen atoms. The catalyst silica-alumina is an amorphous substance which is not an aluminosilicate compound.  Aluminosilicate glasses There exist a wide variety of glass types. The characteristics of these different types depend on the chemical composition of the glass with a special focus on the oxide composition. Glasses can be categorized into many different groups, one of them including the so-called aluminosilicate glasses. =Properties= Aluminosilicate glasses can be formulated to tolerate temperatures up to 800 ¬∞C, temperatures substantially above those of borosilicate glasses and comparable to ceramic materials, maximum temperatures being determined by the material's transformation temperature. Their formulations can also be matched to the thermal expansion coefficients of electrodes, e.g. molybdenum, making possible the creation, via hot-forming processes, of extremely tight gas-proof glass to metal seals. =Alkaline earth aluminosilicate glasses= Characteristically, these glasses are free of alkali oxides and contain 15-25% Al2O3, 52-60% SiO2 and about 15% alkaline earths. Very high transformation temperatures and softening points are typical features. Main fields of application are glass bulbs for halogen lamps, high-temperature thermometers and thermally and electrically highly loadable film resistors. =Alkali aluminosilicate glasses= The Al2O3 content of alkali aluminosilicate glasses is typically 10-25% and the alkali content over 10%. The high alkali content prepares the glass for ion exchange with bigger alkali ions in order to improve the surface compressive strength. Due to this particular feature, this glass type is especially suitable for the use in touch displays, solar cells cover glass and laminated safety glass. High transformation temperatures and outstanding mechanical properties, e.g. hardness and scratch behavior, are characteristic of this glass type.

It falls within the civil parish of Marksbury and is 8 miles from Bristol, and Bath, and 5 miles from Keynsham.  History  The origin of the name Hunstrete is unclear. One explanation is that it means 'The hundred road' from the Old English hund and street. Other possible derivations are the personal name hund and Old English steort meaning a projecting piece of land, or hund, meaning hound or dog, relating to the place where they were kept. Although occupation during the Iron Age is possible the earliest evidence are Roman coins from the emperor Carausius, and continuous occupation during the Saxon period may have been connected with the nearby Wansdyke. A charter of 936 suggests the land was given to a thegn by the name of Ethelelm by √Üthelstan. The manor was granted to Glastonbury Abbey who held it until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 when it was forfeit to the crown and granted to Richard Watkins. At the beginning of the 17th century it passed to the family of Sir John Popham, whose descendants sold off portions of land in the intervening years but owned Hunstrete House until 1977.  Government and politics  Hunstrete is part of the Farmborough Ward, which is represented by one councillor on the Bath and North East Somerset Unitary Authority, which has responsibilities for services such as education, refuse, tourism etc. The village is a part of North East Somerset, and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.  Demographics  According to the 2001 Census, the Farmborough Ward (which includes Compton Dando, Marksbury, Woollard and Chewton Keynsham), had 1,111 residents, living in 428 households, with an average age of 44.5 years. Of these 71% of residents describing their health as 'good', 21% of 16- to 74-year-olds had no qualifications; and the area had an unemployment rate of 1.0% of all economically active people aged 16‚Äì74. In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004, it was ranked at 22,100 out of 32,482 wards in England, where 1 was the most deprived LSOA and 32,482 the least deprived.  Hunstrete House  Hunstrete House Hunstrete House is a Grade II listed building dating from 1820. In its grounds are Hunstrete Lake, a walled garden and an icehouse which is also a listed building. In September 2007 a team from the television programme Time Team visited Hunstrete to explore stories about the \\"Grand Mansion\\" which preceded the current house. It is thought that Francis Popham (died 1779), a descendant of Sir John Popham, started the construction of a 17-bay mansion which was, however, suspended after his death and abandoned after the death of his wife Dorothy (Hutton) in 1797. The construction which had taken place was demolished in 1836, leaving just a line of arches. The main staircase, fireplace and chandelier were used in the restoration of Prior Park in Bath. The excavations undertaken tried to identify whether there was a previous medieval or Tudor manor house on the site. The programme was aired on 17 February 2008, and showed that the \\"Grand Mansion\\" was really the addition of a new exterior to a previous building.  Other buildings of note  Other Grade II listed buildings in the area are a pair of mid-nineteenth-century cottages, and a fragment of an arcade from an earlier large house, dating from c.1700.

The rest frame of compound objects (such as a fluid, or a solid made of many vibrating atoms) is taken to be the frame of reference in which the average momentum of the particles which make up the substance is zero (the particles may individually have momentum, but collectively have no net momentum). The rest frame of a container of gas, for example, would be the rest frame of the container itself, in which the gas molecules are not at rest, but are no more likely to be traveling in one direction than another. The rest frame of a river would be the frame of an unpowered boat, in which the mean velocity of the water is zero. This frame is also called the center-of-mass frame, or center-of- momentum frame. The center-of-momentum frame is notable for being the reference frame in which the total energy (total relativistic energy) of a particle or compound object, is also the invariant mass (times the scale- factor speed of light squared). It is also the reference frame in which the object or system has minimum total energy. In both special relativity and general relativity it is essential to specify the rest frame of any time measurements, as the time that an event occurred is dependent on the rest frame of the observer. For this reason the timings of astronomical events such as supernovae are usually recorded in terms of when the light from the event reached Earth, as the \\"real time\\" that the event occurred depends on the rest frame chosen. For example, in the rest frame of a neutrino particle travelling from the Crab Nebula supernova to Earth the supernova occurred in the 11th Century AD only a short while before the light reached Earth, but in Earth's rest frame the event occurred about 6300 years earlier.

She presented the British television programme Watchdog with co-presenter John Stapleton who was also her husband. Early life and career Faulds Wood was born on 25 March 1948 in Glasgow and grew up on Loch Lomond side. She gained an MA in languages from Glasgow University. She taught French at Holland Park School for two years. Her early career in journalism involved periods at IPC Magazines' Woman (1977‚Äì79), the Daily Mail (1979‚Äì80) then \\"Lynn's Action Line\\" at The Sun where 100,000 readers joined her campaign to close the pet market Club Row,The Sun 'Stop This Cruelty' 09.11.81 and thousands of readers marched on Downing Street.The Sun 'Thousands March To Save Our Pets' 23.11.81 When \\"breakfast television\\" began in the early 1980s, Faulds Wood joined TV-am as their \\"Consumer Champion\\" from 1983‚Äì84 then moved to the BBC's Breakfast Time from 1984 to 1986. She is best known for turning Watchdog into a peak time BBC One series, presenting the programme from 1985 to 1993 with her husband John Stapleton. In 1991, Faulds Wood was diagnosed with level three bowel cancer. Five years after surgery, she was found to be clear. (She also survived skin cancer.) Meanwhile, with a programme entitled \\"Doctor Knows Best\\", she contributed in 1993 to ITV's World In Action series. Faulds Wood found the symptoms for bowel cancer were different to those taught in GP training in medical schools. This edition of World In Action achieved the programmes highest audience with 10.2 million viewers. In her 1996 investigation into bowel cancer, \\"Bobby Moore & Me\\", she interviewed the widow of footballer Bobby Moore, who said he had been misdiagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and treated for the condition instead of the bowel cancer from which he died aged 51. It had 6.5 million viewers and 28,000 letters. A series on cervical cancer in 1995, The Lady Killers, led the British Medical Association to name Faulds Wood medical broadcaster of the year. She also helped to create the world's first evidence- based guide to symptoms of her cancer, officially adopted by the Department of Health in 2000. In 1990, Faulds Wood guest starred on an episode of French and Saunders as herself. From 2003 to 2009, she was \\"Consumer Champion\\" on GMTV. In 2006, she teamed up with presenter Esther Rantzen and series producer Rob Unsworth to present the BBC consumer investigation series Old Dogs, New Tricks. In 2014, Faulds Wood returned to Watchdog, with a new daytime BBC One series, Watchdog Test House, which she co-presented with Sophie Raworth. Campaigning work In 2002, she co-founded the European Cancer Patient Coalition, which she chaired 2003‚Äì2010. She helped to set up MEPs Against Cancer and is credited with helping to get cancer on the official European Agenda. In 2009, she was invited to present the new European cancer plan ‚Äì Action Against Cancer ‚Äì in Brussels. In 2010, Faulds Wood said that she was considering entering politics by standing for the Parliament of the United Kingdom at the general election. Instead she remained as a health campaigner, still regularly appearing on television talking about cancer and consumer matters. She chaired the British Standards Institution Consumer and Public Interest Network until 2013, and served as President and Patron of many charities and health organisations, with an honorary doctorate for services to bowel cancer. Personal life While working as a teacher, Faulds Wood also worked in a pub in Richmond upon Thames. As a barmaid there she first met British journalist and television presenter John Stapleton; the couple married in 1977. Faulds Wood and her husband lived in St Margarets, London. In late December 2016, Faulds Wood declined the offer of an MBE in the New Year Honours. \\"I would love to have an honour if it didn't have the word 'empire' on the end of it. We don't have an empire, in my opinion,\\" she told the Press Association. She did accept an honorary doctorate from Glasgow University of which she was already a graduate. A statement released by her family on 24 April 2020 said she had died after a stroke, aged 72.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The boat is a development of the John O. Johnson-designed J Scow of the mid-1950s, significantly re-designed by Melges. Production The design has been built by Melges Performance Sailboats and Johnson Boat Works in the United States since 1956, with a total of 2,600 boats completed. Johnson went out of business in 1998, but the boat remains in production by Melges. Design The MC Scow is a recreational sailboat, with the reverse sheer scow hull built predominantly of fiberglass, with mahogany wood trim. It has a catboat rig with anodized aluminum spars, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and dual retractable bilgeboards. It displaces . The boat has a draft of with a bilgeboard extended and can be transported on a trailer. For sailing the design is equipped with hiking straps and has a mainsail window to improve visibility. It also has a 2:1 mechanical advantage, four-part mainsheet traveler, a Cunningham, a 12:1 boom vang and a 3:1 outhaul. It is normally raced by a crew of one to three sailors. Operational history By 1994 the boat was being raced in 21 fleets in Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa. By 2020 it was being raced in over 100 fleets across the United States. In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"single-hander? Catboat? Scow? Well, it has bilgeboards.

In 1984 He Xinlu named and described the type species Kaijiangosaurus lini. The generic name refers to the River (jiang) Kai. The specific name honours the paleontologist Lin Wenqiu. Discovery The holotype specimen, CCG 20020, was discovered in Sichuan, in a layer of the Xiashaximiao Formation dating from the Bathonian-Callovian. The specimen consists of a fragmentary skeleton lacking the skull. The holotype proper contains the intercentrum of the atlas and the third to ninth neck vertebrae. Other elements have been designated as a paratype, including fragmentary remains of the skull, nine teeth, elements of the pectoral girdle, a forelimb, and a hindlimb. Another paratype is the thighbone of a probably smaller individual.He Xinlu (1984). \\"The vertebrate fossils of Sichuan.\\" Sichuan Scientific and Technological Publishing House, Chengdu. 40: 1-168 Holtz et al. (2004) mentioned much more complete specimens, but they are undescribed. There have been doubts about the validity of Kaijiangosaurus. It has been suggested that it should be regarded as a junior synonym of Gasosaurus, which was found in the same strata as Kaijiangosaurus, the Lower Shaximiao Formation, or of Xuanhanosaurus. Description Kaijiangosaurus had a length of about five metres. He mentioned some diagnostic traits. The jugal is straight-edged at the front, deeper at the rear. The teeth are of the megalosaurid type. Their leading edge has only few serrations, near the tip. The cervicals are short, wide and narrow in the middle. The front cervicals have spines with a concave trailing edge. These neck vertebrae are about as wide as they are long; their spines are low and wide. The centra of the rear cervical are concave at their back; their spines are long and narrow. The dorsals are platycoelous and have smooth sides lacking pleurocoels. The front tail vertebrae are also platycoelous, with a flat front and concave rear; the rear caudals are amphicoelous. The tail vertebrae have flat undersides without a midline groove. The scapula is rather straight with only a relative constriction at the lower end and a light expansion at the upper end. The coracoid is oval and has a thick ridge at the upper outer side. With the humerus, the deltopectoral crest is triangular; the shaft has an oval cross-section. The ulna is short and expanded at both ends. The three claws of the hand are strongly curved. Both ends of the thighbone are expanded; the neck is somewhat directed to the rear. The lesser trochanter is low, with a triangular profile. The middle metatarsals are not fused, nor is the third metatarsal constricted at the top. Classification He originally placed Kaijiangosaurus in the Megalosauridae. Modern analysis suggests it is a basal member of the Tetanurae, or perhaps the Averostra.Carrano, M.T.; Benson, R.B.J.; & Sampson, S.D., 2012, \\"The phylogeny of Tetanurae (Dinosauria: Theropoda)\\", Journal of Systematic Palaeontology 10(2): 211‚Äì300 Due to the fragmentary nature of the remains, it is uncertain what type of tetanuran theropod it is, though it may be a primitive carnosaur.Holtz, Thomas R.

It was originally transmitted on Thursday 11 September 1969. Synopsis Lance Corporal Jones allows the platoon to use his butcher's van as an armoured car and Mainwaring meets the new Chief ARP Warden, William Hodges the greengrocer. Plot Following a lecture on the gases the enemy will use, Captain Mainwaring reads a communiqu√© sent by GHQ, which says that there is insufficient communication between the ARP and the Home Guard, so the new Chief Warden is attending to discuss co- operation. Mainwaring is disgusted to learn from Wilson that the new Chief Warden is that 'common fellow' Mr Hodges. Mainwaring believes that Hodges' occupation (a greengrocer) doesn't entitle him to be Chief Warden. Wilson agrees by saying that he has dirty finger nails. When Hodges arrives, he and Mainwaring have a brief argument about who should get the church hall every Wednesday evening. Some time afterwards, Walker talks to Jones about his delivery van. He reckons that he should lend it to Mainwaring as platoon transport. Jones is suspicious, so Walker admits that it will help his black market activities, but offers Jones petrol coupons in return. Jones reluctantly agrees. The next day, Mainwaring congratulates Jones and Walker on their efforts with the van. Jones tells Mainwaring that it not only serves as a troop carrier and armoured car, but it also serves as an ambulance. Wilson demonstrates with some of the platoon to Mainwaring, their new embarking and disembarking strategy, which interrupts Hodges' ARP lecture. He demands to know the reason why, and is intrigued to learn that the van doubles up as an ambulance. He asks the men to come down to Saturday's air raid practice and act as stretcher-bearers for the ambulance. Mainwaring concludes the lecture by telling Jones and Walker that the van is being converted to gas. Jones and Walker reluctantly travel to the church hall with a giant gas-bag on the roof. Jones' bayonet accidentally punctures the gas supply pipe and Jones and Walker succumb to the gas. When they recover, they learn that the gas bag is nearly empty. They reach the church hall to find it empty except for Frazer, who tells them that everyone's already at the practice. Frazer decides the gas fire of the Vicar (the Reverend Timothy Farthing) can be used to refill the gas bag. The Vicar interrupts, but Frazer passes it off as filling the Vicar's gas fire. The trio arrive at the practice, and they prepare to load an old man onto the back of the van, but Jones has left the keys at his shop. They attempt to put the old man through the window of the van, while Jones 'borrows' an irate man's bike to fetch the keys. When he returns, they prepare to load the old man into the van, but it drives off before they can fully load him on. After two unsuccessful attempts, the old man gets up off the stretcher, declaring \\"I'll walk to the flippin' hospital!\\" Cast *Arthur Lowe as Captain Mainwaring *John Le Mesurier as Sergeant Wilson *Clive Dunn as Lance Corporal Jones *John Laurie as Private Frazer *James Beck as Private Walker *Arnold Ridley as Private Godfrey *Ian Lavender as Private Pike *Janet Davies as Mrs. Pike *Bill Pertwee as ARP Warden Hodges *Frank Williams as Vicar *Queenie Watts as Mrs Peters *Pamela Cundell as Mrs Fox *Jean St. Clair as Miss Meadows *Olive Mercer as Mrs Casson *Nigel Hawthorne as Angry man *Harold Bennett as Old man *Dick Haydon as Raymond Notes #This episode was the first to feature Reverend Timothy Farthing in person #The old man on the stretcher is Mr Blewitt, as established in later episodes in a semi-regular role #ARP Warden Hodges wants the church hall every Wednesday evening in this episode. #This is the first episode to feature Bill Pertwee as Chief ARP Warden Hodges. #This is the first episode to feature Jones allowing the platoon to use his van. #This is the first colour episode.

The junction in Koluszki serves trains that go from Warsaw to ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Wroc≈Çaw, Czƒôstochowa and Katowice. It is also connected to Radom and Lublin by an eastbound line. History Koluszki was first mentioned in 1399, when it was part of the Jagiellonian-ruled Kingdom of Poland. In the 14th and 15th century, it prospered along the trade route between Gda≈Ñsk and Ruthenia. By 1790, there was a grist mill, sawmill, brewery, and inn. Under the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, the settlement was annexed by Prussia. It was regained by Poles and included in the short-lived Duchy of Warsaw in 1807, and afterwards it became part of Congress Poland following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, later forcibly integrated into Russia. On September 2, 1846, the settlement was first connected to the emerging Polish railways as part of the mainline between Warsaw and Krak√≥w. Following the development of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ as an industrial center, Koluszki served as the junction for its rail. By 1900, about half of the settlement worked for the railway in some capacity and the settlement developed around the railway and bus stations. After World War I Poland regained independence, and Koluszki was reintegrated with the reborn state. The town suffered during both world wars. =World War II= On 1-5 September, 1939, in the first days of the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the German Luftwaffe raided Koluszki multiple times. On September 1-3, many inhabitants fled, and Polish anti-aircraft artillery shot down six German planes. On September 6, the Germans entered Koluszki and the occupation began, Koluszki was annexed directly to Germany and its population was subjected to various repressions, including mass arrests, deportations to Nazi concentration camps and murder. Mass arrests of Polish intelligentsia, including teachers, were carried out on November 9, 1939 as part of the Intelligenzaktion.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939. Operacja niemieckiej policji bezpiecze≈Ñstwa w Polsce. Intelligenzaktion, IPN, Warszawa, 2009, p. 250 (in Polish) Nevertheless, it was a local center of the Polish resistance movement, and Polish partisans were active in the area. The Germans established a Jewish ghetto in April 1941. Hundreds of Jews from around the area were sent to the Koluszki ghetto so that the pre-war Jewish population of about 500 swelled to over 3000. Living conditions were horrific with up to ten people living in each room and others living in the streets or in attics. Hunger and typhus epidemics killed many. In October 1942, the Gestapo and German and Polish police rounded up the ghetto population. A few dozen escaped, as many as 500 were murdered in Koluszki, and the rest were loaded on a train for Treblinka. There they were immediately gassed. There were a few survivors of unknown numbers among Koluszki's Jewish population. Several Christian Poles helped a few Jews hide, and three, the Krzyzanowski family, were recognized after the war as Righteous Among the Nations for hiding six Jews. The town was restored to Poland by the Red Army on January 18, 1945. Its town charter was established in 1949.

By the time of the Chernobyl disaster on 26 April 1986, Legasov was the first deputy director of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy. He became a key member of the government commission formed to investigate the causes of the disaster and to plan the mitigation of its consequences. He took many important actions to avoid repeat accidents and informed the government of the situation in the disaster area. He did not hesitate to speak to his fellow scientists and to the press about the safety risks of the destroyed plant and insisted on the immediate evacuation of the entire population of the city of Pripyat nearby. In August 1986, he presented the report of the Soviet delegation at the special meeting of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. His report displayed a depth of analysis and honesty in discussing the extent and consequences of the tragedy. English translation1: Legasov recorded five audio tapes where he expressed his point of view on events that happened in Chernobyl. The fifth and last tape was recorded with Ales Adamovich as an interview for an article.  Death  The grave of Professor Valery Legasov at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. On 26 April 1988, The day of the second anniversary of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident and one day before he was due to announce his results of the investigation into the causes of the disaster, Legasov hanged himself (some sources say in his apartment or the stairwell of his apartment; others in his office). A personal pistol remained in a drawer, but the professor chose to hang himself. He was buried at the Novodevichy cemetery in Moscow. This was not Legasov's first suicide attempt. David R. Marples has suggested that the adversity of the Chernobyl disaster on Legasov's psychological state was the factor that led to his decision to die by suicide. Before his suicide, Legasov wrote documents revealing previously undisclosed facts about the catastrophe. According to an analysis of the recording for the BBC TV movie Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster, Legasov claims political pressure censored the mention of Soviet nuclear secrecy in his report to the IAEA, a secrecy which forbade even plant operators having knowledge of previous accidents and known problems with reactor design. The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists also stated that Legasov had become bitterly disillusioned with the failure of the authorities to confront the design flaws. Aftermath Legasov's suicide caused shockwaves in the Soviet nuclear industry. In particular, the problem with the design of the control rods in Chernobyl-type RBMK reactors was rapidly admitted and addressed. On 20 September 1996, then-Russian president Boris Yeltsin posthumously conferred on Legasov the honorary title of Hero of the Russian Federation, the country's highest honorary title, for the \\"courage and heroism\\" shown in his investigation of the disaster.  In media Legasov is portrayed by Ade Edmondson in the BBC docudrama Surviving Disaster (2006), by Adam Curtis in his documentary series Pandora's Box (1992), and by Jared Harris in the Sky/HBO miniseries Chernobyl (2019).

They are former WWE Tag Team Champions and World Tag Team Champions. Their 2006-2007 reign as WWE Tag Team Champions was the longest in the title's history until their record was broken by The New Day on July 20, 2016, and is still the longest reign by a duo. They first began teaming together in 2003 as a part of WWE, but Kendrick left the company shortly thereafter. When he returned in mid-2005, he and London reunited as a tag team. In May 2006 the duo won the WWE Tag Team Championship from MNM; it was Kendrick's first title victory with the company, and London's third. Their reign was the longest since WWE created the title in 2002, and they became the fourth longest-reigning tag team champions in the company's history, finally dropping the titles to Deuce 'n Domino in April 2007. Later in 2007, London and Kendrick were drafted from SmackDown to the Raw brand, where they briefly held the World Tag Team Championship. They would continue to work together until Kendrick was drafted back to SmackDown in the 2008 supplemental draft, thus disbanding the team until 2010, when they reunited in Pro Wrestling Guerrilla following their releases from WWE. They have since competed together on the independent circuit on several occasions, notably winning the ICW Tag Team Championship as The Hooligans. History =Name= The team never had an official team name, but were just referred to as \\"the tag team of London and Kendrick.\\" In 2006 London and Kendrick put the tag team name \\"The Hooliganz\\" on their wrestling attires and tried to convince the WWE management to start calling the team by that name, but were unsuccessful in their attempts. =Beginnings= Prior to teaming together on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)'s SmackDown! brand, both Paul London and Brian \\"Spanky\\" Kendrick along with Daniel Bryan were students at Shawn Michaels' Texas Wrestling Academy, under the tutelage of Rudy Boy Gonzalez. From there they both went on to Ring of Honor, where they occasionally competed against each other and as a team. =World Wrestling Entertainment= Formation (2003‚Äì2004) In late 2002, Kendrick was hired by WWE, and in July 2003 London joined the company as well. Once in WWE together, and both on the SmackDown! brand, London and Kendrick began teaming together. They became a mainstay on SmackDown (WWE brand)'s sister show Velocity until Kendrick left the company in February 2004.  WWE Tag Team Champions (2005-2007)  Kendrick returned in mid-2005, using his real name, and in September 2005 London and Kendrick reformed as a tag team. Upon reuniting the team began competing in matching shorts and vests as well as wearing theatrical masks to the ring. Subsequently, they were quickly elevated into the WWE Tag Team Championship picture, receiving a non-title match against WWE Tag Team Champions MNM (Johnny Nitro and Joey Mercury) on the February 10, 2006 episode of SmackDown!, which London and Kendrick lost. On the April 7, 2006 episode of SmackDown! London and Kendrick once again faced MNM, this time picking up a win in a non-title match. London and Kendrick continued their winning streak against the champions, earning singles victories for Kendrick and London over Nitro and Mercury respectively, leading to a title match at Judgment Day, where London and Kendrick won their first WWE Tag Team Championship as a team (London's second WWE Tag Team Title reign and Kendrick's first championship in WWE). Kendrick during the team's ring entrance Their first main competition for the titles came when K. C. James and Idol Stevens defeated London and Kendrick in a non-title match, in early August, igniting a storyline feud between the two teams. During the rivalry, WWE Diva Ashley Massaro began accompanying London and Kendrick to the ring, acting as a valet to the team while combating the actions of James and Stevens' manager Michelle McCool. On October 14, 2006 they became the longest reigning WWE Tag Team Champions of all time, surpassing MNM's previous record reign of 145 days. The record stood until it was broken by The New Day in July 2016. The team began a losing streak to the team of William Regal and Dave Taylor, with Regal defeating both London and Kendrick in singles matches and losing a non-title tag team match to the pair on the December 8 episode of SmackDown!. A scheduled title match between the two teams at Armageddon was changed at the event to a four-way ladder match, also involving The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) and MNM. In the match London and Kendrick were able to retrieve the belts to retain their championship. When a regular tag team rematch was signed with Regal and Taylor two weeks later, London and Kendrick were successful in defeating them. On the February 16 episode of SmackDown!, General Manager Theodore Long scheduled another ladder match between the teams of London and Kendrick, Regal and Taylor, MNM, and The Hardys for the WWE Tag Team Championship at February's pay-per-view event No Way Out, but WWE's official website announced the match had changed to pit The Hardys and Chris Benoit against MNM and MVP, while London and Kendrick faced rookie team Deuce 'n Domino (Deuce and Domino) in a separate match; they were booked to successfully retain the titles against Deuce 'n Domino. Their almost year-long reign came to an end when they were defeated by Deuce 'n Domino for the title on the April 20, 2007 episode of SmackDown! in Milan, Italy. London picked up an injury, resulting in Kendrick challenging Deuce 'n Domino in singles matches, losing to Deuce, but defeating Domino. London returned on the May 11 episode of SmackDown!, defeating Domino in a singles match. London and Kendrick then unsuccessfully attempted to regain the Tag Team Championship, losing to Deuce 'n Domino in a triple threat match also involving Regal and Taylor, and in a standard tag team match two weeks later. World Tag Team Championship pursuit (2007-2008) London and Kendrick were drafted to Raw as the first picks in the WWE Supplemental Draft on June 17, 2007 and were successful on their Raw debut, defeating The World's Greatest Tag Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) via a Sliced Bread #2 performed on Haas. On the September 3 episode of Raw, London and Kendrick defeated The World's Greatest Tag Team once again to earn a World Tag Team Championship match at Unforgiven against Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, in which they lost. Two days later, they defeated Cade and Murdoch for the title at a house show in South Africa. Three days later, at another house show, Cade and Murdoch regained the title in a rematch. Near the end of 2007, London suffered a foot injury and was unable to compete, and Kendrick was mainly used as a singles wrestler on Raw where he lost to the likes of Umaga and Mr. Kennedy. London made his return on February 4 in a loss to Santino Marella and Carlito. London and Kendrick returned as a tag team on the March 17 episode of Raw in a loss to Umaga when Kendrick walked out on London. The two reunited on Raw on March 31 with commentator Jim Ross explaining the two worked out their differences, and they got a win against the then-World Tag Team Champions, Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly. On April 14, they lost a number one contendership match to the team of Carlito and Marella. They competed sporadically on Raw in the following months, defeating Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, before receiving a World Tag Team title shot against Holly and Rhodes on the May 26 episode of Raw. They lost when Holly pinned London following an Alabama slam. Split and aftermath (2008) The team came to an end in June 2008, when Kendrick was drafted to the SmackDown brand as part of the 2008 Supplemental Draft, while London stayed on Raw. He made his return to the brand on the July 18, 2008 airing of SmackDown! as a heel, with new ring attire defeating Jimmy Wang Yang with the help of his new bodyguard, Ezekiel Jackson. Kendrick was later given the name \\"The Brian Kendrick\\". London was utilized sparingly during the next few months, making his only television appearance in a loss to Lance Cade on the July 21 episode of Raw. London was subsequently released from his WWE contract on November 7, 2008. On July 31, 2009, Kendrick was also released. =Independent circuit (2010‚Äì2014)= Going into 2010, the team made occasional reunions on the independent circuit. On January 30 the team completed at Pro Wrestling Guerrilla's part of the aptly titled WrestleReunion 4 show. They defeated the PWG World Tag Team Champions Generation Me (Jeremy and Max) in a non-title match in their first match back together. On March 27, London and Kendrick made an appearance in Dragon Gate USA, where Kendrick had already appeared in singles competition. However, their run as a tag team in the company was short-lived due to losing a Pinfall Loser Leaves Company match to Jimmy Jacobs and Jack Evans and as a result Kendrick, who tapped out to Jacobs, was forced to leave the company for good.London and Kendrick on the independent circuit at a May 2015 Hoodslam event. They reunited once again on October 4, 2012, at the first Family Wrestling Entertainment's PPV, Back 2 Brooklyn. They, along with Jay Lethal, defeated the team of The Young Bucks and Petey Williams.http://www.cagematch.de/?id=1&nr;=84415 London and Kendrick defeated The Young Bucks when they wrestled again on October 6, 2012, at the House of Hardcore's first show. On June 23, 2013, London and Kendrick were defeated by The Young Buck at House of Hardcore 2. London and Kendrick were defeated at PWG's Ten by Chuck Taylor and Johnny Gargano. In 2014, London and Kendrick traveled to Scotland to compete for Insane Championship Wrestling. On October 15, the pair won the ICW Tag Team Championship by defeating The New Age Kliq (BT Gunn and Chris Renfrew) at Helter Skelter. On November 2, 2014, they lost the title to Polo Promotions (Mark Coffey and Jackie Polo) In Glasgow, Scotland. In 2014, Kendrick returned to WWE, thus separating with London.

He is best known for his satirical spoofs of popular films, including the Star Wars parody Hardware Wars. Film career Fosselius' film career began in the early 1970s when he co-created 20 original animated films for Sesame Street. Fosselius is known for his satirical short films. The first appeared in 1976 in Mother's Little Network, a Pythonesque sketch comedy show for WGBH-TV in Boston, was The Hindenburger, in which a flying Big Mac burst into flames over New Jersey while a radio announcer (voiced by Fosselius) emotionally sobbed: \\"Oh, the humanity, Oh, the cheese!\\" Porklips Now was a send-up of Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now which starred Billy Gray of TV's Father Knows Best. Fosselius was hired by Universal Studios to develop comedy screenplays. After working for many months on a script entitled Two Guys from Space, the studio pulled the plug on the project and offered him the directing job on Pee-wee's Big Adventure as a consolation. Fosselius passed on it and went back to Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, where he made his living as a sound effects and foley editor on many feature films including Ed Wood, Serial Mom, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, and Amadeus. Fosselius continued to write screenplays (11 scripts that never went into production, including the Zippy the Pinhead movie) and work in the movie business as a director of \\"industrial\\" shorts, a special effects fabricator (including for RoboCop 2), an actor, sound editor, and voice actor. Ben Burtt asked Fosselius to contribute unusual voices and vocal effects to several Lucasfilm productions, such as the two pilots in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. He provided the voice of Poggle the Lesser in Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones and voiced the sobs of the Rancor Keepers, Malakili and Giran, in Return of the Jedi. He also contributed to the music score of Return of the Jedi and is credited with co- writing the song \\"Lapti Nek\\". Additionally, he voiced the \\"Ack Ack\\"s in Mars Attacks! and was also the voice of Trantor the Troll in Ernest Scared Stupid. Fosselius directed the Eegah episode of Cinema Insomnia with Mr. Lobo and, staying true to his directing technique, also created many of the props. In 2009, Fosselius created a tribute to Ed Wood with his short film, Plan 9.1 from Outer Space, which featured hand-carved wooden puppets of the characters from Ed Wood's film, Plan 9 from Outer Space. The puppets acted out the scenes along with the edited soundtrack of the original film. =Hardware Wars= Fosselius' biggest hit was his 1978 parody Hardware Wars, a 12-minute parody of Hollywood coming attractions that took on the cultural juggernaut that was Star Wars. Complete with cardboard sets and visible wires holding up ships which were various household appliances, the film was shot over 4 days with a budget of around $8,000. When released, the film became a hit on its own, grossing close to three million dollars over its lifetime, making it one of the most popular and profitable short films of all time, but Fosselius netted very little of that profit. In later years, George Lucas called it his favorite Star Wars parody. Fosselius was honored by Lucasfilm when Hardware Wars was given the Pioneer Award at the 2003 Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards. When Hardware Wars was re-released in 1997 with new special effects in a \\"Special Edition\\" to spoof the special editions of the original Star Wars trilogy, Fosselius was not involved, as he disagreed with the concept of adding actual digital effects to a film which satirized digital effects, and asked that a \\"Not Approved by Ernie\\" label be added to the release. The film was finally released on DVD in its original form in 2002, Fosselius did participate, restoring the original stereo soundtrack, adding additional material and original outtakes, and recording a director's commentary that itself was a parody, poking fun at similarly self-indulgent tracks. However, Fosselius was reportedly flummoxed by the technicians who performed the telecine transfer and who made attempts to digitally remove the strings and wires and clean up the print, not realizing that the \\"defects\\" in the original were put there on purpose. Fosselius later teamed up with Apprehensive Films to release a 30th-anniversary DVD. Musical career In the mid-sixties Fosselius performed with the San Francisco band Earth Mother and the Final Solution. He was also a founding member of the band The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, for whom he wrote the song \\"Hipsters on Parade\\". Other works Fosselius has continued to whittle mechanically animated carved caricatures and automata which he displays in traveling galleries called the \\"Marvelous Mechalodeon\\" and the \\"Crankabout Mechanical Theater\\", an entirely human powered exhibit. Fosselius was contracted by Earl Vickers of Atari to do the voices for the video arcade game Gauntlet.

(2011). \\"Recent advances on study of hadrosaurid dinosaurs in Heilongjiang (Amur) River area between China and Russia.\\" Global Geology, 2011(3). It is based on bonebed material including skull remains indicating that it was related to Saurolophus and Prosaurolophus. History In 1984, Yuri Bolotsky and the Amur Complex Integrated Research Institute discovered a large dinosaur bonebed at Blagoveschensk. Most of the remains were of Amurosaurus (a lambeosaurine hadrosaur), but some came from turtles, crocodilians, theropods, nodosaurids, and a new hadrosaurine. For the hadrosaurine, cranial material (holotype AENM 1/319, braincase, plus others) was distinctive enough to permit the naming of a new genus. Kerberosaurus manakini would be described twenty years later. Description Diagnostic characters included narrow frontals, unique form of the braincase, and a well- demarcated division between the area of bone surrounding the nostrils and the bone outside of it. No reconstruction of the fragmentary partial skull was offered. In their cladistic analysis, the authors found Kerberosaurus to be the sister taxon to Saurolophus and Prosaurolophus. It's been estimated to be around 8 meters (26 ft) in length. Paleobiogeography Bolotsky and Godefroit (2004) found the paleobiogeographic implications interesting. The relationship they described provides additional support for land links and faunal interchange between eastern Asia and North America at the end of the Cretaceous, as the other two genera are either known only in North America or are known from a species there. The \\"sauroloph\\" group would have had to split from the nest closest group, the \\"edmontosaur\\" group, in the early Campanian, from Asia, and moved west while leaving a splinter population that would lead to Kerberosaurus, then return to Asia at a later point and produce Saurolophus angustirostris. Paleobiology As a hadrosaurid, Kerberosaurus would have been a large bipedal\\\\quadrupedal herbivore, consuming plant matter with complex dental batteries.

It was founded in 1839 and is the oldest of the seven dioceses comprising the Ecclesiastical Province of Ontario. It has the most members of any Anglican diocese in Canada. It is also one of the biggest Anglican dioceses in the Americas in terms of numbers of parishioners, clergy and parishes. As of 2018, the diocese has around 230 congregations and ministries in 183 parishes, with approximately 54,000 Anglicans identified on parish rolls. In 1839, the area of the current Diocese of Toronto made up a fifth of what was then known as the Diocese of Upper Canada, which also comprised the current Dioceses of Huron, Ontario, Algoma and Niagara, which were respectively set apart in 1857, 1861, 1873 and 1875. The Cathedral Church of St. James in Toronto is the centre of the Diocese of Toronto. The church originated as The English Church when it was first erected in 1803. It later became the seat of the Anglican bishop and was reconsecrated as the Cathedral Church of St. James in 1830. The church remained under the direction of John Strachan for most of the early nineteenth century. He was buried on the cathedral grounds in 1867. Bishops The diocese's first bishop was John Strachan, who became the Bishop of Toronto in 1839, after being ordained in the Anglican Church in 1803 and becoming the Archdeacon of York in 1827. In 1848, Alexander Neil Bethune was Archdeacon of York and George O'Kill Stuart Archdeacon of Kingston.The Clergy List for 1848 p. 279 By 1866, York was listed as the sole archdeaconry.The Clergy List for 1866 (London: George Cox, 1866) p. 443 The current Bishop of Toronto is Andrew Asbil, who is assisted by four suffragan bishops, styled \\"area bishops\\", each with oversight of a geographical region of the diocese. The episcopal areas and their respective suffragan/area bishops are: *Bishop of York-Simcoe ‚Äì Peter Fenty *Bishop of Trent-Durham ‚Äì Riscylla Shaw *Bishop of York- Scarborough ‚Äì Kevin Robertson *Bishop of York-Credit Valley ‚Äì Jenny Andison Each episcopal area has its own bishop and some have an archdeacon, although all function with delegated authority of the diocesan bishop, who retains jurisdiction for the whole diocese. Linda Nicholls was elected Suffragan Bishop of Toronto on the third ballot at an electoral synod on November 17, 2007, at St. Paul's Bloor Street. She was consecrated on February 2, 2008, at the Cathedral Church of St. James, becoming the third female Anglican bishop in the Diocese of Toronto and the fourth in the Anglican Church in Canada. She became diocesan Bishop of Huron in 2016, and was elected the first female Primate of the Anglican Church of Canada in 2019. The first two women consecrated as bishops in the Anglican Church of Canada also served as suffragan bishops of Toronto: first, Victoria Matthews, elected in 1994 (for the Credit Valley area), translated to the Diocese of Edmonton as diocesan bishop in 1997 (and then became Bishop of Christchurch, New Zealand until April 2018); and second, Ann Tottenham, elected in 1997, retired in 2005, and later served as an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Niagara. In September 2016, three new suffragan bishops were elected: Shaw is M√©tis, and Robertson is the first openly gay and partnered bishop to be elected in Canada. The three new bishops were consecrated on January 7, 2017. Parishes As of 2018, the Diocese of Toronto has around 230 congregations and ministries in 183 parishes. A few of these include: *All Saints, King City *Church of the Epiphany and St. Mark, Parkdale *Church of St. Mary Magdalene *Church of The Messiah *Church of the Holy Trinity *Church of the Redeemer *Grace Church on the Hill *Little Trinity Anglican Church *St. Matthias Bellwoods *St. Paul's, Bloor Street *St. Thomas's Anglican Church *St. James on-the-Lines, Penetanguishene The cathedral of the diocese is the Cathedral Church of St. James in Toronto.

Overview  The bus was transporting between 80 and 90 trade union delegates to May Day celebrations in the town of QwaQwa in the Free State. The driver of the bus became disorientated when they passed through Bethlehem in the dark, en route to the celebrations. Hopelessly lost, he appears to have turned accidentally onto an unlit gravel path, which led straight onto a jetty into the Saulspoort reservoir. The driver was apparently travelling much too fast to stop when the bus drove straight into the water. The remote location of the accident, combined with the old bus's inadequate safety provisions meant that just ten people escaped the vehicle alive, all of them injured in the crash. The bus sank rapidly following impact with the water, and 80 people were dragged down with it, trapped inside the vehicle. Police did not arrive until the following morning after being notified by survivors, but were only able to recover the bodies of the dead and retrieve the bus as part of their investigation of the tragedy.  Aftermath  President Thabo Mbeki held a minute's silence for the dead at his May Day speech the following day, and the dead were buried together in a mass funeral at West End (Wes einde) cemetery in Kimberley. The cause of the crash was believed to be negligence on the driver's part, in his failure to prepare a route through a hazardous area, which was compounded by a lack of signs and gates on the dam's access roads. The bus too was an old model, and did not possess efficient emergency exits or safety equipment, as well as suffering from poor brakes, which may have contributed to the disaster. The dam was renamed the Sol Plaatje Dam on 1 April 2005. Sol Plaatje Dam, Bethlehem, South Africa Leonard Slabbert, who used a boat to rescue the survivors, was awarded the Mendi Decoration for Bravery (since renamed Order of Mendi for Bravery) (Silver) on 30 November 2003.Honours for unsung heroes  See also  * List of road accidents References  External links  * Guardian News Report * SMH News Report * News Report on Aftermath Category:Bus accidents in South Africa Category:2003 road incidents Category:2003 in South Africa Category:Road incidents in South Africa ","title":"Bethlehem bus crash"},{"id":"4857477","text":"V√•vatnet is a lake in Orkland Municipality in Tr√∏ndelag county, Norway.

Members of the Ferroplasma are typically acidophillic, pleomorphic, irregularly shaped cocci. The archaean family Ferroplasmaceae was first described in the early 2000s. To date very few species of Ferroplasma have been isolated and characterized. Isolated species include Ferroplasma acidiphilum, Ferroplasma acidarmanus, and Ferroplasma thermophilum. A fourth isolate Ferroplasma cupricumulans was later determined to belong to a separate genus. All known Ferroplasma sp. are iron-oxidizers.  Cell characteristics and Physiology  Ferroplasma cells are pleomorphic and lack a cell-wall. All known members of the genera are acidophiles that thrive in environments where pH ranges from 0.0 to 2.0. They are also mesophilic to moderately thermophilic with optimal temperatures ranging from 35-55 ¬∞C. Tetraether-based lipids are an important part of the Ferroplasma cellular membrane and allow cells to maintain a pH gradient. A study of F. acidarmanus found that cytoplasmic pH was maintained ~5.6 while the environmental pH ranged from ~0-1.2. Variations in the tetraether lipids of the family Ferroplasmaceae are used for chemotaxonomic identification at the genus and species level because many members possess identical 16S rRNA sequences. Members of the genus Ferroplasma are chemomixotrophs that can oxidize ferrous iron to acquire energy, but despite evidence of carbon fixation, lab cultures often require an organic carbon source such as yeast extract for growth. In the absence of iron, some lab-grown strains have been capable of chemoorganotrophic growth.  Ecological Importance  Iron is the fourth most abundant mineral in earth's crust. As iron-oxidizers Ferroplasma sp. participate in the biogeochemical of iron. Ferroplasma sp. are often identified at acid mine drainage (AMD) sites. When ferrous iron (Fe2+) is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe3+) at mine sites, Fe3+ spontaneously reacts with water and iron-sulfur compounds like pyrite to produce sulfate and hydrogen ions. During this reaction ferrous iron, which can be utilized by Ferroplasma, is also regenerated leading to a \\"propagation cycle\\" where pH is lowered. The reaction can be described by the following equation: FeS2 + 14Fe^3+ + 8H2O-> 15Fe^2+ + 2SO4^2- + 16H+ Ferroplasma species are often present at AMD sites where they participate in this cycle through the biotic oxidation of ferrous iron. Ferroplasma sp. may have important applications for bioleaching metals. Microbial bioleaching occurs naturally in the highly acidic environments that are home to Ferroplasma sp. Harnessing the power of bioleaching to recover metal from low quality ores and waste material is energetically advantageous compared to smelting and purifying. It also produces fewer toxic byproducts. Studies have shown that the inclusion of Ferroplasma thermophilum along with the bacteria Acidithiobacillus caldus and Leptospirillum ferriphilum can bioaugment the leaching process of chalcopyrite and increase the rate at which copper is recovered.  Isolated Species  = Ferroplasma acidiphilum = Ferroplasma acidiphilum has been shown to grow as a chemomixotroph and to grow synergistically with the acidophilic bacteria Leptospirillum ferriphilum. The strain Ferroplasma acidiphilum YT is a facultative anaerobe with all the required genes for arginine fermentation. Although it is unclear whether Ferroplasma acidiphilum YT uses its arginine fermentation pathway, the pathway itself is an ancient metabolism that traces back to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of the three domains of life. = Ferroplasma acidarmanus = Ferroplasma acidarmanus Fer1 was isolated from mine samples collected at Iron Mountain, California. Iron Mountain (CA) is a former mine that is known for its acid mine drainage (AMD) and heavy metal contamination. In addition to being acidophilic, F. acidarmanus Fer1 is highly resistant to both copper and arsenic. = Ferroplasma cupricumulans (formerly Ferroplasma cyprexacervatum) = In 2006 Ferroplasma cupricumulans was isolated from leachate solution collected from the Myanmar Ivanhoe Copper company (MICCL) mining site in Myanmar. It was noted to be the first slightly thermophilic member of the genus Ferroplasma. However, in 2009 a new genus of acidophilic, thermophilic archaea, Acidiplasma, was identified. It was proposed that, based on 16S rRNA similarity and DNA-DNA hybridization, be transferred to the genus Acidiplasma and renamed Acidiplasma cupricumulans. = Ferroplasma thermophilum = In 2008, Zhou, et al. described the isolation of the organism Ferroplasma thermophilum L1T from a chalcopyrite column reactor that was inocculated with acid mine drainage (AMD) from the Daye copper mine in China‚Äôs Hubei province. In aerobic conditions with low concentrations of yeast extract F. thermophilum grows by oxidizing ferrous iron. However, in anaerobic conditions F. thermophilum reduces ferric iron and sulfate. This makes F. thermophilum ecologically important for iron and sulfur cycling at pyrite-rich mine sites.

The type species is Klamelisaurus gobiensis, which was named by Zhao Xijin in 1993, based on a partial skeleton discovered in 1982 near the abandoned town of Jiangjunmiao. Zhao described Klamelisaurus as the only member of a new subfamily, Klamelisauridae, among the now-defunct primitive sauropod order Bothrosauropodoidea. Since Zhao's description, Klamelisaurus received limited attention from researchers until Andrew Moore and colleagues redescribed it in 2020. A relatively large sauropod measuring approximately long, with half of the length being its neck, Klamelisaurus can be distinguished from its relatives by characteristics of the and . Phylogenetic analyses have suggested that Klamelisaurus belonged to the Mamenchisauridae, a group of Middle to Late Jurassic and primarily Chinese sauropods, although its close relatives also include a mamenchisaurid from Thailand. While paleontologist Gregory S. Paul suggested that Bellusaurus, known only from juvenile specimens, was a juvenile Klamelisaurus, this proposal has been rejected based on anatomical evidence, and the fact that Bellusaurus was geologically younger. Discovery and naming Cast of the holotype skeleton Between 1981 and 1985, a field crew from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) conducted excavations in the Junggar Basin of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of China, as part of a research project titled \\"Evolution of the Junggar Basin and the Formation of Petroleum\\". The work was conducted in cooperation with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Xinjiang Office of Petroleum. In 1982, these excavations uncovered the skeleton of a sauropod dinosaur north of the now-abandoned town of Jiangjunmiao, located in the eastern Junggar Basin. The skeleton was excavated and collected in 1984 by the IVPP field team. The specimen, which was catalogued under the specimen number IVPP V9492, consists of teeth, most of the vertebral column (save for the first seven (neck vertebrae) and the end of the tail), , the right shoulder girdle and arm (, , , , , and ), and the right hip girdle and leg (, , , , , and ). At the time of its discovery, the specimen was already weathered. After it was transported to Beijing, with preparation and restoration work beginning in 1985, it deteriorated further due to fluctuations in temperature and humidity. Nearly all of the bones underwent reconstruction and painting, and many of them were encased in a metal armature for display. The referral of the fragmentary teeth to the specimen was unexplained, and they can no longer be located along with two ribs, two of the wrist, a of the ankle, and some bones of the tail. They also located several four (from the underside of the tail), the bottom end of the left femur, and parts of the left hand that were not mentioned by Zhao. In 1993, Xijing Zhao described IVPP V9492 as the type specimen of a new genus and species, Klamelisaurus gobiensis. Due to the condition of the specimen, he only conducted a \\"simple description\\". The generic name Klamelisaurus refers to the Kelameili Mountains to the north of Jiangjunmiao, of which \\"Klameli\\" is a variant spelling. The specific name gobiensis refers to the Gobi Desert, in which Jiangjunmiao is located. Following Zhao's description, IVPP V9492 received limited attention in the literature until it was redescribed by Andrew Moore and colleagues in 2020. They noted that the specimen's reconstruction had been altered since Zhao's description, namely by the addition of a frontward-projecting process on the 15th and the removal of a fabricated connection to the (vertebral body). Description Artist impression of Klamelisaurus in a conifer forest Klamelisaurus was described as a \\"relatively large\\" sauropod by Zhao in 1993. In 2016, American paleontologist Gregory S. Paul estimated its length at in length and in weight, albeit based on the hypothesis that Klamelisaurus represented the adult form of Bellusaurus. In 2020, Moore and colleagues listed a number of characteristics (following a 2013 study by Michael Taylor and Mathew Wedel) which identified the type specimen as an adult: the lack of unfused sutures in the vertebral centra; the fusion of the (hip vertebrae), the fusion of the cervical ribs to their corresponding centra; and the fusion of the scapula and coracoid in the shoulder. =Vertebrae= Zhao stated that the type specimen of Klamelisaurus preserved nine cervicals (neck vertebrae), out of an estimated total of sixteen with a total length of . Moore and colleagues concurred with the number of cervicals, but they noted that the tenth preserved vertebra shows characteristics of both cervicals and (back vertebae). They estimated a total of fifteen to seventeen cervicals, based on other sauropods with similar patterns of vertebral variation, and indicated that Klamelisaurus had a shorter neck than Omeisaurus tianfuensis, Mamenchisaurus hochuanensis, and M. sinocanadorum. Zhao's original diagnosis or list of distinguishing characteristics (which have been reassessed as being widespread among sauropods) noted that the cervicals were (with centra convex in front and concave behind); had centra 1.5 to 2 times the length of the dorsal centra; and had tall , which were bifid (two-pronged) at the back of the neck. Moore and colleagues noted two unique features (autapomorphies) in the cervicals. First, the spinoprezygapophyseal (SPRLs), ridges of bone extending forward from the neural spines, bore irregular, plate-like extensions. Second, below the SPRLs and in front of depressions called the spinodiapophyseal (SDFs), the sides of the centra bore a set of deep (openings). Although these foramina were present only on the right side of the centra, Moore and colleagues considered them to be unique due to their consistency and the presence of similar structures in other sauropods. A number of sauropods possess laminae or struts that cross the SDFs in their cervical vertebrae, linking the projecting from the back of the vertebrae to the extending from the front of the vertebrae. These include Euhelopus (where it is a distinguishing characteristic) and Nigersaurus; this structure has been named the \\"epipophyseal-prezygapophyseal lamina\\" (EPRL). Moore and colleagues considered two structures in Klamelisaurus to potentially correspond to the EPRL: extensions of the epipophyses that invade the SDFs from the rear, and isolated struts in the middle of the SDFs. Similar structures in Uberabatitan had previously been considered as evidence of a \\"segmented EPRL\\". However, for Klamelisaurus, Moore and colleagues interpreted the former to be an attachment for the intercristal muscles of the neck, based on the surface texture and comparisons with ostriches, while they considered the latter to be a pneumatic structure created by . Thus, they argued that previous literature had conflated distinct and diverse muscular and pneumatic structures as components of the EPRL. Moore and colleagues identified twelve dorsals and six sacrals in the type specimen of Klamelisaurus. (Zhao previously identified the first sacral of Moore and colleagues as the last dorsal, giving thirteen dorsals and five sacrals.) Although sacral vertebrae are usually identified by contact with the ilium, these bones are not in association in the type specimen. Instead, Moore and colleagues noted a bridge of bone connecting the and (processes on the side of the vertebra), which was either fused to the lost sacral rib (as in other sauropods) or was not associated with a rib at all. Zhao's diagnosis noted that the dorsals were opisthocoelous; the dorsals had shallow (neurovascular openings) and simple lamination (ridging); the dorsal neural spines were low, with the first few being bifid and the last few having expanded tips; the sacral centra were fused such that their boundaries were not visible; and the first four sacral neural spines were fused. Moore and colleagues identified two unique features in the dorsals. First, the sides of some of the dorsals bore sets of three posterior centroparapophyseal laminae (PCPLs). Second, the spinodiapophyseal laminae (SPDLs) on the sides of the neural spines were bifurcated in the middle and rear dorsals, but unlike Bellusaurus the two prongs did not reach the SPRLs or the SPOLs (spinopostzygapophyseal laminae, the rear counterparts of the SPRLs). Parts of nineteen (tail vertebrae) were found by Moore and colleagues: parts of the first four caudals (labelled as caudals 1‚Äì4), five more neural spines from the front of the tail (labelled as caudals 6 and 8‚Äì11), and eleven centra from the middle of the tail (labelled as caudals 18‚Äì27 and 33). Zhao originally counted two complete caudals, ten neural spines from the front, and ten middle centra, based on which he estimated that sixty were originally present with a total length of . Zhao's list of characteristics indicated that the first few caudals were (with centra concave in front and convex behind), with the rest being (with centra concave on both ends); and the caudal neural spines were claviform (thicker at the tip) and slanted extremely to the rear. Characteristics of the caudals that differentiate Klamelisaurus from Tienshanosaurus include the procoelous front caudals, and the front edge of the tip of the neural spines being slanted to the point of reaching behind the rear edge of the processes known as . =Limbs and limb girdles= In terms of limb proportions, Zhao indicated that the forelimb of Klamelisaurus was three-quarters the length of the hindlimb, and the ulna and tibia were respectively two-thirds the lengths of the humerus and femur. He considered these proportions to be distinguishing characteristics of Klamelisaurus. According to Zhao, Klamelisaurus had a thin, elongated scapula and a slender, small coracoid (the former being 4.3 to 4.5 times the length of the latter), but Moore and colleagues did not consider his measurements of the scapula to be reliable as most of the bone was covered by plaster and paint. The , located at the outer bottom end of the scapula, was broader than in Cetiosaurus, Shunosaurus, and many early-diverging sauropodomorphs, and the top edge of the acromion was straight, not concave like Tienshanosaurus. Zhao observed that the top of the humerus was thick, and slightly curved. Unlike Bellusaurus and many neosauropods, the head of the humerus did not have an overhanging sub-circular process. Moore and colleagues noted a unique characteristic of the humerus: the front surface of the top inner end bore a depression, which was bordered by an S-shaped shelf ending in a rounded bump. Zhao n that the ulna was longer than the relatively straight radius, and he suggested that the degree of expansion of the upper ulna was unique; Moore and colleagues instead found that it was comparable to many other sauropods. Also unlike Bellusaurus, the anteromedial process at the top of the ulna had a convex (not flat) surface that sloped below the . The bottom of the front of the radius bore a depression, which Haestasaurus also had, but was otherwise uncommon among sauropods. Zhao's diagnosis for the hips and legs of Klamelisaurus included a robust ilium with a indistinct \\"laminar ridge\\" and a forward-projecting (attachment to the pubis); a slender ischium; a robust, thin, flat, and weakly curved pubis (however, this bone appears to be reconstructed); a thick and flat femur with an indistinct head and a (the attachment for the muscle) located near the top of the bone; and a tibia shorter than the fibula (however, these bones are either incomplete or heavily reconstructed). Moore and colleagues noted that the anterolateral and anteromedial processes at the top of the tibia formed an acute angle in Klamelisaurus, unlike Bellusaurus where they formed an angle of 80¬∞. They also identified a distinguishing characteristic in the first of the (possibly right) foot: there was a flange-like ridge overhanging the inner edge of the shaft. This bone was shorter than the large and recurved claw of the third toe on the right foot. Both of these foot bones, among others, were described by Zhao as hand bones. Classification =Early classifications= In his 1993 description, Zhao placed Klamelisaurus as the only genus in a new subfamily, Klamelisaurinae, for which he also provided a diagnosis. (A number of Zhao's distinguishing characteristics listed above pertain to Klamelisaurinae instead of Klamelisaurus directly.) He considered it to be \\"early to middle stage sauropod\\" with \\"transitional characters\\". As for the higher-level taxonomy of Klamelisaurus, the sauropod classification used by Zhao was an antiquated scheme attributed by Zhao to a 1958 publication by C. C. Young (although in 1983 he had attributed it to a 1961 publication by Oskar Kuhn): the Sauropoda was divided into the primitive Bothrosauropodoidea (misspelt as \\"Bothrosauropodea\\" by Zhao) and the derived (\\"advanced\\") Homalosauropodoidea (misspelt as \\"Homolosauropodoidea\\" and \\"Homolosauropodea\\" by Zhao), which could be distinguished based on dental and vertebral characteristics. He assigned Klamelisaurus to the former. Within the \\"early stage\\" Bothrosauropodoidea, Zhao considered Klamelisaurus to be part of the Brachiosauridae, which by his definition included the modern Brachiosauridae alongside Cetiosauridae (as \\"Cetiosaurinae\\"), Camarasaurinae, and Euhelopodidae (as \\"Euhelopodinae\\"). Among these groups, he considered Klamelisaurus to be closest to Camarasaurinae due to the cervicals being longer than the dorsals; the bifid cervical and dorsal neural spines; the \\"well-developed\\" pleurocoels; the relatively short forelimb; and the fibula- femur length ratio. However, he noted that the combination of more than twelve cervicals, thirteen dorsals, five sacrals with four fused, and other characteristics in Klamelisaurus was distinct from these other groups, warranting the creation of a new subfamily. Subsequent literature has not used Zhao's taxonomy for Klamelisaurus. In the 2004 second edition of The Dinosauria, Paul Upchurch, Paul Barrett, and Peter Dodson considered Klamelisaurus to be a sauropod of uncertain phylogenetic relationships (incertae sedis), and suggested that it can be distinguished by fusion of the last three cervical neural spines. (However, in 2020, Moore and colleagues noted that it did not possess this trait.) Based on the broad, spatula-like teeth (considered by Moore and colleagues to be of questionable affiliation), the estimated presence of sixteen cervicals, the presence of five sacrals, and the forked chevrons, Upchurch and colleagues noted a resemblance between Klamelisaurus and Omeisaurus. Thus, they suggested that it could be a non- neosauropod eusauropod. =Redescription= Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Klamelisaurus was closely related to Mamenchisaurus hocuanensis In their 2020 redescription of Klamelisaurus, Moore and colleagues provided the first phylogenetic analysis of its relationships. They added Klamelisaurus to two different datasets: one used by Jos√© Carballido and colleagues in their 2015 description of Padillasaurus, and one used by Bernardo Gonz√†lez Riga and colleagues in their 2018 redescription of Mendozasaurus. To both, they added various members of the Mamenchisauridae ‚Äî a group that many Middle-to-Late Jurassic Chinese sauropods have been assigned to. Since previous analyses failed to find Mamenchisaurus and Omeisaurus species as unified (monophyletic) groups, their analysis focused on resolving the relationships of individual specimens rather than genera. They conducted three variants of each analysis: a parsimony-based analysis, an implied-weights analysis to optimize for homologous (i.e., derived from a shared ancestor) features, and a Bayesian (likelihood-based) analysis to account for the age of each specimen. All of their analyses recovered Klamelisaurus as part of a group of Middle-to-Late Jurassic sauropods that also included Mamenchisaurus, Chuanjiesaurus, Wamweracaudia, Qijianglong, a specimen from Thailand (the Phu Kradung taxon), and a specimen from Xinjiang (the Shishugou cervicodorsal vertebrae). They termed these the \\"core Mamenchisaurus-like taxa\\". The parsimony-based and implied-weights analyses for the Carballido dataset found Klamelisaurus close to the Phu Kradung and Shishugou specimens, as well as M. youngi; the Bayesian analysis found M. constructus and M. hochuanensis closer than the latter two. The parsimony-based analysis for the Gonz√†lez Riga dataset found Klamelisaurus close to M. youngi, M. hochuanensis, and Qijianglong; and the implied-weights and Bayesian analyses found it close to the Phu Kradung and Shishugou specimens, with the latter also including Chuanjiesaurus, M. constructus, and Euhelopus. Nearly all of their analyses found the \\"core Mamenchisaurus-like taxa\\" to be closely related to Euhelopus, Daxiatitan, and Dongbeititan, traditionally considered part of the more derived Macronaria. They recovered this wider group ‚Äî which they termed the Euhelopodidae ‚Äî outside of the Neosauropoda; the implied-weights analysis on the Carballido dataset placed it as an early-diverging macronarian lineage, also including Bellusaurus, while the implied-weights analysis on the Gonz√†lez Riga dataset found Euhelopus among macronarians as a somphospondyl (in which case they called the group Mamenchisauridae). For all analyses, the support (or \\"likelihood\\") values for groupings within the Euhelopodidae were low. They considered the results of the implied-weights and Bayesian analyses of the Gonz√†lez Riga dataset to be most favorable; still, the results of the two analyses differed profoundly. Thus, they highlighted a need for further redescriptions and revisions of these sauropods (particularly Mamenchisaurus and Omeisaurus) as well as the development of more distinguishing characteristics. Below, two phylogenetic trees show the internal relationships of Euhelopodidae/Mamenchisauridae in the two analyses Moore and colleagues deemed most favorable, the implied-weights and Bayesian analyses of the Gonz√†lez Riga dataset. Topology A: Implied- weights analysis, Gonz√†lez Riga dataset Topology B: Time-calibrated Bayesian analysis, Gonz√†lez Riga dataset =Suggested synonymy with Bellusaurus= Bellusaurus has been suggested to represent a juvenile Klamelisaurus In The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, a popular book with two editions published in 2010 and 2016, Paul has suggested that Klamelisaurus may have been be the adult form of Bellusaurus (known only from juvenile specimens). In 2018, Moore and colleagues redescribed Bellusaurus and provided several arguments to refute this notion. First, they noted that the two were not actually contemporaries; the holotype of Klamelisaurus originates from slightly older strata (rock layers). They also listed twenty-four characteristics in the vertebrae, coracoid, and humerus that differentiated the two genera. In their 2020 redescription of Klamelisaurus, they added four characteristics to this list, and also noted that Bellusaurus did not possess any of the unique features of Klamelisaurus. Most of the characteristics on their list pertain to differences in pneumatic features in the vertebrae of Klamelisaurus and Bellusaurus that are not readily explainable by differences in age. In sauropods, vertebral air spaces typically become more extensive and invade more of the vertebrae with age. Bellusaurus possessed procamerate to weakly camerate air spaces (i.e., its air spaces were deep, leaving only a thin layer of bone at the midline, and were barely enclosed by bone) in its cervicals. Meanwhile, based on comparisons with its relatives, Moore and colleagues inferred that Klamelisaurus likely had camerate air spaces (i.e., enclosed by bone) in its cervicals. Based on the cervicals alone, they could not contradict the hypothesis that juvenile Bellusaurus could have grown into an adult with camellate air spaces in the cervicals, as is the case with Barosaurus. However, they noted that Bellusaurus possessed several pneumatic features in the dorsal neural spines and that Klamelisaurus lacked, which runs contrary to the expected pattern for euhelopodids and mamenchisaurids. Specifically, in the dorsals of Bellusaurus, the PCDLs (posterior centrodiapophyseal laminae) below the diapophyses bifurcated at the bottom; the CPOLs (centropostzygapophyseal laminae) at the rear of the centra had a sharp-edged branch situated in a relatively deep depression; and the diapophyses bore rimmed trough-like depressions. Considering their temporal and anatomical differences, Moore and colleagues thus considered Klamelisaurus and Bellusaurus to be readily distinguishable. However, they also noted two characteristics on their list which may have varied with age: the bifurcated neural spines, and the presence of wing-shaped processes that projected further outwards than the postzygapophyses on the rear dorsals. Palaeoenvironment Stratigraphic position of sauropods in the Shishugou Formation The holotype of Klamelisauus originated from a rock layer that was described as being \\"gray-brown, purple-red sandy mudstone\\" by Zhao in 1993. This layer was situated at the top of what Zhao called the \\"Wucaiwan Formation\\", but a lack of differences in rock layers has led it to become subsumed into the Shishugou Formation as the \\"lower beds\\" or the Wucaiwan Member. Using stratigraphic correlation, this rock layer was found to lie below a tuff from the Shishugou Formation at the Wucaiwan locality, which has been dated radiometrically to 162.2 ¬± 0.2 Ma, or the Oxfordian age of the Jurassic period. Based on this, Moore and colleagues considered Klamelisaurus to have originated from the late Callovian age. During the Callovian, the climate of the Shishugou Formation is considered to have been mesic (moderately and seasonally wet), with the environment at Wucaiwan having been an alluvial plain or marsh. Juliane Hinz and colleagues in 2010 reconstructed a petrified forest preserved in overlying Oxfordian rocks, located north of Jiangjunmiao. It would have consisted of Araucaria trees, with the undergrowth being occupied by Coniopteris tree ferns, Anglopteris and Osmunda ferns, Equisetites horsetails, and Elatocladus shrubs. Three theropod dinosaurs have been discovered near Jiangjunmiao: Monolophosaurus, considered to have been no younger than the late Callovian and thus closest temporally to Klamelisaurus; Aorun, from layers in the \\"middle beds\\" that have been re-dated from the Callovian to the Oxfordian; and Sinraptor, from the Oxfordian \\"upper beds\\". The crocodylomorphs Sunosuchus and Junggarsuchus are known from other localities in the \\"lower beds\\". Meanwhile, the sauropods Bellusaurus, Mamenchisaurus sinocanadorum, and Tienshanosaurus are known from the \\"upper beds\\", above the level of the tuff at 162.2 Ma, and thus were not contemporaries of Klamelisaurus. Asides from these sauropods, Aorun, and Sinraptor, the Oxfordian portion of the Shishugou Formation preserves a diverse dinosaur fauna that also includes the theropods Haplocheirus, Shishugounykus, Zuolong, Guanlong, and Limusaurus; the ornithopod Gongbusaurus; the stegosaur Jiangjunosaurus; and the marginocephalians Yinlong and Hualianceratops.

In rosacea it improves the redness. It is used as eye drops or applied to the skin. Common side effects when used in the eyes include itchiness, redness, and a dry mouth. Common side effects when used on the skin include redness, burning, and headaches. More significant side effects may include allergic reactions and low blood pressure. Use in pregnancy appears to be safe. When applied to the eye it works by decreasing the amount of aqueous humor made while increasing the amount that drains from the eye. When applied to the skin it works by causing blood vessels to contract. Brimonidine was patented in 1972 and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. One milliliter in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about 1.13 ¬£ as of 2019. In the United States the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$0.60. In 2017, it was the 167th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions. Medical uses  Brimonidine is indicated for the lowering of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It is also the active ingredient of brimonidine/timolol along with timolol maleate. A 2017 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine if brimonidine slows optic nerve damage. In 2013, the FDA approved topical application of brimonidine 0.33% gel for persistent facial redness of rosacea. Mechanism of action Brimonidine is an Œ±2 adrenergic agonist. Œ±2 agonists, through the activation of a G protein-coupled receptor, inhibit the activity of adenylate cyclase. This reduces cAMP and hence aqueous humour production by the ciliary body. Peripheral Œ±2 agonist activity results in vasoconstriction of blood vessels (as opposed to central Œ±2 agonist activity that decreases sympathetic tone, as can be seen by the medication clonidine). This vasoconstriction may explain the acute reduction in aqueous humor flow. The increased uveoscleral outflow from prolonged use may be explained by increased prostaglandin release due to Œ± adrenergic stimulation. This may lead to relaxed ciliary muscle and increased uveoscleral outflow. Society and culture =Names= It is sold under the brand names Alphagan, Alphagan-P, Mirvaso Lumify, and others. =Over the counter= In July 2018, Bausch and Lomb began to market over the counter (OTC) eye drops, using brimonidine's tartrate formulation in a concentration of 0.025%, as an ophthalmic vasoconstrictor under the brand name Lumify. Intended to relieve redness in the sclerae of the eyes for periods of up to eight hours at a time through its vasoconstrictive effects, Lumify was marketed as an alternative to Visine, the brand of tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride solution most commonly used for that purpose.

The European Commission provides support only for selected projects. Partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry have been set up within the framework of special studies approved by an independent peer review committee.

Fortier's DJing covers a range of styles from dark progressive to minimalist techno. He is well known for being a central figure in the development of electronic dance music in the United States as both a DJ and founder of the Balance Record Pool. Chris Fortier grew up in Melbourne, Florida, moving to Orlando, Florida to attend the University of Central Florida. Until he discovered house music, Fortier's primary hobby was surfing. He began DJing in 1990 in Orlando where he was influenced by other Florida DJs such as Kimball Collins and Dave Cannalte. After performing with DJ Icey, Kimball Collins set Fortier up as resident DJ at the Aahz nightclub. In 1993, Fortier was introduced to Neil Kolo, who had been producing music for 5 years. They found they had chemistry and became the duo Fade, releasing \\"...For All the People\\" on their newly founded label Fade Records in 1994. In 1996, Fortier founded the Balance Record Pool, a record pool designed to help North American DJs to spread electronic music. Balance won the International Dance Music Awards for best record pool in 2005 and 2006. The Balance Record Pool and Jimmy Van M's DJ booking agency making up Balance Promote Group. In 1998, when submitting a bootleg remix of Sarah McLachlan's song \\"Plenty\\" to her record label, Fortier was offered the chance to remix the Delerium song \\"Silence\\" featuring McLachlan. Their remix was released on Nettwerk and sold over one million copies. Fade Records began to expand to productions not exclusively by Fortier and Kolo, including helping launch the career of Steve Porter. Fortier helped Porter develop his production abilities and Porter helped introduce Fortier to the mixing software Pro Tools. In 2000, Fortier began his residency at New York City club Twilo, playing alongside Dave Seaman. After being in contact with EQ / Stomp regarding distribution of their records in the Balance Record Pool, Fortier was given the opportunity to mix the seventh entry in their Balance series. For Balance 007, Fortier used Ableton Live to mesh songs together, similarly to Sasha.

The film stars Richard Dreyfuss as the eponymous professor, along with Jenna Elfman, Natasha Lyonne, and Lily Tomlin. Plot Respected anthropologist James Krippendorf (Richard Dreyfuss) and his wife, Jennifer (Barbara Williams), bring their three children along during their much-enjoyed search in New Guinea for a lost tribe. The search fails, despite the family's best efforts. After Jennifer's death back in the U.S., James falls into academic stagnation, having spent all his foundation grant money raising the children as a single parent. Scheduled to lecture at a college and fearful of being charged with misuse of grant funds, James concocts an imaginary tribe, the Shelmikedmu, using the names of his children as a basis. He later fakes a 16 mm \\"documentary\\" film, casting his children as tribe members and superimposing footage of a legitimate New Guinean tribe so as to enhance the illusion. Anthropologist Veronica Micelli (Jenna Elfman) contacts cable-TV producer Henry Spivey (David Ogden Stiers), forcing James to continue creating fraudulent footage as James' rival Ruth Allen (Lily Tomlin) becomes suspicious. Because he has described a culture unlike any other, Krippendorf's fraud becomes increasingly famous. James himself masquerades as a tribal elder, while his two sons, Mickey (Gregory Smith) and Edmund (Carl Michael Lindner), create and enact increasingly imaginative rituals. Only the eldest child, James' daughter Shelly, refuses to participate due to her disgust at the dishonesty perpetrated by her father. Taking advantage of her curiosity, James tricks Veronica into participating in his false documentary. When she discovers the truth, she is initially angry, but later helps James continue his fraud. Ruth Allen travels to New Guinea, discovering no tribe in the location specified by James. She transmits the news via fax to a colleague, who exposes James at a gala. James' imaginative son, Mickey, improvises a lie, that the Shelmikedmu hide by means of a magical ritual known only to them. Unknown to the majority of the characters, Shelly has contacted the New Guineans befriended by her family during the futile search for the lost tribe, urging them to masquerade as the Shelmikedmu in order to disappoint Ruth Allen. The ruse succeeds, and the accusation of fraud is abandoned. James, relieved of his worries, ends his fraud. Because Veronica has become sexually involved with him during her participation in his deceit, she assumes the role of a mother toward the children, though she is not explicitly said to marry James.

The only known species is Kotasaurus yamanpalliensis. It was discovered in the Kota Formation of Telangana, India and shared its habitat with the related Barapasaurus. So far the remains of at least 12 individuals are known. The greater part of the skeleton is known, but the skull is missing, with the exception of two teeth. Like all sauropods, it was a large, quadrupedal herbivore with long neck and tail.  Description  Legs of Kotasaurus Kotasaurus is one of the most basal sauropods known. The general body plan was that of a typical sauropod, but in several basal (plesiomorphic) features it resembles prosauropods. Like all sauropods, Kotasaurus was an obligate quadruped, while prosauropods were primitively bipedal. The body length is estimated at roughly nine meters, with a weight of 2.5 tonnes, and therefore already comparable with that of later sauropods. The femur was straight and oval in cross section, which means that the limbs were already columnar. The teeth were spoon-shaped, like those of later sauropods. Basal features, on the other hand, include the relatively short and slightly twisted humerus, as well as the retention of a lesser trochanter on the femur. The neural spines of the vertebrae were simply built and their centra are massive, in contrast to those of the related Barapasaurus, which show more hollowing, be it without pneumatisation, of the sides as a weight-saving measure. Autapomorphies (newly acquired features) include the relatively slender limb bones as well as the low and elongated preacetabular process (the forward-pointing process of the ilium).  Classification  Initially, it was not clear if Kotasaurus represents a true sauropod or a basal sauropodomorph that has to be classified outside Sauropoda. Some paleontologists placed it inside a basal sauropod family called Vulcanodontidae though, together with Barapasaurus and the fragmentary Ohmdenosaurus and Zizhongosaurus. This grouping is now recognized to be paraphyletic. Today Kotasaurus is recognized as one of the most basal sauropods known. The exact relationships are not entirely clear, however. A recent study by Bandyopadhyay and colleagues (2011) renders Kotasaurus to be more basal than Barapasaurus and Vulcanodon but more derived than Jingshanosaurus, Antetonitrus and Chinshakiangosaurus.  Discovery  All known fossils come from an area of 2,400 m¬≤ near the village of Yamanpalli in Telangana, approximately forty kilometres north of the Barapasaurus type locality. These finds, altogether 840 skeletal parts, were found in the late 1970s. In 1988 they were named and described by P.M. Yadagiri as a new genus and species of sauropod, Kotasaurus yamanpalliensis. The generic name refers to the Kota Formation. The specific name reflects the provenance from Yamanpalli. The holotype is 21/SR/PAL, an ilium. The Geological Survey of India combined several elements into a skeletal mount and displayed it at the Birla Science Museum, Hyderabad. In 2001, Yadagiri described the osteology in more detail.

The specific epithet papuana is derived from Papua, an alternative name for the island. Botanical history Nepenthes papuana type material Nepenthes papuana was first collected on October 7, 1909, by Lucien Sophie Albert Marie von R√∂mer. Two plants were collected on this date on a hill below 750 m altitude, in the northern part of the Noordrivier. The species was collected again on January 5, 1913, by Cecil Boden Kloss at an elevation of 920 m, as part of the Wollaston Expedition. Four further collections were made in September, 1926, by Willem Marius Docters van Leeuwen at 250 and 300 m above sea level.Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 9(3‚Äì4): 249‚Äì438. Plant material belonging to N. papuana was first described in 1916 by Henry Nicholas Ridley.Ridley, H.N. 1916. Report on the Wollaston Expedition to Dutch New Guinea, 1912-1913. Transactions of the Linnean Society 9(1): 1‚Äì268. However, Ridley believed it represented a male plant of N. neoguineensis and did not recognise it as a new species. B. H. Danser formally described N. papuana in his seminal monograph \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", published in 1928. The description is based on the specimens Docters van Leeuwen 10282, Docters van Leeuwen 10340, and Docters van Leeuwen 10341. The latter two were illustrated in Danser's monograph and consist of male and female floral material, respectively. Description Nepenthes papuana is a climbing plant. The stem is cylindrical in cross section and 5 to 7 mm thick. Internodes are 2 to 5 cm long. Older plants produce short shoots and rosettes near the base of the stem. Leaves are sessile or shortly petiolate and coriaceous in texture. The lamina is lanceolate and reaches 30 cm in length and 5 cm in width. It has an acute apex and is attenuate towards the base. Usually around 4 to 6 longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are indistinct. Tendrils are about as long as the lamina and 1 to 2 mm thick. A closeup of the stem and leaves Rosette and lower pitchers are obliquely ovate in the lower part and gradually narrowed above, reaching 7 cm in height and 2.5 cm in width. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§4 mm wide) run down the front of the pitcher. The pitcher mouth is oblique and slightly incurved towards the lid. The peristome is 1 to 2 mm wide and bears small teeth. The inner surface of the pitcher is glandular in the lower two-fifths to one-third. The lid or operculum is suborbicular, slightly cordate, and 1 to 2 cm long and wide. The lower surface of the lid bears no appendages and has many small glands concentrated near the centre. An unbranched spur is inserted at the base of the lid. Upper pitchers gradually arise from the ends of the tendrils, forming a 6 to 12 mm wide curve. They are shortly infundibular in the lower part, slightly ventricose for around a third of their height, and wholly tubulose in the upper part. Aerial pitchers may be up to 15 cm high and 3 cm wide. Two narrow wings (‚â§2.5 mm wide) are present over the entire length of the pitcher. They may or may not have fringe elements. The mouth is oblique and acute towards the lid. The flattened peristome is up to 2 mm wide and bears small teeth that are up to twice as long as they are wide. The inner surface of the pitcher is glandular in the ventricose part. The glands occur at a density of 400 to 500 per square centimetre. The lid is nearly round, being only slightly longer than it is wide. It may be up to 3.5 cm long and 3.25 cm wide. Small, depressed glands are present on the undersurface of the lid, being concentrated near the basal part of the midrib. The spur is flattened, 2 to 3 mm long, and unbranched. Nepenthes papuana has a racemose inflorescence. In male plants, the peduncle is about 6 cm long and 2 mm wide, while in female plants it is 12 cm long and 2.5 mm thick. The rachis is up to 15 cm long. Pedicels are up to 15 mm long and do not have a bracteole. They are almost always one-flowered, although lower ones may be two-flowered. Tepals are suborbicular in male plants and oblong in female plants. Stamens are 3 to 4 mm long including the anthers. The ovary is sessile. Fruits are 25 to 35 mm long and bear lanceolate valves. The filiform seeds are 12 to 15 mm long. The indumentum of N. papuana is generally sparse and short. The stem and lamina are mostly glabrous, except for the midrib, which has caducous brown hairs on its lower surface, and the leaf margin, which bears persistent brown-velvety hairs. Tendrils are similarly hairy to the underside of the midrib. Pitchers have a dense indumentum of short, stellate hairs when young. A sparse covering of these hairs is persistent in lower pitchers, whereas in upper pitchers they are mostly caducous. Developing inflorescences are densely tomentose, becoming more sparsely tomentose when mature. Lower pitchers are generally reddish throughout with red blotches on their inner surface. Upper pitchers are usually green throughout but may also be reddish. Herbarium specimens are red- brownish, with the upper surface of the leaves being yellow-brownish. Ecology A small rosette plant Nepenthes papuana occurs on both the north and south sides of the main central mountains of Papua Province.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. The species occurs from sea level to an intermediate elevation of 1300 m.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Australia and New Guinea. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. In its natural habitat, N. papuana grows in exposed sites at forest edges. Lower pitchers frequently develop embedded in moss. The species occurs sympatrically with N. ampullaria, N. insignis, N. maxima, and N. mirabilis.Rischer, H. 1995. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 24(3): 75‚Äì77. It may form natural hybrids with N. paniculata.Rediscovery of Nepenthes paniculata. [video] Redfern Natural History Productions. The conservation status of N. papuana is listed as Least Concern on the 2014 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Related species A vining plant with upper pitchers from the Doorman Massif A typical lower pitcher from the Doorman Massif Danser considered N. neoguineensis to be the closest relative of N. papuana. In his description of the species, Danser states: \\"N. papuana is so much alike N. neoguineensis in its vegetative parts, that only the complete knowledge of the generative parts has suggested me to establish a new species\\". The two taxa can be distinguished on the basis of several morphological features. N. papuana has a racemose inflorescence, while that of N. neoguineensis is a panicle or panicle-like raceme. Furthermore, the inflorescence of N. papuana usually bears only one-flowered pedicels, both in male and female plants. Those of N. neoguineensis can be up to four-flowered. The lamina of N. papuana has very distinct longitudinal veins and indistinct pinnate veins, whereas in N. neoguineensis the opposite is true. In addition, the leaves of N. papuana are very densely ciliate, much more so than in N. neoguineensis. The wings are less developed in the upper pitchers of N. papuana and the fringe elements are more closely spaced.

These may be used for prevention, treatment, diagnosis or for relieving symptoms of a disease. Clinical research is different from clinical practice. In clinical practice established treatments are used, while in clinical research evidence is collected to establish a treatment. Overview The term \\"clinical research\\" refers to the entire bibliography of a drug/device/biologic, in fact any test article from its inception in the lab to its introduction to the consumer market and beyond. Once the promising candidate or the molecule is identified in the lab, it is subjected to pre-clinical studies or animal studies where different aspects of the test article (including its safety toxicity if applicable and efficacy, if possible at this early stage) are studied.Creswell, J.W. (2008). Educational research: Planning, conducting, and evaluating quantitative and qualitative research (3rd). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. 2008, p. 300. In the United States, when a test article is unapproved or not yet cleared by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or when an approved or cleared test article is used in a way that may significantly increase the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks), the data obtained from the pre-clinical studies or other supporting evidence, case studies of off label use, etc. are submitted in support of an Investigational New Drug (IND) applicationFDA Page last updated 27 October 2014 Investigational New Drug (IND) Application to the FDA for review prior to conducting studies that involve even one human and a test article if the results are intended to be submitted to or held for inspection by the FDA at any time in the future (in the case of an already approved test article, if intended to submit or hold for inspection by the FDA in support of a change in labeling or advertising). Where devices are concerned the submission to the FDA would be for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application if the device is a significant risk device or is not in some way exempt from prior submission to the FDA. In addition, clinical research may require Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Research Ethics Board (REB) and possibly other institutional committee reviews, Privacy Board, Conflict of Interest Committee, Radiation Safety Committee, Radioactive Drug Research Committee, etc. approval whether or not the research requires prior submission to the FDA. Clinical research review criteria will depend on which federal regulations the research is subject to (e.g., (Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) if federally funded, FDA as already discussed) and will depend on which regulations the institutions subscribe to, in addition to any more stringent criteria added by the institution possibly in response to state or local laws/policies or accreditation entity recommendations. This additional layer of review (IRB/REB in particular) is critical to the protection of human subjects especially when you consider that often research subject to the FDA regulation for prior submission is allowed to proceed, by those same FDA regulations, 30 days after submission to the FDA unless specifically notified by the FDA not to initiate the study. Clinical research is often conducted at academic medical centers and affiliated research study sites. These centers and sites provide the prestige of the academic institution as well as access to larger metropolitan areas, providing a larger pool of medical participants. These academic medical centers often have their internal Institutional Review Boards that oversee the ethical conduct of medical research. The clinical research ecosystem involves a complex network of sites, pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions. This has led to a growing field of technologies used for managing the data and operational factors of clinical research. Clinical research management is often aided by eClinical systems to help automate the management and conducting of clinical trials. In the European Union, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) acts in a similar fashion for studies conducted in their region. These human studies are conducted in four phases in research subjects that give consent to participate in the clinical trials. Phases Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases. Each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate clinical trial. The drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years. If the drug successfully passes through Phases I, II, and III, it will usually be approved by the national regulatory authority for use in the general population. Phase IV is 'post-approval' studies. Phase I includes 20 to 100 healthy volunteers or individuals with the disease/condition. This study typically lasts several months and its purpose is safety and dosage. Phase II includes a larger number of individual participants ranging 100‚Äì300, and phase III includes Approximately 1000-3000 participants to collect more data about the drug. 70% of drugs advance to the next phase. Before pharmaceutical companies start clinical trials on a drug, they conduct extensive pre-clinical studies.

When their mouthpart penetrates the phloem, the sugary, high-pressure liquid is forced out of the anus of the aphid. Honeydew is particularly common as a secretion in hemipteran insects and is often the basis for trophobiosis. Some caterpillars of Lycaenidae butterflies and some moths also produce honeydew. Honeydew producing insects like cicadas pierce phloem ducts to access the sugar rich sap. The sap continues to bleed after the insects have moved on leaving a white sugar crust called manna. Ants may collect, or \\"milk\\", honeydew directly from aphids and other honeydew producers, which benefit from their presence due to their driving away predators such as lady beetles or parasitic wasps‚Äîsee Crematogaster peringueyi. Animals and plants in a mutually symbiotic arrangement with ants are called Myrmecophiles. In Madagascar, some gecko species in the genera Phelsuma and Lygodactylus are known to approach flatid plant-hoppers on tree-trunks from below and induce them to excrete honeydew by head nodding behaviour. The plant-hopper then raises its abdomen and excretes a drop of honeydew almost right onto the snout of the gecko. Honeydew can cause sooty mold‚Äîa bane of gardeners‚Äîon many ornamental plants. It also contaminates vehicles parked beneath trees, and can then be difficult to remove from glass and bodywork. Honeydew is also secreted by certain fungi, particularly ergot.Ergot of Rye , APSnet.org, The American Phytopathological Society Honeydew is collected by certain species of birds, mosquitoes, wasps, stingless bees and honey bees, which process it into a dark, strong honey (honeydew honey). This is highly prized in parts of Europe and Asia for its reputed medicinal value. Parachartergus fraternus, a eusocial wasp species, collects honeydew to feed to their growing larvae. Recent research has also documented the use of honeydew by over 40 species of wild, native, mostly solitary bees in California. Religion and mythology In Norse mythology, dew falls from the ash tree Yggdrasil to the earth, and according to the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, \\"this is what people call honeydew and from it bees feed.\\" In Greek mythology, m√©li, or \\"honey\\", drips from the Manna‚Äìash, (Fraxinus ornus), with which the Meliae, or \\"ash tree nymphs\\", nursed the infant god Zeus on the island of Crete, (as in the Hymn to Zeus by Callimachus). Honey-dew is referenced in the last lines of Samuel Coleridge's poem Kubla Khan, perhaps because of its mythological connotations: In the Hebrew Bible, while the Israelites are wandering through the desert after the Exodus, they are miraculously provided with a substance, manna, that is sometimes associated with honeydew.Manna#Identifying manna Exodus 16:31 provides a description: \\"it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.\\" Nectar producing trees =Eucalyptus= In eucalypt forests, production of both the honeydew nectar and manna tends to increase in spring and autumn. Eucalyptus can produce even more manna than honeydew nectar. The sugar glider possum eats both, licking the nectar from branches. Other species attracted to the nectar include the feathertail glider, brush-tailed phascogale, and brown antechinus. Most trees are not able to produce sap if the phloem duct becomes damaged by mechanical processes. =Dates= The Ommatissus lybicus is attracted to certain cultivars of the date palm tree. The honeydew producing insects preferred the Medjhool variety to the Deglet Noor in Israel, where they have been observed in the Arava Valley. Very dense insect populations may have some adverse effects. Different methods of controlling the insects, including natural and chemical, have been studied. =Tamarisk= Two scale insects in the Sinai, Trabutina mannipara and Najacoccus serpentinus feed on Tamarisk trees. They secrete a sugary nectar that turns white when it hardens, resembling certain whitish flakes described in the Hebrew scriptures.

The D and N trains also stop here during late nights, and some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction. The 25th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, which was approved in 1905. Construction on the segment of the line that includes 25th Street started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in May 1912. The station opened on June 22, 1915, as part of the initial portion of the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to 59th Street. The station's platforms were lengthened in 1926-1927, and again during a renovation in 1968‚Äì1970.  History  = Construction = The 25th Street station was constructed as part of the Fourth Avenue Line, the plan for which was initially adopted on June 1, 1905. The Rapid Transit Commission was succeeded on July 1, 1907, by the New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), which approved the plan for the line in late 1907. The contract for the section of the line that included the 25th Street station, Route 11A3, which extended from 10th Street to 27th Street, was awarded on May 22, 1908, to the Tidewater Building Company and Thomas B. Bryson for $2,043,162.31 (). The New York City Board of Estimate approved the contract on October 29, 1909. Construction on the segment started on December 20, 1909, and was completed in May 1912. As part of negotiations between New York City, the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT), and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company for the expansion of the city's transit network, the line was leased to a subsidiary of the BRT. The agreement, known as Contract 4 of the Dual Contracts, was signed on March 19, 1913. 25th Street opened on June 22, 1915, as part of an extension of the subway to Coney Island, which included the Fourth Avenue Line north of 59th Street as well as the entire Sea Beach Line. The station's opening was marked with a competition between two trains heading from Chambers Street station in Manhattan to the Coney Island station, one heading via the West End Line and the other via the Sea Beach Line; the latter got to Coney Island first. = Station renovations =  1920s  On June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, 25th Street's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Though the Transit Commission ordered the BMT to lengthen these platforms in September 1923, progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 (). The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to the Corson Construction Company for $345,021 (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.  1950s and 1960s  leftIn July 1959, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) announced that it would install fluorescent lighting at the 25th Street station and five other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line for between $175,000 and $200,000. Bids on the project were to be advertised on August 7, 1959 and completed by Fall 1960. In the 1960s, the NYCTA started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including 25th Street, to the W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions. The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between Pacific Street and 36th Street, including those at 25th Street, on March 28, 1969. Funding for the renovation projects came out of the NYCTA's 1969‚Äì1970 Capital Budget, costing $8,177,890 in total. As part of the renovation project, the station's platforms were extended, and the station's elaborate mosaic tile walls were covered over with white cinderblock tiles. The latter change, which was also made to 15 other stations on the BMT Broadway and Fourth Avenue Lines, was criticized for being dehumanizing. The NYCTA spokesman stated that the old tiles were in poor condition and that the change was made to improve the appearance of stations and provide uniformity. Furthermore, it did not consider the old mosaics to have \\"any great artistic merit\\".  Station layout  An entrance to the Manhattan-bound platform This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The R stops here at all times; some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction; and the D and N stop here during late nights, but use the center express tracks to bypass the station during daytime hours. White tiled curtain walls separate the express tracks from the local tracks. The platforms have no columns except for a section at the extreme north ends where they were extended in 1970. The ceiling in this area is lower. These columns are I-beams and are painted cream-colored. Prior to the station's 1970 renovation, it was finished all in white and marble tile, and it had its own color scheme to allow regular passengers to identify the station based only on the color of the marble trimmings. However, the original trim line is still visible in the fare control areas behind the token booth and MetroCard Vending Machines. It is in the standard BMT format with \\"25\\" number tablets in it at regular intervals. Since the renovation, the station walls have consisted of white cinderblock tiles, except for small recesses in the walls, which contain orange-painted cinderblock tiles. The orange cinderblock field contains the station-name signs and white text pointing to the exits. =Exits= Each platform has a same-level fare control area in the center. As a result, there is no free transfer between directions. Each fare control area has a turnstile bank, token booth, and single street stair. The staircase on the Bay Ridge-bound platform goes up to the southwest corner of 25th Street and Fourth Avenue while the one on the Manhattan-bound side goes up to the southeast corner. Nearby points of interest The 25th Street station is the closest station to the main entrance of Green-Wood Cemetery, located one block to the east of the station. The entrance dates back to 1862, and is a New York City designated landmark, made of New Jersey brownstone with sculpted groups.

In 1912, during the Dual System negotiations, the construction of an extension of the Fourth Avenue subway from 43rd Street to 89th Street, just south of the 86th Street station, was recommended. The proposal was approved by the Board of Estimate on February 15, 1912. The PSC directed its chief engineer to create plans on June 14, 1912. The two contracts for the extension, Route 11B, were awarded on September 16, 1912, to Degnon Construction Company for a combined $3.8 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Construction on Route 11B1, the section of the extension between 43rd Street and 61st Street, which includes the 53rd Street station, began on March 15, 1913. Originally, this section was planned to have two tracks, but after the connection to the Sea Beach Line was added to the plan during the middle of construction, the plan was changed to four tracks. This section was completed in 1915. The section of the line running through the 53rd Street station opened on June 22, 1915, as part of an extension of the subway to Coney Island, which included the Fourth Avenue Line north of 59th Street as well as the entire Sea Beach Line. The line's opening was marked with a competition between two trains heading from Chambers Street station in Manhattan to the Coney Island station, one heading via the West End Line and the other via the Sea Beach Line; the latter got to Coney Island first. However, the 45th and 53rd Street stations remained closed, despite being technically complete, since the stations were being used by a contractor to haul dirt out. The stations opened on September 22, 1915. = Station renovations =  1920s  On June 27, 1922, the New York State Transit Commission directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at 23 stations on the lines of the Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT), the successor to the BRT, to accommodate eight-car trains. As part of the project, 53rd Street's platforms would have been lengthened from to . Though the Transit Commission ordered the BMT to lengthen these platforms in September 1923, progress on the extensions did not occur until February 16, 1925, when the New York City Board of Transportation (NYCBOT) directed its engineers to prepare plans to lengthen the platforms at this and eleven other stations along the Fourth Avenue Line. It estimated the project's cost to be $633,000 () (). The NYCBOT received bids for the project on February 25, 1926. The contract was awarded to the Corson Construction Company for $345,021 () (). The extensions opened on August 1, 1927.  1960s  left In the 1960s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) started a project to lengthen station platforms on its lines in Southern Brooklyn to to accommodate 10-car trains. On July 14, 1967, the NYCTA awarded a contract to conduct test borings at eleven stations on the Fourth Avenue Line, including 53rd Street, to the W. M. Walsh Corporation for $6,585 () in preparation of the construction of platform extensions (). The NYCTA issued an invitation for bids on the project to extend the platforms at stations along the Fourth Avenue Line between 45th Street station and Bay Ridge‚Äî95th Street, including this station, on May 3, 1968. As part of the renovation project, the station's platforms were extended to the south, and the station's elaborate mosaic tile walls were covered over with white cinderblock tiles. The latter change, which was also made to fifteen other stations on the BMT Broadway and Fourth Avenue Line, was criticized for being dehumanizing. The NYCTA spokesman stated that the old tiles were in poor condition and that the change was made to improve the appearance of stations and provide uniformity. Furthermore, it did not consider the old mosaics to have \\"any great artistic merit\\".  2017  As part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 2015‚Äì2019 Capital Program, the station, along with thirty other New York City Subway stations, were scheduled to undergo a complete overhaul as part of the Enhanced Station Initiative. Updates were to include cellular service, Wi-Fi, USB charging stations, interactive service advisories and maps, improved signage, and improved station lighting. From January to May 2016, Grimshaw Architects worked on a design for the station's renovation, with Arup Group acting as a consultant. The award for Package 1 of the renovations, which covered renovations at the Prospect Avenue, 53rd Street, and Bay Ridge Avenue stations on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, was awarded on November 30, 2016. Citnalta- Forte Joint Venture was selected to renovate the three stations under a $72 million design‚Äìbuild contract, the first such contract in the subway system's history. The station was closed on March 27, 2017, for these renovations, and reopened on September 8, 2017, ahead of schedule.  Station layout  An original mosaic, directing passengers toward the 95th Street-bound platform, is located above modern signage. This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. The R stops here at all times; some rush-hour W trains stop here in the peak direction; and the N stops here during late nights, but uses the center express tracks to bypass the station during daytime hours. Columns run along the entire length of both platforms and are painted black. Every other column has a \\"53 Street\\" sign on it in black with white text. All are rounded except for the ones near the two staircases to the station's main entrance, which was where the platforms were extended in 1970. Prior to the station's 1970 renovation, it was finished all in white and marble tile, and it had its own color scheme to allow regular passengers to identify the station based only on the color of the marble trimmings. Since that renovation, the station walls have consisted of white cinderblock tiles, except for small recesses in the walls, which contain yellow-painted cinderblock tiles. The yellow cinderblock field contains the station-name signs and black text pointing to the exits. During the 2017 renovation, the cinderblock tiles were refurbished and colored white with small recesses containing black tiles. ADA-compliant platform treads and a granite tiled floor, as well as indirect lighting atop the station wall, which was relocated from above the platform edge, were installed. The 2017 artwork at this station consists of nature-inspired mosaics by Brooklyn-based artist Mickalene Thomas. =Exits= The station's main entrance has two staircases to each platform and one to each northern corner of Fourth Avenue and 53rd Street. The mezzanine allows transfer between directions and contains some original mosaic directional and arrow signs. The one by the staircases to the southbound platform displays \\"Ft. Hamilton & Coney Island\\" while the one by the Manhattan-bound platform staircases displays \\"Down Town Trains.\\" The southbound platform has an additional entrance near the north end. Two platform-level turnstiles lead to a small landing before a three-flight staircase goes up to 52nd Street and Fourth Avenue. Prior to the 2017 renovation, the entrance was exit-only. The landing area contained the original 1915 trim band with a single \\"53\\" tiled on it prior to the renovation of the station.

She was portrayed in that film by Katie Holmes, with Emma Lockhart as a younger version of the character in early scenes. Holmes also voiced the character in the video game adaptation. Maggie Gyllenhaal replaced Holmes in the 2008 sequel The Dark Knight after Holmes chose not to reprise the role. Gyllenhaal also appeared as Dawes on the viral marketing website I Believe in Harvey Dent,http://www.ibelieveinharveydent.com/ giving Harvey Dent her endorsement in the District Attorney election. In the Dark Knight Trilogy, Rachel is Bruce Wayne's (Christian Bale) childhood sweetheart and one of the few people who truly knows him. The conflict between Bruce's love for her and his secret life as Batman is one of the main themes of the first two films in the trilogy, while her death in The Dark Knight in part motivates his actions in the third and final film, The Dark Knight Rises. Development Katie Holmes was to reprise as Rachel in The Dark Knight, but turned it down in order to star in Mad Money instead. Before Maggie Gyllenhaal was cast, Emily Blunt and Rachel McAdams were considered to replace Holmes as Rachel. Gyllenhaal has acknowledged that Rachel is a damsel in distress to an extent, but says Nolan sought ways to empower the character, so \\"Rachel's really clear about what's important to her and unwilling to compromise her morals, which made a nice change\\" from the many conflicted characters whom she has previously portrayed. Fictional character biography =Batman Begins (2005)= Rachel is Bruce Wayne's closest childhood friend. Rachel's mother worked as a domestic servant at Wayne Manor, and the two would often play together on the grounds. After Bruce's parents are murdered by Joe Chill (Richard Brake), Rachel's mother seeks other employment and leaves Wayne Manor with Rachel. Rachel enrolls in law school and gets an internship at the Gotham City District Attorney's office during her first year. After Chill is murdered for testifying against Mafia boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson), Bruce reveals to Rachel that he intended to murder Chill himself, and is angry that he was deprived of revenge. Rachel is horrified and tells Bruce that his late parents would be ashamed of him. She also takes Bruce down to the slums and shows him that Falcone's criminal empire has worsened the poverty created by Gotham's economic depression, and states that every day more people just like Chill turn to crime out of desperation. Soon afterward, Bruce leaves the United States and Rachel continues her studies in law school. Years later, she becomes an assistant district attorney working for District Attorney Carl Finch (Larry Holden). Rachel dedicates her life and career to eliminating crime in Gotham, in the process making enemies of Falcone and later Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy), Arkham Asylum's corrupt chief psychiatrist. When Bruce returns to Gotham, Rachel is surprised that he did not contact her, and later feels disappointed in him, taking his playboy fa√ßade at face value. Around the same time, a costumed vigilante calling himself Batman appears in Gotham, and saves Rachel from Falcone's assassins. Rachel is intrigued by the masked crime-fighter, unaware that he is her old friend Bruce. After Finch is murdered by Crane's thugs, Rachel takes over his job until a replacement can be found. Shortly afterward, Falcone has a psychotic break in police custody, and Rachel believes he is faking it to avoid trial, unaware that Crane drugged him with his fear toxin. When she goes to Arkham to evaluate the situation, Crane drugs her with fear toxin as well. Batman rescues her again, administers an antidote and tells her that Crane is working with the League of Shadows, a terrorist organization led by Ra's al Ghul (Liam Neeson). He gives her instructions for a plan to save the city from the League's attack. He then sedates her and has his butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine), take her home. She wakes up in her bed and delivers samples of an anti-toxin to Gotham City Police Department sergeant James Gordon (Gary Oldman). The League starts a riot in the Narrows, one of Gotham City's slums, and Rachel is trapped. Crane, who has now assumed the criminal alter ego of \\"The Scarecrow\\", attacks her again. She defends herself and a boy caught in the riot by firing a taser at Crane's face, driving him away. Soon, the city is overrun by Arkham's inmates, whom the League has released, and Rachel and the boy are surrounded by lunatics led by Falcone's henchman, Victor Zsasz (Tim Booth). Batman saves them at the last minute and gives Rachel a hint as to his secret identity. Towards the end of the film, Rachel visits the remains of Wayne Manor, finding Bruce and Alfred sorting through the wreckage. She and Bruce share a kiss, but she tells him that they cannot be together until Gotham no longer needs Batman. At the end of the movie's novelization, she is named interim District Attorney. =The Dark Knight (2008)= Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight (2008) By the start of the second film, Rachel is in a relationship with newly selected District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), creating a conflict between him, herself, and Bruce Wayne. Dent soon asks Rachel to marry him, but she does not have a clear answer, being torn between her love for both men. At one point, the Joker (Heath Ledger) attacks Rachel at Dent's fundraiser, holding her at knifepoint. Batman arrives and fights off the men, but the Joker grabs Rachel and throws her from the skyscraper window. Batman jumps out the window after her, breaking their fall on a car below. Rachel is next seen at the funeral of police commissioner Gillian Loeb (Colin MacFarlane), who was murdered by the Joker. At the funeral, the Joker attempts to assassinate Mayor Anthony Garcia (Nestor Carbonell), and leaves behind evidence indicating that Rachel will be next. Rachel takes shelter in Bruce's penthouse at Dent's insistence. There she and Bruce briefly rekindle their romance. He admits that he desires to turn himself in as Batman and hopes they could eventually be together, which Rachel says cannot happen if he goes to prison. Dent holds a press conference and claims to be Batman. Rachel is disgusted that Bruce would let Dent take the fall for him, and gives Alfred a letter to be delivered to Bruce \\"when the time is right.\\" She promptly leaves the penthouse. After Batman and Gordon capture the Joker, Rachel and Dent are kidnapped by police officers on mob boss Sal Maroni's (Eric Roberts) payroll, who are working under the Joker's orders. Batman interrogates the Joker and learns that the lives of both Dent and Rachel are at stake. The Joker tells Batman that he must choose which one of them to save and gives him both locations. However, the Joker has switched the addresses, with the intention of orchestrating Dent's downfall. Batman speeds off, believing that he is traveling to Rachel's destination. Both Rachel and Dent are tied up in rooms surrounded with gasoline drums and remote-controlled explosives, with phones attached so they can talk to each other. Rachel tells Dent that she wants to marry him. Batman arrives at Dent's location in time to save him, but Gordon arrives at the other too late, and Rachel is killed when the building explodes. The loss of Rachel, in addition to his own disfigurement, drives Dent insane and after the Joker's convincing, he becomes the murderous vigilante Two-Face, seeking revenge on those he holds responsible for her death. Upon Rachel's death, Alfred reads her note (which she deliberately left unsealed) in which she reveals that she intends to marry Dent. She explains that while Gotham may come to no longer need Batman, she now knows that the day when Bruce no longer does will never come. She urges Bruce not to give up faith in other people, even if she has disappointed him. When Bruce relates to Alfred that his only solace is the knowledge that she would have waited for him, Alfred decides to burn the note, sparing Bruce the pain of the truth. =The Dark Knight Rises (2012)= Rachel is mentioned several times throughout The Dark Knight Rises. Additionally, a picture of her appears in Wayne Manor, in Gyllenhaal's likeness. Bruce, having given up the mantle of Batman, is portrayed as still mourning Rachel eight years after her death, rarely leaving Wayne Manor. When Bane (Tom Hardy) attacks Gotham, Bruce decides to become Batman once more to save the city. In an attempt to stop him, Alfred finally confesses to Bruce that Rachel chose Dent and that he burned the letter in order to spare Bruce the pain. This revelation puts a severe strain on Bruce's relationship with Alfred, who then leaves Wayne Manor when Bruce decides to continue as Batman. Despite this, Bruce is able to temporarily move on from Rachel when he and Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) spend the night together, but is heartbroken yet again when she is revealed to be Ra's al Ghul's daughter Talia, who manipulated his emotions to avenge her father's death. Bruce also shares a flirtatious relationship with Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) throughout the film that develops into love. By the end of the film, Bruce and Selina, who faked their deaths to leave Gotham, have begun a relationship, and Bruce has passed his legacy as Gotham's protector to Detective John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), also proving Rachel wrong in her belief that he won't give up being Batman.

It legalized homosexual acts, on the condition that they were consensual, in private and between two men who had attained the age of 21. The Act applied only to England and Wales. The law was extended to Scotland by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 and to Northern Ireland by the Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982. Background Homosexual activity between men had been illegal for centuries. There was never an explicit ban on homosexual activity between women. In the 1950s, there was an increase of prosecutions against homosexual men and several well- known figures had been convicted. The government set up a committee led by John Wolfenden to consider the laws on homosexuality. In 1957, the committee published the Wolfenden report, which recommended the decriminalisation of homosexual activity between men above the age of 21. The position was summarised by the committee as follows: \\"unless a deliberate attempt be made by society through the agency of the law to equate the sphere of crime with that of sin, there must remain a realm of private that is in brief, not the law's business.\\" However, the government of Harold Macmillan did not act upon its recommendations, due to fears of public backlash. In 1965, several politicians sponsored a Sexual Offences Bill, a private member's bill which drew heavily upon the findings of the Wolfenden report. The key sponsors were Humphry Berkeley, a Conservative MP, Leo Abse, a Labour MP, and Lord Arran, a Conservative peer. By that year, public opinion had shifted in favour. A 1965 opinion poll commissioned by the Daily Mail found that 63% of respondents did not believe that homosexuality should be a crime while only 36% agreed, even though 93% agreed that homosexual men were \\"in need of medical or psychiatric treatment.\\" Legislation and debate By 1965, a majority of MPs in the House of Commons were also sympathetic to changing the law. Berkeley's bill passed a second reading 164‚Äî107 in February 1966. Its passage was interrupted by the dissolution of Parliament for the 1966 general election. Berkeley lost his seat, but the election increased the number of MPs who were likely to support the bill. Abse became the bill's main sponsor and he re-introduced the bill. By 1967, the government of Harold Wilson was showing support for the bill. The decriminalisation of homosexuality was one of multiple liberal social reforms to be passed under Wilson's 1966-70 government and the wider move towards a \\"permissive society\\". Other reforms of the era included the legalisation of abortion the same year, the relaxation of divorce laws and the abolition of theatre censorship and capital punishment. These reforms arose due to several separate campaigns benefitting from growing public support and Labour's large majority, rather than from central government leadership. The proposal legalised acts that met the conditions of being between two consenting adults in private. It did not apply to the Merchant Navy or the Armed Forces, nor to Scotland and Northern Ireland. As with the Wolfenden report's proposal, the bill set the age of consent for homosexual activity to 21, five years higher than for heterosexual activity. It did not delete the offences of buggery and gross indecency. Men could still be prosecuted for these offences if their actions did not meet the strict requirements of the bill. At the time, most proponents of the bill did not condone homosexuality, but instead argued that it was not within the responsibility of the criminal law to penalise homosexual men, who were already the object of ridicule and derision. The comments of Roy Jenkins, Home Secretary at the time, captured the government's attitude: \\"those who suffer from this disability carry a great weight of shame all their lives\\" (quoted during parliamentary debate by The Times on 4 July 1967). Both the major parties permitted a conscience vote. Labour and Liberal members were mostly in favour, while Conservative members were mostly opposed. The divide cut through party ranks, with Margaret Thatcher and Enoch Powell among the Conservative members voting in favour. The coalition in favour of the bill was later described as \\"a combination of Gaitskellites and future Thatcherites.\\" The bill was also supported by the senior leaders of the Church of England, including Michael Ramsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury. According to gay activist Peter Tatchell, dissent against the bill could be summed up by the Earl of Dudley's 16 June 1966 statement that \\"[homosexuals] are the most disgusting people in the world... Prison is much too good a place for them; in fact, that is a place where many of them like to go‚Äîfor obvious reasons.\\" The Bill received royal assent on 27 July 1967 after an intense late night debate in the House of Commons. Lord Arran, in an attempt to minimise criticisms that the legislation would lead to further public debate and visibility of issues relating to homosexual civil rights made the following qualification to this \\"historic\\" milestone: \\"I ask those [homosexuals] to show their thanks by comporting themselves quietly and with dignity‚Ä¶ any form of ostentatious behaviour now or in the future or any form of public flaunting would be utterly distasteful‚Ä¶ [And] make the sponsors of this bill regret that they had done what they had done\\"(quoted during Royal Assent of the bill by The Times newspaper on 28 July 1967). Legacy In BBC History, Florence Sutcliffe- Braithwaite wrote \\"This was a hugely important moment in the history of homosexuality in Britain ‚Äî but it wasn't a moment of sudden liberation for gay men ‚Äî and nor was it intended to be.\\" One particularly important consequence was the increased freedom of assembly for gay rights groups, leading to an increase in gay rights activism in the 1970s. Conversely, there was a clampdown on the homosexual activities that were not protected by the law in the decade after prosecutions for gross indecency involving males trebled.Europe in The Pink by Peter TatchellHeterosexual Dictatorship by Patrick Higgins, 1996 No subsequent reconsideration of the issue of male homosexuality in statutory law took place in England and Wales until the late 1970s. In 1979, the Home Office Policy Advisory Committee's Working Party report Age of Consent in relation to Sexual Offences recommended that the age of consent for homosexual acts should be 18. This was rejected at the time, in part due to fears that further decriminalisation would serve only to encourage younger men to experiment sexually with other men, a choice that some at the time claimed would place such an individual outside of wider society. The law was extended to Scotland in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980, which took effect on 1 February 1981. As a result of the 1981 European Court of Human Rights case Dudgeon v. United Kingdom, the law was extended to Northern Ireland in the Homosexual Offences (Northern Ireland) Order 1982. In 2020, a Freedom of Information request by journalists at The Mail On Sunday found that the Royal Mint Advisory Committee had rejected plans to issue a commemorative coin to mark the 50th anniversary of the passing of the act in 2015, concluding that it would not be \\"commercially viable\\" due to a perceived \\"lack of appeal\\" for the coin amongst collectors. =Amendments= *The age of consent of 21 for homosexual males set by the 1967 Act was reduced to 18 by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 after an attempt to equalise the age of consent with that of the heterosexual age of consent of 16 introduced as an amendment by the then Conservative MP Edwina Currie narrowly failed. This law also extended the definition of rape to include male rape; until then the latter had been prosecuted as buggery. *In 2000, the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 were invoked to ensure the passage of the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 which equalised that age of consent at 16 for both homosexual and heterosexual behaviours throughout the UK. *The privacy restrictions of the law meant that while two men could have sex, a third person could not participate in the sex or even be present, as well as that the two men could not have sex in a hotel. These restrictions were overturned in the European Court of Human Rights in 2000. *The Sexual Offences Act 2003, though subject to some controversy, overhauled the way sexual offences are dealt with by the police and courts, replacing provisions in the Sexual Offences Act 1956 as well as the 1967 Act. The offences of gross indecency and buggery were repealed from statutory law. As a result of the 2003 Act, the vast majority of the 1967 Act has been repealed.

Born near Antioch, Georgia, in Oglethorpe County, he attended a private academy and graduated from the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, Georgia, with a Bachelor of Arts in 1859 and from the School of Law in 1860. He was admitted to the bar that year and commenced practice in Athens. He grew up on his father David C. Barrow's plantation. While possibly never owning slaves himself, his father owned 81 slaves at the time of the 1860 census, while Middleton Barrow was still living at home. During the Civil War, he entered the Confederate service in 1861 and served throughout the war. He resumed the practice of law in Athens and was a member of the State constitutional convention in 1877. Barrow was a member of the Georgia House of Representatives from 1880 to 1881 and was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1882 to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Benjamin H. Hill, serving from November 15, 1882, to March 3, 1883. He was not a candidate for re-election, and resumed the practice of law in Athens. From January 6, 1902, until his death, he was a judge of the eastern judicial circuit of Georgia, and died in Savannah, Georgia, in December 1903; interment was in a private cemetery on the family plantation in Oglethorpe County. Pope Barrow was a great-grandson of Wilson Lumpkin, a U.S. Senator and a Governor of Georgia, as well as a great-grandfather of U.S. Representative John Barrow. Pope's younger brother, David Crenshaw Barrow, Jr., served as the chancellor of UGA from 1906 until 1925, and Pope Barrow served as a trustee of the university from 1872 until 1889.

Holidays and special events The biggest holidays for Pashtuns are the Islamic Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha, followed by Pakistan Independence Day (August 14). The arrival of Sparlay or spring, known as Nawa-Wraz (New Day), is also celebrated by some Pashtuns. It is an ancient annual Pashtun festival which celebrates both the beginning of spring and the New Year. Amongst some Pashtuns, Sheshbeeyeh, a prelude festival to Nawroz, is also celebrated. This tradition still survives, mainly amongst the southerners, in Bannu and Waziristan. During holidays, Pashtuns set up festivals in which they usually attend mosques to make special prayers, have cookouts in parks, and go to fairs. =Pashto poetry= Afghanistan and Pakhtunkhwa. were noted for its poetic language even before the Islamic conquest of Afghanistan. The Pata Khazana contains Pashto poetry written as far back as the 8th century. Some notable poets from the region of Afghanistan-Pakistan include Pir Roshan, Amir Kror Suri, Khushal Khan Khattak, Rahman Baba, Nazo Tokhi, Ahmad Shah Durrani, Timur Shah Durrani, Shuja Shah Durrani, Ghulam Muhammad Tarzi, and Khan Abdul Ghani Khan.Afghanistan Online, Classical Dari and Pashto Poets Pashtun men usually gather at special events and listen to Pashto poetry. There are TV programs which broadcast such events to the wider Pashtun audiences. One such program is on AVT Khyber channel in Pakhtunkhwa,Pakistan, with Amanullah Kakar as the presenter. Music and dances A man playing a rubab in Farah, Afghanistan Traditional Pashto music is mostly klasik ghazals, using rubab or sitar, tabla, portable harmonium, flute and several other musical instruments. Below is a list of the main known styles of Attan in Pakistan and Afghanistan. All of these may be practiced and mixed by Pashtuns in other valleys, and it's not uncommon to see Pashtuns of one province being better at a different region's style. ; ALA-LC Romanization: Ata·πá, also referred to as Atan or Attan, are the following: =Attan dance= In this dance, the dancers perform to the beat of the music. It is typically performed by men and women. It involves 2‚Äì5 steps, ending with a clap given while facing the center, after which the process is repeated. The hips and arms are put in a sequential movement including left and right tilts, with the wrists twisting in sequence. Ultimately a hand is projected outward and brought in a 'scoop-like' fashion towards the center where the other hand meets it for a clap. This dance is typically performed with the musician dictating the duration and speed. =Attan traditional dance= A group of dancers performing Khattak dance in Pakistan The Khattak dance is performed by the Khattak tribe, mainly in Pakistan but also in some eastern parts of Afghanistan. =Mahsud Attan (dance)= This is a unique dance routine using rifles performed by the Mahsud tribe of Pashtuns in South Waziristan. Originally it was performed at times of war, but later became a cultural dance. The dancers dance empty handed and require only large drums. Nowadays it is performed with guns in the dancers' hands; loaded guns are taken in one hand, and to the beat of the drum the dancers move forward in a circle. After taking two and a half steps, each dancer turns about and cocks the gun. All the dancers do this in a uniform manner, and by completing the turning steps they fire in the air simultaneously. The sound of the guns seems to be a single big bang. =Waziri dance= Waziristan, a region of Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, is a large area and has a particular Pashtun culture. Two drummers and a flute player play a particular tune. All the Wazirs stand around them. Two people leave the circle, go dancing towards the drummers, and come back dancing in the same manner. While performing, both people turn around twice, once facing each other, and once facing the opposite direction. After doing this separately, they march while dancing to the assembled crowd. As they reach the circle, another pair of performers move forward in the same fashion. Clothing Pashtun dress of Pakistan and Afghanistan Pashtun men usually wear a Part≈´g-Kamees in Pashto (sometimes worn with a pakul or pa·π≠kay). In the Kandahar region young men usually wear different type of hat similar to a topi and in the Peshawar region they wear white kufis instead. Leaders or tribal chiefs sometimes wear a karakul hat, like Hamid Karzai and others. The Pashtun L≈´ngai (or Pa·π≠kay) is the most worn headpiece in Afghanistan, with different tribes having different styles and colours to indicate what tribe or region they come from. Women and girls wear traditional long dresses and cover their hair with a light piece of cloth. Cuisine Pashtun cuisine varies among districts in Afghanistan. Pashtuns are known for their large varieties of dried fruit and yogurt based dishes. Yogurt called 'maasta' is usually made by the Pashtuns themselves in their own homes. The national dish of Afghanistan is \\"Qabili Pulaw\\" and is served in the Pashtun areas of Pakistan as well. Chai (tea) plays a big role in Pashtun gatherings and is served with dried fruits and kulcha (biscuit). Desserts such as firni (custard) are also very popular. Sport =Cricket= =Football= =Buzkashi and polo= Some Pashtuns in Central Asia participate in buzkashi, which is a sport introduced in the region during the Mongol period from the 13th century onward. The word buz means \\"goat\\" and kashi means \\"dragging\\" or \\"pulling\\" in the Persian language. The basic objective is to carry the headless carcass of a calf or goat around a flag and back to the starting point while on horseback with other riders trying to do the same thing by taking the carcass away. This is not a team sport, it is every man for himself, which becomes apparent as soon as the game starts. It is played on a large open dusty field which does not appear to have many boundaries. The game is a microcosm of power politics in Afghanistan. Although buskashi is primarily an individual sport, alliances are built up between various players. Between the alliances, the strongest players finally take control (or in this case the remnants of a headless calf) and ride off to victory.

Their unique appearance and uniform body plan makes them easy to distinguish from other crustaceans. They live in soft-bottoms such as mud and sand, mostly in the marine environment. There are more than 1,500 species of cumaceans formally described. The species diversity of Cumacea increases with depth. Anatomy General body plan of a cumacean Cumaceans have a strongly enlarged cephalothorax with a carapace, a slim abdomen, and a forked tail. The length of most species varies from . The carapace of a typical cumacean is composed of several fused dorsal head parts and the first three somites of the thorax. This carapace encloses the appendages that serve for respiration and feeding. In most species, there are two eyes at the front side of the head shield, often merged into a single dorsal eye lobe. The five posterior somites of the thorax form the pereon. The pleon (abdomen) consists of six cylindrical somites. The first antenna (antennule) has two flagella, the outer flagellum usually being longer than the inner one. The second antenna is strongly reduced in females, and consists of numerous segments in males. Cumaceans have six pairs of mouthparts: one pair of mandibles, one pair of maxillules, one pair of maxillae and three pairs of maxillipeds. Ecology Bodotria scorpioides Cumaceans are mainly marine crustaceans. However, some species can survive in water with a lower salinity, like brackish water (e.g. estuaries). In the Caspian Sea they even reach some rivers that flow into it. A few species live in the intertidal zone. Most species live only one year or less, and reproduce twice in their lifetime. Deep-sea species have a slower metabolism and presumably live much longer. Cumaceans feed mainly on microorganisms and organic material from the sediment. Species that live in the mud filter their food, while species that live in sand browse individual grains of sand. In the genus Campylaspis and a few related genera, the mandibles are transformed into piercing organs, which can be used for predation on foraminiferans and small crustaceans. Many shallow-water species show a diurnal cycle, with males emerging from the sediment at night and swarming to the surface. Importance Like Amphipoda, cumaceans are an important food source for many fishes. Therefore, they are an important part of the marine food chain. They can be found on all continents. Reproduction and development Pseudocuma longicorne Cumaceans are a clear example of sexual dimorphism: males and females differ significantly in their appearance. Both sexes have different ornaments (setation, knobs, and ridges) on their carapace. Other differences are the length of the second antenna, the existence of pleopods in males, and the development of a marsupium (brood pouch) in females. There are generally more females than males, and females are also larger than their male counterparts. Cumaceans are epimorphic, which means that the number of body segments does not change during development. This is a form of incomplete metamorphosis. Females carry the embryos in their marsupium for some time. The larvae leave the marsupium in the manca stage, in which they are almost fully grown and are only missing their last pair of pereiopods. History of research The order Cumacea has been known since 1780, when Ivan Ivanovich Lepechin described the species \\"Oniscus scorpioides\\" (now Diastylis scorpioides). At the time, many scientists thought that the cumaceans were larval stages of decapods. In 1846, they were recognised as a separate order by Henrik Nikolaj Kr√∏yer. Twenty-five years later, about fifty different species had been described, and currently there are more than 1,500 described species. The German zoologist Carl Wilhelm Erich Zimmer studied the order Cumacea very intensively. Fossil record The fossil record of cumaceans is very sparse, but extends back into the Mississippian age. Fossil Cumaceans from the early Jurassic scarcely differ from living forms (Bacescu & Petrescu 1999).Sarah Gerken, 'Cumaceans of the World: Cumacean morphology . Taxonomy Diversity of forms as shown here in six of the extant families. (a) Bodotriidae, (b) Diastylidae, (c) Leuconidae, (d) Lampropidae, (e) Nannastacidae, (f) Pseudocumatidae Cumaceans belong to the superorder Peracarida, within the class Malacostraca. The order Cumacea is subdivided into 8 families, 141 genera, and 1,523 species: *Bodotriidae Scott, 1901 (379 species in 36 genera) *Ceratocumatidae Calman, 1905 (10 species in 2 genera) *Diastylidae Bate, 1856 (318 species in 22 genera) *Gynodiastylidae Stebbing, 1912 (106 species in 12 genera) *Lampropidae Sars, 1878 (114 species in 15 genera) *Leuconidae Sars, 1878 (139 species in 16 genera) *Nannastacidae Bate, 1866 (426 species in 25 genera) *Pseudocumatidae Sars, 1878 (30 species in 12 genera) One species is also placed incertae sedis in the order.

Joseph D. Brokhage (1964) The Latin School of Indianapolis served from 1955 to 1978 as a pre-seminary boys' high school for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis. In its first two academic years, the Latin School operated as part of Cathedral High School, an all-boys Catholic high school founded in 1918. The first class had 24 boys enrolled. During those two years, the school was named the Cathedral Latin School. In its third academic year, the Latin School moved into dedicated facilities, consisting of four classrooms attached to the Holy Rosary Church at 520 Stevens Street. The name was changed to Bishop Brut√© Latin School after Simon Brut√©, the first Bishop of the Diocese of Vincennes, which at the time included all of Indiana. Father Joseph D. Brokhage (S.T.D., ordained 1939, Monsignor 1964) served as both rector of the school and pastor of Holy Rosary parish. Under his leadership, the school grew steadily and added a large wing of classrooms, a recreation room and a gymnasium/auditorium along Stevens Street. An ambitious program was launched in 1963 to build a group of dormitories for out-of-town students. This plan was only partially carried out. The first dormitory, Dugan Hall, was built with funds provided by the Latin School Foundation, a foundation started by the District Council of Catholic Men. Dugan Hall was named for Msgr. Henry Dugan, who had been a member of the advisory board when the school was founded. Students at Mass in Holy Rosary Church (1965). After that academic year, students wore the schoolday standard to church services: collared shirt, dresspants and tie.  Academics  The concept of the Latin School originated with Brokhage, who modeled the school academically after the Boston Latin School, the oldest public school in America. The Indianapolis Latin School differed from the Boston school, because it prepared high school boys to enter seminary, principally the St. Meinrad Seminary and Benedictine Archabbey in southern Indiana. The school attained a high degree of academic rigor and boasted a classical-style curriculum along with Church related subjects. For a period, Latin was a required course for all four years at Latin School. Greek was required during senior year until 1966. The majority of the instructors were priests from the Archdiocese, who taught in their areas of specialization.  Closing  In 1978, the Archdiocese closed the school, because enrollment had decreased from 154 students in 1971 to 80 students in 1972. Sharply rising costs were another factor.  Legacy  About 500 young men were graduated from Latin School since its founding. 86 were ordained as priests by the Archdiocese of Indianapolis. The former Latin School facility now houses Lumen Christi Catholic School, which was established in 2003.

The mill is a Grade I listed building. It is a three-storey building constructed from wood; externally it is clad in white Suffolk boarding and has a Gambrel roof. Its machinery reflects the skills and achievements of the early Industrial Revolution. It has been preserved and is open to the public. The reservoir constructed for demonstration purposes is roughly half an acre in extent, the original one is now a marina. History Interior of the Tide Mill The first recording of a tide mill on this site was a medieval mill in 1170; it is unknown how many mills have stood here, but probably three. The mill, which was operated by the local Augustinian priory in the Middle Ages, was acquired by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. It is possible that the Augustinians rebuilt the mill shortly before the dissolution. This mill and the former Woodbridge Priory was granted to Thomas Seckford by Elizabeth I. That mill passed through the hands of various private owners until it was rebuilt in the seventeenth century. This is the mill preserved today. By the outbreak of World War II the mill was one of only a handful still operating. In 1957 it closed as the last commercially operating tide mill in Britain. In 1968 the derelict mill was purchased by Mrs Jean Gardner and a restoration programme was launched. It was opened to the public five years later in 1973. It is now managed by a charitable trust (Woodbridge Tide Mill Trust) staffed by volunteers, and in 2011 the trust undertook a further and more complete restoration and modernisation project, including a new water wheel and fully restored machinery, which allowed milling to begin again. It re-opened in 2012 and is now one of only two tide mills in the UK that regularly grinds wheat grain producing wholemeal flour for resale.

A three-time British champion (2009, 2013 and 2014), he holds the record for being the youngest Briton ever to achieve the title of Grandmaster, earned at the age of 16.  Early life  Howell was born in Eastbourne to Angeline (originally from Singapore) and Martin Howell. He has a younger sister and lives with his family in Seaford, East Sussex.  Career  Howell has been playing chess since the age of five years and eight months, following his father's purchase of a second-hand chess set at a jumble sale. He quickly learned to defeat his father and soon came to the attention of the Sussex Junior Chess Association, where he received tuition from a number of established county players. He progressed rapidly and became the British champion in the age categories Under 8, Under 9 and Under 10. In August 1999, Howell became famous internationally when he broke the world record for the youngest player to have defeated a Grandmaster in an official game. Aged 8, he defeated John Nunn in a blitz game at the Mind Sports Olympiad. \\"Chess Star is Born, aged 8\\", The Guardian, 30 August 1999, Leonard Barden Howell still holds this record. He is also the youngest player in the world to have qualified to compete in a national chess championship, taking part in the British Chess Championship in August 2000. He came fourth in the Player of the Year ballot held by the British Chess Federation during 2000. In 2001, Howell came joint first at the European Youth Chess Championships in the Under 12 category and joint second at the World Youth Chess Championships in the same category. In the Hastings Challengers tournament in January 2001, Howell became the youngest ever British player to defeat a grandmaster at classical time controls when he beat Colin McNab. In March 2002, Howell drew the last of four games with the Einstein Group World Champion, Vladimir Kramnik, becoming the youngest player in the world to score against a reigning world chess champion in an organised chess match. The resulting publicity led to articles in all the main British national newspapers and appearances on CBBC, Channel 4 News, and Richard & Judy. The extensive coverage he received as the UK's most gifted young chess player also spread to appearances on Breakfast TV, Blue Peter, Nickelodeon, Good Morning America, and several local news programmes. At a televised awards show for Britain's most talented youngsters, he was presented an award by Patrick Moore. Progress was perhaps more measured during his early to mid teens, but Howell continued to meet all the milestone challenges, first gaining the International Master title, and culminating in becoming a grandmaster at the age of sixteen, the youngest ever in the UK. Along the way, he performed well at the Hastings knockout-style tournament (2004‚Äì5 edition), where he was eliminated at the quarter-final (round 5) stage by the strong Polish GM Bartosz Soƒáko. Despite his sustained efforts at the chequered board, he continued to study for his French, German (fluent in both) and Maths A-levels, at Eastbourne College.David Howell becomes a grandmaster at 16. ChessBase.com. 6 January 2007. His chess coaching with grandmaster Glenn Flear was sponsored by JEB (Hove) Ltd, the software developer responsible for the BITEM event management website. There were also training sessions with Nigel Short, who has worked with other successful juniors such as Pentala Harikrishna, Sergey Karjakin and Parimarjan Negi. He obtained the three norms required for the title Grandmaster (GM) between 2004 and 2007; these comprised the 4NCL team tournament (season 2004/5), the CCA-ICC International at New York City 2005 and Stockholm's Rilton Cup 2006/7. In this latter tournament he tied for second place, qualifying for the grandmaster title on 5 January 2007, aged 16. By doing so, Howell broke Luke McShane's record as the youngest grandmaster ever from UK, set in 2000, by six months. Since becoming a grandmaster in 2007, Howell has participated in a variety of competitions; he took a share of fourth place in the British championship that year and went on to scoop the English Chess Federation's Player of the Year Award. A significant rise in his Elo rating followed his achievements of 2008, beginning with victory at the Andorra Open, where he scored 8/9 points, ahead of experienced grandmasters Julio Granda Zu√±iga and Mihail Marin. He followed this with a share of third place at the World Junior Chess Championship in Gaziantep, where he was always challenging for the lead. At the very strong EU Individual Open Chess Championship in Liverpool he finished with a share of fifth place despite a loss on time and then went on to win the annual Winterthur Masters event, ahead of other grandmasters, among them former Paraguayan champion Axel Bachmann and former Swiss champions Joseph Gallagher and Florian Jenni.TWIC 727 by Mark Crowther - Item 10 At the Chess Olympiad of 2008, held in Dresden, he joined the England team on board 3 and contributed 7¬Ω/11 for a tournament performance rating (TPR) of 2675. Howell was the British Rapidplay Chess Champion in 2008 with a score of 10/11 points, and in 2009 with 9/11. He tied for first with Andrei IstrƒÉ»õescu, Romain Edouard and Mark Hebden in the 2009/10 Hastings International Chess Congress. In August 2009, Howell won the British championship for the first time scoring 9/11. He placed third in the London Chess Classic in December. He won the British Rapidplay Chess Championship again in 2010 with a score of 10¬Ω/11. In 2012 Howell won the Leiden Chess Tournament. In August 2013 Howell won his second British championship title with 9¬Ω/11 points. The following year he shared first place with Jonathan Hawkins in the 101st British Chess Championship. Howell took clear second place at the 2015 Gibraltar Masters tournament with a score of 8/10, half point behind Hikaru Nakamura. In December 2015, Howell won the inaugural British Knockout Championship, held alongside the 7th London Chess Classic, by defeating in the final Nicholas Pert 4‚Äì2. In the FIDE rating list of August 2015 he reached a rating of 2712 and thus joined the ranks of the 2700+ players for the first time.

Muddler minnow fly Origin The Muddler Minnow was originated by Don Gapen of Anoka, Minnesota in 1936, to imitate the slimy sculpin and fool large brook trout in the Nipigon River. Gapen tied the fly by lantern light in his camp, using materials available in his portable kit, after watching First Nations guides capture sculpins and explain to him their importance as forage for the large, piscivorous trout in the Nipigon. Gapen was the son of resort operators Jesse and Sue Gapen who ran the Gateway Lodge Resort on Hungry Jack Lake in what is now the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in the 1920s. In 1936, the Gapens opened a second resort, the Chalet Bungalow Lodge, on the Nipigon River in Ontario to be operated by Don. In 1937 Gapen developed this fly to catch Nipigon strain brook trout, Ontario, Canada. The Muddler, as it is informally known by anglers, was popularized by Montana, United States fisherman and fly tier Dan Bailey. It is now a popular pattern worldwide and is likely found in nearly every angler's fly box, in one form or another. On March 14, 2008, a size 4 muddler minnow was used by Dr. Brian Yamamoto of Fairbanks, Alaska to catch a 41.66 lbs., 46 inch-long brown trout in Argentina's Rio Grande. Imitations The versatility of the Muddler Minnow stems from this pattern's ability to mimic a variety of aquatic and terrestrial forage, ranging from sculpins, to crayfish to leeches, to grasshoppers, crickets, spent mayflies, emerging green drakes, stonefly nymphs, mice, tadpoles, dace, shiners, chubs, and other \\"minnows,\\" along with a host of other creatures. It's mottled appearance matches many terrestrial and aquatic lifeforms, enabling it to mimic without imitating. Construction A Muddler Minnow fishing fly tied by Don Gapen, the originator of the patternThere are limitless material and colour variations, however the essence of the Muddler Minnow is a spun deer hair head. While each Muddler may differ in colour or profile, all true Muddlers have a fore-end or body of spun deer hair that is clipped close to the shank to provide a buoyant head. Typically there is an underwing of squirrel hair and a wing of mottled secondary turkey feather. Often the fly body is made of gold/silver Mylar or tinsel wrapped around the hook shank. Marabou may be tied in as a substitute wing for colour and lifelike movement through the water. The head may be weighted or unweighted, according to the style of fishing, the target species and the intended imitation. The muddler has served for the basis of several patterns, including the Spuddler, Muddler Hopper, Mizzoulian Spook, Searcy Muddler, Keel Muddler, and so on, but even in its simplest and original form, it remains a very effective fly. Besides the traditional deer hair, many Muddlers are tied today with heads made of antelope, spun wool, dubbing, chenille, or other materials. Whether they should properly be called Muddlers is a moot point. Note that the fly pictured in the top of the article, while typical, is not a traditional Muddler Minnow. The traditional Muddler uses brown mottled turkey quill segments for both tail and wing. It also seems to lack the underwing of gray squirrel tail. As originally tied by Don Gapen (and as still tied by The Gapen Company today), the Muddler Minnow's head was sparse and \\"raggedy,\\" the head and collar being fashioned from a single clump of deer hair. The dense head featured on most of today's Muddlers was the invention of Dan Bailey, ca. 1950, because Muddlers were mainly used to imitate large grasshoppers out West back in the 1950s, Target species Muddler patterns are generally effective when fishing for any freshwater or saltwater species in cold or warm water environments. This pattern is most often used to catch all species of trout, steelhead, Arctic char, large grayling, both Atlantic and Pacific salmon, taimen, lenok, smallmouth and largemouth bass, pike, redfish (red drum), tarpon, and almost anything else that swims. Fishing the Muddler Effective retrieval tactics include stripping the floating Muddler across the water surface rhythmically, imparting a \\"wake\\", or allowing the Muddler to sink and twitching or pulsating it against or across a river's current. An unweighted Muddler will float and appears as a hopper, moth or struggling mouse. With a tiny piece of split shot in front of it (or an intermediate flyline) the Muddler can be made to swim slowly over weedbeds and shallow gravel bars. With more weight, the Muddler can be stripped wildly in the shallows to imitate and alarmed baitfish, or allowed to settle in deeper water. When weighted‚Äîeither on the fly itself, with split shot, or a sinking leader or line‚Äîthe Muddler may be fished right on the bottom to effectively imitate a sculpin. When imitating sculpins, Muddlers must be kept right on the bottom and fished slowly, with occasional fast strips of maybe a foot to a yard, as if trying to escape a predator. Tied on salmon hooks in sizes 2 to 10, the Muddler (and don't forget the Marabou Muddler) is an excellent fly for Atlantic salmon. It can be fished on the swing, like a typical salmon wet fly or it can be fished in the surface film as a waking fly. Use of the Portland Creek riffle hitch is desirable, but not entirely necessary, to effectively wake a Muddler. Muddlers tied on salmon double hooks are particularly good waking flies. Know that salmon will often follow the waking fly and will not take until the end of the waking drift. For this reason, it's always a good idea to let the Muddler wobble in the current at the bottom of the drift and twitch it a few times before casting again. (This is also a good technique for trout, especially large trout.) References * Peter Gathercole (2003). The fly-tying bible: 100 deadly trout and salmon flies in step-by-step photographs.

Anderson also served as the first counselor to general Primary president Louie B. Felt from 1905 to 1925. Early life Anderson was born in Liverpool, England, the third of Scott Anderson and Mary Bruce's 12 children. She emigrated to Utah Territory with her family after the family had been baptized by missionaries of the LDS Church. During the journey to Utah, Anderson met Louie B. Felt, who would become a lifelong friend and co-worker in the Primary Association of the church. Involvement with the Primary Association Louie Felt (right) and May Anderson (left) On October 5, 1890, Louie B. Felt, the general president of the Primary Association, asked Anderson to become a member of the general board of the organization. For the next forty-nine years, Anderson would work in some capacity in the Primary organization of the LDS Church. She was the general board's secretary for fifteen years (1890‚Äì1905), Felt's first counselor in the general presidency for twenty years (1905‚Äì25), and general president of the organization for fourteen years (1925‚Äì39). Anderson was also the first editor-in-chief of The Children's Friend, the church's official magazine for children. During her tenure in the presidency of the Primary, Anderson initiated the Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, which is today part of Intermountain Healthcare. Anderson also helped establish kindergartens in Utah. Anderson's successor to the Primary general presidency was May Green Hinckley. Anderson did not marry and died at Salt Lake City of arteriosclerosis.State of Utah Death Certificate She was buried at Salt Lake City. Relationship with Louie Felt Anderson had a lifelong friendship with fellow church leader Louie B. Felt. When Felt was suffering an illness in 1889, Felt's husband Joseph requested May to stay there to care for her while he was away on a business trip.

Benson and Martin J. \\"Red\\" Beckman which claims that the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, commonly known as the income tax amendment, was never properly ratified. In 2007, and again in 2009, Benson's contentions were ruled to be fraudulent.  Background  Under Article V of the U.S. Constitution, an amendment proposed by Congress must be ratified by three-fourths of the states to become part of the Constitution. The Article permits Congress to specify, for each amendment, whether the ratification must be by each state's legislature or by a constitutional convention in each state; for the Sixteenth Amendment, Congress specified ratification by the legislatures. There were 48 states in the Union in 1913 ‚Äî the year when the Sixteenth Amendment was finally ratified ‚Äî which meant that the Amendment required ratification by the legislatures of 36 states to become effective. In February 1913, Secretary of State Philander C. Knox issued a proclamation that 38 states had ratified the amendment. According to Congressional analysis, a total of 42 states had ratified the amendment as of 1992.Senate Document No. 103-6 (1992 ed.), Analysis and Interpretation of the Constitution; Annotations of Cases Decided by the Supreme Court of the United States (United States Government Printing Office).  Contentions  Prior to Benson, the \\"non-ratification\\" argument was presented by James Walter Scott in the 1975 case of United States v. Scott, some sixty-two years after the ratification. Scott's argument was to no avail; he was convicted of willful failure to file federal income tax returns for the years 1969 through 1972, and the conviction was upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.United States v. Scott, 521 F.2d 1188 (9th Cir. 1975). In a 1977 case involving a tax protester named Bob Tammen, a U.S. District Court noted that Tammen was involved with a group called \\"United Tax Action Patriots,\\" which took the position \\"that the Sixteenth Amendment was improperly passed and therefore invalid....\\" However, the specific issue of the validity of the ratification was neither presented to nor decided by the court.See Ex parte Tammen, 438 F. Supp. 349, 78-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9302 (N.D. Tex. 1977), at . William Benson's book relates how, in 1984, nine years after the Scott case and seventy-one years after the ratification was proclaimed, Benson began a research project to investigate the ratification process by traveling to the National Archives and the capitols of various New England states to review documents relating to the ratification of the Amendment. Benson found variations in wording, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization in the language of the Amendment as ratified by many states. He used the changes as part of the basis for his contention that those states had not properly ratified the Amendment. Benson further claimed to have found documents suggesting that some states that had been certified as having ratified the Amendment never voted to ratify it, or voted against ratification. Benson claimed that no states, or only a few states (variously reported as two states or four states), had properly ratified the Amendment. In his book, Benson made the following claims: *Seven states (Connecticut, Florida, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Virginia) did not ratify the amendment, and it was reported as such. *Two states (Kentucky and Tennessee) did not ratify the amendment, but Secretary Knox reported that they did. *Eight states (Delaware, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont and Wyoming) were reported by Secretary Knox as having ratified the amendment, but the States actually have missing or incomplete records of the ratification procedures or votes, and there is no conclusive record that they ratified the amendment or reported any ratification to the Secretary of State. *Six states (Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington) did approve the amendment, but the Governor or another official who was required by their respective state constitutions to sign the legislation into law did not sign the legislation. *In twenty-five states (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming), the legislature violated a provision of its state constitution during the ratification process. *Twenty-nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia and Wyoming) violated \\"state law\\" or procedural rules during the ratification process. Additionally, Benson asserted that: *Twenty-two states approved the amendment, but with changes in wording, and the inexact version was accepted as a ratification of the original version. *One state approved the amendment, but with variations in spelling, and the inexact version was accepted as a ratification of the original version. *At least twenty-six states approved the amendment, but with changes in punctuation, and the inexact version was accepted as a ratification of the original version. Benson asserted that the Oklahoma State Legislature changed the wording of the amendment they approved so that it meant the opposite of the original amendment as it was submitted to the States by Congress, but that Secretary Knox counted Oklahoma as having approved the amendment. Benson also asserted, as an example of a state's violation of its own Constitution, laws, or procedural rules, the claim that the Tennessee State Constitution prohibited the legislature from acting on any proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution submitted by Congress until after the next state legislative elections. According to Benson, the Tennessee legislature acted on the proposed 16th amendment the same month it was received (prior to any new state legislative elections).  Legal status of Benson's claims  The Benson book was published in 1985. The earliest reported court cases where the book was mentioned appear to be United States v. House617 F. Supp. 237, 87-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9562 (W.D. Mich. 1985). and United States v. Wojtas.611 F. Supp. 118 (N.D. Ill. 1985). Benson testified unsuccessfully in the House case. In the latter case, defendant Wayne Wojtas was unsuccessful in his attempt to use Benson's theory to have his indictment for failure to file federal tax returns dismissed. In the case the judge ruled that Benson's evidence was inadmissible, stating that: Wojtas was convicted, sentenced to prison, and released in August 1986.Wayne Francis Wojtas, inmate # 93604-024, Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Dep't of Justice, at . Benson's claim was also rejected in Miller v. United States.868 F.2d 236 89-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9184 (7th Cir. 1989) (per curiam). The court stated, \\"We find it hard to understand why the long and unbroken line of cases upholding the constitutionality of the Sixteenth Amendment generally, Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company ... and those specifically rejecting the argument advanced in The Law That Never Was, have not persuaded Miller and his compatriots to seek a more effective forum for airing their attack on the federal income tax structure.\\" The court then sanctioned the litigants for advancing a \\"patently frivolous\\" position. Similar \\"Sixteenth Amendment arguments\\" have been uniformly rejected by the courts in other cases including United States v. Thomas.788 F.2d 1250, 1252 (7th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 853, 107 S. Ct. 187 (1986), at . See also United States v. Thomas, 934 F.2d 840 (7th Cir. 1991), at . In Thomas the court, in affirming the tax convictions of Kenneth L. Thomas, referred to Benson's book and noted that the errors found by Benson had already been investigated by Secretary of State Knox at the time of ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment, and had been determined to be insignificant. (See Tax protester constitutional arguments.) Arguments that the Sixteenth Amendment was not properly ratified were also rejected in Sisk v. Commissioner;791 F.2d 58, 86-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9433 (6th Cir. 1986). United States v. Sitka;845 F.2d 43, 88-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9308 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 827 (1988). and United States v. Stahl.792 F.2d 1438, 86-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9518 (9th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 107 S. Ct. 888 (1987). See generally United States v. Hempfling, 431 F. Supp. 2d 1069 (E.D. Calif. 2006). The non-ratification argument has also been deemed legally frivolous in Brown v. Commissioner53 T.C.M. (CCH) 94, T.C. Memo 1987-78, CCH Dec. 43,696(M) (1987). and Lysiak v. Commissioner.816 F.2d 311, 87-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 9296 (7th Cir. 1987). The argument that the Sixteenth Amendment was not ratified, and variations of this argument, have been officially identified as legally frivolous federal income tax return positions for purposes of the $5,000 frivolous tax return penalty imposed under Internal Revenue Code section 6702(a)., as amended by section 407 of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-432, 120 Stat. 2922 (Dec. 20, 2006). See Notice 2008-14, item 9j, I.R.B. 2008-4 (Jan. 14, 2008), Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Department of the Treasury (superseding Notice 2007-30).  Benson's federal income tax problems  In United States v. Benson,941 F.2d 598, 91-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 50,437 (7th Cir. 1991). a criminal case, Benson himself raised the Sixteenth Amendment argument, which was rejected by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In this phase of the case, his conviction for tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns was overturned on other grounds and the case was remanded to the trial court. Upon retrial, Benson was again convicted of tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns, and his conviction was upheld on appeal. The conduct for which he was convicted involved over $100,000 of income he did not report on Federal income tax returns. He was sentenced to four years in prison and five years of probation.United States v. Benson, 67 F.3d 641, 95-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¬∂ 50,540 (7th Cir. 1995). Benson continued to promote his views. Until early 2008, Benson included verbiage on his web sitein quotation marksthat he attributed to the text of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, an early case interpreting the Amendment. He quoted the Court as saying that the Sixteenth Amendment \\"did not change the constitutional limitations which forbid any direct taxation of individuals.\\"Retrieved on 22 November 2006 from http://www.thelawthatneverwas.com/new/ratification.asp The text of the Court's decision does not contain any such quotation.See Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad, 240 U.S. 1 (1916); text available at http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court;=us&vol;=240&page;=1 No U.S. Federal court has ever ruled that any provision of the United States Constitution forbids any direct taxation of individuals. Benson apparently removed the material after a court order was issued regarding his materials. Until January 2008, Benson's web site also stated: \\"After serving time in federal prison for not paying his United States income taxes, Bill Benson still does not pay income taxes and yet our federal government chooses not to arrest him. Why? Because now he can use this book, which he has written : 'THE LAW THAT NEVER WAS' in his defense.\\"The statement was found at the caption near Benson's picture at bottom of web page. Retrieved on 22 November 2006 from . As of January 30, 2008, after the issuance of a permanent injunction against Benson (see below), this language apparently was removed. Similarly, as late as the year 2007, Benson claimed, in marketing the \\"Reliance Defense Package\\" that included his non-ratification argument, that \\"[t]o date, the IRS has steadfastly refused to prosecute any person standing on this defense. Why do they do this? Because they know they cannot win!!\\"As quoted in the court decision on April 6, 2009, at entry 58, p. 8 United States v. Benson, case no. 08-1312 and case no. 08-1586, United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The book was actually published several years before Benson's arrest and, as noted above, Benson himself actually was convicted despite using the defense.

This type of reaction is subdivided in Norrish type I reactions and Norrish type II reactions.Named Organic Reactions, 2nd Edition, Thomas Laue and Andreas Plagens, John Wiley & Sons: Chichester, England, New York, 2005. 320 pp. The reaction is named after Ronald George Wreyford Norrish.  Type I  The Norrish type I reaction is the photochemical cleavage or homolysis of aldehydes and ketones into two free radical intermediates. The carbonyl group accepts a photon and is excited to a photochemical singlet state. Through intersystem crossing the triplet state can be obtained. On cleavage of the Œ±-carbon bond from either state, two radical fragments are obtained. The size and nature of these fragments depends upon the stability of the generated radicals; for instance, the cleavage of 2-butanone largely yields ethyl radicals in favor of less stable methyl radicals. Norrish type I reaction Several secondary reaction modes are open to these fragments depending on the exact molecular structure. * The fragments can simply recombine to the original carbonyl compound, with racemisation at the Œ±-carbon. * The acyl radical can lose a molecule of carbon monoxide, forming a new carbon radical at the other Œ±-carbon, followed by formation of a new carbon‚Äìcarbon bond between the radicals. The ultimate effect is simple extraction of the carbonyl unit from the carbon chain. The rate and yield of this product depends upon the bond-dissociation energy of the ketone's Œ± substituents. Typically the more Œ± substituted a ketone is, the more likely the reaction will yield products in this way. * The abstraction of an Œ±-proton from the carbonyl fragment may form a ketene and an alkane. * The abstraction of a Œ≤-proton from the alkyl fragment may form an aldehyde and an alkene. Norrish type I reaction The synthetic utility of this reaction type is limited, for instance it often is a side reaction in the Patern√≤‚ÄìB√ºchi reaction. One organic synthesis based on this reaction is that of bicyclohexylidene.Bicyclohexylidene Nicholas J. Turro, Peter A. Leermakers, and George F. Vesley Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 5, p.297 (1973); Vol. 47, p.34 (1967) Online article. Type II A Norrish type II reaction is the photochemical intramolecular abstraction of a Œ≥-hydrogen (a hydrogen atom three carbon positions removed from the carbonyl group) by the excited carbonyl compound to produce a 1,4-biradical as a primary photoproduct. Norrish first reported the reaction in 1937. Norrish type II reaction Secondary reactions that occur are fragmentation to form an enol and an alkene, or intramolecular recombination of the two radicals to a substituted cyclobutane (the Norrish‚ÄìYang reaction). Scope The Norrish reaction has been studied in relation to environmental chemistry with respect to the photolysis of the aldehyde heptanal, a prominent compound in Earth's atmosphere.Photolysis of Heptanal Suzanne E.

Norrish application nanogold synthesis Paquette's 1982 synthesis of dodecahedrane involves three separate Norrish- type reactions in its approximately 29-step sequence. An example of a synthetically useful Norrish type II reaction can be found early in the total synthesis of the biologically active cardenolide ouabagenin by Baran and coworkers. The optimized conditions minimize side reactions, such as the competing Norrish type I pathway, and furnish the desired intermediate in good yield on a multi-gram scale.

L. Stine. It was adapted into a two-part episode, an audiobook, and a board game. The plot is loosely based on the historical Princes in the Tower. Plot Sue and her younger brother Eddie are American tourists in London and after Eddie wants to visit Terror Tower, they join a tour of the castle. As the tour progresses, Sue notices that a man wearing black is following them as they move throughout the castle. The man in black, who also wears a cape, chases them and the children manage to escape. After going back to their hotel room, they find out that the suite is empty and that their parents are not in the hotel. They have trouble remembering their last name as well. After they leave the hotel's restaurant, the man in black blocks their path, and sends them to Medieval times with magical stones. Confused, alone and frightened, Eddie and Sue are once again stalked by the man in black and eventually find refuge in the home of a peasant woman who promises to keep them safe. However, this turns out to be a ruse, as the woman quickly betrays them and turns them over to the man in black, who is revealed to be the lord high executioner. Sue and Eddie are then taken back to Terror Tower to await execution. In the dungeon, the children meet Morgred, a sorcerer, who informs them that they are Susannah and Edward, heir to the throne and niece and nephew to the man in black. It is revealed that the man in black murdered their parents and was attempting to murder the children in order to claim the throne for himself. However, before he could succeed, Morgred sent the children into a distant future with new memories in hopes of saving them from their uncle. Fully aware of their identity, Sue and Eddie, along with Morgred, are led to their execution. After a brief standoff with the man in black, the children manage to break free and recover the magic stones allowing Morgred to, once again, send them into the future. Now in the present, they are part of the tour again. A bearded man, Morgred, joins the children and tells them to call him Mr. Morgan. Adaptations The book was adapted into a two-part episode for the television series. Jeffrey Kauffman, of DVD Talk, wrote, \\"If you're new to the Goosebumps world, this is a great place to start, with two exceptional episodes which perfectly balance thrills with an at times black humor\\". An audiobook was released by Walt Disney Records, which was nominated for an Audie Award for \\"Best Audio Children's Production\\". In a review of the audiobook, Billboard said that it is an \\"imaginative, intriguing tale of two American tourists who visit Terror Tower\\".

Affective design, along with the traditional HCI usability and accessibility, constitutes the important qualities of user experience (UX) as it contributes in the improvement of the user's personal condition in relation with the computing system.

(2000) \\"Physical, Cognitive, and Affective: A Three-Part Framework for Information Design‚Äù [online], available: https://web.archive.org/web/20061231230832/http://saulcarliner.home.att.net/id/newmodel.htm [accessed 10 January 2007] It aims to deliver artefacts capable of eliciting maximum physio-psychological pleasure consumers may obtain through all of their senses. The key challenge for affective design involves the accurate understanding of the user's affective needs and, subsequently, the design of products that would address those needs. Current research focuses on the measurement and analysis of human interactions towards affective design and the assessment of the corresponding affective design features.

It is the smallest raptor on the continent. As a small falcon, only 19 to 20 cm long, it preys on insects, small reptiles, and small mammals.  Description  African Pygmy Falcon Female at Buffalo Springs National Reserve, Kenya Adult pygmy falcons are white below and on the face, grey above, and females having a chestnut back. There are white \\"eye spots\\" on the nape. Juveniles have a brown back, duller than adult females, with a rufous wash on the breast. The flight feathers of the wings are spotted black and white (more black above, more white below); the tail is barred black and white. The flight is low and undulating. In size, pattern, and the habit of perching upright on an exposed branch or treetop, this species resembles some shrikes. The call is \\"a high-pitched kikiKIK, repeated\\" (Kenya) or \\"a 'chip-chip' and a 'kik-kik-kik-kik'\\" (southern Africa).  Range, habitat, and population  The pygmy falcon inhabits dry bush. The subspecies P. s. castanonotus occurs from South Sudan to Somalia and south to Uganda and Tanzania; P. s. semitorquatus occurs from Angola to northern South Africa. This range is estimated to have an area of 2.7 million km2, and the total population is estimated to be between 100,000 and 1 million birds.  Nesting  A pair at Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Male on left and female (brown back) on the right. In Kenya, pygmy falcons nest in white- headed buffalo weaver nests, and the ranges of the two birds coincide. In southern Africa, they are found around red-billed buffalo weaver nests but predominantly nest in the vacant rooms of sociable weaver nests, which are large and multichambered‚Äîeven if the sociable weavers still have an active colony in the nest. Despite being bird-eaters and bigger than sociable weavers, the pygmy falcons largely leave the latter alone, though they do occasionally catch and eat nestlings and even adults. Pygmy falcons provided one of the rare documented cases of intraspecific killing to acquire a new mate and territory.  Cooperative breeding  Pygmy falcon territories are occasionally inhabited by groups, where there are more than two adults living together and tending nestlings. There are four potential reasons for this behaviour: defence, co-operative polyandry, delayed dispersal of offspring and cooperation, and thermoregulation (warmth). Corroboration for the last is that in winter African pygmy falcons nest further inside the nest of sociable weavers, where there is better insulation.

The cup was donated to the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association by Mr. John Mowat of Victoria, BC, for competition in the 1927-28 hockey season. In past years, junior teams in BC played in various regional leagues, including the Kootenay International Junior Hockey League, Pacific Coast Junior Hockey League, Peace Cariboo Junior Hockey League and Rocky Mountain Junior Hockey League. Various formats for Mowat Cup competition usually saw the champions of these regional leagues compete for the Mowat Cup.

While technically starting in the village of Rethen and ending at W√ºrzburg Hauptbahnhof, it is a de facto link between Hanover and W√ºrzburg, with stops at G√∂ttingen, Kassel, and Fulda. Early construction started in 1973, the line opening fully in 1991. At in length, it is the longest newly built rail line in Germany, and its construction costs are estimated to be about DM 40 million (‚Ç¨20.45 million) per kilometre.  History  W√§lsebach Valley Bridge Bridge near Barnten The Deutsche Bundesbahn began construction of the line in 1973. Since it was designed for fast passenger trains as well as for express freight trains, its maximum incline is a mere 1.25%. Combined with the hilly terrain, this made the construction of 61 tunnels and 10 large bridges necessary. Of the 327 km of total length, 120 km are in tunnels, the two longest being the Landr√ºcken Tunnel (10,779 m) south of Fulda, the second longest being the M√ºnden Tunnel (10,525 m) south of Hann. M√ºnden. The highest bridge is the Rombach Valley Bridge near Schlitz at 95 metres. Notwithstanding 10,700 complaints and 360 lawsuits, the line was opened fully in 1991, though the W√ºrzburg‚ÄìFulda part was used by InterCity trains as early as 1988. The standard speed on the line is 250 km/h (155 mph); 280 km/h may be reached by trains running late. On 1 May 1988 the InterCityExperimental set a new land speed record for railed vehicles at 406.9 km/h (252.8 mph) between Fulda and W√ºrzburg. On 26 April 2008, trainset 11, travelling as ICE 885, collided with a flock of sheep near Fulda. Both power cars and ten of the 12 non-powered cars derailed. The train came to a stop 1300 meters into the Landr√ºcken Tunnel. 19 of the 130 passengers suffered mostly minor injuries; four of them had to be treated in hospitals.  Safety  Emergency Train in Hildesheim Deutsche Bahn AG keeps special trains for accident assistance ready, when passenger trains are on the line; from midnight to early morning these trains are out of service when the line is used for cargo transport. The trains are hauled by two specially rebuilt Class 714 locomotives and are designed to get firefighters and rescue workers to accident scenes in tunnels and on difficult-to-access sections of track. Both engines are equipped with infrared cameras and remote controls, so that the driver can steer the train into a tunnel from the first (air-tight) car of the train without endangering themselves. The trains are stationed at Hildesheim Hauptbahnhof, Kassel Hauptbahnhof, Fulda and W√ºrzburg Hauptbahnhof. They initially were painted in a bright reddish-orange livery akin to fire engines, but since the late 1990s they have been painted standard DB livery red, apparently to make them less obvious to concerned passengers.

Born in Virginia, he later moved with his family to Georgia, where he grew up. He graduated from Princeton College, \\"read the law\\", and passed the bar. Later he was elected as United States Representative, and then by the Georgia state legislature as US Senator from the state. Life and career Born in Monroe in 1799 in Halifax County, Virginia, Colquitt moved as a child with his parents to Mount Zion in Carroll County, Georgia. He attended Princeton College and studied law, gaining admission to the bar in 1820 at the age of 21. He began his law practice that year in Sparta, Georgia. Later that year, Colquitt was commissioned as a brigadier general of the state militia, also at the age of 21. Colquitt moved to the village of Cowpens in Walton County, where he practiced law. He was elected judge of the Chattahoochee circuit in 1826, and was re-elected three years later. He was licensed as a Methodist preacher in 1827, and practiced as a circuit-riding preacher. He became extremely popular in central and south Georgia, mostly for his strong support of states' rights at a time when the state tried to deal directly with the Native American tribes who occupied extensive territory there. The state was trying to force them to cede land for the benefit of white settlers, but only the federal government was authorized constitutionally to make treaties with the Native Americans and deal with them officially. Colquitt was said to be able to make a stump speech, try a court case and plead another at the bar, christen a child, preach a sermon, and marry a couple - all before dinner. He was elected as a member of the Georgia Senate in 1834 and 1837. In 1838, after Indian Removal had been underway for several years in Georgia and the Southeast by the federal government, Colquitt was elected as a Whig to the Twenty-sixth Congress, serving from March 4, 1839, to July 21, 1840, when he resigned. He changed parties, affiliating with the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Van Buren Democrat to the Twenty- seventh Congress. Newly available seats were open in the election, due to the resignations of Julius C. Alford, William Crosby Dawson, and Eugenius A. Nisbet. Marriages and family Colquitt married Nancy Holt after setting up his law practice. Their children included sons Alfred Holt Colquitt and Peyton H. Colquitt (1831-1863). Following the death of his first wife, Colquitt married widow Alphea B. (Todd) Fauntleroy in 1841. She died that year, and he married Harriet W. Ross the following year, in 1842. National office In 1842 the Georgia state legislature elected Colquitt as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate; he served from March 4, 1843, until his resignation in February 1848. While in the Twenty-ninth Congress, Colquitt was chairman of the Committee on the District of Columbia and the Committee on Patents and Patent Office. He supported the Polk administration in the controversy relative to the Oregon Territory, and was a prominent opponent of the Wilmot Proviso throughout the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Later years Colquitt retired from national politics in 1848 to resume his law practice and preaching. He was a member of the Nashville Convention in 1850, arguing for secession if slavery was restricted in any of the new territories then being added to the country. Colquitt died in 1855 during a trip from Columbus to Macon, Georgia. He was buried in Linwood Cemetery in Columbus, Georgia, where he had been residing. Legacy and honors Colquitt County, Georgia is named in memory of Walter T. Colquitt, as was the town of Colquitt, Georgia. His son, Alfred Holt Colquitt (1824-1894), son of his first wife Nancy (Holt Colquitt, also became a politician, being elected as a U.S. Representative and Senator from Georgia. He served as a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. His second son, Peyton H. Colquitt (1831-1863), also served as a Confederate officer; the colonel was mortally wounded in the Battle of Chickamauga and died two days later.

The most common use of these systems is to manipulate traffic signals in the path of an emergency vehicle, halting conflicting traffic and allowing the emergency vehicle right-of-way, to help reduce response times and enhance traffic safety. Signal preemption can also be used by light-rail and bus rapid transit systems to allow public transportation priority access through intersections, or by railroad systems at crossings to prevent collisions. Implementation Traffic preemption devices are implemented in a variety of ways. They can be installed on road vehicles, integrated with train transportation network management systems, or operated by remote control from a fixed location, such as a fire station, or by a 9-1-1 dispatcher at an emergency call center. Traffic lights must be equipped to receive an activation signal to be controlled by any system intended for use in that area. A traffic signal not equipped to receive a traffic preemption signal will not recognize an activation, and will continue to operate in its normal cycle. Vehicular devices can be switched on or off as needed, though in the case of emergency vehicles, they are frequently integrated with the vehicle's emergency warning lights. When activated, the traffic preemption device will cause properly equipped traffic lights in the path of the vehicle to cycle immediately, to grant right-of-way in the desired direction, after allowing for normal programmed time delays for signal changes and pedestrian crosswalks to clear. Traffic signal preemption systems integrated with train transportation networks typically extend their control of traffic from the typical crossarms and warning lights to one or more nearby traffic intersections, to prevent excessive road traffic from approaching the crossing, while also obtaining the right-of-way for road traffic that may be in the way to quickly clear the crossing. This also allows buses and vehicles transporting dangerous goods in the United States to proceed through the intersection without stopping at the railroad tracks. Fixed-location systems can vary widely, but a typical implementation is for a single traffic signal in front of or near a fire station to stop traffic and allow emergency vehicles to exit the station unimpeded. Alternatively, an entire corridor of traffic signals along a street may be operated from a fixed location, such as to allow fire apparatus to quickly respond through a crowded downtown area, or to allow an ambulance faster access when transporting a critical patient to a hospital in an area with dense traffic. Traffic signal preemption systems sometimes include a method for communicating to the operator of the vehicle that requested the preemption (as well as other drivers) that a traffic signal is under control of a preemption device, by means of a notifier. This device is commonly referred to in the industry as a \\"confirmation beacon\\". It is usually an additional light located near the traffic signals. It may be a single light bulb visible to all, which flashes or stays on, or there may be a light aimed towards each direction from which traffic approaches the intersection. In the case of multiple notifier lights at a controllable intersection, they will either flash or stay on depending on the local configuration, to communicate to all drivers from which direction a preempting signal is being received. This informs regular drivers which direction may need to be cleared, and informs activating vehicle drivers if they have control of the light (especially important when more than one activating vehicle approaches the same intersection). A typical installation would provide a solid notifier to indicate that an activating vehicle is approaching from behind, while a flashing notifier would indicate the emergency vehicle is approaching laterally or oncoming. There are variations of notification methods in use, which may include one or more colored lights in varying configurations. Some of the newer high tech systems have a display in the cab, which will eliminate the necessity of a confirmation beacon. This can also reduce the cost of a preemption project considerably. Events leading up to an activation and notification are not experienced by drivers on a daily basis, and driver education and awareness of these systems can play a role in how effective the systems are in speeding response times. Unusual circumstances can also occur which can confuse operators of vehicles with traffic preemption equipment who lack proper training. For example, on January 2, 2005, a fire engine successfully preempted a traffic light at an intersection which included a light rail train (LRT) crossing in Hillsboro, Oregon, yet the fire engine was hit by an LRT at the crossing. A subsequent inquiry determined that the LRT operator was at fault. The accident occurred in the middle of a network of closely spaced signalized intersections where the signs and signals granted right-of-way to the LRT simultaneously, at ALL intersections. The LRT operator was viewing right-of-way indications from downstream signals and failed to realize that preemption had occurred at the nearest intersection. The fire engine, granted the green light before it arrived at the intersection, proceeded through while the LRT operator, failing to notice the unexpected signal to stop, ran into the fire engine and destroyed it. Vehicular device types =Acoustic= Some systems use an acoustic sensor linked to the preemption system. This can be used alone or in conjunction with other systems. Systems of this type override the traffic signal when a specific pattern of tweets or wails from the siren of an emergency vehicle is detected. Advantages of a system like this are that they are fairly inexpensive to integrate into existing traffic signals and the ability to use siren equipment already installed in emergency vehicles ‚Äì thus dispensing with the need for special equipment. A major disadvantage is that sound waves can easily be reflected by buildings or other large vehicles present at or near an intersection, causing the \\"reflected\\" wave to trigger a preemption event in the wrong direction. Reflected waves can also create unnecessary collateral preemption events alongside streets near the emergency vehicle's route. Yet another disadvantage is that the acoustic sensors can sometimes be sensitive enough to activate the preemption in response to a siren from too far away, or from an unauthorized vehicle with a horn exceeding 120 dB (many truck and bus horns exceed this threshold at close range). =Line-of-sight= A vehicle that uses a line-of-sight traffic signal preemption system is equipped with an emitter which typically sends a narrowly directed signal forward, towards traffic lights in front of the vehicle, in an attempt to obtain right-of-way through a controllable intersection prior to arrival. These line-of-sight systems will generally use an invisible infrared signal, or a visible strobe light as an emitter. In the case of a strobe light, it may also serve a dual purpose as an additional warning light. To communicate to the traffic light, the emitter transmits visible flashes of light or invisible infrared pulses at a specified frequency. Traffic lights must be equipped with a compatible traffic signal preemption receiver to respond. Once the vehicle with the active emitter has passed the intersection, the receiving device no longer senses the emitter's signal, and normal operation resumes. Some systems can be implemented with varying frequencies assigned to specific types of uses, which would then allow an intersection's preemption equipment to differentiate between a fire engine and a bus sending a signal simultaneously, and then grant priority access first to the fire engine.A notifier and receiver mounted between traffic lights. Drawbacks of line-of-sight systems include obstructions, lighting and environmental conditions, and undesired activations. Obstructions may be buildings on a curving road that block visual contact with a traffic signal until very close, or perhaps a large freight truck. In the case of a police car, such a blockage would serve to prevent the traffic signal from receiving the police car's emitter signal. Modifying the position of the receiver or even locating it separate from the traffic signal equipment can sometimes correct this problem. Direct sunlight into a receiver may prevent it from detecting an emitter, and severe environmental conditions, such as heavy rain or snow, may reduce the distance at which a line-of-sight system will function. Undesired activations may occur if an emitter's signal is picked up by many traffic lights along a stretch of road, all directed to change to red in that direction, prior to the activating vehicle turning off the road, or being parked without its emitter being deactivated. Line of sight emitters can use IR diodes. They are pulsed with a low-priority signal (10 Hz) or a high-priority signal (14 Hz). =Localized radio signal= Radio-based traffic-preemption systems using a local, short-range radio signal in the 900MHz band, can usually avoid the weaknesses of line-of-sight systems (2.4 GHz and optical). A radio-based system still uses a directional signal transmitted from an emitter, but being radio-based, its signal is not blocked by visual obstructions, lighting or weather conditions. Until recently, the major drawback of radio-based traffic signal preemption systems was the possibility of interference from other devices that may be using the same frequency at a given time and location. The advent of FHSS (Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum) broadcasting has allowed radio-based systems to not only overcome this limitation, but also the aforementioned limitations associated with acoustic and line of sight (optical) systems. It was not until recently that cost effective GPS preemption systems were introduced, supplanting FHSS radio-based preemption as the preemption method of choice, particularly for cities that had experienced the myriad of issues associated with other (acoustic and optical) preemption systems. Radio-based systems also began to offer some additional benefits ‚Äî adjustable range and collision avoidance. The operating range was adjusted by varying the radio signal strength so that traffic lights could be activated only nearby (if desired), or at greater distances. The downside to these preemption systems (which also performed collision avoidance) was that they would display the direction of impending collisions, but not be able to effectively (or accurately) calculate the distance to collision by any method other than RF signal strength, which was only a rough estimate at best. =Global Positioning System= With the advent of widespread Global Positioning System (GPS) applications came the introduction of a GPS-based traffic preemption system, that could also do collision avoidance. Recently some GPS preemption systems have found a way to overcome the nagging problem that \\"blinds\\" many GPS systems: how to prevent the system from being \\"blinded\\" by the loss of a GPS signal. In dense cities with tall buildings, GPS receivers may have difficulty obtaining the four required GPS satellite signals, required for trilateration to determine location. If the vehicle systems are not designed with a backup \\"IMU\\" (Inertial Measurement Unit), lack of GPS availability may adversely affect the system's performance. Extremely heavy cloud cover or severe weather can also adversely impact the ability of the GPS receiver from obtaining the four required satellites. Some systems offer an Optical Compatible GPS system with features that also include an Inertial measurement unit (IMU). The price point of some compare to Optical Systems. Therefore, cities that do not have preemption can get a GPS based system for the price of Optical Systems (typically 1/3 the price of many GPS systems). Additionally, cities that have existing optical systems can start upgrading to a GPS-based system while maintaining compatibility with their existing Optical vehicle emitters. These systems also come with Collision Avoidance. GPS systems typically convey their information in one of three ways - via 900 MHz FHSS, via 2.4 GHz FHSS, or by way of cellular modem. Each of these methodologies has a different set of advantages/disadvantages. 900 MHz FHSS appears to be the best option, because it is capable of the greatest range (often over 3 miles for a 1 watt transceiver). 2.4 GHz is able to communicate more data, but is typically considered more \\"directional\\" or \\"line-of-sight\\". It only has a maximum range of about 3/4 mile. This can often preclude the system from preempting soon enough to ensure a clear intersection upon arrival. Cellular overcomes the \\"distance\\" issue, but can be quite costly when cellular fees are taken into consideration. During an area-wide emergency, it is also well known to those in the industry that the cellular network often will go down. This can make preemption difficult (unless there are other backup systems in place) during a time (of crisis) when preemption may be needed most. Cellular also brings with it a certain amount of \\"latency\\". It has been documented that it can sometimes take cellular based preemption systems 10 seconds or more to release the preemption of a traffic signal, even though the emergency vehicle has already cleared the intersection.

Names  The word cheongju () consists of two characters: cheong () meaning \\"clear\\" and ju () meaning \\"alcoholic drink\\". It contrasts with takju (), as \\"tak\\" () means \\"turbid\\". The word takju usually refers to makgeolli (milky, unrefined rice wine). The hanja characters Ê∑∏ÈÖí are the same as the kanji pronounced seishu used on the labels of sake. The native Korean word for \\"clear wine\\", malgeun-sul (), is also used to refer to cheongju. Another name for cheongju is yakju (), which literally translates into \\"medicinal wine\\".  History  According to Things on Korea‚Äîa 12th-century book on Korea written by Song Chinese scholar Sun Mu (Â≠´Á©Ü)‚Äîthe Goryeo people used non-glutinous rice to brew rice wine. Another 12th-century Chinese book, Illustrated Account of Goryeo, reports that Korean rice wine that is made with nuruk is deeper in color and has a higher alcohol content; it says that when drinking this wine one gets drunk quickly and sobers up quickly. This book says that clear, refined rice wine was made in the royal court, while milky, unrefined rice wine was more popular among commoners.  Preparation  Cheongju is usually brewed in winter, between the months of November and March. Steamed rice mixed with nuruk (fermentation starter) and water is left to ferment for 16 to 25 days, at a temperature not higher than . During the fermentation process, the rice starch becomes saccharified; the yeast fungi feed on the sugars created by saccharification and produce alcohol. The fermented wine is then filtered with yongsu (a wine strainer), which is dipped into the liquid. The clear wine inside the yongsu is ladled out to make cheongju.  Consumption  Cheongju has been widely used in a variety of traditional rituals and rites, as it is regarded as a well-prepared alcohol.  Varieties  Southern cities in South Korea such as Masan, Gunsan, and Nonsan are famous for producing good cheongju. Beopju brewed in Gyeongju and sogok-ju brewed in Hansan are well- known varieties of cheongju. There also are cheongju varieties made with glutinous rice or black rice. Flavoured cheongju varieties include gukhwa-ju made with chrysanthemum, dugyeon-ju made with rhododendron, songsun-ju made with pine sprouts, yeonyeop-ju made with lotus leaves, and insam-ju made with ginseng.  Similar beverages  Cheongju is similar to other East Asian rice wine counterparts such as the Chinese mijiu and Japanese sake. A dry white vermouth can also serve as a substitute for cheongju in cooking.

The station was terminus of the Belgrano Sur line that runs trains along Greater Buenos Aires region. The station is located a short distance north of the Riachuelo River, on the boundaries between the barrios of Parque Patricios and Barracas, two outlying neighbourhoods in the southern part of the city. Overview Despite its name, Buenos Aires was not the principal railway station of the city but only a secondary commuter rail station. The local transport company Argentren operates various daily diesel trains to and from the Buenos Aires suburbs along two branches of the Belgrano Sur line. Destinations include several stations in La Matanza, Merlo and Mor√≥n partidos. The station was accessible by some city bus services but it is the only railway station in Buenos Aires that has no access to the Subte of Buenos Aires. History The station soon after being opened, c. 1911 Platforms viewed from the east, 2015 Buenos Aires was opened in 1911 as part of the French-owned company Compa√±√≠a Gral. de Buenos Aires railway network, that reached several cities in the Buenos Aires Province such as Patricios in 9 de Julio Partido, General Villegas, Victorino de la Plaza (Guamin√≠ Partido), La Plata and Vedia among other destinations. When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised in 1948, state-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos took over the services of the line. In August 1977, National decree 2294 stated the closure of 225-km. of the line and all rail tracks were also removed. Due to increasing population in the region, the \\"Marinos del Crucero Gral. Belgrano\\" was built for passenger services. With the railway privatisation carried out by Carlos Menem's presidency, concession was granted to Metropolitano although the concession would be revoked in 2007 because of the poor service conditions, being consortium UGOFE the operator of the line until 2013. When UGOFE was dissolved, private company Argentren took over the Belgrano Sur line.\\"Roggio y EMEPA se repartir√°n el manejo de cuatro ferrocarriles\\", Clar√≠n, 13 Nov 2013\\"Trenes cero kil√≥metro despu√©s de cincuenta a√±os\\", P√°gina/12, 26 Nov 2014\\"Trenes: le dan a Roggio el Mitre y el San Mart√≠n y a Emepa, el Roca y el Belgrano Sur\\", La Naci√≥n, 12 Feb 2014\\"Las privadas volver√°n a operar la mayor√≠a de las l√≠neas ferroviarias\\", Clar√≠n, 12 Feb 2014\\"El Gobierno estableci√≥ un nuevo r√©gimen de operaciones de las l√≠neas ferroviaria, Telam, 12 Feb 2014\\"De a uno por l√≠nea, para mejor control\\", P√°gina 12, 12 Feb 2014\\"Metrov√≠as operar√° las l√≠neas Mitre y San Mart√≠n\\", En el Subte, 12 Feb 2014 In May 2018, Buenos Aires and S√°enz stations were closed as part of a project that includes the construction of a viaduct where Belgrano Sur trains will run, which will allow to eliminate several level crossings in the city.

This is the first piano concerto of Mozart's to include clarinets in its scoring, and is scored for solo piano, flute, two clarinets (in B), two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani (in E and B), and strings. Structure and analysis The concerto is in the following three movements: At about 35 minutes, it is one of Mozart's longest concertos. =Allegro= forte section is played tutti; the piano section is played the first time by the bassoons, and upon repeat by the violins. At no point in the movement does the soloist carry any part of the principal theme. In his book on the piano concertos, Cuthbert Girdlestone pointed out the similarity between the opening of this movement and that of Mozart's Symphony No. 1, K. 16, written when he was eight years old. This juvenile work was composed for an orchestra of oboes, horns and strings. A comparison illustrates how far Mozart had developed in the intervening 20 years: Both works start with \\"a vigorous and rhythmical attack and a light answer, quiet and tuneful\\".Girdlestone, C. M. (1948, p. 346) Mozart's Piano Concertos. London, Cassell. In the earlier work, the whole ensemble plays question and answer phrases and repeats them in their entirety:Symphony No. 1 opening bars Symphony No. 1 opening bars The orchestration of the piano concerto is subtler and more differentiated. In the early symphony, the answering phrase consisted of block harmonies, but in the concerto it opens out into flowing lines of counterpoint, initially featuring just two horns and a bassoon: Piano Concerto K. 482 opening Piano Concerto K. 482, first movement bars 1‚Äì6 On repeating this, a different group of instruments plays the answering phrase, with \\"the unusual sound of the violins providing the bass for the solo clarinets\\":Rosen, C. (1971, p. 240) The Classical Style. London, Faber. Piano Concerto K. 482, first movement bars 7‚Äì12 Roger Kamien and Naphtali Wagner have analysed in detail Mozart's use of bridge themes in the exposition of the concerto's first movement. Simon Keefe has analysed the character of the dialogue between the soloist and the orchestra in the concerto's first movement. = Andante (Variations) = The slow second movement is a theme and variations in C minor that recalls similar slow C minor movements in other Mozart E major concertos such as K. 271 and K. 364. Mozart's father, in a famous letter to Maria (\\"Nannerl\\"), expressed surprise that a call was made for the slow movement (\\"a rather unusual occurrence!\\") to be repeated. = Allegro = In the rondo finale, the main theme resembles that of Mozart's third horn concerto (K. 447). Adena Portowitz has noted similar features between the finale of the K. 271 and K. 482 concerti. In another similarity to K. 271, the finale is interrupted by a lengthy and slow minuet episode before returning to the main theme for a lively finish (also recalling Count Almaviva's adagio pleadings for forgiveness leading to a buffa conclusion in Le Nozze di Figaro, a work that Mozart was working on at this time). The Andantino episode of K. 482 is melodically simpler than the parallel episode in K. 271, at least on paper, and less complex in form as well, consisting of two eight-bar phrases played by the orchestra and repeated with the solo, followed by a transition back to the rondo theme. (The Menuetto episode of K. 271, while often described as a set of variations, is actually in a more elaborate rounded binary form with both parts repeated, again followed by a transition back to the main rondo theme.) M.S. Cole has noted that the K. 482's finale marks Mozart's last use of potpourri in his compositions.

She is best known for her \\"Fairyland Lustre\\" series. Makeig- Jones was born in Wath-upon-Dearne near Rotherham, Yorkshire, the eldest of seven children. Her father, K. Geoffrey Makeig-Jones, was of Welsh descent and was a medical doctor, and her mother was the daughter of Thomas Reeder, a solicitor. Makeig-Jones was taught by a governess at home, then attended a boarding school near Rugby. After her family moved to Torquay, she entered the Torquay School of Art. After an introduction from a relative to the managing director of Cecil Wedgwood, Makeig-Jones joined the firm as an apprentice painter in 1909. After two years at Wedgwood, Makeig-Jones, clearly talented, started to design tableware in 1911. Attracted to the fanciful, she began to design Oriental dragon patterns in 1913. She moved on to her signature Fairyland Lustre design in 1915, a year after the war in Europe started. These lines were just what were needed at Wedgwood, which was in a slack period when the Fairyland Lustre series was released, according to Nicholas Dawes, an independent New York antiques dealer. \\"Many Europeans were looking for something to escape from the horrors of war,\\" continues Dawes, who describes the goblins and floating fairies in the pottery's neon landscapes as \\"escapist stuff, real fantastical.\\" Wedgwood Fairyland Lustre Ghostly Wood Covered Malfrey Pot. Circa 1920 Dawes notes that the rise of Makeig-Jones within Wedgwood was unusual not only because she was a woman, but also because she rose from within the company's ranks, an exception to the well-known designers that Wedgwood normally brought in from outside. The Fairyland Lustre line proved immensely popular across the Atlantic during the Roaring 20s, providing Wedgwood a popular and pricey product with which to penetrate the lucrative American market. But soon Makeig-Jones' Art Nouveau fairies faded from fashion. Dawes says it was no surprise that the line was discontinued in 1929. \\"It had been around long enough that people were getting tired of it,\\" Dawes continues, \\"and with the Depression, the American market just dried up.\\" Wedgwood hired a new art director and moved on to a more austere modern style, abandoning the multi-colored lustrous glazes, which were expensive to produce, a luxury that couldn't be afforded during the economic downturn of the 1930s. Besides, by all contemporary accounts, Makeig-Jones had grown \\"too big for her station,\\" Dawes says. \\"She acted as if she was the president of the company and would march around telling people what to do. Eccentric can be good in a designer, but she quickly became a difficult employee. She seemed more interested in fairies and elves and the mythical world than the real one. She was not willing or able to do anything different. What she was doing became pass√©, so her number was up.\\" In April 1931, she was asked to retire, left in a fury, and her designing days were over. One of Cecil Wedgwood's daughters, Doris Audrey Wedgwood, married her brother Thomas Geoffrey Rowland Makeig- Jones in 1928. She died in 1945.

An urchin barren is an area of the shallow part of the ocean where the population growth of sea urchins has gone unchecked, causing destructive grazing of kelp forests. Process Sea urchins eat kelp holdfasts. This can be caused by a lack of sea otters or other predators in the area, which makes it extremely important to protect the ecological balance in a kelp forest. Keystone species such as the sea otter help maintain healthy kelp communities; however, because of overfishing and increased killer whale predation, their numbers are in decline. Off the California coast, storm runoff, erosion and polluted water allow less light to penetrate, weakening the kelp. Sea urchins then can move in and settle. Despite their name, urchin barrens are usually abundant with marine invertebrate life, echinoderms in particular.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3W4OCnHyCs Species such as the sunflower starfishes, brittle stars, and the purple sea urchin are common. Although macrofauna such as these are aplenty, there is little primary productivity among microorganisms. This makes it difficult for newly settled sea urchins (juveniles) to survive, making barrens more dangerous for juveniles than for adults. Once having wiped out a kelp forest, the environment becomes unsupportive of new sea urchin settlement and adults are forced to find a new resource. Shift theories An area of the subtidal where the population growth of sea urchins has gone unchecked causes destructive grazing of kelp beds or kelp forests (specifically the giant brown bladder kelp, Macrocystis). The transition from kelp forest to barren is defined by phase shifts in which one stable community state is shifted to another. The continuous phase shift is widely accepted. This describes a transition from one ecosystem state to another where the threshold for the forward shift is at the same level as the threshold for the reverse shift back to the previous state. In other words, a kelp bed can re-establish itself when urchin grazing intensity decreases to the threshold density triggering the initial shift. Alternatively, another theory posits that both sea urchin barrens and kelp-beds represent alternative stable states, meaning that an ecosystem can exist under multiple states, each with a set of unique biotic and abiotic conditions (i.e. barren except for urchins or flourishing with kelp). Those who argue for this theory propose several criteria: that different self-replacing communities dominate the site; each state exists longer than one complete turnover of the dominant community or species; and that following a disturbance (e.g. a storm), the system returns to the previous state. Impacted areas Over the past four decades, barrens have been reported along coastlines around the world, everywhere from Nova Scotia to Chile. They can either span over a thousand kilometers of coastline or occur in small patches.

The route primarily runs through Evansville, Indiana, reaching from Interstate 69 on the east side of the city to the Posey County line west of the city limits. West of US 41, the expressway is signed as Indiana State Road 62 (SR 62). East of US 41, it is signed as Indiana State Road 66 (SR 66).  History  Before the expressway was built, east-west traffic across Evansville was handled by a pair of streets: Division Street to the east of Main Street, and Pennsylvania Avenue to the west. These roads were congested and dangerous. For a short stretch, Division Street ran in tandem with a busy railroad track. The unacceptable condition of this route necessitated an expressway. The road was built in stages. The west section of the expressway was completed in the 1950s, ending at Fulton Avenue with plans to continue it further east at a later date. It wasn't until the 1970s and 80s that local officials succeeded in securing federal funding to finish construction. Key to this effort was popular Evansville mayor Russell G. Lloyd, Sr., who was assassinated in 1980 after he had left office. The expressway is named in his honor. In the spring of 1983, buildings in the expressway's path were demolished, and construction began on July 29, 1983. Five years later, the road finally opened on July 19, 1988. Construction on the eastern phase cost $160 million. Since opening, the state has made gradual improvements to the road. In 2008, construction began on a $32 million diamond interchange at Fulton Avenue near downtown. This replaced the at-grade signaled intersection that was there previously. In 2014, a $19 million project was started to reconfigure the interchange with US 41 from a partial cloverleaf, with traffic lights on the Lloyd Expressway, into a full cloverleaf with no signals. There have been proposals for similar projects on other high-traffic intersections, such as Burkhardt Road.  Route description  As one travels along the expressway, upon reaching US 41, one state highway ‚Äî SR 62 if traveling east or SR 66 if traveling west ‚Äî leaves the expressway while the other joins the expressway. (To the north, SR 62 and SR 66 both run concurrently with US 41 and eventually turn off in opposite directions). The expressway contains a mix of intersections and interchanges. Because the route includes several at-grade intersections with stoplights, Evansville residents sometimes use the term \\"expressway\\" derisively, or drop it altogether and call it \\"the Lloyd\\" instead. Nevertheless, the road actually has many characteristics that fit the standard definition of \\"expressway.\\" Opposing traffic is separated between intersections and interchanges, largely by medians. There are few driveways along the route, with most access made via side roads. Most driveways that do exist are restricted to right-in/right-out access only. Along much of its route, especially near the downtown area, the expressway is bordered by Division Street along the north side of the road and John Street along the south side of the road. These two streets act as frontage roads for the expressway; many of the on-ramps and off-ramps from the highway connect with Division Street or John Street instead of the road actually labeled on the exit sign. This allows drivers to continue on to other streets that do not have their own exits.

The village is northwest of Sittingbourne on the banks of the Medway Estuary. It lies north of Newington on the A2 Roman road. The 2011 census recorded the parish's population as 1,180. The village has a long history, with evidence of constant occupation since the Iron Age. Being so close to the water, Lower Halstow has (until recently) been a village that has made its living from the water. Whether it be ancient pottery making, ancient fishing, barge building, or in the 19th- and 20th-century brick-making (Eastwoods Brickworks), the water has been the lifeblood of the village. According to Edward Hasted in 1798, two large hospital ships, commonly called lazarettos, (which were the surviving hulks of 44-gun ships) were moored in Halstow Creek. The lazarettos monitored ships coming to England which were forced to stay in the creek under quarantine, to protect the country from infectious diseases. In 1563 Queen Elizabeth ordered a survey, and Halstow Key (a wharf on the creek), was made up of 24 people in houses and 14 living on boats. There were two hamlets, one beside the wharf and the other around Halstow Green on Lower Street. The rest of the northern lands were salt marsh. Lands heading southwards (measuring 1200 acres) were heavy clay. All the lands were under the control of the manor of Milton Regis. The creek and some of the village is featured in the 2017 film Wonder Woman.

It is caused by Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV-1). Aujeszky's disease is considered to be the most economically important viral disease of swine in areas where classical swine fever (hog cholera) has been eradicated. Other mammals, such as cattle, sheep, goats, cats, dogs, and raccoons, are also susceptible. The disease is usually fatal in these animal species. Research on SuHV-1 in pigs has pioneered animal disease control with genetically modified vaccines. SuHV-1 is now used in model studies of basic processes during lytic herpesvirus infection, and for unravelling molecular mechanisms of herpesvirus neurotropism.  History  In 1902, a Hungarian veterinarian, Alad√°r Aujeszky, demonstrated a new infectious agent in a dog, ox, and cat, and showed it caused the same disease in swine and rabbits. In the following decades the infection was found in several European countries, especially in cattle, where local intense pruritus (itching) is a characteristic symptom. And in the United States a well known disease in cattle called \\"mad itch\\" was concluded to be in fact Aujeszky's disease.  Disease overview  seropositive for pseudorabies in the United States Present, Absent The virus is shed in the saliva and nasal secretions of swine infected by the respiratory route. Aerosolization of the virus and transmission by fomites also may occur. The virus may potentially survive for seven hours in humid air, and it may survive on well water for up to seven hours, in green grass, soil, and feces for up to two days, in contaminated feed for up to three days, and in straw bedding for up to four days. Diagnosis is made mainly by virus isolation in tissue cultures, or through ELISA or PCR tests. Vaccines are available for swine (ATCvet codes: inactivated, live, plus various combinations). The infection has been eradicated in a number of European countries. In the United States, the domestic swine population in 2004 was declared free of Aujeszky's disease, though the infection still remains in feral pig populations.  Clinical signs  Respiratory infection is usually asymptomatic in pigs more than 2 months old, but it can cause abortion, high mortality in piglets, and coughing, sneezing, fever, constipation, depression, seizures, ataxia, circling, and excess salivation in piglets and mature pigs. Mortality in piglets less than one month of age is close to 100%, but it is less than 10% in pigs between one and six months of age. Pregnant swine can reabsorb their litters or deliver mummified, stillborn, or weakened piglets. In cattle (see next section), symptoms include intense itching followed by neurological signs and death. In dogs, symptoms include intense itching, jaw and pharyngeal paralysis, howling, and death Any infected secondary host generally only lives two to three days. Genital infection appears to have been common in a great part of the 20th century in many European countries in swine herds, where boars from boar centres were used for natural service of sows or gilts. This disease manifestation has always been asymptomatic in affected pigs, and presence of the infection on a farm was detected only because of cases in cattle showing pruritus on the hindquarters (vaginal infection, see below).Bitsch, Viggo (2015). Principal epidemiological features of Aujeszky's disease in swine and cattle. . http://SuHV-1epidemiology.blogspot.com/ In susceptible animals other than swine, infection is usually fatal, and the affected animals most often show intense pruritus in a skin area. Pruritus in Aujeszky's disease is considered a phantom sensation as virus has never been found at the site of pruritus.Bitsch, Viggo (2015)  Pathogenicity and virulence of SuHV-1  The epidemiology of Aujeszky's disease varies with the pathogenicity or virulence of the virus strain involved. This is best illustrated by the development of the severity of the disease in Denmark, where import of swine had been forbidden for decades up to 1972. Before 1964 only genital strains were spread, but then respiratory strains appeared, which subsequently were spread rapidly over the country, mainly by the trade of animals. In the late 1970s more virulent strains developed. The disease in swine became much more severe, outbreaks of respiratory disease in cattle rose dramatically, and the infection was spread airborne to other swine herds. The higher virulence of these virus strains was associated with a certain ability to create syncytia (cell fusion) in tissue cultures (syncytial virus strains). Comprehensive restriction fragment pattern analyses of virus DNA have documented that the more virulent strains had not been introduced from abroad but had developed in two steps from the original Danish strains. The correlation between high virulence of virus strains and syncytium formation in tissue cultures was confirmed by examinations of isolates from other countries. This second step in the severity development of the disease in Denmark caused the decision to eradicate. New outbreaks after the eradication of the indigenous infection by the end of 1985 were all caused by foreign highly virulent, syncytial strains introduced by airborne transmission from Germany. Briefly, SuHV-1 is spread either genitally or respiratorily. Genital strains have been found to be non-syncytial. Respiratory strains may be of relatively low or of high virulence. In Europe, syncytial strains have been found to be highly virulent.  Epidemiology  Populations of wild boar, or feral hogs (Sus scrofa), in the US commonly contract and spread the virus throughout their range. Mortality is highest in young piglets. Pregnant sows often abort when infected. Otherwise healthy male adults (boars) are typically latent carriers, that is, they harbor and transmit the virus without displaying signs or suffering disability.Berryman Institute: Managing Wild Pigs Swine (both domestic and feral) are usual reservoirs for this virus, though it does affect other species. Aujeszky's disease has been reported in other mammals, including brown bears, and black bears, Florida panthers, raccoons, coyotes, and whitetail deer. In most cases, contact with pigs or pig products was either known or suspected. Outbreaks in farm fur species in Europe (mink and foxes) have been associated with feeding contaminated pig products. Many other species can be experimentally infected. Humans are not potential hosts.Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira: Aujeszkyn tauti (AD, pseudorabies) Cattle have been found to be infected either by the respiratory or the vaginal route (iatrogenic cases disregarded). Primary infection of mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract is associated with head pruritus, while lung infection results in chest pruritus. Vaginal infection of bovines, which regularly show pruritus of the hindquarters, has been found to be associated with a concurrent genital infection in swine on the same premises, and investigations have evidenced that the vaginal infection of cattle had been sexually transmitted by man from infected sows. Genital infection in swine herds has been closely correlated with the use of boars from boar centres for natural service of sows.  Transmission  Aujeszky's disease is highly contagious. The infection is commonly considered to be transmitted among swine through nose-to-nose contact, because the virus is mostly present in nasal and oral areas. This notion, however, is contradicted by results from epidemiological studies, according to which the decisive spread within herds occurs by air currents over many meters. Correspondingly, the risk of airborne transmission of highly virulent virus strains from acutely infected herds to other swine herds has been found to be very high. The infection has been found transmitted over distances of many kilometers. Otherwise, the infection is most often transmitted into herds by introduction of acutely or latently infected pigs. Concerning transmission to cattle, see section above.  Prevention  Although no specific treatment for acute infection with SuHV-1 is available, vaccination can alleviate clinical signs in pigs of certain ages. Typically, mass vaccination of all pigs on the farm with a modified live virus vaccine is recommended. Intranasal vaccination of sows and neonatal piglets one to seven days old, followed by intramuscular (IM) vaccination of all other swine on the premises, helps reduce viral shedding and improve survival. The modified live virus replicates at the site of injection and in regional lymph nodes. Vaccine virus is shed in such low levels, mucous transmission to other animals is minimal. In gene-deleted vaccines, the thymidine kinase gene has also been deleted; thus, the virus cannot infect and replicate in neurons. Breeding herds are recommended to be vaccinated quarterly, and finisher pigs should be vaccinated after levels of maternal antibody decrease. Regular vaccination results in excellent control of the disease. Concurrent antibiotic therapy via feed and IM injection is recommended for controlling secondary bacterial pathogens.  Applications in neuroscience  SuHV-1 can be used to analyze neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS). For this purpose the attenuated (less virulent) Bartha SuHV-1 strain is commonly used and is employed as a retrograde and anterograde transneuronal tracer. In the retrograde direction, SuHV-1-Bartha is transported to a neuronal cell body via its axon, where it is replicated and dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and the dendritic tree. SuHV-1-Bartha released at the synapse is able to cross the synapse to infect the axon terminals of synaptically connected neurons, thereby propagating the virus; however, the extent to which non-synaptic transneuronal transport may also occur is uncertain. Using temporal studies and/or genetically engineered strains of SuHV-1-Bartha, second, third, and higher order neurons may be identified in the neural network of interest.

It is about across, a little longer N-S than E-W. Its floor is about below the surrounding ground level and has a rim that rises above, the highest point on the east side. The crater formed during the late Pleistocene, between 13,500 and 18,000 years ago, at which time the Fort Rock Basin was a lake and the location was near the shore. Basaltic magma intruding near the surface flashed ground water to steam, which blew out overlying rock and soil, along with some juvenile material. As material slid into the hole formed, it closed the vent and the process repeated, eventually forming the huge hole. Blocks as large as in size were flung as far as from the crater. To the west of Hole-in-the-Ground is an even bigger maar, , but older and more eroded, called Big Hole.

Playing career  Before Zagar went professional he played at the local amateur level with East York Soccer Club. He received a scholarship with the University of Toronto and played with the Toronto Varsity Blues, with whom he recorded the most shutouts in a season in 1997, received first-team honours, and was the OUA MVP, as well as the CIAU MVP. In 1997, he played with Scarborough Azzurri/Blues of the Ontario Soccer League, where he won two Ontario Cups. In 1998, he was drafted by the Toronto Lynx of the USL A-League, and offered a professional contract. During his first season he primarily served as backup for Jim Larkin, and Hubert Busby, Jr.. In 2000, after the departure of Larkin he was made the first choice goalkeeper for the club. Zagar helped his club reached the postseason, and was awarded the club's MVP as well as making the A-League Second All-Star Team. At the conclusion of the season he signed with the Toronto ThunderHawks of the National Professional Soccer League for the indoor winter season. After the departure of Marco Reda he was named the new team captain. At the conclusion of the season he was named the club's MVP for the second time in his career. The following season he made a team record by receiving the team's MVP award for the third time in his career. On January 8, 2004, Zagar was transferred to division rivals the Rochester Raging Rhinos and signed to a two-year contract. During his tenure with Rochester he helped the team finish second in their division, which secured a postseason berth for the club. In 2005, former teammate Hubert Busby Jr, was appointed the new head coach for the Toronto Lynx organization and brought back Zagar to the fold. In 2006, under new head coach Duncan Wilde, he was appointed to a player- assistant coach role, along with team captain Joe Mattacchione. During the season he helped the Lynx to a team-record 10 game undefeated streak at home,and as well helped the Lynx reach the Open Canada Cup final, which they lost 2-0 against Ottawa St. Anthony Italia. Consequently, the Lynx organization self-relegated itself to the Premier Development League which resulted in the release of all of their players. Zagar retired from professional soccer after Toronto's relegation and left holding every Lynx goalkeeping record, with the most wins (64), most shutouts (44.5), most saves (665), and most games played (174). After his retirement, he became the U-11 Development Director and Goalkeeper Director for the Oakville Soccer Club in 2007 and briefly served as a commentator for Rogers Television's coverage of the Canadian Soccer League. He currently serves as the Club Technical and Development Director and Head Goalkeeping coach for his old youth club, East York Soccer Club, which his father Dragan Zagar is the long-time president and Tournament Chair for the East York Soccer League.

It was incorporated in 1897 and was formerly one of the principal cities of the Boundary Country smelting and mining district. It was incorporated as a city originally and has retained that title despite the population decline following the closure of the area's industries. The town is served by Greenwood Elementary School which covers grades from 4-7. Students attend Midway Elementary School for grades from K-3. Following grade 7 local students attend Boundary Central Secondary School in nearby Midway. In 1942, 1,200 Japanese Canadians were sent to Greenwood as part of the Japanese Canadian internment. Among those interned at Greenwood were Isamu and Fumiko Kariya and their son Yasi, the grandparents and uncle of NHL star and Hockey Hall of Fame member Paul Kariya; his father Tetsuhiko (T.K.) was born in internment. History and Demographics In 1886 several mining claims had been staked in a narrow gulch ten miles north of the mouth of Boundary Creek. The ore was high in copper. Ten years later more claims had been staked in the area. These claims gave rise to the city of Greenwood. In 1895 a merchant named Robert Wood erected a log store and named the region Greenwood. By 1896 there were three hotels, a general store, a livery stable, two assay offices, a mining broker, an opera house, and a dozen other establishments. Greenwood became an incorporated city in 1897. The population climbed to 3,000 by 1899 and a railway called the Columbia and Western Railway reached Greenwood from the east. In 1899 a fire struck Greenwood which gutted several businesses. The BC Copper Company smelter began operation in 1901, servicing ore from the Mother Lode Mine and other mines in the area. Greenwood was the supply center for surrounding camps such as Providence, Copper, Deadwood, Wellington, Central, Skylark and others. The city became the seat of government for the Boundary with one hundred firms in the business district. Greenwood had a newspaper called the \\"Times\\" by 1906 another paper called the \\"Greenwood Ledge\\". By 1910 the boom had passed and Greenwood's population was 1,500. At the end of World War I, the demand for copper dropped, and by 1918 the copper market was dead, and the smelter in Greenwood lay idle. The following year it closed down permanently. The collapse of the smelters led to close of mines around the vicinity of Greenwood. Greenwood was on the decline after this period. Television and media Greenwood was featured on the historical television series Gold Trails and Ghost Towns, Season 2, Episode 1. Greenwood was one of the filming locations for the theatrical film Snow Falling on Cedars. Lost mines Close to Greenwood is the location of Jolly Jack's Lost Mine. Local historian Bill Barlee wrote about Jolly Jack's lost mine. The location of the mine was never found. The Greenwood local museum has written records of Jolly Jack. Henry Morgan's lost mine is located somewhere around Greenwood. The mine is thought to have been at the headwaters of Boundary Creek, although it has never been found. Local historian Garnet Basque has written about Morgan's lost mine.

The Cholas of the Vijayalaya Dynasty, who ruled parts of South India and Lanka between the tenth and thirteenth centuries CE, were dependent on their army and navy to expand and maintain order in their vast empire. Chola was the head of this army and navy.  Origins  Chola inscriptions mention numerous regiments by specific names. Rajaraja Chola I created a powerful standing army and a considerable navy, which achieved even greater success under his son Rajendra Chola I. The army consisted of the Infantry, Cavalry and Elephant corps. There is no evidence of traditional Chariot corps found in ancient Hindu literature; rather, there were other specialists, like bowmen (villaligal). At its peak, the Cholan army is said to have had two million soldiers simultaneously fighting for their kingdom. Chinese geographer Chau Ju-kua, writing in around 1225, gave the following account of the Chola Army: > This [Chola] country is at war with the kingdom of the [west] of India. The > government owns sixty thousand war elephants, every one seven or eight feet > high. When fighting these elephants carry on their backs houses, and these > houses are full of soldiers who shoot arrows at long range, and fight with > spears at close quarters.The kings themselves used to fight in battlefields > riding on such war elephants. There are a few occasions of the king dying in > the battlefield on these elephants. Parantaka I's son Rajaditya died at > Sripurambayam. The Chola king Rajadhiraja Chola I died on an elephant > fighting the Chalukya army at Thakolam The epithet Yanai-mel-thunjiya (who > died on an elephant) is attached to these kings in their inscriptions > indicating their valour.  Organisation and administration  The Army of the Cholas followed the ancient Indian tradition of Chaturangabala for organization and Sadangabala for administration, the fourfold force and sixfold control. In its shortened form, it is called RathaGajaTuraPadai, where Ratha is the chariot, Gaja the elephant, Tura the horses, and Padai the infantry. It was said that an army with proportional growth of the said forces was a balanced and well-composed one. In addition to the divisions, there were the Nadapu ‚Äì the commissariat and Payanam ‚Äì the admiralty and logistics. The addition to these, bureaucratic reforms revolutionized the Chola Army, resulting in victories on a massive scale.The Encyclopedia of Military History from 3500 B.C. to the Present, Page 1458‚Äì59 by Richard Ernest Dupuy, Trevor Nevitt Dupuy -1986, The regiments of the Chola Army had a degree of autonomy and were free to endow benefactions and build temples in their own names. Some regiments were entrusted with the management of minor temple shrines and were expected to provide for them. Others took money from the temple on interest, which they agreed to pay in cash. It is not known for what purposes they used this money, although the transactions serve to reveal the army's interest and involvement in the temples. = Senai = Commanding Officer's Rank: Senathipathi (Lord of the Army) Modern equivalent: Marshal of the Army The standing army was organized into multiple Senais. The composition of each depended on its deployment or stationed location and role. Normally, a Chola Senai was the largest organizational unit. At various times in its existence, the army had between one and three Senais.Historical Military Heritage of the Tamils By Ca. Vƒì. Cuppirama·πáiyanÃ≤, Ka.Ta. TirunƒÅvukkaracu, International Institute of Tamil Studies, Pages 152-156 = Thalam = Commanding Officer's Rank: Thalapathi ‚Äì equivalent to the naval rank of Kalapathi. Modern equivalent: General The Senai is divided into various Thalams. A Thalam is a self-sustaining army formation with its own material resources and inventory. A Thalam usually contains: * 3 Yanaipadai ‚Äì elephant corps, each with 300‚Äì500 elephants. * 3 Kudhiraipadai ‚Äì cavalry corps, each with 500‚Äì1000 horses. * 6 Kaalaatpadai ‚Äì infantry corps, each with 2000‚Äì3000 men. * 2 Thalpadai ‚Äì auxiliaries, a mix of infantry & cavalry, each with 1000‚Äì2000 Men and 500‚Äì1000 Horses. They could be used as rear-guard units as well as a guerilla force in times of withdrawal. * 2 Marathuvarani ‚Äì medical corps of about 200‚Äì300 doctors with horse-drawn carriages and medical provisions. * 1 or 2 Oosipadai ‚Äì strike corps = Ani = Commanding Officer's Rank': Anipathi (Lord of Group) Modern equivalent: Colonel A Thalam is subdivided into various Anis, which is one-third of a Thalam, with * 1 Yanaipadai * 1 Kudhiraipadai * 2 Kaalatpadai * 2 Thalpadai  Regiments  The prominence given to the army from the conquest of the Pandyas down to the last year of the king‚Äôs reign is significant and shows the spirit with which the king treated his soldiers. Rajaraja evidently gave his army its due share in the glory derived from his extensive conquests. The army composed chiefly of Kaikolars (men with stronger arms), which were royal troops receiving regular payments from the treasury. (e.g. Arul mozhideva-terinda-kaikola padai; in this, arulmozhideva is the king's name, terinda means well known, and padai means regime) The following regiments are mentioned in the Tanjavur inscriptions: * Uttama- Chola-terinda-Andalagattalar * Perundanattu Anaiyatkal ‚Äì Elephant corps. * Pandita-Chola-Terinda-villigal ‚Äì Archers * Nigarili- Chola terinda-Udanilai-Kudiraichchevagar ‚Äì Cavalry * Mummadi- Chola-terinda-Anaippagar ‚Äì Elephant corps * Vira- Chola-Anukkar * Parantaka-Kongavalar ‚Äì Light Infantry * Mummadi- Chola-terinda-parivarattar * Keralantaka-terinda-parivarattar * Mulaparivara-vitteru alias Jananatha- terinda-parivarattar * Singalantaka-terinda-parivarattar * Sirudanattu Vadugakkalavar * Valangai-Parambadaigalilar * Sirudanattu-Valangai- Velaikkarappadaigal * Aragiya- Chola-terinda-Valangai-Velaikkarar * Aridurgalanghana-terinda-Valangai-Velaikkarar * Chandaparakrama-terinda- Valangai-Velaikkarar * Ilaiya-Rajaraja-terinda-Valangai-Velaikkarar * Kshatriyasikhamani-terinda-Valangai-Velaikkarar * Murtavikramabharana-terinda- Valangai-Velaikkarar * Rajakanthirava-terinda-Valangai-Velaikkarar * Rajaraja- terinda-Valangai-Velaikkarar * Rajavinoda-terinda-Valangai-Velaikkarar * Ranamukha-Bhima-terinda-Valangai-Velaikkarar * Vikramabharana-terinda- Valangai-Velaikkarar * Keralantaka-vasal-tirumeykappar * Anukka-vasal- tirumeykappar ‚Äì Personal bodyguards * Parivarameykappargal ‚Äì Personal bodyguards * Palavagai-Parampadaigalilar * Perundanattu-Valangai- Velaikkarappadaigal Velaikkarappadaigal or Velaikkarar is the equivalent of \\"Guards regiment\\" or \\"King's Regiment\\"‚Äîa royal suffix given in honor of their loyalty and bravery. Some historians like Stein also propose that they were drawn from the civilian population during wartime, suggesting they were more like a national guard. They are mentioned in the Mahavamsa; according to that account, the Sinhalese kingdom tried to use them as mercenaries against the Chola empire. They were later silenced and decommissioned when they refused and rebelled. There are almost seventy of such regiments that have been found in these inscriptions. In most of the foregoing names, the first portion appears to be the surnames or titles of the king himself or that of his son. That these regiments were called after the king or his son shows the attachment that the Chola king bore towards his army. It may not be unreasonable to suppose that these royal names were prefixed to the designations of these regiments after they had distinguished themselves in some engagement or other. It is worthy of note that there are elephant troops, cavalry and foot soldiers among these regiments. Top officers took various titles after the different kings such as Rajaraja chola Brahmarajan, Rajarajakesari Muvendavelar, Jayamkondachola Villuparaiyar, Uttamachola Muvendavelar, Manukula Muvendavelar, Nittavinotha Muvendavelar, Atirajendra Muvendavelar, Mummudi chola pallavaraiyar, and Viranarayanan Muvendavelan.The Travancore state manual, Volume 1, page 192  Garrisons  The army was stationed throughout the country in the form of local garrisons and in cantonments called Kadagams. After the troubles in the Pandya country, Kulothunga Chola I stationed his army in a number of military colonies along the main route to Pandya from Chola lands. One such colony was found at Kottaru and another at Madavilagam near South Arcot district in Tamil Nadu.South Indian Inscriptions, vol. 3  Recruitment  There are no records of Chola recruitment methods or the number of permanent troops in the army. In feudal times, the children of warriors and soldiers readily joined the army in keeping with the spirit of chivalry and Tamil martial tradition. They were a highly motivated and professionally trained force with a very strong martial tradition. Some of the regiments clearly had martial customs and history of their own and the members of such regiments clearly exhibited high levels of discipline, pride and self-esteem. The presence of military cantonments called Kadagam in Sangam Tamil indicates that there were regular training and military practices as part of the Tamil martial arts tradition. The Palayam system was based on a feudal class structure of warriors, farmers, artisans and merchants, where the distinctions between the caste statuses of the constituent classes were strictly enforced. To symbolize this society, Tamil warriors wore swords in everyday life because the system was maintained by their military prowess. These martial tradition and practices were later outlawed by the British. The modern Indian army has a Madras regiment that serves as the sole unit for all of South India. There were military colonies known as nilai puram. A nilaipuram contained a number of forts. In Keralasinga Valanadu of the North Pandya country, there were five nilaipurams. These were named after the five coronational names of the Pandyas: Sundara, Kulasekhara, Vikrama, Vira, and Parakrama Pandya.  Navy  The Chola Navy comprised the naval forces of the Chola Empire along with several other naval arms of the country. It played a vital role in the expansion of the Chola Empire, including the conquest of the Ceylon islands and Sri Vijaya (present-day Indonesia), the spread of Shaivism, Tamil architecture and Tamil culture to Southeast Asia, and in curbing the piracy in Southeast Asia in the tenth century. There is evidence that even in the time of Parantaka I, there was a considerable navy involved in the numerous invasions of Lanka. Rajendra Chola's naval victories in Srivijaya were a culmination of centuries of naval tradition. All the Tamil kingdoms had some sort of navy in their arsenal. The Cholas continued the ancient tradition and gave much attention to developing their naval strength. The conquest of Sri Lanka and Maldives and the embassies sent to China show the success of the Chola Navy. The Chola Admirals acted as ambassadors in many South-East Asian Kingdoms during this time. During the reigns of RajaRaja Chola I and his son Rajendra Chola I, it is said that the Cholan navy had over one million naval soldiers. Many types of ships (including Colandia) and naval weapons were employed in the navy.  Impact on populace  Judging from the inscriptions of the Cholas themselves, life was made intolerable for the population living on either side of the Tungabhadra by the bitterness and the regularity of the Chola-Chalukya wars that eventually exhausted both empires. The evidence from Lanka and the Chalukya countries indicates that even the common rules of fair fighting and chivalry were often ignored and wanton injury was inflicted upon the non-combatant population. The Chola army collected much loot from these conflicts. The treasure collected must have been enormous and were distributed by the king to public endowments and institutions.

Anglican and Episcopalian Churches Eucharistic Minister, or more properly \\"Lay Eucharistic Minister LEM\\", is used to denote a lay person who assists the priest in administering the sacraments of holy communion, the consecrated bread and wine. They may also take the sacraments to those who are ill, or otherwise unable to attend Mass. LEMs usually vest in cassock and surplice rather than Alb. Although the practice varies from Diocese to Diocese in general LEMs are recommended by the parish priest to the Bishop of the Diocese, who grants them a three-year license to practice the ministry. This license is often renewed at the priest's discretion for subsequent three year terms. Methodist Churches In many Methodist Churches, communion stewards assist the minister in the distribution of Holy Communion to the congregation during the Liturgy of the Eucharist. These individuals also aid the minister in consuming any remaining Eucharistic elements after the distribution has been completed, although some of it is reserved to be taken to the sick in hospitals and in their homes. Catholic Church Only a validly ordained priest can validly consecrate the Eucharist. As stated in Canon Law, \\"The ordinary minister of holy communion is a bishop, presbyter, or deacon.\\" and \\"The extraordinary minister of holy communion is an acolyte or another member of the Christian faithful designated according to the norm of ‚áí can. 230, ¬ß3.\\" \\"[T]he name ‚Äúminister of the Eucharist‚Äù belongs properly to the Priest alone.\\" That is also specified in the Vatican instruction Redemptionis sacramentum. Section 154 of RS states: \\"the only minister who can confect the Sacrament of the Eucharist in persona Christi is a validly ordained Priest. Hence the name ‚Äúminister of the Eucharist‚Äù belongs properly to the Priest alone.\\" The distribution of Holy Communion is done by the priest, often with one or more ministers, depending on the number of people receiving Holy Communion. There are two types of assistants: ordained (ordinary) ministers, and extraordinary ministers. An \\"Ordinary Minister of Holy Communion\\" is an ordained Bishop, Priest, or Deacon. See also section 154 of RS. The term \\"Ordinary\\" refers to the fact that ordained ministers are the ones who would ordinarily assist in the distribution of Holy Communion. The shortage of ordained ministers, and large numbers of communicants, has led to the practice of deputing lay persons for this function. An \\"Extraordinary Minister of Holy Communion\\" is a Catholic lay person who assists in the distribution of Holy Communion, either during the Mass, or afterwards, such as to housebound persons. Section 156 of RS prohibits the use of other titles for these lay persons. Section 158 of RS provides instructions on the use of EMHCs: \\"the extraordinary minister of Holy Communion may administer Communion only when the Priest and Deacon are lacking, when the Priest is prevented by weakness or advanced age or some other genuine reason, or when the number of faithful coming to Communion is so great that the very celebration of Mass would be unduly prolonged.\\" References Category:Eucharist Category:Ecclesiastical titles ","title":"Eucharistic Minister"},{"id":"4858526","text":"A variety of methods are used in econometrics to estimate models consisting of a single equation.

There is also a waterslide next to the lake. To prevent contamination of the drinking water, water from the lake is piped to a terminal reservoir, where it remains to allow particles to settle out and pathogens to die off. The water then goes through flocculation, filtration and chlorination at the Lopez Water Treatment Plant. The recreation area consists of of open space, trails and camping areas.

Early years and career Anuj Nayyar was born and grew up in Delhi, India. His father, S.K. Nayyar, worked as a visiting professor in Delhi School of Economics while his mother, Meena Nayyar, worked for the South Campus library of Delhi University. Nayyar received his high-school education from Army Public School, Dhaula Kuan (1993 batch). He was a bright student who consistently performed well in academics and sports. He graduated from the National Defence Academy (90th course, Echo Squadron) and later was commissioned into the 17th battalion, Jat Regiment (17 Jat) in June 1997 from the Indian Military Academy (100 Reg).  Kargil conflict  =Background= In 1999, the Indian Army detected a massive infiltration by Pakistani military and paramilitary forces in the Kargil region of Jammu Kashmir. The army quickly mobilized its forces to drive out the Pakistani infiltrators from Indian territory. 17 Jat was one of the battalions deployed in the region. Nayyar's first major operation involved securing Pimple II, a peak within the Pimple Complex, on the western slopes of Point 4875, a strategic peak in the Mushkoh Valley. Due to its strategic location, securing Point 4875 was a top priority for the Indian Army. The peak, which stood at 15,990 feet above sea level, had extremely steep slopes and capturing the peak without aerial support was considered near impossible. In a last-ditch attempt, C Coy, 17 Jat, of which Nayyar was the second-in- command, decided to secure the peak without waiting for any aerial support on 6 July. =Operation= During the initial phase of C Coy's assault on Pimple II, Nayyar's company commander was injured, and command devolved upon him. As the unit advanced under heavy enemy artillery and mortar fire, the lead section reported the location of 3-4 enemy bunkers. Nayyar moved forward and destroyed the first bunker with a rocket launcher and grenades. Still under heavy fire, he then proceeded with the lead section, which consisted of 7 personnel, and destroyed two more bunkers.The soldier who became a legend During the battle, Nayyar killed 9 Pakistani soldiers and destroyed three medium machine gun bunkers.Captain Anuj Nayyar ‚Äì Bharat-Rakshak The company then began its assault on the last remaining bunker, but while clearing it, an enemy RPG directly hit Nayyar, killing him instantly.'Did he die fighting?'Leading From The Front During the entire battle for Pimple Complex, 46 regular members of the Pakistan Army, an unknown number of Pakistani paramilitary troopers and militants, and 11 Indian Army troops, including Capt. Nayyar, were killed.Fighting gets bloodier in Drass, Batalik The securing of Pimple Complex paved the way for the recapture of Tiger Hill which finally forced Pakistan to retreat back across the Line of Control.  Recognition and legacy  Nayyar was posthumously awarded the Maha Vir Chakra for his bravery and leadership in combat. Nayyar's father, S.K. Nayyar, was allotted a gas station in Delhi by the Government of India in recognition of the services of his son.

He also held the title of a margrave of Raetia Curiensis, as well as count in the Thurgau and Baar. Life Burchard was the son of Adalbert II the Illustrious, Count of Thurgau, and his wife Judith of Friuli. By 900, Burchard was already the most powerful noble in Alamannia. In a 904 deed, he appeared as Vogt administrator of the Swabian possessions of Lorsch Abbey. He succeeded the Welf scion Ruadulf in the borderlands of Raetia, mentioned as marchio (margrave) in 903 and dux (duke) in 909. To further increase his influence, Burchard entered into a conflict with the Swabian count palatine Erchanger and Bishop Solomon III of Constance, who both were loyal supporters to the later East Frankish king Conrad I. In turn, Burchard was captured and charged with high treason. He was found guilty by a tribal council and executed, along with his brother, Count Adalbert III of Thurgau. His son, Burchard II, and his daughter-in-law, Regelinda, left for Italy, either exiled or taking refuge. Their Rhaetian estates were lost, though later recovered. Count Palatine Erchanger proclaimed himself Duke of Swabia in 915. Issue About 882 Burchard married one Liutgard (possibly the Ottonian princess Liutgard of Saxony, widow of King Louis the Younger) and had the following children: *Burchard II (d. 926), succeeded as Duke of Swabia in 917 *Dietpirch of Swabia (also known as Theoberga) married Hupald of Dillingen (d. 909). *Odalric, count in the Thurgau and Z√ºrichgau, had issue.

S. Forester set in the Mediterranean during World War II, and first published in May 1943. It follows the life of a Royal Navy light cruiser for a single action, including a detailed analysis of many of the men on board and the contribution they made.  Plot  A vital convoy is heading to Malta, escorted by five Royal Navy light cruisers, including HMS Artemis. It is afternoon, and Artemis, commanded by Captain Troughton-Harrington-Yorke, has just beaten off a number of air attacks. An Italian surface fleet, with the battleships San Martino and Legnano and several light cruisers, will intercept it soon. The convoy must get through, so the British ships must fight. The crew, from the command level officers on the bridge down to the ordinary seamen in the lower decks, prepares for the coming confrontation, while part of them is also occupied with their own, very colorful lives. Upon receiving reports from the lookouts at the masthead of enemy ships ahead, the cruisers lay a smoke screen, then attack. The ship sustains two hits, the first of which kills the ship's surgeon and several other crewmembers, while the second one does more damage to the ship and requires the flooding of \\"X\\" gun turret aft. The other two turrets continue to fire upon the Italian fleet, while destroyers lay a torpedo attack. A single shell, whose history from the mining of the ores to the firing of the gun is described in detail, hits the Italian flagship and strikes the final blow to the morale of the enemy commanders. With the San Martino being hit by a torpedo, the Italian fleet retires as night falls, and the convoy continues for Malta. The captain remains on the bridge, more determined than ever to continue \\"the long struggle of sea power against tyranny\\", which so many naval commanders fought before him.C. S.

The narrative interweaves the stories of the men aboard, from the Paymaster Commander to the Captain to the gun crew that fires the shot that changed the course of history, with chapter headings that come from the Captain's official after-action report.  Background  The author dedicated the book \\"with the deepest respect to the officers and crew of \\", and the action described is based on the Second Battle of Sirte. Forester had been invited to a mission aboard that vessel by the Admiralty earlier. Less than a year after the book was published, the Penelope was torpedoed by a German submarine and sank with more than half her crew.

This was the seventh episode of the ninth and final season. It first aired on November 13, 1997.\\"The Slicer\\" - TV.com Plot George applies for an interview with Kruger Industrial Smoothing and gets the job, but notices a picture of Kruger (Daniel von Bargen) and his family at the beach with a not-so-bald George in the background in Kruger's office. Later George tells Kramer and Jerry at Monk's Caf√© about the \\"boombox incident\\" that occurred in the summer of 1989: George was at the beach and a family sat down next to him. After returning from swimming in the surf, George found all his things gone. After screaming at the kids, he became so angry he threw their boombox into the ocean. Moments later, he found his things in the water and realized that the tide, not the kids, had taken them out. The father (Kruger) demanded George pay for the boombox, so George evaded it by giving him a fake address. Now, George is worried that he may get fired once Kruger recognizes him from the picture. Kramer suggests sneaking the picture out and getting George's image airbrushed out. George takes to the idea and leaves. Meanwhile, Kramer is annoyed at the \\"misshaped, shoddy meats\\" in the sandwiches he eats, stating that he \\"hasn't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.\\" He solves his problem by getting a meat slicer. Elaine can't sleep because her neighbor forgot to turn off the alarm clock before leaving for Paris. Kramer tells her that the same thing happened to his friend Lomez, so he (Lomez) blew his neighbor's circuit. He and Elaine then set off to do just that. Meanwhile, Jerry begins dating a doctor, Sara Sitarides (Marcia Cross). The next day, George goes to pick up the picture, but finds out Kruger was airbrushed out instead of him (due to Kruger's baldness, the clerk mistook him for George, since George in the picture still had hair. He also points this out to George, annoying him further). Elaine realizes her neighbor's cat (whose meowing is worse than the alarm clock) now can't eat because shutting off the power also shut off its automatic feeder. Jerry tells Elaine his date with Dr. Sitarides didn't go well because she kept making him feel like \\"if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.\\" Elaine then reveals that Sitarides is a dermatologist and Jerry gets annoyed at this, not considering a dermatologist to be a \\"life-saver\\", and noting that their advice to patients is simply to \\"put some Aloe on it.\\" George convinces him to go on a \\"revenge date\\" to tell her off. Elaine and Kramer go back to Elaine's apartment with the meat slicer and feed the cat under the door. Elaine borrows Kramer's slicer, but uses it for slicing other things, including an uneven pair of heels. She eventually gets a piece of her heel stuck in it. Jerry's revenge date doesn't go well when a former patient of Sitarides' comes up and thanks her for saving his life. The reason: he had skin cancer. George goes back to the Foto Hut, and finds himself airbrushed out, and only a drawing of Kruger back in. He then realizes he has to get a photo of his boss without his shirt on (as he was in the picture) to put back in. When Elaine drops by to pick up pliers to remove the heel from Kramer's slicer, she drops a helpful tip about how Sitarides goes by offices screening people for skin cancer (that's how they met). George then realizes all he has to do is set up a screening at Kruger's and he can get his picture (after Jerry apologizes to Sitarides). Kramer goes to Elaine's to pick up his slicer. She manages to get the heel out just in time, but dings up the blade in the process. When trying to get back into Elaine's apartment, he accidentally pulls off her doorknob, trapping her inside. Jerry starts getting an allergic reaction. Kramer thinks Sitarides gave it to him when he went down to apologize to her. He decides to go down to Kruger's - where Sitarides is doing the cancer screening - and ask her. Kramer comes along to pick up his blade. Jerry insults Sitarides and causes her to leave. As Kruger comes in for his screening, Kramer (with his white butcher's coat on) takes Sitarides's place as the doctor (Dr. Van Nostrand). Kramer then checks Kruger for moles (\\"the freckle's ugly cousin,\\" as Kramer puts it). He takes a picture of Kruger for George, but finds a mole on Kruger's right shoulder. To drown out the cat's meowing, Elaine turns up her stereo to max volume. As she tries to call a locksmith to fix her door, one of her neighbors keeps yelling at her to shut off her radio, before finally getting fed up and blowing Elaine's circuit like she and Kramer did, cutting off her call to the locksmith and leaving her without power. George gets the picture fixed and Kramer starts getting into dermatology. While flipping through one of Kramer's medical books, Jerry finds a section on his condition and figures out that his hives came from an allergic reaction to Benzene, commonly used as a metal cleaner. Kramer had been using Jerry's hand towel with metal cleaner to clean his slicer blade, and gave him hives. George returns to work and suggests Kruger go see another dermatologist about his mole, but finds Kruger isn't worried about it. Because the mole is visible in the picture (which he thinks was taken in 1989), he thinks it hasn't grown. Kruger then reveals to George about that day when he and his kids took this \\"pear-shaped loser[s]\\" clothes and threw it all in the ocean. Finally learning the truth, George gets mad and informs him that the pear-shaped loser was him and that he went to great lengths to remove himself from Kruger's family picture; Kruger replies, \\"Well I'll be - you have lost a lot of hair.\\" George answers, \\"That's what they tell me!\\" At the end of the episode, Kramer, George and Jerry camp outside Elaine's apartment, feeding her under the door until the locksmith arrives. Jerry sees another dermatologist who prescribed him Aloe to treat his hives and George ends up not getting fired anyway because Kruger \\"didn't care.\\" References External links * Category:Seinfeld (season 9) episodes Category:1997 American television episodes ","title":"The Slicer"},{"id":"4858763","text":"Agent Z and the Penguin from Mars is a 1996 Children's BBC sitcom, based on the book of the same name by Mark Haddon. The six episode series followed the exploits of Ben Simpson, played by Duncan Barton, and his friends Barney, played by Andrew McKay, and Jenks, played by Reggie Yates, who together formed the \\"Crane Grove Gang\\", named after the street where they lived. This was a society dedicated to playing ingenious practical jokes in an initiative called \\"Agent Z\\". Plot Following the arrival of an unpleasant and dull new astronomer neighbour Dennis Sidebottom, a supposed lottery winner, the gang plot their biggest ever practical joke: an elaborate conspiracy involving a penguin stolen from a supermarket Christmas display, an alien from Mars, a spaceship and a \\"message for mankind\\" carved on a meteorite. The series also included a number of subplots, such as Ben's infatuation with Sidebottom's pianist daughter, Samantha, and the thieving activities of the Sidebottom's disturbing son, Tod - on one occasion he is caught shoplifting a large quantity of Dolly Parton albums. It was also notable for its realisations of Ben's fevered imagination, which led to extravagant dream sequences, such as a recurring image of him as a millionaire, complete with a well-spoken butler called Finlay, and another featuring Sidebottom as a vampire. Broadcast The series was first shown on Wednesdays from 3 January 1996 to 7 February 1996. Although well received it has not been repeated, nor released to DVD, despite the renewed interest in the work of Mark Haddon following the publication of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.

Originally developed as a civilian airliner and successor to the Ca.101, the Ca.133 prototype first flew in December 1934, and production began in 1935. The military versions of the aircraft were used as transports and light bombers and saw action on all fronts. A stretched transport version of the aircraft was produced as the Caproni Ca.148. Design Designed by ingegnere Rodolfo Verduzio, the Caproni 133 was aerodynamically and structurally an improved Ca.101.Mondey 2006, p. 34. Like its predecessor, the Ca.101, was a robust and inexpensive aircraft, designed to be easily maintained in difficult conditions and economical to operate. It had a welded steel-tube structure, mixed construction, with metal and fabric covering, main wheel spats, flaps and modified tail surfaces.Mondey 2006, p. 76. The wing was high-mounted, roughly elliptical, and made of wood and steel. The undercarriage was spatted and fixed. The aircraft was powered by three engines, one in the nose, and one under each wing mounted in faired nacelles, with NACA cowlings, supported by steel tubes. The civil version could accommodate up to 16 passengers. It was used by Ala Littoria. The military version was widely used by Regia Aeronautica, mostly in Italian East Africa. As a bomber it incorporated two small internal bomb bays where it could hold up to 500 kg (1,100 lb). Larger ordnance could be mounted externally. It was armed with four 7.7 mm (.303 in) Breda-SAFAT machine guns, one dorsal, one ventral, and two lateral. Bomber aircraft operated as military transports, redesignated Ca 133T, had their interiors modified to accommodate 18 fully equipped soldiers. Operational service =Second Italo-Abyssinian War (1935‚Äì1936)= The Ca.133 was well-suited for colonial use, and it became the most successful of all Italian colonial aircraft. The more advanced Savoia- Marchetti SM.81s were too valuable to be used in 'low level wars' and were also more costly. The war was thus fought mainly with the Ca.101, Ca.111 and Ca.133. Around 100 Ca.133s took part in the conflict, and as well as 'normal' bombing and strafing, they were often equipped with mustard gas and Phosgene chemical bombs. These weapons were forbidden by the Geneva Protocol of 1925, but in this war (and in Libya) the Italians ignored the convention. The Ca.133s were also used as transports to support the army, as well as reconnaissance aircraft. Without any air opposition, and flak almost exclusively based on small-calibre arms, air power was a decisive factor in Italy's final victory, culminating in the capture of Addis Ababa in early 1936. Even so, COIN (COunter INsurgency) operations continued until the start of World War II. =Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì1939)= While in Ethiopia they were widely used, in Spain the Ca.133 was found to be too slow, and highly vulnerable to enemy Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 aircraft, also to heavy anti- aircraft fire. =World War II (1939‚Äì1945)= In mainland Italy, the Ca.133 was used mostly as a light transport aircraft supporting fighter and bomber squadrons by carrying supplies, personnel and spare parts. The Regia Aeronautica soon realized that despite its improvements, the type was suitable for combat in North and East Africa. At the outbreak of war the Ca.133 equipped 14 Squadriglie da Bombardamento in these theatres.Sharpe 2000, p. 143. In East Africa, it was still used as bomber and attack aircraft. Occasionally it even managed to shoot down enemy aircraft.Sutherland and Canwell 2009, p. 94. On 12 June 1940, in the south region, three Ca.133s of 66¬™ Squadriglia from Yavello attacked an Allied column of half a dozen trucks and 200 men. Ca.133s of 65¬™ Squadriglia, from Neghelli, attacked the Allied positions around Moyale on two occasions, each time with three aircraft. That night, ten Caproni Ca.133s bombed the port of Aden and Khormaksar airfield, already attacked during daylight hours by seven SM.81s of 29¬∞ Gruppo. Three other Capronis attacked Cassala airfield in the Sudan.Sutherland 2009, p. 32. On 23 January 1941, a Ca.133 shot down an Avro Anson flown by Lt E.A. Gebhardt of 60 SAAF Squadron, that crashed before anyone could bale out. It was also used as an air ambulance with the Ca.133S (Sanitary) variant. Over 250 Ca.133s were in service in September 1939, when the war broke out. Some survived until the Armistice in 1943. =Postwar= A handful were retained for civilian service with the airline Ala Littoria. Some were exported to Austria. The last Ca.133 was phased out by the Aeronautica Militare in 1947, and the last Ca.148 flew until 1956 with the Italian Aeroclub.

He stated that there was a lack of outrage over the incident among South Koreans due to the racialized nature of Korean nationalism; in other words, there was no major uproar over the incident in South Korea because of the concept of racial solidarity with the North Koreans that many South Koreans feel, which Myers said overruled patriotism towards South Korea in many cases. Myers stated that inter-Korean racial solidarity manifests itself by South Koreans supporting the North Korean soccer team at the FIFA World Cup and such. He contrasted the racialized nature of South Korean nationalism with the civic nature of U.S. nationalism, stating that South Korea's antipathy over attacks by North Korea was potentially dangerous to the national security of the South Korean state: Book reviews His book reviews have included denunciations of American historian Bruce Cumings,‚ÄúMother of All Mothers: The Leadership Secrets of Kim Jong Il.‚Äù Atlantic.

The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters (2010) is a discussion of North Korean propaganda, contending that North Korea under Kim Jong-il was guided by a \\"paranoid, race-based nationalism with roots in Japanese fascism.\\"‚ÄúBook Discussion with Author B. R. Myers.‚Äù North Korea International Documentation Project. Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. (Accessed February 1, 2010) Myers asserts that the North Korean political system is not based on communism or Stalinism, and he contends that the official Juche idea is a sham ideology for foreign consumption and intended to establish Kim Il-sung's credentials as a thinker alongside Mao Zedong. Myers also claims that post-Cold War attempts to understand North Korea as a Confucian patriarchy, based on the filial piety of Kim Jong-il and the dynastic transfer of power from his father, are misguided and that the North Korean leadership is maternalist rather than paternalist. Myers furthers his argument about the status of Juche as a non-ideology in his book North Korea's Juche Myth (2015). According to his own account, promoting him to write the book was the realization he was making \\"not the slightest bit of headway\\" with The Cleanest Race in challenging the conventional wisdom about Juche in the academia. North Korea's Juche Myth develops a three-pronged categorization of North Korean propaganda. Some works are in the \\"inner track\\", meant for North Korean eyes only. Others are in the \\"outer track\\", meant primarily for North Korean consumption but mindful of the fact that foreigners can access them too. \\"Export track\\" propaganda specifically targets foreigners. Reception and criticism Myers‚Äô book The Cleanest Race has been challenged by several academic critics.Charles K. Armstrong, \\"Trends in the Study of North Korea,\\" Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 70, 2011; and Suzy Kim, \\"(Dis)orienting North Korea,\\" Critical Asian Studies, Vol. 42, No. 3, September 2010. Charles K. Armstrong of Columbia University suggested that the book \\"gives an intellectual gloss to attitudes many in the West already have about the DPRK\\".Charles K. Armstrong, \\"Trends in the Study of North Korea,\\" Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 70, 2011, p 360. Felix Abt, a Swiss business affairs specialist who lived in North Korea for seven years, describes Myers' claims in The Cleanest Race as \\"flawed\\" and \\"shaky\\". Abt wrote that it was \\"rather absurd\\" to describe Juche as \\"window-dressing\\" for foreigners. South Korean literary critic Yearn Hong Choi also regards the thesis of Myers' Han S«írya and North Korean Literature as erroneous: Tatiana Gabroussenko points out that Myers is the only Western academic who thinks that North Korean literature does not have the hallmarks of socialist realism. Scholar Andrei Lankov favorably reviewed The Cleanest Race as taking a \\"fresh approach\\" on North Korea.Andrei Lankov. Review of The Cleanest Race. Far Eastern Economic Review. 4 December 2010. (Accessed February 1, 2010) Lankov also says Myers' work is \\"informative\\" but is not sure whether his thesis has any relation to reality. Personal life and politics Myers is married to a South Korean woman, Myung-hee Myers. He lives and teaches in South Korea, where he moved to in September 2001. During the late 1990s, he lived in Valencia County, New Mexico.A 2015 interview with B.R.

Life and career French was born in Ashland, Kentucky. In her early career as a regular on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour of the late-1960s, French portrayed a somewhat spaced-out or ditzy hippie named Goldie O'Keefe. The character was originally introduced, in an ostensible studio-audience interview segment, as Goldie Keif; both \\"Goldie\\" and \\"Keif\\" were slang terms for marijuana at the time. Reportedly, the slight name change to O'Keefe when she became a semi-regular was at the television network's insistence. Her segment of the show was called \\"Share a Little Tea with Goldie.\\" At the time, \\"sharing tea\\" was a popular euphemism for getting high on marijuana. Following suit, her segment consisted largely of \\"helpful\\" household advice loaded with sex and drug-related double- entendres. French played a similar character, a San Francisco hippie type named Cobalt-Blue, in a 1968 episode (\\"Tag, You're It\\") of the I Spy series. She and Rob Reiner (both of whom had been members of The Committee improv group in San Francisco) also played hippies in the 1969 \\"Flower Power\\" episode of Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. French can also be seen in such films as WUSA (1970), The Drowning Pool (1975), Aloha, Bobby and Rose (1975), The Hollywood Knights (1980), and The Long Days of Summer (1980). Leigh also appeared as Goober Pyle's (George Lindsey) sister on a pilot episode for a sitcom called Goober & the Truckers' Paradise. The show, in which Goober and his sister managed a highway truck stop, was not picked up by the networks. French has worked steadily, if quietly, over the years, primarily behind the scenes and doing voiceover roles in animated features.

Originally organized in 1883, it is currently the largest district in the Texas Education Agency's Educational Service Center (ESC) Region 19, as well as the largest district within the city of El Paso and El Paso County. The EPISD also provides public education to the children of U.S. Army soldiers stationed at Fort Bliss. The district headquarters are located in El Paso.\\"Contact the El Paso Independent School District .\\" El Paso Independent School District. Retrieved on March 28, 2010. In 2009, the school district was rated \\"academically acceptable\\" by the Texas Education Agency. Board of Trustees The EPISD is managed by a school board (called the Board of Trustees) composed of seven publicly elected school board trustees and a single superintendent. Each trustee represents one of the seven districts in the EPISD. Vernon Butler is interim superintendent of EPISD. In December 2012 the commission of the Texas Education Agency, Michael Williams, appointed a five-person board of managers and a conservator to oversee the district instead of the Board of Trustees, because the board failed to stop the cheating scandal conducted by previous superintendent Lorenzo Garcia and failed to fire his co-conspirators after he was arrested by the FBI in August 2011. The board of managers includes Ed Archuleta, Carmen Arrieta-Candelaria, Judy Castleberry, Blanca Enriquez, and Dee Margo. Castleberry was also appointed as conservator. The board of managers can remain in power up to two years, although there are elections for trustees scheduled for 2013. The trustees are appealing this to the Department of Justice.

The company, officially called Empresas Taj√≠n, is located in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico. Taj√≠n was originally created by Fernandez's grandmother, \\"Mama Necha\\", as a sauce. Fernandez wanted to recreate the sauce in powder form so he could market it to the world, and was intent on developing a process to dehydrate the chilis and limes. After visiting the pre-Columbian archaeological site El Taj√≠n in the state of Veracruz, Fernandez decided to name his product after it. Taj√≠n entered the U.S. market in 1993. A bottle of Taj√≠n Cl√°sico seasoning. Mandarin oranges in a bowl within a bowl of popcorn, both sprinkled in Taj√≠n powdered seasoning.  Taj√≠n Cl√°sico Seasoning  The company's most popular product is a seasoning powder, often referred to as simply Taj√≠n, consisting of ground chilli peppers, sea salt, and dehydrated lime juice. It is the #1 chili lime seasoning in the U.S. today and continues to grow at a double-digit pace. The powder is tangy and spicy, and has a color ranging from amber to carmine. It is often added to food as a condiment, most commonly fruits such as watermelon, mango, oranges, papaya, and cucumbers, however it is also known to be used to season popcorn, fruit juice, meat, and to rim drink glasses. Taj√≠n is also used occasionally as an ingredient in micheladas, a beer cocktail. The seasoning is widely available in Mexico and is found in nearly every store in the country.  Taj√≠n Spicy Cl√°sico Snack Sauce  Empresas Taj√≠n also produces a couple varieties of salsa, such as the Taj√≠n Snack Sauce. The ingredients are nearly identical to their powdered seasoning counterpart, only in a liquid blend. Similarly to Tapatio and Valentina hot sauces, Taj√≠n Snack Sauce is red in color and has a viscosity moderately higher than that of water. Like its powder counterpart, the sauce is added to fruits and meats, mixed into drinks, and used as a dip for chips and popcorn.  Collaborations with other brands  Among its other variations of salsas and Taj√≠n (such as a habanero flavor variant and a low sodium variant of their powdered seasoning), the chili seasoning company has collaborated with other brands to manufacture Taj√≠n flavored variants. One such example is with On The Border, a brand of tortilla chips, to create On The Border Taste of Taj√≠n. Taj√≠n has also collaborated with Snak Club, releasing three variants of Taj√≠n flavored snack mixes: tropical mix, toasted corn, and peanuts.

Career =St Johnstone= Parker, a striker, began his career with Scottish club St Johnstone, where he made a promising start to his career and was being tipped by many to have a big future. While at St Johnstone, he gained one cap for the Scotland U-21 team. Unable to impress enough at McDiarmid Park, in 2004, after six years in Perth, he joined Blackpool on a free transfer. =Blackpool= Parker was the first signing made by then Blackpool manager Colin Hendry in June 2004. He made his d√©but for the club on 7 August 2004 as a substitute in a 2‚Äì0 defeat at Doncaster Rovers and made his full d√©but three days later in a 2‚Äì1 defeat at home to Sheffield Wednesday. His first goal came on 29 September in a 2‚Äì0 win over York City. In December 2004 he scored a second-half hat-trick at Bloomfield Road against Torquay United. With Blackpool, Parker found some consistency while the club were in League One but failed to hold down a place in the side when they were promoted to The Championship in the 2007‚Äì08 season. He made his 100th league appearance for Blackpool on 30 December 2006, in a 3‚Äì1 win over Doncaster Rovers at Bloomfield Road. On 27 May 2007, Parker scored Blackpool's second goal in their 2‚Äì0 win against Yeovil Town in the League One play-off final at Wembley, a result that promoted Blackpool to The Championship.Yeovil 0‚Äì2 Blackpool ‚Äì BBC Sport \\"It's the best day of my career,\\" he said afterwards. \\"I've scored against Celtic and Rangers before, but to win at Wembley is something I'll treasure for the rest of my life.\\" It was also his last goal for the club. Parker finished the 2006‚Äì07 season as the club's second-top scorer with sixteen goals in all competitions. He failed to secure a regular place in the starting line-up in the 2007‚Äì08 season and in the January 2008 transfer window, he rejected a move to Barnsley. His last appearance for the club came on 15 March 2008 against local rivals Preston North End and on 7 May, he was released by Blackpool. He had not featured in the first team during the final two months of the 2007‚Äì08 season and had made just 17 appearances for the club throughout the season, failing to score a goal. \\"The last three months have been a bit of a nightmare,\\" he explained at the time. \\"I've had four great years and last season was fantastic, especially at Wembley, but I'll be moving on in the summer.\\" On 15 May 2008, Parker stated that he was not released by Blackpool, that he had turned down the offer of a new contract earlier in the season and had then allowed his existing deal to run out. He was linked with moves to Huddersfield Town, Swansea City, Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen and Southampton, with Parker saying, \\"There are five or six clubs who are interested. It depends on a few issues but I should know more in the next couple of weeks.\\" =English career after leaving Blackpool= On 27 May 2008, Parker agreed to join Huddersfield Town on a two-year contract, subject to a medical. His first appearance for Town came in their 4‚Äì0 win against Bradford City on 12 August 2008, when he played the final ten minutes of the match. His first league appearance was again as a substitute in a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Milton Keynes Dons on 23 August. His first league goal came on 1 November, to give Huddersfield a 3‚Äì2 victory over Crewe Alexandra at the Galpharm Stadium. He was sent off in added time for two yellow cards. His first away goal for the club came in the 4‚Äì2 defeat by Leicester City on 24 January 2009. On 2 March 2009, Parker joined fellow Football League One side Hartlepool United on loan after being locked out of the Town side by new loan signing Lukas Jutkiewicz and Danny Cadamarteri amongst others. He made his debut the following day in the 2‚Äì1 win against Tranmere Rovers at Victoria Park but failed to score in nine starts and returned to Huddersfield. On 21 July 2009, Parker agreed a one-year deal at Oldham Athletic, which was completed the following day. On 18 March 2010, Parker was loaned for a month-long to Football League Two club Bury. After returning to Oldham Athletic after his loan spell, Parker was released from his contract in line with close-season streamlining at the club. After being released by Oldham Athletic, Parker signed for Mansfield Town on 20 July 2010 and was unveiled to the Mansfield fans before their pre-season friendly match against local rivals Nottingham Forest. He then went on loan to Fleetwood Town and scored on his debut against Grimsby Town. In August 2011, he joined Stockport County but was released on 25 August. Following his release from Stockport, Parker joined North West Counties League Premier Division club AFC Blackpool in September 2011. Parker joined Northern Premier League Division One North club AFC Fylde in September 2011 just days after signing for AFC Blackpool, scoring 13 goals in 28 games for the Coasters. =Ayr United= On 1 February 2012 Parker joined Scottish First Division side Ayr United on a free transfer from Fylde. Parker made his d√©but for Ayr United on 11 February 2012 in a Scottish First Division match against Queen of the South. Parker scored his first goal for the Honest Men against Partick Thistle at Firhill, United lost 4‚Äì2. On Saturday 28 April Parker scored 2 goals in a 3 ‚Äì 2 victory for Ayr over high flying Dundee. His second goal of that game, a spectacular overhead kick, was voted goal of the season across the three divisions of the SFL. =Cork City= Parker signed for Cork City in July 2012. Keigan made his League of Ireland home Debut against Shelbourne F.C. on 27 July 2012, coming on as a 70th-minute substitute only to get a straight red card 15 minutes later to the absolute annoyance of the home support. His stint with the club is sarcastically remembered in good light and the fans still jokingly chant his name despite the relatively short spell at the club. =Later career= Parker signed for Junior side Irvine Meadow in late October 2012 and was released on 28 February 2013. Parker then signed for Junior side Shettleston on 1 March 2013. Parker signed for Airdrie on 2 January 2014 after appearing as a trialist and scoring the winning goal against Arbroath. He was released by the club in February 2015. On 2 February 2015, Parker signed for Clyde on a six-month contract, after being released by Airdrieonians earlier the same day. Parker made his debut alongside Scott McLaughlin in a 2-0 win over Albion Rovers at Cliftonhill assisting the second goal. Parker was released from Clyde in May 2015 after failing to earn a new contract. Parker signed for West Lancashire league club, Wyre Villa in 2016. He scored two goals on his debut, a 4-1 win over Dalton United. On 19 January 2017, Parker signed for Scottish Junior Club Thorniewood United until the end of the season.

In desperation, he joins the 1-2-1 Singles Club and meets other people (whom one could describe as misfits), who have fared equally unfortunately in their romantic lives. The outside shots of houses were filmed in Melthorne Drive, South Ruislip. In 1988, an American adaptation of Dear John was produced by Paramount for the NBC network, starring Judd Hirsch. That series lasted for four seasons. Characters = Major characters = *John Lacey (Ralph Bates) ‚Äî a secondary-school teacher whose wife leaves him for his best friend, Mike. He is thrown out of his home and has to continue paying the mortgage on the marital home while living in a bedsit. Although John's wife is manipulative and John can be considered the wronged party, he admits in retrospect that he may have neglected his wife emotionally. He feels cut off from his son, to whom he has access only on Sundays. They end up at the zoo because it's the only place open, his son saying they've seen one penguin so many times that the first time they came \\"he was an egg\\". John's problems come from inability or unwillingness to confront someone or from being \\"too nice\\" ‚Äì situations rebound in unexpected ways. *Kate (Belinda Lang) ‚Äî an outwardly 'frigid' woman with three failed marriages. She continually spars with Kirk, whose growing lust for her becomes a running theme. At one point, she shares a bed with John, although it is suggested that nothing more than sleeping happened, as they were both drunk at the time. Eventually, she goes to Greece and finds a boyfriend (much to Kirk's dismay), only to make a surprise reappearance in the show's final episode. *Ralph Dring (Peter Denyer) ‚Äî a shy, timid & rather mousy man with absolutely no image at all, whose only real friend is a terrapin named 'Terry' and who married a Polish woman called Blomlika. She was a defector who (as Ralph tells it), worked as a welder at the Gda≈Ñsk Shipyard, was smuggled out of Poland by her brother by \\"hiding in the bottom of a Polish Army mobile field kitchen\\" and deserted Ralph on their wedding day. He develops a genuine friendship with Kirk, even though Kirk outwardly holds his boring demeanour in some disdain. He often gives Kirk a lift home on his motorcycle combination due to Kirk's 'Porsche' always \\"being in dock\\". In series two, Ralphy (as Kirk calls him) makes a \\"shrewd investment\\" by buying a mobile discotheque from a friend and adopts the persona of disc jockey Dazzling Darren Dring; a name conjured up by Kirk. Unfortunately, he only has two records in his 'collection'; Green Door by Shakin' Stevens, and another unnamed track which is scratched so it is never played. His microphone patter and act are not nearly as glitzy as his name, unanimated and interjecting his performance with such comments as \\"Get down\\", \\"Do that funky thing\\" and \\"Don't give me that jive, Clive\\" in his normal monotone voice. *Kirk St Moritz / Eric Morris (Peter Blake) ‚Äî a crass, tactless chauvinist, who claims to drive a Porsche (although the audience never sees it) and dresses in the style of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. Kirk (who claims to be a spy) is shown at the end of series one to be nothing more than an alter ego created by Eric Morris who, though he is in his mid-thirties, lives in shabby circumstances with an overbearing mother who calls him \\"Big Ears\\". His room contains a number of toy guns and models whilst the walls are covered with action movie posters. In reality, he still has the mindset of a teenager who longs for a more exciting life. His long, rambling and often preposterous anecdotes about his \\"experiences\\" cruising the California highways on his Harley Davidson, seducing nuns, military service with the Royal Marines and clandestine missions during the Vietnam War with his \\"buddy\\" Wang, contrast with the audience's newly gained knowledge that Eric is really a sad, shy man who has made little impact in wider life. In the series' final episode, however, we see that perhaps there are aspects of Kirk that are more real than perhaps even Eric realises when he displays courage and honour to protect his friends in a perilous situation. :Eric claims to John in private that Kirk represents all the qualities he aspires to, and that he has other personae, suggesting Eric has simply become a persona that he presents to his mother, just as Kirk is the persona he presents to the 1-2-1 Club. Kirk explains Eric in public as an undercover version of Kirk with his mother being his (male) operations controller in disguise who he refers to by the codename of \\"Z\\". In the series' final episode, Eric is returning with Kirk's dry-cleaned outfit when he sees his friends about to be beaten up by a group of Hells Angels. In homage to Superman, he retreats into the pub toilet and (after the Superman theme is played), emerges as Kirk, who swiftly dispatches the gang. Eric has an ongoing fascination with Kate who (as Kirk), he nicknames 'Tiger'. Although in his Kirk persona they enjoy a combative relationship with insults and barbs regularly flying between them, he claims to John, and later Kate herself, that under the surface he is \\"kind of fond of her\\". In reality, he is smitten with her and tries to get John to organise a date for him. Apart from John, the rest of the group only ever meet the Kirk alter ego. *Louise (Rachel Bell) ‚Äî the leader of the group. Something of a Sloane Ranger with a plummy accent who often ends sentences with \\"Yah?\\" or \\"You will enjoy it\\", she divorced her husband because of his fetishistic tendencies and remains obsessed with other people's sex lives. This may be her reason for organising the group and is most certainly the cause of her catchphrase \\"Were there any sexual problems?\\" She also insists on pronouncing Ralph's name in the more old-fashioned style of \\"Rafe\\". *Sylvia (Lucinda Curtis) ‚Äî a nervous woman with an irritating laugh who divorced her husband because of his transvestism. She is held as a figure of fun by Louise who, much to Sylvia's embarrassment, often persuades her to share her experiences in front of the whole group. This is seen when Sylvia is moved from her Wednesday night meeting to John's Friday night meeting. Sylvia finds John attractive and makes an attempt to invite him to her house for a romantic meal. John does not feel the same way and the two never become involved any further than friendship. It is suggested that other members of her previous Wednesday night group found her highly annoying, resulting in an attempt by one member trying to run her over with a car (twice) and another pushing her off the top of Scafell Pike. This explains the reason for her being moved to the Friday night group. = Minor characters = *Mrs Arnott (Jean Challis) ‚Äî quiet, hat-wearing Mrs Arnott (who suffers from depression) generally sits at the back dressed in dowdy clothing, occasionally chipping in with unexpected comments, such as that her husband used to make her play hoopla with ring doughnuts. Eventually, she leaves the group to look after her daughter's children when her daughter goes to work in Africa for VSO. She is often tactlessly referred to as \\"the fat lady\\" by Kirk. Even in her presence. *Toby Lacey (William Bates) ‚Äî Ralph Bates's real-life son portrays his screen son, Toby. *Wendy (Wendy Allnutt) ‚Äî John's sexually manipulative and bossy ex- wife. *Mike Taylor (Darren Traynor) ‚Äî Wendy's rugby-playing live-in lover and one of the causes of John's marriage breakdown. John's ex-best friend, Mike was helped by John when he went through a bad patch in his life. Whenever John mentions Mike, he adopts an ape-like stance and likens him to a Honey Monster. He was later played by Roger Blake. *Ken (Terence Edmond) ‚Äî Ken is John's teaching colleague and he and his wife Maggie have a strained marriage. Despite using a variety of contraceptives, he and Maggie have still managed to produce five children, whose upkeep and company he finds a constant burden. In contrast to John's simple desire to have a simple, loving relationship, Ken wants to spread his oats and has nothing but envy for what he imagines is John's new life of sexual freedom. This is due to John 'beefing up' the image of the 1-2-1 Club with ridiculous accounts of members such as \\"the Filipino twins\\", and his exploits in \\"the hot tub\\" in order to make his dull life sound much more exciting. Even though John attempts to convince Ken that the tales are pure fantasy, Ken refuses to accept this and joins the 1-2-1 Club looking for adventure. In order to validate his reasons for joining, he gives a woeful tale to the rest of the group that he and Maggie have been divorced for some time, that they are childless and he'd always wanted children. He starts to become romantically involved with Kate who sees him as a kindred spirit but the affair is discovered by Maggie after Kirk gives her an anonymous telephone tip-off. Ken never discovers the identity of the real informer and blames John. Later in the second series, Ken and Maggie seem to be working on their differences and Ken agrees to have a vasectomy. His envy for (as he sees it), John's 'freedom' as a divorcee never entirely dissipates. *Maggie (Sue Holderness) ‚Äî Ken's wife who finds him extremely irritating. *Mrs Lemenski (Irene Prador) ‚Äî John's neighbour. She is a Polish woman of advancing years, who frequently encounters John in embarrassing circumstances, such as hitting his head on the wall in frustration. She refers to him as \\"you loony person\\" or \\"fruitcake person\\". She reveals herself to be a lonely woman, who was widowed in the Second World War. *Mrs Morris (Sheila Manahan) ‚Äî Kirk/Eric's overbearing Irish mother. *Ricky Fortune (Kevin Lloyd) ‚Äî An ex-rock star who scored a 1969 one-hit-wonder entitled Not On My Birthday in Iceland with his group Ricky Fortune & the Fortunates. He assumes that people know who he is, but they rarely do until prompted, whereupon they mostly recall that he was once on The Sooty Show. Upon his arrival to the 1-2-1 Club, he is mocked by Kirk for his anonymity but is instantly recognised by Mrs Arnott who, it transpires, is a lifelong fan; much to Kirk's annoyance. In an attempt to protect Ricky from Kirk's insults, John claims to have bought every record that The Fortunates made, yet when challenged (by Kirk) to name his favourite Fortunates track, cannot name one and merely states \\"They all were\\". Later, Ricky is booked to headline at a charity concert with Freddie and the Dreamers as the warm-up act. At this time, it appears that Louise has booked Freddie in Ricky's place and he has been cast aside. Embarrassed and angry, he leaves, and it is only after this point that the audience finds out that it was merely a misunderstanding and Ricky was to be the main act after all. Ricky is never seen again. Episodes =Series 1 (1986)= =Series 2 (1987)= Title music  As with his other series, the title music was composed by the series' writer, John Sullivan. It was arranged by Ronnie Hazlehurst, the composer of music used in many BBC comedies and light entertainment programmes, Joan Baxter provided the vocals. Home releases Dear John appeared on video in 1998, three cassettes with both series and the Christmas special, under Playback Entertainment. Acorn Media UK released both series of Dear John on DVD in the UK in 2010. The first episode is shorter than the one originally broadcast on BBC1 as contractual edits have been made, namely the removal of Beatles music during and at the end of the episode. The subtitles still show \\"Day Tripper\\" being played as John enters the community hall and acknowledges some men dressed in Fab Four suits, but the music playing is actually muzak. And at the end John and Kate have an exchange where they discuss whether they will return the following week. Beatles music can be heard and silhouettes seen in an upper window of the centre. This scene has been totally removed.

In 1851, he initiated the legislation that eventually led to the construction of Central Park. Early life Kingsland was born on May 24, 1804, in New York City. He was the son of Cornelius Kingsland (1768‚Äì1815) and Abigail (n√©e Cock) Kingsland (1771‚Äì1854). His siblings included Daniel Cock Kingsland (b. 1798), Rebecca Kingsland Sutton (b. 1800), Jane Kingsland Rogers (b. 1802), Clara Ada Kingsland High (b. 1806). He was a member of the old New Jersey Kingsland family who had for nearly 200 years lived in and around Belleville, New Jersey. His maternal grandparents were Isaac Cock (1741‚Äì1811) and Charity (n√©e Haight) Cock. His paternal grandparents were Stephen Kingsland and Jane (n√©e Corson) Kingsland. He was the uncle of William M. Kingsland, who owned 1026 Fifth Avenue. Career Kingsland began his career as a general merchant and commission business in 1820, which became A. C. Kingsland and Sons, located at No. 55 Broadway in lower Manhattan. His firm was involved in the sale of sperm oil. In 1848, he was nominated for Mayor of New York and, two years later, was elected Mayor by almost 4,000 votes over Fernando Wood, the Democratic candidate. He served as the 71st mayor of New York City from 1851 to 1853, the first mayor to be elected to a two-year term. In 1851, he initiated the legislation that eventually led to the construction of Central Park. In 1886, Kingsland commissioned an iron-fronted building at 74 Grand Street in Soho, designed by George DaCunha. The building was demolished in 2010, and a new building was constructed in its place in 2020 which incorporated the original facade. Personal life Kingsland was married to Mary Lovett (1814‚Äì1868), whose father, George Lovett, was born in England. Together, they were the parents of eight children: * George Lovett Kingsland (1834‚Äì1892), who married Helen Schermerhorn Welles (1842‚Äì1911), a daughter of Benjamin Welles and aunt to Sumner Welles, the Ambassador to Cuba and United States Under Secretary of State. * Ambrose Cornelius Kingsland (1835‚Äì1890), who married Katharine Aspinwall (1847‚Äì1924), the daughter of prominent merchant William Henry Aspinwall. * Henry Pierre Kingsland (b. 1838), who married Harriet Emily Brierton, daughter of William Arthur Brierton * Mary Helena Kingsland (1841‚Äì1934), who married William Wright Tompkins, son of Daniel Hyatt Tompkins and grandson of Daniel D.

Kingsland died at his home, 114 Fifth Avenue, at 11 o'clock on a Sunday evening, October 13, 1878. In his obituary, The New York Times announced that his death \\"removes one of the last of that band of old New-York merchants who were in business 50 years ago, and whose names have become interwoven with the history of New-York.\\" =Residences= Kingsland's home was at 114 Fifth Avenue (southwest corner at 17th Street), now the site of a Banana Republic store. In 1866, Kingsland purchased Hunter Island, now part of Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx, for $127,501. He later purchased a sizeable country home north of the city along the Hudson River in North Tarrytown, present day Sleepy Hollow, New York. His sale of this land to the early steam-engine automotive company, Stanley Steamer, helped open North Tarrytown's 20th century era as a major automotive factory town. =Descendants= Through his son George, he was the grandfather of Helen Schermerhorn Kingsland (1876‚Äì1956), who married Augustus Newbold Morris (1868‚Äì1928) (the son of A. N. Morris), George L. Kingsland (1885‚Äì1952) and Ethel Kingsland Anderson (1886‚Äì1967). Through his son Ambrose, he was the grandfather of Walter F.

After the central road in the area, Queen's Gate, it is the second thoroughfare in what was once Albertopolis. It provides access to many nationally significant institutions, including: * Victoria and Albert Museum * Science Museum * Natural History Museum (which incorporates the former Geological Museum) * Royal Geographical Society, at the north end in Kensington Gore * Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum, at the north end in Princes Gate * Imperial College London (directly and via Imperial College Road) * Pepperdine University Abroad * Jagiellonian University London Study Centre in the Polish Hearth ClubJagiellonian University London Study Centre * London Goethe Institute * The Hyde Park Chapel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints  Shared space  A design competition for plans of how to improve the street's design to reflect its cultural importance was held in 2003 by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. The competition was won by the architectural firm Dixon and Jones for a shared space scheme for the road and surrounding streets which would give pedestrians greater priority whilst still allow some vehicular traffic at a reduced speed. The project also aimed to improve the artistic and architectural merit of the streetscape, and clearly draws inspiration from the work of Gordon Cullen's Townscape. The scheme was completed ahead of the 2012 London Olympics.

He gained modest renown for two award- winning novels and two biographies of Jewish business tycoons, published during the middle part of the 20th century. Life and career Robert Henriques was born in 1905 to one of the oldest Sephardic Portuguese families that migrated to Britain in the 17th Century. He was educated at Lockers Park School, Rugby, and New College, Oxford. He joined the Royal Artillery in 1926, and served as a gunnery officer in Egypt and the Sudan. A riding accident put him in the hospital and caused him to take retirement in 1933. His book No Arms, No Armour (1939) came out to considerable critical praise. Much of the novel was autobiographical. When World War II broke out, Henriques was an officer in the Territorial Army. He was immediately called up, and he served with distinction through the war, first in the Royal Artillery, then with the newly formed Commandos, and finally at the headquarters of Combined Operations. During the course of the war, Henriques rose to the rank of Colonel. Was also awarded American Bronze and Silver Stars for bravery in North Africa and Sicily when attached to US Forces under Patton (see 'Robert Henriques - My Biography' Secker and Warburg 1969) and British MBE. After the war, Henriques began a new life as a farmer in the Cotswolds. Starting from rather modest beginnings, his farm near Cirencester became a large and impressive operation. Henriques had outstanding success as a cattle-breeder and won competitions. He lived the life of a country squire, carrying on hunting, fishing and shooting, and even writing occasional letters to the Times on farming issues. Writing remained his first love, however, and in 1950 he became a recipient of the annual James Tait Black Award for his novel Through the Valley. He was also a frequent broadcaster and appeared on Any Questions and on various television shows. He also helped to run the Cheltenham Literary Festival with John Moore, although things always did not go his own way. Although he had accomplished much in all his various fields of endeavour ‚Äì soldiering, farming, writing and broadcasting ‚Äì Henriques was described as a restless character, who remained dissatisfied with himself and who was difficult to please. The following year, he wrote 100 Hours to Suez, and it was around this time, in his late forties, that Henriques began to take an active interest and pride in his Jewish identity. He was won over by the Zionist cause, and made frequent trips to Israel where he bought a small property. In the 1960s, Henriques wrote two biographies. The first one charted the life and career of his wife's grandfather Marcus Samuel, the great oil pioneer and leader of the Jewish community, and the second one described the life of Sir Robert Waley Cohen. He married Vivien Doris Levy, granddaughter of the 1st Viscount Bearsted in 1928, and the couple had two sons and two daughters.Debrett's 1951 gives the names of his two sons and two daughters as: > Hon. Nellie Samuel, born 1883; married 1st, 1903, Maj. Walter Henry Levy > (died 1923) [she remarried a __ Ionides and died 1962), and had (inter alia) > Vivien Levy; married 1928, Col.

Mathematically, zero-lift drag coefficient is defined as C_{D,0} = C_D - C_{D,i}, where C_D is the total drag coefficient for a given power, speed, and altitude, and C_{D,i} is the lift-induced drag coefficient at the same conditions. Thus, zero-lift drag coefficient is reflective of parasitic drag which makes it very useful in understanding how \\"clean\\" or streamlined an aircraft's aerodynamics are. For example, a Sopwith Camel biplane of World War I which had many wires and bracing struts as well as fixed landing gear, had a zero-lift drag coefficient of approximately 0.0378. Compare a C_{D,0} value of 0.0161 for the streamlined P-51 Mustang of World War II which compares very favorably even with the best modern aircraft. The drag at zero-lift can be more easily conceptualized as the drag area (f) which is simply the product of zero-lift drag coefficient and aircraft's wing area (C_{D,0} \\\\times S where S is the wing area). Parasitic drag experienced by an aircraft with a given drag area is approximately equal to the drag of a flat square disk with the same area which is held perpendicular to the direction of flight. The Sopwith Camel has a drag area of , compared to for the P-51 Mustang. Both aircraft have a similar wing area, again reflecting the Mustang's superior aerodynamics in spite of much larger size. In another comparison with the Camel, a very large but streamlined aircraft such as the Lockheed Constellation has a considerably smaller zero-lift drag coefficient (0.0211 vs. 0.0378) in spite of having a much larger drag area (34.82 ft2 vs. 8.73 ft2). Furthermore, an aircraft's maximum speed is proportional to the cube root of the ratio of power to drag area, that is: :V_{max}\\\\ \\\\propto\\\\ \\\\sqrt[3]{power/f}. Estimating zero-lift drag As noted earlier, C_{D,0} = C_D - C_{D,i}. The total drag coefficient can be estimated as: :C_D = \\\\frac{550 \\\\eta P}{\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\rho_0 [\\\\sigma S (1.47V)^3]}, where \\\\eta is the propulsive efficiency, P is engine power in horsepower, \\\\rho_0 sea-level air density in slugs/cubic foot, \\\\sigma is the atmospheric density ratio for an altitude other than sea level, S is the aircraft's wing area in square feet, and V is the aircraft's speed in miles per hour. Substituting 0.002378 for \\\\rho_0, the equation is simplified to: :C_D = 1.456 \\\\times 10^5 (\\\\frac{\\\\eta P}{\\\\sigma S V^3}). The induced drag coefficient can be estimated as: :C_{D,i} = \\\\frac{C_L^2}{\\\\pi A \\\\epsilon}, where C_L is the lift coefficient, A is the aspect ratio, and \\\\epsilon is the aircraft's efficiency factor. Substituting for C_L gives: :C_{D,i}=\\\\frac{4.822 \\\\times 10^4}{A \\\\epsilon \\\\sigma^2 V^4} (W/S)^2, where W/S is the wing loading in lb/ft2.

R. Buccheri, J. van Paradijs, & M. A. Alpar (Kluwer), 419 (1998). It is a nucleosynthesis process and, along with the s-process and the r-process, may be responsible for the generation of many of the heavy elements present in the universe. However, it is notably different from the other processes mentioned in that it occurs on the proton-rich side of stability as opposed to on the neutron-rich side of stability. The end point of the rp-process (the highest- mass element it can create) is not yet well established, but recent research has indicated that in neutron stars it cannot progress beyond tellurium. The rp-process is inhibited by alpha decay, which puts an upper limit on the end point at 104Te, the lightest observed alpha-decaying nuclide, and the proton drip line in light antimony isotopes. At this point, further proton captures result in prompt proton emission or alpha emission, and thus the proton flux is consumed without yielding heavier elements; this end process is known as the tin‚Äìantimony‚Äìtellurium cycle. Conditions The process has to occur in very high-temperature environments (above 109 kelvins) so that the protons can overcome the large Coulomb barrier for charged-particle reactions. A hydrogen- rich environment is also a prerequisite due to the large proton flux needed. The seed nuclei needed for this process to occur are thought to be formed during breakout reactions from the hot CNO cycle. Typically proton capture in the rp-process will compete with (Œ±,p) reactions, as most environments with a high flux of hydrogen are also rich in helium. The time scale for the rp- process is set by Œ≤+ decays at or near the proton drip line, because the weak interaction is notoriously slower than the strong interaction and electromagnetic force at these high temperatures. Possible sites Sites suggested for the rp-process are accreting binary systems where one star is a neutron star. In these systems the donor star is accreting material onto its compact partner star. The accreted material is usually rich in hydrogen and helium because of its origin from the surface layers of the donor star. Because such compact stars have high gravitational fields, the material falls with a high velocity towards the compact star, usually colliding with other accreted material en route, forming an accretion disk. In the case of accretion onto a neutron star, as this material slowly builds up on the surface, it will have a high temperature, typically around 108 K. Eventually, it is believed that thermonuclear instabilities arise in this hot atmosphere, allowing the temperature to continue to rise until it leads to a runaway thermonuclear explosion of the hydrogen and helium. During the flash, the temperature quickly rises, becoming high enough for the rp-process to occur. While the initial flash of hydrogen and helium lasts only a second, the rp- process typically takes up to 100 seconds. Therefore, the rp-process is observed as the tail of the resulting X-ray burst.

It is an extension of Object Oriented Software Design (OOSD) methodology, like UML, but adds its own set of rules, guidelines, procedures, and heuristics to achieve a more advanced Object Oriented software. The motivation is to achieve a higher level of OO features like - * Stability - it means much of the objects will be stable over time and will not need changes. * Reusability - it means majority of the objects can be reused for various kind of applications. * Maintainability - this is an OO feature which applies more for SM because the objects will need least amount of maintenance. Examples The Stability Model has been seen and used in an array of different use-cases. One of such is in the Bravery model, where AnyEvents such as 9/11 terrorist attacks may cause AnyImpact such as economic impacts, psychological impacts, and physical/health impacts. Principles The design tries to make use of common sense while guiding through the process of SM based design. It will need minimum amount of rampup time for people to understand new applications and objects once the process and methodology is kept in mind. The Stability Model is built using three main concepts - * Enduring Business Themes (EBT) * Business Objects (BO) * Industrial Objects (IO) History The SM method of OOSD was formulated by Dr Mohamed Fayad.

Green Wing is a surreal sitcom set in the fictional East Hampton Hospital, starring Tamsin Greig, Stephen Mangan and Julian Rhind-Tutt. Each episode was written by a team of eight writers, namely Victoria Pile (also the producer), Robert Harley, Gary Howe, Stuart Kenworthy, Oriane Messina, Richard Preddy, Fay Rusling and James Henry. Tristram Shapeero and Dominic Brigstocke directed all the episodes together. The second series consists of eight episodes broadcast between 31 March and 19 May 2006 on Channel 4. A DVD of the series was released on 2 October 2006. The second series continues the plot from the first, which ended with Dr. Caroline Todd (Greig) and Dr. \\"Mac\\" Macartney (Rhind-Tutt) falling in love, and he, Dr. Guy Secretan (Mangan) and Dr. Martin Dear (Karl Theobald) teetering over the edge of a cliff in a stolen ambulance after Guy has a nervous breakdown. The second series starts with Mac in a coma and Guy having to perform community service as punishment for stealing the ambulance. When Mac awakes from his coma, it is discovered that he has amnesia, meaning that he has no memory of his relationship with Caroline. As Caroline tries to make him remember, Mac's former girlfriend Holly Hawkes (Sally Phillips) returns to the hospital, claiming that he is the father of her son. Elsewhere in the hospital, Dr. Alan Statham (Mark Heap) and Joanna Clore (Pippa Haywood) become paranoid after they accidentally murder Joanna's dwarf cousin. Cast Most of the regular cast appear in all episodes. The only exception is the character of Dr. Angela Hunter (played by Sarah Alexander), who appears in the first three episodes and then leaves the hospital. Among the recurring guest characters are Dr. Holly Hawkes, Lyndon Jones (played by Paterson Joseph), Oliver (Ken Charles), The Neurosurgeon (Pip Torrens), Jake Leaf (Darren Boyd) and Charles Robertson (Harley). However, the character of Charles is credited as \\"CEO\\" in the episodes in which he appears. Guest actors who appear in this series include Nick Frost, Peter McDonald, Big Mick and Rosie Cavaliero. Apart from Harley, other Green Wing writers make cameo performances in the show, including Fay Rusling and Oriane Messina. Reception Critics considered the second series worse than series one. In particular, the first episode of the series was seen as poor. Cathy Pryor in The Independent on Sunday wrote of the episode: > \\"Sadly, though, since I'm something of a fan, I have to report that the > first episode of the second series is, disappointingly, rather flat.

Gill was also highly critical of the episode in The Sunday Times: > \\"Within two minutes, Green Wing had destroyed itself, lost its assured grip > on the cliff of comedy and tumbled into the abyss of embarrassing > overacting, formless gurning and pointless repetition.

But there's still enough delirious madness going on to ensure that diehard fans won't be giving up hope just yet.\\" The Observer was more positive, saying that Green Wing was one of the top ten television programmes of 2006. Broadcast magazine voted Green Wing the joint-second best comedy series in 2006, alongside the sketch show That Mitchell and Webb Look, which also stars some Green Wing actors such as Olivia Colman (Harriet Schulenburg) and Paterson Joseph. They described the series as \\"fresh, subversive, and surreal.\\" Although the second series was heavily advertised, the first episode of the series was watched by 1.8 million people (8% of the audience). The first episode of the first series, \\"Caroline's First Day\\", attracted 2.2 million (11%) in comparison. The second episode attracted the same ratings as the previous episode, while the last episode was watched by 2 million viewers (11% of the audience).

He is remembered today as the founder of the English colony of Bermuda, also known as the Somers Isles.  Career  Born in Lyme Regis, Dorset, in 1554, George was the son of John Somers and his wife. From a young age, he became a skilled and well-known seaman and owned at least one ship, the Julian, whose home port was Lyme Regis.

Both agreed to take part in Walter Raleigh's proposed expedition to Trinidad and Guiana in 1595, in the hope of finding El Dorado as well as to commit to amphibious descents throughout the Spanish Main with them. However, after failing to meet, the expedition went on their own venture along the coast of the Spanish Province of Venezuela and captured the fort at La Guaira before they headed South inland. After making an arduous trek through the mountains of pico Naiguata the English led by Preston and Somers were able to outmanoeuvre the waiting Spanish force and captured the colonial city of Santiago de Leon de Caracas. p 305John Lombardi, Venezuela, Oxford, England, 1982, p 72 After the failure of a ransom they plundered and torched the city and then went to capture Santa Ana de Coro before they made a brief excursion to the Spanish West Indies. Despite the challenges they faced the expedition was a success for the English who were able to return unmolested with some profit having set out as only a supporting expedition. Between 1600 and 1602, Somers commanded several English ships, including , and . He was knighted in 1603, and became Member of Parliament for Lyme Regis in March 1604\\\\. =Virginia Company= In 1609, Somers was appointed as admiral of the Virginia Company's Third Supply relief fleet, organized to provide relief to the Jamestown colony settled in North America two years before. On 2 June 1609, he set sail from Plymouth on the , the flagship of the seven-ship fleet, (towing two additional pinnaces) destined for Jamestown, Virginia. The fleet carried a total of 500‚Äì600 colonists bound for Jamestown. On 25 July, the fleet ran into a strong storm, probably a hurricane, and the ships were separated. The Sea Venture fought the storm for three days. Comparably-sized ships had survived such weather, but the Sea Venture had a critical flaw; she had recently been constructed and her timbers had not set. The caulking was forced from between them, and the ship began to leak rapidly. All hands were applied to bailing, but the water continued to rise in the hold. The ship's guns were reportedly jettisoned‚Äîthough two were salvaged from the wreck in 1612, to arm Bermuda's first fort‚Äîto raise her buoyancy, but this only delayed the inevitable. Sir George Somers was at the helm through the storm. When he spied land on the morning of 28 July, the water in the hold had risen to nine feet, and crew and passengers had been driven past the point of exhaustion. Somers deliberately drove the ship onto the reefs of what proved to be Bermuda in order to prevent its foundering. This allowed all 150 people and the dog aboard to reach shore safely, at what they later named Discovery Bay. Not seeing them again, those who continued on to Virginia presumed that Somers and the others had died in the storm, which had battered the relief fleet and damaged its supplies. Somers and his company remained in Bermuda for 10 months, living on food they could gather on the island and fish from the sea. Some commentators believe that this incident inspired William Shakespeare‚Äôs play The Tempest.Hobson Woodward. A Brave Vessel: The True Tale of the Castaways Who Rescued Jamestown and Inspired Shakespeare's The Tempest. Viking (2009) During their time on the islands, the crew and passengers built a church and houses, the start of the Bermuda colony. Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber (Bermuda Cedar) and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610, the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island. When they reached the settlement, they found it nearly destroyed by the famine and disease of what has been called the \\"Starving Time\\". Few of the supplies from the Supply Relief Fleet had arrived (the same hurricane which caught the Sea Venture had damaged some of the rest of the fleet), and only 60 settlers survived. Only the food and help offered by those on the two small ships from Bermuda, followed by a relief fleet in July 1610, commanded by Lord Delaware, enabled the colony to survive and avoided the abandonment of Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda in the Patience to collect more food, but he became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on 9 November 1610, at age 56\\\\. Local legend says that he loved Bermuda so much that he requested that his heart be buried there. A marker in Somers' Gardens in St. George's marks the approximate location where his heart was supposed to have been buried. The remainder of his body was taken back to England and buried in his home hamlet of Whitchurch Canonicorum near to the town of Lyme Regis.

Takhat was an ancient Egyptian princess and queen of the 19th Dynasty, the mother of Twosret and the usurper pharaoh Amenmesse., pp.179,183 There are not many facts known about her other than that she was Amenmesse's mother. She bore the titles King's Daughter and King's Wife. She might have been identical with Takhat, a daughter of Ramesses II, who is mentioned on a Louvre ostracon. Thus she was the aunt of Seti II, but since she was among the youngest children of Ramesses, it is very likely that she was the same age or even younger than Seti II who was the grandson of Ramesses.Dodson‚ÄìHilton, pp.175,180 It is also possible that she was a grandchild of Ramesses; there are several examples of granddaughters bearing the title King's Daughter, although it was not very common. The king she married was either Merenptah or Seti II. She is shown on several statues of Amenmesse, among them on two statues in the Karnak temple. On one of these, which still stands in Karnak, she is called King's Daughter, King's Wife (Takhat) and the word \\"wife\\" replaced the original \\"mother\\". According to Aidan Dodson and Dyan Hilton, the title was recarved when Seti, the rightful heir regained the throne and usurped the statue, and that it proves either that Takhat married Seti when he became pharaoh, or that they had been married before, which means Amenmesse was Seti's son and usurped the throne from his own father. This theory might be strengthened by the other statue (now in Cairo), on which Takhat is also named as King's Daughter and King's Wife, but without any trace of recarving, while the king's name replaced another name. This statue was, according to Dodson and Hilton, possibly made by Seti; later it was usurped by Amenmesse who replaced Seti's name with his own, while leaving his mother's titles intact; still later Amenmesse's name was again replaced with that of Seti.Dodson & Hilton, pp.179-180 According to another theory Seti was never married to Takhat and had her original titles recarved only to remove all traces that her son ever ruled.Frank Yurco: Amenmesse: Six Statues at Karnak. Metropolitan Museum Journal, 14 (1979), pp.15-31. She is likely to have been buried in Amenmesse's tomb KV10 in the Valley of the Kings.

Development history  Development of the C4 Engine is led by computer graphics author Eric Lengyel, who is also the founder of Terathon Software. Although in development sporadically for several years beforehand, the engine was first made available under a commercial license in May, 2005. Due to changing market conditions, the C4 Engine was retired in 2015, but an announcement has been made that it is returning in 2020.  Capabilities and features  The architecture of the C4 Engine is that of a layered collection of software components, in which the lowest layers interact with the computer hardware and operating system, and the higher layers provide platform-independent services to the game code. While a considerable portion of the engine is dedicated to 3D graphics, there are also large components dedicated to functionality pertaining to audio, networking, physics, input devices, and scripting. Documentation for the engine is available online through a set of API web pages and a wiki. = Graphics = The C4 Engine is based on the OpenGL library on Windows, Mac, Linux, and iOS platforms, and it uses a one-pass-per-light forward rendering model. The engine is capable of rendering with several different types of light sources and shadowing methods. The primary method for rendering dynamic shadows is shadow mapping, and a variant of cascaded shadow mapping is used for very large outdoor scenes. Shaders are created in C4 using one of two available methods, both of which isolate the user from the shader code required by the underlying graphics library. Simple shaders can be created by specifying a set of material attributes such as a diffuse reflection color, a specular reflection color, and a group of texture maps. The engine internally generates the necessary shader code for each combination of material and light type that it encounters when rendering a scene. Material attributes can be used to produce effects such as normal mapping, parallax mapping, horizon mapping, and bumpy reflections or refractions. C4 also includes a graphical Shader Editor that allows complex custom materials to be created using a large set of predefined operations. This method of designing materials enables greater creative freedom and functionality for expert users, but requires somewhat more work by the user. Materials created using the standard material attributes can be converted to custom shaders to serve as a starting point in the Shader Editor. The terrain capabilities of the C4 Engine are based on a voxel technology, allowing full 3D sculpting to produce features such as overhangs, arches, and truly vertical cliffs that would not be possible under a conventional height-based terrain system. Triangle meshes are generated from voxel data using the Marching cubes algorithm, and seamless multiresolution level of detail is made possible by using the Transvoxel algorithm to stitch together regions of differing resolutions. The engine is capable of rendering a large variety of special effects, including particle systems, procedural fire, electrical effects, volumetric fog, and weather phenomena. During a post-processing stage, the engine can also apply full-scene cinematic motion blur to the final image using a technique based on a velocity buffer, as well as glow and distortion effects. The engine does not provide the capability to design custom post-processing effects. = Audio = The C4 Engine can play sounds stored in the WAV format using 16-bit mono or stereo sampling, and audio data can be played from memory or streamed from disk. The engine plays sounds using a custom mixer that provides capabilities such as frequency shifting, Doppler effect, reverberation, and atmospheric absorption. = Networking = Multiplayer gameplay in C4 is supported by a two-layer messaging system that uses the UDP protocol to communicate among different computers connected to a game. = Physics = The C4 Engine has a native physics engine which can be used or allows the option for implementing a 3rd party solution instead.  Tools  The C4 Engine ships with basic game development tools required to make a modern game. Each tool is packaged as a plugin module that exists separately from the engine itself. Many tools make use of the comprehensive graphical user interface system provided by the engine so that a consistent interface is presented to the user across multiple platforms. = World Editor = The World Editor tool is a 3D content creation application that is typically used to create game environments for use with the C4 Engine. It provides a large set of drawing and manipulation capabilities that are used to construct world geometry as well as many game necessities such as lights, sounds, triggers, and special effects. The World Editor can import scene information through the OpenGEX and COLLADA formats. This enables the use of content from a large number of digital content creation programs such as Autodesk Maya or 3D Studio Max. = Script editor = The World Editor tool includes a graphical script editor designed to be accessible to artists and level designers as well as programmers. The script editor allows the user to place various \\"methods\\" into a directed graph connected by \\"fibers\\" representing action dependencies and the order of execution. Scripts support loops through the creation of cycles in the graph structure, and conditional execution is supported by marking fibers to be followed or not followed based on the result value output by the methods at which they start. The engine ships with several standard script methods that perform simple actions such as enabling or disabling a scene node (for example, to turn a light on or off) and more complex actions such as evaluating an arbitrary mathematical expression. New script methods can be defined by the game code, and they appear in the script editor as custom actions that can be used by a level designer. = Panel editor = The World Editor tool includes a sub-editor called the \\"panel editor\\" providing for the creation of 2D interface panels that can be placed inside a 3D world. The panel editor lets the user place various types of widgets such as text and images in a panel effect node that is rendered as part of the scene. Panels can also include a special camera widget that displays the scene that is visible to a camera placed anywhere else in the same world. Interface panels are both dynamic and interactive. The engine provides an extensible set of \\"mutators\\" that can be applied to individual panel items to induce various forms of animation such as scrolling, rotation, or color change. A character in a game can interact with a panel by approaching it and clicking the mouse inside interactive items. Script can be attached to such items, causing a sequence of actions to occur when the player activates them.

It is a shooter viewed from a 3/4 perspective, with live action full motion videos used to advance the storyline. Players take on the role of Miranda Bowen, a young woman mutated into a human/alien hybrid, who is humanity's last hope of repelling an alien invasion. Story In the year 2069 North America is shaken by war. Canada and Mexico are combating the United States. Not long after the start of the war, alien pods rain down from space onto North America, sprouting metallic tentacles upon landing. The tentacles attack humans and animals, transforming them instantly into monstrous alien biomechanisms (half-organic compound, half-machine) bent on destroying any human life they encounter. Dr. Bowen, a scientist, studies one of these pods in an attempt to learn about the alien species. The pod breaks out of control and attacks his daughter, Miranda Bowen (played by actress Wendi Kenya). Dr. Bowen severs the attacking tentacle, but Miranda is already infected. Thus she transforms into Steel Harbinger: a half-human, half- biomechanical alien, and humanity's last hope for survival. Miranda must battle her way through Kansas, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Houston, Cape Canaveral, Washington, the Antarctic, an alien planetoid, and the Moon in an effort to save the Earth. Gameplay Steel Harbinger is an overhead shooter. The game features modern and futuristic weaponry, including handguns, the US M16 rifle, rocket launchers, energy rifles, the Canadian Icarus beam, and more. As a half-alien, Miranda's biology is different from that of a normal human. Miranda can be fatally wounded by saline water as falling into it will rapidly deplete health. To replenish lost health, Miranda is able to consume body parts from slain aliens. The primary objective is to activate a military satellite that will protect the Earth from falling alien tentacle pods. Other objectives involve killing aliens and saving human survivors.

The specific epithet rhombicaulis is formed from the Latin words rhombicus, meaning \\"rhomboid\\", and caulis, \\"stem\\". It refers to the cross-sectional shape of the stem internodes. Botanical history Upper pitchers were first reported in 1993 Nepenthes rhombicaulis was first collected by Shigeo Kurata on March 29, 1972, on Mount Pangulubao at an altitude of between 1700 and 1900 m above sea level. The species was mentioned by name in a 1972 issueKurata, S. 1972. Biology of Nepenthes. The Heredity 26(10): 43‚Äì51. (volume 26, number 10, page 44) of The Heredity.Cheek, M.R. & M.H.P. Jebb 2001. Nepenthaceae. Flora Malesiana 15: 1‚Äì157. It was formally described by Kurata the following year in The Gardens' Bulletin Singapore. One of the original specimens, Kurata 4300, was designated as the holotype of the species and is deposited at the herbarium of the Nippon Dental College (NDC). An isotype is held at the National Herbarium of Singapore (SING).Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Kurata's illustration of the type specimen shows a small apical appendage on the underside of the pitcher lid. However, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek pointed out that this feature is not present in the isotype held in Singapore.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. Kurata suggested that the appendage might be a developmental defect and of little significance. Observations made at the type locality by Charles Clarke and Ch'ien Lee seem to confirm this; while some wild plants exhibit this appendage, most do not. In the 1983 book Carnivorous Plants of the World in Colour by Katsuhiko and Masahiro Kondo, a photograph of N. gymnamphora is identified as N. rhombicaulis.Schlauer, J. N.d.. Nepenthes rhombicaulis. Carnivorous Plant Database. In 1993, Bruce Salmon postulated that the lower pitchers of N. rhombicaulis are specially adapted to trapping subterranean insects. His observations were published in the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter.Salmon, B.[R.] 1993. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 22(1‚Äì2): 11‚Äì12. Rudolf Schmid-H√∂llinger reported observing upper pitchers of N. rhombicaulis on Mount Pangulubao in 1993. He published his findings the following year in the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter.Schmid- H√∂llinger, R. 1994. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 23(3): 62‚Äì63. Charles Clarke also reported finding one small upper pitcher in 1995.Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. Another Nice Trip to Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(1): 4‚Äì10. Prior to this, it was thought that the upper stem of N. rhombicaulis was only used for climbing and did not produce pitchers. However, doubts have been raised about the identity of the upper pitchers observed by Schmid-H√∂llinger. Description Nepenthes rhombicaulis climbs well and its stem is known to reach 35 m in length, making it one of the longest in the genus. Internodes are up to 20 cm long and 1 cm in diameter. They are usually rhomboid in cross section. The stem bears numerous sunken glands. The species has an extended rhizome which produces stems at irregular intervals. A rosette plant Leaves are sessile. The lamina is lanceolate-spathulate, up to 25 cm long, and up to 4 cm wide. It has an acute to sub-peltate apex and an amplexicaul base. Two to three longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are oblique. Tendrils may be up to 15 cm long. Rosette and lower pitchers are ovoid to ventricose in the lower parts and cylindrical above. They reach 12 cm in height and 4 cm in width. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§3 mm long) runs down the front of the pitchers. The glandular region is restricted to the ovoid portion of the inner surface. Digestive glands occur at a density of 150 to 300 per square centimetre. The pitcher mouth is round and oblique. The peristome is sub-cylindrical to irregularly expanded and up to 5 mm wide. Its inner margin is lined with distinct, papery teeth up to 3 mm long. The lid or operculum is ovate and may bear a small apical appendage on its lower surface. Up to 100 nectar glands are present on the underside of the lid. A spur (‚â§5 mm long), which may be unbranched, bifid, or trifid, is inserted near the base of the lid. A typical lower pitcher Upper pitchers have not been reliably recorded in the field and measurements for them have not been published. Based on Schmid-H√∂llinger's observations, they are ventricose in the lower parts and elongated above, becoming tubiform or slightly infundibuliform towards the mouth. The peristome is greatly reduced and bears smaller teeth. Wings may or may not be reduced to ribs. Several hundred nectar glands are present on the underside of the lid, although they are smaller than in lower pitchers. Nepenthes rhombicaulis has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle and rachis both reach 20 cm in length, although the latter is usually shorter in female plants. Partial peduncles are two-flowered and lack bracteoles. Sepals are elliptical and up to 4 mm long. Most parts of the plant are virtually glabrous. The margins of the lamina are often lined with short red hairs. Inflorescences may have a sparse indumentum of minute hairs. The stem and lamina are green. Lower pitcher range in colour from dull green throughout to light red with purple blotches. The peristome may be light green to dark purple and is often darker around its outer margin. According to Schmid-H√∂llinger, upper pitchers are yellowish-green with pale red spots in the upper part and pitchers produced on offshoots from the climbing stem have clear red speckles throughout. Ecology A small rosette plant growing among leaf litter Nepenthes rhombicaulis is known from a number of peaks in the Indonesian province of North Sumatra, particularly around Lake Toba. Plants that appear to match the description of N. rhombicaulis have also been recorded from Mount Bandahara in Aceh. The species is known with certainty only from the Mount Pangulubao complex and Mount Lubukraya, although Shigeo Kurata suggested that it is likely to be more widespread in the Lake Toba region. Nepenthes rhombicaulis has an altitudinal distribution of 1600‚Äì2000 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Nepenthes rhombicaulis grows terrestrially in dense, shady montane forest. It is usually found in lower montane forest above steep slopes, but has also been recorded from upper montane forest. It is one of the few Nepenthes species that are common in the understory. Lower pitchers frequently develop embedded in detritus and leaf litter on the forest floor, resulting in their often deformed appearance. Bruce Salmon noted that lower pitchers which develop in this way grow around twice as large as those which develop completely above ground. He postulated that the species is adapted to trapping subterranean insects, although he did not examine the contents of these pitchers to test the hypothesis.Hopkins, M., R. Maulder & B.[R.] Salmon 1990. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 19(1‚Äì2): 19‚Äì28. In its natural habitat, N. rhombicaulis occurs sympatrically with N. flava,Wistuba, A., J. Nerz & A. Fleischmann 2007. flava, a new species of Nepenthaceae from the northern part of Sumatra. Blumea 52(1): 159‚Äì163. N. ovata, N. spectabilis, and N. tobaica. Natural hybrids with all of these species have been recorded. On Mount Pangulubao, N. gymnamphora (N. xiphioides) and N. mikei grow around 100 m above populations of N. rhombicaulis.Salmon, B.R. & R.G. Maulder 1995. Two New Species of Nepenthes from North Sumatra, Indonesia. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 24(3): 77‚Äì85. Due to its somewhat restricted distribution, N. rhombicaulis is listed as Vulnerable on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Related species An intermediate pitcher of N. gymnamphora A lower pitcher of N. rhombicaulis √ó N. spectabilis Nepenthes rhombicaulis is very similar to N. gymnamphora in both morphology and growth habit. It is sympatric with this species on Mount Pangulubao. Nepenthes rhombicaulis also bears a close resemblance to N. hirsuta from Borneo. In 2001, Charles Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The resultant cladogram placed N. rhombicaulis in an unresolved polytomy at the base of the Montanae/Nobiles clade, together with N. benstonei. Natural hybrids At least four natural hybrids involving N. rhombicaulis have been recorded and at least three of the parent species (excluding N. rhombicaulis) occur on Mount Pangulubao. *N. flava √ó N. rhombicaulis *?

Young age Deschamps was born with congenital deformities of all four limbs; he is missing both his left arm and right leg, and has only two fingers on his right hand. At the age of nine, his family moved to Rawdon, Quebec. During his youth, his handicap was not mocked in school. He entertained his student friends in class and maintained good enough grades to be the first of his class. He started playing the drums when he reached 11 years of age, and by the age of 15, he was playing bass guitar and started singing. From 1989 to 1995 he was a graphic designer for Bell company. The first band he played in was called Any Way, as their drummer. Knowing he wanted to become a band leader, he formed his own group called Deep Freeze.  Career  Opening ceremony for the 2010 Paralympics. Opening ceremony, 2010 Paralympics. His musical career began in 1996 when, with that group, he was named best vocalist in the L'Empire des futures stars competition. He was subsequently invited to join rock band Offenbach on a reunion tour as the replacement for the late Gerry Boulet, and immediately departed on a 50-show tour. He then released his own solo debut, Comme je suis, in 2000. Selling 60,000 copies in Quebec, the album spawned three hit singles and was nominated for three F√©lix Awards, for best new artist, best rock album and best single (\\"Quand\\"). For his second album, 2001's Diff√©rent, he donated a portion of the profits to Montreal's Centre hospitalier universitaire Sainte-Justine, and subsequently became a spokesperson for the province's Semaine des personnes handicap√©es. He subsequently recorded two songs for the soundtrack to Denise Filiatrault's film Alice's Odyssey (L'Odyss√©e d'Alice Tremblay) and a duet with Lynda Lemay, and mounted a successful concert tour in France. His third album, Le D√©sert, was released in 2003. That album's single \\"V√©rit√©\\" spent five weeks at #1 on Quebec's pop charts. Offenbach subsequently released the album Nature in 2005, and Deschamps toured with the band that year. He performed during the 2010 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony. He performed at the state funeral for Jack Layton, deceased leader of the New Democratic Party, on August 27, 2011. He released a Christmas CD in December 2012. It features his daughter. In an interview with fellow disabled person Elizabeth, he cites Metallica, AC/DC and PATOFFE as his greatest musical inspirations. Martin Deschamps performed in 2004 for the anti-smoking group Commando Oxygene at la TOHU. He sang a cover of \\"I feel good\\" by James Brown. He began the performance by discussing his history of smoking, and after declaring that he was now a non-smoker he said \\"Boy, do I feel good\\" and danced on stage. He owns a custom made Harley Davidson, which has been built so that he can ride it without arms or legs.

He is the second child and the only son of the actors Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis. Davis' roots Davis says his blues music is inspired by the Southern speech of his grandmother. Though raised in the New York City area, he grew up hearing accounts of life in the rural South from his parents and especially his grandparents, and they made their way into his own stories and songs. Davis taught himself the guitar (never having the patience to take formal lessons) and learned by listening to and watching other musicians. One night on a train from Boston to New York, he picked up finger picking from a nine-fingered guitar player. His first exposure to the blues was at a summer camp in Vermont run by Pete Seeger's brother John Seeger, where he learned how to play the five-string banjo.Interview, Americana Music Show #280, published January 5, 2016. Acting Throughout his life, Davis has had overlapping interests in music and acting. Early acting roles included a lead role in the 1984 film Beat Street opposite Rae Dawn Chong. He appeared on television as Dr. Josh Hall in One Life to Live from 1985 to 1986. Eventually, Davis had the opportunity to combine music and acting on the stage. He made his Broadway musical debut in 1991 in the Zora Neale Hurston/Langston Hughes collaboration Mulebone, which featured the music of Taj Mahal. In 1993, he performed Off- Broadway as legendary blues player Robert Johnson in Robert Johnson: Trick the Devil. He received rave reviews and became the 1993 winner of the Blues Foundation's \\"Keeping the Blues Alive Award‚Äù; it was presented to him by Robert Cray at the W.C. Handy Awards ceremony.

The Off-Broadway debut in 1994 received critical praise from The New York Times and the Village Voice. Davis' writing projects have included a variety of theatre pieces and plays. Mudsurfing, a collection of three short stories, received the 1991 Brio Award from the Bronx Council on the Arts. The Trial (later renamed, The Trial: Judgement of the People), an anti-drug abuse, one-act play that toured throughout the New York City shelter system, was produced Off-Broadway in 1990, at the McGinn Cazale Theater. Davis also arranged, performed, and co- wrote the music for an Emmy Award-winning film, To Be a Man. In the fall of 1995, his music was used in the national PBS series, The American Promise. Music For the past two decades, Davis has concentrated on writing, recording, and performing music. In the fall of 1995, he released his Red House records debut Stomp Down Rider, an album of a stunning live performance. The album made top lists all over the country, including in the Boston Globe and Pulse magazine. Davis's next album, Call Down the Thunder, paid tribute to the blues masters, but revealed more of his powerful originals. It too was named a top ten album of the year in the Boston Globe and Pulse. Acoustic Guitar said it was one of the ‚Äúthirty essential CDs from a new generation of performers‚Äù. Davis' third Red House disc, You Don't Know My Mind, which includes backing vocals by Olu Dara, explodes with passion and rhythm, and displays Davis' breadth as a composer and powerhouse performer. It was chosen as ‚ÄòBlues Album of the Year‚Äô by the Association For Independent Music (formerly NAIRD). The San Francisco Chronicle gave the CD four stars, adding, \\"Davis' tough, timeless vocals blow through your brain like a Mississippi dust devil.\\" Charles M. Young summed up Davis's take on the blues when writing in Playboy magazine: \\"Davis reminds you that the blues started as dance music. This is blues made for humming along, stomping your foot, feeling righteous in the face of oppression and expressing gratitude to your baby for greasing your skillet.\\" Davis‚Äôs fourth album was Butt Naked Free, the first of his albums to have been produced by John Platania, former guitarist for Van Morrison. In addition to Platania on electric guitar, it includes musician friends such as Levon Helm (The Band), multi-instrumentalist, Tommy ‚ÄúT-Bone‚Äù Wolk (Hall & Oates; Carly Simon, ‚ÄòSaturday Night Live‚Äô Band, drummer Gary Burke (Joe Jackson), and acoustic bassist, Mark Murphy (Walt Michael & Co., Vanaver Caravan). The musicians all performed ‚ÄúWaitin‚Äô On the Cards to Fall‚Äù from this album on the Conan O'Brien show. Of the fifth album, Give In Kind, music critic Dave Marsh wrote, ‚ÄúDavis never loses sight of the blues as good time music, the original forum for dancing on top of one's sorrows. Joy made more exquisite, of course, by the sorrow from which it springs.‚Äù Ian Anderson, founder and lead singer of Jethro Tull, liked the album and invited Davis to open for them during the summer of 2003. He wrote in his invitation, ‚ÄúFolk Blues (Sonny Terry, J.B. Lenoir) is where I started. Hearing Guy is like coming home again.‚Äù Notables who call themselves Davis fans include Jackson Browne, writer Maya Angelou, and actress Jessica Lange. Lange invited Davis to perform his cover version of the Bob Dylan song, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a Sweetheart Like You (Doing in a Dump Like This)‚Äù for a fundraiser that she and her husband Sam Shepard organized for Tibetan monks in Minnesota. Chocolate to the Bone, Davis‚Äôs sixth album, followed. Accolades included a W.C. Handy Award nomination for ‚ÄúBest Acoustic Blues Album‚Äù. Davis has been nominated for nine ‚ÄòHandy Awards‚Äô over the years including for ‚ÄúBest Traditional Blues Album‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest Blues Song‚Äù (‚ÄúWaiting On the Cards to Fall‚Äù) and as ‚ÄúBest Acoustic Blues Artist‚Äù two times. His latest album, Legacy, was picked as one of the Best CDs of the Year by National Public Radio (NPR). The lead track on it, ‚ÄúUncle Tom‚Äôs Dead‚Äù was chosen as one of the Best Songs of the Year. The only other artist on both lists was Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys fame. Illustrator Guy Davis drew the cover for this album. The tongue-in-cheek cartoon strip is included in the liner notes, is a collaboration between the two men. A winery in California completes the triumvirate, as it is headed by a winemaker also named Guy Davis. He created a limited edition wine in their honor with the label artwork done by illustrator Guy Davis. Davis has contributed songs on a host of tribute and compilation albums, including collections on bluesmen Charley Patton and Robert Johnson, for Putumayo Records collections including, From Mali to Memphis and the children‚Äôs album called, Sing Along With Putumayo, for tradition-based rockers like the Grateful Dead, songwriters like Nick Lowe, and for Bob Dylan‚Äôs 60th birthday CD called, A Nod to Bob, even on a Windham Hill collection of choral music, and alongside performers like Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, and Bruce Springsteen for a collection of songs written by his friend, legendary folksinger, ‚ÄòUncle‚Äô Pete Seeger, called, Where Have All the Flowers Gone. However, easily the proudest recording project he‚Äôs been involved with is the one produced by his friend Larry Long, called I Will Be Your Friend: Songs and Activities for Young Peacemakers, in which Davis contributed the title track. It's a CD collection of enriching songs combined together with a teacher‚Äôs aid kit to help teach diversity and understanding. It is all part of the national ‚ÄúTeaching Tolerance‚Äù campaign and continues to be distributed by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and sent to every public school in the country to help combat hatred. Recent projects Davis wrote a couple of songs and recorded with Dr. John for Whoopi Goldberg‚Äôs Littleburg series, and appeared and sang in Jack's Big Music Show, both for the Nickelodeon network, Nick Jr. Davis has also done residency programs for the Lincoln Center Institute, the Kennedy Center, the State Theatre in New Jersey, and works with ‚ÄúYoung Audiences of NJ‚Äù, doing classroom workshops and assembly programs all across the country and in Canada for Elementary, High School, and College students. More recently, Davis appeared in the PBS special on the jazz and blues artist Howard Armstrong. He was a recipient of a Kennedy Center Honor, at which he received a medal alongside other recipients such as Warren Beatty, Elton John and composer John Williams from the President of the United States. Davis appeared at NYC's Lincoln Center Out of Doors Festival in a history of the blues concert, \\"Evolution of the Blues\\", along with Michael Hill (Michael Hill's Blues Mob), Paul Peress, and Paul Ossola. He also performed with Pete Seeger and Tao Rodr√≠guez-Seeger at select venues, including a benefit concert that took place at McDaniel College in Westminster, Maryland in August 2008. In 2012 Davis released an audio play called The Adventures of Fishey Waters: In Bed with the Blues. It is a compilation of \\"historical\\" tales in the form of a play accompanied by Davis in song. In November 2016, Guy joined forces with fellow American Brooks Williams for a UK tour entitled 'Inside The Delta', a showcase of the many varied styles of the blues.

He was the oldest son of the founding emperor, Emperor Wu, and became emperor after his father's death in 422. The officials that his father left in charge of the government became convinced that he was unfit to govern, and so deposed and killed him in 424, making his more-capable younger brother Liu Yilong emperor (as Emperor Wen). During Jin Dynasty Liu Yifu was born in 406, when his father Liu Yu was already a paramount general of Jin and effectively regent. His mother was Liu Yu's concubine Consort Zhang. He was Liu Yu's oldest son. As Liu Yu consolidated his power, he began to bestow on Liu Yifu increasingly more nominal authority, although Liu Yu had his subordinates actually carry out the duties that Liu Yifu would otherwise be expected to carry out. In 415, he was officially made heir apparent of Liu Yu's dukedom of Yuzhang and made the governor of Yan Province (ÂÖóÂ∑û, then modern central Jiangsu). In 416, he was made the governor of Yu Province (Ë±´Â∑û, then modern central Anhui). Later that year, he was again made the governor of Yan Province, but also the governor of Xu Province (ÂæêÂ∑û, modern northern Jiangsu). Then, in the fall, as Liu Yu launched a major campaign to attack Later Qin, Liu Yifu was made the defender of the capital Jiankang, even though it was Liu Muzhi () who had actual authority. In 417, after Liu Yu had destroyed Later Qin and annexed its territory, Liu Muzhi died. Liu Yu then withdrew, leaving the former Later Qin capital Chang'an in the hands of Liu Yifu's younger brother Liu Yizhen () the Duke of Guiyang, but again with generals and officials actually in charge. In 418, after he had reached Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠Âüé, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), he considered making Liu Yifu the governor of Jing Province (ËçäÂ∑û, roughly modern Hubei), but at the counsel of Zhang Shao () that Liu Yifu, as the heir, should not be sent away from Jiankang, that post was given to Liu Yilong instead. When Liu Yu accepted the greater title of Duke of Song that year, Liu Yifu became the heir apparent to his dukedom, and in 419, after he was created the Prince of Song, Liu Yifu was given the special honor to be known as Crown Prince of Song. It was also around this time that he married Emperor Gong of Jin's daughter Sima Maoying the Princess Haiyan. During Emperor Wu's reign After Liu Yu seized the throne from Emperor Gong and established Liu Song (as its Emperor Wu) in 420, he created Liu Yifu crown prince. By 422, Emperor Wu was ill. His official Xie Hui saw that Crown Prince Yifu was often spending time with people lacking in abilities and virtue, and warned Emperor Wu about it. Emperor Wu considered making Liu Yizhen the Prince of Luling crown prince instead. Xie, however, after meeting with Liu Yizhen, had an even worse opinion of Liu Yizhen, and so Emperor Wu stopped considering so. As Emperor Wu grew seriously ill later that year, he entrusted Crown Prince Yifu to Xu Xianzhi, Fu Liang, Xie Hui, and Tan Daoji. At the same time, however, he secretly warned Crown Prince Yifu that Xie was such a quick thinker that he could not be trusted greatly. He then died, and Crown Prince Yifu took the throne as Emperor Shao. Reign Emperor Shao honored his stepgrandmother Xiao Wenshou as grand empress dowager, and he created his wife Crown Princess Sima Maoying as empress. The matters of the central government were largely in the hands of Xu Xianzhi, Fu Liang, and Xie Hui. One immediate matter that needed to be dealt with was that Emperor Mingyuan of Northern Wei, hearing of Emperor Wu's death, launched a major attack on Liu Song and crossed the Yellow River. In winter 422, Northern Wei forces captured Huatai (ÊªëÂè∞, in modern Anyang, Henan). In spring 423, they captured Luoyang. Tan Daoji was dispatched to try to save the northern cities, and he was able to save Shandong Peninsula from falling, but by summer 423, the last major Liu Song outpost on the Yellow River, Hulao (ËôéÁâ¢, in modern Zhengzhou, Henan), had fallen, along with Xuchang. Only then did Northern Wei stop its advances. In fall 423, Emperor Shao honored his mother Consort Zhang as empress dowager. By 424, Xu, Fu, and Xie had grown increasingly dissatisfied with Emperor Shao as an emperor, as Emperor Shao had failed to follow the proper behavior during the three-year mourning period for his father, but spent most of his time on games and pleasure rather than on studies and important matters of state, despite encouragement from his official Fan Tai (). They therefore considered deposing him, but they were also dissatisfied with the next ranked son of Emperor Wu, Liu Yizhen, who was talented but was even more frivolous than Emperor Shao in his behavior, often spending time with other talented but frivolous men, including Xie Lingyun and Yan Yanzhi () and often requesting the imperial government to supply him with more and more money. They therefore stoked the rivalry that Emperor Shao already had with Liu Yizhen and then accused Liu Yizhen of crimes, and Emperor Shao reduced Liu Yizhen to commoner status and exiled him to Xin'an Commandery (Êñ∞ÂÆâ, roughly modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang). With Liu Yizhen out of the way, Xu, Fu, and Xie prepared to remove Emperor Shao as well. Because they were apprehensive about the powerful armies that Tan and Wang Hong had, they summoned Tan and Wang to the capital and then informed them of the plot. They then sent soldiers into the palace to arrest Emperor Shao, after first persuading the imperial guards not to resist. Before Emperor Shao could get up from bed in the morning, the soldiers were already in his bedchamber, and he made a futile attempt to resist, but was captured. He was sent back to his old palace. The officials then, in the name of Empress Dowager Zhang, declared Emperor Shao's faults and demoted him to Prince of Yingyang, offering the throne to his younger brother Liu Yilong Prince of Yidu instead. After removal Liu Yifu was exiled to Wu Commandery (roughly modern Suzhou, Jiangsu) and kept under secure guard. One month later, Xu Xianzhi sent the assassin Xing Antai () to assassinate the former emperor. Liu Yifu was still a strong man, and he fought his way out of the capital of Wu Commandery, but he was eventually chased down and knocked to the ground with a doorknob, and then killed. Though Liu Yifu died sonless, in 429, Liu Lang, the eldest son of his younger brother Liu Yigong, was designated as his heir.

The specific epithet ovata is Latin for \\"ovate\\" and refers to the shape of the lower pitchers. Botanical history Nepenthes ovata was first collected as early as November 1840 or 1841 by Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn on Mount Lubukraya (Loeboekraja). Junghuhn collected two specimens at an elevation of 1990 m. Their growth habit is recorded as \\"in silvis cacuminis supremi scandens, repens\\", which means \\"in woods above peak creeping, climbing\\". One of the specimens, H.L.B. 908,155-870, was originally deposited at Herbarium Lugduno- Batavum in Leiden, while the other, H.A.R.T. 000252, was deposited at Herbarium Academicum Rheno-Traiectinum, the herbarium of the University of Utrecht. They are now held at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden. Both consist of male plant material. N. bongso In his seminal monograph \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", published in 1928, B. H. Danser referred the plant material collected by Junghuhn to N. bongso.Clarke, C.M. 2006. Introduction. In: Danser, B.H. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. pp. 1‚Äì15. Danser also treated specimens of N. talangensis under this taxon. These two species were again confused with N. bongso in a 1973 article on the Nepenthes of Borneo, Singapore and Sumatra, authored by botanist Shigeo Kurata.Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. In the 1983 book Carnivorous Plants of the World in Colour by Katsuhiko and Masahiro Kondo, a photograph of N. ovata is identified as N. pectinata.Schlauer, J. N.d.. Nepenthes ovata. Carnivorous Plant Database. Many authors consider the latter to be conspecific with N. gymnamphora.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.Schlauer, J. N.d. Nepenthes gymnamphora. Carnivorous Plant Database. Either way, the species bears little resemblance to N. ovata. Nepenthes ovata was formally described in 1994 by Joachim Nerz and Andreas Wistuba. The holotype, Nerz 1601, was collected on March 16, 1989, on the west ridge of Mount Pangulubao at an altitude of 1800 m. It consists of a rosette with pitchers. Two other specimens were collected at the same time and location. Nerz 1602 includes a vine with pitchers and male flowers, while Nerz 1603 consists of a vine with male flowers. All three specimens are deposited at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden. In their monograph \\"A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae)\\", published in 1997, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek identified three specimens belonging to N. ovata as N. densiflora. One of these specimens, Frey-Wyssling 43, was collected on Mount Pangulubao at 1800 m, which is the type locality of N. ovata. It consists of an immature rosette and a lower pitcher. A second specimen, Frey-Wyssling 13, was collected in Dolok \\"Baros\\", also at 1800 m. Finally, Opperhout 27/11/1929 was taken on that date from the summit of Dolok Sempenan at 1600 m. It consists of a rosette and a lower pitcher with its lid missing. Despite this, it can be identified as belonging to N. ovata based on the structure of the peristome. All three specimens are deposited at the Bogor Botanical Gardens (formerly the Herbarium of the Buitenzorg Botanic Gardens) in Java. Two further specimens of N. ovata, Nepenthes Team (Hernawati, P. Akhriadi & I. Petra) NP 373 and 377, were collected on December 16, 2003, as part of a conservation expedition focusing on Nepenthes. They were taken from Mount Pangulubao at an altitude of between 1500 and 2100 m. Both are deposited at the herbarium of Andalas University in Padang, West Sumatra.Akhriadi, P., Hernawati & R. Tamin 2004. A new species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from Sumatra. Reinwardtia 12(2): 141‚Äì144. Description Nepenthes ovata is a climbing plant. The stem grows to 5 m in length and 6 mm in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical and up to 15 cm long. rosette plant with a lower pitcher Leaves are coriaceous in texture and sessile to broadly sub-petiolate. The lamina is lanceolate-spathulate and reaches 12 cm in length and 4 cm in width. It usually has an acute apex and is gradually attenuate towards the base. Three longitudinal veins, which originate near the base of the lamina, are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are indistinct. Tendrils may be up to 18 cm long. Their insertion at the end of the lamina is apical. Rosette and lower pitchers are either infundibular in the lower third to half and ovoid above, or ovoid throughout. They reach 25 cm in height and 9 cm in width. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§15 mm wide) runs down the front of the pitcher. The glandular region covers the lower third to half of the inner surface. The glands are overarched and occur at a density of 400 to 1300 per square centimetre. The pitcher mouth is round and elongated into a wide neck. The peristome is flattened, expanded, and up to 40 mm wide. A series of teeth (‚â§7 mm wide) line its inner margin. The peristome ribs are spaced 0.5 to 1.5 mm apart. Pitchers bear 14 to 18 longitudinal nerves across their height. The pitcher lid is ovate and usually has a hook-shaped appendage on the underside near the peristome. A branched spur (‚â§5 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. An intermediate pitcher Upper pitchers arise abruptly from the ends of the tendrils, forming a 20 to 30 mm wide curve. They are cylindrical in the lower part and infundibular above. They reach 20 cm in length and 6 cm in width. The wings are reduced to ribs in aerial pitchers. The peristome is broadly cylindrical, up to 10 mm wide, and bears small but distinct teeth. The peristome ribs are spaced 0.5 to 1 mm apart. Upper pitchers also bear 14 to 18 longitudinal nerves. The mouth is horizontal and elongated into a short neck near the lid. Nepenthes ovata has a racemose inflorescence. Female inflorescences are usually slightly larger than male ones. The peduncle may be up to 7 cm long, while the rachis reaches 10 cm in length. Pedicels are bracteolate and up to 5 mm long. Sepals are lanceolate and up to 3 mm long. The stem, leaves, and pitchers have a sparse indumentum. Inflorescences have a denser covering of hairs. Lower pitchers are usually green to red with a dark red peristome. Upper pitchers are yellowish-green and often have a striped peristome. Ecology Nepenthes ovata is endemic to a number of mountains in North Sumatra, particularly in the Lake Toba region. It grows in stunted mossy forest and ridge top vegetation, often among Sphagnum moss. On Mount Pangulubao, the species usually occurs terrestrially, while on Mount Lubukraya it often grows as an epiphyte. It has also been recorded from Mount Simanukmanuk. The species has an altitudinal distribution of 1700‚Äì2100 m above sea level.Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. Another Nice Trip to Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(1): 4‚Äì10.McPherson, S.R. & A.

Natural hybrids with all of these species except N. tobaica have been recorded. Despite its restricted distribution, N. ovata is no longer considered threatened and its conservation status has been updated to Least concern on the IUCN Red List. Related species The hook-shaped basal appendage of N. ovata (as seen in this upper pitcher) distinguishes it from its closest relatives Nepenthes ovata is closely related to a number of other Sumatran highland species, including N. bongso, N. densiflora, and N. singalana. Its distinguishing feature is the glandular appendage on the underside of the lid. This structure is usually hook-shaped, but may vary considerably in morphology. Nepenthes ovata is thought to be most closesly related to N. bongso. The glandular crest that is so characteristic of N. ovata has also been observed in some forms of N. bongso. Charles Clarke writes that he is \\"reluctant to distinguish N. ovata from [N. bongso] using this criterion only and [is] unable to suggest any other features that might serve this purpose\\". However, he retains N. ovata as a distinct species, noting that although the appendage may be present in N. bongso, this is rarely the case and even then it is usually less developed than in N. ovata. Nepenthes ovata is also similar to N. densiflora, with which it has been confused in the past. The two species can be reliably distinguished on the basis of the hook-shaped appendage, which is never present in N. densiflora. In addition, the lower pitchers of N. densiflora have an elongated neck that is far longer than the same structure in N. ovata. Furthermore, N. densiflora has differently shaped sepals in male and female flowers, whereas those of N. ovata are the same. In their description of N. ovata, Andreas Wistuba and Joachim Nerz compared the species to N. singalana. They noted that N. ovata differs in having an acuminate lamina apex, whereas N. singalana has a rounded apex. The two species also differ in the distribution of nectar glands on the underside of the lid. Nepenthes ovata has numerous glands near the midrib and is densely glandular near and on the hook- shaped appendage. In comparison, N. singalana is only sparsely glandular near the midrib and bears no glands near the lid apex. Nepenthes rigidifolia also bears some similarities to N. ovata, but can be distinguished on the basis of its thicker leaves, sub-apical tendril insertion, and mostly ovoid upper pitchers. In their description of the Sumatran species N. naga, the authors compared it to N. ovata.Akhriadi, P., Hernawati, A. Primaldhi & M. Hambali 2009. Nepenthes naga, a new species of Nepenthaceae from Bukit Barisan of Sumatra . Reinwardtia 12(5): 339‚Äì342. They distinguished it on the basis of its dichotomous lid appendage and frilled lid. Natural hybrids In the wild, N. ovata occurs sympatrically with a number of different Nepenthes species. At least five natural hybrids involving N. ovata has been recorded, four of which are found on Mount Pangulubao. Nepenthes ovata √ó N. spectabilis is known to occur along the summit trail of Mount Pangulubao. This hybrid produces pitchers roughly intermediate in appearance between its parent species. The peristome is flattened and expanded, but to a lesser degree than in N. ovata. The speckles of N. spectabilis are present, but the pitchers have a much lighter colouration. Most examples of this hybrid grow terrestrially and some climb into the forest canopy. N. ovata √ó N. rhombicaulis has also been recorded from the mountain. In addition, Bruce Salmon and Ricky Maulder found N. mikei √ó N. ovata and N. gymnamphora √ó N. ovata on Mount Pangulubao. Some authors consider N. xiphioides to be distinct from N. gymnamphora and so this hybrid is sometimes listed as N. ovata √ó N. xiphioides. Andreas Wistuba observed several natural hybrids with N. flava, including N. flava √ó N. ovata. Most specimens were juvenile rosette plants.

One of Springsteen's best- known singles, Rolling Stone ranked the song 275th on its list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\", and in 2001, the RIAA's Songs of the Century placed the song 59th (out of 365). The song addresses the harmful effects of the Vietnam War on Americans and the treatment of Vietnam veterans upon their return home. It is an ironic retort to the indifference and hostility with which Vietnam veterans were met. Recording history This song was written in 1981 as the title song for a film that Paul Schrader was contemplating making and that Springsteen was considering starring in (Light of Day starring Michael J. Fox). Springsteen thanks Schrader in the liner notes of the album \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\". Casual home demos were made later that year, following the completion of The River Tour. A more formal solo acoustic guitar demo was made on January 3, 1982 at Springsteen's home in Colts Neck, New Jersey during the long session that constituted most of the Nebraska album released later that year. Acoustic versions of several other songs that eventually appeared on the Born in the U.S.A. album were also on this demo, including \\"Child Bride\\" (an early version of \\"Working on the Highway\\") and \\"Downbound Train\\". However, Springsteen's manager/producer Jon Landau and others felt that the song did not have the right melody or music to match the lyrics, and also did not fit in well with the rest of the nascent Nebraska material. As a result, the song was shelved. (This version surfaced in the late 1990s on the Tracks and 18 Tracks outtake collections.) Full E Street Band versions were recorded during the Electric Nebraska sessions, with the Born in the U.S.A. album take 4 completed on April 27, 1982, at the Power Station. Much of the arrangement made up on the spot, including Roy Bittan's opening synthesizer riff and what producer Chuck Plotkin nicknamed Max Weinberg's \\"exploding drums\\". The famous snare drum sound on this record, notable for its gated reverb, was obtained by engineer Toby Scott running the top snare microphone through a broken reverb plate with a fixed four-second decay and into a Kepex noise gate. This is the version that appeared on the Born in the U.S.A. album, a full two years later. The studio recording also originally ended with a lengthy jam session, which was later edited for the song's commercial release. In a 1986 speaking engagement at the University of Georgia, Weinberg stated that \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was his favorite song that the band had recorded. Later, in a separate question and answer session, Weinberg explained that it was his favorite because the song was not written in advance for the various instrumental parts. After a grueling studio session while members of the band were in the booth at the sound board, one member of the band at a time returned to the recording area joining in to make up their own new parts to the song that had been intended as an acoustic guitar-only song. Even Springsteen came out and started singing vocals. It sounded so good that they did it again and recorded it. Without reviewing the recording, Springsteen said, let's do that one more time. So they recorded the second take (or the third time the unwritten version had ever been played). That second studio take was the CD release on the Born in the U.S.A. album.personal communication when asking question to Max Weinberg after lecture in Georgia Hall, Tate Student Center, University of Georgia 1986. Themes Superficially a flag-waving paean to America, the song is a commentary on the return of American soldiers to their country after the Vietnam War. The song presents a veteran as a tragic figure alienated upon his return from the war. The song's working-class protagonist joins the armed forces to \\"fight the yellow man\\" and is disaffected upon his return to the United States. His brother (or \\"buddy\\" in some live shows), also a veteran, is \\"all gone.\\" Though the primary enemy combatants in the Battle of Khe Sanh were the North Vietnamese Army, the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (Viet Cong) did aid the NVA forces in the fighting. For the song's lyrics, obviously, Viet Cong made more sense for poetic purposes, rather than to serve as the most accurate portrayal of the battle. Eventually the Americans prevailed and broke the siege, only to withdraw from the outpost a couple of months later. Khe Sanh thus became one of the media symbols of the futility of the whole war effort in the States. Two scholars writing in the journal American Quarterly explored the song as a lament for embattled American working-class identity. Structurally, they noted that \\"the anthemic chorus contrasted with the verses' desperate narrative,\\" a tension which informs an understanding of the song's overall meaning: the nationalist chorus continuously overwhelms the desperation and sacrifice relayed in the verses. They point out that the imagery of the Vietnam War could be read as metaphor for \\"the social and economic siege of American blue-collar communities\\" at large, and that lyrics discussing economic devastation are likely symbolic for the effect of blind nationalism upon the working class. The song as a whole, they felt, laments the destabilization of the economics and politics protecting the \\"industrial working class\\" in the 1970s and early 1980s, leaving only \\"a deafening but hollow national pride.\\" Political reactions In late August 1984, the Born in the U.S.A. album was selling very well, its songs were frequently aired on radio stations, and the associated tour was drawing considerable press. Springsteen shows at the Capital Centre outside of Washington, D.C. thus attracted even more media attention, in particular from CBS Evening News correspondent Bernard Goldberg, who saw Springsteen as a modern-day Horatio Alger story. Conservative columnist George Will, after attending a show, published a piece on September 13, 1984, titled \\"A Yankee Doodle Springsteen\\", in which he praised Springsteen as an exemplar of classic American values. He wrote: \\"I have not got a clue about Springsteen's politics, if any, but flags get waved at his concerts while he sings songs about hard times. He is no whiner, and the recitation of closed factories and other problems always seems punctuated by a grand, cheerful affirmation: 'Born in the U.S.A.!'\\" The 1984 presidential campaign was in full stride at the time, and Will had connections to President Ronald Reagan's re-election organization. Will thought that Springsteen might endorse Reagan (not knowing that Springsteen did not support him), and got the notion pushed up to high- level Reagan advisor Michael Deaver. His staffers made inquiries to Springsteen's management, which were politely rebuffed. Nevertheless, at a campaign stop in Hammonton, New Jersey on September 19, 1984, Reagan added the following to his speech: The press immediately expressed skepticism that Reagan knew anything about Springsteen, and asked what his favorite Springsteen song was; \\"Born to Run\\" was the response from staffers. Johnny Carson then joked on The Tonight Show, \\"If you believe that, I've got a couple of tickets to the Mondale-Ferraro inaugural ball I'd like to sell you.\\" During a September 21 concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen responded negatively by introducing his song \\"Johnny 99\\", a song about an unemployed auto worker who turns to murder, \\"The President was mentioning my name the other day, and I kinda got to wondering what his favorite album musta been. I don't think it was the Nebraska album. I don't think he's been listening to this one.\\" A few days after that, presidential challenger Walter Mondale said, \\"Bruce Springsteen may have been born to run but he wasn't born yesterday\\", and then claimed to have been endorsed by Springsteen. Springsteen manager Jon Landau denied any such endorsement, and the Mondale campaign issued a correction. Springsteen wrote \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" about the working-class man, who in Springsteen's words was facing \\"a spiritual crisis, in which man is left lost. It's like he has nothing left to tie him into society anymore. He's isolated from the government. Isolated from his job. Isolated from his family ... to the point where nothing makes sense.\\" Springsteen promotes the fact that the endless search for truth is the true American way. In 2000, Reason editor and libertarian journalist Brian Doherty, noting that political song lyrics are often either misunderstood or not understood at all by fans, wrote, \\"But who's to say Reagan wasn't right to insist the song was an upper? When I hear those notes and that drumbeat, and the Boss' best arena-stentorian, shout-groan vocals come over the speakers, I feel like I'm hearing the national anthem.\\"Doherty, Brian. Rage On, Reason (October 2000) General reaction \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" peaked at #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts in January 1985. It was the third of a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles to be released from the Born in the U.S.A. album. In addition it made the top 10 of Billboard's Rock Tracks chart, indicating solid play on album-oriented rock stations. The physical single was certified Gold by the RIAA on July 23, 1999, and additionally it has sold over a million digital copies in the U.S. by July 2016 after becoming available for downloads. The song was also a hit in the UK, reaching #5 on the UK Singles Chart. Beyond the 1984 presidential campaign, \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was widely misinterpreted as purely nationalistic by those who heard the anthemic chorus but not the bitter verses. When Springsteen played the song live in East Berlin in 1988 the German audience widely followed the chorus line to express their bonds with the western world and their weariness with their own way of life in the communist system of the GDR.See the German \\"Pop 2000\\" Episode 9 (#5/5) at 04:20. Springsteen refused Chrysler Corporation CEO Lee Iacocca's request to use \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" in commercials for Chrysler cars, turning down an offer that would have been worth several million dollars. Music video The music video for \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was directed by noted filmmaker John Sayles. It consisted of video concert footage of Springsteen and the E Street Band performing the song, poorly synchronized with audio from the studio recording. Released on November 28, 1984, there supposedly had not been enough time to mix the audio from the concert. This footage was intermixed with compelling mid-1980s scenes of working-class America, emphasizing images that had some connection with the song, including Vietnam veterans, Amerasian children, assembly lines, oil refineries, cemeteries, and the like, finishing with a recreation of the album's cover, with a grizzled Springsteen posing in front of an American flag. Remixes On January 10, 1985, Arthur Baker's 12-inch \\"Freedom Mix\\" of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was released. It was a fairly radical remixing, even more so than those Baker had done for the album's previous singles \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" and \\"Cover Me\\". The mix removed any (possibly misleading) anthemic elements and pushed the song's mournfulness to the front. Synthesizer, glockenspiel, and drums were chopped up and isolated against Springsteen vocal fragments saying \\"Oh my God, no\\", and \\"U.S.A.‚ÄîU.S.‚ÄîU.S.‚ÄîU.S.A.\\" This remix was the least commercially successful of Baker's efforts, however, as unlike the prior two it failed to appear on Billboard's Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. Live performances and subsequent versions On Springsteen's 1984‚Äì1985 Born in the U.S.A. Tour, \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" almost always opened the concerts, in a dramatic, crowd rousing fashion. One such version is included on the Live/1975‚Äì85 album. On the 1988 Tunnel of Love Express Tour, \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" generally closed the first set, and on the 1992‚Äì1993 \\"Other Band\\" Tour, it appeared frequently at the end of the second set. These were both full band versions, although the latter stressed guitar parts more than the familiar synthesizer line. Beginning with the 1995‚Äì1997 solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour and associated promotional media appearances, Springsteen radically recast \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" once again, playing an acoustic guitar version that was unlike both the original Nebraska and full band performances. This was a stinging, snarling rendition that only included the title phrase twice. This was both in connection with the Tom Joad Tour's wan moods as well as Springsteen's attempt to make clear the song's original and only purpose; in his introduction to the song in this shows he said he still wasn't convinced the song had been misinterpreted, but now as the songwriter he was \\"going to get the last say.\\" Fan reaction was divided, with some greatly liking the new arrangement and others thinking the song's musical ironies had been lost. During the 1999‚Äì2000 Reunion Tour, \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" was not always played, and when it was, it was the stinging solo acoustic version, now on 12-string slide guitar. Such a performance is included on the DVD and CD Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band: Live In New York City. Not until 2002's The Rising Tour and 2004's political Vote for Change tour did the full band \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" make a regular comeback; only in the U.S., foreign audiences still got the acoustic one, but a foreign example of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" is heard on Live in Barcelona, in which the full band version is heard. But then towards the end of Springsteen's solo Devils & Dust Tour in 2005, the most challenging \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" yet was unveiled, when he performed it using an amplified \\"stomping board\\" and an ultra-distorting vocal \\"bullet microphone\\", two devices designed to render any song utterly incomprehensible to all but the sharpest of ears. This slot was normally reserved for the dourest of Nebraska material, and \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\"'s appearance in it solidified the impression that its origins in those sessions had not been an accident after all. During the Magic and Working on a Dream Tours, the song was played just 15 times, even though other songs from the album, such as \\"Dancing in the Dark\\", \\"Bobby Jean\\", and \\"Glory Days\\" continued to be regulars. It was famously used as an opener on the radio broadcast July 4, 2008, show in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Eric Rigler has recorded an instrumental bagpipe version of the song that has appeared on various Springsteen tribute albums since 2001.[ Bruce Springsteen Tribute: Made in the U.S.A. review] at Allmusic. Swedish-Argentinian singer-songwriter Jos√© Gonz√°lez performed a solo acoustic version for a time, choosing not to sing the song's title refrain. Singer-songwriter Richard Shindell covered the song in concerts, performing solo and playing bouzouki. Shindell recorded the song for his album South of Delia. This Morning presenter Matt Johnson performed the song as Bruce Springsteen on week 6 of the ITV show 'Your Face Sounds Familiar'. At the 2013 MusiCares Person of the Year ceremony, the song was covered by Neil Young & Crazy Horse with the help of Nils Lofgren; this is ironic for two reasons: one, Neil Young was born in Canada and Lofgren was a member of both Crazy Horse and the E Street Band. There are a number of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" parodies. For example, Cheech and Chong's 1985 comic-political \\"Born in East L.A.\\" and Mad featured a parody written by Frank Jacobs in its July 1985 issue, called \\"Porn in the U.S.A.\\". A group of Sesame Street characters (billed as \\"Bruce Stringbean and the S. Street Band\\") performed a version of the song called \\"Barn in the U.S.A.\\" for the album Born to Add. In Canadian Bacon, a Michael Moore film about a Cold War scenario between Canada and the United States, a group of Americans are travelling across Canada while singing along to \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\". In an apparent nod to the widespread misunderstanding of the lyrics, the characters are only capable of singing the chorus of the song and trail off during the verse. With Springsteen's permission, rap group 2 Live Crew released \\"Banned in the U.S.A.\\", a parody of \\"Born in the U.S.A.\\" released to draw attention to 2 Live Crew's First Amendment troubles.

The specific epithet spectabilis is Latin for \\"visible\\" or \\"notable\\".Clarke, C.M. 2001. Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Botanical history An illustration of the type specimen (L√∂rzing 7308) from Danser's monograph The first known collection of N. spectabilis was made by Julius August L√∂rzing in 1920. The specimen L√∂rzing 7308 was collected on June 5, 1920, on Mount Sibajak at an altitude of 1800 to 1900 m. It is deposited at the Bogor Botanical Gardens (formerly the Herbarium of the Buitenzorg Botanic Gardens) along with two isotypes which include both male and female floral material. A third isotype, sheet H.L.B. 928.350-170, is held at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden and includes female floral material. L√∂rzing made two further collections of N. spectabilis in 1921. A fourth specimen was collected by Mohamed Nur bin Mohamed Ghose later that same year. B. H. Danser formally described N. spectabilis in his seminal monograph \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", published in 1928.Danser, B.H. 1928. The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies. Bulletin du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©rie III, 9(3‚Äì4): 249‚Äì438. He designated L√∂rzing 7308 as the type specimen. Danser wrote: > This new species has only been found on the G.

The next major taxonomic treatment of N. spectabilis came only in 1986, when Rusjdi Tamin and Mitsuru Hotta covered the species in their monograph on the Nepenthes of Sumatra. Tamin, R. & M. Hotta 1986. Nepenthes di Sumatera: The genus Nepenthes of the Sumatra Island. In: M. Hotta (ed.) Diversity and Dynamics of Plant Life in Sumatra: Forest Ecosystem and Speciation in Wet Tropical Environments. Part 1: Reports and Collection of Papers. Kyoto University, Kyoto. pp. 75‚Äì109. An article authored by Bruce Lee Bednar and published in a 1987 issue of the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter mentions a plant known as N. spectabilis in the horticultural trade.Bednar, B.L. 1987. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 16(3): 69‚Äì70. Taxonomist Jan Schlauer considers this plant conspecific with N. curtisii, which in turn is treated as a junior synonym of N. maxima.Schlauer, J. 2006. Nepenthes spectabilis. Carnivorous Plant Database. In their 1997 revision of the genus, Matthew Jebb and Martin Cheek treated specimens of N. lavicola as belonging to N. spectabilis. They also designated L√∂rzing 7308 as the lectotype of N. spectabilis.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106. The subsequent monograph of Charles Clarke treats these taxa as distinct species. Description Nepenthes spectabilis is a climbing plant. The stem can reach lengths of 6 m and is up to 7 mm in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical in cross section and up to 10 cm long. A lower pitcher Leaves are coriaceous and sessile. The lamina is oblong and up to 16 cm long by 6 cm wide. It has a rounded-acute apex and is gradually attenuate towards the base. Up to 6 longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins are usually indistinct. Tendrils are up to 25 cm long. Rosette and lower pitchers are narrowly ovoid in the lower third to half of the pitcher cup. Above the hip, they are cylindrical and somewhat narrower. Terrestrial pitchers are relatively small, growing to 12 cm in height and 4 cm in width. A pair of fringed wings (‚â§4 mm wide) runs down the front of the pitcher. The glandular region covers the ovoid portion of the pitcher's inner surface; the waxy zone above is well developed. The mouth is round and flat at the front, becoming oblique towards the lid. The peristome is cylindrical in cross section and up to 4 mm wide. Its inner margin is lined with small but distinct teeth. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 41% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The pitcher lid or operculum is sub-orbicular in shape, lacks appendages, and has a strongly cordate base. The spur is very long (‚â§30 mm) and unbranched. It is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers arise gradually from the end of the tendril. They are very narrowly infundibular in the lower half to three-quarters. Above the hip, they are either cylindrical or narrowly infundibular. Aerial pitchers are much larger than their terrestrial counterparts, growing to 26 cm in height and 4.5 cm in width. They usually have ribs in place of wings, although fringe elements may be present near the peristome. The glandular region covers the inner surface below the hip. The pitcher mouth is round and has a steeply oblique insertion. The peristome is cylindrical and up to 3 mm wide. Other parts of the upper pitchers are similar to those of the lower pitchers. Nepenthes spectabilis has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle grows to 12 cm in length. The rachis may be up to 15 cm long, although it is usually shorter and denser in female inflorescences. Partial peduncles are bracteolate and two-flowered. Sepals are elliptic-oblong in shape and up to 5 mm long. Nepenthes spectabilis exhibits considerable variation in the development of its indumentum. In most plants, developing parts are covered in short, stellate reddish-brown hairs, although many of these are caducous. Inflorescences and the margins of the lamina bear dense, stellate reddish- brown hairs that are persistent. A dense covering of short, persistent hairs is also present on the lower surface of the midrib. The stem and lamina are green. Pitchers are characteristically light green with numerous dark brown speckles. The peristome is often yellowish-green with brown stripes. Ecology Nepenthes spectabilis is endemic to the Indonesian provinces of North Sumatra and Aceh. Its natural range stretches from the Lake Toba region in the south to Mount Kemiri in the north. It has an altitudinal distribution of 1400‚Äì2200 m above sea level. Nepenthes spectabilis grows in mossy forest and stunted upper montane forest. It usually occurs terrestrially, but may also be epiphytic.Hopkins, M., R. Maulder & B.[R.] Salmon 1990. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 19(1‚Äì2): 19‚Äì28.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Sumatra and Java. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. Nepenthes spectabilis from Mount Kemiri, the northern limit of its range Certain populations of N. spectabilis differ considerably in morphology. Plants from the type locality produce relatively broad upper pitchers, while those from Mount Pangulubao are much narrower. A particularly gracile form has been recorded from the west side of Lake Toba. Plants from Mount Siluatan are different still, producing pitchers that are green throughout. The species also exhibits great variability in the extent of the indumentum; some plants have a dense covering of hairs, while others are virtually glabrous. The form of N. spectabilis from Mount Bandahara is very large and has an unusual flared peristome. Plants grow in Sphagnum moss. In 1996, Paul Harwood, Heiko Rischer and Andreas Wistuba observed that the majority of prey in both lower and upper pitchers of this form consisted of beetles. They also found infaunal mosquito larvae in the pitchers.Harwood, P., H. Rischer & A. Wistuba 1998. The carnivorous flora of Gunung Bandahara. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 27(2): 59‚Äì61. In the wild, N. spectabilis is sympatric with N. flava,Wistuba, A., J. Nerz & A. Fleischmann 2007. flava, a new species of Nepenthaceae from the northern part of Sumatra. Blumea 52(1): 159‚Äì163. N. gymnamphora, N. mikei, N. ovata, N. rhombicaulis, and N. rigidifolia. Natural hybrids with all of these species except N. flava have been recorded.Salmon, B.R. & R.G. Maulder 1995. Two New Species of Nepenthes from North Sumatra, Indonesia. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 24(3): 77‚Äì85. Due to the patchy distribution of N. spectabilis, its conservation status is listed as Vulnerable on the 2006 IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Upon observing N. spectabilis on Mount Pangulubao in 1995, botanist Charles Clarke wrote that he \\"got the impression that collectors had taken a bit of a toll on the population, partly because very few immature plants were visible\\".Clarke, C.[M.] 1997. Another Nice Trip to Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 26(1): 4‚Äì10. Related species An upper pitcher of N. rigidifolia Nepenthes spectabilis is thought to be most closely related to N. lavicola. It can be distinguished from that species on the basis of its smaller floral bracts, longer fruits, and very long unbranched spur. In addition, the species differ in the shape of their lower pitchers. Those of N. lavicola are urceolate to globose, while those of N. spectabilis are ovoid in the lower part and cylindrical above. Furthermore, the pitchers of N. lavicola are generally dark brown or purple throughout, compared to the light green and dark brown speckled traps of N. spectabilis.Wistuba, A. & H. Rischer 1996. Nepenthes lavicola, a new species of Nepenthaceae from the Aceh Province in the North of Sumatra. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 25(4): 106‚Äì111. In Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia, Charles Clarke mentions an undescribed taxon from Aceh that is intermediate in appearance between N. lavicola and N. spectabilis. It is unlikely to be of hybridogenic origin as it is not sympatric with any other Nepenthes species. Nepenthes rigidifolia also bears a superficial resemblance to N. spectabilis, particularly in the colouration of its pitchers. Apart from its markedly different upper pitchers, N. spectabilis differs from the former in having thin leaves, an unbranched spur, and an apical tendril insertion.Akhriadi, P., Hernawati & R. Tamin 2004. A new species of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae) from Sumatra. Reinwardtia 12(2): 141‚Äì144. In his 1928 monograph, B. H. Danser placed N. spectabilis in the Nobiles clade. He wrote: > The third group, that of the Nobiles, comprises the species that form a > transition between the Vulgatae and the Montanae on one hand and the Regiae > on the other. N. spectabilis, from Sumatra, reminds one of N. sanguinea in > many respects but shows a resemblance with the Regiae by the yellowish > colour of herbarium specimens and by the red-brown indumentum. Clarke suggests that N. spectabilis \\"would perhaps have been better placed in the Montanae, which includes several species that appear to be closely related, such as N. gymnamphora and N. pectinata\\". In 2001, Clarke published a cladistic analysis of the Nepenthes species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia based on 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The resultant cladogram placed N. spectabilis in a small clade with N. gymnamphora. However, since the study was limited in its geographical scope, this placement may not accurately reflect the relationship between N. spectabilis and its closest relatives. Natural hybrids Nepenthes spectabilis occurs sympatrically with many other Nepenthes species and a number of natural hybrids have been recorded. =N. ovata √ó N. spectabilis= Nepenthes ovata √ó N. spectabilis is known to occur along the summit trail of Mount Pangulubao. This hybrid produces pitchers roughly intermediate in appearance between its parent species. The peristome is flattened and expanded, but to a lesser degree than in N. ovata. The speckles of N. spectabilis are present, but the pitchers have a much lighter colouration. Most examples of this hybrid grow terrestrially and some climb into the forest canopy. =N. rigidifolia √ó N. spectabilis= Several plants representing the cross N. rigidifolia √ó N. spectabilis have been recorded from an open rocky outcrop close to the type locality of N. rigidifolia. The hybrid differs from N. rigidifolia in having narrower pitchers with an infundibular base and distinct hip around the middle. On the other hand, the pitchers of this hybrid are broader than those of N. spectabilis and have a wider, expanded peristome. The richly coloured lower pitchers of N. rigidifolia √ó N. spectabilis superficially resemble those of N. macfarlanei. However, since that species is confined to Peninsular Malaysia, the two taxa are not easily confused. =Other hybrids= Four other natural hybrids with N. spectabilis have been recorded. These are N. gymnamphora √ó N. spectabilis, N. mikei √ó N. spectabilis, N. rhombicaulis √ó N. spectabilis, and N. spectabilis √ó N. tobaica. Notes References Further reading * Bonhomme, V., H.

The reservoir was created by the construction of 319 ft (97 m) high Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River which, with the lake, serves as much of the county line between Fresno County to the south and Madera County to the north. Part of the Central Valley Project, the dam was built by the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) and was completed in 1942. The lake stores water for irrigation, which is distributed by the Madera and Friant- Kern Canals to the San Joaquin Valley. It has an instantaneous capacity of . Secondary uses include flood control and recreation, including swimming, fishing, water skiing and camping. A 25 MW hydroelectric plant operated by the Friant Power Authority produces electricity from large releases and two smaller plants use water released for a fish hatchery and to maintain minimum- flow in the river. Prior to the construction of Friant Dam, the current lake bed was the site of the town of Millerton, the first county seat of Fresno County. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the Millerton Lake due to elevated levels of mercury. Environmental impacts By diverting most of the San Joaquin River for irrigation, the Friant Dam has caused about of the river to run dry except in high water years when floodwaters are spilled from the dam. The desiccation of the river has caused the degradation of large stretches of riverside habitat and marshes, and has nearly eliminated the historic chinook salmon run that once reached about 15,000 fish each year. Reduction in flows has also increased the concentration of pesticide and fertilizer runoff in the river contributing to pollution that has further impacted aquatic species. On September 13, 2006, after eighteen years of litigation, environmental groups, fisherman and the USBR reached an agreement on releasing part of the water currently diverted into the irrigation canals into the San Joaquin River in order to help restore the river and its native fish and wildlife. The first water was released on October 2, 2009 at a rate of . By 2014, these \\"restoration flows\\" will be increased to per year, or , on top of the that is currently released for agricultural purposes. However, the river restoration project will cause a 12‚Äì20% reduction in irrigation water delivered from Friant Dam.

She later also gave birth to a daughter, Liu Huiyuan (ÂäâÊÉ†Â™õ, the later Princess Yixing). In 420, after Liu Yu seized the throne from Emperor Gong of Jin and established Liu Song as its emperor, he created her an imperial consort, but not an empress, as she was not his wife. He created her son Liu Yifu as crown prince. After Emperor Wu died in 422, Liu Yifu succeeded him as Emperor Shao, and Emperor Shao honored her as empress dowager. In 424, Emperor Shao was deposed by officials that Emperor Wu had left in charge of the government, who believed that he was unfit to be emperor, and soon they killed him. They made his capable younger brother Liu Yilong, by a different mother, emperor (as Emperor Wen) instead. Initially, Empress Dowager Zhang returned her empress dowager seal and moved to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), where her son was exiled and killed.

Gonbad-e Qabus, a remnant of Ziyarid architecture Segonbad The history of designing gonbads dates back to pre-Islamic Persia. The Parthians in particular were very keen in using such structures in their designs. The Sassanids inherited them and elevated their designs into full maturity. A gonbad is often double layered, and can have many shapes, such as semi- spherical, partial spherical, onion shaped, paraboloid, polygonal conical, and circular conical. In pre-Islamic times, the gonbad was a sign of imperial grandeur for the king. In Islamic times, the tradition continued, and the interiors were made to simulate the celestial dome, reminding the Muslim of Man's place in the cosmos compared to God and creation. K√ºmbet K√ºmbet is the name given to Seljuq mausoleums. K√ºmbet are an important part of Seljuq architecture. In Turkey, Azerbaijan and Iran where the Turks set up states and ruled for centuries, there are a number of examples of such mausoleums. Particularly fashionable in the thirteenth century,The heritage of Eastern Turkey: from earliest settlements to Islam, Antonio Sagona, 2006, p. 208 these monuments, referred to in Turkish as k√ºmbet, are a continuation of the Turkish burial customs of Central Asia. These structures are either polygonal or cylindrical in shape arid are covered with a dome. The main body of the monument rests on a cubic base, the corners of which are bevelled. In the examples built before the 16th century, the dome is covered with a conical or pyramidal spire. Most of these monuments are two storied. Concealed inside the base, half of which is below ground level, is a crypt; the latter is covered by a vault and its floor is earth. The deceased was buried in the earth. The crypt had small loop-hole windows. Most k√ºmbet in Turkey are found in the provinces of Kayseri, Erzurum, Konya, Ahlat and Bitlis =Hudavend Hatun= K√ºmbet of Hudavend Hatun in Niƒüde The K√ºmbet of Hudavend Hatun is located in Niƒüde city. It was built in 1312 and was commissioned by Hudavend Hatun, daughter of the Seljuk Sultan Kilij Arslan IV, and was restored by the General Directorate of Religious Endowments (Vakiflar Genel Mudurlugu) in 1962. The tomb is made of yellow cut stone and is covered by a dome topped with an eight-faceted pyramidal crown on the exterior. Total height is 15.5 meters. White marble was used in the lintels, the arches, the inscription plaques, and the cornice of the dome. The tomb is most known for its elaborate vegetal and zoomorphic carvings. =D√∂ner K√ºmbet= The Revolving Tomb is in the way to Talas in Kayseri, as it is called, does not revolve, but its cylindrical form makes it look as though it might. Built in 1276 as the final resting-place of ≈ûah Cihan Hatun, an imperial princess, it is covered in high-relief arabesque decoration depicting animals and plants. The nearby Sir√ßali K√ºmbet is not quite as elaborate. The √áifte K√ºmbet (Double Tomb) (also in Kayseri), 5 km along on the way to Sivas, is yet another of these characteristic Seljuq royal tombs. =The K√ºmbet of Halime Hatun= Ahi Emir Ahmet T√ºrbe, a K√ºmbet in Sivas, Turkey About 2 km to the north of the Geva≈ü district on the shore of Lake Van there is an old graveyard that has been in use ever since the Seljuq period. One of the most impressive pre-Ottoman grave monuments is the K√ºmbet of Halime Hatun, which is in the same graveyard. This monument was recently repaired and changes made to the entrance to the crypt. It attracted the attention of a number of travellers who visited the area in the last century, prompting W. Bachmann to make a serious study of it. However, the fƒ±rst scientifƒ±c study of this monument was carried out by Prof. Dr. Oktay Aslanapa. =The K√ºmbet of Kadem Pasa Hatun= This monument lies 1‚Äì2 km to the east of Erci≈ü, at the junction of the Erci≈ü-Van and Patnos-Van roads. It was repaired in the 1970s, when crumbling stones on the base and main body of the monument were replaced. Stone staircases leading to the crypt and to the upper floor were built at the same time. A wall was also built around the garden in which the monument lies. =The Zortul K√ºmbet= This monument, which lies on level ground to the left of the Erci≈ü-Patnos road above 5 km northwest of Erci≈ü itself, has no special name. Abd√ºrrahim ≈ûerif Beygu, who visited the monument in 1931, stated that its east window part of the spire had crumbled away. Oktay Aslanapa confirms this information, stating that the upper part of the roof had collapsed and that the monument was in a very poor state. Repairs have been carried out which have halted its deterioration. Image:Gonbad shariati hospital2.jpgCloseup of a gonbad revealing tile configuration.

The tomb, located in the city of Bijapur, or Vijapur in Karnataka, southern India, was built in 1659 by the famous architect, Yaqut of Dabul. The structure consists of a massive square chamber measuring nearly 50 m (160 ft) on each side and covered by a huge dome 43.3 m (142 ft) in diameter making it one of the largest dome structures in world. The dome is supported on giant squinches supported by groined pendentives while outside the building is supported by domed octagonal corner towers. The Dome is the second largest one in the world which is unsupported by any pillars. The acoustics of the enclosed place make it a whispering gallery where even the smallest sound is heard across the other side of the Gumbaz. At the periphery of the dome is a circular balcony where visitors can witness the astounding whispering gallery. Any whisper, clap or sound gets echoed around 7 times. Anything whispered from one corner of the gallery can be heard clearly on the diagonally opposite side. It is also said that the Sultan, Ibrahim Adil Shah and his Queen used to converse in the same manner. During his time, the musicians used to sing, seated in the whispering gallery so that the sound produced could reach every corner of the hall. One can easily make out the restoration carried out on the structure by comparing the photographs.

Determining authenticity of hadith is enormously important in Islam because along with the Quran, the Sunnah of the Islamic prophet‚Äîhis words, actions, and the silent approval‚Äîare considered divine revelation (wahy), and the record of them (i.e. hadith) provides the basis of Islamic law (Sharia). In addition, while the number of verses pertaining to law in the Quran is relatively few, hadith give direction on everything from details of religious obligations (such as Ghusl or Wudu, ablutionsAn-Nawawi, Riyadh As-Salihin, 1975: p.203 for salat prayer), to the correct forms of salutations,An-Nawawi, Riyadh As-Salihin, 1975: p.168 and the importance of benevolence to slaves.An- Nawawi, Riyadh As-Salihin, 1975: p.229 Thus the \\"great bulk\\" of the rules of Islamic law are derived from hadith, rather than the Quran. Because hadith were passed down orally and not compiled in written works until around the third century of Islam,Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.83 there is no ancient written documentation to examine. Thus, according to the classical science of hadith, there are three primary ways to determine the authenticity (sihha) of a hadith: by attempting to determine whether there are \\"other identical reports from other transmitters\\"; determining the reliability of the transmitters of the report; and \\"the continuity of the chain of transmission\\" of the hadith.Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.110 Definition It has been described by one hadith specialist, Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, as the science of the principles by which the conditions of both the sanad, the chain of narration, and the matn, the text of the hadith, are known. This science is concerned with the sanad and the matn with its objective being distinguishing the sahih, authentic, from other than it. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani said the preferred definition is: knowledge of the principles by which the condition of the narrator and the narrated are determined.Tadrib al-Rawi, vol. 1, pp. 38‚Äì9. Types Some of the disciplines in the science of hadith, according to scholar ƒ∞smail L√ºtfi √áakan, include: *the \\"study of the circumstances surrounding the genesis of each hadith,\\" i.e. the reasons for why the hadith was uttered; *the study of the gharib al-hadith, whose works provide \\"a kind of hadith glossary\\" of uncommon words found in hadith; *the study of ilel al- hadith, which examines deficiencies in the text and/or the chain of a hadith; *study of al-hadith al-muhtelif, which attempts to reconcile the contradictions of hadith; *the study of naskh or nasikh and mansukh in hadith, which also attempts to reconcile contradictions in hadiths, but by determining which of the contradicting hadith abrogates the other; *study of sharh al- hadith, which are commentary on hadith that attempt \\"to explain the intentions Prophet Muhammad\\"; *study of  øilm jar·∏• wa ta ødƒ´l (wounding and rectifying), which attempts to verify the reliability of transmitters of hadith, their deficiencies and virtues; *study of transmitters of hadith,  øilm al-rijƒÅl (science of men) which provides biographies of the narrators and the different categories they fall under.  History  After the death of Muhammad, his sayings were preserved in both written and memorized form. According to Islamic tradition, Umar ibn al-Khattab, the second caliph, started the process of collecting all the hadiths together into one unified volume, but gave up the endeavor \\"for fear the Quran would be neglected by the Muslims\\" (according to Muhammad Zubayr Siddiqi). The Umayyad caliph, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (aka Umar II, who reigned from 717-720 CE) also started an effort to collect all the hadiths. Teaching and collecting hadiths was part of a plan of his to renew the moral fiber of the Muslim community. He supported teachers of fiqh, sent educators to ignorant Bedouin tribes, ordered weekly hadith lectures in the Hejaz, and sent out scholars of hadith to Egypt and North Africa, (according to Muhammad Zubayr Siddiqi). Umar also ordered the great scholar of Madinah, Abu Bakr ibn Hazm to write down all the hadiths of Muhammad and Umar ibn al-Khattab, particularly those narrated by Aisha. He had these hadiths collected in books which were circulated around the Umayyad Empire. Although these books are lost today, commentaries on them by Ibn al-Nadim reveals that they are organized like books of fiqh, such as the Muwatta of Imam Malik, the first large compilation of hadiths. Imam Malik himself probably followed the general plan of the early books of hadith ordered by Umar. Hadith studies developed in part because forgery \\"took place on a massive scale\\",Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.93 with perhaps the most famous collector of hadith and practitioner of  ªilm al-·∏•adƒ´th -- Muhammad al-Bukhari‚Äîsifting through nearly 600,000, over 16 years before eliminating all but approximately 7400 hadith. Traditional accounts describe \\"the systematic study of hadith\\" as being motivated by the altruism of \\"pious scholars\\" seeking to correct this problem.Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.19 Some scholars (Daniel W. Brown, A. Kevin Reinhart) shed doubt on this. Brown believes the theory \\"fails\\" to adequately account \\"for the atmosphere of conflict\\" of at least early hadith criticism. The \\"method of choice\\" of partisans seeking to discredit opposing schools of Islamic law was to discredit the authorities (transmitters) of their opponent's hadith‚Äîto \\"tear apart\\" their isnads\\". (To do this required developing biographical evaluations of hadith transmitters --  øilm al-rijƒÅl and ilm jarh wa ta‚Äôdil). Reinhart finds descriptions of famous companions of Muhammad in Ibn Sa'd's KitƒÅb a·π≠-·π≠abaqƒÅt al-kabƒ´r \\"recording hadith and transmitting it, asking each other about precedents, and reproaching those who disregarded this authentic religious knowledge\\" in suspicious conformity to the \\"mythology of the pristine early community\\". As the criteria for judging authenticity grew into the six major collections of ·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏• (sound) hadith (Kutub al-Sittah) in the third century, the science of hadith was described as having become a \\"mature system\\", or to have entered its \\"final stage\\".Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.94 The classification of Hadith into *sahih, sound or authentic; *hasan, good; *da'if, weak, *(another rating is maw·∏ç≈´ ø, fabricated). was utilized early in hadith scholarship by Ali ibn al-Madini (161‚Äì234 AH).Ahmad ibn Ali ibn Hajr al- Asqalani, al-Nukat ala Kitab ibn al-Salah, vol. 1, p. 263, Maktabah al-Furqan, Ajman, U.A.E., second edition, 2003 Later, al-Madini's student Muhammad al- Bukhari (810‚Äì870) authored a collection, now known as Sahih Bukhari, commonly accepted by Sunni scholars to be the most authentic collection of hadith, followed by that of his student Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj.Ibn Kathir, Ikhtisar Ulum al-Hadith published with explanation al-Ba'ith al-Hathith, vol. 1, pp. 102‚Äì3, Maktabah al-Ma'arif, Riyadh, K.S.A., first edition, 1996 Al-Bukhari's methods of testing hadiths and isnads are seen as exemplary of the developing methodology of hadith scholarship.Ibid.  Evaluating authenticity  An elaborate system was developed by scholars of hadith to determine the authenticity of traditions based on \\"two premises\\": #that the authenticity of a hadith report is \\"best measured by the reliability of the transmitters\\" (known as rƒÅwƒ´ pl. ruwƒÅt) of the report; #consequently, \\"carefully scrutinizing\\" the \\"individual transmitters\\" of the hadith (ilm jarh wa ta‚Äôdil;  øilm al-rijƒÅl) and \\"the continuity of their chains of transmission\\" is the best way to measure hadith reliability.Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.82 A basic element of hadith studies consist of a careful examination of the chain of transmission (sanad , also isnƒÅd , or silsila ), relaying each hadith from the Prophet to the person who compiles the hadith. The isnƒÅd and the commentary are distinct from the matn (), which is the main body, or text, of the hadith,Tadrib al-Rawi, by al-Suyuti vol. 1, pp. 39‚Äì41 with abridgement. These two terms are the primary components of every hadith. According to the person most responsible for elevation of the importance of hadith in Islamic law, Imam Al-Shafi‚Äòi, > \\"In most cases the truthfulness or lack of truthfulness of a tradition can > only be known through the truthfulness or lack of truthfulness of the > transmitter, except in a few special cases when he relates what cannot > possibly be the case, or what is contradicted by better-authenticated > information.\\"Al-Shafi'i, al-Risala, Bulaq, 1321; ed. Sheikh Ahmad Muhammad > Shakir, Cairo, 1940 (ed. Shakir), 55 The first people who received hadith were Muhammad's \\"Companions\\" (Sahaba), who are believed to have understood and preserved it. They conveyed it to those after them as they were commanded; then the generation following them, the \\"Followers\\" (Tabi‚Äòun), received it and then conveyed it to those after them, and so on. Thus, the Companion would say, ‚ÄúI heard the Prophet say such and such.‚Äù The Follower would say, ‚ÄúI heard a Companion say, ‚ÄòI heard the Prophet say‚Äô‚Äù The one after the Follower would say, ‚ÄúI heard a Follower say, ‚ÄòI heard a Companion say, ‚ÄòI heard the Prophet say‚Äô‚Äù and so on.Ilm al-Rijal wa Ahimiyatuh, by Mu'allami, p. 16, Dar al-Rayah. I substituted the word sunnah with the word hadith as they are synonymous in this context. =Criteria to be a ·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏• hadith= To be '·π£a·∏•ƒ´·∏• (\\"sound\\") hadith, an isolated hadith (Mutawatir hadith were exempt from these tests) \\"must pass five tests\\": #\\"continuity of transmission\\";Muhammad  øAjjaj al-Kha·π≠ƒ´b, U·π£l al-·∏•adƒ´th, 305; quoted in Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.110 # øadƒÅla of transmitters, i.e. transmitters must be of good character;Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.110 #\\"accuracy (·∏çab·π≠) of the process of transmission, i.e. narrators must not be prone to carelessness or known to have poor memories\\"; #absence of \\"irregularities\\" (shadh≈´dh), i.e. hadith must not contradict a \\"more reliable source\\"; #\\"absence of corrupting defects( øilla qƒÅdi·∏•a), i.e. inaccuracies in reporting the actual chain of transmission.\\" = Biographical evaluation = An important discipline within hadith studies is biographical evaluation, the study of transmitters of hadith,  øilm al-rijƒÅl, (literally \\"science of men\\") mentioned above. These are the narrators who make up the sanad. Ilm ar-rijal is based on certain verses of the Quran. Transmitters are studied and rated for their \\"general capacity\\" (·∏çƒÅbit; itqƒÅn) and their moral character ( øadƒÅla). #General capacity is measured by qualities such as memory, linguistic ability. Transmitters that have good memories and linguistic ability \\"might be considered competent (·∏çƒÅbit)\\". # øadƒÅla transmitters must be \\"adult Muslims, fully in control of their mental faculties, aware of their moral responsibilities, free from guilt for major sins, and not prone to minor sins\\". Examples of ratings of transmitters include \\"trustworthy\\" or thiqa for ones that possess both  øadƒÅla and ·∏çƒÅbit. Transmitters that are  øadƒÅla but show signs of carelessness are rated honest or ·π£ud≈´q. The result of this study were \\"vast biographical dictionaries\\" to check against the isnads of individual hadith. Not all transmitters were evaluated for these characteristics and rated. Companions of the prophet (·π£a·∏•ƒÅba) were traditionally considered to possess collective moral turpitude or ta ødƒ´l, by virtue of their exposure to the Prophet, so that they all possessed  øadƒÅla without needing to be evaluated. (This quality was similar to that of Prophetic infallibility ( øi·π£ma) but of course lower in level.) Shaykh Muhammad Zakariya al-Kandahlawi has mentioned that Imam Bukhari (the famous compiler of \\"sound\\" hadith) listed the following as criterion for a muhaddith: #The four things which one must write are: ##The hadith of the Prophet and his rulings ##The sayings of the Sahaba and the status of each sahabi (companions of the prophet) ##The sayings of the Tabieen (i.e., the Salaf-us Salaheen who met the Sahaba, but did not meet the Blessed Prophet). The level of each of the Tabieen. Who amongst them was reliable and who was unreliable ##Knowledge of all the narrators who narrate hadith and their history #The history of the narrators must include four things: ##Their Isma- ul-Rijjal (biographies) ##Their kunniyaat (nicknames) ##Their place of settlement ##Their date of birth and date of death (to verify whether this person met the people whom he narrated from) =Traditional importance of the sanad= The second criteria after judging the general ability and moral probity of the transmitters, is the \\"continuity\\" of the chain of transmission of the hadith. The transmitters must be shown to have received the accounts of the prophet \\"in an acceptable manner from the preceding authority in the chain\\". > Transmitters must have lived during the same period, they must have had the > opportunity to meet, and they must have reached sufficient age at the time > of transmission to guarantee their capacity to transmit. Early religious scholars stressed the importance of the sanad. For example, according to an early Quranic exegete, Matr al-Warraq,Matr ibn Tihman al- Warraq died in the year 119 after the migration; he used to transcribe the Quran (Kitab al-Jami bain Rijal al-Sahihain, vol. 2, p. 526, Dar al-Kutub al- Ilmiyah). the verse from the Quran, ‚ÄúOr a remnant of knowledge,‚ÄùSorah al- Ahqaf: 4 refers to the isnad of a hadith.Reported by al-Khatib al-Bagdadi in Sharaf Ashab al-Hadith, p. 83, no. 68, Maktabah Ibn Taymiyah. al-Sakhawi also mentioned this narration in Fath al-Mugith, vol. 3, p. 333, Dar Alam al-Kutub. In addition, Abd Allah ibn al-Mubarak said, ‚ÄúThe isnad is from the religion; were it not for the isnad anyone could say anything they wanted.‚ÄùReported by Muslim in the introduction to his Sahih, vol. 1, p. 9, Dar Taibah. This narration is also mentioned in the translation of ‚ÄòAn Introduction to the Science of Hadith,‚Äô p. 183. According to Ibn al-Salah, the sanad originated within the Muslim scholastic community and remains unique to it.Ulum Al- Hadith, p. 255; this also appears on p. 183 of the translation. Ibn Hazm said that the connected, continuous sanad is particular to the religion of Islam: the sanad was also used by the Jewish community, but they had a break of more than 30 generations between them and Moses, and the Christians limited their use of the sanad to the prohibition of divorce.Summarized from Tadrib Al-Rawi, vol. 2, p. 143. The practice of paying particular attention to the sanad can be traced to the generation following that of the Companions, based upon the statement of Muhammad Ibn Sirin: ‚ÄúThey did not previously inquire about the sanad. However, after the turmoil occurred they would say, ‚ÄòName for us your narrators.‚Äô So the people of the Sunnah would have their hadith accepted and the people of innovation would not.‚ÄùReported by Muslim in the introduction to his Sahih, vol. 1, p. 8. Those who were not given to require a sanad were, in the stronger of two opinions, the Companions of the Prophet, while others, such as al-Qurtubi, include the older of the Followers as well.See the discussion of this issue in Qurrat Ayn al-Muhtaj by Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Adam, vol. 2, pp. 57‚Äì8. This is due to the Companions all being considered upright, trustworthy transmitters of hadith, such that a mursal hadith narrated by a Companion is acceptable. Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, stating likewise, cited various evidences for this, from them, the Quranic verse, ‚ÄúAnd you were the best nation brought about to mankind.‚ÄùAl-Kifayah, p. 46, Dar al-Kutub al- Ilmiyyah photocopied from the Indian print with Muallimi‚Äôs verification. The verse mentioned is verse 110 of Surah Aal Imran; the translation of ‚Äòummah‚Äô is based upon Ibn Kathir‚Äôs interpretation of the verse. The fitnah referred to is the conflicting ideologies of the Kharijites and the Ghulat that had emerged at the time of the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan, his assassination and the social unrest of the Kharijites in opposition to the succeeding rulers, Ali and Muawiyah.This is the explanation provided by al-Qurtubi in al-Mufhim, vol. 1, pp. 122‚Äì3 as quoted in Qurrah Ayn Al-Muhtaj, vol. 2, p. 58. The death of Uthman was in the year 35 after the migration.Al-Bidiyah wa Al-Nihayah, vol. 10, p. 323, Dar Alam al-Kutub. =The matn= According to scholar Daniel Brown, in traditional hadith studies, \\"the possibility\\" of criticizing the matn as well as the isnad \\"was recognized in theory, but the option was seldom systematically exercised\\".Brown, Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought, 1996: p.157, note 5 Syrian hadith scholar Dr. Salah al-Din al-Idlibi is expert in the relatively new field of matn criticism. Whereas traditional criticism has focused on verifying the trustworthiness of the people transmitting the hadith, matn criticism studies the contents of the hadith and compares this with the contents of other hadiths and any other available historical evidence with the aim of arriving at an objective historical reality of the event described by the hadith. Muhaddith: scholar of hadith The term mu·∏•addith (plural mu·∏•addith≈´n often translated as \\"traditionist\\") refers to a specialist who profoundly knows and narrates hadith, the chains of their narration isnad, and the original and famous narrators. According to the 8th century Imam, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi\`i, a muhaddith is someone who has memorised at least 400,000 narrations along with the chain of narrators for each narration. The female equivalent is a muhadditha. In describing the muhaddith, Al-Dhahabi raised the question, \\"Where is the knowledge of hadith, and where are its people?\\" Answering his own question, he said, \\"I am on the verge of not seeing them except engrossed in a book or under the soil.\\"Tathkirah al-Huffath, by al-Dhahabi, vol. 1, p. 4, edited under the supervision of Wizarah al-Ma'arif of the High Court of India by al- Muallimee. Both men and women can serve as muhaddithin (traditionists). The requirements for a muhaddith are the same requirements that apply to the reception and transmission of reports (riwayah) in the Islamic tradition more generally: truthfulness, integrity, a competent and accurate memory, being free of prejudice or compulsion that might be presumed to distort the reporting.Mohammad Akram Nadwi, Al-Muhaddithat: The Women Scholars in Islam, (Oxford/London: Interface Publications, 2007), p. 17. There are numerous women who have served as muhaddithat in the history of Islam. Nadwi counts more than 8000 based on the biographical dictionaries of the classical and medieval period.Mohammad Akram Nadwi, Al-Muhaddithat: The Women Scholars in Islam, (Oxford/London: Interface Publications, 2007). Many of these women belonged to the most outstanding scholars and traditionists of their time and men were proud to receive narration from them. One must also note that muhaddithat transmitted the same body of knowledge as their male counterparts ‚Äì there were and are no restrictions on what could be transmitted by women. Reporting or narrating (riwayah) must be differentiated from giving testimony (shahadah). While women are entirely equal in riwayah, many Islamic jurists place restrictions on women in shahadah ‚Äì thus in several schools of law the testimony of two women is equal to that of a man. A mu·∏•addith or \\"traditionist\\" is not the same as one of the Ahl al-Hadith or a \\"traditionalist\\", a member of a movement of hadith scholars who considered the Quran and authentic hadith to be the only authority in matters of law and creed. Sunni literature for hadith studies As in any Islamic discipline, there is a rich history of literature describing the principles and fine points of hadith studies. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani provides a summation of this development with the following: ‚ÄúWorks authored in the terminology of the people of hadith have become plentiful from the Imaams both old and contemporary: # From the first of those who authored a work on this subject is the Judge, Ab≈´ Mu·∏•ammad al-RƒÅmahurmuzƒ´ in his book, ‚Äòal-Muhaddith al-Faasil,‚Äô however, it was not comprehensive. # And al-Hakim, Abu Abd Allah an-Naysaburi, however, it was neither refined nor well arranged. # And following him, Abu Nu‚Äôaym al-Asbahani, who wrote a mustakhraj upon the book of the later, (compiling the same narrations al-Hakim cited using his own sanads.) However, some things remain in need of correction. # And then came al-Khatib Abu Bakr al-Bagdadi, authoring works in the various disciplines of hadith studies a book entitled al-Kifaayah and in its etiquettes a book entitled al-Jami‚Äô Li Adab ash-Sheikh wa as-Saami. Scarce is the discipline from the disciplines of the science of hadeeth that he has not written an individual book regarding, as al-Hafith Abu Bakr ibn Nuqtah said: 'Every objective person knows that the scholars of hadeeth coming after al-Khatib are indebted to his works.' After them came others, following al-Khatib, taking their share from this science.\\" # al-Qadi ‚ÄòEyaad compiled a concise book naming it al-Ilmaa‚Äô. # Abu Hafs al- Mayanajiy a work giving it the title Ma Laa yasu al-Muhaddith Jahluhu or That Which a Hadith Scholar is Not Allowed Ignorance Of. There are numerous examples of this which have gained popularity and were expanded upon seeking to make plentiful the knowledge relating to these books and others abridged making easy their understanding. # This was prior to the coming of the memorizer and jurist Taqiyy ad-Deen Aboo ‚ÄòAmrin ‚ÄòUthmaan ibn al-Salah ‚ÄòAbd ar- Rahmaan ash-Shahruzuuree, who settled in Damascus. He gathered, at the time he had become a teacher of hadith at the Ashrafiyyah school, his well known book, editing the various disciplines mentioned in it. He dictated it piecemeal and, as a result, did not succeed in providing it with an appropriate order. He occupied himself with the various works of al-Khatib, gathering his assorted studies, adding to them from other sources the essence of their benefits. So he combined in his book what had been spread throughout books other than it. It is due to this that people have focused their attention upon it, following its example. Innumerable are those who rendered his book into poetry, abridged it, sought to complete what had been left out of it or left out any extraneous information; as well as those who opposed him in some aspect of his work or supported him.Nuzhah Al-Nathr, pp. 45‚Äì51; published as al-Nukat, Dar Ibn al- Jawzi. I referred to the explanation of Ali al-Qari, Sharh Sharh Nukhbah al- Fikr, in particular segments of pp. 143‚Äì7 in some instances for clarity. The books mentioned above are all published in the original Arabic, with only Ibn al-Salah‚Äôs book, as far as I am aware, being translated into English.  Discussion of validity  The science of hadith has not been without critics. According to Muhammad Husayn Haykal, \\"despite the great care and precision of the Hadith scholars, much of what they regarded as true was later proved to we spurious.\\" He goes on to quote Al-Nawawi (1233‚Äì1277),Al Minhaj bi Sharh Sahih Muslim who stated that \\"a number of scholars discovered many hadiths\\" in the two most authentic hadith collection Sahih al-Bukhari and Sahih Muslim \\"which do not fulfill the conditions of verification assumed by these men\\" (i.e. by the hadith collectors Muhammad al-Bukhari and Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj). Among the criticisms made (of non-sahih as well as sahih hadith) of is that there was a suspiciously large growth in their number with each generation in the early years of Islam;Ibn Rawandi, \\"Origins of Islam\\", 2000: p.117 that large numbers of hadith contradicted each other; and that the genre's status as a primary source of Islamic law motivated the creation of fraudulent hadith. Modern Western scholars in particular have \\"seriously questioned the historicity and authenticity of the hadith\\", according to John Esposito, maintaining that \\"the bulk of traditions attributed to the Prophet Muhammad were actually written much later.\\" According to Esposito, Schacht \\"found no evidence of legal traditions before 722,\\" from which Schacht concluded that \\"the Sunna of the Prophet is not the words and deeds of the Prophet, but apocryphal material\\" dating from later. Henry Preserved Smith and Ign√°c Goldziher also challenged the reliability of the hadith, Smith stating that \\"forgery or invention of traditions began very early\\" and \\"many traditions, even if well authenticated to external appearance, bear internal evidence of forgery.\\" Goldziher writes that \\"European critics hold that only a very small part of the ·∏•adith can be regarded as an actual record of Islam during the time of Mohammed and his immediate followers.\\" In his Mohammedan Studies, Goldziher states: \\"it is not surprising that, among the hotly debated controversial issues of Islam, whether political or doctrinal, there is not one in which the champions of the various views are unable to cite a number of traditions, all equipped with imposing isnads\\". Patricia Crone noted that early traditionalists were still developing conventions of examining the chain of narration (isnads) that by later standards were sketchy/deficient, even though they were closer to the historical material. Later though they possessed impeccable chains, but were more likely to be fabricated.Patricia Crone, Roman, Provincial and Islamic Law (1987/2002 paperback) , pp. 23‚Äì34, paperback edition Reza Aslan quotes Schacht's maxim: \`the more perfect the isnad, the later the tradition\`, which he (Aslan) calls \\"whimsical but accurate\\".No God But God : The Origins, Evolution, and Future of Islam by Reza Aslan, (Random House, 2005) p.163 Bernard Lewis writes that \\"the creation of new hadiths designed to serve some political purpose has continued even to our own time.\\" In the buildup to the first Gulf War a \\"tradition\\" was published in the Palestinian daily newspaper Al-Nahar on December 15, 1990, \\"and described as \`currently in wide circulation\`\\" It \\"quotes the Prophet as predicting that \\"the Greeks and Franks will join with Egypt in the desert against a man named Sadim, and not one of them will return\\". Others have praised the tradition for its ingenuity: Sheikh Ahmad Kutty, a Senior Lecturer and an Islamic Scholar at the Islamic Institute of Toronto,islam.ca Ontario, Canada, clarifies what he feels supports the validity of hadith studies: :There is a basic distinction between Islam and other religions in this regard: Islam is singularly unique among the world religions in the fact that in order to preserve the sources of their religion, the Muslims invented a scientific methodology based on precise rules for gathering data and verifying them. As it has been said, 'Isnad or documentation is part of Islamic religion, and if it had not been for isnad, everybody would have said whatever he wanted.

Essays on Christology by Jack Dean Kingsbury, Mark Allan Powell, David R. Bauer 1999 page xvi In Christianity, the Confession of Peter (translated from the Matthean Vulgate Latin section title: Confessio Petri) refers to an episode in the New Testament in which the Apostle Peter proclaims Jesus to be the Christ (Jewish Messiah). The proclamation is described in the three Synoptic Gospels: Matthew 16:13-20, Mark 8:27‚Äì30 and Luke 9:18‚Äì20.The Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament by Robert J. Karris 1992 pages 885-886 Specifically, Peter declares, \\"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.\\" The proclamation of Jesus as Christ is fundamental to Christology; the Confession of Peter and Jesus' acceptance of the title \\"Messiah\\" form a definitive statement in the New Testament narrative regarding the person of Jesus Christ. In this New Testament narrative, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and Son of God, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter, unequivocally declaring himself to be both Christ and the Son of God. In the same passage Jesus also selects Peter as the leader of the Apostles, and states: \\"Upon this rock I will build my church.\\" Most Christian denominations agree that the statement applies to Peter, but they diverge on their interpretations of what happens after Peter. The Confession of Peter is also the name of a liturgical feastday celebrated by several Christian churches, often as part of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity.Pocket Dictionary of Liturgy & Worship by Brett Scott Provance 2009 page 59Exciting Holiness: Collects and Readings for the Festivals by B. Tristam Canterbury Press 2003 pages 54-55 Gospel accounts =Background and setting= In the New Testament, this pericope and the account of the Transfiguration of Jesus which follows it appear towards the middle of the Gospel narrative and jointly mark the beginnings of the gradual disclosure of the identity of Jesus to his disciples.The Christology of Mark's Gospel by Jack Dean Kingsbury 1983 pages 91-95The Cambridge Companion to the Gospels by Stephen C. Barton pages 132-133 The setting is near Caesarea Philippi in northern Judea and is at the beginning of the final journey to Jerusalem which ends in the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus. Peter's Confession begins as a dialogue between Jesus and his disciples in Matthew 16:13, Mark 8:27 and Luke 9:18. Jesus begins to ask about the current opinions about himself among \\"the multitudes\\", asking: \\"Who do the multitudes say that I am?\\" The disciples provide a variety of the common hypotheses at the time, ranging from John the Baptist to Elijah, Jeremiah,In Matthew's account only: or one of the (other) prophets. The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, following Jewish medieval rabbi David Kimhi and theologican John Lightfoot, suggests that Jeremiah \\"is mentioned as a representative of the Prophets, because in the Jewish Canon the book of Jeremiah came first of the Prophets, following the books of Kings.\\"Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Matthew 16; John Lightfoot's Commentary on the Gospels on Matthew 16 and on Matthew 27, all accessed 25 January 2017 Earlier in the Gospel narrative, these hypotheses about Jesus' identity were provided in Mark 6:14-16 by those in the court of Herod Antipas when he wondered if Jesus was John the Baptist restored to life.The Gospel of Mark, Volume 2 by John R. Donahue, Daniel J. Harrington 2002 page 336 =Proclamation and acceptance= In the three Gospel accounts, after asking about the views of \\"the multitudes\\", Jesus asks his disciples about their own opinion: \\"But who do you say that I am?\\" Only Simon Peter answers him: \\"You are the Christ, the Son of the living God\\".Christology and the New Testament by Christopher Mark Tuckett 2001 page 109 Only in Matthew 16:17 Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and later indicates this revelation is the foundational rock of the Church. This begins with: > Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jonah: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it > unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and Son of God which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter.One Teacher: Jesus' Teaching Role in Matthew's Gospel by John Yueh-Han Yieh 2004 pages 240-241 In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God. The reference to \\"my Father\\" is distinguished in that in the New Testament, Jesus never includes other individuals in such references and only refers to his Father, however when addressing the disciples he uses your Father, excluding himself from the reference.Jesus God and Man by Wolfhart Pannenberg 1968 pages 53-54 =Selection of Peter= Pietro Perugino's Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter, c. 1482 In Matthew 16:18 Jesus then continues: > And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will > build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I > will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. The word \\"Peter\\" in this verse is, in Greek, \\"petros\\", while this \\"rock\\" is \\"petra\\". It is a play on words, but if the original language was Aramaic the word in both cases is simply \\"kepha\\". A distinction that petros meant a stone and petra a solid piece of rocky ground is sometimes suggested, but Greek use in antiquity seems to have been less precise.Peter: Disciple, Apostle, Martyr by Oscar Cullman 2011 page 20 The word \\"church\\" (ekklesia in Greek), as used here, appears in the Gospels only once more, in Matthew 18:17, and refers to the community of believers at the time.The Gospel of Matthew by Rudolf Schnackenburg 2002 pages 7-9 The \\"gates of hell\\" (of Hades) refers to the underworld, and the abode of the dead, and refers to the powers opposed to God not being able to triumph over the church.The Gospel of Matthew (Sacra Pagina Series, Vol 1) by Dainel J. Harrington 1991 page 248 The keys of the kingdom of heaven refer to the metaphor of the Kingdom of Heaven being a \\"place to be entered\\" as also used in Matthew 23:13, where the entrance to it can be shut. Peter's authority is further confirmed by: \\"Whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\\" As discussed below, various Christian denominations have assigned different interpretations to the authority granted in this passage. All three of the Synoptic Gospels end the account with Jesus telling the disciples not to reveal that he was the Messiah to anyone ‚Äî an instance of the motif of the Messianic Secret. Denominational issues =Interpretations= Various Christian denominations interpret Matthew 16:18 in different ways. Although most denominations agree that the statement applies to Peter, they diverge on their interpretations of what happens after Peter.The People's New Testament Commentary by M. Eugene Boring, Fred B. Craddock 2004 page 69 In the Roman Catholic Church, Jesus' words \\"upon this rock I will build my church\\" are interpreted as the foundation of the doctrine of the papacy, whereby the Church of Christ is founded upon Peter and his successors, the Bishops of Rome.Upon this Rock: St. Peter and the Primacy of Rome in Scripture and the Early Church by Stephen K. Ray 1999 pages 11-15 Jesus' next statement, \\"and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.\\" are interpreted as the foundation of the doctrine of papal infallibility.Papal infallibility: A Protestant Evaluation of an Ecumenical Issue by Mark E. Powell 2009 pages 35-40 Some Protestants believe that the verse states that Peter was the foundation stone of the Church, but do not accept that it applies to the continuous succession of popes, as the Bishops of Rome. The statement \\"and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it\\" is usually taken to mean that the Church will never become extinct. Some Protestant evangelical groups adhere to the interpretation that it is Peter's \\"confession\\" itself that is \\"the rock on which will be built the Church of Jesus\\", i.e., the church will be built on Jesus alone as the foundation stone of his church. This interpretation usually uses the argument of the difference between petros and petra in Greek (\\"You are Peter [petros] and on this rock [petra] I will build my church.\\") The Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches see Jesus' words \\"whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven\\" as bestowing first upon Peter what was later bestowed upon all of the Apostles collectively. The Orthodox believe in the infallibility of the Church as a whole, but that any individual, regardless of their position, can be subject to error. Ecumenical meetings among different denominations have taken place regarding these interpretations, but no final agreement has emerged. =Commemorations= Plaque at Nantes Cathedral: \\"Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church.\\" The Roman Catholic Church celebrates the Feast of the Chair of St. Peter on 22 February in the General Roman Calendar. In the General Roman Calendar of 1960, the feast is celebrated on 18 January. Some Anglican and Lutheran churches celebrate the Feast of the Confession of St. Peter on 18 January. The Confession of Peter is the beginning of the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, actually an octave rather than a week, and was originally known as the Octave of Christian Unity. It is an international Christian ecumenical observance that began in 1908. It spans from 18 January to 25 January (the Feast of the Conversion of Saint Paul).

Mathers' family emigrated to Australia while he was a child. He attended state school in Sydney, and later Sydney Technical College, where he studied agriculture. He \\"farmed, clerked, woolled, gardened, landscaped, chemicalled\\", and did other things before settling into his writing career. In 1961 he married and went to France to live in a cork oak forest. His two daughters were born in London. From 1964 he worked in Britain and Europe as a researcher. His first writing appeared in the early 1960s, and in 1967 he took up a writing fellowship in the United States. He returned to Australia in 1968. In 1966 Mathers completed his first novel, Trap, an inventive and often comic novel concerning the escapades and family history of Jack Trap, an urban mixed-blood Aboriginal person in what was then a society racially divided by the White Australia Policy.\\"Jack Trap is an awe- inspiring mixture of Irish, English, Aborigine, and even Tierra del Fuegan. But he looks Aboriginal.Admired by a few, hated by many, he is needed by more than care to admit it. Trap affects everyone. He is a shifting product of the back streets, passively resisting poverty and racialism, occasionally indulging in bursts of aggression. Peter Mathers knows Trap, as he knows his background. Out of Trap he has fashioned Trap the symbol - around which lurk a variety of characters who represent the different aspects of an oppressive society. There are entertaining tales of his unlikely forebears; his father Wilson, who was unlucky enough to look white; his grandmother from South America; and his cedar-cutting grandfather, Armstrong Irish Trap. Peter Mathers deals gently with the underdog, reserving his most vitriolic satire for the affluent conformists. His original style and humour make Trap a biting, very funny novel.\\" (From the dustjacket of the first edition) It won the Miles Franklin Literary Award, His second novel, The Wort Papers (1972), ranged across the country in rural settings from the Kimberley to dairy country in northern New South Wales, and further established his reputation as a stylistic innovator and satirist.From a commentary published on goodreads.com: \\"Difficult can be good. Enormous fun. A uniquely Australian book about mid-20th century rural life and big business. Full of politics and satire and comic, romping scenarios and literary fireworks. This is one of the funniest novels written, anywhere; inventive, clever, witty, ribald, experimental ... it has many strengths but I recall talking to the author in 1997 and he indicated he wanted to re-edit it; he told me the book was produced in a hurry amid a corporate sell-out, and has never received adequate attention in editing.\\" Mathers wrote radio plays, articles and published many stories in magazines, journals and newspapers before beginning a substantial playwriting career, which includedPelaco Hill, Bats, The Mountain King and The Real McCoy. Some short stories were collected as A Change For the Better. He lived in Melbourne for many years prior to his death in 2004 from pancreatic cancer.

Named after the village of Ballintra in County Donegal, Ireland, the community is centred on the intersection of Aurora Road (York Regional Road 15) and Highway 48. The hamlet was first settled in the early nineteenth century, and by 1895 it had a population of 300.Cf. a thorough account of Ballantrae's history in Jean Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township (Erin, ON: Boston Mills, 1993), 87-90. See also the detailed 1878 map, Township of Whitchurch, Illustrated historical atlas of the county of York and the township of West Gwillimbury & town of Bradford in the county of Simcoe, Ont. (Toronto: Miles & Co., 1878). The settlement was located on the edge of a vast lumber industry centred in the hamlet of Vivian; a spur-line of the Toronto and Nipissing Railway built in 1877 ran through Ballantrae from Stouffville to Jackson's Point on Lake Simcoe. In the early twentieth century, Ballantrae's population declined dramatically. Large-scale deforestation and erosion of the thin soil of northern Whitchurch Township created virtual sand deserts.Barkey et al., Whitchurch Township, 89; 30f. In 1910, its population was 250; cf. Province of Ontario, Gazetteer and Directory, 1910-1911 (Ingersoll: Union, 1910), 46. With the passage of the Reforestation Act (1911), the process of reclaiming these areas slowly began. The Vivian Forest, a large conservation area on the edge of Ballantrae, was established in 1924 for this purpose. Ballantrae experienced 300% growth between 2001 and 2006 to 1,278 people, and 8% growth between 2006 and 2011 with a total population of 1,382 people.; H.

The use of it in Middle Eastern countries' mosques was carried on to most Islamic countries' mosque architecture. Traditional mosque are surrounded by the riwaq arcade on all sides. They also contain fountain water basins, such as a howz, for ritual purification cleansing and performing of wudu (Islamic ablutions), and flowing fountains for drinking water. The inner courtyard is not a religiously proscribed architectural feature, and some mosques, especially since the twentieth century, do not have a sahn. =Residential design= Mandu, India Residential , part of a courtyard house, are the most private. The scale and design details differ: from urban to rural locales; different regions and climates, and different eras and cultures ‚Äì but the basic function of security and privacy remain the same. The sahn can be a private garden, a service yard, and a summer season outdoor living room for the family or entertaining. Usually the main entrance of the house does not lead directly to the sahn. It is reached through a broken or curved corridor called a majaz (, '). This lets residents admit guests into the majlis (, '), a salon or reception room, without seeing into the sahn. It is then a protected and proscribed place where the women of the house need not be covered in the hijab clothing traditionally necessary in public. In urban settings, the sahn is usually surrounded by a colonnaded riwaq, and has a howz, or pool of water, in the middle. The residence's iwan, a private family room veranda of three walls, usually overlooks the sahn and gives direct or stairway access to it. Upper floor rooms may also view it through mashrabiyas, wooden lattice covered windows. The Moorish patios of al-Andalus, in present- day Spain, include World Heritage Sites such as the Court of the Lions and Court of the Myrtles at the Alhambra palace. =Urban design= ;Private Traditional Islamic neighborhoods can have a dedicated central open space, a communally private sahn, called saha (, '), only for the neighbourhood's residents, usually consisting of members of the same tribe. ;Public The idea of public open space, central in the middle of a city, a town square or central plaza, is part of historical and contemporary urban design in many cultures around the world. Ancient examples are the Greek agora and Roman forum. They can provide a place for various civic uses such as public gatherings, celebrations, and protests, open air markets and festivals, and transportation links.

The specific epithet insignis is Latin for \\"distinguished\\" or \\"remarkable\\". Botanical history The first known collection of N. insignis was made by August Adriaan Pulle on November 9, 1912. The specimen, Pulle 277, was collected in southwestern New Guinea at the \\"[b]order of the Beaufort River\\" at an altitude of 80 m. It includes male floral material and is deposited at the Bogor Botanical Gardens (formerly the Herbarium of the Buitenzorg Botanic Gardens) in Java. It is also preserved in alcohol and is sheet 201110 at the National Herbarium of the Netherlands in Leiden. Nepenthes insignis was collected again in September 1926, by Willem Marius Docters van Leeuwen. The specimens, Docters van Leeuwen 10258 and 10286, were collected in northwestern New Guinea at the \\"[b]order of affluent C of the Rouffaer River\\" at an altitude of 250 m. They are also deposited at the Bogor Botanical Gardens, although they do not include floral material. B. H. Danser formally described N. insignis in his seminal monograph \\"The Nepenthaceae of the Netherlands Indies\\", published in 1928. The description was based solely on herbarium material and Danser did not see the species in its natural habitat. Danser designated Pulle 277 as the type specimen. Two further collections of N. insignis were made by Leonard John Brass in March 1939, 4 km south west of Bernhard Camp, Idenburg River (sheet 13379) and 8 km south west of Bernhard Camp (sheet 13669). Both are deposited at the Bogor Botanical Gardens. It appears that N. insignis was knowingly observed in the wild only in 1994 by four members of a field trip to New Guinea: W. Baumgartl, B. Kistler, H. Rischer, and A. Wistuba. A report on the group's findings was published in the Carnivorous Plant Newsletter the following year. Description Nepenthes insignis is a weak climber. The stem is usually around 50 to 80 cm long and up to 7 mm in diameter. Internodes are triangular in cross section and up to 9 cm long. Leaves are coriaceous and sessile. The lamina is linear-lanceolate or slightly spathulate and up to 35 cm long and 6 cm wide. It has an acute apex and is gradually attenuate towards the base. Four to six longitudinal veins are present on either side of the midrib. Pinnate veins run obliquely towards the margin and are indistinct in the outer part of the lamina. Tendrils are up to 6 mm in diameter and may or may not have a curl. Rosette and lower pitchers are ovate or narrowly ovate in the lower half and cylindrical above. They can be very large, reaching 35 cm in height. Terrestrial pitchers usually lack fringed wings, having a pair of ribs instead. The insertion of the pitcher mouth is slightly oblique. The flattened peristome bears ribs spaced 0.5 to 1 mm apart. Its inner margin is lined with small teeth up to 1 mm long. It is not elongated into a neck. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 43% of its total cross-sectional surface length.Bauer, U., C.J. Clemente, T. Renner & W. Federle 2012. Form follows function: morphological diversification and alternative trapping strategies in carnivorous Nepenthes pitcher plants. Journal of Evolutionary Biology 25(1): 90‚Äì102. The inner surface of the pitcher is glandular in its lower half. Digestive glands are present at a density of 150 to 1500 per square centimetre. The waxy zone is reduced. The pitcher lid is orbiculate to broad cordate, bears a distinct midline, and may be up to 8 cm long. Numerous large glands are present on the underside of the lid, concentrated near the two main lateral veins.Nerz, J., P. Mann, T. Alt & T. Smith 1998. Nepenthes sibuyanensis, a new Nepenthes from Sibuyan, a remote island of the Philippines. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 27(1): 18‚Äì23. An unbranched filiform spur (‚â§5 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. Upper pitchers gradually arise from the ends of the tendrils, forming a 5 to 35 mm wide curve. They are infundibulate in the lower part and cylindrical above. They are up to 30 cm high and 8 cm wide. They may have very short wings (‚â§3 cm long) below the peristome. The pitcher mouth is oblique and acute or acuminate towards the lid. The expanded peristome is up to 35 mm wide and bears ribs spaced 0.5 to 1 mm apart. Its inner margin is lined with teeth which are about as long as they are wide. The inner surface of the pitcher is almost wholly glandular. The very small, overarched digestive glands occur at a density of 400 to 3000 per square centimetre. The pitcher lid is orbicular-ovate and up to 7.5 cm long. It bears a distinct midline and two distinct lateral veins. A number of large suborbicular glands are concentrated around these veins. A filiform spur (‚â§5 mm long) is inserted near the base of the lid. An infructescence Nepenthes insignis has a racemose inflorescence. The peduncle is up to 18 cm long and 7 mm in diameter. The rachis is attenuate, angular in cross section, and up to 46 cm long. Pedicels are two-flowered and lack bracts. They may be up to 22 mm long. The oblong tepals are approximately 4 mm long. Stamens are around 5 mm long including the anthers. Most parts of the plant are virtually glabrous. Developing pitchers have a sparse indumentum of short stellate hairs. Developing inflorescences are very densely hairy, becoming less hairy when mature. Pedicels and tepals are densely and shortly hairy. Stamens are more densely hairy near the base than near the anthers. The stem and lamina are green. Lower pitchers are usually dark green with red blotches concentrated near the peristome, which is dark reddish brown. Upper pitchers are yellowish green with fewer blotches. Herbarium specimens are greenish or yellowish to light brown in colour. Faint red spots are visible on the outside surface of preserved pitchers. In dried specimens, the non- glandular portion of the inner surface is bluish and pruinose and may or may not be spotted. Ecology Rosette plants growing in moss Nepenthes insignis is endemic to Western New Guinea and a number of nearby islands in Cenderawasih Bay. It has an altitudinal distribution of 0‚Äì850 m above sea level.McPherson, S.R. 2009. Pitcher Plants of the Old World. 2 volumes. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole.McPherson, S.R. & A. Robinson 2012. Field Guide to the Pitcher Plants of Australia and New Guinea. Redfern Natural History Productions, Poole. In the southern part of the Lakes Plain region of New Guinea it has been recorded from elevations of between 115 and 800 m. A smaller form of this species is also found near sea-level on the island of Biak.Mey, F.S. 2013. Nepenthes insignis from mainland Papua. Strange Fruits: A Garden's Chronicle, November 3, 2013. Nepenthes insignis occurs in dense forest and on foothills. Plants usually grow epiphytically in thick layers of moss, especially in trees overhanging rivers. At higher altitudes, the species has also been recorded from sediment bars along rivers.Jebb, M.H.P. & M.R. Cheek 1997. A skeletal revision of Nepenthes (Nepenthaceae). Blumea 42(1): 1‚Äì106.Jebb, M.H.P. 1991. An account of Nepenthes in New Guinea. Science in New Guinea 17(1): 7‚Äì54. Relative humidity is always high in these habitats; the seeds of one plant which grew near a small waterfall were found to have germinated while still in their capsules. In its natural habitat, N. insignis occurs sympatrically with N. ampullaria, N. maxima (above 400 m altitude), N. mirabilis, and plants tentatively identified as N. papuana that grow at 575 m altitude. One natural hybrid with N. mirabilis has been recorded.Rischer, H. 1995. Carnivorous Plant Newsletter 24(3): 75‚Äì77. Nepenthes insignis is listed as Least concern on the IUCN Red List. Carnivory The prey of N. insignis appears to consist almost solely of big-winged cockroaches. It has been suggested that these nocturnal insects are attracted by odour produced by the plant. Nepenthes insignis has been used in a study concerning the carnivory of Nepenthes and their production of the allelochemical plumbagin. It was shown that L-alanine fed in vitro to the pitchers of N. insignis is used to build up plumbagin, but is not incorporated into rossoliside and plumbaside A. The results suggest that these compounds are used for storage and have very low turnover rates.Rischer, H., A. Hamm & G. Bringmann 2002. Nepenthes insignis uses a C2-portion of the carbon skeleton of L-alanine acquired via its carnivorous organs, to build up the allelochemical plumbagin. Phytochemistry 59(6): 603‚Äì609. Related species B. H. Danser suggested that N. insignis is related to N. merrilliana from the Philippines. He placed both species in the Insignes clade, the members of which are characterised by coarse stems, large leaves, sparse indumentums, sessile leaves, and lids without appendages. Nepenthes insignis has also been compared to N. sibuyanensis, another Philippine endemic. It can be distinguished from that species on the basis of a number of morphological features. The former produces two-flowered pedicels, whereas those of N. sibuyanensis are one- flowered. The pitcher mouth of N. insignis is oblique, compared to almost horizontal in the latter. In addition, the peristome of N. sibuyanensis forms a short neck, while N. insignis lacks a neck completely. Furthermore, N. insignis has shorter peristome teeth than N. sibuyanensis (1 mm versus 5 mm). The pitchers of N. sibuyanensis also differ in shape, being ovate or slightly infundibulate. Natural hybrids A putative hybrid between N. insignis and N. mirabilis was found by members of the 1994 field trip to New Guinea. The plant was growing at an altitude of around 500 m. In Papua, N. insignis is commonly sympatric with N. ampullaria and N. maxima, and hybrids involving these species may also occur, although none have been recorded to date. Notes :a.The original Latin description of N. insignis reads: > Folia mediocria sessilia, lamina lineari-lanceolata, nervis longitudinalibus > utrinque 4-6, basi in alas 2 decurrente, vagina 0 ; ascidia rosularum ignota > ; ascidia caulum breviorum magnitudine mediocria v. maiora, parte inferiore > ovata, os versus cylindrica, exalata, costis 2 prominentibus ; peristomio > operculum versus acuto, expanso, 2-12 mm lato, costis l/2-3/4 mm > distantibus, dentibus minus longis quam latis ; operculo rotundato-ovato, > facie inferiore plano ; ascidia superiora magna, e basi lata > infundibuliformi subcylindrica v. leviter infundibuliformia, costis 2 > prominentibus, peristomio operculum versus acuto v. acuminato, expanso, 8-35 > mm lato, costis 1/2-1 mm distantibus, dentibus c. tam longis quam latis ; > operculo rotundato-cordato, facie inferiore plano v. plica subcarinato ; > inflorescentia racemus longus pedicellis inferioribus c. 20 mm longis > omnibus 2-floris ; indumentum in partibus vegetativis subnullum, in > inflorescentiis densum adpressum, e pilis stellatis compositum.

In Scouting for Boys, Baden-Powell wrote: > We aim for the practice of Christianity in their everyday life and dealings, > and not merely the profession of theology on Sundays‚Ä¶Scouting for Boys, > Baden-Powell, Oxford University Press. Baden-Powell believed that Scouting should be independent of any single faith or religion, but still held that spirituality and a belief in a higher power are key to the development of young people. Boy Scouts of America The Boy Scouts of America use many Scout Prayers. =The Scout Law Prayer= (This prayer is designed to demonstrate the Scout Law.) Dear Lord, Bless all those everywhere who contribute to shape the hearts, minds and bodies of young people. Let us remember what they have taught and apply it daily. When facing deceit and dishonesty, let us be Trustworthy. If we see hypocrisy and faithlessness, let us be Loyal. Where disregard of others and mere materialism prevail, let us be Helpful. When we find people in despair, let us be Friendly. In an atmosphere of ill manner, let us be Courteous. Where some measure manliness in brutality and crudeness, let us be Kind. Though lawbreaking and rule-scoffing are common, let us be Obedient. While others grumble and grouch, let us be Cheerful. In an environment blighted by waste and extravagance, let us be Thrifty. When confronted with danger and temptation, let us be Brave. As we see filth and pollution everywhere, let us be Clean. While witnessing impiety, let us remember to be Reverent. In short, in a world that has for generation after generation lamented the lack of good examples, let us, as Scouts, stand out, grow up, and become real adults. Amen. =Cub Scouts= Several Cub Scout prayers are used in the United States of America. =Northern Tier Grace= For food, for raiment, For life and opportunity, For sun and rain, For water and portage trails, For friendship and fellowship, We thank Thee, Oh Lord.

Dulwich Park is a public parkSouthwark Open Space Strategy 2013 (7.26 MB PDF) page 99 in Dulwich in the London Borough of Southwark, south London, England. The park was created by the Metropolitan Board of Works from former farmland and meadows. While the initial design was by Charles Barry (junior), it was later refined by Lt Col J. J. Sexby (who also designed Battersea and parts of Southwark Parks). It was opened in 1890 by Lord Rosebery. In 2004‚Äì6, the park was restored to its original Victorian layout, following a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The park is listed Grade II on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. Dulwich Park contains a caf√©, boating lake and numerous sporting facilities. Various types of recumbent bicycles are available for hire. Cars have not been permitted to drive inside the park since 2003, with the exception of disabled badge holders, but there is a free car park at the College Road entrance. Architecture The gates and lodges surrounding the park are listed Grade II on the National Heritage List; these include the park lodges next to the Old College and Roseberry gates, and the Queen Mary, Court Lane, Roseberry, and Old College gates and their attached railings. On 20 December 2011, a sculpture by Barbara Hepworth, Two Forms (Divided Circle) that resides in the park, was cut from its plinth and stolen by suspected scrap metal thieves. Sport It is home of Dulwich Park Runners, a minor running club. A Parkrun takes place each Saturday. There is an active bowling club that operates every summer from April until September. Bowling has operated on the green in the middle of the park since 1900.

(1931). The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Volume 21. New York: James T. White Company. pp. 376‚Äì377. was an English American physician and health writer. Hutchinson promoted the consumption of red meat and white bread and was strongly opposed to the ideas of vegetarianism.Warren, Wilson J. (2018). Meat Makes People Powerful: A Global History of the Modern Era. University of Iowa Press. pp. 61‚Äì64. Whorton, James C. (2016). Crusaders for Fitness: The History of American Health Reformers. Princeton University Press. p. 208. Biography Hutchinson was born at Selby, Yorkshire, England. He graduated from Penn College, Oskaloosa, Iowa in 1880, and received his medical degree from the University of Michigan four years later. He worked as a professor of anatomy at the State University of Iowa between 1891 and 1896 and then became a professor of comparative pathology at the University of Buffalo until 1900. While at Buffalo, he also edited The Polyclinic and lectured at the London Medical Graduates' College and the University of London, starting in 1899. Besides The Polyclinic, he edited Vis Medicatrix early in his career, (from 1890 to 1891). In 1903, he became the Oregon State Health Officer; he held that post for two years. Following the post in Oregon, he became a professor of clinical medicine at the New York Polyclinic. Dieting Hutchinson supported a form of eugenics that espoused the importance of animal protein in the human diet. He has been described as \\"one of the most popular advocates for the importance of meat in human diets during the era.\\" Hutchinson's dietary advice was heavily connected to his advocacy of eugenics. He believed that vegetarianism was uncivilized and made the population weak. In his book Instinct and Health he wrote that \\"it may be stated that vegetarianism is the diet of the enslaved, stagnant, and conquered races, and a diet rich in meat is that of the progressive, the dominant, and the conquering strains.\\" Hutchinson was highly critical of vegetarianism and the low-protein diet ideas of John Harvey Kellogg and Russell Henry Chittenden. He argued that proteins are the \\"most necessary foods\\". Hutchinson downplayed the importance of fruits and vegetables in the diet. He also opposed the consumption of breakfast cereals, which he believed lacked in food value. He disliked brown bread, especially Graham bread because he believed they were less nourishing than white bread and irritable to the bowels. He stated that breakfast should include bacon and eggs.Agnew, Jeremy. (2019). Healing Waters: A History of Victorian Spas. McFarland. p. 47. He recommended for health the consumption of large quantities of barely cooked beef.Kimmel, Michael S. (2005). History of Men, The: Essays on the History of American and British Masculinities. State University of New York Press. p. 54. Hutchinson defended adipose tissue against the viewpoint that it was a health risk.Fraser, Laura. The Inner Corset: A Brief History of Fat in the United States. In Esther D. Rothblum, Sondra Solovay. (2009). The Fat Studies Reader. New York University Press. pp. 11‚Äì12. He commented that adipose \\"is really a most harmless, healthful, innocent tissue.\\" He argued against fashion and trends in which young women wanted to be thin and wrote that \\"the long-for slender and boyish figure is becoming a menace.\\" Hutchinson was attacked by vegetarians. For example, Kellogg's Good Health journal described Hutchinson as a \\"beef drunkard and propagandist of the most pronounced type.\\" Selected publications * The Gospel According to Darwin (1898) * The Cancer Problem (1900) * Studies in Human and Comparative Pathology (1901) * Instinct and Health (1908) * Fat and Its Follies (1909) * Preventable Diseases (1909) * Conquest of Consumption (1910) * Exercise and Health (1911) * The Child's Day (1912) * Common Diseases (1913) * Civilization and Health (1914) * The Doctor In War (1918) *A Handbook of Health (1922) References Further reading *Anonymous.

Its four hosts, Curio (Drew Jarvis), Nitro (Beau Walker), Picasso (Kendal Nagorcka) and Eco (Jacqueline Duncan) answered viewer questions, queries, dares and challenges in an entertaining and educational manner. Each host's name relates to their personality and the type of stories they present. Viewers sent questions and suggestions to the presenters via the shows website. Production The series was filmed, for the main part, at a studio resembling a large shed or shack, hence the name, it decorated with all manner of objects. The presenters arrived via a prop of a wave, and exited through a door on the other side of the shack. They were known as 'Shaksters', as were the viewers. Other filming was done at various attractions and locations on the Gold Coast where the Shak was set, with Dreamworld being a regular filming spot. In 2006, the filming was done at Sea World but in early 2007, filming was moved to the WhiteWater World theme park. This was explained via an explosion made by Curio, which resulted in the Shaksters moving. and the opening titles were fully animated however in 2007 it was changed to a mix of live action and animation.  Ending  The show ended in mid-2008 so it could make way for the Sequel The Shak at Home which had Curio, Nitro and Picasso living in a share house.

When his father developed health problems, Koplow became a pharmacy technician at his father's store, Broadway Pharmacy. After graduating from Swampscott High School, he was accepted at both MIT and the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, and opted for the latter because he hadn't received a scholarship at MIT. He married in 1962 after graduating from pharmacy school. He then enrolled at Tufts University for a graduate degree in Physics. He briefly worked as a school teacher before joining Wang Laboratories, where he programmed calculators. One of his programs permitted a Wang calculator to interface with an IBM Selectric typewriter, which could be used to calculate and print the paperwork for auto sales. Koplow's interface program was developed, in 1974, into the Wang 1200 Word Processor, an IBM Selectric-based text-storage device. The operator of this machine typed text on a conventional IBM typewriter; when the Return key was pressed, the line of text was stored on a cassette tape. One cassette held roughly 20 pages of text, and could be \\"played back\\" (e.g., the text retrieved) by printing the contents on continuous-form paper in the 1200 typewriter's \\"print\\" mode. The stored text could also be edited, using keys on a simple, six-key array. Basic editing functions included Insert, Delete, Skip (character, line), and so on. The labor and cost savings of this device were immediate, and remarkable: pages of text no longer had to be retyped to correct simple errors, and projects could be worked on, stored, and then retrieved for use later on. The rudimentary Wang 1200 machine was the precursor of the Wang Office Information System (OIS), which revolutionized the way typing projects were performed in the American workplace. When Wang acquired Philip Hankins, Inc. (PHI), Koplow met Dave Moros, with whom he would later collaborate to create the Wang Word Processing System. This and other office automation products that were created in Koplow's department were among the most successful products in Wang's history. Koplow left Wang in 1982 because of conflicts with Fred Wang. He lived briefly in California before moving to Gainesville, Florida where he lived until he died in 2004.

Like other members of Bryophyllum (now included in the genus Kalanchoe), it can propagate vegetatively from plantlets that develop on its leaf margins. All parts of this species contain a very toxic steroid known as daigremontianin. It is often confused with K. laetivirens, K. delagoensis and K. √ó houghtonii. The leaves of K. laetivirens are completely green, while K. daigremontiana has bands or spots on the back of leaves. The leaves of K. delagoensis are linear, while K. daigremontiana has lanceolate, oblong, ovate or triangular leaves. K. √ó houghtonii is a hybrid between K. daigremontiana and K. delagoensis, therefore has characteristics in between; its leaves are narrower than those of K. daigremontiana, and its leaf base is attenuate, cuneate to weakly cordate or auriculate, while K. daigremontiana has strongly cordate to auriculate or even peltate leaves.  Morphology  Plants grow up to 1 m (3 ft 3 in) tall and have opposite and whorled, fleshy oblong-lanceolate leaves which grow up to 20 cm (6-8 inches) long and 3.2 cm (1.25 inches) wide. They are green above and blotched with purple underneath. Leaf margins have spoon-shaped bulbiliferous spurs which bear plantlets which may form roots while still attached to leaves. A plant may also develop lateral roots on its main stalk, as high up as 10‚Äì15 cm above the ground. A plant's upper leaves may grow large, causing its main stalk to bend downward. Then the lateral roots may enter soil and new vertical shoots may grow from the original shoot. Kalanchoe daigremontiana can spread by both seeds and by plantlets dropped from its leaves. K. daigremontiana has an umbrella-like terminal inflorescence (a compound cyme) of small bell-shaped, grayish pink (or sometimes orange) flowers. Flowering is, however, not an annual event and occurs sporadically if at all on some shoots. Particularly in climates with distinct seasonal temperature differences, flowering is most frequently observed at the beginning of a warm season. Indoor plants, as well as balcony plants which have been moved inside to survive the cold season, begin flowering in early winter. As a succulent plant, K. daigremontiana can survive prolonged periods of drought with little or no water. During growth periods with higher temperatures and increased water supply, this species requires proper nutrition, without which leaves show deficiency symptoms such as crippled growth and pustule-like lesions. The plant is not frost-hardy and typically dies in places where temperatures are below freezing.  Physiology  Plants of the genus Kalanchoe as well as many other plants growing in arid regions photosynthesize via Crassulacean acid metabolism.  Distribution  K. daigremontiana is native to the Fiherenana River valley and Androhibolava mountains in southwest Madagascar. It has been introduced to numerous tropical and subtropical regions, such as Florida, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, and parts of southern Europe. = Habitat = Kalanchoe daigremontiana prefers to grow in rocky and dry places. It can become an invasive plant and threaten natural ecosystems, especially in arid and semi-arid environments (South Africa and regions of South America for example), where it can inhibit native-plant recruitment.  Medicine  The plant is used for many medicinal applications. It can be used against premature contractions where side effects are little. There are already commercial drugs produced from the compounds of the plant.W√§chter, R. (2011).

According to British scientist, historian and sinologist Joseph Needham, the dimensions of the largest of these ships were by . Historians such as Edward L. Dreyer are in broad agreement with Needham's views. However, other Western historians have expressed doubts over the size and dimensions of the treasure ships. Xin Yuan'ou, a shipbuilding engineer and professor of the history of science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, argues that it is highly unlikely that Zheng He‚Äôs treasure ships were 450 ft long, and suggests that they were probably closer to 200‚Äì250 ft (61‚Äì76 m) in length.Church (2005). p. 1-2. Accounts Ships of the Fra Mauro map (1460). Chinese woodblock print, thought to represent Zheng He's ships =Chinese= According to the ' (1658), the first voyage consisted of 63 treasure ships crewed by 27,870 men. The History of Ming (1739) credits the first voyage with 62 treasure ships crewed by 27,800 men. A Zheng He era inscription in the Jinghai Temple in Nanjing gave the size of Zheng He ships in 1405 as 2,000 liao (500 tons), but did not give the number of ships. Alongside the treasures were also another 255 ships according to the ' (1520), giving the combined fleet of the first voyage a total of 317 ships. However, the addition of 255 ships is a case of double accounting according to Edward L. Dreyer, who notes that the Taizong Shilu does not distinguish the order of 250 ships from the treasure ships. As such the first fleet would have been around 250 ships including the treasure ships. The second voyage consisted of 249 ships. The Jinghai Temple inscription gave the ship dimensions in 1409 as 1500 liao (375 tons). According to the Xingcha Shenglan (1436), the third voyage consisted of 48 treasure ships, not including other ships. The Xingcha Shenglan states that the fourth voyage consisted of 63 treasure ships crewed by 27,670 men. There are no sources for number of ships or men for the fifth and sixth voyages. According to the Liujiagang and Changle Inscriptions, the seventh voyage had \\"more than a hundred large ships\\". =Yemen= The most contemporary non- Chinese record of the expeditions is an untitled and anonymous annalistic account of the then-ruling Ras≈´lid dynasty of Yemen, compiled in the years 1439-1440. It reports the arrival of Chinese ships in 1419, 1423, and 1432, which approximately correspond to Zheng He's fifth, sixth, and seventh voyages. The 1419 arrival is described thus: The later Yemeni historian, Ibn al-Dayba ø (1461-1537), writes: =Mamluks= Mamluk historian Ibn Taghribirdi (1411-1470) writes: = Niccol√≤ de' Conti = Niccol√≤ de' Conti ( 1395‚Äì1469), a contemporary of Zheng He, was also an eyewitness of Chinese ships in Southeast Asia, claiming to have seen five-masted junks of about 2000 tons* burthen: * Other translations of the passage give the size as a 2000 butts, which would be around a 1000 tons, a butt being half a ton.  Other accounts  Although active prior to the treasure voyages, both Marco Polo (1254‚Äì1325) and Ibn Battuta (1304‚Äì1369) attest to large multi-masted ships carrying 500 to 1000 passengers in Chinese waters. = Marco Polo = = Ibn Battuta = Description A stationary full-size model of a \\"middle-sized\\" treasure ship (63.25 m long) at the Treasure Ship Shipyard site in Nanjing. It was built c. 2005 from concrete and wooden planking Inside the display ship in Nanjing =Taizong Shilu= The most contemporary accounts of the treasure ships come from the Taizong Shilu, which contains 24 notices from 1403 to 1419 for the construction of ships at several locations. On 4 September 1403, 200 \\"seagoing transport ships\\" were ordered from the Capital Guards in Nanjing. On 1 March 1404, 50 \\"seagoing ships\\" were ordered from the Capital Guards. In 1407, 249 vessels were ordered \\"to be prepared for embassies to the several countries of the Western Ocean\\". On 14 February 1408, 48 treasure ships were ordered from the Ministry of Works in Nanjing. This is the only contemporary account containing references to both treasure ships and a specific place of construction. Coincidentally, the only physical evidence of treasure ships comes from Nanjing. On 2 October 1419, 41 treasure ships were ordered without disclosing the specific builders involved. =Longjiang Chuanchang Zhi= 's Longjiang Chuanchang Zhi (1553), also known as the Record of the Dragon River Shipyard, notes that the plans for the treasure ships had vanished from the ship yard in which they were built. =Sanbao Taijian Xia Xiyang Ji Tongsu Yanyi= According to 's novel Sanbao Taijian Xia Xiyang Ji Tongsu Yanyi (1597), the treasure fleet consisted of several distinct classes of ships: *\\"Treasure ships\\" (, B«éo Chu√°n) nine-masted, 44.4 by 18 zhang, about long and wide. * Equine ships (, M«é Chu√°n), carrying horses and tribute goods and repair material for the fleet, eight-masted, 37 by 15 zhang, about long and wide. * Supply ships (, Li√°ng Chu√°n), containing staple for the crew, seven- masted, 18 by 12 zhang, about long and wide. * Troop transports (, Bƒ´ng Chu√°n), six-masted, 24 by 9.4 zhang, about long and wide. * Fuchuan warships (, F√∫ Chu√°n), five-masted, 18 by 6.8 zhang, about long. * Patrol boats (, Zu√≤ Chu√°n), eight-oared, about long. * Water tankers (, Shu«ê Chu√°n), with 1 month's supply of fresh water. Edward L. Dreyer claims that Luo Maodeng's novel is unsuitable as historical evidence. The novel contains a number of fantasy element; for example the ships were \\"constructed with divine help by the immortal Lu Ban\\". =History of Ming= A large tiller discovered at the Treasure Boat Shipyard in 2004. An old anchor discovered at the Treasure Boat Shipyard in 2004. Dimensions and size According to the History of Ming (Ming shi - ÊòéÂè≤), completed in 1739, the treasure ships were 44 zhang, 4 chi, i.e. 444 chi in length, and had a beam of 18 zhang. The dimensions of ships are no coincidence. The number \\"4\\" has numerological significance as a symbol of the 4 cardinal directions, 4 seasons, and 4 virtues. The number 4 was an auspicious association for treasure ships. These dimensions first appeared in a novel published in 1597, more than a century and a half after Zheng He's voyages. The 3 contemporary accounts of Zheng He's voyages do not have the ship dimensions. The zhang was fixed at 141 inches in the 19th century, making the chi 14.1 inches. However the common Ming value for chi was 12.2 inches and the value fluctuated depending on region. The Ministry of Works used a chi of 12.1 inches while the Jiangsu builders used a chi of 13.3 inches. Some of the ships in the treasure fleet, but not the treasure ships, were built in Fujian, where the chi was 10.4 to 11 inches. Assuming a range of 10.5 to 12 inches for each chi, the dimensions of the treasure ships as recorded by the History of Ming would have been between 385 by 157.5 feet and 440 by 180 feet (117.5 by 48 metres, and 134 by 55 metres). The contemporary inscription of Zheng He's ships in the Jinghai temple ÈùúÊµ∑ÂØ∫ inscription in Nanjing gives sizes of 2,000 liao (500 tons) and 1,500 liao (275 tons), which are far too low than would be implied by a ship of 444 chi (450 ft). In addition, in the contemporary account of Zheng He's 7th voyage by Gong Zhen, he said it took 200 to 300 men to handle Zheng He's ships. Ming minister Song Li indicated a ratio of 1 man per 2.5 tons of cargo, which would imply Zheng He's ships were 500 to 750 tons. The inscription on the tomb of Hong Bao, an official in Zheng He's fleet, mentions the construction of a 5,000 liao displacement ship, and taking the liao to be 500 lbs, that would be 1,250 tons displacement or around 750 tons burden. Dionisius A. Agius (2008) estimated a size of 200-250 ft and maximum weight of 700 tons.Agius (2008). p. 250. Controversy Some scholars have argued on engineering grounds that it is highly unlikely that Zheng He's ship was in length, some estimating that it had a maximum size of 110‚Äì124 m (390‚Äì408 feet) long and 49‚Äì51 m (160‚Äì166 feet) wide instead, Guan Jincheng (1947) proposed a much more modest size of 20 zhang long by 2.4 zhang wide (204 ft by 25.5 ft or 62.2 m by 7.8 m)\\"Zheng He xia Xiyang de chuan‚Äù ÈÑ≠Âíå‰∏ãË•øÊ¥ãÁöÑËàπ, Dongfang zazhi Êù±ÊñπÈõúË™å 43 (1947) 1, pp. 47-51, reprinted in Zheng He yanjiu ziliao huibian ÈÑ≠ÂíåÁ†îÁ©∂Ë≥áÊñôÂåØÁ∑® (1985), pp. 268-272. while Xin Yuan'ou (2002) put them as 61‚Äì76 m (200‚Äì250 feet) in length. A four masted junk from Longjiang shipyard, the same shipyard that built Chinese treasure ships. One explanation for the colossal size of the 44 largest Zhang treasure ships, if in fact built, was that they were only for a display of imperial power by the emperor and imperial bureaucrats on the Yangtze River when on court business, including when reviewing Zheng He's actual expedition fleet. The Yangtze River, with its calmer waters, may have been navigable for such large but unseaworthy ships. Zheng He would not have had the privilege in rank to command the largest of these ships. The largest ships of Zheng He's fleet were the 6 masted 2000-liao ships. This would give burthen of 500 tons and a displacement tonnage of about 800 tons. Xin Yuan'ou, professor of the history of science at Shanghai Jiaotong University, argued that Zheng He‚Äôs ships could not have been as large as recorded in the History of Ming. Xin‚Äôs main reasons for concluding that the ships could not have been this size are: # Ships of the dimensions given in the Ming shi would have been 15,000-20,000 tons according to his calculations, exceeding a natural limit to the size of a wooden ocean-going ship of about 7,000 tons displacement.Church (2005). p. 3. # With the benefit of modern technology it would be difficult to manufacture a wooden ship of 10,000 tons, let alone one that was 1.5-2 times that size. It was only when ships began to be built of iron in the 1860s that they could exceed 10,000 tons. # Watertight compartments characteristic of traditional Chinese ships tended to make the vessels transversely strong but longitudinally weak.Agius (2008). p. 223. # A ship of these dimensions would need masts that were 100 metres tall. Several timbers would have to be joined together vertically. As a single tree trunk would not be large enough in diameter to support such mast, multiple timbers would need to be combined at the base as well. No evidence that China had the type of joining materials necessary to accomplish these tasks. # A ship with 9 masts would be unable to resist the combined strength and force of such huge sails, she would not be able to cope with strong wind and would break.Agius (2008). p. 222. From the comments of modern scholars on Medieval Chinese accounts and reports, it is apparent that a ship had a natural limit to her size, going beyond, would have made her structurally unsafe as well as causing a considerable loss of manoeuvrability, something the Spanish Armada ships famously experienced.Howarth, David (1981). The Voyage of the Armada: The Spanish Story. New York, NY: The Viking Press. Page 209‚Äì10; he asserts that the Spanish ships were ‚Äúover-masted for Atlantic weather and had rigging which was too light‚Äù.  Structure  The keel consisted of wooden beams bound together with iron hoops. In stormy weather, holes in the prow would partially fill with water when the ship pitched forward, thus lessening the violent turbulence caused by waves. Treasure ships also used floating anchors cast off the sides of the ship in order to increase stability. The stern had two 2.5 m (8 foot) iron anchors weighing over a thousand pounds each, used for mooring offshore. Like many Chinese anchors, these had four flukes set at a sharp angle against the main shaft. Watertight compartments were also used to add strength to the treasure ships. The ships also had a balanced rudder which could be raised and lowered, creating additional stability like an extra keel. The balanced rudder placed as much of the rudder forward of the stern post as behind it, making such large ships easier to steer. Unlike a typical fuchuan warship, the treasure ships had nine staggered masts and twelve square sails, increasing its speed. Treasure ships also had 24 cast-bronze cannons with a maximum range of 240 to 275 m (800‚Äì900 feet). However, treasure ships were considered luxury ships rather than warships. As such, they lacked the fuchuan's raised platforms or extended planks used for battle. Physical evidence stone tortoise overlooking the former 4th working pool of the Longjiang Shipyard (now a park), where treasure ships were built 600 years ago Some of the drydocks at Longjiang Shipyard at Nanjing‚Äîknown informally as the Treasure Ship Yard‚Äîwere 27 to 36 m (90 to 120 feet) wide. But two such drydocks measured 64 m (210 feet) wide, considered large enough to build a ship 50 m (166-foot) wide. In 1962, a large rudderpost indicating a rudder area of 452 square feet was unearthed at the Longjiang Shipyard. It has been widely said dimensions of this rudderpost corresponds with a ship of between 538 and 600 feet in length, lending credence to the notion that ships of these dimensions were indeed built. However, such use of this piece of archeological evidence rests upon supposing proportions between the rudder and the length of the ship, which have also been the object of intense contestation. Replica A copy of a treasure ship was announced in 2006 to be completed in time for the 2008 Olympic Games. However, the copy was still under construction in Nanjing in 2010. A new date of completion was set for 2013; when this dateline failed to be met in 2014, the project was put on hold indefinitely.

After an early career as a slender leading man, Pallette became a stout character actor. He had a deep voice, which some critics have likened to the sound of a croaking frog, and is probably best-remembered for comic character roles such as Alexander Bullock, Carole Lombard's character's father, in My Man Godfrey (1936), as Friar Tuck in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) starring Errol Flynn, and his similar role as Fray Felipe in The Mark of Zorro (1940) starring Tyrone Power. He also starred in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939) and Heaven Can Wait (1943). Early life and career He was born in Winfield, Kansas, the son of William Baird Pallette (1858‚Äì1932) and Elnora \\"Ella\\" Jackson (1860‚Äì1906). Both of his parents had been actors in their younger years, but by 1889 Pallette's father was an insurance salesman. His sister was Beulah L. Pallette (1880‚Äì1968). Pallette attended Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana. He also worked as a jockey, and did a stage act which included three horses. Pallette then began his acting career on the stage in stock company roles, appearing for a period of six years. Silent pictures Pallette began his silent film career as an extra and stunt man in 1910 or 1911. His first credited appearance was in the one-reel short western/drama The Fugitive (1913) which was directed by Wallace Reid for Flying \\"A\\" Studios at Santa Barbara. The up-and-coming actor was also splitting an apartment with actor Wallace Reid. Pallette with May Allison in Fair and Warmer (1920) Quickly advancing to featured status, Pallette was cast in many westerns. He worked with D. W. Griffith on such films as The Birth of a Nation (1915), where he played two parts, one in blackface, and Intolerance (1916). He also played a Chinese role in Tod Browning's The Highbinders. At this time, Pallette had a slim, athletic figure, a far cry from his portly build later in his career. He starred as the slender sword-fighting swashbuckler Aramis in Douglas Fairbanks' 1921 version of The Three Musketeers, one of the great smash hits of the silent era. However, his girth had begun to get stockier, ending his ambitions of becoming a leading man. Discouraged, Pallette left Hollywood for the oil fields of Texas, where he both made and lost a sizable fortune of $140,000 () in the same year. Eventually he returned to film work. L√©on Bary, Pallette, Douglas Fairbanks and George Siegmann in The Three Musketeers (1921) After gaining a great deal of weight, he became one of the screen's most recognizable character actors. In 1927, he signed as a regular for Hal Roach Studios and was a reliable comic foil in several early Laurel and Hardy movies. In later years, Pallette's weight may have topped out at more than 300 pounds (136 kg). Sound pictures The advent of the talkies proved to be the second major career boost for Pallette. In 1929 he appeared as \\"Honey\\" Wiggin in the 1929 talkie The Virginian. His inimitable rasping gravel voice (described as \\"half an octave below anyone else in the cast\\") made him one of Hollywood's most sought-after character actors in the 1930s and 1940s. The typical Pallette role was gruff, aggravated and down to earth. He played the comically exasperated head of the family (e.g., My Man Godfrey, The Lady Eve, Heaven Can Wait), the cynical backroom sharpy (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington), and the gruff police sergeant in five Philo Vance films including The Kennel Murder Case. Pallette thus appeared in more Philo Vance films than any of the ten actors who played the aristocratic lead role of Vance. Pallette's best-known role may be as Friar Tuck in The Adventures of Robin Hood; he made a similar appearance as Friar Felipe two years later in The Mark of Zorro. BBC commentator Dana Gioia described Pallette's onscreen appeal: Clip showing Pallette (left) with William Powell in My Man Godfrey (1936) > The mature Pallette character is a creature of provocative > contradictions‚Äîtough-minded but indulgent, earthy but epicurean, relaxed but > excitable. His grit and gravel voice sounds simultaneously tough and comic. > ... Pallette uses his girth to create a common touch. Stuffed into a tuxedo > that seems perpetually near bursting, he seems more down-to-earth than the > stylish high society types who surround him. Pallette was cast as the father of lead actress Jeanne Crain for the film In the Meantime, Darling (1944). Director Otto Preminger clashed with Pallette and claimed he was \\"an admirer of Hitler and convinced that Germany would win the war\\". Pallette refused to sit at the same table with black actor Clarence Muse in a scene set in a kitchen. \\"You're out of your mind, I won't sit next to a nigger\\", Pallette hissed at Preminger. Preminger furiously informed Fox studio head Darryl F. Zanuck, who fired Pallette. Although Pallette remains in scenes he already had filmed, the remainder of his role not yet shot was eliminated from the script. However, a 1953 issue of the African-American magazine Jet listed Pallette as being among the attendees of a Hollywood banquet honoring the then \\"oldest Negro actress in the world,\\" Madame Sul-Te- Wan. For his part, Pallette always maintained that a medical problem with his throat ended his career. In increasingly ill health by his late fifties, Pallette made fewer and fewer movies, and for lesser studios. His final movie, Suspense, was released in 1946. Later life In 1946, convinced that there was going to be a \\"world blow-up\\" by atomic bombs, the hawkish Pallette received considerable publicity when he set up a \\"mountain fortress\\" on a ranch near Imnaha, Oregon, as a hideaway from universal catastrophe. The \\"fortress\\" reportedly was stocked with a sizable herd of prize cattle, enormous supplies of food, and had its own canning plant and lumber mill.

Amy works for Jon Favreau and they are filming in New York. She has been eager to meet Christopher and read his screenplay, saying that mob-themed stories are popular. She quickly becomes attracted to him. Adriana has kept a copy of the screenplay Christopher threw away and persuades him to pass it to Jon and Amy. Christopher and Adriana are invited to the film set, but he goes alone. He is absorbed by what he sees and makes a dialogue suggestion that Jon adopts. Jon wants to learn about mob customs and speech from Chris. Chris comes as arranged to meet him at his hotel room but he is not available, so Chris calls on Amy instead. They talk, she begins to give advice about writing a screenplay, and they end up having sex. A few days later he sees her in the hotel lobby and they go to her room to have sex again, but afterwards she is overcome by guilt. Chris finds a screenplay by Jon and sees that Jon has stolen a mob anecdote that Chris told him in confidence. Furious, Chris searches for him, but he has returned to California. In the following days, Amy does not reply to his messages. He finally tracks her down but she tells him, \\"It was wrong, with us,\\" and that Hollywood has lost interest in mob films. After a heated argument, she walks away. A.J. takes his mother's car without permission and damages it. When his parents rebuke him he baffles them by stating that life is absurd, and he does not wish to be confirmed because 'God is dead'. Tony consults Pussy, who is A.J.'s godfather and confirmation sponsor; Pussy says that at that age \\"they get broody.\\" Tony consults Dr. Melfi, who explains that A.J. has discovered existentialism. A.J. consults his grandmother, who tells him not to expect happiness; everyone dies alone; \\"It's all a big nothing.\\" Pussy is forced by the FBI to wear a wire at A.J.'s confirmation and the ensuing reception at the Soprano home. During the reception, Tony discovers A.J. and two friends smoking marijuana in the garage. Pussy goes up to A.J.'s room, where he is sulking, and gently tells him that his father is a good man; A.J. is young and should enjoy life. He hugs him and sends him back down to the party, but Pussy himself goes into the bathroom and sobs. Adriana has inadvertently told Tony about Chris' screenplay-writing. Chris misses the confirmation ceremony and arrives late for the reception. Tony then tells him he has a choice: either follow his other interests (and never see him again), or completely commit himself to Tony. Chris goes out and thinks it over, then goes back inside to Tony.

Background Ammunition at the Chibana Ammunition Depot, February 1969 U.S. chemical weapons were brought into Okinawa in 1962 based on the recommendation of Robert McNamara when he was secretary of defense, according to declassified documents. In 1970, U.S. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird met Japan Defense Agency chief Yasuhiro Nakasone, and said that the United States had received information that North Korea had a supply of chemical weapons. The move of U.S. chemical weapons to Okinawa in 1962 was meant to serve as a deterrent, according to the declassified documents. The Red Hat code name was assigned by the Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, Department of the Army, on November 12, 1962, during the planning to deploy chemical agents to the 267th Chemical Platoon on Okinawa.NARA. Operation Red Hat: Men and a mission (1971) The 267th Chemical Platoon (Service) was activated on Okinawa on December 1, 1962 at Chibana Ammunition Depot. The depot was a hill-top installation next to Kadena Air Base. During this deployment, \\"Unit personnel were actively engaged in preparing RED HAT area, site 2 for the receipt and storage of first increment items, [shipment] \\"YBA\\", DOD Project 112.\\" The company received further shipments, code named YBB and YBF, which according to declassified documents also included sarin, VX, and mustard gas.Mitchell, Jon, \\"'Were we marines used as guinea pigs on Okinawa?',\\" Japan Times, 4 December 2012, p. 14 By 1969, according to later newspaper reports, there was an estimated 1.9 million kg (1,900 metric tons) of VX stored on Okinawa. In 1969, over 20 servicemen (23 U.S. soldiers and one U.S. civilian, according to other reports) were exposed to low levels of the nerve agent sarin while sandblasting and repainting storage containers. The resultant publicity appears to have contributed to the decision to move the weapons off Okinawa. Transfer in 1971 Noborikawa Village, Okinawa The US government directed relocation of chemical munitions from Okinawa to Johnston Atoll in 1971. An official U.S. film on the mission says that 'safety was the primary concern during the operation,' though Japanese resentment of U.S. military activities on Okinawa also complicated the situation. At the technical level, time pressures imposed to complete the mission, the heat, and water rationing problems also complicated the planning. The initial phase of Operation Red Hat involved the movement of chemical munitions from a depot storage site to Tengan Pier, eight miles away, and required 1,332 trailers in 148 convoys. The second phase of the operation moved the munitions to Johnston Atoll.GlobalSecurity.org : Tengan Pier The Army leased on Johnston Atoll. Phase I of the operation took place in January and moved 150 tons of distilled mustard (HD), a blister agent chemically identical to mustard agent (H), manufactured by either the Levinstein or Thiodiglycol processes, but purified further so that it can be stored longer before polymerizing. The arrived at Johnston Atoll with a load of HD projectiles on January 13, 1971. Phase II completed cargo discharge to Johnston Atoll with five moves of the remaining 12,500 tons of munitions, in August and September 1971. They arrived in the following order: USNS Sealift (?), , USNS Miller, USNS Sealift, USNS Pvt McGraw.Brankowitz, William R., Chemical Stockpile Disposal Program.

Units operating under United States Army Ryukyu Islands (USARYIS) were 2nd Logistical Command and the 267th Chemical Company, the 5th and 196th Ordnance Detachments (EOD), and the 175th Ordnance Detachment. Originally, it was planned that the munitions be moved to Umatilla Chemical Depot but this never happened due to public opposition and political pressure.How Umatilla chemical weapons changed NW history The United States Congress passed legislation on January 12, 1971 (PL 91-672) that prohibited the transfer of nerve agent, mustard agent, agent orange and other chemical munitions to all 50 U.S. states.Suzanne Marshall PhD: \\"Chemical Weapons Disposal and Environmental Justice\\", Kentucky Environmental Foundation, November, 1996 (funded by Educational Foundation of America) Storage and destruction The 1971 weapons transfer voyages transported the chemical agents that became the first stockpile at Johnston Atoll. The chemical weapons brought from Okinawa included nerve and blister agents contained in rockets, artillery shells, bombs, mines, and one-ton (900 kg) containers. In 1985 the U.S. Congress mandated that all chemical weapons stockpiled at Johnston Atoll, mostly mustard gas, Sarin, and VX gas, be destroyed. Prior to the beginning of destruction operations, Johnston Atoll held about 6.6 percent of the entire U.S. stockpile of chemical weapons. The Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System (JACADS) was built to destroy all the chemical munitions on the island. The first weapon disposal incineration operation took place on June 30, 1990. Transition from the testing phase to full-scale operations began in May 1993, and in August full-scale operations began. Twice, in 1993 and 1994, the facility had to be evacuated because of hurricanes; operations were delayed for as long as 70 days during these periods. On December 9, 1993, a spill of about 500 pounds (226 kg) of Sarin (Agent GB) occurred inside the Munitions Demilitarization Building (MDB). There was no agent migration outside the building and the contingency plan was not activated. The facility suspended processing of munitions until investigation of the incident was satisfactorily completed. The last munitions were destroyed in 2000.

In the 1880s, slot machines required an attendant to make a payout, usually tickets or tokens. Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm Schultze's \\"Horseshoe Slot Machine\\" of 1893 was the first machine to include an automatic payout mechanism. In 1895, Fey invented a modified version of the Horseshoe that paid out coins; this machine became incredibly popular. Fey opened a slot machine workshop in 1896Charles Fey at SlotsMachinesHistory.com or 1897. In 1898, he designed the \\"Liberty Bell Slot Machine,\\" the most famous slot machine of its day. When three bells aligned, it paid fifty cents. Fey installed and managed his machines in saloons throughout San Francisco. Because gambling was illegal in California, Fey could not patent his device, leading to many competitors.  Personal life  In San Francisco, Fey met Marie Christine Volkmar (1866-1942), but their courtship was interrupted by illness. In the early 1880s, Fey had been diagnosed with tuberculosis; in accordance with scientific knowledge at the time, he moved to a warmer climate (Mexico) for a few years, before returning to San Francisco for a series of creosote treatments, which were successful. He married Marie in 1889. The couple would have three daughters and one son.

For most of the 2006 season, he was shuttled back and forth between the Rangers and their Triple-A affiliate, the Oklahoma RedHawks. Rheinecker was hit by a pitch from Noah Lowry in his only Major League plate appearance on June 28, 2006. , he is one of only six players in history to be hit by a pitch in his only Major League turn at bat. During the April 27‚Äì30, 2007, four game series at Toronto, Rheinecker forgot his passport, and thus could not play in the games. Rheinecker was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) and underwent surgery to remove a rib to alleviate the symptoms. Arthroscopic shoulder surgery was performed on May 24, 2008, to clean up the shoulder joint. This caused him to miss the entire 2008 season other than two minor league rehab starts. He became a free agent at the end of the season. Death On July 18, 2017, Rheinecker committed suicide by hanging himself in a garage. According to family members, he had been suffering from depression. His wife Jamie told investigators that he suffered from heavy alcohol use, and it was determined that he was under the influence of alcohol when he hanged himself. He was survived by his wife Jamie, two children, and two stepchildren.

Production Michael Ferris Gibson, an independent filmmaker, was inspired one night in early 2003 to surf every category of Craigslist's San Francisco. Three hours later he had the inspiration for 24 Hours on Craigslist. After spending five more hours drafting a treatment, he contacted Craig Newmark about the idea. Two days later Michael met with Jim Buckmaster, Craigslist's CEO, and Craig Newmark to discuss the film concept: creating a documentary entirely 'from' Craigslist; crew, cast, and music would all be sourced from the site. Newmark picked the chosen day out of a hat from which to generate the user posts that were used in the film. The production filmed the individuals and followed their stories and interactions with other users over the next three months.

Biography Born in Odessa, Feinberg lived in Moscow from 1894 and studied with Alexander Goldenweiser at the Moscow Conservatory. He also studied composition privately under Nikolai Zhilyayev. He graduated from the Conservatory in 1911, after which he embarked upon a career as a solo pianist, while composing on the side. However, he was soon sent to fight in the First World War for Russia until he became ill and was discharged. In 1922 he joined the faculty at the Moscow Conservatory, relaunching his pianistic career. By 1930, due to the political repressions in Stalin's Russia, Feinberg's concert activities became limited. He made only two foreign trips in the 1930s: Vienna in 1936 and Brussels in 1938; hence he is generally not well known outside Russia. In 1946 he was awarded the Stalin Prize. Feinberg was the first pianist to perform the complete The Well-Tempered Clavier by Bach in concert in the USSR. He is most remembered today for his complete recording of it, and many other works from the classical and romantic eras. He also composed three piano concertos, a dozen piano sonatas (private recordings exist of him playing his piano Sonatas 1, 2, 9 and 12), as well as fantasias and other works for the instrument. Pianist Tatiana Nikolayeva said that each of his sonatas was a \\"poem of life\\". Feinberg has been called \\"A musical heir to Scriabin\\", who heard the young pianist play his fourth sonata and praised it highly. Feinberg Sonata 4 published in 1918, Scriabin dead in 1915. He was a life-long bachelor. He lived with his brother Leonid, who was a poet and painter. He died in 1962, aged 72.

It is very loosely based on the 1996 killing of some drug dealers by police, but with an added dimension of witchcraft battles between police and ex- police. Plot Itti (Chatchai Plengpanich) is a former police officer, now convicted criminal, and endowed with powerful black magic abilities that make him a feared prisoner. He is moved to solitary confinement in a specially constructed cell, but with his mind-reading abilities, is able to detect a weakness in the one jailor who brings him food. In his interactions with the jailor, he is able to take over the man's mind and use the man to help him escape. A young police officer, Santi (Akara Amarttayakul) is assigned to track Itti down, and in confronting Itti, Santi becomes increasingly obsessed with gaining magical powers himself. Release and reception Produced by RS Film, Necromancer was released in Thai cinemas on March 10, 2005. Chatchai Plengpanich won the best actor award for his role at the Thailand National Film Awards.

Thirunallar contains the shrine of Lord Sani (Saturn), Tirunallar Saniswaran Temple within the temple dedicated to Lord Darbharanyeswaran, a form of Lord Shiva. Shani This is the only temple that is dedicated to Lord Shani (Saneeswaran, in Tamil). Whenever (planet) Saturn transits from one zodiac sign to another (an occurrence roughly every 2.5 years), millions throng this shrine for worship. The legendary King Nala is said to have been relieved of his afflictions caused by the malefic influence of Saturn, after worship in this temple. Of the numerous theertams (sacred bathing places), the Nala theertam is the most important one. It is believed that by bathing here, one washes off all kinds of misfortunes and afflictions caused by one's past of karmas (in terms of deities, Lord Shani or Saturn is said to be the dispenser of karmas (both good and bad), but also one whose Grace, particularly at this shrine, can dispel bad karmas or, at least, make them bearable) Literature The Story of the Pachchai Padigam (In the Tamil language, Pachchai = evergreen, Padigam = decadal verse) Thirunallar possesses one of the greatest pieces of Tamil hymnal literature called \\"Pachchai Padigam\\". This hymn is written in praise of Lord Darbharanyeswaran. Legend behind the temple Legend has it that in the 7th century C.E. (Common Era), in Madurai, the capital of the Pandian Kingdom, the king Ninra-seer-nedumaran converted to Jainism. During this time, Jainism was spreading in influence in South India. Soon, all but his queen Mangaiyarkarasi and his minister Kulacchirai Nayanar - both staunch Saivaites (worshippers of Lord Shiva) had embraced Jainism, forsaking the old religion. This caused immense agony to the queen and the minister who were anxious to reclaim both king and kingdom back into the fold of the traditional religion (Saivism). To these two grief-stricken individuals came news of the camping of boy saint Thirugnana Sambandar at Vedaranyam. Having heard of the miracles performed by this young Saivite saint in Thanjavur district, they sent an urgent invitation to him to visit Madurai and extricate the king and his subjects from the clutches of Jainism. The arrival of the Saivate saint irked the Jains, who are said to have then set fire to his holy dwelling. But by his yogic powers, Sambandar had the heat transferred to the king, who consequently suffered in agony. Upon the Queen's request, the young saint then sang the Padigam 'Mandiramavadu Neeru' and sprinkled a few grains of holy ash on the right side of the king's body to alleviate the pain. In contest, the Jains in turn chanted the Aruga Mantra (Jain Mantra) and stroked the left side of the king's person with peacock feathers, but it only aggravated the pain! In response to entreaties by the king and his ministers, Sambandar applied a few more grains of the sacred ash to the king's left side also. The poor Pandian monarch, who only a little while ago was the very picture of suffering, misery and distress, now smiled gaily and was free of his burns. But the Jains challenged the Saivites further, asking that the Mantras of both religions be written on palm leaves and consigned to flames to see which one survived the ordeal of fire (thereby showing superiority over the other). The Jains first placed their palm leaf onto the fire but it was soon consumed by the flames. Saint Thirugnana Sambandar placed on the flames one leaf containing the forty- ninth Padigam of the Tevaram hymn which was sung at the shrine of Lord Darbharanyeswaran Shiva at Thirunallar. The leaf remained untouched by the flames and maintained its evergreen freshness, reestablishing Saivism as the true religion in Pandian capital. Hence the glory of the Thirunallar temple. Etymology The name ThiruNallar(u) is believed to represent the association of King Nala of the Nishadha country who was delivered from the bad effects of Shani (Saturn) by invoking the Lord's mercy here (Nala + Aru = Nallaru). The word \\"Aru\\" here denotes \\"to heal\\" and the two words taken together means the place where Nala was redeemed from the (malefic) hold of Saturn through the Lord's Grace. Others are inclined to read the meaning 'between rivers' in the name Nal-Aru, as this place is situated amidst rivers Noolaru and Vanchiaru in the north, and Arasalaru in the south. Transportation ThiruNallar is located around 7 kilometer away from the district headquarter karaikal. It is well connected with karaikal and kumbakonam. There is no train service available to thirunallar but one can reach karaikal railway station which is located around 7 kilometer from temple. Daily train services are available from karaikal railway station to Bangalore, Chennai, Ernakulam, Thanjavur, Trichy, and weekly train is available to Mumbai LT.

Bastarache (1992), 128 N.B.R. (2d) 217 (N.B.Q.B.)., Gautreau v. R., (1989), 101 N.B.R. (2d) 1 (N.B.Q.B.), Gingras v. Canada, [1990] 2 F.C. 68 (F.C.T.D.). The fact that not all police officers need to be bilingual was established in R. v. Hach√©, (1992), 127 N.B.R. (2d) 177 (N.B.Q.B.). The section's requirements are fully applicable to the main of these offices on the federal level. Section 20 limits its rights only when dealing with the lower-level offices, where there must be considerable interest for services in both languages, or if the offices are filling a function that one would expect should be carried out in both languages.Hogg, page 1153. As section 20 applies to offices besides Parliament and the courts, it is more extensive than sections 17-22 of the Charter and language rights in section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867. As far as the text is concerned, these rights are even more extensive in respect to the government of New Brunswick, where there are no requirements for considerable interest for the right to exist. As constitutional scholar Peter Hogg notes, other provinces are not required to provide bilingual services under section 20, but some choose to do so under provincial legislation. Judicial interpretation In the Supreme Court of Canada case Soci√©t√© des Acadiens v. Association of Parents (1986), Justice Bertha Wilson remarked that the limited rights in section 20 seemed to contrast with section 16, which encourages growth in government bilingualism. However, she speculated Parliament could use section 16 to heighten expectations for bilingualism in section 20, by giving the requirement for considerable interest in bilingualism a flexible interpretation. Wilson did, however, write that courts could not employ this flexible interpretation. The requirement for considerable interest was interpreted in Saulnier v. The Queen, (1989),Saulnier v. The Queen, (1989), 90 N.S.R. (2d) 77 (N.S. Cty. Ct.), in which it was found that the Department of Fisheries violated section 20 by providing English-only services, (1) by simply presuming there was no need for French services, (2) because there were penal consequences for anyone who disobeyed the law not provided in French, and (3) even though some French Canadians understood English, French was still their first language. In Professional Institute of the Public Service v. The Queen (1993),Professional Institute of the Public Service v. The Queen (1993), 60 F.T.R. 194 (F.C.T.D.)., it was added that relevant factors for requiring bilingualism should include the number of people in a minority language community, interest among the population, and relations between the people and the government. Statistics and the practices of the office might be of use in measuring these things. In R. v. Hach√©, (1993),R. v. Hach√©, (1993) 139 N.B.R. (2d) 81 (N.B.C.A.). it was found the government is not under any obligation to tell people that they have rights under section 20. Public views In 1989, a few political scientists published a survey on the public's opinion on section 20. It indicated that French Canadians strongly support French services outside Quebec and in almost equal measure support the same rights for English Quebec. Ninety-seven percent of English Canadians support the right for English Quebeckers, and 65% of English Canadians supported the rights of French Canadians under section 20.Paul M. Sniderman, Joseph F.

Contaldo is the brand ambassador for the luxury Italian holiday specialist Citalia. Early life Contaldo grew up in the small village of Minori on the Amalfi Coast, developing his love for food from days he spent hunting with his father and grandfather, and collecting herbs for his mother. He began working in local restaurants at the age of eight. Career Contaldo left Italy in 1969 for London where he got married in 1974 and had three children - he later had another two children with his current partner. He briefly established an Italian antiques business before returning to cooking. Contaldo's inspiration to cook in England was partly due to the availability of game and fungi, both important components of Amalfitan cuisine. In media interviews, Contaldo has frequently voiced his enthusiasm for foraged wild food, especially mushrooms.Telegraph news article, October 5, 2000Telegraph news article, September 21, 2000Times news article, September 17, 2004. Contaldo later worked for popular London restaurants in St John's Wood, and at Antonio Carluccio's Neal Street Restaurant in London's Covent Garden. He left Neal Street in 1998. Contaldo opened the Passione restaurant, in Charlotte Street, London, in 1999. Passione was awarded 'Best Italian Restaurant 2005' by the Tio Pepe Restaurant Awards. Passione closed in March 2009 due to decreased business as a result of the late-2000s recession.Bloomberg news article, March 25, 2009. In April 2003, Contaldo published his first cookbook, Passione, which is dedicated to the Amalfitan style of cooking. The cookbook won 'Gourmand World Cookbook - Best Italian Cuisine Book' for 2003. His second book, Gennaro's Italian Year, was published in September 2006. His third book, Gennaro's Italian Home Cooking, was published in September 2008, and his fourth, Gennaro's Easy Italian, was published in March 2010. His most recent book, \\"Panetteria: Gennaro's Italian Bakery\\", was published in September 2016. Contaldo is also famous for his association with his prot√©g√©, Jamie Oliver, whom he first mentored at Neal Street Restaurant in the 1990s. The two chefs have since maintained a close friendship and professional relationship. Oliver even once put up a reward for information when Contaldo's restaurant, Passione, was burgled in 2003.BBC news article, September 25, 2003. Contaldo has appeared on many of Oliver's television shows, such as The Naked Chef. He made a comic appearance as one of Oliver's sous-chefs on Food Network's Iron Chef America, in a battle against famed Italian-American chef Mario Batali. Contaldo also developed menus and trained chefs for Oliver's UK restaurant chain Jamie's Italian, in which he is a business partner. In 2011 he toured the Italian regions alongside Antonio Carluccio in a four-part series for the BBC, \\"The Two Greedy Italians\\". This was followed up by a second series which aired in 2012, \\"The Two Greedy Italians: Still Hungry\\". Contaldo has made cooking appearances on numerous other television shows. On BBC1's Saturday morning show Saturday Kitchen, he set a record of 16.36 seconds for making a three-egg omelette. In 2014 he was also awarded a Guinness World Record for the most ravioli made in two minutes.http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2013/1/jamie-oliver-and- gennaro-contaldo-cook-up-guinness-world-records-double-for-new-youtube- channel-launch-46704/ Since 2010, when he founded it, Contaldo has uploaded regularly on his YouTube channel.

A gap in the distribution of foxfish occurs through Victoria. Its length is up to 45 cm. Description The foxfish is brown, red, or orange with two spots on the back. When foxfish are juveniles, they are brown and have three yellow patches with a black area around the pectoral fin. Habitat and biology Foxfish are typically found living under ledges and in caves. It is a long lived species which may attain ages of 60 or more years. Foxfish are protogynous hermaphrodites, and they spawn several times during the late spring and the summer. They form distinct pairs when breeding. Human uses The foxfish is caught as bycatch in trawl fisheries off the coasts of New South Wales and Western Australia. In Western Australia it is a quarry for recreational anglers and the state applies bag limits. It is also taken for the aquarium trade and is prized in the United States. Taxonomy and etymology Bodianus frenchii was formally described in 1879 as Cossyphus frenchii by Carl Benjamin Klunzinger with the type locality given as King George Sound, Western Australia. The specific name honours Herr French, who was an assistant to Dr V. Muller, who was the collector of many types of Australian fishes described by Klunzinger. The vernacular name, \\"foxfish\\", is thought to be taken from the misapplied binomial Bodianus vulpinus, as to most eyes this fish bears no resemblance to a fox. There is a gap in the distribution of the foxfish off the coast of Victoria and the eastern and western populations show morphological differences and may be separated into different species.

Congress authorized the piece at the request of the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition. The quarter depicts the Spanish queen Isabella I of Castile, who sponsored Columbus's voyages to the New World. It was designed by Bureau of the Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber, and is the only U.S. commemorative of that denomination that was not intended for circulation. The Board of Lady Managers, headed by Chicago socialite Bertha Palmer, wanted a woman to design the coin and engaged Caroline Peddle, a sculptor. Peddle left the project after disagreements with Mint officials, who then decided to have Barber do the work. The reverse design, showing a kneeling woman spinning flax, with a distaff in her left hand and a spindle in her right, symbolizes women's industry and was based on a sketch by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan. The quarter's design was deprecated in the numismatic press. The coin did not sell well at the Exposition; its price of $1 was the same as for the Columbian half dollar, and the quarter was seen as the worse deal. Nearly half of the authorized issue was returned to the Mint to be melted; thousands more were purchased at face value by the Lady Managers and entered the coin market in the early 20th century. Today, they are popular with collectors and are valued in the hundreds to thousands of dollars, depending on condition.  Legislation  In August 1892, Congress passed an act authorizing the first United States commemorative coin, a half dollar, to be sold at a premium by the managers of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The event had been authorised by Congress two years previously; that legislation created a Board of Lady Managers and a Board of Gentleman Managers to oversee the fair. The Board of Lady Managers was headed by Bertha Palmer, whose husband Potter owned the Palmer House, the leading hotel in Chicago. The decisions of the Lady Managers were often reversed by their male counterparts on controversial matters: for example, Palmer sought to shut the fair's \\"Egyptian Girls\\" dancing show after deeming it obscene. The show was one of the exposition's few successful moneymakers, and the Lady Managers were overruled by the men. Bertha Palmer led the Exposition's Board of Lady Managers Authorization for the Board of Lady Managers had been included in the 1890 law giving federal authority for the Exposition at the insistence of women's advocate, Susan B. Anthony, who was determined to show that women could successfully assist in the management of the fair. To that end, the Lady Managers sought a coin to sell in competition with the commemorative half dollar at the Exposition, which Congress had approved in 1892. Passage of the half dollar legislation had been difficult, and the Lady Managers decided to wait until the next session of Congress to make their request. When the half dollar appeared in November 1892, the Lady Managers considered it inartistic and determined to do better. Palmer wanted the Lady Managers \\"to have credit of being the authors of the first really beautiful and artistic coin that has ever been issued by the government of the United States\\". In January 1893, Palmer approached the House Appropriations Committee, asking that $10,000 of the funds already designated to be paid over to the Lady Managers by the federal government be in the form of souvenir quarters, which they could sell at a premium. On March 3, 1893, Congress duly passed an act authorising the souvenir coin, which was to be to the specifications of the quarter struck for circulation, and with a design to be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. Total mintage of the special quarter would be limited to 40,000 specimens.  Inception  Desiring a beautiful coin to sell, Palmer asked artist Kenyon Cox to produce sketches. She was, however, determined to have a woman actually design the coin. She also consulted with Sara Hallowell, who was both the secretary to the fair's Director of Fine Arts and was helping the Palmers amass a major art collection. Hallowell contacted sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, who recommended his onetime student, Caroline Peddle, who was already engaged in exposition work, having been commissioned by Tiffany's to produce an exhibit. Palmer agreed to have Peddle do the work. After Congress authorized the souvenir quarter, the Director of the Bureau of the Mint, Edward O. Leech, wrote to Palmer on March 14, 1893. Although he expressed a willingness to have the Lady Managers select the design, Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber and Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Oliver Bosbyshell had already urged Leech to keep the design process in-house at the Mint. Palmer replied that the Lady Managers had decided that the quarter would bear a portrait of Isabella I, Queen of Castile (in Spain), whose assistance had helped pay for Columbus's expedition. Palmer indicated that she was consulting artists and suggested that the Mint submit a design for consideration. She also met with Illinois Congressman Allen Durborow, chairman of the House of Representatives' Fair Committee and a former colleague of Secretary of the Treasury John G. Carlisle, Leech's superior. Palmer suggested to the congressman that he advocate for the Lady Managers with Carlisle and Leech. Palmer, by letter, hired Peddle to do the design work in late March. She instructed the artist that the coin was to have a figure of Isabella on the obverse, and the inscription \\"Commemorative coin issued for the Board of Lady Managers of the World's Columbian Exposition by Act of Congress, 1492‚Äì1892\\" on the reverse, as well as the denomination and the name of the country. The chairwoman did not request that Peddle provide the Lady Managers with the design before sending it to the Mint. Palmer informed Carlisle and Leech of her instructions. Carlisle had no objection to a coin being designed by a woman, or to the use of Isabella's head. The secretary told Palmer that the reverse, with its long inscription, would appear like a business advertising token, and he asked that it be revised. Leech sent a note to Superintendent Bosbyshell informing him that the Lady Managers would likely have an outside sculptor create the obverse and asking him to have Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber create some designs for the reverse for possible use. Peddle's sketch Obedient to Palmer's instructions, Peddle sent Leech sketches of a seated Isabella, with the long inscription on the reverse; she hoped the Mint Director would allow her to shorten it. Leech was unhappy with the reverse, and decided that Barber would design that side of the coin. Barber and Bosbyshell wrote to Leech that Isabella's legs would appear distorted if the seated figure were used and advocated a head in profile. Carlisle agreed, stating that he had only given permission for a head of Isabella. Peddle was informed that Barber would produce the reverse, though the design would be sent to her for approval, and she would have to change her obverse. Meanwhile, Palmer was growing increasingly anxious: with a timeline of two months from design approval to the availability of the actual coins, she feared that the pieces would not be available for sale until well into the fair's May to October run. Under pressure from all sides, Peddle threatened to quit the project, writing that she \\"could not consent to do half of a piece of work\\". What finally wore down Peddle's patience were two letters dated April 7. One, from Leech, asserted his right as Mint director to prescribe coin designs, and told Peddle that the obverse would be a head of Isabella, while the reverse would be based on sketches by a Mint engraver which she would be free to model. The second, from Bosbyshell, imposed the additional requirement that Isabella not wear a crown, which he deemed inappropriate on an American coin. On April 8, 1893, Caroline Peddle withdrew from the project. Following Peddle's resignation, Leech wrote a conciliatory letter to Palmer, who responded regretting that the three of them had not worked together, rather than at cross-purposes. Palmer had written to suggest an alternative to the inscription reverse: that the coin depict the Women's Building at the fair. Barber prepared sketches and rejected the idea, stating that the building would appear a mere streak on the coin in the required low relief. Instead, he favored a sketch prepared by Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan, showing a kneeling woman spinning flax, with a distaff in her hands. Leech was not fully satisfied with the proposal, stating that the juxtaposition of Isabella on the obverse and the Morgan reverse was \\"too much woman\\". Before accepting Morgan's design, Leech wanted Barber to produce some reverses himself, which the chief engraver did, and Bosbyshell forwarded them to Leech on April 11 and 12. These showed various uses of a heraldic eagle. After considering these efforts, Leech decided on Morgan's design and wrote to Palmer accordingly, stating that \\"the distaff is used in art to symbolize patient industry, and especially the industry of women.\\" In response, the Lady Managers suggested the use of the building's portal, and asked if it was possible to place a living person on the coin. Leech stated that Secretary Carlisle had selected the distaff reverse, and his determination was binding. Bosbyshell informed Leech by letter that Stewart Cullin, curator at the University of Pennsylvania, possessed a number of medals depicting Isabella, and former general Oliver O. Howard was engaged in writing a biography of the late queen and possessed likenesses of her. Leech agreed that these men be consulted. Carlisle was reluctant to allow an inscription which made distinctions by sex, such as \\"Board of Lady Managers\\", to appear on the coin, but he eventually agreed to that wording. On April 24, the Mint Director sent Palmer a box containing two plaster models of the obverse, one of Isabella as a young queen, the other showing her more mature. He also informed her that distaff reverse would be used, with the wording agreed to by Carlisle. The obverse models were supposedly made by Barber based on an engraving of Isabella forwarded by Peddle to the Mint at Palmer's request, but Moran suggests that the period of only a day between receipt of the engraving and completion of the models (during which Barber also attended the funeral of Bosbyshell's grandson) means that Barber was working on them before that. The Board of Lady Managers on May 5 selected the young queen.  Design and reception  1838 anti-slavery token \\"Am I not a woman and a sister\\" The obverse of the Isabella quarter depicts a crowned and richly clothed bust of that Spanish queen. According to art historian Cornelius Vermeule, Barber's obverse design \\"follow[s] Gilbert Scott's Victorian Gothic tradition of photographic classicism, best summed up by the groups of continents and the reliefs of famous persons on the Albert Memorial in London.\\" The reverse depicts a kneeling woman with distaff and spindle. Vermeule traces that imagery to the figure of a young female servant, carved upon the east pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia in the 5th century B.C. Nevertheless, a contemporary account in the American Journal of Numismatics compared the reverse to an anti-slavery token with a kneeling woman and the legend \\"Am I not a woman and a sister\\". The art historian, writing in 1971, noted that \\"nowadays the coin seems charming for its quaintness and its Victorian flavor, a mixture of cold Hellenism and Renaissance romance. Perhaps one of its greatest joys is that none of the customary inscriptions, mottoes and such, appear on it.\\" Numismatic historian Don Taxay, in his study of early U.S. commemoratives, dismissed contemporary accounts (such as in the fair's official book) that Kenyon Cox had provided a design for the quarter; he noted that the artist's son had strongly denied that his father was involved in the coin's creation. Taxay deemed the design \\"commonplace\\" and \\"typical of Barber's style\\", stating that \\"the modeling, though somewhat more highly relieved than on the half dollar, is without distinction\\". The American Journal of Numismatics had other criticisms of the quarter:  Release and collecting  Minting of what Barber dubbed \\"showy quarters\\" began at the Philadelphia Mint on June 13, 1893, six weeks after the exposition opened. Leech had planned to strike the pieces using polished blanks, or planchets, and workers at that mint handled the coins carefully; unlike the half dollar, surviving specimens display relatively few contact marks from other coins. The first piece struck, along with numbers 400, 1,492, and 1,892, were struck as proofs and sent to the Lady Managers along with certificates attesting to their status. A total of 40,023 pieces were struck, with the 23 coins over the authorized mintage retained by the Mint for inspection by the 1894 Assay Commission. The pieces did not sell well at the exposition. They were for sale only at the Women's Building at the fair, or by mail; the half dollar could be purchased at several outlets. Some 15,000 quarters were sold to collectors, dealers, and fairgoers, including several thousand of them purchased by the Scott Stamp and Coin Company. Fairgoers viewed the quarter as not as good a deal as the half dollar, as both sold for the same price of $1. Of the remainder, approximately 10,000 quarters were bought at face value by Palmer and other Lady Managers; 15,809 were returned to the government for melting. After deducting pieces returned for melting, a total of 24,214 coins were distributed to the public. The large quantities possessed by the Lady Managers made their way into the market through dealers and other vendors in the 1920s. By 1930, prices had risen to the original issue price; by 1955, uncirculated specimens sold for $20. The pieces are popular among collectors because they are the only U.S. quarter dollars issued strictly as a commemorative, not for circulation. The 2018 deluxe edition of R.S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the piece as ranging between $325 in almost uncirculated AU-50 on the Sheldon coin grading scale and $3,750 in near-pristine MS-66.

It was created in 1938 by the San Francisco Down Town Association to showcase the city's major attractions and natural beauty during the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition. Originally beginning at San Francisco City Hall and ending on Treasure Island, the route has been modified several times since. Today the route forms a loop proceeding counterclockwise from Civic Center Plaza, and its length is closer to . Owing variously to its length, its labyrinthine route, and the difficulty of driving through a bustling city, the drive remains relatively unpopular with tourists and locals alike. Route description San Francisco City Hall is, since 1999, both the starting and the ending route marker. The drive begins on Polk St. opposite San Francisco City Hall. Circling Civic Center Plaza and passing Bill Graham Civic Auditorium, the San Francisco Public Library's main branch, and the Asian Art Museum, the route continues north along Larkin Street through Little Saigon before turning onto Geary Boulevard and proceeding west up Cathedral Hill. After entering Japantown, the drive turns north onto Webster Street before immediately returning east along Post Street, where it continues past Japan Center, Lower Nob Hill, and Union Square. At Grant Avenue, the route again turns north and enters Chinatown through its Dragon Gate. Drivers are soon directed onto California Street and up Nob Hill, passing its landmark hotels. Turning north at Grace Cathedral, the route then directs drivers east onto Washington Street, passing the San Francisco Cable Car Museum, then south onto Powell Street for one block before descending east along Clay Street, back into Chinatown. At Portsmouth Square, the route proceeds north along Kearny Street for two blocks and turns northwest onto Columbus Avenue, entering North Beach. After passing City Lights Bookstore and turning onto Grant Avenue once more, the route travels for six blocks up Telegraph Hill before turning west onto Lombard Street near Coit Tower. Passing the Joe DiMaggio Playground, the route turns north toward Fisherman's Wharf on Mason Street. The Palace of Fine Arts in the Marina District At Jefferson Street, the route proceeds alongside the bustling waterfront‚Äîpassing Aquatic Park and the San Francisco Maritime Museum with several quick turns heading into the Marina District near Fort Mason. Over the next few miles, the route passes nearly all of San Francisco's Golden Gate National Recreation Area locations. The route detours through the Marina Green parking lot and takes a path of residential streets to the Palace of Fine Arts, the most prominent remaining structure from the 1915 Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition. Continuing for a few blocks each on Baker, Bay, Broderick, Chestnut, and Lyon streets, the route enters the Presidio at Lombard Street. At , the route passes the Letterman Digital Arts Center, proceeds onto Presidio Boulevard, and continues onto Lincoln Boulevard. The route detours through the Presidio's Main Post before returning to Lincoln Boulevard near San Francisco National Cemetery. Passing above Crissy Field and Fort Point, under the U.S. Highway 101 (US 101) approach to the Golden Gate Bridge, and above Baker Beach, the route exits the Presidio into Sea Cliff. Continuing along El Camino del Mar into Lincoln Park, the route passes the Legion of Honor and exits the park into the Richmond District. Turning westward onto Geary Boulevard, drivers proceed several blocks and continue onto Point Lobos Avenue, soon reaching the Sutro Baths and Cliff House. Stow Lake in Golden Gate Park At , the route proceeds due south along the city's Pacific coast on Great Highway, passing Ocean Beach, the edge of Golden Gate Park, the San Francisco Zoo, and skirting Lake Merced before returning north on Lake Merced Boulevard past San Francisco State University and continuing through the Sunset District along Sunset Boulevard. The route then enters Golden Gate Park and winds through it for about ‚Äîcircling Stow Lake; passing the Japanese Tea Garden, San Francisco Botanical Garden, and California Academy of Sciences; turning at the AIDS Memorial Grove; and exiting the park's East Portal at Stanyan Street. The route along its descent from Twin Peaks Briefly skirting the Haight-Ashbury and Cole Valley neighborhoods, the route ascends Parnassus Street and passes the University of California, San Francisco's main campus. Turning south onto 7th Avenue in the Inner Sunset, the route curves around Mount Sutro and the Laguna Honda Reservoir before turning east and climbing Twin Peaks. From Twin Peaks Boulevard, drivers are directed into the north peak's parking area and offered unobstructed views of the city below. The route then descends into Corona Heights‚Äîbuilt to take full advantage of the views at this height. Winding its way down the hill, the route takes drivers past the Randall Museum before descending east along 14th Street into San Francisco's prominent gay neighborhood, The Castro. Now into the drive, the route turns southward along tree-lined Dolores Street, passing Mission San Francisco de As√≠s and Mission Dolores Park while splitting the Castro, Mission District, and Noe Valley en route to Cesar Chavez Street. At Cesar Chavez Street, the route continues east through Potrero Hill before abruptly directing drivers onto northbound I-280. After about of surface streets, the route travels along I-280 for the final of that freeway, exiting near Mission Bay and Oracle Park. It winds along The Embarcadero and underneath the San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge‚Äîonce the final leg of the route before its Treasure Island terminus. At Market Street, the route crosses in front of the Ferry Building and shortly thereafter turns westward along Washington Street to enter the Financial District. Proceeding south on the often-congested Battery Street, the route crosses Market Street and enters the SoMA neighborhood on 1st Street. Turning again at Howard Street, the route passes the SFMOMA, Yerba Buena Gardens, and Moscone Center before making its final turn onto 9th Street, crossing Market once more, and returning to Civic Center Plaza. The route ends where it began, in front of City Hall, after traveling . History =World's Fair attraction= In the late 1930s, residents of San Francisco and the greater Bay Area celebrated the completion of both the Golden Gate Bridge and San Francisco‚ÄìOakland Bay Bridge. In July 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was given a vehicular tour of the city, including its two bridges, with Senator William Gibbs McAdoo and Mayor Angelo Joseph Rossi before speaking at the Treasure Island fairgrounds, site of the Golden Gate International Exposition of 1939‚Äì40. Later that year, the San Francisco Down Town Association devised a route from behind City Hall to Treasure Island that was originally titled the \\"50-Mile Scenic Drive\\", marking the way with blue and gold triangular signs. The name was changed shortly thereafter‚Äîprobably with marketing intentions‚Äîto reflect San Francisco's approximate area () and reference the California Gold Rush of 1849, from which the term \\"forty-niner\\" originates. The Down Town Association produced brochures highlighting the scenic drive for tourists. On September 14, 1938, the 49-Mile Scenic Drive was officially opened by Douglas Corrigan, who had achieved fame (and his nickname, \\"Wrong Way\\") earlier in 1938 for claiming to fly from New York City to Los Angeles but ending up in Dublin. Corrigan drove at least part of the route in reverse on that day. =Reroutings and a new sign= After the Golden Gate International Exposition was closed in 1940, control of Treasure Island was transferred to the U.S. Navy, and the drive was rerouted for the first time. During World War II, civilian access to the Presidio was closed, the route effectively closing along with it. In 1947, the drive reopened with an expanded southeastern segment, which now continued south past Mission San Francisco de As√≠s to Excelsior, McLaren Park, and Visitacion Valley before returning via the Bayshore Freeway and Bryant Street to The Embarcadero. Today, portions of the route are marked by these signs chosen in a 1954 contest. In 1954, the Down Town Association held a contest to design a new sign to mark the route, offering the winner a $100 prize. Local artist Rex May submitted the winning entry, a seagull in profile on a sky blue background with white and orange text. The signs have proved a popular target for theft and many portions of the route are unsigned. The San Francisco Department of Parking and Traffic, which manages the signs, attempts to replace them when they are informed. By 1976, the drive had been rerouted once more. The initial segment now moved west from Van Ness Avenue through Japantown, showcasing the recently completed Japan Center. A more complex loop through Chinatown included a trip up Nob Hill. A formalized detour to Fort Point was indicated, and the route now turned in Lincoln Park to reach Cliff House via Geary Boulevard instead of Fort Miley. A longer route through Golden Gate Park now included a circle of Stow Lake from the north, and the southeastern loop to Visitacion Valley was truncated and replaced by a turn on Army Street (Cesar Chavez). Finally, a new segment on Interstate 280 allowed the drive to return to The Embarcadero. In 1999, the route was again modified. Changes included beginning at Civic Center Plaza rather than on Van Ness Avenue, removing the formal detour to Coit Tower, and traveling on Howard Street instead of Market Street at the end of the route.

The resolution stipulated a cease fire to take effect within 12 hours of the adoption of the resolution. The \\"appropriate auspices\\" was interpreted to mean American or Soviet rather than UN auspices. This third clause helped to establish the framework for the Geneva Conference (1973) held in December 1973. The resolution was passed at the 1747th UNSC meeting by 14 votes to none, with one member, the People's Republic of China, not participating in the vote. The fighting continued despite the terms called for by the resolution, brought Resolution 339 which resulted in a cease fire. The resolution states: Binding or non-binding issue The alleged importance of resolution 338 in the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict supposedly stems from the word \\"decides\\" in clause 3 which is held to make resolution 242 binding. However the decision in clause 3 does not relate to resolution 242, but rather to the need to begin negotiations on a just and durable peace in the Middle East that led to the Geneva Conference which Syria did not attend. The argument continues; Article 25 of the United Nations Charter says that UN members \\"agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council\\". It is generally accepted that Security Council resolutions adopted according to Chapter VII of the UN Charter in the exercise of its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace in accordance with the UN Charter are binding upon the member states.Higgins, Rosalyn, The Advisory Opinion on Namibia: Which UN Resolutions Are Binding Under Article 25 of the Charter?, in 21 Int'l & Comp. L.Q. 286 1972 pp. 270‚Äì266, pp. 285‚Äì286\\"Legal Consequences for States of the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia, notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970)\\" in [1971] I.C.J. Reports pp. 4‚Äì345, pp 52‚Äì53 Scholars applying this doctrine on the resolution assert that the use of the word \\"decide\\" makes it a \\"decision\\" of the Council, thus invoking the binding nature of article 25.Rostow, Eugene V. \\"The Illegality of the Arab Attack on Israel of October 6, 1973.\\" The American Journal of International law, 69(2), 1975, pp. 272‚Äì289. The legal force added to Resolution 242 by this resolution is the reason for the otherwise puzzling fact that SC 242 and the otherwise seemingly superfluous and superannuated Resolution 338 are always referred to together in legal documents relating to the conflict. The more obvious need for the use of Resolution 338 is that it requires all parties to cease fire and states when that should occur, without which Resolution 242 can't be accomplished. Some scholars have advanced the position that the resolution was passed as a non-binding Chapter VI recommendation.Adler, Gerald M., Israel and Iraq: United Nations Double Standards ‚Äì UN Charter Article 25 and Chapters VI and VII (2003) Einhorn, Talia, \\"The Status of Palestine/Land of Israel and Its Settlement Under Public International Law\\" in Nativ Online No.1 Dec.

The Egyptian action and the arrival of more Soviet equipment to Cairo permitted Israel to tighten its grip on the EgyptiansChronological History of U.S. Foreign Relations by Lester H. Brune and Richard Dean Burns (Nov 22, 2002) ::::According to other sources, Israel broke the cease-fire first: On October 22 the superpowers brokered UN Security Council Resolution 338. It provided the legal basis for ending the war, calling for a cease-fire to be in place within twelve hours, implementation of Resolution 242 'in all its parts' and negotiations between the parties. This marked the first occasion the Soviets had endorsed direct negotiations between the Arabs and Israel without conditions or qualifications. Golda Meir, the Israeli Ptine Minister, who was not consulted, was offended by this fait accompli, though she had little option but to comply. Nevertheless, Meir was determined to gain the maximum strategic advantage before the final curtain came down on the conflict. Given the entanglement of the Egyptian and Israeli armies, the temptation was too great for the Israelis to resist. After a final push in the Sinai expelled the Egyptians, Meir gave the order to cross the Canal. Israel's refusal to stop fighting after a United Nations cease-fire was in place on October 22 nearly involved the Soviet Union in the military confrontation.[Academic Journal.Stephens, Elizabeth. \\"Caught on the hop: the Yom Kippur War: Elizabeth Stephens examines how thirty-five years ago this month the surprise invasion of Israel by Egypt and its allies started the process that led to Camp David.\\" History Today 58.10 (2008): 44+.

MotoMaster products ranged from oil filters and air filters, to MotoMaster branded tires. As of 2011, MotoMaster was the most popular replacement tire brand in Canada, with 13% market share by unit volume of the passenger replacement tire market and 10% market share by unit volume of the light truck replacement tire market. MotoMaster has its own sub-brands to distinguish premium products such as \\"Eliminator\\" which distinguished premium products from their less expensive lines for items like automotive batteries, booster packs and battery charges. The 'Rough Rider' light truck tire sub-brand was replaced with 'Total Terrain' in recent years. 'Formula 1' was created initially to push their synthetic lines but expanded with the disappearance of other lines into conventional, diesel, marine, transmission and power steering oils as well as a number of other gear oils. Despite the expansion, MotoMaster's Supreme sub-brand continues to exist as an entry level oil product. The 'Mastercraft' sub-brand is their mid-level tool-line, such as screw drivers and socket sets while 'Mastercraft Maximum' is their premium tool brand. JobMate is a rebranded product line for entry-level tools sold by Canadian Tire. The MotoMaster line has shrunk somewhat in recent years as the store has moved towards brand name products. For example, in early 2003, the line of MotoMaster spark plugs were fully discontinued in favour of carrying only brand names such as Champion, NGK, AC Delco, and Bosch. In 2004, the Formula 1 line of oil filters was discontinued, and in 2002, the 'Motomaster 60' line of batteries was replaced with the more generic 'Sure Start'. One reason for the gradual reduction of the MotoMaster line is the existence of the PartSource chain, of which 63 locations are fully owned and operated by the Canadian Tire Corporation as of May 2007. Though these stores carry many of the same products and share much of their supply chain, Part Source operates at arm's length from Canadian Tire but shares some backoffice operations. Although the MotoMaster name remains on a wide variety of tires, the selection has shrunk recently. In 2004, MotoMaster discontinued the Sentinel A/S and Touring 160 tires leaving the brand with the Touring AW/H and SE2 lines. MotoMaster dropped their Performance line of tires and Canadian Tire no longer has a specific Premium Tire category having folded it into the Touring categories. Some regard MotoMaster as an entry level line of tires despite the tires being produced for Canadian Tire by larger companies such as Michelin (SE2), Cooper (SE3, Winter Edge) and BF Goodrich. Some tires such as Goodyear Nordic winter tires are exclusive to Canadian Tire but not marketed under the MotoMaster umbrella.

Early years John Harold Leims was born in Chicago, Illinois, on June 8, 1921. He attended St. Hilary Parochial School, Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary, and graduated from Saint George High School in Evanston, Illinois, in 1939. At Saint George's, he played varsity football and track, was sports editor of the school paper, and was an Assistant Scoutmaster in the Boy Scouts of America. After high school, he attended Northwestern University for two and a half years, and worked part- time at the Commonwealth Edison Company. He left college in 1941 following his marriage, and worked subsequently for the Standard Oil Company; the Paschen Construction Company; the Naval Station at Great Lakes, Illinois, and the Austin Construction Company. Marine Corps service Enlisting in the Marine Corps Reserve on November 27, 1942, he completed recruit training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego and was assigned to the 3rd Service Battalion, 3rd Marine Division. He left for overseas duty with that unit, on February 23, 1943. After four months in New Zealand and two months at Guadalcanal, he was selected for officer training and returned to the United States in September 1943. He was commissioned a Marine second lieutenant on March 1, 1944, at Quantico, Virginia. On June 29, 1944, 2nd Lt Leims went overseas again and rejoined the 3rd Marine Division. This time, he was a company officer in a rifle company of the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines. In October and November, he was actively engaged in patrolling against Japanese holdouts on Guam. Landing on Iwo Jima on February 24, 1945, he was slightly wounded by a shell fragment on February 27, but returned to duty on the same day. On March 3, due to heavy casualties, he became company commander (B-1-9), a position usually filled by a captain. On March 7, he led his company in a surprise attack against a strongly fortified enemy hill position, succeeded in capturing the objective, and in spite of withering fire returned forward to rescue two of his wounded men. Promoted to first lieutenant on June 1, 1945, he returned to the United States that November and was detached from active duty on January 25, 1946. On June 14 of that year, he was temporarily recalled to active duty to receive the Medal of Honor, presented to him by President Harry S. Truman in a White House ceremony. A member of the 9th Reserve District, Leims was subsequently promoted to captain in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1956, and retired on July 1, 1962. He died on June 28, 1985, at the age of 64.
