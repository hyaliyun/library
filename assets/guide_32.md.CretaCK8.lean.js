It was a disc wheel, in contrast to the usual spoked wheels in general use on British railways. The wheel was designed by Oliver Bulleid and developed by the steel company Firth Brown of Sheffield. Design The BFB comprises a single disc, with teardrop-shaped indentations to give rigidity, and lightening holes to reduce weight. The advantage over a spoked wheel is that a disc wheel carries the tyre (the metal hoop shrunk onto the wheel to provide contact with the rail) more efficiently; spoked wheels are prone to shrink over time, causing the tyre to work loose, whilst in a disc wheel this is less pronounced. Disc wheels also distribute the weight more evenly, reducing the hammer effect on, and thus the damage to, the rail. The BFB weighed about ten per cent less than a spoked wheel of the same size.Allen pDay-Lewis p 146 Name The Bulleid Firth Brown, or BFB, is sometimes, but inaccurately, referred to as a Boxpok in reference to the wheel used by a number of US railway companies. The BFB is visually similar to the Boxpok, but is of a different design; the Boxpok is composed of sections fixed together to make a hollow shape, while the BFB is cast in a single piece, like a spoked wheel, the shape giving the rigidity needed. The wheel is named for Firth Brown as well as Bulleid to give equal credit for the design: while the idea was Bulleid's, the development work, and how to cast them, was done by the company. Therefore, both shared the patent. In fact one source gives BFB as meaning Beaumont Firth Brown, referring to the engineer at the firm who oversaw the development. History Battle of Britain class 34053 Sir Keith Park The BFB was developed in 1938 for use on Bulleid's innovative Merchant Navy class of Pacific locomotives. He later used them on all subsequent designs: the Q1 \\"austerity class\\" in 1942; his Light Pacifics (the West Country and Battle of Britain classes) in 1945; and his Leader class in 1946. The pacifics also used a similar design of BFB for the non-driving carrying wheels. He also used them in his modifications to the Maunsell Diesel shunters then in use on the Southern. Assessment Despite the advantages for which it was designed and well suited, the BFB had a number of drawbacks. It was difficult to maintain, the hollows collected undesired particles like oil, sand and water. In addition, the wheels were found to be prone to cracking, though this was later attributed to the poorer quality of available steel used during and after the Second World War than to some intrinsic design flaw. The use of the BFB was discontinued in 1948 after the amalgamation of the Southern into British Railways and Bulleid's departure to work for CIE in Ireland. The next generation of steam traction in Britain, e.g. the BR Standards, would all use spoked wheels. Although many of the Bulleid pacifics were rebuilt and major features such as their valvegear replaced, the BFB wheels were retained.

It was a centre for tin and copper mining in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, with a few houses to the south of the A390 road. It was developed in the 1970s, with the construction of housing and an industrial estate to the north of the road. Since 1974, the site of Cuddra mine has been developed as Pine Lodge Gardens, an attraction holding over 6,000 varieties of plants, many collected by the owner on plant hunting expeditions.  Development Most of Holmbush is comparatively recent. In the 1880s, the main centre of population was on the south side of what is now the main A390 road, sandwiched between the road and the railway to St Austell. To the north of the housing was the West Wheal Eliza tin mine. To the north east was Wheal Eliza Consols tin mine, while to the east, Cuddra tin and copper mine was already disused, and further east was the disused South Cuddra copper mine.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1882 (available here ) By 1907,Cuddra mine was no longer marked on the map, and West Wheal Eliza and Wheal Eliza Consols were both marked as disused.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1907 No further development is obvious on the 1963 mapOrdnance Survey, 1:10,560 map, 1962-1963 but the 1971 map shows the development of housing to the north of the main road, with a few larger buildings to the east, which is now the site of the industrial estate.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1970-1971 The 1977 map shows the Wheal Eliza cricket ground, constructed in 1973 on part of the West Wheal Eliza site, which was first used for Minor Counties Championship matches in 1982, when Cornwall played Dorset. Modern maps still show tips between the cricket ground and the industrial estate and at Cuddra. The main area is marked as Cuddra Plantations, and is the location of Pine Lodge Gardens and a nursery. Wheal Eliza Consols is still named.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 2010 Tourism Near to the remains of Wheal Eliza Consols mine is Boscundle Manor, built in 1767 for the mine's captain, and now a hotel and restaurant. Although modernised, it is a Grade II Listed building. The site of Cuddra mine was the location of Pine Lodge, which was bought in 1974, and became the centre of Pinetum Park and Pine Lodge Gardens. The new owners used it as a showpiece for their collections of plants, obtained from seeds collected on plant hunting expeditions around the world. It now includes a formal garden, a cottage garden, a formal garden, water features and a lake, shrubberies, a pinetum, an arboretum, a Japanese garden and a winter garden. Over 6,000 species of plants have been labelled by the owner, Mrs Shirley Clemo, and in 2008 the gardens were given a Bronze Award in the Small Visitor Attraction of the Year category, in recognition of their contribution to tourism in Cornwall. History Holmbush was the location of Charlestown United Mines, one of a series of metal mines in the vicinity. It produced large quantities of tin and copper in the early nineteenth century. In addition to the engine house shafts, there were whim shafts, where a winch was used to raise the ore, which was then crushed in stamps powered by water wheels and by steam engines. The ore was transported to nearby Charlestown for export. In 1838, it employed a total of 814 people, 431 men, 120 women and 263 children. There were 283 adults living in the village according to the census of 1851, of whom ten were miners and one was a mine manager. One of the miners also worked as a cooper, as did ten other men. The census also recorded a tea-dealer and a hobbler Charlestown United Mines later became part of Charlestown United and Cuddra Consolidated Mines, who owned four mines in the vicinity.

Infection causes mild gastrointestinal signs in young pigs and can also be transmitted as intestinal spirochetosis in humans, as it is a zoonosis. The disease is widespread in pig-rearing countries and may be referred to as PIS, spirochaetal diarrhoea and porcine colonic spirochaetosis. Clinical signs and diagnosis Clinical signs are most commonly seen in young pigs aged eight to 14 weeks. Normally, a greyish diarrhoea is seen in individual piglets, and poor growth rates and feed conversion ratios are observed on a herd level. Stress, caused by moving and mixing groups of piglets, can increase incidence. A definitive diagnosis can be made by culturing the bacterium on a specific blood agar medium, followed by PCR. Alternatively, necropsy and histological examination of the large intestine can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment and control Antibiotics are the treatment of choice. They should be administered by injection or in drinking water. Pig husbandry measures should be employed to ensure that stressors such as the mixing and moving of pigs are kept to a minimum to reduce disease incidence.

In 1338, at Orvieto, together with his father Nicola, he sided with the Monaldeschi della Vipera against the Monaldeschi della Cervara and was declared a rebel. In 1345 he returned to Orvieto and was appointed as commander of the communal army, commanding 5,000 men at the siege of Castiglion Fiorentino. In February 1352 he was able to reconquer Orvieto, which had surrendered to Perugia, but was pushed back by Pepo Monaldeschi del Cane. In 1354 he entered the service of cardinal Gil de Albornoz at Milan, to fight against the Ghibelline leader Bernab√≤ Visconti. In November of the following year he became Captain General of the Papal Army, receiving half the fief of Onano in the Marche. In 1359, always for Albornoz, he directed the military operations against Forl√¨ and Forlimpopoli, which were stormed in July. The following year Giovanni Visconti da Oleggio, lord of Bologna, declared war on Bernab√≤ Visconti, but was forced to ask (in exchange for the lordship over his city) the help of Albornoz, who sent Pietro Farnese to take possession of it. In 1361 he recovered Lugo, Bagnacavallo and Solarolo, but in June he had to return to the defence of Bologna, menaced by Visconti. The latter was defeated the following month. In 1362 he was appointed as Commander of the Florentine Army in the war against Pisa.

After a season he left the club. =Verona= On 8 June 2016, Fossati was signed by Verona on loan, with an obligation to sign. As part of the deal, goalkeeper Rafael moved to opposite direction in a definitive deal. On 20 June 2017, Cagliari confirmed the selling of Fossati to Verona outright. =Monza= On 5 January 2019, he signed a 1.5-year contract with Monza.  International career  Fossati started his youth international career in a training camp for players born in 1992 and 1993. He then played his first match in Saarland quadrangular tournament. He played all three matches in 2009 U-17 Euro qualifying,http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/under17/history/season=2009/round=15211/match=302127/index.html and all three matches in the elite round. In the final round Azzurrini lost to Germany in semi-final, but still qualified for 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup. At the World Junior Cup, he played all five matches. After a call-up to Italy U-19 team in September 2010, he never received a call-up again. Fossati returned to international teams from 2012 to 2013.

Trithionic acid (H2S3O6), tetrathionic acid (H2S4O6) are simple examples. They are the conjugate acids of polythionates. The compounds of n < 80 are expected to exist, and those of n < 20 have already been synthesized. Dithionic acid (H2S2O6) does not belong to the polythionic acids due to strongly different properties.  Nomenclature  All polythionates anion contains chains of sulfur atoms attached to the terminal SO3H-groups. Names of polythionic acids are determined by the number of atoms in the chain of sulfur atoms: * ‚Äì dithionic acid * ‚Äì trithionic acid * ‚Äì * ‚Äì , etc.  History  Numerous acids and salts of this group have a venerable history, and chemistry systems, where they exist, dates back to the studies John Dalton devoted to the behavior of hydrogen sulfide in aqueous solutions of sulfur dioxide (1808). This solution now has the name of Heinrich Wilhelm Ferdinand Wackenroder, who conducted a systematic study (1846). Over the next 60‚Äì80 years, numerous studies have shown the presence of ions, in particular tetrathionate and pentathionate anion ( and , respectively).  Preparation and properties  react with or , forming thiosulfuric acid , as the analogous reaction with forms disulfonomonosulfonic acid ; similarly polysulfanes H2Sn (n = 2‚Äì6) give HSnSO3H. Reactions from both ends of the polysulfane chain lead to the formation of polysulfonodisulfonic acid HO3SSnSO3H. Many methods exist for the synthesis of these acids, but the mechanism is unclear because of the large number of simultaneously occurring and competing reactions such as redox, chain transfer, and disproportionation. Typical examples are: * Interaction between hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide in highly dilute aqueous solution. This yields a complex mixture of various oxyacids of sulfur of different structures, called Wackenroder solution. At temperatures above 20 ¬∞C solutes slowly decomposes with separation unit sulfur, sulfur dioxide, and sulfuric acid. ::H2S + H2SO3 -> H2S2O2 \\\\+ H2O ::H2S2O2 \\\\+ 2 H2SO3 -> H2S4O6 \\\\+ 2 H2O ::H2S4O6 \\\\+ H2SO3 -> H2S3O6 \\\\+ H2S2O3 * Reactions of sulfur halides with or , for example : :: SCl2 \\\\+ 2 ‚Üí [O3SSSO 3]2‚àí \\\\+ 2 HCl :: S2Cl2 \\\\+ 2 ‚Üí [O3SS2SO3]2‚àí \\\\+ 2 HCl :: SCl2 \\\\+ 2 ‚Üí [O3SS3SO3]2‚àí \\\\+ 2 HCl Anhydrous polythionic acids can be formed in diethyl ether solution by the following three general ways: : HSnSO3H + SO3 ‚Üí H2Sn+2O6 (n = 1, 2 ‚Ä¶ 8) : H2Sn \\\\+ 2 SO3 ‚Üí H2Sn+2O6 (n = 1, 2 ‚Ä¶ 8) : 2 HSnSO3H + I2 ‚Üí H2S2n+2O6 \\\\+ 2 HI (n = 1, 2 ‚Ä¶ 6) Polythionic acids with a small number of sulfur atoms in the chain (n = 3, 4, 5, 6) are the most stable. Polythionic acids are stable only in aqueous solutions, and are rapidly destroyed at higher concentrations with the release of sulfur, sulfur dioxide and - sometimes - sulfuric acid. Acid salts of polythionic acids do not exist. Polythionate ions are significantly more stable than the corresponding acids. Under the action of oxidants (potassium permanganate, potassium dichromate) polythionic acids and their salts are oxidized to sulfate, and the interaction with strong reducing agents (amalgam of sodium) converts them into sulfites and dithionites. Occurrence Polythionic acids are rarely encountered, but polythionates are common and important. Polythionic have been identified in crater lakes. The phenomenon may be useful to predict volcanic activity.

Written shortly after his departure from The Times, it is particularly critical of the newspaper's owner, Rupert Murdoch. The allegations contained within the book resulted in questions being asked in Parliament. Critics regarded the book as well-written but partisan and were divided as to how convincing they found the arguments it contained. The book was re-issued in 2011 with an updated preface in the wake of the News International phone hacking scandal. Contents Good Times, Bad Times can be thought of as divided into two sections, the good and bad times of the title. For Evans, the good times happened during his editorship of the Sunday Times under The Thomson Corporation. The bad times started in 1981 when News International purchased both the Sunday Times and The Times and Evans was persuaded to leave the Sunday Times in favour of editing The Times. The move was not a happy one and Evans left the paper in 1982. Evans combines a personal record of his editorship of both papers with his philosophy of journalism and a scathing attack on News International, Rupert Murdoch and the Conservative government. The book details the Sunday Times campaign to ensure that the British victims of thalidomide were properly compensated. It also covers the paper's publication of uncensored portions of the diaries of Richard Crossman, a former Labour minister. The paper's reporting of the crash of Turkish Airlines Flight 981 outside Paris in 1974 and the subsequent investigations into its cause are covered, as are the investigations into Kim Philby's spying on his own government as part of the Cambridge Five. Evans also relates his memories of the last days of the Sunday Times under the control of the Thomson Corporation. The book makes a number of accusations against Rupert Murdoch, News International and the Conservative government. Evans suggests that Murdoch disliked him and wished to dispose of his services. Evans as editor of the Sunday Times was in a powerful position. According to Evans, Murdoch offered him the editorship of The Times, a more prestigious position but one where he was unfamiliar with the staff, making him vulnerable and easier to remove from the organisation altogether. Response =Politicians= Evans' accusations that John Biffen had misled Parliament concerning the financial position of The Sunday Times immediately before Rupert Murdoch's purchase of the paper led to questions being asked on the floor of the House of Commons. Biffen strongly denied partiality adding, in a written answer to the House, that \\"I do not consider that the material in Mr. Harold Evans' recent book \\"Good Times, Bad Times\\" adds significantly to the information available to me or my advisers at the time of the decision.\\" =News International= News International stated that it had not been involved with either the preparation or interpretation of figures concerning the financial position of either The Times or the Sunday Times. Both News International and Times Newspapers rejected Evans' allegations that they had attempted to procure government employment for him from the Prime Minister. Times Newspapers also rejected the allegations that minutes from an important board meeting had been falsified. =Critics= Arnold Kemp of the Glasgow Herald called Good Times, Bad Times, \\"an honest and passionate book, written in anger, as readable as a thriller\\". Writing in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Wil Haygood called the book \\"emotional, yet solid\\". He described it as \\"a telling inside look at Rupert Murdoch's style of publishing and...worthwhile reading\\". R. W. Apple Jr., writing in the New York Times, called it \\"an engrossing and cautionary tale\\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, also of the New York Times, found the book strongly reminiscent of Indecent Exposure, an account of power struggles within the film company Columbia Pictures Industries. However, unlike Indecent Exposure, which was written by an outsider, the journalist David McClintick, Good Times, Bad Times was written by an insider. Lehmann-Haupt felt that \\"For all the integrity it manifests...it leaves one with the sense that Mr. Evans is serving his own cause even more fervently than that of honest journalism.\\" Also writing in the New York Times, R. W. Apple Jr. called the book \\"unapologetically one-sided, a cry of pain from a proud man who thinks he was conned and is still too wounded to see the other side of the story\\". Reviewers found Evans' argument that Murdoch had forced him out because he did not support Margaret Thatcher enough to be unconvincing. Lehmann-Haupt called it not \\"fully satisfying\\" and suggested that Evans had portrayed Murdoch as Iago, \\"a character of motiveless malignity\\". Critics were divided on whether or not they believed Evans' allegations that Murdoch had interfered with the editorial line of The Times. R. W. Apple Jr. regarded Evans' position as \\"seem[ingly] unassailable\\", however, writing in Time, Paul Gray said that Evans' case against Murdoch was \\"not wholly convincing\\", citing a lack of evidence.

Pauls history can be traced back to 1923. The company has been known under various names, including Queensland United Foods Ltd (QUF), Pauls Ice Cream & Milk Ltd and Pauls Limited. In 1998, Pauls Limited was purchased by the Italian company Parmalat, and officially changed its name in 2003 to Parmalat Australia Ltd. The company currently has its headquarters in South Brisbane. Today, Pauls is an Australia brand name under the Parmalat umbrella; a subsidiary of the multinational French company Lactalis. Origins The company was registered as Pauls Polar Perfections Pty Limited on 13 June 1933 with paid up capital of ¬£900 by Edward Stokes, who was still involved in 1951 as managing director of the operating company Pauls Ice Cream and Milk Ltd. The name has been written as Pauls, Paul's, and Pauls'. 1930s The company in 1933 sponsored the Pauls' 4BC Party at the Brisbane City Hall. In 1937, the North Rockhampton premises of Paul's Polar Perfections Pty Ltd suffered notable damage due to a fire. Pauls Polar Perfections Limited went from being a proprietary concern to a publicly listed company. With its cold storage, the company also embraced fruit syrup manufacture and required new equipment. Directors of the company are Messieurs G. Andrew (wholesale milk vendor), T. W. Biggs (solicitor), W. A. Jolly MHR (accountant), and E. Stokes (managing). Subject to the regulations of the Brisbane Milk Board, suppliers' milk was subjected to chemical analysis, and examination for bacteria. Pauls Ice Cream and Milk Ltd was now registered as a wholesale milk vendor. The Milk Supply Act came into existence in late 1939. 1940s The company still only young in 1946 wrote about its origins, Pauls Ice Cream & Milk Ltd. : a history. Many companies benefited from transportation contracts with Pauls, including Bill Bolton's Cobb & Co. Redman Transport across the Darling Downs. Pauls Milk and Ice Cream Ltd planned a ¬£150,000 construction and plant extension to create powdered milk. It meant milk suppliers did not need to sell excess supplies to butter factories. In the post war period, steel supply however was considered an issue that might delay construction. In the late 1940s and 1950s Pauls milk was delivered in a glass bottle with a characteristic squared shape and gold- colored metal cap, which first appeared in July 1948. A job with the company included staff superannuation and social amenities. Employees were employed under the Ice Making, Ice-cream Making, and Cold Storage Award, Southern Division (Eastern District), where the union was seeking to change the temperature of a freezer room to 1 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F), and workers would not start before 6.00 am. 1950s Pauls Milk Ltd in 1953 commenced building two powdered milk processing plants at South Brisbane, Brisbane. Its benefits included assistance to those persons on non-fat diets, assisting persons in remote areas unable to access fresh milk, cooking versatility, and another option when whole milk shortages occurred. Various Pauls depots existed around Brisbane including at the suburbs of Rocklea and Coorparoo. Several other milk companies in Brisbane at the time included the United Milk Vendors Pty Ltd and United Vendors' Milk Distributors. Pauls was from around 1956 the dominant supplier of milk products to Darwin, where for many years they had a batching plant for producing reconstituted milk, combined with some locally sourced fresh milk, for supply to the \\"Top End\\". Today In January 2020 the company was awarded a Queensland Health tender to supply the Metro North Hospital and Health Service with milk, yoghurt and other products. A small public protest indicated Maleny Dairy should have been favoured under the government procurement policy of 'Buy Queensland' local purchasing, as Pauls was part of the French-based Lactalis company. During the course of its history, Pauls product line has evolved. At one time it also produced ice cream but at present concentrates on dairy lines such as milk and cream, custard, yoghurt, and a line of milk and juice beverages.  Awards  Queensland United Foods (QUF) was inducted into the Queensland Business Leaders Hall of Fame in 2013, in recognition of its success as a listed Queensland public company and its outstanding contribution to the national dairy industry through innovations in production technology, products and marketing.

Many drugs have been discovered to treat the disease but mutations in the virus and resistance to the drugs make development difficult. Integrase is a viral enzyme that integrates retroviral DNA into the host cell genome. Integrase inhibitors are a new class of drugs used in the treatment of HIV. The first integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, was approved in 2007 and other drugs were in clinical trials in 2011.  History  The body uses its immune system to protect itself from bacteria, viruses and other disease-causing beings, and when it fails to do so immunodeficiency diseases occur. One such disease is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) which is most commonly a result of an infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Two closely related types of HIV have been identified, HIV-1 and HIV-2. While HIV-2 is spreading in India and West Africa, HIV-1 is more virulent and the number one cause of AIDS worldwide. Though some of the patients have different results in most cases people infected with HIV go on to develop AIDS and ultimately die of opportunistic infections or cancer. Integration to the retroviral genome is critical for gene expression and viral replication. The viral genome is reversely transcribed into the DNA of the infected cell by viral reverse transcriptase, the DNA is then integrated into the host-cell chromosomes with the aid of the viral integrase. RNA transcripts are produced from integrated viral DNA and serve both as mRNAs to direct the synthesis of viral proteins and later as RNA genomes of the new viral particles. Viral particles escape from the cell by budding from the plasma membrane, each enclosed in a membrane envelope. In this process HIV-1 integrase is essential and therefore a very promising target for anti-AIDS drug design. Selective drug design is a possibility as HIV-1 integrase has no known cellular equivalent. Many integrase inhibitors have been discovered and designed but only a few of the molecules were developed further and got as far as phase II or phase III of clinical trials. Raltegravir (brand name Isentress) was granted accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2007 and from EMEA (now EMA) in December 2007. It was marketed as an antiretroviral drug (ARV) for HIV-1 infected adults who had already been exposed to a minimum of three ARV classes and showed multi- drug resistance. In general there are two main groups of integrase inhibitors; Integrase Strand Transfer inhibitors (INSTI) and Integrase Binding Inhibitors (INBI). INSTIs restrain the binding of pre-integration complex (PIC) and host DNA and INBIs restrain integrase and viral DNA binding. Raltegravir is an INSTI integrase inhibitor which inhibits both HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication. It is more potent than other previously known integrase inhibitors as well as causing less side effects. Raltegravir, Elvitegravir, Dolutegravir, and Bictegravir are the only HIV-1 integrase inhibitor being used to treat HIV infections S/GSK1349572.  The HIV-1 integrase enzyme  The HIV-1 integrase (IN) is a key enzyme in the replication mechanism of retroviruses. It is responsible for the transfer of virally encoded DNA into the host chromosome which is a necessary event in retroviral replication. Since IN has no equivalent in the host cell, integrase inhibitors have a high therapeutic index as they do not interfere with normal cellular processes. = Structure = IN belongs, both mechanistically and structurally, to the superfamily of polynucleotidyl transferases 10 and is composed of 288 amino acids that form the 32 kDa protein. Retroviruses encode their enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase) with the POL gene with the 3¬¥end encoding for IN. Figure 1: Structural domains of the HIV-1 integrase IN is composed of 3 structurally independent, functional domains (see figure 1).: 1\\\\. The N-terminal domain (NTD) encompasses amino acids 1‚Äì50 and contains two histidine residues (His12 and His16) and two cysteine residues (Cys40 and Cys43), all of which are absolutely conserved and form a HHCC zinc-finger motif. Single mutations of any of these four residues reduce IN enzymatic activity. The HHCC zinc-finger motif chelates one zinc atom per IN monomer. The NTD is required for higher order multimer formation which appears to be its primary role. The multimerization requires zinc atom that stabilizes the fold. 2\\\\. The catalytic core domain (CCD), which encompasses amino acids 51- 212, contains the active site of IN but it can't catalyze integration in the absence of NTD and CTD (the C-terminal domain). CCD contains three absolutely conserved negatively charged amino acids; D64, D116 and E152. These amino acids form the DDE motif that coordinate divalent metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+). These metal ions are essential for the catalysis of integration. CCD has a mixed Œ≤ and Œ± structure with five Œ≤-sheets and six Œ± helices that are linked by flexible loops. The flexible loops allow conformational changes that are required for 3¬¥processing of the viral DNA and strand transfer (STF) reactions which are two key steps of the integration reaction. CCD is essential for these steps and substitution of any of the residues in the DDE motif dramatically inhibits the activity of IN. 3\\\\. The C-terminal domain (CTD), which encompasses amino acids 213‚Äì288, binds DNA nonspecifically and its interaction with NTD and CCD is required for IN 3¬¥-processing and strand- transfer activities. CTD is the least conserved of the three domains. IN acts as a multimer and dimerization is required for the 3¬¥-processing step, with tetrameric IN catalyzing the strand-transfer reaction. = Function = HIV-1 integration occurs through a multistep process that includes two catalytic reactions: 3¬¥endonucleolytic processing of proviral DNA ends (termed 3¬¥processing) and integration of 3¬¥-processed viral DNA into cellular DNA (referred to as strand transfer). In 3¬¥processing IN binds to a short sequence located at either end of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the viral DNA and catalyzes endonucleotide cleavage. This results in elimination of a dinucleotide from each of the 3¬¥ends of the LTR. Cleaved DNA is then used as a substrate for integration or strand transfer. Strand transfer is a trans- esterification reaction involving a direct nucleophilic attack of the 3¬¥hydroxy group of the two newly processed viral 3¬¥-DNA ends on the phosphodiester backbone of the host target DNA. This leads to covalent insertion of viral DNA into the genome of the infected cell. Strand transfer occurs simultaneously at both ends of the viral DNA molecule, with an offset of precisely five base pairs between the two opposite points of insertion. The integration reaction is completed by removal of unpaired dinucleotides from the 5'- ends of the viral DNA, repair of the single-stranded gaps created between the viral and target DNA molecules and ligation of 3'-ends to 5'-ends of the host DNA. Divalent metals, Mg2+ or Mn2+, are required for 3'-processing and strand transfer steps as well as for assembly of IN onto specific viral donor DNA to form a complex that is competent to carry out either function. Because the abundance of magnesium (Mg2+) versus manganese (Mn 2+) in human cells is 1,000,000-fold, magnesium seems a more readily available divalent cofactor for integration.  Mechanism of action  Figure 2: Integration of viral RNA into host cell DNA There are several ways to target integrase but strand transfer inhibition is the most intuitively obvious and readily pursued to date. Other targets include, for example, the protein domains beyond the active site of IN. The domains interact with viral or host DNA and are important for binding to the enzyme. It is possible to hamper functions of the enzyme by disrupting or removing these bindings. PIC is a multimeric protein structure inside the host cell, composed of both viral and host proteins. Integrase is a part of PIC‚Äòs viral component. PIC‚Äòs viral and host proteins are believed to modulate intrinsic activity of the enzyme, shuttle PIC to the nucleus and direct integration of viral DNA into a transcriptionally active region of the host genome. If it were possible to exclude certain proteins from the PIC it would block the ability of the virus to integrate into the host genome. The process where the retroviral RNA is transcribed to DNA and then integrated into the host cell's genome is shown in figure 2. = IN strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) = Mg2+ and Mn2+ are critical cofactors in the integration phase. Inactivating these cofactors (e.g. through chelation) causes functional impairment of IN. This concept gives researchers the opportunity to design and develop highly efficient IN inhibitors (INIs). In fact, all small molecule HIV-1 INIs that are now being researched contain a structural motif that coordinates the two divalent magnesium ions in the enzyme‚Äôs active site. Raltegravir and elvitegravir share the same mechanism of action against integrase: to bind to the active site of Mg2+ ions. Competitive inhibitors compete directly with viral DNA for binding to integrase in order to inhibit 3‚Äò-end processing. In doing this the inhibitors completely block the active site from binding to target DNA. This inhibition is called strand transfer inhibition. = Inhibition of the LEDGF/p75- integrase interaction = Lens epithelial derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) is a host protein that binds to integrase and is crucial for viral replication. The mechanism of action is not precisely known but evidence suggest that LEDGF/p75 guides integrase to insert viral DNA into transcriptionally active sites of the host genome. Inhibitors of this protein are already being developed and patented. They are likely to be highly target specific and less prone to the development of resistance. = IN binding inhibitors = Another class of INIs could be IN binding inhibitors (INBIs) such as V-165. V-165 is a compound shown to inhibit integration but without obvious effect on viral DNA synthesis. When the mechanism of action was studied it showed that V-165 interferes with viral DNA-IN complex formation. Due to its interfering action it is classified as an IN binding inhibitor. Other compounds, such as styrylquinolines share similar mechanism by competing with the LTR substrate for IN binding.  Drug design  = Binding = INSTIs bind tightly and specifically to the IN that is associated with the ends of the DNA by chelating the divalent metal ions (Mg2+) which is coordinated by the catalytic triad i.e. the DDE motif. The DDE motif is located in the CCD of IN and is the active site of the enzyme and hence INSTIs are so called active site inhibitors. INSTIs bind to a specific site close to the DDE motif of IN, a site that is present only in the conformation that occurs after processing of the 3¬¥ viral DNA ends. Viral DNA may well form a part of the inhibitor binding site. The binding is a form of allosteric inhibition as it implies blockage of a specific integrase-viral DNA complex. This results in selective inhibition of the strand-transfer reaction, with no significant effect on the 3¬¥-processing reaction. INSTIs may therefore be more specific and bind selectively to the target DNA binding site and hence be less toxic than bifunctional inhibitors that are able to bind to both the donor and target binding sites. INBIs also bind to IN but the mechanism of action is unknown so the binding can not be detailed. = Structure activity relationship (SAR) = Figure 3: Structure activity relationship of elvitegravir and raltegravir. A benzyl group in a hydrophobic pocket and a triad to chelate the two Mg2+ ions. Two structural components are necessary for integrase binding: a hydrophobic benzyl moiety that buries into a highly hydrophobic pocket near the active site; and chelating triad that binds with two Mg2+ ions in a rather hydrophilic region, anchoring the inhibitor onto the protein surface (see figure 3). In fact, all potent integrase inhibitors possess a substituted benzyl component that is critical for maintaining 3‚Äòend joining potency. Removal of the benzyl group prevents inhibitory function. Lipophylic substituents are therefore beneficial for the strand transfer inhibition, in particular the thiophenyl, furanyl and (thiophen-2-yl)phenyl substitutions. Heteroaromatic amine and amide also cause increase in 3‚Äò processing inhibitory action. Figure 4: Examples of integrase inhibitors. When catechol-based inhibitors of IN were researched it was observed that maintaining a planar relationship with the bis-hydroxylated aryl ring increases potency. The inhibitory activity could be further optimized by including a meta-chloro substituent, enhancing the interaction of the benzyl group with the adjacent hydrophobic pocket (see figure 4: Structures A-G). A benzyl substituted hydroxyl group (fig. 4 H) improves metal-chelating capability (compared to structure J in fig. 4) while a methoxy group (I) is much less potent due to steric clash by the additional methyl group with the catalytic metals. When researching diketo derivates, the central pyrrole ring of structure K in fig. 4 was replaced by a series of aromatic systems having various substitution patterns. That provided optimum relative orientation of the benzyl and diketoacid (DKA) site chain. Structure L in fig. 4 resulted in 100 fold increase in potency. Benard et al (2004) synthesized INIs with a quinoline subunit and an ancillary aromatic ring linked by functionalized spacers such as amide, hydrazide, urea and hydroxyprop-1-en-3-one moiety. They found that the amide group containing dervivatives were the most promising ones. By synthesizing series of styrylquinones researchers found out that a carboxyl group at C-7, a hydroxylgroup at C-8 in the quinoline subunit and an ancillary phenyl ring (Figure 4: Structure M) are required for inhibition, although alterations of the ring are tolerated. Two hydroxyl groups on the ancillary phenyl ring are also required for inhibitory potency. = Pharmacophore = Figure 5: Binding of DKAs to DDE amino acid residues of integrase Since critical structure information is scarce on HIV integrase catalysis it is difficult to find the exact pharmacophore for its inhibition. Wang et al (2010) hoped that by studying the SAR and pharmacophore of a dual inhibitor scaffold, focusing both on integrase and reverse transcriptase (RT) it would be possible to observe anti-integrase activity. By studying the SAR of HIV integrase inhibitors it was possible to find that for optimal integrase inhibition the pharmacophore requires a regiospecific (N-1) DKA of a specific length. A DKA functionality or its heterocyclic bioisostere that selectively inhibit strand transfer seem to be present in all major chemotypes of integrase inhibitors. As detailed in the SAR discussion above the two necessary structural components of INI are a benzyl hydrophobic moiety and a chelating triad to bind the Mg2+ ions. For the triad to bind the Mg2+ ions has to be ionized (see fig. 5) and thus a pharmacophore bioisostere has to be ionized too and the benzyl pharmacophore bioisostere must to be very hydrophobic. However, despite previous success in clinical development (raltegravir), a detailed binding model is lacking so it has proven difficult to structure base the design of integrase inhibitors. When the pharmacophore of salicylic acid and catechol were merged, new chemical scaffolds were created. The adjacent hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on salicylic acid could bind with the metal ions and serve as their pharmacophore. Polyhydroxylated aromatic inhibitors are mostly active against strand transfer reactions and 3‚Äò-processing which suggests a mechanism that targets both steps. This is a very important part of the compound as it can be used to bind to the divalent metal on the active site of IN and as such be effective against viral strains that are resistant to strand transfer specific inhibitors. = Resistance = It has been discovered that over 60 variations of INSTI mutations cause in vivo and in vitro resistance. Due to these mutations and development of resistance the inhibitors are less effective against the virus. Resistance of INI corresponds to those of other ARV drugs. First IN resistance is caused by primary mutations that decrease INI sensitivity in combination with secondary mutations that further reduce virus sensitivity and/or repair decreased fitness of the virus. Secondly there is a genetic barrier to INI resistance, defined by the number of mutations required for the loss of clinical INI activity. Thirdly there is extensive but incomplete cross-resistance among the INIs. A loop containing amino acid residues 140‚Äì149 is located in the catalytic-core domain and is important for IN function as mentioned before. This loop is flexible and even though its role is not quite known it is thought to be important and its functions critical for DNA binding. This resistance appears within mutations in this IN-coding region. The resistance to raltegravir and elvitegravir is primarily due to the same two mutation pathways but other primary mutations are also involved for each of the drugs. Some mutations increase resistance to the drugs to a large extent than others. For example, one of the most common mutation pathway increases the resistance to raltegravir up to 100 times more than the second most common one. Resistance to Integrase Inhibitor S/GSK1349572 is still being developed and the resistance has not been fully characterized. When it was assessed alongside the primary mutations of raltegravir and elvitegravir it did not show cross-resistance which means that it could be useful against drug resistant viruses. Raltegravir has limited intestinal absorption and thus resistance cannot be overcome by prescribing higher doses. Newer drugs are warranted to overcome this pharmacological disadvantage and gain plasma concentrations high enough to target raltegravir-resistant viruses.  Current status  Figure 6: Structure of MK-2048 with important pharmacophore highlighted The search for new ways to improve treatment of patients infected with HIV is constant. Considering the experience that has been gathered since the 1980s of ARV drug development arrival of INSTIs as a new potent class of ARV signals a new era in the treatment of HIV. Development of a successful INSTI treatment was accomplished when raltegravir was discovered by Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited. A conditional marketing authorization was licensed in December 2007 by the European Commission which was valid throughout the European Union. In 2009 this authorization was converted to a full marketing authorization and in the same year the FDA changed the approval from accelerated to traditional approval and listed the drug as a first line ARV treatment agent. The second INSTI drug, elvitegravir, was identified by Japan Tobacco and clinical trials began in 2005. In 2011 the drug was still in phase three clinical trials, where it is being compared to raltegravir, in treatment experienced subjects and is also in phase two development in na√Øve subjects as a part of a multidrug treatment. S/GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor discovered by ViiV/Shinongi which was entering phase three in clinical trials in 2011. This new drug is promising and seems to be well tolerated and so far shows better results than both raltegravir and elvitegravir. Since there have been problems with resistance to raltegravir and elvitegravir, scientists have started to work on new second generation integrase inhibitors, such as MK-2048 which in 2009 was developed by Merck. It's a prototype second generation INSTI that remains potent against viruses containing mutations against raltegravir and elvitegravir. The mechanism of action and SAR of MK-2048 is the same as of the other INSTIs, the structure of MK-2048 shown in figure 6 with essential pharmacophore highlighted. Even though drugs discussed above are promising the development has a long way to go and many things are still unknown about the efficacy, safety and mechanism of action of these drugs.

It is a low-growing annual herbaceous plant in the genus Lysimachia of the family Primulaceae. In a comparison of DNA sequences, L. foemina was shown to be most closely related to L. monelli. It had been thought by many to be closest to L. arvensis, and some authors had even included L. foemina as a subspecies of L. arvensis, as Anagallis arvensis subsp foemina.Clapham, Tutin, & Warburg: Flora of the British Isles, 2nd edition, page 435 These three species (L arvensis, L foemina and L monelli) were among several transferred from Anagallis to Lysimachia in a 2009 paper. Etymology The previous genus name Anagallis derives from the Greek words ' meaning \\"again\\" and ' meaning \\"to delight in\\", possibly referring to the fact that these plants produce flowers twice in a year and the flowers open whenever the sun strikes them.Malta Wild Plants The species epithet ' means \\"female\\" and refers to the small size of the plant and the gentleness of its appearance. The common name refers to the fact that the flowers close at the approaching of the bad weather.Trek Nature Description Lysimachia foemina has weak, square and sprawling stems growing to about long,Pignatti S. - Flora d'Italia ‚Äì Edagricole ‚Äì 1982. Vol. II, pag. 291 which bear bright green sessile leaves in opposite pairs. The leaves are usually lance-shaped about wide and long, although some leaves, especially the lowest, may be ovate. The small flowers are about in diameter, have a short stalk, are produced in the leaf axils and are usually blue. They have five lanceolate sepals and five petals. The filaments are about long, with showy yellow anthers. The flowering period extends from April to October. The hermaphroditic flowers are pollinated by insects (entomogamy). The fruit is a spherical capsule up to in diameter containing about 15 seeds. This species is very similar to the related Lysimachia arvensis, and has been regarded as a subspecies of L arvensis. In 2007, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that Lysimachia foemina is more closely related to Lysimachia monelli than to Lysimachia arvensis, and should be treated as a separate species. Lysimachia foemina can be distinguished from Lysimachia arvensis on the basis of the hairiness and arrangement of the petals and by the length of the flower stalk. This species has just a few glandular hairs on the margins of the petals, clearly separated from one another (never imbricate). Furthermore the flower stalk is shorter (). The colour of the flowers is not a useful diagnostic character. Distribution This cosmopolitan plant is native to central and southern Europe and has been introduced in Africa, northern and eastern Asia, North and South America and western Australia. Habitat It grows in scrub, uncultivated soils and grasslands. It prefers dry, nutrient- and lime-rich soils, at an altitude of above sea level.

Pascoe St Leger Grenfell (1798-1879) was a British businessman and patron, and a key backer Second Annual Report of the Colonization Commissioners for South Australia, 1837 of the South Australian Company. He was a committee member of the South Australian Church Society, and is known for donation of an acre of land on North Terrace, Adelaide which was used for the construction of the Holy Trinity Church ‚Äî one of the first churches built in the city and the colony. He also donated 40 acres of land for the use of the church as glebe lands. This land later became the suburb of Trinity Gardens. Grenfell Street, Adelaide was named after him. Dickey, B: Holy Trinity Adelaide 1836-1988: the history of a city church, Trinity Church Trust Inc., 1988History, www.trinitycity.church Biography Pascoe St Leger was the second son of Pascoe Grenfell (1761‚Äì1838) and Georgiana St Leger and grandson of Pascoe Grenfell (1729‚Äì1810) and St Leger St Leger, 1st Viscount Doneraile. He was born 5 November 1798 in London, died 27 March 1879 in Nottingham, and was buried in the family vault in Taplow, Buckinghamshire. He was schooled at Eton College. He married twice, having 9 children by his first wife, one of whom was Field Marshal Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell. Following the death of his father in 1838, Grenfell took control of Pascoe Grenfell & Sons, his father's and grandfather's copper and tin smelting businesses on the River Tawe, Swansea, Wales. He was a benevolent, progressive thinker with moderate approaches to human labour, free trade, health and education. South Australian Church Society Pascoe St Leger Grenfell along with another South Australia Company Director Raikes Currie, William Wolryche-Whitmore and Reverend Sir Henry Robert Dukinfield were key committee members of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts (SPG) and were all involved with the establishment of South Australia as a free colony. In the mid 1830s Grenfell was involved with the South Australian Church Society, an organisation primed to generate funds for the construction of churches and employ ministers in the new colony of South Australia. Colonel William Light, the Surveyor General of the new colony and the City of Adelaide, had authority to select land for the South Australian Church Society. He selected the site where Holy Trinity Church stands on North Terrace. Pascoe St Leger Grenfell transferred Town Acre No. 9 (order no. 171) for the building of the Holy Trinity Church, Adelaide and 40 acres of country land for 'glebe' lands in an area that later became the suburb Trinity Gardens. Grenfell had purchased the land in December 1835 for 12 shillings but by March 1836 had donated it for the church. The entire donation had an estimated value of 70 shillings and made him the largest private contributor to the venture.

Litchfield‚Äôs goal for the Center was to strengthen the University‚Äôs ‚ÄúInternational Dimension,‚Äù particularly with regard to Latin America. Litchfield cited Latin America's ‚Äúimportant economic, social and political ties with the United States‚Äù in advocating for the establishment of a Center. With a five-year, $1.5 million grant from the Ford Foundation awarded in 1964, Litchfield hired political scientist Cole Blasier to direct the founding of the Center. Blasier worked in conjunction with the University's history, political science and sociology departments to form CLAS. The original coalition of these three distinct departments provided the lasting example of interdisciplinary cooperation that defines the Center today. Each semester, over 120 Pitt professors in over 20 different departments teach more than 250 courses on Latin America and the Caribbean. Economist Carmelo Mesa-Lago became the Center's second director in 1977, and while under his direction CLAS was officially designated a National Resource Center in Latin American Studies in 1979. The designation provided further funding and national recognition for CLAS.Center for Latin American Studies (CLAS) Website ‚Äì http://www.ucis.pitt.edu/clas/publications CLAS has been continuously funded by the US Department of Education as a National Resource Center since 1979. Following Mesa-Lago, other directors were Mitchell Seligson, William Dewalt, Kathleen Musante, Scott Morgenstern. Eduardo Lozano Latin American Library Collection Eduardo Lozano, founder and director of the Latin American Library Collection The Collection's Latin American Reading Room in Hillman Library The collection was created and primarily built by Eduardo Lozano, a librarian, artist, poet, and author from Argentina who directed the Latin American Library from its creation until his death in 2006. Needing an organized resource center for CLAS, and with the help of Henry Hillman‚Äôs donation to the University for the new Hillman Library, Cole Blasier hired Lozano to establish a Latin American library collection in 1967. Lozano traveled annually throughout Latin America to buy books directly from the source. The collection was officially named the \\"Eduardo Lozano Latin American Library Collection\\" by the university in 1997 and today is the eighth largest collection of Latin American resource materials in the United States and includes over 500,000 volumes, 12,000 periodical titles, 110,000 reels of microfilms, 540 films and video recordings, and 630 sound recordings. More than 85% of the volumes are in Spanish or Portuguese and the collection's resources on Bolivia and Cuba are considered some of the world's best. Over 400 libraries, research centers, universities, and governmental departments based in various locations around the world maintain exchange agreements with the collection. In 2002, a Latin American inspired reading room, housing a portion of the Lozano Collection, was dedicated in the university's Hillman Library. Composed of arches and columns with windows on three sides, the room was designed by Peruvian-American architect Victor Beltran to be reminiscent of a Spanish courtyard. Undergraduate and graduate programs Since 1968, CLAS has offered undergraduate students a program in Latin American studies. Students work towards receiving a certificate in Latin American studies in conjunction with their bachelor's degree. Graduates of the program therefore obtain interdisciplinary knowledge and field study in the Latin American region. These graduates have become administrators in the United Nations, state and federal government officials, Peace Corps and Catholic relief service volunteers, foreign service officers in Argentina, Brazil, and other countries, Spanish teachers, and many other professionals in a variety of fields. The graduate program at CLAS is aimed at doctoral or master's students who want to incorporate a specialization in Latin America into their studies. Candidates for the graduate certificate must be proficient in Spanish, Portuguese, or an Amerindian language. Currently, four semesters of Quechua are offered to fulfill the Amerindian language requirement. Two courses in the student's major department and four courses in at least two departments outside are required for completion of the program, as is an interdisciplinary research paper in the field of Latin American studies. CLAS educational and public service outreach As a National Resource Center on Latin America, the Outreach Program at CLAS plays a leading role in sharing information and resources on Latin American studies to educators of all academic levels and disciplines. CLAS' Outreach Program offers educational expertise from college level educators to kindergarten through secondary classes. In addition, CLAS seeks to provide resources to the professional community and the general public as part of its educational public service outreach mission. Outreach programs are offered throughout the academic year and include professional development workshops, study abroad opportunities, faculty development seminars, summer research fellowships, curriculum development projects, school visit programs, a resource lending library, and lecture and film series. The center also published two in-house newsletters, CLASicos and Las Noticias, and in concert with the University of Pittsburgh Press, its faculty and staff are often involved in helping to produce scholarly publications and journals covering a range of Latin American topics. In addition, the center also hosts the website Panoramas which provides an on-line venue for a dialogue and academic discussion of Latin American and Caribbean issues. Since 1980, CLAS has also hosted an annual Latin American and Caribbean Festival.

Biography Boleslav Markevich was born and died in Saint Petersburg, a member of a noble Russian family of Polish descent. He spent his early years in Kiev and Volynskaya gubernia and received good home education.

Russkaya Starina. No. 8, 1891. P. 288. Markevich, who was close to government circles and was among the most ardent of Mikhail Katkov's right-wing allies, caused much controversy by depicting real life political and popular figures in his prose, the latter serving as a source of rumours, consumed avidly by the public. Praised by conservatives (among them Konstantin Leontiev who compared his trilogy to War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy) and hated by revolutionary democrats (whom he made a point to paint in the blackest possible tones, insisting that for the 'progressivist' disease \\"the whip is the best cure\\"). Markevich made his mark in the history of 19th century Russian literature as a tendentious novelist, and a friend of Katkov. He's found himself at the center of at least two scandals, the first caused by his highly publicised row with Ivan Turgenev, the second having to do with alleged bribery (which he denied). Markevich's literary gift, though, has never been doubted; his books, which were widely read in Russia (notably by members of the monarch's family) and translated into many languages, contain, according to the 1990 Russian Writers dictionary, \\"priceless documentary material and are still in need of objective analysis.\\"  Select works  * Marina from Aly Rog (–ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –∏–∑ –ê–ª–æ–≥–æ –†–æ–≥–∞, 1873) * Two Masks (–î–≤–µ –º–∞—Å–∫–∏, 1874, novelet) * A Quarter of a Century Ago (–ß–µ—Ç–≤–µ—Ä—Ç—å –≤–µ–∫–∞ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥, 1878, 1st part of the trilogy) * Princess Tata (–ü—Ä–∏–Ω—Ü–µ—Å—Å–∞ –¢–∞—Ç–∞, 1879, novelet) * The Forester (–õ–µ—Å–Ω–∏–∫, 1880, novelet) * The Turning Point (–ü–µ—Ä–µ–ª–æ–º, 1881, 2nd part of the trilogy) * The Void (–ë–µ–∑–¥–Ω–∞, 1884, 3rd part of the trilogy, unfinished). = Compilations = * Short Stories and Novellas (1883, Saint Petersburg) * The Complete Markevich in 11 volumes (1885, Saint Petersburg; 1912, second edition, Moscow).

Greystanes work was later continued by William de Chambre through the year 1539.Grandsen Historical Writing p. 520 There were four different Geoffreys who became members of the Durham cathedral chapter in the correct time frame, and one of these was the chronicler, as Coldingham was a dependent priory of Durham. Besides the chronicle, it is possible that Geoffrey was the author of two hagiographies about Bartholomew of Farne and Godric of Finchale, which were composed in the late 12th century. The chronicle and its various continuations have been published by James Raine and the Surtees Society as Historiae Dunelmensis Scriptores Tres, Gaufridus de Coldingham, Robertus de Graystanes et Willielmus de Chambre in 1839.

It is a National 4A Level Scenic Spot, as well as part of the National Patriotism Education Base, and the Nanjing Relic Protection Unit. History Jinghai Temple (Temple of the Calm Sea) was built in 1416 by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty to honor Zheng He, a court eunuch, explorer, and envoy, who traveled to India and sailed as far as the east coast of Africa several times. It was one of Nanjing's largest and most lavishly decorated temples, originally built as a dedication to the Goddess of the Sea, Tianfei. It was named by the Emperor after a young woman from the Fujian province who miraculously rescued sailors whose boats had gone adrift on the high seas. In June 1840, Great Britain declared war on China, the First Opium War, and in 1842, British troops invaded Nanjing. The Qing government discussed a treaty with the British government four times in Jinghai Temple. On August 29, the Qing government signed the Nanjing Treaty, which is the first unequal treaty in modern Chinese history, on a British navy ship. Therefore, Jinghai Temple became a symbol of the beginning of Chinese modern history. By the time of the Republican Period, after the Taiping Rebellion and the destruction of traditional architecture during the Cultural Revolution, the temple had almost disappeared. The only remaining part of the original temple is a stele which was built and inscribed by the Yongle emperor himself. The museum was built next to a large outcropping rock known as Sansuyan (Three Night Crag) where the Southern Song general Yu Yunwen moored his fleet for three nights on his return trip after defeating the Jin army in Anhui province. It is also a place that offers the Arhat portraits of Buddha, relics of the Buddha and jade wares, etc. Jinghai literally means \\"peace and ocean\\" in Chinese, which indicates blessings for the people who are at sea. During the past five centuries, Jinghai Temple has undergone disasters and warfare. In 1987, it was rebuilt to 628 square meters in the style of the Ming dynasty. Since it could not be the same as the original one, Jinghai Temple was called Old Jinghai Temple Site. In 1990, the Nanjing government decided to make it a public place, Nanjing Treaty Historical Exhibition Museum, in order to remind the Chinese people to not forget the history. At the end of 1996, to celebrate Hong Kong‚Äôs return, the local government invested a significant amount to rebuild it a third time. It was expanded to 2800 square meters, emulating the Jiangnan garden style. In 1997, Jinghai Temple was honored as one of 100 National Patriotism Education Bases.

In 2014 the cliffs at Millook Haven were voted by the Geological Society of London as one of Britain's top 10 geological sites, leading the \\"folding and faulting\\" category. The cliffs display an impressive series of recumbent chevron folds, in Carboniferous age killas of inter-bedded sandstones and shales, originally deposited in deep water. The stony beach is popular with surfers despite there being few parking spaces and the South West Coast Path passes through the seaward end of the valley. The ancient semi- natural woodland has been described as the best ravine wood in Cornwall and along with the coast is within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Millook Valley Woods The woodland runs roughly north-south from the A39 at Wainhouse Corner to the coast at Millook Haven. It consists of four separate properties now owned by the Woodland Trust; Crannow Coombe and Lundy Woods, Tamps and Landy, Trebarfoote and Trengayor Copse, as well as some private owners. With the exception of Trebarfoote the woods are mainly on the western slopes of the valley. Described in a 1993 report to the JNCC as the ‚Äúbest ravine wood in Cornwall‚Äù the site was previously listed as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Most of the woods are ancient semi-natural woodland but only Trebarfoote and the valley bottoms are officially designated as such. When compared to the Ordnance Survey map published in the 1930s the woodland is now much larger. =Flora and fauna= Adjacent to the streams there is a wet alluvial soil and willow carr. The trees in the valley bottoms are mainly old coppice and maiden oak (Quercus petraea) with some ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus). On the mid to upper slopes there is increasing amounts of sycamore with a mixture of blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) on clayey loam, and at the top invading bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), bramble (Rubus fruticosus) and gorse (Ulex europaeus). The surrounding area is mainly agricultural. Other tree species found are alder (Alnus glutinosa) in the wetter areas and a few small areas of wild cherry (Prunus avium) and wild service (Sorbus torminalis). Aspen (Populus tremula) and beech (Fagus sylvatica) on old boundary hedges are presumed to be planted.

Background At the 1950 general election, George Daggar held his seat for the Labour Party. He defeated the challenger from the Conservative Party, O.J. Lewis, with a majority of 25,206. By September that year, Dagger was too ill to attend votes at the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, including one on the steel debate opened by Winston Churchill; the largest opposition vote since 1924. Dagger was one of only two MPs not to be present, alongside Harold Roberts for the Conservative Party. Although around the same time, Dagger was said to be showing signs of improvement. Following his death, the seat was re-contested. =Candidates= The candidates put forward by the parties were the Rev. Llywelyn Williams for Labour, and Richard Body for the Conservative Party. Williams resigned his ministry of the Welsh Congregational Church at Abertillery in order to contest the seat. Body did not have any local links, and had contested the Rotherham constituency at the 1950 general election. Result The by-election was held on 30 November, with the result announced the following day. It was the same day as the by- election in the Bristol South East constituency. Williams held the seat for the Labour Party, with 26,622 votes and a share increase by just over half of one percent, while Body received 3,839 and saw his share decrease by the same amount.

Stone circles The name Nine Maidens comes from two Early Bronze Age stone circles which stood 18m apart on the downs. There was a belief that the stones were originally young women turned to stone for dancing on the Sabbath. Originally the south-east circle was 16m across with 14 or 15 stones. Half of this circle survives with a semicircle of five stones, four of which are free standing and the other is built into the Cornish hedge in its original position. At least one other stone still exists but was moved to build the hedge. The north-west circle had a diameter of about 21m. Two of its stones remain in the hedge but may not be in their original positions. William Borlase noted 10 stones of this circle remaining circa 1760. Hangman's Barrow Half a mile west of the stone circles, on a prominent ridge, is the massive Bronze Age cairn of Hangman's Barrow. The cairn, built entirely of stone, is 3m high and 20m in diameter.

Geography To the east is the former mining town of Camborne and to the north is the Penzance to Plymouth railway line. West of the village is the Penponds Viaduct which carries the railway over the Roseworthy valley and to the south is the village of Barripper. History Neolithic flints were found at Penponds and are in the Camborne museum. In June 1880 approximately 40 to 50 Bronze Age socketed axes were found in a pit at Viaduct Farm, Higher Roseworthy following the blasting of a large rock to level the ground for a pig-sty. The hoard is now distributed in private collections and between museums in Camborne and Truro. A granite clapper bridge of unknown antiquity is south-west of the village in the Roseworthy valley, as is the site of a post-medieval corn mill which was named on a tithe map from 1725. The most likely site for Penpons manor house and chapel is at Ivy Cottage in Higher Penponds which has \\"fragmentary door frame surrounds\\" of the front left window of the cottage, which appears to be the remnants of a 15th-century rectangular L-shaped building. An inquisition was held in the manor of Penpons and Baripper in 1421 at the Chapel of Blessed Marie of Penpons and in 1445 a licence for divine service was given to Richard and Amisia Penspons. It is likely they were living in the manor house at that time. Two teenage boys from the area were ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Lacey of Exeter in the early part of the sixteenth century. These two local priests where quite possibly the last Catholic clergy in the area at the time of the Reformation. North of the village is the extant remains of the Penponds incline, the original course of the first railway line in west Cornwall. The Hayle Railway ran between the harbours of Hayle and Portreath and the mining town of Redruth. Following purchase by the West Cornwall Railway the incline was closed on 16 February 1852, the railway line realigned via the Penponds Viaduct and re-opened on 25 August 1852. Notable residents Higher Penponds Farm Cottage was the childhood home of the mining engineer, Richard Trevithick (13 April 1771 ‚Äì 22 April 1833).

Pennsylvania, 941 F.2d 224 (3d Cir. 1991), was a case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that confirmed the validity of special elections held without a primary under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The case came about due to the death of H. John Heinz III, one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania, in a plane crash on April 4, 1991. Under the Seventeenth Amendment, state legislatures may give the Governor the power to appoint officials to fill temporarily vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held, and Pennsylvanian law contained a statute executing this and requiring no primaries for the special election. Instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidates. John S. Trinsey Jr., a voter and potential candidate, asked the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to declare the statute unconstitutional as a violation on the Fourteenth and Seventeenth amendments, because the lack of a primary removed his right to properly vote for candidates and delegated that power to political parties. After deciding that the statute's subject matter necessitated the strict scrutiny approach, the District Court decided on June 10, 1991 that it was an unconstitutional violation of the right to vote for and select Senate candidates. This decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, who decided against the use of the strict scrutiny approach and, in its absence, ruled that the statute was not a violation of the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments. Academics have been critical of both the decision reached and the approach used, with one suggesting that the \\"substantial state interests\\" test used in Valenti v. Rockefeller (1968) would be more appropriate.Gold (1992) p.216 Background Senator H. John Heinz III, whose death and subsequent replacement led to Trinsey v. Pennsylvania On April 4, 1991 H. John Heinz III, one of the US Senators from Pennsylvania, was killed when his chartered plane collided with a helicopter inspecting its landing gear. Under the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the legislature of each state has the power to permit the governor to fill the vacant seat until a special election can be held.Vile (2010) p.197 In Pennsylvania, this power had been delegated, and Governor Robert P. Casey signed a writ on May 13, 1991, declaring November 5 the date for a special election and temporarily appointing Harris Wofford to fill Heinz's now-vacant seat.Gold (1992) p.202 Under Pennsylvanian law, there was no need for a primary in such a situation; instead, both the Democrats and Republicans would each internally select their candidate, who would run in the special election. John S. Trinsey Jr., a member of the Pennsylvanian electorate and potential candidate, challenged the constitutionality of this law, claiming that it violated his rights under the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments.Gold (1992) p.203 Trinsey argued that, by failing to allow for primaries, the state legislation prevented him from getting to select a candidate of his choice, and that this violated the Fourteenth Amendment; the terms of the statute (and absence of a requirement for primaries) also allegedly infringed the rights of the electorate under the Seventeenth Amendment, which required the selection of Senators by popular vote; Trinsey's complaint was that the legislation had effectively delegated the power to choose candidates to political parties rather than the electorate.Novakovic (1992) p.940 Accordingly, Trinsey filed a motion for a declaratory judgment to state that the statute was unconstitutional, and also requested that Wofford be removed from his seat. Counsel for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, joined by the office of the Governor, argued that the constitution did not require the holding of primary elections to fill vacancies, and that the statute \\"protected valid and compelling state interests in protecting the validity of the electoral process and limiting the term of a [governor-]appointed Senator\\". Judgment The case was first heard in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where, following oral arguments, the judge dismissed both Trinsey's motion to remove Wofford and the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss. On June 10, 1991, however, the District Court declared the statute unconstitutional, stating that it violated both the Fourteenth and Seventeenth Amendments due to the failure to ensure \\"popular participation\\" through the use of primary elections.Little (1991) p.630 This decision was reached following an analysis of the legislative history of the Seventeenth Amendment and electoral processes; based on this analysis, the court concluded that the Pennsylvanian use of a nomination process before a special election implied a right to vote, which was violated by the lack of a primary and necessitated a strict scrutinising of the legislation. After considering the evidence, the court concluded that \\"the interests the Commonwealth put forth in support of the statute could not outweigh the infringement of the right to vote\\", leading to the conclusion that the statute governing special elections was unconstitutional.Gold (1992) p.204 With this \\"the public, press and political parties quickly turned their attention to the case\\", with the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania (supported by their Democratic counterparts) and several prominent politicians intervening. They moved to expedite an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In a unanimous opinion, the Court of Appeals (consisting of Sloviter, Greenberg and Seitz) confirmed that there was no restriction of any fundamental right, and therefore that the strict scrutiny process did not need to be applied. In the absence of this process, they held that the Seventeenth Amendment did not require primary elections to fill vacancies, and more broadly gave state legislatures wide discretion as to how to hold elections; as such, the statute did not violate the constitution.Novakovic (1992) p.945 In December 1991 the Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari, presumably because the special election had already taken place in November and the issue was thus moot.Novakovic (1992) p.955 Significance Laura E. Little, writing in the Temple Law Review, notes the dearth of guidance for either the District Court or Court of Appeals in Trinsey, with no \\"explicit direction and no direct precedent\\" from either the constitutional provisions or prior case law to rely on.Little (1991) p.631 In the absence of guidance, the Court of Appeals took a narrow view of the issues, something she criticises. Under Pennsylvanian law, primaries are mandatory in all other elections,Little (1991) p.635 and in her opinion the lack of a primary in this case should have been judged to be a violation of Trinsey's fundamental rights. Combined with the purpose of the Seventeenth Amendment - to ensure direct election - this should have led to the application of the strict scrutiny test, and the decision that the statute governing special elections was unconstitutional.Little (1991) p.636 Kevin M. Gold instead suggests that the test used in Valenti v. Rockefeller, an analogous decision over the validity of New York state electoral law. In Valenti, the judiciary applied the \\"substantial state interests\\" test, which involves simply looking at whether the statute in question furthers the interests of the states, who under the Seventeenth Amendment are given some discretion as to the electoral process they use.Gold (1992) p.216 References Bibliography  * External links * Category:1991 in United States case law Category:United States Fourteenth Amendment case law Category:United States Seventeenth Amendment case law Category:United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit cases Category:Pennsylvania special elections Category:United States Senate elections in Pennsylvania Category:Primary elections in the United States Category:1991 in Pennsylvania ","title":"Trinsey v.

The lower part of the valley is owned by the National Trust and was once the site of a stone industry that exported carved ornaments to the rest of Britain and Europe. Geography The Poltesco stream drains the southern part of Goonhilly Downs and reaches the sea at Carleon Cove on the east coast of the Lizard. At the head of a small tributary, on the downs, are the remains of South Wheal Treasure copper mine, working in 1823. The walls of three or four large buildings, including an engine house, can still be seen. A lode has not been located. The streams flows through a wooded valley and discharges at Carleon Cove on the east side of the Lizard Peninsula. Less than 1 km to the north-east is the beach at Kennack Sands and 1 km to the south-west the village of Cadgwith. The South West Coast Path, which follows the coast of south-west England from Somerset to Dorset, crosses the Poltesco stream at Carleon Cove. The valley forms part of the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and is within the Caerthillian to Kennack Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The tree and shrub cover makes Poltesco an unusual feature of the windswept peninsula. History From the early 14th century to the late part of the 19th century, there was an important fishery operating out of Carleon Cove which included a pilchard fishery documented from the early part of the 18th century to the early part of the 19th century. Many of the buildings were reused by the late 19th- century serpentine factory. The only visible evidence of the fishing industry is the round, roofless building in the cove, housing the capstan which was used to haul boats out of the water. A water mill and mill pool () still survive on the southern side of the valley, built mostly in the 18th and 19th centuries and possibly dating back to the 14th century. There is a crucifixion figure carved inside the building which may be medieval. The waterwheel dates from the 1870s. =Lizard Serpentine Company= The first written evidence of worked serpentine is from 1828, when a Mr Drew of Penzance, who was repairing the Lizard Lighthouse, carved serpentine in his spare time. It is likely that he learnt it from a long-established local tradition. Serpentine had been used locally for dwellings, farm buildings, stiles, etc., and to build several church towers such as at Mullion and Landewednack. A tour of the Penzance serpentine works, in 1846, by Prince Albert and the royal family, resulted in an order for mantelpieces and pedestals for Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. Interest in serpentine products continued to increase following The Great Exhibition of 1851, which was visited by six million people and showcased products from all of the world. The Lizard Serpentine Company built a factory at Poltesco in 1855 and later increased the buildings to include a showroom, warehouse and offices. The walls were of snecked serpentine blocks, and the roof had clay ridge tiles and a scantle slate roof. The company had a showroom on the Strand, London, where there was a vase on display. Stone came from local quarries by cart, and the finished stoneware was ferried in flat- bottomed barges to schooners offshore. The company was wound up in 1870 and relaunched as the Poltesco Marble Company. =Demise of the serpentine industry= Notably, the Poltesco Marble Company omitted the word ‚Ä≤serpentine‚Ä≤ from its name. A water wheel, built by Mr Toy of Helston, was completed in 1881 and according to The Cornishman newspaper the large showroom was ‚Ä≥well worth a visit and was filled with carvings of all sorts, shapes, sizes and values‚Ä≥. By 1883 the factory had reduced its workforce to twenty men and three boys, and the products were smaller and less grand, although another report in The Cornishman newspaper stated that the showrooms were well worth a visit. There was a number of factors for the demise of the industry. The serpentine rock used for carving came from small seams within a larger mineral complex, and the search for unflawed large pieces of rock exhausted the small quarries, which raised costs. Fashions change, serpentine was no longer a novelty and its poor weathering qualities made it unsuitable for outside use. In 1893 the company was wound up due to falling demand, and the uninsured loss at sea of finished products. Machinery of value was sold off, and the buildings were abandoned, to leave walkers on the coastal footpath to view a post-industrial landscape. During the First World War, some of the buildings were requisitioned as a carpenter's workshop and children's playroom. The water wheel remained in use for chaffing until 1917, when it was removed. Between the wars the site was considered for a holiday camp, and some of the works were partially demolished in 1923 with explosives. Carleon House was leased to the manager Herbert Cohen in 1889, and his daughter bought it and lived there until 1947. The house and valley now belong to the National Trust. Remains can still be seen on the shore of Carleon Cove along with the roofless capstan from the fishing industry.

It lies 0.6 miles east of Crowntown and 2.6 miles west of Wendron by road. It is divided into Lower Prospidnick and Higher Prospidnick. History Various spelling have been documented including Prospynneck, 1577; Prospynnecke, 1606; Prispynneck, Pryspinneck, c.1625; Prespynick, 1636; Prispidnick, 1665; Prospinnick, 1841, 1842; Prospidneck, 1884; and Prospidnick since 1996. Historically, it was known for its granite hills; and the Propidnick Wheal Mine and quarry operated in the area. In 1916, the Prospidnick Mining Company was reportedly interested in mining in Nancegollan. Geography The Prospidnick Long Stone Along with Prospidnick, there are several other villages in Sithney parish; these include Guavas, Mellangoose, Higher and Lower Prospidnick, Tregoose, Trevarnoe, and Truthal. The region is characterized by rock, granite, wolfram and tinstone. The easternmost of the two great granitic tracts in West Cornwall extends from Prospidnick and Nancegollan in the west to Ponsanooth and Budock to the east, and from near Polwheveral in the south to Wheal Butter to the north. Much of Longstone Downs was turned into tillable ground in the early 1880s by Mr R G Rowe who had a 99-year lease on the higher portion of Prospidnick Hill. Some of the surrounding area was not suitable for crops, Mr Bickford-Smith planted several acres of shrubs ‚Ä≥ ... which, it is hoped, will in a few years tend to relieve the monotony of the present appearance of the long stretch of the Prospidnick Hills.‚Ä≥ Notable landmarks Prospidnick Manor once belonged to the Arundells, then Christopher Wallis and in 1872 was reported to be in the property of his representative C W Popham. The Prospidnick Long Stone is a high standing stone, a large granite menhir, on Longstone Down, northeast of Prospidnick Hill. There is also logan stone (the Men Amber) and an overgrown cromlech. The Cornish Heart Unit Fund has a building in the village. To the southwest there is a church called Chynhale Methodist Chapel. Some of the buildings in Prospidnick are cottages dated to the 18th century with thatched roofs. Another landmark in Prospidnick is the Prospidnick Arch, a railway bridge that is part of the local Helston Railway. It is reported to be 40 feet (12 m) high and cost ¬£1,000 in the early 1880s.

The book is the third book in the George series, following George's Secret Key to the Universe and George's Cosmic Treasure Hunt. George and the Big Bang is available in paperback, hardback and audio versions. Plot After coming back to the United Kingdom, George and Annie are trying to find the best place in the universe for Freddy the pig to live. They first look in the fictional Foxbridge University where Eric is a professor. Once there, they head up into a meeting of an anti-LHC group, which states that the theory of everything resists addition of gravity (TOERAG). Eric uses Cosmos, a supercomputer, to open a portal and takes Freddy to this unknown place. The next day, George starts at the local high school, but returns to the University to find Eric in order to ask him where Freddy has gone. George discovers that Cosmos' portal is still open and wanders out on to the Moon to find Eric. Just before they leave, a Chinese satellite photographs them. However, since no one has supposedly stepped foot on the moon since 1972, this creates outrage among the Order of Science. Eric's tutor, Zuzubin, calls a meeting of the Order of Science at CERN. Meanwhile, Dr. Reeper returns and activates his supercomputer Pooky so he can meet George in Andromeda via his electromechanical avatar. Dr. Reeper tells George that he has infiltrated TOERAG, the anti-LHC group. He also admits that he was forced to create a quantum mechanical bomb which cannot be defused easily, but luckily only has a probability to defuse if the right switch is activated. Dr. Reeper fails to pass on the complete information on how to deactivate the bomb, but he does tell George that the Order of Science has a traitor and that the meeting at the LHC is actually a plot to destroy all the scientists and the LHC using his bomb. Meanwhile, Annie has got a new friend: Vincent, a karate black belt and the son of a film director.

The nearby hamlet of Rinsey Croft is located 1 km to the north-east.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End The nearby cliffs and beach are owned and managed by the National Trust and part of Rinsey East Cliff is designated as the Porthcew Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) for its geological interest. The South West Coast Path passes through the property. Rinsey lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). History Rinsey, in the Hundred of Kerrier, is mentioned in the Domesday Book as one of four Manors in the parish of Breage, under the name of 'Rentis'. The population in 1086 was 9.5 households. In the 29 April 1880 edition of The Cornishman Rinsey was listed as one of the places in the Helston area with a fishing fleet. =Mining= Wheal Prosper, () on Rinsey East Cliff, started operating in 1860 possibly as an extension of Wheal Trewavas mine, 800m to the east on Trewavas Cliff (). The mine is on the southern end of the Tregonning granite within the Wendron Mining District. By the time Prosper closed in 1866 it had produced mostly tin and a little copper from the Porthcew lode. The prominent house on Rinsey Head is often said to have been the mine's count house (offices), it was built in the late 1920s and early 1930s by Mr G A Gibb, a London stockbroker, after he bought the land from Mr Bucket, a local farmer. Designed as an Arts and Craft style holiday home, rock had to be blasted in order to build the foundations, taking four years to build with stone from a local quarry. The New Penrose Tin and Copper Mining Company Ltd, which mined Trewavas Head went into liquidation in 1882. Natural history In 1990 part of Rinsey Cliff was notified as the Porthcew SSSI for the mineral assemblage caused by the granite contact zone on the Upper Devonian Mylor Slates. The contact zone is also a Geological Conservation Review site of national importance. Trewarvas Head is the site of a black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) colony usually with thirty-five nesting pairs although numbers can vary with just six active nests (all failing) in 2013. Other breeding birds include European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) and European herring gull (Larus argentatus).

It is sometimes applied to the growth of bureaucracy in an organization. History Articulated by Cyril Northcote Parkinson as part of the first sentence of an essay published in The Economist in 1955 and since republished online, it was reprinted with other essays in the book Parkinson's Law: The Pursuit of Progress (London, John Murray, 1958). He derived the dictum from his extensive experience in the British Civil Service. A current form of the law is not the one to which Parkinson referred by that name in the article, but rather a mathematical equation describing the rate at which bureaucracies expand over time. Much of the essay is dedicated to a summary of purportedly scientific observations supporting the law, such as the increase in the number of employees at the Colonial Office while the British Empire declined (he showed that it had its greatest number of staff when it was folded into the Foreign Office due to a lack of colonies to administer). He explained this growth using two forces: (1) \\"An official wants to multiply subordinates, not rivals,\\" and (2) \\"Officials make work for each other.\\" He noted that the number employed in a bureaucracy rose by 5‚Äì7% per year \\"irrespective of any variation in the amount of work (if any) to be done.\\" Parkinson's Law was translated into many languages. It was highly popular in the Soviet Union and its sphere of influence. In 1986, Alessandro Natta complained about the swelling bureaucracy in Italy. Mikhail Gorbachev responded that \\"Parkinson's law works everywhere.\\" Corollaries The first-referenced meaning of the law has dominated, and sprouted several corollaries, the best known being the Stock‚ÄìSanford corollary to Parkinson's law: Other corollaries include Horstman's corollary to Parkinson's law, coined by Mark Horstman of website manager-tools.com: the Asimov corollary to Parkinson's law: as well as corollaries relating to computers, such as: Generalization The law can be generalized further as: An extension is often added: This generalization has come to resemble what some economists regard as the law of demand ‚Äì namely, the lower the price of a service or commodity, the greater the quantity demanded. This is also referred to as induced demand. Someone defined the law in regard to time as:  Formula  x=\\\\frac{2k^m+L}{n} *x ‚Äì number of new employees to be hired annually *k ‚Äì number of employees who want to be promoted by hiring new employees *m ‚Äì number of working hours per person for the preparation of internal memoranda (micropolitics) *L ‚Äì difference: age at hiring ‚àí age at retirement *n ‚Äì number of administrative files actually completed Related efficiency Parkinson also proposed a rule about the efficiency of administrative councils. He defined a \\"coefficient of inefficiency\\" with the number of members as the main determining variable. This is a semi-humorous attempt to define the size at which a committee or other decision-making body becomes completely inefficient. In a chapter is devoted to the basic question of what he called comitology: how committees, government cabinets, and other such bodies are created and eventually grow irrelevant (or are initially designed as such). (The word comitology has recently been independently invented by the European Union for a different non-humorous meaning.)Oxford English Dictionary Empirical evidence is drawn from historical and contemporary government cabinets. Most often, the minimal size of a state's most powerful and prestigious body is five members. From English history, Parkinson notes a number of bodies that lost power as they grew: * The first cabinet was the Council of the Crown, now the House of Lords, which grew from an unknown number to 29, to 50 before 1600, by which time it had lost much of its power. * A new body was appointed in 1257, the \\"Lords of the King's Council\\", numbering fewer than 10. The body grew, and ceased to meet when it had 172 members. * The third incarnation was the Privy Council, initially also numbering fewer than 10 members, rising to 47 in 1679. * In 1715, the Privy Council lost power to the Cabinet Council with eight members, rising to 20 by 1725. * Around 1740, the Cabinet Council was superseded by an inner group, called the Cabinet, initially with five members. At the time of Parkinson's study (the 1950s), the Cabinet was still the official governing body. Parkinson observed that, from 1939 on, there was an effort to save the Cabinet as an institution. The membership had been fluctuating from a high of 23 members in 1939, down to 18 in 1954. A detailed mathematical expression is proposed by Parkinson for the coefficient of inefficiency, featuring many possible influences. In 2008, an attempt was made to empirically verify the proposed model.. Parkinson's conjecture that membership exceeding a number \\"between 19.9 and 22.4\\" makes a committee manifestly inefficient seems well justified by the evidence proposed. Less certain is the optimal number of members, which must lie between three (a logical minimum) and 20. (Within a group of 20, individual discussions may occur, diluting the power of the leader.) That it may be eight seems arguable but is not supported by observation: no contemporary government in Parkinson's data set had eight members, and only the unfortunate king Charles I of England had a Committee of State of that size.  Other topics  Other chapters relate to what time to arrive at a cocktail party, how best to select applicants, what is the best age to retire, and \\"injelitance\\": the disastrous rise to authority of individuals with an unusually high combination of incompetence and jealousy expressed in the chemical formula I3J5.

The neighborhood landmark is a very grandiose gate consisting of two big white pillars which stand at each side of the gate. The design of the neighborhood is unique. It is a mixture of Jiangnan gardening and modern society. It is created in the Jiangnan style in Nanjing, a city at the north of the Yangtze River.  Transportation  There is a bus stop at the gate. About seven routes stop at this bus stop. They are No. 105, No. 10, No. 18, No. 180, No. 154 with two special buses called \\"route Ê∏ÖÂÆâ\\", from Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥Èó®Â§ßË°ó to Andemen(). Another bus is \\"route Ê≤≥Â••\\". Between the Jiangning Customs Building and the neighborhood, there is a freeway leading to many places, such as Nanjing South Railway Station and Nanjing Lukou International Airport. Also, there is direct freeway access to Yuhuatai Memorial Park of Revolutionary Martyrs. Since ancient times, Zhonghua Gate has been the border dividing the city into urban and country. The government is building the Metro Line 3. After completion in 2014, there will be more than 13 routes, with access near to the neighbourhood.  Features  = Virescence = The house is designed by a famous architect. The neighborhood contains a lake and many trees and it makes the neighborhood seem like a park. The acreage of Virescence takes up 80% of the neighborhood. Many kinds of trees are planted in the neighborhood, such as poplar, Firmiana simplex, willow and others. Besides the trees in the neighborhood, there are also many flowers, including gardenias (Chinese:Ê†ÄÂ≠êËä±), roses, peach blossoms, and orchids. = Lake = The lake is one of the most representative sites in the neighborhood. As lake springs from the Qinhuai River, the water quality is very good. Some people who enjoy fishing come to the lake and fish, usually for recreation. Sometimes, there are several mallards swimming alone the lake. Also some unidentified birds fly over the surface of the lake, dipping into the water at times. In winter, the lake partially freezes. If it is cold enough, it will make ice strong enough to support the weight of many people who can walk and skate on it. = Swimming pool = The swimming area is located at the west of the lake, with two swimming pools available. One is large, having both deep and shallow water area. This pool is usually available to adults or teenagers, who are able to swim. The depth of deep water area is nearly 6.56 feet and the shallow area is 3.28 feet. Another one is comparatively small, especially for children who are under 6, and less than 1.64 feet tall. During summer holiday, there is a training agency set up a class teaching children how to swim. = House = Houses in this neighborhood are distinctive, with three types, covering an area of 60 mu. The gross area is 270 mu, while the development area is 138 thousand square meters. The houses are small with green space is up to 75% of the gross area, but the building density is only about 19.26%, that is, in one apartment there is only one \\"busy\\" with the rest five are \\"free\\". So it likes a park more rather than a neighborhood. Houses are divided into three parts marked by the color of the roof. They are red, green and Grey. Most people live in green roofed houses typicallyof about 100 square meters, suitable for a couple with a child. The price per square meter is about 12000 yuan, comparatively cheaper than others in Nanjing nowadays. The red houses are, built around the lake but separated from it by a line of villas. The red houses are about 200 square meters, usually available to a couple with a kid and also with their parents. It is a kind of spring-layer house, having a Kitchen, a dining room, a Toilet, a balcony, an amusement room and a Drawing room in the first floor and two bedrooms, two Toilets, a restroom, a balcony in the second floor, with a 50-square-meter rooftop. There are only two Grey houses or villas, which seen from a distance, look like a house built in the Qing dynasty, with a stream winding through the garden. On the roof of the villa, there is a Satellite television, Before the villa, there is a lake. Such a beautiful scene will be seen form the top of the roof. Garden is the most attractive place. It has about 300 square meters. A pave built up by cobblestone, with bambooes planted on each side.  Surroundings  = Neighbourhoods = The neighbourhood is beside Jiangjun mountain, facing Cuiping lake. Many neighborhoods are around it. Named Â±±Ê∞¥ÂçéÈó®, Áà±Ê∂õÁø†ÊπñËä±Âõ≠ and ÁëûÊôØÊñáÂçé, a high-grade housing for the wealthy. On the right of the neighborhood, there is Jiangning Customs Building. = University = There are 3 parts in Nanjing especially for universities, usually called \\"city of university\\". As a big district in Nanjing, Jiangning District plays an important role in the construction of universities. Of course there are several universities near my neighbourhood. They are Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Zhengde College, Hohai University, Southeast University. During holidays, when thousands of students return home, the city of university looks like an empty \\"city\\". Because there is no basketball field in Jiangnanwenshuyuan in the past years, some people will go to these universities to play basketball. = Relaxation zone = Beside the city of university, there is a block called Tuolejia, with a lot of people live there and has a very big Suguo supermarket. There is a famous road in Jiangning district called Women's Road. It is near Jiangnanwenshuyuan. It serves as the market center and is a rather busy street. Many eateries, clothing stores, and a shopping mall are located along this road. = Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited = There is a bank beside my neighborhood. It opened at 8 am and closed at 5 pm. So we all have a credit card which made us have convenience to save or draw money. Also, Aitao relaxation zone is a place where people can have rest or some leisure, for example, yoga, Kung fu. It has a swimming pool, badminton court, and basketball court. Also, there is a bath center available to people. Overall, it is a place of relaxation. Jiangjun mountain is a scenic spot in Jiangning District. Its height is about 300 meters high. It is a place where people enjoy hiking, running, and climbing. In autumn, the maple trees lining the road display vibrant fall colors.

History  According to the three knives of Yangzhou, written by Wang Xianxin, public bathhouses appeared in Yangzhou as early as the beginning of the 11th century AD, in the Northern Song Yuanfeng area. During the Qing Dynasty Yangzhou's bath industry greatly developed. Xu Ning Zhang opened the first public bathhouse in Yangzhou. During the Chinese revolution, Yangzhou had 33 bathhouses. The number of bathhouses in Yangzhou then grew to more than 260. As of 2002, Yangzhou's bathhouse industry employed over 5,000 people. Its annual revenue exceeded 500 million yuan.

He was educated at the University of Paris, later specializing in tropical medicine. He then pursued a career in academia and in the pharmaceutical industry discovering and developing new drugs for the treatment of parasitic diseases such as halofantrine in the treatment of multidrug resistant Falciparum malaria or albendazole and nitazoxanide for the treatment of intestinal protozoan and helminthic infections.White, A.C. Editorial: Nitazoxanide: an important advance in anti-parasitic therapy. American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene. 2003: 68: 382-383 In 1993, he co-created his own pharmaceutical company, Romark Laboratories, L.C., to develop his own invention nitazoxanide, the first of the thiazolides. At Romark, he is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company and its Chief Science Officer. Following the discovery of the antiviral activity of the thiazolides Rossignol went to Stanford University in California to study interferon stimulated gene pathways and chronic viral hepatitis under Prof. Emmet Keeffe and Prof. Jeffery Glenn. It was in the Glenn laboratory that the mechanism of antiviral activity of nitazoxanide against the hepatitis C virus was discovered.Elazar, M., Liu, M., McKenna, S.A., Liu, P., Gehrig, E.A., Puglisi, J.D., Rossignol, J.F., Glenn, J.S. The Anti-Hepatic C Agent Nitazoxanide Induces Phosphorylation of eIF2-alpha via PKR Activation. Gastroenterology. 2009;137:1827-1835. Education Rossignol began to study chemistry at the University of Paris under Prof. Paul Cadiot and prepared a doctorate degree in synthetic organic chemistry in the Department of Chemistry of the Radium Institute in Paris, originally the division of Radiobiology and Cancer Research of the Pasteur Institute. Created in 1911 by the Pasteur Institute and the University of Paris, the Radium Institute was the place where two generations of Curies, first Pierre and Marie Curie, later their daughter, Ir√®ne Joliot-Curie, and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot, her husband, discovered natural and artificial radioactivity winning five Nobel prizes between 1903 and 1935. Profoundly marked by the Curie's legacy, Rossignol considered pursuing a career in nuclear physics. The Radium Institute and the adjacent Curie Foundation were also home to a major cancer hospital where Marie Curie and Claudius Regaud had initiated radiotherapy with the radium that Marie had discovered and where the first primitive treatments of cancer were applied, and ultimately, it was Rossignol's exposure to medicine during these years that would kindle his interest and determine his future orientation toward medical research. Nitazoxanide Upon the defense of his dissertation in chemistry at the University of Paris, he returned to school to study medicine. During his last year at the Radium Institute, Rossignol had met Raymond Cavier, then Professor of Parasitology at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Paris where he was heading the parasitology laboratory searching for new drugs for the treatment of malaria and intestinal parasites. Cavier had tested some of the compounds Rossignol synthesized for his doctorate degree in chemistry, and he offered Rossignol the opportunity to join his laboratory while continuing his medical education. It would prove to be a good decision, and in 1974 Rossignol and Cavier discovered nitazoxanide, the first of thiazolides.Rossignol, J.F. & Cavier, R. 2-benzamido 5-nitrothiazoles. Chemical Abstract. 1975; 83: 28216n and New Derivatives of 2-Benzamido 5-Nitrothiazoles. United States Patent No 3,950,351, April 13, 1976. Nitazoxanide was first tested in the Cavier's laboratory and was found effective against both intestinal protozoa and helminths in vitro or in laboratory animals and was first administered in humans in France in the treatment of Taenia saginata and Hymenolepsis nana in a small number of patients.Rossignol, J.F. & Maisonneuve, H. Nitazoxanide in the Treatment of Taenia saginata and Hymenolepis nana. American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene. 1984; 33: 511-512. Work in tropical medicine [In the early days of 1980, Rossignol met Prof. Pierre P√®ne in Marseille, France. P√®ne had spent his professional life in West Africa, first in Dakar in S√©n√©gal, later in Abidjan in C√¥te d'Ivoire where he had founded the country's first medical school and eventually became its first dean. From Marseille, P√®ne trained Rossignol in tropical medicine. In the meantime, the pharmaceutical giant, SmithKline & French Laboratories in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, aware of the work in parasitology carried out in the Cavier's laboratory in Paris, had put Rossignol in charge of developing the benzimidazole carbamate anthelminthic, albendazole, for the treatment of intestinal helminthiasis. From Marseille to Geneva, it was only a short trip to the Division of Parasitic Diseases at the World Health Organization under its director, Andrew Davis, and it would be there that two major antiparasitic drugs, praziquantel and albendazole, would be clinically developed. Praziquantel became a major advance in the treatment of schistosomiasis, effective against the five strains of the parasite. Albendazole was the first effective single dose nematocidal anthelminthic, one of the most widely used drugs in the developing world.P√®ne, P., Mojon, M., Garin, J.P., Coulaud, J.P. & Rossignol, J.F. Albendazole: a New Broad-spectrum Anthelmintic. Double-blind Multicenter Trial. American Journal of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene. 1982; 31: 263-266. Both medicines were included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Drugs. Rossignol would work with Davis for the next 10 years. While working with Cavier in Paris, Rossignol had also searched for antimalarial agents with the Antimalarial Drug Development Program of the United States Army Research & Development Command based at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington D.C. He completed the work initiated by the Army with the antimalarial, halofantrine, and conducted three well- controlled clinical studies in France, in Mali, a country in West Africa, and in French Guyana in South America for the treatment of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant Falciparum malaria, involving SmithKline & French Laboratories in the process.Maisonneuve, H., Joly, F., John, M., Carles, G. & Rossignol, J.F.

Treatment of Imported Cases of Falciparum malaria in France with Halofantrine. Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine & Hygiene. 1986; 80: 615-617. Albendazole and halofantrine received their regulatory approvals in the United States from the Food and Drug Administration under the trade names of Albenza¬Æ and Halfan¬Æ respectively and were licensed in a large number of countries around the world. They are still commercialized today by GlaxoSmithKline, Plc, the successor of Smith Kline & French Laboratories. Development of Nitazoxanide and Other Thiazolides In 1993, nitazoxanide was re-invented in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland as the first effective treatment for the emerging apicomplexan protozoa, Cryptosporidium parvum.Theodos, C.M., Griffiths, J.K., D‚ÄôOnfro, J., Fairfield, A. and Tzipori, S. Efficacy of nitazoxanide against Cryptosporidium parvum in cell culture and in animal models. Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. 1998; 42: 1959-1965. It was subsequently developed by Romark Laboratories, L.C. in both immunocompetent and immuno-suppressed individuals such as those with AIDS.Rossignol, J.F., Hidalgo, H., Feregrino, M., Higuera, F., Gomez, W.H., Romero, J.L., Padierna, J., Geyne, A., Ayers, M.S.

Treatment of Diarrhea Caused by Cryptosporidium parvum: a Prospective Randomized Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Study of Nitazoxanide. Journal of Infectious Diseases. 2001; 184:103-106 It would be eventually approved in the United States by the Food & Drug Administration under the trade name of Alinia¬Æ for the treatment of non-immunodeficient adults and children from 12 months of age. The serendipitous discovery of the antiviral activity of nitazoxanide and the discovery of its mechanism of action opened a new chapter in Rossignol's life and led to the discovery of an entirely new class of indirect antiviral drugs, acting in stimulating the production of interferons by the host's immune cells activating several interferon stimulated gene pathways known to block viral translation.Clerici M., Trabattoni D., Pacei M., Biasin M., Rossignol J.F. The anti-infective nitazoxanide shows strong immumodulating effects [abstract]. Journal of Immunology 2011;186: 155.21. More intriguing perhaps are the effects of thiazolides on adaptive immunity and more specifically on T Lymphocytes, B Lymphocytes and Natural Killer cells. It is the subject of intense research at Oxford University in the United Kingdom and at the National Institutes of Health in the United States and could lead to a new approach in the treatment of many other diseases such as AIDS but also some cancers or auto-immune diseases. Romark Laboratories quickly initiated the synthesis of hundreds of second generation thiazolides carried out in the United Kingdom at the University of Liverpool under Andrew Stachulski, and new derivatives are now entering clinical development in the treatment of viral diseases such as viral enteritis caused by rotavirus and norovirus, influenza and influenza like illnesses and chronic viral hepatitis B and C.Rossignol, J.F., Abou Zekry, M., Abeer Hussein & Santoro, M.G.

Since then, Burger King, and its Australian franchise Hungry Jack's have offered a variety of grilled chicken sandwiches, as have Wendy's and McDonald's. Their first grilled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, was one of the most successful product introductions in the fast food industry ever. It was reformulated as the Chicken Whopper (1992), named after their Whopper Sandwich. That was replaced by the BK Baguette (2004), promoted as health-oriented, which was in turn replaced with the larger, meatier TenderGrill sandwich (2005), targeted to more sophisticated, adult customers, notably 24- to 36-year-old males. The company sells different variants in different markets, using white meat chicken breast in some regions while using dark meat chicken thighs in others. To promote continuing interest in the product, Burger King occasionally releases limited-time (LTO) variants. As one of the company's major offerings, the grilled chicken sandwich is often featured in its advertising. Burger King has registered trademarks for its sandwiches in many markets. History = BK Broiler = Burger King's first broiled chicken sandwich, the BK Broiler, was introduced in 1990. It was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted roll. At that time, more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. By a month after its introduction, it was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. The sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18 grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce. The introduction of the BK Broiler was one of the most successful restaurant product launches ever, encouraging the company look into introducing additional products that would match the success of the Broiler. Its success helped Burger King increase its profit margin by 47% over the corresponding six-month period in 1989. By 1992, sales of the BK Broiler had slowed to half of their peak. The company reformulated the BK Broiler in 1998 into a larger, more male-oriented sandwich served on a Whopper bun, increasing its patty size while changing the ingredients to mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato. The idea behind the upsizing of the product was to give the customer a sense of value, with a company spokesman stating \\"When they [the customer] see a lot, it seems like they're getting a lot for their money, and even if they don't eat it all, they think they're being treated fairly.\\" The move was part of the company's \\"back to basics\\" movement in which it reorganized its menu, focusing on its core products and simplifying its product base. = Chicken Whopper = An example of the Chicken Whopper Jr. (left) and the Chicken Whopper. As part of the forty-fifth anniversary of its Whopper sandwich in 2002, BK introduced an updated version of the sandwich called the Chicken Whopper and added a smaller version called the Chicken Whopper Jr. sandwich, along with a new Caesar salad sandwich topped with a Chicken Whopper filet. The introduction of the Chicken Whopper represented the company's first move to extend the Whopper brand name beyond beef-based sandwiches since the original Whopper's introduction in the 1950s. The sandwiches featured a whole chicken breast filet, weighing either for the larger sandwich and a for the Jr., mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato on a sesame seed roll. A newly reformulated low fat mayonnaise was introduced in conjunction with the new sandwiches. Along with the company's new BK Veggie sandwich, The Chicken Whopper Jr. version of the sandwich was lauded by the Center for Science in the Public Interest as being one of the best nutritionally sound products sold by a fast food chain. Still, the CSPI decried the rest of the Burger King menu as being vastly unhealthy. Development of the sandwich began in 2001 in response to several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King held a series of consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of the sandwiches, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper was one of the few noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's too early to tell whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East. With its 2014 expansion into India, Burger King introduced the Chicken Whopper as one of three versions of the Whopper. The other two variants are the Mutton Whopper and the Veggie Whopper. = BK Baguette = 2nd US version of the TenderGrill chicken sandwich. In 2003, BK introduced its BK Baguette line of sandwiches designed to replace the Chicken Whopper. The sandwiches were introduced at the insistence of the new CEO, former Darden Restaurants executive Bradley (Brad) Blum, shortly after the company was acquired by TPG Capital in 2002. The sandwiches were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 or fewer calories. The line was a health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat. They were formally introduced in 2003 as its BK Baguette line of sandwiches, that replacing the Chicken Whopper sandwiches. The baguette sandwiches were introduced to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received and continue to be sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private public interest group Consensus Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK. = TenderGrill = The original version of the TenderGrill sandwich. The Baguette sandwiches failed to catch on in the American market, and as a result they were discontinued as part of a menu reorganization. In 2005, they were replaced by the TenderGrill sandwich. The new sandwich was one of several products that were designed to appeal to a group of customers Burger King identified as adult males, 24‚Äì36 years old that desired a larger, meatier product. = Chicken Burger = In December 2015, Burger King introduced the Chicken Burger in the U.S. This sandwich has a patty topped with the standard Whopper toppings of mayonnaise, lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup and onion on a toasted brioche bun. = Grilled chicken sandwich = In 2017, Burger King once again reformulated its grilled chicken sandwich, simply calling it the Grilled Chicken Sandwich. The new formulation changes out the brioche bun for a potato roll and a new seasoned chicken fillet. It was discontinued in 2019. = Competing products = Similar products from other chains have also been introduced, reformulated and generally been fluid in their presences in the marketplace since 1990. Despite the present day competitive products from multiple vendors, Burger King was the first national fast food chain to bring a broiled chicken sandwich to market, beating rival Wendy's by a period of several months. Wendy's introduced their first grilled chicken product, simply called a grilled chicken sandwich, in August 1990. The sandwich originally was made with grilled chicken on 4-inch bun with lettuce, tomato and a honey mustard sauce. Wendy's introduced a reformulated grilled chicken sandwich in 1996 that they claimed was plumper and juicier. Wendy's reformulated their grilled chicken product in 2004 as the Ultimate Chicken Grill sandwich during an overhaul of its chicken sandwich line. As of November 2013, the Ultimate Chicken Grill is still Wendy's main grilled sandwich in the United States. While McDonald's had been trying to develop and test a similar product for several years, the company was caught off guard at the time when its mainline competitors introduced their grilled chicken products and was not able to initially deploy a similar product. This was primarily due to the fact the company's highly specialized kitchens could not produce a high quality product without a large investment in new equipment. By early 1991, McDonald's grilled chicken product was still in development, and the vendor would not introduce its version, the McGrilled Chicken Classic, until 1994. The McGrilled chicken sandwich was replaced with the Grilled Chicken Deluxe sandwich in September and October 1996 as part of McDonald's Deluxe line of \\"upscale\\" sandwiches; the company had hoped that a higher value product would help improve average check performance at its stores. However, by 1998 the whole Deluxe line was said to be not selling well, and the Grilled Chicken Deluxe was eliminated when McDonald's brought back the Chicken McGrill sandwich back in 1999. The Chicken McGrill sandwich was retired in 2005 when the company introduced its new Premium line of products, which like the TenderCrisp sandwich was targeted to a more adult audience with higher quality ingredients such as natural cheeses and whole leaf lettuce. Beginning in April 2015, McDonald's moved to a new grilled chicken sandwich, the Artisan Grilled Chicken; the new chicken uses a smaller list of ingredients in the chicken filet, removing ingredients such as maltodextrin and sodium phosphates. The new sandwich is in response to consumer-based market trends of food products that have simpler, more natural ingredients.  Product description  The grilled chicken sandwich is a chicken sandwich, consisting of a flame-grilled chicken breast filet, honey mustard, lettuce and tomatoes on a potato roll. In some Asian markets, such as Singapore, the filet is made from chicken thigh meat and uses a sesame-seed bun. Burger King will also add any condiment it sells upon request based on its long standing slogan \\"Have It Your Way\\". Additionally, Burger King has sold several different promotional varieties throughout the years as limited time offerings (LTO), such as Chicken Caesar Club, made with Romaine lettuce, Parmesan cheese, bacon and caesar dressing on toasted sourdough bread, or the Carolina BBQ TenderGrill made with pepper jack cheese, bacon, jalape√±os, red onion and a mustard-based barbecue sauce which was sold during Burger King's 2012 and 2013 Summer BBQ Menu promotions.  Advertising  The BK Broiler was introduced as part of the company's Sometimes you gotta break the rules campaign designed by the firms of D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Saatchi & Saatchi, a campaign that many of Burger King's franchisees derided as ineffectual and unclear in its message. Despite the failure of the advertising campaign, the product went on to be one of the most successful fast food product launches up to that time. The Chicken Whopper was introduced initially via an April Fools' Day ad in several major news papers that claimed the company was changing its name to \\"Chicken King\\". A later press release announced the joke was to introduce the public to the new product. The television advertising program used to introduce the Chicken Whopper featured animated chickens in cowboy boots marching to the \\"Have It Your Way\\" tune and was created by animation house Kurtz & Friends. Later commercials featured comedian Steve Harvey. A second series of ads called @BK, love is guaranteed that were developed by Los Angeles-based ad house Amoeba, guaranteed that customers would receive a free sandwich if they don't \\"love\\" the chain's Whopper and Chicken Whopper sandwiches. With the discovery of mad cow disease by the FDA in 2003, the company instructed their advertising agency at the time, Young & Rubicam of New York, to retool a forthcoming series of ads featuring the company's signature product, the Whopper, to include the Chicken Whopper. A Burger King spokesman stated that the change was because Burger King \\"decided that if there's anybody who wants a chicken option, at this point, we wanted to remind them that the Whopper comes in chicken as well as the original beef,\\" noting their confidence in their beef supply. The BK Baguettes line was introduced in the United States via an ad campaign from advertising firm Crispin, Porter + Bogusky that featured the tagline \\"Flavor from grilling not fat.\\" The American advertising campaigns for the sandwiches featured several celebrity chefs, such as Rick Bayless, visiting locations where similar style food stuffs were found, e.g. a farmers' market, and commenting on how these ingredients make the new Baguette line better and more healthy. The advertising firm of Euro RSCG Leedex produced ads for the sandwiches in Great Britain. The advertising campaign for the TenderGrill sandwich in Spain in 2010 featured a humor-based ad in which men were asked what type of advertisement would get them to buy the sandwich. The responses, which included what men would like to see in the commercials, formed the basis for the ads. The advertisement, made entirely by women, was filmed in London and featured barbarians, ninjas and unicorns in an advertisement that poked fun at the men's preferences. The making of the commercial was the basis of a mini-documentary from UK firm Feral Films. In a 2011 Singapore campaign, Burger King presented an attack advertisement that was designed to counter the introduction of the Chicken McGrill sandwich from McDonald's. The campaign took McDonald's slogan, \\"Make it better\\" and changed it to \\"Make it even Better\\" and put the sandwich on sale for SGD$1.00 on the same day the McDonald's product was set to debut. Burger King called the McDonald's menu item \\"fake grilled\\" as opposed to flame grilled. = Controversies = The 2012 campaign from Clemenger BBDO for the TenderGrill for the Australian Burger King franchise, Hungry Jack's, featured a goth girl, complete with facial piercings and tattoos that loses her piercings and tattoos as she eats the sandwich. By the time she has finished her meal, her clothing and style had completely changed ‚Äì much to her and her friends horror. At the end of the commercial, the announcer states the tag line \\"There is nothing naughty about the new Hungry Jack's TenderGrill ... Hungry Jack's makes it better.\\" The Australian Advertising Standards Bureau received several complaints from the public claiming the commercial demeaned alternative lifestyles, was discriminatory and insulting to non-conformists. The Advertising Standards Board determined that the advertisement did not breach any pertinent anti-discrimination codes, and dismissed the complaint.Australian Advertising Bureau case report #0241/12.

His name means Father of Gold in Coptic. He was born in Nehisa in the Nile Delta to Christian parents. Abanoub was 12 years old when he was killed and beheaded, after being tortured for refusing to leave Christianity. His feast day is July 31 (Epip 24). His relics are preserved in St.Virgin Mary and St.Abanoub Churches in Sebennytos, Egypt. His title is often The Child Martyr.  History Abanoub was born in the city of Nehisa (District of Talkha). He was the only son of parents who reared him in the fear of God. They died when Abanoub was a young child. At age twelve, Abanoub entered the church to hear the priest asking the congregation to remain faithful during the persecutions provoked by Diocletian, the Roman emperor. Abanoub received the Holy Sacraments, then he prayed to God to guide him to where he could confess his faith in Jesus. He returned to his house, and straight away he rose up, and gave all the gold, silver, and apparel his father had left him to the poor and needy, then went to Samanoud, walking along the river bank. On the way, he had a vision of the Archangel Michael, who told him that he would suffer at Samanoud. He confessed the Name of the Lord Christ before Lucianus the governor. Abanoub also insulted Lucianus's idols such that the governor ruler became furious and gave orders that the child be whipped. The soldiers beat Abanoub severely, but the Archangel Michael miraculously healed him. On the following day, the governor took Abanoub on a boat to a city called Athribis, and as a form of punishment, Abanoub was hung upside down from the mast. The soldiers, along with their ruler, began to drink and dance, while hitting Abanoub on the mouth. Abanoub's nose bled, but then, unexpectedly, the soldiers became blind and the ruler paralyzed. The soldiers cried to Abanoub to pray for them and promised to become Christians. Abanoub replied, \\"This will only happen in Athribis, so that everyone there should know that there is no other God but Christ\\". The angel of the Lord came down from heaven, released Abanoub, and wiped up the blood that was running down from his nose and mouth. Strong winds brought them swiftly to Athribis. When they arrived in Athribis, the soldiers were healed, and they cast their uniforms in front of the ruler of Athribis. The governor became infuriated and ordered that they all be killed. The governor of Athribis tortured Abanoub severely, then sent him to the city of Alexandria. There he was tortured until he delivered up his soul and received the crown of martyrdom. St. Julius El-Akfahsi, who wrote the biography of St. Abanoub, was present. He took Abanoub's body and sent it with some of his men to Abanoub's hometown, Nehisa. Veneration In 960 AD, St. Abanoub's body was transferred to St. Virgin Mary Church in Samanoud. Many churches were built in his name. Many signs and miracles were manifested from his body which is now located in his church in the city of Samnanoud. His feast day is July 31 (Epip 24).\\"Saint Abanoub\\", Saint George Coptic Orthodox Church, Nashville, Tennessee  References  Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:4th-century Christian martyrs Category:Christian child saints Category:Saints from Roman Egypt Category:Angelic visionaries Category:Michael (archangel) ","title":"Abanoub"},{"id":"33141119","text":"The Fear is a post-apocalyptic young adult horror novel written by Charlie Higson. The book, released by Puffin Books in the UK on 15 September 2011 and by Disney Hyperion in the US on 11 May 2010, is the third book in a planned seven-book series, titled The Enemy. The Fear takes place in London, a year after a worldwide sickness has infected adults, turning them into something akin to voracious, cannibalistic zombies. Series Puffin Books released the first novel in the series, titled The Enemy, in the UK on 3 September 2009; Disney Hyperion released it in the US on 11 May 2010. Puffin Books released the second novel in the series, titled The Dead, on 16 September 2010; the third novel, titled The Fear, on 15 September 2011; the fourth novel, The Sacrifice, on 20 September 2012; the fifth novel, The Fallen, on 12 September 2013; the sixth novel, The Hunted, on 4 September 2014; and the final book, The End, on 10 November 2015. Disney Hyperion released Higson's short story companion book in the series, titled Geeks vs. Zombies, on 5 June 2012; it portrays an exclusive scene from The Fear, on World Book Day. Summary The Fear starts a few days before Small Sam and the Kid arrive at the Tower of London, at the end of The Dead, and another few days before the events of The Enemy (with both books merging into each other near the middle). A prologue introduces a new zombie called \\"The Collector\\", a massive father who collects \\"toys\\" (kids), plays with them until they break (tortures them until they die), and eats them. He finds two children and adds them to his \\"collection\\", as described in the prologue of the book. The real story begins at the Tower, where Dognut is growing restless of his confinement and is annoyed that he has been kicked down from second in command by Ed. He plans on heading out to find Brooke and the others from the Tesco truck, whom they lost contact with during the fire of South London and The Battle of Lambeth Bridge. Although his intentions are to find everybody that went missing, he also wants to go because of the crush he has on Brooke. He discusses this with Ed (as seen in \\"The Dead\\") and he agrees with him. Dognut assembles a team consisting of Courtney (who wants to find Brooke, but also secretly has a crush on Dognut), best friends Marco and Felix (who were with Dognut at the Imperial War Museum), Finn (who is looking for old friends), Al (who is looking for his sister Maria), youngster Olivia (who is looking for her older brother Paul) and Jessica (who has recently broken up with her boyfriend Brendan). After a quick but difficult row upriver, they end up at the Houses of Parliament, where they find a girl named Nicola and her group. Nicola tells them none of their friends are at the Houses of Parliament, but lets them know about David taking residence at Buckingham Palace. The group decides to travel to the palace, thinking that their friends might be there. During the journey, the group is attacked by the 'gym bunnies', a group of zombies who, due to their good physical condition, are harder to kill; the gym bunnies corner Dognut's crew. About to go in for the kill, they are saved by a brutal group of hunters led by a boy named Ryan. Ryan's group guides Dognut's crew to the palace, where Al is reunited with Maria. David claims that he does not know where their friends are, but the group later realize he isn't all that he seems; mainly, he's lying about their friends, who are staying at the Natural History Museum. They head to the museum at night, without Al, who stays with his sister and Jessica, who is too scared to continue . As night draws closer, zombies come out in large numbers and chase the group to a house where they think kids are living, which is primarily due to Marco believing an arm sticking out of a container on a table (with an upright kids body next to it) was waving at them to come in. Instead, it turns out to be the Collector's lair, and the group encounter the large monster. They make a run for it, unaware that they've left Olivia behind. She kills herself before the Collector can get her by jumping off a high balcony to her death. The group later arrives at the Natural History Museum where they find Brooke and the others, and meet Robbie (their Head of Security), Justin (the leader), and Paul (Olivia's brother). Paul asks for Olivia, but Courtney explains that Olivia was killed by the Collector. Paul goes hysterical after learning about Olivia's death, and he becomes determined to kill the Collector. Dognut's group, Robbie, Jackson (a friend of Robbie's), Ryan's hunters, and several others from the museum all join with Paul to kill the Collector. The large group coaxes the Collector out of his lair onto the road, where they savagely beat him to death. Jackson, one of the girls from Ryan's group, ultimately finishes the job by stabbing a spear through the Collectors neck, where she also stabbed him there before, but not to the extent of killing him. Upon returning, Justin gives Dognut a tour of the place. He shows Dognut the experiments they've been carrying out to investigate the disease and to find a cure - which included taking samples from three zombies they've locked up in the Tesco lorry. Justin tells Dognut about the large number of zombies residing in the museum's basement, where the group obtains their test subjects. They have found out so far that UV light (sunlight) rapidly increases the speed of the disease, causing a sicko to die if exposed to too much sunlight (As shown with Nick in \\"The Enemy\\"). However, they've also found that sickos can build up a resistance to sunlight, through exposure to a fixed amount of sunlight each day until they are fully able to roam about in the daytime. Afterwards, Paul loses his mind and starts to threaten and blame everyone for Olivia's death. Brooke eventually calms him down, and Dognut decides to head back to the Tower first thing the following morning but is persuaded by Justin to stay longer, to write his and his group's story into a book which a bookworm named Chris (previously and originally starring in \\"The Dead\\") is writing in the library. During a chat where Dognut flirts with Brooke, she reveals that Courtney likes him (much to his surprise). Dognut talks to Courtney about this, where she explains that she thinks Brooke still has a crush on Ed, and when they return to the Tower with them, Brooke will start a romance with him. Dognut listens to Courtney and remembers what she says. At the Palace, David and Nicola meet in secret. David proposes that the two groups form an alliance - a step toward implementing his maniacal plan to take over the entirety of London. Nicola is reluctant but ends up creating a deal that involves removing the 'squatters' at St James's Park, as they pose a threat to her group at the House of Parliament. Until then, she won't officially agree to the alliance. David accepts and immediately asks Jester to go and recruit children who can fight (which reveals this to be Jester's actual mission when he is found by the Holloway kids in \\"The Enemy\\"). David also has a crush on Nicola, which she teases him about until they are interrupted. A loner named Shadowman (who has been spying on the Squatters) visits Jester in Buckingham Palace and is convinced to join the expedition to recruit fighters for the Palace. They are joined by a couple named Tom and Kate, and a boy named Alfie. Jester is initially mad of the small group that they have, and said that David only sent them \\"bloody civilians\\". The small group begin walking north until they encounter a group of zombies. They flee the zombies and end up at King's Cross Station. They fight off some zombies before Jester accidentally hits Shadowman, leaving him with a slight concussion. Jester, Alfie, Tom, and Kate abandon Shadowman, and then split into two groups with Jester and Alfie in one, and Tom and Kate in the other. Shadowman passes out, and wakes up to a huge pain in the head, and to one of the remaining grownups attempting to devour him. As the grownup cannot walk (due to broken spine) and Shadowman passes out upon standing up and at random intervals, a \\"nightmare version of hare and tortoise\\" occurs, in which the faster Shadowman crawls away from the slower grownup, but then passes out randomly, allowing the slower grownup to catch him. Finally, in a latch ditch effort, Shadowman kills the grownup using a steel rod he finds in a pile of scrap metal. He then succumbs in to his pain and tiredness, and passes out to a fight taking place between other grownups and a stronger group that takes him. Jester and Alfie find refuge in a flat, until a group of zombies find them and attempt to break in. In creating a plan of escape, Jester tricks Alfie and abandons him, escaping by himself. Alfie is then killed by the grownups, after he finds out Jester ran away. His fingers gets cut off by the window where he jumps off (not explicitly stated, but most likely by the window falling down upon him, or less likely by the axe, which is mentioned earlier, by a grownup) where he then painfully stumbles into his fate. Jester runs and discovers the Morrison's supermarket but is denied entry. He then finds the Waitrose supermarket, where he is rescued by Arran's group (described in The Enemy) and convinces them to come to the palace. Shadowman awakens and finds himself at the Emirates Stadium, being watched by Saint George's \\"Lieutenants\\" (who he nicknames Spike, Man-U, One-Armed Bandit, and Bluetooth). He learns that St. George is much smarter than the rest of the zombies, and he is creating an army in the stadium. Shadowman escapes the army of zombies when a fire lights up in the stands (most likely as part of Small Sam's escape, as told in The Enemy). Shadowman takes refuge in a nearby apartment building where he discovers boxes of weapons and food. He sees this as a sign to follow St. George's army, and to learn about them before returning to London city. While watching their movement, he sees Tom and Kate being pulled out of a house they had taken shelter in, and they get killed by St. George's army. Dozing off to sleep, Shadowman is suddenly awakened by a group of zombies that have found his hiding spot, including One-Armed Bandit. He manages to kill them all, and plans to slaughter every single one of St. George's remaining right-hand men, St. George himself, and Jester (for leaving him behind). Meanwhile, Dognut, Courtney, Marco, and Felix are still at the museum, preparing to head back to the Tower. In a sudden surge of happiness, Dognut kisses Courtney. Finn decides to stay at the museum, whilst Brooke joins the group and prepares to head back to the tower. Robbie and Jackson join the group, but only to escort them part of the way. They set off toward the Tower until they are ambushed by the 'gym bunnies' again. Dognut, Courtney, Marco and Felix are all killed whilst Jackson escapes with a wounded Robbie, and Brooke is saved by the Holloway kids (as described in The Enemy). She is taken to Buckingham Palace with the Holloway crew, and is revealed that she is the bandaged girl in the sick bay. Jester and David both fail to recognize her due to her injuries, and as in The Enemy, Brooke wakes up and tells Maxie and Blue that David is a liar. Meanwhile, Paul, who is still crazed, secretly leaves the museum for Buckingham Palace. He meets with David and Jester, who take advantage of his mental state, and tell him a fake story that everyone at the museum was plotting against him. This causes Paul to take want to take revenge on everyone who he believes he killed Olivia, and David convinces him to return to the museum and release all the zombies who are in the basement. Paul agrees and returns to the museum. Whilst Brooke and the Holloway children escape the palace (As shown in \\"The Enemy\\"), Paul kills a boy named Jamie and releases the zombies underneath the museum (revealing that he has been infected by a zombie bite all along), and Shadowman watches as Saint George's army kills Callum, burns Waitrose to the ground and marches on to the heart of the city (as seen in \\"The Enemy\\"), finally deciding to name them \\"The Fear\\".

It is popularly known as China Zun ( and IPA pronunciation ). The 109-storey, building is the tallest in the city, surpassing that of the China World Trade Center Tower III by 190 metres. On August 18, 2016, CITIC Tower surpassed China World Trade Center Tower III in height, becoming Beijing's tallest building. The tower structurally topped out on July 9, 2017, fully topped out on August 18, 2017, and was completed in late 2018 making CITIC Tower the tallest completed building of 2018. The nickname China Zun comes from the zun, an ancient Chinese wine vessel which inspired the building design, according to the developers, the CITIC Group. The groundbreaking ceremony of the building took place in Beijing on September 19, 2011 and the constructors expect to finish the project within five years. CITIC Tower is Northern China's third tallest building after Goldin Finance 117 and Chow Tai Fook Binhai Center in Tianjin. Farrells produced the tower's land bid concept design, with Kohn Pedersen Fox assuming the project and completing a 14-month- long concept design process after the client had won the bid. China Zun Tower is a mixed-use building, featuring 60 floors of office space, 20 floors of luxury apartments and 20 floors of hotel with 300 rooms, there will be a rooftop garden on the top floor at 524m high. The tower is likely to remain the tallest building in Beijing for the foreseeable future, as in 2018 authorities capped new projects in the central business district to a height of no more than 180 meters in a bid to reduce congestion.https://www.scmp.com/property/hong-kong- china/article/2142138/beijings-skyscraper-arms-race-draws-close-thanks-new- height Controversy In April 2018, Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao reported that China Zun's top three floors, Levels 106-107 and an observatory on level 108, is to be expropriated by the national-security apparatus, since the entire Zhongnanhai complex, the headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council of the People's Republic of China, could be seen from the top of the skyscraper with the naked eye on a clear day. It is also said that with high-end telescopes and other monitoring equipment, the day-to-day lives and activities of the Party and State Leaders could be seen. The building is ordered rectification for \\"fire safety issues\\" by the authorities, but the CITIC Group is unable to reveal the specific reason for rectification. It is also said the top three floors of the building will be administered by the National Security authorities after rectification.

It is a Gram-positive, intracellular bacterium that causes disease in young salmonid fish. The infection is most commonly known as \\"bacterial kidney disease\\" but may also be referred to as BKD, White Boil Disease, Dee Disease, Salmonid Kidney Disease and Corynebacterial Kidney Disease. It is of significant ecologic importance due to its effect on both farmed and wild salmonids. The disease is found in North America, Europe, Japan, Chile and Scandinavia, and is spread both vertically and horizontally. Pacific salmon appear to be the most susceptible to the disease. Clinical signs The severity of clinical signs is very variable. There may be no outward clinical signs, or fish may show signs of lethargy and anaemia. Haemorrhagic skin lesions and exophthalmos may develop. On postmortem examination there are normally signs of necrosis and granulomatous inflammation on the internal organs, especially the kidney. A diagnosis cannot be made based on clinical signs, instead laboratory tests such as specialised bacterial culture, ELISA, PCR and fluorescent antibody testing are necessary to identify the bacteria. Ideally more than one test should be used to confirm diagnosis. Treatment & control Oral or injectable antibiotics should be used to treat the infection. Intraperitoneal vaccination can also be used to treat fish in an outbreak. Prevention is very important, and husbandry measures such as segregation, culling and decontamination should be used to ensure infection is not introduced.

Kyrgyzstan‚Äôs rampant corruption which penetrates all levels of society, including the presidency, eventually caused the Tulip Revolution in 2005, overthrowing Askar Akayev, and the 2010 Kyrgyzstani revolution, ousting Kurmanbek Bakiyev from office. Corruption in Kyrgyzstan is a large and significant problem that poses the main threat to the country's national security, socio-economic development, the well-being of society and the people and affects the functioning of state authorities, judicial authorities, law enforcement agencies, the penal system, local government bodies, health systems and education in Kyrgyzstan. Corruption has become an integral part of the governance mechanism in Kyrgyzstan. In the Corruption Perceptions Index published annually by Transparency International, Kyrgyzstan is among the 50 most corrupt countries in the world. According to modern Kyrgyz legislation, corruption is a deliberate act consisting in the creation of an unlawful stable connection of one or more officials with powers of authority with individuals or groups in order to illegally obtain material, any other benefits and advantages, as well as their provision of these benefits and advantages. individuals and legal entities that pose a threat to the interests of society or the state. There are laws aimed at preventing corruption, but their implementation is very weak. The low level of prosecution of corrupt officials is another factor contributing to the rampant corruption in Kyrgyzstan. It is not a criminal offense for a non-public official to influence the decision of a public official. The Kyrgyz judiciary is facing a serious functional deficit due to limited resources and judicial corruption. In Kyrgyzstan, corruption is present at almost all levels of society, business and government. Kyrgyzstan is one of the most corrupt countries in the world and as of 2019 ranks 126th according to the corruption perception index according to the international organization \\"Transparency International\\", and one of the factors contributing to this is the possession of the largest gold deposit in Central Asia, Kumtor (the state budget receives only a small part of taxes and payments from the mine, but which contributed to many corruption scandals and allegations of corruption among the country's top officials), its large reserves of gold, coal and geographic location Transparency International's 2019 Corruption Perceptions Index ranks the country 126th out of 180 countries. \\"Bribery among low and mid-level officials is part of everyday life and sometimes even transparent,\\" says Freedom House, adding that widespread corruption helps \\"limit equality of opportunity.\\" Local authorities and militia in the south of Kyrgyzstan are characterized by a high level of corruption and intolerance towards Uzbeks. The June crisis deprived state institutions of that small trust from the Uzbek diaspora, which was in short supply before the crisis. Corruption of local authorities and militia in the south of Kyrgyzstan contributed greatly to the June 2010 events. At one time, even Akayev admitted that crime and corruption have firmly settled on the seventh floor of the White House (there are the offices of the president and the prime minister). This statement has not lost its relevance under Bakiyev. Thus, according to the lists of his Ak Zhol party, in 2007, one of the leaders of the southern organized criminal group, Sanzhar Kadyraliev, entered parliament, later shot dead in his office deputy car. Other leaders of organized criminal groups, Iskender Matraimov, Bayaman Erkinbaev, Rysbek Akmatbaev, Omurbek Bakirov, Ulan Cholponbaev, Bakytbek Zhetigenov, Altynbek Sulaimanov, were also elected to the country's parliament. History The USSR At the end of the 19th century, G.V. Plekhanov wrote: \\"The socialist organization of production presupposes a character of economic relations that would make this organization a logical conclusion from the entire previous development of the country\\", because \\"decrees cannot create conditions alien to the very nature of modern economic relations. If this is not the case, after the social revolution \\"you will have to put up with what is, take what gives ... reality.\\" In this case, \\"the building of the socialist organization will be built by the hands of the government,\\" not the working class, not the people, but \\"from above.\\" The party will not serve the class, but the working class and the rank-and-file members of this party will serve the upper party structures, which G.V/ Plekhanov called the \\"caste.\\" ‚ÄúNational production will be managed by a socialist‚Äú caste ‚Äù(in the present, nomenklatura business executives, from among whom party and state workers were nominated), regarding the members of which there can be no guarantees that they will not want to use the power they have seized for goals that have nothing to do with the interests of the working class. \\" At first, bribery in Soviet Kyrgyzstan was recognized as counter-revolutionary activity, and the 1922 Criminal Code provided for execution for this crime. Despite the toughness of criminal norms, corruption continued to exist in the USSR as well in the judicial system and law enforcement agencies. Thus, at the expense of the union center, there was a further economic strengthening of the lowest level of the state as a corporation - an enterprise, and the cash flows that the directors could control significantly increased. A fictitious economy arose and operated, which did not create goods, but the wind of which blew the sails of illegal business well and made it possible to feed well those who were \\"at the helm of power\\" not only administrative, but, above all, economic. This includes the production of surplus, low-quality and counterfeit products; inflationary and speculative price increases. The additions to the fulfillment of the plan are especially indicative. All this served the appropriation of surplus value by private individuals, one way or another involved in production. As KGB General A.G. Sidorenko recalls, Andropov more than once sent Brezhnev operational materials about the extortion of some party leaders, but usually they returned with a note: \\"Reported, destroy.\\" By the beginning of the perestroika, ‚Äútheir own people‚Äù in the state (and perhaps in the party) structures had not only domestic ‚Äúshadow‚Äù companies, but also foreign capital, which in this way also had the opportunity to influence the policy of the Soviet state. The law on cooperation, adopted in 1989, laid the foundation for the legalization of underground workshops and the privatization of state property. ‚ÄúIf in 1986 the right to direct export and import activities was experimentally granted to a limited circle of enterprises and organizations,‚Äù it was noted on the pages of Izvestia of the Central Committee of the CPSU, ‚Äúsince April 1, 1989, practically all Soviet state and cooperative enterprises, other organizations received the right to directly export their own products and buy goods for the money earned to develop production and meet the needs of their work collectives. \\" Thus, already in 1986 - 1987. the transfer of Soviet money (including, and perhaps above all, government and party money) abroad begins. There they were converted into dollars, pounds, marks, etc., which made it possible to avoid their depreciation under the influence of \\"shock therapy\\", and then, after 1991, to return to Kyrgyzstan and other former Soviet republics. In the USSR, until the early 1980s, the topic of corruption was not openly raised. The fact that from the mid-1950s to 1986, bribery registered in criminal practice increased 25 times, Soviet citizens were not informed ... The number of officials in the Soviet Union per 1000 inhabitants: in 1922 there were 5.2; in 1928 - 6.9; in 1940 - 9.5; in 1950 - 10.2; in 1985 - 8.7 In modern Kyrgyzstan 1992-2000 An important role in the spread of corruption in post-Soviet Kyrgyzstan was the bankruptcy of successfully operating state-owned enterprises and factories and their further privatization at the residual, symbolic value by those in power. Which, due to the theft of state property, have officially turned into dollar multimillionaires. In the future, the privatization of agricultural land assigned large allotments of land to the newly appeared corrupt officials. In such a criminal way, the people in Kyrgyzstan were deprived of public property, created by the labor of several generations of the people, and which passed into the private property of state officials in power. The initial accumulation of capital through appropriation for the symbolic value of state property contributed to the fact that people with a criminal past aspired to power in Kyrgyzstan. As a result, about 30 percent of the country's people live below the poverty line, and Kyrgyzstan is among the ten poorest countries in the world. Total corruption contributes to a large flow of smuggling, In 1998, Doctor of Law N.I. Matuzov noted that \\"the privileges, abuses, corruption of modern bosses have acquired such forms and scales that even the party officials of the Soviet period did not dream of.\\" In the book \\"Goal number one\\" Mikhail Antonov and the head of the legal department of the Presidential Administration of the Kyrgyz Republic Marat Ukushov assessed corruption in Kyrgyzstan as \\"total\\". At the beginning of 2019, A. Sharshenbayev, an employee of the Transparency International Kyrgyzstan center, stated that Kyrgyzstan is one of the ten most corrupt countries in the world and that corruption is one of the most destructive forces in the Kyrgyz state. In the National Strategy for Sustainable Development of the Kyrgyz Republic for the period 2013-2017, it was noted that the system of government and business in Kyrgyzstan is saturated with corruption and criminal business, the criminalization of certain state structures. The state of the law enforcement and law enforcement systems indicates that they are unable to resist corruption, since they themselves are often the subject of it. From the year 2000 In the Corruption Perceptions Index published annually by Transparency International, Kyrgyzstan is among the 50 most corrupt countries in the world. In the 2019 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, Kyrgyzstan was ranked 126th out of 180 in 2019. In this ranking, Kyrgyzstan is listed as one of the Asian countries with the most difficult corruption situation, where ‚Äúbribery often goes hand in hand with the persecution of ethnic minorities‚Äù. Sociological research has shown that 81% of respondents in Kyrgyzstan consider corruption the biggest problem. Experts note that the turnover of the shadow economy is estimated at an average of 60% of the country's GDP, which is about 130 billion soms, since corruption is one of the ways to avoid the established system of taxation and state reporting. It is known that through corruption there is a redistribution of income in favor of certain corporate and social groups at the expense of the most vulnerable segments of the population who are unable to resist extortion and other corruption abuses. At the same time, some analysts argue that there is no fight against corruption in Kyrgyzstan, arrests of middle-level officials do not violate the bribery system, and no anti-corruption policy has been developed. One of the entrenched forms of corruption in modern Kyrgyzstan is the employment of relatives of officials of all ranks in structures with a high level of income, which can be considered as payment for their loyalty to the ‚Äúadopters‚Äù and their structures. Relatives often become cover for business and property of officials by rewriting ownership. The press noted cases of such suspicion. In particular, the wives of the Matraimov brothers. History and cases =Akayev administration= In 2005, after the revolution that overthrew President Akayev, a commission was set up to investigate his business assets; the tentative list was for 42 businesses inclusive of the Kumtor Gold Mine. As early as 2002, Akayev and his son Aydar were alleged to have received $2 million in lease payments, along with other payments, totalling $119 million through his two airport service companies. However, investigations have met with much difficulty in identifying the exact ownership of the companies. =Bakiyev administration= President Bakiyev, after his rise to the presidency in 2006, in turn appointed his son, Maxim Bakiyev, to the nation‚Äôs development agency. There were murky deals signed with the China and the transfer of assets to overseas tax havens. It is alleged that Bakiyev‚Äôs son channelled $35 million of the $300 million into his own private bank account. = Jeenbekov administration = One of the major corruption scandals that happened during the presidency of the current leader Sooronbay Jeenbekov is related to Raimbek Matraimov, a former deputy head of the State Customs Service of Kyrgyzstan. In May 2019 the Kyrgyz edition of Radio Liberty published an investigation, in which journalists claimed that Matraimov earned significant wealth while being part of a corruption scheme during his work as the customs official from 2015 to 2017. According to the investigation, Matraimov allowed a group of Chinese companies led by the secretive Abdukadyr family bring goods into Kyrgyzstan without paying any customs fees. One of the sources of the investigation, a self-confessed money launderer Aierken Saimaiti who worked for Abdukadyrs, was murdered in Istanbul in November 2019. Although Matraimov denied any links with the murder of Saimaiti, the next part of the journalism investigation about him, heavily based on interviews with Saimaiti, was published on November 21, 2019, ten days after the assassination of Saimaiti. This time it was a joint investigation by Radio Liberty, OCCRP and Kloop, a Kyrgyz media outlet, and it revealed more details about the corruption schemes at the Kyrgyz customs service. According to November investigations, Matraimov not only backed illegal activities of the Abdukadyr family business, but got involved in at least one joint real estate project with them: Matraimov's wife Uulkan Turgunova was revealed to be a co-owner of an estate in Dubai together with one of the Abdukadyr family members. Neither Matraimov, nor his wife have ever had an official salary that would allow them to invest into such an expensive project. =Judicial system= The judicial system is viewed with strong distrust by the population. The courts under President Akaev were used to suppress the opposition, and under President Bakiyev, the courts continued the same purpose, deregistering credible opposition parties for the 2007 elections. There was widespread protest about the supreme court decision to close the case involving the police killing 6 people in Aksy district in March 2001, when President Bakiyev was then Prime Minister. The frustration with the endemic corruption in the judicial system has even provoked some set up an individual system of law enforcement. In 2000, a survey was conducted with 2100 respondents holding the view that the judicial institution was the 2nd most corrupt organization, and 83% of respondents holding the view that corruption was rife there. 2011 amendment of hajj law The Kyrgyzstan parliament made changes to its laws to prevent the officials profiting from the corrupt distribution of hajj pilgrimage places allocated to the country by Saudi Arabia. Officials have been accused of selling or distributing them to their relatives and friends instead of fairly allocating the quota. Anti- corruption efforts Anti-Corruption legislation includes the Criminal Code of Kyrgyzstan which criminalises the major forms of corrupt activity, including passive bribery, attempted corruption, extortion, money laundering and abuse of office. A number of organizations like the Anti-Corruption Business Council and the NGO, Citizens Against Corruption, have been set up to tackle the endemic corruption besetting the country. The government launched a new anticorruption website in March 2011 with the promise that the government, Prosecutor-General office and the police will check every case. though many have remain sceptical on the usefulness of the website Analysis of corruption in the country The Swedish political scientist Johan Engvall in his study \\"Corruption is the whole of Kyrgyzstan. The state as an investment market: an analytical basis for understanding politics and bureaucracy in Kyrgyzstan\\" wrote: The entire state called Kyrgyzstan can be imagined as a market where government offices are sold and bought. The culmination of the disintegration of the state was the almost official symbiosis between law enforcement and organized crime, nurtured by former President Bakiyev. In his dissertation, Dr. J. Engvall cites figures presented by various sources of information and referring to different periods of the history of independent Kyrgyzstan. According to his interlocutors, in Akaev's times, the post of minister could cost from one hundred to two hundred thousand dollars. To become a governor, one had to pay more than 40 thousand dollars, and akim (head of the city administration) - from 20 thousand dollars. In February 2011, according to a former judge and deputy minister, a judge's seat in the court of first instance in Bishkek had to pay between $ 10,000 and $ 50,000. Corruption in local government After the expansion of powers, decentralization and the transfer of many functions directly to local self- government bodies, the local government has become one of the main corruption feeding troughs in Kyrgyzstan. The heads of local governments were endowed with administrative, control and administrative powers, which they used for personal enrichment. As a result of decentralization, the collection of all types of taxes and payments passed to the introduction of local authorities. Local authorities formed the local budget. Considerable funds from the local budget were directed to dubious projects for which controversial tenders were held, kickbacks for them amounted to 30-40% of the tender amount. Other corrupt components of local authorities were the allocation of land plots for the construction of individual housing, which took place for large bribes, the allocation of municipal property for rent and sale to private ownership, construction permits, and the transfer of objects to non-residential fund. Abuse of office among local officials has reached rampant proportions, as reported by the country's attorney general During the reign of the head of the Kyzyl-Kyshtak ayil okmotu Sharabidin Kaparov, he was recognized as the most corrupt official in Kyrgyzstan. During this period, crimes were recorded in the field of land fraud, illegal transfer of state social facilities (in particular, the territory of schools, baths in the village of Kyzyl-Bayrak, part of the Toloykon hospital) into private ownership. Sharabidin Kaparov, using forged documents, issued a strategic object of state importance - the Western airport of Osh, as private property, which was later destroyed by a social object - a bathhouse in the village of Kyzyl-Bayrak in the name of his father. He handed over to his relatives the building of a 4-storey educational building of the Osh state farm-technical school for the illegal organization of a gambling brothel. Sh. Kaparov carried out illegal capital construction on agricultural irrigated lands and the security zone of the Western (reserve) airport of Osh city, transfer of municipal property and municipal land with hundreds of times lower than the real market price and causing especially large material damage to state interests, illegally registered as private property whole streets in the settlements of the village of Suratash, land plots were allocated for the construction of housing for large bribes, misappropriation of budget funds by overstating the cost estimate and the amount of work. Sh. Kaparov did not hesitate to appropriate budgetary funds allocated for children, low-income families and disabled people. In order to prosecute the corrupt official Sharabidin Kaparov, the residents of the council had to complain in writing to the President of Russia V.V. Putin, organized processions with banners to the capital, went to numerous rallies, staged acts of self-immolation. Sh. Kaparov persecuted and threatened to kill the activists. Corruption at customs, smuggling, drug supply The economic and corruption basis for corrupt officials in Kyrgyzstan was the customs, which accounted for significant financial flows. The proximity to this resource also led to the allocation of some \\"clans\\" in the country, initially on the basis of party territorial associations. After the collapse of the USSR and the emergence of independent Kyrgyzstan, the \\"Corruption clans\\" turned into oligarchic groups, since the representatives of the old party nomenklatura mainly benefited from privatization. With the collapse of the USSR, the Kyrgyz customs began to introduce gray corruption schemes, develop smuggling, control the supply of drugs from Tajikistan through Kyrgyzstan to Kazakhstan and then to Russia on a systematic basis. Corrupt leaders of law enforcement agencies controlled the Kyrgyz part of the Northern Route, the supply of Afghan drugs to Russia, China and other countries. A large flow of smuggling from China and Turkey and further duty-free re-export of these smuggled goods to the EAEU countries caused repeated scandals among the leaderships of the EAEU countries. For example, in October 2017, Kazakhstan even closed the border with Kyrgyzstan, demanding that the Kyrgyz authorities put an end to gray smuggling. But, since the authorities of Kyrgyzstan, through the gray cardinal of the Kyrgyz customs, receive shadow income from customs and smuggling, the situation with gray smuggling is still not resolved. This plays into the hands of corrupt officials, since the smuggling of goods and the supply of drugs across the border, which they control, is the main item of the shadow incomes of corrupt officials and with part of the criminal proceeds from which they are shared with the country's leadership, and therefore corrupt officials from customs are untouchable under any government in Kyrgyzstan. For 17 years, Kyrgyz customs have registered goods from China totaling $ 11.64 billion. At the same time, the Chinese customs considered that they had sent goods to Kyrgyzstan for $ 61.667 billion. The difference is over $ 50 billion. Thus, due to the gray schemes introduced by the Matraimov clan to the customs, the state budget of Kyrgyzstan received less than $ 10 billion. This is despite the fact that the external debt of Kyrgyzstan is $ 4.5 billion, the Government of the country is forced to borrow funds to replenish the state budget and Kyrgyzstan is one of the ten poorest countries in the world and one million Kyrgyzstanis are in forced migration due to the lack of prospects and work in their homeland. ... For 17 years, according to the Kyrgyz customs, the volume of supplies of goods from Turkey amounted to $ 1.129 billion. According to Turkish data, goods worth $ 2.968 billion were sent. The difference is $ 1.839 billion. Goods from the United States account for a significant share in Kyrgyzstan's imports. Official figures are close to Turkish imports. However, here, too, the US customs data differ significantly: $ 884 million versus $ 2.039 billion. Another corruption component of the Kyrgyz customs is the smuggling of fuels and lubricants to Tajikistan. Kyrgyzstan, as a member of the EAEU, purchases from Russia large consignments of fuel and lubricants duty-free and delivers part of Russian fuel and lubricants without customs clearance to Tajikistan, where fuel and lubricants are more expensive. Payments do not go to the state budget, but go to the pockets of corrupt officials. With the opening of the border with Uzbekistan, the smuggling of household appliances, mobile phones and consumer goods to this country was established. Corrupt officials of the country are engaged in money laundering on an especially large scale, illegally and without declaring they withdraw gold and several billion dollars a year from Kyrgyzstan, without paying taxes and payments to the state budget.

McGonigle; James F. Quigley, Paulist Press, 1988 p. 39 was a client state of the Roman Republic from 37 BCE, when Herod the Great was appointed \\"King of the Jews\\" by the Roman Senate.Jewish War 1.14.4: Mark Antony \\" ...then resolved to get him made king of the Jews ... told them that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate was separated, Antony and Caesar went out, with Herod between them; while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in order to offer sacrifices [to the Roman gods], and to lay the decree in the Capitol. Antony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.\\" When Herod died in 4 BCE, the kingdom was divided among his sons into the Herodian Tetrarchy. Background =Roman involvement in the Levant= Pompey in the Temple of Jerusalem, by Jean Fouquet The first intervention of Rome in the region dates from 63 BCE, following the end of the Third Mithridatic War, when Rome created the province of Syria. After the defeat of Mithridates VI of Pontus, Pompey (Pompey the Great) sacked Jerusalem in 63 BCE. The Hasmonean Queen, Salome Alexandra, had recently died and her sons, Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II, turned against each other in a civil war. In 63 BCE, Aristobulus was besieged in Jerusalem by his brother's armies. He sent an envoy to Marcus Aemilius Scaurus, Pompey's representative in the area. Aristobulus offered a massive bribe to be rescued, which Pompey promptly accepted. Afterwards, Aristobulus accused Scaurus of extortion. Since Scaurus was Pompey's brother in law and prot√©g√©e, the general retaliated by putting Hyrcanus in charge of the kingdom as Prince and High Priest. When Pompey was defeated by Julius Caesar, Hyrcanus was succeeded by his courtier Antipater the Idumaean, also known as Antipas, as the first Roman Procurator. In 57‚Äì55 BCE, Aulus Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, split the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts of Sanhedrin/Synedrion (councils of law).Antiquities of the Jews 14.5.4: \\"And when he had ordained five councils (œÉœÖŒΩŒ≠Œ¥œÅŒπŒ±), he distributed the nation into the same number of parts. So these councils governed the people; the first was at Jerusalem, the second at Gadara, the third at Amathus, the fourth at Jericho, and the fifth at Sepphoris in Galilee.\\" Jewish Encyclopedia: Sanhedrin: \\"Josephus uses œÉœÖŒΩŒ≠Œ¥œÅŒπŒøŒΩ for the first time in connection with the decree of the Roman governor of Syria, Gabinius (57 BCE), who abolished the constitution and the then existing form of government of Palestine and divided the country into five provinces, at the head of each of which a sanhedrin was placed (\\"Ant.\\" xiv. 5, ¬ß 4).\\" =Parthian invasion and Roman intervention= After Julius Caesar was murdered in 44 BCE, Quintus Labienus, a Roman republican general and ambassador to the Parthians, sided with Brutus and Cassius in the Liberators' civil war; after their defeat Labienus joined the Parthians and assisted them in invading Roman territories in 40 BCE. The Parthian army crossed the Euphrates and Labienus was able to entice Mark Antony's Roman garrisons around Syria to rally to his cause. The Parthians split their army, and under Pacorus conquered the Levant from the Phoenician coast through the Land of Israel: > \\"Antigonus... roused the Parthians to invade Syria and Palestine, [and] the > Jews eagerly rose in support of the scion of the Maccabean house, and drove > out the hated Idumeans with their puppet Jewish king. The struggle between > the people and the Romans had begun in earnest, and though Antigonus, when > placed on the throne by the Parthians, proceeded to spoil and harry the > Jews, rejoicing at the restoration of the Hasmonean line, thought a new era > of independence had come.Bentwich, Chapter I. When Phasael and Hyrcanus II set out on an embassy to the Parthians, the Parthians instead captured them. Antigonus, who was present, cut off Hyrcanus's ears to make him unsuitable for the High Priesthood, while Phasael was put to death. Antigonus, whose Hebrew name was Mattathias, bore the double title of king and High Priest for only three years. He had not disposed of Herod, who fled into exile and sought the support of Mark Antony. Herod was designated \\"King of the Jews\\" by the Roman Senate in 40 BCE: Antony \\"then resolved to get [Herod] made king of the Jews...[and] told [the Senate] that it was for their advantage in the Parthian war that Herod should be king; so they all gave their votes for it. And when the senate was separated, Antony and Caesar [Augustus] went out, with Herod between them; while the consul and the rest of the magistrates went before them, in order to offer sacrifices [to the Roman gods], and to lay the decree in the Capitol. Antony also made a feast for Herod on the first day of his reign.\\"Josephus, Wars of the Jews, 14.4, via The struggle thereafter lasted for some years, as the main Roman forces were occupied with defeating the Parthians and had few additional resources to use to support Herod. After the Parthian defeat, Herod was victorious over his rival in 37 BCE. Antigonus was delivered to Antony and executed shortly thereafter, bringing about the end of the Hasmonean rule over Israel. Herod as king The taking of Jerusalem by Herod the Great, 37 BCE, by Jean Fouquet, late 15th century. King Herod has become known among the archaeologists as Herod the Builder, and under his reign Judea experienced an unprecedented construction, still obtaining an impact on the landscape of the region. Under his enterprise, such projects as the Masada fortress, the Herodion and the great port of Caesarea Maritima were built. =Fate of the Hasmonean dynasty under Herod= During King Herod's reign, the last male representatives of the Hasmoneans were eliminated, while only Herodias remained alive with her daughter. Herodias was among the few remaining Hasmonean female heirs, as she was granddaughter of Aristobulus II. Herodias was great-granddaughter of the Hasmonean princess Mariamne. Mariamne was ultimately convicted on dubious charges that arose from palace intrigue and internal power struggles. She was executed in 29 BCE, but was survived by her granddaughter Herodias and her great-granddaughter. Herodias managed to survive miraculously, and was eventually exiled to Gaul, with her second husband, Herod Antipas. Antipas was accused by his nephew Agrippa I of conspiracy against the new Roman emperor Caligula, who sent him into exile in Gaul, where he was accompanied by Herodias, a female Hasmonean heir. Antigonus was not, however, the last male Hasmonean; Aristobulus III, grandson of Aristobulus II through his elder son Alexander, and brother of the Hasmonean princess Mariamne, was briefly made high priest, but was soon executed (36 BCE) due to jealousy of Herod's first wife Doris. His sister, Mariamne was married to Herod, but fell victim to his notorious fear of being assassinated. Her sons by Herod, Aristobulus IV and Alexander, were in their adulthood also executed by their father, but not before Aristobulus IV having sired Herodias. Hyrcanus II had been held by the Parthians since 40 BCE. For four years, until 36 BCE, he lived amid the Babylonian Jews, who paid him every mark of respect. In that year Herod, who feared that Hyrcanus might induce the Parthians to help him regain the throne, invited him to return to Jerusalem. The Babylonian Jews warned him in vain. Herod received him with every mark of respect, assigning him the first place at his table and the presidency of the state council, while awaiting an opportunity to get rid of him. As the last remaining Hasmonean, Hyrcanus was too dangerous a rival for Herod. In the year 30 BCE, charged with plotting with the King of Arabia, Hyrcanus was condemned and executed. The later Herodian rulers Agrippa I and Agrippa II both had Hasmonean blood, as Agrippa I's father was Aristobulus IV, son of Herod by Mariamne I, but they were not direct male descendants, and thus not seen legitimate rulers by much of the Jewish population. Dissolution: formation of the Tetrarchies Herod died in 4 BCE, and his kingdom was divided among his sons, who became tetrarchs (\\"rulers of a quarter part\\"). One of these quarters was Judea corresponding to the region of the ancient Kingdom of Judah. Herod's son Herod Archelaus, ruled Judea so badly that he was dismissed in 6 CE by the Roman emperor Augustus, who appointed Quirinius to exercise direct Roman rule after an appeal from Herod Archelaus' own population, thus was formed the Province of Judea. Another, Herod Antipas, ruled as tetrarch of Galilee and Perea from 4 BCE to 39 CE, being then dismissed by Caligula.

The attraction is aimed at teenagers 13 & up as well as young adults. A Nightmare On Q Street is open on select weeknights and every weekend in October along with one weekend in September and November. About In 2003, The Haunted Valley was created as a free Halloween display by The Miller Family in their backyard for all the neighborhood to experience. It was a themed walk-through display of Halloween props, sets and featured about 4 to 5 kids acting as zombies, monsters, ghosts, etc. Every year more changes would be made to add on to the previous year.alt= In 2006, the name was changed to Death Demo and featured more detailed ideas and was intended for teens only. Guests would start out on one side of the families house and make their way through the haunted maze that ended on the other side of the house. For the 2007 season, the name was changed to Shadows of the Unknown to show that the haunt was becoming a more serious project and wasn't just a family-oriented Halloween display. Shadows of the Unknown started using social networking sites such as Myspace, YouTube, and Facebook to spread word throughout Omaha. After friends and family started spreading the word about the free haunted house, The Miller Family needed a new location that could house all the guests pouring into the neighborhood to experience the haunt. After months of searching for building and lots to rent, a letter was written to Fun-Plex asking if they would want to team up with Shadows of the Unknown and have a haunted scream park during the Halloween season. Fun-Plex wrote back and soon after, work began on the new project. Shadows of the Unknown was officially changed to A Nightmare On Q Street (Fun-Plex is located at 7003 Q. Street). The haunted attraction was built on the lot that formerly housed the bumper cars and now has a basic facade resembling an abandoned building. Today, A Nightmare On Q Street has gained attention throughout the city of Omaha including hosting blood drives from The Red Cross, radio ticket give- aways, and is featured on Omaha news stations. Promotions for A Nightmare On Q Street have been aired throughout October on select radio stations along with posters and coupons at various stores and businesses throughout the city. As of 2011, A Nightmare On Q Street has partnered with many sponsors including Ronald McDonald House Charities and Monster Energy.  The Attraction  The haunt is inside the old bumper cars building and has a basic mansion facade. Guest enter a small library room where they listen to a \\"preshow\\" about the character Mr. Raven and how demons have taken over the house. After the show is over guests are let into the rest of the house and experience a variety of original sets designed to scare them in every element. The layout of the attraction is completely changed for each season and takes roughly 8 months to construct. Each room consists of 1 to 3 actors and for the outside portion of the house there are typically 4 to 5 actors. The outside area of the attraction is completely changed and re-themed for each year as well. The entire attraction takes roughly 15 to 20 minutes for a group to complete. {  alt=  alt=  alt= }  References   External links  * Official Website * Nightmare On Q Street's Facebook Page * Fun-Plex Official Website * HauntWorld Listing * Monster Energy Official Website * Ronald McDonald House Charities Official Website Category:Amusement rides introduced in 2003 ","title":"A Nightmare on Q Street"},{"id":"33141528","text":"Johanna Charlotte of Anhalt-Dessau (6 April 1682 - 31 March 1750) was a princess of Anhalt-Dessau from the House of Ascania by birth and Margravine of Brandenburg-Schwedt by marriage.

Life  Johanna Charlotte was the youngest daughter of John George II, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau (1627-1693), from his marriage to Henriette Catherine of Nassau (1637-1708), daughter of Prince Frederick Henry of Orange.

In November 2017, its parent company B. Lane Inc. filed for bankruptcy.  Founding  Fashion To Figure was co-founded by brothers Michael and Nicholas Kaplan, two of Lena Bryant's great-grandsons. Their father, Steven, was president of Lane Bryant until its sale to The Limited Inc. in 1982. Nicholas Kaplan previously served as a Saks Fifth Avenue department manager and buyer, general merchandise manager at Bluefly, and co-founder of the Designer Warehouse liquidation chain. Michael Kaplan served as an analyst at Lazard and co-founded an online shopping community for plus-sized women with RRE Ventures. The brothers grew up hearing stories about how their widowed great-grandmother supported herself by selling the first maternity and full-figure dresses available to American women, inspiring them to carry on their family's tradition.  Operation  The first Fashion To Figure store opened at the Palisades Center Mall in West Nyack, New York in October 2004. The second store opened in 2005 at the Livingston Mall in Livingston, New Jersey. By 2011, Fashion To Figure had seven locations in New York and New Jersey. Two more stores were slated to open in fall 2011. The company launched its online store in 2010, which serves an international customer base. The store caters exclusively to women and teenagers sized 12 to 26. The chain is named for a quote by Lena Bryant, founder of the plus-sized women's clothing chain Lane Bryant. Asked in 1950 by a Glamour magazine interviewer about the secret of her success, Bryant said, \\"You should never ask women to conform their figures to fashion, but rather bring fashion to the figure.\\" Unlike most other plus-sized specialty retailers, Fashion To Figure is not a vertically integrated retailer, but sources its inventory from more than one hundred vendors. The company's CEO, Michael Kaplan, believes this allows it to provide plus-sized consumers with more choices and to react more nimbly to fashion trends, √† la fast fashion.

Ngota's widow denied this claim and his family requested an investigation be done that included the family and was separate from any possible government interference. In September 2010, the findings of a government agency's inquiry were presented. The family felt these findings were unreliable and \\"opaque\\".  Context  Ngota was working on an assignment for the Cameroun Express with three other journalists. They had received a document which alleged corruption in a state-run oil company called Soci√©t√© Nationale des Hydrocarbures (SNH). The document purportedly implicated Laurent Esso, secretary-general of the presidency, in paying three SNH managers an unusually high commission. Ngota and the other three journalists sent questions to Esso and were subsequently arrested and questioned about the memo that they had received. The journalists were released after several days. They were then charged with falsifying government documents, and Ngota and two other journalists were arrested once more. One of the journalists, Simon Herv√© Nko'o, had already gone into hiding. The other two journalists were eventually freed from prison, but not until Robert Mintya had been attacked and considerable pressure had been put on the government by Reporters Without Borders.Reporters Without Borders. 2010. \\"Newspaper editors released conditionally after eight months in Kondengui prison.\\" Retrieved 21 September 2011 .  Impact  Ngota was the first journalist to die in the line of duty in Cameroon since 1992, and as a result it drew more light to the state of affairs there for journalists. The imprisonment of journalists and Ngota's death caused human rights groups to reassess press freedom in Cameroon. His death and the events surrounding it caused Cameroon to drop 20 places in the 2010 press freedom index released by Reporters Without Borders. His death further drew more attention to the incarceration of Serge Sabouang and Robert Mintya, eventually leading to their release. A year and a half after Ngota's death, Reporters Without Borders did an inspection of press freedoms in Cameroon before the country's 9 April elections. According to its observations, the incumbents had a perceivable advantage over the opposition in terms of visibility and media coverage. The government announced that it would hold a conference on media but Reporters Without Borders noted that none of the laws, like the ones that led to Ngota's arrest and death had been changed. According to the press freedom organisation, journalism was not recognised as a profession that needed special protections and violations in Cameroon were treated as if they were criminal offences with bureaucrats holding significant power over the legal process in such cases. The organisation also noted that Cameroon's press laws were outdated and did not take account of new technologies like the Internet.Africa News. \\"After Visiting Country, Reporters Without Borders Urges Govt to Take Action.\\" 5 October 2011.

History =Formation and early years (1887‚Äì1895)= The exact details of the formation of Wycombe Wanderers F.C. has largely been lost to history. Four histories have been published, Ted Rolph's in 1957, Steve Daglish's in 1984, John Goldsworthy's in 1990 and Steve Peart and Dave Finch's in 1996. These are the only sources, in addition to the local newspaper the Bucks Free Press which detail the formation of the club. Ted Rolph's notes of a conversation with John Randell, Wycombe Wanderers first ever goalkeeper, only published in 1996, provide perhaps the best information available. John Randell explains that a group of young lads from Wheelers Field, an area to the north of High Wycombe, started a team to play matches in 1884. This team was called North Town Wanderers. In 1887, a meeting was called by Jim Ray, backed by Datchet Webb at the Steam Engine Public House in Station Road, High Wycombe. The first item on the agenda was the name of the club. The name North Town Wanderers was proposed by Noel Curtis but John Randell proposed the name Wycombe Wanderers, on the grounds that some of the players lived in other parts of the town. After a heated discussion the name Wycombe Wanderers was agreed. The meeting also resulted in the appointments of Brewers Drayman Billy Dimmock as Chairman, Datchet Webb as Captain, George Cook as treasurer and Jim Ray as Secretary. It is highly likely the club was named Wanderers after the famous Wanderers F.C., winners of the first F.A. Cup in 1872, who visited the town on 15 December 1877 and defeated High Wycombe 9‚Äì0 en route to their fifth and final F.A. Cup triumph. The varsity colours of Oxford and Cambridge blue were also chosen, although the club had no direct connection with the Universities, the players being local working men. The meeting also saw the club apply and gain junior status and began its inaugural season playing friendly matches and competing in the High Wycombe Challenge Cup. The club's first ever game was a goal-less draw against the Wycombe Nose Club on 24 September 1887. In 1889‚Äì1890 the club committee decided to enter, in great secrecy, two teams in the High Wycombe Challenge Cup. The reserves were entered as Wycombe Wanderers whilst the first team adopted the name Wild West. They beat High Wycombe 2‚Äì0 in the final in a second replay, after the first two matches ended one-each. Jim Ray and Edward Crook scored the goals to secure the first much coveted trophy for the club.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 11. . The early years saw the club change its headquarters, using a number of public houses close to the Rye. In addition to the Steam Engine, they included the Masons Arms and the Nags Head. The Rye was, and still is today, a long stretch of public land to the east of the town centre. In 1891 the club secured the use of the Cricket Ground for a Junior Cup tie. This enabled the club to charge spectators and keep out the rowdy element which afflicted all football at the time. The following season saw the club use the cricket ground on a regular basis. At the start of the 1893‚Äì94 season the club managed to secure use of Spring Meadow for a ¬£5 annual rent. Integral in this move was right-back Charley Harper, who became secretary. The move was a great success, with a 2,000 crowd recorded for a friendly against Wolverton London and North Western Railway. There was also a Cup double, with victories in both the High Wycombe Challenge Cup and the Maidenhead Norfolkians Cup. Despite the success, there was some discontent in the summer of 1894 as many of the players wanted the club to retain its junior status. At a meeting in the Nags Head in July, the proposal that Wanderers enter the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup, the FA Amateur Cup and the FA Cup was carried unanimously. The club's first taste of Amateur Cup football ended in a 5‚Äì1 defeat at West Herts; however, the High Wycombe Challenge Cup was retained. At the end of the 1894‚Äì95 season the club was informed that Spring Meadow had been sold, and it was soon built over by the London Marylebone railway line. The club approached Lord Carrington, who owned Wycombe Abbey and the surrounding estate including Loakes Park who responded by letter stating he had no objections. The club's AGM saw the General Committee enlarged to fifteen members and the Match Committee (which selected the teams) set at six. The Nags Head remained the club's headquarters but the Red Lion Hotel was to be used as the team's changing facilities. The first competitive game at Loakes Park was also the club's first ever FA Cup tie. A first qualifying round fixture against Wolverton London and North Western Railway, which ended in an unlucky 3‚Äì2 defeat. The move to Loakes Park proved to be a real catalyst and the club played a friendly fixture against FA Amateur Cup holders Middlesbrough. The ground also hosted its first female game. The season also saw the birth of an intense and bitter rivalry with Marlow when the teams met in the first round proper of the F.A. Amateur Cup. 1,500 Wanderers fans travelled the five miles to the Crown Ground, many of whom walked, and they were part of 2,700 crowd who witnessed a thrilling match. An Ellerton goal four minutes from time sealed a 3‚Äì2 win for Marlow. In May 1896 the club learned that their application to join the Southern League had been accepted.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 15-18. . =The Southern League years (1896‚Äì1908)= Entering the league was a big gamble, with away games as far as Bristol and Southampton but the club was keen to get away from friendly games and provide more attractive home games for their supporters. It was also a league dominated by professional teams, and rumours circulated that the club was to turn professional. However, the club saw no need and competed as amateurs. 1896 The club finished fifth its first season in the Southern League Second Division and the rivalry with Marlow continued with defeat by ten men in the final of the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup in front of 4,000. It was to become a recurring theme, as two further painful defeats followed in 1899 and 1900. The latter proved to be a controversial match, with Marlow captain Ted Shaw walking off the pitch in protest at having three goals ruled out for offside, and he was followed by his goalkeeper. The game continued without them and they were persuaded to re-join the match. Marlow equalised in the last minute of the game by bundling Wanderers goalkeeper Ernie Wheeler into the back of net after he had held onto the ball for too long. This time the Wanderers players refused to play extra-time; however, the game eventually started as dusk began to fall. Marlow went on to lead 4‚Äì3 with six minutes remaining when the ball was kicked onto the railway embankment. The crowd refused to give the ball back and pitch was engulfed by supporters. The referee abandoned the match and Wycombe refused to play the remaining six minutes; the cup was subsequently awarded to Marlow. It would prove to be a watershed moment, particularly for Marlow, whose victory would be their last for 91 years. Wycombe refused to enter the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup in the 1900‚Äì01 season in protest.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Pages 21‚Äì22. . In the summer of 1899 the club vacated Loakes Park temporarily to allow for the infamous bent pitch to be straightened. The club began playing at the alternative venue of Barrack Meadow, but only three games were played there as it was against military rules to charge admission on the ground. The Wanderers moved to Daws Hill Park, part of Wycombe Abbey Park, on a former hockey pitch. Although Lord Carrington kindly allowed the club to use the ground rent free, they had to build a bridge over the Dyke from the Rye as the main gates weren't allowed to be used. The club returned to Loakes Park for the start of the 1901‚Äì02 season and the holy grail, the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup was finally won. The final was played at Maidenhead against Slough and goals from Bill Buchanan, Bob White and Fred 'Sunny' Rouse gave the Blues a 3‚Äì0 win. It was the club's first win as a senior side, and the club felt it had truly established itself. Fred Rouse became the Chairboys first professional player when he signed professional forms for Shepherds Bush.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 23. . The summer of 1903 saw Bernard \\"Bunny\\" Hooper become captain and Loakes Park was improved with a fund initiated to build a stand. The stand was completed in January 1904. The following season saw the Wanderers denied the first appearance in the first round proper of the FA Cup, losing 4‚Äì1 to Brentford at Loakes Park. In 1904 the club became the last Amateur club to compete in the Southern League. This soon became a distinct disadvantage and results soon suffered. Attendances and gate receipts fell. The 1905‚Äì06 saw the club finish bottom of the Southern League Second Division. Debate followed whether the club should embrace professionalism but there was little appetite for turning their back on the amateur game. The 1906‚Äì07 season also saw the Blues finish bottom and the worst ever season in the club's history followed in 1907‚Äì08. The club won just one of its 18 league games. =The pursuit of purpose (First World War) (1908‚Äì1921)= In the summer of 1908 Charley Harper tendered his resignation for the third time and it was reluctantly accepted. He had played a crucial role in the development of the club and his loss was greatly felt. The Wanderers were invited to retain their membership of the Southern League but declined, accepting that it was clearly no place for amateurs. The club joined the Great Western Suburban League 1908 in an effort to boost income that local derbies could generate. The club enjoyed its best ever league season in 1908‚Äì09, finishing third and further success followed with a second Berks & Bucks Senior Cup triumph. Chesham Generals were beaten 3‚Äì0 in the final at Marlow. The match ball still exists today and can be found in current secretary Keith Allen's office! The 1909‚Äì10 season saw the club record its all-time record victory, an 18‚Äì1 win over Staines with striker Fred Pheby notching seven. The club continued to enjoy life in the Great Western Suburban League and the taste of success in the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup became very familiar with victories in 1910 (a 3‚Äì0 replay win over Wokingham Athletic) and 1913 (a 2‚Äì1 replay win over Maidenhead Norfolkians). The fourth round of the FA Amateur Cup was also reached in two successive seasons (1910 and 1911).Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 27. . Events off the pitch soon affected the club. In the autumn and winter of 1913 a major industrial dispute in the furniture trade in High Wycombe saw workers locked out and attendances were seriously affected. However, far more serious events were taking place in Europe and the First World War soon broke out. Wycombe players joined the two companies of Territorials and the Bucks Battalion. Loakes Park was used for training artillerymen and the club ceased to be active for the duration of the war. The club and football began to organise itself again and in the summer of 1919 the club held its AGM at the Red Lion Hotel and all stood for those who had lost their lives in the First World War. They included the following players; Charlie Buchanan, George Buchanan, Pat Carter, Bunny Fowler, Frank Langley, Jock Love, Jim McDermott, Edward Reynolds, A Saunders and Harry Stallwood.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 29. . In the addition to competing in the Great Western Suburban League the club also entered the Spartan League. The intention was to field sides of equal strength in both competitions but soon the Spartan League team became the senior side. It was captained by Frank Adams, a local man born in Downley. He joined the club in 1911 and was soon selected for the first team. He left to join Shepherd's Bush at the start of the 1912‚Äì13 season but re-joined Wycombe before the end of the year. He started playing as an inside-left before becoming established as an inside- right. After the First World War he made a successful switch to centre-half, although his versatility was one of his many strengths. He led the club to the Spartan League Championship, with the club scoring 114 goals in just 20 league matches. The 1920‚Äì21 season in 1921 saw the club do it again, retained its Spartan League title, this time plundering 108 goals. There were also exciting runs in both the FA Cup and FA Amateur Cup, with huge crowds watching the games. The Berks & Bucks Senior Cup was also won again, with a 5‚Äì2 victory over Slough in front of 9,875 fans at Elm Park, Reading. In March 1921 the whole town celebrated when the club's application to the Isthmian League was accepted. =The amateur years (1921‚Äì1974)= The Spartan League side had achieved great success and in style too. It featured many wonderful players, including Klon Smith, Tommy Jackman and Reg Boreham. However, the step up to the Isthmian League proved to be a tough one. However, this was amateur football at its finest and this was fully embraced by the club. For the next half a century the club's raison d'etre was to be the greatest Amateur side in the country. The 1920s saw 10 players leave the club to turn professional. In December 1921, perhaps the most successful player was Reg Boreham, who was invited to join Arsenal. He joined the Gunners and was widely credited with saving them from relegation that season. Wycombe finished their inaugural season in the Isthmian League in 8th place (out of 14 teams) and would record a best placed finish of 4th twice (in 1923/24 and 1925/26) during the decade. The Berks & Bucks Senior Cup was won in 1922/23 and 1924/25. In 1923 the stand at Loakes Park was redeveloped, including new changing rooms, at a cost of ¬£1,500. In the summer of 1925 Bernard Charles resigned as secretary which ended a 27-year association with the club. He was important and reliable character at the club and carried on much of the good work began by Charley Harper. In the summer of 1927 chairman George Miles announced that a 50-year lease on Loakes Park had been signed. In February 1929 Frank Adams, aged 37, played his last game for the club; however, his greatest contribution was yet to come. The 1930s started with the culmination of a dream as the club won the FA Amateur Cup for the only time in its history. London Caledonians, Walthamstow Avenue, Romford and the Metropolitan Police were all defeated as the Chairboys reached the semi-finals. The game was played at Newbury Park, Ilford and a brace from Alf Britnell and a goal from Bill Brown saw the side overcome a robust Woking side 3‚Äì0. Wycombe met Hayes in the final, at Highbury on 11 April 1931. 32,489 people watched a tight competitive game that was decided by a single goal with just five minutes remaining. The Wanderers were awarded a penalty for handball but Bill Brown saw his spot-kick saved. Alf Britnell was first to the rebound and buried the ball in the top corner to seal a glorious victory. The team took the famous cup home with them on the London Underground and an estimated crowd of 10,000 saw captain Pat Badrick hold the club aloft and speeches were made before a celebratory dinner for 400 was held at the town hall. Every player except Doug Vernon, an RAF man stationed nearby, lived within a five-mile radius of the town centre, a town with a population of 20,000. The profits from the cup run were used to build a 360' corrugated cover (affectionately known as the cowshed) along the length of the lower side of Loakes Park. It was said that Wycombe Wanderers became the first amateur club to have stands on opposite sides of the ground.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 37. . The following season saw the club's attempt to retain the FA Amateur Cup end with a 4‚Äì0 third round defeat at Yorkshire Amateurs. Another 4th-place finish in the Isthmian League helped establish the club and more improvements were made to Loakes Park, with enlarged changing rooms complete with tiled baths big enough for a whole team! Even the referee's room now had a bath. The 1932‚Äì33 season saw another exciting cup run with history being made in the FA Cup. The Blues saw off Gradwell's Sports Club, Maidenhead United, Park Royal, Slough and Camberley and Yorktown to reach the first round proper for the first time. The club was drawn away to Third Division (South) side Gillingham. A crowd of 6,400 at Priestfield saw the Wanderers go a goal down after 39th minutes to a strike from Liddle. However, the amateurs came back in the second half and Dick Braisher smashed home an equaliser with 15 to go. Despite an almighty goalmouth scramble the Blues held on to take the Gills back to Loakes Park for a replay. The replay was played on the following Wednesday afternoon and despite having to take time off work, 7,597 fans saw the home side recover from conceding a first minute own goal to go 2‚Äì1 up only for the professionals to come back and eventually win 4‚Äì2. The 1933‚Äì34 season was a disappointing one and the side failed to win a single league game away from home. The following season was even worse and the side had apply for re- election after finishing second from bottom. The club did, however, win the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup again, beating Aylesbury United 3‚Äì0 in the final. The worsening results saw the club advertise for a trainer / coach and former Bolton Wanderers player James Seddon was offered the role but refused the terms. The 1935‚Äì36 season saw some improvement, with a top half finish, and in 1936‚Äì37 the side played nine consecutive cup ties, and a promising FA Amateur Cup was halted by a 4‚Äì1 defeat at Stockton. During the 1938‚Äì39 campaign Loakes Park was used for Gas Chamber demonstrations as tensions in Europe increased with the Second World War looming. In June 1939 the local military and civil defence began to use the ground, and the stands and changing rooms were taken over the Billeting Authority and the Police. Despite this the 1939‚Äì40 Isthmian League began with a 4‚Äì0 home win over Woking and a 3‚Äì0 FA Cup Extra Preliminary Round win at Hounslow Town but the following day, 3 September 1939, Great Britain declared war on Germany. Unlike the First World War, the Club remained active during the conflict and played in the Great Western Combination. On Boxing Day 1939, 5,000 people watched Wycombe Wanderers win the Berks & Bucks Emergency Senior Cup beating Wycombe Redfords 4‚Äì0 at Loakes Park. During the war the side was captained and run by Jock McCallum, unable to join the war because of a perforated ear drum. He called upon many ex- players and after one game against Slough, the team had to walk the 15 miles back to High Wycombe. In 1944‚Äì45 the side became Great Western Combination champions, finishing seven points ahead of Maidenhead United.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 38. . After the war football resumed remarkably quickly and the 1945‚Äì46 season began with a 4‚Äì3 defeat by eventual Champions Walthamstow Avenue at Loakes Park. The Blues finished 9th. The 1946‚Äì47 season was one of the most important in the club's history, providing a legacy that has lasted until 2009. Frank Adams began negotiations with Lord Carrington to purchase Loakes Park for the football club. On 19 April 1947 before an Isthmian League game with Corinthian Casuals at Loakes Park, Frank Adams presented the deeds to Club President C P Vine. This single altrustic act secured the future of the club and paved the way for the successes that followed. The following season saw the side reach the Quarter-Finals of the FA Amateur Cup for the first time since the competition was won in 1931. Unfortunately the Wanderers crashed 6‚Äì2 to a team that would prove to be something of a nemesis in the decade that followed, one that is arguably the greatest amateur club to have played in England and one that shares the varsity colours, namely Bishop Auckland. In 1949‚Äì50 the club went one step further, reaching the semi-finals after seeing off Maidenhead United, Bungay Town, Crook Town and Dulwich Hamlet. The Quarter-Final tie saw the Blues face St Albans City and a record crowd of 15,850 crammed into Loakes Park. This remains the club's largest ever home attendance. Goals from Jock McCallum (2), Ken Butler and Henri Mikrut earned a 4‚Äì1 win. The semi-final was played at Griffin Park, Brentford against Bishop Auckland. 30,453 people and a TV audience watched an exciting game which saw the Bishops take a 2‚Äì0 lead. Johnny Way pulled goal back but were denied an equaliser by some fine goalkeeping. The season did finish on a high with the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup being retained after a 1‚Äì0 replay win over Slough Town. The 1950‚Äì51 season was a disappointing one and the club decided to employ a full-time coach for the first time. James McCormick was appointed, and the 1951‚Äì52 season saw the team reached the quarter-finals of the FA Amateur Cup, losing 2‚Äì0 to Barnet at Underhill in front of a record crowd of 11,026 (which still stands today). Wanderers legend Jock McCallum was dropped from the first team soon after McCormick arrived and he moved to Aylesbury United, and wrecked revenge by knocking the Blues out of the FA Cup, scoring the winning goal in a 2‚Äì1 win at Loakes Park. McCormick left at the end of the season, his attempts to modernise the club weren't particularly well received by some. He was replaced by Sid Cann, an appointment that heralded a spell of great success. His first season was a relatively quiet one, but that was followed by a successful season in 1953‚Äì54 with a third-place finish in the Isthmian League and another Berks & Bucks Senior Cup triumph, Slough Centre being beaten 3‚Äì1 in a replay. Sid Cann was beginning to build a formidable team, one that could rightful challenge for the title of the greatest amateur side in the country. Two young lads made their debuts in 1954 and would go to become legends in their own right. Paul Bates, born in High Wycombe, was a prolific centre-forward, and scored more than 300 goals for the Chairboys. Many of those goals were supplied by Len Worley, born in Chalfont St. Peter, a right-winger who was known as the Stanley Matthews of amateur football. Despite breaking his leg twice, he played as an amateur for both Charlton Athletic and Tottenham Hotspur, but he was at home at Wycombe Wanderers and the fans were very happy to have him. The 1954‚Äì55 season saw the Blues embark on another FA Amateur Cup run, Wealdstone, Woking and Ilford were beaten and faced the famous Pegasus team in the quarter-finals. 14,000 at a snow-bound Loakes Park saw the home side do everything but score and the visitors escaped with a goalless draw. The replay at Iffley Road saw the Wanderers come from a goal down to win 2‚Äì1 with a last minute winner from Jackie Tomlin. Once again Bishop Auckland stood in Wycombe's way, and the semi-final at Belle Vue, Doncaster, was a tight affair. Over 5,000 Chairboys travelled north and was soon cheering as the Bishops missed a 13th-minute penalty. However, the Wembley dream was shattered when Oliver scored the winner with 19 minutes remaining. The 1955‚Äì56 season was one of triumph. Wanderers cup-runneth over as they tasted more glory, reaching the first round proper of the FA Cup for only the second time in their history. It started with a 15‚Äì1 replay win over Witney Town, after the first game ended goalless. It ended with a 3‚Äì1 defeat by Burton Albion in front of 9,696 at Loakes Park. On New Year's Eve 1955 Wycombe went top of the Isthmian League with a 6‚Äì2 thrashing of Romford and they stayed at the top of the tree until 21 April 1956, when 6,000 fans at Loakes Park cheered a 3‚Äì0 win over Dulwich Hamlet that secured the club first ever Isthmian League title. It had been a long wait, and it was achievement that was celebrated even more for that fact. But it wasn't to end there, the following season ended in more glory as Wycombe retained the title, secured with a 3‚Äì2 win at home to Corinthian Casuals on the last day of the season. Even greater excitement had preceded it as the club made it to the FA Amateur Cup final at Wembley. St Albans City, Clapton and Hounslow Town were beaten and Ilford were the opponents for the quarter-final at East London sides Newbury Park ground. 5,000 Wycombe fans travelled in torrential rain, and the pitch was a quagmire but the game went on. They watched a see-saw game that ended in a 3‚Äì3 draw and the replay a week later at Loakes Park saw 15,500 people squeeze in to see the home side win 2‚Äì0. The semi-final was played at Highbury, scene of the club's 1931 triumph and opponents Corinthian Casuals contributed fully to an incredible tussle, which enraptured the 28,197 crowd. Norman Kerruish gave Casuals a first-minute lead, but Paul Bates header home an equaliser just three minutes later. He gave the Blues the lead on 20 minutes but Jack Laybourne made it 2‚Äì2 on the half hour. Wycombe Captain Frank Westley hobbled off on the hour and were soon down to nine men when Frank Smith dislocated his shoulder. Goalkeeper Dennis Syrett then injured himself when he collided with a post. Westley returned to play on the wing, and his incredible strength and determination helped galvanise the team. With twenty minutes to go Paul Bates crossed for Len Worley to head home. With five minutes left Worley was put in on goal and he fired home to give the Wanderers a magnificent 4‚Äì2 win. An incredible crowd of 90,000, the largest a Wycombe team has ever played in front of, was at Wembley, with more than 15,000 from High Wycombe, to watch the final on 13 April 1957. The opponents were, predictably, Bishop Auckland. Both sides kit colours clashed and were both obliged to change according to the rules. Both chose their red change colours, and Wycombe won the toss, with the Bishops choosing to wear white shirts with black shorts. They were still the hot-favourites and took the lead on 13 minutes through William Russell. The Wanderers managed to withstand more pressure and slowly fought their way back. On 38 minutes Wycombe grabbed an equaliser, Frank Smith fired home after a neat dummy. Unfortunately parity lasted just two minutes, Derek Lewin poking home from close range. The Wanderers came out in the second half and only Bishops goalkeeper Harry Sharratt denied them an equaliser, brilliantly saving from Worley and then stopping a Bates header. Bishop Auckland grabbed a decisive third goal on 71 minutes when Warren Bradley found the net through a crowd of players. A 3‚Äì1 defeat was hard to take but it was fair result. Thousands lined the streets of High Wycombe to greet the returning team and each player took a bow on the portico of the Red Lion Hotel.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 45. . Maintaining such a high level of success was always going to be difficult and so it proved. A third successive title was just out reach, the Blues finishing as runners-up, four points behind Tooting & Mitcham United. The Berks & Bucks Senior Cup was won again, Maidenhead United beaten 1‚Äì0 at Oak Tree Road, Marlow. The FA Cup first round proper was reached again, but Northampton Town scored two late goals to win 2‚Äì0 at the County Ground. An unbeaten 12-match start to the league season wasn't enough as Wimbledon stormed to the title, the Blues finishing third. In 1959‚Äì60, yet more history was made as the club reached the second round proper of the FA Cup for the first time, beating Wisbech Town 4‚Äì2. They were rewarded with a local derby against Watford, and 23,907 saw the Blues eventually 5‚Äì1 at Vicarage Road. There was another runners-up finish in the league, and Maidenhead United were defeated again in the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup final, this time a 3‚Äì0 win at Elm Park, Reading. As the decades changed, so did the team and its fortunes. Many stalwarts left the club and the 1960‚Äì61 was a disappointing one, with the side finishing in 8th place. Coach Sid Cann left in the summer to return to the Football League with Norwich City. He was replaced by Colin McDonald in August 1961 but resigned in September for \\"domestic reasons.\\" He was succeeded by Graham Adams. The 1961‚Äì62 season saw the debut of a young Tony Horseman, who played on the left- wing and scored in a 3‚Äì2 defeat at Oxford City. At the end of the season Adams left and Don Welsh became the new coach. The season was notable due to the severe winter and the team played just once between Boxing Day 1962 and 5 March 1963. It also saw Dave Bassett appear for the Blues. The team strip was changed for the 1963‚Äì64 season from quarters to stripes, traditionally worn by the reserve side. It was, however, an unpopular choice and quarters were reinstated the following year. On 25 September 1963, the match between Wycombe Wanderers and Enfield saw floodlights used for the first time at Loakes Park. Goalkeeper John Maskell made his debut for the side at the start of the 1964‚Äì65 season but suffered the misfortune of breaking his ankle in a 7‚Äì0 FA Cup tie defeat at Hayes. Results weren't any better in the league and after a 9‚Äì2 defeat at Hendon in December Coach Don Welsh resigned and former player Barry Darvill took over. The team slowly managed to improve under Darvill and league campaign during the 1965‚Äì66 season ended with more than 100 goals scored through the deadly trio of Paul Bates, Tony Horseman and Keith Samuels. Guildford City denied the side a trip to Loftus Road to play Queens Park Rangers in the FA Cup in a 1‚Äì0 replay win at Loakes Park and Hendon ended a FA Amateur Cup at the quarter-final stage with a 2‚Äì1 win at Claremont Road. Results continued to improve and in 1966‚Äì67 the team finished in third place. Tony Horseman scored a sensational 60 goals in just 51 first team appearances during the campaign. There was also an extraordinary first round F.A. Cup tie with Bedford Town that went to three replays, eventually won 3‚Äì2 by the home side at the Eyrie. It was also the season when the substitute was introduced in English football and on 24 September 1966 Martin Priestley had the honour when he replaced an injured John Maskell during a 4‚Äì1 home win over Barking The 1967‚Äì68 season saw Paul Bates play his last game for the Wanderers and the team struggled. Despite another Berks & Bucks Senior Cup victory, a 3‚Äì2 win over Slough Town at the Meadow, Chesham, the most notable result was a hugely embarrassing 1‚Äì0 defeat in the FA Amateur Cup to City of Norwich School Old Boys. In December 1968 Barry Darvill resigned and the club approached Brian Lee, upon a recommendation from the Football Association. Brian Lee was appointed in December and took charge of his first game on 28 December 1968, a 0‚Äì0 draw at Clapton Lee's appointed was a real watershed moment for the club and within a month Lee was picking the team and the Selection Committee was disbanded. Lee's impact was even greater, and he started to rebuild the team in the summer of 1969. The reserve side was disbanded, due to limited resources. The quartered kit were also changed, the side wearing plain Cambridge blue shirts and Oxford blue shorts. Geoff Anthony, Peter Suddaby, John Delaney, Johnny Hutchinson and Keith Searle all joined the club and the side finished as runners-up in the league to Enfield Wanderers legend Len Worley played his last game for the club, as a substitute in a 1‚Äì0 win at Croydon Amateurs on 13 December 1969. He played 512 games for Wycombe, scoring 67 goals. Ted Powell, Larry Pritchard and Paul Fuschillo joined the club in the summer of 1970 and a hugely talented team won the club's third Isthmian League title, pipping Sutton United to the Championship by just one point. The quarter-finals of the FA Amateur Cup were reached again, but Skelmersdale United stunned at 10,203 crowd winning 3‚Äì0 at Loakes Park. The title was retained the following season as the side flew out of the traps, losing just one of its first 22 league matches, scored 102 goals in 40 games. The club was, however, determined to repeat its one and only FA Amateur Cup triumph and Aveley, Spennymoor United, Walton and Hersham and Hayes were beaten as the Blues reached the semi-final. It was played at Griffin Park, Brentford, scene of defeat in the semi-final of 1950. The opponents this time were Isthmian League rivals Hendon Wycombe were missing the influential Larry Pritchard through injury. The majority of the 9,210 crowd travelled from High Wycombe and they were aghast to see the Dons take the lead against the run of play after 14 minutes. Johnny Hutchinson equalised on 60 minutes but Hendon grabbed a winner with a lon-range shot that stood despite appeals that a Hendon player was in an offside position. The 1972‚Äì73 season was one of relative disappointment as the side could only finish in 4th place. The season ended with the departure of captain John Delaney who turned professional with AFC Bournemouth. Terry Reardon and Keith Mead joined in the summer and their battling qualities complimented the skillful players already in the team. It paid off as the side regained the Isthmian League title, remaining unbeaten at Loakes Park. The Isthmian League had expanded, and the league gained a sponsor, being renamed Rothmans Isthmian League Division One. Yet more excitement came in the FA Cup as the side battling through the qualifying rounds to face Newport County in the first round. A brace from Steve Perrin and one from Dylan Evans secured a 3‚Äì1 win and history was made, for it was the club's first ever victory over a Football League team. The run was ended in the second round, as Peterborough United won 3‚Äì1 at Loakes Park. There was some disappointment as the club's last attempt to win the FA Amateur Cup was foiled by a 2‚Äì1 defeat at Blyth Spartans, the winner coming from a Keith Mead own goal. =The loss of purpose (1974‚Äì1984)= Amateurism was abolished by the Football Association in the summer of 1974. The players now became \\"semi- professionals.\\" This change had little effect on the club at first. In fact the 1974‚Äì75 season was one of the greatest it had enjoyed. It started in inglorious fashion as the club forgot to send in the qualifying round exemption form and had to battle through to the first round proper of the FA Cup. They faced Cheltenham Town and a 3‚Äì1 win at Loakes Park was sealed by a solo run by right-back Paul Birdseye. The club was drawn at home to AFC Bournemouth in the second round, and former captain John Delaney returned and his side escaped with a 0‚Äì0 draw. The replay at Dean Court saw the Blues trail 1‚Äì0 at half-time but a roasting from Brian Lee saw the side come out and Tony Horseman soon grabbed an equaliser. It was Horseman again who fired in a shot which cannoned off teammate Steve Perrin and into the net to give the Wanderers a 2‚Äì1 victory. The club had made history again, reaching the third round of the FA Cup for the first time. The opposition were to be first division Middlesbrough, then top of the table and managed by Jack Charlton. The game at Loakes Park was covered by London Weekend Television's Big Match cameras and Boro scraped a 0‚Äì0 draw. The side travelled up to Ayresome Park for the replay and a 30,128 crowd saw the semi-pros hold out until the last minute when David Armstrong slipped the ball past Maskell and into the bottom corner of the net. Middlesbrough's players applauded the Wycombe players off the pitch and the home crowd chanted \\"Wycombe, Wycombe.\\" The Boro Chairman provided a case of Champagne to the gallant losers. Understandably, the run had taken its toll on the team and they were well off the pace in the league, 16 points behind Enfield with just a single game in hand. However, showing great determination they slowly reined in their title rivals, winning nine on the bounce and even had the chance to go top with just four games to go in a title decider but a tense game ended 0‚Äì0. It all came down to the final day of the season with the Wanderers at home to third placed Dagenham 3,800 people braved a cold and wet day to watch a nervy game and with five minutes to go it looked like they were destined to miss out. Striker Keith Searle decided that destiny still needed to be written and when he received the ball from a throw- in he turned and smashed in a shot from the corner of the penalty area. The ball flew into the top far corner of the net and the terrace behind the goal at the Gasworks End erupted in ecstasy. Wycombe held on to win 1‚Äì0 and retained the title with a superior goal difference of 0.1. There was some controversy in the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup when after a 4‚Äì0 extra time victory over Thatcham Town at the Meadow, Chesham, the side refused to collect their winners medal and cup in protest at the Berks & Bucks F.A's refusal to allow the club to compete in the London Senior Cup.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 56. . The summer of 1975 saw the side begin to break-up. The abolition of amateur football saw other top non-league clubs pay players more than Wycombe could reasonably afford. Alan Phillips, Gary Hand, Steve Perrin and Keith Searle all left the club. Searle's loss was particularly galling as he joined rivals Enfield and they finished five points ahead in the league as the Wanderers finished the 1975‚Äì76 season as runners-up. They did reach the second round of the FA Cup after another marathon tie against Bedford Town, eventually winning the second replay 2‚Äì1. They were rewarded with a trip to Ninian Park to play Cardiff City and lost 1‚Äì0. There was an enjoyable two- legged final tie in the Anglo-Italian Trophy, and after a 1‚Äì0 defeat by AC Monza in Italy, the return leg saw goals from John Delaney and Dylan Evans seal a 2‚Äì1 aggregate win. In November 1975 Brian Lee announced he was to resign as manager at the end of the season. It marked the end of an era. Lee recommended former player Ted Powell as his replacement but he left in March 1977 after accepting a coaching job in Malawi. The 1976‚Äì77 season saw the side finish as runners-up to Enfield again. Much of the side's goals were provided by Ian Pearson who plundered 29 goals before leaving to join Millwall at the end of the campaign. The team also made the second round of the FA Cup again, and faced local rivals Reading at a frosty Loakes Park. Reading icon Robin Friday scored as the Royals took a 2‚Äì0 goal lead and Pearson nearly secured a replay after scoring a consolation goal before hitting a post. John Reardon took over from Powell as manager and continued for the following season. The side finished third in the league, now renamed the Premier Division and were surprisingly beaten 2‚Äì0 in the first round of the FA Cup at Minehead. Tony Horseman retired at the end of the season, having scored 416 goals in 746 games. Andy Williams took over as manager at the start of the 1978‚Äì79 season but the side could only muster a sixth-place finish. The 1979‚Äì80 saw more upheaval as the Alliance Premier League was formed. Designed to be the pinnacle of non-league football, the Isthmian League refused to join the pyramid structure. Wycombe Wanderers were invited to join the league but declined the offer as the idea of a national league, with increased travelling costs, was an unattractive one. Williams left and Brian Lee returned to take temporary charge of the team. In January 1980, Mike Keen took over as manager with the team languishing in the bottom half of the league. He guided the team to a 10th-place finish. For many years, the club's objective was to be the best amateur club in the country. The competition that replaced the FA Amateur Cup, the FA Trophy had seen the club slip to defeats in the early rounds and towards the end of the 1980‚Äì81 season Brian Lee, who had recently been elected as Chairman, applied for the club to join the Football League. It was partly as a protest against the Alliance Premier League's assertion that only their Champions could apply but he also wanted to see whether Loakes Park would pass the Ground Inspection test and the ground duly passed, with one or two minor modifications. The point having been made, Wycombe withdrew their application before the Football League's AGM. On the pitch the side improved and secured a third place league finish and the club reinstated its reserve team after an eleven-year absence.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 58. . The 1981‚Äì82 season began with the death of Frank Adams in September, aged 90. Manager Mike Keen again led the side to a third-placed finish in the Isthmian League Premier Division. The league had decided to join the pyramid and its champions would qualify for promotion. Wycombe were offered the opportunity to join the Alliance Premier League but again declined the invitation. The season would best be remembered for finally getting to grips with the F.A. Trophy, with a run to the semi- finals, seeing off Walthamstow Avenue, Hyde United, old rivals Bishop Auckland and Kidderminster Harriers along the way. The mighty Altrincham stood in the way of a return to Wembley. The first leg was played at Moss Lane and Ken Wilson gave the Blues a first half lead. Wycombe conceded a goal in the last minute and the side had to settle for a 1‚Äì1 draw. The second leg at Loakes Park was watched by 4,896. First choice goalkeeper Gary Lester was missing through injury and the team lost by 3 goals to nil. Mike Keen strengthened the side in the summer of 1982 with the arrival of Mark Hill and the return of Steve Perrin. Mike's son, Kevin, also appeared for the first team before joining West Ham United. Another FA Cup first round appearance ended in a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Bristol Rovers at Eastville. The team went top of the table in October and stayed there for the rest of the season. The side remained unbeaten for the last ten games of the season to secure the club seventh Isthmian League title. Yet again the club declined promotion to the Alliance Premier League and attendances soon began to drop, as the perceived lack of ambition together with the hooliganism of the early 1980s proved to be an unglamorous combination. The 1983‚Äì84 season was something of a nadir as the side finished 7th in the league and lost the Hitachi League Cup final to Sutton United. A crowd of just 349 watched a 2‚Äì1 home league defeat by Harlow Town in April 1984. At the end of the season the club decided not to offer Mike Keen a new contract. =The Football League dream (1984‚Äì1993)= Paul Bence was appointed as the new manager and began a rebuilding process bringing in strikers Simon Read and Declan Link from Staines Town. The Hitachi League Cup was won, Farnborough Town being beaten 5‚Äì1 over two legs. The side recovered from a slow start in the league to finish third, losing just three of their last 21 games. Champions Sutton United and runners-up Worthing were unable to go into the Gola League and Wycombe finally took the gamble and accepted the invitation to play in a national league for the first time in the club's history. It proved to be a struggle but the team found its feet and held its own until the last two months of the season. An FA Cup run played its part, as Wycombe Wanderers faced Fourth Division Colchester United in the first round. A game that was marred by crowd trouble saw Mark West give the Blues a third-minute lead and Simon read scored a second to seal a 2‚Äì0 victory. It was the game that began an unusual rivalry between two clubs who were more than 100 miles apart. The second round pitted the U's neighbours Chelmsford City against the Blues, and another 2‚Äì0 victory at Loakes Park saw more crowd trouble. The third round draw was rather unkind and an away tie at York City saw the Ministermen win 2‚Äì0. Two crucial factors during the season were the loss of striker Declan Link who left in November to work in the United States and the resignation of Manager Paul Bence in January, due to his business responsibilities. His assistant Alan Gane took over but were unable to halt the slide and the team lost eleven of the last 14 league games. It the penultimate home game of the season the team held Altrincham to goalless draw, left-back Graham Pearce lobbed the ball over his own goalkeeper from 30 yards and into the net. Even worse was to follow when on the final Saturday of the season Wycombe drew 0‚Äì0 at home to Kettering Town. Yet their fate wasn't sealed until the following day when relegation rivals Dagenham travelled to FA Trophy finalists Runcorn Dagenham's goalkeeper scored from a wind assisted goal kick in the opening minute. Despite a Runcorn equaliser in the second half the Daggers held onto a point and condemned Wycombe to the first relegation in their history, on goal difference and on equal points with three other clubs. There were also significant changes off the pitch during the season. Chairman Brian Lee had concluded that Loakes Park would not pass a ground inspection if the club were ever to seek promotion to the Football League and that there wasn't sufficient space or funding to redevelop the ground. The club entered into an agreement with a property company to fund the building of a new stadium and when the club had made the move, acquire Loakes Park for redevelopment. The ground wasn't owned by the football club, but held in trust. The trustees agreed that Loakes Park could be sold with the future of the club dependent on moving. Brian Lee also felt it would be too great an undertaking for the current Committee and approached local builder and developer Ivor Beeks and persuaded him to become involved in the project. In October 1986 Wycombe Wanderers Football Club Limited was activated and all the assets of the football club were transferred to it. The trustees also handed Loakes Park over to the new company.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 62. . The new board increased the club's weekly wage bill at manager Alan Gane's request as the club sought to bounce straight back to the Gola League.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 63. . New signings arrived including Kevin Durham and the sensational signing of Keith Barrett and Noel Ashford, both from Enfield, for a combined fee of ¬£9,000. Ashford soon established himself as a cult figure at Loakes Park and was nicknamed \\"God\\". The Blues won their first eight league games and it was soon clear that it would be a two horse race for the title with rivals Yeovil Town. There were two embarrassing cup defeats, a 5‚Äì1 thrashing at home to VS Rugby in the FA Cup and a 1‚Äì0 replay defeat at Leatherhead in the FA Trophy. However, there were two pieces of good news over the holiday period. Yeovil Town boss Gerry Gow resigned and former striker Declan Link returned from the United States. Despite a 1‚Äì0 defeat by Yeovil Town at Loakes Park, a game played in a violent atmosphere, the Wanderers closed in on the title and won the final seven games of the season to win their eighth, and final, Isthmian League Championship and promotion back to the GM Vauxhall Conference. They did it winning 32 of their 42 league matches, earning 101 points and scoring 103 goals. The joy of a return to the GM Vauxhall Conference was soon replaced by dismay when Alan Gane resigned after falling out with the new board. Gane wanted to sign some of the top players in non-league football but Chairman Brian Lee rejected the proposals as he was concerned that the wage bill would spiral out of control.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 64. . Former player Peter Suddaby was appointed as Gane's replacement and a 4‚Äì0 defeat at home to Stafford Rangers on the opening day was a sign of things to come. Worse was to follow when iconic striker Noel Ashford was sold to Barnet for a then record non-league fee of ¬£17,000. Dismay soon turned to disgust as local rivals Aylesbury United knocked the Blues out of the FA Cup in the first qualifying round, winning 2‚Äì0 at Buckingham Road. The nadir followed when Ashford returned to Loakes Park with Barnet and humiliated the home side with a 7‚Äì0 thrashing. Things improved slightly and the team hovered just above the relegation zone but a 5‚Äì1 thrashing at the hands of Maidstone United at Loakes Park on 2 January 1988 was the final straw. The club asked for the managers resignation and Peter Suddaby fell on his sword. The board came up with a short-list of two men for the vacancy, Jim Kelman and Martin O'Neill. Only two of the seven directors voted for O'Neill and Jim Kelman was the surprise choice. His first game in charge was a thrilling 5‚Äì3 win at home to Cheltenham Town and it proved to be a real catalyst as the new boss slowly guided the team to 18th place, nine points clear of relegation.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 65. . The 1988‚Äì89 season was surprisingly successful as Kelman built a side that achieved the club's highest ever league finish, fourth in the GM Vauxhall Conference. There was even hopes of the championship in the Spring of 1989 and 4,239 people saw the Wanderers beat Kidderminster Harriers 1‚Äì0 at Loakes Park, the largest attendance for more than a dozen years. That attendance was eclipsed a couple of months later when 4,890 witnessed Kettering Town steal a 1‚Äì0 win, the biggest Conference crowd that season. It was a result that put paid to any hopes of winning the league. They were also hopes of another Wembley visit in the FA Trophy, but 1,000 travelling Chairboys saw their dreams come crashing down on the plastic pitch of Hyde United, who created a shock by winning 1‚Äì0. Kelman had brought in players like Andy Robinson, Martin Blackler, Steve Abbley, Matt Crossley, John Kerr, Andy Kerr and Glyn Creaser, who cost ¬£15,000 from Barnet After the devastating blow of defeat by Hyde, Kelman pulled off a transfer coup, signing the highly rated Barnet striker Nicky Evans for a non-league record fee of ¬£32,000. Evans scored a brace on his debut against Boston United and hopes were high that the club could push on and challenge for the Football League again the following season. Kelman made more astute signings, bringing in Simon Stapleton and Steve Guppy. The team's results and performances were inconsistent. High-flying Barnet were beaten 1‚Äì0 and a 3‚Äì0 deficit at home to Kidderminister Harriers was turned around in dramatic fashion when John Kerr's diving header snatched a 3‚Äì3 draw five minutes from time. On the flip side Cheltenham Town handed out a 4‚Äì0 thrashing at Loakes Park and the team was hit for four again at Telford United. It was a hugely embarrassing 3‚Äì1 defeat at Loakes Park in the FA Trophy by the Metropolitan Police that heralded the end of Jim Kelman's reign. The cup exit played its part but the managers relationship with the board had been deteriorating for some time and Kelman handed in his resignation. Kelman's legacy would be there for all to see as his successor would build his historic side out of many of the players brought to the club by Kelman.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 70. . His successor was Martin O'Neill, the man rejected by the board last time out. He almost wasn't appointed this time either. He hadn't applied for the vacancy as he hadn't seen it advertised and Kenny Swain had been interviewed and was offered the job. Swain turned the position down after being promoted to assistant to Dario Gradi at Crewe Alexandra. O'Neill was only alerted to the job by new Wycombe director Alan Parry, who he bumped into purely by chance in the toilets at Carrow Road whilst both men were commentating on an FA Cup tie between Norwich City and Liverpool. O'Neill applied and after coming down to Adams Park, the building of which was in its advanced stages, he was unanimously offered the job. His first game in charge was a 1‚Äì1 draw at Merthyr Tydfil He soon made his presence felt, abolishing some of the traditions still around from the club's amateur days. He also showed his authority by dropping right-back Steve Abbley, a strong influence in the dressing room. He soon guided the team to mid-table security, even winning away at Champions Darlington and in doing so winning the Manager of the Month award. He also won his first trophy, a 2‚Äì1 extra time win against Slough Town in the Berks & Bucks Senior Cup at Hungerford Town's Bulpit Lane. The summer of 1990 was an emotional and significant one. After 95 years at Loakes Park, the club moved to their new ground at Adams Park. Loakes Park had become a real home, which everyone, from players to supporters, had become extremely fond of. The new ground was named after Frank Adams, a fine and truly appropriate gesture to the man who helped it become a reality. It was an essential one too as provided the financial base for the manager to build a team capable of achieving the club's dream of promotion to the Football League. Such an achievement wasn't going to be easy and Martin O'Neill started to add to the team he'd been left with. Keith Ryan was signed from Berkhamsted Town and Simon Hutchinson joined from Eastwood Town for ¬£7,000. Popular midfielder Kevin Durham left for Barnet for ¬£15,000. It was an exciting season from almost the first whistle, although the FA Cup run was almost stopped its tracks by Trowbridge Town who led 1‚Äì0 in a second qualifying round replay going into the last minute only for Nicky Evans to head home a priceless equaliser before snatching a sensational winning in the final minute of extra-time, beating two defenders before curling the ball home from twenty yards. After seeing off fellow Conference side Boston United 4‚Äì0 in a replay the Wanderers were drawn at home to Peterborough United in the second round. The original tie was snowed off and was the scene of a famous photograph taken by Stuart Clarke of BBC commentator John Motson stood on the snowbound pitch in his trademark sheepskin coat. The game was played on the following Wednesday evening and Posh goalkeeper Carl Bradshaw pulled off a series of incredible saves to deny the Blues, and in particular Nicky Evans. Martin Blackler finally found a way past him with a deflected shot but sub Paul Culpin snatched an equaliser to take it to a replay at London Road, which the Fourth Division side won 2‚Äì0. The league campaign was no less exciting, Mark West scored four goals in a 5‚Äì1 trouncing of runaway leaders Kettering Town, who had previously gone 15 games unbeaten. Mark West repeated the feat six weeks later, with Sutton United the victims. The new year saw Nicky Evans return to his former club Barnet for ¬£28,750 after requesting a transfer. he was replAced firstly by Mickey Nuttell, a ¬£6,000 signing from Cheltenham Town and then by Keith Scott, from Lincoln City, who eventually cost ¬£30,000. Wanderers spent most the season in fifth place and did the double over Kettering Town and arguably denied them the league title, as they did Colchester United, from whom they took four points. The greatest excitement was had in the FA Trophy, where Wealdstone, VS Rugby, Cheltenham Town and Northwich Victoria were seen off en route to the semi-finals. The draw wasn't particularly kind, pitting them against Altrincham, who had hit an amazing run of form, and were pushing for the Conference title. The first leg at Adams Park saw Alty take an early lead which was quickly cancelled out by a Dave Carroll equaliser. Keith Scott poached a winning goal with 18 minutes remaining and a lead was taken into the second leg at Moss Lane. It proved to be a nervous affair, Wycombe were desperate to make a return to Wembley, and take revenge for being denied that prize nine years previously by the same opponents. A tense first half ended in stalemate and just before the hour Mark West poked home from a corner to give the Wanderers a crucial lead. The home side lost their heads and were soon down ten men and in the last minute Keith Scott wrapped up a 4‚Äì1 aggregate win from the penalty spot. The Wanderers were back at Wembley and the celebrations went long into the night. Nearly 25,000 Wycombe fans travelled to Wembley, and were part of a record 34,842 crowd for a FA Trophy final at the old stadium. Keith Scott gave the Blues the lead and Kidderminster Harriers goalkeeper Paul Jones kept his team in it with a string of stunning saves. Just before the hour Dave Hadley's daisy cutter slipped under Wanderers goalkeeper John Granville, who played the game with a broken thumb. Wycombe weren't going to be denied as less than ten minutes later Keith Scott broke down the right wing and crossed for local hero Mark West to dive low and head in the winner! It was a fitting end to a sensational season. Average crowds at Adams Park rose from 1,800 to 2,800 and Mark West was crowned Conference Player of the Season after scoring 34 goals. The summer of 1991 saw the club installed as favourites for the Conference title alongside Colchester United. There was some very sad news when former player Kevin Durham died of a brain haemorrhage whilst on holiday. Wycombe's share of the gate receipts from the Conference Championship shield against his club Barnet were donated to a fund for his son. Martin O'Neill made two hugely influential signings, bringing in defender Jason Cousins from Brentford and goalkeeper Paul Hyde, a ¬£15,000 signing from Hayes The season started with seven successive wins but it all came crashing down in September with two successive home defeats. The first, a 1‚Äì0 reverse to Macclesfield Town was surrounded in controversy after John Timmons scored the winner after handling the ball. Both Mickey Nuttell and Jason Cousins were sent off and referee Royston Osbourne had been escorted from the pitch. Disaster was to follow a week later when title rivals Colchester United made the journey to Buckinghamshire in dreadful conditions. In driving rain and gale-force winds, and an ugly atmosphere which saw Police on horseback on the pitch, the visitors took an early second half lead through Nicky Smith but were soon pegged back by a Steve Guppy equaliser. The game seemed destined for a draw when in the last minute Colchester goalkeeper Scott Barrett's goal kick caught on the wind, bounced once over Hyde and into the top corner of the net. It was a massive blow but Martin O'Neill's men recovered and kept pace with their full-time adversaries. The return match in December was also one to forget, with the U's winning 3‚Äì0. The Blues went into the new year behind in points but with games in hand and despite disappointing cup exits at home to Kettering Town and Witton Albion, they continued the fight for the Championship. O'Neill signed some much sought after players, striker Kim Casey joined from Cheltenham Town for ¬£9,000, Dennis Greene arrived for ¬£15,000 from Chelmsford City and the real coup of local-rivals Slough Town tailsman Steve Thompson for ¬£25,000. In April, the Blues caught up in matches played and even overtook Colchester at the top of the league, but a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Macclesfield Town would prove costly. A 2‚Äì1 aggregate win over Runcorn saw the club win more silverware in the Bob Lord Trophy but the big prize was still up for grabs. An 86th minute at Gateshead from Keith Scottlooked to have put the Blues back on top of the league, but Colchester had snatched a late equaliser in a 4‚Äì4 draw at Macclesfield Town. The Wanderers were level on points with their Essex rivals, and despite a 5‚Äì0 thrashing away at Redbridge Forest, they were behind on goal difference going into the final day. A 4‚Äì0 thrashing of Witton Albion at Adams Park wasn't enough as Colchester United beat Barrow 5‚Äì0 to take the title with a nine better goal difference, both clubs having a then record conference tally of 94 points. It was a crashing disappointment and there was a failed summer campaign for the club to replace Aldershot, who had gone out of business. Martin O'Neill kept faith with the team that had come so close to promotion and the 1992‚Äì93 season started in similar fashion to the last one, with the side winning nine league games in a row. An exciting tie took place in the second round of the FA Cup, with the Blues drawn at home to Ossie Ardiles' Third Division side West Bromwich Albion. A stunning fightback, live on Sky TV, saw goals from Glyn Creaser and Steve Thompson take the Baggies back to the Hawthorns. The replay was also shown live, and an amazing 4,500 Wycombe fans made the journey to the black country. They saw Keith Scott hit a post before Bob Taylor snatched a goal winner just nine minutes from time. Even in injury-time the Wanderers came agonisingly close to snatching an equaliser, Steve Guppy just inches from connecting with a Simon Hutchinson cross. =The Football League (1993‚Äì2004)= Inspirational captain Glyn Creaser suffered a bad injury to his foot and when the side went on a run of four games without a win in February and March 1993, local rivals Slough Town came within four points of the Blues, having played two games more. The sides met at Adams Park and a then record crowd of 7,230, with many more locked out, saw a tense game that was decided by a 27th winner from Keith Scott. Wanderers had to play most of the second half with ten men when Andy Kerr was sent off, but some determined defending and fine goalkeeping from Paul Hyde ensured the three points. Martin O'Neill signed striker Tim Langford from Telford United for ¬£15,000 and the sides went on another run in the FA Trophy. Wins over Cheltenham Town, Morecambe, Bromsgrove Rovers and Gateshead led the club to semi-final with Sutton United, managed by former boss Alan Gane. The U's sprung a great shock by winning the first leg at Adams Park 3‚Äì2. The tie was missed by Keith Scott through injury and he even took to an oxygen chamber to get fit for the second leg. The tension was palpable as more than half the 5,002 crowd at Gander Green Lane travelled to support the Blues. Keith Scott was declared fit and after a number of missed chances, centre-back Matt Crossley headed home from a corner and immediate sunk to his knees with a mixture of joy and relief. The visitors came out in the second half and grabbed the tie by the throat. On 48 minutes Keith Scott headed home from a Guppy corner and three minutes later Matt Crossley swept home another corner, this time from Dave Carroll, to make it 3‚Äì0. Keith Scott was replaced by Mark West with 15 minutes and within three minutes with his first touch he crossed for Dave Carroll to finish emphatically to make it 4‚Äì0. The 6‚Äì3 aggregate win saw the Blues go back to Wembley and the pitch was engulfed by celebrating fans at the final whistle. The following week there was even more celebrations, after a 1‚Äì1 draw with nearest challengers Slough Town, a 5‚Äì1 thrashing of Runcorn at Adams Park, including a sensational solo goal from Steve Guppy, saw the Wanderers all but seal promotion to the Football League. One trophy did prove elusive as Northwich Victoria came to Adams Park and won the Drinkwise Cup 3‚Äì2 in extra time. The FA Trophy final at Wembley saw 28,000 Wycombe fans make the short, but increasingly familiar journey to face Runcorn Jason Cousins smashed home a free-kick after just two minutes and Andy Kerr headed home a second 20 minutes later. Steve Shaughnessy pulled a goal back for the Linnets just before half-time. Just before the hour mark Steve Thompson headed home a Steve Guppy corner to make it 3‚Äì1 and Wycombe missed a number of chances to extend their lead. Dave Carroll made it 4‚Äì1 with a minute left when Runcorn goalkeeper Arthur Williams allowed his shot to slip through his fingers. There was a wonderful gesture as injured captain Glyn Creaser went up to collect the trophy. Wycombe Wanderers had achieved a glorious non- league double and there were more great scenes of celebration in the town the following day as the team enjoyed an open-top bus parade. One potential cloud on the horizon was the interest of Nottingham Forest in manager Martin O'Neill. The crowd chanted \\"Don't go Martin, don't go.\\" The following day he travelled to Nottingham. Wycombe Chairman Ivor Beeks countered the offer with a new contract, with a significant salary increase and on the Wednesday morning a press conference at Adams Park informed an overjoyed town that Martin O'Neill was staying. The Irishman explained that the reaction he'd received from the Wycombe crowd had swayed him and that he still had this \\"nonsensical dream\\" of taking the club up to the Premier League.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 85. . As he did the previous summer, O'Neill kept faith in his squad. Just three of his players, Glyn Creaser, Mark West and Steve Thompson remained part-time as the club full-time for the first time in its history. The Football League imposed very stringent financial conditions on the club, after experiences with Maidstone United and Barnet The fixture list was also rather unhelpful, as the opening fixture of the 1993‚Äì94 season would be away at Carlisle United. However, more than 1,500 Chairboys and girls made the long journey and were part of a 7,752 crowd that witnessed history in the making. The newcomers endured a torrid opening 20 minutes, Rod Thomas giving the Cumbrians the lead. However, the Wanderers soon found their feet and equalised three minutes before half-time. The first Football League goal in the club's history was an own-goal scored by Chris Curran: with 18 minutes Steve Guppy became the first Wycombe player to score in the Football League when he turned the ball home at the far post; however, Curran made up for his error ten minutes later by firing home an equaliser and the game finished 2‚Äì2. A Keith Scott goal gave the Blues their first ever victory in the Football League, a 1‚Äì0 win over Chester City at Adams Park. The league newcomers made a great start, remaining unbeaten in their first eight league matches. After beating Leyton Orient 3‚Äì0 on aggregate in the first round of the Football League Cup the team came agonisingly close to knocking out Premier League Coventry City in the second round. A 3‚Äì0 first leg deficit was overturned and a Jason Cousins free-kick gave the Wanderers a 4‚Äì0 lead early in extra time. Goals from Steve Morgan and a deflected Phil Babb effort saw the Sky Blues through 5‚Äì4 on aggregate. In the FA Cup the team again beat two sides from the league above, winning 2‚Äì1 at Bristol Rovers and 1‚Äì0 at home to Cambridge United. The tie at Twerton Park would be striker Keith Scott's last game, he signed for Premier League Swindon Town for an eventual fee of ¬£375,000. His replacement was Tony Hemmings, signed earlier in the season from Northwich Victoria and he made an immediate impact, scoring twice in a 3‚Äì1 home win over promotion rivals Crewe Alexandra. The following weekend the club travelled up to another promotion rival, Preston North End. Their Deepdale ground still had a plastic pitch and they were managed by John Beck. Two goals from Tim Langford were cancelled out but a last minute strike from Hakan Hayrettin, his only goal for Wycombe, from just inside the Preston half stunned the home crowd and sent the visiting fans in delirium. Premier League Norwich City ended interest in the FA Cup, winning the third round tie at Adams Park 2‚Äì0. There was still another cup run to be had in the Associate Members Cup. The Southern Area Quarter-Final at Craven Cottage saw 2,500 Wycombe fans make the short trip into the capital to see Tim Langford notch a brace in a 2‚Äì2 draw. The game went to penalties and Jason Cousins tucked home the winning spot-kick to spark more celebrations. The game marked the debut of striker Simon Garner, who soon become a cult hero at Adams Park. Victory did come at a cost, centre- back Terry Evans was injured and missed the rest of the season. A tricky run in February ended with a fortunate last minute winner from Langford at Gillingham and March saw the side push on for automatic promotion. A 2‚Äì0 win at Layer Road against rivals Colchester United was particularly sweet, with defender David Titterton scoring his one and only Wycombe goal. O'Neill strengthened the squad with the signing of midfielder Steve Brown from Northampton Town for ¬£60,000 and Nicky Reid, a free transfer from West Bromwich Albion. A 3‚Äì2 aggregate defeat in the Southern area final of the Associate Members Cup denied the Blues a trip to Wembley but everyone hoped a Wembley visit wouldn't be needed with automatic promotion still a realistic target. It came down a crunch game with Crewe Alexandra at Gresty Road. Ashley Ward gave the railwaymen a first-minute lead but a bizarre own goal from Darren Rowbotham soon pulled the Wanderers level. However, Ward snatched a winner 14 minutes from time and they jumped above the Blues into the automatic promotion places. A 1‚Äì1 draw with Preston North End on the final day of the season wasn't enough and the club had to settle for the play-offs. Martin O'Neill knew the disappointment would be huge but fortunately a trip Wembley Arena for the London Standard 5-a-sides provided the perfect tonic, as perennial substitute goalkeeper Chuck Moussadik performed heroics and was voted man of the tournament as Wimbledon were beaten on sudden death penalties in the final. The semi-final saw the Wanderers travel up to in-form Carlisle United for the first leg and put in one of their best performances of the season. Steve Thompson gave the visitors a priceless lead on the half hour and with five minutes to go Simon Garner raced away to seal a 2‚Äì0 win. Within seven minutes of the second leg at Adams Park Dave Carroll had headed home and another trip to Wembley was confirmed when Simon Garner slid the ball past Tony Caig early in the second half. The Cumbrians grabbed a consolation from the penalty spot with Wycombe winning 4‚Äì1 on aggregate. The final at Wembley was against Preston North End and almost 20,000 Wycombe fans made the journey to the home of football. Goalkeeper Paul Hyde played despite having been sick all week, and Wycombe dominated the first half, but despite Steve Thompson equalising immediately after Ian Bryson had given North End the lead, they took a 2‚Äì1 advantage into the break through Paul Raynor. Within two minutes of the restart Simon Garner showed great control taking a long pass from David Titterton before firing unerringly past Woods. Ten minutes later an immaculate one-touch four-man passing move cut the Preston defence asunder and Dave Carroll passed the ball into the back of the net to give Wanderers the lead for the first time. A 4‚Äì2 win was sealed with 17 minutes to go when Carroll went on a trademark jinking run before cutting back on the edge of the area and smashing in a shot off the post. It still ranks as arguably the greatest ever Wycombe Wanderers performance and Martin O'Neill had led his team to another promotion, for the second year running. The 1994‚Äì95 season hadn't even began when the club was hit with a blow. Hugely influential winger Steve Guppy turned down a new contract and when Newcastle United made a take-it-or- leave-it offer of ¬£150,000, Martin O'Neill reluctantly accepted the offer. Again the manager made few changes, the only one being the arrival of legendary striker Cyrille Regis. The season started in incredible fashion, Cambridge United were comfortably beaten 3‚Äì0 on the opening day, Simon Garner scoring within two minutes. Garner did it again the following week, scoring the winner in a 1‚Äì0 win at Huddersfield Town, on the inauguration of their new stadium. Wycombe fans had to pinch themselves when the side even went to St. Andrews, home of Birmingham City and came away with a 1‚Äì0 win, courtesy of a header from Cyrille Regis. Revenge was sweet at Gresty Road where a Dave Carroll free-kick helped the Blues to a 2‚Äì1 win over Crewe Alexandra. Simon Garner notched a hat-trick in a 5‚Äì0 FA Cup second round tie at Hitchin Town, but the run came to end at the hands of Premier League West Ham United in the third round, the Hammers winning 2‚Äì0 at Adams Park. O'Neill began to seriously strengthen the squad at the beginning of 1995. Mickey Bell signed from Northampton Town for ¬£45,000, Gary Patterson joined from Shrewsbury Town for ¬£70,000, Terry Howard joined on a free from Leyton Orient, Miquel Desouza cost ¬£80,000 from Birmingham City and a then club record fee of ¬£140,000 was paid for Steve McGavin, also from Birmingham. Desouza made an immediate impact, scoring twice on his debut in a 2‚Äì0 win at Chester City and scoring six goals in his first six appearances. Unfortunately disaster struck as he suffered an injury in training and he only returned on the last day of the season. The goals dried up and a run of eight games without a win saw the side slip out of the play-off chase. A late recovery raised hopes but a 2‚Äì1 defeat at home to relegation-bound Plymouth Argyle condemned the side to a sixth-place finish. That would normally have been sufficient for a play-off berth but reorganisation of the league meant there was only one automatic promotion spot and the Blues missed out by just three points. If that was disappointing, Wycombe fans were soon be dismayed when the news they'd been dreading finally happened. Martin O'Neill was leaving Wycombe Wanderers. Like Kelman before him, O'Neill's relationship with the board was deteriorating and when Norwich City wanted to speak to him, he felt as if the club was trying to get rid of him. O'Neill met with Canaries Chairman Robert Chase at Heathrow and accepted the job at Carrow Road.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 91. . It was a sad end to a wonderful five and half years at the club. It was a magical time for players and supporters alike. Despite more than 60 applications for the vacancy, only one man was interviewed for the job, Alan Smith. He had just left Crystal Palace and was an old acquaintance of Brian Lee. He was a popular choice and was unanimously accepted by the board.Finch, D & Peart, S. (1996). Wycombe Wanderers 1887‚Äì1996 The Official History. Yore Publications. Page 92. . Smith made one addition to the squad during the summer, left-back Paul Hardyman from Bristol Rovers but after a slow start to the season he signed Jason Rowbotham, David Farrell from Aston Villa for ¬£100,000 and striker John Williams from Coventry City for ¬£150,000, another record fee. The team went 14 league games without defeat during the Autumn, but things started to unravel in November. An Associate Members Cup tie at Walsall saw the team 4‚Äì0 down at half-time and Smith proceeded to conduct his half-time team talk in the centre-circle. A desperate 1‚Äì0 defeat by Gillingham in an FA Cup first round replay followed and after a 4‚Äì2 league defeat at Carlisle United, popular goalkeeper Paul Hyde fell out with the manager and never played for the team again. Smith relied on loanees, Ben Roberts from Middlesbrough and Sieb Dykstra from Queens Park Rangers to keep goal for the rest of the season. It soon become a disappointing campaign, inconsistent results and a change in the style of football saw crowds steadily fall. Miquel Desouza created history, scoring a hat-trick both home and away against Bradford City and Dave Carroll scored a sensational solo goal in a 4‚Äì1 thrashing of Stockport County but a play-off challenge never materialised and the team finished in 12th place. A crowd of 2,836 for a midweek home fixture with Rotherham United remains the club's lowest ever Football League attendance. The summer of 1996 was one of change. Out went the likes of Simon Garner, Steve Thompson, Simon Stapleton, Tony Hemmings and Terry Howard. In came two goalkeepers, Brian Parkin and John Cheesewright and centre-back Paul McCarthy, a ¬£100,000 capture from Brighton & Hove Albion. The season started in bizarre fashion, in more than one sense. The club had to play its opening game of the season away at Shrewsbury Town on a Sunday due to the town's flower show and the team wore a new pin-striped change shirt, which was christened with a stunning equaliser from Steve Brown to earn a 1‚Äì1 draw. Alan Smith always had a tough act to follow in O'Neill and after falling-out with popular players, playing a role in the changing of the quartered kit to stripes and disappointing performances he had to get results. But he didn't, and after a start of eight league games without a win, the ninth game, a 6‚Äì3 defeat by Peterborough United was the final straw and he was sacked. Caretaker boss Neil Smillie helped guide the team to two important wins, over Rotherham United and Notts County but a series of defeats followed which left the side languishing at the bottom of the table. It was something of a surprise when John Gregory, a coach at Aston Villa, was appointed the new boss. He slowly started to turn things around, and the team started winning regularly at home. A first round FA Cup tie with rivals Colchester United at Layer Road added some excitement and goals from Miquel Desouza and one from a suspiciously offside looking John Williams gave the Wanderers a very sweet 2‚Äì1 victory. Gregory realised the need to strengthen the squad and brought in midfielder Michael Simpson from Notts County for ¬£50,000, Michael Forsyth and Jason Kavanagh from Derby County, for ¬£25,000 each, striker Mark Stallard from Bradford City for ¬£100,000 and striker Paul Read from Arsenal, also for ¬£100,000. A first away win of the season was gained with an exciting 4‚Äì3 victory at Bristol Rovers just before Christmas. The team won eight of its last ten home games, remaining unbeaten at Adams Park. However, away wins proved elusive and the battle to avoid relegation went right to the wire. A pivotal result was secured at home to relegation rivals Shrewsbury Town, and it featured two loanees, goalkeeper Martin Taylor from Derby County and returning striker Keith Scott from Norwich City, making his second debut for the club. Taylor made a number of crucial saves and Scott gave the Wanderers the lead and went to win 3‚Äì0. A second away win came at Notts County, A long- range opportunist strike from Steve Brown was cancelled out, but a winner from Steve McGavin gave the Blues a 2‚Äì1 win and condemned County to the drop. It was a great escape and Wycombe had won its first battle against relegation in the Football League. Martin Taylor, on a free transfer, and Keith Scott, for ¬£55,000, both signed permanently in the close season and the club reverted to the popular quartered shirt for the 1997‚Äì98 campaign. They were defeated 5‚Äì2 by newly promoted Wigan Athletic at Springfield Park. However, after a 4‚Äì1 home win over Southend United in early September the side reached third place. It wouldn't last as a similar pattern to the previous season emerged. The team was very reliable at Adams Park, losing just three league games there all season. But there were just four away wins as the side struggled on its travels and finished in 14th place. There was bitter disappointment in the FA Cup as the club were the victims of a giant-killing for the first time as a Football League club. Basingstoke Town came from 2‚Äì0 draw to gain a 2‚Äì2 draw at Adams Park before a similar result in the replay at the Camrose Ground. Keith Scott saw his decisive spot-kick saved and the non-leaguers won 5‚Äì4 on penalties. The biggest shock came in February 1998 when manager John Gregory was chosen to as the unlikely successor to Brian Little at his former club Aston Villa. Youth team boss Neil Smillie again took caretaker control and after losing just two of 12 games in charge he was given the job on a permanent basis. The start of the 1998‚Äì99 season was a baptism of fire for Smillie and his team, going 12 league games without a win at the start of the campaign. A 3‚Äì0 win over Macclesfield Town was followed by a win over Wrexham by the same scoreline and a sense of optimism returned after Manchester City were beaten 1‚Äì0 at Adams Park. One of the players who helped lift the team was young striker Andy Baird, a product of the youth team. Smillie had also strengthened the team bringing in Chris Vinnicombe from Burnley on a free transfer, Dannie Bulman from Ashford Town (Middx) for ¬£10,000, Paul Emblen from Charlton Athletic for ¬£60,000, Matt Lawrence from Fulham for ¬£86,000 and hot prospect Jermaine McSporran from Oxford City for ¬£75,000. The team went into the new year looking to escape the bottom four but after a run of six games without a win Smillie was sacked. Terry Evans took caretaker charge for almost a month until Lawrie Sanchez was appointed in February 1999. His first game in charge was a creditable 1‚Äì1 draw at home to Kevin Keegan's high flying Fulham Steve McGavin left the club for personal reasons before Sanchez was appointed and the new boss was told he had to make ¬£200,000 from transfers before the end of the season. His first signing was Canadian defender Mark Rogers, who paid his own air fare to England to pursue his dream of playing professional football. By March Jason Kavanagh and Nicky Mohan had departed for Stoke City whilst Notts County paid ¬£20,000 for Mark Stallard. Striker Sean Devine was brought in on loan from Barnet but there was stunning news to follow when Keith Scott signed for local rivals Reading for ¬£250,000. Scott departed on the same evening that Wanderers travelled to Bristol Rovers, five points adrift at the bottom of the table and eight points from safety. A brave header from Jason Cousins gave the visitors the lead, one which saw Cousins miss the rest of the season and a Sean Devine shot from the edge of the area in the second half brought an unlikely victory. It proved to be a catalyst as the side lost just 2 of its last 11 league games. The highlight was a 2‚Äì1 win away at Manchester City, where first half goals from Baird and Devine sealed a magnificent double against the fallen giants. Devine was signed permanently for a club record ¬£200,000. The penultimate game of the season was at home to promotion chasing Wigan Athletic, who went a goal up in the first half but soon pegged back by some sharper shooting from Devine. Early in the second half Paul Emblen deflected in the winning goal to set up a tense final day away at Lincoln City. The club paid for 30-odd supporters coaches and 2,643 Wanderers made the journey to Sincil Bank. A tense game saw Baird miss a golden early chance and when Michael Forsyth hit the post it looked like it really was mission impossible. However, with just seven minutes of the season remaining Devine crossed for Emblen a header over Vaughan and into the top corner of the net. It was an incredible finale to amazing escape from a relegation that seemed a certainty for much of the season. It brought the new manager much praise, but he was to go on to even greater things. Wycombe Comanche Wycombe Comanche in the WWFC Strip A wooden statue of a Native American 'Comanche' was spotted by the team as they passed a second hand shop on the way to Sincil Bank, Lincoln City for the last game of the season and decided that if they win and subsequently survive relegation they would purchase him as a lucky charm and he would become the club's mascot. The Wycombe Comanche was purchased and painted in Wycombe colours. He remained at the club throughout the Sanchez reign and he even featured in the centre of the squad photo in the 1999‚Äì2000 season. He was put on the centre circle before home matches at Adams Park. It is now believed to reside somewhere in Scotland. After the excitement of \\"mission impossible\\" the 1999‚Äì2000 season was a quiet affair. There was an enjoyable, if short-lived, run in the Football League Cup which saw a Jermaine McSporran inspired 4‚Äì2 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux in the second leg after a 1‚Äì0 defeat in the first leg. Their Black Country neighbours West Bromwich Albion were the opponents in the second round and after a 1‚Äì1 draw in the first leg at the Hawthorns, the Baggies won an exciting second leg 4‚Äì3 after extra time, the highlight being a wonderful goal from Dave Carroll. There was no flirtation with relegation as the team remained mid-table during the season, finishing 12th. Highlights included a 5‚Äì3 win over local rivals Reading, a 3‚Äì0 thrashing of enemies Colchester United and a 3‚Äì1 win at Wrexham which saw young full- back Danny Senda score his first goal for the Blues and another fabulous free- kick from Dave Carroll. There was almost an ignominious exit in the FA Cup where non-league Oxford City looked to have earned a penalty shoot-out when a fire underneath the away stand meant the game had to be abandoned. The replay was replayed at Oxford United's Manor Ground with the Wanderers sneaking a 1‚Äì0 win. Matt Lawrence made a ¬£250,000 move to Millwall just before transfer deadline day and Roger Johnson became the youngest ever Wycombe player to play in the Football League at 17 years and 8 days in the final game of the season. There was a blow at the start of the 2000‚Äì01 season when Sean Devine was ruled out with a serious knee injury, one that would keep him out for the whole of the campaign. There was an encouraging start to the league, with a 2‚Äì1 win away at Millwall, a 3‚Äì1 win over local rivals Oxford United at Adams Park and a 3‚Äì1 win against league leaders Walsall Andy Rammell score a brace in the win, who the Wanderers had just signed from the Saddlers for ¬£75,000. There was more bad news with injuries to Paul Emblen, Andy Baird and Jermaine McSporran and Sanchez, short of strikers, had to rely on the loan market, bringing in Steve Jones, Sam Parkin and triallist Niall Thompson. In November an embryonic FA Cup run began with a 3‚Äì0 win over Harrow Borough but the second round saw the Blues face a tough trip to promotion favourites Millwall The tie was played on a Sunday and a patched-up team managed to somehow scrape a goalless draw. In the replay goals from Thompson and McCarthy sealed a very satisfying 2‚Äì1 win but in the third round they were paired with an unglamorous but difficult tie at home to Grimsby Town. McCarthy equalised to take it a replay and on a freezing cold January evening in Cleethorpes history was made. It was a night of personal triumph for young midfielder Martyn Lee. On the half hour he whipped in a free-kick and McCarthy flicked the ball past the keeper. Two minutes another Lee free-kick was only cleared to the edge of the area and Michael Simpson volleyed home. Grimsby pulled a goal back just before half-time but with almost an hour on the clock Mark Rogers headed home a Lee corner to make it 3‚Äì1. Wycombe Wanderers were in the fourth round for the first time in the club's history. They were drawn at home to the other WWFC, Wolverhampton Wanderers. A 9,617 sell-out watched Andy Rammell poke home ten minutes before half-time and celebrated by diving into the snow. Wolves snatched a deserved equaliser early in the second half but with five minutes to go a deep cross from Steve Brown was headed emphatically into the corner of the net by Sam Parkin to make it 2‚Äì1 and spark more scenes of celebration. Wycombe faced a seemingly fateful fifth round encounter with Lawrie Sanchez's former club Wimbledon and after the Wombles had taken a 2‚Äì0 first half lead, a deflected Michael Simpson and a suspiciously offside looking equaliser from Steve Brown took the tie to a replay at Selhurst Park. 4,551 Wycombe fans made the journey to South London and Gareth Ainsworth soon gave the Dons the lead. Halfway through the first half Dave Carroll fired in an equaliser after Rammell's shot was blocked. Andy Rammell was then replaced by Andy Baird after suffering a recurrence of a groin injury and Baird lasted less than five minutes after a shocking challenge from Dons defender Mark Williams. Baird had to be carried off and he was replaced by Parkin. The second half was tight affair but the home side gained a numerical advantage when Michael Simpson was sent off for a second bookable offence. In the last minute Paul McCarthy was adjudged to have handled the ball but goalkeeper Martin Taylor pulled off a fine save to deny Neal Ardley from the spot. However, in the first minute of extra time Wayne Gray fired home to give Wimbledon a 2‚Äì1 lead. There seemed no way back for the Wanderers as the clock ticked into the 120th minute but Bulman's sliced shot from the edge fell perfectly for McCarthy to poke the ball past Kelvin Davis to make it 2‚Äì2. Penalties it was and it went to sudden death. It looked all over again when Jamie Bates' penalty was saved by Davis but Taylor then saved from Peter Hawkins. The goalkeeper then scored himself and when Mark Williams smashed his kick high over the bar, the celebrations could begin, the Wanderers winning 8‚Äì7. The Chairboys had reached the giddy heights of the Quarter-finals and were rewarded with a trip to Filbert Street to take on Leicester City, flying high in fourth place in the Premier League. The club had been unable to do a deal to sign Parkin permanently from Chelsea and sent out an SOS for a striker which was even advertised on teletext. Northern Irish front man Roy Essandoh answered the call and made his debut in 1‚Äì0 defeat at home to Port Vale. A week later 3,202 Chairboys and girls made the journey up to Leicestershire and saw Manchester United loanee George Clegg and Wanderers legend Keith Ryan lead the attack against the Foxes. After a goalless first half Paul McCarthy scored his fifth FA Cup goal, diving in to head home Steve Brown's free-kick from close range. The dream appeared to have been dashed when Muzzy Izzet finished off a fine move to equalise twenty minutes later but the underdogs brushed off that disappointment and after Robbie Savage had to be substituted through injury and Essandoh replaced Ryan they seized the initiative in the final ten minutes and looked to have a good penalty shout turned down after Stefan Oakes appeared to handle in the area. Lawrie Sanchez was incensed and walked out of his technical area and down the touchline to remonstrate with the linesman. As the game went into injury-time Bulman swung in a cross to far post where Bates headed the ball back for Essandoh to leap like the proverbial salmon and head powerfully past Royce into the top corner. It was a sensational moment and although referee Steve Bennett played the role of spoilsport by showing Steve Brown a second yellow card for removing his shirt in celebration, there was little time for Leicester to come back and he blew the final whistle to confirm one of the biggest shocks in the competition's history. It sparked wild scenes of elation and disbelief as Wycombe Wanderers, a Football League club for less than eight years, were through to the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The epic journey took the Blues to Villa Park to face the mighty Liverpool. 19,403 supporters travelled to Birmingham for one of the proudest moments in the club's history. It was a day to be cherished, with both tears of joy and sadness shed. A determined and well organised defence stood up to an International renowned attack boasting the likes of Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler, Nick Barmby, Gary McAllister, Steven Gerrard and Emile Heskey. They were just 12 minutes left when Gerrard's cross was headed home by Heskey. Four minutes later a Robbie Fowler free-kick made it two and the Reds looked home and dry. However, with just three minutes left Keith Ryan chipped the ball over Sander Westerveld and into the net to make it 2‚Äì1. The Cup run had seen the team's league form falter and were left precariously close to a relegation battle with a back log of fixtures. An Easter Monday fixture at Bristol City was crucial and Wycombe came from a goal down to win 2‚Äì1 thanks to a last minute winner from Guy Whittingham. Safety was assured on the penultimate Saturday of the season when Dave Carroll scored his 100th goal for Wycombe in a 1‚Äì1 draw at Bury The 2001‚Äì02 season began with great expectations of a concerted push for promotion and Sanchez used some of the ¬£1million made from the Cup run to strengthen the side. Midfielder Darren Currie joined from Barnet for ¬£200,000 and enjoyed a great first season at Adams Park. ¬£200,000 bids for strikers Jamie Forrester and Chris Greenacre were unsuccessful and Gavin Holligan was signed on a free transfer from West Ham United. There was similar failed attempts to sign centre-backs Shaun Maher, Martin McIntosh and Marlon Broomes to replace Jamie Bates who retired in the summer. The season started well and the sides lost just three of the first 19 league matches. Striker Richard Walker was signed on loan from Aston Villa and in October winger Stuart Roberts signed from Swansea City for ¬£102,500 and made his debut in a 2‚Äì2 away at rivals Colchester United. There was another run in the FA Cup, although a shock was only avoided in the first round as the team came from behind to win 4‚Äì3 away at Hayes The club was given a home tie with Premier League Fulham in the third round and after coming from a goal down, Jermaine McSporran gave the Blues a 2‚Äì1 lead and only an injury-time equaliser by Steve Marlet prevented another giant-killing. The replay at Craven Cottage was won by a single Barry Hayles goal. The winter saw the start of a downward spiral for the club as those in power made a series of bad decisions. Simon Monkman was appointed as the club's first Chief Executive and one of his first tasks was to secure Rugby Union side London Wasps as tenants. There was a solitary appearance of defender Carlos Lopez in a 2‚Äì0 at Cambridge United which has now become legendary and the club brought a new scoreboard which suffered a number of technical failures before being removed. Results on the pitch deteriorated with the team winning just three of its last 14 league games to finish 11th. Sanchez decided that the poor results were a consequence of an aging team and began major surgery on the squad. Paul Emblen, Dave Carroll, Jason Cousins, Stewart Castledine and Andy Baird were all released and replaced by Richard Harris, Andy Thomson, Frank Talia and Craig Faulconbridge. In August Chairman Ivor Beeks decided to offer the manager a lucrative new three-year contract, partly designed to ward off suitors. The 2002‚Äì03 season was one of struggle, winning just two of the opening ten league games. Chief Executive Simon Monkman resigned in September and it was later revealed by Chairman Ivor Beeks that the club \\"would have been bust by Christmas\\" and revealed over spending to the tune of ¬£100,000 during the first quarter of the season. As the season stumbled into the winter months the manager endured a strained relationship with supporters, with a number of verbal battles conducted through local media. Sanchez incurred more wrath when he sold Sean Devine to Exeter City for ¬£50,000 and during an away game at Cheltenham Town, banners demanded the removal of the manager were displayed. One defeat in eight matches just after Christmas brought the boss time but a dreadful 4‚Äì0 defeat by Chesterfield at Saltergate saw the under pressure gaffer bring his players over to the away fans and a heated debate ensued. Two further four goal defeats followed and the side failed to win any of its last eight games, escaping relegation by just four points, finishing 18th. The summer of 2003 was one of discontent and Sanchez made more changes, out went Paul McCarthy, Martyn Lee and Martin Taylor. In came Charlie Mapes, Steve Dell and a series of loan strikers. However, there was huge controversy when the board sold the naming rights of the stadium to a local technology company for ¬£100,000 over three years. The ground was named in honour of former player and administrator Frank Adams, who had gifted the club's former home Loakes Park in trust back in 1947. The decision was seen as an insult to his memory and showed a distinct lack of appreciation. Things were no better on the pitch and after a run of just one win in the opening nine league matches, Lawrie Sanchez was sacked. Bizarrely he was allowed to continue for two more matches before being replaced by John Gorman on a caretaker basis. Sanchez's successor was former Arsenal and England defender Tony Adams but he was unable to save Wycombe's season and they were relegated in 2004, joining Football League Two for its first season under that name. =The postmodern era (2004‚Äìpresent)= Dover Athletic in 2009 The modern era began with fundamental changes off the pitch. A new company, Limited by Guarantee, was officially formed in April 1980 and it was activated in June 1986 when a new board of directors was formed. The constitution meant Wycombe Wanderers was English football's last members' club. Fans who held season tickets for three years paid ¬£1 for the right to become one of a maximum of 500 members with control over the club, who elect the directors who retire by rotation. No major changes to the club's constitution could be made unless 75% per cent of the members agreed. There were attempts to change parts of the constitution in 1995 and 1998 but these were rejected by members. In August 2003 the club revealed that they had agreed a wage deferral scheme for both players and club staff. In January 2004 members were invited to attend a series of meetings under the heading of 'Building for the future', with the intention of raising ¬£1.5m in new investment. In July 2004 members received the final proposals for conversion to what was revealed for the first time as a Public Limited Company. Members interests and the long-term future of the Club are claimed to be protected by a number of special rights attached to what would be called 'Founder Shares'. The target for new investment was halved to ¬£750,000. However, several concerns and questions remained unanswered but Board members said they didn't want further debate and the vote went ahead at an Extraordinary General Meeting on Thursday 29 July 2004. The members vote by a narrow margin to give formal approval for the reconstruction of the Club. 430 of the 498 members voted, with 335 (78%) in favour and 94 (22%) against and one paper spoilt. Chairman Ivor Beeks, Director Brian Kane and sponsor Steve Hayes all subsequently invested in the club, with an approx. total value of ¬£750,000. On the pitch the club's first season in League Two saw a change of manager as Tony Adams resigned and John Gorman took charge of the club after a brief spell as caretaker manager the previous season. Wycombe finished the season in 10th place. In April 2005 Steve Hayes became Managing Director of Wycombe Wanderers. A 21-match unbeaten start to the 2005‚Äì06 campaign saw them lead the division for a considerable amount of time. During the second half of the season, the club was rocked by two setbacks. On 14 January 2006, whilst a match against Notts County was in progress, 21-year-old midfielder Mark Philo, who had made 19 appearances for the club, died in hospital after a car crash the previous night. His manager, John Gorman, paid tribute to him by saying, \\"He was a fantastic kid. He lived for football and always had a smile on his face\\". It was later revealed that Philo had been significantly over the drink- drive limit and veered onto the opposite side of the road, killing a 58-year- old mother of two. Just a few weeks later, Gorman's wife Myra died after a long illness, leading to him taking a period of compassionate leave away from the club. Around this time Wycombe went on a six-match losing run, seeing them drop out of the automatic promotion challenge, finishing in 6th. They were eventually defeated 2‚Äì1 on aggregate by Cheltenham Town in the play-off semi- finals. It was later announced that Gorman had been relieved of his duties as the club's manager as the Wycombe board did not believe that he was in the right condition to manage the club (he then took up the vacant position at Northampton Town a few days later). After a five-week search, the club announced that the former Celtic captain Paul Lambert was to be the new manager having ended a managerial spell at Livingston that season. The 2006‚Äì07 season began well with Wanderers winning 11 of their first 22 games and progressing into the Semi-Finals of the Football League Cup beating teams including Fulham and Charlton Athletic of the Premier League ‚Äì the first time the club has lasted past the Second Round of the League Cup competition and the first time a team from the bottom tier has reached that stage since Chester City in the 1974‚Äì75 season. This gives Wycombe the distinction of being the only club to make it to at least the semi final of the major Professional and Amateur cups. The team also defeated local rivals Oxford United in the FA Cup, but lost to Stockport County in the second round. On 19 December 2006, they reached the semi-finals of the League Cup after winning away to Charlton Athletic 1‚Äì0, with 4,517 Blues fans making the journey. They were drawn against Chelsea, and heroically held the champions to a 1‚Äì1 draw at Adams Park in the first leg. Unfortunately for the Wanderers, in the return leg on 23 January 2007, Chelsea won 4‚Äì0 at Stamford Bridge to win 5‚Äì1 on aggregate. This feat made Wycombe Wanderers the only Football League side to reach the Semi-Finals of the FA Trophy, the FA Amateur Cup, the Football League Trophy, the Football League Cup and the most prestigious of all, the FA Cup. Whilst undoubtedly a heroic achievement, the cup run, along with injuries to key players, contributed to a falling away of league form. For the second successive season, the club's promotion challenge faltered, and a run of eleven League games without a win (and four straight defeats) at the end of the season meant that Wanderers could only finish in 12th place. The summer saw a considerable rebuilding of the playing squad, and Wycombe started the 2007‚Äì08 season with eleven new signings. Early form was inconsistent as the new players took time to settle ‚Äì progress in the League was steady rather than spectacular, and the club went out of all the Cup competitions at the first hurdle. In addition, the leading goalscorer from the previous season, Jermaine Easter, became unsettled at the club, and was eventually sold to Plymouth Argyle for an initial fee of ¬£210,000. The turning point was a 6‚Äì0 reverse at Stockport County in December. Following this, the club put together a run of four successive League wins, and climbed into the play-off positions on Boxing Day. A more consistent second half of the season saw the play-off position maintained, and Wanderers came up against Stockport County again in the semi-finals at the end of the season. A 1‚Äì1 draw in a tense and physical first leg at Adams Park was followed by a narrow 1‚Äì0 defeat at Edgeley Park to end the club's hopes of promotion for another season. Three days after the play-off defeat, it was announced that Paul Lambert had resigned from his position as manager, stating that \\"the time has come for me to move on\\". At a press conference on 29 May 2008 Peter Taylor was announced as Wycombe's new manager. The 2008/09 season started well for Wycombe, with them embarking on an 18 match unbeaten run in the league, from the start of the season until 6 December when this was ended by Aldershot Town, who beat Wycombe 3‚Äì2. Wycombe's unbeaten home record in the league was ended by Grimsby Town, which saw the 'table toppers' beaten 1‚Äì0 by the strugglers, which was only Grimsby's 3rd win of the campaign so far. On the last day of the season they managed to get promoted, even though they lost and the teams either side of them (before the last match was played) in the league table won. The 4th place team, Bury, had the same amounts of points as Wycombe but 1 less goal difference. Wycombe had a disappointing start to 2009/10 and after picking up just six points from their first 11 games, they parted company with manager Taylor. Wycombe appointed Gary Waddock from Aldershot Town to become the new manager with his first game being a 1‚Äì1 draw against rivals Colchester United. Waddock made major changes to the playing staff in January 2010, but an upturn in results came too late and Wycombe were relegated back to League 2 after a 2‚Äì0 loss against Leyton Orient on 1 May 2010. Wycombe started the 2010‚Äì11 Season very well, remaining undefeated after five league games. Wycombe also remained the only side in League Two who had not lost an away game, an undefeated away run of 8 league games, until they were finally beaten away by Port Vale who beat them 2‚Äì1 in November 2010. At the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season, Wycombe were once again promoted to league one after a final day victory at home against Southend United. They were again relegated in 2012 and then promoted in 2018. The Wycombe Wanderers were promoted to the Championship on 13 July, making it the first time in their history, following their 2-1 win over Oxford United at Wembley.

The District has four rural districts (dehestan): Mir Deh Rural District, Sara Rural District, Tamugheh Rural District, and Torjan Rural District. Seqiz is a Kurdish city on the Zagros mountains in Iran. This city Seqiz was once the Scythian capital.  General information  Seqiz is situated on the banks of the Seqiz river in the north-western part of Iran, south west of the Urmiye lake, on the Zagros mountains. Seqiz was originally found during the first Med empire, and at that time was called Izirta/Izirna. As the city was a Median capital, army bases, temples, and forts were built in the surrounding sites (Zewiye, Qeplantu, Aramait). When Sarken II the Assyrian king concurred Izirta, he ordered the destruction of the city, and consequently when rebuilt by the Scythians, Seqiz was renamed to Seka, later to Sakiz, and the final deformation of the name became Seqiz. Historically religious importance of Seqiz is evident given that two important Mannai, and Sassanid temples are located in the proximity. The latter was particularly prominent, as it is believed that the Sassanid kings were traveling to this temple by foot once a year. Various forms of folklore tales, and songs, further add that natives of this region were generally Zoroastrians. Not long time ago, the \\"modern\\" Seqiz was reconstructed on two major hills separated by Weli Xan river. This divides the city into two major parts, Naw Qela and Serpeche. Naw Qela (The Fort) hosted an ancient fort on a height, indicating that this has been a possible place of ancient rulers. Till very recently the fort was used for public ceremonies, particularly at the new year (Newroz) evenings, fireworks along with traditional games were organized. The geographical position of Seqiz endow particular up to date importance. 200 km from Sine (Sanandaj), 60 km from Bane (Baneh), 33 km from Bokan, and 139 km from Meriwan. These cities are links to four distinctly different kurdish regions, and this fact has given arise to a well balanced influence of cultural nuances. The cultural life in Seqiz is very rich and plays a pivotal role for other kurdish regions. Musically, activities in Seqiz have been of primary importance for development of singers such as Hesen Zirek, Qale Mare, Mezher Xaleqi, Naser Rezazi, and native musicians such as Zeze brothers, Sei Muhammad Safai and Muhammad Nahid.  Geography  Seqiz lies on 36.2¬∞ N 46.3¬∞ E, and its average height is about 1500 meters (4900 feet) above sea level. This make the climate very rough and varying, as it is very hot in summer (up to 40 ¬∞C) and very cold in winter (down to -30 ¬∞C).  Water resources  Chem√Æ Gewre: This river is the largest water resource in the Seqiz area. It originates from the Gerdene√Æ Xan, Sh√™x Shwan, Qulqule, and P√Ær Emran mountains, and spans over major parts of the south-west region of Seqiz country side. It passes Gile Sh√Æn, Qure Derre, M√Ære De, Ch√Æra We√Æs, Belece, Temuxe, Qebexl√ª, El√Æ Awa, Xe√Æber and Kan√Æ Cejn√Æ villages and passing through Pir Wenis grounds, it ends in Bokan dam. Chem√Æ Cexet√ª: Originating from Herm√™ Dol, Kan√Æ Tem√Ærxan, Bestam, Sey Awa, Kan√Æ Tela, Werenan, Kes Nezan, Kan√Æ Sef, Kute Resh, and Tewe Kilan mountains, and after passing through villages such as Agce Goce, Bestam, Digaga, Xushe Dire, Dire Z√Æaret, Tale Cer, Hesen Selaran, Merze, Renge Rejan, Qela Cuxe, and Dire Sileman, this river also ends attached to the Bokan dam. Chem√Æ Xurxure: This river starts form Chil Cheme (at the north west of Xurxure), Dere Hwan, Ez√Æz Awa, Cafir Xan, Dire Wiyan Wishke, T√Ækanlu, Kewe Kan√Æ, M√Æran, Nerg√Æle, √éshaq Awa, Mewlan Awa, and Chem√Æ P√Ær S√Æleman heights.

The temple is partly buried up to the pabhaga and jangha including the doorjambs. It is in a rapid process of decay because people use the empty sanctum as a garbage stake. Cracks are seen in the outer walls of the temple due to the growth of vegetations, which facilitates seepage of rain water into the sanctum. The temple is in a dilapidated condition. The temple was repaired by Orissa State Archaeology department. Threats to the property Water stagnation inside the sanctum, growth of vegetations (pipal trees) in the conjunction of raha and anuratha pagas and the conjunction of kanika and anuratha paga and above the doorjambs of the eastern wall are cause of concern.

He is best known for his work in the Pop-Punk group The Leftovers and his own band The Kurt Baker Band which later went on to be called The Kurt Baker Combo. Overview Baker has released several solo projects with his Power Pop group The Kurt Baker Band, which plays punk rock music inspired by pop music of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. Baker was the founding member, bass player, singer, & songwriter of the notable pop/punk outfit The Leftovers, which formed in 2002 and released several records on Rally Records, Insubordination Records and Oglio Records. The group toured extensively and played London, England's celebrated Roundhouse Theater before disbanding in 2010. Baker‚Äôs blend of Beach Boys and Beatles-styled melodies has earned him the praise of Larry Livermore (founder of Lookout Records), Ben Weasel (Screeching Weasel) and Jaret Reddick (Bowling For Soup). After the release of The Leftovers' last album, 2009's Eager to Please on Oglio Records, which featured guests ranging from Brett Anderson (The Donnas)) to Coz Canler (The Romantics), and an extensive tour of the US and Europe, Baker decided to focus on going solo.

Produced by Los Angeles based pop producer, Linus of Hollywood, Got It Covered features Baker‚Äôs take on some of his favorite Power Pop songs of the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs and features guests Kay Hanley (Letters To Cleo) and Adam Marcello (Katy Perry). Baker also has worked with Tommy Dunbar (the Rubinoos), Kim Shattuck (the Muffs), and Parry Gripp (Nerf Herder). Baker's second solo effort and first post-Leftovers record to feature new original songs, Rockin‚Äô For A Living, was released in October 2011 and was named the Number #1 (Power Pop) record of the year by writers (David Bash) founder of the (International Pop Overthrow) festival and music critic/author (John M. Borack) in (Goldmine Magazine). Said Borack, who ranked Baker's record far above that of long-time influence Nick Lowe, \\"Baker and his band barrel their way through a deliriously catchy group of stellar original tunes (‚ÄúJust Forget About It‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Steal My Heart Away‚Äù in particular deserve induction in that mythical Power Pop Hall of Fame) that owe big ‚Äòol debts to early Elvis Costello and the aforementioned Rubinoos. Hooks, energy and panache to spare ‚Äì what‚Äôs not to love?\\" The Kurt Baker Band toured across Europe playing sold out shows in Spain and Italy in support of Rockin' For A Living and enlisted Adam Cargin who drummed on albums by Screeching Weasel and the Riverdales. In 2012, Baker released the EP titled Want You Around on Jolly Ronnie Records. It featured guest appearances by Dan Vapid and Rev. N√∏rb. Following the release of Want You Around, and tours of the Midwest and East Coast (supporting acts such as Tommy Stinson and The Offspring, Kurt and the gang prepared to release the follow up to Rockin‚Äô for a Living, an ambitious 10-song LP titled Brand New Beat. It was recorded and produced by Wyatt Funderburk, and was released on Geoff Palmer (The Connection) and Kurt‚Äôs new independent label (Collector‚Äôs Club Records) on Oct. 30th 2012.

The enshrining deity in this temple, Uttareswara Siva (Hiranyagarbha type) is only a circular yoni pitha at the centre of sanctum. Apart from that, there are statues of Bhairava and Bhairavi on both sides of the entrance to the Garbha Gruha. Another attraction of the temple is the statue of Lord Nrusingha, which is located inside the main temple, facing Lord Uttareswara at the right side of the entrance to the main temple. The original temple has collapsed, as is evident from the renovation work above the pabhaga and the presence of cult images of an earlier phase on different parts of the temple walls, which do not conform to canonical prescriptions. It is the main temple within the precincts along with nine lesser shrines. There are a few more temples, and a pond, the Godavari, is also located inside the precincts. The second biggest temple is Lord Bhimeswara. The Siva linga with a circular yoni pitha is at the centre of the sanctum. Another deity of major importance in this temple is Ma Uttarayani. She is the Parshwa Devi of Lord Uttareswara facing the south on the outer wall of Uttareswara main temple. She is known as one of the Ashta Chandi-s of Lord Lingaraj. (The Ashta Chandi-s of Lingaraj are: Bindhya Bashini at Tala Bazar; Mohini at the southern part of Bindusagar; Ramayani or Rabani at Pujapanda Sahi on Ratha Road; Kapali of Tinimundia/Vaital Temple; Uttarayani; Gouri of Kedar-Gouri Temple; Ambika near Kotitirtheswara Temple and Dwara Vasini on Bindusagar Road). During the month of Chaitra an offering of Pana to Uttarayani is famous at this temple.  Tradition & legends  According to the local tradition, this temple is so named as it is located in the northern embankment of Bindusagar and north of Lingaraj temple. The temple is one of the four pithas; the other pithas are Yoga pitha at Kharakhia Baidyanath, Bhoga pitha at Lingaraj and Siddha Pitha at KedaraGouri temple. Similarly Uttareswara was known as Tantra pitha.  Architecture  Architectural features like pabhaga mouldings, rectangular flat roofed jagamohana and sculptures with 7th century iconographic traits reveals that it was established on 7th century A.D. but later construction might be on 19th century. It is a temple type building with Vimana and jaga mohan. Vimana is Rekha Deula whereas jagmohana is a rectangular flat roofed hall. The temple is surrounded by the lesser shrines of Bhimesvar in north Sahadevesvara in south and the compound wall on the eastern and western sides. Kartikeya standing in a tribhanga pose is holding a spear(sula) in his left hand and the right hand rests over his thigh. He has jatamukuta, and wears beaded necklace and a female attendant is standing in his lefts. The northern raha niche houses a six armed Mahisamardini. She holds a wheel in lower left, a bow in second lower left and the third left hand rests over the demon Mahisasura. The deity holds a sword in lower right, a spear in the middle and an arrow in the third right hand. Her left leg is resting over the hip of the demon. The body of the demon is a buffalo whereas the face is that of a human. This image of Mahisamardini appears to be a later installation as Mahisamardini is not the parsva devata in a Siva temple. The southern raha niche enshrines the image of a four armed Siddhivinayaka Ganesha. He holds a nagapasa in upper left and parasu in upper right hand, modakapatra in lower left, and a staff in lower right hand. The jagamohana is a plain structural. It has three niches in the southern wall. The temple is devoid of ornamentation, but the pabhaga portion line drawings of chaitya design are noticed. At the lalatabimba there is a four armed Gajalaxmi seated in lalitasana over a lotus pedestal. The architrave above the doorjamb is carved with the traditional Navagrahas(nine planets).  Significance Rituals like Nrusimha Janma (birthday), Durgastami, Kartik Purnima, Shiva ratri, \\"Chaitra Mangalbar\\" are observed. Bhimesvara Siva temple thumb Bhimesvara Siva temple is located within the Uttaresvara Siva temple precinct, in the northern embankment of Bindusagar tank. The enshrining deity of this temple is a Siva lingam within a circular yoni pitha at the centre of the sanctum. This is a living temple facing east. The temple has a square vimana with a modern concrete hall in front of the vimana serves as the jagamohana. Like Uttaresvara Siva temple this temple was also renovated from pabhaga portion. On elevation, the vimana is of rekha order having bada, gandi and mastaka. With threefold divisions of bada the temple has a trianga bada. The parsvadevata niches are located in the jangha portion on three sides. The western raha niche houses a beautiful four armed Kartikeya standing over a lotus pedestal. His lower left hand rests over a cock and lower right hand holding the beak of his mount peacock. He is holding a dambaru in his upper left and a trident in upper right hand. The northern raha niche houses a four armed Parvati standing over a lotus petal. The deity holds lotus in her lower left, akshamala in lower right, a staff in upper left and a nagapasa in upper right arm. The southern niche houses a four armed Ganesha standing over a lotus pedestal. He holds a rosary in lower right, Varadamudra in upper left, lower left hand rests over the parasu whereas upper left hand holds a broken tooth. All the parsva devatas(supplementary deities) in the niches are recent installations. The doorjamb is carved with three plain vertical bands. At the lalatabimba there is a Gajalakshmi seated on a lotus pedestal. The deity holds a lotus in her left arm and right hand is in Varada mudra. Laterite Temple thumb The temple is located within the Uttaresvara Siva temple precinct. It is a dilapidated temple in the Uttaresvara Siva temple precinct. The temple is buried up to the bada portion. The temple as ascertained from the visible portion of the bada has a square pancharatha vimana(five chariot shrine). Godavari Tank Godavari Tank is located inside the precinct of the temple. It is on the northern embankment of Bindusagar tank in Bhubaneswar, Orissa, India. The tank is enclosed by embankments made of dressed laterite blocks. The tank is a natural spring with an outlet channel leading into the Bindusagar. According to local tradition, after killing the demons Kirti and Basa goddess Parvati felt thirsty. In order to quench her thirst, Lord Siva struck his trident on earth where from a spring came out. In order to consecrate the water Siva invited all the river goddesses. Godavari could not come because of her menstrual cycle. On her absence Shiva cursed her that her water will be impure throughout except on the occasion of Kumbhamela when it would be most sacred for divinities and human being.

It is closely related to applied geophysics or exploration geophysics. Methods used include seismic refraction and reflection, gravity, magnetic, electric, and electromagnetic methods. Many of these methods were developed for oil and mineral exploration but are now used for a great variety of applications, including archaeology, environmental science, forensic science, military intelligence, geotechnical investigation, treasure hunting, and hydrogeology. In addition to the practical applications, near-surface geophysics includes the study of biogeochemical cycles. Overview In studies of the solid Earth, the mean feature that distinguishes geophysics from geology is that it involves remote sensing. Various physical phenomena are used to probe below the surface where scientists cannot directly access the rock. Applied geophysics projects typically have the following elements: data acquisition, data reduction, data processing, modeling, and geological interpretation. This all requires various types of geophysical surveys. These may include surveys of gravity, magnetism, seismicity, or magnetotellurics. =Data acquisition= A geophysical survey is a set of measurements made with a geophysical instrument. Often a set of measurements are along a line, or traverse. Many surveys have a set of parallel traverses and another set perpendicular to it to get good spatial coverage. Technologies used for geophysical surveys include: * Seismic methods, such as reflection seismology, seismic refraction, and seismic tomography. * Seismoelectrical method * Geodesy and gravity techniques, including gravimetry and gravity gradiometry. * Magnetic techniques, including aeromagnetic surveys and magnetometers. * Electrical techniques, including electrical resistivity tomography, induced polarization and spontaneous potential. * Electromagnetic methods, such as magnetotellurics, ground penetrating radar and transient/time-domain electromagnetics. * Borehole geophysics, also called well logging. * Remote sensing techniques, including hyperspectral imaging. =Data reduction= The raw data from a geophysical survey must often be converted to a more useful form. This may involve correcting the data for unwanted variations; for example, a gravity survey would be corrected for surface topography. Seismic travel times would be converted to depths. Often a target of the survey will be revealed as an anomaly, a region that has data values above or below the surrounding region. =Data processing= The reduced data may not provide a good enough image because of background noise. The signal-to-noise ratio may be improved by repeated measurements of the same quantity followed by some sort of averaging such as stacking or signal processing. =Modeling= Once a good profile is obtained of the physical property that is directly measured, it must be converted to a model of the property that is being investigated. For example, gravity measurements are used to obtain a model of the density profile under the surface. This is called an inverse problem. Given a model of the density, the gravity measurements at the surface can be predicted; but in an inverse problem the gravity measurements are known and the density must be inferred. This problem has uncertainties due to the noise and limited coverage of the surface, but even with perfect coverage many possible models of the interior could fit the data. Thus, additional assumptions must be made to constrain the model. Depending on the data coverage, the model may only be a 2D model of a profile. Or a set of parallel transects may be interpreted using a 2¬ΩD model, which assumes that relevant features are elongated. For more complex features, a 3D model may be obtained using tomography. =Geological interpretation= The final step in a project is the geological interpretation. A positive gravity anomaly may be an igneous intrusion, a negative anomaly a salt dome or void. A region of higher electrical conductivity may have water or galena. For a good interpretation the geophysics model must be combined with geological knowledge of the area. Seismology Upper figure: a seismic profile showing intensity vs round-trip travel time. Lower figure: an interpretation of the results. Seismology makes use of the ability of vibrations to travel through rock as seismic waves. These waves come in two types: pressure waves (P-waves) and shear waves (S-waves). P-waves travel faster than S-waves, and both have trajectories that bend as the wave speeds change with depth. Refraction seismology makes use of these curved trajectories. In addition, if there are discontinuities between layers in the rock or sediment, seismic waves are reflected. Reflection seismology identifies these layer boundaries by the reflections. =Reflection seismology= Seismic reflection is used for imaging of nearly horizontal layers in the Earth. The method is much like echo sounding. It can be used to identify folding and faulting, and to search for oil and gas fields. On a regional scale, profiles can be combined to get sequence stratigraphy, making it possible to date sedimentary layers and identify eustatic sea level rise. =Refraction seismology= Seismic refraction can be used not only to identify layers in rocks by the trajectories of the seismic waves, but also to infer the wave speeds in each layer, thereby providing some information on the material in each layer. Magnetic surveying Magnetic surveying can be done on a planetary scale (for example, the survey of Mars by the Mars Global Surveyor) or on a scale of meters. In the near-surface, it is used to map geological boundaries and faults, find certain ores, buried igneous dykes, locating buried pipes and old mine workings, and detecting some kinds of land mines. It is also used to look for human artifacts. Magnetometers are used to search for anomalies produced by targets with a lot of magnetically hard material such as ferrites. Microgravity surveying High precision gravity measurements can be used to detect near surface density anomalies, such as those associated with sinkholes and old mine workings, with repeat monitoring allowing near-surface changes over these to be quantified. Ground- penetrating radar Ground-penetrating radar is one of the most popularly used near-surface geophysics in forensic archaeology, forensic geophysics, geotechnical investigation, treasure hunting, and hydrogeology, with typical penetration depths down to below ground level, depending upon local soil and rock conditions, although this depends upon the central frequency transmitter/receiver antennae utilised. Bulk ground conductivity Bulk ground conductivity typically uses transmitter/receiver pairs to obtain primary/secondary EM signals from the surrounding environment (note potential difficulty in urban areas with above-ground EM sources of interference), with collection areas depending upon the antennae spacing and equipment used. There are airborne, land- and water-based systems currently available. They are particularly useful for initial ground reconnaissance work in geotechnical, archaeology and forensic geophysics investigations. Electrical resistivity Electrical resistivity tomography profile The reciprocal of conductivity, electrical resistivity surveys measure the resistance of material (usually soil) between electrical probes, with typical penetration depths one to two times the electrode separations. There are various electrode configurations of equipment, the most typical using two current and two potential electrodes in a dipole-dipole array. They are used for geotechnical, archaeology and forensic geophysics investigations and have better resolution than most conductivity surveys. They do experience significant changes with soil moisture content, a difficulty in most site investigations with heterogeneous ground and differing vegetation distributions. Applications Milsom & Eriksen (2011) provide a useful field book for field geophysics. =Archaeology= Geophysical methods can be used to find or map an archaeological site remotely, avoiding unnecessary digging. They can also be used to date artifacts. In surveys of a potential archaeological site, features cut into the ground (such as ditches, pits and postholes) may be detected, even after filled in, by electrical resistivity and magnetic methods. The infill may also be detectable using ground-penetrating radar. Foundations and walls may also have a magnetic or electrical signature. Furnaces, fireplaces and kilns may have a strong magnetic anomaly because a thermoremanent magnetization has been baked into magnetic minerals. Geophysical methods were extensively used in recent work on the submerged remains of ancient Alexandria as well as three nearby submerged cities (Herakleion, Canopus and Menouthis). Methods that included side-scan sonar, magnetic surveys and seismic profiles uncovered a story of bad site location and a failure to protect buildings against geohazards. In addition, they helped to locate structures that may be the lost Great Lighthouse and palace of Cleopatra, although these claims are contested. =Forensics= Forensic geophysics is increasingly being used to detect near-surface objects/materials related to either a criminal or civil investigation. The most high-profile objects in criminal investigations are clandestine burials of murder victims, but forensic geophysics can also include locating unmarked burials in graveyards and cemeteries, a weapon used in a crime, or buried drugs or money stashes. Civil investigations are more often trying to determine the location, amount and (more tricky) the timing of illegally dumped waste, which include physical (e.g. fly-tipping) and liquid contaminants (e.g. hydrocarbons). There are many geophysical methods that could be employed, depending upon the target and background host materials. Most commonly ground-penetrating radar is used but this may not always be an optimal search detection technique. =Geotechnical investigations= Geotechnical investigations use near-surface geophysics as a standard tool, both for initial site characterisation and to gauge where to subsequently undertake intrusive site investigation (S.I.) which involves boreholes and trial pits. In rural areas conventional SI methods may be employed but in urban areas or in difficult sites, targeted geophysical techniques can rapidly characterise a site for follow-up, intensive surface or near-surface investigative methods. Most common is searching for buried utilities and still-active cables, cleared building foundations, determining soil type(s) and bedrock depth below ground level, solid/liquid waste contamination, mineshafts and relict mines below ground locations and even differing ground conditions. Indoor geophysical investigations have even been undertaken. Techniques vary depending upon the target and host materials as mentioned.

His stage name (always spelled with a capital \\"M\\" and a capital \\"K\\") is a homage to 1960s British pop producer Joe Meek. A multi-instrumentalist, MeeK plays all the instruments on his recordings through a multitracked/multi-layered method of recording and provides all vocals including multi-layered backing harmonies. Since his first album in 2002 and an ever strong presence on the Internet right from its very early days as a mass media,MeeK's new album reviewed on CLUAS MeeK is part of the European pop/rock Indie music scene. Over the years and through word-of-mouth some have come to consider him a \\"cult-artist\\" because of his ever dedicated worldwide fanbase, his rather non-typical and enigmatic persona and the fact that he is one of the first few artists in Europe who have pioneered in utilizing the Internet as a marketing tool and a medium to publicize and/or expose their music to the general public in the late-1990s, long before the advent of social networks like MySpace, Facebook or YouTube. After having briefly been a member of London-based Indie acoustic-pop bands Tin Can Heart and Elsewhere in the mid-1990s, MeeK was signed as a solo songwriter by Stephane Berlow of BMG Music Publishing France in 1996. With the encouragement and support of French actors Jean-Pierre Bacri, Agn√®s Jaoui and Jamel Debbouze, MeeK released his first album titled \\"Psychotique\\" (Psychotic) in 2002 on the record label Bedroom to a warm critical reception in France. The CD created what was not yet called an Internet buzz (the Web still being in its infancy as a mainstream media in the early-2000s), and was well noticed in the French Indie music scene of the time. French pop artist Calogero decided to sponsor MeeK after hearing him on the radio and mistaking him for a female performer because of his rather high-pitched vocal range. Calogero then invited MeeK to perform his single \\"Psychotique\\" on \\"The Live Caf√©\\", one of the first music programs on the French Web, produced in partnership by Universal Music and NRJ Radio station. MeeK's \\"Psychotique\\" album was also released in a deluxe digipack version in Japan by Tokyo Indie record label MINF Records with an introductory essay by leader of Japanese pop group Pizzicato Five Yasuharu Konishi, drawing a camparison between the Franco- English songwriter and Paul McCartney amongst others. Since then, all MeeK albums have been released in Japan by the same record label. In 2003 and at the request of his Japanese label, MeeK released the album \\"Sleeping with Big Ben\\" composed of fourteen Lennon-McCartney songs recorded in an all-acoustic and vocal treatment. The tribute album's release was limited to the Japanese market only and soon became a popular collectable amongst curious Beatles fans around the world. The album was finally released in a digital form worldwide in 2011. In 2004, his second album of original songs \\"Margaret Et Ses Bijoux\\" (Margaret And Her Jewels) was released and can be defined as a concept album. It confirmed the \\"MeeK buzz\\" on the Internet and scored excited reviews in the French music press as well as on many professional music blogs. In 2004, MeeK translated what is considered the only official \\"autobiography\\" by Paul McCartney the former Beatle wrote in collaboration with Barry Miles in 1997, \\"Many Years From Now\\", in French for Paris publisher Flammarion (French title : \\"Les Beatles, les Sixties & moi\\" ‚Äì The Beatles, the '60s and Me). In 2008 and after a two-year hiatus due to serious health concerns, MeeK recorded his third album \\"Sortie De Secours\\" (Emergency Exit) which he co-produced with Maxime Monegier Du Sorbier. Collaborating for the first time with a dozen musicians during the recording sessions, MeeK used no machines, synthesizers nor samplers at all during the album production that spanned more than 10 months. A real string section appeared on several tracks as well as a Celtic bagpipes section for the title \\"Je Vous Aime Immediatement\\". The album lead single \\"Six Feet Under\\" is MeeK's most commercially successful hit with the single \\"So Fresh\\" so far and a nod to the HBO TV series of the same name. The single entered hundreds of campus and college radio stations playlists around the world and was the first independent music production to have cracked the Swiss state radio station Radio Suisse Romande's Top 20 while its promo video created a remarkable YouTube buzz. In 2010, several Electronic artists including The Electronic Matter, The OriginalFake and Lyhne remixed a few tracks from the \\"Sortie De Secours\\" album which were compiled on the \\"ElectroMeeK MySpace\\" parallel to the regular official Meek MySpace. In April 2011, the album \\"Archives 97/07\\" compiling 15 unreleased tracks recorded during sessions from MeeK's four previous efforts was released in digital form worldwide. MeeK began recording sessions for his next album in April 2011 in Paris and the album titled \\"Aristocracy\\" is an English album, co-produced by MeeK and (musicianAmerican partnership Ramses & Beaumond (group pseudonym of Christopher Hannover-Klein and Andy Ambrose),MeeK's forthcoming album : one transatlantic virtual albumMeeK's new Aristocracy album out in October After the successive releases of 2 singles, the college-radio-friendly \\"So Fresh\\" in 2012 and the cold and icy \\"Monolith #6\\" in 2013 announcing the long-awaited album,MeeK's So Fresh singleMeeK's Monolith #6 single the long anticipated \\"Aristocracy\\" album was finally released worldwide on April the 1st 2015.MeeK's Aristocracy Album The album took 5 years in the making, using 6 different studios in Paris, London, South of France and Los Angeles.

Painted in 1917 when Mir√≥ was 24 years old, a year before his first exhibition, the portrait is now considered a masterpiece from a period when he experimented with both Cubism and Fauvism. It is also said by some art critics to show the influence of Van Gogh. Acquired for a time by Picasso, the painting is now in the permanent collection of the Folkwang Museum in Essen (Germany).  History  Mir√≥ (1893-1983) showed an early passion for art, and attended drawing classes while he was at primary school, but he had been heading for a career in banking when he had a nervous breakdown and decided to study art. He met Vicen√ß Nubiola whilst studying life art at Barcelona's Cercle Art√≠stic de Sant Lluc, a catholic-inspired art society, in 1913. Nubiola was a professor of agriculture at the School of Fine Arts in Barcelona. At the art society Mir√≥ also met Joan Prats, who became one of his lifelong friends and eventually helped Mir√≥ to build his foundation. Mir√≥ painted the Nubiola portrait during 1917 and shortly after. It was included in his first solo exhibition, at the Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, catalogue number 46.Joan Mir√≥ exhibition catalogue, 16 February - 3 March 1918, Galeries Dalmau Joan Mir√≥ - GuggenheimJoan Mir√≥ a la Viquip√®dia, Estat de la q√ºesti√≥ el juny de 2016, Biography, Works, Fundaci√≥ Joan Mir√≥, Premi Joan Mir√≥, Text and image sources  Description  This is one of the well-known works from Mir√≥'s early period when he experimented with a mixture of both Cubism and Fauvism. At this time he made several landscapes and portraits, such as Portrait of Enric Crist√≤fol Ricart also from 1917 and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Several authors comment that this work could be influenced by the style of Van Gogh for whom Mir√≥ always felt admiration. The Nubiola portrait is signed Mir√≥ in the lower left margin. The painting shows Nubiola sitting in a chair beside a table on which there are fruit, a porr√≥ (typical Catalan wine vessel for drinking directly without a glass), and a potted plant. The flat backdrop behind the figure is decorated with triangles and arcs. The red of Nubiola's open collar shirt indicates his political radicalism; Mir√≥ painted himself wearing an identical shirt in a later self-portrait. This work was later acquired by Picasso. Provenance This portrait has been in the permanent collection of the Folkwang Museum in Essen (Germany), since 1966 when it was purchased from the Galerie Wilhelm Gro√ühennig in D√ºsseldorf. The purchase was made with the support from the state of North Rhine - Westphalia, the Westdeutsche Rundfunk, and it entered the museum with the registration number Inv. G 351.

It is the seat of the Diocese of Boise. The church building was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. It was included as a contributing property of the St. John's Cathedral Block when the rest of the parish buildings on Block 90 were added to the National Register in 1982. with That same year, the parish buildings were included as a contributing property in the Fort Street Historic District. History An early photo of the cathedral The first Catholic church in Boise was dedicated on Christmas Eve 1870, but was destroyed in a fire 18 days later. Another frame structure was built that would serve as the cathedral of the Vicariate Apostolic of Idaho, established March 5, 1883, and the Diocese of Boise after it was established on August 25, 1893. It was located on the northwest corner of Ninth and Bannock Streets. As the city grew, a larger cathedral was needed and Bishop Alphonse Glorieux purchased property bounded by Fort, Hays, Eighth, and Ninth Streets. He laid the cornerstone for the present cathedral in 1906. So as not to be a financial drain on the parish, the church building was built in stages. After the lower level was completed the parish worshiped there. The walls and roof were completed in 1912, and the cathedral was completed in 1921 during the episcopate of Bishop Daniel Gorman, who dedicated it on March 27, Easter Sunday. The rectory behind the cathedral was completed in 1906 for $12,000 as the Bishop Glorieux house. The 2¬Ω-story Tudor Revival structure features large gabled dormers, exposed rafters under all of the lateral eaves, a stone foundation, brick veneer and stone quoins on the first floor, and half-timbering on the second floor. The present school building, called St. Joseph's School, was completed in 1925. The two-story brick structure was built for $35,000. The gymnasium was added to the school building in 1948. It is a two-story concrete structure. The school's name memorializes St. Joseph's church in Idaho City, which was destroyed by fire in 1867. It was the first Catholic church in the area. Architecture The cathedral's apse in 2009 St. John's Cathedral was designed by one of the first architectural firms to work in Boise, Tourtellotte & Hummel. Built in the Romanesque Revival style, the architects used the Cathedral of Mainz in western Germany and the Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse as their inspiration. The exterior is Boise Sandstone, quarried just above the city at Table Rock. The building is cruciform in shape and measures from front to back, at the transepts and in the nave. with The building was designed to have two towers topped with spires flanking the main fa√ßade, but they have not been completed. A rose window graces the front of the church and the center gable above the main entrance features a statue of St. John the Evangelist on its peak. Corbeling, a continuous band of small projecting arches, encircles the building at the roofline. A fl√©che rises above the crossing. The stained glass windows in the nave depict scenes from the life of Christ. The large window in the north transept depicts the Adoration of the Magi, flanked by windows portraying St. Alphonsus Ligouri and St. Theresa of Avila. The south transept window depicts the Ascension and is flanked by windows portraying St. Patrick and St. Rita. The windows in the sanctuary depict St. Joseph on the north and the Blessed Virgin Mary on the south. In the apse are windows portraying the Sacred Heart of Jesus and the Immaculate Heart of Mary. They are flanked by windows portraying the Four Evangelists. Although some of the art glass was installed by the Intermountain Glass Company of Boise, the stained glass windows were designed and installed by the John J. Kinsella Company of Chicago in 1920, except the window portraying the Holy Spirit in the center of the apse, which was installed in 1979. St. Cecilia is depicted in the window above the pipe organ. The 3-manual, 2900-pipe organ was installed by Tellers-Kent in 1921. At the time, composer Frederick Fleming Beale, professor of music at the College of Idaho, was organist and choir director. = Restoration and Remodel = The architecture of the building features Romanesque Revival The interior of the church had a major cleaning in 1952 and In 1960, another remodeling plan took place and the parish decided to continue to work with the Hummel family, hiring Charles Hummel's grandson, who was named Charles after his grandfather. Charles Hummel Jr. also worked on the 1979 restoration, focusing on four main ideas. He wanted to restore all the stained glass windows that illustrate the stories of the saints, create more seating for the different groups of people who would come to the cathedral for ceremonies, celebrations, and worship, renew the canvas accents and designs in the interior, and bring in tasteful modern lighting fixtures which accented the classic renaissance look but accommodated to the needs of the citizens. To accomplish such ideas, Hummel had to make some radical changes to the Cathedral's interior. He also made sure important architectural details were not changed during the remodel. These details include the decorative gargoyles that metaphorically hold the weight of the church on their backs as a punishment for their sins, and the windows he restored. To celebrate the church's centennial, Rob Thorton took on the job of remodeling the downstairs chapel. Not wanting to tread on the shoes of Hummel's original artistry, Thorton worked with him on the project. He took the plaster off the walls to expose the stone beneath but kept a section of the wood paneling that Hummel added in 1979. Thorton also added a dome-shaped hole in the ceiling of the chapel. Thorton not only worked on the chapel in the lower level but on the reception hall as well. He took out the brown carpeting, exposed the stone on the walls, and created more space. The baptismal font was redesigned as a pool and the former font was repurposed as an ambry to hold the holy oils. A reservation altar for the tabernacle was created in the south transept. The canopy was from the former high altar. St John's received an Orchid Award in 1981 from the Idaho Historic Preservation Council for outstanding work in restoration.

The company was founded in 1935 in Copenhagen, Denmark by B√∏rge Aagaard Nielsen and Carl Schr√∏der. It has over 3,200 employees and direct representation in more than 32 countries. Corporate headquarters remain in Copenhagen. History In 1935, engineers, B√∏rge Aagaard Nielsen and Carl Schr√∏der, founded Radiometer to develop measuring devices for the growing Danish radio industry. A few years later, Radiometer was contacted by the Carlsberg laboratories and asked to develop an analytical device for the detection of the acid-base (pH) level in liquids. This soon resulted in the first commercially available pH meter. In 1952, as the polio epidemic swept across Europe, many children were at risk of respiratory failure. The head of laboratory, professor Poul Astrup, and anesthesiologist Bj√∏rn Ibsen discovered the right diagnosis by measuring the pH value in blood using Radiometer's pH meters. This ground-breaking discovery soon formed the basis for Radiometer's entry into medical technology and further innovations within acute care testing. Today Radiometer's devices are present in 16 of the top 20 hospitals in America as identified in the 2016-2017 U.S. News & World Report Honor Roll of Best Hospitals. Their products are typically used in blood banks, operating rooms, clinics, general practice offices, intensive care units, neonatal intensive care units and pediatric intensive care units. In 1998 Radiometer acquired Carlsbad, California based SenDx Medical, Inc. SenDx manufactures medical and industrial instruments and blood analysis systems. Later, in 2013, Radiometer acquired Swedish diagnostics company HemoCue AB from Quest Diagnostics. HemoCue develops, produces and markets medical diagnostic products for point-of-care testing like hemoglobin, glucose and others worldwide.

He became an advocate for student voting rights in college after his campus polling place experienced the longest lines in the 2004 presidential election  Career  After the reported 12 hour-long voting lines at Kenyon College in 2004, Segal provided testimony to the US House Judiciary Committee, which was investigating election irregularities, at the age of 19, noting that \\"It seems almost hypocritical that a society so focused on the importance of the vote did not concern itself more heavily with the actual process of voting.\\" When a junior in college, Segal founded Student Association for Voter Empowerment (SAVE) with the stated aim of \\"work[ing] to bring young Americans into the political process by breaking down barriers to electoral participation and encouraging youth-led policy solutions.\\" He founded SAVE at age 21, which expanded to 40 college campuses in more than 15 states, and worked on election protection initiatives as well as expanding voter access through initiatives such as the Student VOTER Act. After the 2008 presidential election, Segal co- founded the 80 Million Strong for Young American Jobs Coalition, the largest campaign of organizations in the United States that addressed youth unemployment and other economic challenges facing individuals under 30. In this capacity, Segal spearheaded a national jobs summit in the U.S. Capitol with hundreds of young leaders, provided testimony to the House Education and Labor Committee, and was the only youth representative invited to attend President Barack Obama‚Äôs conference on jobs and economic growth.  Our Time  In 2010, Segal combined SAVE with Declare Yourself, a voter registration non-profit founded by TV producer and director Norman Lear to form Our Time with the goal of bringing economic power to his generation, in the midst of the recession and beyond. As an initiative of Our Time, Segal and his colleagues also launched Buy Young, an online marketplace of businesses founded and run by entrepreneurs under 30, encouraging Americans to purchase products from young companies and support youth job creation. Segal convened more than 125 young CEOs and executives in Washington, D.C. on July 13, 2011, at the White House, the Chamber of Commerce and Capitol Hill to launch the effort and push for greater job creation and economic opportunities for young Americans.

History repeated itself in the unusual top floor loft space in the historic Dixie Terminal Building. First occupied over 90 years ago by the building's original and noted architects, Garber and Woodward, and following over six months of design, planning and construction, the space became home to Design Team One.  History  Based on growing public awareness that graphic design can be a powerful marketing tool, Design Team One was founded in 1981 on the subsequent premise that synergy between advertising (a client company's paid media: print, TV and radio) and its branding and graphic design would produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate efforts. In 1985, board members Alex Stolley, Bill Lawarre and President, Dan Bittman purchased the company from Northlich Stolley LaWarre and moved its offices from the agency's building to the top floor of the city's historic Dixie Terminal Building designed by Frederick W. Garber. Design Team One was a destination studio on the IDSA (Industrial Designers Society of America) 1985 World Design Congress USA Tour. In 1988, Bittman purchased Stolley and LaWarre's shares and became the studio's majority shareholder. In 1994, Beverly Fox became an equal shareholder and in 2006 was appointed President & COO. In 2011, Dan Bittman was awarded the AIGA Fellow Medal.  Scope and clientele  Design Team One provides a range of graphic design services including corporate identity, print collateral (brochures, stationery, annual reports, posters), packaging, environmental graphics (exhibits, signage) and website design. They have designed projects for many well known organizations, such as Chiquita, The Limited, NCR, Procter & Gamble, The Cincinnati Zoo, GE and NIOSH. They have also done pro bono work for organizations including Boy Scouts of America, John P. Parker Historical Society and Junior Achievement. In 1995, the studio's work for the Cincinnati Ballet Company was honored by permanent inclusion in the Mus√©e de l'Affiche de Chaumont and was selected for the UAI/UNESCO \\"World's Most Memorable Poster\\" International Traveling Exhibit.
