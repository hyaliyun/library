Operating in Malawi, Sierra Leone, the Dominican Republic, Uganda, and Haiti, COTN helps nearly 7,000 children on a daily basis. COTN's stated goal is to \\"Raise children who transform nations.\\" Children of the Nations is a Christian nonprofit organization headquartered in Silverdale, Washington, USA. History Children of the Nations (COTN) was founded in 1995 by Chris Clark, a fifth-generation missionary raised in Africa, and his wife, Debbie Clark. On assignment in Sierra Leone, Chris and Debbie encountered orphans and refugee children in dire need of assistance and started COTN with the desire to meet the needs of those children. Today, COTN is operating in Sierra Leone, Malawi, Uganda, Dominican Republic, and Haiti to provide holistic care for orphaned and destitute children. Organizational structure Children of the Nations International operates as a non- governmental organization (NGO) within the United States with its headquarters in Silverdale, WA. COTN also operates regional offices in Seattle, Washington; Orlando, Florida; and Orange County, California. Each COTN country office is set up as its own NGO with a local board of directors overseeing operations within that country. Operations COTN's main area of focus is providing care for the most desperate children in each of the geographic areas where the organization serves. They do this through a two-pronged approach, by providing full-time care for orphaned children and by partnering with communities to care for orphaned and destitute children living with caregivers who are unable to provide for them. All children enrolled in COTN's programs receive food, education, medical care, and mentoring, depending on their specific needs. COTN's main goal is to raise these children to become future leaders of their communities. This is accomplished through child sponsorship as well as the donation of funds, resources, and volunteer work related to the construction of children's homes, schools, medical clinics, vocational skills centers, farms, and feeding centers. This assistance is intended to lead to self- sustainability, not dependence. The organization also puts a large emphasis on short-term mission trips in the countries where it serves. More than 400 individuals traveled overseas with COTN in 2016.

Riggs Park is contained between Eastern Avenue N.E. to the east, Riggs Road N.E. to the south, North Capitol Street N.W. to the north and west, and the Blair Road Community Garden to the north. Riggs Park is adjacent to the neighborhoods of Queens Chapel, North Michigan Park, and Fort Totten, located in Ward 5 of Northeast Washington D.C.. In addition to these neighborhoods, Riggs Park also borders the city/neighborhood Chillum, which is located in Prince George's County, Maryland. The WMATA Red Line train tracks pass through the Riggs Park neighborhood when traveling between the Takoma and Fort Totten Metro Stations. In addition to the WMATA Red Line, the CSX, MARC, and Amtrak train tracks, pass through the Riggs Park neighborhood as well. History Most of Riggs Park's residents were white and Jewish until the 1960s when most of them began leaving the city to settle in the suburbs. Riggs Park's combination of affordable housing and convenience/proximity to Downtown Washington D.C., attracted many African- American residents to move in.Taylor, Ronald. \\"Riggs Park: Largely Untouched by War: Area Little Touched by War\\". Washington Post. August 19, 1973. p. B1. Riggs Park was home to a synagogue in the 1950s, including a Conservative synagogue named Shaare Tefila Congregation. Shaare Tefila was relocated to White Oak in 1965. In 2011, Shaare Tefila was relocated again to Olney, where many young members now live. During the height of the Jewish community, Riggs Park was known as the \\"Little Tel Aviv\\" of Washington, D.C. and was home to a large population of young Jewish couples and their families. The Jewish community grew quickly in the 1950s because many Jews who had served in the military were eligible to purchase a home under the G.I. Bill. As African- Americans began to move to Riggs Park in the 1960s, the majority of Jews in the neighborhood sold their homes and moved to suburban Maryland. By the early 1980s, Riggs Park was home to a large middle-class black population. In 2001, Chevron told residents of Riggs Park that gasoline had spilled just across the Maryland state line 12 years prior and that the fuel had seeped under 169 residents' houses, an elementary school, and a church. Residents filed a lawsuit in United States District Court. Chevron said it had complied with laws by informing the state of Maryland about the leak after its discovery and that it was pumping the gas out of the ground and removing the contaminated dirt. In 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to clean up leaked gasoline, to be paid for by Chevron. In 2009, the District of Columbia released environmental test results, and perchloroethylene and methyl tert- butyl ether were detected in shallow groundwater samples. Gasoline was detected in soil samples. Chevron settled a lawsuit with the District of Columbia Department of the Environment in 2011. Chevron agreed to pay for the installation of Vapor Mitigation Systems into 43 homes in Riggs Park. References Category:African-American history of Washington, D.C.

Although some films of this period were composed for the Academy aspect ratio and released in wide-screen during the confusion, Spooks! and future releases were composed at 1.85:1, Columbia's house ratio. Spooks! was filmed on May 11–15, 1953, and released just 31 days after production due to Columbia Pictures' desire to cash in on the 3D craze.

He served in the Virginia House of Delegates for six years and a year in the Commonwealth's small executive branch (Council of State). The majority of his public career was as a judge, first of the General Court and later (for 27 years) on the Court of Appeals (which later became the Supreme Court of Virginia). Early life and education Roane was born in Tappahannock on April 4, 1762.The William and Mary quarterly, Volume 4, page 249Elbert Watson (1964) and David R. Sowell (1988), Papers of Governor Archibald Roane, 1801-1803, Tennessee State Library and Archives. His grandfather, William Roane, of Scots-Irish descent, had emigrated from Ireland like his three brothers circa 1741 to Gloucester County, Virginia, and married a local woman, who bore him six children. The family moved slightly north to Tappahannock in what was then Rappahannock County and prospered: Spencer's father William (who owned plantations in what had become Essex County in 1692, as well as nearby King and Queen County) served in the House of Burgesses from 1769 until the American Revolutionary War, as the prosecutor (deputy King's attorney) for Essex County, and as a colonel of the county militia during the American Revolutionary War. As discussed further below, William married Judith Ball, who gave birth to a son Thomas, and then Spencer, who was named after a maternal relation.David J. Mays, Sketch of Judge Spencer Roane in Annual Reports of the Virginia State Bar Association (1928) Spencer Roane received his initial schooling at home, under a Scottish tutor named Bradfute. He then entered the College of William and Mary aged 14, to study law under the tutelage of George Wythe, from whom he gained great appreciation of Edward Coke and the English system of property rights, as well as constitutional law, but disliked studying equity.Mays p. 1, citing Sketch of Roane in John P. Branch Historical Papers (Randolph-Macon College) vol. II, p. 4 Roane also became a member of the relatively new Phi Beta Kappa Society, then a literary and oratory association, along with future U.S. Supreme Court justices Bushrod Washington and John Marshall. After graduating in January, 1780, as the college temporarily closed so its buildings could house French and American soldiers during the final Yorktown campaign of the American Revolutionary War, Roane traveled to Philadelphia for two years of additional legal studies in the then-nation's capitol. Law and Politics After Roane returned to Virginia, he read law under John Warden.Clyde Christian Gelbach, Spencer Roane of Virginia, 1762-1822: A Judicial Advocate of State's Rights (University of Pittsburgh doctoral dissertation, 1955) p. 8 After examination by Henry Tazewell and John Taylor, Roane was admitted to the Virginia bar in 1782, at age 20.Margaret E. Horsnell, Spencer Roane: Judicial Advocate of Jeffersonian Principles (New York: Garland Publishing, 1986)(Garland Series of Outstanding Legal dissertations) pp. 6-7 Both Spencer Roane and his former schoolmate John Marshall entered politics soon after beginning their legal careers, and each won election to the Virginia House of Delegates from different districts in 1783. Virginia law permitted legislators to continue private legal practices, and Roane did so. That year Tappahannock citizens had tarred and feathered merchant Joseph Williamson, a loyalist who had returned to the town several years after helping the British bring ships up the Rappahannock River and burn the town. One of Roane's first legislative proposals was a petition asking that charges against his constituents be dismissed because the peace treaty with Britain had been signed in the fall, months after the incident.Horsnell pp. 14-15;Gelbach pp. 13-14 Roane was a Presbyterian, not a member of the formally established Episcopal Church, and religious freedom for Baptists and Presbyterians was a hot topic during legislative sessions of the new Commonwealth. Virginia's legislators had passed laws mandating religious toleration, and abolishing compulsory church tithes, in December 1776. In 1784 Virginia's legislators allowed incorporation of the Episcopal Church, as well as vested church property in ministers and vestries, subject to triennial inventory reports to county courts. Despite the urging of prominent Episcopalians Patrick Henry, John Marshall, Edmond Randolph and Richard Henry Lee, legislators refused to assess taxes to support Christian religion or collective worship. Roane had opposed both on religious establishment ground, although at the session's end Roane voted to allow incorporation of all societies of Christian religion.Gelbach, pp. 15-16 Moreover, following the lead of Jefferson and Madison (as well as young Roane), Virginia's legislators passed a law for the Establishment of Religious Freedom in 1785.Horsnell pp. 11-13 In November 1784, fellow legislators selected Roane to serve a one-year term on the Virginia Council of State.Dabney, Richmond: The Story of a City (University Press of Virginia, 1990 rev. ed), p. 66. Roane thus helped advise Governor Patrick Henry during the year that began in May, 1785. His only recorded dissent concerned an attempted removal of a justice of the peace for misconduct, which Roane thought interfered with the separation of powers.Horsnell pp. 16-17 After his resignation, Roane was elected to the Virginia Senate to represent the counties of Essex, King and Queen and King William.Mays p. 3 During the tumultuous debate concerning ratification of the federal Constitution in 1787, Roane advocated ratification, on the condition of adding a bill of rights because the document as drafted did not clarify powers reserved to the states and the people.Horsnell pp. 18-19 Although Roane began his judicial career in 1789, a year after the death of his father, as discussed below, he did not abandon his interest in politics. In 1804, Roane persuaded his schoolteacher cousin Thomas Ritchie, to establish the Richmond Enquirer as an intellectual counterweight to the Richmond Recorder (which supported the Federalists). The Enquirer supported the Democratic-Republican Party of Thomas Jefferson and others. Roane, Ritchie and Dr. John Brockenbrough—all from distinguished families of Essex County—became known as the Essex Junto because of their political power in county courts throughout the Commonwealth and the officeholders dependent on them.Dabney, p. 66, 116. The junto's activities were later glamorized as Virginia resisted the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. See Harry Ammon, The Richmond Junto:1800-1824, 16 Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1953 no. 4) pp. 395-418(1953). John Randolph of Roanoke, John Taylor of Caroline County, Andrew Stevenson and Benjamin Watkins Leigh also later came to be characterized as members of what was also called the Richmond junto. In fact, some considered Roane the leader of the state's Republican party, and he participated in various activities with Thomas Jefferson, including selecting the site for the University of Virginia. Judicial career In 1789, fellow legislators appointed Spencer Roane, then 27 years old, a judge of the General Court, which had been reorganized as a trial court in 1777 and 1788. While on the General Court (where he continued until 1794), Roane declared a legislative act unconstitutional for interfering with judicial independence in Kamper v. Hawkins, 1 Virginia Cases 35-56 (Va.1789-1814) (concerning the merger of the Chancery and General Courts). The Court of Appeals upheld that decision, although the exact date is uncertain.Horsnell pp.22-23 and note 55 In 1794, Roane resigned from the General Court in order to accept the legislature's appointment as a judge of the Court of Appeals, where he succeeded his former examiner Henry Tazewell, who had become a United States Senator. The thirty-two-year-old Roane then sold his Mahockney Plantation mahockney.org and moved to Richmond. All the other members of that appellate court had begun practicing law before his birth. Roane sought the guidance of distinguished judge Edmund Pendleton, and on the latter's death in 1803, Roane became that high court's most influential judge, and remained on that bench until his death on September 4, 1822. Roane gained reputations for advocating States' Rights, as well as for opposing U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall. This disagreement was partly political, because President John Adams appointed Marshall after losing the contested election, and President-elect Thomas Jefferson was rumored to favor Roane for the position. But their political divergence began years earlier, when Marshall agreed to represent abolition advocate Pleasants, the executor of Quaker merchant who sought to free slaves pursuant to his father's will, although such a provision had been illegal when drafted, as pointed out by other heirs who sought to have enslaved property. Roane's opinion in Pleasants v. Pleasants allowed the executor to free the slaves, but reinforced the legal basis for the \\"peculiar institution.\\" In 1815, Roane defied the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, which he feared marked a drift toward abolition of slavery. In 1819, Roane editorialized (under the pen names \\"Hampden\\" and \\"Amphictyon\\") against Marshall and the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in McCulloch v. Maryland.Susan Dunn, Dominion of Memories (New York:Basic Books 2007) p. 143. When in 1820, Marshall wrote for his court in Cohens v. Virginia, on its face simply concerning the sale of lottery tickets, but which also tested Federal jurisdiction over transactions completed entirely within a single state, Roane (as \\"Algernon Sidney\\") criticized the decision as the \\"zenith of despotic power\\" and \\"negatives the idea that the states have a real existence.\\"Dunn p. 146.Mays pp. 13-15 Roane had become the judicial voice of opponents of the National Bank, tariffs, and government funded internal improvements. He believed that the federal courts could not entertain lawsuits against states without their consent under tenth and eleventh amendments to the US Constitution, and wrote several opinions foreshadowing the Nullification Crisis. Twice in his lifetime, Judge Roane was appointed to committees to revise Virginia's laws, including the slave codes. Some of the correspondence between Jefferson and Roane remains, although Roane reportedly destroyed many papers before his death.The Writings of Thomas Jefferson, Memorial Edition, Lipscomb and Bergh, eds., vol. 15 (325). Slavery Roane owned slaves, as had his parents and grandparents. He bought a 620-acre plantation of his own, Spring Garden, in Hanover County in 1802, added another 97 acres three years later, and in 1809 and 1810 acquired a neighboring plantation of 1029 acres known as New Castle or Neck Plantation, so by the census of that year owned 39 enslaved persons and 15 horses and mules.Mays at pp. 5-6 Marriage and family relationships Spencer Roane was named for Col. Nicholas Spencer, acting Governor of the state of Virginia in 1683–1684. Although Roane wasn't descended from Spencer, he was a family relation. (Col. John Mottrom, first member of the Virginia House of Burgesses for Northumberland County, had a son John Mottrom, who in turn had a son named Spencer Mottrom, named for Gov. Nicholas Spencer, who was married to John Mottrom Jr.'s sister. Capt. Spencer Mottrom's daughter Mary, in turn, was married to Joseph Ball, whose son Spencer Ball had a son Spencer Mottrom Ball, whose daughter Judith married William Roane and bore the future judge Spencer.)William and Mary College Quarterly, Vol. XVII, Lyon G. Tyler, William and Mary College, Whittet & Shepperson, Richmond, Va., 1909 The Roane family continued its political activity and distinction after William Roane died in 1788: his elder brother Thomas was elected to the Virginia senate in the 1790s; and Spencer Roane's elder brother, another Thomas, was elected to the House of Delegates for King and Queen County. Their cousins included Thomas Ritchie, editor of the Richmond Enquirer, and Dr. John Brockenbrough, president of the Bank of Virginia.Margaret E. Horsnell, Spencer Roane: Judicial Advocate of Jeffersonian Principles (New York: Garland Publishing, 1986)(Garland Series of Outstanding Legal dissertations) pp. 2-3 In 1787 Spencer Roane married Anne Henry (1767-1799), second daughter and fourth child of Patrick Henry, who bore four sons and three daughters before her death. Their eldest son, William H. Roane, also became a lawyer and legislator, and twice served on the Executive Council. He represented Henrico County in the state legislature, the Richmond area as a U.S. Representative (1815-1817), and Virginia as a United States Senator (1837–41). Both sons Patrick Henry Roane (1789–91, and 1793-1813) and Fayette Roane (1792-1819) and daughter Elizabeth Roane (1798-1799) predeceased their father, and daughters Anne and Julia disappeared from the historical record, although Spencer's last will mentioned daughter Eliza as well as son William.Mays pp. 5, 17 Roane remarried, to Elizabeth Hoskins, who survived him, but bore no children.Mays p. 4 Death and legacy Spencer Roane became ill in March, 1822 and, realizing that his \\"indisposition\\" was not going away, wrote his last will and testament, as well as traveled to hot springs in Bath, Virginia, where he spent the summer trying to regain his health.Mays p. 17 There he died on September 4, 1822 and was buried in the Brockenbrough Family Cemetery, now part of the greater Warm Springs Cemetery.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/18472831 Roane County, West Virginia and Spencer, the county seat, are both named for Judge Roane.

It is a generic gaming systems designed to adapt to any imaginary gaming environment. It was created by Greg Porter in 2003. The game cites the Hero System, GURPS and Call of Cthulhu as influences in its development. The game books and related materials are available only in a PDF format download, or printed on demand.  History  = Prior RPG History = Role-playing games (RPGs) of the 1970s and early 1980s were environment specific, and incompatible with one another. For example, TSR published its Dungeons & Dragons game specifically for a fantasy environment. Another game from the same company, Star Frontiers, was developed for science fiction-based role- playing. TSR produced other games for other environments, such as Gamma World, Top Secret, Gangbusters, Boot Hill, and more. Each of these games was set with its own self-contained rules system, and the rules for playing each game differed greatly from one game to the next. This changed with the publication of GURPS, or Generic Universal Role Playing System, by Steve Jackson Games in 1986, the first commercially successful, all-encompassing, \\"universal\\" role- playing system. In 1987, BTRC published its first role-playing game, TimeLords, in which players played characters based upon themselves in a time travel setting. As a time travel/sci fi-based game crossing many possible settings, much of the groundwork was already laid for a universal RPG, and in fact some players were already using it as a generic game system. Much of the basics of the TimeLords system would later be converted into EABA. = EABA 1st Edition = EABA was first published in 2003 as a PDF only, available either through online download or print on demand. Publishing in this manner meant the company would not go into debt to print a large run of rulebooks and push them into brick-and-mortar stores, and that future updates to the rules could be easily made and disseminated. BTRC allows purchasers to get free upgrades for life on all titles. = EABA v2 = In 2012, BTRC published its first major revamp of the EABA rules as EABA v2. In addition to significant revamping of the combat turn system, this version made use of many of the built-in features of the Adobe PDF format, and was streamlined for use on tablet or laptop computers. Players have access to automated character sheets, dice rollers, popup menus and on-screen mapping, embedded directly into the PDF file. It is compatible with any computer or device that can read this file type, including smart phones and tablets. The file can also be printed and read like any ordinary rulebook. Reception EABA initially received excellent reviews, and was described as \\"an overlooked and underappreciated Titan in the arena of universal RPG systems\\". Critics praised the simplicity and ease of use, and the ability for players to choose what level of realism to include. Initial criticism focused on the lack of many additional premade settings and the bland artwork. It did not sell incredibly well, and is relatively unknown among RPG fans. The v2 edition also received excellent reviews, calling it \\"the bleeding edge of PDF game development\\", and praising the scalability and portability of the system.  Game Mechanics  =Characters= A character in EABA is built based on attributes, skills and traits. All player characters start with a set number of Attribute Points (AP) to purchase attributes, and Skill Points (SP) to purchase skills. Traits are purchased using either type of points, depending on the trait purchased; negative traits can also be chosen which give a character additional AP or SP to spend. The total number of points available to spend depends on the setting and players. A gritty post-holocaust survival game may only start with 80 AP and SP, while a superhero game could start with 400 AP and SP. In principle a gamemaster can balance the power of foes to the abilities of the player characters by comparing their relative point values. =Attributes= Characters in EABA have six basic attributes: *Strength — A measure of the character’s physical power and bulk, ability to lift, carry, and do damage *Agility — A measure of the character’s physical agility, coordination and manual dexterity *Awareness — A measure of the character’s mental capacity, intelligence and perception *Will — A measure of the character's force of personality, and ability to endure pain *Health — A measure of the character’s physical stamina, ability to resist disease, and speed *Fate — A measure of the character's luck and paranormal abilities. Attribute scores progress exponentially, rather than linearly as is typical of many games. Increasing an ability score by 3 is an approximate doubling of the Attribute. For example, a Strength score of 9 could lift approximately 100 kg, while a score of 12 would double that to 200 kg. A score of 5-9 is considered average for any human attribute, 13 is the upper limit of human ability, and anything over 15 considered legendary. =Skills= Skills are purchased using skill points in a similar manner to attributes. Each skill has an associated attribute; Firearms is based on Agility, Programming based on Awareness, etc. A character without any ability in a particular skill can use the base attribute with a penalty to determine the success of an action. Spending points on a skill will eliminate the penalty and spending more points will grant bonus dice. The basic game system provides an extensive list of possible skills and specializations to them, and each setting comes with listings of additional setting-specific skills. Players are encouraged to create more skills as needed to cover whatever game setting or style they might want. =Traits= Traits are additional things about a character, positive or negative, that help flesh them out. Traits are purchased using either AP or SP, depending on which trait is wanted. Some negative traits give the player additional AP or SP to spend. An example is the character's age. Most characters are considered to start at between 16–20 years old (for humans). An older character would lose Attribute Points, as an aging person would generally get physically weaker; but gain Skill Points, as they generally have learned more skills in their longer life. Characters could also be more (or less) wealthy than average, or have a special ability like exceptional luck or the ability to use magic (depending on the game setting). Various game setting include rules for many additional traits, and players are encouraged to create more as they see fit. = Success Rolls = EABA is a d6-based dice pool system. A higher ability or skill level will allow a player to roll more dice to determine success or failure of an action, but only a limited number of dice - usually three, although there is a Trait that permits four or more under certain conditions - may be chosen from the total number of dice rolled. If there are more than three dice in the pool, one of them may be converted to a +2. So an action with a difficulty of 1 will always succeed, but an action with a difficulty higher than 20 will always fail, as 20 is the highest possible roll on 3d6+2. Additional factors may make an action more or less difficult, thus increasing or decreasing the number needed for success. =Combat= Combat in EABA is handled either by opposing rolls (mêlée) or against a set difficulty (ranged), both of which might be modified by things like target size, movement, visibility and so on. There are also numerous optional rules, such as explosions, called shots, hit locations and their specific damage effects, automatic fire, parrying etc. Combat time in V2 is run on an expanding scale, something unique to EABA. In most RPGs, time in combat is broken down into small manageable chunks: a combat turn in GURPS is always one second, for example. A combat round is EABA starts at one second, the next is 2 seconds, then 4, 8, 15, 30, and one minute. The goal is to make time manageable, but also to allow characters to perform complex actions during combat without taking hours of play time to do so. =Damage and defenses= EABA has three types of damage, lethal, half-lethal, and non-lethal. Cutting and piercing attacks tend to be lethal, crushing attacks half-lethal and unarmed attacks non-lethal. Armor is rated in terms of dice it will stop, and that is subtracted from the possible damage the attack may cause. So armor rated at 1d will reduce 1d of damage to nothing, and 2d of damage to 1d. Armor will generally always stop damage from attacks lower than its rating. For example, a bullet proof vest rated to stop .22 caliber rounds will always stop them, provided the round hits the vest. Additional damage to an already injured body part will have less effect than the first damage. ie, shooting someone in the leg once will reduce their mobility a lot and cause bleeding; shooting the same leg three more times will not reduce their mobility much more. =Advancement= Improving the characters is done with experience points, which are either accumulated for general use by adventuring, or for specific skills by training. Experience points can be used to improve both skills and attributes, with attributes costing much more to improve than skills.

His band, the Matt Schofield Trio, play their own material, a blend of blues, funk and jazz, as well as covers of blues classics such as Albert Collins' \\"Lights Are On, But Nobody's Home\\". Schofield is regarded as one of the most distinctive and innovative British blues guitarists, and has been rated in the top ten of British blues guitarists by Guitar & Bass Magazine. Schofield's prowess has taken his band to twelve countries, seen him playing with musicians including Buddy Guy and Robben Ford, and brought a note in the Penguin Book of Blues Recordings as one of only two living British artists to gain the maximum four-star rating. In addition, he has been admitted to the British Blues Awards Hall of Fame.  Influences  Schofield's guitar playing is often likened to that of Robben Ford in its melodic and fluid style, and jazzy lines. Schofield has been influenced by B.B. King, Freddie King, Albert King, Muddy Waters, Steve Winwood, Eric Clapton, Albert Collins, Jimi Hendrix, Billy Gibbons, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimmie Vaughan, and Tomo Fujita. Career =Recordings= Schofield has recorded five studio albums and four live albums. The first of the live discs, The Trio, Live was recorded at the Bishop's Blues club at The Half Moon, Bishop's Stortford in 2004 and, funded and released by Richard Pavitt on his Nugene record label, gave the band their first breakthrough. The first studio album, Siftin' Thru Ashes was released in 2005. This album showcased Schofield as a songwriter, writing or co-writing eight out of eleven of the tracks. AllMusic called Schofield's approach \\"an enjoyable demonstration of what can happen when blues-rock and blues-jazz are united\\". The second live album, Live at the Jazz Cafe! was recorded at the London Jazz Cafe in April 2005, and was made available as a web only release. Schofield is one of only two living British artists to be given a four star (excellent) rating in the Penguin Book of Blues Recordings. The release of The Trio, Live prompted Schofield to be featured in a Guitarist magazine article, listing the nine notable up and coming blues guitarists, Schofield being the only non- American. Of the album they said \\"britblues meets jazz via N'Orleans – all played with the kind of sizzling guitar that just does not often surface in Fairford, Gloucestershire\\". In 2007, Guitar & Bass Magazine picked Schofield as one of the \\"Top 10 British Blues Guitarists of All Time\\". In August 2009, Schofield released Heads, Tails, & Aces, his third studio effort. The next year (2010) the band collected the Album of the Year award at the British Blues Awards for this album, and released Live from the Archive, recorded in 2007 in the Netherlands. Schofield won the British Blues Guitarist and Jonny Henderson won the British Keyboard Player award, and they both won these awards in 2011, too. In 2011, the trio released their fourth album Anything but Time, with Kevin Haynes on drums and John Porter as record producer. Guitarinstructor.com, a part of the Hal Leonard organisation, has this album as No 5 in their top 10 albums of 2011, while Mojo magazine picked it as No 1 of Blues albums in 2011. In 2012, Schofield made available a third live album Ten From The Road, consisting of material performed live in November 2011 by Schofield with Henderson & Hayes. He released his fifth studio album, called Far As I Can See, in February 2014. =Band= Schofield performs with an organ trio (guitar, organ, and drums). Organ trios are mostly associated with the 1950s and 1960s US soul jazz groups led by organists such as Jimmy Smith. Blues bands more commonly use trios of guitar, bass and drums, quartets (guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums) or quintets (guitar, rhythm guitar, keyboards, bass, and drums). In Schofield's organ trio, organist Jonny Henderson plays a Hammond organ, performing basslines using his left hand, and playing chords and lead lines with his right hand. The trio's drummer is Evan Jenkins. Jeff Walker played bass on the final track of Siftin' Thru' Ashes. In 2009, as of the recording of Heads, Tails & Aces, The Matt Schofield Trio became The Matt Schofield Band, a four-piece, featuring Jeff 'The Funk' Walker on bass, and also replacing Evan Jenkins with Alain Baudry. Jeff Walker was later replaced by Spanish bassist Javier Garcia Vicente. At a concert at the Swindon Arts Centre on 22 October 2009, the band reverted to a trio. In June 2010, Kevin Hayes, replaced Evan Jenkins in the band. The 2012 Europe Tour, the trio was back with its original formation, with Matt Schofield, Evan Jenkins and Jonny Henderson. =Endorsements and gear= Boutique amplifier company Two-Rock developed the Schofield Signature amplifier for Matt. According to Matt, the amplifier is \\"simply the best amplifier I've ever plugged into, and I'm honoured it carries my name\\". Japanese Effects Pedal company Free The Tone also developed the custom MS SOV SPECIAL overdrive pedal for him and released it as a limited edition product in 2013. A full production version, the MS SOV MS-2V, was later released in 2014.

Several great empires and dynasties have ruled over Karnataka and have contributed greatly to the history, culture and development of Karnataka The impact of kingdoms of Karnataka origin have been felt over other parts of India also. The Chindaka Nagas of central India Gangas, Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, Concise history of Karnatakakaushik, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprinted 2002) Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta,Dr. D.R. Bhandarkar argues that even the viceroys (Dandanayaka) of the Gujarat line hailing from the Rashtrakuta family signed their Sanskrit records in Kannada, examples of which are the Navasari and Baroda plates of Karka I and the Baroda records of Dhruva II. The Gujarat Rashtrakuta princes used Kannada signatures as this was the mode of writing in their native country, meaning Kannada country says Dr. Bhandarkar, A Concise History of Karnataka, Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath Chalukyas of Vengi,Dr. Suryanath Kamath, Prof. K.A.N. Sastri, Arthikaje Yadava Dynasty of Devagiri were all of Kannada originDr. Ritti has argued thus. Even though the Seuna or Yadava ruled from Devagiri (850-1315), literature in Kannada was prolific in their kingdom along with Sanskrit, coinage with Kannada legends have been discovered and most of their inscriptions are in Kannada, indicating that they were Kannadaigas who migrated north due to political situation. Marathi literature started from around 1190 C.E., Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, Concise history of Karnataka, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprinted 2002) who later took to encouraging local languages. In the medieval and early modern periods, the Vijayanagara Empire and the Bahmani Sultanate became the major powers in Karnataka. The latter disintegrated to form five Deccan Sultanates. The Deccan Sultanates defeated the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565. After the Anglo-Mysore Wars, where the East India Company defeated the forces of Tipu Sultan, Company Rule began in India. Karnataka was divided between Bombay State, Mysore State, and Hyderabad State. Formal rule under the British Crown began in 1858. During this time, railways and airways, as well as modern universities were introduced in Karnataka. India became Independent in 1947, and according to the States Reorganization Act, 1956, the Kannada-speaking areas of Hyderabad State, Madras State were unified with Mysore State. The state was renamed Karnataka in 1973. Prehistory The credit for doing early extensive study of prehistoric Karnataka goes to Robert Bruce-Foote and this work was later continued by many other scholars.Scholars such as R.V.Joshi, S.Nagaraju, A.Sundara etc. (Kamath 2001, p15) The pre-historic culture of Karnataka (and South India in general) is called the hand-axe culture, as opposed to the Sohan culture of North India. Paleolithic hand axes and cleavers in the shape of pebbles made with quartz and quartzite which have been found in places such as Lingadahalli in Chikkamagaluru district and Hunasagi in Yadgir district, and a wooden spike at Kibbanahalli in Tumkur district are examples of old Stone Age implements.Discovered by Dr. K. Paddayya in 1974 (Kamath 2001, pp15-16) There are reports that a polished stone axe was discovered at Lingasugur in the Raichur districtThe hand axe was discovered by Primrose (Kamath 2001, p15) Neolithic sites (new Stone Age) of importance are Maski in Raichur district, Brahmagiri in Chitradurga district etc., with abundance of evidence that man begun to domesticate animals such as cows, dogs and sheep, use copper and bronze weapons, wear bangles, rings, necklaces of beads and ear-rings and have burial chambers. To the end of the Neolithic era, during the Megalithic age, people in Karnataka began to use long swords, sickles, axes, hammers, spikes, chisels and arrows, all made of iron.Kamath (2001), p18 Scholarly hypothesis postulates contacts between the Indus Valley (3300 BCE - 1300 BCE) cities of Harappa and Lothal, citing the discovery of gold found in the Harappan sites that was imported from mines in Karnataka. Evidence of Neolithic habitation of areas in modern Karnataka and celts dating back to the 2nd century BCE were first discovered in 1872. There are reports that a polished stone axe was discovered at Lingsugur in the Raichur district; however the authenticity of these reports remains unverifiable. Megalithic structures and burial grounds were discovered in 1862 in the regions of Kodagu and Moorey Betta hills, while Neolithic sites were discovered in north Karnataka. Scholarly hypothesis postulates of contacts between the Indus Valley city of Harappa in 3000 BCE, citing the discovery of gold found in the Harappan sites that was imported from mines in Karnataka. Early history Karnataka was the part of the Maurya Empire, the first Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta Maurya died in Shravanbelgola in Hassan District around 298 BCE where he spent last days of his life as Jain ascetic. Around 239 BCE, the Satavahana dynasty came to power and its rule lasted nearly four centuries, until the early 3rd century CE. The disintegration of the Satavahana dynasty led to the ascent of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadamba Dynasty of Banavasi in modern Uttara Kannada district with Mayuravarma, a native of Talagunda in modern Shivamogga district as the founding king,From the Talagunda inscription (Dr. B. L. Rice in Kamath, 2001, p30)Moares (1931), p10From the Talagunda inscription of 450 Kamath, (2001), pp 30-31Ramesh (1984), p6 and the Western Ganga Dynasty in southern Karnataka,Adiga and Sheik Ali in Adiga (2006), p89The Gangas were sons of the Soil - R. S. Panchamukhi and Lakshminarayana Rao marking the birth of the region as an independent political entity. These were the first kingdoms to give administrative status to Kannada language as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription of 450, attributed to King Kakusthavarma of the Kadamba Dynasty.From the Halmidi inscription (Ramesh 1984, pp10–11)Kamath (2001), p10 Also, recent discovery of a 5th-century copper coin in Banavasi, ancient capital of the Kadambas, with Kannada script inscription on it, further proves the usage of Kannada at an official level.  Middle Kingdoms (230 BCE – 1206 CE)  One of the Badami cave temples, built by the Chalukya dynasty. They were followed by large imperial empires, the Badami Chalukyas, Rashtrakuta Dynasty and Western Chalukya Empire, who had their regal capitals in modern Karnataka region and patronized Kannada language and literature.Considerable number of their records are in Kannada (Kamath 2001, p67, p73, pp88-89, p114)7th century Badami Chalukya inscriptions call Kannada the natural language (Thapar 2003, p345)Altekar (1934), pp411–413Even royalty of the Rashtrakuta empire took part in poetic and literary activities (Thapar 2003, p334)Narasimhacharya (1988), p68, p17–21Reu (1933), pp37–38More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to the Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI than to any other king prior to the 12th century, = Badami Chalukyas = The Badami Chalukyas ruled between the 6th and the 8th centuries. = Rashtrakutas = The Rashtrakutas were originally vassals of the Badami Chalukyas. Dantidurga overthrew the Chalukya ruler Kirtivarman II in 735 CE, and established the rule of the Rashtrakuta dynasty. During this period, important contributions were made in the field of literature, arts, and mathematics. Amoghavarsha I, the most famous king of this dynasty wrote Kavirajamarga, a landmark literary work in the Kannada language. Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya. = Western Chalukyas = The Western Chalukyas ruled between 973 and 1189 CE. = Western Gangas = The Western Ganga dynasty was founded around 350 CE, ruling southern Karnataka. Their sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, after which they ruled as vassals of the Badami Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and Western Chalukyas. Their rule came to an end after the disintegration of the Western Chalukyas in 1000 CE. The Gommateshwara statue at Shravanbelagola was built during the 10th century CE by the Western Ganga Kingdom. Though a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage toward Jainism resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished. = Hoysala Empire = Elaborately carved outer walls at the Hoysaleswara Temple built in the 12th century by the Hoysala Empire. Natives of the malnad Karnataka, the Hoysalas established the Hoysala Empire at the turn of the first millennium. Art and architecture flourished in the region during this time resulting in distinctive Kannada literary metres and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture.Kamath (2001), pp132–134Sastri (1955), p359, p361Foekema (1996), p14Kamath (2001), p124 The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought large parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under their rule.The Tamil city of Kannanur Kuppam near Srirangam became the second capital of the Hoysalas during the rule of Vira Narasimha II. During the time of Veera Ballala III, Tiruvannamalai in Tamil Nadu had been made an alternate capital. The Hoysalas were arbiters of South Indian politics and took up the leadership role (B.S.K. Iyengar in Kamath (2001), p126Keay (2000), p252Sastri (1955), p195The Hoysalas dominated of Southern Deccan as a single empire, (Thapar 2003, p368 = Other Kingdoms = The Seuna dynasty, Kadamba dynasty, and Chola Empire ruled parts of Karnataka.A Brief History of India by Alain Daniélou p.177  Late Medieval and Early Modern period (1206–1799 CE)  = Vijayanagara Empire = In the early 14th century, the Vijayanagara Empire with its capital at Hosapattana (later to be called Vijayanagara) rose to successfully challenge the Muslim invasions into the South. This empire was established by Harihara I and Bukka Raya who many historians claim were commanders of the last Hoysala King Veera Ballala III and the empire prospered for over two centuries.P. B. Desai (History of Vijayanagar Empire, 1936), Henry Heras (The Aravidu Dynasty of Vijayanagara, 1927), B.A. Saletore (Social and Political Life in the Vijayanagara Empire, 1930), G.S. Gai (Archaeological Survey of India), William Coelho (The Hoysala Vamsa, 1955) and Kamath ( Kamath 2001, pp157-160)Karmarkar 1947, p30 The Vijayanagara rulers patronized culture, and a distinct form of literature and architecture evolved during this period. The best example of Vijayanagara architecture is seen in the ruined city of Hampi. Battle of Talikota The main rival of the Vijayanagara empire were the five Deccan Sultanates, who defeated the empire in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota. Two generals of the Vijayanagara army switched sides and turned their loyalty to the united Sultanates. They captured Aliya Rama Raya and beheaded him on the spot. The beheading of Rama Raya created confusion and havoc and in the still loyal portions of the Vijayanagara army, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army plundered Hampi and reduced it into ruins. = Bahmani and Deccan Sultanates = left The Bahmani sultans of Bidar were the main competitors to the Vijayanagara empire for hegemony over the DeccanKamath (2001), pp190-191 and after their fall, the Bijapur Sultanate and Bidar Sultanate took their place in the dynastic struggle for control of the southern India.Kamath (2001), p200 A Bidriware water-pipe. Bidriware was developed in Bidar in the 14th century C.E. during the rule of the Bahmani Sultanate. After the defeat and disintegration of the Vijayanagara Empire in battle at Talikota in 1565 to a confederacy of Sultanates, the Bijapur Sultanate rose as the main power in the Deccan before their defeat to the Mughal Empire in late 17th century.Kamath (2001), p201Kamath (2001), p202 Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb gave the order to besiege Bijapur and after a 15-month long siege, the Mughal army emerged victorious and the Adil Shahi dynasty came to an end. The Bahmani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo Islamic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this contribution.Kamath (2001), p207 Bidriware and Deccan painting developed during this period. The Madrasa Mahmud Gawan was a university built during the reign of the Bahmani Sultanate, one of the few centers of higher learning in medieval India. Parts of Karnataka were conquered by Marathas, earlier under Chhatrapati Shivaji and later on after the War of 27 years. = Anglo-Mysore Wars = Lord Cornwallis receiving Tipu Sultan's sons as hostages after the third Anglo-Mysore War, by Robert Home, c. 1793 CE. The Wodeyars of Mysore, former vassals of the Vijayanagara Empire, leased the state from the Mughal king Aurangzeb in the 17th century. With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, Haider Ali, the Commander-in-Chief of the Mysore Army, assumed control over the region, until the rule of the kingdom was passed to Tipu Sultan, after Haider Ali's death. In attempting to contain European expansion in South India, Tipu Sultan, known as the Tiger of Mysore fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars, the last of which resulted in his death and the incorporation of Mysore into the British Raj. = Company rule = Following Tipu's fall, a part of the kingdom of Mysore was annexed and divided between the Madras Presidency and the Nizam. The remaining territory was transformed into a Princely State; the five-year-old scion of the Wodeyar family, Krishnaraja III, was installed on the throne with chief minister (Diwan) Purnaiah. The Mysore State and Hyderabad State, which ruled most of Karnataka, were allied with the British during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. British Colonial period (1799-1947 CE) People waiting for famine relief in Bangalore. From the Illustrated London News. (20 October 1877) = Mysore State = Mysore Palace, completed in 1912, was the residence of the Wadiyar dynasty which ruled the Kingdom of Mysore. During this time, railways and airways, as well as modern universities were introduced in Karnataka. The Indian Institute of Science (1909) and University of Mysore (1916) were the first educational institutions established in Karnataka. = Independence Movement = However the British period was also a time of racial discrimination, economic exploitation and numerous preventable famines. By the late 19th century, the independence movement had gained momentum; Aluru Venkata Raya, S. Nijalingappa, Kengal Hanumanthaiah, Nittoor Srinivasa Rau and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century.  Post- Independence (1947 CE - present)  Territories before unification = Unification of Karnataka = After Indian independence, the Wodeyar Maharaja acceded to India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state, and the former Maharaja became its rajpramukh, or governor, until 1975. The Ekikarana movement which started in the later half of the 20th century, culminated in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 which provided for parts of Coorg, Madras, Hyderabad, and Bombay states to be incorporated into the state of Mysore. Mysore state was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The state of Mysore was formed on 1 November 1956 and since then 1 November of every year is celebrated as Kannada Rajyotsava / Karnataka Rajyotsava. = Post-Unification = The 1957 elections saw the Indian National Congress win 150 seats out of 208, and S. Nijalingappa was retained as Chief Minister. Mysore state was renamed Karnataka in 1973. The Congress would retain power in Karnataka until 1983, when the Janata Party formed the first non-Congress government in Karnataka with the support of other smaller parties. Subsequent elections have seen power switch between the Congress, Bharatiya Janata Party, and other parties. Timeline References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography= * Dr. Suryanath U.

Prison nurseries are not common in correctional facilities in the United States, although prior to the 1950s many states had them and they are widespread throughout the rest of the world. Nurseries inside the United States Most prison nurseries in the United States are only open to mothers who give birth to their children while they are serving their sentence; in most states, women who give birth prior to their incarceration are not eligible, though New York is an exception. Housing an infant in a prison nursery costs approximately $24,000 per year. However, the cost can be reduced through partnerships between prisons and local nonprofits, volunteer efforts, or government grants. As of May 2013, nine states have prison nurseries in the United States: New York, Nebraska, Washington, Ohio, Indiana, South Dakota, Illinois, West Virginia, and Wyoming. Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women, a maximum security women's prison in New York, has the oldest prison nursery in the United States. The prison nursery opened in 1901. A child is permitted to stay at Bedford Hills with its mother until 1 year of age; however, there are possible exceptions if the mother's release date is within the next 6 months. Mothers at Bedford Hills must also participate in parental classes taught by qualified inmates. The prison also provides vocational services for mothers, in addition to providing comprehensive visiting services for the older children of incarcerated mothers including daily visiting hours and a special children's visiting room. In 1994 the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women opened their prison nursery. An infant is allowed to reside with the mother in prison if the mother's release date is before the child turns 18 months. Childbirth and parenting classes are mandatory before and after the birth of an incarcerated inmate's child. The nursery at Washington Corrections Center for Women, which opened in 1999, offers inmates with a sentence less than 3 years after her child is born the opportunity to keep her child with her in the nursery until the child is 18 months old. At this point the mother and child move to a pre-release center for the next 18 months. The prison nursery has a partnership with the Early Head Start program, which provides developmental screenings, childcare, activities for the children, healthy food, and family services. The Mothers at the Washington Corrections Center for Women can choose to have a caregiver who looks after the infant while the mother is at work. The Ohio Reformatory for Women nursery opened in April 2001. It can hold up to 20 inmates and their infants up to 18 months old. Every mother has a nanny who, like the mother, is an inmate who has taken parental classes and is serving time for a non-violent offense. The nanny is a volunteer inmate who is available at any time to care for a mother's child when the mother has made a prior commitment. Preungesheim Preungesheim, a maximum-security women's prison in Frankfurt, Germany, has one of the best-known programs for incarcerated mothers and their children. Mothers who are on high-security and must stay on prison grounds are able to keep their children until they are around 3 years old. They live in a \\"closed mother-child house\\" that is a separate enclosed building on the prison grounds. During the day, children attend preschool while their mothers are at work. Those mothers who are not a high-security risk live in an “open mother- child house” with their children. An open mother-child house opens to the nearby neighborhood, instead of opening to the prison - distinctly setting an open mother-child house apart from a closed mother-child house. Children are allowed to play in the nearby playground during the day while their mothers are at work. If a mother is permitted work release, and has a school-aged child living in Frankfurt, she spends the day at home taking care of her family but sleeps at the prison at night. A work-release mother is allowed to take her children to school and doctor appointments and grocery shop during the day. After she prepares dinner, she tucks her child into bed and departs back to the prison to sleep, leaving her child in the hands of a caretaker. Medical care for pregnant inmates Pregnant inmates, along with every other inmate, are required to receive proper mental and physical (medical) care while incarcerated. In 2001, the Plata vs. Schwarzenegger case stated that California prisons were violating prisoners’ Eighth Amendment rights to adequate physical and mental care and treatment. As a result, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) was required to adopt different policies, including those concerning pregnant inmates. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's Adult Institutions, Programs, and Parole Operations manual Chapter 5 Article 45: Care, Treatment, and Security of Pregnant Offenders clearly states the policies implemented for the pregnant inmates within their facilities and institutions. Their policy listed in the manual is as follows: The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) staff shall ensure a pregnant offender is not placed in restraints by the wrists, ankles, or both during labor, including during transport, delivery, and while in recovery after giving birth, except as provided in Penal Code Section 5007.7. Health care staff shall provide medical care for the pregnant offender population. Pregnant offenders shall receive, within the second trimester of gestation, a dental examination, periodontal evaluation, and the necessary periodontal treatment in order to maintain periodontal health during the gestation period. This policy will ensure the safety of the inmate and her unborn child. It will also ensure that the inmate receives proper medical care. According to the manual, pregnant inmates will visit their doctor or OB/GYN every 4 weeks in the first trimester and up to 24 – 26 weeks gestation, every 3 weeks up to 30 weeks gestation, every 2 weeks up to 36 weeks and, weekly after 36 weeks up to delivery. California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation’s Adult Institutions, Programs, and Parole Operations manual Chapter 5 Article 45: Care, Treatment, and Security of Pregnant Offenders Arguments in favor of prison nurseries The former prison in Christianshavn, Copenhagen, Denmark, demolished 1928. The states that have taken to incorporating prison nurseries within their correctional systems have done so on the basis of an assumption that this will facilitate development of maternal bond and secure attachment by the child. Prison officials believe that the first two years are a crucial time period for the mother and her infant. Most facilities allow the infant to reside with her mother until he/she is 18 months old, although Washington State will keep children in prison until they are three. Many prisons offer parenting classes, substance abuse counseling, general education, and \\"safe havens\\" for mothers and infants to be in.Warner, Jennifer. \\"Infants in Orange: An International Model-Based Approach to Prison Nurseries.\\" Hastings Women's Law Journal 26.1 (2015): 65-92. \\"Prison nurseries have the potential to promote rehabilitation of incarcerated mothers, while also providing the physical closeness and supportive environment necessary for the development of secure attachment between mothers and their infants.\\"Smith Goshin, Lorie, and Mary Woods Byrne. \\"Converging streams of opportunity for prison nursery programs in the United States.\\" Journal of Offender Rehabilitation 48.4 (2009): 271-295. Instead of the opportunity to connect with their mothers, babies are placed in \\"foster care\\" which is \\"the ultimate placement for 10% of infants born to women in prison across the nation.\\" Campbell, Julie, and Joseph R. Carlson. \\"Correctional administrators’ perceptions of prison nurseries.\\" Criminal Justice and Behavior 39.8 (2012): 1063-1074. For responses to the arguments in favor of prison nurseries, and for a children's-rights-based argument against prison nurseries, see James G. Dwyer, Jailing Black Babies, 2014 Utah L. Rev. 465 (2014), available at SSRN.com.  Effects on children who were in prison nurseries  \\"Thirty percent of children who co-resided in a prison nursery and 42% of separated children had at least one problem area in the clinical range.\\" Studies and evaluations of prison nursery programs Joseph R. Carlson conducted the most comprehensive evaluation to date of the effects of prison nurseries on mother recidivism. The evaluation focussed on women at the Nebraska Correctional Center for Facility for Women.Carlson, Joseph R. Evaluating the Effectiveness of a Live-in Nursery within a Women’s Prison. Journal of Offender Rehabilitation; 1998 and Prison Nursery 2000: A Five-year Review of the Prison Nursery at the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women. Journal of Offender Rehabilitation; 2001. The study compares the recidivism rate of 30 women who participated in a prison nursery program at the Nebraska Correctional Center for Women with the recidivism rate of women who gave birth while in custody and had their babies taken away immediately after birth (these women were incarcerated at the prison before the nursery had been created). The recidivism rate for program participants was 9 percent while the recidivism rate for mothers who were immediately separated from their children was 33 percent. This study, however, like others of its kind, suffers from severe selection bias, insofar as it fails to account for the screening out of more serious offenders from the nursery program. No study to date demonstrates that prison nurseries reduce recidivism. Mary Byrne, a Columbia University nursing professor is in the process of conducting a study of 100 children born at the prison nurseries at the Bedford Hills and Taconic Correctional Facilities in Westchester County, N.Y. in order to evaluate the impact that prison nurseries have on parent-child bonding, and healthy infant development. So far, Byrne has concluded that some children are able to form a secure attachment with their mothers when they are kept in prison with their mothers. However, most of the mothers separate from their children after release from prison,James G. Dwyer, Jailing Black Babies, 2014 Utah L. Rev. 465, 508 (2014) and Byrne notes that children who are separated from their initial caregivers have an increased likelihood of emotional and behavioral disorders, school failure and trouble with the law. Byrne did not study outcomes for children born to prison inmates who are immediately placed for adoption. As previously stated many countries around the world have prison nurseries where both a mother and her child reside. A study conducted in Iran investigated the relationship between mother and child in these environments. The participants of the study consisted of 14 imprisoned mothers with their children. An interview was conducted of prisoners after they left the prison nursery. The results of the study found the presence of the child created an emotional support system for prisoners. It helped prisoners deal with loneliness, anxiety, and fight depression. Mothers reported having a positive outlook for their future. They began to become hopeful to reenter society as contributing members. Mothers reported wanting to find jobs to secure their child's future. Past studies done about prison nurseries, has been found that mothers in prison nurseries had lower rates of recidivism. The mothers in the Iranian prison unit reported that parenting their child reminded them of being at home. Their daily lives consisted of their child-rearing practices. The presence of toys, noise, and interactions gave a sense of home life. The experiences of these prisoners differ from those of other units because they have members that can sympathize and support them with their experiences. There are many positives associated with keeping a mother with her child. A previous study conducted has found that mothers in prisons nurseries have the ability to form of a secure bond. The ability to have a secure attachment is important for a child's development. However, the Iranian study revealed some of the risks for a child in that environment. Even though the mothers had separated units, the yard and recess are shared with other prisoners. Participants of the study reported that children were cursed at and pushed during these times. The study also found children can have a lack of resources in prisons environment such as bedding, clothing, and food.

After fifteen years, advances in genetic analysis led to conviction of Jules Mikus (28 September 1958 – 6 December 2019) for the crime. He had been identified as a potential suspect early in the investigation, but had offered an alibi that was accepted at the time.  Murder and death  Teresa lived in Napier, New Zealand, with her mother, Kelly Piggot, and her younger sister Sara. Although reluctant to go to school on the day after her birthday, Cormack departed home on her normal walking route to Richmond Primary School, which was a short distance from where she lived. However, she did not go to school and instead wandered the streets in the suburb of Maraenui for around an hour. Eight days later, Cormack's body was discovered at the base of a tree on Whirinaki Beach by a woman walking her dog. An autopsy revealed that she had been raped and suffocated.  Investigation  Three male pubic hairs were found orally and in her underwear, and semen was found vaginally on Cormack's body. However, genetic fingerprinting at the time was not advanced enough to find her killer. Jules Mikus (born 28 September 1958), who committed many sex crimes as a teenager, was questioned by police and provided samples of his saliva and blood. Mikus provided an alibi for the time the abduction was believed to have occurred. Afterwards, he was excluded as a suspect.  Breakthrough  The Cormack murder case was re-opened in 1998 and new testing was done at a crime lab in the United States. Due to advances in genetic fingerprinting, a minute sample of semen stored sealed between two microscope slides was able to be profiled in 2001 by technicians at ESR (Environmental Science & Research, a Crown Research Institute owned wholly by the New Zealand government). Despite having this profile, an arrest was not immediate. A public television broadcast by the detective in charge and seen by Mikus provoked a reaction in front of the people with whom he lived but they did not contact police. Eight- hundred and forty-five blood samples had been taken, of these, four were of insufficient quality to make a profile. After nearly a year of testing the blood (taking until 22 February 2002), only one blood profile matched the semen and it came from Mikus. On 26 February 2002, fifteen years after Cormack's death, police arrested Mikus for the murder. Although Mikus pleaded not guilty, a jury found him guilty for kidnapping, rape, sexual assault and murder. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, preventative detention for rape, and 14 years each for the sexual assault and abduction, all served concurrently, with a minimum non-parole period of 10 years. Mikus died while serving a life sentence for the death of 6-year-old Teresa Cormack. It was reported he was dying from a brain tumour and died 9 December 2019.  Aftermath  The case attracted widespread interest in New Zealand. In 2004, Rowene Marsh-Potaka (who had campaigned to stop her brother from being paroled for murder) collaborated with Cormack's mother Kelly Piggot to write an anti- parole song. They wanted the song to let people know that offenders such as Mikus should serve their full sentences. Piggot also has a daughter named Sara. Paul Rothwell's play Golden Boys, which ran at Circa Theatre in early 2006, was inspired by the Cormack case.

From 1996 to 2000 Max was the staff photographer for The New Yorker, second after Richard Avedon and is the first Indian photographer to shoot covers for French and American Vogue. . Sting has described his photography as a sort of \\"On the move style\\". The National Geographic channel produced a feature documentary on Vadukul in 2000 about the improbable arc of his life after Africa; the documentary continues to air around South Asia today. Early life Vadukul was born 1961 to an Indian family in Nairobi, Kenya. His family moved to Northern London when he was a teenager. He did not complete high school, but developed an interest in photography after his father took a job at the Carl Zeiss lens company. At the age of 16, he ran away from home to escape an arranged marriage. Career Max Vadukul has long standing relationships with The New Yorker, French Vogue, Italian Vogue, L'Uomo Vogue, W Magazine, Interview, and Rolling Stone. He shoots regularly for T: The New York Times Style Magazine, Esquire, Vogue China, Egoiste, Town & Country, and others. His book, \\"MAX,\\" published in 2000 by Nicholas Callaway, came out the same year as Helmut Newton's \\"Sumo,\\" helping start the trend of oversized large-format photography books. Vadukul's first success came when Lord David Puttnam asked him to take photographs of his producers. In the 1980s and 90s he introduced a distinct blend of high-octane energy and offbeat spontaneity, through predominantly black-and-white images, into the traditionally commercial form of fashion photography. In the 1990s, as the second staff photographer in The New Yorker Magazine's history (following Richard Avedon), he emerged as one of the world's foremost portrait photographers, capturing hundreds of subjects ranging from Mother Theresa and Salman Rushdie to Mick Jagger and Mikail Baryshnikov. He describes his style as “art reportage,” which he calls the “taking of reality and turning into art.” Vadukul was discovered in 1984 by the Japanese designer Yohji Yamamoto, who assigned the then 22-year-old Vadukul one of his prestigious ad campaigns. It was the first of several Yamamoto campaigns for Vadukul and introduced the photography world to his dynamic movement-filled black-and-white images. Vadukul established his editorial career in the 1990s with a large body of work for French Vogue and Italian Vogue – much of which was produced with his wife, the eminent fashion editor Nicoletta Santoro, with whom he has collaborated regularly over the years. Recently, he shot two of W Magazine's annual \\"Art\\" issue covers - an overseas collaboration with the Chinese dissident artist, Ai Weiwei, and a collaboration with the artist George Condo and actress Jessica Chastain. In 1996 the producers of the Broadway musical \\"Chicago\\" asked Vadukul to create the new show's image; the dark, stylized black-and-white portraits he took remain the basis for the show's current campaigns. From 1996 to 2000 he held the post of The New Yorker’s staff photographer, shooting an average of 52 assignments a year. Other subjects included Al Gore, James Brown, Donald Trump, Natalie Portman, Tom Hanks, Roger Federer, Tilda Swinton, David Geffen, and a group portrait of 40 Nobel laureates. In 1997 he photographed almost the entirety of the magazine’s celebrated Indian Fiction issue. After his tenure at The New Yorker he followed its editor, Tina Brown, to become Photo Editor-At-Large of her Talk Magazine. Vadukul has a long history with music photography. As a lead photographer for Rolling Stone Magazine he took portraits of Amy Winehouse, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards, Bruce Springsteen, Lil Wayne, Kanye West, Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, the Beastie Boys, Florence Welch, and Metallica. He has also photographed several albums including the Rolling Stone's \\"Bridges to Babylon,\\" Beyonce's \\"B'Day,\\" and Paul McCartney's \\"Memory Almost Full.\\" His black-and-white style was utilized most directly, however, by Sting, who asked Vadukul to take the photos for his \\"Dream of the Blue Turtles\\" solo album, which was the artist's first after the Police. Vadukul has also photographed campaigns for Chloé, Comme des Garçons, Longchamp, Armani, Emanuel Ungaro, Sandro, and HBO's \\"Six Feet Under.\\" Last year, he photographed the campaign for the Broadway revival of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, featuring Neil Patrick Harris. He has lived in Paris and London and now resides in New York with his wife Nicoletta Santoro. He has two children. Exhibitions Max had his first US solo gallery show in 2011 at 212 Gallery in Aspen, Colorado titled, \\"Kinetic Force\\". In 2011 Max was featured in the group exhibition \\"Beyond Words: Photography in The New Yorker at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in New York, NY. He had a group show at The Wapping Project Bankside for \\"Yohji's Women\\" in London, England in 2011.

All GSID patients lack fully functional sucrase, while the isomaltase activity can vary from minimal functionality to almost normal activity. The presence of residual isomaltase activity may explain why some GSID patients are better able to tolerate starch in their diet than others with GSID. Signs and symptoms *Abdominal cramps and bloating *Diarrhea and constipation *Vomiting *Hypoglycemia and headaches *Poor weight gain and growth *Upper respiratory tract and viral diseases *Anxiety and heart palpitations *Excess gas production Cause Sucrose intolerance can be caused by genetic mutations in which both parents must contain this gene for the child to carry the disease (so-called primary sucrose intolerance). Sucrose intolerance can also be caused by irritable bowel syndrome, aging, or small intestine disease (secondary sucrose intolerance). There are specific tests used to help determine if a person has sucrose intolerance. The most accurate test is the enzyme activity determination, which is done by biopsying the small intestine. This test is a diagnostic for GSID. Other tests which can aid in the diagnosis of GSID but which are not truly diagnostic for the disease are the sucrose breath test, and a genetic test which tests for the absence of certain genes which are thought to be responsible for GSID. Sucrose (also called saccharose) is a disaccharide and is a two-sugar chain composed of glucose and fructose which are bonded together. A more familiar name is table, beet, or cane sugar. It was believed that most cases of sucrose intolerance were due to an autosomal recessive, genetic, metabolic disease. Based on new data patients with heterozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes can have symptom presentation as well. GSID involves deficiency in the enzyme sucrase-isomaltase, which breaks the bond between the glucose and fructose molecules. When disaccharides are consumed, they must be broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes in the intestines before they can be absorbed. Monosaccharides, or single sugar units, are absorbed directly into the blood. A deficiency of sucrase may result in malabsorption of sugar, which can lead to potentially serious symptoms. Since sucrase-isomaltase is involved in the digestion of starches, some GSID patients may not be able to absorb starches as well. It is important for those with sucrose intolerance to minimize sucrose consumption as much as possible. Dietary supplements or medications may be taken as a substitute for the missing enzyme or to introduce healthy bacteria into the immune system. Diagnosis  Chronic gastrointestinal symptoms that are fairly common but difficult to diagnose may be caused by congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID). CSID is an inherited condition characterized by a dysfunctional digestive enzyme. The purpose of the digestive enzyme, sucrase-isomaltase, is to break down the compound sugars sucrose (table sugar) and starch sugars so they will be small enough to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to CSID, a primary gastrointestinal disorder such as a gastrointestinal infection, celiac disease or Crohn’s disease, can transiently suppress the digestive function of sucrase-isomaltase, causing an acquired form of sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (SID). Once the underlying disorder is treated and resolved, the symptoms of SID usually go away. A deficiency or absence of sucrase-isomaltase function is likely to cause chronic gastrointestinal symptoms whenever a person eats food containing sucrose or starch sugars, which are very common in carbohydrates. In fact, the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme is responsible for the digestion of all foods containing sucrose and approximately 60% to 80% of all foods containing starch sugars. When sucrose or starch sugars are not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, they travel to the large intestine (colon) where two things happen: *The food draws in excess water by a process called osmosis, creating watery diarrhea. *The food is broken down by the normal bacteria that reside in the colon by a process called fermentation; byproducts of all fermentation include the production of excess gas and an acidic environment. The timing of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with CSID is distinctive. CSID symptoms are frequent, daily events; they are lifelong, and they are postprandial (occurring after eating food). These symptoms can range from mild to severe and include chronic, watery, acidic diarrhea; intestinal gas and bloating; nausea; and abdominal pain. Infants may not show symptoms of CSID until they begin to eat sucrose- and starch-containing foods such as juices, solid foods, and medications sweetened with sucrose. Chronic, watery diarrhea and failure to thrive are the most common symptoms in infants and toddlers. Other symptoms include abdominal distention, gassiness, colic, irritability, excoriated buttocks, severe diaper rash due to acidic diarrhea, indigestion, and vomiting. Adults with CSID are usually lean, with a low body-mass index and an aversion to eating carbohydrates and “sweets.” Because CSID is an inherited condition, patients with CSID often have close relatives who also experience chronic diarrhea. Determining the cause of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms may take a long time because the symptoms can be common to many gastrointestinal conditions. One diagnostic method, considered the gold standard for diagnosing CSID, measures the level of activity of four intestinal enzymes that digest compound sugars, also called disaccharides. The four disaccharides digested in the small intestine are lactose, sucrose, maltose, and isomaltose. This diagnostic method, called a disaccharidase assay, is conducted on tissue samples taken from the small intestine during an endoscopic procedure, also called an upper GI (gastrointestinal) examination. If the level of sucrase activity is below the level considered necessary for normal sucrase function, the patient will be diagnosed with CSID. Noninvasive diagnostic methods include two breath tests, which can be useful screening tools but are not specific enough for a confirmed diagnosis of CSID. The first of these is the hydrogen/methane breath test, which measures the amount of hydrogen and methane gases a person exhales after consuming sugary water. The exhaled breath is collected in sealed test tubes at 30-minute intervals over a three-hour period after drinking the sugary water. If a person has CSID and there are little or no working sucrase-isomaltase enzymes in the intestines, greater than normal levels of hydrogen and/or methane are generated and exhaled in the breath. However, there may be other reasons why the person is exhaling excess hydrogen and/or methane gas, such as an overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine, called small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). The second breath test is called the carbon-13 (13C) breath test. Carbon-13 is a stable isotope of carbon that occurs naturally in sucrose, making it possible to track a person’s ability to digest and absorb sucrose by measuring the amount of 13CO2 exhaled after drinking a sugar-water solution. In this breath test, the exhaled breath is collected in sealed test tubes at 30-minute intervals over a 90-minute period after drinking the sugar-water solution. If the cumulative amount of 13CO2 exhaled is below the normal level that occurs when sucrose is digested by sucrase, the person may have CSID and the person should undergo further examination by their doctor. The findings from a 13C-breath test are believed to be more definitive for CSID than the hydrogen/methane breath test although neither test is validated to provide, by themselves, a diagnosis for CSID. In both breath tests, the consumption of sugar may cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms in those who have CSID. For this reason, these breath tests should be conducted under the supervision of a healthcare professional. A relatively new, noninvasive test that shows promise is a genetic test for the gene SI, which codes for the enzyme sucrase- isomaltase. This test requires a swab of tissue from the inside of the cheek. So far, 37 aberrant variations of the SI gene have been found in patients who have been diagnosed with CSID. A positive genetic test for one or more of the 37 SI gene variations known to cause CSID can help confirm a diagnosis of CSID. However, a negative genetic test cannot rule out a diagnosis of CSID. There are more than 2,000 different variations of the SI gene, and many of these variations have not yet been investigated for their ability to cause CSID. Therefore, a negative genetic test only means that the person does not carry one of the 37 SI gene variations that are known to be associated with CSID, but they may have an SI gene variation that has not yet been identified as one that can cause CSID. While the breath tests and genetic test have not been validated to be diagnostic for CSID, they may become important tests that help in identifying patients with CSID. As with all diagnoses, a diagnosis of CSID depends on combining a doctor’s clinical findings with results from objective tests. A physical examination, medical history, and other secondary tests, such as stool pH test for acidic stool, can aid in the diagnosis of CSID. If it is clinically inappropriate or difficult to perform a biopsy or if a CSID diagnosis is in doubt, a physician may suggest a two-week therapeutic trial with an enzyme replacement. If the patient shows a reduction of symptoms it is considered diagnostic for CSID. Treatment  The two ways to manage the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with CSID are: *Diet modification that eliminates or restricts the consumption of foods containing sucrose (table sugar) or starch sugars *The use of enzyme replacement therapy to replace the action of the sucrase enzyme that is deficient. This medication requires a prescription from a doctor. =Diet modification= The level of ability to digest sucrose or starch sugars is unique to each person who is living with CSID and depends on many factors, including the following: * The individual level of function of the digestive enzyme sucrase-isomaltase * How well the other functions of the gastrointestinal tract are working * How much sucrose and starch sugars are consumed * If a person has any other health issues that may affect digestion For these reasons, a restriction diet needs to be specific for each patient who has CSID. Before making any changes to the diet, it is important for a patient to speak with a healthcare provider, especially if the patient is underweight or not gaining weight as would be expected. It is also advised that the patient work with a registered dietitian or nutritionist who can help identify the foods that can be tolerated and those that cannot be tolerated. A registered dietitian or nutritionist can also help the patient plan a diet that will meet the nutritional needs for normal growth and development. Vitamins, minerals, and additional supplements may be needed to meet all nutritional needs.

Early and family life Coalter was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia to Michael Coalter and his wife Elizabeth Moore. He worked on the family farm, and received some education at the private Liberty Hall Academy (which later evolved into Washington College and long after his death into Washington and Lee University). Coalter moved across the state to Williamsburg, where he became a tutor in the family of Judge St. George Tucker and worked without pay in exchange for legal education from Judge Tucker and George Wythe at the College of William and Mary, from which Coalter graduated in 1789. Coalter married four times. His first three wives were: Maria Rind (married 1790 in Williamsburg, died 1792), Margaret Davenport (married and died 1795 in Williamsburg) and Ann Frances Bland Tucker (daughter of St. George Tucker, born 1779, married 1802 and died 1813). His first two wives died in childbirth, and his only children came from his third marriage. His final wife was widow and heiress Hannah Jones Williamson, whom Coalter married in February 1822 and who survived him.Annals of Augusta County, Virginia, p. 382, note Career Upon graduation and admission to the Virginia bar, Coalter returned to the Shenandoah Valley and settled in Staunton, Virginia, where he began his legal practice. After serving as the Commonwealth's Attorney (prosecutor) for several years, Coalter was appointed to the General District court for Staunton in 1809. On May 11, 1811, the Virginia General Assembly elevated him to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia. In the 1820 U.S. Federal Census, his household consisted of two white persons and five slaves.1820 U.S. Federal Census for Staunton, Virginia Around 1821, Coalter moved his family to Richmond, Virginia. After marrying the widow and heiress Hannah Jones Williamson the following February, Coalter also operated and occasionally lived at \\"Chatham Manor\\" near Fredericksburg, Virginia, which his fourth wife actually inherited from her father William Jones after his death in 1845, years after Coalter's death. In the 1830 U.S. Federal Census, Coalter's household consisted of two white males (him and the overseer), six white females and 86 slaves.1830 U.S. Federal Census for Stafford, Virginia Death and legacy Coalter died in Richmond on February 2, 1838, and was buried at Chatham Manor, but his remains were later moved across the Rappahannock River to the cemetery of St. George's Church in Fredericksburg. findagrave.com no. 8281285 His and his last father-in-law's demise led to legal complications, as his widow Hannah Coalter wanted to free the slaves she inherited, which was not permitted at the time, although was permitted in a will, which she had drafted and redrafted by acclaimed lawyers before she died in 1857. Moreover, her father had remarried after her mother's death and lived on the other side of Fredericksburg at Ellwood Manor (which had been founded by her father and his brother) during his final years. Hannah had a very much younger half-sister Lucinda, who married one of the slaveholding Lacy brothers who operated Ellwood and wanted Chatham as well. Horace Lacy (on his wife's behalf) contested Hannah's will, and while he lost in the Fredericksburg Court, he won in the Virginia Supreme Court, and so owned about 249 slaves in 1860, just before the American Civil War. Hannah and her disabled daughter from a previous marriage would be buried at Ellwood Manor, and Chatham Manor would become a Union headquarters and later hospital, and its slaves freed during that war. Like the Lacy brothers, Coalter's grandsons (sons of his daughter Elizabeth Tucker Coalter Bryan who moved to Gloucester, Virginia) John Randolph Bryan (1841-1917), St. George Tucker Coalter Bryan (1843-1916) and Joseph Bryan (1845-1908) would become Confederate States Army officers in that war, but survive the conflict.

Double Solitaire / Simultaneous Solitaire, Pagat. Accessed 14 October 2020. It is mostly referred to as \\"Double Solitaire\\". It is sometimes called Double Klondike, which is also an alternate name used for the single-player solitaire game Gargantua. Games with more players (Triple Solitaire, Quadruple Solitaire, etc.) are also possible. As the name suggests, Double Klondike is a two-player game, and is played with two full packs of playing cards, minus the Jokers; for the purpose of Double Klondike, the cards should be of the same size, but each pack's cards should be distinguishable from the other packs in some way, such as a different font style on the cards' faces or different backing designs for each pack. How to play Seated facing one another, each player sets up a typical Klondike layout, with one difference: the two players share a communal foundation area in the space between the two layouts. The communal foundation will have eight potential stacks, two for each pair of suits from the two decks. Each person plays their own layout as per Klondike rules, but with three-turn and unlimited-pass options applying to both players. Foundations are started and built up by suit as usual, except that there are two potential stacks for each suit. Players may build up on any foundation stack of the correct suit, whether or not that player started the stack or which player's cards are in the stack. Players may need to move fast when starting a new stack in order to build on it; for example, if both players have a Two of Hearts available to play, one player who is about to begin a foundation stack with the Ace of Hearts would need to act quickly to place the Ace and then place his Two before the other player places her Two first. Thus, a foundation stack might have any combination of both players' cards. The game is over when both players have no legal moves left. The cards in the foundation stacks are then sorted according by deck of origin, and the number of cards from each deck are counted. The winner of the game is the player with the highest number of cards in the foundation stacks at the end of the game. A number of informal playing conditions are usually agreed for competitive play: #Players must hold the deck in one hand and use the other hand to make all moves, making it harder to add two consecutive cards to a foundation stack unchallenged. #Cards must be placed on to foundation stacks one at a time, and no 'throwing' of cards is permitted #If two or more players try to place a card on the same foundation stack then the first card to be so placed wins and losing players have to take their card back. #Players may not move partial stacks (so a sequence of red eight, black seven, red six can be moved onto a black nine, but the red six cannot be moved by itself onto another black seven).

When the boys trek downtown, they meet up with a horse that turns out to be Bertie reincarnated, much to Moe and Larry's surprise. The boys are ecstatic, and try to persuade their horsie sister to return home with them. At first, she resists, but eventually gives in. No sooner do the boys get Bertie home that they discover she is pregnant. Joe goes berserk and demands Moe and Larry prepare for the arrival of the newborn. In the interim, Bertie's heavy hoofs can be clearly heard by the landlord Mr. Dinklespiel (Benny Rubin) and his daughter (Harriette Tarler) living downstairs. Dinklespiel marches upstairs and demands that the Stooges come clean, but Moe tries to convince him that the sounds are nothing more than the trio. Once Dinklespiel leaves, Bertie gives birth to a baby colt. Joe is so taken by the moment, he happily declares \\"I'm an uncle, I'm an uncle!\\" Within seconds, Joe is awoken by Moe and Larry, who hear his cries of being an uncle. It turns out that the whole thing was a dream, and sister Bertie (Moe in drag) is alive and well and living with the Stooges. When Joe tells Bertie he had a dream that she was a horse, she takes offense, and promptly places a casserole on Joe's bald dome. Cast =Credited= * Moe Howard as Moe/Birdie ** Harold Breen as Moe (seen from back) * Larry Fine as Larry * Joe Besser as Joe * Harriette Tarler as Dinklespiel's daughter * Benny Rubin as Mr. Dinklespiel * Tony the Wonder Horse as Birdie (reincarnated) =Uncredited= *Ruth Godfrey White as Birdie (voice) * Joe Palma as drunk man Production notes Hoofs and Goofs was the first Three Stooges short featuring Joe Besser as the third Stooge; filming was completed April 18–20, 1956. According to Besser's autobiography Not Just a Stooge, Besser spoke to Moe shortly before filming to convey his condolences over the death of Shemp Howard the year before. Joe and Shemp had been good friends. The film's original ending was to have the Stooges' sister, Birdie, hit Joe with a rolling pin. However, due to his not wanting to be hit in the head with a solid prop, it was changed to a casserole. The film makes reference to actress Kim Novak, when spoken by the reincarnated Birdie.

Background He was bred in Kentucky by Fares Farms and originally owned by Prestonwood Farm as well as Wallstreet Racing Stables. Bought for $6,000 as a yearling at the Keeneland Sales, by Kevin Eikleberry and Clifford Thygesen. Da Hoss was then taken to Turf Paradise in Phoenix, Arizona. Racing career =1994-1996: Early career= Da Hoss had 3 wins in 3 starts at two years of age. In one start, he ran six furlongs in the record time of 1:07 1/5. At three, he took the Grade III 'Best Turn Stakes (now known as the Jimmy Winkfield Stakes), the Grade II Jersey Derby and the Grade II Del Mar Derby, and came second in the Grade II Gotham Stakes, Illinois Stakes, Swaps Stakes, and Pegasus Stakes. When he was four, he won the Grade I Breeders' Cup Mile under Gary Stevens, the Grade I Fourstardave Handicap, and the Pennsylvania Governor's Cup Handicap. After Da Hoss won the 1996 Mile by one and a half lengths, he was out of racing for almost two years: 1997 and 1998. =1998: Comeback= Da Hoss had only one prep race for the 1998 Mile and that was an allowance event, which he easily won. Dickinson then entered him in the 1998 Breeder's Cup Mile. He wanted Gary Stevens to ride Da Hoss, but the jockey's agent had committed him to another horse. John Velazquez ultimately took the mount. Da Hoss settled comfortably in the early stages of the race and took the lead at the top of the stretch. He was challenged in the stretch by Hawksley Hill, who took over the lead by a nose nearing the finish. Da Hoss gained back the ground lost and put his nose back in front at the wire to take his second Breeders' Cup by the narrowest of margins. Announcer Tom Durkin yelled, \\"Oh, my, this is the greatest comeback since Lazarus! He's had one race in two years.\\" The 1998 Mile was Da Hoss' final race. In his twenty starts, he won 12 races, placed in 5 others, and came home third twice. His career earnings amounted to $1,931,558. Until Ouija Board took her second non-consecutive Breeders' Cup win in 2006, Da Hoss was one of only six horses to ever win two Breeders' Cup races and the only one to win in non-consecutive years. Retirement Da Hoss in December 2018.

The descent southwestwards from this point back down to the upstream meadows is noticeably steeper, although the down gradient is less marked on its southerly and easterly progress through the park itself. Richmond Hill is also the name of the road (now classed as the B321) that runs from Richmond town centre to the top of the hill, and is one-way up the hill along its northern part. Richmond Hill, as a name, is an unitentional pleonasm where “-mond” (mound) and hill means practically the same thing. The origin as a description of a place in France (through an intermediary of a person from the place then Richmond, North Yorkshire) has lost its use as a description to become a general place name. It just so happens that another hill ended-up adopting its name. This renowned hill offers the only view in England to be protected by an Act of Parliament—the Richmond, Ham and Petersham Open Spaces Act passed in 1902—to protect the land on and below Richmond Hill and thus preserve the fine foreground views to the west and south. Immortalised in paintings by Sir Joshua Reynolds and J. M. W. Turner, it was described by Sir Walter Scott as \\"an unrivalled landscape\\". It was this view that inspired the name of Richmond, Virginia, after colonial city founder William Byrd II noticed a curve in the James River that remarkably resembled this meander of Thames. The scenic panorama may be viewed from Terrace Walk, laid out near the top of the hill in the 18th century. This promenade surmounts the Terrace Gardens and both are Grade II* listed in Historic England's Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. A small corner of the Terrace Gardens Royal Star and Garter Home for disabled ex-servicemen on top of the hill Richmond Hill (Sunset) As the town of Richmond developed from its founding in the early 16th century, after Henry VII had established Richmond Palace, the attributes of the hill naturally attracted desirable residential and commercial development – with the result that many substantial properties came and went on the hill over the centuries, some of them with famous or notable persons as owners or occupiers. That situation is still in vogue today. The original homes on Richmond Hill were built in what is now The Vineyard, including Clarence House, Halford House, Michel's Almshouses and Vineyard House.

Its members included Britain, France, the Dutch Republic and Austria. By signing, Spain joined the Alliance, ending the War of the Quadruple Alliance and accepting the terms of the Treaty of London. As previously agreed at Utrecht in 1713, Philip V confirmed his renunciation of the French throne and Spanish claims to their former Italian possessions. In exchange, Emperor Charles VI renounced his claim on the Spanish throne and four year old Charles of Spain was recognised as heir to the Duchies of Parma and Tuscany. In another clause, Savoy and Austria exchanged Sicily for Sardinia. Background Spanish Chief Minister Cardinal Giulio Alberoni The central principle of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht ending the 1701 to 1714 War of the Spanish Succession was neither France or Austria could be united with Spain. In return, Philip V, grandson of Louis XIV, was confirmed as the first Bourbon king of Spain. He ceded Naples, Sicily, Milan and the Southern Netherlands to Austria, and Sardinia to Savoy, while Britain retained Gibraltar and Menorca. Philip viewed regaining these as vital to his prestige and this became the key foreign policy objective for Spain's new Chief Minister, Cardinal Giulio Alberoni. A native of Parma, Alberoni arranged the 1714 marriage between Philip and Elisabeth Farnese, niece of the Duke of Parma. She also supported this policy; Philip had two sons from his first marriage next in line to the Spanish throne and she wanted to create an Italian inheritance for her own children. When Louis XIV died in 1715, his five year old great-grandson became Louis XV; if he died, the closest legitimate heir was his uncle, Philip of Spain, casting doubt on the renunciation made at Utrecht. Emperor Charles VI, Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne until becoming Holy Roman Emperor in 1711, also refused to formally renounce his claim. The Duke of Orléans, who served as Regent during Louis XV's minority, needed peace to rebuild the economy, which meant ensuring compliance with Utrecht; since this required British support, it led to the 1716 Anglo-French alliance. French Foreign Minister Abbe Guillaume Dubois, who agreed the terms of the Treaty with Earl Stanhope Austria had delayed implementation of the Dutch Barrier, an objective for which the Dutch Republic effectively bankrupted themselves. In January 1717, they joined France and Britain in the 1717 Triple Alliance, which reiterated the provisions of Utrecht and agreed Savoy and Austria would exchange Sicily and Sardinia. Alberoni calculated neither Britain or France would fight for these and with Austria involved in the 1716-1718 Austro-Turkish War, Spain occupied Sardinia unopposed in 1717. In early 1718, he began preparing for an attack on Sicily; unlike Sardinia, this was considered vital for British trade and in June, a naval force under Admiral Byng arrived in the Western Mediterranean as a deterrent. To prevent an escalation, British chief minister Earl Stanhope and Guillaume Dubois, French Foreign Minister, offered Philip the Italian duchies of Parma and Tuscany. However, he rejected this and Spanish forces landed on Sicily in early July; in response, Britain and France agreed the Treaty of London on 18 July, setting out their terms for ending these disputes and inviting Austria, Spain and Savoy to join. After signing the Treaty of Passarowitz with the Ottoman Empire on 22 July, Austria joined the Alliance on 2 August. Although Byng's squadron destroyed the Spanish fleet at the Battle of Cape Passaro on 11 August, Philip still hoped to negotiate control of Sicily. This was due to tensions within the Alliance; anxious to protect their Spanish trade, the Dutch Republic refused to join the war while many French statesmen preferred an alliance with Philip, rather than Britain. This was strengthened by Spain granting trade privileges to French merchants and chartering French ships to resupply their forces in Sicily. However, the discovery in December 1718 of a Spanish-backed conspiracy to replace Orléans as Regent allowed him to position his response as an attack on Alberoni, not Philip, and France declared war on 2 January 1719. Austrian forces in Sicily had mixed success but without control of the sea, Spanish defeat was inevitable. An attempt to divert British resources with the 1719 Jacobite Rising failed, while the Capture of Vigo in October showed how vulnerable the Spanish coastline was to the Royal Navy. Philip dismissed Alberoni in December 1719 and agreed to end the war. Terms There was minimal discussion of terms; by joining the Quadruple Alliance on 17 February 1720, Spain confirmed acceptance of the terms agreed by France and Britain in 1718. These included confirmation neither France or Austria could be united with Spain, agreed Savoy and Austria would exchange Sicily and Sardinia and made Philip's third son Charles of Spain heir to Parma, Piacenza and Tuscany. Aftermath The treaty failed to end concerns over attempts to alter the Utrecht settlement, illustrated by the 1721 Treaty of Madrid, a mutual defence agreement between France, Spain and Britain. The British monarch, George I, agreed to raise the question of returning Gibraltar in Parliament 'at a favourable opportunity', which the Spanish viewed as a commitment to return it. Commercial tensions between the two countries and frustration at the lack of progress would lead to a new Anglo-Spanish War in 1727.

It was established in 1979 and granted its first franchise in 1980. Its popularity peaked in the 1980s and 1990s, when most shopping malls in Canada had a Marvellous Mmmuffin shop. By 2019, the chain had only two stores, one in the Scotia Plaza food court in Toronto and the other in the Montreal suburb of Côte-Saint-Luc. The Toronto location was reported to have closed in 2020. Background In 1957, Lou Bregman opened a Bagel King on Eglinton Avenue in Toronto, Ontario, after gaining experience working with his father making bagels. In the 1960s, he opened another Bagel King store at Yorkdale Mall; on weekends, his son Michael served customers at the counter. By the 1970s, Loblaws sold Bagel King bagels, and in 1977 the company's president Dave Nichol hired Michael, who had completed a Master of Business Administration (MBA) at Harvard University, as his assistant. Bregman was tasked with improving the company's bakery department, and eventually found a bakery in Hamilton that made unusually large muffins, typically triple the size of muffins of the time and including different grains and other ingredients. A test run in 1979 at two Loblaws locations proved successful, and by the end of the week the order was increased 16-fold. This success led Bregman to consider creating an independent muffin shop. During the subsequent six months, he developed the concept for this shop and a bakery called Michel’s Baguette. History Bregman and his wife Barbara developed new muffin recipes while his father modified standard muffin recipes, resulting in five basic recipes: bran, carrot, chocolate fudge, cornbread, and a standard white base. The first store was opened at the Toronto Eaton Centre in December 1979, and the first franchise store was established on Eglinton Avenue in 1980. With a Canadian mall construction boom in the early 1980s, Bregman acquired leases in many of them, establishing a national chain that at its peak had about 130 stores. mmmuffins was distinctive for displaying its baking carts to customers to verify their product's freshness, a retail strategy that was \\"ahead of the curve\\". In 1988, Bregman bought Second Cup, as he saw the emerging trend in espresso and specialty coffee. He sold mmmuffins and Michel’s Baguette in the early 1990s. The company was purchased by Timothy's World Coffee in 2002, which continued to operate the mmmuffins stores with their original trade name. On November 13, 2009, mmmuffins was sold to Bruegger's Enterprises, Inc. along with Timothy's Coffee and Michel's Baguette through a wholly owned subsidiary called ThreeCaf Brands Canada Inc. Bruegger's continued operations of these chains. In April 2018, Groupe Le Duff subsidiary Threecaf Brands sold Timothy's World Coffee and mmmuffins to Canadian company MTY Food Group of Richmond Hill, Ontario, for $1.7 million, of which $1.2 million was in cash, $0.2 million in assumed liabilities, and $0.3 million as a holdback. This included 30 Timothy's franchises in Canada and two in the United States, seven corporate Timothy's locations in Canada, and the remaining four mmmuffins stores. Chief operating officer of the MTY Food Group quick service restaurant division Jason Brading has stated that once the leases on the two remaining stores expire, the stores will be converted to other brands, but that the mmmuffins products may be incorporated into other cafe properties owned by MTY.

The term \\"hydrothermal\\" is of geologic origin.The earliest occurrence of the word \\"hydrothermal\\" appears to be: Sir Charles Lyell, A Manual of Elementary Geology … , 5th ed. (Boston, Massachusetts: Little, Brown, and Company, 1855), page 603: \\"The metamorphic theory [requires us to affirm] that an action, existing in the interior of the earth at an unknown depth, whether thermal, hydro-thermal, … \\" Geochemists and mineralogists have studied hydrothermal phase equilibria since the beginning of the twentieth century. George W. Morey at the Carnegie Institution and later, Percy W. Bridgman at Harvard University did much of the work to lay the foundations necessary to containment of reactive media in the temperature and pressure range where most of the hydrothermal work is conducted. Hydrothermal synthesis can be defined as a method of synthesis of single crystals that depends on the solubility of minerals in hot water under high pressure. The crystal growth is performed in an apparatus consisting of a steel pressure vessel called an autoclave, in which a nutrient is supplied along with water. A temperature gradient is maintained between the opposite ends of the growth chamber. At the hotter end the nutrient solute dissolves, while at the cooler end it is deposited on a seed crystal, growing the desired crystal. Advantages of the hydrothermal method over other types of crystal growth include the ability to create crystalline phases which are not stable at the melting point. Also, materials which have a high vapour pressure near their melting points can be grown by the hydrothermal method. The method is also particularly suitable for the growth of large good-quality crystals while maintaining control over their composition. Disadvantages of the method include the need of expensive autoclaves, and the impossibility of observing the crystal as it grows if a steel tube is used. There are autoclaves made out of thick walled glass, which can be used up to 300 °C and 10 bar.Schubert, Ulrich. and Hüsing, Nicola. (2012) Synthesis of inorganic materials Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, page 161 History Synthetic quartz crystals produced in the autoclave shown in Western Electrics pilot hydrothermal quartz plant in 1959. The first report of the hydrothermal growth of crystalsFor a more detailed history of hydrothermal synthesis, see: K. Byrappa and Masahiro Yoshimura, Handbook of Hydrothermal Technology (Norwich, New York: Noyes Publications, 2001), Chapter 2: History of Hydrothermal Technology. was by German geologist Karl Emil von Schafhäutl (1803–1890) in 1845: he grew microscopic quartz crystals in a pressure cooker.Schafhäutl (1845) \\"Die neuesten geologischen Hypothesen und ihr Verhältniß zur Naturwissenschaft überhaupt\\" (The latest geological hypotheses and their relation to science in general), Gelehrte Anzeigen (published by: die königliche Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften (the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences)), 20 : 557, 561-567, 569-576, 577-596. On page 578, he states: \\"5) Bildeten sich aus Wasser, in welchen ich im Papinianischen Topfe frisch gefällte Kieselsäure aufgelöst hatte, beym Verdampfen schon nach 8 Tagen Krystalle, die zwar mikroscopisch, aber sehr wohl erkenntlich aus sechseitigen Prismen mit derselben gewöhnlichen Pyramide bestanden.\\" ( 5) There formed from water in which I had dissolved freshly precipitated silicic acid in a Papin pot [i.e., pressure cooker], after just 8 days of evaporating, crystals, which albeit were microscopic but consisted of very easily recognizable six-sided prisms with their usual pyramids.) In 1848, Robert Bunsen reported growing crystals of barium and strontium carbonate at 200 °C and at pressures of 15 atmospheres, using sealed glass tubes and aqueous ammonium chloride (\\"Salmiak\\") as a solvent.R. Bunsen (1848) \\"Bemerkungen zu einigen Einwürfen gegen mehrere Ansichten über die chemisch- geologischen Erscheinungen in Island\\" (Comments on some objections to several views on chemical-geological phenomena in Iceland), Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie, 65 : 70-85. On page 83, Bunsen mentions crystallizing the carbonate salts of barium, strontium, etc. (\\"die kohlensauren Salze der Baryterde, Strontianerde, etc.\\"). In 1849 and 1851, French crystallographer Henri Hureau de Sénarmont (1808–1862) produced crystals of various minerals via hydrothermal synthesis.See: * de Sénarmont (1849) \\"Expériences sur la formation artificielle par voie humide de quelques espèces minérales qui ont pu se former dans les sources thermales sous l'action combinée de la chaleur et de la pression\\" (Experiments on the artificial formation from solution of some mineral species that could form in hot springs under the combined action of heat and pressure), Comptes rendus … , 28 : 693-696 . * H. de Sénarmont (1851) \\"Note sur la formation artificielle, par voie humide, du corindon et du diaspore\\" (Note on the artificial formation, from solution, of corundum and diaspore), Comptes rendus … , 32 : 762-763. Later (1905) Giorgio Spezia (1842–1911) published reports on the growth of macroscopic crystals.Giorgio Spezia (1905) \\"La pressione è chimicamente inattiva nella solubilità e ricostituzione del quarzo\\" (Pressure is chemically inactive in the solubility and reconstitution of quartz), Atti della Reale Accademia delle scienze di Torino (Proceedings of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Turin), 40 : 254-262. He used solutions of sodium silicate, natural crystals as seeds and supply, and a silver-lined vessel. By heating the supply end of his vessel to 320–350 °C, and the other end to 165–180 °C, he obtained about 15 mm of new growth over a 200-day period. Unlike modern practice, the hotter part of the vessel was at the top. A shortage in the electronics industry of natural quartz crystals from Brazil during World War 2 led to postwar development of a commercial-scale hydrothermal process for culturing quartz crystals, by A. C. Walker and Ernie Buehler in 1950 at Bell Laboratories. Other notable contributions have been made by Nacken (1946), Hale (1948), Brown (1951), and Kohman (1955). Uses A large number of compounds belonging to practically all classes have been synthesized under hydrothermal conditions: elements, simple and complex oxides, tungstates, molybdates, carbonates, silicates, germanates etc. Hydrothermal synthesis is commonly used to grow synthetic quartz, gems and other single crystals with commercial value. Some of the crystals that have been efficiently grown are emeralds, rubies, quartz, alexandrite and others. The method has proved to be extremely efficient both in the search for new compounds with specific physical properties and in the systematic physicochemical investigation of intricate multicomponent systems at elevated temperatures and pressures. Equipment for hydrothermal crystal growth The crystallization vessels used are autoclaves. These are usually thick-walled steel cylinders with a hermetic seal which must withstand high temperatures and pressures for prolonged periods of time. Furthermore, the autoclave material must be inert with respect to the solvent. The closure is the most important element of the autoclave. Many designs have been developed for seals, the most famous being the Bridgman seal. In most cases, steel- corroding solutions are used in hydrothermal experiments. To prevent corrosion of the internal cavity of the autoclave, protective inserts are generally used. These may have the same shape as the autoclave and fit in the internal cavity (contact-type insert), or be \\"floating\\" type inserts which occupy only part of the autoclave interior. Inserts may be made of carbon-free iron, copper, silver, gold, platinum, titanium, glass (or quartz), or Teflon, depending on the temperature and solution used. Methods =Temperature- difference method= This is the most extensively used method in hydrothermal synthesis and crystal growing. Supersaturation is achieved by reducing the temperature in the crystal growth zone. The nutrient is placed in the lower part of the autoclave filled with a specific amount of solvent. The autoclave is heated in order to create two temperature zones. The nutrient dissolves in the hotter zone and the saturated aqueous solution in the lower part is transported to the upper part by convective motion of the solution. The cooler and denser solution in the upper part of the autoclave descends while the counterflow of solution ascends. The solution becomes supersaturated in the upper part as the result of the reduction in temperature and crystallization sets in. =Temperature-reduction technique= In this technique crystallization takes place without a temperature gradient between the growth and dissolution zones. The supersaturation is achieved by a gradual reduction in temperature of the solution in the autoclave. The disadvantage of this technique is the difficulty in controlling the growth process and introducing seed crystals. For these reasons, this technique is very seldom used. =Metastable-phase technique= This technique is based on the difference in solubility between the phase to be grown and that serving as the starting material. The nutrient consists of compounds that are thermodynamically unstable under the growth conditions. The solubility of the metastable phase exceeds that of the stable phase, and the latter crystallize due to the dissolution of the metastable phase. This technique is usually combined with one of the other two techniques above.

Her life is complicated by the fact that her husband Richard, her business partner's brother, played by Christian Solimeno, has low fertility and cannot give her the baby she wants. She is all for asking his brother (her business partner) to be a sperm donor, which does not sit well with his wife (Kate Isitt).

It is the \\"sister\\" station to local FM station, Marcher Sound, launched by Marcher Radio Group in 1989. After a period of sales and takeovers which led to Gold being operated by a separate company to its FM sister station, both are now owned by Global Radio. It is broadcast from Mold Road, Gwersyllt, Wrexham, although most programming comes from London. Gold North Wales and Cheshire was replaced by Smooth Radio in March 2014. History The station launched in 1989 when new radio regulations prevented the simulcasting of independent local radio stations on AM radio bands, and therefore Marcher Radio Group created MFM 103.4 on FM, while the 1260 AM frequency became Marcher Gold. Both frequencies previously simulcast Marcher Sound. Marcher Radio Group was purchased by GWR Group in 2000, which also included the sale of Marcher Gold. However, after regulations on how many stations one company could own, Marcher Gold became part of the Classic Gold radio network, when the majority stake of the network was sold to UBC Media, with GWR retaining 20%. As a consequence, all participating stations in the network were re- branded, and Marcher Gold became Classic Gold Marcher. Despite the changes in ownership, Classic Gold Marcher continued to share facilities with the GWR Group-owned former sister station, MFM 103.4. GWR Group merged with Capital Radio Group in 2005, creating GCap Media. After approval from the regulator, GCap successfully purchased 18 of the Classic Gold Network stations from UBC and merged it with its own Capital Gold network, forming simply \\"Gold\\" on 3 August 2007. As a result, the station's Wrexham and Chester licence was renamed \\"Gold North Wales and Cheshire\\". In 2008 GCap Media was purchased by Global Radio. Content Since the renaming of the station as Gold, local content included a daily four-hour local show, at one time presented by Simon Nicks. Local news bulletins feature hourly from 6am until 6pm, with local headlines during breakfast and drivetime. There are also regular local travel bulletins and local commercial breaks. It generally focuses on classic hit and late 20th Century music. When the station was providing local programmes in daytime, Drivetime ended an hour earlier than the rest of the Gold Network at 6pm for an hour-long Welsh language programme called Cŵl Cymru which was networked with Champion 103 and later repeated at 10pm on Coast 96.3. All stations are in the Marcher Radio Group network of Global Radio. The Welsh programming was later dropped from Gold (though remaining on the FM stations as required by their licences) such that Gold could take the networked programming from London outside of a single daily local four-hour programme, also the format used by Gold's stations in England until local programming was dropped on these in 2010.

Gonzalez, 430 F.3d 888 (7th Cir. 2005), was a civil case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld a lower court's summary judgment that the defendant had committed copyright infringement. The decision is noteworthy for rejecting the defendant's fair use defense, which had rested upon the defendant's contention that she was merely \\"sampling\\" songs with the intention of possibly purchasing the downloaded songs in the future, which is known as \\"Try before you buy\\".  Facts  Over a period of several weeks, the defendant downloaded an estimated 1,370 copyrighted songs onto her computer using the KaZaA peer-to-peer file- sharing software, without authorization from the holders of the copyrights in the underlying compositions and sound recordings. The defendant owned compact discs containing some fraction of the songs that she downloaded. The parties disagreed on precisely how many of the defendant's downloads represented songs that the defendant already owned on CD, but it was undisputed that the defendant had never owned authorized copies of 30 of the songs she downloaded. The defendant retained at least these 30 songs on her computer's hard drive even after deciding not to purchase them on CD.  Lower Court Proceedings  Four recording companies who held the copyrights in the songs that the defendant downloaded filed a lawsuit accusing the defendant of copyright infringement. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois agreed with the plaintiffs, and entered summary judgment for the plaintiffs. The trial court rejected the defendant's \\"fair use\\" defense. As a remedy, the trial court (1) awarded the plaintiffs $22,500 in statutory damages (representing the statutory minimum of $750 times the defendant's 30 infringing downloads), and (2) issued a permanent injunction forbidding the defendant to download copyrighted recordings owned by the plaintiffs. The defendant appealed to the Seventh Circuit.  Ruling of the Court of Appeals  The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision in its entirety. The court first reasoned that the copies of the songs that the defendant had downloaded were infringing copies, rejecting the defendant's analogy to the \\"time-shifting\\" doctrine enunciated in the Supreme Court's landmark Sony decision. Turning to the defense of fair use, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that it was obliged to apply the four statutory factors given in Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 for determining whether the defendant's copying of the plaintiffs' works qualified as a lawful \\"fair use.\\" > Section 107 provides that when considering a defense of fair use the court > must take into account “(1) the purpose and character of the use, including > whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational > purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and > substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a > whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value > of the copyrighted work.” Most of these factors, the Court noted, weighed against the defendant: > Gonzalez was not engaged in a nonprofit use; she downloaded (and kept) whole > copyrighted songs (for which, as with poetry, copying of more than a couplet > or two is deemed excessive); and she did this despite the fact that these > works often are sold per song as well as per album. This leads her to > concentrate on the fourth consideration: “the effect of the use upon the > potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. The defendant argued that downloading songs for the purpose of \\"sampling\\" would have a positive effect on the market for those songs, spurring sales of the songs the defendant enjoyed enough to purchase. The Court of Appeals declared that this argument was both factually unsupported and inconsistent with the Supreme Court's recent Grokster decision and with other cases involving file-sharing and copyright infringement: > As she tells the tale, downloading on a try-before-you-buy basis is good > advertising for copyright proprietors, expanding the value of their > inventory. The Supreme Court thought otherwise in Grokster, with > considerable empirical support. As file sharing has increased over the last > four years, the sales of recorded music have dropped by approximately 30%. > Perhaps other economic factors contributed, but the events likely are > related. Music downloaded for free from the Internet is a close substitute > for purchased music; many people are bound to keep the downloaded files > without buying originals. That is exactly what Gonzalez did for at least 30 > songs. It is no surprise, therefore, that the only appellate decision on > point has held that downloading copyrighted songs cannot be defended as fair > use, whether or not the recipient plans to buy songs she likes well enough > to spring for. See A&M; Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., 239 F.3d 1004, > 1014-19 (9th Cir. 2001). See also UMG Recordings, Inc. v. MP3.com, Inc., 92 > F. Supp. 2d 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (holding that downloads are not fair use > even if the downloader already owns one purchased copy). Although the copyright holders might indeed benefit if downloaders purchased additional CDs containing songs they had \\"sampled\\" and enjoyed, the court continued, \\"sampling\\" nevertheless deprived copyright holders of the revenues they might have earned from licensing authorized downloads of their works. The court also upheld the award of $22,500 in statutory damages against the defendant, noting that this amount represented the minimum award provided under the statute for works (such as the plaintiffs') that had been published with an adequate copyright notice. The court rejected the defendant's argument that the Seventh Amendment guaranteed her the right to a jury trial as to the appropriate amount of damages. The court reasoned, in essence, that where the plaintiff sought only the minimum amount of damages provided under the statute, there were no disputed issues as to the proper amount of damages for a jury to resolve, and the issue of damages was appropriate for summary resolution. Finally, the court upheld the district court's permanent injunction against the defendant's downloading of copyrighted works. See also * Harper v.

The treaty confirmed the border between Finland and Soviet Russia after the Finnish civil war and Finnish volunteer expeditions in Russian East Karelia. The treaty was signed in Tartu (Estonia) at the Estonian Students' Society building. Ratifications of the treaty were exchanged in Moscow on 31 December 1920. The treaty was registered in the League of Nations Treaty Series on 5 March 1921.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 3, pp. 6–79  Political Background  This turbulent time in Finnish and Russian politics influenced the events that led to the Treaty of Tartu. Prior to the Treaty of Tartu, Finnish political parties shifted their sovereign policies several times. In early 1917, the conservative party was split into two factions: The Old Finns and the Young Finns. The Old Finns wanted to keep ties to St. Petersburg close and argued against an independent Finland hoping not to agitate the Russian monarchy and further limit Finnish autonomy. The Young Finns differed in this regard as they promoted the idea of an independent Finland. The third major Finnish party were the leftist social-democrats. These social democrats also wanted to see a free and independent Finland. All of this changed in the matter of a short few months when the Bolsheviks took control of the country during the Russian Revolution. The Bolsheviks became an ally to the Finnish social democrats as they shared common ideological ground. This changed the stance of the social democrats leading them to become pro-Russian. Meanwhile, the Old Finns, in disagreement with the Bolshevik policies became pro- independence. During the November 1917 election the coalition representing the pro-independence parties won the cabinet election and immediately moved to make Finland an independent nation with the Finnish Declaration of Independence. As the Bolshevik ideology formally subscribed to each people's right for self-determination and condemned any form of imperialism, Lenin saw the opportunity to promote his public support for the Finnish declaration as a showpiece of benevolence of the new Soviet system. However, the move for independence, Soviet support and general uncertainty and unrest in the society encouraged the militant left to attempt to duplicate the success of Russia's recent revolution and soon after the Finnish Civil War began. In the war the revolutionary socialist militia known as the Finnish Red Army clashed against the Finnish White forces which were loyal to the legal (non-socialist) government. The government's forces, assisted by a division of regular German forces and Swedish volunteers, pushed back the Red troops that had initially controlled the industrial southern provinces and within some months, won the war. The border question between Russia and Finland remained unsettled after the war. Around 1,400-1,650 lives were lost in the ranks of the Red troops, while between 7,000 and 10,000 people died within the White ones. In total, 37,000-38,5000 people died as a result of the Civil War, and 76,000 prisoners - of which 100 were executed - were captured by the Whites in cooperation with the German forces. Following the civil war, the Finnish government sought to seek additional security by forming ties with the Germans. This alliance was short lived with the defeat of the central powers during World War I. With Germany’s demise the Finnish government realized it would have to accept the necessity of forming relations with the nascent Bolshevik Russian government, due to the developments of the Russian Civil War, even though their recent support for Red revolutionaries in Finland made the government very wary of the Bolsheviks. As other countries were now making similar treaties with Russia, such as Treaty of Tartu (Russian–Estonian), the voices questioning the legality and honor of dealing with the violently established Bolshevik government were also diminishing. Especially the large, moderately socialist Social Democrat party was willing to finally normalize the relations with the greater neighboring state. Nevertheless, some nationalistic and rightist elements in Finnish Parliament still considered the planned treaty as too far going, even shameful, by giving up some of the initial negotiation goals and shattering their ideals of a grater national state including also eastern territories settled from ancient times by Finnic Karelian people, which never belonged to the Autonomous Grand Duchy of Finlandhttp://finland100.fi/2017/09/06/the-republic-made-peace-with-soviet- russia/. in hindsight, the treaty was rather good to Finland, especially compared to the treaties made at the end of Second World Warhttps://finland.fi/life-society/tracing-finlands-eastern-border/. Contents The treaty confirmed that the Finnish-Soviet border would follow the old border between the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland and Imperial Russia. Finland additionally received Petsamo, with its ice-free harbour on the Arctic Ocean. As far back as 1864, Tsar Alexander II had promised to join Petsamo to Finland in exchange for a piece of the Karelian Isthmus.Pieni tietosanakirja, \\"The senate had suggested in 1863 that if the promise of handing over the weapons factory in question and its surrounding area to Russia could be realized, then the above mentioned coastal region could be given to Finland. In 1864 there were imperial statutes about that, but that never occurred.\\" (translation from Finnish) Finland also agreed to leave the joined and then occupied areas of Repola (joined to Finland during the Viena expedition) and Porajärvi (joined during the Aunus expedition) in Russian East Karelia. The treaty also included Finland handing over the contested region of North Ingria to Russia, thereby disbanding the short-lived Republic of North Ingria. The treaty also had some articles besides area and border issues, including Soviet guarantee of free navigation of merchant ships from the Finnish ports in Lake Ladoga (Laatokka in Finnish) to the Gulf of Finland via the River Neva. Finland guaranteed land transit from the Soviet Union to Norway via the Petsamo area. Also, Finland agreed to disarm the coastal fortress in Ino, opposite the Soviet city Kronstadt located on the island of Kotlin. The Finnish outer islands in the Gulf of Finland were demilitarized. The treaty was subject to controversy first during the East Karelian Uprising 1921–1922 when the Finnish government allowed volunteers to take part in the conflict. The treaty was finally broken by the Soviet Union in 1939, when it started the Winter War against Finland.

Estonia before the treaty Estonia had been a province of Imperial Russia since 1710, and had been subject to some sort of foreign hegemony since the 13th century.Remembering the Tartu Peace Treaty. In 1917, three years into World War I, the Russian Empire fell into revolution and civil war. As a part of this larger conflict, the Estonians declared independence from Russia and won their freedom during the Estonian War of Independence. As a symbol of Estonian independence, Yuryev/Dorpat was officially given back its Estonian name, Tartu. The new Communist Russian government acknowledged Estonia's freedom in the 1920 Treaty of Tartu.  Treaty provisions  The treaty established the border between Estonia and Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, affirmed the right of Estonian people to return to Estonia and Russian people to return to Russia and required that Estonian movable property evacuated to Russia in World War I be returned to Estonia. Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic also agreed to absolve all Russian Imperial debt and to pay Estonia 15 million gold rubles, a share from the gold reserves of the former Russian Empire. Additionally RSFSR agreed to grant concessions to exploit one million hectares of Russian forest land and to build a railway line from the Estonian border to Moscow. In return, Estonia allowed the RSFSR to build a free port at Tallinn or some other harbour and to erect a power station on the Narva River.Georg von Rauch, The Baltic States: The Years of Independence 1917–1940, Hurst & Co, 1974, p. 73  Signatories  Part of the Estonian delegation at the Treaty of Tartu (left to right): Jaan Poska, Jaan Soots and Victor Mutt. The treaty was signed by Jaan Poska on the Estonian side and Adolf Joffe for Soviet Russia, as well as by other representatives of both parties.  Significance  The Tartu Peace Treaty has been regarded as the birth certificate of the Republic of Estonia because it was the first de jure recognition of the state. The treaty was also of utmost importance to the diplomatically isolated Soviet Russia, with Lenin expressing satisfaction with the treaty as \\"an incomparable victory over Western imperialism\\". Some members of the Entente opposed the treaty with the intention to keep Soviet Russia in international isolation.  Aftermath  After the signing, Soviet Russia did not fulfill several points of the treaty. For example, the museological collections of the University of Tartu have not been returned to this day from Voronezh and the migration of Estonians was obstructed.Ülo Kaevats et al. 1996. Eesti Entsüklopeedia 9. Tallinn: Eesti Entsüklopeediakirjastus, Estonia was later invaded, occupied and annexed by the USSR during World War II, following the Molotov-Ribbentrop Agreement. That secret treaty – between Nazi Germany and the USSR – defined the borders of Soviet and German spheres of influence across the territories of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland.

Alexa meets with Evan, claiming to be a record producer and asking him if he will write a screenplay based on her glamorous life story; this will require him to follow her around and take notes. She promises him fame and fortune in return—the same things she has promised, but never given, to so many other hot young aspiring celebrities. As Evan accompanies her, Alexa spends money in lavish and wasteful ways, eating and staying at the Royalton and buying new suits from Saks Fifth Avenue. At one point, Evan offers to pay for lunch, and she repays him with too much money.

The episode also aired on May 4, 2008 on CTV in Canada; on May 14, 2008 on FX in the UK; on September 28, 2008 on Channel Ten in Australia; and on March 21, 2011 on STAR World in India. The episode was written by Daniel Cerone and executive producer Melissa Rosenberg, and was directed by Michael Cuesta. Based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay, the season featured many differences to the original source, mainly in the lead-up to and revelation of the identity of the \\"Ice Truck Killer\\". The episode received critical acclaim. The episode focuses on the final confrontation between Dexter and the \\"Ice Truck Killer\\". After kidnapping Debra Morgan (Jennifer Carpenter), Rudy Cooper (Christian Camargo) is in the final stages of his plan to reunite with his long-lost brother. James Doakes (Erik King) and María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez) investigate the case, and Doakes begins to suspect that Dexter is involved. Meanwhile, Paul Bennett (Mark Pellegrino) tries to convince Rita Bennett (Julie Benz) that Dexter is not who she thinks he is.  Plot  Dexter rushes to find Debra, having discovered that her boyfriend Rudy is the Ice Truck Killer. Since the killer had always sent secret messages to Dexter, he searches his apartment for clues that Rudy could have left, finding a picture of the shipping container where his mother was killed. When Dexter is about to leave, Doakes and LaGuerta arrive, telling him that they think Rudy stabbed Angel. Doakes insists that Dexter knows something, and he reveals that the blood on Angel's collar matched Rudy's. After the pair leave, Dexter goes to search for the shipping container. At the station, LaGuerta orders a search for Rudy. Matthews walks in and introduces Esmee Pascal, the new lieutenant replacing her. At the shipping yard, Dexter breaks into the container in the picture, only to find it full of bananas. Doakes appears and asks him what he is doing. After a fist fight between the two, a foreman arrives and orders them to leave. Doakes tells Dexter that he knows that he is up to something, and says that he will be watching him. Meanwhile, Rita is contacted by an imprisoned Paul, who contends that Dexter knocked him out and set him up. She is visited by Paul's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, who attempts to convince her that Paul is telling the truth. In a final plea, Paul calls Rita and tells her to search their house for a shoe which he believes came off when Dexter knocked him out. Rita hangs up, but discovers the shoe while taking out the trash. After finding a clue at Rudy's house, Dexter arrives at the house of his biological mother, Laura Moser. Flashbacks reveal that Rudy, whose real name is Brian Moser, is in fact Dexter's brother. He also witnessed the murder of their mother, but did not repress the memory; instead, he grew up in a mental institution and was treated for antisocial personality disorder. Dexter meets Brian in their childhood home, where he is keeping Debra. He intends to kill Debra with Dexter as a sort of \\"family reunion\\", but Dexter stops him. As Doakes and the police close in on the house, Brian escapes through a trap door and Dexter is left with Debra, appearing to have saved her. Doakes tries to question Dexter about his involvement, but is stopped by an indignant Debra, who says that Dexter is a hero. Dexter accompanies her to the hospital before the two return to Dexter's apartment. In the middle of the night, Brian breaks in and attempts to stab Debra, only to find a prosthetic body in her place; Dexter then chokes him unconscious with a garrote. In the refrigeration unit in Brian's apartment, Dexter ties him to the killing table with plastic wrap. After an emotionally charged conversation, Dexter slices his brother's throat and leaves him upside down to drain, staging it as a suicide. Dexter and Debra arrive at a crime scene, and he imagines what it would be like if everyone knew and happily accepted the truth about him.  Production  \\"Born Free\\" was written by Daniel Cerone and executive producer Melissa Rosenberg, and was directed by Michael Cuesta. Cerone and Rosenberg have written two previous episodes each, while this episode marked Cuesta's fifth time returning as director. Guest stars in this episode include Geoff Pierson, C. S. Lee, Mark Pellegrino, Christian Camargo, Judith Scott and Scott Atkinson. Rudy's apartment was set in Miami, Florida, however filming took place in Long Beach, California. The apartment was a brown, triangular apartment condo, so the producers altered its appearance; a false brick wall was placed in front of the garage entrance and a door was created. The producers also concealed a narrow door of the garage entrance with a potted plant, and added false window panes to the windows, concealing the existing vertical blinds. The shipping yard shown in the episode was set in the Port of Miami, yet filming took place in a port dock at the Port of Los Angeles. The scene was filmed in San Pedro, California, in a waterfront lot of Harbor Boulevard. The first season of Dexter is based on the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay. However, there are numerous differences, ranging from extra subplots to rearrangements and modifications of elements from the source material. The biggest change is the lead-up to and revelation of the identity of the \\"Ice Truck Killer\\", called the \\"Tamiami Butcher\\" in the novel. In the novel, Dexter is led to believe that he might be the one committing the murders, due to a series of strange dreams that connect him to the murder. The final clue is a blurry photo, taken from surveillance footage, of a man who resembles Dexter at a crime scene. After the \\"Tamiami Killer\\" kidnaps Deborah, Dexter finds and confronts him. It is subsequently revealed that the killer is actually Dexter's nearly identical long-lost brother, Brian, who, like Dexter, witnessed their mother's brutal murder. Dexter is followed by Detective LaGuerta, who is slain by Brian. Debra finds out her brother is a killer and Dexter helps Brian to escape. In the television series, Brian is introduced under the fake name Rudy, a prosthetist who becomes Debra's boyfriend. Dexter hesitantly kills Brian instead of letting him escape, Debra does not discover her brother's secret, and LaGuerta is not present at all in the confrontation. In the novel, Dexter and his brother are nearly identical, whereas the actors playing the two characters are distinct from each other in their looks.  Reception  \\"Born Free\\" was the most-watched original series telecast on Showtime since 2004, when the Nielsen ratings started separating the channel's ratings from Showtime Plex, the package of Showtime channels offered by most cable and satellite systems. The finale drew an audience of 1.1 million American viewers, a significant increase over the series premiere, which attracted slightly more than 600,000 viewers. The first season attracted on average 1.96 million American viewers, including live and DVR viewing off the premium channel's main feed. \\"Born Free\\" brought in 589,000 viewers on its first free-to-air broadcast in Australia. Hall submitted the episode for consideration for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, but was not ultimately nominated. \\"Born Free\\" has received critical acclaim. Eric Goldman of IGN said that \\"Born Free\\" was \\"an intense episode that brought the Ice Truck Killer story to a satisfying conclusion.\\" He felt that the \\"biggest shock of all\\" was the reveal of Rudy as Dexter's brother, and described their confrontation as \\"riveting\\". Goldman gave the episode an \\"incredible\\" rating of 9.5 out of 10. Paula Paige of TV Guide was \\"impressed\\" by Michael Hall's \\"incredible acting ability,\\" praising his ability to transform from a \\"stoic killer to overwrought brother in a matter of moments.\\" She said that the series went \\"from being a good show to a fantastic show in the course of one season,\\" and hoped that \\"the sophomore season will be just as terrific.\\" Jonathan Toomey of TV Squad felt that it would be a \\"shame\\" if Hall did not win a Golden Globe Award, saying that he \\"certainly deserves it.\\" He understood why Rudy wanted to make Debra the brothers' first victim together; Rudy was jealous of the life that Dexter received and killing Debra was the symbol of that life dying. Although Toomey said that the episode was \\"really well written,\\" he was troubled that no one made the connection between Dexter and Rudy when all they had to do was read Rudy's file, but Toomey speculated that it could be discovered the next season.

She is best known for her autobiography I Raise My Eyes to Say Yes, co-authored with Steven B. Kaplan. Biography Sienkiewicz-Mercer was born in Northampton, Massachusetts. She was a healthy baby, but was afflicted with a severe bout of encephalitis at the age of five weeks. At thirteen months, she was diagnosed with cerebral palsy resulting from the encephalitis. Her control over her entire body, except for her face and digestive system, was severely impaired; though not completely paralyzed, she could not care for herself or communicate through speech as most people know it. Due to her inability to communicate normally, she was diagnosed as an imbecile at the age of five. She lived mostly with her family until age eleven, with some brief stays in rehabilitation centers invariably terminated by her family's poor financial situation. As she approached her teens, it became increasingly difficult for her mother and family to care for her. Her parents decided to send her to the Belchertown State School, an institution for the mentally and physically disabled. There, like many of the institution's patients, she was severely mistreated. She spent most of the next eight years lying in bed in a ward of schizophrenics, ministered to by overworked attendants who often force-fed her and assumed that as an imbecile she had no awareness of the world around her. A staff turnover in 1967 began to change things, as Sienkiewicz-Mercer learned to communicate with some of the new attendants and formed close friendships with them. Several attempts by the school at establishing a physical therapy and education program resulted in the development of a word board for her, providing her with a robust method of communication for the first time. In 1973, the massive building in which the mental wards were housed was renovated, and she was moved to a small temporary building with nineteen other high-functioning patients. The attendants there were friendly and the atmosphere far less oppressive than the wards; the patients were given greater liberty, to the extent that some were allowed to drink alcohol. With the support of many friends, she and some fellow patients left the State School and moved into their own apartment in 1978. One of these ex-patients, Norman Mercer, she married. The year after, her autobiography was published to media attention and critical acclaim. After her departure from Belchertown, she became a disability rights activist, giving \\"speeches\\" (with the aid of an assistant and later a speech synthesizer) in cities across America. Her efforts may have contributed to the closure of Belchertown State School in 1992. Death Ruth Sienkiewicz-Mercer died in Northampton, Massachusetts on August 8, 1998, aged 47.

Geography Csanádpalota covers an area of and has a population of 3286 people (2002). It is located close to the Romanian state border about 20 km from the town of Makó. Adjacent communities include Kövegy (4 km. distant), Pitvaros (11 km.), and Nagylak (10 km.). Csanádpalota has railroad access via the Ujszeged-Mezőhegyes section of Lane 121 of the Hungarian State Railroad System (MÁV). Bus access is available via 18 bus lines that pass through the town (eight of them run until Szeged), and there are three bus stops within the town borders of Csanádpalota. History The first recorded mention of Csanádpalota (then a village) in the national archives is dated 1421. At that time it was owned by the Jánki family of Nagylak. The landowner had an elegant mansion there, and the name of the town (which translates to \\"palace of county Csanád\\") refers to it. Six years later, in 1427, Sigismund of Luxemburg granted the lands of Csanádpalota to Albert Nagymihályi, the viceroy of Dalmatia and Croatia. The lands surrounding the village belonged to the Hunyadi family, and were maintained until 1552 when Turkish invaders under the control of Suleiman the Magnificent devastated it. In 1562 Slovak families were settled in the nearly depopulated village, and it was rechristened Tótpalota (meaning \\"Slovak palace\\"). Subsequent to the fall of Gyula to the Turks in the fourth Ottoman–Habsburg war, Csanádpalota was again nearly depopulated. In 1637 the reigning prince of Transylvania, Mihály Apafi the 1st, became landowner and the village was renamed Mezőpalota (\\"field palace\\"). Between 1646 and 1649, during the reign of Prince Georg Rákóczi of Transylvania, the land was owned by Bishop Thomas Pálffy and had been repopulated by Hungarians. After the Turks left Csanád County it was annexed by Arad. The town's Roman Catholic church was established in 1763 through the special efforts of Supreme judge György Fekete. In 1750 Queen Maria Theresia introduced German immigrants to help cultivate the fields of Csanádpalota, but the immigrants were unwilling to live together with Slovak, Wallachian and Serbian inhabitants. The immigrant population eventually left to join the village of Perjámos whose German population was considerably larger, and Csanádpalota was left largely uninhabited. Austria then attempted to revive the village through the settlement of Hungarian Catholics and volunteers from several Hungarian counties (Gömör, Nógrád, Heves, and Hont). The name Csanádpalota was officially reestablished in 1756. After 7 years (in 1763), due to the efforts of Supreme judge György Fekete the village erected a Roman Catholic church. The village structure was developed in an arrangement similar to that of a typical southern Hungarian community. The distribution of lots was carried out by the Austrian Chamber of Engineers around 1850. At that time, two new villages, Kövegy and Királyhegyes, were formed from land belonging to Csanádpalota. The town's two-story school was built in 1857, and preschool educational facilities received a home in the kindergarten building which was completed in 1893. The same year, the town post office and railway station were built. Around this time, during the period of Austro-Hungarian dualism, a brick factory was also constructed in Csanádpalota. After World War I the village was occupied by Romanian forces for a short period and, as stipulated by the Treaty of Trianon, part of the lands of Csanádpalota were given to Romania. Internal Hungarian restructuring immediately following Trianon led to the reapportionment of land such that outlying areas of the village Nagylak were given to Csanádpalota to increase its size. The village belonged for short periods to several Hungarian counties (Csanád, Arad, and Torontál) before eventually being annexed by Csongrád County. During the period of redistricting, several flour mills and cooperatives were established within the village and in 1937 it received electricity. The major employers of citizens of the village at this time were the Blaskovics Manor and the Nagylak Hemp Factory. During the late thirties, farmers from Makó introduced onion cultivation to Csanádpalota. During World War II, 165 citizens were killed in action. Csanádpalota lost some of its territory through redistricting after the war, by giving the land today known as Nagykirályhegyes to Királyhegyes. Throughout the thirties and forties the village became home to military border guards. The village of Csanádpalota was promoted to a town on July 1, 2009.Még idén eldől, város lehet-e Csanádpalota - Délmagyar.huCsongrád megye tizedik városa Csanádpalota - Delmagyar.hu A new kindergarten building (equipped with solar heating), was completed during the summer of 2010.Csanádpalotán a gólyák is dolgoznak - Delmagyar.hu Culture and education Csanádpalota is home to Napsugár (\\"sunshine\\") Kindergarten and the István Déri General School (grade 1-8), the latter of which is located in two buildings.

Park Seed specializes in garden seeds, offering more than 1,100 varieties of flower, vegetable, and herb seeds, plus a large selection of bulbs, live plants, and gardening accessories. Park Seed Company distributes millions of catalogs every year and maintains an online retail presence. Park Seed is a division of Jackson & Perkins Park Acquisitions, which is a subsidiary of publicly traded Western Capital Resources. History Park Seed Company got its start in 1868 when 15-year-old George Watt Park decided to sell seeds he had harvested from his backyard garden in Libonia, Pennsylvania. Park bought a hand press and printed a list of the seeds that he wanted to sell. In addition to circulating this list to friends and neighbors, he also bought an advertisement in The Rural American for $3.50. The ad resulted in $6.50 in seed orders. With this success, Park found his life's work. The cover of the January 1900 Park's Floral Magazine features a portrait of the founder, George Watt Park. From Park Seed Company archives. Park Seed Company published its first small catalog in 1868. The book contained just 8 pages and used 2 illustrations—wood cuts of an aster and a pansy. In 1871, Park Seed initiated a monthly publication called The Floral Gazette. The publication was more magazine than catalog and offered its readers a forum for sharing gardening experiences and a seed exchange column that encouraged readers to trade seeds, bulbs and plants. It also carried a significant amount of advertising, including ads from other purveyors of seed. By 1877, the name had changed to Park’s Floral Magazine and circulation had grown to 20,000. By 1918, that figure hit 800,000. The growing number of catalogs brought in increasing numbers of orders, and by 1900, it was clear that the business had outgrown the small post office at Libonia. Park Seed Company moved to La Park (now Paradise), Pennsylvania in 1902. In 1918, Park married Carol Mary Barratt, a young county home demonstration agent from South Carolina. Barrat(Park) moved to La Park and became both a partner in the business and the mother of two sons: George Barratt Park and William John Park. Eventually the Park family moved to Dunedin, Florida, and produced a catalog there in 1923. Unfortunately, while the family enjoyed Florida, the heat and humidity proved to be highly unsuitable for storing seeds. In looking for a better environment for the business, they settled on Mary’s hometown of Greenwood, South Carolina, and moved the business there in 1924. For the first 25 years in Greenwood, Park Seed Company occupied a large old house. Then in 1950, they made a move to a more modern storefront location and entered the era of environmental control for seed quality. Eventually, Park Seed obtained 500 acres (2 km²) on the northern edge of Greenwood near Hodges, and designed and built there a total business complex to house the company’s offices, research facilities, seed storage and processing areas, temperature-controlled areas for storing plants and bulbs, computer facilities, mailorder department, and customer service facility, plus its catalog preparation area and an area for its wholesale division. The core buildings of this campus were completed in 1961. The company resides there today, continually expanding and renewing the complex to meet changing requirements. In 1975, Wayside Gardens, a mail-order company in Mentor, Ohio, came on the market and was acquired by Park Seed. Wayside Gardens' product line of perennials, bulbs, trees, and shrubs was a good complement to Park Seed Company's seeds. Wayside Gardens was moved to the Greenwood, SC, facility. The Park family ran the company until 2005, when it was sold to Florida real estate executive Donald Hachenberger. The company has been bought and sold since and is now a division of Jackson & Perkins Park Acquisitions, which is a subsidiary of publicly traded Western Capital Resources. Jackson & Perkins Park Acquisitions encompasses three garden brands Park Seed, Jackson & Perkins, and Wayside Gardens as well as the hardware brand Van Dykes Restorers.

From its inception in 1999, the Festival has grown in stature and popularity, attracting visitors and participants from other parts of the country, and the world. The Festival is organised by the Kala Ghoda Association (a non-profit organisation that states its objectives as \\"physically upgrading the Kala Ghoda sub-precinct and making it the Art District of Mumbai\\") and curated by teams handling each of the 12 sections of the festival. Overview Sivamani, acclaimed percussionist at the Kala Ghoda festival, 2007 'Literature Discussions' at David Sassoon Library during 'Kala Ghoda Festival', 2008 The festival sections are visual arts, dance, music, theatre, cinema, literature including children's literature as a sub section, workshops, heritage walks, urban design and architecture (2014), food, a dedicated section for children, and a vibrant street section including stalls selling eco friendly, hand made arts and crafts wares. Entry to all events is free to all (only restricted by the size of the venues) and costs are met through corporate sponsorship. Venues include The auditorium at the National Gallery of Modern Art, the garden at the David Sassoon Library, the lawns and auditoriums at the CSMVS, The Museum, Mumbai, the Cross Maidan, the Horniman Circle garden, the M C Ghia Hall, the Cafeteria at Westside, the Tata store at Army and Navy Building, the Max Mueller Bhavan (MMB) Gallery and the entire street area of Kaikashru Dubash Marg and its parking lot, popularly called Rampart Row. Rampart Row is closed off to vehicular traffic for the duration of the festival, with the entire area becoming a street mela, with food stalls, artisans selling their creations, artists who sketch instant portraits, street art installations and the like. In recent years, the Festival has expanded beyond the Kala Ghoda crescent, with events being held in Cross Maidan and Horniman Circle as well. The success of the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival has, arguably, encouraged the setting up of several other arts and cultural festivals at that time of the year, when the weather in Mumbai is cool and the sun sets early. These include the Mumbai Festival, the Celebrate Bandra Festival, and in 2007, the Kitab Festival. The festival has also featured noticeable music acts like Spencer Maybe, Indus Creed, Benny Dayal and Ustad Zakir Hussain.

It is located in Mobile, Alabama. The Mobile Yacht Club sponsors and participates annually in numerous Club regattas, as well as races in affiliation with the Gulf Yachting Association, of which MYC is a charter member. The Club and its individual members have fared well in local, regional, national, and international local races including the Dauphin Island Regatta, the GYA sponsored Liptons, the Broken Triangle Race, the Around-the-Rig Regatta, and the MYC Anniversary Regatta. History As early as the 1830s, local \\"boat clubs\\" had been holding races on Mobile Bay. By the time the 1840s rolled around, prosperous young businessmen had organized the Mobile Yacht Club (earlier called the Mobile Regatta Club), and began holding large regattas at the fashionable watering holes on the Eastern Shore, such as Point Clear, Battles Wharf, and Howard's Landing. Those regattas attracted racing yachts and high stakes from all along the Gulf Coast, and competition among cities like New Orleans, Pass Christian, Biloxi, and Mobile was fierce. Smaller races, particularly one-on-one match races were usually held closer to downtown Mobile. Mobile Yacht Club’s first club house, located on the east bank of the Mobile River opposite the foot of St. Francis Street. The club was reached by a small sail ferry, the ferryman being hailed by a whistle blown by the member wanting transportation—each member being furnished a whistle. The Civil War and the presence of the Union Fleet in the bay successfully discouraged yacht racing, and the activities of Mobile Yacht Club were suspended for several years. But by 1868 (and possibly sooner) the Mobile Yacht Club was again holding regattas. The club's membership suffered during reconstruction, but by the 1880s, Mobile yachtsmen had reorganized their club and sold stock to build a clubhouse on a newly acquired plot on the Mobile River just opposite downtown. A small launch ferried members from the foot of St. Francis Street to the new club. Prior to that, meetings had been held in rooms and offices in downtown Mobile. A burgeoning membership soon outgrew that small house, and at the 1897 annual meeting the Commodore appointed a committee to consider a new building. The famous New Orleans architect and member of the Southern Yacht Club, Thomas Sully designed the elaborate club house a few years later, and it was built near the old location on Mobile River. The clubhouse was a grand sight viewed from front, and small boat races were held on Mobile River. But when the monster hurricane of July 5, 1916 combined a high tide with south winds, the club was completely destroyed and set many yachts adrift. By then electric streetcars had lured the focus of the city from the downtown waterfront to the parks, theaters, and beaches that line the western shore. At the end of the wharf at Monroe Park, Mobile Yacht Club built another lavish building, comfortably furnished and decorated with pictures of famous yachts. The MYC \\"rocking chair fleet\\" enjoyed watching many regattas from the wide verandahs of the Monroe Park club house. But the hurricane of 1916 swept the house cleanly away, with only the pilings left standing. By the end of World War I, the members had re-established the club on the bay's Eastern Shore, where it had re-established the club on the name of Mobile Yacht Club, and moved to Barret's Beach. In 1940, just north of the mouth of Dog River, the club built a neat two-story house that served well for more than 30 years. After Hurricane Frederick in 1979, the current version of the venerable Mobile Yacht Club was constructed, overlooking a splendid view of the bay on the east, and a forest of masts in the crowded Dog River harbor on the west.

Stirm, Lorrie Stirm, Bo Stirm, Cindy Stirm, Loretta Stirm, and Roger Stirm. (© Slava Veder / Associated Press) Burst of Joy is a Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph by Associated Press photographer Slava \\"Sal\\" Veder, taken on March 17, 1973 at Travis Air Force Base in California. The photograph came to symbolize the end of United States involvement in the Vietnam War, and the prevailing sentiment that military personnel and their families could begin a process of healing after enduring the horrors of war. The event at Travis Air Force Base The first group of POWs leaving the prison camps in North Vietnam left Hanoi on a U.S. Air Force Lockheed C-141 Starlifter strategic airlift aircraft nicknamed the Hanoi Taxi, which flew them to Clark Air Base in the Philippines for medical examinations. On March 17, the plane landed at Travis Air Force Base in California. Even though there were only 20 POWs of that first increment released aboard the plane, almost 400 family members turned up for the homecoming. Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Stirm, USAF, made a speech \\"on behalf of himself and other POWs who had arrived from Vietnam as part of Operation Homecoming.\\" Smithsonian Magazine says that \\"Veder, who'd been standing in a crowded bullpen with dozens of other journalists, noticed the sprinting family and started taking pictures. 'You could feel the energy and the raw emotion in the air'.\\" =Developing the latent images= Veder then rushed to the makeshift photo developing station (for 35 mm film) in the ladies' room of the air base's flightline washrooms, while the photographers from United Press International were in the men's. Smithsonian Magazine says that \\"In less than half an hour, Veder and his AP colleague Walt Zeboski had developed six remarkable images of that singular moment. Veder's pick, which he instantly titled Burst of Joy, was sent out over the news-service wires\\". The depicted persons The photograph depicts United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Stirm being reunited with his family, after spending more than five years in captivity as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. Stirm was shot down over Hanoi on October 27, 1967, while leading a flight of F-105s on a bombing mission, and was not released until March 14, 1973. The centerpiece of the photograph is Stirm's 15-year-old daughter Lorrie, who is excitedly greeting her father with outstretched arms, as the rest of the family approaches directly behind her. Despite outward appearances, the reunion was an unhappy one for Stirm. Three days before he arrived in the United States, the same day he was released from captivity, Stirm received a Dear John letter from his wife Loretta informing him that their marriage was over. Stirm later learned that Loretta had been with other men throughout his captivity, receiving marriage proposals from three of them. In 1974, the Stirms divorced and Loretta remarried, but Lieutenant Colonel Stirm was still ordered by the courts to provide her with 43% of his military retirement pay once he retired from the Air Force. Stirm was later promoted to full Colonel and retired from the Air Force in 1977. After Burst of Joy was announced as the winner of the Pulitzer Prize, all of the family members depicted in the picture received copies. All depicted children display it prominently in their homes except for Colonel Stirm himself, who says he cannot bring himself to display the picture. Reactions About the picture and its legacy, Lorrie Stirm Kitching once noted, \\"We have this very nice picture of a very happy moment, but every time I look at it, I remember the families that weren't reunited, and the ones that aren't being reunited today — many, many families — and I think, I'm one of the lucky ones.\\" Donald Goldstein, a retired Air Force colonel and a co-author of a prominent Vietnam War photojournalism book, The Vietnam War: The Stories and The Photographs, says of Burst of Joy, \\"After years of fighting a war we couldn't win, a war that tore us apart, it was finally over, and the country could start healing.\\" See also *1974 Pulitzer Prize *U.S. prisoners of war during the Vietnam War Bibliography ;Notes ;References * * \\\\- Total pages: 289 * * External links *Pilots from Takhli and Korat Airbases shot down between 1965–1972 *Sad Story Behind 'Burst of Joy' Vietnam POW Photo Category:1973 in California Category:Black-and-white photographs Category:Vietnam War photographs Category:Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs Category:Photographs of the United States Category:Images of the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Military in the San Francisco Bay Area Category:Associated Press Category:United States Air Force Category:1973 works Category:1973 in art Category:1970s photographs ","title":"Burst of Joy"},{"id":"7987780","title":"São Tomé and Príncipe at the 1996 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"7987788","text":"Stasia Milas Czernicki (May 18, 1922 – January 17, 1993)\\"Candlepin's Babe Ruth dies at 70\\"--Stasia Czernicki obituary was an American professional candlepin bowler.

According to former CBS News Correspondent Dan Rather in his book \\"The Camera Never Blinks\\" and in the 2003 book \\"President Kennedy Has Been Shot\\", Rather had advised CBS news headquarters in New York from Dallas that there were unconfirmed reports that the President was dead. Jackson was handed a slip of paper reading \\"JFK DEAD\\" and immediately went on air with the announcement, reporting Kennedy's death as a fact (which had not yet been confirmed, although it was true that Kennedy was already dead), and playing the U.S. national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner.

It occurred on the plains south of Bulla Regia around the upper Bagradas River (the classical name of the Medjerda). The attack was designed as a diversionary tactic by Rome to disrupt Hannibal's attack on Italy. By defeating the Carthaginians, Scipio Africanus caused Hannibal to leave Italy and return to Africa, where he was later defeated at Zama. Prelude Hasdrubal and Syphax had both succeeded in escaping from their camps, which the Roman general Scipio Africanus and his Numidian allies, under Masinissa, had destroyed. Hasdrubal and Syphax fell back, with a few followers who had also escaped the massacre at the Carthaginian camps. The arrival of 4,000 Celtiberian mercenaries from Hispania made the Carthaginians determined to make one more effort to stop the armies of Scipio Africanus from advancing across North Africa. New levies were raised in Carthage and in Numidia, and soon Hasdrubal and Syphax found themselves at the head of an army of 30,000 men. In 203 BC, Scipio, whose command had been extended until the end of the war, marched from his camp at Utica to meet Hasdrubal and Syphax at a place called the Great Plains. Battle The battle was fought between a Roman army under the leadership of Scipio Africanus and a combined Carthaginian/Numidian army, supplemented by Spanish mercenaries (mainly Celtiberians), of which the Carthaginian part was led by Hasdrubal Gisco and the Numidian part by Syphax. Hasdrubal positioned the Spanish mercenaries in the center, subsequently flanked by the Carthaginian infantry and cavalry. The Roman infantry was drawn up in the triplex acies. That is to say, the hastati formed the first line, the principes the second, and the triarii formed the third line. The charge of the Roman cavalry made the Carthaginian infantry and cavalry flee from the field. Only the Spanish infantry remained standing and defending themselves fiercely. The number of Spanish mercenaries was about equal to the first line of the Romans, the hastati. Then Scipio ordered his principes and triarii to march from behind the hastati and attack the flanks of the Spanish mercenaries, who were routed with only a handful managing to escape. The Numidians under Syphax also remained fighting before fleeing. Syphax fled back to his kingdom in Numidia, but was pursued by Masinissa and Laelius, who defeated him at the Battle of Cirta, as a result of which he was captured and brought back to the Roman camp as a prisoner. Masinissa was given command of Syphax's kingdom, the land from which he had originally been exiled. Aftermath Following the battle, the Carthaginians had little choice but to sue for peace with Rome. Scipio proposed modest terms for the Carthaginians in a peace treaty, but while the Carthaginians were still considering the treaty, they suddenly decided to recall Hannibal, who had an army of elite veterans loyal to his command, from Italy, for one more stand against Rome. This encounter became the battle of Zama, which ended the Second Punic War and completed the legend of Scipio Africanus, who had become one of Rome's greatest generals.

He was born around 430 Hijri in the city of Chisht. He initially received education from his father. He memorized the Qur'an by age 7 and completed his education when he was 16. His work includes two books, Minhaaj ul Arifeen and Khulaasat ul Shariah. He died in the month of Rajab at the age of 97 in 533 AH (March 1139 CE). He was buried at Chisht like many of the early Chishtiyya. The big five of India in Sufism: holy biographies of 1. Hazrat Khwaja ... By Wahiduddin Begg  Tasawuf  Hazrat Khwaja Al Mawdud Chisti became the mureed of Hazrat Khwaja Nasir Abu Yusuf Bin Saamaan Chisti. After he became a mureed, his murshid (Master) addressed him by saying, \\"O Qutubuddin Mowdud, adopt the path of the Faqr.\\" The word \\"faqr\\" is literally translated as \\"poverty\\", but in the language of tasawwuf, it means to be rich with Allah. It is for one to have total trust in Allah and not to be dependent on any other than Allah. Faqar is the way of true dervishes. Khwaja Mawdud Al Chisti accepted his murshids (spiritual guidance) advice. Shortly thereafter he went into seclusion and remained absorbed in worship for twenty years. During this period, he rarely ate and was reported to complete two recitations of the Quran during the day and two during the night. He also used to constantly make the zikr of La Ilaha Illallah. Due to his consistent worship, everything in the universe became apparent to him, and nothing was kept hidden.  Khwaja Maudood's Khalifa  Khwaja Mawdud Chishti visited Balkh (the place of birth of Jalaluddin Rumi) and Bukhara, a place mentioned in the famous line of Hafez, \\"If that Turk of Shiraz would take my heart in his hand, I would give for his Hindu mole both Bukhara and Samarkand.\\" Khwaja Haji Sharif Zindani, his successor, renounced everything. He led a life of strict seclusion for 40 years and hated society. He used to live on leaves of trees. Although several of the Chishtiyya stressed the value of asceticism, in general they said that seclusion and ascetic practice was for short periods only. Live in the midst of society rather than keep your spiritual ideals. It is said that the followers of Khwaja Qutubuddin were around 10,000, not including close friends and allies. It is impossible to enumerate Khwaja Mawdud's Khulafa. For the sake of barakat, a few are mentioned hereunder. Among them the link in this (CHISTI) Silsila is Khwaja Shareef Zindani. That is why his message spread. His influence spread west to Khurasan, Iraq, Syria, Hijaz, and Tihamah and in the south to Iran, Siestan and the subcontinent. In the west, his message was spread by the likes of Sharif Zindani and Khwaja Usman Harooni. Khwaja Qutubuddin was 29 when his father died and he inherited the throne. He never visited the rich or went to the royal courts. He was a simple man who led a simple life. He was always courteous to the needs of others. He always was the first to greet people and respected everyone.  Books  Chisti's works include two books, Minhaaj ul Areifeen and Khulaasat ul Shariah.  Sayings  #. The lover of sama' (Sufi music) is a stranger to the outside world, but is a friend to God. #. The mysteries of sama' are inexplicable. If you reveal them you are liable to punishment.  Miracles  * Moulana Zakariyah says: \\"Khwajah Maudood Chisti acquired the capabilities known as Kash-e-Quloob (revelations of the conditions of the hearts) and Kashf-e-Quboor (revelation of the conditions of the graves).\\"Malfozat-e-Khwaja Fareeduddin Ganjshakar * Whenever Khwaja Maudood Chishti wanted to see the Ka'aba, he could see it even though he was in Chisht.(Malfoozat Khwaja Qutubuddin Bukhtiar Kaki, Fariduddin Ganj Shakar) * Khwaja Qutbuddin Maudood Chishti's dead body flew in the air on its way to the graveyard. Khwaja Fareeduddin Ganj Shakar upon narrating this fell unconscious.(Rahatil-Quloob, Ganj Shakar) Descendants Khwaja Maudood Chishti's son Khwaja Najamuddin Ahmed Ahmed Mushtaq Bin Moudod Chishti was buried at Chisht. Syed Abul Alla Moudodi was a descendant of his who was born at Aurangabad India in 1903 Hijri. Many of his descendants live in the area. Khwaja Wali Kirani Moudodi Chishti Kirani and Khwaja Mir Shahdad Moudodi Chishti Kirani are also Khwaja Maudood Chishti's descendants. The tombs of both these famous saints are in a place called Kirani, west of Quetta city. A large number of his descendants still live in Kirani. Khwaja Ibrahim Yukpasi another important saint belonging to Khwaja Maudood Chishti's family is buried in Mastung Balochistan and Khwaja Dopassi is buried in Dhadar near the beginning of Bolan pass Balochistan Pakistan. Descendants Khwaja Qutubuddin Mohammad Thani Chishti migrated to Sindh Old Bukkhar (near Shahdadkot). One of this family descendants named Khwaja Assadullah Kunjnashin Bukkhari migrated to Nawada-Gaya areas of Bihar, India. His followers preached Islam and guided the Muslims there. Khwaja Abdullah Chishti and Hazrat Taj Mahmood Haqqani Chishti were the Sufi saints of Chishti order and direct descendants of Maudood Chishti's son. Their shrines are situated in Milkitola Chhota Sheikhpura, Narhat block near Hisua (GPRS 24 83N 85 43E) Descendant Khwaja Nizam-ud-din Alli's tomb is in the vicinity of Pishin city of Balochistan in a place called Minziki, home for many other descendants. Khwaja Naqruddin Chishti Moudodi (Shaal Pir Baba) is another descendant whose tomb is in Balochistan, located in Quetta chaowni near the old fort. In the valley of shal kot (Quetta) and Bolan in the Balochistan province the influence of the Moudodi family reached within the lifetime of the head of the family. According to one source Khwaja Qutubuddin Moudod visited the area at least once. He came to the home of his follower Shiekh Babut in the area of Shoroak. Shiekh Babut belonged to the pashtoon tribe called 'Bariech'. During the lifetime of Khwaja Moudod Chishti his friends and followers started to spread the message of Islam. Later on Khwaja Qutubuddin Moudod Chishti's own family (the sadat) advanced the message of Islam in greater Balochistan and molded the life of ordinary people according to the ideology of Islam. *(16) – Syed Khwaja Qutubuddin Maudood Chishti in Chisht Hirat Afghanistan.(B430h D527h) *(18) – Syed Rukun ud din Khwaja Hussain Chishti in Chisht Hirat Afghanistan.(B545h D635h) *(19) – Syed Qud ud din Khwaja Mohammad in Chisht Hirat Afghanistan.

National Socialists outside of Germany made considerable efforts to establish an American counterpart organization. Recruiting commenced as early as 1924 with the formation of the Free Society of Teutonia. In May 1933, the Deputy Führer, Rudolf Hess, gave German immigrant and German National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) member Heinz Spanknöbel authority to form an American National Socialist organization. The result was the creation of the Friends of New Germany in July 1933, although at least one newspaper article from April 1933 discusses their existence and also states that they held a lease which expired in May of that year, indicating that the group existed before the official date. An article from the time states that they were mostly German war veterans who supported the current republican government of Germany at the time of writing.The Jewish Telegraph Agency, April 30th 1933. https://www.jta.org/1933/04/30/archive/local-nazis-to-continue-propaganda- kiep-sails-after-talk-to-hitlerites Colonel Edwin Emerson acted as a spokesman for the group in April of that year, but later denied this in December. Colonel Emerson claimed that he had no connection to the German government, despite also being a correspondent for no less than 36 German government- controlled papers.The Jewish Telegraph Agency, December 3rd 1933 https://www.jta.org/1933/12/03/archive/colonel-edwin-emerson-denies-he-is- official-spokesman-for-the-nazi-party-in-america Assistance was given to its formation by the German consul in the City of New York. The organization took over the membership of two older pro-Hitler organizations in the United States, the Free Society of Teutonia and Gau-USA. The new entity was based in New York City, but had a strong presence in Chicago, Illinois. The Friends of New Germany was led by Spanknöbel and was openly pro-Hitler, and engaged in activities such as storming the German language newspaper New Yorker Staats- Zeitung with the demand that National Socialist-sympathetic articles be published, the infiltration of other non-political German-American organizations, and the use of propaganda to counter the Jewish boycott of businesses in the heavily German neighborhood of Yorkville, Manhattan. Members wore a uniform, a white shirt and black trousers for men with a black hat festooned with a red symbol. Women members wore a white blouse and a black skirt.IMDb Biography for Fritz Kuhn In an internal battle for control of the Friends, Spanknöbel was soon ousted as leader, and in October 1933 he was deported because he had failed to register as a foreign agent. At the same time, Congressman Samuel Dickstein (D-NY) was Chairman of the Committee on Naturalization and Immigration, where he became aware of the substantial number of foreigners legally and illegally entering and residing in the country, and the growing anti-Semitism along with vast amounts of anti-Semitic literature being distributed in the country. This led him to investigate independently the activities of National Socialism and other fascist groups. This led to the formation of the Special Committee on Un-American Activities Authorized to Investigate National Socialist Propaganda and Certain Other Propaganda Activities. Throughout the rest of 1934, the Committee conducted hearings, bringing before it most of the major figures in the US fascist movement. Dickstein's investigation concluded that the Friends represented a branch of German dictator Adolf Hitler's NSDAP in America.Investigation on un- American Propaganda Activities in the United States The organization existed into the mid-1930s with a membership of between 5,000-10,000, consisting mostly of German citizens living in America and German emigrants who only recently had become citizens. In December 1935, Rudolf Hess recalled the group's leaders to Germany and ordered all German citizens to leave the Friends of New Germany. By March 1936, Friends of New Germany was dissolved and its membership transferred to the newly-formed German American Bund, the new name being chosen to emphasise the group's American credentials after press criticism that the organisation was unpatriotic. The Bund was to consist only of American citizens of German descent.

The Bouncer had no secret identity, but was in reality a statue of the Greek mythological figure Antaeus (spelled Anteas in the comics). The statue had been sculpted by Adam Anteas, Jr., a descendant of the very same legendary figure. Like his Greek ancestor, Anteas Jr. gained power when in contact with the earth. Anteas Jr.'s power was that he bounced back whenever he struck the ground; the harder he hit, the higher he bounced. Unfortunately, like his ancestor, he lost his power when out of contact with the ground. The Bouncer appeared in five issues of his self-titled comic. The first issue (1944) didn't have an issue number; the other four were numbered #11 to 14 (Sept 1944 - Jan 1945). It's possible that the numbering was intended to be a continuation of The Green Mask. He is the first comic book character created by writer Robert Kanigher. Biography At first Anteas Jr. had no interest in superheroics, and generally wanted to be left alone with his statues. But whenever he was threatened, the spirit of his ancestor would animate the statue, and drag its creator off on an adventure. Eventually Anteas Jr. began to seek out criminals, and fight them with the aid of the Bouncer. One of his foes is a clown who claims to be Satan. He also fought gangsters trying to access a vein of gold buried underneath a cemetery, as well as a villain called the Gold Bug. Powers and abilities The Bouncer was an inanimate statue until animated by the spirit of Anteas. During that time, the Bouncer had superhuman strength and the ability to leap great distances.

His work uses familiar, even banal materials to ask the viewer to confront the boundary between daily life and art.  Early life  Fernandes was born in Trinidad. He came to Canada to art school in Montreal when he was 17yrs. old.  Career  Initially a painter, Fernandes turned to installation and multimedia to create situations that actively solicit participation from the viewer. Fernandes' texts and interventions explore this intersection of private life with public space. Fluxus suggested that everyday life should not be excluded from art. It encouraged a direct approach to creating work using the minimum amount of means required. Fernandes extends this approach to use everyday objects and experiences to provoke the viewer to make connections between the installation/performance and the spaces of the viewer's own life. It deliberately leaves room for the viewer to find their own approach to understanding the work, which can be uncomfortable for some. His approach has been compared to that of Jimmie Durham, David Medalla and David Hammons--all use wit and humour to illuminate attitudes and pre-conceptions based on ethnicity or race. Fernandes has little interest in preserving objects for posterity or in meeting the viewer's expectations. He is more concerned with an 'ephemeral expressive situation'. The challenge to the viewer is to return from Fernandes' work to experience the artistic moment in the viewer's own life. He is an instructor in intermedia at NSCAD University. Exhibitions He has exhibited extensively nationally, notably at the Blackwood Gallery, Mercer Union, The Power Plant, and YYZ (Toronto,ON); C.I.A.C. (Montreal Biennale); Articule, and Mai, (Montreal, QB), Dunlop Art Gallery (Regina, SK); The National Gallery of Canada, and Saw Gallery (Ottawa, ON); Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Eye Level Gallery, and Mount Saint Vincent Art Gallery (Halifax, NS); and internationally at P.S.1 (New York, NY); Art Public Calaf (Barcelona, Spain); In The Context of Art Biennale (Warsaw, Poland). His work was included in Traffic: Conceptual Art in Canada 1965-1980, the nationally touring exhibition.

Based on the terms of the treaty, the Dutch Republic recognized Portuguese imperial sovereignty over New Holland (Dutch Brazil) in exchange for an indemnity of 4 million reis, conversion from 2 million Caroli Guilders, over the span of 16 years.Facsimile of the treaty:Articulen van vrede en Confoederarie, Gheslooten Tusschen den Doorluchtighsten Comingh van Portugael ter eenre, ende de Hoogh Mogende Heeren Staten General ...;  History  In 1648-49 the Luso-Brazilians defeated the Dutch in the first and second battles of Guararapes, and gradually recovered the Portuguese colonies of Brazil and Angola. In addition, the wars between England and the Dutch Republic were weakening Dutch power everywhere. In January 1654 the Dutch surrendered and signed the Treaty of Taborda, but only as a provisory pact (truce). With the end of the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch Republic began, in May 1654, to demand New Holland back. The Grand Pensionary of Holland Johan de Witt did not agree with these strong-arm tactics because he thought that commerce was more important than the possession of territories. Therefore, a peace treaty was signed on 6 August 1661 at The Hague whereby New Holland was sold to Portugal for the equivalent of 63 tonnes of gold. The treaty later led to a deal over Dutch Java and Portugal's East Timor. The Dutch promised not to enter or claim Timor for the Treaty of The Hague stated none of these powers would declare war on each other or claim or enter their territory or colonies.

He received a master's degree in Psychology at the University of British Columbia and a Ph.D in Anatomy from Erasmus University in 1978, as well as in the Department of Anatomy at the University of Toronto in 1980. Van der Kooy gained postdoctoral research experience at Cambridge University and at the Salk Institute in California. In 1981, he became an Assistant Professor, was promoted to Associate Professor in 1986, and has served as Professor in the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology at the University of Toronto from 1991 until 2002, when he became a Professor in the Department of Medical Genetics and Microbiology. His lab is the Neurobiology Research Group. His lab in the Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, carries out various neuroscience and developmental biology research projects. In 1994 his paper on neural stem cells in the adult mammalian forebrain was published in the journal Neuron. This work first established that adult mammalian neural stem cells were located in the subependyma of the forebrain lateral ventricle, where two types of lineage related precursor cells, progenitor cells and stem cells, were shown to be present. Proliferation of these cell types were characterized in further experiments that were reported in articles in Development and the Journal of Neuroscience. Of note, Derek's lab produced the first report of stem cells in the adult mammalian eye, published in 2000 in Science. Further work, which was published in the journal, Neuron, 2001, documented how embryonic stem cells were shown to differentiate directly to neural stem cells through a default mechanism. Derek's lab continues to investigate the nature of stem cells, embryonic and adult, the concept of immortal cells, and the differentiation of embryonic stem cells, capable of forming any tissue in the body, to neural stem cells. A report published in Science by Dr. Derek van der Kooy's research group demonstrated that BDNF, when infused into the ventral tegmental area (VTA), can induce an opiate- dependent-like reward state in animals in the absence of opiate administration. Previous studies have demonstrated that the opiate reward is mediated by a dopamine-independent reward system in nondependent animals, and by a dopamine-dependent reward system in dependent animals. In the present study, infusions of BDNF into the VTA were able to shift opiate reward from a dopamine-independent system to a dopamine-dependent system. This switch is mediated through a specific change in GABA-A receptors in the VTA from inhibitory to excitatory signaling in response to increased BDNF. This work suggests that BDNF may play a critical role in mediating the shift to a drug- dependent motivational state, a crucial step in the pathogenesis of drug addiction. Based on his experiments with human cadaveric pancreata, van der Kooy holds theorizes that there exists an adult stem cell in the pancreas.

Russell played in the first team in the 1966 season but saw less action on the 1967 season when Derbyshire were in sixth place. Russell played for Derbyshire solidly for another decade, until the 1979 season, though he came out of retirement six years later to play briefly in the 1985 season, as a 41-year-old. He continued playing in the 1986 season in the one-day game for Derbyshire. Less agile, and supplemented by Derbyshire's Danish wonder, Ole Mortensen, Russell brought no shame upon himself in his later years. Russell was a right-arm medium pace bowler and took 339 first-class wickets at an average of 30.53 and a best performance of 7-46.

The school was established as part of Horry County Schools for gifted education in 2003. About the Program Scholars Academy was established in 2003 through a partnership between Horry County Schools and Coastal Carolina University. The goal of the Scholars Academy is to educate top-achieving students. Students from nearby high schools in Horry County attend the program in order to complete courses of a higher academic rigor. Students take a combination of required high school classes taught by county-employed teachers, Honors and AP courses taught by county-employed teachers, and college classes taught by Coastal Carolina University professors. Students may finish the \\"program\\" with over two years of college credit while still receiving a high school diploma from their base school. This process has changed as of the 2019-2020 school year. In 2012, Horry County Schools began building a new building in cooperation with Coastal Carolina University. The new building was completed in December 2013; the first day of school in the new building was on January 6th, 2014. Students now attend most classes within this new building. In October 2019, Horry County Schools voted to separate Scholars from HCS base schools. This means that as of the 2023-2024 school year, Scholars Academy will become a separate high school. =Application and Acceptance= The entrance process consists of first sending an application. One can apply if he or she is a part of the honors or advanced curriculum at an Horry County middle school. When applying for admittance into Scholars Academy, applicants must consider factors such as the increased amount of homework, a higher level of academic rigor, and attending school with a new group of people. The Scholars Academy selects candidates for continuation to the second stage of the application process based on their written applications, PSAT scores, EXPLORE scores, MAP scores, discipline records, and more. A select few will be chosen for an interview and an essay scheduled at the main building or at the applicant's middle school. If the applicant is accepted to Scholars Academy, they are then sent an acceptance letter and asked to attend an informational meeting where they will receive a Coastal Carolina University application form, an acceptance confirmation form, and summer reading information. Before the upcoming school year, accepted students receive their schedules and supply lists in the mail along with Freshman Orientation date and time information. Clubs and Organizations The Scholars Academy promotes and sponsors many different clubs and organizations. The diverse nature of the student body lends itself to a variety of different groups. For example, the Biology Club is an ongoing science club that has been dedicated to bacteriophage research. The Scholars Academy publishes a yearbook each year titled The Aegis; though not a club, the yearbook staff meets during, and occasionally after, school. =National Honor Society= As of 2010, the Scholars Academy has established its own chapter of the National Honor Society, sponsored by Christina Lambert. Its primary philanthropy focus is the Street Reach Mission of Myrtle Beach. =We The People= Students at Scholars Academy have competed in the We The People Competition after taking various history classes. Coached by Georgia Holley, the Scholars Academy has won 100% of the state competitions that they have entered, becoming the South Carolina State Champions in 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. Holley has coached the best We The People teams in the high school's history, some winning a record of 6 out of the 6 \\"unit\\" awards at the state competition. =Biology Club= The Scholars Academy Biology Club is a community service organization devoted to exploring scientific concepts and tutoring Honors Biology students. Members of Biology Club are able to attend annual field trips, such as the 2010 trip to the United States National Whitewater Center. The club is sponsored by Mr. Ryan Carter. =Scholars Squad= The small student/teacher population at the Scholars Academy allows for a close student-teacher relationship. Students are often included in decision-making at Scholars through the elected Scholars Squad. Similar to a student government, elections are held annually to choose representatives for each grade level. The representative who wins the most votes becomes class president. As of 2019, elected representatives choose the student body president, acting in the manner of an electoral college. The president and other members of Scholars Squad organize many school activities such as spirit weeks, canned food drives, and more. =Debate Club= The Scholars Academy Debate Club is an organization devoted to fostering healthy debate and conversation among students. Students tackle topics which are of local, national, or international concern such as foreign, economic, or social policy.

Reputedly intended to become the \\"most powerful\\" cruiser in the Confederate fleet once her guns were mounted, she was never used in battle. On her maiden voyage from Scotland, where she was built, she encountered Union Navy ships engaged in a blockade of Charleston, South Carolina, and was heavily damaged before being scuttled by her captain. The wreck was discovered in 1965 and lies in the shallow waters of Charleston's harbor. Due to the secrecy surrounding the vessel's construction, loading and sailing, there has been much speculation about her intended role, whether as a cruiser, merchantman, or privateer. Specifications Georgiana was a brig-rigged, iron hulled, propeller steamer of with a jib and two heavily raked masts, hull and stack painted black. Her clipper bow sported the figurehead of a \\"demi-woman\\". Georgiana was reportedly pierced for fourteen guns and could carry more than four hundred tons of cargo. She was built by the Lawrie shipyard at Glasgow - perhaps under subcontract from Lairds of Birkenhead (Liverpool) - and registered at that port in December 1862 as belonging to N. Matheson's Clyde service. The U.S. Consul at Tenerife was rightly apprehensive of her as being \\"evidently a very swift vessel.\\" Captain Thomas Turner, station commodore, reported to Admiral S. F. du Pont that Georgiana was evidently \\"sent into Charleston to receive her officers, to be fitted out as a cruiser there. She had 140 men on board, with an armament of guns and gun carriages in her hold, commanded by a British naval retired officer.\\" Loss Wreck Chart by E. Lee Spence showing the location and a cross section of the wreck of the GeorgianaArtifacts recovered from the wrecks of Georgiana and Mary Bowers The Georgiana was lost on the night of 19 March 1863, while attempting to run past the Federal Blockading Squadron and into Charleston, South Carolina. She had been spotted by the armed U.S. Yacht (of the famed America's Cup racing trophy) which alerted the remainder of the blockade fleet by shooting up colored signal flares. The Georgiana was sunk after a desperate chase in which she came so close to the big guns aboard the that her crew even heard the orders being given on the U.S. vessel. With solid shot passing entirely though her hull, her propeller and rudder damaged, and with no hope for escape, Capt. A. B. Davidson flashed a white light in token of surrender, thus gaining time to beach his ship in fourteen feet (4.3 m) of water, three-quarters of a mile (1200 m) from shore and, after first scuttling her, escaped on the land side with all hands; this was construed as \\"the most consummate treachery\\" by the disappointed blockading crew, who would have shared in the proceeds from the prize. Lt. Comdr. John L. Davis, commanding Wissahickon decided to set the wreck afire lest guerrilla bands from shore try to salvage her or her cargo: she burned for several days accompanied by large black powder explosions. Georgiana and her cargo were owned by banking and shipping magnate George Alfred Trenholm of Charleston, who was Treasurer of the Confederacy and the primary historical figure behind the fictional Rhett Butler in Gone With The Wind.\\"I protagonisti di Via col vento sono davvero esistiti\\" di Luca Dini, Oggi 5 dicembre, 1994, pp. 38-40, 42-43\\"Discovery of the real Rhett Butler\\"Treasures of the Confederate Coast: The \\"Real Rhett Butler\\" & Other Revelations, by Dr. E.

Both ships were constructed of iron, but one was built with extra reinforcing and relatively deep draft such as would be needed for operation as a privateer on the high seas and the other of extremely light weight and shallow draft that was perfectly suited for the purpose of running the blockade, which required crossing shallow shoals to evade the deeper draft vessels of the blockade fleet. One (the Georgiana) is a screw steamer and the other (the Mary Bowers) a sidewheel steamer. The two ships were built and lost in a time span of about two years, making their design differences even more significant.\\"Underwater Archeology on the Georgiana,\\" (\\"Salvage of the Georgiana\\"), by E.

Due to the secrecy surrounding her construction, loading and sailing, there is considerable question as to whether the Georgiana was simply a merchantman or if she was intended as a privateer or blockade runner.

She is new and said to be a very superior steamer. ··· Yesterday while lying here she had the Rebel flag flying at her mast.\\" The London American took special note of her in its 28 January 1863 edition as a powerful steamer and remarked that her officers wore gold lace on their caps, considered a sure indication she was being groomed for a man-of-war. After the Georgianas loss on 19 March 1863, the United States Secretary of Navy wrote: \\"the destruction of the Georgiana not only touched their (the Confederate's) pockets, but their hopes.

Thomas Scharf, (New York: Rogers & Sherwood; San Francisco: A. L. Bancroft; Atlanta: W. H. Shepard), p. 802 Underwater archaeologist E. Lee Spence, who discovered the wreck and identified it as the Georgiana, believes that she was indeed intended as a privateer or cruiser due to the naval guns found aboard, her deep draft hull construction, her heavier than standard iron planking, and the closer than normal, doubled up, Z-beam, framing used throughout the vessel.Treasures of the Confederate Coast: The \\"Real Rhett Butler\\" & Other Revelations, by Dr. E.

Oat Mountain is the highest peak in the Santa Susana Mountains of California. The Los Angeles district of Chatsworth is to the south of the mountain. There are many microwave relay antennas as well as Doppler weather equipment at Oat Mountain. SoCal Gas has several wells in the area as well. Climate The climate on Oat Mountain varies from season to season. During the start of the year in January, occasional rain showers and thunderstorms may pass over the mountain. Cold storms produce light snow on the peaks of the mountain, when the snow level drops under 4,000 feet. Going into spring the weather may change. Some years it may be very dry on the mountain causing a lack of vegetation. In other years though the springtime could bring heavy storms with upwards of 4\\" of rain and some snow. The summer has dry periods and occasional thunderstorms (brought in by sub-tropical moisture in the Pacific Ocean) from the floors of the San Fernando Valley and Santa Clarita Valley. This may bring flash flooding and debris flows from burn scars in the area. Fall is typically dry and sunny but Santa Ana Winds can cause small wildfires to start on the mountain. Flora and fauna Wildlife in the area is very sparse in summer months (though occasionally a bear can be spotted). Oat Mountain has typically the same type of flora and fauna found elsewhere in the Mountain range. Mountain lions are particularly common in the region and can be seen almost all year round along with birds like the turkey vulture and the Canada goose. Vegetation is not very diverse on the mountain. The mountain is usually covered in brown grass and oats in the summer but during heavy periods of rain the mountain is usually green and contains more wildlife. Human interference Oat Mountain has had many major problems in modern times starting in 1971 with the construction of two missile sites called \\"The Nike Missile Test Site(s)\\". Since then it was heavily contaminated and debris and abandoned buildings litter that area. In 2015, a story made headlines when a gas leak was reported at one of the seven oil fields littering the natural areas of the mountain. The Aliso Canyon Oil Field was involved in this situation. Many people reported nose bleeds, strong headaches, and other symptoms. That same year the oil field was shut down and taken to court. As of August 2017, the oil field is scheduled to reopen but may be taken to the city regional court in Los Angeles or to the federal court in Sacramento. Hiking and destinations Oat Mountain has many hiking trails and scenic destinations. One of the main hiking trails ascends the San Fernando Valley side of the mountain and has four different connecting trails. One of these leads to the Nike Missile Site with abandoned buildings, vehicles, and rubble surrounding it. One expert route up the mountain follows the backbone of the mountain in Santa Clarita but is difficult because it is forested. The last trail is a 16-mile hike between Rocky Peak and Oat Mountain.

In the United Kingdom, they are known as biscuit barrels or biscuit jars. If they are cans made out of tinplate, they are called biscuit tins. While used to store actual cookies or biscuits, they are sometimes employed to store other edible items like candy or dog treats, or non-edible items like currency (in the manner of a piggy bank). Origin and history Cookie jars, also known as biscuit barrels or jars, have been used in England since the latter part of the 18th century. They were often made of glass with metal lids. Cookie jars became popular in America around the time of the Great Depression in 1929. Early American cookie jars were made of glass with metal screw-on lids. In the 1930s, stoneware became predominant as the material for American cookie jars. Early cookie jars typically have simple cylindrical shapes and were often painted with floral or leaf decorations or emblazoned with colorful decals. The Brush Pottery Company of Zanesville, Ohio is generally recognized as producing the first ceramic cookie jar. The jar was green with the word \\"Cookies\\" embossed on the front. Most cookie jar manufacturers followed Brush's move to ceramics in the late 1930s, and designs became more innovative with figures, fruits, vegetables, animals, and other whimsical interpretations such as the Hull \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" predominating. The golden period for American cookie jar production covers the years from 1940 until 1970, with several manufacturers rising to prominence. A cookie jar style container, used to hold dog treats.

These were in a multitude of shapes and figures. Most were purchased at flea markets. Warhol's collection was featured in a prominent news magazine and sparked an interest in collecting cookie jars. When asked in the 1970s why he pursued the 1930s and 1940s jars, Warhol said simply, \\"They are time pieces.\\" At an auction of his apartment's contents in 1987, Warhol's collection of cookie jars realized $250,000.

Samba reggae, as its name suggests, was originally derived as a blend of Brazilian samba with Jamaican reggae as typified by Bob Marley. History and background Samba-reggae arose in the context of the black pride movement that occurred in the city of Salvador de Bahia, around the 69, and it still carries connotations of ethnic identity and pride for Afro-Brazilians today. Bahia's population has a large proportion of dark-skinned Brazilians who are descendants of African slaves who were brought to Brazil by the Portuguese in the 17th and 18th centuries. These Afro-Brazilians played a major role in the early development of samba, which first took form in a Bahian style of dance and music called \\"samba de roda\\", probably in the late 19th century. Samba de roda was brought to Rio de Janeiro by Bahians around 1900, where it was combined with harmonic and rhythmic elements from European influences (such as chorinho and military marches). By the 1930s, samba de roda had developed into the faster, more harmonically complex Rio-style samba that is now played in Rio's Carnival. Through the middle of the 20th century this new Rio-style samba spread throughout Brazil. Of note, the low pitch bass that was heard on beats 1 and 3, and the higher pitched surdo on beats 2 and 4 in Bahia, brought by the slaves, was changed in Samba-the low pitch was moved to beats 2 and 4. The paradoxical result was that samba was brought back to Bahia from Rio, but now in a highly altered form, and no longer associated with Afro-Brazilians. Thus, in the mid-20th century, the city of Salvador had many samba schools that were modeled on the samba schools of Rio, as well as blocos (informal street percussion groups), both of which performed Rio-style samba in Carnival parades every year. Yet, ironically, black Brazilians did not participate in these Carnival parades or in the blocos, since they were not allowed to participate. Samba-reggae represents an effort by black Brazilians to develop a Carnival parade music that they could call their own, and to form all-black or mostly-black blocos with which they could parade during Carnival. The afro bloco music was very different because they aimed to recreate and strengthen their community through their music. History =Ilê Aiyê= Ilê Aiyê, was founded in 1974. Like many blocos, they are not just a large band but also a community group with an active social focus. They paraded in the 1975 Carnival, with a new music that was quite literally a blend of samba and reggae. Ilê Aiyê's founders aimed to create a music blending influences from the revered Jamaican artists, Bob Marley and Jimmy Cliff, with elements of the older, Bahian style of samba (samba de roda). Ilê Aiyê wanted to distinguish their music from the increasingly rapid samba of Rio de Janeiro, so they deliberately chose a slower tempo than is used in Rio, and avoided the high- pitched percussion instruments that are particularly associated with the Rio Carnival (cuíca and tamborim). These musical choices were consciously made as a political statement. All of Ilê Aiyê's lyrics always have political and social content, and typically profile some aspect of African history. Many other afro blocos were founded shortly afterwards, and all played the same rhythmic pattern. At the time, it was known simply as \\"the music of the afro blocos\\" or \\"the rhythm of Ile Aiye\\". Musically, Ilê Aiyê's major innovations to samba were the addition of a new 3rd surdo playing rapid rolls with two mallets, the addition of a reggae backbeat played by the snare drums (caixas), and the creation of a new clave pattern that is a blend of samba-de-roda clave with a reggae backbeat. They retained many aspects of samba, such as samba's 3 surdos, and a repinique (repique) pattern that was played with hand and stick. =Olodum= The second major development in this new genre occurred in 1979, with the founding of the influential group Olodum. This group was founded as a bloco afro, which is a \\"Bahian Carnival Association highlighting African heritage through music, dance theater, and art.\\"Olodum By 1986 they had established themselves as the premier performers of a new genre of music. Olodum was led during these years by the leader Mestre Neguinho do Samba, who had previously been drum leader for Ilê Aiyê. Neguinho introduced a key innovation: the old, samba-derived, style of playing the repinique, with hand and stick, was eliminated, and the repiniques switched instead to playing rapid rolls with two wood or plastic rods. This style of playing is derived from Candomblé, an Afro-Brazilian religion. The resulting rapid-fire clatter of the repiniques, along with the distinctive driving roll of the 3rd surdo, gives samba-reggae an unmistakable sound. During the carnival of 1986, this new style of music, known as samba-reggae, made its debut. Olodum had combined the traditional samba with sounds from a number of other Caribbean music genres, including: merengue, salsa, and reggae. The toques, or \\"drumming patterns\\", that categorized the samba-reggae beat was composed of \\"a pattern in which the surdo bass drums divided themselves into four or five interlocking parts. Against this, the high-pitched repiques and caixes filled out the pattern with fixed and repeated rhythms in a slow tempo, imitating the shuffle feel of reggae.\\"Behague, Gerard. \\"Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985-95).\\" Latin American Music Review 27, no. 1 (Spring/Summer 2006): 79-90. In 1986, the phrase \\"samba-reggae\\" was used for the first time to describe the music of Olodum, and, by extension, of the other afro blocos as well. Olodum became progressively more well known, and recorded with Paul Simon, Michael Jackson, and many prominent Brazilian musicians. Over time, most afro blocos converted to Olodum's style of playing the repinique. In the 1990s, Ilê Aiyê finally converted to the Olodum two-rod style. =Timbalada, Axé, and modern samba- reggae= In the 1990s, the samba-reggae genre continued to evolve with the group Timbalada, which, under the musical direction of Carlinhos Brown, revived the nearly-extinct folk drum timbal (a tall, high-pitched hand drum) and begin to use it in stage shows. Timbalada also developed a rack of 3 surdos and 1 repinique that could be mounted on a stage and played by a single player. This device is known as a \\"bateria de surdo\\", a drumset of surdos. (The 3rd and 4th surdo parts were combined in a single drum.) Timbalada is a stage band and not exactly a Carnival street bloco, though they first appeared in the Carnival of 1992. Their music is considered to be a blend of samba- reggae with African elements. Many afro blocos now use the timbal, as well the rack of 3 surdos for stage situations that do not involve parades. In the 1990s, a style of pop music that was influenced by samba-reggae in its creation, is known as Axé Music (ah-SHEH) was popularized by such singers as Daniela Mercury, Margareth Menezes, Armandinho and others. Musical characteristics: General characteristics Samba-reggae is played in medium tempo around 90-120 beats per minute. The surdos (bass drums) play a 2/4 rhythm with swing time while other instruments provide contrasting rhythms in straight and syncopated time. On the whole, samba-reggae is straighter (less syncopated), slower, and less swung than Rio-style samba. There are many styles of samba-reggae, distinguished by different clave patterns. Olodum's three original styles (samba-reggae, reggae, and merengue) are still played today. Ile Aiye sometimes still plays its old version of samba-reggae; and in addition, Ile Aiye also frequently plays merengue-like patterns that are known in North America as \\"afrosamba\\". In addition, samba-reggae groups may also play styles derived from the original Bahian samba-de-roda, from its modern urban descendant (\\"samba duro\\"), or from axé pop music. Instrumentation There are typical 3 or 4 surdo (bass drum) parts in samba-reggae. The surdos are 50 cm deep, shorter drum than the classic Rio size of 60 cm. Surdos in samba-reggae are usually worn quite low on the body with a waist strap; in Rio they are more likely to be worn higher and with a shoulder strap. In samba- reggae, the first (largest-diameter) and second (next largest) surdos keep the beat, typically with the lowest drum hitting beat 2 and the higher drum hitting beat 1. Together, the first and second surdos of samba-reggae are known as the \\"fundos\\", the back, presumably because they always stand in the back row of the samba-reggae band. The third surdo plays the classic third- surdo part of samba. The fourth surdo is tuned very tightly and plays rapid 16th-note rolls with two mallets, which gives samba-reggae its unmistakable rumbling sound. Some modern afro blocos are eliminating the third-surdo part or combining it with the fourth-surdo part. The rest of a samba-reggae band is usually composed primarily of snare drums (caixas), and repiniques (a slightly longer, high-pitched drum with no snare/strings; also called \\"repique\\"). These may play a reggae backbeat, son clave, bossa clave, \\"Brazilian clave\\" (Mocidade/merengue style), or a variety of other clave patterns, depending on the particular piece of music being played. Samba-reggae repiniques are typically 25-cm or 20-cm (10-inch, 8-inch) in diameter so are slightly smaller-diameter than the 30-cm (12-inch) repiniques of Rio, and are worn lower down on the body, and are played with two long plastic sticks. The repinique may also play loud variations, rolls, and improvisation fills, similar to the role of the third surdo in Rio-style samba. It also plays call- ins to start the entire band. Typically only 1 lead repinique player does these fills and calls; other players do not alter their parts outside of their set arrangement. A drum leader, or mestre, leads the entire band with hand cues and/or a whistle. In Olodum, the mestre typically leads with hand cues only and no whistle; this was Neguinho's style of leading. Olodum only uses caixas, repiniques and surdos. Other groups may incorporate additional instruments, such as timbal, atabaque, and tamborim. Samba-reggae bands frequently number 100 drummers or more, plus an amplified singer and a small band who ride on a sound truck. Dance Samba-reggae has given rise to a style of African-influenced dance derived from Afro-Brazilian and candomble dance moves. In a social setting, samba-reggae dances tend to be done in a follow-the-leader fashion, with a few skilled dancers initiating moves in a line in front of the crowd, and the whole crowd then following along. In addition, samba-reggae drummers often dance while they drum. The third- and fourth-surdos do short choreographies, using their mallets to emphasize arm moves. Most dramatically, the fundos (first and second surdos) frequently take center stage to do elaborate, showy mallet lifts and throws, and tossing their huge drums high overhead.

Gražina Ašembergiene. \\"209 kartus gyvas\\". December 4, 1995 (Lithuanian newspaper) Every kill was recorded in an individual \\"sniper's book\\" and had to be confirmed by at least one observer and authenticated by the battalion commander. Facsimile copies of various diary pages are reproduced in Sutkus' memoir. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Sutkus held lectures for Lithuanian soldiers and presented his wartime records to Lithuanian officers. Biography Sutkus was born in Tannenwalde, then a suburb of Königsberg, East Prussia. His father was Lithuanian, which meant that Sutkus was not automatically German, German nationality had to be applied for. Since no application was made he remained officially stateless until 1941 when he became a naturalized German. He joined the Hitler Youth in 1938, achieving the rank of a Scharführer. When he was 18 years old he became a member of the SA, where his shooting skills were acknowledged, and he was given a rifle to take home and practise marksmanship. Sutkus trained as a sniper from August 1943 through the end of December 1943 at the Sniper School in Vilnius, before being assigned to the 196th Grenadier Regiment of the 68th Infantry Division. In January 1945 while recovering from a wound he was promoted and informed that he had been appointed as an instructor at a sniper school. In his autobiography, Sutkus describes that after the war he came into contact with the anti-Soviet Lithuanian resistance, how he was captured and tortured by the KGB. He was in possession of forged documents declaring him to be stateless and of having worked throughout the war as a farm labourer, but knew the Russians suspected him of having served in the Wehrmacht as a sniper. So Sutkus decided to stay together with several Lithuanians he knew who were deported to Siberia for forced labor, partly to escape Soviet attentions, and expecting to be deported anyway. By the time the Russians had the evidence to prosecute him for the war crime of being a sniper, West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer had negotiated amnesties for many Germans being detained in the Soviet Union. He worked on collectives, in the Taiga forests and down the pits at Sheernkov from 1949 until 1971 when he was allowed to relocate to Vilnius. Sutkus went into voluntary banishment to accompany a Lithuanian woman, Antanina, (d. 1995) nineteen years his senior, who had been linked to the resistance. He had a son, Vytautas, by her in 1951. In 1991, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Sutkus, now Lithuanian after having been forced to accept Soviet citizenship, visited Germany. In 1994 he received a certificate of German citizenship and passport, and relocated to Germany in 1997.

Over the next few seasons, he was unable to establish himself as a first choice player although he did make two appearances in the quarter-finals of the European Cup Winners' Cup against Anderlecht in March 1977. He was an uncompromising tackler and was at his best when given a particular opponent to shadow and was often brought in to the side to perform a specific man-marking task. He rarely got forward into attack, but the few goals that he did score were usually fairly special. On 5 March 1977, he scored the winner against Charlton Athletic, when he crashed a shot past the keeper after running on to a return pass from Mick Channon. In the 1977–78 season, he was selected fairly regularly including appearing in the final 13 games as Saints finished as runners-up (to Bolton Wanderers) to gain promotion back to Division 1. His finest game for the Saints was against Birmingham City in the Football League Cup on 29 August 1978, when he shackled Trevor Francis so well that Saints were able to notch up a 5–2 victory, which set them on the way to the League Cup final at Wembley against Nottingham Forest on 17 March 1979. Although Andruszewski had featured in several of the earlier games, he didn't even make the bench for the final. Tampa Bay Rowdies Andruszewski spent most of the summer of 1979 on loan to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the NASL appearing in 16 games and was a starter in Soccer Bowl '79. Back in England he continued to make occasional appearances over the next season, before being transferred for £150,000 to Tampa Bay in May 1980. His period in the USA was not a great success and was cut short by illness. He briefly returned to The Dell in 1982, although he made no further first-team appearances. In all he made exactly 100 appearances for Southampton's first team, scoring 3 goals. Aldershot In the season 1982–83, he signed for Aldershot, and then returned to the US to join the Houston Dynamos for the summer of 1984, and then the Dallas Sidekicks indoor soccer team from November 1984 to May 1985. After football After retiring from football, he worked for Peter Green furniture stores and in 2005 he set up his own gardening business in Eastleigh.

Denbeaux (born July 30, 1943 in Gainesville, Florida) is an American attorney, professor, and author. He is a law professor at Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark, New Jersey and the Director of its Center for Policy and Research. He is best known for his reports on the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and its operations. Denbeaux has testified to Congress about the findings of the Center's reports. He and his son, Joshua Denbeaux, are the legal representatives of two Tunisian detainees at Guantanamo. He is also the lead Civilian Military Commission Counsel for two detainees who were tortured by the Central Intelligence Agency in black sites prior to their detainment. Denbeaux is an expert in forensics and has testified as an expert witness in cases across the country. Denbeaux also is a practicing attorney in the family law firm of Denbeaux & Denbeaux in Westwood, New Jersey.  Early life and education  Mark Denbeaux at the March towards Selma Mark Denbeaux was born on July 30, 1943, in Gainesville, Florida. He attended local schools before going to the Commonwealth School. Denbeaux received his B.A. from College of Wooster in 1965. An active supporter of civil rights in the 1960s, Denbeaux participated in the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Denbeaux later founded a NAACP chapter in Wooster. The Wooster NAACP eventually became the Wooster Orville NAACP because it was too large to be run by students. He was later honored and asked to speak at the 50th anniversary Freedom Dinner in 2015. He participated in the Selma to Montgomery marches for voting rights in 1965.Di Ionno, mark. \\"The Selma march and the fascinating story behind an iconic photo\\", The Star-Ledger, March 4, 2015. Accessed November 23, 2017. \\"The historic photo is a little grainy, produced in black-and-white. That was not by choice, as some artistic metaphor; color photography in 1965 was expensive to print. The picture was part of Ebony magazine's coverage of the third Alabama voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery, which began on March 21, 1965.... 'My father was a combat chaplain with (Gen. George) Patton's 3rd Army,' Denbeaux said during an interview at his home in Woodcliff Lake.\\" He attended New York University School of Law, where he received his J.D. in 1968. Career =Early career= After graduating from NYU Law School in 1968, Denbeaux became a founding member of the South Bronx Legal Services. He served as the citywide coordinator for the Community Action for Legal Services, New York's organization of antipoverty lawyers, from 1970 to 1972. During this time he also filed complaints against judges for hostility towards poor people. During the 1970s and early 1980s, Denbeaux represented Black Panther Party in The Bronx and Manhattan with Jeffrey Brand, now the Dean of the University of San Francisco School of Law. He represented the Young Lords in the Bronx during their takeover of Lincoln Hospital. In the early 1970s, Denbeaux represented a number of U.S. soldiers charged with disobeying orders during the Vietnam War and the anti-war movement. He defended some in courts martial. =Seton Hall University School of Law= In 1972, Denbeaux joined the Seton Hall Law School Faculty. He has taught courses including Evidence, Remedies, Uniform Commercial Code, Contracts, Professional Responsibility, Federal Civil Procedure, Torts, and Constitutional Law. He has been an elected member of the American Law Institute since 1980. In 2006, Denbeaux founded the Center for Policy and Research at Seton Hall University Law School. This work was originally inspired by Denbeaux's pro bono representation of two Guantanamo detainees. He and his son are among more than 100 attorneys who have represented detainees there. The Center produces analytic reports in three key areas: interrogations and intelligence, national security, and forensics. Under Denbeaux's supervision, students working as research fellows in teams develop skills in pattern recognition, factual evaluation, and data analysis; Seton Hall University has published their original reports on issues concerning law and public policy. Denbeaux is well known for the Center's Guantanamo Reports, studies of United States operations and policies at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp; by late 2009, fifteen studies had been published in this series. The law research fellows have systematically analyzed data published by the Department of Defense; they have reviewed more than 100,000 pages of government documents procured through the Freedom of Information Act. The first report was a statistical analysis of characteristics of the 517 detainees held in 2005. The Guantanamo Reports have been widely cited and published globally. =Guantanamo Bay= In 2005, Denbeaux began representing two Tunisian detainees, Rafiq Bin Bashir Bin Jalud Al Hami and Lufti Bin Ali. In 2009, al Hami was released to Slovakia. In 2011, bin Ali was released to Kazakhstan. In 2009, he began his pro bono representation of two more detainees, Abu Zubaydah and Mohamad Farik Amin. Denbeaux represented them in their habeas corpus petitions and remains the lead civilian defense counsel for both detainees. He has testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as a variety of House and Senate subcommittees, regarding Guantanamo Bay and national security issues. =Forensics= Denbeaux is an expert in forensic testimony. He teaches an upper-level seminar at Seton Hall Law on forensic evidence. The course evaluates the reliability of experts who testify as to handwriting identification, fingerprint identification, ballistics, tool marks, blood spatter, bite marks, and other crime scene forensic evidence and witnesses. The analysis of these areas includes an evaluation of the reliability and validity of each area's conclusions, the value of each area's proficiency testing, and the methodology upon which the conclusions are reached. In order to fully evaluate forensic evidence, the Center has established a crime laboratory, certified by the requisite proficiency tests. Its representatives have given expert opinions about the methodology used by specific forensic fields in court. Its written reports have been used in court proceedings. A significant part of the seminar includes participating in these projects. Denbeaux has spoken on the subject of forensic science at dozens of academic gatherings and has testified as an expert witness on the limitations of forensic evidence more than fifty times in state and federal courts as well as in administrative proceedings. His testimony has been cited in published cases in addition to the Third and Eleventh Circuits (U.S. v. Yagman and U.S. v. Pettus). ;U.S. v. Yagman Denbeaux offered testimony questioning the reliability of handwriting analysis in this 2007 trial. His testimony was limited to his observations about the limitations and/or flaws in handwriting analysis generally, not as specifically applicable to the facts in Yagman. ;U.S. v. Hines Denbeaux served as an expert witness in U.S. v. Hines, in which the government's motion to exclude Denbeaux's testimony was deemed moot. The government argued that Denbeaux's testimony did not meet the standards of Daubert and Kumho, while Denbeaux concluded that there is no need for expert testimony on handwriting analysis as it has never been proven reliable. ;U.S. v. Ruth In U.S. v. Ruth, the issue in question was whether the military judge abused his discretion by denying production of Denbeaux, who was slated to testify as an expert critic of handwriting analysis. =High-profile cases= Denbeaux defended Sydney Biddle Barrows, the \\"Mayflower Madam,\\" in 1984. Barrows ran Cachet, an escort service in New York City, from 1979 until 1984, when the service was shut down. She was charged with promoting prostitution by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office. She eventually pleaded guilty. In 1997, Denbeaux served as a forensic expert for the trial of Timothy McVeigh, charged with bombing the Oklahoma Federal Building. =Private practice= Denbeaux serves as Attorney of Counsel for the family law firm Denbeaux and Denbeaux. Personal life The son of a combat chaplain who served with the Third United States Army during World War II. Denbeaux has been a resident of Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey.

He played as a Centre back during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Playing career =Southampton= Born in Emsworth, Hampshire, Waldron was initially spotted playing for Havant and Hampshire school teams and was snapped up by Southampton, joining them as an apprentice in July 1973 before signing professional papers on reaching 18 in September 1974. He made his debut on 12 April 1975 in a 0–0 draw away to Nottingham Forest. He made 3 appearances that season and 2 the following before establishing himself as a regular member of the Saints' defence in 1976–77. Although he could play anywhere in the back four, his best position was as sweeper, with his strength lying mainly in heading and tackling. Waldron is described in Holley & Chalk's The Alphabet of the Saints as being \\"extememly agile and lithe for a big man, he also packed a thunderbolt of a shot and scored some memorable gals for the club\\". During Southampton's promotion season 1977–78, he played \\"second fiddle\\" to Chris Nicholl and Mike Pickering and was often replaced by Manny Andruszewski in the centre of defence. He really came to the fore in Saints' first season back in Division 1, when he was an ever-present. He also played in all of Southampton's matches as they reached the final of the League Cup in 1979, only to lose 3–2 in the final. He was voted Saints' \\"Player of the Season\\" for 1978–79 and in the following season he was called up for the England B team against New Zealand. The following season, he lost his place to David Watson as Lawrie McMenemy once again started to re-build the Southampton team. Injury forced him to miss most of the 1980–81 season in which Saints finished in sixth place in Division 1, thus qualifying for European football. He spent the summer of 1981 playing in the United States for Washington Diplomats before returning to The Dell. His return was disappointing and a succession of irritating injuries and a loss of form led to a transfer to Burnley for £90,000 in September 1983. Waldron made a total of 218 appearances for Southampton over 8 years, scoring 11 goals. =Burnley and Portsmouth= His brief spell at Turf Moor was not a happy time and after falling out with John Bond he moved to his home-town club, Portsmouth the following May. At Fratton Park he continued to suffer from injuries and was unable to return to his previous high standard. He eventually retired from professional football in December 1986. After retirement He turned out for Road-Sea Southampton F.C. in their final 1986–87 season. He subsequently worked for Abbey Life and latterly as health care adviser for BUPA in Poole.

Biography He was born in Schloss Ludwigslust, the eldest son of Hereditary Grand Duke Paul Friedrich of Mecklenburg and his wife Princess Alexandrine of Prussia. He became heir apparent to the grand duchy following the death of his great-grandfather Frederick Francis I on 1 February 1837. Frederick Francis was privately educated until 1838. He then attended the Blochmann institute in Dresden before going to the University of Bonn. Frederick Francis succeeded his father as Grand Duke on 7 March 1842. Frederick Francis served on the general staff of Generalfeldmarschall Friedrich Graf von Wrangel during the Second Schleswig War. During the Austro-Prussian War he commanded the forces that occupied Leipzig and lay siege to Nuremberg. He also took part in the Franco-Prussian War, during which he was made Governor-General of Reims and commanded the German forces laying siege to Toul.

Born in Lauchheim in what is now Baden-Württemberg, he was employed by Margrave Karl von Burgau from 1620 onwards. After having served under the Elector of Bavaria, Maximilian I from 1625 to 1630, he was appointed by Emperor Ferdinand II to be a judge at the Imperial Court. He was assigned to Archduke Leopold V of Tyrol, initially in an advisory function, but in 1638 he became court chancellor, a function he was to hold until 1650, first under Archduchess Claudia de' Medici and, after her death in 1648, under her son, Archduke Ferdinand Charles. Work as Chancellor On behalf of the Archduchess Claudia de' Medici, Biener administered the collection of revenues. He became unpopular in this occupation, particularly after exchanging heated correspondence with the Bishop of Brixen over taxes the Bishop believed the principality was exempt from paying. Wilhelm Biener tightened the administration, and fought against corruption and official malpractice. He prevented the secession of the ecclesiastical principalities Brixen and Trento by enforcing their contractual ties to Tyrol so that, as a consequence, these territories remained under the authority of the Tyrol. Through careful diplomacy, he also prevented a French invasion of the Münstertal in Switzerland and settled disagreements with Graubünden farmers, who were nominally still subject to Tyrol but in fact already were independent. Resisted by the States, Wilhelm Biener strengthened the power of the sovereign. In vain, he protested against the selling of Tyrolian rights to Graubünden. These rights were sold in order to finance the extravagant life style of Archduke Ferdinand Charles. Thus, the Prättigau and the Lower Engadin were incorporated into Graubünden. Trial and execution In 1650, Wilhelm Biener, following the death of the Archduchess, was charged with treason and embezzlement. He was tried by two Italian judges and was sentenced to death in 1651. After the sentence was given, Biener wrote to Archduke Ferdinand, the son of the former Empress, who ordered a reprieve. However Biener was executed in 1651 in the town of Rattenberg as the official pardon was delivered too late. Cultural references Playwright Josef Wenter used the struggle between Wilhelm Biener and the aristocracy as a reflection of Austrian culture and policy in the 1930s. Author Robert Pyrah has suggested the play, Der Kanzler von Tirol, was popular despite its contentious political material due to the tragic romance developed between Biener and Archduchess consort of Austria Claudia de'Medici. Dr Hermann von Schmid wrote his novel The Chancellor of Tyrol on Wilhelm Biener. It has been suggested that this book contributed to the perception of Biener as hero. It has also been suggested that Biener was the basis for the character of Vilem in Karel Mácha's poem, Máj.

Owned by Colonel Phil T. Chinn's Himyar Stud, Sarazen won his first three starts. Chinn then sold him for a huge profit to Virginia Fair Vanderbilt, who raced him under her Fair Stable banner. A small horse at fifteen hands tall, Sarazen had a difficult temperament that made him hard to handle, and his original owner had him gelded. After his sale to Fair Stable, Sarazen was trained by Max Hirsch, and he wound up his two-year-old racing season undefeated, capturing all ten races he entered. At age three, health problems saw Sarazen's handlers pass up the U.S. Triple Crown races. When he came back to the track, he dominated racing and earned the first of his two consecutive unofficial United States Horse of the Year awards. Sarazen's 1925 wins included the Dixie Stakes on Preakness Day on the turf at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. He also won the International Special No.3 at the Latonia Race Track in Covington, Kentucky, over a field of top American and European horses. While setting a Latonia track record, 3-year-old Sarazen defeated Belmont Stakes winner Mad Play, the future Hall of Fame filly Princess Doreen (\\"The Princess\\" came back to beat him in the 1926 Saratoga Handicap), and Pierre Wertheimer's 4-year-old colt Epinard, the champion 2-year-old of France who would retrospectively be named American Champion Older Male Horse. Sarazen came back the following year and became the only horse to have his name engraved twice on one of the oldest trophies in American sports, \\"The Annapolis Subscription Plate.\\" The plate is presented to the winner of the Dixie Stakes run at \\"Old Hilltop\\" since 1870 (the race was formerly called \\"The Dinner Party Stakes\\"). To date, Sarazen is the only repeat winner of the Dixie. He was named Horse of the Year for the second straight time in 1925, winning five of his ten starts.  Retirement  Sarazen was not put out to stud because he had been gelded and could not sire any offspring. He continued to race for another two years but became raucous and unwilling to make much of an effort. He was retired after the 1928 season to Brookdale Farm on Spur Road near Lexington, Kentucky. Sarazen died at age nineteen on December 12, 1940. Following its creation, he was posthumously inducted into the United States' National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1957.

Biography Born in 1893 in New York City, Holtz was discovered by vaudevillian Elsie Janis in San Francisco when still in his teens, and came to New York. In 1913, he appeared in his first Broadway show, titled World of Pleasure. He appeared on Broadway in other shows with small parts, then became a star in George White's Scandals of 1919. He reappeared in the Scandals in 1920 and 1921. Holtz became a close good friend of George Gershwin when appearing in the Scandals, which Gershwin wrote the music for. Gershwin later wrote Tell Me More, a musical, for Holtz in 1925, which was not received favorably and was short-lived on Broadway. Several years later, Holtz had a big hit on Broadway in 1931 when he hired his pianist, Harold Arlen, to write a show for him. The musical, which Holt produced, was called ″You Said It″ (music by Harold Arlen and lyrics and book by Jack Yellen) and the show ran on Broadway for 192 performances. Holt's pianist, Harold Arlen, would go on to write the music for The Wizard of Oz in 1939. In the 1920s, Holtz became the highest paid entertainer on Broadway, with articles touting his salary as an unheard of $6,000 per week. Unfortunately for Holtz, all of that money was invested in the stock market. He later told friends that he came out of the 1929 crash with $500, while he had been worth more than $1 million the previous year. In the 1920s, Holtz' career alternated between musical comedies and vaudeville shows where he was the headliner. He reached one of his career milestones in 1925 when he played the Palace Theater as the headliner. The Palace was the most prestigious theatre in the country, and Holtz broke all records there by playing for 10 weeks. In 1931-1932, Holtz repeated this feat at the Palace a second time. He also starred in and produced a similar show at the competing Hollywood Theater that outgrossed the Palace Show. In vaudeville shows and radio, Holtz' comedy was based in telling long, character stories, usually with at least one character having a strong Jewish dialect. His most famous character, Sam Lapidus, stayed with Holtz for his entire career, including Holtz' guest stints on the Merv Griffin Show in the 1970s. In the 1930s, while still appearing on Broadway, Holtz left New York twice for London and appeared in two hits at the London Palladium: Laughter Over London and Transatlantic Rhythm. Also in the 1930s, Holtz became a regular on radio. He had long stints on The Rudy Vallee Show, The Paul Whiteman Show and others. Holtz ended with several radio shows of his own, including The Lou Holtz Laugh Club. One of the regulars on that show was Fanny Brice. Holtz' last two shows on Broadway were Priorities of 1942 and Star Time (1944). After the latter, Holtz was 51 years old. He went through a bitter divorce at that time, and decided to cut down on his work schedule and appearances. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times in 1989, George Burns was asked who the greatest comedian was that he ever saw. Burns replied that it was Jack Benny, but Burns named Holtz and several others as coming right after Benny. Holtz' career after the mid-1940s consisted of high-end club dates, including headlining in Las Vegas, and television appearances on variety shows. He appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show twice in 1957 and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson twice in the 1960s. He appeared on Jack Paar's Tonight Show more than 20 times, and appeared on Steve Allen's Tonight Show seven times. In 1973, Holtz turned 80 years old but still appeared on the Merv Griffin Show throughout the 1970s. Holtz's other credits include the feature film Follow The Leader (1930). This film starred Ed Wynn with a large supporting role for Holtz. The film was based on the musical that Wynn and Holtz starred in on Broadway called Manhattan Mary. The film also was the first movie that stars Ginger Rogers and Ethel Merman appeared. Holtz also starred in the Columbia musical short School for Romance in 1934, which co-starred a then unknown Betty Grable. Holtz' early standup comedy routine was memorialized in a 1929 Vitaphone short. While semi-retired in New York in the late 1950s, Holtz met his third and final wife, Gloria, who remained with him until his death in 1980. In 1963, at the age of 70, Holtz and his wife moved to Los Angeles and gave birth to a son, Lou Jr. In 1965, the couple had another son, Richard. Holtz' final years were spent doing what he'd done on and off for more than 50 years: going to Hillcrest Country Club in Los Angeles for lunch daily and sitting at the famous round table of comedians, which included performers like Burns, Benny, the Marx Brothers, Milton Berle, and George Jessel.

Description  The egg-shaped carapace is rough textured without keels or marginal serrations and tends to be olive to brown in color. The vertebral scutes are broad, the first of which connects to four marginal and the cervical scute. The marginal scutes are yellow and may be blotched. The yellow plastron is unhinged and unmarked with the bridges containing one or two dark splotches. The skin of the western chicken turtle is olive to brown with yellow lines extending from the head across the neck, from the shoulder to the feet and vertically on the rump. The long narrow head comes to a point at the beak, which is neither hooked nor notched. The western chicken turtle received its common name from its long head and neck, which tends to be as long as the plastron. This species also exhibits sexual dimorphism with the female being larger than males. Range The western chicken turtle ranges across the southeastern United States from Virginia to western Oklahoma and south to the Gulf of Mexico. There are three recognized subspecies: The Florida chicken turtle (D. r. chrysea) of the Florida peninsula, the western chicken turtle (D. r. miaria) of western Mississippi and all areas west of the Mississippi River, and the eastern chicken turtle (D. r. reticularia) which extends across the rest of the range. The western chicken turtle can be distinguished by its flattened shape, broad, faint lines on the carapace, and dark makings along the seams of the plastron.Ernst, C. H., J. E. Lovick, and R. W. Barbour. (1994). Turtles of the United States and Canada. Smithsonian Institution Press. Washington, D.

It is omnivorous and preys primarily on invertebrates. The western chicken turtle will bask and frequently travels overland for a variety of activities including nesting, migration, estivation, and hibernation. The eastern chicken turtle exhibits a bimodal nesting pattern, nesting both in August – September and February – March.

Association with the Patriarca family During the successful federal prosecutions of the Patriacra's in the early 1990s, remaining Patriarca members began fighting amongst each other for power as Frank Salemme began to consolidate his position in Boston. After a failed attempt on Salemme's life in Saugus, Massachusetts in August 1990, soon after newspapers reported he had become head of Boston's criminal operations, Mello and other criminals in the New England area were contacted. On the night of August 14, 1990, Mello was observed with Gordon O'Brien, William Anthony, a recently paroled freelance hitman from West Warwick, as they sat in a parked car in on the East Side of Providence,Rhode Island. Although initially holding back on the assumption the three men may have been detectives, patrolman Frank Moody approached the car to investigate when Mello was seen taking a blackjack and throwing it onto the car's rear window sill. Taking the men into custody at gunpoint, a later search of the car turned up police equipment including badges, handcuffs, \\"police\\" printed baseball caps, a portable police scanner, a police spotlight and siren. Anthony readily agreed to cooperate with authorities, however, refusing to submit to a lie detector test, Anthony was dropped from entering the Witness Protection Program. Although an altercation between Mello and officers attempting to fingerprint him would result in his being restrained by several detectives while in custody, the three would be released on bail (Hanrahan, who had been waiting in a van a block from the others, had fled the scene after witnessing their arrest). State investigators later discovered through talks with Anthony that the three were planning to kidnap Patriarca bookmaker Blaise Marfeo. Waiting outside his Adesso Restaurant, the men would \\"arrest\\" Marfeo on the pretense of a routine traffic stop and drive him to a safehouse in Fall River where they would ransom him for between $250,000-$300,000 or simply murder him. Return to Fall River After the gangland slaying of Hanrahan, Mello retreated from Providence and began competing with rival criminals over bookmaking operations from the recently retired Donald Waterhouse. His rivals included Louie Alexander, and Joe Savitch, whose remains would be found in northern Maine three years following their disappearance in 1995, and Gerard Ouimette who would eventually be convicted of extortion charges that same year. Associate Peter \\"Thumbs\\" Costa was also questioned in the disappearance of other rivals, but refused to talk to authorities. With Mello left as the dominant figure in the local underworld, he soon entered into \\"legitimate\\" businesses including the fishing industry building a multimillion-dollar empire over a nine-year period as the owner of Tempest Fisheries processing plant in 1994 and controlling over small fleet of fishing boats as well as the Fall River-based insurance company Cost Plus, the property management company TEK Properties and local King's Highway restaurant Fatso's (formerly the Rocking Horse Pub). In recent years, he has made large donations to local organizations through Tempest Fisheries including Fall River youth sports, drug rehabilitation centers and, most notably, the donation of $25,000 to the newly built Atlantis Charter School in 2001. Federal prosecution and imprisonment Shortly after becoming married the previous July, Mello was arrested by federal agents at his home in Dartmouth on September 17, 2002. Indicted by authorities on 51 charges including extortion and waterfront racketeering charges, including the forced takeover of Tempest Fisheries, Mello was also accused of using five fishing vessels for the purposes of smuggling and distributing marijuana and cocaine in the Fall River and New Bedford area. On November 17, 2003, Mello pleaded guilty to a racketeering charge. On May 24, 2004, Mello received his sentence: 13 years in jail, with three years of supervised release afterwards.

The practice is more commonly referred as a levirate marriage, examples of which can be found in ancient and biblical times. The practice was meant as a means for the widow to have someone to support her and her children financially, and to keep her late husband's wealth within the family bloodline. At the time it was initiated, women were responsible for the house chores and men were the providers, therefore if the woman lost her husband, she would have no one to provide for the remaining family. Because her in-laws would not want someone outside of the family's blood line to inherit her late husband's estate, she was required to marry within the family. This can have various forms and functions in different cultures, serving in relative proportions as a social protection for, and control over, the widow and her children. She may have the right to require her late husband's extended family to provide her with a new man, or conversely she might have the obligation to accept the man put forward by the family, with no real prospect of turning him down, if her birth family will not accept her back into their home. The custom is sometimes justified on the basis that it ensures that the wealth does not leave the patrilineal family. It is also sometimes justified as a protection for the widow and her children.  By region  =Judaism= A form of widow inheritance is part of Mosaic law, where it is known as levirate marriage (see yibbum). A feature of this practice is that the dead husband's brother is obligated to marry his dead brother's widow. However, this applies only if the widow (and consequently the deceased husband/brother) had no children. However, there are mechanisms whereby either party can avoid such a marriage. = Africa = This practice is common in certain African groups, for example the Dinka or Jieng of South Sudan, the Yoruba of Southwestern Nigeria, and Luo in Kenya and Uganda around Lake Victoria. In Uganda it is customarily assumed that the welfare of widows and their children will be taken care of by the deceased's kin as a matter of course. However, in practice, widows are often simply dispossessed of their farmland and other assets, thus forced by circumstances either to return to their own family or to become subordinate wives of their deceased husband's brothers. In the Zanzan Region of the Cote d’Ivoire inheritance among all ethnic groups, except the Mande, is matrilineal and patrilocal. This means that if the husband dies, his assets are inherited by his nephews on his mother's side; the wife then either marries the heir, or returns to her own family (leaving her children with their father's family). = Afghanistan = Among Pashtun communities, the code known as Pashtunwali requires a widow to marry, even against her will, her dead husband's brother or cousin. The code also requires that her children be treated as children of the new husband. The Taliban campaigned against the practice as being against shariah law.

It is not recognized by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, and it is not recognized by any official Coptic organization. The only Coptic organization that has recognized the flag is the New Zealand Coptic Association, which is the same association that created the flag. and the Free Copts.  Background  Copts voice opposition to many aspects of Egypt's political life. One of these is the present-day Egyptian flag, which many Copts feel does not represent their Egyptian identity. The pattern closely resembles those of other Arabic-speaking countries, a symbol of Arab nationalism rejected by many Copts, along with the official title of the country \\"Arab Republic of Egypt\\", as if to distinguish between an Arab Egypt and the other that is not. In this respect, taking into consideration that Copts are especially unlikely to consider themselves as Arab, the current Egyptian flag alienates the Egyptian Christian minority in its homeland.  Symbolism  The Coptic Coat of Arms. The Coptic Flag consists of two main components: a blue cross and a colorful coat of arms. * The cross represents Christianity, the Copts' religion. The blue color stems from the Egyptian sky and water. It also reminds the Copts of their persecution, when some Muslim rulers forced their ancestors to wear heavy crosses around their necks until their necks became blue.My Coptic Church - Ask A CoptEl-Shamy, Hasan M. Folktales of Egypt. 406 p. 1980 Series: (FW) Folktales of the World () * The top of the coat of arms is decorated with Coptic crosses intertwined with lotus flowers, representing Egyptian identity. Coptic crosses are made of four arms equal in length, each of which is crossed by a shorter arm (a form of the heraldic \\"Cross Crosslet\\"). They are different from the Latin cross that possesses three short arms and a longer arm. The lotus flower, also known as the Egyptian White Water-lily (Nymphaea lotus), is one of ancient Egypt's most highly regarded flowers. It used to represent creation and resurrection, for it disappears under water after sunset, then resurfaces and blooms at dawn. An ancient Egyptian creation myth states that the first thing to have been born from the watery chaos of the beginning of time was a giant lotus flower, which, on the first day of creation, gave birth to the sun. The black background behind the ornaments is a symbol of Kaami (), the Egyptian name of Egypt, which means the Black Land. Ancient Egyptians gave their country this name since the waters of the Nile used to bring black soil during the inundation season and deposit it on the banks of the Nile, thus fertilizing them. The contrast between the yellow and the black is a symbol of the Copts' Christian faith and Egyptian identity that still shine amid the darkness of the persecution they have been suffering over the centuries. Beneath these ornaments is a green line in the middle of the coat of arms, which represents the Nile Valley. Around it are two yellow lines that symbolize the Eastern and Western Deserts of Egypt.

The king's favourite son, he was the founder of the semi- royal House of Bourbon-Maine named after his title and his surname. Biography Louis-Auguste de Bourbon was born at the Château de Saint- Germain-en-Laye on 31 March 1670. He was named Louis after his fatherAthénaïs:The Real Queen of France by Lisa Hilton, p.153 and Auguste after the Roman Emperor Augustus Immediately after his birth, Louis-Auguste was placed in the care of one of his mother's acquaintances, the widowed Madame Scarron, who took him to live in a house on rue de Vaugirard, near the Luxembourg Palace in Paris. His siblings, Louis-César, Louise-Françoise and Louise Marie Anne de Bourbon were also brought there after their births. Their mother, living with the king at Versailles, rarely saw her children, and Madame Scarron took the place of mother in Louis-Auguste's affections. One of his legs was shorter than the other and Scarron took him to consult, first, a famous quack at Antwerp and later to the waters of Bareges, a small town near the Pyrenees, whither they traveled incognito (she as the marquise de Surgeres). On 19 December 1673, when Louis-Auguste was three years old, Louis XIV legitimised his children by Montespan by letters patent registered by the Parlement de Paris. At this time, Louis-Auguste received the title of duc du Maine. In 1674, at the age of four, Louis-Auguste and his siblings were officially introduced to the court at Versailles. In the same year, he was made a colonel-general of the Swiss Guards. Du Maine's greatest enemy at court became his father's sister-in-law, the duchesse d'Orléans, known at court as Madame. In her famous correspondence describing life at Versailles, Madame claimed that du Maine was not the son of the king: > I can readily believe that the comte de Toulouse is the King's son; but I > have always thought that the duc du Maine is the son of Terme [a member of > the court], who was a false knave, and the greatest tale-bearer in the > CourtMemoirs of the duchesse d'Orléans Louis XIV showered him with gifts and titles, and hired the best tutors for him. The maréchal du Luxembourg, a famous military strategist, was put in charge of the child's military training. Despite this, Louis-Auguste never became more than a mediocre soldier. He was made Grand Maître de France. Portrait engraved in 1703 by Pierre Drevet after a painting by François de Troy. The engraving shows Maine as he wished to be seen, a soldier and sovereign Prince of the Dombes with a closed crown and sceptre. The Latin title, Luvovicus Augustus Dei gratia Dombarum Princeps, also promoted his claim, but in France there was an unwillingness to regard him as anything more than a duke. Later, after the death of Louis XIV, the regent, Philippe II, duc d'Orléans, had the engraved plate destroyed. Very few prints survive.Guy Rowlands, The Dynastic State and the Army under Louis XIV (Cambridge University Press, 2002, ), pp. iv–v. This copy is made from a print at Harvard University's Fogg Museum.Guy Rowlands, The Dynastic State and the Army under Louis XIV (Cambridge University Press, 2002, ), pp. iv–v. The king also blackmailed his cousin, the wealthy La Grande Mademoiselle, into ceding some of her estates to du Maine in return for the liberation of her imprisoned lover, Antoine Nompar de Caumont, Duke of Lauzun. As a result, Louis-Auguste became the comte d'Eu, sovereign Prince of the Dombes, and duc d'Aumale. He also received the governorship of Languedoc and was awarded the Order of the Holy Spirit. In April 1684 du Maine represented the king at the wedding of the Duke of Savoy to du Maine's cousin, Anne Marie d'Orléans. In 1688, Louis Auguste was made a capitaine général des galères (General of Galleys). Marriage Several potential brides were considered for him, including his first cousin, Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans, the only daughter of his uncle, Monsieur and his enemy, Madame, who was horrified at the prospect of her daughter marrying a bastard. However, the Grand Condé, a more distant relative of the king but still France's premier prince du sang, was willing to overlook the discrepancy in social status. So du Maine was allowed to choose among the three unmarried daughters of Condé's son, the duc d'Enghien. He chose Louise Bénédicte, Mademoiselle de Charolais, over her sisters, Anne Marie, Mademoiselle de Condé and Marie Anne, Mademoiselle de Montmorency (later duchesse de Vendôme). Mademoiselle de Condé was quite upset, as she had her heart set on marrying du Maine: > Monsieur le Prince had three daughters for him [du Maine] to choose from, > and an extra quarter of an inch of stature made him prefer the second. All > three were extremely small; the eldest [Anne Marie] was beautiful, and full > of sense and wit. The incredible constraint, to say the least of it, in > which the strange temper of Monsieur le Prince kept everyone who was subject > to his yoke, made the choice of her sister a cause of bitter heartburning to > her^ Lewis. L, W, The Sunset of the Splendid Century, Life and times of the > duc du Maine 1670–1736, New York, 1953, p.120 On 19 May 1692, Louis-Auguste and Anne Louise Bénédicte were married in a ceremony at the Palace of Versailles. Presided over by the Cardinal de Bouillon, the guest of honour was the exiled James II of England. Madame de Montespan, who had fallen out of favour with the king after the Affaire des Poisons, did not attend her son's wedding. The duc du Maine received a gift of one million livres from his father at his wedding. His bride was given a hundred thousand livres in cash, with clothes and jewels worth an additional two hundred thousand livres. The marriage proved unhappy. Louise Bénédicte felt disgraced by her marriage to a légitimé de France and was often unfaithful. As the groom and bride were both physically handicapped (Louise Bénédicte had a bad right arm and Louis had a lame leg), people at court snickered: > Voici l'union d'un boiteux et d'une manchote. Ah, le beau couple!Lewis. L, > W, The Sunset of the Splendid Century, Life and times of the duc du Maine > 1670–1736, New York, 1953, p.140 Nonetheless, the couple eventually had three children who grew to adulthood. Their daughter, baptised at Versailles on 9 April 1714, was known as Mademoiselle du Maine and named Louise-Françoise de Bourbon. In 1707, Madame de Montespan died, and the duc du Maine inherited a large portion of her fortune, including the château de Clagny, built for her by his father near the château at Versailles. Unlike his younger siblings, the duke did not express any emotion or remorse at the loss of his mother, as he considered Madame de Maintenon to have been more of a mother to him throughout his youth. Prince du Sang In July 1714, pressed by Maintenon, Louis XIV raised Louis-Auguste and his younger brother, the comte de Toulouse, to the rank of princes du sang, and compelled the Parlement of Paris to acquiesce to their being placed in the line of succession to the French throne, following all of the legitimate lines of the House of Bourbon. In August 1715, Louis XIV's health deteriorated drastically. On 22 August, he was unable to attend a troop parade in the gardens of Versailles, and he ordered the duc du Maine to take his place at this event. This public display of the Maine's \\"promotion\\" greatly concerned his rival, the duc d'Orléans. Cellamare Conspiracy On 1 September 1715, Louis XIV died, and was to be succeeded by his great-grandson Louis, Duke of Anjou as Louis XV. The little boy was the grandson of Du Maine's late half-brother Louis, Grand Dauphin. The old king's last will and testament gave the regency to both his nephew the duc d'Orléans and the 45 year old duc du Maine. However, the next day, the duc d'Orléans ensured the annulment of Louis XIV's will in the Parlement de Paris. Displeased with Orléans' actions, Louis-Auguste, pressured by his ambitious wife, joined in the Cellamare Conspiracy in the hope of transferring the regency to the young King Philip V of Spain, who was the uncle of the boy king Louis XV and a half nephew of du Maine. The plot was named after Antonio del Giudice, Prince di Cellamare, the Spanish ambassador to the French court. After the conspiracy was discovered, du Maine was arrested and imprisoned in the fortress of Doullens, and his wife was exiled to Dijon. In 1720, the couple was pardoned by the Council of the Regent and was allowed to return to court. After their release from imprisonment in 1720, Louise Bénédicte made an effort to reconcile with her husband, whom she had talked into joining the plot. She remarked: > I owe a full and rightful explanation to M. le Duc du Maine which is more > precious to me than my own liberty or lifeJe dois une justification > authentique à M. le Duc du Maine, qui me tient infiniment plus à cœur que ma > liberté et que ma propre vie. (Prince de Condé site) After the release, Louis-Auguste and his wife led a more subdued, compatible life at the château de Sceaux, bought by Louis XIV for du Maine, where his wife created a little court attended by popular literary figures of the day. They also had a new home in Paris. On 27 December 1718, before their exile, he and his wife had purchased an unfinished house in Paris on the rue de Bourbon (now rue de Lille) from his wife's sister, Marie Thérèse de Bourbon. It was originally designed by the architect Robert de Cotte, but they had hired a new architect, Armand-Claude Mollet, to enlarge and redesign it. It was completed before their return from exile and became known as the Hôtel du Maine (destroyed 1838).Robert Neuman (1994) Robert de Cotte and the Perfection of Architecture in Eighteenth-Century France, Chicago/London: The University of Chicago Press, , pp. 142–143; Alexandre Gady (2008) Les Hôtels particuliers de Paris du Moyen Âge à la Belle Époque, Paris: Parigramme, , pp. 313. The site of the former Hôtel du Maine is at 84–86 rue de Lille. This hôtel is not to be confused with his wife's later residence, also called the Hôtel du Maine (now the Hôtel Biron), on the rue de Varenne. Louise Bénédicte on several occasions tried to marry off their children. First, she tried to marry their son and main heir, Louis Auguste de Bourbon, to his first cousin Charlotte Aglaé, Mademoiselle de Valois, daughter of du Maine's younger sister, Françoise-Marie de Bourbon. The young Mademoiselle de Valois refused, however. Later, Louise- Bénédicte tried to marry off Mademoiselle du Maine twice. First, she offered her daughter's hand to the duc de Guise, but that marriage never materialised. She then offered the girl to the widower, Jacques I, Prince of Monaco, who was often at Versailles. Despite offering a large dowry to both men, neither accepted. Mademoiselle du Maine eventually died in 1743, alone and single, at the age thirty-five. She was buried at the Église at Sceaux. It was at Sceaux that du Maine died on 14 May 1736 at the age of sixty-six, during the reign of his grandnephew Louis XV, by now a young man of twenty-six years. The House of Bourbon-Maine became extinct at the death of his eldest son, the prince de Dombes, in 1775. The large du Maine fortune was inherited by their cousin, the duc de Penthièvre, the only son of du Maine's younger brother, Louis-Alexandre de Bourbon, comte de Toulouse.

Instead of a single, large gameworld, the storyline is mission-based (but allowing the player some control over the order of play). The world physics of the original game are expanded on, as these missions take place on different planets under different suns; for example piloting under a dark red-dwarf provides a different play experience to a bright yellow sun. In addition, the player may design their own skimmers; customising engine and weapon strengths, equipment payloads, and arranging the on-screen control panel. The game's interface is the same cursor-and-menu system used in Pete Cooke's other creations, such as Micronaut One, A Whole New Ball Game and Tau Ceti.

It is one of the first films of the Portuguese Cinema Novo, itself part of a wave of New Cinemas sweeping the world in the 1960s, and a break from the previous tradition of Portuguese cinema exemplified by the comédia à portuguesa. Lopes's film was shown at the festivals of Pesaro and Salso-Poretta in Italy, garnered favourable reviews throughout Europe and won the Prémio da Casa da Imprensa back in Portugal. Synopsis Belarmino comprises two strands: an experiential and an interview strand, and constantly alternates between the two. Although these are carefully intertwined on both the sound and image track, they can be separated for ease of discussion. =The Experiential Strand= The Experiential Strand is principally concerned with registering Fragoso's current and former activities. After the opening credits, in which we see a montage of stills of Belarmino taken in the streets of Lisbon, there follows a sequence showing the ex-boxer at a training session in his former boxing club. We are shown scenes of the daily domestic routine of Fragoso and his wife at their home in the Rua Barros Queirós, which seems at once both fragile and tranquil. We later see them eating at a casa de pasto with their daughter. We also see footage shot at the Grupo Desportivo da Mouraria, a small neighbourhood association where Belarmino first began to box and where he met the man who was to manage him for the most part of his career: Albano Martins. Here youths who are presumably the next generation of hopeful boxers train against a backdrop filled with the paraphernalia of traditional neighbourhood life. In the next section, which concentrates on Belarmino's life in the streets, we see the ex- boxer walking along his home street and through Lisbon's downtown. He approaches a young woman to her obvious displeasure. Later, Belarmino sits on an esplanade, drinking coffee and whistling, partly at women passers-by and partly to himself. We again see Belarmino training, this time outside on the track of Sporting Clube de Portugal’s old Alvalade stadium. This sequence is juxtaposed with a return to the boxer walking through the streets of the Baixa. He passes by one of the old cinemas of that area, which has posters for westerns and horror films pasted on its doors. The camera accompanies Belarmino through the midst of a great number of people who seem to be milling around aimlessly. As Belarmino moves through the streets, we hear not atmospheric noise but the sounds of a screening in a cinema auditorium. At one point there is a tilt-up of the façade of the Cinema Eden, which shows us Belarmino's view of a poster announcing the film A Miúda da Bica showing its lead, Fernando Farinha. There comes another sequence showing Belarmino seated at a table in a café, but this time in its interior. He is working as a photo- colourist. A bolero plays on the soundtrack. Belarmino is then asked if he could still fight a man his own weight. We do not hear an answer to this question, but in the next scene, do see the boxer undergoing the sort of medical examination normally preliminary to a match. There is a cut to his arrival at the ring to fight a Spanish boxer, Toni Alonso. This is a carefully edited scene, in the same style as the opening scene in the gym. The montage accompanies the rhythm of the combat and the sequence is punctuated by stills. From the ringside there is a cut to a scene in the Hot Club of Portugal, a jazz venue. There is no tangible link to the ex-boxer's story as he is not present. We then see Belarmino at another venue, the Ritz Clube. The fact that this is an entirely different location is not made explicit by the editing, which instead works to place the two in parallel. A strip tease is announced on stage at the Ritz Clube, followed by a shot of Fragoso staring intensely on (though we see none of the show). There is a cut to a long, high angle shot of the ex-boxer dancing with a woman and it is implied that she might be a prostitute, especially as Fragoso had just been quizzed upon rumours of his consorting with sex workers. The scene in the Ritz Clube is further crosscut with scenes from the Hot Clube, in which we see a romance developing between the saxophone player of the band playing and a woman in the audience. They dance together as dawn breaks and the scene ends with a curious tilt up a tower. There follows a sequence in which Fragoso drinks water from a fountain in downtown Lisbon. This, for its part, is intercut with footage from the boxing match with Toni Alonso. The next sequence in the experiential strand then closes the film, with Belarmino in long shot walking in a crowded street, glimpsed through the balustrade of a veranda. =The Interview Strand= The Interview Strand consists of an interview between Belarmino Fragoso and Baptista-Bastos, a journalist, writer, and at that time, film critic. We see Belarmino in a medium shot against a white background and only hear Baptista- Bastos's voice as he asks the questions. At the start of the film, Belarmino gives a garbled explanation of a scam in which the ex-boxer's brother fought under Belarmino's name in London and lost. Belarmino was then, he tells us, contracted by Jack Solomon, whom he describes as \\"um dos maiores empresários mundiais\\". Solomon had an iron grip on British boxing promotion in the 1950s, but this had waned considerably by the early 1960s. In any case, in view of the match's outcome, it seems that Belarmino was contracted to be a punchbag, not to be a contender. With little or no preparation Belarmino travels to London to fight a second-rate boxer referred to as Vic Andeeti in the interview, but whose actual name is Andretti (and who was later to manage Def Leppard), by whom he is routed within a couple of rounds. Berlarmino explains this away with accusations of unsportsmanlike conduct on Andretti's part and of connivance in his defeat on the part of the referee. The ex-boxer then discusses his home life, the fact that his elderly mother still has to work to support herself and that he had to leave home at seventeen. Fragoso then tells the story of his immediate family, his loyal wife to whom he claims devotion, his first daughter who he had to give up for adoption and his second who almost went blind through meningitis. Belarmino goes on to recount how he started to box. In his account he was a natural champion from the start, though he does touch upon the hardships that kept him boxing when he was reluctant to do so. Here snippets of an interview with Albano Martins, the ex- boxer's former manager, are cross-cut with Belarmino's account. This is the only outside view of the ex-boxer we are given, aside from a few rumours that Baptista-Bastos relates as part of a question about the ex-boxer's current habits. Martins paints a more prosaic picture of the start to Belarmino's career, suggesting it did not have such a glorious beginning and that the main quality that impressed him in Belarmino was his capacity to take punishment in the ring. Belarmino then criticises Albano Martins for exploiting him and there is a cut to Martins countering this with accusations of indiscipline on the ex-boxer's part and a defence of managers in general. This sets the pattern for the debate-like format adopted in this section of the film. We see the antagonistic interdependence between these two types of people involved in a sort of boss-worker relationship. Belarmino intimates that because of his illiteracy and his innumeracy he was often cheated or defrauded of his match purse. He reveals that he now has no job, but makes ends meet through biscatezinhos, his occasional work as a photo-colourist and loans from friends. He says that sometimes he goes hungry, but brushes this off saying: \\"muitas vezes quero jantar, não tenho, muitas vezes quero almoçar, não tenho, mas não quer dizer que seja fome. É um estado de fraqueza assim razoável.\\" This is an assertion that is both comic and tragic in equal measure. Returning to the subject of his wife, Belarmino reaffirms his love for her but admits to having aventuras with more than a hint of pride. He then talks of his last professional fight in Portugal against a boxer called Sotta, one of his closest rivals. Belarmino won by a knockout, but earned a pittance for his trouble. We return to Albano Martins, who tells us of Belarmino's indiscipline, of his going out on the town the night before the fight against Sotta and having to undergo a drastic weight-loss regime on the day of the weigh-in to make the grade. Martins claims Belarmino \\"podia ser grande\\", but cites his lack of discipline as the main reason behind his ultimate failure. Belarmino then recounts with evident pride how he managed to be champion of Portugal, despite the hunger and hardships he had to face, and underlines the fact that he was continually cheated due to his illiteracy and innumeracy. A boxing match is arranged against Toni Alonso, purely for the purposes of the film. This is the first time Belarmino has fought for years, though we are not told this explicitly. Prior to the bout, Belarmino explains that he doesn't fear losing when he fights, as winning or losing are just the two sides of the sportsman's lot. Rather he fears to \\"fazer má figura\\", to perform in such a way that he feels ashamed of himself. He then goes on to criticise Portuguese boxing for being infested with leeches and hangers-on, impresarios who creamed money off the sport without constructing or contributing. From the tenor of the conversation it would seem that, for some years, there has not been professional boxing in Portugal. When asked whether he would still be able to fight at a competitive level, Belarmino demurs and discusses the conditions a boxer needs to perform to the best of his ability: good sustenance and the freedom to train and concentrate on the match. The implication is that these are absent from his own life. After the bout against Toni Alonso, interspersed with the nightclub scenes, Belarmino tells of his relations with women, which he dismisses as being of little consequence, and shrugs off various accusations of immorality. He claims that he only started frequenting cabarets like the Ritz Clube after the end of his professional career in Portugal and mentions his desire to emigrate in order to revive his career, a possibility that seems scant. Shown in a long shot that reveals the set upon which the interview is taking place, we hear Baptista-Bastos ask Belarmino what he expects the audience's perception of him to be. Then we return to the medium shot used hitherto. Belarmino lays out his plans for the future. He says that he will become a trainer and a maker of champions \\"se tiver vida e saúde. Assim a vida mo permita\\". The last part of this wishful thinking is heard over a high-angled long shot taken through the blurred wrought-iron bars of a balcony. There is a slow rack focus that reverses the blurriness of the balustrade and the clarity of the street, leaving Belarmino indistinct in the midst of the mass of passers-by and brings the enclosing bars into focus.

Zak (born 9 February 1962) is an American neuroeconomist. Background Zak graduated with degrees in mathematics and economics from San Diego State University before acquiring a PhD in Economics from the University of Pennsylvania. He is professor at Claremont Graduate University in Southern California. He has studied brain imaging, and was among the first to identify the role of oxytocin in mediating trusting behaviors between unacquainted humans.Paul J. Zak, Robert Kurzban and William T. Matzner, \\"The Neurobiology of Trust\\", Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 1032:224–227, 2004. Zak directs the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University and is a member of the Neurology Department at Loma Linda University Medical Center. He edited Moral Markets: The Critical Role of Values in the Economy (Princeton University Press, 2008). His book, The Moral Molecule was published in 2012 by Dutton. The book summarizes his findings on oxytocin and discusses the role of oxytocin in human experiences and behaviors such as empathy, altruism, and morality. Zak's research aims to challenge the thought that people generally are driven primarily to act for what they consider their self-interest, and asks how morality may modulate one's interpretation of what constitutes \\"self-interest\\" in one's own personal terms. Methodological questions have arisen in regards to Zak's work, however. Other commentators though have called his work \\"one of the most revealing experiments in the history of economics.\\" According to The Moral Molecule, Zak's father was an engineer and he takes an engineering approach to neuroscience, seeking to create predictive models of behavior. His research and ideas have garnered some criticism, particularly from science writer Ed Yong, who points out that oxytocin boosts schadenfreude and envy. Oxytocin increases the salience of social cues, suggesting that priming effects in these experiments explain their findings. Neuroscientist Molly Crockett also disputes Zak's claims, referring to studies that show oxytocin increases gloating, bias at the expense of other groups, and in some cases decreasing cooperation; suggesting oxytocin is as much an \\"immoral molecule\\" as 'the moral molecule' Paul Zak claims. Neuromanagement Zak has coined the term \\"neuromanagement\\" to describe how findings in neuroscience can be used to create organizational cultures that are highly engaging for employees and produce high performance for organizations. He has developed a methodology called Ofactor that quantifies organizational culture and identifies how to continuously improve culture to increase trust, joy, and performance. He has used Ofactor to help organizations ranging from nonprofits to startups to Fortune 50 companies change their cultures. His Ofactor research reflects the approach advocated by his late colleague at Claremont Graduate University, management guru Peter F. Drucker, in which organizations with flat hierarchies empower employees. His 2017 book Trust Factor: The Science of Creating High- Performance Companies shows leaders of organizations how to create and sustain a culture of trust. Consumer Neuroscience Zak's lab has discovered neurologic signals that reflect engagement in stories and predict post- narrative behaviors. Some of this work was funded by DARPA to help the U.S. military reduce conflict. Corporate clients use these services to craft more effective messages and to predict the market impact of advertisements and philanthropic appeals. Media Zak is frequently interviewed in the media on topics ranging from economic policy to romantic relationships.Geddes, L. \\"With this test tube I thee wed\\". New Scientist 13 February 2010. His 2011 TED talk on oxytocin and trust has gained over a million views. He was named by Wired magazine as one of the 10 Sexiest Geeks in 2005. Zak suggests that intimate contact, using social ritual and social media such as using Twitter and Facebook raises oxytocin levels. He is a frequent public speaker on the neuroscience of daily life, including morality, storytelling, and organizational culture and writes articles for magazines and trade publication on these topics. Zak is a member of the Screen Actors Guild and has created and voiced science dialog for movies, including The Amazing Spiderman . He is a regular panelist on the Discovery Science program Outrageous Acts of Psych. News organizations often request his expertise on neuroscience. His TV appearances include Fareed Zakaria's GPS on CNN, the John Stossel show on Fox Business, the Dr. Phil show, TakePart Live on Pivot TV, Fox and Friends, Good Morning America, The Bachelorette, and ABC World News Tonight.

Bonclarken is the conference center of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church. The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church is a conservative evangelical Christian denomination that traces its roots to the Reformation, particularly the work of John Calvin and John Knox. It is used to accommodate guests of 500 people during the summer and 400 people during the winter. Bonclarken has two fully equipped kitchens and conference centers that can hold up to 1200 people in their meeting centers. Purchased in 1921 by the ARP, Bonclarken is used for Christian education, and hosts activities for youth and adults alike. There is also a chapel on the campus for worship services whenever groups or churches have special services there. The chapel is also where the ARP Church conducts most of its annual General Synod business.\\"\\" History The Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church began holding a summer Bible conference in Gastonia, North Carolina in 1915. The conference was very popular and well attended. However, in 1920, the conference planners learned the facility hosting the conference was to be sold. Efforts to buy the facility were unsuccessful, so a new meeting location was needed. Looking for a location with cooler summer temperatures, the mountains of western North Carolina were selected to begin the search. God's providence led a realtor in Hendersonville to suggest a particular location: a beautiful sixty-three-acre estate, containing a massive home and the Heidelberg Gardens, for sale in Flat Rock. The location was perfect for the conference and was purchased on August 31, 1921. \\"Heidelberg House History: http://www.bonclarken.org/forms/househistory.pdf \\" Old Bonclarken Sign off Greenville Hwy. Meaning of name After the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church purchased the property from Dr. Arthur Guerard in 1921, a contest was held among members of the Church to find a suitable name for what was to become the denomination's retreat center. Sallie Miller Brice of Chester, South Carolina offered the following: \\"I submit a name for our Assembly Grounds. It is Bon-clar-ken, and it has this meaning, Bon from the Latin, Bonus – 'good', clar from the Latin clarus – 'clear', ken from the Scotch – 'vision'. Bon-clar-ken – Good-clear-vision.\\" Mission Bonclarken's mission is \\"to provide and promote a Christian environment for inspiration and renewal, worship, education, fellowship, and recreation by the power of the Holy Spirit.\\" Bonclarken is an ideal place for churches to go to retreats and camps. During such retreats and camps, students have opportunities to fellowship with fellow believers from all across the Eastern United States. Activities held at White Oak Lake, the YAB, and numerous other facilities allow students to make lasting friendships in a welcoming environment. Notable staff Bonclarken has employed many artists in its history. Americana singer/songwriter, Steven Hardy; EDM producer Adam Donahoe; noted kazooist Todd Hardy (brother of Steven); and multi-media artist Emma Mossford. References *Murdock, P.B. (1975).

Chandler Hospital along Rose Street at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, Kentucky is the flagship component of UK HealthCare. It is named for twice-former Governor of Kentucky A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler. The 945 bed medical facility features the Markey Cancer Center, the Kentucky Children's Hospital, the Gill Heart Institute, the Kentucky Neuroscience Institute and the Center for Advanced Surgery. The hospital is the only Level I trauma center in central and eastern Kentucky, and the only facility in the region to play host to a Level IV neonatal intensive care unit for infants. It also includes a 100-bed intensive care facility and 17 operating rooms. Ground was broken for the hospital in 1955, when Governor Chandler recommended that the Kentucky General Assembly appropriate $5 million for the creation of the University of Kentucky College of Medicine and a medical center at the university. This was completed after a series of studies were conducted that highlighted the health needs of the citizens, as well as the need to train more physicians for the state.  Future  = Phase I = The University of Kentucky began the add-on construction of the one-million sq. ft. Albert B. Chandler Hospital in May 2008. The $450 million hospital is one of the largest projects in state history in terms of size and impact. Nearby, a parking structure was built for the patient care facility to replace another structure that had to be demolished to increase the hospital's footprint. The first phase of the new hospital opened July 2010. Design work regarding the new facility began in August 2005. This was due to a need to modernize the hospital due to the \\"rapidly changing nature of health care delivery\\" and other advances, along with a sharp increase in patients. The facility was part of a much larger project: A pre-construction rendering of the new Chandler Hospital looking from the corner of Transcript Avenue and South Limestone. The $450 million patient care facility was constructed as a ten-floor structure. There is currently a four-floor base with an emergency department, radiology services, eight new operating rooms, same day surgery facilities, a post-anesthesia care unit, and a recovery area, along with a new lobby, coffee shop, gift shop, and waiting areas. Constructed above this are two separate six-floor patient bed towers. The patient rooms are mostly private and very flexible, in that they can be converted into intensive care units with ease. The original plans called for one patient tower, but this was amended to include two because of cost savings analysis. UK Healthcare would save $10 to $12 million by constructing the second patient tower instead of adding it in on a later date. It is also advantageous because the construction plans and cranes would already be in place and that disruptions would be minimal. On January 23, 2007, it was announced that an additional 192 beds would be requested, adding two floors to each patient tower; it would only add two months to construction. A state certificate was filed because the hospital saw a record number of patients in December. Accounting for an annual 4.5% growth rate, the hospital would be at 100% capacity by 2011. The hospital, however, has been achieving a 10% annual growth rate. The hospital is currently at 85% capacity. To solve the potential issue of patient crowding, the University of Kentucky signed a letter of intent to purchase Samaritan Hospital adjacent to the campus on February 15, 2007. It was expected to hold as many as \\"100 UK patients\\" and solve all crowding issues until the construction was completed. The university would operate it for at least ten years but have an option to extend it. Funding for the new patient care facility was generated through existing hospital revenues and bond issues. On May 30, 2007, ground was broken for phase one of the new hospital. = Phase II and III = During Phase II and III, the existing Chandler Hospital will be demolished in favor of a new facility for outpatient care that will be linked with inpatient services in the patient care facility constructed under Phase I. Medical research and educational support structures will be relocated primarily west of South Limestone. Phase II is expected to cost at least $175 million.

It plays in the Championnat National 2. They play at the Stade de l'Aar in Schiltigheim, which has a capacity of 2,500. The club was established on 1 March 1914 as Sports-Abteilung des Evangelischen Jugendbundes Schiltigheim, an ethnically-German church-based youth club in what was at the time Elsass in the German Empire. They adopted they name Fussball-Klub Schiltigheim in 1915. Following the end of World War I and the return of Alsace to France, the club was renamed Sporting Club de Schiltigheim in 1919. History =Between France and Germany= During the interwar period, SC was a competitive local side that claimed the championship of the Alsace Champion Division d'Honneur in 1937, as well a regional cup title and a clutch of junior division titles in the mid-1930s. The club's rise was interrupted when Alsace came under German control after the Nazi invasion early in World War II. Like many other clubs in occupied territories, the Schiltigheim side became part of German football competition and played four seasons (1940–44) as Sport-Club Schiltigheim in what was initially called the Gauliga Unterelass (I) – later the Gauliga Elsass – one of several top-flight regional divisions. They earned a second-place result there in 1940–41 before slipping to become a lower table side.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag SC returned to French competition following the return of Alsace to France in 1945. =Postwar play= Following the war, SC was part of the Division d’Honneur Alsace until a title win advanced them to Division 4 play. Another title in 1993 that advanced the club to the Championnat de France amateur 2 level play where they spent four seasons until being sent down in 1997. Schiltigheim won its way to the Championnat de France Amateur Gr. B (IV) after a championship in the Championnat de France Amateur 2 Gr. C (V) in 2003. The team then struggled, narrowly missing relegation in 2006 before suffering consecutive demotions in the following two seasons. SC finished in second place in the Division d’Honneur Alsace (VI) in 2009. In 2010, the club were champions of Division d'Honneur Alsace and gained promotion to CFA 2.

Definition A fashion blog can cover many things such as specific items of clothing and accessories, beauty tips, trends in various apparel markets (haute couture, prêt-à-porter, etc.), celebrity fashion choices and street fashion trends.Corcoran, Cate T. Blogging for bags, \\"Women's Wear Daily\\", October 23, 2006.Weil, Jennifer with contributions from Corcoran, Cate T. and Moir, Jane. In their sites, \\"Women's Wear Daily\\", June 29, 2006. They cover fashion at all levels from the largest fashion design houses to the smallest independent designers. Many fashion blogs could also be categorised as shopping blogs, similar to the content of fashion magazines. Some retailers in the fashion industry have started blogs to promote their products. Some blogs focus more on fashion advice, featuring how-to articles for the lay reader. Articles discuss clothing fit, the matching and complementing of colors, and other information on clothes wearing and care along with prescriptive advice on adhering to basic standards and recent trends. Impact on the fashion industry Fashion is a multibillion-dollar industry that has considerable impact on the way ordinary people dress and present themselves and relies heavily on media and advertising to communicate the producer's preferences and goals and influence public perception through various types of promotion; at the same time, fashion can be influenced by social change and counter-trends outside the producer, retailer or advertiser's control. As fashion is driven by trends within and without the fashion industry, fashion blogs and other \\"new media\\" outside the control of traditional establishment represent a disruptive innovation to the social dynamics of mass media and fashion consumption in modern consumer society. It is likely that the blogosphere will have a considerable long-term influence on the industry, as the number of fashion based blogs continue to grow, with increasing numbers of consumers able to create and modify the media that they consume, and traditional producers and advertisers adapting their practices to avoid dilution of their own influence. =From the industry’s standpoint= During the 2011 New York City Fashion Week, top-tier fashion designers, Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough (owners and designers of Proenza Schouler), took the time out of their ‘hectic schedules’ during fashion week to help promote the work of fashion bloggers. The two were interviewed by Imran Amed, founder, and editor of The Business of Fashion website. In the 5:15 minute long interview, the two fashion designers were asked various questions from an audience of fashion bloggers, including their personal opinions on the effects of fashion blog writing, how it influences the fashion industry as a whole, and how fashion blog posts affect their designing and selling process. When asked about their thoughts on the overall effect of the fashion blogs, McCollough stated, “Blogs posting things about us, going viral, spreading throughout the internet… it has an extraordinary impact on the business”. They also stated how in the past, they would have to wait for three, four days to hear a review on their line, but now the feedback comes almost instantly. When asked about how the blogs directly affect their own designs, they explained that while they do read numerous blogs daily, they try to take each criticism (positive or negative) with a grain of salt, “We try not to obsess over it” stated McCollough. Founder of Independent Fashion Blogger (IFB), Jennine Jacob, stated how thrilled she was to get the validation from high-end fashion designers (such as Proenza Schouler) that fashion blogging has an incredible impact on the fashion world. Imran Amed stated that there will always be designers and editors that will never fully wrap their head on the huge impact fashion blogging and social media has on the industry, but on the other side of the spectrum, there are numerous designers, editors, branders and writers that do understand and are “coming on board”. He also states that this is a fairly new phenomenon that will take time for the fashion world to reap the full benefits. The New York Times \\"Style\\" section writer, Eric Wilson, did an extensive study on the impact of fashion bloggers on the fashion industry for one of his style columns. Wilson wrote that these bloggers have ascended ‘from the nosebleed seats to the front row’ in the past year and that the divide between the ‘high code’ editors with a professional opinion and the ‘amateur’ fashion bloggers is beginning to disintegrate. Wilson interviewed prominent publicists, editors, and designers. Publicist Kelly Cutrone stated that over the past two years, there has been a complete change in who is writing about fashion. Not only does Cutrone say she needs to keep a watch on the editors of mainstream writings, such as Vogue and Elle, but now she needs to monitor on the millions of fashion bloggers around the world. Cutrone goes on the later state that once these bloggers post anything on the internet, it never comes off, and it now becomes the first thing that the designers will see. =From a reader’s standpoint= The blogosphere has indeed opened up many doors for the fashion industry, one of which is allowing the ordinary people to partake in the 'elite' fashion world and discuss their likes and dislikes on the way fashion is presented in the media. In 2008, the Pulitzer Prize winning fashion writer and former blogger Robin Givhan, claimed that fashion blogs had democratized the fashion industry. Givhan had also written in Harpers Bazaar that 'The rise of the fashion blogger has evolved [fashion] from an aristocratic business dominated by omnipotent designers into a democratic one in which everyone has access to stylistic clothes...the average people, too often estranged from fashion, is not taking ownership of it'. A similar statement was said by Constance White, the style director for eBay and former fashion journalist, saying that the impact of the fashion blogosphere has allowed the whole population to take ownership of the fashion world, including people of all different races, genders, and social standings. The Daily Mail writer Karen Kay suggested once in an interview that blogs allow anyone to both critique and praise designers, regardless of the often ‘needed’ professional opinion, with the help fashion blogs, the consumers are helping to set the trends. Unlike fashion-focused magazines and television shows, fashion blogs are able to be updated more frequently, keeping up to date with the new and up-and-coming fashion trends. =From an advertising standpoint= Many of these fashion blogs also serve as a source of advertisement for both designers and fashion retail stores. These advertisements have had a heavy influence on fashion designers of various standings, helping to give a name to small up-and-coming designers as well as bringing high-end designers back to life. Many of the top fashion bloggers are said to have received free samples of the designer pieces that they have mentioned in their blogs and some top fashion bloggers got paid for wearing and publishing a brand name product on their Instagram account., \\"Random Fashion Blogger from Utah Makes $1 Million a Year\\", June 12, 2014. Accessed October 4, 2014. In a study conducted through the Biz360 Community, it was found that over 53% of the New York City Fashion Week converge had come from online articles and fashion blogs. While a vast portion of what was written in these blogs came from various mainstream fashion resource magazine and newspaper articles, such as Coutorture and New York Magazine, these fashion blogs provided a larger viewing and reading audience for the fashion week. In the past years, American Express has become increasingly involved in New York City Fashion Week, and in 2010 American Express sponsored Evolving Influence, the first international bloggers' conference in New York City. During the conference, many surveys and studies took place about the usefulness and tactics used in fashion blogs. During the study, it was found that bloggers are more comfortable reporting in real-time and incorporating social tools in their opinions of runway trends and designers. After Fashion Week, it was found that 6.37% of all articles written about or related to Fashion Week had mentioned the Evolving Influence main sponsor, American Express. These blogs were not directly paid to mention American Express, so they served as a free source of advertisement for American Express. Number of fashion blogs There is considerable disagreement regarding the number of fashion blogs in existence. In a February 2006 Women's Wear Daily article, Corcoran stated: > There is an enormous, and growing, number of fashion and shopping-related > blogs: about 2 million, according to Technorati Inc., [...] or slightly less > than 10 percent of the 27 million blogs the company tracks. (That number > includes blogs in languages that use the Roman alphabet and that contain > anything fashion-related, including sites such as Pink Is the New Blog, > which focuses on celebrities.)Corcoran, Cate T. The blogs that took over the > tents, \\"Women's Wear Daily\\", February 6, 2006. It is likely that this figure is inflated by a substantial number of personal blogs that mention fashion. These are not considered fashion blogs using the criteria above. All other estimates of the popularity of fashion blogs are considerably lower. In September 2005, La Ferla stated that \\"as little as a year ago, the number of [fashion bloggers] could be counted in the dozens. Today there are hundreds\\".La Ferla, Ruth. \\"Online, Feisty Critics\\", The New York Times, September 8, 2005. Accessed November 24, 2006. Lara Zamiatin estimated in November 2006 that there are now \\"several hundred fashion blogs\\".Zamiatin, Lara. Let slip the blogs of wore, \\"Sydney Morning Herald\\", July 27, 2006. Accessed November 24, 2006. Types of fashion blogs =By writer's expertise= Fashion blogs may be written by insiders, outsiders, or aspiring insiders. Insiders are people who work (or have previously worked) in the fashion industry or for the traditional fashion media. In addition, some fashion insiders write occasionally as guest bloggers on larger sites. For example, the fashion designer Nanette Lepore has contributed to Glam.com. Outsiders are people who know a lot (or at least have strong opinions) about fashion, usually by virtue of being very dedicated consumers of fashion. Aspiring insiders are people who want to work in the fashion industry or media and believe their blog may provide a ‘back door’ entry into a mainstream fashion writing job. =By ownership= Fashion blogs may be owned either by individuals or by companies. The types of individuals running fashion blogs are listed above. The types of companies now running fashion blogs include large mainstream media organizations and fashion retailers. Condé Nast Publications is a mainstream media organization with fashion blogs. Fashion retailers with blogs include Bluefly, Queen of Suburbia, and Splendora. History Fashion blogs first appeared in the blogosphere prior to 2002.Sinclair, Jenny. Fashion blogs, \\"The Age\\", October 17, 2002. Accessed November 18, 2006. Both the number of fashion blogs and the number of media mentions of fashion blogs has grown considerably since then. Published accounts of the growing number of fashion blogs are mentioned above, and a Facteva search reveals that media articles mentioning \\"fashion blogs\\" grew from one in 2002 to over 100 in 2006. In 2006, the commercial success and growing profile of the fashion bloggers were the two main themes in the coverage of fashion blogs. In 2009, CNN wrote about a blogger, Rumi Neely of Fashion Toast, who went from a small website to the runway for a popular label. =Early fashion blogs= Fashion blogs first appeared in the blogosphere prior to 2002, and Kathryn Finney, founder of Budget Fashionista, was invited to New York Fashion Week as early as September 2003; a short time later, Fashiontribes.com was being seated fourth row at shows like Bill Blass. Paris-based American fashion blogger Diane Pernet, founder of A Shaded View on Fashion, has been called \\"the original style blogger\\" by The New York Times, and has been a fashion blogger since 2005. In 2004, Bryan Grey-Yambao founded his namesake blog Bryanboy. He helped set the standards for designer “gifting” and disclosure of same in the fashion blogosphere, an arena where it is currently considered acceptable for a blogger to take international airfare, accommodation, designer goods and sometimes even celebrity-style appearance fees from the major brands they cover.https://observer.com/2012/02/bryanboy- new-york-fashion-week-anna-wintour-karl-lagerfeld-marc-jacobs/ By 2008, Tina Craig and Kelly Cook of Bag Snob.com were seated second row at shows like Diane von Furstenberg and Oscar de la Renta.Dodes, Rachel. \\"Bloggers get under the tent\\", The Wall Street Journal, September 12, 2006. Accessed November 18, 2006. The fashion blogs that attracted media attention in 2002 include two that are still in existence: LookOnline Daily Fashion Report and She She Me. In 2004, Michelle Madhok introduced SheFinds.com, \\"an online shopping publication\\". By 2005, the site earned $300,000 per year, although most of that revenue went towards running expenses and Madhok paid herself just $40,000 per year.Tahmincioglu, Eve. When the Boss Is Last in Line for a Paycheck, The New York Times, March 22, 2007. Accessed May 29, 2008. =Mainstream media acceptance of fashion blogging= Fashion blogs are increasingly becoming a part of the mainstream fashion press. An increasing number of fashion bloggers were invited to designers' fashion shows in 2006 compared to previous years. Large advertisers like H&M; and Gap have bought advertising on fashion blogs, and other large companies like the underwear- maker Jockey are targeting fashion blogs in their PR efforts. Many big media organizations have started fashion blogs and the best fashion bloggers are now also being offered mainstream media positions. (See above for more details.) Fashion blogging is also now regarded as worthy of mainstream media coverage. The reference list below shows the very high caliber of media publications that have written about fashion blogs. These publications include the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Fast Company and the Sydney Morning Herald. =Commercialization of fashion blogging= Fashion blogging is rapidly becoming a highly profitable new media business, with a mixture of independent blogs and well-funded fashion blog networks competing to dominate the space. Other commercially successful independent fashion blogs include Budget Fashionista, which reportedly brings in $600,000 a year in revenue\\"13 Questions for a Fashion Blogger - Kathryn Finney\\", New York Daily News, October 17, 2007. and The Bag Snob, which \\"generates a six-figure income, mainly from advertising\\". By 2008 SheFinds.com was generating $400,000 in revenue per year. Personal style bloggers like Aimee Song from SongofStyle.com has told WWD that she gets paid anywhere from a couple thousand to 50,000 dollars for hosting an event or Instagramming a brand. There have also been a series of business deals that have brought serious investor money into the fashion blogging space.

They can be seen from much of the Greater Vancouver area, as far as Robert Burnaby Park in East Burnaby, south to parts of Surrey, and from the west on the Howe Sound Islands and the Sunshine Coast. Along with the Lions Gate Bridge named in their honour, these twin summits have become one of the most recognizable Vancouver landmarks. The city's BC Lions CFL football team is also named in their honour. Lions Gate Entertainment which was founded in Vancouver in July, 1997 is also named for the peaks. Geology The Lions are composed of hornblende diorite, the oldest plutonic rock on the West Coast of Canada. Hiking and rock climbing routes Hikers can climb up to the ridge between the East and West Lion peaks using either the Binkert Trail leading up from Lions Bay, or the Howe Sound Crest Trail. The Binkert Trail, named after Paul Binkert of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club, is one of the most popular in the Lower Mainland. Hiking to the ridge from Lions Bay takes approximately four hours and gains in elevation. Most hikers stop there as both the East and West Lion peaks require rock climbing equipment and expertise. The East Lion is out-of- bounds for climbing as it is located in the Greater Vancouver watershed. Early ascents According, to an article by Steven Threndyle in The Greater Vancouver Book,The Greater Vancouver Book, an urban encyclopedia, Chuck Davis – Editor in Chief. Linkman Press. 1997. \\"the earliest recorded climb of the West Lion in 1889 happened almost by accident. A group of hunters following a herd of goats found themselves at the top with no place to go but down. The hunting party was guided by Squamish First Nations Chief Joe Capilano. One of the members of the hunting team was Doctor Henry Bell-Irving, who asked Chief Capilano if he could time one of the chief's young natives to see how long it would take him to run from the base of the West Lion to the summit. The youth stripped completely naked, made the round trip ascent and descent in under 20 minutes. With its steep granitic face, the East Lion was believed to be impossible to scale. That did not deter John Latta and his two brothers from setting out to climb the East Lion in 1903. Hearing that climbers often used ropes for mountaineering ascents, they packed one along but actually had no idea of how to use it. Their technique was to grasp the small shrubs and bushes growing out of the cracks in the rock. The Latta brothers also climbed the West Lion on their way out. \\"The Sisters\\" The Indigenous Squamish people named these two prominent peaks \\"Ch'ich'iyúy Elxwíkn\\" (translates as 'Twin Sisters'). These mountains remain sacred for their legal marker of a peace treaty, family lineage histories, and spiritual value. The two peaks were transformed by the Sky Brothers, or Transformers, after twin sisters that had married with Haida twins created the path for the war to end between the Squamish and Haida people. The families that made the Peace Treaty and married together still live in the Squamish and Haida Nations. Sometime around 1890, Judge John Hamilton Gray proposed that Canada rename the mountain peaks to lions couchant from heraldry.British Columbia Place Names. G.P.V. and Helen B. Akrigg.

Title On the title page of the first published edition (1653), the play's title is rendered as follows: No \\\\begin{Bmatrix} Wit \\\\\\\\\\\\ Help \\\\end{Bmatrix} Like~a~Woman's This title is difficult to translate into conventional prose; most subsequent editions have called it No Wit, No Help Like a Woman's, but the 2007 Middleton complete works for Oxford University Press renders it as No Wit/Help Like a Woman's. Date External evidence on the play's date is lacking. In the text of the play, the character Weatherwise repeatedly refers to almanacs; he quotes sixteen almanac proverbs or catchphrases — fifteen of which derive from the 1611 edition of Thomas Bretnor's almanac, a fact that yields the obvious likely date for the play. This procedure was not atypical of Middleton's practice; when he composed his Inner Temple Masque in 1618, he used eleven proverbs from Bretnor's 1618 almanac.See Lowell Johnson's Introduction to his edition of the play, p. xii. The play was revived in 1638. James Shirley staged it at the Werburgh Street Theatre in Dublin, and wrote a Prologue for the work that was published with Middleton's text in the first edition. Publication The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 9 September 1653 by the bookseller Humphrey Moseley. Moseley printed the first edition four years later, in 1657, in an octavo edition printed for Moseley by Thomas Newcomb. Nineteen copies of the 1657 octavo survive, an unusually large total for a play of its era. Middleton's original was not reprinted prior to the 19th century.Johnson, pp. xxi–xxii. Authorship Both the Stationers' Register entry and the title page of the first edition attribute the play to \\"Tho. Middleton.\\"Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 441. Given the play's strong similarities with Middleton's other works, the accuracy of this attribution has never been disputed. 19th-century critic Charles W. Stork suggested William Rowley as a possible collaborator, though his hypothesis has been rejected due to lack of supporting evidence. Source and influences Middleton borrowed the main plot of No Wit from a 1589 play, a comedy by Giambattista Della Porta titled La Sorella (\\"The Sister\\"). In turn, Middleton's play served as a source for a contemporaneous Latin scholastic play by Samuel Brooke called Adelphe. The extant manuscript of Adelphe states that that play was first performed in 1611, a validation for the dating of Middleton's play. The play's subplot, which centers on Master Low-Water — and which was original with Middleton rather than borrowed from another source — had a long theatrical life over the coming centuries. It was adapted for the 1677 play The Counterfeit Bridegroom, or The Defeated Widow, a work variously ascribed to either Aphra Behn or Thomas Betterton. The Counterfeit Bridegroom in turn was adapted into William Taverner's The Artful Husband (1717), which then became George Colman the Elder's The Female Chevalier (1778), which became both Alicia Sheridan's The Ambiguous Lover (1781) and William Macready the Elder's The Bank Note, or Lesson for Ladies (1795).Johnson, pp. xiii–xiv, xx–xxi.

But, despite this, the Prologue is confident that, as long as everyone can pay attention and understand the play, they will all be satisfactorily entertained. =Act I= Scene 1: A street near Sir Oliver Twilight's house Master Sandfield is ready to kill his friend, Philip Twilight, because he believes Philip has been courting the woman he loves, Jane Sunset. Philip's servant, Savourwit, prevents Sandfield from killing Philip by explaining that the match between Philip and Jane is all Philip's father's doing and Philip is already married! A complicated story unfolds: :Ten years ago, Sir Oliver Twilight's wife and daughter, Lady Twilight and Grace, were kidnapped by 'Dunkirks' (French marauders) as they were crossing the English Channel on their way to Jersey; they were consequently sold and separated. Twilight didn't hear anything from either of them until a few months ago, when he received a letter saying that his wife's freedom could be bought for six hundred crowns. Twilight sent Philip and Savourwit to Jersey with the ransom money. On the way there, Philip and Savourwit stopped in a small town, where they wasted most of the money on women and partying. Philip also met and married a young woman, Grace. With the money gone and nothing to show for it, Philip and Savourwit returned home and told Sir Oliver that Lady Twilight was dead; they also told him that Philip's new wife Grace was his long-lost daughter and the ransom money had been spent to buy her freedom. This entire scheme was the brainchild of Savourwit, who prides himself on his knack for 'invention'. Sandfield congratulates Savourwit on his 'invention' and makes up with Philip. Savourwit tells the friends that he has a new scheme in mind: :Because Sir Oliver Twilight believes that his 'long-lost daughter' Grace is still a maiden, he has made arrangements to marry her off to Weatherwise, a silly old fool. To get rid of Weatherwise, Savourwit will tell Sir Oliver that Sandfield wants to marry Grace: he is certain that Sir Oliver will prefer Sandfield as a suitor, especially because Sandfield does not require a dowry. Thus, Sandfield can pretend to marry Grace (a marriage that will not be legal because Grace is already married to Philip) and Philip can pretend to marry Jane (a marriage that will not be legal because Philip is already married to Grace). The couples can all live together under Sir Oliver Twilight's roof, maintaining appearances during the day, and swapping spouses at night. This way, Philip can still be with his wife (even though he has to pretend that she is his sister during the day) and Sandfield can be with Jane (even though he will have to pretend that she is his sister-in-law during the day). Lady Goldenfleece, a rich widow, enters, followed she by her suitors: Sir Gilbert Lambston, Master Pepperton, and Master Overdone. They are followed by the two old men, Sir Oliver Twilight and Master Sunset, and their daughters, Grace Twilight and Jane Sunset. Savourwit notes that Lady Goldenfleece's recently deceased husband was a notorious usurer; he nearly doubled his wealth shortly before he died by seizing the property of a gentleman named Master Low-water. Lady Goldenfleece greets Jane and Grace and alludes to a 'secret' regarding the girls. They beg her to tell them what the secret is, but she refuses. In an aside, Jane says that she wishes Lady Goldenfleece would be more kind to her relatives, the Low-waters. Everyone exits except Sir Oliver Twilight and Savourwit. Savourwit tells Sir Oliver that Sandfield is desperate to marry Grace and will take her without a dowry. Sir Oliver is pleased and promises to get rid of Weatherwise immediately. Savourwit exits; Weatherwise enters. Sir Oliver tells Weatherwise that he has changed his mind and does not want him to marry Grace. Weatherwise says that he will become a suitor to Lady Goldenfleece. Scene 2: A room in Low-water's house Mistress Low-water mourns her family's ruin and curses Lady Goldenfleece. Jane enters to ask Mistress Low-water if she knows anything about the mysterious secret that Lady Goldenfleece alluded to earlier. Mistress Low-water says it might have something to do with \\"some piece of money or land\\" that was bequeathed to Grace and Jane \\"by some departing friend on their deathbed\\". Jane thanks Mistress Low-water and exits. A footman enters with a letter for Mistress Low-water from Sir Gilbert Lambston, a wealthy knight. Sir Gilbert wants to make Mistress Low-water his mistress and, in the letter, promises to double his previous offer of money if she agrees. He expects to marry Lady Goldenfleece soon, and will thus be able to pay for Mistress Low-water for her sexual services. Mistress Low-water says that Sir Gilbert's villainy almost makes her feel sorry for her 'enemy' Lady Goldenfleece. She swears that she will never become Sir Gilbert's mistress, but says that the letter is \\"welcome,\\" hinting that she has a plan in mind. Sir Gilbert enters. Mistress Low-water asks him to give her one-day to consider his offer. He agrees and exits. Master Low-water enters. Mistress Low-water tells him that she thinks she has a way to restore them to their former wealth. Master Low-water agrees to go along with her plan. Scene 3: A room in Sir Oliver Twilight's house A Dutch merchant enters with news from Sir Oliver's wife: she wonders why Sir Oliver hasn't sent a ransom for her yet. Sir Oliver is shocked to hear that his wife is still alive. He tells the merchant that he sent his son and servant with the ransom ten weeks ago; they brought his daughter back, but said that his wife had died. The Dutch Merchant vows that he has seen Lady Twilight alive within the past month and asks if he can see the 'daughter' that Philip and Savourwit brought back with them. Grace enters. The Dutch Merchant says that he has seen her before, at an inn in Antwerp. Grace worries that she has been found out and tells the merchant that he must be mistaken. The merchant sees through Savourwit's scheme; he tells Sir Oliver that he has been deceived by his son and servant: his wife is not dead, and this is not his real daughter. Sir Oliver isn't sure what he should believe. He sends Grace away. The Dutch merchant says that he must leave for a moment to attend to a business matter. He leaves his little son in Sir Oliver's care and promises to return soon. Savourwit enters and Sir Oliver confronts him with the merchant's allegations. Savourwit denies all. To cover himself, Savourwit pretends to have a conversation in Dutch with the merchant's little son, who speaks in a kind of pidgin English. Savourwit's 'Dutch' is almost pure gibberish (words such as \\"pisse\\" surface occasionally). Savourwit tells Sir Oliver that the boy has told him that the Dutch Merchant is crazy, and prone to telling wild tales. Sir Oliver is still uncertain what he should believe. The Dutch merchant re-enters. Sir Oliver tells him that Savourwit has spoken with his son, who claims that the Dutch Merchant is crazy. After conferring with his son, the Dutch Merchant says that Savourwit is lying. Sir Oliver realizes he has been deceived by Savourwit. He invites the Dutch merchant to stay at his home. =Act II= Scene 1: A room in Weatherwise's house Lady Goldenfleece is dining at Weatherwise's home with her suitors, Weatherwise, Sir Gilbert Lambston, Master Pepperton and Master Overdone. The suitors compete for Lady Goldenfleece's attention. Weatherwise is obsessed with almanacs, calendars, phases of the moon, the zodiac, etc. Lambston is the most aggressive suitor: he gives Lady Goldenfleece a big kiss in front of everyone. Pepperton and Overdone secretly agree to work together against Lambston. Mistress Low-water enters, disguised as a 'Gallant Gentleman'; her husband, Master Low-water, poses as her servant. Lady Goldenfleece is immediately attracted to the 'Gallant Gentleman'. The 'Gallant Gentleman' calls Sir Gilbert a villain and gives Lady Goldenfleece the letter in which Sir Gilbert offered to pay Mistress Low-water to become his mistress. Lady Goldenfleece is shocked, and throws Sir Gilbert out. The other suitors are pleased to see Sir Gilbert eliminated. Scene 2: The street outside Sir Oliver Twilight's house Sandfield, Philip and Savourwit worry about what might happen to them now that their scheme has been discovered. Philip attempts to commit suicide, but Savourwit and Sandfield stop him. Lady Twilight, Philip's mother, enters. She has recently been rescued from captivity by the scholar, Beveril, who accompanies her. Philip greets his mother warmly and thanks Beveril for rescuing his mother. Beveril, who happens to be Mistress Low- water's brother, asks Philip how his sister is doing. Philip regretfully informs him of the Low-waters' recent misfortune. On Savourwit's advice, Philip takes his mother aside, and confesses how he faked her death and spent the ransom. After Lady Twilight agrees to forgive his transgressions, he begs her to pretend that Grace is actually his sister. Lady Twilight agrees to protect her son. Scene 3: A room in Lady Goldenfleece's house Mistress Low- water and her husband, still disguised as a Gallant Gentleman and his servant, are at Lady Goldenfleece's house, waiting for an interview with her. Lady Goldenfleece's suitors, Weatherwise, Pepperton and Overdone arrive, and the 'Gallant Gentleman' scolds 'his' 'Servant' loudly, acting as though 'he' is now the lord of the house. The suitors assume that the 'Gallant Gentleman' has married Lady Goldenfleece under their noses. They exit, disappointed. Lady Goldenfleece enters and apologizes for making the 'Gallant Gentleman' wait. After a good deal of heated flirting, the 'Gallant Gentleman' promises Lady Goldenfleece that he has never slept with or courted any other woman (these oaths are, of course, ironically true). Lady Goldenfleece is swept off her feet. They kiss. Weatherwise, Pepperton and Overdone enter with renewed hopes: a servant has told them that Lady Goldenfleece and the Gentleman haven't married yet. Lady Goldenfleece is not happy to see the suitors. To get rid of them, she kisses the 'Gallant Gentleman', announces her intention to marry him, and exits. The suitors exit. The 'Gallant Gentleman' asks Lady Goldenfleece's clown, Pickadillie, if he knows of anyone who can write an entertainment for the wedding. Pickadillie suggests the scholar Beveril. Mistress Low-water is overjoyed to see her brother, but remains in characters as the 'Gallant Gentleman.' Beveril says he cannot compose an entertainment for the wedding because Lady Goldenfleece has wronged his sister. The 'Gallant Gentleman' encourages Beveril to withhold judgment until he has made Lady Goldenfleece's acquaintance. Lady Goldenfleece enters. Lady Goldenfleece and Beveril are immediately attracted to each other. =Act III= Scene 1: A street near Lady Goldenfleece's house Weatherwise, Pepperton and Overdone meet Sir Gilbert Lambston on the street and tell him about Lady Goldenfleece's engagement. They all vow to find some way to disgrace Lady Goldenfleece. Pickadillie enters and tells the suitors that Beveril has been contracted to compose an entertainment for Lady Goldenfleece's wedding. Beveril enters. Speaking to himself, he says is having trouble composing the entertainment because he has fallen madly in love with Lady Goldenfleece. The suitors introduce themselves to Beveril and volunteer to perform in the wedding entertainment. Beveril suggests that they play Earth, Air, Fire and Water. The suitors exit, making plans to 'poison' the entertainment and disgrace Lady Goldenfleece. Mistress Low-water and her husband enter, still disguised as the 'Gallant Gentleman' and 'Servant', and overhear Beveril declaring his secret love for Lady Goldenfleece. Mistress Low-water is quite pleased. She says that she will work to bring her brother and Lady Goldenfleece together. =Act IV= Scene 1: A room in Sir Oliver Twilight's house Sir Oliver says he is very happy to have his wife back. He thanks Beveril for rescuing her and scolds Philip and Savourwit for faking her death. Lady Twilight says that rumors of her death were circulating during Philip and Savourwit's time in Jersey (a lie) and begs Sir Oliver to excuse them because the whole mix-up was obviously a misunderstanding, not a scheme. Sir Oliver raises the matter of the 'minion' (Grace) that Philip and Savourwit brought home to pass off as the Twilights' daughter. Lady Twilight says that she will be able to recognize her true daughter immediately because she has seen her several times since the kidnapping (another lie). Grace is brought in. Feigning jubilation, Lady Twilight says that Grace is definitely her daughter. Sir Oliver apologizes to Philip and Savourwit and admits them back into his good graces. With all the problems out of the way, he continues to make plans to marry Grace to Sandfield and Philip to Jane. Everyone exits except Lady Twilight, Grace, Philip and Savourwit. Lady Twilight notes that there is something peculiarly familiar about Grace's face, and asks who Grace's mother was. Grace says she doesn't know: she and her mother were kidnapped by Dunkirks and separated ten years ago; all she knows is that her mother was an English gentlewoman. Lady Twilight realizes that Grace is her true daughter; in fact, she is wearing an earring that Lady Twilight gave her when she was a baby. Philip is horrified to learn that he has been sleeping with his sister. Lady Twilight tells Philip that his sin of incest was committed in ignorance, so it can be forgiven. Lady Twilight and Grace exit. Lamenting his ill-fortune, Philip says good-bye to Savourwit and says he is leaving home forever. Savourwit convinces him to stick around long enough to see Lady Goldenfleece's wedding. Scene 2: A room in Lady Goldenfleece's house Pickadillie observes as servants make preparations for Lady Goldenfleece's wedding. Scene 3: A room in Lady Goldenfleece's house Music plays. Lady Goldenfleece and the 'Gallant Gentleman,' now married, enter arm-in-arm. Sir Oliver Twilight, Master Sunset, the Dutch Merchant, Lady Twilight, Grace, Jane Sunset, Philip, Savourwit, Master Sandfield and Master Low-water (disguised as a servant) follow. Master Low-water tells his wife that Beveril is still deeply infatuated with Lady Goldenfleece. Mistress Low-water asks him if he has prepared 'the letter'. Master Low-water says he has. Beveril enters to introduce the entertainment. The entertainment begins. Lady Goldenfleece's former suitors enter, dressed as 'Fire' (Sir Gilbert Lambston), 'Air' (Weatherwise), 'Water' (Overdone) and 'Earth' (Pepperton). Rather than reciting the parts Beveril has composed, each suitor recites a speech insulting Lady Goldenfleece. When the entertainment is finished, the suitors reveal their true identities and exit, satisfied that they have fulfilled their vow to see Lady Goldenfleece disgraced. Beveril apologizes for the fiasco. Lady Goldenfleece forgives him. Lady Goldenfleece says good night to the wedding guests, who will spend the night at her house. =Act V= Scene 1: A room in Lady Goldenfleece's house Lady Goldenfleece urges her new 'husband', to come to bed. 'He' resists her, claiming that 'he' cannot enjoy his marriage because 'he' knows that Lady Goldenfleece's fortune was wrongfully acquired. Lady Goldenfleece begs 'him' to reconsider, but 'he' will not relent. She exits with a heavy heart. Master Low-water enters and tells his wife that he has delivered the letter she wrote to Beveril. Beveril enters on the balcony, reading the letter aloud. The letter is supposedly from Lady Goldenfleece, but was actually written by Lady Low-water. In the letter, 'Lady Goldenfleece' tells Beveril that she is already disappointed in her marriage because the 'Gallant Gentleman' has forsaken her bed without cause. She begs Beveril to come to her chamber to counsel her. Delighted, Beveril exits, on his way to Lady Goldenfleece's chamber. Sir Oliver Twilight, Lady Twilight, Master Sunset, Grace, Philip, Sandfield, Jane, the Dutch Merchant and Savourwit enter. The 'Gallant Gentleman' tells them that he has heard strange noises coming from Lady Goldenfleece's bedroom and suspects that she is cheating on him on the night of their wedding. The door to Lady Goldenfleece's chamber is forced open. Lady Goldenfleece is discovered inside with Beveril. Feigning rage, the 'Gallant Gentleman' swears that he will never admit Lady Goldenfleece to his bed for as long as he lives, banishes her from the house and claims all of her wealth as his own. Following pleas for leniency from Sir Oliver, the 'Gallant Gentleman' eventually agrees to leave with a casket containing half of all Lady Goldenfleece's wealth. As he prepares to leave, the 'Gallant Gentleman' says that, if 'he' wanted to, 'he' could release Lady Goldenfleece from her marriage contract with a few words, thus leaving her free to remarry. Everyone present wonders how this could be possible. Lady Goldenfleece begs the 'Gallant Gentleman' to tell her how she can regain her freedom. The 'Gallant Gentleman' says 'he' will only tell her if she promises to remarry immediately. Lady Goldenfleece promises. The 'Gallant Gentleman' reveals that Goldenfleece's marriage contract is void because 'he' is already married! Lady Goldenfleece is shocked. In order to honor her promise to remarry immediately, and to spite the 'Gallant Gentleman', she announces that her next husband will be Beveril. The 'Gallant Gentleman' feigns torment. Sir Gilbert, Sir Oliver and Beveril note that the 'Gallant Gentleman's' days are numbered; the punishment for having two wives is hanging. The 'Gallant Gentleman' says that, although 'he' is already married, 'he' does not have two wives. To provide the solution to this riddle, 'he' reveals 'his' true identity as Mistress Low-water. Sir Oliver decides that it is now time to draw up the marriage contracts for Sandfield & Grace and Philip & Jane. Lady Goldenfleece protests that Jane cannot marry Philip because she is, in fact, his sister! While everyone wonders what is going on, Lady Goldenfleece explains that Lady Sunset switched the girls when they were infants because she was worried that her husband would go bankrupt. Philip is overjoyed: the woman he is married to is Sunset's daughter, and not a relation of his. Sandfield is also overjoyed: he gets to marry Jane, the woman he really wanted to marry all along. Epilogue Weatherwise ends the play with an epilogue filled with characteristic references to almanacs and the phases of the moon. Consulting his almanac, he predicts that the play will end with great applause. Notes References * Chambers, E. K.

A sequel to the 1977 Tony Award-winning hit Annie, based on Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie comic strip, it begins immediately after Annie ends. Plot On Christmas morning in 1933, when Child Welfare Commissioner Harriet Doyle (replacing the original's Miss Hannigan as the villain of the piece) arrives on the scene to inform Daddy Warbucks he must marry within sixty days or else the child will be returned to the orphanage. Daddy Warbucks' whirlwind search for a fitting bride uncovers not only a plot by Doyle and her daughter Sheila Kelly to strip him of his fortune, but also his true feelings for his long-time assistant, Grace Farrell. A gaggle of cute little girls seeking parents and President Franklin D. Roosevelt return to take part in the shenanigans. Background Annie Warbucks was the second attempt at an Annie sequel. The first, entitled Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge, opened on December 22, 1989, at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., to universally dismal reviews.

Her face is that of the littlest angel; her resilience that of a dead-end kid. If no one else in the cast of \\"Annie Warbucks\\" lifted a finger, Miss Zaremba would still carry the show over the finish line on her tiny shoulders of steel....Happily, the evidence of busy fingers is everywhere. Charles Strouse's score—full of peppy melodies and bright banjo rhythms—is one of the composer's best....There are plenty of laughs in the book by Thomas Meehan and the lyrics by Martin Charnin, who also functions as the remarkably clear-eyed director....

Rabbi Avira interpreted the biblical passage :And the child was weaned, and Abraham made a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned (Genesis 21:8) as alluding to this feast. According to Rav Avira, at the Birkat HaMazon (Grace after Meals) following this feast, the Cup of Blessing will be passed from Abraham to Isaac to Jacob to Moses to Joshua, each of whom will cite some sin or imperfection and claim unworthiness to lead the blessing. The cup will then pass to King David, who will take it and lead the Birkat HaMazon. The Rabbis cite the verse \\"I shall raise the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord\\" (Psalms 16:13) as support. This section of the Talmud does not report what King David will say. Belief in bodily resurrection is a tenet of Orthodox Judaism. According to Midrash, three mythical beasts mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, the bird Ziz, the animal Behemoth, and the sea-creature Leviathan will be served at the feast. Some Modern Orthodox Jews have revived a millennium-old custom of adding a piece of fish to the Passover Seder plate, with the lamb, egg and fish jointly symbolizing the three prophets (Moses, Aharon, and Miriam) referred to in Micah 6:4, as well as the three mythical beasts associated with the Seudat Chiyat HaMatim, which the Passover Seder, and the Cup of Elijah allude to. The added fish represents Leviathan as well as Miriam and is also a water symbol. An egg and shankbone (for Moses/Ziz/air and Aharon/Behemoth/earth) are already on the standard Seder plate. The contemporary revival of this existing traditional custom, which honors a female figure in a highly traditional context, is favored by some Orthodox Jewish Feminists as preferable to developing new customs honoring Miriam or other female leaders. A belief in a bodily resurrection of the dead, one of Maimonides Thirteen Principles of Faith, is a normative belief of Orthodox Judaism and a traditional belief of Conservative Judaism. However, Aggadic and Midrashic elements of the Talmud are often interpreted as representing allegorical symbolism within Orthodox Judaism (and generally so in more liberal branches).

It is intended to be an intuitive graphical representation of the movement of a record whilst performing with a turntable, and was originally documented in a booklet form for distribution. The system has achieved acclaim from a number of recognizable turntablists, and is becoming increasingly accepted as a valuable method for transcribing turntablist music. However, it has not yet seen many compositions released in written format as is the project's intention: only the future will reveal the eventual extent of its usage for this purpose. Lesser-used systems of turntable notation have been devised by other Turntablists, and whilst they are less commonly available and/or used, they deserve a mention. One example of an alternative system is that developed by composer Raúl Yañez for DJ Radar, which was used to transcribe his Concerto For Turntable and uses traditional musical staves and notes to record the scratches. This system is limited in comparison to TTM, however, as it does not give such clear directions over the many aspects of scratching, such as velocity, direction, and crabbing. The TTM musical notation system has aided in the communication and collaboration among DJs, turntablists, musicians and producers. It has been recognized as the industry standard of musical notation for turntablists worldwide. The TTM system is used by renowned DJ instructors at Electronic Music Collective, Scratch DJ Academy, School of Scratch, The Beat Junkies Institute of Sound, and Q-bert’s Skratch University.  TTM origins  While documenting the X-ecutioners first studio recording X-pressions, John Carluccio created the notation system in 1997 and started testing his rough concept with DJ Rob Swift and turntablists. In 1998 he partnered with industrial designer Ethan Imboden to create a TTM booklet, and by 2000, with additional aid from DJ Rae Dawn (Raymond Pirtle), a full detailed booklet was distributed at The Battle Sounds Turntablist Festival #4 at New City’s Symphony Space on February 5, 2000. The TTM booklet has been downloaded, shared, and translated versions in Italian, French, Spanish have been created by turntablist enthusiasts. In 2001, John Carluccio was named by Time Magazine as one of the next 100 Innovators in music for TTM. In 2004, Scratch Magazine (issues #1- #6) featured TTM notations in a reoccurring column that explained iconic hip-hop scratch patterns.

She has written several books on the Three Stooges and appeared in a few films. In the 1980s, Maurer helped to raise funds for a cancer center dedicated to her father at the City of Hope National Medical Center by providing his autographs as incentives for donors to the facility in Duarte, California. After she discovered about 4,000 canceled checks that had been signed by Howard, she offered to give one of the checks to each donor who gave $10 or more to the center. She was married to cartoonist/director Norman Maurer, who wrote, produced, and directed many Stooges films, for 39 years until his death in 1986.

The team won the first four Lithuania Hockey League championships, while being undefeated in their first four seasons. Energija joined the new Eastern European Hockey League for the 1995–96 season, and struggled mightily, winning only 6 of their 28 games in their first season. They never did particularly well in the EEHL, their best finish being second in the B Group in 2002-03. In addition to the EEHL, they were given an automatic spot in the final in the Lithuanian Hockey League, winning the title in 1996, 1997, 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003. Energija dropped out of the EEHL after the 2002-03 season, one year before the league folded. They joined the Latvian Hockey League for the 2003-04 season, and finished with a respectable 10-9-3 record, and lost in the playoff semifinals. Energija had never advanced past the quarterfinals since then, and finished with a 1-41 record in the 2007-08 season. Energija continued to dominate the Lithuanian League, winning it in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2011.

He appears in Chronicon Lethrense and in Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum (book 3). The Chronicon Lethrense (and the included Annales Lundenses) tell that the Danish king Rorik Slengeborre put Horwendill and Feng as his rulers in Jutland, and gave his daughter to Horwendill as a reward for his good services. Horwendill and the daughter had the son Amblothe (Hamlet). The jealous Feng killed Horwendill and took his wife. Amblothe understood that his life was in danger and tried to survive by faking insanity. Feng sent Amblothe to the king of Britain with two servants carrying a message that the British king should kill Amblothe. While the servants slept, Amblothe carved off the (probably runic) message and wrote that the servants should be killed and himself married to the king's daughter. The British king did what the message said. Exactly one year later, Feng drank to Amblothe's memory, but Amblothe appeared and killed him. According to Saxo, Feng and Horwendill were the sons of Jutland's ruler Gervendill, and succeeded him as the rulers of Jutland. Rørik Slyngebond, king of Denmark, gave his daughter to Horwendill and she bore him the son Amleth. But Feng, out of jealousy, murdered Horwendill, and persuaded Gerutha to become his wife, on the plea that he had committed the crime for no other reason than to avenge her of a husband by whom she had been hated. Amleth, afraid of sharing his father's fate, pretended to be imbecile, but the suspicion of Feng put him to various tests which are related in detail. Among other things they sought to entangle him with a young girl, his foster-sister, but his cunning saved him. When, however, Amleth slew the eavesdropper hidden, like Polonius, in his mother's room, and destroyed all trace of the deed, Feng was assured that the young man's madness was feigned. Accordingly, he dispatched him to England in company with two attendants, who bore a letter enjoining the king of the country to put him to death. Amleth surmised the purport of their instructions, and secretly altered the message on their wooden tablets to the effect that the king should put the attendants to death and give Amleth his daughter in marriage. After marrying the princess Amleth returned at the end of a year to Denmark. Of the wealth he had accumulated he took with him only certain hollow sticks filled with gold. He arrived in time for a funeral feast, held to celebrate his supposed death. During the feast he plied the courtiers with wine, and executed his vengeance during their drunken sleep by fastening down over them the woolen hangings of the hall with pegs he had sharpened during his feigned madness, and then setting fire to the palace. He then killed Feng with his own sword. As can be seen, many plot elements of Shakespeare's Hamlet are present in this account. However, they are placed in Jutland - the diametrical opposite side of Denmark from Elsinore, which had become identified with Hamlet due to the Shakespearean account.

The film features a change of pace for comic actor Petchtai, who offers a sombre, dramatic portrayal of a taxicab driver who develops a relationship with a young woman (Woranut, in her debut feature film role) who is working in a massage parlor. The film has dream sequences that place the characters in scenes that might have come from a classic Thai melodrama film of the 1960s or 70s, with a dubbed soundtrack, which was a common method of filmmaking in the era. Plot Sombat is a taxicab driver in Bangkok. A loner, only seeks companionship through the melodramatic soap operas and old-time Thai pop ballads on his favorite AM radio station. He's picky about the fares he takes, and those passengers he does pick up invariably complain about the \\"Golden Oldies\\" radio show he's listening to. For those few co-workers that actually notice him, he's a source of amusement, a luddite who doesn't even own a mobile phone. He follows a routine that has him driving the cab by night and sleeping by day in his small apartment. He eats at the same food stall and orders the same meal each day. Sometimes he'll visit a ballroom where big band music is played and there is dancing, but he always sits by himself and sips a Coke. He also writes letters to his radio station, hoping one night he'll hear his letter read on air. For part of his evenings at work, he parks his cab in a queue outside a massage parlor. One night he picks up four \\"masseuses\\" as they are getting off work. Three of them tease him for listening to the old radio station, but the fourth, Nual, sits quietly, which catches Sombat's attention. The next night, Nual rides with Sombat again. She becomes a regular fare and the pair begin a friendship. The homely, middle-aged Sombat thinks he and the beautiful, young Nual are actually a lot alike. In one of his letters to the radio station, he writes about the relationship and points out that he takes people to their destinations, but he never gets anywhere himself. And Nual, in her job, takes men to their destinations, but never to where she needs to be. She's stuck there, working to send money home to her family in the rural provinces. Nual is being pushed by her pimp to become the mistress for a gangster, but Sombat remains a loyal friend and continues to ferry her home each night. The story starts to take a strange turn when Sombat is held by the police for questioning, and he misses his appointment pick-up time with Nual. Sombat has a dark past that he's never let on about, and he grows distant from Nual, which pushes her closer to the gangster. Cast * Petchtai Wongkamlao as Sombat * Woranut Wongsawan as Nual Festivals and awards The film has appeared several film festivals, including the 2005 Pusan International Film Festival, the World Film Festival of Bangkok and the 2006 Deauville Asian Film Festival (where it won the critic's prize) and Chicago International Film Festival. It was nominated (but did not win) in several categories for the Thailand National Film Awards, including best actor, best actress, best director, best screenplay and best picture. However, it did win awards from the Bangkok Critics Assembly, including best director, best actress and best script (tied with Dear Dakanda).

It is made out of Gynerium sagittatum known locally as caña flecha, a type of cane that grows in the region. The word vueltiao is a Colombian regionalism from the northern Caribbean Region and the area surrounding the Magdalena River basin that originate in the word for \\"turn\\" or \\"lap\\" (Spanish vuelta), and arose due to the way the hat is made. The quality of the hat is determined by the number of pairs of fibers braided together to make the hat, and its bending flexibility. The more flexible the hat is, the higher quality it is.\\"The Sombrero Vueltiao.\\" Proexport Colombia, Official travel guide of Colombia. The making of the hat originated amongst the Zenú tribes located in the Sinú river region, between the Córdoba and Sucre departments of Colombia. Under the denomination of ″Zenú breed″ there was three empires: Finzenú, Panzenú and Zenufana. Since the pre- Hispanic, the aborigines used the hat for sun protection during the corn crop, as evidence of an investigation in the Gold Museum in Bogotá and the Luigi Pigorini Museum in Rome. The hat probably formed part of the hierarchy ritual of the tribe and it had also powerful fertilization beliefs. The Colombian delegation to the 2004 Olympics wore the vueltiao during the opening ceremony. It is also traditionally worn by cumbia dancers and vallenato artists.  Making a sombrero vueltiao  Making a sombrero vueltiao is a lengthy process. First, the caña flecha leaves must be dried and the veins removed using a knife and a piece of leather to obtain uniform, sturdy strips. The strips are then dried in the sun until they turn from green to beige or white, and are sorted according to color. The beige, or \\"dirty strips\\" (Spanish:sucias) are then soaked in sand-free black mud. After about three or four days in the mud, the colored strips are washed thoroughly with cold water and boiled in vija, another wild plant, for at least a couple of hours. After this, the tinted strips are again dried in the sun for several days, and the coloring process is repeated until they have reached a uniform black color. After the desired colors are obtained, the caña flecha strips are woven into the braids that are used to form the sombrero. This can take many days, depending on the desired quality. The olma, or central part of the top of the hat, is the first part of the hat to be woven. The crown of the hat and later the wings are made. Once the manual part of constructing the hat is finished, the hat is completed by using a foot-driven sewing machine to sew the hat together.  Types of sombrero  The Quinciano is the most commercially available Sombrero Vueltiao and also the cheapest. These hats are made in just three days, are loosely woven together, and use only 15 pairs of caña flecha strips to make the weave. The Diecinueve, as the name suggests, uses 19 pairs of caña flecha strips to produce a finer braid that will result in a softer and finer sombrero. It can take up to a week to produce by hand. The Veintiuno uses 21 pairs of caña flecha strands per weave and is finer than the Quinciano and the Diecinueve. These hats are usually custom-made to order and take 10 to 15 days to produce by hand. The Veintitres is made of 23 pairs of caña flecha strips. The Veintitres, like the Veintiuno, is very fine and notably softer and lighter than the above. It takes from 12 to 20 days to make this sombrero from scratch. The Veintisiete is the finest sombrero available and uses 27 pairs of caña flecha. It can be folded up and put in a pocket without being damaged. The weave is very dense, and is soft to the touch. The Veintisiete is the most expensive sombrero vueltiao and can take up to a month to produce by hand.  National symbol of Colombia  The sombrero vueltiao is no longer just for Colombian peasants, as its popularity has sharply risen. The sombrero has also become a work of art admired and appreciated by the Colombians and foreigners alike. Most of these handmade hats are produced by entire Zenú families located in the Departments of Cordoba and Sucre. This iconic symbol of Colombia has been sported by hundreds of personalities, including Pope John Paul II when he visited Colombia in 1986, and former President of the United States Bill Clinton when he visited Cartagena, Colombia in August 2000.

Plot  Rafting down the Xiao River in Hunan, Pan Laowu (Li Wei) warns his fellow rafter Shi Gu (Hu Ronghua) not to take a wife, because \\"the wives of rafters are widows even while they live.\\" Pan tells the story of a woman he loved, Wu Aihua (Tao Yuling), whom he never returned to after his raft broke up and he fell into debt. The third rafter, Zhao Liang, is revealed to have a large family (a wife and seven daughters). We learn that Shi Gu is upset because his intended, Gaixiu, has been forced to marry the son of a political leader. During the night, Shi Gu leaves the raft after spotting a fire on shore. When Pan and Zhao find him, he has entered a labor camp and is nursing former district director Xu back to health. We learn that each of these men knew Xu before the cultural revolution as a good man, who worked and had fun with the people he led. They decide to take him with them, as he has obviously been sent to the camp to die. A short while later, they leave him with some hill folk, saying that they will return. The next day, they spot a woman on a hill above the river, and Shi Gu recognizes her as Gaixiu, his beloved. He carries her from the shore to the raft, and they hide her from two mean who are searching for her. She tells them that she has run away from her forced marriage, and Pan insists that she remain on the raft with them. They arrive in a town, which we recognize as the town where Pan and Wu Aihua fell in love 30 years ago. Pan and Zhao go into town to buy supplies, leaving Shi Gu and Gaixiu concealed on the raft. Pan tells Zhao about seeing Wu Aihua after he did not return to her—he explains that she, too, knew District Director Xu and has a husband and child. Zhao says he should have talked to her and Pan explains that knowing that she was happy was enough for him. They purchase ginseng root at a high price to cure Xu, and learn that all shops will soon be closing because everyone must attend a patriotic opera. Pan goes into a restaurant and orders two bowls of noodles, but Zhao says he doesn't want any and prefers to save his money. As Pan is finishing the first bowl, a beggar approaches and asks for a mouthful of soup. Looking up, he recognizes her as Wu Aihua. She initially sits down, but then tearfully takes the soup and runs out of the restaurant. Pan follows her to the water's edge, where she had promised to wait for him, and she explains that her husband and son are dead, and she has nothing. Pan gives her the rest of his money and she tells him that he is a good man, and he asks her to take the ginseng to Xu. Zhao approaches and they return to the raft and Wu Aihua leaves. Two party officials come to the raft and order them to attend the opera. When they begin to board the raft to see if anyone else is aboard, Pan calls for Shi Gu to come out to prevent them from searching the raft and finding Gaixiu. They notice that the police have arrested Wu Aihua, claiming she must have stolen the ginseng because she could not have afforded it, and the current Director confiscates it. After the opera, Zhao attacks him as he is walking along, but then runs away. Pan then knocks him down and takes the ginseng, and runs towards the raft. On the way, Wu Aihua accosts him and he surprises her with the ginseng, and tells her to go to Xu now. The police chase Pan to the raft, and the four of them push off and begin down the river, which has become swollen from rain. The raft has several narrow misses, but then as they approach a fallen tree Pan forces everyone else off the raft and attempts to steer around. We hear the cracking of timber and all goes dark. In the morning, Gaixiu, Shi Gu, and Zhao are on the beach amongst washed-up logs from the raft, calling for Pan. A narrative comes in explaining that Pan is nowhere to be found, but perhaps he is just around the next bend of the river.  Analysis  The \\"River Without Buoys\\" is a metaphor for the Chinese people after the Cultural Revolution—drifting aimlessly through life, with no higher purpose. The film itself is a criticism of the failure of the government to follow through on promises, and an existential meditation on what it means to live well in the absence of a guiding state. Wu Tianming has said that this movie could not be made today—in addition to the increased censorship in China following the Tiananmen incidents of 1989, all of the major films in China go to \\"two and a half directors.\\" He explains that while his film The King of Masks played for 11 weeks in the United States, the Chinese distributor decided that it would be released for only three days in theatres there.

He was elected President Pro Tem of the Alabama Senate from 1999 to 2007, and after having serving seven terms in the state Senate, was defeated by 628 votes in the 2010 general election by Republican Shadrack McGill.

Early life and education He was born in Jackson County, received his Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from Auburn University and, in 1965, opened a pharmacy in Fyffe. Career He was elected Mayor of Fyffe in 1968, a position he held until 1982, when he was first elected to the Alabama Senate. New elections for the state Senate and House were held in 1983 after district lines were redrawn, and the Alabama Democratic Party picked nominees rather than holding new primary elections. After his first year in the Senate, he was not selected as the Democratic nominee. Subsequently, he waged the state's first and only successful write-in campaign for the Alabama Legislature and won the Democratic nomination. He encouraged people to write in \\"Lowell Barron\\" with the \\"itty bitty pencils\\" which his campaign distributed, and his write-in campaign still stands as one of the most successful in American history. While the Senate district contained three counties (DeKalb, Jackson and parts of Madison), he received write-in votes in 26 of Alabama's 67 counties. He was elected by the full Senate as president pro tempore for two terms (1999–2007). In 1999, the Democratic-held legislature stripped much of the powers of the Republican Lieutenant Governor of Alabama, who was the presiding officer of the Alabama Senate. Senators changed the Senate rules to give those much of those powers it to the President Pro Tempore, which increased Barron's influence. Barron was reelected as President Pro Tem in 2003. After the 2006 elections, Barron did not run for Pro Tem but instead was appointed Chair of the powerful Senate Rules Committee. Democratic Senator Hinton Mitchem succeeded Barron as Pro Tem in 2007. Barron made national and international news in June 2007 when fellow Senator Charles Bishop, a Republican Senator and former Democratic Senate Rules Chairman in the 1980s, hit Barron while on the Senate floor. According to the Birmingham News Bishop accused Barron of using profanity after Bishop (R-Jasper) confronted Barron on floor of the Senate. Barron was working on a Senate Rules Committee report when Bishop became angered because, in a procedural move, he had lost his turn to debate the issue pending before the Senate when Senator Pat Lindsey (D-Butler) was presiding. Bishop punched Barron in the face, and fellow Senators, including Parker Griffith (D-Huntsville), Bobby Denton (D-Muscle Shoals) and others, saw the attack and restrained Bishop.Johnson, Bob. \\"Ala. lawmaker punches Senate colleague.\\" Associated Press. 7 June 2007.

The park is home to massive hemlock trees that are over 500 years old and are among the largest trees in all of Pennsylvania. The park also features a gorge with three waterfalls on Fall Brook. Salt Springs State Park is north of Montrose, just off Pennsylvania Route 29. The park is the only state park in Pennsylvania that is managed by a non-profit organization, the Friends of Salt Springs Park. The state owns of land and the Friends own an additional bringing the total amount of protected land to . History =Hemlocks= The first settlers came to the Salt Springs area in the 1790s, and found an area of unbroken forest that was dominated by the eastern hemlock tree. The settlers focused on clearing the land for farming. Many of the trees were simply burned, while others were used to build log cabins. Eventually the settlers began stripping the hemlocks of their bark for use in tanneries, while other trees were harvested for the lumber industry. Sawmills soon appeared on Silver Creek and other streams in the area. However, not all the old hemlocks were harvested. Those still standing in and about Fall Brook Gorge were left because the area had become a recreation destination as soon as the early 19th century. =Salty Springs= Salt Springs State Park is named for the salt springs found on the south side of Fall Brook. The Native Americans of the area used the springs as a salt supply for many years. The settlers also extracted salt from the waters of Salt Spring. Numerous entrepreneurs attempted to extract salt from the springs for a profit, but most failed because it simply was not possible to extract enough salt. =Oil prospecting= Oil prospectors were the next group to try to make a living from the Salt Springs area. Pennsylvania was in the midst of an oil boom in the late 19th century after oil had been discovered near Titusville, 280 miles to the west. The North Penn Oil and Gas Company sunk a test well in 1902. They quickly failed, plugged the well and left the area. Methane gas escaped from the well and was used by the Wheaton family, owners of a nearby dairy farm. They used this gas, released by the oil prospectors, for many years to provide lighting for their home and gas for their stove. =From farm to state park= The non-profit organization, \\"Friends of Salt Springs Park\\", was established in 1994 to help protect and preserve the park. Pennsylvania had acquired the land in 1973, but had been financially unable to preserve the historic buildings or develop the parks lands. When the historic buildings on the former Wheaton Farm were slated to be demolished, a group of concerned citizens teamed together to preserve the farm buildings and develop the park. They signed a 10-year contract with Susquehanna County to become the caretakers of the park in 1995. The contract was renewed in 2005, 2010, and 2012. A stand of hemlocks along Hemlock Trail at Salt Springs State Park The Wheaton family owned the lands of Salt Springs State Park from 1840 until 1973, when they sold their land to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The family established a dairy farm on the land and invited tourists to enjoy the towering hemlocks and Fall Brook Gorge. The buildings of the Wheaton farm are used today by the park for numerous purposes. Wheaton House, a timber framed post and beam structure crafted from eastern hemlock, holds the offices of \\"The Friends of Salt Springs Park\\". A second farm house provides rental income to help support the Friends' work. A carriage barn next to the Wheaton House is built entirely of hemlock timbers with hand hewn beams and sawed posts. It also has a foundation of native stone, built without mortar. It and the dairy barn provide space for programs, historical displays, and events. Recreation All of the park is open to hunting, except for the 30 acres designated as a nature preserve in the Fall Brook Gorge area. Hunters are expected to follow the rules and regulations of the Pennsylvania Game Commission. The common game species are ruffed grouse, squirrels, turkey, and white-tailed deer. The hunting of groundhogs is prohibited. Fall Brook and Silver Creek are designated trout fisheries by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, which stocks the streams with trout prior to the spring trout season. Salt Springs State Park has 12 sites for rustic tent camping and 3 cottages that are available for rent on a weekly or nightly basis. There is a small picnic area between Silver Creek and Fall Brook with tables and grills. There also is a large timber frame pavilion near Salt Spring. This pavilion is a former barn. In 2014, a second pavilion was constructed in a nearby meadow. =Trails= Salt Springs State Park has 15.65 miles of trails that are open to hiking and cross-country skiing. These trails pass through old-growth forest, overlook the gorge, and wind their way through fields and woods. :Fall Brook Trail - is a 1 mile difficult trail that is marked with red blazes. The trail begins across the creek from Wheaton House and follows Fall Brook up a steep hill and passes three waterfalls. Fall Brook Trail ends at Bunny Trail. :Silver Creek Trail is a 1-1/2 mile easy trail that is marked with red blazes. It begins behind a dairy barn and follows Silver Creek through a forest of hemlocks with a fern understory. The trail ends with a steep climb through a hardwood forest near Meadow Trail. :Meadow Trail is a easy trail that is marked with yellow blazes. It is reached from the Silver Creek Trail or Buckley Road. Meadow Trail is a loop that passes through meadows and by relict stone foundations. :Hemlock Trail is a moderate trail that is not marked. The trail passes through an old-growth forest of eastern hemlock and reaches Salt Springs gorge. A gorge observation platform is accessed from Hemlock Trail. Another view of some hemlocks along Hemlock Trail :Woodland Trail is a easy trail that is marked with blue blazes. It loops off Hemlock Trail through the old growth forest. Hikers will need to climb over or go around a 300-year-old hemlock that has fallen across the trail. :Hardwood Trail is a moderate trail that is marked with yellow blazes. The trail begins at the picnic area and ends at Woodland Trail. It passes through a stand of mixed hardwoods. :Upland Trail is a moderate trail that is marked with red blazes. It loops off Hardwood Trail and climbs a hillside that his covered with mixed hardwoods. :Bunny Trail is a moderate trail that is marked with orange blazes. It is a loop that begins and ends at a parking lot that is off Buckley Road. The trail passes through a mixed forest and by several springs. :Cliff Trail is a moderate trail that is marked with blue blazes. It closely follows Bunny Trail in some places. Cliff Trail passes by ferns, a pond and large boulders. :Connector Trail is a easy trail that is marked with white blazes. It connects Wetland Trail and Fall Brook Trail. The trail goes through a ravine and crosses the Wetland Trail bridge. :Wetland Trail is a easy trail that is marked with blue blazes. It runs along the south bank of Fall Brook and passes through a wetland. :Summit Trail is a moderate trail that is marked with red blazes. It climbs a gentle rise on the Friends of Salt Springs State Park property. The summit is relatively flat and is covered with a mix of widely spaced trees. :Overlook Trail is the shortest trail in Salt Springs State Park at just . It was designed with handicapped accessibility in mind. It connects the falls overlook with a parking lot and Fall Brook Trail. :Friends Trail is a moderate trail marked with white blazes. It is accessed from either the Hardwood Trail, with which it connects, or from the parking lot on Buckley Road. From Hardwood Trail, it meanders south, crosses Buckley Road, and continues through a meadow, into woodlands, along an old logging trail, and through re-growth forest before connecting to Summit Trail. :Gorge Trail is a moderate trail marked with blue blazes. It runs between Buckley Road and Salt Springs Road, along the west rim of the Fall Brook gorge. From Salt Springs Road, after a short, but rigorous ascent, it levels out and meanders a bit between the top of the gorge and an outcropping of shale (which the Wheatons \\"mined\\" for their own use). :Border Trail is a moderate to difficult trail marked with blue blazes. It begins behind the dairy barn, following Silver Creek Trail into the woods. When Silver Creek branches off to the left, the Border Trail continues straight until it reaches the western park border. Then it bears right and continues north, eventually curving right again and returning to Silver Creek Trail.

She is portrayed by Eliza Dushku.  Childhood  At the age of only 12 years old, Tru witnessed the murder of her mother, Elise Davies. Later in the series, it is revealed that Carl Neesan (Wade Andrew Williams), the hitman who killed her was hired by Tru's father, Richard. After her mother's demise, Tru, her younger brother Harrison and older sister Meredith were abandoned by their father and little has been revealed about who raised them from that point on.  Supernatural power  Tru possesses the power to relive the current day when a corpse asks for her help to turn back the clock in order to save his/her Life, or help someone whom the corpse affected in some way. Mostly triumphant, Tru has on occasion been unsuccessful in saving lives, sometimes because of the interference of Jack Harper and sometimes because the corpse was not meant to live. On some occasions her power changed. An instance of this was when a group of five corpses all asked for her help at the same time. Other times her day rewound more than once on an already rewound day, as in \\"The Longest Day\\" and \\"Grace\\". In \\"The Last Good Day\\", when a dead woman asked Jack Harper for help, Tru finally discovered what Jack saw when a corpse would ask her for help. She described this as a Dark Feeling which she would never want to experience again.  Good vs. Evil  Although both can relive days, it has never been said who is evil, Tru or Jack. Jack has always been portrayed as evil, which Jack denies, although at certain times Jack has broken the rules of preserving fate, such as to make Luc die to teach Tru a lesson. While Tru claims that she is saving people who were taken before their time, Jack claims that he is merely preserving fate, and that if Tru saves someone who is meant to die, she creates a ripple effect in fate.  Romantic relationships  *Mark Evans - Tru's college Professor. After Tru spotted Mark cheating on her with another one of his students, she ended the relationship. When Tru had a party, Mark visited, only to be killed by one of Tru's friends. Tru then saved his life after he asked her for help and have a proper closure of their relationship. *Nick Kelly - A fireman that was killed in a fire but then asked Tru for help. He was killed again in the same fire on his and Tru's first day together, though he did save a little girl that died with him before when he asked Tru for help. *Luc Johnston - Luc is the crime scene photographer that works with Tru. Tru and Luc started dating and fell in love. However, Luc always questioned why Tru would always take off at a moments notice, and he broke up with her, as he felt she was hiding something from him. After Tru finally revealed the truth to him, he refused to believe it. Jack then tricked him into going to a house looking for someone who would \\"provide clearer answers\\". Luc was instead shot and killed by an insanely jealous husband, who mistook Luc for his wife's supposed lover. *Jensen Ritchie - Tru's college mate in med school, who was in a serious relationship when they first met. After he breaks up with his girlfriend, him and Tru spend a day together and end up kissing outside her apartment. Then he was killed in a robbery of an antique store where he was buying an old medic case for Tru. When he is brought to the morgue, he never asks for help, but later in the day a different man who was killed asks for Tru's help. On the second day, Tru saves Jensen from being hit by a car driven by the very same victim she had to save that day. Though, Davis and Jack warn her that there is a reason that Jensen did not ask for help. That it is his fate to die in the robbery, and her changing fate will have consequences. We never get to learn those consequences, since the show is cancelled abruptly. According to the writers of the show; because of his near death experience, he starts to become fascinated by death, which leads to him becoming a serial killer.

These factors can include job availability, wages, the prices and/or availability of goods and services, and the amount of capital investment funding available to minorities for business. This can include discrimination against workers, consumers, and minority-owned businesses. It is not the same as price discrimination, the practice by which monopolists (and to a lesser extent oligopolists and monopolistic competitors) charge different buyers different prices based on their willingness to pay. History A recognition of economic discrimination began in the British Railway Clauses Consolidation Act of 1845, which prohibited a common carrier from charging one person more for carrying freight than was charged to another customer for the same service. In nineteenth-century English and American common law, discrimination was characterized as improper distinctions in economic transactions; in addition to the above issue in the British Railway Clauses, a hotelier capriciously refusing to give rooms to a particular patron would constitute economic discrimination. These early laws were designed to protect against discrimination from Protestants who might discriminate against Catholics, or Christians who might discriminate against Jews. By the early twentieth century, economic discrimination was broadened to include biased or unequal terms against other companies or competing companies. In the United States the Robinson-Patman Act (1936), which prevents sellers of commodities in interstate commerce from discriminating in price between purchasers of goods of like grade and quality, was designed to prevent vertically integrated trusts from driving smaller competitors out of the market through economies of scale. It was not until 1941, when U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order forbidding discrimination in employment by a company working under a government defense contract, that economic discrimination took on the overtones it has today, which is discrimination against minorities. By 1960, anti-trust laws and interstate commerce laws had effectively regulated inter-corporate discrimination so problematic in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but the problem of discrimination on an economic basis against minorities had become widespread. Causes There is a wide range of theory concerned with the root causes of economic discrimination. Economic discrimination is unique from most other kinds of discrimination because only a small portion of it is due to racism, but rather is due to what has been called a \\"cynical realization that minorities are not always your best customers\\". There are three main causes that most economic theorists agree are likely root causes. =Animosity= Racism, sexism, ageism, and dislike for another's religion, ethnicity or nationality have always been components of economic discrimination, much like all other forms of discrimination. Most discrimination in the US and Europe is claimed to be in terms of racial and ethnic discrimination—mostly blacks and Hispanics in the USA, Muslims in Europe. In most parts of the world, women are held to lower positions, lower pay, and restricted opportunities of land ownership or economic incentive to enter businesses or start them.Donohue, J. J. III, & Siegelman, P. (1991). The changing nature of employment discrimination litigation. Stanford Law Review, 43, 983-1033. This form of economic discrimination is usually performed by whatever groups are held to be \\"in power\\" at the time. For example, in America, discrimination is often considered to be the province of Caucasians, while in Saudi Arabia, it's men who are considered discriminatory. One study suggests that the increase in equal opportunity lawsuits has reduced this kind of discrimination in America by a large amount.Donohue, J. J. III, & Siegelman. P. (1993). Law and macroeconomics: Employment discrimination litigation over the business cycle. Southern California Law Review, 66, 709-765. =Cost/revenue= There is a certain opportunity cost in dealing with some minorities, particularly in highly divided nations or nations where discrimination is tolerated. A second common reason for this kind of discrimination is when the worker or consumer is not cost-efficient. For example, some stores in the US Northwest do not stock ethnic foods, despite requests for such, since they feel the cost is too high for too low a return. Additionally, the illegal immigration debate in the US has resulted in some businesses refusing to hire such workers based on the likelihood that they would be fined and litigated against. =Efficiency= In some cases, minorities are discriminated against simply because it is inefficient to make a concerted effort at a fair allocation. For example, in countries where minorities make up a very small part of the population, or are on average less educated than the population average, there is rarely an attempt to focus on employment of minorities. The Equal Opportunity Employment act in the US has almost reduced this sort of rationale for discrimination to nothing, according to recent studies.Donohue, J. J. III, & Heckman, J. (1991). Continuous versus episodic change: The impact of civil rights policy on the economic status of blacks. Journal of Economic Literature, 29, 1603–1643. The relations between economic theory, efficiency and discrimination, or \\"discriminatory tastes\\"GARY S. BECKER, THE ECONOMICS OF DISCRIMINATION (Milton Friedman ed., 2nd ed. 1971). are much more problematic.Glen G. Cain, The Economic Analysis of Labor Market Discrimination: A Survey, in 1 HANDBOOK OF LABOR ECONOMICS 693, 774 (Orley Ashenfelter & Richard Layard eds., 1986). Forms There are several forms of economic discrimination. The most common form of discrimination is wage inequality, followed by unequal hiring practices. But there is also discrimination against minority consumers and minority businesses in a number of areas, and religious or ethnic discrimination in countries outside of the United States.A seminal microeconomic analysis of the subject is Gary Becker's book The Economics of Discrimination (1957, 1971, 2nd ed.). Chicago, University of Chicago Press, UCP descr =Against workers= Most forms of discrimination against minorities involve lower wages and unequal hiring practices.

Pp. 731-771 have shown that, in the United States, several minority groups, including black men and women, Hispanic men and women, white women, gay men of any race and trans people of any race suffer from decreased wage earning for the same job with the same performance levels and responsibilities as heterosexual white and Asian males. Numbers vary from study to study, but most indicate a gap from 5 to 15% lower earnings on average, between an affected minority and other groups. Studies by experts from Harvard University and the University of Chicago have shown that, at least for some career paths like those of MBA graduates, the pay gap for women is largely due to time taken off to care for children. Their work has shown that the earnings of male and female MBA graduates from top US business schools are nearly identical at the outset of their careers. However, a decade after completing their degree, male graduates begin to earn more than female graduates. Researchers found that three factors account for the gap in earnings: differences in training prior to MBA graduation, differences in career interruptions, and differences in weekly hours. Female graduates had less training outside of their formal MBA, were more likely to take time off to provide full time childcare, and worked fewer hours per week on average. However, these findings appear to be changing as more men are seeking out careers that allow for flexibility in child care and some female dominant fields, like obstetrics, are developing new ways to increase work-life balance. A recent study indicated that black wages in the US have fluctuated between 70% and 80% of white wages for the entire period from 1954–1999, and that wage increases for that period of time for blacks and white women increased at half the rate of that of white males. Other studies show similar patterns for Hispanics. Studies involving women found similar or even worse rates.Nelson, R. L., & Bridges, W. P. (1999). Legalizing gender inequality: Courts, markets, and unequal pay for women in the United States. New York: Cambridge University Press. Chapter 2 Another study indicated that Muslims earned almost 25% less on average than whites in France, Germany, and England, while in South America, mixed-race blacks earned half of what Hispanics did in Brazil.Arnsperger, Christian. Poverty and human rights: The issue of systemic economic discrimination and some concrete proposals for reform. International Social Science Journal 56 (180), 289-299. Most wage discrimination is masked by the fact that it tends to occur in lower-paying positions and involves minorities who may not feel empowered to file a discrimination lawsuit or complain. UK - On 10 October 2018 the Prime Minister, Theresa May, launched a three month consultation with businesses on how large businesses would have to report the pay gap between staff of different ethnicities Hiring discrimination Hiring discrimination is similar to wage discrimination in its pattern. It typically consists of employers choosing to hire a certain race candidate over a minority candidate, or a male candidate over a female candidate, to fill a position. A study of employment patterns in the US indicated that the number of hiring discrimination cases has increased fivefold in the past 20 years. However, their percentage as a whole fraction of the workforce hirings has decreased almost as drastically. With the stiff laws against discrimination in hiring, companies are very careful in who they hire and do not hire. Even so, studies have shown that it is easier for a white male to get a job than it is for an equally qualified man of color or woman of any race. Many positions are cycled, where a company fills a position with a worker and then lays them off and hires a new person, repeating until they find someone they feel is \\"suitable\\"—which is often not a minority. While hiring discrimination is the most highly visible aspect of economic discrimination, it is often the most uncommon. Increasingly strong measures against discrimination have made hiring discrimination much more difficult for employers to engage in. However this is only the case in formal hiring arrangements, with corporations or others subject to public scrutiny and overview. Private hiring, such as apprenticeships of electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and other trades is almost entirely broken down along racial lines, with almost no women in these fields and most minorities training those of their own race. =Against consumers= Most discrimination against consumers has been decreased due to stiffer laws against such practices, but still continues, both in the US and in Europe. The most common forms of such discrimination are price and service discrimination. Discrimination based on price Discrimination based on price is charging different prices for goods and services to different people based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or sex. It should not be confused with the separate economic concept of price discrimination. Discrimination based on price includes, but is not limited to: *increased costs for basic services (health care, repair, etc.) *increased costs for per diem charges (such as charging one person $40 while charging another person $100 for exactly the same service provided)Ayres, I. (1991). Fair driving: Gender and race discrimination in retail car negotiations. Harvard Law Review, 104, 817-872. *not offering deals, sales, rebates, etc. to minorities *higher rates for insurance for minorities Most charges of discrimination based on price are difficult to verify, without significant documentation. Studies indicate that less than 10% of all discrimination based on price is actually reported to any authority or regulatory body, and much of this is through class-action lawsuits. Furthermore, while a number of monitoring services and consumer interest groups take an interest in this form of discrimination, there is very little they can do to change it. Most discrimination based on price occurs in situations without a standardized price list that can be compared against. In the cases of per diem charges, this is easily concealed as few consumers can exchange estimates and work rates, and even if they do the business in question can claim that the services provided had different baseline costs, conditions, etc. Discrimination based on price in areas where special sales and deals simply are not offered can be justified by limiting them to those with strong credit ratings or those with past business with the company in question. Services discrimination Although price discrimination mentions services, service discrimination is when certain services are not offered at all to minorities, or are offered only inferior versions. According to at least one study,Ayres, I. (1993). Not on the menu: studies in consumer discrimination and recent law. Harvard Law Review, 122, 419-442. most consumer discrimination falls into this category, since it is more difficult to verify and prove. Some assertions of discrimination have included: *offering only high-cost plans for insurance or refusal to cover minorities *refusing to offer financing to minorities *denial of service =Against businesses= Minority owned businesses can also experience discrimination, both from suppliers and from banks and other sources of capital financing. In the US, there are tax benefits and even public relations benefits from having minority-owned businesses, so most instances of this occur outside of the United States.Posner, R. A. (1995). Economic analysis of law. Boston: Little, Brown and Company. Pp. 336-340 Women of color are starting businesses at rates three to five times faster than all other businesses, according to an article from Babson college on However, once in business, their growth lags behind all other firms, according to the results of a multi-year study conducted by the Center for Women's Business Research in partnership with Babson College exploring the impact of race and gender on the growth of businesses owned by women who are African-American, Asian, Latina and other ethnicities. Discrete usage discrimination This form of discrimination covers suppliers providing substandard goods to a business, or price gouging the business on purchases and resupply orders. Capital investment discrimination A more significant source of perceived discrimination is in capital investment markets. Banks are often accused of not providing loans and other financial instruments for inner-city minority owned businesses. Most research indicates that the banking industry as a whole is systemic in its abuse of the legal system in avoidance of \\"high risk\\" loans to minorities, pointing out that banks cannot provide facts backing up their assertions that they deny such loans to a high failure rate.Siegelman, P. (1994). Shaky grounds: The case against the case against anti-discrimination laws. Law and Social Inquiry, 19, 725-751. On the other hand, most financial institutions and some economists feel that all too often, banks are accused unfairly of discrimination against minority owned businesses when said business is simply not worth such a credit risk, and that no one would find such a decision discriminatory if the business were not minority owned. These charges of reverse racism or prejudicial analysis are a longstanding source of controversy in the study of economic discrimination.Donohue, J. J. III. (1992). Advocacy of economic instruments versus analysis in favor of 'fair- use' financing in discrimination law. Stanford Law Review, 41, 1235. Pp. 153-214 Global economic discrimination An increasing number of economists and international commerce theorists have suggested that economic discrimination goes far beyond the bounds of individuals or businesses. The largest scale forms of economic discrimination, and the widest ranging, affect entire nations or global regions. Many consider that an open world economic system (globalization), which includes world bodies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, and International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), places countries at risk by practicing explicitly discriminatory techniques such as bilateral and regional bargaining, as well as asymmetrical trade balances and the maintaining of cheap force labor. Trade policies like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) are often regarded as financial measures serving to economically oppress third world nations.Kenneth A. Oye. Economic Discrimination and Political Exchange:World Political Economy.

It portrays a rugged Western frontier cowboy character fighting to stay aboard a rearing, plunging bronco, with a stirrup swinging free, a quirt in one hand and a fistful of mane and reins in the other. It was the first and remains the most popular of all of Remington's sculptures. The sculpture was executed in the summer of 1895, and later that fall it was copyrighted with the United States Copyright Office. He took his subject from a number of his former sketches. The earliest one was A Bucking Bronco, an illustration to Theodore Roosevelt's article in the March 1888 issue of Century Magazine entitled \\"The Home Ranch\\". Another Remington sketch entitled A Pitching Bronco, was published in the April 30, 1892, issue of Harper's Weekly. Sculpting was a new medium for Remington at this time, and this new method of portrayal was a total success in the eyes of his collectors and art historians. Breaking away from the restricted limits of flat paper, pen and ink and watercolor, Remington moved to the next level of his artistic potential, through the more effective medium of three-dimensional expressions. Remington, who always strove to capture the essence of the moment in his work, now found he was more able to effectively express that which he had observed first hand: With this in mind, he decided to sculpt a bucking bronco for his first piece. Using techniques from his previous works to help focus the subject's figure, Remington removed the figure from its context and isolated it into a grounded free-floating form, thus achieving a lifelike quality and vigorous movement. The artist's reference file for the sculpture included a photograph of a cowboy that very closely resembled his 1892 illustration of A Bucking Bronco. The Bronco Buster followed the same kind of process liberating horse and man from two- dimensionality as before. On September 13, 1898 at Camp Wickoff at Montauk Point, New York, the Rough Riders gave Theodore Roosevelt a casting of The Bronco Buster. Of the gift Remington said it was \\"the greatest compliment I ever had...After this everything will be mere fuss.\\" Roosevelt responded, \\"There could have been no more appropriate gift from such a regiment.\\" The cast which Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders gave him is now at the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, Oyster Bay, New York. An original cast resides in the Oval Office, a gift of Miss Virginia Hatfield and Mrs. Louis Hatfield Stickney during the Carter Administration. Another original Remington sculpture, The Cowboy, 1907, is located along Kelly Drive (formerly known as East River Drive) in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia. It is Remington's only commissioned sculpture and only monument, and a different sculpture from The Bronco Buster.  In popular culture  In 2014, the Denver Art Museum made a bet with the Seattle Art Museum over the outcome of Super Bowl XLVIII, wherein the losing city's museum would temporarily loan the other a work of art. Denver put up a cast of Bronco Buster against Seattle's Sound of Waves, a 1901 Japanese screen by artist Tsuji Kako.Denver, Seattle museums put artworks on the line in Super Bowl wager, via LAtimes.com As the Denver Broncos lost to the Seattle Seahawks, the bronze was shipped to Seattle where it was scheduled to be on display for three months.

It is the first religious parliament in the world whose literal meaning is \\"experience pavilion\\", and was an academy of mystics, saints and philosophers of the lingayat faith in the 12th century. It was the fountainhead of all religious and philosophical thought pertaining to the lingayat. It was presided over by the mystic Allama Prabhu and numerous Sharanas from all over Karnataka and other parts of India were participants. This institution was also the fountainhead of the Vachana literature which was used as the vector to propagate Veerashaiva religious and philosophical thought. Other giants of veerashaiva theosophy like Akka Mahadevi, Channabasavanna and Basavanna himself were participants in the Anubhava Mantapa. The Anubhava Mantapa also called as the Mahaamane. History Anubhava Mantapa was an academy of mystics, saints and philosophers of the ‘Lingayath's’ faith in the 12th century. It was the fountainhead of all religious and philosophical thought pertaining to the Human Values, Ethics. It was presided over by the mystic Allama Prabhu and numerous Sharanas from all over Karnataka and other parts of India were participants. The Sharanas belonged all strata. Everybody (there was no discrimination - Men, Women, Dalits, Shudras, Brahmins, Vaishyas - all were one, and they were all classless) provided equal opportunities by the social reformer Basaveshwara and made them to depend on their own work, think rational and contribute back to society through \\"Daasoha\\". This institution was also the fountainhead of the Vachana literature which was used as the vector to propagate Sharana’s views and philosophical thought. Other Sharana’s and Sharanes theosophy like Akka Mahadevi, Channabasavanna were participants in the Anubhava Mantapa. It was a unique socio spiritual revolution to establish an egalitarian society. The Anubhava Mantapa worked to build a Vibrant casteless, creedless Society with full of Human Values propagated through Vachanas The movement taken over by Basava through Anubhava Mantapa became the basis of a sect of Human values. It gave rise to a system of ethics and education at once simple and exalted. It sought to inspire ideals of social and religious freedom, such as no previous faith of Earth had done. In the medieval age which was characterized by inter-communal jealousy, it helped to shed a ray of light and faith on the homes and hearts of people. But the spirit soon disappeared after the intermarriage that Basava facilitated came to an abrupt end when the couple were punished for the same by the King. The dream of the classless society was shaken and Basava soon realised the meek picture and left for Kudala Sangama and a year later died. The movement gave a literature of considerable value in the vernacular language of the country, the literature which attained the dignity of a classical tongue. Its aim was the elimination of the barriers of caste and to remove untouchability, raising the untouchable to the equal of the high born. The sanctity of family relations and the improvement in the status of womanhood were striven for while at the same time the importance of rites and rituals, of fasts and pilgrimages was reduced. It encouraged learning and contemplation of God by means of love and faith. The excesses of polytheism were deplored and the idea of monotheism was encouraged. The movement tended, in many ways, to raise the nation generally to a higher level of capacity both in thought and action. However, the sect failed to bring about a completely classless society.

Shatsthala is a conflation of Shat and Sthala which means 'six phases/states/levels' through which a person (a bhakta/seeker) advances in one's ultimate quest of realisation of the Supreme, or, simply put, enlightenment. (The word enlightenment used here refers to the Indian notion of enlightenment.) The Shatsthala comprises the Bhakta Sthala, Maheshwara Sthala, Prasadi Sthala, Pranalingi Sthala, Sharana Sthala and the Aikya Sthala. The Aikya Sthala is the culmination where the soul leaves the physical body and merges with the Supreme. While the origins of the Shatsthala may be traced to the Agamas, particularly the Parameshwaratantra, with the evolution of Veerashaivism Shatsthala seems to have received more attention. While Basava understood Shatsthala as a process with various stages to be attained in succession, the credit of refuting this and redefining Shatsthala goes to Channabasavanna, Basava's nephew. Channabasavanna differed radically from his uncle and held that a soul can reach its salvation in any stage. Brief Description of the Sthalas A brief description of the six sthala-s, according to the Lingayat tradition.. The 8th century work Siddhanta Shikhamani provides a detailed description of the shatshtala and what a bhakta should do in each of the sthala. It divides each of the six Sthalas further into several 'avaantara' or 'antara' ('ಅವಾಂತರ'/'ಅಂತರ' in Kannada) sthalas, which he calls 'Linga sthala' embedded or included in (\\"अन्तर्गत\\" in) each sthala. See for instance the openining lines of Chapter 17. 'Antara' means 'intermediate'. The list below contains both the sthalas and the associated antara/intermediate sthalas. Chapter 1 to 14 of the Siddhanta Shikhamani, an eighth century Sanskrit text, lists and describes 44 antara sthalas of the main shatsthalas. From chapter 15 onwards, the text gives a further list and descriptions of 57 antara sthalas related to the main sthalas. Thus, it describes a total of 101 sthalas. As a 16th century Kannada commentator on the text describes in his Suprabhodini Teeku, these second set of 57 antara sthalas pertain to someone who has already reached the aikya sthala and has become one with linga (lingaikya) , the ultimate stage in the shatsthala. 1\\\\. Bhakta: Bhaktasthala involves the worship of Guru, Linga and Jangama . When one understands the true meaning of this Sthala, one conceives the true meaning of the trinity of Guru, Linga and Jangama .

He succeeded his father as Grand Duke on 15 April 1883. From an early age Frederick Francis suffered from asthma and severe breathing difficulties.

He was succeeded by his son Frederick Francis IV, who would be the last Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

History  A home in Avalon, NJ showing GAF Asphalt Roofing Shingles. Founded in 1886, GAF has become one of the largest roofing manufacturers in North America, with sales approaching $3 billion. With more than two dozen manufacturing plants located throughout the United States, the company has over 3,000 employees and sells its roofing products worldwide. Originally American IG, began as the American holdings of the German IG Farben.  Timeline  1886 – Company founded as The Standard Paint Company 1892 – First ready-to-lay asphalt roofing is created, known as \\"Ruberoid\\" 1904 – Method perfected to embed colored granules in asphalt coating 1912 – Individually-cut asphalt shingles are introduced 1921 – Based on the success of its roofing line, Standard Paint changes its name to the Ruberoid Company 1928 - The American holdings of the German company I.G.Farben were organized into American I.G.; later renamed General Aniline & Film or GAF for short. 1933 – Interlocking shingles introduced 1941 - American assets seized as enemy property by the U.S. government. 1965 - The U.S. government sells shares of GAF. 1966 – General Aniline & Film acquires Sawyer's, manufacturer of photographic equipment 1967 – Ruberoid merges with General Aniline & Film and adopts the GAF name 1967 – \\"Timberline\\" architectural shingle introduced 1968 – General Aniline & Film Corp. formally changes its name to GAF Corporation. 1982 – Samuel J. Heyman took control of the company 1987 – Samuel J. Heyman took the company private; it continues to be owned by the Heyman family 2004 – Introduced first pre-coated energy-efficient modified bitumen membranes 2005 – Introduced first energy-efficient asphalt shingle 2007 – GAF acquires ElkCorp 2010 – Introduced solar grade single-ply TPO membranes 2011 – First company to offer lifetime limited warranty on all laminated shingles 2012 – First company to offer lifetime limited warranty on entire roofing system Bankruptcy On Jan. 7, 2001, GAF's principal shareholder became the 27th company in the United States to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code from liabilities relating to asbestos-related bodily injury claims. In what was an ill-fated acquisition, GAF's purchase of Ruberoid brought with it a product line that contained considerable quantities of asbestos. The asbestos-containing products ranged from roofing shingles and siding to insulation and numerous other construction-related products. Along with the purchase came ownership of an asbestos mine in Vermont. Once the sale was complete, GAF Corporation became the de facto leader in asbestos supplies in the state. The mine was shut down in 1975. GAF's roofing business (at the time, d/b/a GAF Materials Corporation) was not involved in the manufacture or sale of asbestos containing products and thus it did not have any liability related to these claims. GAF's shareholder emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 having discharged its asbestos-related bodily injury claims.

He was rabbi at Montpellier, and leader of the movement against Maimonides. Meiri quotes him and his associates using the title Hachmei HaHar. Conflict with Maimonides When Samuel ibn Tibbon's translation of The Guide for the Perplexed became known in Hachmei Provence, it was freely accepted by some, but others, who adhered firmly to the Talmud, regarded it askance and secretly condemned it. No one, however, dared to express open disapproval of the study of this book until Solomon threw down the gauntlet to the Maimonidists. It would be natural to infer from this proceeding, which divided Judaism into two hostile camps, that Solomon had had a philosophical training which enabled him to recognize the import of Maimonides' ideas, and the contradictions existing between the latter's conception of Judaism and that of the Talmud. Samuel David Luzzatto argued that Solomon, while a prominent Talmudic authority and of pious, upright character, took up the quarrel with the best intentions but was unable to comprehend Maimonides' views correctly, and had no idea of a philosophical conception of Judaism. He attacked Maimonides on minor, incidental points, e.g., for his refusal to take the aggadic opinions of the Talmud in their simple, often offensive, literal sense; for his explanation of many miracles by means of natural processes; for his description of paradise and hell in other than aggadic colors; and for his conception of the Godhead on other than anthropomorphic lines. As Heinrich Graetz remarked, Solomon, with his \\"childish views and his clumsy ideas\\", regarded nearly every word of Maimonides as un-Jewish and heretical. Solomon knew enough, however, to understand that single-handed he would be powerless to make headway against Maimonides' great authority, which prevailed even after his death, and against his numerous adherents. He therefore sought allies; but his demands for the interdiction of scientific studies found little support among the scholars of southern France, only two of his pupils, Yonah Gerondi (a relative of Nahmanides) and David ben Saul, joining him. These three pronounced (in the beginning of the year 1232) a sentence of excommunication on Maimonides' works, on those who studied them, and on those who construed the Scripture otherwise than literally and interpreted the Aggadah at variance with Rashi. Several rabbis of northern France subsequently confirmed this sentence. Reaction This proceeding aroused a storm of indignation among the followers of Maimonides. The communities of Occitania, which stood foremost in point of culture, now excommunicated Solomon and his two disciples and hastened to find allies. The controversy became more fierce, the adherents of both parties increasing and growing more bitter; and the discord threatened to spread throughout all Jewry. Many of the rabbis of northern France, frightened at the unexpected consequences, retired from the controversy; but Solomon decided upon a shameful and dangerous step. He went to the Dominican Order, and on a certain day in 1233 the citizens of Montpellier saw servants of the Catholic Church, filled with hatred of the Jews and incited by an overpious rabbi, publicly burn the works of the greatest rabbi of post-Talmudic times. The news of this event filled all the Jews with horror; and Solomon and his pupils were universally condemned, his follower al-Fakhkhar trying vainly to excuse him. But the matter did not rest there; Solomon, believing that he had gained nothing by destroying the works of Maimonides so long as his admirers were still in the field, denounced them to the authorities. It seems, however, that the Maimonidists, with the help of friends in favor at the court of King James I of Aragon, paid Solomon back in his own coin; for several of the calumniators in his party had their tongues cut out. The fate of Solomon himself is not known. Luzzatto infers from the epithet Qadosh applied to him that he also suffered this shameful mutilation.

Early years Hinton Mitchem was born on May 18, 1938 in Georgia to Neal Emory and Gertrude Helen Hinton. He received his Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Education from the University of Georgia in 1961. He also served in the U.S. Coast Guard. He moved from Georgia to Marshall County, Alabama in 1962. He was the owner of Hinton Mitchem Tractor Co., Inc. from 1965 until he sold it in 2005. Political service Mitchem first entered politics as a member of the Albertville, Alabama City Council in 1968. In 1974, he was elected unopposed in the general election as a member of the Alabama House of Representatives, representing the 25th District, serving a single four-year term from 1975 through 1979 before his election to the Senate. He ran without Republican opposition again in both his first race and in 1982 as well as the special 1983 race the entire legislature had to run in. In 1986, Mitchem stepped down from the Senate and ran in the primary for Lieutenant Governor. In a four- person field, he placed third behind fellow State Senator John Teague and eventual winner, Jim Folsom, Jr., placing just ahead of former State Treasurer Melba Till Allen. When Senate successor Loyd Coleman was forced from office upon a criminal conviction in April 1987, Mitchem jumped into the special election and won handily in the primary, and by a 2-to-1 margin over Republican Nell Burton Skidmore. He won unopposed again in 1990. With the growing strength of the Alabama Republicans, he faced opposition during his last terms in 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006, with a declining, but respectable, percentage of the vote. His closest race was his final one in 2006 where he prevailed by 7% over attorney Bill Ingram of Guntersville, Alabama. Mitchem was elected President Pro Tempore of the Senate on January 9, 2007 by a margin of 18–17 over the efforts of a coalition of Republicans and disaffected Democrats to elect leadership that would be more favorable to then-Gov. Bob Riley. He then resigned from the position on February 5, 2009 per a prior agreement to allow a vote on Rodger Smitherman to succeed him for the remaining two years of the session. As of 2010, Mitchem was serving in his 36th year in the Alabama Legislature, then the longest-serving member (with a 5-month gap of service in early 1987). He chose to retire in 2010 and was succeeded by Republican Clay Scofield. Personal life Mitchem was a Rotarian and enjoyed golf and traveling in his spare time. He had three children, Todd, Tanya, Dee and stepdaughter Brittnie Mabry, and five grandchildren. Later years In 1980, Mitchem was appointed by then-Governor Fob James, Jr. as Chairman of the Alabama Governor's Commission on Physical Fitness, serving in that capacity for 28 years. He also served 18 consecutive years as Chairman of the Alabama Special Olympics. He died on January 22, 2013.Former Sen. Hinton Mitchem dies at 74 , Montgomery Advertiser, January 22, 2013 He had Alzheimer's disease.

Kernal is a SCSI hard drive subsystem developed for the 8-bit Commodore 64 and Commodore 128 home computers. The Lt. Kernal is capable of a data transfer rate of more than per second and 65 kilobytes per second in Commodore 128 fast mode.  History  The original design of both the technically complicated hardware interface and disk operating system came from Lloyd Sponenburgh and Roy Southwick of Fiscal Information, Inc., a now-defunct Florida-based turnkey vendor of minicomputer-based medical information systems. Fiscal demonstrated a working prototype in 1984 and starting advertising the system for sale early in 1985. It immediately found a niche with some Commodore software developers and bulletin board SysOps. It was released over the years in capacities of 10 megabytes to 330 megabytes. The subsequent development of a multiplexing accessory allows one Lt. Kernal to be shared by up to 16 computers, using a round robin scheduling algorithm. This makes the use of the Lt. Kernal with multiple line BBSs practical. Later, streaming tape support, using QIC-02 tape cartridges, was added to provide a premium backup strategy. Fiscal built the units to order until late 1986, at which time the decision was made to turn over the production, marketing and customer support to Xetec Inc. Fiscal continued to provide secondary technical support, as well as free DOS upgrades, until December 1991, at which time production of new Lt. Kernal systems ceased. Following the shutdown of Xetec in 1995, private support of the Lt. Kernal was carried on for several years by Ron Fick until his untimely death in 1999.  Overview  Lt. Kernal uses a 5¼\\" Hard disk drive with a capacity of 10 MB and later up to 330 MB. The hard drive uses MFM modulation to encode data and a ST-506 interface to the OMTI 5300 intelligent SASI controller. This controller board presents a SASI interface (SCSI) externally that is connected via a cable with DB-25 connectors in both ends. That is plugged into the host adapter that handles the SASI signals and protocol with a controller that plugs directly into the 44-pin ROM cartridge expansion slot in the form of a physical edge connector that mates the controller board to the system bus of the host computer. The connection between the computer host adapter (DB-25F) and the hard drive unit consists of a cable with two DB-25 connectors. A key feature of the Lt. Kernal is its sophisticated disk operating system, which behaves much like that of the Point 4 minicomputers that Fiscal was reselling in the 1980s. A high degree of control over the Lt. Kernal is possible with simple typed commands, many of which had never been seen before in the 8-bit Commodore environment. It features a keyed random access filing system.  Reception  The Lt. Kernal was favorably and comprehensively reviewed in The Transactor, which praised the drive's speed, storage capacity, and ease of use. Some criticism was levied at the product's incomplete documentation, its drain on the resources of the host computer (particularly with the Commodore 64, whose limited memory requires frequent paging of the DOS), and the lack of an automated backup utility. The review noted the drive's particular suitability for professional programmers, business users, and BBS sysops.

Thermomechanical analysis is a subdiscipline of the thermomechanometry (TM) technique.International Confederation of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry (ICTAC), Nomenclature Committee, Recommendations for names and definitions in thermal analysis and calorimetry, Document IND98030. Related techniques and terminology Thermomechanometry is the measurement of a change of a dimension or a mechanical property of the sample while it is subjected to a temperature regime. An associated thermoanalytical method is thermomechanical analysis. A special related technique is thermodilatometry (TD), the measurement of a change of a dimension of the sample with a negligible force acting on the sample while it is subjected to a temperature regime. The associated thermoanalytical method is thermodilatometric analysis (TDA). TDA is often referred to as zero force TMA. The temperature regime may be heating, cooling at a rate of temperature change that can include stepwise temperature changes, linear rate of change, temperature modulation with a set frequency and amplitude, free (uncontrolled) heating or cooling, or maintaining a constant increase in temperature. The sequence of temperatures with respect to time may be predetermined (temperature programmed) or sample controlled (controlled by a feedback signal from the sample response). Thermomechanometry includes several variations according to the force and the way the force is applied. Static force TM (sf-TM) is when the applied force is constant; previously called TMA with TD as the special case of zero force. Dynamic force TM (df-TM) is when the force is changed as for the case of a typical stress–strain analysis; previously called TMA with the term dynamic meaning any alteration of the variable with time, and not to be confused with dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Modulated force TM (mf-TM) is when the force is changed with a frequency and amplitude; previously called DMA. The term modulated is a special variant of dynamic, used to be consistent with modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry (mt-DSC) and other situations when a variable is imposed in a cyclic manner.Menard K. P., (1999), Dynamic Mechanical Analysis; A Practical Introduction, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Chapter 3.  Mechanical test  Mechanical testing seeks to measure mechanical properties of materials using various test specimen and fixture geometries using a range of probe types. Measurement is desired to take place with minimal disturbance of the material being measured. Some characteristics of a material can be measured without disturbance, such as dimensions, mass, volume, density. However, measurement of mechanical properties normally involves disturbance of the system being measured. The measurement often reflects the combined material and measuring device as the system. Knowledge of a structure can be gained by imposing an external stimulus and measuring the response of the material with a suitable probe. The external stimulus can be a stress or strain, however in thermal analysis the influence is often temperature. Thermomechanometry is where a stress is applied to a material and the resulting strain is measured while the material is subjected to a controlled temperature program. The simplest mode of TM is where the imposed stress is zero. No mechanical stimulus is imposed upon the material, the material response is generated by a thermal stress, either by heating or cooling. =Zero force thermomechanometry= Zero force TM (a variant of sf-TM or TD) measures the response of the material to changes in temperature and the basic change is due to activation of atomic or molecular phonons. Increased thermal vibrations produce thermal expansion characterized by the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) that is the gradient of the graph of dimensional change versus temperature. CTE depends upon thermal transitions such as the glass transition. CTE of the glassy state is low, while at the glass transition temperature (Tg) increased degrees of molecular segmental motion are released so CTE of the rubbery state is high. Changes in an amorphous polymer may involve other sub-Tg thermal transitions associated with short molecular segments, side-chains and branches. The linearity of the sf-TM curve will be changed by such transitions. Other relaxations may be due to release of internal stress arising from the non-equilibrium state of the glassy amorphous polymer. Such stress is referred to as thermal aging. Other stresses may be as a result of moulding pressures, extrusion orientation, thermal gradients during solidification and externally imparted stresses. Semi- crystalline polymers Semi-crystalline polymers are more complex than amorphous polymers, since the crystalline regions are interspersed with amorphous regions. Amorphous regions in close association to the crystals or contain common molecules as tie molecules have less degrees of freedom than the bulk amorphous phase. These immobilised amorphous regions are called the rigid amorphous phase. CTE of the rigid amorphous phase is expected to be lower than that of the bulk amorphous phase. The crystallite are typically not at equilibrium and they may contain different polymorphs. The crystals re- organize during heating so that they approach the equilibrium crystalline state. Crystal re-organization is a thermally activated process. Further crystallization of the amorphous phase may take place. Each of these processes will interfere with thermal expansion of the material. The material may be a blend or a two-phase block or graft copolymer. If both phases are amorphous then two Tg will be observed if the material exists as two phases. If one Tg is exhibited then it will be between the Tg of the components and the resultant Tg will likely be described by a relationship such as the Flory-Fox or Kwei equations. If one of the components is semi-crystalline then the complexity of a pure crystalline phase and either one or two amorphous phases will result. If both components are semi-crystalline then the morphology will be complex since both crystal phases will likely form separately, though with influence on each other. Cross-linking Cross-linking will restrict the molecular response to temperature change since degree of freedom for segmental motions are reduced as molecules become irreversibly linked. Cross-linking chemically links molecules, while crystallinity and fillers introduce physical constraints to motion. Mechanical properties such as derived from stress- strain testing are used to calculate crosslink density that is usually expressed as the molar mass between crosslinks (Mc). The sensitivity of zero stress TMA to crosslinking is low since the structure receives minimum disturbance. Sensitivity to crosslinks requires high strain such that the segments between crosslinks become fully extended. Zero force TM will only be sensitive to changes in the bulk that are expressed as a change in a linear dimension of the material. The measured change will be the resultant of all processes occurring as the temperature is changed. Some of the processes will be reversible, others irreversible, and others time-dependent. The methodology must be chosen to best detect, distinguish and resolve the thermal expansion or contractions observable. The TM instrument need only apply sufficient stress to keep the probe in contact with the specimen surface, but it must have high sensitivity to dimensional change. The experiment must be conducted at a temperature change rate slow enough for the material to approach thermal equilibrium throughout. While the temperature should be the same throughout the material it will not necessarily be at thermal equilibrium in the context of molecular relaxations. The temperature of the molecules relative to equilibrium is expressed as the fictive temperature. The fictive temperature is the temperature at which the unrelaxed molecules would be at equilibrium.  Zero-stress thermomechanometry experimental TM is sufficient for zero stress experiments since superimposition of a frequency to create a dynamic mechanical experiment will have no effect since there is no stress other than a nominal contact stress. The material can be best characterized by an experiment in which the original material is first heated to the upper temperature required, then the material should be cooled at the same rate, followed by a second heating scan. The first heating scan provides a measure of the material with all of its structural complexities. The cooling scan allows and measures the material as the molecules lose mobility, so it is going from an equilibrium state and gradually moving away from equilibrium as the cooling rate exceeds the relaxation rate. The second heating scan will differ from the first heating scan because of thermal relaxation during the first scan and the equilibration achieved during the cooling scan. A second cooling scan followed by a third heating scan can be performed to check on the reliability of the prior scans. Different heating and cooling rates can be used to produce different equilibrations. Annealing at specific temperatures can be used to provide different isothermal relaxations that can be measured by a subsequent heating scan. =Static-force TM= The sf-TM experiments duplicate experiments that can be performed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A limitation of DSC is that the heat exchange during a process or due to the heat capacity of the material cannot be measured over long times or at slow heating or cooling rates since the finite quantity of heat exchanges will be dispersed over too long a time to be detected. The limitation does not apply to sf-TM since the dimensional change of the material can be measured over any time. The constraint is the practical time for the experiment. The application of multiple scans is shown above to distinguish reversible from irreversible changes. Thermal cycling and annealing steps can be added to provide complex thermal programs to test various attributes of a material as more becomes known about the material. =Modulated-temperature TM= Modulated temperature TM (mt-TM) has been used as an analogous experiment to modulated-temperature DSC (mtDSC). The principle of mt-TM is similar to the DSC analogy. The temperature is modulated as the TM experiment proceeds. Some thermal processes are reversible, such as the true CTE, while others such as stress relief, orientation randomization and crystallization are irreversible within the conditions of the experiment. The modulation conditions should be different from mt-DSC since the sample and test fixture and enclosure is larger thus requiring longer equilibration time. mt-DSC typically uses a period of 60 s, amplitude 0.5-1.0 °C and average heating or cooling rate of 2 °C·min-1. MT-TMA may have a period of 1000 s with the other parameters similar to mt-DSC. These conditions will require long scan times. Another experiment is an isothermal equilibration where the material is heated rapidly to a temperature where relaxations can proceed more rapidly. Thermal aging can take several hours or more under ideal conditions. Internal stresses may relax rapidly. TM can be used to measure the relaxation rates and hence characteristic times for these events, provides they are within practical measurements times available for the instrument. Temperature is the variable that can be changed to bring relaxations into measurable time ranges. Table 1. Typical zero-stress thermomechanometry parameters  Static force thermomechanometry experimental  Creep and stress relaxation measures the elasticity, viscoelasticity and viscous behaviour of materials under a selected stress and temperature. Tensile geometry is the most common for creep measurements. A small force is initially imparted to keep the specimen aligned and straight. The selected stress is applied rapidly and held constant for the required time; this may be 1 h or more. During application of force the elastic property is observed as an immediate elongation or strain. During the constant force period the time dependent elastic response or viscoelasticity, together with the viscous response, result in further increase in strain.Wellisch E., Marker L., Sweeting O. J. (1961), Viscoelastic properties of regenerated cellulose, J. Appl. Polym. Sci., 5, 647-654.Genovese A., Shanks, R. A. (2007), Time-temperature creep behaviour of poly(propylene) and polar ethylene copolymer blends, Macromol. Mat. Eng., 292, 184-196. The force is removed rapidly, though the small alignment force is maintained. The recovery measurement time should be four times the creep time, so in this example the recovery time should be 4 h. Upon removal of the force the elastic component results in an immediate contraction. The viscoelastic recovery is exponential as the material slowly recovers some of the previously imparted creep strain. After recovery there is a permanent unrecovered strain due to the viscous component of the properties.Fancey K. S. (2005), A mechanical model for creep, recovery and stress relaxation in polymeric materials, J. Materials Sci., 40, 4827-4831. Analysis of the data is performed using the four component viscoelastic model where the elements are represented by combinations of springs and dashpots. The experiment can be repeated using different creep forces. The results for varying forces after the same creep time can be used to construct isochronal stress–strain curves. The creep and recovery experiment can be repeated under different temperatures. The creep–time curves measured at various temperatures can be extended using the time-temperature-superposition principle to construct a creep and recovery mastercurve that extends the data to very long and very short times. These times would be impractical to measure directly. Creep at very long timeframes is important for prediction of long term properties and product lifetimes. A complementary property is stress relaxation, where a strain is applied and the corresponding stress change is measured. The mode of measurement is not directly available with most thermomechanical instruments. Stress relaxation is available using any standard universal test instruments, since their mode of operation is application of strain, while the stress is measured.  Dynamic force thermomechanometry experimental  Experiments where the force is changed with time are called dynamic force thermomechanometry (df-TM). This use of the term dynamic is distinct from the situation where the force is periodically changed with time, typically following a sine relationship, where the term modulated is recommended. Most thermomechanical instruments are force controlled, that is they apply a force, then measure a resulting change in a dimension of the test specimen. Usually a constant strain rate is used for stress–strain measurements, but in the case of df-TM the stress will be applied at a chosen rate. The result of a stress-strain analysis is a curve that will reveal the modulus (hardness) or compliance (softness, the reciprocal of modulus). The modulus is the slope of the initial linear region of the stress–strain curve. Various ways of selecting the region to calculate gradient are used such as the initial part of the curve, another is to select a region defined by the secant to the curve. If the test material is a thermoplastic a yield zone may be observed and a yield stress (strength) calculated. A brittle material will break before it yields. A ductile material will further deform after yielding. When the material breaks a break stress (ultimate stress) and break strain are calculated. The area under the stress–strain curve is the energy required to break (toughness). Thermomechanical instruments are distinct in that they can measure only small changes in linear dimension (typically 1 to 10 mm) so it is possible to measure yield and break properties for small specimens and those that do not change dimensions very much before exhibiting these properties. A purpose of measuring a stress–strain curve is to establish the linear viscoelastic region (LVR). LVR is this initial linear part of a stress–strain curve where an increase in stress is accompanied by a proportional increase in strain, that is the modulus is constant and the change in dimension is reversible. A knowledge of LVR is a prerequisite for any modulated force thermomechanometry experiments. Conduct of complex experiments should be preceded by preliminary experiments with a limited range of variables to establish the behaviour of the test material for selection of further instrument configuration and operating parameters.  Modulated temperature thermomechanometry experimental  Modulated temperature conditions are where the temperature is changed in a cyclic manner such as in a sine, isothermal-heating, isothermal-cooling or heat-cool. The underlying temperature can increase, decrease or be constant. Modulated temperature conditions enable separation of the data into reversing data that is in-phase with the temperature changes, and non-reversing that is out-of-phase with the temperature changes. Sf-TM is required since the force should be constant while the temperature is modulated, or at least constant for each modulation period. A reversing properties is coefficient of thermal expansion. Non-reversing properties are thermal relaxations, stress relief and morphological changes that occur during heating, causing the material to approach thermal equilibrium.Wurm A., Merzlyakov M., Schick C. (1999), Temperature modulated dynamic mechanical analysis, Thermochimica Acta, 330, 121-130.  References  *Prof. Robert A.

A lifelong member of the Democratic Party, while serving in Congress, at the urging of Republicans he switched parties on December 22, 2009. He ran for re- election in 2010 but was defeated in the Republican primary by Mo Brooks. Griffith ran against Brookes in a rematch in 2012 but was defeated by a larger margin. He returned to the Democratic Party in 2014 and unsuccessfully ran for Governor of Alabama in the 2014 election. Early life, education, and medical career Griffith was born in Shreveport, Louisiana. He taught 7th-grade arithmetic for less than a year at T.H. Harris Junior High School (later Middle School) in Metaire in Jefferson Parish in suburban New Orleans prior to being admitted to medical school. He received his medical degree from the Louisiana State University Medical School in 1970 and served in residency at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. After serving at the LSU Service Charity Hospital in New Orleans and a year of neurosurgery at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in Galveston, Texas, Griffith began preparing to become a radiation oncologist, one who specializes in using radiation to cure cancer, training in radiation oncology through a combined program between UTMB and M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. He served as a Medical Corps captain in the U.S. Army Reserve from 1970 to 1973, while continuing his medical training at the LSU Service Charity Hospital in New Orleans. Griffith was recruited on a \\"cold call\\" to Alabama and established the Huntsville Cancer Treatment Center. As a physician, he provided discounted care to patients who lacked insurance. Griffith also conducted several clinical trials in conjunction with the University of Alabama School of Medicine, and partnered with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee He retired from medicine in December 1992, though he still holds a license to practice in both Alabama and Texas. Early political career Griffith unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Huntsville against the three-term incumbent, Loretta Spencer in 2004. He then won a seat in the Alabama State Senate, representing the 7th district. He carried 66% of the vote to his opponent's 34%.Flashpoint Blog During his term in the State Senate, he sponsored bills to promote investment in alternative fuels, cut taxes, and establish a Statewide Trauma Care System to speed critical medical care. U.S. House of Representatives =Elections= ;2008 On March 22, 2008 Griffith announced that he would run for the open seat in the 5th District. The district's 9-term incumbent, fellow Democrat Bud Cramer, was not running for reelection.Campbell, Steve. Griffith is running for Cramer's seat Huntsville Times, April 10, 2008. He won the June 2008 Democratic primary election with 90% of the vote, defeating physicist David Maker. Cramer had endorsed Griffith in the primary.Lowry, Bob. Bud Cramer says he is endorsing Parker Griffith , Huntsville Times, April 10, 2008 Griffith faced Republican Wayne Parker, an insurance agent from Huntsville, in the November election. Parker had sought this seat unsuccessfully twice before, in 1994 and 1996, losing both times to Bud Cramer. The 5th was considered one of the few realistic chances for a Republican pickup in what was forecast to be a very bleak year for Republicans because of the district's and state's recent voting history. While Democrats still held most local offices as well as most state legislative seats in the area, the district's residents had become increasingly willing to support Republicans at the national and state level. It last supported a Democrat for president in 1984, and George W. Bush and John McCain won the district by wide double-digit margins in 2000, 2004 and, ultimately, 2008. Due to these trends, most forecasters rated the district as a toss-up. CQ Politics forecast the race as 'No Clear Favorite', The Cook Political Report ranked it 'Democratic Toss-Up', and The Rothenberg Political Report rated it 'Pure Toss-Up'.U.S. House, Alabama – 2nd District CQ Politics2008 Competitive House Race Chart The Cook Political Report, August 30, 20082008 House Ratings The Rothenberg Political Report, July 19, 2008 Griffith prevailed by taking 52 percent of the vote to Parker's 48 percent. He carried all but one of the district's seven counties. This came even as McCain (who carried the 5th with 61 percent of the vote) and Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions (whose seat was up for re-election) won every county in the district. His victory, and that of Bobby Bright in the 2nd District, gave Alabama two white Democratic congressmen for the first time since Glen Browder and Tom Bevill left the House in 1997. ;2010 Griffith ran for re-election to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Republican in 2010, but was defeated in the June 1 Republican primary by Madison County Commissioner Mo Brooks. Brooks received 51% of the vote, narrowly avoiding a run-off. Griffith received 33%. Conservative activist Les Phillip received 16%. ;2012 In January 2012, he filed for a rematch against Brooks in the Republican primary. He said of the incumbent, \\"We'll contrast my time in Congress with my opponent's time in Congress. The distinction is clear, he has wandered away from many of the issues people want us to address.\\" Brooks defeated him in the rematch 71%–29%, a landslide margin of 42 points. He won all five of the counties. Griffith did four points worse than he did in the 2010 primary. ;2014 Supporters of Griffith circulated petitions to place him on the November ballot as an Independent. Griffith considered running but decided against it. =Tenure= Griffith has stated that he leans conservative on a variety of issues, though not all. He states he is a fiscal conservative who has called repeatedly for reducing the national debt. He is a strong supporter of NASA and America's dominance in space. Griffith voted against the Affordable Health Care for America Act, cap-and-trade legislation and the 2009 economic stimulus act. ;Party switch Griffith was a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, but on December 22, 2009, he announced he would become a Republican. He cited the health care bill as a major reason for his switch, and he had also clashed with the Democrats over fiscal and foreign policy. During his announcement, he stated: > I believe our nation is at a crossroads and I can no longer align myself > with a party that continues to pursue legislation that is bad for our > country, hurts our economy, and drives us further and further into debt. The GOP had been courting Griffith since August, when he publicly criticized the Democratic House leadership in the wake of raucous town hall meetings in his district, stating that he wouldn't vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker as she is \\"divisive and polarizing\\". He also opposed the White House's decision to cancel a missile defense shield in Europe, which could have contributed to Huntsville's defense industry. His switch is the first time a member of Congress switched from the majority party to the minority party since New York Representative Michael Forbes' switch from Republican to Democrat in 1999. Forbes also lost his primary campaign following his switch. The 5th was one of the few districts in the former Confederacy that, at the time, had not elected a Republican since Reconstruction. In January 2010, rebelling against his party switch, Griffith's congressional staff resigned en masse, including his chief of staff, legislative director, press secretary, and his intern. Shortly after switching parties, Griffith joined the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of conservative House Republicans. Griffith's voting record veered sharply to the right after his switch. He'd garnered a 56 from the American Conservative Union in 2009, but in 2010 garnered a 95. Upon Griffith's party switch, he became the first Republican to represent Alabama's 5th district since John Benton Callis, who was elected to a single term (1868-1870) during Reconstruction. =Committee assignments= * Committee on Energy and Commerce ** Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet ** Subcommittee on Energy and Environment ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations =Caucus memberships= * Missile Defense (co-chair) * Modeling and Simulation * NASA House Action Committee 2014 gubernatorial election Griffith ran for Governor of Alabama in the 2014 election.

Frequently labeled as black metal, progressive metal, and avant-garde metal, Kekal plays a very diverse range of music styles within the frame of metal and rock, incorporating many other music genres such as ambient, electronic, jazz fusion, and progressive rock. Over the course of its career, Kekal has transitioned from a heavy metal-based style to a more experimental and electronic sound. Throughout its entire career, the band has released eleven full-length studio albums, three EPs, several compilations and contributions to various collaborative albums, and in 2004 engaged in a successful European mini-tour. As of 12 August 2009, all key-members have officially left Kekal, but continue to contribute material. Though the band currently has no official members, former members of the band contributed to an eighth studio album entitled 8 which was officially released in 2010, ninth studio album entitled Autonomy in 2012, tenth studio album Multilateral in 2015 and eleventh studio album Deeper Underground in 2018. History =Early years (formation to 2002)= The early history of Kekal started out in 1990, when 16-year-old musician Jeff Arwadi formed a self-styled \\"punkish thrash metal\\" band called Obliteration with some of his high school friends, but Jeff quit this group in 1991 to better learn guitar. Kekal was officially formed on 15 August 1995, by two friends, simply named under pseudonyms Yeris and Newbabe (the latter revealed years later as Newin Atmarumeksa), as a more straightforward extreme metal band. The name Kekal was coined by Newbabe, and is Indonesian for 'Immortal' or 'Eternal'. The band was intended as a one time project, and recruited a vocalist known simply as \\"Harry\\" to help record a four-song demo tape. This demo began to circulate and caught the attention of future guitarist Leo, who had gained experience in a Metallica and Megadeth cover band. Archived from the original, 20 November 2010 09:36:11. In June 1996, Azhar Sianturi joined Kekal and the band recorded its official demo, entitled Contra Spiritualia Nequitiae, using the songwriting and production talents of Jeff Arwadi, who was also a member of the group Inner Warfare. According to Jeff, the demo was recorded in his bedroom with only a Fostex X-28 4-track tape recorder and $2 karaoke microphone. With the help of underground tape trading circles and local fanzines, the demo soon caught the attention of the metal scene outside Indonesia and Southeast Asia, and few record labels began offering deals. Later that year Leo Setiawan joined the band, and in April 1997 Kekal began to record its self-produced debut album, Beyond the Glimpse of Dreams, released in 1998. The album was licensed to and released by two record labels, allowing for Kekal to be known internationally, especially in the underground metal circles around Europe and North America. Harry left the band after this recording, and the remaining trio released Embrace the Dead the next year. Jeff has expressed disappointment with this album, both in the stylistic direction, which was intentionally designed to appeal to a more mainstream audience, and in the recording sessions, which would inspire the title of the band's next album, The Painful Experience. Transcribed from the liner notes to the Introduce Us to Immortality compilation. The following year the band contributed to a Living Sacrifice tribute album with a cover of that band's song \\"Mind Distant\\". In October 2001, the band's third album, The Painful Experience, was released. Leo Setiawan left the band before the recording sessions and moved to Melbourne, Australia, but he was still listed on the album credits as a guitarist due to his contribution on the album's songwriting and general concept. In 2002, the band was reduced to a duo, and collaborated with the Dutch band Slechtvalk to record a split album entitled Chaos & Warfare, and also recorded a cover of \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" for the compilation album Brutal Christmas: The Season in Chaos. =International scene (2003–2006)= Kekal was noted for playing live for Bobfest at Cupolen, Linköping, Sweden, on 5 March 2004. In 2003, with the absence of Leo as a guitarist, the remaining members Jeff and Azhar Levi recorded a cover song \\"Dance Macabre\\" for a well received Cradle of Filth tribute album entitled Covered in Filth, and shortly after they released the highly progressive and experimental 1000 Thoughts of Violence which was also well received, being rated eight out of ten by Rock Hard and was regarded as a highlight of the year 2003 by Powermetal.de. A best-of collection of works and re-recordings of Kekal entitled Introduce Us to Immortality was also released that year. Also that year, Kekal received notice by the Antwerp-based radio show \\"Psych Folk\\" Radio on Radio Centraal, being referred to in that show's programs on progressive music in Indonesia.; The success of 1000 Thoughts of Violence was followed up by a two-week European mini-tour, arranged and promoted by the band's record label in Europe at the time, Fear Dark. In March 2004, the band played a string of shows in the Netherlands, Germany and Sweden, and was featured in the Dutch magazine Aardschok. That year also saw the release of Spirits of the Ancient Days, a collection of early Kekal demo songs. Upon return to Indonesia, Kekal was back in the studio to record a fifth album Acidity which included guest musician Didi Priyadi on guitars, as well as playing some local shows with him as an additional live guitarist. Acidity was released in 2005 and was an official reunion album for the band, which marked the return of Leo, and a vocal contribution by founding member Newbabe. Acidity was well received, and Kekal was again noted by \\"Psych Folk\\" Radio. In 2006, the band started recording their sixth album, The Habit of Fire. In 2006, Jeff leaked two cover songs, \\"The Prow\\", originally by Voivod, and \\"Juices Like Wine\\", originally by Celtic Frost, both of which were recorded in 2005. =Jeff's move to Canada (2006–2008)= In 2006, right after the recording of The Habit of Fire, founding member Jeff Arwadi moved to Canada while the rest of the members were in Indonesia, leaving the band unable to play shows and do touring. At the same time they left their longtime record label Fear Dark and status of the band was in question. After few months of uncertainty and rumors of break-up went around among their fans, they all decided to remain together and to keep the band only as a studio project. They quickly signed licensing deals with two record labels to release The Habit of Fire in 2007. The album was received very well and was named CD of the Month by UK's music technology magazine Sound on Sound, as well as being nominated as The Best Avantgarde Metal Album in 2007 by Metal Storm. In 2007, Jeff leaked another cover tune, \\"Redemption\\", that originally was planned as part of a Johnny Cash tribute album by Open Grave Records, a project that was ultimately shelved. Later in 2007, Jeff announced on the band's Myspace blog that a new Kekal album was on the way, which he had been working on all by himself. Audible Minority album session - 2008 It was revealed later on that the new album was entitled Audible Minority, and it was meant to be released officially on 25 December 2008 as two versions: a free download and a limited edition Digipak with total 11 songs including a cover of the A-ha song \\"Locust\\". Unfortunately the Digipak version was never released, and the album ended up being offered only as a free download instead. =Departure of band members (2009)= In March 2009, Azhar Levi decided to step down from Kekal. Jeff Arwadi said that although this closed a door, Kekal would continue as a musical unit in a \\"new era\\" of the band's history. On 12 August 2009, Jeff announced that he and Leo had left Kekal, and that the name would continue but without active members. He said that, as well as unspecified personal reasons, he decided to leave the band because, after being closer to nature and in a less densely populated city in Canada, he was unable to continue to make dark and angry metal music which he did in the past with Kekal. Shortly after, Kekal put up an offer of three albums for free download on its website, including its best-selling album to date, 1000 Thoughts of Violence. Many of its fans perceived that Kekal had technically split-up/disbanded at the moment band leader Jeff announced his departure from the band, despite the fact that Kekal as an institution still existed and the institution itself was not affected by any founding member leaving. To end the confusions among the fans, the band issued a statement posted on its official Facebook page: \\"KEKAL IS NOT DEAD!!!! When Jeff left Kekal it doesn't mean the band is dead!\\" The band's MySpace and Facebook pages are still active and currently being moderated mainly by volunteers from the band's Street Team members, as well as Azhar and Jeff themselves. =Current activity (2010–present)= On 13 January 2010, Kekal announced that a new album was in the works, and that former members Jeff, Leo, and Levi were all contributing. Then, on 15 February, Jeff posted a music video on his YouTube channel for an, at that time, untitled new album. The music video was for a song entitled \\"Tabula Rasa\\", which was also released for streaming. On 23 June 2010, the band announced on its Myspace and Facebook that it would release its eighth album entitled 8 in late 2010, and that further details would be forthcoming. On 15 August 2010, a remastered, limited-edition version of the band's second album, Embrace the Dead, was released as a free-download for up 1000 downloads in celebration of the band's 15-year anniversary. Kekal's newest album, 8, was made available for pre-order on 22 December 2010 by Whirlwind Records, which included an offer of free shipping within Europe up to 24 December. The album was released on 23 January 2011. On 2 March 2011, Jeff Arwadi announced on the Kekal Facebook page that he and Leo were recording new music, and said that another album would probably be released sometime in 2012. On 2 April, Kekal announced that a download-only EP would be released in June or July, and would contain two brand new tracks recorded in 2011, as well as separate guitar and vocal tracks of \\"Tabula Rasa\\" for the purpose of remixing by the general public. On 26 April, Jeff uploaded a music video for the song \\"Futuride\\" from the upcoming EP, which was promised to be released in July. The official release date for the album, 10 July 2011, was announced over Facebook on 23 June 2011. The title of the EP was Futuride EP, and three tracks from the album were made available for public use under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike license. On 24 February 2012, Kekal announced the title of its ninth studio album, Autonomy, and the album was released on 19 December 2012, first as a limited, hand-numbered deluxe-edition double-CD with the 2008 album Audible Minority (which was previously never released on CD) added as a bonus disc. On 29 June 2013, Autonomy was released by Indonesian netlabel Yes No Wave Music as a free digital download, but restricted to Indonesian market only. On 19 March 2013 Kekal released a surprise EP, Unsung Division EP, announced the 10th full-length Kekal album, Multilateral, would be released in 2015, and the possibility of a second EP in late 2013 or 2014. The Unsung Division EP consisted of songs originally written for the 2015 album, but removed as the \\"some compositions turned out to be a bit out-of- place with the rest of the album's general concept,\\" according to Arwadi. In 2017, the band announced a new album for 2018, entitled Deeper Underground. Music =Style= Although mainly known as a progressive metal and avant- garde or experimental metal band, Kekal has stylistic origins in extreme metal, particularly black metal, but even with its debut album the band demonstrated a unique style. Beyond the Glimpse of Dreams featured a varied sound of black and death metal and incorporated a range of vocal styles such as high pitched black metal shrieks, death growls, and female singing. On Embrace the Dead, Kekal used a combination of black metal with death, classic, and doom metal elements and included hints of Gothic and dark wave. The third album, The Painful Experience, saw the band fusing its black metal style with progressive metal and included elements of thrash, classic, and power metal. Mark Allan Powell described that most of the band's songs were midtempo to fast with a heavy, guitar-driven style, though the band incorporated \\"certain elements of variety into the sound.\\" In a 2001 interview, Jeff expressed ambivalence to what style the band was described as, as long as it was \\"metal\\". On its fourth, highly technical album, 1000 Thoughts of Violence, the band plunged into ultra-progressive experiments, The album was noted for switching between raging intensity and more mellow passages, such as the song \\"Violent Society\\", which even included a hip-hop passage. Powermetal.de noted that the band had become more progressive and lost some of its toughness and aggression. \\"Psych Folk\\" Radio viewed the album favorably, mentioning that 1000 Thoughts of Violence \\"is a possibility to invite progressive rock listeners to take the challenge to open up their perspectives.\\" In March 2004, Aardschok Magazine described the band's albums as a mix of black, heavy, and progressive metal, being grounded in the extreme metal scene. On its well received fifth album, Acidity, Kekal used double bass drum blasts and saw the band incorporating styles such as electronic, black metal, progressive metal, progressive rock, classic rock, indie rock, psychedelic rock, trip hop, jazz, ambient, and avant-garde. Jeff Arwadi responded to the \\"avant-garde\\" label in an interview with Ultimate Metal.com: \\"For us, avant-garde is not a classification of music. It is a state of being, a state of becoming... ...once your music can be classified easily, I don't think the word progressive or avant-garde fits. So that's why we mention in our bio that 'avant-garde' is an ideal state for us, and not a classification.\\" On the next album, The Habit of Fire, the band maintained its use of various music styles such as electronica, ambient, and jazz fusion, but began to shed its black metal roots and introduced atmospheric soundscapes and an industrial vibe. Pop Matters described the album as mixing black metal, noise rock, progressive rock, and jazz fusion. With the 2010 album 8, the first album by the band without any active members, Metal Hammer Germany noted that the band was now far away from its early black metal days. Powermetal.de described the band as avant-garde tinged post-rock, with the album being predominantly electronic, but stated that \\"experimental\\" was the simplest description of the album. The reviewer, Björn Backes, made comparisons to The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers and noted the use of \\"weird\\" arrangements, post-rock mood swings and alternative guitar sound. Sonic Seducer called the album simply avant-garde and described the band as loving triplets, polyrhythms, and complex beats. =Influences= Kekal has identified itself with the punk rock and early 1980s metal scenes, and considers itself a \\"street-progressive\\" band that is aesthetically more akin to Sonic Youth or The Mars Volta than to technically oriented bands like Dream Theater. The band claims roots in 1980s forms of heavy metal as pioneered by bands like Iron Maiden, Bathory, Trouble, Helloween, Celtic Frost, Sodom, Death, and Massacre. Dimebag Darrell and Quorthon have also been cited as influences. Currently, Kekal has cited an influence from many styles of music and now lists a large host of artists as an inspiration, including A-ha, Amebix, Autechre, Björk, Black Sabbath, Bohren & der Club of Gore, Camel, Celtic Frost, Cocteau Twins, Chick Corea, The Cure, Miles Davis, Depeche Mode, Discharge, Duran Duran, Gazebo, Godflesh, Iron Maiden, Joy Division, Killing Joke, King Crimson, Led Zeppelin, Mantronix, Massive Attack, Curtis Mayfield, Merzbow, Pat Metheny, Wes Montgomery, Gary Moore, Napalm Death, Outkast, Pan Sonic, Paradise Lost, Parliament, Pet Shop Boys, Pink Floyd, The Police, Portishead, Radiohead, Red Snapper, Return to Forever, Rush, Sonic Youth, Squarepusher, Talk Talk, Tangerine Dream, Amon Tobin, Trouble, and Voivod. =Songwriting and recording techniques= Jeff has stated that starting from the album The Painful Experience they incorporated their own approach to record drum tracks in the studio which they call \\"hybrid drums\\", a mix of real-time performance and software-based matrix programming. He also mentioned the efficiency of using the hybrid drumming compared with getting a drummer: \\"About the drummer, it is still very hard to find a right drummer because Kekal music is ranging from very extreme-metal with blast beats and fast double-kicks, to powerful rock beats that demand steady tempo, and to some polyrhythmic playing and time-signature shifts in the characteristics of jazz and prog drumming. We would need 2 or 3 kinds of drummer for Kekal. That's why the best thing for the recording is to make the hybrid drumming.\\" In other interview, Jeff mentioned the process of recording of The Habit of Fire, starting from collecting samples and creating MIDI information, then manipulating the sounds to create what he called the 'skeleton'. Then riffs, MIDI-triggered instruments, synthesizers, and melodies would be added and the structure re-arranged once again. Once the song structure was set, the guitars would be re-recorded, then bass and drum tracks would be put on top, then vocals. Jeff also mentioned during the interview about the 2011 Futuride EP, that he has experimented with additive synthesis on the recent songs he has recorded and uses guitars to counterbalance the sounds generated by the additive synthesis. Ethics and ideological stance =Kekal and Anarchism= Kekal claims to have practiced Anarchism since the beginning of its career, which in their own words \\"translates to non- hierarchical and anti-authoritarian approach to self-governing/self-managing\\", including voluntary contribution, free association and a strong DIY ethic. Kekal never grants copyrights of the band's recording masters to any record labels (since 2010 all the music have been published through Creative Commons license) and has 100% artistic control over music, production and artwork. Kekal has recorded and produced most of its albums in its own studio/workstation, manages the band itself, does its own photo sessions, and designs its own album artwork and covers. As Jeff stated, \\"So far, we've been known as an independent band who never want to get signed by record label, to maintain our independency and control over our artistic freedom, and also to own our recording masters and copyright.. Instead of band signing, we always prefer to license our finished albums to record labels.\\" =Kekal and Christianity= Kekal has been described by AllMusic as one of the first black metal bands to profess Christian beliefs. However, the band has stated on its Facebook page that as an institution it is not a Christian metal band and does not endorse any particular religion or ideology. Known to have fans from different religious backgrounds, and with the majority of their listeners being non-Christians, the band has always maintained that it is about music, life, and universality, and stands against any form of elitism and exclusivism in today's culture. In a 2005 interview with HM Magazine, Jeff Arwadi clarified his view on Christian metal: \\"I don't want to divide our fans and market as religious - secular dichotomy. We always see everything as one. When we started the band, we knew nothing about the Christian metal scene, and we started just like a normal band in our underground scene. We grew up in the normal underground metal scene, and have already got attention from that scene since the very beginning. Kekal never belong to any church or some kind of ministry and never will. We are 100% just like any band you would call them as secular band.\\" In another 2005 interview, Jeff added his point on Kekal's stance as a band: \\"...we are non-conformists, musical anarchists. We hate being trendy and we never try to be the same with the rest of the scene. People can love us or hate us, I don't care.\\" The band's lyrical material for the 2020 album entitled Quantum Resolution has many Gnostic Christian references from the Nag Hammadi library writings such as Gospel of Thomas, also another noncanonical scripture known as Gospel of Mary, and the recognition regarding the world and this material universe as holographic or projection. Jeff Arwadi, in particular, has expressed his belief in Christianity that is not a religion. During the 2017 interview, he considered himself as a Christian Anarchist, and mentioned that he personally opposes the concept of religion, its dogma and hierarchical structure of authority within the church organization. The lyrics on the song called \\"Rotten in The House\\" reflect his opposition, which he describes in a 2018 interview: \\"Oftentimes, people choose to involve deeply into religion not because they want spiritual growth, but just to get away from the life of misery that they experience everyday, an escapism, so that they can 'reverse' their experience to become somewhat 'positive' for them and even 'empower' them. It's almost the same as the use of drugs in order to make you relax, to 'help' you get a good sleep, get high and forget all the problems for a moment. But the danger is also present, like in drugs, religion could become an addictive agent. Its application could gradually damage human sanity, common-sense and conscience.\\" Søren Kierkegaard is cited as a big influence in shaping his concept of faith and spirituality. In one interview, Jeff clarified that for him personally, faith is something that drives the human life, and, just like diet and exercise, does not have to be associated with religion whatsoever.

He played in Major League Baseball as a catcher for the St. Louis Cardinals (1956–61) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1965). Born in Barling, Arkansas, Smith batted and threw right-handed; he stood 5 feet 10½ inches (1.8 m) tall and weighed . After Smith's playing career was curtailed by a heart ailment during the season, he became a longtime employee of the Cardinals' organization as Major League coach, minor league manager and scout. He also served as a coach for the Pirates (1965–67), Cincinnati Reds (1968–69) and Milwaukee Brewers (1976–77). Smith was a standout catcher for the Cardinals during his six years with them. He was the club's regular receiver from 1956 until his forced retirement and was selected a National League All-Star in and . Smith led NL catchers in throwing out would-be base-stealers in both 1959 and 1960, and in caught stealing percentage in 1960. But on June 10, 1961, after starting 42 of the Cardinals' first 48 games—and shortly after he celebrated his 30th birthday—Smith complained of chest and upper abdominal pains. He was admitted to Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, where he was diagnosed with a \\"coronary artery condition.\\" Smith was forced to immediately retire from playing baseball, and was the Cardinals' bullpen coach in 1962. His disability eventually cleared the way for Tim McCarver to become the Cardinals' new regular catcher. Four years after his illness forced him to the sidelines, Smith was able to appear in four games in July 1965 for the Pirates as a player-coach on an emergency basis, when Jim Pagliaroni, Del Crandall and Ozzie Virgil were injured. Smith started one game (July 1 against the Cardinals), and was a defensive replacement in his three remaining appearances, catching for 12 total innings. He then returned to the coaching ranks on Harry Walker's staff. In a seven- season career, Smith was a .258 hitter with 437 hits, including 63 doubles, eight triples and 23 home runs and 172 RBI in 570 games. As a catcher, he appeared in 548 games and recorded 2,810 putouts, 247 assists, and only 33 errors in 2,890 total chances for a .989 fielding percentage. In 1960–61, he was one of two Hal Smiths catching in the National League; the other, Harold Wayne Smith, toiled for the Pirates. Smith is the subject of a biography, The Barling Darling: Hal Smith In American Baseball, written by Billy D. Higgins. A United States Air Force veteran during the Korean War, Smith was buried at the Fort Smith National Cemetery.Baseball Almanac His granddaughter, Jency Williams, 31 at the time, was on Supernanny on March 5, 2007, with her kids Bradley, 12, Kelsee, 10, and Hagan, 5, at the time.

It reconstituted the 1689 anti-French Grand Alliance in response to the issues that resulted in the War of the Spanish Succession. Background Europe in 1700, at the beginning of the War of the Spanish Succession The wars of Louis XIV that began in 1667 led to a number of anti- French coalitions, the most significant being the so-called Grand Alliance formed on 20 December 1689 by England, the Dutch Republic and Emperor Leopold. This took part in the 1688-97 Nine Years' War with Spain joining in 1690 and Savoy in 1691. The 1697 Treaty of Ryswick ended the war but failed to resolve the issue of who would succeed Charles II of Spain. In 1665, Charles became the last Habsburg King of Spain and despite marrying twice remained childless. Spain was no longer the dominant global power but the Spanish Empire was largely intact, still including territories in Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines and large areas of the Americas. Charles' closest heirs were either Austrian Habsburgs or French Bourbons, making his successor of great significance to the European balance of power. Marlborough circa 1702 Despite being long-time opponents, Louis XIV and William III tried to resolve the issue by diplomacy. The result was the Partition Treaties of The Hague in 1698 and London in 1700 between Britain, the United Provinces and France. When Charles died on 1 November 1700, his will named his heir as Louis' grandson, Philip of Anjou, Louis decided not to enforce the Treaty of London and he became Philip V of Spain on 16 November. Negotiations Despite the Partition Treaties, William remained sceptical given Louis' history of negotiating while simultaneously planning military action and his decision to keep the French army in being after the end of the Nine Years War. The proclamation of Philip V seemed to justify this but the Tory majority in Parliament would not go to war for the Spanish throne. Many also objected to the territorial splits envisaged by the Treaties, leading to an unsuccessful attempt to impeach the Whig leaders who approved them. This obliged William to recognise Philip but a foreign observer noted Tory opposition included the important qualifier 'so long as English commerce does not suffer.' A street- scene in The Hague c. 1650 Louis either failed to appreciate this or decided to ignore it. In early 1701, he registered Philip's claim to the French throne with the Paris Parlement, raising the possibility of union with Spain, contrary to Charles' will. In February, French troops occupied the Spanish- controlled Duchies of Milan and Mantua in Northern Italy and fortresses in the Spanish Netherlands previously held by the Dutch. This threatened the Dutch monopoly over the Scheldt granted by the 1648 Peace of Münster and English mercantile interests, since control of Antwerp and Ostend would allow France to blockade the Channel at will. Combined with the imposition of French tariffs on English imports and Spain's award of the lucrative Asiento contract on 27 August to the French Guinea Company, Tory opposition to war was gradually eroded. Wratislaw von Mitrowitz, Leopold's envoy to the Hague talks. In March, talks were held with Louis' representative the Comte d'Avaux, who made it clear he would neither comply with the 1700 Treaty or agree concessions. Parliament now authorised the creation of an anti-French alliance and a force of 10,000 men to support the Dutch, led by Marlborough who was also appointed Envoy to the United Provinces. Negotiations were held between Marlborough, Anthonie Heinsius, Grand Pensionary of Holland and the Austrian envoy Wratislaw von Mitrowitz. The main obstacle was Leopold's demand Austria receive all Spanish territories in Italy while William wanted to restrict this to Milan and the Spanish Netherlands. His experience and dual role as King and Stadtholder made William a powerful figure but his death was widely anticipated; aware much of their influence with Leopold would disappear with him, the Dutch accepted the Austrian position, forcing England to follow. Key Provisions Anthonie Heinsius, Grand Pensionary of Holland While the war was a dynastic struggle between the Habsburgs and Bourbons over the Spanish throne, allocation of territories and commercial interests were equally important; contemporaries viewed Dutch and English support for the Habsburg cause as primarily driven by a desire for access to the Spanish American markets. Trade was often used as a weapon of policy; between 1690-1704, English import duties increased by 400%, while the 1651-1663 Navigation Acts had been a major factor in the Anglo-Dutch Wars. On 6 September, France banned the import of English manufactured goods like cloth and imposed prohibitive duties on a wide range of others. On 7 September 1701, Britain, the Emperor Leopold and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of The Hague reconstituting the Grand Alliance. In addition to assigning Spanish territories in Italy and the Spanish Netherlands to Austria, its main provisions included securing the Dutch Barrier, the Protestant succession in England, commercial access for England and the Dutch Republic to the Spanish Empire but made no reference to placing Archduke Charles on the Spanish throne. Schellenberg in 1704. Aftermath When the Stuart exile James II died a few days later on 16 September, Louis reneged on his commitment at Ryswick to accept the result of the 1688 Glorious Revolution and proclaimed his Catholic son James Francis Edward King of England and Scotland. This ensured English support for war and after William's death on 19 March 1702, Queen Anne and his Dutch successors confirmed their agreement with his policies. The Grand Alliance declared war on France on 15 May 1702, followed on 30 September by the Imperial Diet.Wolf: Louis XIV, 514 The provisions of the Treaty concealed several important issues; first, neither England nor the Dutch Republic could allow France to control the Spanish Netherlands but preferred to assign it to Austria who saw it as a burden, not an asset. Second, who sat on the Spanish throne concerned England and the Dutch because of the commercial implications, an issue less important to Leopold. Differences over the relative importance assigned to Italy and Spain would lead to tensions between the Allies later in the war.

The original five participating organizations were: The National Urban League, The National Council of La Raza, the William C.

For more than a decade, from 1988 to April 2000, the CIC program did not grow beyond the original 5 organizations and languished due to a lack of funding and support. In April 2000, the Census Bureau renewed its commitment to close the minority and economic gap in data access by expanding the CIC Program to include 54 additional organizations representing under-served communities, bringing the number of Program participants to 59 organizations. Funding was made available for training, data products, postage and staff to ensure the success of the Program. Between 2000 and 2005 15 organizations left the program for various reasons.

Though not the first known banana specimens in Europe, around 1834 Cavendish received a shipment of bananas courtesy of the chaplain of Alton Towers (then the seat of the Earls of Shrewsbury). His gardener, Sir Joseph Paxton cultivated them in the greenhouses of Chatsworth House. The plants were botanically described by Paxton as Musa cavendishii, after the Duke. The Chatsworth bananas were shipped off to various places in the Pacific around the 1850s. It is believed that some of them may have ended up in the Canary Islands, though other authors believe that the bananas in the Canary Islands had been there since the fifteenth century and had been introduced through other means, namely by early Portuguese explorers who obtained them from West Africa and were later responsible for spreading them to the Caribbean. African bananas in turn were introduced from Southeast Asia into Madagascar by early Austronesian sailors. In 1888, bananas from the Canary Islands were imported into England by Thomas Fyffe. These bananas are now known to belong to the Dwarf Cavendish cultivar.Peter N. Davies, \\"Fyffes and the Banana\\", 1990, 23–51 Taxonomy Its accepted name is Musa (AAA group) 'Dwarf Cavendish'.

Description Dwarf Cavendish leaves are broad with short petioles. Its shortness makes it stable, wind-resistant, and easier to manage. This, in addition to its fast growth rate, makes it ideal for plantation cultivation. An easily recognizable characteristic of this cultivar is that the male bracts and flowers are not shed.

Often the judge will ask: \\"Where is this line of questions going?\\" and the offer of proof is the response. The offer provides the opposition a preview of the questions (and helps prevent surprise), but is essential to overcome the objections. In the context of a trial or a hearing, a presiding judge may issue a ruling denying a party the right to proffer evidence. The party aggrieved by this ruling then has the right to indicate for the record what the evidence would have shown had the adverse ruling not been issued. This is necessary in order to preserve the issue for appeal. In jury trials, offers of proof may be made outside the hearing of the jury. A party may request a motion in limine (Latin: \\"at the threshold\\") made before the start of a trial requesting that the judge rule that certain evidence may, or may not, be introduced to the jury in a trial.

Often seen at fairs and traveling carnivals, their design consists of a giant wheel which tilts at a steep angle, fluctuates in a wavelike manner, and spins at various speeds. There is a motor underneath the ride that makes both of these rides raise up and down. History Carl Sedlmayr of Royal American Shows discovered the Trabant (German for satellite) in Germany. He purchased the manufacturing rights from the young German man who invented it, and approached Harold Chance of Chance Industries to build the ride. Chance saw the potential in the ride, made it flashier by adding lights and colorful panels, and mounted it on a trailer so it would be portable. The first ride was sold in 1963 and it became very popular with traveling showmen. Chance eventually started producing a permanent model that was not mounted to a trailer. The ride was also available in a number of different themes such as Mexican Sombrero, Wagon Wheel, and Roulette Wheel. Chance sold 254 Trabant rides between 1963 and 1990. In 1991 Chance introduced the Wipeout, an updated version of the Trabant that has seating that faces in both directions and has the ability to spin faster than a Trabant. Ride cycle During the duration of the ride, the ride changes speeds. When the ride is fluctuating in its wavelike manner, the person will feel like the ride is not going that fast. However, when the ride is almost over, the person will feel forces on their body, and get pushed toward the outside of the cars. This happens when the ride starts lowering to the ground in a non-wavelike manner. When the ride moves in this way, it acts like a Himalaya / Musik Express ride. Both the Trabant and Wipeout move forwards and backwards. Because the forces experienced on the ride can cause a rider to move sideways and potentially slip under the lap bar if riding alone, riders must be seated in pairs (sharing a lap bar). Most parks and carnivals require that riders be a minimum of 42 inches [107 cm] tall with an adult, and 48 inches [123 cm] tall without an adult. The Wipeout can accommodate up to 40 people. Seating consists of 10 groups of four seats each. Each group seats a pair of riders on the left and another pair on the right. Other names of the Wipeout/Trabant are: the Mexican Hat, Hully Gully, Sombrero, Wagon Wheel, Casino, Razzle Dazzle and Super Satellite. Appearances There are only 2 traveling Trabants in the UK, The oldest one known as Craig Murray's Super Satellite available for hire only from Bounce Time. Originally built in America in 1961 by Chance Rides and now fully restored and in excellent working condition. The original one sent to Australia (built by Bennett) is still traveling, and still provides significant competition for some of the newest rides. Inners Shows out of Franklinton, NC have and operate a traveling trabant named the Drive-In at fairs and festivals up and down the east coast. El Sombrero at Six Flags Over Texas is a portable Trabant that was installed in 1965. In 2006, the ride was moved from its previous location, removed from the trailer, and given a complete overhaul. It is one of the oldest operating Trabant rides at a permanent amusement park.

It was originally built in the 16th century and was later modernized by Christine Marie of France (1606–1663) in the 17th century, with designs by the Baroque architect Filippo Juvarra. The palace also includes the Palazzo Chiablese and the Chapel of the Holy Shroud, the latter of which was built to house the famous Shroud of Turin. In 1946, the building became the property of the state and was turned into a museum. In 1997, it was placed on the UNESCO World Heritage Site list along with 13 other residences of the House of Savoy. History Construction of the palace was ordered by the Regent Christina Maria in 1645. She wanted a new residence for the court after her son returned from the civil war. The chosen location was the previous Bishop's Palace, which had been built in the middle of the new capital of Savoy, Turin, during the reign of Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy (1528–1580). Its advantages included an open and sunny position, in addition to being close to other buildings where the court met. The Duke was able to monitor the two entrances of the city (the Palatine and the Pretoria gates) from the Bishop's Palace. The Bishop's Palace in Turin was later captured by the French in 1536 and served as a residence of the French Viceroys of Savoy, who were appointed by Francis I of France. Opposite the Bishop's Palace was the Palazzo Vecchio or the Palazzo di San Giovanni. This building, disparagingly known as Pasta con Tonno (English: Pasta with tuna) because of its architecture, was later replaced by the grand Ducal Palace. Thus the old Bishop's Palace became the seat of power and was greatly expanded by Emmanuel Philibert to house his ever-growing collection of art, animals, marbles, and furniture. Emmanuel Philibert died in Turin in August 1580 and the Savoyard throne was handed down to his son, Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy (1562–1630). In celebration of the joint marriages of his daughters Princess Margaret and Princess Isabella in 1608, Charles Emmanuel I commissioned the construction of a ring of porches topped off by an open gallery. His son, the future Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy (1587–1637), entered into a prestigious marriage when he married the French Princess Christine Marie of France. Their marriage took place in Paris at the Louvre in 1619. Victor Amadeus I succeeded to the Duchy of Savoy in 1630. He had previously spent his youth in Madrid at the court of his grandfather, Philip II of Spain. His wife set the tone for Victor Amadeus I's reign. Christine Marie had the court moved from the ducal palace in Turin to the Castello del Valentino, which at that time, was on the outskirts of the small capital. Many of Victor Amadeus I and Christine Marie's children were born at Valentino, including Francis Hyacinth, Duke of Savoy and his successor Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy. Christine Marie became the regent of Savoy after the death of her husband in 1637 on behalf of her two sons, who succeeded as Dukes of Savoy. During the reign of Victor Amadeus II, the Daniel gallery was created and named after Daniel Seiter, who painted the lavish murals seen there. Victor Amadeus II also had a collection of summer apartments built to look onto the court and a winter apartment overlooking the gardens. His wife was the niece of Louis XIV, born Anne Marie d'Orléans. Louis XV's mother and aunt were born in the palace in 1685 and 1688, respectively. The Chapel of the Holy Shroud, the current location of the Shroud of Turin, was added to the structure in 1668-1694. The Dukes of Savoy became the Kings of Sicily in 1713, but they swapped to the Kingdom of Sardinia and ruled from 1720 after the Treaty of The Hague. Anne Marie d'Orléans died at the palace in 1728. The King's Throne, seen in 2018 Victor Amadeus III married Maria Antonietta of Spain and the couple preferred to reside in the country in the Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi. The Neoclassical style was introduced to the palace in the reign of Charles Emmanuel III. The palace was overshadowed by the Stupinigi building later on, when Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia married Maria Adelaide of Austria. The palace once again saw some life with the redecoration of some of its rooms. In 1946, the palace was claimed by the Italian Republic and turned into a \\"Museum of the Life and Works of the House of Savoy\\". Its rooms are decorated with rich tapestries and a collection of Chinese and Japanese vases. The Royal Armoury houses an extensive array of arms, including examples from the 16th and 17th centuries. The palace houses the Scala delle Forbici, a staircase by Filippo Juvarra. The Chapel of the Holy Shroud, with its spiral dome, was built in the west wing of the palace, joining the apse (a semicircular recess) of the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, to house the famous Shroud of Turin, which belonged to the family from 1453 until 1946.

Beginning with the featured Pro Football Hall of Fame game in early August, five weekends of exhibition games are played in the NFL to date. The start of the preseason is intrinsically tied to the last week of training camp. History Exhibition games have been played in professional football since the beginning of the sport. In fact, until league play was formalized in 1920, one could consider virtually all of an independent professional football team's schedule to be exhibitions (as in test matches). In the early years of the sport, teams often \\"barnstormed\\", and played squads from leagues outside their own, or against local college teams or other amateur groups, charging fans whatever the traffic would bear. When the NFL was founded in 1920, all games counted in the standings and would be used to determine the league champion. In 1921, this was revised to only count games involving two league members, thus allowing non-league exhibitions, but effectively banning exhibitions between two league teams. This rule had a direct impact on deciding the 1921 championship, in which the losing team insisted that the deciding game only be considered an exhibition. In 1924, the league again changed the rule to declare any games held in December or later to be exhibitions. By the mid-1930s, teams prepared for a standard 12-game regular season schedule, although even as late as 1939 teams would schedule non-league exhibition games both before and during the season (during bye weeks). The Pittsburgh Steelers (then known as the Pirates) were well known for playing both in the NFL and on a limited schedule in the decades-old Western Pennsylvania circuit in the 1930s. In the 1960s, teams began playing 14 regular season games, with a corresponding decrease in the length of the preseason. Teams played four or five preseason games each year; for example, in 1966 each of the nine American Football League teams each played four preseason games. By the end of the decade, however, there would be a rapid increase in the number of preseason games. With the AFL–NFL merger of 1970, the newly merged NFL was granted a Sherman Anti-Trust Act exemption, which emboldened some team owners to expand the exhibition schedule and to require season-ticket holders to pay for one, then two, then three home exhibition games if they wanted to keep their season tickets. From 1970 through 1977, the NFL season consisted of 14 regular season games and six exhibition games, sometimes but not always three at home and three away (the 1973 Washington Redskins, for instance, played all but one of six preseason games at home), with some played at neutral sites. In , the regular season was lengthened 16 games, and the exhibition season was cut from six to four games. From 1999 to 2001, when the league consisted of an uneven 31 teams, some additional exhibition games (usually two or three) were played over Hall of Fame weekend. In order to account for the uneven number of teams, each team was required to have a bye week during the exhibition season. Most teams held their bye week in Hall of Fame weekend, while the others utilized them somewhere else during the exhibition season. This practice was abandoned after the Houston Texans were added to the league in 2002, giving it an even 32 teams. Scheduling Unlike the regular season, the exhibition matchups are not based on any rotating or set formula. The NFL schedules the matchups for all of the exhibition games; since 2002, individual teams have been allowed to negotiate their own deals to play each other during the preseason: the league allows individual teams to provide input into desired matchups and determines the matchups for any games that were not individually negotiated, while the league sets all game dates and times. The exhibition season schedule is released in the spring, shortly before the regular season schedule is announced. The NFL has set a loose precedent of determining exhibition matchups: *No two teams have faced each other in the same exhibition season more than once since 1998. San Francisco and Seattle played twice that year in the preseason. *No NFL team has played a team outside the league from 1977 on. *Teams in the same division usually do not play one another during the exhibition season. The last in-division preseason matchup occurred in 2000. *Interconference game (AFC vs. NFC) matchups are common and encouraged, since regular season matchups between interconference teams are infrequent, with teams playing other-conference teams only once every four years during the regular season. These games allow teams to travel to particular markets more frequently than normal, and represent \\"fresh\\" matchups. *Geographically close matchups are preferred, to provide teams with minimal (if possible) exhibition season travel. As such, intrastate rivals are frequent matchups, provided they are not already division foes: Giants/Jets (the MetLife Bowl), Ravens/Redskins (Battle of the Beltways), Bucs/Dolphins/Jaguars, and Chargers/Rams (Battle for Los Angeles) are all frequent exhibition matchups. The Broncos and Cardinals, the only two teams in the Mountain Time Zone, also play every preseason (though due to Arizona non observance of daylight saving time, Denver is one hour ahead of Arizona during the NFL preseason, which occurs in August). The Eagles and Jets have concluded the preseason by playing each other annually since 2001, due to close proximity. *Teams with close personal ties often play each other. **Since 2005, the Giants and the Patriots close out their preseason together as the owners of the two teams are friends. **The Steelers and the Panthers, since 2003, close out their preseason together despite a distance between Pittsburgh and Charlotte. There are numerous Pittsburgh-area ties to the Panthers organisation, including former head coach John Fox (a former assistant at Pitt and the Steelers), ex-Steeler linebackers Greg Lloyd and Kevin Greene finishing out their careers at Carolina, and former Steelers safety Donnie Shell having served as the Panthers Director of Player Development since the team's inception. On the flip side, former Steelers head coach Bill Cowher attended N.C. State and currently lives in Raleigh. Former Steelers players Willie Parker and Jeff Reed both attended UNC. This also reflects on the increasing number of Western Pennsylvania natives in relocating to the Carolinas. **The Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions often play each other in the preseason, since the late Bills owner Ralph Wilson was a native of Detroit and at one point owned a share of the Lions. In addition, both Buffalo and Detroit are the only NFL cities that border Canada, with each city located on opposite sides of Southern Ontario. **The Los Angeles Chargers & New Orleans Saints, since 2017, have played each other because Drew Brees first played for San Diego before leaving and signed in New Orleans in 2006. *Along with general in-state rivalries, some long-established \\"Governor's Cups\\" are played annually. **Texas – Dallas Cowboys vs. Houston Texans (since 2002, Cowboys vs. Houston Oilers from 1967–1996) **Pennsylvania - Philadelphia Eagles vs. Pittsburgh Steelers **Missouri – Kansas City vs. St. Louis (currently suspended due to a lack of a team in St. Louis: Chiefs vs. Cardinals from 1970–87 and Chiefs vs. Rams from 1995–2015) *After the division realignment in 2002, the NFL factors in former division rivalries which were broken due to teams moving to different divisions if possible. For a five-year period from 2002–2006, the league had the authority to schedule former division rivals for exhibition games (the Cardinals and Seattle Seahawks, who were switched from the NFC East and AFC West, respectively, to the NFC West, are the most notable examples). It was a move intended to recover potentially lost revenue due to the end of a popular annual rivalry game. In some rare cases, the league has scheduled \\"hot\\" regular-season matchups if they did not happen to be scheduled to play that season. For instance, Tampa Bay and St. Louis had a popular mini-rivalry from 1999 to 2004. The teams were not scheduled to play one another in 2003, so the league reacted by scheduling a Monday night preseason game for them that season. **The Tennessee Titans and Pittsburgh Steelers are former division rivals in the old AFC Central. 2018 was the first time the two teams met in the preseason since the Titans became a member of the AFC South and the Steelers became a member of the AFC North. https://www.titansonline.com/news/titans-take-on-steelers-saturday-at-heinz- field **The Detroit Lions and Tampa Bay Buccaneers are former division rivals in the old NFC Central. 2018 was the first time the two teams met in the preseason since the Lions became a member of the NFC North and the Buccaneers became a member of the NFC South. https://start.att.net/news/read/category/news/article/gannett- lions_vs_buccaneers_how_to_watch_listen_stream_pre-rgannett **The Seattle Seahawks and Green Bay Packers got scheduled to play each other in the 2013 preseason in a rematch of Fail Mary. Both teams were not scheduled to play each other in the 2013 regular season. https://www.si.com/nfl/audibles/2013/08/23/fail-mary-reunion-adds-drama-to- packers-seahawks-preseason-game The teams that play in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game are determined solely by the league (and the Hall of Fame committee), featuring one AFC team and one NFC team. Its matchup is announced well in advance, around the time of the Super Bowl, when the Hall of Fame inductees are announced. Under some circumstances, the matchup is planned well into the future. For example, the Buccaneers played the Steelers in the 1998 Hall of Fame Game, a matchup that had been announced in 1983. In recent times, if there has been an expansion team added to the league, that team will be invited to play in the Hall of Fame game (Carolina, Jacksonville, the new Cleveland Browns, and Houston all played in their expansion seasons in 1995, 1999, and 2002 respectively). The 2009 game, however, was between two original American Football League teams: the Buffalo Bills and the Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers). This matchup was announced after Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. an AFL founder and the only owner ever of the Bills, was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on February 1, 2009. The Titans' owner, Bud Adams, was also the only owner his team has ever had. Wilson and Adams were the two last surviving members of the original AFL ownership cabal and are two of the only three men who have majority-owned a Professional Football franchise continuously for fifty years (the late George Halas, who owned the Chicago Bears from 1920 to 1983, is the third). The Hall of Fame game served as a kickoff to the 2009 season, which would have been the 50th season of play for the AFL had it survived as an independent entity. The 2011 (canceled), 2012, and 2016 (canceled) games were between two NFC teams. Normally, the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game has an AFC and NFC matchup, but that is not always the case. Prior to the 1970 AFL–NFL merger, it was common for teams to play each other twice in the same pre-season. Among the most recent occurrences were in 1992 when the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Oilers played on August 1 in Tokyo, then again on August 15, in Dallas, and in a more recent season, the Buccaneers and the Dolphins played each other twice in one preseason. To this day, although multiple preseason games against the same two teams are no longer common, two teams may hold a joint practice and scrimmage in addition to a preseason contest (see, for example, the Buffalo Bills and Pittsburgh Steelers in 2014). It is still somewhat common to see teams that play each other during the regular season once play a preseason game (either the two teams split in playing at the other's home stadium, or the two teams play at one of the other's home both times); the majority of preseason contests each year are between teams that do not play each other in the regular season that year. It was also commonplace for division opponents to play each other in the preseason, due to the larger size of pre-merger divisions, but has not happened since 2000, when the Seattle Seahawks played the Oakland Raiders. https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2000/preseason.htm As recently as 1984, the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers played a preseason gamehttps://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFlAAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=v1YMAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1066,2673152 despite the two being bitter rivals. In 1999 the San Diego Chargers played their division rivals the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs in the preseason.http://www.profootballarchives.com/1999nflsd.html Since the league realignment in 2002, when the NFL began to have 32 teams, teams more than two time zones apart normally do not play each other, to save teams from long travelling times. However, there have been some exceptions. In 2009, the San Diego Chargers played the Atlanta Falcons in Atlanta. The San Francisco 49ers played the Baltimore Ravens in 2014, and the Los Angeles Rams played the Baltimore Ravens in 2018, both in Baltimore. The Arizona Cardinals, who are on the Pacific time zone during August, have played the New England Patriots in 2006, the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2006 and 2009, the Washington Redskins in 2010, and Atlanta Falcons in 2017. =Non-league opponents= The College All- Star Game, usually the first game of the preseason, was played annually in Chicago from 1934 to 1976 (except 1974), and featured the NFL (from 1966 World) champion against an all-rookie team of college all-stars. Between 1950 and 1961, the NFL also attempted exhibition matches against the Canadian Football League (mixing NFL and CFL rules), but these, too, were abandoned after the 1961 preseason, as the NFL won all six matchups. The CFL finally won a game against American opposition in August 1961, but this was against an American Football League team; as a result of the embarrassment, the AFL opted not to play the CFL again beyond that one game. From 1967 to 1969, during the transition period leading up to the formal AFL–NFL merger, the NFL and American Football League played each other in a series of exhibition matches; notably, the 1969 match between the Buffalo Bills and Washington Redskins was the only time Vince Lombardi ever lost to an AFL team.http://www.remembertheafl.com/AFLNFLexhibitions.htm The 1968 games were played under an experimental rule that eliminated extra point kicks and required a play from scrimmage to score one point (a rule later implemented by the World Football League in 1974 and the XFL in 2001). Games against non- league opponents were occasionally played after that time, usually with the NFL teams sending a rookie \\"split squad\\" to the game. In 1969, the Atlanta Falcons rookies defeated the Alabama Hawks of the Continental Football League 55–0, Note: The PFRA erroneously refers to this matchup as the last such contest. and in 1972, the New York Jets rookies defeated the Long Island Chiefs of the Seaboard Football League 29–3.\\"Hartford Gets Grid Franchise\\", Reading Eagle – May 31, 1972, p58 The Chiefs played an exhibition game against the New York Jets rookies on July 29, 1972, losing 29-3, \\"Packer Excels at Quarterback As Jets Top L.I. Chiefs, 29-3\\", New York Times, July 30, 1972, pS-3; \\"Rookie QB Fires Jets\\", Pittsburgh Press, July 30, 1972, pD-8 The 1976 All-Star Classic was the last game between an NFL team and a non-NFL team. This is in contrast to current practice in MLS, NBA, NHL and recent practice in baseball, in which teams play exhibition games against non-league teams. =Schedule= The exhibition season typically begins the first weekend of August with the Hall of Fame Game; though in some years it can be on the second weekend. Previous seasons have seen the American Bowl game held the last weekend of July. The first full schedule of exhibition games is held the following weekend. Most games are held on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday nights, with one nationally televised game each night of the week: NFL Network airs a Thursday game, CBS and Fox a Friday and Saturday night game each, NBC with Sunday night games, and ESPN a Monday night game. Unlike the regular season, CBS's and Fox's national exhibition game opponents are selected regardless of conference. Four full weekends of games are held. The fourth and final full week of exhibition games (fifth weekend overall) usually has teams playing exclusively on Thursday night (plus Friday, if any), with no national games. This allows teams a few extra days to prepare for the first week of the regular season. It also prevents conflict with the start of the regular seasons for high school and college football, allowing those venues to expand their first weekends' games from Thursday through Monday (Labor Day). There is usually a conflict with the Major League Baseball season, a situation seen in the 2015 preseason when the Pittsburgh Steelers moved a Sunday evening game against the Green Bay Packers at Heinz Field to a traditional 1 p.m. kickoff to avoid parking conflicts with the Pittsburgh Pirates across their shared lot at PNC Park, when the Pirates had a game moved to Sunday evening as part of ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball. On various occasions, severe weather or other factors, have postponed or outright canceled some preseason games. Due to their exhibition nature, suspended or canceled preseason games are normally not made up. In 2004, Hurricane Charley postponed a Tampa Bay game against Cincinnati from Saturday until Monday. In 2001, a preseason game between Philadelphia and Baltimore was canceled due to turf problems at Veterans Stadium.Game canceled because of turf problem Similar turf concerns prompted the league to cancel the 2016 Hall of Fame Game at the last minute. The 2017 Cowboys-Texans preseason game, originally scheduled for Houston, was at first switched to Arlington due to the flooding spawned by Hurricane Harvey in southeast Texas. The day prior to the scheduled game, it was cancelled to allow the Texans, who departed Houston the previous Friday to play at New Orleans and then were diverted to Dallas/Fort Worth after the game vs. the Saints, to return to Houston. International and neutral-site games Prior to the commencement of the NFL International Series, the NFL had another \\"featured\\" exhibition game called the American Bowl. This matchup was an extra exhibition game for the two teams involved and was often played on the same weekend as the Hall of Fame Game. It was played outside the United States, usually in Mexico or Japan. The American Bowl was held from 1986 to 2005; similar international matches had occurred regularly since 1969. In addition, teams previously played home games at stadiums on the fringes of their markets or in markets not currently served by NFL teams. The Alamodome in San Antonio hosted games in this fashion, as did Rogers Centre (as part of the Bills Toronto Series), with Camp Randall Stadium, the on-campus home of Wisconsin Badgers football in Madison, Wisconsin, hosting one preseason Green Bay Packers game per year until the late 1990s. The Citrus Bowl was previously a common venue for games. The Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York has been mentioned as a potential site for such a game, with the host team not yet mentioned.http://www.cnyradio.com/2009/04/21/galaxy-extends-su-sports-deal- through-2013/ In June 2019, the Green Bay Packers and Oakland Raiders announced that they would play a preseason game at Investors Group Field in Winnipeg, Manitoba, home of the Canadian Football League's Winnipeg Blue Bombers, on August 22, 2019. The game was originally proposed for Regina, Saskatchewan's Mosaic Stadium, but its CFL tenant rejected the proposal, fearing that they couldn't convert the field back to its Canadian football configuration (which uses a longer field than the NFL) in time for a game the next day. Due to the anchor points for the regular Canadian goalposts being within the NFL field and the concrete pad covering it being deemed a safety hazard by the teams, it was decided near game time to play the game on a reduced 80-yard field without kickoffs, making the 10 yard-line the actual goal line for the game (though field goals and PAT attempts were still allowed). Also in 2019, the Dallas Cowboys and Los Angeles Rams announced that they would play a preseason game at Aloha Stadium in Hawaii on August 17 (marking the first NFL game held there since the 2016 Pro Bowl). Television and radio While selected preseason games are televised nationally by the NFL's main broadcast partners (including, most prominently, the Hall of Fame Game, which has been part of the Sunday Night Football package outside of Summer Olympics years — where the game is usually aired by ESPN or NFL Network due to NBC's coverage of the Games), the majority of them are in-house productions of the individual teams, often in association with a local television broadcaster, regional sports network, or an outside producer such as Raycom Sports. Especially if a team's flagship station is affiliated with or owned by one of the NFL's network partners, rightsholders may also subcontract with their respective sports department or co-owned regional sports networks, such as CBS Sports (in the case of the Atlanta Falcons, whose flagship is CBS-owned The CW affiliate WUPA), Fox Sports Networks (in the case of the Detroit Lions, whose games are aired by WJBK and produced by then- sister Fox Sports Detroit), or NBC Sports (in the case of the New York Giants) to provide resources such as camera crews and graphics, or produce the entire broadcast, giving those networks their own ability to evaluate their production teams and the chemistry of network announcing teams before the season starts. Preseason broadcasts are typically syndicated to a network of stations within the team's market region, which also typically includes a package of team-produced programming throughout the season (such as analysis and coach's shows), local rights to games broadcast on cable, and the right to brand themselves as the \\"official\\" station of the team in the market. Exhibition games are almost exclusively played at night due to hot summer weather, and are frequently scheduled based on local convenience. When applicable, the NFL blackout restrictions apply, although stations are allowed to play the game on a tape delay if the game does not sell out (unlike the regular season policy, when rights revert to NFL Films). However, the blackout restrictions have never been applied since 2015 as a result of a passed vote during the league's owners' meeting in March in which the league, as an experiment because no regular season games in the 2014 season were blacked out and an FCC vote in September 2014 to no longer enforce blackouts, eliminated blackout rules for at least the last two seasons. Many more exhibition games fail to sell out than do regular-season games. Since 2015, Compass Media Networks carries select preseason contests involving the Las Vegas Raiders and Dallas Cowboys nationwide. Criticism Currently, every NFL team requires its season ticket holders to purchase tickets at full price for two exhibition games as a requirement to purchase regular-season tickets. Complaints regarding this policy have gone all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, but have failed to change the policy. A judgment in 1974 stated: \\"No fewer than five lawsuits have been instituted from Dallas to New England, each claiming that the respective National Football League (NFL) team had violated the Sherman Act by requiring an individual who wishes to purchase a season ticket for all regular season games to buy, in addition, tickets for one or more exhibition or preseason games.\\" Additionally, some players, coaches, and journalists, and numerous fans, object to the 4-week exhibition schedule. Players have little monetary incentive to play in exhibitions, since they are paid only a training-camp per diem for these games. Their salaries do not begin until the regular season, and thus they are essentially playing in exhibitions \\"for free\\". Regardless of these objections, owners continue to endorse the four-game exhibition season. The games are an easy source of revenue, and thus are unlikely to be dispensed within the foreseeable future. =Proposed reductions= In 2008, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell raised the possibility of shortening the exhibition season, in favor of lengthening the regular season. There was a possibility that by 2012, the league would switch to two primary exhibition games (down from 4) and an 18-game regular season (up from 16). Reasons cited were solutions to future labor concerns about revenue, and the overall dissatisfaction with the exhibitions among players and fans. Also, since the NFL is now widely considered a competitive year- round business, veteran players normally train and condition year round, and do not need the extensive exhibition season to get back into playing shape after the previous regular season. This proposal was eventually rejected in negotiations for the NFL Collective Bargaining Agreement, due to objections and concerns over fatigue and injuries raised by the National Football League Players Association. Another proposal said to be gaining \\"growing sentiment among NFL owners\\" as of 2016 is a proposal to eliminate the last preseason game and give a league-wide bye week leading into the regular season.Gaughan, Mark.

LongHorn Steakhouse is an American casual dining restaurant chain that is owned and operated by Darden Restaurants, Inc., headquartered in Orlando, Florida. As of 2016, LongHorn Steakhouse generated $1.6 billion in sales in its 481 locations. History LongHorn Steakhouse was founded in 1981 by George McKerrow, Jr. and his best friend Brian. McKerrow was a former manager at Quinn's Mill Restaurant, a subsidiary of Victoria Station, a San Francisco-based concept with railroad cars used as dining areas that was popular in the US during the 70's and 80's. The first location, originally called LongHorn Steaks Restaurant & Saloon, opened on Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. It was a former antique store, then an adult entertainment business. The walls were still painted black and some of the booths were divided by recycled black partitions. He filled it with steer heads and western paraphernalia. The LongHorn featured steaks grilled in a butter sauce. Sirloin steak and French fries from LongHorn Steakhouse It was across from a very popular restaurant, Harrison's on Peachtree. Harrison's was the favorite hangout of Atlanta Journal and Constitution columnist Ron Hudspeth and Lewis Grizzard. Hudspeth regularly featured quotes from \\"Pete the barkeep\\" at Harrison's. Harrison's had a very limited bar menu. So, regulars ventured over to the Longhorn for a steak after a night of drinking. However, in January 1982, a sudden snow storm that became known as SnowJam 82, trapped the area's commuter population within the city limits and McKerrow offered $1 drinks and menu specials to the stranded motorists. Hudspeth featured it in his column. This helped turn the struggling restaurant around. By 1990, the franchise expanded further south. It primarily has locations throughout the Eastern United States. It also has many locations in the Midwest, Southwest, and Puerto Rico. In August 2007, LongHorn Steakhouse, formerly owned and operated by RARE Hospitality International Inc., was purchased by Darden Restaurants, Inc. As of 2017, a new restaurant is being built in Riocentro El Dorado, the biggest shopping mall in Ecuador and one of the biggest in Latin America, located in the city of Guayaquil. Theme LongHorn Steakhouse has a Western/Texan theme. Each location is decorated with oil paintings, photos, and selected Western memorabilia that support this theme. A LongHorn Steakhouse in Savannah, Georgia Menu The restaurant is best known for serving various kinds of steak, including its \\"Flo's Filet\\". In addition to steak, the menu also includes ribs, chicken, salmon, lobster, shrimp, and salads. Appetizers include their \\"Texas Tonion\\" and \\"Wild West Shrimp\\"; and side dishes are also served. The restaurant offers a full bar with draft and bottled beer, wine, and several signature margaritas. A lunch menu that includes soups, salads, sandwiches, and hamburgers is available. =Doneness preference= According to research conducted between May 2016 - May 2017, 37.5 percent of diners preferred their steak done medium, 25.8 percent medium-well, 22.5 percent medium-rare, 11.7 percent well done, and only 2.5 percent preferred their steak to be rare.

He competed at the 1924 Winter Olympics and won the silver medal in the javelin throw in the 1928 Summer Olympics. He captured seven Hungarian Athletics Championships and three British Athletics Championships titles. Later Szepes had a successful career as a graphic artist, becoming an influential sports cartoonist in Hungary. Early life and sporting career Béla Szepes at the 1928 Summer Olympics Szepes was born in Igló, Austria- Hungary (today Spišská Nová Ves, Slovakia) in 1903 and began skiing by the Magyar Turista Egylet in 1918. Five years later he became the first ever Hungarian champion in ski jumping on a hill that was built by the jumpers themselves. He broke the Hungarian record in ski jumping six times during his career, having set his personal best in 1927 with 57 metres. At the 1924 Winter Olympics he participated in the 18 kilometre cross-country skiing event and in the Nordic combined but did not finish either of the races. Between 1919 and 1931 he was the athlete of Magyar Atétikai Club (MAC), competing in javelin throw. One of the most successful javelin thrower of his time, he won the Hungarian championships seven times in a row from 1925 to 1931. Szepes also set five national records during this period, having achieved his best in 1930 with 66.70 metres. He also regularly participated at the British Athletics Championships, winning the event on three occasions (1925, 1927, 1929). In 1928 he was present at the Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, where he came second behind Erik Lundqvist with 65.26 metres. Later life Szepes studied at the University of Arts and Design in Budapest. Following his graduation in 1926, Szepes moved to Berlin where he worked for several papers as a journalist and cartoonist. He returned to Hungary in 1933 and took a ski instructor job, was the coach of the Hungarian athletics team between 1938–1941 and also contributed to Nemzeti Sport (1933–1941) and later to Képes Sport (1941–1944) as a reporter and editor. After World War II he continued his career as a freelance graphic artist; his drawings and caricatures were published in Népsport, Ludas Matyi and Füles, and made a number of book illustrations. From the 1960s he turned to sculpting and designed sports awards and trophies. Among his notable works are the trophy of the Athletic European Cup made in 1965 and the Fair Play Award of West Germany from 1972. His creations were displayed in many cities around the globe, including Dresden, Munich, Rotterdam and Montreal. Szepes died in Budapest in 1986. His caricatures, graphics and posters are on display in the Physical Education and Sports Museum in Budapest, Hungary. Personal life Béla Szepes met his wife Mária in 1925, and the two were married on December 24, 1930. The couple had one son, who died when he was seven months old.

Typical brands carried include 7 for all Mankind, Juicy Couture, Dolce & Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, Gianfranco Ferré, Michael Kors, Zang Toi, Zac Posen, Lela Rose, St. John, Monique Lhuillier, and Burberry. It was founded in 1900; the original Gus Mayer department store was located on Canal Street in downtown New Orleans. At one time, there were more than 20 Gus Mayer stores across the Southeast and Southwest. The first Birmingham location opened in 1922 in the Retail Block behind the Molton Hotel on 5th Avenue North. Later the store was located at 2240 Highland Avenue in the Bottega Favorita location, now home to Bottega Restaurant & Cafe. Two years after the Brookwood Village mall opened in 1973 the store moved there. In 1975, when the stores were being sold off individually, the Pizitz family purchased the Birmingham operation and later added the Nashville location. These two are the only remaining Gus Mayer stores today. In 2002 the Colonial Brookwood Village store was relocated and expanded along with the renovations to the mall. Hambrecht Oleson Design Associates of New York designed the new store with local architects Crawford, McWilliams and Hatcher. The shoe salons at Gus Mayer, which include a full-line Stuart Weitzman boutique and a Cole Haan concept salon, are owned independently by David Kraselsky, who leases the store space. In 2010 the Gus Mayer at Colonial Brookwood Village made plans to move to The Summit as part of an updating of the store's merchandising strategy sometime around Valentine's Day, 2011.

The death of Charles II had been anticipated from his succession in 1665, but by 1697, it was clear to be imminent. As he was childless, the closest heirs were Austrian or French. The acquisition of an undivided Spanish Empire by either would change the European balance of power (see map). Negotiations took place immediately after the financially crippling 1689 to 1697 Nine Years' War to attempt to resolve the issue without another expensive war. Signed on 11 October 1698, it made the six-year-old Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria heir to the Spanish throne, with their European possessions divided between France and Austria. However, neither Austria or Spain were consulted, and the Spanish refused to accept the division of their empire. The death of Joseph Ferdinand in February 1699 led to the Second Partition Treaty, or Treaty of London, in March 1700. Background Charles II, 1665–1700; last Habsburg King of Spain In 1665, Charles II became the last Habsburg King of Spain. He suffered from ill-health most of his life and by 1697, he seemed likely to die childless. Although Spain's financial and military power had declined during the 17th century, the Spanish Empire remained powerful and largely intact, with territories in Italy, the Spanish Netherlands, the Philippines, and large areas of the Americas. Since the closest heirs were from the ruling Austrian Habsburg and French Bourbon families, the succession was of great significance to the European balance of power and a matter of debate for many years. From 1665, Louis XIV fought a series of wars to achieve defensible borders and establish French military supremacy in Europe, most recently the 1688–1697 Nine Years' War between France and the Grand Alliance. It ended with the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, while Louis accepted he could not achieve his objectives without support. While Charles had survived far longer than anyone expected, his health was clearly in terminal decline, and France needed allies. Louis' concern was increased by Austrian victories over the Ottoman Empire and resulting conquest of Hungary and Transylvania. The resulting growth in Habsburg power and confidence meant Emperor Leopold I initially refused to sign the Treaty of Ryswick, as it left the succession unresolved. He did so in October 1697, but many viewed it only as a pause in hostilities. Negotiations Maria Antonia (1669–1692), Electress of Bavaria and heir to the Spanish throne (1669–1692); mother of Joseph Ferdinand Unlike Austria and France, the Crown of Spain could be inherited through the female line, enabling Charles' two sisters to pass their rights onto their children. Each had one surviving child; his half sister Maria Theresa (1638–83) married Louis XIV and had a son, Louis, le Grand Dauphin. His full sister Margaret Theresa (1651–1673) married Emperor Leopold; their daughter Maria Antonia (1669–1692) married Maximillian Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria and they had one surviving son, Joseph Ferdinand. The Spanish political establishment was split between pro-Austrian and pro-French factions. For most of Charles' reign, government was controlled by the 'Austrians', led by his mother Mariana of Austria. After her death in 1696, this role was assumed by his wife Maria Anna, whose elder sister Eleonore was Emperor Leopold's third wife. When Charles fell seriously ill in 1698, the dominance of the Austrian faction made co-operation with Britain an attractive option for Louis. William III was a significant figure in Europe because of his military leadership of the Grand Alliance during the Nine Years' War, and his dual role as King of England and Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic. The conflict was not only a dynastic dispute between Habsburgs and Bourbons, but also an issue affecting the security of England and the Dutch Republic. The French army remained on a war footing, but by 1699, the English military had been reduced to 7,000, with another 12,000 in Ireland. That made a diplomatic solution attractive to William, even if it was only temporary, and it provided an opportunity to create a framework for a lasting peace. Talks on ending the Nine Years' War began in 1694, but were only completed in 1697, after Louis negotiated directly with William. As a result, they placed great faith in a similar process to prevent war over the succession, but it excluded Austria and Spain, the two parties most affected. Initial discussions were held in Paris between the Earl of Portland and the Marquis de Pomponne, followed by more substantive talks at The Hague beginning in May with Anthonie Heinsius, Grand Pensionary of Holland, and the French foreign minister, the duc de Tallard. On 11 October 1698, the treaty was signed by Tallard on behalf of France, Portland for England, and eight representatives from the Dutch Provinces. Provisions The Earl of Portland (1649–1709); William's chief envoy in France Louis XIV first proposed his son, the Grand Dauphin, as Charles' successor, but that was rejected. The parties compromised by selecting Joseph Ferdinand of Bavaria. This was supported by Charles' German wife, Maria Anna, a member of the Wittelsbach family, whose head was Max Emmanuel of Bavaria, Joseph Ferdinand's father. The provisions of the Treaty made Joseph Ferdinand heir to the bulk of the Spanish Monarchy, which included the Spanish Netherlands, currently governed by Max Emmanuel as Spanish Viceroy. France was allocated the Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily and other concessions in Italy plus the modern Basque province of Gipuzkoa. Finally, Leopold's younger son Archduke Charles became ruler of the Duchy of Milan, a possession considered vital to the security of Austria's southern border. Negotiations were conducted in secret, normal practice for the absolutist regime of Louis XIV, but not in England. The senior English legal officer, Lord Chancellor Somers, learned of its terms shortly before the treaty was signed on 11 October. His reaction was unfavourable, but since it had been agreed, he could see no means of undoing it. Marquis de Pomponne (1618–1699), chief French negotiator Aftermath The Spanish refused to have their Empire divided without being consulted, and on 14 November 1698, Charles II published his will, making Joseph Ferdinand heir to an independent and undivided Spanish Monarchy. Maria Anna was appointed Queen Regent during his minority, an announcement allegedly received by his Spanish councillors in silence. In February 1699, Joseph Ferdinand died of smallpox, a common disease of the period, despite the accusations of poison that often accompanied the death of significant people. Whether he would have become king had he survived is open to question, since few seemed keen on the treaty. One suggestion is Louis saw it as a delaying tactic, in order to build Spanish support for a French candidate. However, the three parties involved began negotiating the Second Partition Treaty, also known as the Treaty of London.

In the course of a recent revitalization effort, called \\"Youngstown 2010\\", the original Fosterville neighborhood has been subdivided into two distinct neighborhood areas: Idora and Warren.  History  Once a farm owned by the L. T. Foster family (located at the present-day location where Indianola Avenue and Canfield Road meet Glenwood Avenue) this area once had one of the most coal mines in the country. Many of the other south-side Youngstown neighborhoods had coal mines, but the coal from the Fosterville mine was so prized that it won a gold medal at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The last mine was closed in 1915 when all of the coal was extracted. The neighborhood converted from farmland to residential housing in the early 1900s. This occurred due to the introduction of the new South Side trolley-car line in 1899 (owned by the Youngstown Park and Falls Street Railway Company). The line ran out of downtown Youngstown to the South Side's Fosterville neighborhood near Mill Creek Park and Lanterman's Mill. People were encouraged to use the new trolley line when the railway company built an amusement park (opening 1899) at end of the trolley line. The urban amusement park, Idora Park, was located in the north-western portion of the Fosterville neighborhood and encouraged the growth of residential housing. The Volney Road section of this neighborhood, bordering Idora Park, was developed by the wealthy. Housing developed closer to Glenwood Avenue was almost entirely upper-middle-class. Fosterville's Idora Park closed in 1984, yet had long outlived the trolley-line that stopped operations many years earlier. The urban renewal plans of Youngstown 2010 call for this former amusement park land to remain as vacant green-space and part of the citywide green network. Although Youngstown's economic downturn in the 1970s and suburban flight directly impacted the Fosterville neighborhood, it was Idora Park's closing that was the death knell for many of the South Side businesses. The geographic location of Fosterville positioned the neighborhood to be a grand thoroughfare to the many entrances of Mill Creek Park such as Old Furnace Road. Lake Glacier was a primary getaway spot for generations. The Fosterville neighborhood saw the closing of many long-lived businesses in the 1980s: Parker's Frozen Custard, JB's Lounge, the Crystal Lounge, Mr. Paul's Bakery, Isaly's Dairy, Foster Theater, Sparkle's Supermarket and the Park Inn. Nested in the middle of Fosterville was The Youngstown Playhouse, Chicago Street Athletic Field which saw its heyday with the school-aged baby boom of the 1960s, and the historical Fosterville postal substation. The historical residents of Fosterville maintained what was known as 'land covenants' in an effort to prevent the influx of non-white immigrating citizens from disturbing the neighborhood's planned integrity as had been maintained with the return of World War II veterans who settled in the neighborhood post-1930s. The architecture of the neighborhoods from the 1930s to 1960 is prevalent in the older existing homes - what few remain. Enclosed porches and coal chutes to cellar spaces beneath the homes were prevalent qualities. Rounded Dutch barn- shaped three story homes were commonplace. The texture of the post-war generation is evident between Hillman Street and Glenwood Avenue and Willis bordering on the north and Indianola to the south.  Summary of coal mines  Summary of productive mines in the Fosterville neighborhood: * Foster No.1 Mine (1873-1884) operated by the Foster Coal Company; produced 400 tons/day and was the most productive of all South Side Youngstown mines; original entrance located just east of current home at 537 Hylda Street; shaft currently capped with concrete with reinforced one-inch steel bars. * Foster No.2 Mine (1885-1887) operated by the Foster Coal Company; produced a total of 40,000 tons; original entrance located at the present-day southwest corner of Glenwood Ave. and Parkway; shaft currently covered with concrete.

History Prior to their second album on Capitol, Bunnell and Beckley amicably parted ways with George Martin in an effort to try a new musical direction. For the new album, the group utilized two producers -- Matthew McCauley and Fred Mollin. While Silent Letter was recorded by Bunnell, Beckley and their backing band (Willie Leacox, Michael Woods, David Dickey and Jim Calire), Alibi was a virtual roll-call of the burgeoning West Coast music scene. The recording included musicians such as Timothy B. Schmit, Waddy Wachtel, Mike Baird, Lee Sklar, Richard Page, Norton Buffalo and Steve Lukather. Alibi, released in August 1980, was the second America album not to feature a picture of the band members on the cover. (The first was a Kauai sunset photo on \\"Harbor,\\" where that album was recorded.) Instead, the cover sported a picture of a doll's head in the foreground of a desert landscape. Dewey Bunnell said he chose the picture while looking through the archives of acclaimed photographer Henry Diltz. The album was also unusual in the era of vinyl primacy in that it did not have numbered sides. Because the group and Capitol disagreed on which side would be side one, they agreed on a compromise: the sides would be labelled \\"Our Side\\" and \\"Their Side.\\" The album only peaked at number 142 on the Billboard album chart in the US. No singles charted in the US, but in Italy \\"Survival\\" was a top 5 hit and the whole album peaked at 2: this happened only on the first weeks of 1982, after the band took part, as special guest, at the Sanremo Music Festival. This album, had its release fallen during the Warner Bros years, could have been a huge success. It has several solid fast and slow songs and displayed the broad talents of America. Along with \\"Survival\\", \\"Might Be Your Love\\", \\"Hangover\\", \\"Valentine\\" and \\"I Do Believe in You\\" were catchy and rockier songs that certainly deserved airplay; \\"Hangover\\" did receive airplay on many FM stations. America may have chosen the wrong single to be released on this album. The unusual album cover design, along with a new band logo, may have been a factor in the disappointing sales. Their follow up release would return to more traditional art direction, including the use of their classic logo. Although Alibi was yet another commercial disappointment for America, the band's fortunes would dramatically improve with their next album, View From The Ground (1982), which included the Top Ten smash, \\"You Can Do Magic.\\" McCauley would later produce several tracks on America's Perspective album in 1984, while Mollin returned in 2011 to produce America's cover album, Back Pages. Reception In his Allmusic retrospective review, music critic Steven Thomas Erlewine summarized that \\"Essentially, the album picks up where Silent Letter left off, meaning that it's a set of pleasant soft pop, but it's slicker and slighter than its predecessor.\\" He criticized the album's uneven content and thin production, holding up its successor, View from the Ground, as a superior work in the same vein.

History of the partnership In 1953, David Crystal, the owner of Izod and Haymaker, bought 50% of the rights to market Lacoste in America. The \\"Izod\\" and \\"Haymaker\\" brands were already established there. \\"Lacoste\\" was added to enhance the brands' prestige and introduce the name to American markets. The resulting union of the two companies was the piqué polo/tennis shirt. When the shirts began to sell well, Crystal decided to keep the combined names. The brand hit its peak popularity in the late '70s and early '80s when the \\"preppy\\" look became mainstream, with many nationwide department stores featuring separate \\"Izod/Lacoste\\" shops, with jackets, sweaters and a wide variety of other apparel. During this period annual sales reached $150 million for the shirts alone. =Decline= The \\"preppy\\" trend cooled in the late 1980s and the brand became overexposed. The market was also saturated with knock-off replicas. The name was split in the early 1990s when Crystal sought to expand company sales. Lacoste moved upmarket in an attempt to recapture its \\"elite\\" status. Meanwhile, Izod was re-introduced as mid-range apparel. While this tactic worked for a short period, it could not support Crystal's company, which was heavily in debt due to poor investments in other brands such as Salty Dog and Gant. The marketing license was ended in the mid-1990s after his company became too financially burdened. In 1993, he sold his 50% share of Lacoste to Sportloisirs S.A. (who originally marketed the shirt in France). When the company folded shortly thereafter, Izod was sold to the shirtmaker Van Heusen. Today Izod and Lacoste both continue to produce similar piqué polo shirts and are often mistakenly believed to be the same company. Lacoste polo shirts have the crocodile logo, while Izod has a monogram crest. Izod has had a number of re-positionings in the market place (its current image being mid-range preppy and performance apparel). Lacoste has only recently become available again in the United States, though its current positioning remains entirely upscale. Both brands continue to be popular.

The curriculum was based on the Scottish education system. The school was one of three all-girls, private, fee-paying schools based in the Edinburgh district. The school was a private boarding school to cater for students staying from home was offered and often housed a small group of students. The school competed alongside other female-dominated private schools in the country. History =Foundation and early years: 1890–1897= St. Margaret's was founded in 1890 by James Buchanan. Buchanan housed his fledgling school in two identical specifically designed buildings, one on East Suffolk Road in Newington, the other on Egypt Terrace (now part of Cluny Drive) in Morningside. The total cost of both buildings was £6,000.Patrick, L.M.D. & Bowie, J.L.F.: Fortiter Vivamus. Mainstream Publishing. . This equates to about £54,000 in today's money. The school was named after Saint Margaret of Scotland. Buchanan initially named his new school The Queen Margaret College for Young Ladies. The inclusion of the word College in the name was to emphasise that secondary education was available. Prior to the school's opening on 1 October 1890, Buchanan had placed daily adverts in The Scotsman'; giving out handbills to local businesses and creating a prospectus for parents. The result of this work was an opening roll of over 200. Though the two schools were separate in some respects (each had its own headmistress), girls and staff knew each other well and often commuted between the two campuses. Buchanan was Principal of both schools and taught English. =The reign of Annie Buchanan and the sale of the schools 1897–1929= As James Buchanan had died shortly before the new term was to begin, swift action was required. He had left a trust for the school, and that combined with his life insurance payout provided for the support of his wife and children (who would have otherwise had no income) and paid off much of the loan on the school's two buildings. His wife, Annie Custance Buchanan (née Carr) was appointed as Principal and, despite having a young family to look after, threw herself into the role. She remained in the post for over 30 years. During Annie Buchanan's principalship, St. Margaret's went from strength to strength. In 1903, the school was the first independent school in Edinburgh to offer a \\"Leaving Certificate\\" (the equivalent of today's Standard Grade and Higher qualifications). In 1904, the school began Fröbel training for staff, another first for the city. In December 1903, a fire broke out at the East Suffolk Road building. There was a considerable amount of damage and girls had to be taught temporarily at the Livingstone Halls on Clerk Street (now a video rental shop). In 1914, the Territorial Army requisitioned Mrs Buchanan's office for a period. In 1926, Annie Buchanan sold the Morningside school to Miss Muirhead, who renamed it St. Hilary's. In 1929, she sold the Newington school to Miss Matthew, who decided to keep the name St. Margaret's (a decision that much pleased Mrs Buchanan). =Miss Matthew, World War Two and Independence 1929–1960= Prior to buying the school and taking on the role as Principal, Miss Matthew was already established at St. Margaret's, being a Housemistress and a teacher of Latin. It was she who came up with the school's motto, Fortiter Vivamus, which translates from Latin as Let us Live Bravely. Matthew House, finished in 1972 and named after Miss Matthew The Second World War meant that most of St. Margaret's, like many other schools, had to leave Edinburgh. From the academic year 1939/40 all the boarders and many of the day girls decamped to Strathtay. The school moved to Dunkeld seven months later then to Auchterarder in July 1944. When the war finished in 1945, there was no longer enough space to house all the pupils at East Suffolk road. As such, the division of the school continued until 1956. The school celebrated its Diamond Jubilee in 1950. In 1960, Miss Matthew decided to transfer the school from private ownership to a Company Limited by Guarantee, to be administered by a Board of Governors. This came into effect on 1 January 1961, and the school became an independent fee-paying school for upper-class families based in Scotland. =New buildings, a new badge and the centenary 1961–1990= This period brought many changes to the school buildings, with the acquisition of Craigmillar House in 1962, Craigmillar Park Church in 1965 (now Buchanan House), Senior College in 1983 and Muirhead House in 1984. The building of Matthew House was completed in 1972, and extensive refurbishment work was carried out on the Pavilion and the science laboratories. Buchanan House, showing Buchanan Hall and the Round Hall In 1965 the school celebrated its 75th anniversary, and to commemorate this the daughters of Mr and Mrs Buchanan donated a plaque. In 1967 a Clothing Exchange which enabled the purchase of second-hand uniform was established, and continued until the closure of the school. In 1983, St. Hilary's merged with St. Margaret's, reuniting the two schools. The merger necessitated a new school badge. The badge is lozenge-shaped, and has the cross of St. Margaret surrounded by four martlets on the upper half, and the cedar tree of St. Hilary's on the lower half. In 1990, the school celebrated its centenary. Several events took place throughout the year to commemorate this anniversary. One such event was a special trip in conjunction with the Forth Bridge (also celebrating its centenary) – girls (escorted by a piper) boarded a steam train bound for Dunfermline, where they visited St. Margaret's grave at Dunfermline Abbey. =St. Margaret's 1991–2010= One of St. Margaret's newest buildings In 1998, the school merged with another independent girls' school, St. Denis and Cranley. There were several changes in the buildings that housed the school, with Senior College, Maclean House and Muirhead House all being sold, and new buildings built and acquired closer to East Suffolk Road. =Closure= It was announced on 10 June 2010 that the school would close due to low pupil numbers owing to an increase in coeducational private schools. Music St. Margaret's had a strong musical tradition, and in 1984 the school choir won in the Youth Choir section.

It extends for from an intersection with NY 43 in the Sand Lake hamlet of West Sand Lake to a junction with NY 2 in the Brunswick hamlet of Cropseyville. The portion of NY 351 north of the hamlet of Poestenkill was originally designated as New York State Route 153 in the 1930s. This designation was removed in the 1940s, and the West Sand Lake–Cropseyville roadway became County Route 77 (CR 77) sometime afterward. On April 1, 1980, all of CR 77 was transferred to the state of New York, at which time it was redesignated as NY 351 by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). Route description View north along NY 351 at NY 43 in Sand Lake NY 351 begins approximately east of the hamlet of West Sand Lake at an intersection with NY 43\\\\. It initially heads northeastward through the town of Sand Lake as a two-lane highway named Reichard Lake Road, passing through a residential yet wooded area in the vicinity of Racquet Lake. The woods eventually overtake the homes as the route heads away from the lake and into the town of Poestenkill; however, NY 351 quickly enters another residential area based around the route's junction with NY 66\\\\. Just west of the intersection is Algonquin Middle School, part of the Averill Park Central School District. Past NY 66, NY 351 changes names to Round Top Road and heads into an isolated part of Poestenkill, passing through a mixture of forests and sparsely developed open areas as it meanders northward. After of little to no development, NY 351 enters the hamlet of Poestenkill, the northernmost community of significance along the route. In the center of the community, it intersects NY 355 at an all-way stop intersection. The junction was originally the eastern terminus of NY 154; however, that route was eliminated as part of a highway maintenance swap in 1980 that ultimately created NY 351. The route continues north from Poestenkill as White Church Road, winding its way through the open and hilly terrain of the northern part of the town. The terrain's complexion remains the same in the adjacent town of Brunswick, where the highway changes names to Farm to Market Road. In Brunswick, NY 351 serves only a handful of homes before it terminates at a junction with NY 2 in the hamlet of Cropseyville. The Brunswick Central School District's Tamarac Secondary School is a short distance to the west on NY 2. History The segment of modern NY 351 north of the hamlet of Poestenkill was originally designated as NY 153 . This designation was removed in the early 1940s. All of former NY 153 was later incorporated into CR 77, a county route maintained by Rensselaer County that extended from the hamlet of West Sand Lake to the hamlet of Cropseyville via Postenkill. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of all of CR 77 was transferred from Rensselaer County to the state of New York as part of a county-wide highway maintenance swap.

Thus, Zavolzhye—the region in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast—normally refers to its forested and sparsely populated northeastern half.

He lived in Vienna from 1808 to 1824, then in Paris to 1840, during which time he was among the city's most prominent pianists and composers, although he is almost entirely forgotten nowadays. Biography He was the son of Friedrich Wilhelm Pixis (1755-1805), who in 1790 followed his own father to become Preceptor and Organist at the Evangelical Reformed Church.Österreichisches Musiklexikon online, \\"Pixis family.\\" Accessed 4 February 2018. Johann Peter's older brother, also Friedrich Wilhelm Pixis (1785-1842), was a violinist who later became prominent in the musical life of Prague.Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, vol. 3 (1907), p. 773. The two brothers received early musical training from their father, who took the talented boys on concert tours beginning in 1797; they traveled through Germany and to Denmark, Russia (St. Petersburg), and Poland (Warsaw). During the tour, the older brother also played piano duets with Johann Peter, who in turn accompanied his brother on the cello and violin. While in Hamburg in 1798, Viotti was so impressed by Friedrich Wilhelm junior that he gave daily lessons, which Johann Peter also attended, for two months, and he organized a concert for the two boys.Robert Batka, \\"Aus Joh. Peter Pixis Memoiren,\\" in Kranz: Gesammelte Blätter über Musik (Leipzig 1903), pp. 87-88. Friedrich Wilhelm senior moved his family to Vienna in 1806. The brothers gave a series of very successful concerts in Karlsbad and Prague in 1807, during which Johann Peter began to perform his own compositions. From 1808, the brothers were with their family in Vienna. Both studied composition under Johann Georg Albrechtsberger and made contact with the city's music professionals. Friedrich Wilhelm junior moved to Prague in 1810, while Johann Peter settled in Vienna, where he had contact with, among many others, Beethoven and Schubert. In 1814-15, he met Giacomo Meyerbeer, who was in Vienna to study with Antonio Salieri. In his memoirs, Pixis writes about his friendship with Meyerbeer: Pixis also writes in glowing terms about the Vienna premiere of Carl Maria von Weber's Der Freischütz, and he relates a story about Henriette Sontag when she first arrived in Vienna as a young student: Pixis says that he split the cost of voice and Italian lessons with her, to enable her to afford them.Batka, p. 98 (translated). Eventually, during his final years in Vienna, Pixis tried to establish himself as an opera composer, but with little success. Cover of the vocal score for Meyerbeer, Robert le diable, with piano reduction by Pixis (1831). Perhaps as a result of his early experiences with his brother, Pixis was an excellent collaborative pianist and toured with several violinists, including concerts in Paris, where he moved in late 1824. During this period Paris saw an influx of foreign musicians, especially pianists from Germanophone countries, a process that had already started in the 1790s, shortly after the founding of the Paris Conservatoire. The pianists included Friedrich Kalkbrenner (in 1799), Jan Ladislav Dussek (1807), Henri Herz (1816), Franz Hünten (1819), Franz Liszt (1823), Frédéric Chopin (1831), Sigismond Thalberg (1836), as well as Stephen Heller, Ferdinand Hiller, and others.Leon Plantinga, \\"Paris after Napoleon: Hub for Europe's Pianists,\\" in Massimiliano Sala, ed., Piano Culture in 19th-century Paris (2015), p. 3. Pixis stayed, living in Paris for twenty years and quickly earning a strong reputation as a composer, concert pianist, and chamber music collaborator. At the height of his career, around 1830, he was regarded as one of the best pianists of his time. According to Chopin, it was Pixis who introduced him to the publisher Schlesinger, whose request for a composition on Meyerbeer's \\"Robert\\" eventually resulted in the Grand duo concertant sur des thèmes de Robert le diable, B.70, published in 1832.Frédéric Chopin, Chopin's Letters, translated by E. L. Voynich, New York, 1931, p. 159. Pixis himself made the piano reduction for the opera's vocal score (1831) and he wrote two original compositions: Caprice dramatique sur 'Robert le diable', Op. 116, and Variations sur le Quatuor de Robert le diable, Op. 117. All of these were also published by Schlesinger. Pixis, Three German Airs, title page. Sung in London by his adopted daughter Francilla. While in Paris, Pixis trained his adopted daughter Francilla Pixis (1816-1888), who became a well-known singer; her recital appearances were accompanied by Pixis himself.Österreichisches Musiklexikon. \\" Pixis, Familie\\". Retrieved 7 February 2016 In 1840, Pixis's compositional and performance career largely behind him, he moved to Baden Baden. In 1843, Francilla married and not long after that retired from the stage. Pixis then turned his attention to the musical training of his nephew Theodor Pixis (1831-1856), who subsequently became concertmaster in Cologne and instructor in the Rheinische Musikschule but died suddenly.Lucian Schiwietz, Johann Peter Pixis, Frankfurt/M., Berlin, Bern, 1994, p. 331. Johann Peter Pixis continued to teach the piano until his death in 1874. Works The opus numbers of Pixis's published works run to about 150,151 according to Franz Pazdirek, Universal Handbook of Musical Literature: Practical and Complete Guide to all Musical Publications (Vienna, 1904?; reprint London and Philadelphia), vol. 14, p. 394. a total not unusual for the era, and include compositions in a variety of genres but especially chamber music, as well as music for piano solo and piano four-hands. The strongest of his multi-movement concert works are the seven piano trios, published between 1825 (Trio no. 1, Op. 75) and 1845 (Trio no. 7, Op. 147). While still in Vienna, Pixis was asked to join the collaborative work (involving 51 composers from 1819–1823) Vaterländischer Künstlerverein, an anthology of variations on a waltz by Anton Diabelli, which also included Ludwig van Beethoven's Diabelli Variations. In Paris in 1837, Pixis was involved with the composition of Hexaméron (six composers contributed; the third variation on Bellini's theme is by Pixis). The fact that he was asked by Liszt to participate, along with Chopin, Czerny, Herz, and Thalberg, is evidence of his status in Parisian musical circles.Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2d edition, vol. 3 (1907), p. 773. Ferdinand Hiller dedicated his 3 Caprices ou Etudes Caracteristiques, Op. 4 (1829) to Pixis.

Luni marble, Roman artwork of the period of the Second Triumvirate (43 BC). The archeological area of Luna. Luni is a comune (municipality) in the province of La Spezia, in the easternmost end of the Liguria region of northern Italy. It was founded by the Romans as Luna. It gives its name to Lunigiana, a region spanning eastern Liguria and northern Tuscany (province of Massa-Carrara). The commune was known as Ortonovo (from the name of one of its current frazioni) until April 2017. It is now named after the frazione of Luni. Geography Located in a plain near the Tyrrhenian Sea and close to the borders with Tuscany, Luni is crossed by the river Magra and lies between Sarzana (7 km in north) and Carrara (5 km in south). It is 4 km far from Ortonovo, 15 from Massa and 30 from La Spezia. The village is served by the National Highway 1 \\"Aurelia\\", crossed at Luni Mare by the A12 motorway and counts a railway station on the Pisa-Genoa line. History =Classical Period= Luna was the frontier town of Etruria, on the left bank of the river Macra (now Magra), the boundary in imperial times between Etruria and Liguria.The modern coastline of the Portus Lunae noted by Strabo is now two km distant. When the Romans first appeared in these parts, Etruscans and the Ligurians were already in possession of the territory.Livy 41.13.4 The Roman city was established in 177 BC by Publius Aelius, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Gnaeus SiciniusInscriptions at Luna attest to the cult of the moon goddess Luna It was a military stronghold for the campaigns against the Ligures. An inscription of 155 BC, found in the forum of Luna in 1851, was dedicated to M. Claudius Marcellus in honor of his triumph over the Ligurians and Apuani. In 109 BC it was connected to Rome by the Via Aemilia Scauri, rebuilt in the 2nd century AD as the Via Aurelia. It flourished when exploitation of white marble quarries in the nearby Alpi Apuane and neighboring mountains of Carrara, which in ancient times bore the name of Luna marble.. Pliny speaks of the quarries as only recently discovered in his day; they were soon owned by the imperial family. Pliny the Elder considered the big wheels of cheese from Luna the best in Etruria. Good wine was also produced. Ancient harbour Luni derived its importance mainly from its harbour,Pliny NH 3.8; Strabo 5.2.5 which was on a gulf of the Tyrrhenian Sea now known as the Gulf of La Spezia, and not merely the estuary of the Macra as some authors supposed.Strabo 5.2.51911 Encyclopædia Britannica While the town was apparently not established until 177 BC, when a colony of 2000 Roman citizens was founded there, the harbour is mentioned by Ennius, who sailed from there to Sardinia in 205 BC under Manlius Torquatus. It was also being contested by the Romans as early as 195 BC, when they were fighting the Ligurians and Apuans in the area. The site was used as a base for the quarrying of marble from the quarries of modern-day Carrara,Strabo 5.2.5, as the marble in that quarry is fine, and the harbour allowed the marble to be shipped to Rome easily. =Late antiquity= In the 5th century, it was still notable, as it was chosen as the seat of a bishopric. Captured by the Goths in the following century, it was reconquered by the Byzantines in 552, who however lost it to the Lombards in 642. The latter damaged the city's economy, favouring the trades routes that passed through the nearby port of Lucca to the south. Luni had been reduced to a small village by the time of the Lombard king Liutprand. Later, it was a countship and see under Charlemagne, exactly on the border between the Kingdom of Italy and the Papal States. =Middle Ages= It was repeatedly sacked by sea pirates, Saracens in 849 and Vikings who settled in 860 name=\\"CELESIA E 1847\\". Luna is supposed to have been mistakenly sacked by the Viking leader Björn Järnsida, who thought it was Rome. He tricked his way in by pretending to be a dying Christian convert. The 9th-century Bishop Saint Ceccardo, believed to have been martyred by the Vikings, is celebrated on June 16. In the mid-10th century it experienced the last period of splendour under count Oberto I, who was lord of the whole Ligurian Mark, and momentarily repulsed the pirate threat. However, in the 990s the situation worsened again, and the episcopal see was moved, first to Carrara then, definitively, to Sarzana in 1207 (or 1204). In 1015 Luna was conquered by the Andalusian emir of Denia, Mujāhid, with his Sardinian ships: when Pisa and Genoa beat back his forces, Luni was left destroyed. The spreading of malaria in the area and the silting up of the port contributed to the steep decline of Luni. In 1058 the whole population moved to Sarzana, while other refugees founded Ortonovo and Nicola. The title of bishop and count of Luni remained in use for various centuries, but Petrarch noted Luni as \\"once famous and powerful and now only a naked and useless name\\". It was only in 1442 that the highly visible remains were identified with Luni and the Gulf of La Spezia recognized as its harbour.Giacomo Bracelli, Descriptio orae ligusticae, noted by Roberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity 1969:111. The depredation of the Roman ruins of Luni aroused the concern of the local Cardinal Filippo Calandrini, who urged the Humanist pope Pius II to issue a brief (7 April 1461) forbidding any further dilapidations. It was of little practical use: when the Palazzo del Commune of Sarzana was constructed in 1471 dressed stone from Luni supplied a considerable part of the building material.Roberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford: Blackwell) 1969:112. In 1510 the city council of Sarzana made a gift to the French governor at Genoa of a marble triton found at Luni.Weiss 1969:114. Archaeological excavations Luni was excavated in the 1970s and many of the material brought to light is now housed in the adjacent museum (). Archeological evidence suggests that the Roman forum had been abandoned as a public space by the end of the sixth century CE, its buildings fell to ruin or were demolished and decorative marbles removed. Remains of small wooden houses were found in the space previously occupied by the forum.Ward-Perkins, B. (1997) \\"Continuitists, catastrophists, and the towns of post-Roman Northern Italy\\", Papers of the British School at Rome, Vol. 65, pp. 157-176. A theatre and an amphitheatre may still be distinguished on the site. No Etruscan remains have come to light. Cuntz's investigations (Jahreshefte des Osterr. Arch. Instituts, 1904, 46) seem to lead to the conclusion that an ancient road crossed the Apennines from it, following the line of the modern road (more or less that of the modern railway from Sarzana to Parma), and dividing near Pontremoli, one branch going to Borgotaro, Veleia and Placentia, and the other over the Cisa pass to Forum Novum (Fornovo) and Parma.

Stone marker  History  The Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal was built under an Act of Parliament of 1793. The Act allowed the canal company to build feeder railways up to in length to transport freight to the canal for transshipment. The Bryn Oer Tramway was built under this act in 1814, opening in 1815. It was a horse- worked plateway that served the Bryn Oer collieries and the limestone quarries at Trefil, dropping along its route to the canal at Talybont-on-Usk. An extension was built to serve the Rhymney ironworks in the Rhymney Valley. By the 1830s the growth of local railways had begun to complete with the tramway, especially with the introduction of steam locomotives that were too heavy to work on the fragile plateway. By 1860 most of the tramway's traffic was being sent by railways and it closed in 1865.http://brinore-tramroad.powys.org.uk/  The tramway today  In 2006 much of the route of the tramway is in use as a public bridleway for walkers, horseriders and mountain-bikers, and stone sleepers remain in place in several places.

He first worked as a patrolman, and eventually rose through the ranks to become a Lieutenant, followed by an assignment as a detective squad commander. Caunitz wrote with great authenticity when describing precinct day-to-day life in his novels. The New York Times has compared him to Joseph Wambaugh. After many rewrites, his first novel One Police Plaza came out in 1984. It was made into a television film starring Robert Conrad in 1986. In 1988 the film got a sequel, The Red Spider. His novels usually center around one or two police officers that follow detailed police procedures to solve a crime, and he also used some sensational elements of thrillers. He did not write with an outline, preferring to let the plot evolve unpredictably as he was writing. Caunitz died in 1996 from pulmonary fibrosis His last novel, Chains of Command, was half-completed at the time of his death and finished by Christopher Newman.

Smith announced Cohen's appointment for the 2013-2014 legislative session as Democratic Chairman of the Pennsylvania House State Government Committee. In 2016, Cohen lost the Democratic primary for his House seat to Jared Solomon, a community organizer. Solomon had challenged Cohen in 2014, coming within 158 votes of unseating him. Cohen's alleged misuse of the per diem system had become increasingly controversial in Philadelphia, and Solomon used the issue to attack him. The 2016 rematch between Solomon and Cohen was notably acrid. One article suggested that Cohen's operatives had stolen Solomon's garbage in order to find embarrassing information. Cohen sued Solomon for libel over a flier that suggested that Cohen had \\"bought a second home in Harrisburg and billed us $30,000 for it,\\" though Solomon argued that the allegation was truthful. Notably, Representative Brian Sims, who served on the State Government Committee with Cohen, endorsed Solomon, writing, \\"I don’t hate Mark Cohen but his behavior in the Capitol has been one of the most shocking surprises of my time there. Virtually every single person in the Capital has a story about Mark being lost in a bathroom or arguing with the plants or with the pictures on the wall.\\" Cohen responded that he had \\"a nearly 100% attendance record on the House floor.\\" Cohen lost the election by a large margin, receiving 43 percent of the vote to nearly 57 percent for Solomon.

The late 18th and early 19th century was a time of rapid and dramatic changes in ideas about the history of life on earth. The history of paleontology traces the history of the effort to understand the history of life on Earth by studying the fossil record left behind by living organisms. Since it is concerned with understanding living organisms of the past, paleontology can be considered to be a field of biology, but its historical development has been closely tied to geology and the effort to understand the history of Earth itself. In ancient times, Xenophanes (570–480 BC), Herodotus (484–425 BC), Eratosthenes (276–194 BC), and Strabo (64 BC-24 AD) wrote about fossils of marine organisms, indicating that land was once under water. The ancient Chinese considered them to be dragon bones and documented them as such. During the Middle Ages, fossils were discussed by Persian naturalist Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in Europe) in The Book of Healing (1027), which proposed a theory of petrifying fluids that Albert of Saxony would elaborate on in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) would propose a theory of climate change based on evidence from petrified bamboo. In early modern Europe, the systematic study of fossils emerged as an integral part of the changes in natural philosophy that occurred during the Age of Reason. The nature of fossils and their relationship to life in the past became better understood during the 17th and 18th centuries, and at the end of the 18th century, the work of Georges Cuvier had ended a long running debate about the reality of extinction, leading to the emergence of paleontology – in association with comparative anatomy – as a scientific discipline. The expanding knowledge of the fossil record also played an increasing role in the development of geology, and stratigraphy in particular. In 1822, the word \\"paleontology\\" was used by the editor of a French scientific journal to refer to the study of ancient living organisms through fossils, and the first half of the 19th century saw geological and paleontological activity become increasingly well organized with the growth of geologic societies and museums and an increasing number of professional geologists and fossil specialists. This contributed to a rapid increase in knowledge about the history of life on Earth, and progress towards definition of the geologic time scale largely based on fossil evidence. As knowledge of life's history continued to improve, it became increasingly obvious that there had been some kind of successive order to the development of life. This would encourage early evolutionary theories on the transmutation of species. After Charles Darwin published Origin of Species in 1859, much of the focus of paleontology shifted to understanding evolutionary paths, including human evolution, and evolutionary theory. The last half of the 19th century saw a tremendous expansion in paleontological activity, especially in North America. The trend continued in the 20th century with additional regions of the Earth being opened to systematic fossil collection, as demonstrated by a series of important discoveries in China near the end of the 20th century. Many transitional fossils have been discovered, and there is now considered to be abundant evidence of how all classes of vertebrates are related, much of it in the form of transitional fossils. The last few decades of the 20th century saw a renewed interest in mass extinctions and their role in the evolution of life on Earth.Bowler Evolution: The History of an Idea pp. 351–352 There was also a renewed interest in the Cambrian explosion that saw the development of the body plans of most animal phyla. The discovery of fossils of the Ediacaran biota and developments in paleobiology extended knowledge about the history of life back far before the Cambrian. Prior to the 17th century As early as the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) recognized that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what was at the time dry land was once under the sea.Desmond p. 692-697. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, the fossils were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils p. 39 In 1027, the Persian naturalist, Ibn Sina (known as Avicenna in Europe), proposed an explanation of how the stoniness of fossils was caused in The Book of Healing. He modified an idea of Aristotle's, which explained it in terms of vaporous exhalations. Ibn Sina modified this into the theory of petrifying fluids (succus lapidificatus), which was elaborated on by Albert of Saxony in the 14th century and was accepted in some form by most naturalists by the 16th century.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils p. 24 Shen Kuo () (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty used marine fossils found in the Taihang Mountains to infer the existence of geological processes such as geomorphology and the shifting of seashores over time.Shen Kuo,Mengxi Bitan (梦溪笔谈; Dream Pool Essays) (1088) Using his observation of preserved petrified bamboos found underground in Yan'an, Shanbei region, Shaanxi province, he argued for a theory of gradual climate change, since Shaanxi was part of a dry climate zone that did not support a habitat for the growth of bamboos.Needham, Volume 3, p. 614. As a result of a new emphasis on observing, classifying, and cataloging nature, 16th century natural philosophers in Europe began to establish extensive collections of fossil objects (as well as collections of plant and animal specimens), which were often stored in specially built cabinets to help organize them. Conrad Gesner published a 1565 work on fossils that contained one of the first detailed descriptions of such a cabinet and collection. The collection belonged to a member of the extensive network of correspondents that Gesner drew on for his works. Such informal correspondence networks among natural philosophers and collectors became increasingly important during the course of the 16th century and were direct forerunners of the scientific societies that would begin to form in the 17th century. These cabinet collections and correspondence networks played an important role in the development of natural philosophy.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 9–17 However, most 16th-century Europeans did not recognize that fossils were the remains of living organisms. The etymology of the word fossil comes from the Latin for things having been dug up. As this indicates, the term was applied to a wide variety of stone and stone-like objects without regard to whether they might have an organic origin. 16th-century writers such as Gesner and Georg Agricola were more interested in classifying such objects by their physical and mystical properties than they were in determining the objects' origins.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 23–33 In addition, the natural philosophy of the period encouraged alternative explanations for the origin of fossils. Both the Aristotelian and Neoplatonic schools of philosophy provided support for the idea that stony objects might grow within the earth to resemble living things. Neoplatonic philosophy maintained that there could be affinities between living and non-living objects that could cause one to resemble the other. The Aristotelian school maintained that the seeds of living organisms could enter the ground and generate objects resembling those organisms.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 33–36 = Leonardo da Vinci and the development of paleontology = Leonardo da Vinci established a line of continuity between the two main branches of paleontology: body fossil palaeontology and ichnology.Baucon, A. 2010. Leonardo da Vinci, the founding father of ichnology. Palaios 25. Abstract available from the author's homepage In fact, Leonardo dealt with both major classes of fossils: (1) body fossils, e.g. fossilized shells; (2) ichnofossils (also known as trace fossils), i.e. the fossilized products of life-substrate interactions (e.g. burrows and borings). In folios 8 to 10 of the Leicester code, Leonardo examined the subject of body fossils, tackling one of the vexing issues of his contemporaries: why do we find petrified seashells on mountains? Leonardo answered this question by correctly interpreting the biogenic nature of fossil mollusks and their sedimentary matrix.Baucon A., Bordy E., Brustur T., Buatois L., Cunningham T., De C., Duffin C., Felletti F., Gaillard C., Hu B., Hu L., Jensen S., Knaust D., Lockley M., Lowe P., Mayor A., Mayoral E., Mikulas R., Muttoni G., Neto de Carvalho C., Pemberton S., Pollard J., Rindsberg A., Santos A., Seike K., Song H., Turner S., Uchman A., Wang Y., Yi-ming G., Zhang L., Zhang W. 2012.

To da Vinci, ichnofossils played a central role in demonstrating: (1) the organic nature of petrified shells and (2) the sedimentary origin of the rock layers bearing fossil objects. Da Vinci described what are bioerosion ichnofossils:Baucon, A. 2010. Da Vinci’s Paleodictyon: the fractal beauty of traces. Acta Geologica Polonica, 60(1).

Abstract available from the author's homepage Leonardo's considerations of invertebrate ichnofossils are extraordinarily modern not only when compared to those of his contemporaries, but also to interpretations in later times. In fact, during the 1800s invertebrate ichnofossils were explained as fucoids, or seaweed, and their true nature was widely understood only by the early 1900s.OSGOOD, R.G., 1975, The history of invertebrate ichnology, in Frey, R.W., ed., The Study of Trace Fossils: Springer Verlag, New York, p. 3–12.OSGOOD, R.G., 1970, Trace fossils of the Cincinnati area: Paleontographica Americana, v. 6, no. 41, p. 281–444.PEMBERTON, S.G., MACEACHERN, J.A., and GINGRAS, M.K., 2007, The antecedents of invertebrate ichnology in North America: The Canadian and Cincinnati schools, in Miller, W., III, ed., Trace Fossils. Concepts, Problems, Prospects: Elsevier, Amsterdam, p. 14–31. For these reasons, Leonardo da Vinci is deservedly considered the founding father of both the major branches of palaeontology, i.e. the study of body fossils and ichnology.  17th century  Johann Jakob Scheuchzer tried to explain fossils using Biblical floods in his Herbarium of the Deluge (1709) During the Age of Reason, fundamental changes in natural philosophy were reflected in the analysis of fossils. In 1665 Athanasius Kircher attributed giant bones to extinct races of giant humans in his Mundus subterraneus. In the same year Robert Hooke published Micrographia, an illustrated collection of his observations with a microscope. One of these observations was entitled \\"Of Petrify'd wood, and other Petrify'd bodies\\", which included a comparison between petrified and ordinary wood. He concluded that petrified wood was ordinary wood that had been soaked with \\"water impregnated with stony and earthy particles\\". He then suggested that several kinds of fossil sea shells were formed from ordinary shells by a similar process. He argued against the prevalent view that such objects were \\"Stones form'd by some extraordinary Plastick virtue latent in the Earth itself\\".Hooke Micrographia observation XVII Hooke believed that fossils provided evidence about the history of life on Earth writing in 1668: > ...if the finding of Coines, Medals, Urnes, and other Monuments of famous > persons, or Towns, or Utensils, be admitted for unquestionable Proofs, that > such Persons or things have, in former times had a being, certainly those > Petrifactions may be allowed to be of equal Validity and Evidence, that > there have formerly been such Vegetables or Animals... and are true > universal Characters legible to all rational Men.Bowler The Earth > Encompassed (1992) pp. 118–119 Illustration from Steno's 1667 paper shows a shark head and its teeth along with a fossil tooth for comparison. Hooke was prepared to accept the possibility that some such fossils represented species that had become extinct, possibly in past geological catastrophes. In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a paper about a shark head he had dissected. He compared the teeth of the shark with the common fossil objects known as \\"tongue stones\\" or glossopetrae. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew a clear distinction between objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp 72–73 Despite the considerable influence of Forerunner, naturalists such as Martin Lister (1638–1712) and John Ray (1627–1705) continued to question the organic origin of some fossils. They were particularly concerned about objects such as fossil Ammonites, which Hooke claimed were organic in origin, that did not resemble any known living species. This raised the possibility of extinction, which they found difficult to accept for philosophical and theological reasons.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp 61–65 In 1695 Ray wrote to the Welsh naturalist Edward Lluyd complaining of such views: \\"... there follows such a train of consequences, as seem to shock the Scripture-History of the novity of the World; at least they overthrow the opinion received, & not without good reason, among Divines and Philosophers, that since the first Creation there have been no species of Animals or Vegetables lost, no new ones produced.\\"Bowler The Earth Encompassed (1992) p. 117 18th century A drawing comparing jaws was added in 1799 when Cuvier's 1796 presentation on living and fossil elephants was published. In his 1778 work Epochs of Nature Georges Buffon referred to fossils, in particular the discovery of fossils of tropical species such as elephants and rhinoceros in northern Europe, as evidence for the theory that the earth had started out much warmer than it currently was and had been gradually cooling. In 1796 Georges Cuvier presented a paper on living and fossil elephants comparing skeletal remains of Indian and African elephants to fossils of mammoths and of an animal he would later name mastodon utilizing comparative anatomy. He established for the first time that Indian and African elephants were different species, and that mammoths differed from both and must be extinct. He further concluded that the mastodon was another extinct species that also differed from Indian or African elephants, more so than mammoths. Cuvier made another powerful demonstration of the power of comparative anatomy in paleontology when he presented a second paper in 1796 on a large fossil skeleton from Paraguay, which he named Megatherium and identified as a giant sloth by comparing its skull to those of two living species of tree sloth. Cuvier's ground-breaking work in paleontology and comparative anatomy led to the widespread acceptance of extinction.McGowan the dragon seekers pp. 3–4 It also led Cuvier to advocate the geological theory of catastrophism to explain the succession of organisms revealed by the fossil record. He also pointed out that since mammoths and woolly rhinoceros were not the same species as the elephants and rhinoceros currently living in the tropics, their fossils could not be used as evidence for a cooling earth. Illustration from William Smith's Strata by Organized Fossils (1817) In a pioneering application of stratigraphy, William Smith, a surveyor and mining engineer, made extensive use of fossils to help correlate rock strata in different locations. He created the first geological map of England during the late 1790s and early 19th century. He established the principle of faunal succession, the idea that each strata of sedimentary rock would contain particular types of fossils, and that these would succeed one another in a predictable way even in widely separated geologic formations. At the same time, Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart, an instructor at the Paris school of mine engineering, used similar methods in an influential study of the geology of the region around Paris. Early to mid-19th century =The age of reptiles= Illustration of fossil Iguanodon teeth with a modern iguana jaw for comparison from Mantell's 1825 paper describing Iguanodon In 1808, Cuvier identified a fossil found in Maastricht as a giant marine reptile that would later be named Mosasaurus. He also identified, from a drawing, another fossil found in Bavaria as a flying reptile and named it Pterodactylus. He speculated, based on the strata in which these fossils were found, that large reptiles had lived prior to what he was calling \\"the age of mammals\\".Rudwick Georges Cuvier, Fossil Bones and Geological Catastrophes p. 158 Cuvier's speculation would be supported by a series of finds that would be made in Great Britain over the course of the next two decades. Mary Anning, a professional fossil collector since age eleven, collected the fossils of a number of marine reptiles and prehistoric fish from the Jurassic marine strata at Lyme Regis. These included the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be recognized as such, which was collected in 1811, and the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found in 1821 and 1823. Mary Anning was only 12 when she and her brother discovered the Ichthyosaurus skeleton. Many of her discoveries would be described scientifically by the geologists William Conybeare, Henry De la Beche, and William Buckland.McGowan pp. 11–27 It was Anning who observed that stony objects known as \\"bezoar stones\\" were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons, and she noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilized fish bones and scales as well as sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. This led her to suggest to Buckland that they were fossilized feces, which he named coprolites, and which he used to better understand ancient food chains.Rudwick, Martin Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform (2008) pp. 154–155.. Mary Anning made many fossil discoveries that revolutionized science. However, despite her phenomenal scientific contributions, she was rarely recognized officially for her discoveries. Her discoveries were often credited to wealthy men who bought her fossils. In 1824, Buckland found and described a lower jaw from Jurassic deposits from Stonesfield. He determined that the bone belonged to a carnivorous land-dwelling reptile he called Megalosaurus. That same year Gideon Mantell realized that some large teeth he had found in 1822, in Cretaceous rocks from Tilgate, belonged to a giant herbivorous land-dwelling reptile. He called it Iguanodon, because the teeth resembled those of an iguana. All of this led Mantell to publish an influential paper in 1831 entitled \\"The Age of Reptiles\\" in which he summarized the evidence for there having been an extended time during which the earth had teemed with large reptiles, and he divided that era, based in what rock strata different types of reptiles first appeared, into three intervals that anticipated the modern periods of the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.Cadbury, Deborah The Dinosaur Hunters (2000) pp. 171–175. In 1832 Mantell would find, in Tilgate, a partial skeleton of an armored reptile he would call Hylaeosaurus. In 1841 the English anatomist Richard Owen would create a new order of reptiles, which he called Dinosauria, for Megalosaurus, Iguanodon, and Hylaeosaurus.McGowan p. 176 Illustration of the fossil jaw of the Stonesfield mammal from Gideon Mantell's 1848 Wonders of Geology This evidence that giant reptiles had lived on Earth in the past caused great excitement in scientific circles,McGowan pp. 70–87 and even among some segments of the general public.McGowan p. 109 Buckland did describe the jaw of a small primitive mammal, Phascolotherium, that was found in the same strata as Megalosaurus. This discovery, known as the Stonesfield mammal, was a much discussed anomaly. Cuvier at first thought it was a marsupial, but Buckland later realized it was a primitive placental mammal. Due to its small size and primitive nature, Buckland did not believe it invalidated the overall pattern of an age of reptiles, when the largest and most conspicuous animals had been reptiles rather than mammals.McGowan pp. 78–79 =Paleobotany and the origin of the word paleontology= In 1828 Alexandre Brongniart's son, the botanist Adolphe Brongniart, published the introduction to a longer work on the history of fossil plants. Adolphe Brongniart concluded that the history of plants could roughly be divided into four parts. The first period was characterized by cryptogams. The second period was characterized by the appearance of the conifers. The third period brought emergence of the cycads, and the fourth by the development of the flowering plants (such as the dicotyledons). The transitions between each of these periods was marked by sharp discontinuities in the fossil record, with more gradual changes within the periods. Brongniart's work is the foundation of paleobotany and reinforced the theory that life on earth had a long and complex history, and different groups of plants and animals made their appearances in successive order.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 145–147 It also supported the idea that the Earth's climate had changed over time as Brongniart concluded that plant fossils showed that during the Carboniferous the climate of Northern Europe must have been tropical.Bowler The Earth Encompassed (1992) The increasing attention being paid to fossil plants in the first decades of the 19th century would trigger a significant change in the terminology for the study of past life. The editor of the influential French scientific journal, Journal de Physique, a student of Cuvier's named Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, coined the term \\"paleozoologie\\" in 1817 to refer to the work Cuvier and others were doing to reconstruct extinct animals from fossil bones. However, Blainville began looking for a term that could refer to the study of both fossil animal and plant remains. After trying some unsuccessful alternatives, he hit on \\"palaeontologie\\" in 1822. Blainville's term for the study of the fossilized organisms quickly became popular and was anglicized into \\"paleontology\\".Rudwick Worlds before Adam p. 48 The term \\"paleobotany\\" was coined in 1884 and \\"palynology\\" in 1944. =Catastrophism, uniformitarianism and the fossil record= In Cuvier's landmark 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants, he referred to a single catastrophe that destroyed life to be replaced by the current forms. As a result of his studies of extinct mammals, he realized that animals such as Palaeotherium had lived before the time of the mammoths, which led him to write in terms of multiple geological catastrophes that had wiped out a series of successive faunas.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 124–125 By 1830, a scientific consensus had formed around his ideas as a result of paleobotany and the dinosaur and marine reptile discoveries in Britain.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 156–157 In Great Britain, where natural theology was very influential in the early 19th century, a group of geologists that included Buckland, and Robert Jameson insisted on explicitly linking the most recent of Cuvier's catastrophes to the biblical flood. Catastrophism had a religious overtone in Britain that was absent elsewhere.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 133–136 Partly in response to what he saw as unsound and unscientific speculations by William Buckland and other practitioners of flood geology, Charles Lyell advocated the geological theory of uniformitarianism in his influential work Principles of Geology.McGowan pp. 93–95 Lyell amassed evidence, both from his own field research and the work of others, that most geological features could be explained by the slow action of present-day forces, such as vulcanism, earthquakes, erosion, and sedimentation rather than past catastrophic events.McGowan pp. 100–103 Lyell also claimed that the apparent evidence for catastrophic changes in the fossil record, and even the appearance of directional succession in the history of life, were illusions caused by imperfections in that record. For instance he argued that the absence of birds and mammals from the earliest fossil strata was merely an imperfection in the fossil record attributable to the fact that marine organisms were more easily fossilized. Also Lyell pointed to the Stonesfield mammal as evidence that mammals had not necessarily been preceded by reptiles, and to the fact that certain Pleistocene strata showed a mixture of extinct and still surviving species, which he said showed that extinction occurred piecemeal rather than as a result of catastrophic events.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 178–184 Lyell was successful in convincing geologists of the idea that the geological features of the earth were largely due to the action of the same geologic forces that could be observed in the present day, acting over an extended period of time. He was not successful in gaining support for his view of the fossil record, which he believed did not support a theory of directional succession.McGowan pp. 100 =Transmutation of species and the fossil record= In the early 19th century Jean Baptiste Lamarck used fossils to argue for his theory of the transmutation of species.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils p. 119 Fossil finds, and the emerging evidence that life had changed over time, fueled speculation on this topic during the next few decades.McGowan p. 8 Robert Chambers used fossil evidence in his 1844 popular science book Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, which advocated an evolutionary origin for the cosmos as well as for life on earth. Like Lamarck's theory it maintained that life had progressed from the simple to the complex.McGowan pp. 188–191 These early evolutionary ideas were widely discussed in scientific circles but were not accepted into the scientific mainstream.Larson p. 73 Many of the critics of transmutational ideas used fossil evidence in their arguments. In the same paper that coined the term dinosaur Richard Owen pointed out that dinosaurs were at least as sophisticated and complex as modern reptiles, which he claimed contradicted transmutational theories.Larson p. 44 Hugh Miller would make a similar argument, pointing out that the fossil fish found in the Old Red Sandstone formation were fully as complex as any later fish, and not the primitive forms alleged by Vestiges.Ruckwick The Meaning of fossils pp. 206–207 While these early evolutionary theories failed to become accepted as mainstream science, the debates over them would help pave the way for the acceptance of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection a few years later.Larson p. 51 Geologic time scale from an 1861 book by Richard Owen shows the appearance of major animal types. =Geological time scale and the history of life= Geologists such as Adam Sedgwick, and Roderick Murchison continued, in the course of disputes such as The Great Devonian Controversy, to make advances in stratigraphy. They described newly recognized geological periods, such as the Cambrian, the Silurian, the Devonian, and the Permian. Increasingly, such progress in stratigraphy depended on the opinions of experts with specialized knowledge of particular types of fossils such as William Lonsdale (fossil corals), and John Lindley (fossil plants) who both played a role in the Devonian controversy and its resolution.Rudwick The Great Devonian Controversy p. 94 By the early 1840s much of the geologic time scale had been developed. In 1841, John Phillips formally divided the geologic column into three major eras, the Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic, based on sharp breaks in the fossil record.Larson pp. 36–37 He identified the three periods of the Mesozoic era and all the periods of the Paleozoic era except the Ordovician. His definition of the geological time scale is still used today.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils p. 213 It remained a relative time scale with no method of assigning any of the periods' absolute dates. It was understood that not only had there been an \\"age of reptiles\\" preceding the current \\"age of mammals\\", but there had been a time (during the Cambrian and the Silurian) when life had been restricted to the sea, and a time (prior to the Devonian) when invertebrates had been the largest and most complex forms of animal life. =Expansion and professionalization of geology and paleontology= Elmer Riggs and H.W. Menke in Field Columbian Museum's paleontology lab, 1899. This rapid progress in geology and paleontology during the 1830s and 1840s was aided by a growing international network of geologists and fossil specialists whose work was organized and reviewed by an increasing number of geological societies. Many of these geologists and paleontologists were now paid professionals working for universities, museums and government geological surveys. The relatively high level of public support for the earth sciences was due to their cultural impact, and their proven economic value in helping to exploit mineral resources such as coal.Rudwick The Meaning of Fossils pp. 200–201 Another important factor was the development in the late 18th and early 19th centuries of museums with large natural history collections. These museums received specimens from collectors around the world and served as centers for the study of comparative anatomy and morphology. These disciplines played key roles in the development of a more technically sophisticated form of natural history. One of the first and most important examples was the Museum of Natural History in Paris, which was at the center of many of the developments in natural history during the first decades of the 19th century. It was founded in 1793 by an act of the French National Assembly, and was based on an extensive royal collection plus the private collections of aristocrats confiscated during the French revolution, and expanded by material seized in French military conquests during the Napoleonic Wars. The Paris museum was the professional base for Cuvier, and his professional rival Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. The English anatomists Robert Grant and Richard Owen both spent time studying there. Owen would go on to become the leading British morphologist while working at the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.Greene and Depew The Philosophy of Biology pp. 128–130Bowler and Morus Making Modern Science pp. 168–169 Late 19th century =Evolution= Photograph of the second Archaeopteryx skeleton to be found, taken in 1881 at the Natural History Museum, Berlin Charles Darwin's publication of the On the Origin of Species in 1859 was a watershed event in all the life sciences, especially paleontology. Fossils had played a role in the development of Darwin's theory. In particular he had been impressed by fossils he had collected in South America during the voyage of the Beagle of giant armadillos, giant sloths, and what at the time he thought were giant llamas that seemed to be related to species still living on the continent in modern times.Bowler Evolution: The History of an Idea p. 150 The scientific debate that started immediately after the publication of Origin led to a concerted effort to look for transitional fossils and other evidence of evolution in the fossil record. There were two areas where early success attracted considerable public attention, the transition between reptiles and birds, and the evolution of the modern single-toed horse.Larson Evolution p. 139 In 1861 the first specimen of Archaeopteryx, an animal with both teeth and feathers and a mix of other reptilian and avian features, was discovered in a limestone quarry in Bavaria and described by Richard Owen. Another would be found in the late 1870s and put on display at the Natural History Museum, Berlin in 1881. Other primitive toothed birds were found by Othniel Marsh in Kansas in 1872. Marsh also discovered fossils of several primitive horses in the Western United States that helped trace the evolution of the horse from the small 5-toed Hyracotherium of the Eocene to the much larger single-toed modern horses of the genus Equus. Thomas Huxley would make extensive use of both the horse and bird fossils in his advocacy of evolution. Acceptance of evolution occurred rapidly in scientific circles, but acceptance of Darwin's proposed mechanism of natural selection as the driving force behind it was much less universal. In particular some paleontologists such as Edward Drinker Cope and Henry Fairfield Osborn preferred alternatives such as neo-Lamarckism, the inheritance of characteristics acquired during life, and orthogenesis, an innate drive to change in a particular direction, to explain what they perceived as linear trends in evolution.Larson pp. 126–127 Diagram by O.C. Marsh of the evolution of horse feet and teeth, reproduced in T. H. Huxley's 1876 book, Professor Huxley in America There was also great interest in human evolution. Neanderthal fossils were discovered in 1856, but at the time it was not clear that they represented a different species from modern humans. Eugene Dubois created a sensation with his discovery of Java Man, the first fossil evidence of a species that seemed clearly intermediate between humans and apes, in 1891.Larson pp. 145–147 =Developments in North America= A major development in the second half of the 19th century was a rapid expansion of paleontology in North America. In 1858 Joseph Leidy described a Hadrosaurus skeleton, which was the first North American dinosaur to be described from good remains. However, it was the massive westward expansion of railroads, military bases, and settlements into Kansas and other parts of the Western United States following the American Civil War that really fueled the expansion of fossil collection.Everhart Oceans of Kansas p. 17 The result was an increased understanding of the natural history of North America, including the discovery of the Western Interior Sea that had covered Kansas and much of the rest of the Midwestern United States during parts of the Cretaceous, the discovery of several important fossils of primitive birds and horses, and the discovery of a number of new dinosaur genera including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops. Much of this activity was part of a fierce personal and professional rivalry between two men, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope, which has become known as the Bone Wars.The Bone Wars. From Wyoming Tales and Trails Wyoming Tales and Trails. Overview of developments in the 20th century =Developments in geology= Two 20th century developments in geology had a big effect on paleontology. The first was the development of radiometric dating, which allowed absolute dates to be assigned to the geologic timescale. The second was the theory of plate tectonics, which helped make sense of the geographical distribution of ancient life. =Geographical expansion of paleontology= During the 20th century, paleontological exploration intensified everywhere and ceased to be a largely European and North American activity. In the 135 years between Buckland's first discovery and 1969 a total of 170 dinosaur genera were described. In the 25 years after 1969 that number increased to 315. Much of this increase was due to the examination of new rock exposures, particularly in previously little-explored areas in South America and Africa.McGowan p. 105 Near the end of the 20th century the opening of China to systematic exploration for fossils has yielded a wealth of material on dinosaurs and the origin of birds and mammals.Bowler Evolution p. 349 Also study of the Chengjiang fauna, a Cambrian fossil site in China, during the 1990s has provided important clues to the origin of vertebrates.Prothero ch. 8 =Mass extinctions= The 20th century saw a major renewal of interest in mass extinction events and their effect on the course of the history of life. This was particularly true after 1980 when Luis and Walter Alvarez put forward the Alvarez hypothesis claiming that an impact event caused the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which killed off the non-avian dinosaurs along with many other living things. Also in the early 1980s Jack Sepkoski and David M. Raup published papers with statistical analysis of the fossil record of marine invertebrates that revealed a pattern (possibly cyclical) of repeated mass extinctions with significant implications for the evolutionary history of life. =Evolutionary paths and theory= Fossil of the Taung child discovered in South Africa in 1924 Throughout the 20th century new fossil finds continued to contribute to understanding the paths taken by evolution. Examples include major taxonomic transitions such as finds in Greenland, starting in the 1930s (with more major finds in the 1980s), of fossils illustrating the evolution of tetrapods from fish, and fossils in China during the 1990s that shed light on the dinosaur-bird relationship. Other events that have attracted considerable attention have included the discovery of a series of fossils in Pakistan that have shed light on whale evolution, and most famously of all a series of finds throughout the 20th century in Africa (starting with Taung child in 1924) and elsewhere have helped illuminate the course of human evolution. Increasingly, at the end of the 20th century, the results of paleontology and molecular biology were being brought together to reveal detailed phylogenetic trees. The results of paleontology have also contributed to the development of evolutionary theory. In 1944 George Gaylord Simpson published Tempo and Mode in Evolution, which used quantitative analysis to show that the fossil record was consistent with the branching, non-directional, patterns predicted by the advocates of evolution driven by natural selection and genetic drift rather than the linear trends predicted by earlier advocates of neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis. This integrated paleontology into the modern evolutionary synthesis.Bowler Evolution p. 337 In 1972 Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould used fossil evidence to advocate the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which maintains that evolution is characterized by long periods of relative stasis and much shorter periods of relatively rapid change.Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1972). \\"Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism\\" In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., Models in Paleobiology. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. pp. 82–115. Reprinted in N. Eldredge Time frames. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1985. Available here . =Cambrian explosion= A complete Anomalocaris fossil from the Burgess shale One area of paleontology that has seen a lot of activity during the 1980s, 1990s, and beyond is the study of the Cambrian explosion during which many of the various phyla of animals with their distinctive body plans first appear. The well-known Burgess Shale Cambrian fossil site was found in 1909 by Charles Doolittle Walcott, and another important site in Chengjiang China was found in 1912. However, new analysis in the 1980s by Harry B. Whittington, Derek Briggs, Simon Conway Morris and others sparked a renewed interest and a burst of activity including discovery of an important new fossil site, Sirius Passet, in Greenland, and the publication of a popular and controversial book, Wonderful Life by Stephen Jay Gould in 1989. =Pre-Cambrian fossils= A Spriggina fossil from the Ediacaran Prior to 1950 there was no widely accepted fossil evidence of life before the Cambrian period. When Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species he acknowledged that the lack of any fossil evidence of life prior to the relatively complex animals of the Cambrian was a potential argument against the theory of evolution, but expressed the hope that such fossils would be found in the future. In the 1860s there were claims of the discovery of pre- Cambrian fossils, but these would later be shown not to have an organic origin. In the late 19th century Charles Doolittle Walcott would discover stromatolites and other fossil evidence of pre-Cambrian life, but at the time the organic origin of those fossils was also disputed. This would start to change in the 1950s with the discovery of more stromatolites along with microfossils of the bacteria that built them, and the publication of a series of papers by the Soviet scientist Boris Vasil'evich Timofeev announcing the discovery of microscopic fossil spores in pre-Cambrian sediments. A key breakthrough would come when Martin Glaessner would show that fossils of soft bodied animals discovered by Reginald Sprigg during the late 1940s in the Ediacaran hills of Australia were in fact pre-Cambrian not early Cambrian as Sprigg had originally believed, making the Ediacaran biota the oldest animals known. By the end of the 20th century, paleobiology had established that the history of life extended back at least 3.5 billion years.

Route description NY 355 begins at an intersection with NY 66 in the town of North Greenbush. The highway proceeds eastward into the town of Poestenkill, passing to the south of residential homes and Moules Pond. Route 355 is known for most of its length as Cooper Hill Road as it heads eastward towards downtown Poestenkill. County Route 130 (CR 130, formerly NY 154) merges in from the northeast and the route changes names to Spring Avenue. NY 355 continues, passing to the north of Rensselaer County Airpark. NY 355 terminates at an intersection with NY 351 and CR 40 in the hamlet of Poestenkill. History NY 355 was assigned by 1946 to a short connector highway between NY 66 in North Greenbush and NY 154 (Spring Avenue) in the town of Poestenkill. From there, NY 154 continued east to the hamlet of Poestenkill, where it ended at a junction with Round Top and White Church Roads. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY 154 from the Troy city line to NY 355 was transferred from the state of New York to Rensselaer County as part of a highway maintenance swap. The NY 154 designation was completely removed on May 14, 1980, and the portion of NY 154's routing that was not given to Rensselaer County became an eastward extension of NY 355.

He was president of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) and Senator. He outstandingly participated in the student's movement of 1968. On October 2, 1968, he was taken by the authorities at the Plaza of the Three Cultures during the Tlatelolco massacre, and was imprisoned until 1971. When he left the jail, he immediately rejoined the student's movements, becoming one of the organizers of the mobilization of June 10. He obtained a degree in Economics in 1976. Gómez held the national direction of the Mexican Communist Party and was later elected federal deputy in 1979, being part of a leftist coalition. From 1982 to 1988, he was the president of the Unified Socialist Party of Mexico. Later in 1988, he served as federal deputy again and, while being within the first parliamentary group the Party of the Democratic Revolution had at the Mexican Congress, he was appointed vicecoordinator of it. From 1992 to 1995, Mr. Gómez held a representative position at the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District. In 1993 he was a main organizer of a recall election against a government in the capital of the Republic. He was the founding director of a weekly magazine issued by the PRD from 1992 to 1994. He was elected federal deputy twice from the XXIII Federal Electoral District of Coyoacán (at the Federal District), to run at legislatures LVII and LIX. While being a deputy he positioned himself against the FOBAPROA, a banking rescue which required spending many resources, and which was actively promoted by members of the PRI and PAN parties; he eventually achieved an opening of the lists of beneficiaries of the FOBAPROA, though without getting any conclusive results before the negative response of the newly created IPAB. As coordinator of the parliamentary group of the PRD, he managed, for the first time ever in Mexico, to modify the budget by 15 billion pesos that were canalized to the federal organizations, the higher education budget and the retirement funds budget, among others. In 1999, Pablo Gómez was temporarily president of the PRD. From 2000 and until 2003, he was the representative of the PRD before the Federal Electoral Institute, where -after an investigation- he filed a lawsuit against the President of the Republic, Vicente Fox, for the alleged illegal use of resources through the \\"Amigos de Fox\\" -literally, \\"Friends of Fox\\"- corruption scandal, and he also developed the investigation on the Pemexgate -another corruption scandal-, for which he was able to get the ratification of the fine of 1000 million pesos against some PRI members. He has been in two occasions candidate for Head of Government of the Federal District: in the year 2000, losing before Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and in 2006, but that time he did yield his candidacy to Jesús Ortega in a group called TUCOI (All United With the Left) -against the candidacy of Marcelo Ebrard-, which they would lose. He is the author of several books such as Los gastos secretos del Presidente, a book in which Pablo Gómez denounces the expenses in dollars of Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Another important book of which he is author is México 1988: Disputa por la presidencia y Lucha Parlamentaria, book in which he narrates how the electoral fraud was consolidated against Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas and how it was debated at the Chamber of Deputies. In a book derived from his professional thesis, entitled Democracia y crisis política en México, he makes an argumentative defense of the fight for the political freedom in the country. He is the leader of his own internal political current of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, Movimiento por la Democracia (in English, Movement for Democracy). In it, characters of the PRD concur, such as Inti Muñoz Santini, Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, Clara Brugada, Javier González Garza, Jorge Martinez Ramos, Juan N. Guerra Ochoa, Salvador Martinez della Rocca, among others.

Background and education He was the third son of the George Bridgeman, 4th Earl of Bradford, and his wife, Lady Ida Frances Annabella Lumley, second daughter of Richard Lumley, 9th Earl of Scarbrough. His older brother was Orlando Bridgeman, 5th Earl of Bradford. Bridgeman was educated at Harrow School and went then to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Career In 1901, Bridgeman was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery as a second lieutenant and from 1905 served as aide-de-camp to Francis Grenfell, 1st Baron Grenfell, at that time Commander-in-Chief, Ireland. After the latter's resignation in 1908, Bridgeman held the same post to his successor Sir Neville Lyttelton. Several months later, he was sent to India with the Royal Horse Artillery. Promoted to captain, he returned to England at the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. He received command of a battery and was sent to France. Bridgeman was advanced to major in 1915 and in early 1917 joined 47th Divisional Artillery as Brigade major.Alan H.

The southern terminus of the route is at the Mason–Dixon line southeast of Nottingham, where it continues into Maryland as Maryland Route 272 (MD 272). The northern terminus is at an interchange with U.S. Route 222 (US 222) and PA 568 in Adamstown, where PA 568 continues east. The route heads from the Maryland border northwest through the western corner of Chester County, intersecting US 1 in Nottingham. PA 272 continues west into Lancaster County and intersects US 222 in Wakefield, where it turns north and passes through Buck before widening into a divided highway as it comes to another junction with US 222 in Willow Street. Here, the route becomes unsigned and follow US 222 north through Lancaster along one-way city streets. North of Lancaster, US 222 splits at an interchange with US 30 and PA 272 becomes signed again, heading northeast parallel to the freeway alignment of US 222 and passing through Akron, Ephrata (where it intersects US 322), and Adamstown. The route enters Berks County and comes to its northern terminus. PA 272 was first designated in 1928 to run from US 222/PA 72 in Wakefield east to US 1/PA 12 in Nottingham. The route was fully paved by 1940. In the 1940s, PA 272 was extended south from Nottingham to the Maryland border, replacing a section of PA 42 between the Maryland border and Chrome. The route was extended north from Wakefield to US 222 in Willow Street in the 1960s. This extension replaced what became a southern extension of PA 72 from Lancaster in the 1930s. The route was extended from Willow Street to US 222 and PA 568 in Adamstown following the completion of the US 222 freeway between Lancaster and Adamstown in 1977. PA 272 followed US 222 through Lancaster and ran along the former alignment of US 222 between Lancaster and Adamstown. In 2006, the intersection at the northern terminus was converted to an interchange following the extension of the US 222 freeway from Adamstown to the Reading area. Route description PA 272 is mostly in Lancaster County, except for about a mile at the northern terminus where it enters Berks County and the southernmost part of the route, which is in Chester County. Through the city of Lancaster, it is unsigned but concurrent with US 222. =Maryland state line to Lancaster= The southern terminus of PA 272 is at the Maryland state line in East Nottingham Township in Chester County, where the road continues south into that state as MD 272. From the state line, the route heads north on two-lane undivided Chrome Road through a mix of farmland and woodland. In the community of Chrome, PA 272 turns west on Christine Road and continues northwest through agricultural areas with some trees and homes. The road crosses North East Creek into West Nottingham Township and runs through more rural areas before reaching the community of Nottingham. Here, the route passes homes and comes to a bridge over an East Penn Railroad line before it intersects Baltimore Pike to the north of the Herr's Snacks plant. PA 272 passes a mix of residences and businesses and comes to an interchange with the US 1 freeway. A park and ride lot is situated within this interchange. Past this interchange, the road heads through a mix of farmland and residential subdivisions, reaching the community of Glen Roy. The route continues west into wooded areas with some fields. PA 272 crosses the Octoraro Creek into Little Britain Township in Lancaster County and becomes Nottingham Road, curving northwest into agricultural areas with some trees and homes. The road reaches the community of Oak Hill and turns west, passing through more rural land. The route passes near residential development in the community of Little Britain before it continues through farmland and passes through Oakryn. PA 272 enters Fulton Township and runs through agricultural areas with occasional homes, reaching an intersection with US 222 in the community of Wakefield. At this point, the route turns north for a concurrency with US 222 along Robert Fulton Highway, running through a mix of farms and homes. PA 272 splits from US 222 in the community of Penn Hill by heading northwest along Lancaster Pike. The road heads through agricultural areas with some trees and homes, curving north and leaving Fulton Township, where it becomes the border between Drumore Township to the west and East Drumore Township to the east. The route continues through rural areas and turns northwest, passing through the communities of Hensell and Drumore Center. PA 272 curves north and runs through more farmland with some residential and commercial development before coming to an intersection with PA 372 in the community of Buck. At this intersection, PA 272 crosses westbound PA 372 while eastbound PA 372 turns north for a short concurrency with northbound PA 272 before it splits to the east. Past Buck, PA 272 crosses into Providence Township and runs through a mix of farmland and woodland with some commercial development, passing to the east of Buck Motorsports Park and bending northwest. The road continues north through farms and woods with some homes and businesses. The route widens into a four-lane divided highway and the travel lanes split as the road heads northwest through wooded areas and passes under the Enola Low Grade Trail. Both directions of PA 272 rejoin in the community of Smithville and it continues north as a four-lane divided highway through a mix of farms and woods with some homes and businesses, curving northwest. The road crosses Pequea Creek into Pequea Township and becomes Willow Street Pike, continuing through rural areas with some development before reaching the community of Willow Street. Between Smithville and Willow Street, a few of the intersections along the divided highway are controlled by jughandles. In Willow Street, both directions of the route split, with the northbound direction heading into residential and commercial areas, while the southbound direction bypasses Willow Street to the west through farmland. PA 272 continues into West Lampeter Township and runs through more developed areas in Willow Street before it comes to a junction with US 222/PA 741. At this point, US 222 turns north to join PA 272 along Willow Street Pike, and PA 272 becomes unsigned along the US 222 concurrency. Both directions of Willow Street Pike rejoin and it continues north as a two-lane undivided road past commercial development before it runs through wooded residential areas, passing through Hollinger.

The southbound direction intersects PA 324 in the community of Engleside before the two routes continue into the city of Lancaster, heading into urban residential and commercial areas. A short distance after entering Lancaster, northbound US 222/PA 272 intersects the end of one-way northbound PA 324 and heads onto South Queen Street. The two routes continues past urban rowhomes along South Queen Street northbound and South Prince Street southbound. Northbound US 222/PA 272 splits from South Queen Street by heading northeast onto Church Street, which carries three lanes of one-way traffic, while northbound PA 72 continues along South Queen Street. Just south of downtown Lancaster, the northbound direction of the route turns north onto South Lime Street, which carries two lanes of one-way traffic. US 222/PA 272 heads into the commercial downtown of Lancaster and crosses eastbound PA 462 at King Street. Past this, the route becomes North Lime Street northbound and North Prince Street southbound, crossing eastbound PA 23 at Chestnut Street and westbound PA 23/PA 462 at Walnut Street. The two routes leave the downtown area and run through urban areas of homes and businesses. The northbound direction passes to the east of Lancaster General Hospital between East James and East Frederick streets while the southbound direction passes to the east of Clipper Magazine Stadium, home of the Lancaster Barnstormers baseball team, north of the Harrisburg Avenue intersection. At the intersection with Liberty Street, northbound US 222/PA 272 shifts west a block onto four-lane undivided North Duke Street, a two-way road, while the one-way pair continues into Manheim Township. A block later, at McGovern Avenue, both directions of US 222/PA 272 rejoin along North Duke Street. Southbound US 222/PA 272 follows McGovern Avenue west between North Duke Street and North Prince Street, forming the border between a portion of the city of Lancaster to the north that is home to the Lancaster station along Amtrak's Keystone Corridor and Manheim Township to the south. The roadway is a three-lane road with two westbound lanes that carry southbound US 222/PA 272 and one eastbound lane. McGovern Avenue reaches intersection with northbound PA 72 at North Queen Street, where northbound PA 72 turns west to join southbound US 222/PA 272 along the road. At North Prince Street, southbound US 222/PA 272 turn south while PA 72 becomes two-way heading north. Both directions of US 222/PA 272 continue north along four-lane undivided North Duke Street and the road reaches the Thaddeus Stevens Bridge over Amtrak's Keystone Corridor, where it becomes the border between Manheim Township to the west and Lancaster to the east. At Keller Avenue, the road becomes Lititz Pike and fully enters Manheim Township, running through commercial areas as a five- lane road with a center left-turn lane. Northbound US 222 and PA 272 head northeast onto Oregon Pike, with PA 272 becoming signed again, while southbound US 222 and PA 501 continue north along Lititz Pike. The two routes continue northeast as a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and runs past businesses and a few homes before it comes to an interchange with the US 30 freeway. Here, US 222 heads east along US 30 and PA 272 continues northeast along Oregon Pike, passing through commercial areas and narrowing to two lanes. The road continues through suburban areas of homes and businesses and passes through the community of Roseville. Farther northeast, the route widens to a divided highway at the Landis Valley Road intersection, where it passes to the southeast of the Landis Valley Museum in the community of Landis Valley. PA 272 becomes undivided again and passes through wooded residential areas before it enters farmland. The route becomes parallel to the US 222 freeway located to the southeast and reaches direct ramps to and from the southbound lanes of US 222. Access to and from the northbound lanes is provided by Jake Landis Road, which passes under US 222 and connects to Butter Road, which provides access to the ramps. The route heads through wooded areas and passes over Lititz Run before it comes to the eastern terminus of PA 722 near the community of Oregon. PA 272 northbound past Bushong Road in Manheim Township The road heads into agricultural areas and enters Warwick Township prior to crossing Cocalico Creek into West Earl Township. The route heads through residential areas with some commercial development before it enters business areas, where it gains a center left-turn lane briefly before it becomes a divided highway and crosses PA 772 near Brownstown. Past this, PA 272 narrows back into a two-lane undivided road and runs through a mix of farm fields and commercial development, curving to the north. The road becomes the border between West Earl Township to the west and the borough of Akron to the east, running past homes and businesses. The route fully enters Akron and becomes South 7th Street, passing more development. PA 272 becomes North 7th Street upon crossing Main Street and continues through residential and commercial areas.

The route curves northeast past commercial development and comes to an intersection with Colonel Howard Boulevard, which heads east to provide access to the US 222 freeway and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (Interstate 76) at the Reading interchange. A short distance later, the road comes to a bridge over the Pennsylvania Turnpike. PA 272 gains a center left-turn lane and continues past businesses, eventually narrowing back to two lanes. The road passes more commercial development with some homes and crosses PA 897 in the community of Swartzville. Past this intersection, the route continues through developed areas and enters the borough of Adamstown. PA 272 heads through wooded areas with some homes and businesses as it passes through the borough. After leaving Adamstown, the road runs through a small corner of Brecknock Township. PA 272 enters Brecknock Township in Berks County and passes commercial development before it comes to its northern terminus at an interchange with the US 222 freeway. A park and ride lot is located at the southwest corner of this interchange. Past this interchange, the road continues east as PA 568. History PA 272 northern terminus at US 222/PA 568 in Brecknock Township The Willow Street Turnpike Road Company was chartered on April 5, 1849 to build a private turnpike between Willow Street and Lancaster. On March 25, 1850, the Lancaster and Ephrata Turnpike and Plank Road Company was charted to build a turnpike between Lancaster and Ephrata. This turnpike became known as the Oregon Turnpike. When Pennsylvania first legislated routes in 1911, the road between Willow Street and Lancaster was designated as part of Legislative Route 136 while the road between Brownstown and Adamstown served as part of Legislative Route 148, which connected Lancaster to Reading. With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926, the road between Willow Street and Lancaster became a part of US 230 while the road between Brownstown and Adamstown was a part of US 222. In 1927, PA 72 was designated concurrent with US 230 between Willow Street and Lancaster while PA 41 ran concurrent with US 222 between Brownstown and Adamstown. PA 272 was designated in 1928 to run from US 222/PA 72 in Wakefield east to US 1/PA 12 (Baltimore Pike) in Nottingham, with the road unpaved in Lancaster County and paved in Chester County. Also, the road between the Maryland border and Chrome became the southernmost portion of PA 42. At this time, US 222 replaced the US 230 designation south of Lancaster and PA 240 replaced the PA 41 designation along US 222 between Brownstown and Adamstown. By 1930, PA 272 was paved between PA 172 in Little Britain and the Octoraro Creek. In addition, PA 722 was designated onto the Oregon Pike between Oregon and Brownstown while the concurrent state route designations were removed from US 222. In the 1930s, PA 272 was paved between Wakefield and Little Britain. Also, a southern extension of PA 72 was designated onto the straight road between Wakefield and Willow Street. US 222 was also realigned to use Oregon Pike between Lancaster and Brownstown, replacing the easternmost portion of PA 722. US 222 was also moved to a new alignment between Ephrata and Reamstown in 1944, having previously followed State Street and Reamstown Road. This new alignment included an interchange with US 322. PA 272 was extended south from Nottingham to the Maryland border in the 1940s, replacing the southernmost section of PA 42. In the 1960s, PA 272 was extended north from Wakefield to US 222 in Willow Street, replacing the section of PA 72 between Wakefield and Willow Street. Also, the route was widened to a divided highway between Smithville and Willow Street. In July 1977, the US 222 freeway was completed between Lancaster and the Berks County border near Adamstown. As a result, PA 272 was extended north from Willow Street to run concurrent with US 222 through Lancaster before following the former surface alignment of US 222 between Lancaster and Adamstown, ending at an intersection with US 222 and PA 568. In 2006, the intersection with US 222 and PA 568 at the northern terminus was replaced with an interchange as part of upgrading US 222 to a freeway between Adamstown and Reading. In March 2013, construction began on a new bridge to carry US 222/PA 272 over the Amtrak tracks in Lancaster. The bridge project cost $26.6 million, with $12.7 million of that figure the actual construction costs of the bridge. The new bridge, which is four lanes wide and connects Lititz Pike directly with North Duke Street, opened to traffic on July 9, 2014, with the old bridge closed and later demolished. The bridge carrying US 222/PA 272 over the Amtrak line was named the Thaddeus Stevens Bridge in honor of Thaddeus Stevens, a 19th-century abolitionist and United States Representative who was from Lancaster. Concurrent with the construction of the new bridge, McGovern Avenue was converted to a two-way road between North Queen Street and North Duke Street to provide improved access to Lancaster station.

Its intent is to provide redundancy in the event a security control fails or a vulnerability is exploited that can cover aspects of personnel, procedural, technical and physical security for the duration of the system's life cycle. Background  The idea behind the defense in depth approach is to defend a system against any particular attack using several independent methods.Schneier on Security: Security in the Cloud It is a layering tactic, conceived. by the National Security Agency (NSA) as a comprehensive approach to information and electronic security.Defense in Depth: A practical strategy for achieving Information Assurance in today’s highly networked environments.OWASP Wiki: Defense in depth The term defense in depth in computing is inspired by a military strategy of the same name, but is quite different in concept. The military strategy revolves around having a weaker perimeter defense and intentionally yielding space to buy time, envelop, and ultimately counter-attack an opponent, whereas the information security strategy simply involves multiple layers of controls, but not intentionally ceding ground (cf. honeypot.)  Controls  Defense in depth can be divided into three areas: Physical, Technical, and Administrative. = Physical controls = Physical controls are anything that physically limits or prevents access to IT systems. Fences, guards, dogs, and CCTV systems and the like. = Technical controls = Technical controls are hardware or software whose purpose is to protect systems and resources. Examples of technical controls would be disk encryption, fingerprint readers, and authentication. Hardware technical controls differ from physical controls in that they prevent access to the contents of a system, but not the physical systems themselves. = Administrative controls = Administrative controls are an organization's policies and procedures. Their purpose is to ensure that there is proper guidance available in regards to security and that regulations are met. They include things such as hiring practices, data handling procedures, and security requirements. Examples Using more than one of the following layers constitutes an example of defense in depth. System/application security: * Antivirus software * Authentication and password security * Encryption * Hashing passwords * Logging and auditing * Multi-factor authentication * Vulnerability scanners * Timed access control * Internet Security Awareness Training * Sandboxing * Intrusion detection systems (IDS) Network security: * Firewalls (hardware or software) * Demilitarized zones (DMZ) * Virtual private network (VPN) Physical security: * Biometrics * Data- centric security * Physical security (e.g. deadbolt locks) Practical example: an application is written by security-aware developers in a memory-safe language and then audited. Despite the security measures already listed, the application is also executed in a sandbox. Furthermore, the hosts running such application are isolated from other critical systems using Firewalls.

Allen was born in Bedford and attended Bedford School. A right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler, he started his cricket career at Northamptonshire, who finished in fourth position in the County Championship in his debut season, 1956. Allen debuted against Worcestershire in May and played in more than half the matches in the season. In 1957, Allen moved into a regular first-team place and finished high in the bowling averages, as Northamptonshire finished second in the County Championship table. During the early part of 1958, Allen played two matches for Marylebone Cricket Club. He played for Northamptonshire throughout the 1958 County Championship season, where, once again, the team played strongly, finishing in fourth position in the table. In 1959, with the emergence of the leg-spin bowler Peter Watts, he played less often in the first team. The retirement of the spin bowlers George Tribe at the end of the 1959 season and Jack Manning in 1960 gave Allen more opportunities and he played consistently for Northamptonshire until the end of the 1963 season. Northamptonshire finished seventh in the 1963 County Championship table, an improvement on their second- bottom table showing the previous season. Allen moved to Derbyshire for the opening of the 1964 season, debuting against Glamorgan in an almost playless match. He represented Derbyshire for two more years, before quitting first- class cricket. Allen was a consistent bowler, accruing five-wicket bowling hauls in eight individual seasons, and securing ten wickets in an individual match three times. He was a lower-order batsman during his Northamptonshire career, switching to the tailend on occasion while playing for Derbyshire. Allen died in Lancaster in 1995.

In a newspaper article, USA Today called him the \\"poster child for everything that went wrong in the real estate boom\\". Born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, Serin immigrated to the United States in 1994. After graduating from high school, Serin bounced from job to job, generally working in website design. However, in his early twenties, Serin decided to quit working full-time in order to pursue a career in house flipping as a means of earning an income and building wealth. In an eight-month period beginning in October 2005, Serin purchased eight houses in four southwest U.S. states, and then began blogging about the foreclosure process on the properties he was unable to resell. In time, five of the eight properties foreclosed. The dubious nature of Serin's real estate transactions, coupled with his subsequent blogging about the affair, have led to Serin's name becoming strongly associated with the subprime mortgage crisis. Background Between October 2005 and May 2006, Serin purchased eight single-family homes using stated income loans. These loans required no documentation of income, nor any down payments. Before quitting his web design position in January 2006, Serin claimed an over-inflated income (roughly five times his actual pay) on his loan applications, reasoning that many other borrowers were using similar strategies to obtain mortgages for which they would not otherwise qualify. He continued to claim the same income on loan applications completed after he had quit his job. Serin stated that several of the properties were purchased with owner-occupied loans; these generally provide more favorable terms than loans for investment properties. A Voice of San Diego article suggests that Serin's initial loans may not have appeared in credit reports pulled for subsequent loans because he purchased properties in several states over a relatively brief period, so that \\"the banks couldn't trace the pending loan documents to check up on his story.\\" Serin received cash back at closing on six of the properties, sometimes exceeding California's legal maximum of three percent of the selling price. A contributor to the Scotsman Guide, a trade publication for the mortgage industry, stated in an article discussing fraudulent practices within the mortgage industry, that the largest amount of cash Serin received for a transaction was $50,000, and that the money was paid either to the seller or a third-party company (which the contributor alleges was bogus), and then returned to Serin after closing. The author, CEO and senior legal counsel of Investors Mortgage Asset Recovery Co. LLC, concludes that responsibility for fraud in cases such as Serin's lies with \\"everyone who knew about the undisclosed cash and knowingly assisted in the scheme, including the sellers and any real estate agents, appraisers or closing agents.\\" Serin disclosed on a Sacramento news program that he likely would not have been able to qualify for loans under more traditional terms. Despite already being deeply in debt, in late 2006, Serin borrowed $16,000 to purchase a week-long real estate seminar course purporting to teach \\"creative financing\\"CNN Money. Money.cnn.com (August 8, 2007). Retrieved on 2017-01-09. at Nouveau Riche University (NRU) in Phoenix.Garnham, Jonathan. (May 14, 2007) CNET. News.cnet.com. Retrieved on 2017-01-09. Jim Piccolo, the founder of NRU, was later fined a record $6 million in 2011 by the Arizona Corporation Commission for running a fraudulent real estate investment scheme.Arizona Corporation Commission press release Months later, as the United States housing bubble began to rapidly deflate, Serin became unable to pay the mortgages or sell the properties; at one point, he estimated that he was approximately $2.2 million in debt, with a net worth around negative $600,000. Serin's house buying spree ultimately ended when a lender rejected a loan application for what would have been his ninth property, after discovering his blog. Because of the sheer magnitude of Serin's debt and the improbability of his story, some observers had initially questioned its veracity, alleging that the blog was either performance art or a viral marketing campaign. An article at The Motley Fool expressed doubt over \\"whether or not this [isn't] just a somewhat elaborate hoax.\\". However, public records confirm that Serin did purchase the properties in question and did subsequently default on most of the mortgages. Foreclosure blog and media attention In September 2006, Serin started the blog IamFacingForeclosure describing his situation, with the idea of both soliciting advise and warning others how to avoid the mistakes he had made. Interest in the blog first developed among readers of other blogs devoted to the United States housing bubble. His story was featured in numerous media outlets—among them, USA Today, National Public Radio, New York magazine, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Economist, The Suze Orman Show, and ABC's Nightline. When Serin first started the blog, commenters were generally supportive, hoping that Serin would make a good faith effort to avoid foreclosure and pay back any remaining debts by looking for work. The initial media exposure largely lauded Serin as an example of forthright blogging, without delving very deeply into the origin of his debts. Also, in 2006 Casey Serin appeared on \\"Rich Dad's Online Business School\\" where Casey Serin told his story to Robert Kiyosaki and the members of his audience. During the ensuing 9 months that the blog was updated, Serin generally let his problems stagnate—urgent mail went unopened, the houses went into foreclosure one by one, and Serin did not actively look for work. The overall tone of the blog's comments gradually went from encouraging Serin to openly deriding him for his inaction, his apparent nonchalant attitude towards his financial issues, and his role in the then-emerging subprime mortgage crisis. In May 2007, CNET.com writer Declan McCullagh published an article about Serin's story and the largely negative reactions Serin's blog was garnering from commenters, referring to Serin as \\"the world's most hated blogger\\" and describing his blog as \\"irritainment.\\" McCullagh wrote that \\"Casey's blog has an enthusiastic – if unrelentingly critical – audience known as 'haterz'.\\" Serin acknowledged that he began to purposely anger readers in an effort to drive further traffic to the blog. Over time, the blog developed a cult status, as Serin began writing about the toll his actions were taking on his personal life. The spectre of legal ramifications also factored heavily into the blog. Many commenters stated that they were attracted to the increasingly \\"soap opera\\"-like nature of Serin's story, and the blog was featured on a number of sites devoted to so-called \\"trainwreck watching.\\" =Fate of the blog= In April 2007, Serin appeared on The Suze Orman Show to discuss his financial predicament. Orman recommended that Serin file for bankruptcy and attempt to increase his take- home pay. However, Serin continued to make no effort to secure full-time employment, nor did he file bankruptcy; a bankruptcy attorney had told Serin that he would open himself to potential charges of mortgage fraud if he filed for bankruptcy, since the debts were acquired under fraudulent pretenses. The final months of his blog saw further erratic behavior by Serin, including a June 2007 spur-of-the-moment flight to Australia without informing his wife or family members. Regarding his multiple mortgages, Serin acknowledged to the Sydney Morning Herald that \\"the stuff I did is technically mortgage fraud, but it's not officially called that until someone prosecutes me and proves that that is indeed mortgage fraud,\\" asserting a presumption of innocence. While in Australia, Casey Serin appeared on Top Shelf Radio with Robbie Buck. On the Jon Ronson show, Serin again confirmed his use of so-called \\"liar loans\\". On July 11, 2007, Serin disclosed that he was under investigation by the FBI. In an interview conducted by ABC News, his attorney reported that Casey Serin was under investigation by the FBI, but that \\"no charges have been brought against Mr. Serin. However, based upon conversations with the U.S. Attorney's office in California, federal charges related to Mr. Serin's real estate transactions are expected to be brought against him\\". Shortly thereafter, Serin said in a mass e-mailing that he would be closing the blog and getting a \\"regular W-2 job,\\" citing the stress his family has experienced. Serin's final blog entry on July 28, 2007 was dedicated to his wife. The blog was purchased by the owner of ml-implode.com. Serin says he used proceeds from the sale to pay off $35,000 of consumer credit debt in his wife's name. Although Serin retained an attorney in July 2007 and stated that he was under investigation by the FBI, Serin has never been officially charged with any crime. =Legal change of name= In 2016, Serin legally changed his name to Casey Constantine. In Facebook comments, he stated that the name change is a sort of rebranding for the next chapter of his career/business in real estate, and that it will allow him much more control over his search results online, somewhat of a clean slate.

Roman era tombs were found in the area in 1938. The Sarmatian, Celtic, and Roman tombs were located near the church and the area appears to have been the frontier between Roman and Sarmation lands at the time. Avars immigrated into the area in 567AD and Hungarian Magyars in 896AD. The Ottoman Empire took the town in 1566AD but by the 17th century it was in Habsburg hands. The City Hall was built around 1660, and remains today despite being damaged during World War II. Cholera swept the city in the 19th century and in 1843 Hajdúdorog was divided into the seven municipalities. The town's history is presented in the Museum of Local History. Religion Bishop consecration of István Miklósy (1913) Traditionally the area was Catholic; however, since the beginning of the 20th century, the majority of the city has been from the Hungarian Greek Catholic Church, in contrast to the surrounding area. The differences in religion have created a distinct local culture. =Catholic= The city is the seat of the Hungarian Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Hajdúdorog. The Greek Catholic Cathedral is one of the city's main points of interest with its 200-year-old icons. =Jewish= Jewish cemetery, Hajdudorog Before the Second World War, the city was home to a large Jewish population, located predominantly in three streets near the edge of town. A memorial to the community is located near the centre of the town. There had been some anti- Semitism through the 1930s; however, when Nazi Germany invaded Hungary on 19 March 1944, Jewish businesses were closed and ghettoisation began. On 16 October 1944 the Red Army started the so-called lowland armored battle and took the city on October 24.Számvéber, Norbert. Páncélosok a Tiszántúlon, Az alföldi páncéloscsata 1944 októberében.

It was illustrated using casein paint, and won the Caldecott Medal for illustration in 1953.American Library Association: Caldecott Medal Winners, 1938 - Present. URL accessed 27 May 2009. Background The Biggest Bear was the first children's picture book for which Ward was both author and illustrator. He rendered the illustrations in casein paint. Ward set the story in the backwoods of Northern Ontario, an area he was familiar with as his parents had taken him to Sault Ste. Marie when he was a boy so he could recover from tuberculosis. Thereafter the family summered at a lake near Echo Bay, not far from the US–Canada border. Plot Johnny Orchard, a young boy, is jealous because his neighbors have bear pelts hanging on their barns, so he takes a rifle and goes hunting for the biggest bear in the valley. However, when he finds only a bear cub, he befriends it by feeding it maple sugar and brings the bear home as a pet. As it grows, it becomes a nuisance to his family and the neighbors due to its enormous appetite. After the neighbors complain to his father, Johnny tries three times to return the bear to the woods. Each time the bear follows Johnny back home. Finally, Johnny and his father decide the only way to solve the problem is to shoot the bear. Johnny takes the bear far into the woods, but while loading his rifle, the bear runs off and into a live trap that has maple sugar in it. Men who had set the trap to capture animals for the zoo soon come. They take Johnny's bear to a zoo where Johnny can visit him anytime he wants to.

RAVEN (1926-2020) was an American academic. He was a member of the faculty of the psychology department at UCLA from 1956 until his death. He is perhaps best known for his early work in collaboration with John R. P. French, with whom he developed an analysis of the five bases of social power. Life and career Born in Youngstown, Ohio, he received his BA and MA (1948, 1949) in psychology from Ohio State University and his PhD (1953) in social psychology from the University of Michigan. At UCLA, he was also director of the Survey Research Center, director of a training program in health psychology, and chair of the Department of Psychology. He served as a visiting professor and lecturer at the University of Nijmegen, Netherlands; Hebrew University of Jerusalem; London School of Economics; University of Washington; and University of Hawaii; as well as external examiner for the University of the West Indies. His interests centered particularly on interpersonal influence and social power relationships which developed out of his original work on social power. That early work expanded to a broader reaching Power/Interaction Model of Interpersonal Influence. The model and theory has been applied to organizational power relationships, health psychology (e.g., compliance in health care), close relationships, educational settings. Historical and political analyses have applied the model to power confrontations between political figures and religion as a mechanism of social control. A Power/Interaction Inventory has been developed which will allow for cross- cultural comparisons. Such research is facilitated with an internet system which involves collaborating researchers in 14 different nations.Social Psychology, professional profile For his contributions, Raven received such awards and recognition as Fulbright Scholar, NATO Fellow, Guggenheim Fellow, NIMH Fellow, Kurt Lewin Awardee (for relating social psychological research and social action), and a Los Angeles City Council Citation (for developing the UCLA Upward Bound Project).UCLA Department of Psychology, faculty profile Raven was married to an Englishwoman, Celia Raven, from 1961 until his death.

The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company ordered two sister ships, RMS Maloja and , from Harland and Wolff Ltd on 29 November 1918. Hull number 588 was named Maloja, after a previous that was a 1911 M-class liner that had been sunk by a German mine in 1916. The interior design was in keeping with the high standards of the Line. The public rooms were luxurious, completely decorated and lofty. All first and second class cabins had portholes. The dining saloon seated 330; it was panelled in a neo-Georgian style, finished throughout in ivory white, with the doors and architraves in polished mahogany. The reading and music saloon was in the style of Louis XVI with large French windows. RMS Maloja was launched by Hon. Elsie Mackay, daughter of the company's chairman James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape, on 19 April 1923. Maloja and Mooltan eventually earned a reputation for comfort and reliability. Maloja was delivered on 25 October 1923. The two sister ships were the largest that could comfortably pass through the Suez Canal at that time. Maiden voyage A P&O; poster of the era On 2 November 1923 RMS Maloja began her maiden voyage. Her design had prioritised reliability and comfort over speed. She had broad decks and rode steadily, although (because of a small rudder) she would prove difficult to handle. On 18 January 1924 the two ships began running the fortnightly service between Tilbury and Sydney via Colombo and Melbourne. In November 1923 Maloja was caught in a dockworkers' strike in Australia and after a delayed departure was forced to abandon 6,000 tons of cargo left on the dockside. In March 1933 Maloja ran aground in Adelaide but was re-floated without sustaining significant damage. In January 1933 Maloja was in Gibraltar Bay, loading cargo from a lighter in severe weather. An anchor and of chain pulled free and were lost. Wartime requisition On 11 September 1939 Maloja was requisitioned by the Admiralty and converted to an armed merchant cruiser in Bombay, India. The conversion included having one funnel removed, to increase her anti-aircraft guns' arc of fire. After the conversion she joined the Northern Patrol as HMS Maloja (F26). The Northern Patrol covered the area between Shetland and Iceland. On 13 March 1940 Maloja intercepted a ship southeast of Iceland in position 63.00N, 10.20W, which claimed to be the Japanese vessel Taki Maru. Malojas captain suspected otherwise, but he was unable to send a boarding party due to the adverse weather conditions. As the weather cleared it became clear that the unknown vessel was the German La Coruña of the Hamburg-South America Line. The German crew scuttled her to evade capture, and after they had abandoned ship and been picked out of the water by the British crew, Maloja turned her guns on the German ship and hastened its sinking. On 6 November 1941 Maloja was returned to P&O; and was converted to troopship duty. A shorter version of the funnel was re-installed. Described by one passenger, as \\"very crowded\\" (with troops) she sailed from Liverpool on 28 July 1942 for Calcutta, but heading first for Greenock on the Firth of Clyde (arriving 29 July) to join the rest of the convoy, which included seven battleships and destroyers. The convoy left the Clyde on 30 July. On Monday, 10 August the Maloja anchored at Freetown, Sierra Leone until 15 August. While at Freetown the convoy was joined by two battleships, and a further three US ships joined on 18 August. She put in at Cape Town on 27 August and left on the 30th. She arrived in Calcutta on 19 September 1942. In December 1942, some weeks after Operation Torch, she took Allied troops to North Africa. According to the records of No.255 Squadron, RAF, the vessel sailed from Liverpool at 13:00 on 27 November 1942. The voyage was uneventful, encountering no enemy action of any kind and little by way of rough weather. The Maloja anchored off Algiers early on 06 December but disembarkation there was cancelled and the vessel proceeded eastwards towards Bône, arriving at 11:00 hours the next day.The National Archives of the UK : File AIR27/1518 folios 110-117 inclusive. Peacetime and the return to commercial service On 15 January 1947 Maloja was returned to P&O; and was berthed at the Royal Albert Dock in London for full civilian reconditioning, by R & H Green & Silley Weir. Both Maloja and Mooltan were returned to service. After the independence of the Republic of Indonesia in 1948 Dutch civilians were repatriated to the Netherlands. In August 1950 Maloja helped with the repatriations, which were completed by 1951. On 19 January 1954 Maloja arrived at Tilbury, London, on her last voyage. Fate On 2 April 1954 she was moved to Inverkeithing, Scotland, where she was broken up for scrap. The British Iron & Steel Corporation paid £165,000 for her; the scrap work was performed by Thos W Ward Ltd.

He first appeared in the mockumentary entitled, Full Disclosure Report: Piecing Together Jigsaw, featured on the uncut version of the original film. He appears in Saw II, Saw III, and Saw IV. It was originally stated that Donnie Wahlberg (who portrayed Eric Matthews) would not be reprising his role in Saw III due to creative differences, but this turned out to be a hoax conceived by Lions Gate Entertainment to throw off fans of the series trying to dig up details on the film.Dorchester Atheneum: Donnie Wahlberg Appearances =Saw - Full Disclosure Report= Eric's first appearance was in the fake documentary titled \\"Full Disclosure Report\\" which was featured on the Saw: Uncut DVD. A reporter stated that Mathews' extensive force and bad temper might be one factor that was holding police back from solving the Jigsaw case. A clip of Eric entering his car was shown as a reporter asked Eric for some information on the case, also asking about the reports of Eric's brutality. Eric responded by pulling out his gun and yelling, \\"What brutality?\\". A fellow officer then pulled Eric back to his car. =Saw II= Eric appeared in Saw II as the father of Daniel Matthews, and as an ex-detective doing desk work. He was called to the scene of one of the Jigsaw Killer's recently discovered games, where Eric was asked by his ex-partner, Detective Allison Kerry, to identify the victim, who turned out to be Michael, a police informant used by Eric. While leaving the scene, Kerry pointed out a message written on the ceiling, which stated, \\"LOOK CLOSER DETECTIVE MATTHEWS.\\" Annoyed with Kerry for bringing him to the scene to be goaded into the investigation by the message, Eric announced that he had enough work to do, while having to deal with his wife's divorce lawyers. Later, while trying to sleep, Eric remembered the brand name of a padlock used on the device that killed Michael. With this information, he decided to tag along with Kerry and SWAT Commander Daniel Rigg to an old warehouse that they believed to be Jigsaw's latest lair. Finally coming face to face with Jigsaw inside, Eric was put into a test. Eric was told that he had a problem to deal with, and uncovered numerous computer monitors that displayed a camera feed that showed his son, along with seven others, being held captive in a house. Confronting Jigsaw, Eric was told that Daniel was in danger of the nerve gas that was being pumped into the house, but that if Eric were to sit and have a conversation with Jigsaw for long enough, he would get his son back. Eric, under advice from Kerry, reluctantly sat and began his test. During his conversations with Jigsaw, it was revealed that Eric had once been a ruthless and brutal police officer who used extreme measures to complete his assignments, going so far as to plant evidence on suspects and shoot down unarmed suspects. However, Jigsaw seemed to state that Eric at least felt alive during those times, but was now cowering behind a desk. Eric eventually left the conversation with Jigsaw to watch his son's progression through the house with the seven strangers, only being convinced by Kerry, who was revealed to at one point to have been Eric's mistress, to threaten Jigsaw's work as a way to find his son's location. When that did nothing, Jigsaw revealed that the seven strangers in the house with Daniel were in fact seven ex-convicts who had been arrested by Eric after being framed with false evidence. Eric, under Rigg's advice, began to aggressively attack Jigsaw, punching and kicking him repeatedly and breaking his finger in order to find out where his son was being held. Jigsaw stated that Eric's game was over, and that he would take Eric to the house. Together, they escaped from the building without Eric's team, and drove away in a van. Jigsaw gave Eric directions to the house along the way. Leaving Jigsaw in the van, Eric went through the back door of the house, and found the corpses inside in a state of decay, as if having been there for an extended period of time. He managed to get into the foundation of the house, where he stumbled across the bathroom from the first film, where his son had already been to. Expecting to find Daniel there, Eric was attacked by Amanda Young, dressed in a pig mask, and rendered unconscious. It was revealed that the feed of the house that Eric had seen was not in fact live, but had been a recording. Daniel had been locked in a safe that had sat a few feet away from Jigsaw during Eric's test. When Eric woke up, he was shackled by the ankle to a pipe in the bathroom with his gun unloaded and his flashlight out of reach. Amanda revealed herself to be Jigsaw's apprentice before sliding the door shut, leaving Eric to die. =Saw III= Eric managed to free himself from his shackle in Saw III, mere minutes after having been locked away, by smashing and breaking his foot to the point that it could slip through. Flashbacks later in the film showed him escaping the bathroom. Limping through the basement hallways, screaming for his son, Eric quickly passed Amanda, who hid herself and began panicking. Eric attacked Amanda and severely beat her with ease, despite his injuries. When he demanded to know where Daniel was, Amanda spat in Eric's face and kicked his broken foot, then began to walk away. Eric taunted her, saying, \\"You're not Jigsaw, bitch!\\", which prompted her to turn back toward him. It is unknown what she did next, but she seemed to believe that Eric was dead as she told Jigsaw that she \\"returned the favor\\" for him taking her life from her. Jigsaw corrected her, saying that he had cleaned up her mistakes. He is also spoken of by Kerry during the film, describing the guilt that she felt after his disappearance and having hallucinations of him. =Saw IV= Eric in Saw IV. It is revealed in this film (which takes place concurrently with Saw III) that Eric had been missing for six months. As Daniel Rigg began his own series of tests, he learned that Eric was still alive. Flashbacks show that after he taunted Amanda, she did not kill Eric and instead beat him unconscious out of anger. He was dragged into a cell by another man, where he was imprisoned until the time came for Rigg's tests. During this time, he was supplied with food and a heavy iron brace for his crushed foot. He and Mark Hoffman (the man who imprisoned him) were at opposite ends of a seesaw scale; Eric stood on a slowly melting block of ice with a chain-noose around his neck, while Hoffman was strapped into a chair with an electrode by his feet. If Eric slipped off the ice, he would be hanged and the runoff water would tip to Hoffman's end and electrocute him. Tired of being used as a pawn, Eric was ready to give up, saying \\"I don't want to play anymore\\" and twice attempting suicide by jumping off the block. These attempts were thwarted by Art Blank, another man in the test who was forced to watch over Eric and Mark. Once the 90-minute timer for Rigg's tests had run out, Art would be able to release them and himself. Eric realized that if the door was opened ahead of time, two large ice blocks would swing down from the ceiling and crush his head. Art gave him a gun and one bullet with which to stop anyone from coming in. As Rigg approached the door, Eric shot out through it and hit him in the stomach. Rigg entered the room with one second to spare, releasing the ice blocks and killing Eric. =Saw V= His picture is on display at a memorial for the officers who had died during the Jigsaw case. =Removed and altered content= Eric had originally been written to be killed by Amanda in Saw III after she marched back towards him after his taunts. In the original script, Amanda had stabbed and slashed Eric repeatedly in the neck, killing him. According to the Saw III DVD commentaries, this scene was filmed but removed against the director's will from the movie, so that he could be kept alive for Saw IV, since the other main characters of the franchise were killed off.Saw III DVD commentary Characterization During an interview, Wahlberg offered his opinion of Matthews: In the same interview, Wahlberg commented on the appeal of playing this character: References Category:Saw (franchise) characters Category:Fictional American police detectives Category:Film characters introduced in 2004 Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping Category:Police misconduct in fiction Category:Male horror film characters ","title":"Eric Matthews (Saw)"},{"id":"7991438","text":"The Chinese American Bank (中美銀行) was an overseas Chinese bank in the United States headquartered in New York City, with branch offices in Chinatown, Manhattan and in Chinatown, Flushing.

Craig, Bernard Maybeck at Principia College, p.478, Gibbs Smith; 2004 and other supportJack Quinan, Frank Lloyd Wright's Martin House, p.216, Princeton Architectural Press; 2004Caroline Knight, Frank Lloyd Wright, p. 124, Parragon; 2004. to Wright as his career unfolded. In the early years of their long relationship, Darwin Martin was actively involved with the selection of Frank Lloyd Wright as the architect for the Larkin Administration Building, Wright's first major commercial project. Martin was an executive with the Larkin Company, and Wright also designed houses in Buffalo for fellow Larkin Company executives William R. Heath and Walter V. Davidson. Isabelle R. Martin was the client of record for Graycliff, and it was designed by Wright for her pleasure.Brendan Gill, Many Masks, p.320, Da Capo Press; 1998http://graycliff.bfn.org/history/history.html Graycliff is one of only five of Frank Lloyd Wright’s designs that were built between 1925 and 1935, and the only Wright designed structure built between Taliesin (1925) and Fallingwater (1936) using stone. Wright believed stone to be the only true building material and may be why he insisted the Martins incorporate it at Graycliff. Graycliff is considered to be one of Wright's most important mid- career works in his Organic Style.  Design  Graycliff is a complex of three buildings integrated within an landscape. It is sited high on a bluff with views of Lake Erie across to Ontario. The buildings, in Wright’s Organic Architecture style, are set amidst extensive grounds and gardens also designed by Wright. The largest building, the Isabelle R. Martin House, is perhaps most remarkable for its two stone veneered sections framing a central pavilion-like center of transparent glass walls, allowing visitors to actually see through the building itself to the lake beyond, revolutionary for a 1926 design. It also features spacious cantilevered balconies, expansive terraces, and \\"ribbons\\" of windows that allow the experience of nature from within and through the house. On especially clear days the spray of Niagara Falls is visible through the framed opening created by the cantilevered upper bridge and the stone veneered massing at each end of the home. The Foster House. The Foster House was originally designed as a garageWilliam A Storrer, The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright, p.230, University of Chicago Press; 2002 with an apartment above for the chauffeur and his family. In 1929 the Martins owned a Pierce-Arrow touring car as well as a Detroit Electric car. After their first summer in residence, the Martins asked Wright to alter and expand the building. Once complete, the Martin’s daughter Dorothy, together with her husband James Foster and their children Margaret and Darwin Martin Foster, spent many happy summers in residence. Like the Martin House, the Foster House has strong horizontal lines echoing the lake beyond, cantilevered balconies, and numerous windows. Fountain, Graycliff The smallest building of the complex is known as the Heat Hut. Like the other two buildings, it is constructed of stone found at the lake’s edge, ochre stucco, and a red cedar shingle roof. Garden walls, composed of the same stone and stucco as the Foster and Martin Houses, enhance the horizontal planes of the architecture. The gardens and grounds feature water elements designed by Wright, including a porte cochere that extends from Martin House, cantilevering beyond its stone pier supports over a stone basin from which water flows into a large irregularly shaped pool. This was intended to create an illusion of the lake flowing through the house. On the west side, a broad esplanade connects the terrace to the cliff and lake. The esplanade was designed to carry water, pumped from Lake Erie, down its length and over the bluffs, completing the illusion of water flowing through. Deemed financially extravagant this feature was halted after only the esplanade itself was completed. Other architectural features of the landscape include a sunken garden, a hidden garden, and stone walls in a \\"waterfall\\" pattern. Not surprisingly, it was Darwin Martin who first introduced Wright to Niagara Falls, less than forty miles to the north. The extensive of grounds and gardens were also designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, with one of the few, if not only, landscape designs in his own hand. These include a tennis court designed by Wright, as well as trees and shrubs designed to complement the architecture. Additional significant design-work was done by Ellen Biddle Shipman, one of the early and renowned women landscape architects, and one of the creators of the Arts & Crafts and American Craftsman style landscape design, supplemented those of Wright with colorful flowers and a picking garden.  Restoration  Although the Martin family lost much of its fortune due to the Great Depression and was forced to abandon the city house in 1937, they kept Graycliff, and returned annually until 1943. The property was purchased from the family by the Piarists, a Roman Catholic teaching order, in 1951. The Piarist Fathers, from Hungary, established a boarding school on the grounds, as well as Calasanctius, a private high school for gifted children in Buffalo, named after the order's founder. Although they added two structures to Wright’s original design, all Wright-designed buildings were left intact. Eventually enrollment dwindled and the schools closed; the number of priests in residence also declined dramatically. Finally in late 1997, the Piarists decided they could no longer afford to maintain the property, and put it up for sale. Soon after, a group of concerned individuals purchased the property, which was threatened with destruction due to its prime lakeside location and attractiveness to private developers. The group formed the non-profit Graycliff Conservancy in order to buy the property, restore it to its original condition, and open it to the public. This effort, aided by volunteers from throughout the community, has undertaken extensive restoration, both to remove the non-Wright additions and to restore the nearly ninety-year-old buildings, and has created a schedule of public tours. The Graycliff Conservancy is the recipient of a Save America’s Treasures grant from the US Department of the Interior, and has received many awards for its work. Graycliff is now a New York State Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Gallery  File:Isabelle R.

Confederate Brigadier General Henry Heth had been sent north to threaten Cincinnati, then the sixth-largest city in the United States. Heth was under orders from his superior, Major General Edmund Kirby Smith, not to attack the city, but to instead make a \\"demonstration\\".\\"About midnight, he [Smith] came to my room and said I might take such and such brigades and make a demonstration on Cincinnati.\\" Heth, p. 166. Cincinnati's mayor George Hatch ordered all business closed, and Union Major General Lew Wallace declared martial law, seized sixteen steamboats and had them armed,OR, Series I, Volume 52, Part I, p. 281-282. and organized the citizens of Cincinnati, Covington, and Newport, Kentucky for defense. Among the groups organized were the \\"Black Brigade of Cincinnati\\", a forcibly conscripted group of free African Americans. Although not armed, the Black Brigade was given its own flag and paid $13 for one month's service, the same pay given to privates at that time. They built fortifications, including miles of military roads, breastworks, forts, and rifle pits along the northern Kentucky border from Fort Thomas, Kentucky, where Union soldiers were stationed, to Bromley. Hundreds of acres of forest were cleared. The fortifications were defended by 25,000 Union Army soldiers and 45,000 local militia volunteers. Further defensive support of more than 15,000 men was provided by the so-called \\"Squirrel Hunters\\"--untrained volunteers from other parts of Ohio who carried outdated equipment. Construction of the defenses was directed by Colonel Charles Whittlesey until relieved by Major James H. Simpson, chief of Topographical Engineers for the Department of the Ohio. On September 5, Ohio governor David Tod announced to the public that no additional volunteers would be needed for the defense of Cincinnati, but he advised that all military organizations be kept up for future needs. Heth and his men marched from Lexington, Kentucky on the Lexington Turnpike (present- day U.S. Route 25), arriving south of Covington on September 6. After reconnoitering the defenses at various points, he determined that an attack was pointless. Heth's forces stayed only a few days, skirmishing with members of the 101st Ohio Infantry, 103rd Ohio Infantry and 104th Ohio Infantry near Fort Mitchel on September 10–11https://sparedshared5.wordpress.com/2014/03/09/186-charles-l-bonney-to- friend/ and returning south to Lexington on September 12, 1862.Pinney, p. 7-8. On September 12, Wallace telegraphed Major General Horatio Wright (commander of the Department of the Ohio) in Cincinnati: \\"The skedaddle is complete; every sign of a rout. If you say so I will organize a column of 20,000 men to pursue to-night.\\" The large pursuit was never ordered as most of the military forces were sent via steamboats to Louisville, Kentucky to prevent capture by General Braxton Bragg. However, small scouting forces were sent southward to harass the rear-guard of Heth's forces. A skirmish occurred at Florence, Kentucky, on September 17.A force of 53 Union cavalry engaged 101 Confederates. 1 Union man and 5 Confederates were killed and 1 Union soldier and 7 Confederates were wounded. Additionally, one civilian (Larkin Vaughn) was killed by a stray shot. Another skirmish occurred near Walton, Kentucky on September 25, when Colonel Basil W. Duke attacked a Union camp of approximately 500 men near Snow's Pond. For his vigorous defense of the city, Wallace earned the nickname \\"Savior of Cincinnati\\". Within a month of the panic, the Squirrel Hunters returned to their homes.Ohio History Central Fortifications built by the Black Brigade Henry Mosler, Preparations for Defense at Cincinnati, sketch, Harper’s Weekly, September 20, 1862 Seven hundred and six members of the Black Brigade of Cincinnati built fortifications in Kentucky to protect Cincinnati from attack by Confederate soldiers. They had no weapons and only had a few cavalry scouts between them and Confederate troops. The brigade worked until September 20, when there was no longer a threat to Cincinnati. When they were done, hundreds of acres of forests had been cleared and miles of rifle pits were dug. They had built forts, magazines, and miles of military roads and breastworks along the border with Northern Kentucky between Fort Thomas and Bromley. The fortifications were built far enough away from Cincinnati that they could not shell the city. The defenses In September 1862, only five batteries were extant in Kenton County and only three in Campbell County, all having been constructed in 1861. Two batteries protecting the city's flanks were located on hills at the west and east sides of Cincinnati. Altogether, the defenses were armed with just 15 heavy guns. When Wallace moved his headquarters from Cincinnati to Kentucky, he selected the main building at the Thompson Winery that was designated Fort Henry, although no earthworks were ever constructed on the site. It was the approximate center of the line of fortifications and telegraph lines connected each of the earthwork positions with his headquarters. Following the threat, many more batteries and forts were constructed through November 1864, mostly under the direction of Major James H. Simpson.see Walden, \\"Panic on the Ohio! Part IV\\" for details on the fortifications. =Kentucky batteries= Note: Unless otherwise noted, all traces of these earthworks are gone. Kenton County * J. L. Kirby Smith Battery - Located in the southwest area of modern Ludlow. It was named for Colonel Joseph L. Kirby Smith, 43rd Ohio Infantry, who was mortally wounded at the Second Battle of Corinth, October 1862. * Coombs Battery - Believed to be named for Leslie Coombs, a member of Wallace's staff. Remains of this battery are found in Covington's Devou Park. * Bates Battery - Brigadier General Joshua Hall Bates, chairman of the Cincinnati Committee for Public Safety, was the namesake for this battery. Well-preserved, Bates Battery is located in Devou Park, but is difficult to reach. * Perry Battery - Named for Cincinnati attorney Aaron F. Perry. Traces are located on private property. * Rich Battery - Named for Stephen Rich, landowner of the site. This position was built in 1861 and by the time of Heth's threat, it was considered out of position and unusable. It was referred to as \\"Old Battery\\" on military maps. * Fort Mitchel - Constructed in 1861 and named for Major General Ormsby M. Mitchel, who originally directed the construction of Cincinnati's defenses in November 1861. (The city of Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, chartered in 1909, derives its name from both the fort and the general, although misspelling his name.) The fort was greatly expanded in 1863–1864. Today, only the road leading up to the fort remains. * Kyle Battery - Located immediately northeast of Fort Mitchel on a farm owned by Robert S. Kyle. Site destroyed by construction of Interstate 75. * McRae Battery - Named for Captain Alexander McRae, 3rd United States Cavalry, killed in action at the Battle of Valverde, New Mexico Territory, in February 1862. * Fort Wright - Constructed in 1863, this fortification was left uncompleted in 1864. Designed for thirteen heavy guns, Fort Wright could cover all of the ground from the front of Kyle Battery eastward to the Licking River. It was named for Major General Horatio Wright, commander of the Department of the Ohio. The city of Fort Wright, Kentucky derives its name from this fortification. * Hooper Battery - Initially designated Kyle Battery, it was along the same ridge as McRae. The site of the battery was covered over with earth to make a level back yard for a private home that is now the James A. Ramage Civil War Museum. * Carlisle Battery - Named for local attorney and politician John G. Carlisle. * Burbank Battery - Named for Lieutenant Colonel Sidney Burbank, who was military commander of Cincinnati. (Burbank was promoted to colonel, September 16, 1862.) * Hatch Battery - Alternately known as Brickyard Battery, it was named for Cincinnati's mayor George H. Hatch. * Buford Battery - Constructed in 1863 and dually named for Kentucky half-brothers and generals Napoleon Bonaparte Buford and John Buford. This position was selected to command the ground from Fort Wright to Holt Battery in Campbell County. * Burnet Battery - First known as Quarry Battery, it was renamed for Robert W. Burnet, commander of a local militia unit from the Cincinnati Literary Club, known as the Burnet Rifles. * Anderson Battery - First known as Tunnel Battery, due to being located directly above a railroad tunnel (still in use), it was renamed for Larz Anderson, a Cincinnati businessman, married to Catherine Longworth, daughter of Nicholas Longworth. Larz was the brother of Brevet Major General Robert Anderson of Fort Sumter.The Descendants of Richard Clough Anderson, compiled and produced by Don Perry, Feb 1, 2017 Minor traces of this earthwork and a few rifle pits can still be seen. Campbell County * Wiggins Battery - This position overlooked the Licking River valley and was named for Samuel Wiggins, a Cincinnati banker and realtor. It was also known as John's Hill Battery. * Holt Battery - Originally known as Three Mile Creek Battery and alternately as Licking Point Battery, it was named for Major General Joseph Holt, Judge Advocate General of the Army. This easily accessible earthwork is owned by Vista Pointe Apartments in Wilder, Kentucky; residential construction has destroyed much of the original site. * McLean Battery - Also known as Locust Hill Battery, it was named for Major Nathaniel H. McLean, Chief of Staff for the Department of the Ohio. * Harrison Battery - Believed to have been named for Montgomery Pike Harrison an Indiana officer killed in Texas by Indians in 1849. * Shaler Battery - Located on property owned by Dr. Nathaniel B. Shaler, chief surgeon of the Newport Barracks, and then in use as a vineyard but adjacent to Evergreen Cemetery. Today, the cemetery encompasses the entire Shaler property. The first earthwork built on the site was leveled by U.S. Army Engineers. A larger earthwork was constructed behind the original position and remains intact. This is the most easily accessible of the remaining defensive positions. * Groesbeck Batteries - Referred to as Batteries 1 & 2, Groesbeck, these two small positions were built in 1864 to guard the approaches to Fort Burnside. They were named for William S. Groesbeck, a Cincinnati lawyer and politician. * Phil Kearny Battery - Originally named Beech Woods Battery, it was renamed for Major General Philip Kearny, who was killed at the battle of Chantilly, September 1, 1862. * Fort Burnside - Constructed in 1863, this elaborate earthwork fort commanded the area from Shaler Battery to Fort Whittlesey. It was named for Major General Ambrose Burnside, commander of the Department of the Ohio, 1863–1864. * Fort Whittlesey - Named for Colonel Charles Whittlesey, who had retired a few months before the threat to Cincinnati and was called back into service by Wallace, his former division commander. * Battery Lee - Constructed in 1863 to overlook the Ohio River valley to the east and named for R. W. Lee, whose identity is still unknown. The earthwork was leveled for the construction of a parade ground for Fort Thomas in 1890. =Ohio batteries= * Price's Hill Battery - Located on the western edge of Cincinnati overlooking the Ohio River. * Mount Adams Battery - Located on the eastern side of Cincinnati near Immaculata Church on Mount Adams. The present site is known as Fort View Place. * Butcher's Hill Battery - Located near the present site of Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park in Eden Park.

He inherited the throne when he was fifteen years old in 1897 and was forced to renounce it in 1918. Early life Cecilie, Alexandrine and Frederick Francis of Mecklenburg-Schwerin with their mother Grand Duchess Anastasia. Born on 9 April 1882, Duke Frederick Francis IV was the son of Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, then hereditary Grand duke, and Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia.Beéche & Hall, Apapa: Christian IX of Denmark and his Descendants, p. 242 He was born in Palermo, Sicily at Villa Belmonte where his parents were staying to alleviate the faltering health of the hereditary Grand duke. Frederick Francis's father suffered from a weak heart, chronic asthma, and acute eczema and had to live part of the year away from Mecklenburg in a warmer climate. Frederick Francis's mother, raised in the splendor of the Russian imperial court and the Orthodox church, never got used to the provincial austerity of the Lutheran court of Schwerin, preferring to live abroad. Frederick Francis was one year old when he became the hereditary grand duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin at the death of his grandfather Frederick Francis II, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on 15 April 1883. Frederick Francis IV had an older sister, Alexandrine and a younger one, Cecilie. The three children were raised with simplicity and a lot of freedom by royal standards. Theirs was a polyglot household. The three siblings, who would remain very close throughout their lives, learned English, French, German and Russian. The family spent only half of the year in Schwerin during the summer months. They stayed as little time as possible in Schwerin Castle surrounded by a lake, preferring Gelbensande, a hunting lodge near Rostock and the Baltic Sea.Zeepvat, The Other Anastasia, p. 5 There, the family led the simple life they preferred. Friederich Franz III spent most his time hunting, while Anastasia and the children rode or drove out, visited local people or enjoyed the beach and the surrounding forest. Every year from November until May, they lived in Villa Welden in Cannes where they sailed with their father and swam in the Mediterranean.Beéche & Hall, Apapa: Christian IX of Denmark and his Descendants, p. 243 On their journey back to Germany they stopped in Paris. Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin Frederick Francis IV succeeded his father as Grand Duke upon his death on 10 April 1897. He had just turned fifteen the day before. As he was a teenager, due to his minority, the grand duchy was governed by his uncle Duke Johann Albrecht as regent. Frederick Francis's mother, Grand Duchess Anastasia preferred to remain in France while he continued the long preparation to eventually assume the throne. The following year, his older sister, Alexandrine married the Danish Crown Prince (future King Christian X in 1912). His mother and younger sister Cecile visited him frequently in Dresden and during their stays, they would go out for long drives in a carriage and horses bought for him from Schwerin. In 1903, the young Grand Duke moved to Bonn, where he attended university and studied administration and law. Adolf Langfeld was appointed as his study advisor. On 9 April 1901 Frederick Francis came of age, ending the regency and beginning his reign in Schwerin. He immediately began working on a reform of the constitution, but it failed in the face of opposition from parliament. =Marriage and issue= On 7 June 1904, Frederick Francis married Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Cumberland in Gmunden. She was the second eldest daughter of Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, and his wife Princess Thyra of Denmark, a daughter of Christian IX of Denmark. They had five children: *Hereditary Grand Duke Frederick Francis (22 April 1910 – 31 July 2001) *Duke Christian Ludwig (29 September 1912 – 18 July 1996) married Princess Barbara of Prussia, daughter of Prince Sigismund of Prussia *Duchess Olga (1916–1917) *Duchess Thyra (18 June 1919 – 27 September 1981) *Duchess Anastasia (11 November 1922 – 25 January 1979) married Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg =Abdication= Following the 1918 suicide of Grand Duke Adolphus Frederick VI of Mecklenburg- Strelitz, Frederick Francis took up the regency of Strelitz. This happened because the heir presumptive Duke Charles Michael was serving in the Russian Army at the time and had indicated that he wished to renounce his succession rights. Frederick Francis abdicated the grand ducal throne on 14 November 1918 following the German Empire's defeat in World War I; the regency ended at the same time. After his abdication, he was initially not allowed to live in Mecklenburg and had to move to Denmark. A year later, he was permitted to return. He recovered some of his former properties and occupied some of his former homes. Frederick Francis died on 17 November 1945 in Flensburg after being arrested by No6 RAF Security section on 9 November 1945. He was succeeded as head of the grand ducal house by his son Hereditary Grand Duke Friedrich Franz.House laws of Mecklenburg Honours ;German decorationsGrossherzoglich Mecklenburg-Schwerinscher Staatskalendar, 1908, p. 1 ;Foreign decorations Ancestry Notes References *Beéche, Arturo and Hall, Coryne.

If the underlying cause is due to an infection, fever may be present. The condition is relatively common and is one of the most frequent types of bursitis. It usually occurs as a result of trauma or pressure to the elbow, infection, or certain medical conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout. Olecranon bursitis is associated with certain types of work including plumbing, mining, gardening, and mechanics. The underlying mechanism is inflammation of the fluid filled sac between the olecranon and skin. Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms. Treatment involves avoiding further trauma, a compression bandage, and NSAIDs. If there is concern of infection the fluid should be drained and tested and antibiotics are typically recommended. The use of steroid injections is controversial. Surgery may be done if other measures are not effective. Signs and symptoms Symptoms include swelling in the elbow, which can sometimes be large enough to restrict motion. There is pain originating in the elbow joint from mild to severe which can spread to the rest of the arm. If the bursa is infected, there also will be prominent redness and the skin will feel very warm. Another symptom would include the infected bursa possibly opening spontaneously and draining pus. Causes Hard blow to the tip of the elbow on a wall Bursitis normally develops as a result either of a single injury to the elbow (for example, a hard blow to the tip of the elbow), or perhaps more commonly due to repeated minor injuries, such as repeated leaning on the point of the elbow on a hard surface. The chance of developing bursitis is higher if one's job or hobby involves a repetitive movement (for example, tennis, golf, or even repetitive computer work involving leaning on one's elbow).NHS direct - Bursitis The likelihood of developing the condition is increased as one gets older.Mayo Clinic - Bursitis risk factors As a reaction to injury, the lining of the bursa becomes inflamed. It then secretes a much greater than normal amount of fluid into the closed cavity of the bursa, from where it has nowhere to go. The bursa therefore inflates, producing a swelling over the proximal end of the ulna which is usually inflamed and tender. Another possible cause of inflammation of the bursa is infection, which can usually (but not always) be traced to a crack or other lesion in the skin which allowed for bacteria of the normal skin flora to invade deeper layers of tissue. This bursa is located just over the extensor aspect of the extreme proximal end of the ulna. In common with other bursae, it is impalpable and contains only a very small amount of fluid in its normal state, and fulfills the function of facilitating the joint's movement by enabling anatomical structures to glide more easily over each other. Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually based on symptoms. If there is concern of infection the fluid should be drained and tested. Treatments =Non-surgical= Conservative management of minor cases involves icing, a compression bandage, and avoidance of the aggravating activity. This can also be augmented with NSAIDs taken by mouth or applied as a cream. Elbow padding can also be used for symptomatic relief. The use of steroid injections is controversial. In case of infection, the bursitis should be drained and treated with an antibiotic. =Surgery= If the fluid continues to return after multiple drainings or the bursa is constantly causing pain, surgeryeOrthopod - Olecranon Bursitis Surgery to remove the bursa is an option. The minor operation removes the bursa from the elbow and is left to regrow but at a normal size over a period of ten to fourteen days. It is usually done under general anesthetic and has minimal risks. The surgery does not disturb any muscle, ligament, or joint structures. To recover from surgical removal, a splint will be applied to the arm to protect the skin. Exercises will be prescribed to improve range of motion.

Ennerdale Water, fed by the River Liza, is the most westerly lake in the Lake District National Park. The valley from Green Gable Due to the remote location, the lack of a public road up the valley, and its management by the Forestry Commission, the National Trust and United Utilities, Ennerdale is relatively unspoiled. Ennerdale Water has not been as affected as other lakes in the National Park by construction, activity on the lake or the trappings of tourism. Environmental protection There are two biological Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in the valley: * Ennerdale * Pillar and Ennerdale Fells SSSI. Pillar and Ennerdale Fells is also protected as a Special Area of Conservation, being one of the ten SSSIs which underpin the High Fells SAC. =Rewilding= In 2003 the valley's three major landowners formed the Wild Ennerdale Partnership. Working with Natural England, the Government's advisor on the environment, the project has a vision \\"to allow the evolution of Ennerdale as a wild valley for the benefit of people, relying more on natural processes to shape its landscape and ecology\\". The project managers have a commitment to maintaining the economic culture of the valley with small-scale forestry work and farming (low-density cattle grazing is replacing sheep). Wild Ennerdale celebrated its 10th anniversary in June 2013. In October of that year the project was represented at the World Wilderness Congress in Salamanca, Spain. Results of the project included: * Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) An increase in numbers of this species. The fish spawn in the River Liza, and have benefited from the rewilding of the river. * Natural woodland. The habitats protected by Pillar and Ennerdale Fells SSSI include natural woodland such as Side Wood, an example of old sessile oak woods. The trees of Ennerdale are important as an example of altitudinal succession (from \\"native upland birch-oak woodland at 120 m on the shores of Ennerdale (Water) the vegetation changes through sub-montane heaths and grasslands to montane heaths along the summit ridge at an altitude of 890 m\\"). The condition of the SSSI´s habitats has been assessed as \\"Unfavourable - Recovering\\".Pillar and Ennerdale Fells SSSI Natural England. As a result of the Wild Ennerdale project, there has been a blurring of the divisions between the wooded and non-wooded areas in the valley, although there is arguably not a natural tree line as such. (A natural tree line occurs in only a few places in the British uplands such as Creag Fhiaclach in the Cairngorms: in the Lake District the climatic tree line is estimated to lie at about 535 m.). Possible introduction of predators In 2013 George Monbiot published Feral, a book on rewilding, in which he argued that Ennerdale is not very wild in comparison with projects in other countries.Feral: searching for enchantment on the frontiers of rewilding. Monbiot has also mentioned Ennerdale in his on-line journalism, for example: The Naturalists Who Are Terrified of Nature He draws attention to the lack of predators in the valley to control the numbers of grazing animals such as deer. In this interpretation, rewilding implies the presence of carnivores to reduce herbivore pressure and enhance trophic diversity. In March 2015, the Lynx UK Trust announced that Ennerdale was one of three locations in England and Scotland where it wanted to trial the reintroduction of wild Eurasian lynx (a species which preys on deer).Should wild lynx be introduced to Ennerdale?. March 2015. However, by 2017 the Trust was proposing Kielder Forest as the preferred site for such a trial. So far as is known, there are no resident pine martens in Ennerdale, but there is evidence that the species is present in Cumbria. There are discussions about its reintroduction to the valley and breeding boxes have been installed. Governance Ennerdale is within the Copeland UK Parliamentary constituency and the North West England European Parliamentary constituency. Trudy Harrison is the Member of parliament. For the European Parliament its residents vote to elect MEP's for the North West England constituency. Tourism The valley is not much visited by tourists, but it is of interest to walkers and is sited on the \\"Coast to Coast Walk\\" devised by Alfred Wainwright. =Youth Hostels= Black Sail hostel Ennerdale has two youth hostels, \\"Ennerdale\\" and \\"Black Sail\\". Black Sail (high up the valley near Black Sail Pass), has been described as England's loneliest youth hostel. In 2008 the Youth Hostels Association announced that it would withdraw the warden from Black Sail as the Forestry Commission would no longer maintain the access track as a result of the Ennerdale rewilding project. However, after protests from members the YHA decided to retain the warden service, while at the same time seeking to reduce the hostel's ecological impact. Low Gillerthwaite Field Centre, which is situated a few hundred metres from Ennerdale Youth Hostel, is adapted from traditional lakeland 17th century farm buildings and offers self-catering accommodation for up to 40 people. It is suitable for use by both groups of young people and adults. The Centre is managed by a registered charity. Geology Bowness Knott is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). =Proposed nuclear waste facility= In June 2012, it became clear that Ennerdale (specifically the Ennerdale granite to the south of Ennerdale Water) had been identified as a potential site for a Geological Disposal Facility for the UK's high and intermediate level nuclear waste. Two other sites had also been identified - Eskdale and the Solway Plain. Ennerdale was not named by the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) Partnership; rather it referred to the 'granitic rocks forming part of the Lake District Batholith'. These are the Ennerdale and Eskdale granites, formed around 450 million years ago in the Ordovician Period. This was stated in (publicly available) document 285 of the West Cumbria MRWS, a letter written by Dr Dearlove, the consultant geologist recruited by MRWS. Three smaller surface exposures of the batholith occur at Shap, Threlkeld and Skiddaw, but these are too small to be considered for the Geological Disposal Facility. In January 2013, Copeland and Allerdale Borough Councils voted to proceed to the next stage (4) of the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) process, but this was vetoed by Cumbria County Council. In September 2013, The Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) announced its proposed changes to the MRWS siting process. These included removal of the right of veto from county councils, and a diluted role for parish councils.

Route description NY 136 approaching the intersection with NY 150 in Wynantskill NY 136 begins south of the city of Troy at an intersection with US 4 (North Greenbush Road) in North Greenbush. Here, NY 136 also connects to County Route 76 (CR 76, named Glenmore Road), which provides access to the headquarters for the 42nd Infantry (Rainbow) Division of the New York Army National Guard. The route heads eastward as Williams Road, intersecting with CR 65 (Bloomingrove Drive) as it passes south of La Salle Institute and Hudson Valley Community College. Near the eastern edge of the college campus, NY 136 connects to a local road leading north to the college and Joseph L. Bruno Stadium. The route progresses past several residences adjacent to the college before intersecting with CR 74 (Winter Street Extension), formerly an intersection with NY 405. At that intersection, NY 136 changes names to Whiteview Road. The route continues to run through residential areas of North Greenbush, providing the northern terminus of CR 67 (Hidley Road) prior to entering the hamlet of Wynantskill and assuming the name West Sand Lake Road. Within Wynantskill, NY 136 terminates at a three-way intersection with NY 150 (West Sand Lake Road). History NY 136 was assigned ; however, it consisted only of the portion of the route on Whiteview Road between Winter Street Extension (at the time part of NY 40) and NY 150 upon assignment. On April 1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of Williams Road (CR 70), a local east–west highway linking US 4 to Winter Street Extension, was transferred from Rensselaer County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The new state highway became a westward extension of NY 136. In between Williams Road and Whiteview Road, NY 136 initially used a small portion of Winter Street Extension, which had been NY 405 prior to the swap.

It was designed for Lothar Franz von Schönborn, Prince-Bishop of Bamberg and Archbishop of Mainz, to designs by Johann Dientzenhofer and Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt. Weißenstein, built as a private summer residence, remains in the Schönborn family. It is considered a masterwork of Baroque architecture. Location Schloss Weißenstein is located in the Upper Franconian district of Bamberg in the village of Pommersfelden, Bavaria, Germany. History In 1710, Lothar Franz von Schönborn, Prince-Bishop of Bamberg and Archbishop of Mainz, inherited the estate after the local family, the Truchsesse of Pommersfelden had died out. He ordered the construction of a palace as a private summer residence, paid for from his personal wealth. In 1711, he had helped ensure the election of Karl VI who rewarded him with a gift of 100,000 gulden. A team of architects including Johann Dientzenhofer who had previously built the Fulda Cathedral and the church at Kloster Banz and Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt, the court architect of Emperor Karl VI, worked on the palace. The Marstall (stables) and park were designed by Schönborn's own court architect, Maximilian von Welsch. Anselm Franz von Ritter zu Groenesteyn designed many of the outbuildings. The local head of construction was the Jesuit priest Nikolaus Loyson (1676–1720). The palace was built between 1711 and 1719 from local sandstone materials, the colour of which gave rise to the name of the palace (\\"white stone\\"). The grand stairway was the first such structure built in the Baroque style in Germany. The interior art was finished in 1723. Contributors included Johann Michael Rottmayr, Johann Rudolf Byss and . After the death of Lothar Franz in 1729, the palace passed to his nephew Friedrich Karl von Schönborn who had the park expanded. A plan by Balthasar Neumann was however, only partially realized. In the early 19th century, the park was transformed from its original Baroque form into an English landscape garden. During the Seven Years' War the palace was attacked and damaged by Prussian troops. Minor restoration work was done in the late 19th century. More recently, preservation work has been done between 1975 and 2003. Description =Main building= The main building (corps de logis) is flanked by two wings that open towards the inner courtyard by way of arcades. In the direction of this cour d'honneur the central part of the main building extends quite noticeably, to accommodate the large central staircase. The middle pavilion of the main wing sits on a pedestal-like ground floor and features two full upper floors with high windows. The other parts of the building have only one main floor and one mezzanine floor, with the exception of the pavilions sitting at the end of the two wings, which have two main floors and one mezzanine floor (the latter housing the guest rooms). All the facades are covered by light gray sandstone, sculptures and window frames are made from yellow-greenish sandstone. The triangular gable of the main building on the garden front with its coat of arms of the Schönborns has been carved from the same material. Colossal statues of Endymion and Diana flank the gable. It is ornamented by two figures, one holding a sheaf, the other a horn of plenty. All of these were likely made by Nikolaus Rösch. The gable is topped by a statue of Atlas holding up the sky. Gable facing the courtyard The gable facing the cour d'honneur also has the family coat of arms, flanked by lions and crowned by Mercury. To the left is a figure of Athena, a symbol of peace and science, to the right is a warrior with spear and torch, symbolizing the just-ended War of the Spanish Succession. The gable also shows a lute player and a figure holding another Schönborn coat of arms. There are four sculpture groups (sandstone) in front of the ground floor of the main pavilion, two each on the garden and the courtyard side. They were likely made by Burkard Zammels, who worked here in 1718-20. On the garden front, the statues show Pluto and Proserpina on the left and Apollo and Daphne on the right. On the cour d'honneur side, the figures are somewhat obscure and have been interpreted as allegories of Justice & Victory and Vigilance & Truth. A carved dog wears a collar with the initials \\"LFC\\", referring to the builder, Lothar Franz Churfürst. Ceiling fresco above the stairway The grand staircase extends through all three floors of the main pavilion. As suggested by Hildebrandt, galleries overlook the stairwell on both upper floors. The large ceiling fresco by Johann Rudolf Byss (1713), who later became the director of the palace gallery of paintings, shows the four then known continents, around a central sun wagon of Phoebus Apollo. Sculptures (Jupiter, Juno, Urania and Cosmos) were made by Zammels. The vases, putti and pair of children are by P. Benkert and his workshop. Stucco work was done by Daniel Schenk. Painted railings that extend the real architectural features are by Marchini. He also was responsible for Trompe-l'œil work in the Gartensaal flight of rooms on the ground floor, accessed between the two flights of stairs. His work is in evidence in both side halls. To the west he created an image of Ionic columns flanking views of an ideal Italian landscape under a sky populated by Flora and Pomona floating on clouds. To the east, painted columns give views of angels who face a \\"collapsing\\" entryway. The central hall has a ceiling fresco showing the allegorical \\"times of the day\\" by Johann Jakob Gerbhardt. The room had been turned into a grotto by Georg Hennicke, who applied semi-precious stones and seashells to the walls. He also added various animal and putti figures. The four larger-than-life stucco statues of the four elements were made by Zammels. On the first floor is the main hall of the palace, the Marmorsaal (marble hall), also facing the garden. Pilasters and columns of red stucco marble are set off from green walls. Situated on sills are stucco figurines by Zammels, showing allegories of the Turkish and Persian monarchies on the inner wall and of the Roman and Greek monarchies on the outer wall. In the corners, the Four Ages are depicted. The ceiling fresco by Franz Michael Rottmayr shows Aurora greeted by Juno, Venus and Dionysus. In the center of each wall a virtue is shown: Justice, Strength, Industry and Wisdom. Stucco work by Daniel Schenk shows putti, vases and eagles. =Side wings= The right wing contains the palace gallery of paintings and its library, with stucco work by D. Schenk and G. Hennicke after 1713. Schönborn had collected a large number of paintings by contemporary artists, many of them Dutch, that were hung in up to four vertical rows, completely covering the gallery walls. He especially treasured painting of members of his family, of the Habsburgs and other rulers and rare animal motives. Schönborn also collected East Asian porcelain delivered to him en masse by members of the Jesuits whom he supported. Other collections include Faiences made in Delft, glass and sea shells. The palace chapel features three important works of art: an Italian Lamentation of Christ (17th century), a Man of Sorrows from Spain (ca. 1730) and a late-Gothic Mother of God. =Marstall= Marstall The Marstall is located to the south of the cour d'honneur and is connected to the side wings of the palace by wrought-iron railings. Built by Johann Dientzendorffer based on plans by Maximilian von Welsch 1714-7 it has a concave front facing the courtyard. It was constructed with one floor less than originally intended. The Marstall features double columns adorning the central part which is topped by a clock tower. Below this is an oval hall, the ceiling with a fresco of Perseus and Andromeda by G.F. Marchini. =Garden= Construction of the formal garden was begun by von Welsch in 1715. After 1722, on the suggestion of his nephew Friedrich Carl, Schönborn summoned Abraham Huber from Salzburg, who by 1723 had the fountains running. The statuary was added only after Lothar Franz' death in 1741. The linden avenue was planted in 1768 with 200 linden trees from the Aischer Wald. Transformation of the formal Baroque garden into an English landscape garden began as early as 1786 under and was completed in the 19th century. Today The Schloss remains the property of Schönborn family. It is considered a Baroque masterwork and the combination of exterior and well-preserved interiors gives it European importance. The palace and its park are open to the public. The Marstall and Orangerie today house a hotel (currently closed). The palace contains the largest private Baroque art collection in Germany, containing over 600 pictures. Baroque and Renaissance artists represented include Peter Paul Rubens, Albrecht Dürer, Titian, Rembrandt and Anthony van Dyck.

Life  According to a family legend, his mother, Uldan, gave birth to him near Mt. Zhambyl, close to the headwaters of the Chu River while fleeing an attack on her village. His father, Dzhabay, then named his son after the mountain. As a boy, Zhambyl learned how to play the dombura and at age 14, left his home to become an akyn. He learned the art of improvisation from the akyn Suyunbai Aronuly. Zhambyl sang exclusively in the Kazakh language. Many patriotic, pro- revolution and pro-Stalin poems and songs were attributed to Zhambyl in the 1930s and were widely circulated in the Soviet Union. Jambyl Jabayev died on 22 June 1945, eight months before his 100th birthday. He was buried in Alma- Ata in a garden which he cultivated with his own hands. The Kazakh city of Taraz was named after Zhambyl from 1938 to 1997. Jambyl Province, in which Taraz is located, still bears his name.  Authorship controversy  It has been claimed that the authors of Zhambyl's published poems were actually Russian poets, who were officially credited as \\"translators.\\"Дм. Дм. Шостакович.

Aldan-Semenov found Zhambyl on the recommendation of the collective farm chairman, the only criterion of choice was that the akyn be poor and have many children and grandchildren. After Aldan-Semenov's arrest, other \\"translators\\" wrote Zhambyl's poems.Виталий Петрановский, Дмитрий Гузевич. «Виртуальный» Гумилёв, или аналитические воспоминания In a different account, according to the Kazakh journalist Erbol Kurnmanbaev, Zhambyl was an akyn of his clan, but until 1936 was relatively unknown. In that year, a young talented poet Abilda Tazhibaev \\"discovered\\" Zhambyl. He was directed to do this by the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, Levon Mirzoyan, who wanted to find an akyn similar to Suleiman Stalsky, the Dagestani poet. Tazhibaev then published the poem \\"My Country\\", under Jambyl's name. It was translated into Russian by the poet Pavel Kuznetsov, published in the newspaper \\"Pravda\\" and was a success. After that, a group of his \\"secretaries\\" - the young Kazakh poetsЕрбол Курманбаев. Несчастный великий Джамбул “Свободa Слова”, №3, 25 января 2007 worked under Jambyl's name.

Both the dominant ethnic group and the minority ethnic groups have citizenship and are able to fully participate in the political process. Ethnic democracy differs from ethnocracy in that elements of it are more purely democratic. It provides the non-core groups with more political participation, influence and improvement of status than ethnocracy supposedly does. Nor is an ethnic democracy a Herrenvolk democracy which is by definition a democracy officially limited to the core ethnic nation only.Smooha, S. 'The model of ethnic democracy: Israel as a Jewish and democratic state', Nations and Nationalism, p. 475. Volume 8 Issue s4, 2002. The term \\"ethnic democracy\\" was introduced by Professor Juan José Linz of Yale University in 1975,Smooha, 2001, p.23: \\"I used this name in 1989 without being aware that it was coined originally by Linz in 1975 to refer to a political system that is democratic for the dominant group but excludes, on the basis of ethnicity, other groups from the democratic process. In 1996 Linz and Stepan followed Linz’s original usage and employed the term (Type II, pp. 429-430) to essentially mean “Herrenvolk democracy”, which is a non-democratic system.\\" and subsequently by University of Haifa sociologist Professor Sammy Smooha in a book published in 1989,Smooha, S. The model of ethnic democracy , European Centre for Minority Issues, ECMI Working Paper # 13, 2001, p24. as a universalised model of the Israel case.S Smooha, Ethnic democracy: Israel as an archetype Israel, 1997 The model was used widely in subsequent decades; in 1993 for a comparison of several countries, in 1997 for a comparison of Israel and Northern Ireland, applied to Estonia and Latvia in 1996 and Slovakia in 2000.  Model definition  Smooha defines eight features that are the core elements of his model of an ethnic democracy:Priit Järve. Ethnic Democracy and Estonia , European Centre for Minority Issues, ECMI Working Paper # 13, 2000. #Ethnic nationalism installs a single core ethnic nation in the state. #The state separates membership in the single core ethnic nation from citizenship. #The state is owned and ruled by the core ethnic nation. #The state mobilises the core ethnic nation. #Non-core groups are accorded incomplete individual and collective rights. #The state allows non-core groups to conduct parliamentary and extra-parliamentary struggle for change. #The state perceives non-core groups as a threat. #The state imposes some control on non-core groups. Smooha also defines ten conditions that can lead to the establishment of an ethnic democracy: #The core ethnic nation constitutes a solid numerical majority. #The non-core population constitutes a significant minority. #The core ethnic nation has a commitment to democracy. #The core ethnic nation is an indigenous group. #The non-core groups are immigrant. #The non-core group is divided into more than one ethnic group. #The core ethnic nation has a sizeable, supportive Diaspora. #The homelands of the non-core groups are involved. #There is international involvement. #Transition from a non-democratic ethnic state has taken place.  Applicability of the model  The model has been applied by researchers to several countries, with various levels of fit. = Israel = The State of Israel is seen as a country that utilises the ethnic democracy model in its relations with the country's Arab minority, as Israel has combined viable democratic institutions with institutionalized ethnic dominance.Peled, Yoav. \\"Ethnic democracy and the legal construction of citizenship: Arab citizens of the Jewish state.\\" American political science review 86, no. 2 (1992): 432-443.Smooha, Sammy. \\"Minority status in an ethnic democracy: The status of the Arab minority in Israel.\\" Ethnic and racial studies 13, no. 3 (1990): 389-413. = Latvia and Estonia = There is a spectrum of opinion among authors as to the classification of Latvia and Estonia, spanning from Liberal or Civic Democracy through Ethnic democracyDiscrimination against the Russophone Minority in Estonia and Latvia — synopsis of article published in the Journal of Common Market Studies (November 2005) to Ethnocracy. Will Kymlicka regards Estonia as a civic democracy, stressing the peculiar status of Russian-speakers, stemming from being at once partly transients, partly immigrants and partly natives. British researcher Neil Melvin concludes that Estonia is moving towards a genuinely pluralist democratic society through its liberalization of citizenship and actively drawing of leaders of the Russian settler communities into the political process. James Hughes, in the United Nations Development Programme's Development and Transition, contends Latvia and Estonia are cases of ‘ethnic democracy’ where the state has been captured by the titular ethnic group and then used to promote ‘nationalising’ policies and alleged discrimination against Russophone minorities. (Development and Transition has also published papers disputing Hughes' contentions.) Israeli researchers Oren Yiftachel and As’ad Ghanem consider Estonia as an ethnocracy. Israeli sociologist Sammy Smooha, of the University of Haifa, disagrees with Yiftachel, contending that the ethnocratic model developed by Yiftachel does not fit the case of Latvia and Estonia; it is not a settler society as its core ethnic group is indigenous, nor did it expand territorially or have a diaspora intervening in its internal affairs as in the case of Israel for which Yiftachel originally developed his model.Smooha, S. The model of ethnic democracy , European Centre for Minority Issues, ECMI Working Paper # 13, 2001, p23. However the notion that Estonia or Latvia are ethnic democracies has been rejected by some commentators.E.g., regarding Latvia: On the one hand, the citizenship laws of these countries are not based on ethnic criteria, treating citizens of Russian extract, including a number of people who automatically became citizens because their families have resided there since before 1940, with the same rights as the ethnic majorities.Amnesty takes on Estonia (reprint) Moreover, non-citizens enjoy social rights on a par with citizens.Human Rights and Social Integration in the Republic of Latvia: a General Survey’, Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Latvia's Naturalisation Board, 1998 On the other hand, given the proportion of non-citizen minorities without certain political rights (7.5% in the case of Estonia ), Estonia and Latvia may not yet even qualify as ethnic democracies: in Smooha's definition of ethnic democracy, minority groups should enjoy full rights as citizens of the country.Smooha S. and P. Järve, eds., The Fate of Ethnic Democracy in Post-Communist Europe (ECMI, 2005), pp. 61-114. =Canada= Smooha describes Canada from independence in 1867 to the Quiet Revolution of 1976, which raised the status of French Canadians to the level of English Canadians, to have been an ethnic democracy. =Northern Ireland= Smooha describes the Government of Northern Ireland (1921–1972) from the Partition of Ireland in 1921 to the Sunningdale Agreement in 1972 as an ethnic democracy, favoring Protestants of mainly Ulster Scots descent to the native Irish Catholics. =Malaysia= Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia, as well as the Ketuanan Melayu (Malay supremacy) ideology followed by post-independence Malaysian governments since the 1970s, gives more rights to the Bumiputra in general and to Malaysian Malays than to Malaysian minorities, such as Malaysian Chinese and Malaysian Indians. =Slovakia= Slovak nationalism is grounded in ethnicity and language. \\"State-building and nation-building in Slovakia are designed to install ethnic Slovaks as the sole nation and to prevent any sign of binationalism. This objective is made clear in the preamble of the Slovak constitution which begins with the following words: “We, the Slovak nation, bearing in mind the political and cultural heritage of our predecessors, the experience gained through centuries of struggle for our national existence and statehood…”Smooha, S.

Through its planning policies and review of development proposals, the Commission seeks to protect and enhance the extraordinary resources of the national capital.\\"About NCPC\\" The 12-member commission includes three presidential appointees, of which one must be from Virginia and one from Maryland, the mayor of Washington, D.C., the chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, two mayoral appointees, and the chairmen of the House and Senate committees with review authority over the District. Other commission members include the heads of the three major land holding agencies, which are the Department of Defense, the Department of the Interior, and the General Services Administration.http://www.ncpc.gov/about/pg.asp?p=commissionmembers \\"NCPC Commission Members\\" The Commission is supported by a professional staff of planners, architects, urban designers, historic preservation officers, among others. History Congress established the \\"National Capital Park Commission\\" in 1924 to acquire parkland for the capital in order to preserve forests and natural scenery in and about Washington to prevent pollution of Rock Creek and the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, and to provide for the comprehensive development of the nation's park system. Two years later, Congress renamed the agency the \\"National Capital Park and Planning Commission\\" and gave it the additional responsibility of comprehensive planning for the Washington region. Among its early members was noted Philadelphia architect Clarence C. Zantzinger. The 1952 Capital Planning Act gave the commission its current name and the responsibility for preservation of important natural and historic sites in the area.http://www.ncpc.gov/about/pg.asp?p=historyofncpc \\"History of NCPC\\" The Home Rule Act of 1973 gave some of the commission's local planning authority to the District of Columbia government.

In addition, NCPC plays an advisory role to the District in certain land use decisions.http://www.ncpc.gov/about/pg.asp?p=historyofncpc \\"History of NCPC\\" Responsibilities NCPC operates under many laws and authorities that guide the agency’s work. These include the National Capital Planning Act, Height of Buildings Act of 1910, Commemorative Works Act, District of Columbia Zoning Act, Foreign Missions Act, International Centers Act, NEPA, Home Rule Act, and the Capper Crampton Act.http://www.ncpc.gov/about/pg.asp?p=historyofncpc \\"History of NCPC\\" NCPC principle responsibilities include:http://www.ncpc.gov/about/pg.asp?p=principalactivities \\"Principal Activities\\" * Urban Design and Plan Review - NCPC’s core work is the review of federal development projects in the region. The Commission reviews plans and projects ranging from commemorative works to new or renovated federal office buildings. Through its work, NCPC ensures that federal development meets the highest urban design standards and complies with Commission policies, including the Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital: Federal Elements.http://www.narpac.org/REXCOMPL.HTM \\"NARPAC Recent Analyses - Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital\\" NCPC also reviews District of Columbia public projects, proposed street and alley closings, and Zoning Commission actions, as well as private development in the Pennsylvania Avenue Historic District. * Comprehensive Planning - When creating NCPC, Congress charged the agency with preparing a “comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated plan for the National Capital.” The Comprehensive Plan for the National Capital: Federal Elements serves as a blueprint for long-term development through its policies on issues including transportation, preservation and historic features, parks and open space, and foreign missions. The District Elements of the Comprehensive Plan are developed under the auspices of the Mayor of the District of Columbia and are subject to NCPC review prior to adoption by the District's City Council. Preparing long-range comprehensive plans is one of NCPC's missions mandated by Congress. The major comprehensive plans for the National Capital Region are the L'Enfant Plan and the McMillan Plan.http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wash/lenfant.htm \\"The L'Enfant and McMillan Plans\\" *Signature Planning - NCPC proactively develops long-term plans for the capital city and the region. NCPC’s signature plans focus on a variety of issues including developing well-designed perimeter security, ensuring that all quadrants of the city benefit from the federal presence, meeting 21st-century transportation challenges, and planning for future memorials and museums. Its most recent signature plans include the Monumental Core Framework Plan, adopted in April 2009 and CapitalSpace, a joint open space plan between NCPC, the Government of the District of Columbia and the National Park Service.http://southwestquadrant.blogspot.com/2009/04/framework- plan-takes-shape.html \\"Framework Plan Takes Shape\\", Southwest...The Little Quadrant That Could Blog In addition, the Circulator Bus was a direct product of NCPC planning and advising.http://www.dccirculator.com/about.html \\"About the Circulator\\" *Federal Capital Improvements Program - Each year, federal agencies submit to NCPC their proposals for capital improvements in the coming six years.

Early life He was born in 1898 as the son of Sahibzada Muhammad Mirza Jafaar (1876-1921) and his principle first wife, in Mirza Mahal palace in Natore and educated at the Rajshahi Collegiate School alongside the Dighapatia princes. He was named by his grandfather Sahibzada Zahir Shah Mirza (1855-1899) after his illustrious ancestor Mirza Jalaluddin Muhammad (1542-1605), 3rd Mughal Emperor . Mirza married Jamila Begum. Background His father served as the \\"Mridha\\" or the Military Governor to the Maharaja of Rajshahi, while he paid tributary to the Maharaja of Dighapatia as a Madhyasvatva (subinfeudated or vassal) as after his father death he took over the dignitaries as the zamindar. One of the few Muslim zamindari in Natore, during the Partition of India in 1947 the newly formed Islamic Government of Pakistan favored Muslim families and especially when Bengal was split the old Hindu Rajas (Kings) of East Bengal left resulting in most of the neighboring estates coming under him and his full brothers. From his father's death in 1921 till his election as the Zamindar in 1932, his brothers managed the Singranatore estate. =Death and legacy= He died in 1975 and his oldest child Gulbadan Begum of Natore (1923-2005) succeeded him as the head of the Singranatore family. In 1950 during the abolition, the Singra Natore Zamindari was at its fullest extent, annexing villages formerly governed by High caste Hindu families. Most of his children were married off to notable land holding and feudal noble families of aristocratic lines. An educationalist and philanthropist, he was a patron and educator of the Rajshahi Collegiate School, the oldest school of the Indian Subcontinent. He donated lands towards the building of many schools. The first College of Singra, Gole Afroz College was named after his oldest granddaughter and was established in East Pakistan. After the war of 1971, the college was personally nationalized by Hussain Muhammad Ershad, the President of Bangladesh in 1986.

Unlike these other programs, Helicon Filter is designed primarily to edit and improve existing photos and not for graphics creation. Helicon Filter's interface also differs from other programs in that compact toolbars and menus containing editing tools are replaced with labeled \\"filter\\" tabs, each tab containing labeled edit options specific to a single aspect of the picture. Although some editors used to Photoshop-style programs may initially find this layout unfamiliar and unlike the standard toolbar layout, beginners and those who don't recognize the standard icons generally find this very helpful for getting through the editing process. Overview Helicon Filter, formally Helicon NoiseFilter, was introduced in August, 2004 as Helicon Filter 1.61, by Helicon Soft, Ltd., a company based in Kharkov, Ukraine.Helicon Soft's contact page By 2005, Helicon Filter had become known for its noise reduction ability, though it also had some other basic features such as raw support, exposure correction, color adjustments, red eye removal, and resizing/cropping.Download.com information for Helicon Filter 3.10, from July, 2005 More recent versions of the program have yielded more advanced features also found in Photoshop CS including cloning, selective color editing, and HDR imaging, though Helicon Filter still lacks other features found in Photoshop such as layer support, full selective editing abilities, and the ability to create graphics. The program runs in English, Russian, German, French, Spanish, Dutch and Italian. Functionalities An \\"edit map\\" indicating (in pink) which areas of the picture will be affected by a specific filter. In this example, \\"Noise map\\" is used to show where noise reduction will be applied. Live preview Helicon Filter's live preview can be used in either simple mode (commercial and freeware versions) or expert mode (commercial versions only). Simple mode allows the user to control aspects of the picture with fewer sliders, fewer brushes, no equalizers and no Aberrations filter, while expert mode gives the user more sliders along with equalizer control. Live preview can be used to show the final image after editing, can show a split between the edited version and the original, and can show images as a full-screen preview. Right- clicking causes the image preview to temporarily be replaced with the original version. A slider exists to select custom zoom, and in most filter tabs, a magnifying class can be used to view portions of a picture at higher magnification. In some filters, an \\"edit map\\" can be used to view which areas which will be affected from those filters. There is also a filter-guide wizard to help in going through a workflow of the different filter tabs. Plugins Helicon Filter is designed to support plugins which would work with Photoshop (i.e., they are in the 8BF file format), however many of these plugins do not properly function in Helicon Filter and other programs which claim their support. Image stacking In Helicon Filter Home and Pro, one is able to stack several images of the same subject where the pictures are of the same dimensions. The program does not implement layers for customized stacking, rather the program has built in stacking for specific uses. Firstly, High dynamic range images (HDR) can be created using the Increase dynamic range command. Secondly, the program is able to stack several images with high noise levels into one low-noise picture. Finally, the program is partially capable of stacking images of a moving subject together to create effects of time- lapse or multi-exposure photography to capture such things as moving stars, however Helicon Filter cannot spread out the frames to amplify a subject's motion (e.g. landing bird, flipping gymnast) or create GIF movies from these images. Noise reduction Image noise and grain can be controlled in the Noise filter using the Noise level, Highlights, Shadows, Radius and Chroma sliders. These sliders allow for selective noise reduction by object detail and brightness. Noise reduction can be applied to specific colors in expert preview mode using an equalizer. In this filter, there is also a dust and hot/dead pixel map feature which, based on a special photograph, allows the user to define certain areas in the picture which would have dust and dead pixels for the program to remove. Brightness The exposure and lighting of a photograph can be improved using the Contrast, Gamma, Exposure, Local contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Black point, and White point sliders. An equalizer to control effect by exposure (with a zone slider for tone mapping), along with Haze compensation and gradient haze compensation sliders, appear in expert preview mode. Colors In the Colors filter, an image's white balance can be adjusted through color sliders or by selecting an area of the picture that should be white or match a predefined \\"memory color\\". Equalizers control spectral sensitivity and saturation by color. The brightness, hue and saturation of a color range can also be modified in a process often referred to as color swapping. Aberration Removal In expert preview mode, chromatic aberrations can be removed in the Aberration filter by selecting an aberration color and adjusting the Radius, Brightness threshold, and Color tolerance sliders. There is also a tool to reduce lateral aberrations. This filter works by taking all areas in a picture with the defined aberration color and reducing its saturation to zero. Since purple fringing, a common aberration type, is easiest to remove, purple is by default the aberration removal color. Optical aberrations, such as red/cyan fringing, are more difficult to remove and often must be cloned out in order to remove them completely. Sharpening In the Sharpening filter, sliders allow for the sharpening of both small details and edges. In expert preview mode, an equalizer can be used to sharpen specific colors and leave others unchanged. White halos can also be suppressed when sharpening. Distortions In the Distortions filter, barrel or pincushion distortion can be controlled, horizontal and vertical perspective may be changed, the image may be stretched and squeezed, the image may be skewed, h-bend can be controlled, and vignetting can be corrected. This feature is especially useful for photographs taken with a wide-angle lens, as this often produces distorted images. Complete image flips and rotations of varying degrees may also be done. Resizing Helicon Filter allows for cropping and resizing of an image. The image may be sized by custom pixels, pre-defined print sizes and DPI, special cropping for mobile devices or for the web, or as a percentage of the original image size. Frames Frames and text can be added to an image using the Frames tab. Frames and text can also be positioned in various parts of the photo and rotated. The frames can be colored as a function of the actual image or as a solid color, a few frame effects are available (Shadow, 3D frame, Smoothed 3D, Fade out, Oval, Background highlighting, and Background shadow), and the size of frames can be controlled. Text may also be inserted in this filter. The text's font and size can be controlled, and, as with the frames, can be colored as a function of the photograph or as a solid color. One is also able to control the texture and transparency of this text. Retouching In the Retouching tab, brushes can be selected to perform such tasks as removal of imperfections, cloning, brightness correction, color alteration, saturation alteration, focus correction, noise reduction, red-eye removal, distorting, and replacing of a background or subject. A brush also exists to erase either changes of other brushes or all effects from all filters. The Delete scratches, Reduce noise, Distort, and Replace sky/background brushes are only available in expert preview mode. The brushes' size, softness, intensity and edge sensitivity can be controlled. All strokes performed in this tab may be undone. File support Helicon Filter supports the most common raster graphic file formats, such as JPEG, GIF (import only), and PNG, as well as some less common formats, such as the most recent raw formats,List of supported RAW formats JPEG 2000, Photoshop images (PSD), and both 16 and 8 bit TIFFs. Movie files may be played back, though they may not be edited. In the free version, files may only be saved as jpegs and bitmaps. As a security means in certain licenses to prevent extended license periods, photos dated later than the date of the computer do not open, and this has caused some complaints from those who have mis-dated pictures. File control Individual photos can be tagged with speech or text notes. Files may be saved as Bitmap, JPEG, JPEG Progressive, JPEG 2000, PSD, PNG, TIFF, and TIFF LZW files. When saving files as JPEGs, the user can select the JPEG quality and calculate the files size. Processing of raw images is done with either dcraw or Helicon's older raw conversion process, from Polybytes. Files can also be printed within Helicon Filter, emailed, or sent to mobile phones. Complete Exif can be viewed as a separate window within Helicon Filter. Call from photo programs Helicon Filter may be opened from Helicon Focus and Helicon Photo Safe, as well as other programs which make use of context menus (such as Windows Explorer and Picasa). If used with a Pro license, Helicon Filter may also be opened within certain photo programs, including Photoshop, Corel PHOTO-PAINT, and Corel Paint Shop Pro, as an 8BF plugin. =Gallery= File:Noisereductionhelicon.pngNoise reduction in Helicon Filter.

Compared to Photoshop Adobe Photoshop is one of the most well-known programs for commercial bitmap and image manipulation. It is designed to allow the user a wide range of control over image manipulation and features a wide range of functions and controls. Helicon Filter, on the other hand, is designed for less experienced users while still providing advanced tools needed to improve already existing photographs; menus and toolbars containing edit options are replaced with \\"filter\\" tabs, each tab containing labeled edit options. Due to this simplification, Helicon Filter is unable to perform Photoshop's abilities of advanced layer manipulation and graphic creation, and Helicon does not have full selection editing abilities. An element of Photoshop necessary for advanced image manipulation is use of layers and alpha channel support. Layers allow the user to edit elements of an image individually and to move elements or objects from one image to another. Helicon Filter does not support layers, however two common functions of layers — adding a subject or background from one photograph to another and adding text and frames — can still be performed in Helicon. Using the brushes, one object from an image can be neatly painted into another. Text and frames can also be put into an image using the Frames filter. Even with these workarounds, however, Helicon Filter, due to its lack of layer support, can not do some things that Photoshop can. For example, an object painted in from another picture can not later be moved to a different location in the new picture. (Helicon Soft has mentioned plans to implement layers in upcoming versions.) Another important element of Photoshop, the acceptance of third- party plugins, is useful in image correction. Plugins are needed to create many effects for an image such as color manipulation, insertion of ripples and other effects, and noise reduction. Although Helicon Filter supports many of these 8BF plugins, they are generally not needed due to the program's built-in features such as noise reduction, aberration removal, perspective adjustment, and so on. Both Helicon Filter and Adobe Photoshop are able to blend and combine images in several different ways, most notably as multi-exposures and HDRs. One image blend type Photoshop is capable of while Helicon Filter is not is that of panoramic photography. However, Helicon Filter is able to stack several images for noise reduction, while Photoshop is not. Some features of Helicon Filter which are not found in Photoshop and which contribute to the program's ease of use are its Erase changes brush, its ability to edit, change and undo various aspects of a photo independently, and its edit mapping ability which indicates which areas of a photo will be affected by an edit. Aside from those differences, both programs share almost all practical functionality for image improvement. For example, both programs are able to retouch images, sharpen them, modify colors, remove red eye, remove aberrations, compensate for lens distortion, and perform many similar functions. Both programs are also able to open and save images from a wide range of formats including the latest raw formats, PNG and JPEG 2000.

History 33-35 All Saints Green, Norwich, pictured in 2017. No. 35 was the BBC's base in the city until September 1956. In the mid-1950s, the BBC had a temporary headquarters in Norwich at No. 35 All Saints Green. In September 1956 they moved to a new, larger headquarters at the nearby St Catherine's Close. From here, editions of radio programmes such as Midlands Miscellany were broadcast into the Midlands Home Service before the end of 1956. The opening of the Tacolneston transmitting station enabled programmes to be broadcast from Norwich purely for East Anglia on the VHF edition of the Home Service, and regular broadcasts from St Catherine's Close began on Tuesday 5 February 1957. Daily news bulletins for East Anglia began on Monday 10 March 1958, on VHF from the Norwich studios, under the supervision of Richard Robinson. The first television news bulletin for the east from St Catherine's Close was broadcast on 5 October 1959. These initial bulletins were only three minutes per night, but in 1962 were extended to ten minutes and the bulletins named East Anglia at Six Ten. In 1964, the programme was extended to 20 minutes in length and renamed Look East, a title the programme still goes under today. The Norwich- based operation was initially a satellite of the larger BBC Midland region, based in Birmingham. East Anglia was given greater autonomy within the BBC in 1969 after the Broadcasting in the Seventies report recommended the large Midlands and East Anglia region should be split into two. During 1997, an opt- out service (originally titled Close Up) was introduced to provide local bulletins for Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Peterborough and Milton Keynes. St Catherine's House on All Saints Green in Norwich, pictured in 2012. This was the main base for BBC East's radio operations from 1956 until 1980, and of its television output from 1959 to 2003.Until 1980, regional radio programming was provided by an East Anglia opt-out on BBC Radio 4, consisting largely of daytime news bulletins and a weekday breakfast show, Roundabout East Anglia. The first BBC Local Radio station in the region, Radio Norfolk, was opened on 11 September 1980 and followed by the rollout of stations in Cambridgeshire (1 May 1982), Northamptonshire (16 June 1982), the Three Counties of Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire & Buckinghamshire (24 June 1985), Essex (5 November 1986) and Suffolk (12 April 1990). Studios The Forum, where BBC East has been based since 2003. BBC East's main headquarters and studios are based at The Forum on Millennium Plain in Norwich, having moved from St Catherine's Close in 2003. The move to The Forum was a result of a number of factors: the listed status of the building restricted much of what the BBC did there, the location was less central than the BBC wanted, their ideal location being in Norwich city centre, the equipment was becoming old and needed replacing, and the Disability Discrimination Act meant that their headquarters now needed major modifications to comply with the law. BBC East also has radio and television studios at the Cambridge Business Park, on Cowley Road in the city, where both Look East's West opt-out and Radio Cambridgeshire are based. Local radio studios and television bureaux are also located in Chelmsford, Northampton, Ipswich, and Dunstable.

Washabaugh remained an unorganized county, attached to various other counties for judicial purposes, until it merged with Jackson County in 1983. Geography The county encompassed the northeast corner of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation including the community of Wanblee. The eastern portion of the county was within the Rosebud Indian Reservation until 1911, when that part was annexed into the newly created Mellette County. By 1914, Washabaugh County's boundaries were expanded to include a portion of Washington County to the west and all of Jackson County south of the White River.1914 Map of Washabaugh County Demographics As an unorganized county lying entirely within two American Indian reservations, Washabaugh did not report separate population totals during the 1890, 1900, and 1910 censuses.

UKRI is a non-departmental public body (NDPB) funded by the UK government. ESRC provides funding and support for research and training in the social sciences. It is the UK's largest organisation for funding research on economic and social issues. Structure The ESRC is based at Polaris House in Swindon, which is also the location of the head offices of several other councils of UK Research and Innovation: AHRC, BBSRC, EPSRC, Innovate UK, MRC, NERC and STFC, as well as the UK Space Agency. At any one time ESRC supports over 4,000 researchers and postgraduate students in academic institutions and independent research institutes. Mission The ESRC's mission, according to its website, is to: * promote and support, by any means, high-quality research and related postgraduate training on social and economic issues * develop and support the national data infrastructure that underpins high-quality research * advance knowledge and provide trained social scientists who meet the needs of users and beneficiaries, thereby contributing to the economic competitiveness of the UK, the effectiveness of public services and policy, and the quality of life * communicate clearly and promote public understanding of social science. History The ESRC was founded in 1965 as the Social Science Research Council (SSRC - not to be confused with the Social Science Research Council in the United States). The establishment of a state funding body for the social sciences in the United Kingdom, had been under discussion since the Second World War; however, it was not until the 1964 election of Prime Minister Harold Wilson that the political climate for the creation of the SSRC became sufficiently favourable. The first chief executive of the SSRC was Michael Young (later Baron Young of Dartington). Subsequent holders of the post have included Michael Posner, later Secretary General of the European Science Foundation. The current Chief Executive of the ESRC is Professor Jennifer Rubin who took over from Professor Jane Elliott in October 2017. =Change of name= Following the election of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in the 1979 general election, the Government expressed reservations about the value of research in the social sciences, and the extent to which it should be publicly funded. In 1981, the Education Secretary Sir Keith Joseph asked Lord Rothschild to lead a review into the future of the SSRC. It was ultimately decided (due in no small part to the efforts of Michael Posner, chief executive of the SSRC at the time) that the Council should remain, but that its remit should be expanded beyond the social sciences, to include more 'empirical' research and research of 'more public concern'. To reflect this, in 1983 the SSRC was renamed the Economic and Social Research Council.

SLAM. March 8, 2010. Retrieved on June 29, 2010. Fields had a (reported) 50-inch vertical leap. ESPN HS regarded him as the best freshman in the country for the 1992-93 season. He was a 3-time Parade All American selection (1994–96). He was also the first sophomore to ever play in the \\"Best of the Best\\" game at the Nike All American camp in 1993, a game that featured future NBA MVP'S Allen Iverson and Kevin Garnett, and High School Player of the Year award winners Ron Mercer and Jerod Ward. After Garnett was drafted in 1995, Fields, in his senior year, led his squad to an 11-1 record in the Chicago Public League with per-game averages of 32.4 points, 12.2 rebounds, 5.1 assists, 4.5 blocks, 4 steals, and 4.5 dunks a game. He became a consensus First Team All American (Parade, USA Today, McDonald's), putting him in the company of future NBA players Mike Bibby, Jermaine O'Neal, Tim Thomas, and Kobe Bryant. Fields broke his neck in a car accident on February 26, 1996, one week before the city playoffs. After undergoing surgery to repair a fractured bone in his neck, he had to wear a protective halo while healing. He left high school as the third all-time leading scorer in Chicago Public League history with 2,619 points. His high school teammates include Willie Farley (94), Kevin Garnett (95) and Michael Wright (98). After being recruited by Joey Meyer, Fields signed a letter of intent at DePaul University in his hometown but was later ruled academically ineligible and denied admission. A few months later, Fields pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sexual abuse, which led to a probation.http://www.chicagodefender.com/index.php/sports/14747-a-new- direction-for-ronnie-fields He declared himself eligible for the 1996 CBA Draft and was selected in the 7th round (73rd overall) by the LaCrosse Bobcats.

Fields also suited up as an import in the Philippine Basketball Association for the Tanduay Rhum Masters. He has also played in Venezuela, Turkey, Lebanon, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Greece. Fields also played in the ABA, reuniting with Joey Meyer in the 2000-2001 season with the Chicago Skyliners. He also spent four seasons with the Rockford Lightning as the team' starting guard. In November 2008, Fields returned to play basketball in the CBA for the Minot SkyRockets, signing as the starting shooting guard. The 32-year-old Fields averaged 21.4 points, 4.9 assists, and a league-leading 2.7 steals a game in his last full season.

The term sight words is often confused with sight vocabulary, which is defined as each person's own vocabulary that the person recognizes from memory without the need to decode for understanding.Rapp, S. (1999-09-29). Recognizing words on sight; activity. The Baltimore Sun Sight words were introduced after Whole language (a similar method) fell out of favor with the education establishment.Ravitch, Diane. (2007). EdSpeak: A Glossary of Education Terms, Phrases, Buzzwords, and Jargon. Alexandria, VA: Association for Supervision & Curriculum Development, . Rationale Sight words account for a large percentage (up to 75%) of the words used in beginning children's print materials. The advantage for children being able to recognize sight words automatically is that a beginning reader will be able to identify the majority of words in a beginning text before they even attempt to read it; therefore, allowing the child to concentrate on meaning and comprehension as they read without having to stop and decode every single word. Advocates of whole-word instruction believe that being able to recognize a large number of sight words gives students a better start to learning to read. Recognizing sight words automatically is said to be advantageous for beginning readers because many of these words have unusual spelling patterns, cannot be sounded out using basic phonics knowledge and cannot be represented using pictures. For example, the word \\"was\\" does not follow a usual spelling pattern, as the middle letter \\"a\\" makes an sound and the final letter \\"s\\" makes a sound, nor can the word be associated with a picture clue since it denotes an abstract state (existence). Another example, is the word “said”,it breaks the phonetic rule of ai normally makes the long a sound, ay. In this word it makes the short e sound of eh. The word \\"said\\" is pronounced as /s/ /e/ /d/. The word “has” also breaks the phonetic rule of s normally making the sss sound, in this word the s makes the z sound, /z/.\\" The word is then pronounced /h/ /a/ /z/. Word lists A number of sight word lists have been compiled and published; among the most popular are the Dolch sight words and the Magic 100 words. These lists have similar attributes, as they all aim to divide words into levels which are prioritized and introduced to children according to frequency of appearance in beginning readers' texts. Although many of the lists have overlapping content, the order of frequency of sight words varies and can be disputed, as they depend on contexts such as geographical location, empirical data, samples used, and year of publication. Criticism Research shows that the alphabetic principle is seen as \\"the primary driver\\" of development of all aspects of printed word recognition including phonic rules and sight vocabulary.\\" In addition, the use of sight words as a reading instructional strategy is not consistent with the dual route theory as it involves out-of-context memorization rather than the development of phonological skills. Instead, it is suggested that children first learn to identify individual letter-sound correspondences before blending and segmenting letter combinations. Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas Proponents of systematic phonics and synthetic phonics argue that children must first learn to associate the sounds of their language with the letter(s) that are used to represent them, and then to blends those sounds into words, and that children should never memorize words as visual designs. Using sight words as a method of teaching reading in English is seen as being at odds with the alphabetic principle and as introducing English as though it was a logographic language. Perhaps two of the most significant problems with sight words are 1) memorizing sight words is labour intensive, requiring on average about 35 trials per word, and 2) teachers who withhold phonics instruction and instead rely on teaching sight words are making it harder for children to \\"gain basic word-recognition skills\\" that are critically needed by the end of grade three and can be used over a lifetime of reading.

Maxi performed with two girl groups and the Irish supergroup The Concerned in the 1970s–80s, also representing Ireland at the 1973 and 1981 Eurovision Song Contests. After an automobile accident left her hospitalized, she focused on becoming a presenter for Raidió Teilifís Éireann; she retired from the broadcaster in 2015 after 30 years therewith. Personal life The third and final child of Madge and Sam, Maxi was born Irene McCoubrey on . She grew up in Harold's Cross, and was given her nickname due to the letters \\"McC\\" in her surname. , she had only been married once, from 1973–79, and bore no children. In addition to her work in media, Maxi was a UNICEF Ireland representative. , she lived in Blackrock. Music As a child, Maxi and Sam played the violin, and Madge played the piano. In addition to singing with the Little Dublin Singers and Young Dublin Singers, Maxi sang in the school choir at St Louis High School, Rathmines. When Eamonn Andrews wanted to create a girl group to sing backing vocals for his recording studio, he chose Maxi, Adele King, and Barbara Dixon because of how the combined singing voices sounded; the girls became Maxi, Dick and Twink based on all their respective nicknames. Maxi credited this imposed friendship with drawing 14-year-old McCoubrey out of her shyness. The group proved very popular outside Andrews' studio, and toured internationally (once to Mainz with chaperone Maeve Binchy). After seven years performing together, the group disbanded when they began developing conflicting goals. In 2015, Maxi told the Irish Independent that the three \\"are still getting along today. […] We're still friends, and chat and e-mail all the time.\\" At 23 years old, Maxi was chosen to represent the Republic of Ireland at the Eurovision Song Contest 1973, performing \\"Do I Dream\\". At the competition in Luxembourg, Maxi and the Irish delegation disagreed on the arrangement of the song. When Maxi refused to perform, Raidió Teilifís Éireann panicked and sent Tina Reynolds to compete in her stead, giving the replacement singer only the flight from Ireland to rehearse the song. Ultimately, Maxi performed and received tenth place. Reynolds would represent Ireland the following year with \\"Cross Your Heart\\", placing seventh. In the late 1970s, Maxi applied to join the new girl group Sheeba. Though she was initially turned down due to her age (28), she eventually joined Marion Fossett and Frances Campbell as the third member of \\"Ireland's first sexy girl group.\\" At Eurovision 1981, Sheeba came in fifth, singing \\"Horoscopes\\". After traveling to Holland and London to record tracks for a new album, the three women of Sheeba were hospitalized at Mayo University Hospital after a traffic collision in Castlebar; Maxi's head injury caused amnesia and needed more than 100 surgical sutures, Fossett received facial injuries, and Campbell had a collapsed lung. Sheeba were dropped by their record label after their recovery took too long, and though the three tried to succeed independently, the group ultimately broke up. In 1985, Maxi joined the Irish supergroup The Concerned to perform and record the charity record \\"Show Some Concern\\" in support of Concern Worldwide; the song was a number-one hit in March and April 1985. The Concerned also included Dave Fanning, Pat Kenny, Gerry Ryan, Linda Martin, Christy Moore, Mary Black, Adele King, Maura O'Connell, Freddie White, Eamon Carr, Johnny Duhan, Dave King, Clannad, The Blades, Stockton's Wing, The Golden Horde, and Those Nervous Animals. The music video was filmed at Windmill Lane Recording Studios. While she was bedridden in 2010–11, Maxi wrote 26 songs with Charlie McGettigan; McGettigan later recorded two, while Clara Rose Monahan recorded a third. Radio Maxi was fascinated by radio since childhood. After the traffic accident that caused the fall of Sheeba, Maxi ventured into radio presenting on two inspirations. Firstly, Sir Pete Murray had told a younger Maxi that \\"she had a beautiful radio voice\\"; secondly, medical treatment after the crash required shaving her head, and working on radio afforded her the opportunity to perform without being seen. In autumn 1994, Maxi hosted a BBC Radio 2 programme on Saturdays. Maxi presented Late Date (from midnight until 2a.m.) on RTÉ 2fm for eleven years, worked on Thames' Name That Tune, was the first woman presenter of Rapid Roulette, and for the eleven years prior to October 2011—when she fell ill—she had hosted The Risin' Time on RTÉ Radio 1 from 5:30–7a.m. After 30 years of employment, Maxi officially retired from Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTE) on 23 February 2015.

He has created the term \\"Lyrical Conceptualism\\" to characterize his style in both painting and poetry.  Biographical Information  Hartal emigrated to Israel in 1957 and on to Montreal, Quebec in 1973. He earned a B.A. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1964, an M.A. from Concordia University in 1977, and a Ph.D. in Education and Art from Columbia Pacific University, San Rafael, California in 1986. In 1987 Hartal founded the Centre for Art, Science, and Technology in Montreal, which he directs. Hartal paints in an expressionistic style with additional elements such as photographs. :\\"Lyrical Conceptualism does not impose any formal limitations on the artist’s freedom. It merely suggests. Instead of competition it advocates cooperation. In our post-industrial society, science and technology determine our lifestyle. Consequently, art must concern itself with science and technology. However, science and technology should not be our masters but our servants\\" (1975). Hartal exhibited his paintings internationally, including galleries and museums in Paris, New York, Seoul, Budapest and Montreal. In 1978 he showed his work at the Musee du Luxembourg in the French capital and his painting, Flowers for Cezanne won the Prix de Paris. As a writer, Hartal has authored books of poetry, nonfiction, as well as the illustrated novel,The Kidnapping of the Painter Miro, which has also been published in Mandarin Chinese translation ().

In 1975, Hartal published A Manifesto on Lyrical Conceptualism,Hartal, Paul. The Brush and the Compass: The Interface Dynamics of Art and Science. Lanham, MD: University Press of America, 1988, p. V.Exler, Elizabeth. “Paul Hartal: A Manifesto on Lyrical Conceptualism.” Manhattan Arts. November–December 1992, p. 14. introducing Lycoism as a new art idea on the “periodic table of art.” In this work, Hartal proposes a theory of art which runs contrary to what he claims is the traditional belief, that emotion and intellect are at odds with each other. In Mazes for the Mind, Clifford Pickover draws attention to Hartal's view that we need the imagination, the insight, and the lateral reasoning faculty, as well as human values, which are excluded from the rigid methodology of science but are intrinsic to art: \\"The present human condition calls for the rise of a new, inclusive form of culture in which art should play a most prominent role.\\"Clifford A. Pickover (1992). Mazes for the Mind. New York: St. Martin's Press. pp. 277-79. The art critic Balint Szombathy notes that lyrical conceptualism encapsulates no less a fusion of polarities than the term- amalgams of lyrical expressionism, or lyrical abstraction. It is possible to characterize these diametrically opposed juxtapositions, he says, as attempts to equalize incompatible elements for the sake of synthesis. However, in introducing the notion of Lycoism, Hartal did not intend to form a new post- conceptualist splinter-trend; instead, his intention was the creation of a new philosophy of art in which the tearing down of the boundaries between art and science, the interlacement of the intuitive and the exact, and incorporation of the lyrical and the geometrical play a central role.Szombathy, Balint. \\"A lirai konceptualizmus muveszete: Paul Hartal elmeleti-gyakorlati torekvesei.\\" Uj Forras. April 1991, No. 4. Concepts and Ideals of Lyco Art Lyco art identifies the meaning of art with its life-serving purpose. Concerning itself with cultural transformation and the human condition, it seeks to expand the boundaries of aesthetics.Hartal, Paul. “The songs of the double helix: symmetry and lyrical conceptualism.” Symmetry 2000 Part 2. ed. Hargittai, I. and T.C. Laurent. London: Portland Press, 2002, pp. 503-518. Lyco Art creates a conscious bridge between the impulsive, intuitional, and planned elements of the creative process, thereby moving along the whole continuum of formative energies. This creative process represents the interaction of emotion and intellect, wherein the passion of logic and the logic of passion are inexorably interwoven through the voyage of aesthetic consciousness. In applying theory to practice in design and painting, Lycoism finds its expression in coded colors and forms. Accordingly, warm hues and amorphous shapes might correspond to emotion and the irrational, while cold colors and geometric forms might express the rational and the logical. In addition, since science and technology impact so much of modern lifestyle during the electronic age, Lycoism views the relationship of art, science, and technology as a pivotal concern. Lycoism refuses to polarize science and art; instead, it seeks to unify aesthetics and ethics in works which involve the use of science and technology by the artist in the creation of beauty. In accordance with these premises, Hartal formed The Centre for Art, Science and Technology in Montreal during the 1980s. The Centre has implemented a variety of interdisciplinary projects exploring the connections between several branches of arts and sciences, including painting, poetry, music, architecture, communication, artificial intelligence, mathematics, cosmology, and space exploration.Costa, Barbara. “Dell’ ‘aeropittura’ futurista alla ‘Space Art’.“ Epiphaneia/2.

Founded in 1934 by J. Merton Rosauer, Rosauers was sold in 1984 to Spokane-based URM Stores, and it eventually grew to 22 stores under the Huckleberry's Natural Market, Rosauers, and Super 1 Foods brands. Its stores are located in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon. History In 1934, 20-year-old J. Merton Rosauer (1914–1990) purchased a small grocery store in Spokane, Washington, after obtaining a $1,000 loan from his parents. His father, Joseph P. Rosauer (1888–1961), owned two grocery stores in Spokane on East Sprague and in Parkwater, where Merton and younger brother Roswell worked. By 1938, Mert Rosauer sold his first store and invested in another grocery store. After selling off his second store, Rosauer opened his and Spokane's first supermarket in 1949. In 1984, prior to retiring, Rosauer sold the company to URM Stores, a grocery supplier based in Spokane. By June 1986, Rosauers was operating 25 stores in four U.S. states with about 1,500 employees. In September 1989, the Board of Directors for URM Stores made the decision to sell off the Rosauers chain. URM Stores agreed to sell 15 of the 24 Rosauers stores through an employee stock ownership plan in February 1990. On April 10, 1990, Spokane employees of Rosauers voted to accept amendments to their labor contracts that would allow the employee purchase of the company. With 425 of the 700 eligible employees voting, the final count was 377 for and 48 against the company's sale. The sale was completed on July 27, 1990, with the company's 1,250 employees receiving ownership of 15 supermarkets, one freestanding pharmacy, an ice cream plant, and the corporate office building. In November 1993, Rosauers was assessed $50,450 in civil fines for violating federal child labor laws at eight of its Spokane-area stores. Rosauers president Larry Geller said most of the violations involved one or two hours over the 18-hour weekly limit set for employees under age 16. A Rosauers store in Meridian, Idaho On June 13, 2000, Rosauers announced URM Stores had completed the purchase of Rosauers after more than 1,800 of Rosauers' employees voted in favor of the sale. In June 2000, the company operated 19 stores in the Inland Northwest. Following the acquisition, URM Stores became the fourth-largest employer in Spokane County. Since the sale to URM, Rosauers has opened two more stores, in Yakima, Washington (2002) and Bozeman, Montana (2007). In December 2008, Rosauers was forced to temporarily close its store on Francis Street in Spokane after of the store's roof collapsed from record snowfall. Spokane fire officials said no one was trapped in the debris and only a minor injury to a Rosauers employee was reported. The damage estimate for the roof collapse at the Francis Street location topped $1 million. In March 2011, Rosauers announced its plans to enter southern Idaho in 2012 with a store in the Boise area in Meridian. The Meridian store features a Huckleberry's Natural Market and a cooking school. Initially, Rosauers said additional stores were a possibility for the Treasure Valley if the Meridian store performs well, however, in October 2017, the chain announced the closure of the five-year-old store. Huckleberry's Natural Market In 1996, Rosauers opened the first Huckleberry's Natural Market on Spokane's South Hill. After proving to be a success, Rosauers opened another Huckleberry's in Spokane Valley in December 1996. The Spokane Valley store was eventually closed while the South Hill store remains in business. Since 1996, Rosauers has added Huckleberry's Natural Market sections to its new and existing stores.

The school converted to academy status in August 2011, and has a specialism in science. History The Campion School was founded in September 1962 by the Society of Jesus as a grammar school for Roman Catholic boys from the ages of 11 to 18. The first headmaster Fr Michael Fox SJ died that year. In 1965, after two successive headmasters, administration of the school was handed on to the Diocese of Brentwood. On opening, some of the original second and third year intake were transferred from St Ignatius' College, which was then located in Stamford Hill. For the first couple of years, Jesuit teachers were in the majority. The Jesuit community lived on the school site in rooms with full facilities in The Community House, which later became the first of three Sixth Form Blocks. Later, only a single, non-residential, Jesuit chaplain was retained as a link to the order. Pupils who attend the school are mainly Catholic and the school has a Catholic ethos. Around 1970, the first girls to attend Campion came from Ilford Ursuline School for specific sixth form classes such as Russian and Greek at the school, but there were not many. The school has an attached Sixth Form which admits a number of girls. The pupils that attend the Sixth Form do not have to be Catholic but have to respect the Catholic ethos that the school represents. The school received an Ofsted report in May 2012. The inspection judgements were rated as 2 (good) in all five categories. The school was awarded Specialist Science College status before converting to an academy in August 2011. however the school continues to offer science as a specialism. Forms Originally, when the school had around 660 all boys, it had three forms named after Fr Michael Fox SJ and Saints John Fisher and Thomas More.Campion Handbook 1975–76 from TheCampionSchool.org.uk. Retrieved 7 August 2017 However, each boy also belonged to a House named Gerard, Southwell and Garnet, denoted by a green, blue or red ribbon strip sewn the length of the top of the blazer pocket edge. The Houses met regularly, had a House Master and competed in sports. For a year or two school blazers even had a different crests for Fourth, Fifth and Sixth forms too. The school currently has five forms: * Fisher * More * Fox * Garnet * Southwell Sport The school has an outstanding sporting reputation both locally in Havering and nationally with a tradition of rugby.

It is also ranked amongst the top day schools in the country. History St. Mary's School I.C.S.E was founded in 1864 by members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), a Roman Catholic religious order founded by St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1540. It lies adjacent to St. Anne's Church which was established in 1860. It began as a Catholic school of education and a military orphanage. Later it opened to the Catholic populace in general, which meant it had to expand. This led to the construction of the building that now houses the senior school, whose foundation stone was laid by Lord Linlithgow, the Viceroy of India from 1936 to 1943. In recognition of its contribution in the field of education the Chief Postmaster General for Maharashtra released a special postal cover commemorating the school's 150th anniversary on 7 December 2013.http://www.indianphilately.net/news1113.html It used to confer the degree/diploma of a Cambridge University O level of education, and now confers the ICSE (Indian Certificate of Secondary Education) diploma. The school has four Gothic-style buildings and is divided into Senior School (grades 5 and above) and Junior School (grades 4 and below).

Biography In early 2001, Chase Johnson, Kelan and Braeden Hurley, along with Ryah Arthur formed Stulpigeon, a band that played mostly covers of songs by groups such as Foo Fighters and Incubus. Drummer Nick Gross joined the band in 2002. In 2006, the group, now called Open Air Stereo, gained national exposure on the MTV program Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. The band claims influences such as Rage Against the Machine, Muse, Incubus, Led Zeppelin and The Doors which is evident in their older work, but their more recent tracks seem to have adopted more of a pop punk Esq sound. The band independently released a self-titled EP in April 2005. Following the success of their break-thru single, they signed to Epic Records. They have released two albums titled Primates and Living Proof. 2008-present In March 2008, both Kelan Hurley (guitar) and Braeden Hurley (bass) left the band to pursue other passions according to the band's myspace, they have been replaced by Scott Pounds on guitar and Dan Pappas on bass. On September 11, 2008 drummer Nick Gross posted on the group's official website this statement. \\"If you guys haven't noticed, Open Air Stereo has gone on an indefinite hiatus. The issues that happened remain closed to the public for the time being. OAS hopes to regroup sometime towards the end of the year, but nothing is for sure.

He also worked on the News of the World and late in his career focused on criminal convictions he believed were miscarriages of justice.  Family and early life  Regan was born in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, in a home for single mothers. He was brought up in Hampstead in a mansion owned by his grandmother where many of the rooms were rented out. His parents were supporters of the Communist Party of Great Britain and were visited by many East European intellectuals. Regan attended Haverstock Comprehensive School, and wrote poetry for John O'London's Magazine while in his teens.  Journalistic career  Having moved to Winchester, Hampshire, Regan became a journalist on a local paper before moving to London as a freelance. In March 1967 the Press Council criticised him for a piece he contributed to The Sun about a woman who had become pregnant after a sterilization operation.\\"Mixed Verdict on 'No More Babies'\\", The Times, 30 March 1967. He landed a staff job on the News of the World in 1967 where he specialised in writing stories exposing cannabis-taking, Trotskyite student conspiracies, a world he was close to as a user of cannabis himself. Despite often attacking senior staff at the News of the World, Regan was popular with readers and wrote his pieces in line with the newspaper's view. He also worked on police corruption stories.  Royal reporter  After leaving the News of the World, Regan wrote biographies. He started with his former proprietor Rupert Murdoch, and then followed with two royal biographies. A reviewer found the biography of Murdoch \\"disgracefully ill-written and ill- constructed\\".Michael Leapman, \\"Pared-down style\\", The Times, 29 January 1976, p. 12. The Times was not then owned by Rupert Murdoch. Regan's biography of Prince Charles, \\"Charles, The Clown Prince\\", was based on letters and paintings by the young Prince which had been stolen from Buckingham Palace, and the Royal solicitors wrote to the publishers to remind them of the law of Copyright. His second royal biography, \\"Margaret - A Love Story\\", claimed to reveal details of Princess Margaret's love life. Meanwhile, Regan became a freelance editor and public relations adviser. He founded a journal which he called \\"Butterfly News\\", chiefly to attack personal targets including Coca- Cola, the National Farmers Union and the main figures in butterfly collecting.  Royal scandal  In April 1981, Regan obtained transcripts of telephone calls made by Prince Charles in Australia to Lady Diana Spencer, then his fiancée. In addition to revealing their intimate conversation, Charles could be heard making disparaging remarks about Malcolm Fraser, then Prime Minister of Australia, and about some aspects of Australian culture.Anthony Holden, \\"Palace says tapping of Prince contemptible\\", The Times, 5 May 1981, p. 1. They were bought by Die Aktuelle, a German magazine; the Prince and Lady Diana obtained an injunction preventing Regan from disclosing or publishing the contents of the transcripts,\\"Prince Charles given injunction on telephone tapping\\", The Times, 7 May 1981, p. 1. but Die Aktuelle was not affected and published the transcripts on 8 May despite a German court having also injuncted them against publication.Patricia Clough and Frances Gibb, \\"German weekly prints its version of royal conversations\\", The Times, 9 May 1981, p. 1. The Prince's lawyer later insisted that the tapes were forgeries, while Regan insisted they were genuine. Scallywag In 1989, Regan founded Scallywag magazine in South Dorset when the lure of journalism drew him back from his retirement in Butterfly World on Lodmoor Park, Weymouth. Initially Scallywag was a local magazine seeking to expose local issues. A recurrent theme was illegal tipping on the nearby Lodmoor refuse deport where he accused council staff of taking bribes to allow dangerous chemicals to be tipped. He also claimed widespread police corruption associated with Freemasonry in Dorset and claimed to have been beaten up by two off-duty policemen in College Lane, Weymouth. He also 'named and shamed' people he perceived as being paedophiles. However, like so many of his campaigns, no substantial legally acceptable evidence was ever produced. Regan was inspired by the early years of Private Eye, but he felt that the Eye had become too cautious of libel actions and determined not to fall into the same trap. At one difficult time he sold Scallywag to a friend, who had no assets, which allowed Regan greater freedom to pursue stories. Scallywag started to attract a loyal readership, although the major newspaper distributors refused to handle it (a situation Regan regarded as tantamount to censorship). Nevertheless, in 1991 Scallywag moved to London and became a national publication. Scallywag became a news story in itself in 1993 when it stoked a rumour that John Major, then Prime Minister, was having an affair with Clare Latimer, who was a freelance cook who helped with state dinners at 10 Downing Street. A story in the New Statesman showed how the rumours had been covertly mentioned in mainstream papers. When Major heard of the New Statesman story he sued both them and Scallywag for libel; he also sued the distributors and printers of both papers, which contributed to nearly driving the New Statesman out of business. Clare Latimer later claimed that \\"Mr Major used her as a \\"decoy\\" to prevent what would have been the more politically damaging exposure of the affair he had with Edwina Currie from 1984 to 1988.\\"\\"Major faces action over legal affair\\" BBC News, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2286916.stm New Statesman editor Peter Wilby said that, had Major's previous adultery been known at the time of the libel case, the outcome may have been different.  Out of business  Scallywag limped on but a 1994 story about Conservative politician Julian Lewis led to another series of libel actions which the magazine lost comprehensively. Scallywag disappeared from print and moved to a site on the World Wide Web instead. Lewis followed and won damages from Scallywag's internet service provider, closing the site down. Regan responded by accusing Lewis of lying, and decided to attempt to sabotage Lewis' campaign in New Forest East where he was Conservative candidate for the 1997 election. Unfortunately for Regan, Lewis was aware of an obscure section of electoral law and when he obtained a taped confession from Regan that his aim was to cost Lewis votes, Lewis was able to get Regan convicted of spreading false statements about an election candidate.David Hooper, \\"Reputations Under Fire : Winners and Losers in the Libel Business\\" (Little, Brown and Company, London, 2000), pages 369–71.  Later life  In his final years Regan devoted himself to propagating his belief that Diana, Princess of Wales had been killed in a conspiracy. He also set up a website called \\"Scandals in justice\\" which sought to expose wrongful convictions, and wrote occasionally for The Guardian. In 2000 he was convicted of \\"disseminating malicious falsehoods.\\" Regan was married and divorced twice; he had five daughters, one of whom (Charlotte) stood as an Independent in the 2001 general election in Regent's Park and Kensington North. He also had a son whom he never met. Regan died after a short illness in 2000.

In most applications, for any y\\\\in\\\\Omega\\\\,, k(x,y)\\\\, is a probability density function on \\\\Omega\\\\,. Note that in the definition above, n_t can be vector valued, in which case each element of \\\\\\\\{n_t\\\\\\\\} has a scalar valued integrodifference equation associated with it. Integrodifference equations are widely used in mathematical biology, especially theoretical ecology, to model the dispersal and growth of populations. In this case, n_t(x) is the population size or density at location x at time t, f(n_t(x)) describes the local population growth at location x and k(x,y), is the probability of moving from point y to point x, often referred to as the dispersal kernel. Integrodifference equations are most commonly used to describe univoltine populations, including, but not limited to, many arthropod, and annual plant species. However, multivoltine populations can also be modeled with integrodifference equations,Kean, John M., and Nigel D. Barlow. 2001. A Spatial Model for the Successful Biological Control of Sitona discoideus by Microctonus aethiopoides. The Journal of Applied Ecology. 38:1:162-169. as long as the organism has non-overlapping generations. In this case, t is not measured in years, but rather the time increment between broods. Convolution kernels and invasion speeds In one spatial dimension, the dispersal kernel often depends only on the distance between the source and the destination, and can be written as k(x-y). In this case, some natural conditions on f and k imply that there is a well-defined spreading speed for waves of invasion generated from compact initial conditions. The wave speed is often calculated by studying the linearized equation : n_{t+1} = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(x-y) R n_t(y) dy where R = df/dn(n=0). This can be written as the convolution : n_{t+1} = f'(0) k * n_t Using a moment-generating-function transformation : M(s) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} e^{sx} n(x) dx it has been shown that the critical wave speed : c^* = \\\\min_{ w > 0 } \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{w} \\\\ln \\\\left( R \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} k(s) e^{w s} ds \\\\right) \\\\right] Other types of equations used to model population dynamics through space include reaction- diffusion equations and metapopulation equations. However, diffusion equations do not as easily allow for the inclusion of explicit dispersal patterns and are only biologically accurate for populations with overlapping generations.Kot, Mark and William M Schaffer. 1986. Discrete-Time Growth Dispersal Models. Mathematical Biosciences. 80:109-136 Metapopulation equations are different from integrodifference equations in the fact that they break the population down into discrete patches rather than a continuous landscape.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. Early history It is difficult to trace the early history of the hall, because all early documents relating to the hall were kept in a bank vault in Manchester, which was destroyed in 1940 during World War II bombing. The manor of Haslington was acquired by the Vernon family as a consequence of the 14th- century marriage of Sir Thomas Vernon to Joan Lostock, heiress of Haslington. The house was built by Admiral Sir Francis Vernon in 1545, and contains parts of the original medieval manor house, which are said to date back to 1480. Additions and alterations were made to it in the 16th, 17th and 19th centuries. It is claimed that some of the timbers used in the early phase of construction were salvaged from ships of the Spanish Armada in 1588. In the late 19th century it was a farmhouse. In 1931 extensive repairs, alterations and additions were made. Architecture The house is built partly in timber framing and partly in brick, with a slate roof. It has two storeys and six bays. The timber-framed areas are decorated with herringbone bracing, quatrefoils and cusped concave-sided lozenges. The rear elevation is mainly in brickwork. Recent history Previous residents include Colonel H Watts and Mrs Lillian Watts. Mrs Watts was the first president of the Haslington and Crewe Green branch of the Women's Institute, founded in 1944. Confusion has arisen in several publications with Mrs Madge Watt, a Canadian lady who founded the Women's Institute in Britain in 1915; she returned to Canada in 1919 and is unlikely ever to have visited Haslington. () After the first World War Air Commodore Dame Felicity Peake, the first director of the Women's Royal Air Force and the daughter of Colonel H Watts, spent much of her youth in the house. The house was bought in 1970 by the millionaire Tony Vernon who established Murray Vernon, one of the largest independent dairy companies in the country. He restored the house over the next thirty years. Following his death in 2005, the house was sold for £3m to Mohammed Isaq. In 2014 the fire service visited a structure in the grounds of Haslington Hall known as The Big Marquee and found \\"serious\\" breaches in fire safety. The service issued a prohibition notice, which meant the company should immediately stop using the venue, which was ignored by Isaq on at least three occasions when firefighters visited the venue and weddings were taking place. Isaq had a previous conviction for fire safety breaches when in January 2012 he was fined and ordered to pay court costs totalling £23,815 to Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service for nine serious breaches of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, also at Haslington Hall. The honorary Recorder of Chester, Judge Roger Dutton, told Raja that the breaches were \\"flagrant\\" and put the public at risk. On the morning of 24 March 2018 firefighters from across the area were called to a fire at Haslington Hall. In April 2018 Cheshire Police were said to be investigating the fire, the cause of which is yet to be determined. In June 2018, Mohammed Isaq, 56, of Hale Barns, pleaded guilty to nine charges relating to his failure to comply with the Regulatory Reform Fire Safety Order 2005, and his failure to comply with an enforcement notice and failure to comply with a prohibition notice at his Haslington Hall. He was jailed for 20 months at Chester Crown Court for breaching serious fire safety rules. His company, Haslington Hall Ltd, where he was the major shareholder, also admitted the same breaches. The charges related to his failure to take general fire precautions to ensure the safety of employees and the public, placing them at risk of death and serious injury in case of fire. In December 2019 the hall and estate was sold to an undisclosed private owner.

He assumed the position in January 2007 and was handily reelected in November 2010. He was not a candidate for a third term in the August 2014 Republican primary election. From 1999 to 2007, he was the 18th state auditor of Wyoming. Because Wyoming has no position of lieutenant governor, under the terms of the state's constitution, the secretary of state is first in the line of succession to be governor. Early life and career Maxfield was born in Beloit, Wisconsin, to Ralph and Vera Maxfield. He graduated in 1963 from Joseph A. Craig High School in Janesville, Wisconsin. He first studied at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point before transferring to the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater, where he remained until 1966. From 1968 to 1972, he worked and resided in Wisconsin and then Michigan before he relocated to Wyoming. For twenty-three years, Maxfield served as an executive director for the YMCA and for more than a year, he was the head of the Wyoming branch of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In addition, Maxfield led the Wyoming Recreation Commission from 1987 to 1989, and the Wyoming Department of Commerce from 1989 to 1994. Political career Four years later he won election to state auditor and held the post until 2007, winning re-election in 2002. While he was auditor, Maxfield developed a scheme which would reimburse state employees called to active military duty for lost income and benefits. The plan was implemented in November 2001 as an executive order of then Governor Jim Geringer. With his term in office coming to a close, Maxfield sought and won election in 2006 to become Secretary of State - beating Libertarian candidate Dennis Brossman 82-18 percent. He assumed the office in January 2007. He won re-election in 2010 against Democrat Andrew Simons 76-20 percent. As Secretary of State, Maxfield is a member of the State Loan and Investment Board, the State Building Commission, and the Board of Land Commissioners, alongside his duties chairing the State Elections Canvassing Board. Among his actions as secretary, two have received particular attention. Early in his first term Wyoming was described as a 'fraud friendly' state alongside Delaware and Nevada, owing to the ability of companies to register in the state without actually having a physical presence there, which in turn allows them to avoid certain regulations and oversight of their financial activities. While a law was passed under his watch in that first term requiring companies to be present in the state to be registered - reportedly shutting down 4,000 corporations thereafter - Maxfield has been under pressure in his second for not meeting additional recommendations from the federal government: Maxfield has resisted calls for his office to hold detailed records on corporations - instead he argued they should be relied upon to hold their own records until called for by the state. He claims that drastic regulation would affect Wyoming's \\"business friendly tag\\". This has led to the threat that federal law enforcement may step in instead, and Maxfield has responded by drafting new rules to improve the effectiveness of state financial oversight. The second action is his lawsuit, beginning in late September 2011, to overturn the two-term limit on the five executive offices of the Wyoming state government, of which his own position is one. Approved by initiative in 1992, the term limits originally extended to state legislators as well, but in a separate lawsuit in 2004 that particular aspect of the initiative was declared unconstitutional and voided. That lawsuit did not cover the limit on the executive offices, but Maxfield argues the same principle which voided legislative term limits should be applied to the executive. Maxfield filed the motion as a 'private citizen' without consulting the other executive officers, but Governor Matt Mead expressed support for the attempt to resolve the legal uncertainties of the law - though he himself personally supports term limits - while then State Treasurer Joe B. Meyer supported Maxfield's position and opposed term limits. The Wyoming Supreme Court ruled in favor of Maxfield in 2013, when it struck down term limits for the positions of secretary of state, auditor, treasurer, and superintendent of public instruction. In addition, he has also succeeded in bringing his office into line with federal voting guidelines as well as creating an online campaign reporting system. Maxfield is the chairman of the NASS Securities Committee and serves on its National Task Force on the Formation of Business Entities. Personal life Married to clinical social worker Gayla Maxfield since 1988, he has four children (three from a previous marriage) and two grandchildren.

Housed in a building designed by James Barnet and built between built 1886 and 1887, the chapel was established in 1902 after conversion from the former sail loft and is the oldest Christian chapel of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and has stained glass windows and plaques from that era to the present. The chapel was added to the Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004 and the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 November 2004. The building is the oldest on Garden Island, two-storey, built of stuccoed brick with stone sills, arches and columns. The original loft floor of timber remains, caulked with oakum and bitumen. Setting Garden Island is on the southern shore of Port Jackson, the proper name for the harbour at Sydney, Australia. It is second promontory east of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The Royal Navy used the island from February 1788, just a month after Australia's colonisation by the First Fleet, as a garden for provisioning first and later the fleet based in the port. During the nineteenth century, the island became the support base for the fleet and various buildings were established including houses for senior staff. The stone and brick Rigging building was built in 1887, on the shoreside shelf at the northern end of the island, in which the chapel was later established. The building bears the dedication \\"VRI 1887\\", alluding to its construction during the reign of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (\\"Victoria Regina Imperatrix\\"). The building now sits at the north-eastern end of the Captain Cook Dry Dock, which was constructed in the channel between the island and the mainland and connected the island to the mainland shore at Potts Point. The building has been restored, including the wrought iron swing cranes adjacent to each major upper doorway which were formerly used to get rigging to and from the upper floor. These doorways in the Chapel are now stained glass windows. The main entrance is from the northern side. Features =Entrance= The entrance from street level leads to the winding wooden staircase to the main Chapel (right), and Chapel of Remembrance (left). At the entrance are three stained glass windows representing: * the Royal Australian Navy fleet and Battle Honours (around the main entrance doors); * the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS); * On the wall opposite the entrance doors, midway on the stairs, is a map showing the places where RAN Honours have been won, with at each side the current and former White Ensigns of the RAN. =Main Chapel= Naval Chapel at Garden Island, looking to the altar. Boat shaped pulpit at front-left. The main chapel is on the upper level of the building, accessed by a winding staircase from the main entrance. The layout was formerly with two equal lines of pews, until the modernisation when the Chapel of Remembrance was constructed. At that time the original stairs were removed and a staircase was erected from the new entrance. The Chapel of Remembrance could also be incorporated into the overall design of the space. The pulpit is shaped like the bow of a boat. Colours The Chapel houses the laid up or decommissioned Fleet monarch's Colours (Standards) received by the RAN since its formation in 1911, from: * George V * Elizabeth II (two colours – Pre-1967 and Post-1967) The current Fleet Colour is held at Fleet Headquarters, HMAS KUTTABUL, whilst the location of the Colour presented during the reign of King George VI is unknown. { RAN Colour of George V RAN Colour (first) of Elizabeth II RAN Colour (second) of Elizabeth II } Windows HMAS Sydney. Between them is the commemorative plaque for Rear Admiral Sir David Martin KCMG AO RAN, Governor of New South Wales. Bathurst class corvette window; Alpha and Omega symbols; names of the ships. The main chapel has various stained glass windows, some naturally lit and others in cases with back-lights. This list circles the chapel to the right from the altar.

Both have access only from the main Chapel; the Catholic chapel is at the rear, the Protestant near the front. A door connects the two, and also gives access to a small robing room that is shared with the main chapel. Each chapel has seating for about 20 people with an altar and lectern. =Chapel of Remembrance= Chapel of Remembrance The Chapel of Remembrance is accessed from the main entrance and then by several steps down, and occupies a portion of the area under the main chapel. It was officially opened on 25 August 1996 by Rear Admiral David Campbell, AM RAN, Flag Officer Naval Support Command, and dedicated by Principal Chaplains Michael Holtz AM RANR and Gareth Clayton RAN and Chaplain J.F.B. Connelly RAN. The front wall is faceted to allow plaques to be placed on the wooden screens. Two rough-hewn posts stand in the body of the chapel.

It is often called \\"valley within a valley\\" as it lies between the two arms of the northern part of the blue ridge mountain range in the Shenandoah Valley in the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians geological zone. The eastern ridgeline of Fort Valley is named Massanutten Mountain and is basically continuous for the eastern length of Fort Valley, with a short stretch called Waterfall Mountain in the extreme south of the valley. The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain which is actually higher in elevation than the 3 westernmost named mountains and between which is a smaller highland valley, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley also contains a small highland sub-valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. Duncan's Knob at 2,800 feet, on Catback Mountain, and Strickler's Knob at over 2,700 feet on Masanutten Mountain are the two highest points in the Fort Valley Ridgeline. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs or notches within the ridges of Fort Valley, and several minor gaps or lower points between the mountains accessible only by hiking trails. Fort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where Passage Creek flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crisman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain. In all, Fort Valley is long. Fort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the George Washington National Forest (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains, offering many outdoor recreation opportunities. The population of Fort Valley is 1,229 with a land area of approximately 70 square miles.https://www.bestplaces.net/people/zip- code/virginia/fort_valley/22652 The Elizabeth Furnace and Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. Geology The Fort Valley and Massanutten mountain range is the result of the Alleghanian Orogeny, the geologic process where a continental plate crumples and is pushed upwards to form mountain ranges. The Fort Valley is an enclosed synclinorium, a downward fold within the Massanutten range. Differential weathering produced the mountain/valley pattern within the Appalachian Ridge and Valley province to which Fort Valley, the Massanutten range and the adjacent Shenandoah and Page Valleys of Virginia belong. The valleys are limestones and flysch (shale + graywacke), susceptible to erosion. Over millennia, the Fort Valley was etched away due to low resistance of its limestone while the mountain ridges of the Massanutten range are a tough quartz sandstone (Massanutten Sandstone, correlative to the Tuscarora Sandstone further to the west in the Ridge and Valley regionhttps://www.dmme.virginia.gov/commercedocs/RI_45.pdf), more resistant to that erosion.https://opengeology.org/historicalgeology/virtual- field-experiences-vfes/massanutten/ Thus, the geologic floor of Fort Valley is primarily limestone, with flysch shale, siltstone and some bentonite. A defining feature of the Fort Valley is Passage Creek, now a small stream at the center of the valley but a remnant of a larger water force that carved out the Fort Valley as it appears today. Roads and Gaps Between Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of Woodstock to the Woodstock Tower, which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain. Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. Between Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley. Paved roads exit the valley at its northern end (S.R. 678) between Strasburg and Front Royal, at Edinburg Gap (S.R. 675) towards Edinburg, Moreland Gap (S.R. 730) towards New Market, and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards Luray. There is also a twisting gravel road that leads to Woodstock (S.R 758) over Powell Mountain. The Woodstock Tower observation platform is at the apex of Route 758, known locally as the Woodstock Tower Road. In the south end of Fort Valley, Forest Road 274 (Crisman Hollow Road) is a well-maintained gravel road that runs the length of Crisman Hollow, exiting Fort Valley and connecting to Route 211 at New Market Gap, a major thoroughfare between New Market and Luray. The main road in Fort Valley is Route 678, or the Fort Valley Road. This road runs most of the length of the valley at its center, closely paralleling Passage Creek. All other roads in the valley, paved or gravel, tend to disseminate from Fort Valley Road and circle back to it unless they exit the valley or are dead ended in the mountains. The only community store in the valley, the Fort Valley Country Store, is on the Fort Valley Road near the center of the valley, where Route 678 meets Route 758 coming from the west over the mountain from Woodstock. At Kings Crossing towards the south of valley, the Fort Valley Road divides between Route 730 and Route 675, both of which exit the valley through gaps, as previously noted. Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas The Tuscarora trail, a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above Shenandoah State Park on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the Tom's Brook Battlefield in the Shenandoah Valley. The Massanutten Trail circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley. The Woodstock Tower, built in 1935 by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is located on Powell Mountain, perched at 2,000 feet above Woodstock in the west and the floor of Fort Valley below to the east. Woodstock Tower is accessed via State Route 758 (Woodstock Tower Road), a gravel road with several challenging switchback turns on the western slope, or via hiking the Massanutten Trail which passes directly by the tower. The tower is a sightseeing attraction closely associated with Fort Valley, providing sweeping panoramic views of Shenandoah Valley and the seven bends of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River in the west, and the other Massanutten ridges and Page Valley to the east. Fort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area toward the northern apex of the valley, and Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail. Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and access to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.) Not far from Elizabeth Furnace and within the George Washington Forest are two notable and frequented swimming or wading holes within Passage Creek, one named Blue Hole and one named Buzzards Rock Hole (or Red Hole).https://swimmingholes.org/va.html#ELIZABETH%20FURNACE%20AREA These wading holes are not official or supervised and swimming in these natural areas is at one's own risk. The Little Fort Recreation Area off of Route 758, just down Powell Mountain from the Woodstock Tower and within the Little Fort Valley area between Powell and Green Mountain, has 10 established camp sites. It's often used by campers utilizing the nearby ATV and 4-wheel drive recreational access provided by the Forest Service, Peter's Mill Run Road, which runs through the Little Fort Valley. Forest Road 274, Crisman's Hollow Road in the Page County southern end of Fort Valley, is a popular but not crowded spot for primitive roadside camping in the George Washington National Forest, with access to several trails leading to Kerns, Catback and Middle mountains and the Massanutten Trail. Special Biological Areas The ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf History Fort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \\"Indian Basket,\\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for Lord Fairfax in 1748http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html. Prior to Washington's survey, a first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \\"The Fort.\\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \\"The Fort\\" and others soon followed.http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html According to tradition, Daniel Morgan built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of George Washington, with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the British during the American Revolution. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \\"The Fort.\\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the Continental Army's victory at Yorktown made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have built a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. The Munch House, one of the oldest structures in Fort Valley, built by an early German settler family which prospered in the valley. Photo 1-11- 2014The Daniel Munch House, a historic home and farm built in 1834 overlooking Passage Creek in Fort Valley, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Daniel Munch was a successful farmer and distiller, the son on early German settlers who moved to Fort Valley in 1779. The house has excellent examples of architectural details in the German tradition of northern Shenandoah Valley.https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/historic-registers/085-0363/ It was the only brick house in Fort Valley as late as 1937.http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_dmunch.html With abundant deposits of limonite iron ore, called Oriskany ore (considered premium grade at the time)https://www.dmme.virginia.gov/DGMR/civilwar_iron.shtml, along with limestone for the iron-making process and timber for fuel, Fort Valley supported an active iron industry early in its settled history. Blast furnaces fueled by charcoal processed purified molten iron into forms or \\"pigs\\" which were hammered into bars and sent to foundries. Elizabeth Furnace was a significant blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 – 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. The pig iron was transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in October 1864 during operations associated with the Battle of Cedar Creek. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp- content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm- res1.pdf. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site. Further to the south of Fort Valley, another pig iron furnace called Caroline Furnace was established around 1835. There were 35 buildings with about 120 workers at the height of times for Caroline Furnace, which produced pig iron for railroads. During the Civil War, both Elizabeth and Caroline furnaces produced pig iron for the Confederacy, transported to Richmond for production at the Tredegar Iron Works. Caroline Furnace was also destroyed by Union troops in 1864,https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/gwj/learning/history- culture/?cid=FSBDEV3_000460 part of Sheridan's 1864 campaign to destroy all of military value to the Confederacy - agriculture and industry - in the Shenandoah Valley region.https://www.shenandoahatwar.org/the-burning-the-fire- and-sword-of-war/ But unlike Elizabeth Furnace, Caroline Furnace was never rebuilt.

The design has become popular from the late twentieth century to suggest a science-fiction, military, corporate, or sports aesthetic. Bank Gothic is an exploration of geometric forms, and is contemporary with the rectilinear slab serif typeface City by Georg Trump (Gothic in this context means \\"sans-serif\\", at the time a common usage, rather than blackletter). The typeface also bears comparison with late-nineteenth-century engraving faces such as Copperplate Gothic, which were popular for business card and corporate stationery printing. The design was initially issued in small print sizes to allow this use. Metal type The original metal typeface was capitals-only in light, medium and bold in regular and condensed widths, with larger sizes released as Poster Gothic. According to McGrew, the range of sizes cast allowed smaller sizes to be used as small capitals for larger sizes. It became a standard design, with Monotype, Linotype, Ludlow and Intertype offering versions. When Linotype issued a digitization in the 1980s, small caps were added in the lower-case position, and this has become common in digital releases. Digitizations As American Type Founders ceased operations before issuing a digital version, various digitizations have been released by different companies, including Bitstream, ParaType (the Bitstream digitization, adding Cyrillic), and others. =Bank Gothic Pro= In 2010, FontHaus released an updated revival of the original Bank Gothic complete with a lowercase and small caps and a new suite of punctuation glyphs. The family consists of light, medium, and bold weights in both a regular and a condensed style. The new lowercase characters did not exist with the original release, and were modeled after many similar Morris Fuller Benton designs released by American Type Founders in the 1930s. =DeLuxe Gothic= In 2003, letterforms artist Michael Doret began work on DeLuxe Gothic—a derivative version of American Type Founder's Bank Gothic. Unlike the 1930s original, Doret’s font contains lowercase characters. The DeLuxe Gothic Family was released in OpenType format in 2010 by Alphabet Soup Type Founders with both regular and condensed styles as well as traditional shortcaps. DeLuxe Gothic was the name originally used by the Intertype Corporation for its version of Morris Fuller Benton's Bank Gothic. Prior to its September 8, 2010 release, it was known as Bank Gothic AS. =Morris Sans= Designed by Dan Reynolds for Linotype, Morris Sans is an extended Bank Gothic family including both lowercase letters and small capitals. The design has three weights in regular and condensed widths, and modern OpenType features. =Others= Elsner+Flake designed two typefaces which are based on the Bank Gothic typeface: Bank Sans EF and Bank Sans Caps EF. Both typefaces had 64 weights (Regular, Semi Condensed, Condensed, Compressed, Light, Regular, Medium, Bold) with italics and support Cyrillic. MADType designed the Aldrich typeface, which also based on the Bank Gothic typeface. Notes and references \\\\---- *Blackwell, Lewis. 20th Century Type.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 14 April 2016 Life and work Carlevarijs was born in Udine. He was also known as 'Luca Casanobrio' or 'Luca di Ca Zenobri', for his patronage by the latter family. He worked principally in Venice, where he also died. His daughter, Marianna Carlevarijs (1703 - 1750) learned the art of pastel portraiture from Rosalba Carriera.Pinacoteca Brera, Portrait of an unknown man (1737). Carlevarijs visited Rome. Here he was influenced by the Dutch painter Caspar van Wittel (often called Vanvitelli), who was a long-term resident of Rome. Van Wittel was the pioneer of the genre of vedute of Rome. Carlevarijs then started to create vedute of Venice, which are among the earliest Baroque depictions of the city. He painted landscapes, sea-pieces and perspective views. His works included cityscapes with a topological interest as well as imaginary landscapes with ruins. He completed over a hundred etchings of views in Venice, which give an exact representation of the principal places in that city.Venezia Riceve In Pompa Magna Il Cardinale Cesare D’estrees uno spaccato offerto da Carnevarijs ' The painters Canaletto, Francesco Guardi and Antonio Visentini are said to have been influenced by his work or even have been his pupils. His paintings and his set of 104 etched views of Venice, which were published in 1703, were the foundation on which Canaletto and Guardi built. Johan Richter collaborated with him. He also collaborated with specialist figure painters who added the staffage into his landscapes or cityscapes.Luca Carlevarijs (Udine 1663-Venice 1730), A Seaport with a Fountain and Ruins at the Royal Collection He worked mostly in Venice.

It runs for just from an intersection with NY 5S in the hamlet of Rotterdam Junction to NY 5 in the town of Glenville. In between, the route crosses the Mohawk River at Erie Canal at Lock 9\\\\. When it was assigned in the early 1930s, it was the only crossing of the Mohawk River between Pattersonville and downtown Schenectady. It later became the only bridge between Amsterdam and Schenectady. Its regional importance declined following the completion of NY 890 near Schenectady in 1998. In late 2011, NY 103 was closed for three months to repair parts of the road damaged by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Route description NY 103 heading southbound from with NY 5 in Glenville NY 103 begins at an intersection with NY 5S in Rotterdam Junction, a hamlet in the town of Rotterdam. The highway heads northward as the two-lane Bridge Street, serving a block of homes as it intersects Alexander Drive and Leonard Road. An intersection with Riverside Drive marks the end of the second block and the start of the third, where NY 103 passes the only bit of commercial activity along the highway. From here, the route leaves the hamlet and begins to rise as it crosses a steel truss bridge over the Mohawk River, here part of the Erie Canal. The last third of the span crosses Erie Canal Lock 9\\\\. On the north side of the river, the route serves Lock 9 State Park before terminating at an intersection with NY 5 in a rural part of the town of Glenville. The entirety of NY 103 is part of New York State Bicycle Route 5 (NY Bike Route 5), a cross-state bicycle route extending from Niagara Falls to the Massachusetts state line at New Lebanon. NY Bike Route 5 continues west from NY 103 on NY 5S and east from NY 103 on NY 5. History =Designation= The connector over the Mohawk River between Rotterdam Junction and Glenville was designated NY 103 in the early 1930s. At the time, it was one of only two river crossings between Amsterdam and Schenectady, a distance of ; the other connected the hamlets of Pattersonville and Hoffmans to the northwest. The Pattersonville–Hoffmans crossing was eliminated , leaving NY 103 as the only means over the river between Amsterdam and Schenectady. The New York State Thruway was constructed along the southern bank of the river in the early 1950s; however, NY 103 retained its importance as part of a toll-free alternate route between Amsterdam (via NY 5) and Schenectady (NY 5S). The route also served as a bypass of Scotia, a village west of Schenectady on NY 5. From the early 1970s up through the late 1990s, traffic at the east end of NY 5S fed directly into Interstate 890 (I-890); likewise, traffic on I-890 west could only access NY 5S or the Thruway. In order to travel between Thruway exit 26 and the north side of the Mohawk River, travelers would have to use either the NY 5 bridge in downtown Schenectady or NY 103. A connector leading north from Thruway exit 26 to NY 5 west of Scotia was completed in 1998 and designated NY 890\\\\. The new road lessened the importance of NY 103 as it provided a river crossing that both bypassed Scotia and directly connected to the Thruway. However, NY 103 continues to serve as the only access road to Lock 9 of the Erie Canal and its nearby picnic and fishing area. =Damage after Irene and Lee= Reconstruction of NY 103 just south of the intersection with NY 5 after damage from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. The bridge carrying NY 103 over the Mohawk River was significantly damaged in September 2011 by flooding and debris from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. State officials considered the damage to the structure to be \\"serious\\", and worries arose over the bridge's structural integrity. Officials from the state of New York considered reopening the bridge on September 7, but decided against it over concerns that approaching rains would cause further damage to the structure. On a related note, the flooding also caused the Mohawk River to carve a new route through the area around Rotterdam Junction. A portion of NY 103 north of the bridge was undermined by the new course, and it collapsed into the river on September 8\\\\. Also damaged was Lock 9, which adjoins the NY 103 bridge over the Mohawk River. For the next three months, the bridge over the Mohawk River and NY 103 remained closed while repairs were made to the long collapsed section of roadway near NY 5\\\\. This section also had structural issues due to the flooding. The project cost $3 million, paid for by federal aid received by United States Senators Charles Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and was completed by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) on December 22, 2011, two weeks earlier than planned. In all, NY 5 received of soil and of stone to protect the roadway from future floods. NY 103 had its roadway reconstructed, a new sidewalk installed on the western side of the highway, and new signage and guide rails installed in both directions.

A revised plan, adding three stories and raising the height to , was approved on December 13, 2001. However, due to the downturn in the office market after the dot-com bust, developer Tishman Speyer froze the project waiting for economic conditions to improve. In 2006, five years after the building was approved for construction, work on the tower finally began. In January 2008, Tishman Speyer signed DLA Piper to occupy floors 22 to 26 of the tower. In March 2008, law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher agreed to take up of office space in the tower. In October 2009, Intellectual Property law firm Novak Druce + Quigg moved into the 34th floor penthouse of the building. As of summer 2008, close to half of the building's office space has been leased, with the possibility of more tenants moving in. In 2010, Deloitte signed a 15-year lease to occupy 10 floors of the building, becoming the anchor tenant, and taking up most of the remaining space.

Maxi is Irene McCoubrey (born 23 February 1950), Dick is Barbara Dixon (born 4 April 1952) and Twink is Adele King (born 4 April 1951). Formation The group emerged from the 'Young Dublin Singers' who were playing in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin one summer when producer Fred O'Donovan said he wanted backing singers for recordings. He chose McCoubrey, Dixon and King, and initially they did vocal backings for showbands on singles such as \\"Old Man Trouble\\" by The Royal Blues, \\"Nora\\" by Johnny McEvoy, \\"Quick Joey Small\\" by The Real McCoy, \\"Cinnamon\\" by The Trixons, \\"Joys Of Love\\" by The Dixies and \\"Papa Sang Bass\\" by The Ranchers. In 1967 O'Donovan suggested they be launched as a group.Don't put your daughter on stage, Mrs. King - an interview/profile of Adele 'Twink' King, by Jack MoloneyBandstand article - The Sligo Champion (20 March 1970) Performances They performed on Hughie Green's British TV showcase Opportunity Knocks and had a thirteen-week stint on Irish television series Steady As She Go-Goes. They made two 45 singles with Columbia Records, \\"Things You Hear About Me\\" (which had taken second place behind Dana's \\"All Kinds Of Everything\\" in the Irish National Song Contest in 1970) b/w \\"Catch The Bride's Bouquet\\" and \\"Tangerines Tangerines\\" b/w \\"Sweet Eye\\". The group toured Ireland and Britain before travelling to Canada in the freezing winter of 1970 with one of the top Irish bands of the time, The Bye-Laws; together they were known as 'The Toybox'. The tour went badly, according to Twink: \\"We seemed to be on an endless safari through the most abandoned outposts in the arctic part of the country. Our nerves got more and more on edge.\\" There was a great deal of bickering and rowing and tension between the girls, and The Bye-Laws announced that they were breaking away. \\"This was in the William Pitt Hotel in Chatham, Manitoba, a one horse town which even the horses had left!\\". They invited Twink to go with them and she decided to do so; thus 'Maxi, Dick and Twink' came to an end. Naturally the other two girls were upset but they too realised that it was over for them as a group. Solo careers The three members went on to considerable solo success. When they returned from Canada to Ireland that Spring of 1971, The Bye-Laws started to play around the cabaret joints as 'Twink and The Bye- Laws'. Soon afterwards Twink left to join Brendan Bowyer's new band 'The Big 8' between 1971 and 1974. Barbara Dixon sang with Bowyer's former group, 'The Royal Showband' during 1972, and married Peter Law of The Pacific Showband, with whom she emigrated to Canada in the mid-1970s. She released a solo album Take All Of Me in 1979 under her married name Barbara Law, as well as becoming an actress, including a Genie Award-nominated appearance in the thriller film Bedroom Eyes.\\"Bay Boy reels in 11 Genie nominations\\". The Globe and Mail, February 15, 1985. Maxi sang with 'Danny Doyle and Music Box' before going solo. She represented Ireland twice in the Eurovision Song Contest: in 1973 singing \\"Do I Dream\\"; and again in 1981 with \\"Horoscopes\\", as part of another all-girl trio, 'Sheeba' with Marion Fossett and Frances Campbell. Sheeba also competed to be the Irish Eurovision entry in 1982 with \\"Go Raibh Maith Agat (Thank You)\\". Maxi then embarked on a career in radio and television broadcasting with the Irish national broadcaster RTÉ. Twink likewise entered the Irish national Eurovision competition in 1972 with \\"It'd Take A Miracle\\". Twink became an actress and regular TV celebrity. During an April 1982 episode of her RTÉ series Twink, Maxi, Dick and Twink staged a once-off reunion.

Prior to the NFL Brown went to high school in San Luis Obispo, California, and Hartnell College in Salinas, California. He played for the University of San Francisco Dons through 1951. On his senior year (1951), he quarterbacked the Dons to an undefeated 9-0 season, but the team did not receive a Bowl invitation, largely due to racism towards the black players on the team. Despite the increasing integration of college and pro football, the major bowls that year did not select teams that had black players, or they asked the teams to not bring their black players. The Dons refused to send a white-only squad, so they were snubbed. The 1951 Dons featured Ollie Matson and Burl Toler, both superb players who happened to be African-American. Matson played with great success in the NFL and made the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Toler went on to become the first black official in the NFL. The 1951 Dons are sometimes considered the greatest collection of players ever on one college team. Besides Matson, Toler, and Brown, the Dons had Gino Marchetti, Bob St. Clair, Dick Stanfel, and five other players who made the NFL. In addition, the Dons' head coach Joe Kuharich went on to coach in the NFL and the Dons' athletic news director (publicist) was none other than Pete Rozelle. Despite their great success (or maybe because of it), USF discontinued its football program after the 1951 season due to the high cost of running a top-notch football team. NFL career =Chicago Bears years= Brown was drafted by George Halas' Chicago Bears in the sixth round of the 1952 NFL Draft. But Brown was drafted by the Marines and spent two years in service. He did play for the Camp Pendleton football squad. Brown began playing in 1954 as the third string quarterback for the Bears, behind George Blanda and Zeke Bratkowski. In 1955, with Bratkowski in the military, Brown beat out Blanda for the starting job and led the Bears to an 8-4 record and a very close second-place finish to the Los Angeles Rams. Brown developed a reputation as a long-ball throwing, downfield quarterback, connecting often with Harlon Hill, who led the league with 9 touchdown receptions. Brown had his finest season in 1956, playing for new Bears' head coach Paddy Driscoll (Halas was still owner and GM and would soon return as coach). Brown led the league that year in passing, completing 96 of 168 passes for 1,667 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He had an amazing 9.9 yards per attempt. Hill remained his favorite target, catching 47 passes for 1,128 yards (a 24.0 yard per catch average), and 11 touchdowns. The Bears won the Western Conference with a 9-2-1 record, leading the league in rushing and scoring while finished second in rushing in rushing defense. They met the New York Giants in the 1956 Championship Game on December 30 at Yankee Stadium. The 1956 game was the second \\"sneakers\\" game in Bears-Giants history (the first was in 1934), with the Giants again gaining an advantage by switching to sneakers vice cleats on an icy field. The Giants destroyed the Bears 47-7, intercepting Brown twice, sacking him multiple times for -34 yards and shutting down Rick Casares and the Bears' running attack. The Bears completed 20 of 47 passes for only 247 yards and no touchdowns. It got so bad that the Bears abandoned the T-formation and switched to a single-wing variant in the third quarter. In 1957, the Bears appeared to still be affected by the 1956 title game, slumping to 5-7 with an anemic running attack and a mediocre year by Ed Brown. All of Brown's numbers were down from the previous season. Zeke Bratkowski got back from military service and began to challenge Brown for the quarterback job. In 1958, George Halas took back the coaching job and pushed the Bears back into second place at 8-4, one game behind the Baltimore Colts. Brown played better, throwing for 1,418 yards and 10 touchdowns. Brown again had a good year in 1959 but the Bears finished at 8-4 again, again second behind Baltimore. Brown passed for a career-high 1,881 yards and 13 touchdowns. By 1960, Brown began to slow up and fall out of favor with Halas, so Bratkowski got more and more playing time. Brown completed only 40% of his passes that year as the Bears finished in fifth. In 1961, Brown was benched in favor of newly acquired Billy Wade. Throughout his years with the Bears (except 1961), Brown was their starting punter, leading the league in punts attempted in 1959 with 64. =With the Steelers = Before the 1962 season, Brown was traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers where he remained a back-up, now to Bobby Layne. Brown got another chance to start in 1963 for the Steelers and, still specializing in the long-ball, had his biggest numbers, completing 168 of 362 passes for 2,982 yards, 21 touchdowns, and 20 interceptions. The next year, 1964, Brown played his last year as a starter, throwing for 1,990 yards for the mediocre Steelers. He played one more season as a backup, was waived and picked up by Baltimore late in the season. Brown played in the season finale behind running back Tom Matte who was filling in at quarterback after injuries to both Johnny Unitas and Gary Cuozzo. Brown completed 3 of 5 passes, including an 81-yard touchdown. He was ineligible under existing rules to play in the Colts playoff loss to eventual champion Green Bay. Brown retired after the 1965 season. Brown also punted for the Steelers, starting each year except his last. Brown finished with 949 completions, 1,987 attempts, 15,600 yards, 102 touchdown passes, and 138 interceptions. He rushed for 960 yards and 14 touchdowns during his career. Brown also finished with 498 punts and a 40.5 yard average per punt. At the end of 2006, Brown ranked 137 on the all-time Death Brown died on August 2, 2007 in Kennewick, Washington of prostate cancer.

Released in 1988, they were a development of the desktop PC-1512 and PC-1640 models. As portable computers, they contained all the elements necessary to perform computing on the move. They had a keyboard and a monochrome LCD display built in and also had space for disposable batteries to power the PC where a suitable alternative power source (i.e. mains or 12 volt vehicle power) was not available. The PCs came with either one or two double density double side floppy disc drives and the PPC640 model also featured a modem. Both models were supplied with 'PPC Organiser' software and the PPC640 was additionally supplied with the 'Mirror II' communications software. Hardware Amstrad PPC 512, open Amstrad PPC 512, closed Amstrad PPC 640 The two computers had very similar specifications. The PPC512 had an NEC V30 processor running at 8 MHz, 512 KiB of memory, a full-size 102-key keyboard with a numeric keypad, a built-in liquid crystal display (not backlit)Amstrad PLC: PPC 512S / 512D PPC 640S / 640D Personal Portable Computer Service Manual pp 16,30 that could emulate the CGA or MDA and either one or two 720k 3.5\\" floppy drives (the model was either the PPC512S or PPC512D depending on the number of drives it had). The PPC640 was otherwise identical except that it had 640 KiB of memory, a built-in 2400 baud modem (unusually fast for its day), and its case was a darker shade of grey. Both versions of the machine had an empty socket on the main circuit board so that an Intel 8087 coprocessor could be installed to permit hardware processing of floating point arithmetic. The PPC included standard connectors for RS-232, Centronics and CGA/MDA video, allowing existing peripherals to be used. All the signals used by the 8-bit ISA bus were also available through a pair of expansion connectors. There was available an external card cage for expansion cards. Four possible power sources could be used:The Amstrad Portable PPC512/640 User Instructions (Pub J2220101A) * Ten C-size alkaline batteries. (10 x 1.5v = 15 volts, but the load was such the voltage dropped to nearer 12 volts in use.) * Mains adaptor * Car cigarette lighter. * An Amstrad PC-MD, PC-CD or PC-ECD Monitor. (These monitors all contained a power supply) The physical layout of the components was unlike most laptop designs: instead of the lid containing the screen, it contained the keyboard. The hinges were therefore at the front of the main unit, rather than the back. The LCD was hinged separately and folded down into a recess on the top of the system unit. The one or two floppy drives were located on the right-hand side. When closed, the size of the PPC was 45 cm wide × 10 cm high × 23 cm deep. A bank of six DIP switches was used to select whether the video hardware emulated CGA or MDA, and whether to use an internal or external monitor. No official hard drive option or docking station was manufactured, but both were sold by third-party manufacturers. Software MS-DOS 3.3 was supplied with all PPCs, along with 'Organizer' - a memory-resident suite of utilities including a card file, diary, calculator and telephone dialler. In addition, the PPC 640 was supplied with Mirror II, a communications package for use with the built-in modem. The MS-DOS boot disk also included a utility which could be used to switch between the internal display and an external monitor without rebooting. Amstrad PC20 / Sinclair PC200 Sinclair PC200 In late 1988 Amstrad created a desktop computer based on the PPC design, intended for the home market. The LCD was replaced by an RF modulator to display CGA video on a domestic television, and the keyboard and system unit were combined in an integrated case similar to the original Atari ST or the Amiga 500. The second floppy drive bay was replaced by two ISA slots, though the design of the case was such that any cards fitted would protrude from the top of the computer. The PC200 had a black case and 'Sinclair' branding, while the PC20 was white and branded 'Amstrad'. Some PC20s also omitted the RF modulator and its support circuitry. In addition to MS-DOS 3.3 and Organizer, the PC20/PC200 was supplied with GEM and four CGA-compatible games. The graphical capabilities (CGA) and sound output (PC speaker) were greatly inferior compared to other home computers of the time. Consequently, the PC20/PC200 was not a commercial success. Although the PC20/PC200 does not support today's floppy disk drives through the built-in FDD connector, it uses a compatible floppy disk controller (Zilog Z765a) that can work after modification of this cable, though only with 720k disks; those modifications are - * pin 10 (drive select 0) on the board connector side, goes to pin 14 on the drive side * pin 16 (motor on) on the board connector side, goes to pin 10 on the drive side * pin 2 (disk change) on the connector board side, goes to pin 34 on the drive side References * Amstrad PPC Technical Manual * \\"The PPC: A carry out for the future?\\" Amstrad Professional Computing, March 1988. * www.retro-zone.org Amstrad PPC (archived) * MCbx Old Computer Collection - Amstrad PPC512 * Sinclair PC200 Service Manual * Category:IBM PC compatibles Category:Amstrad ","title":"PPC 512"},{"id":"7992638","text":"LUMINA, also known as 201 Folsom Street, is a 655-unit residential condominium project in the Rincon Hill neighborhood of San Francisco.

Abraham (Adolf) Berliner (May 2, 1833 – April 21, 1915) (Hebrew: אברהם ברלינר) was a German theologian and historian, born in Obersitzko, in the Grand Duchy of Posen, Prussia. He received his first education under his father, who was teacher in Obersitzko. He continued his education under various rabbis, preparing himself at the same time for the University of Leipzig, where he received the degree of doctor of philosophy. After serving for some time as preacher and teacher in Arnswalde, Berliner was called (1865) to Berlin as superintendent of the religious school maintained by the society for Talmudic studies (Ḥebrat Shas), and in 1873, when Israel Hildesheimer opened the rabbinical seminary in Berlin, Berliner was elected professor of Jewish history and literature. In this position, as well as in that of author, he displayed an untiring activity. His edition of Rashi's commentary to the Pentateuch (1866) first made him known as a scholar; he added to his reputation by various historical works, the result of his studies in the archives and libraries of Italy, which country he frequently visited, subventioned by the German government. Berliner edited for two years (1874–75) the scientific periodical Magazin für Jüdische Geschichte und Literatur, which from 1876 to 1893 he, together with his colleague, David Hoffmann, continued under the title Magazin für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums. It was due to his zeal that the society Meḳiẓe Nirdamim, for the publication of works of the older Jewish literature, which had been discontinued for several years, was revived in 1885 with Berliner as its director. He further acted as the apologist of Judaism in a pamphlet against Lagarde (Prof. Paul de Lagarde, nach Seiner Natur Gezeichnet, 1887), who denounced all Jewish scholars as dilettanti; and when the blood accusation was revived, he republished (1888) the opinion of Cardinal Ganganelli—afterward Pope Clement XIV—to prove the falsity of this charge. While Orthodox in his religious views, Berliner was never a fanatic. He not only associated in his scientific work with the liberals, but also paid a high tribute to the merits of Moritz Steinschneider, on the occasion of the latter's seventieth birthday (1886), by compiling a bibliography of that eminent scholar's works.

Fougère also served as Chair of the Council of Priests for the Diocese of Antigonish and served on the Board of Governors for Saint Francis Xavier University. On December 11, 1991, Pope John Paul II appointed Father Fougère the twelfth Bishop of Charlottetown. Fougère was consecrated and installed as Bishop of Charlottetown at St. Dunstan's Basilica on March 19, 1992. As Bishop of Charlottetown, Fougère served as a member of the National Council of the Canadian Catholic Organization for Development and Peace and was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Catholic Mission in Canada for the year 2000. Bishop Fougère resigned his post on July 11, 2009 citing health reasons, becoming Bishop Emeritus. Pope Benedict XVI appointed Bishop Richard Grecco as his replacement. Bishop Fougère died on June 18, 2013 at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, aged 70.

In other words, a Fréchet surface is a way of thinking about surfaces independently of how they are \\"written down\\" (parametrized). The concept is named after the French mathematician Maurice Fréchet. Definitions Let M be a compact 2-dimensional manifold, either closed or with boundary, and let (X, d) be a metric space. A parametrized surface in X is a map :f : M \\\\to X that is continuous with respect to the topology on M and the metric topology on X. Let :\\\\rho (f, g) = \\\\inf_{\\\\sigma} \\\\max_{x \\\\in M} d \\\\left( f(x), g(\\\\sigma(x)) \\\\right), where the infimum is taken over all homeomorphisms σ of M to itself. Call two parametrized surfaces f and g in X equivalent if and only if :\\\\rho (f, g) = 0. An equivalence class [f] of parametrized surfaces under this notion of equivalence is called a Fréchet surface; each of the parametrized surfaces in this equivalence class is called a parametrization of the Fréchet surface [f]. Properties Many properties of parametrized surfaces are actually properties of the Fréchet surface, i.e. of the whole equivalence class, and not of any particular parametrization. For example, given two Fréchet surfaces, the value of ρ(f, g) is independent of the choice of the parametrizations f and g, and is called the Fréchet distance between the Fréchet surfaces.

Klein was killed in the Battle of Bint Jbeil after jumping on a grenade to save his fellow soldiers. Early life Klein was born and raised in Raanana, Israel. His parents, Aharon and Shoshana Klein, were Holocaust survivors. His father's side originated from Germany and fled to Israel at the onset of World War II. Most of his mother's family was killed in the Holocaust. Klein was involved in the Bnei Akiva youth movement as a teenager. He excelled in his studies at the Amit Technological High School, completing his mathematics matriculation in 10th grade, and took a few undergraduate mathematics courses during high school. After graduating high school, he studied at the Bnei David mechina (pre-military preparatory school). He studied Jewish religious texts and took part in hard physical training to prepare for his service. As his service approached he increased his physical training, and embarked on long-distance runs from Raanana to Netanya.http://www.roiklein.co.il/roi.aspx?lang=eng Later life and military service Klein was drafted into the IDF in August 1994. He was accepted into the Paratroopers Brigade. During this time, the South Lebanon conflict was happening, with the IDF fighting Lebanese guerrillas in the Israeli security zone in southern Lebanon. To counter guerrilla attacks, the IDF set up the elite Egoz Reconnaissance Unit, an elite unit of the Golani Brigade, which was to conduct raids against guerrillas, and Roi's unit was among those selected to be its founding members. As a result, Klein became a member of the Golani Brigade, and would rise through its ranks. Klein served in the southern Lebanon security zone before being honorably discharged from the army in August 1998. After his discharge, Klein returned to the mechina, where he devoted himself to Torah study for a year, then went on a two-month tour of Africa. When he returned to Israel, he accepted an offer from Hagai Mordechai, the commander of the Egoz Unit, to return to service and supervise training procedures in the unit. One year later, he re- entered military service as the Egoz Unit's training platoon commander. He built a training plan that would subsequently become the model for the Egoz Unit. During the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Roi was leading a final mission in the Bint Jbeil area, leading a unit of Egoz cadets on a stakeout on the request of Hagai Mordechai so the trainees could experience \\"a taste of Lebanon\\", and were left behind by the premature IDF withdrawal, leaving them trapped in Lebanon. The unit was ultimately extracted by helicopter. In 2001, during the Second Intifada, Klein commanded an ambush in the Nablus area in which five Palestinian terrorists were killed. The following year, he was commended for this action. In 2002, Klein met his future wife Sarah, originally from Denmark, through mutual friends, and married shortly after. The couple moved to the West Bank and built a home in the Israeli outpost of Hayovel, near the settlement of Eli. The couple had two sons: Gilad and Yoav. That same year, Klein began to study for a degree in Industrial Engineering and Management as part of a special program for military personnel, in which the army would pay for his tuition. Despite having been accepted into the Technion, one of Israel's most prestigious universities, Klein instead chose to study at the Ariel University Center of Samaria in the West Bank settlement of Ariel so he could continue to live in Hayovel and pursue religious studies at the kollel in Eli. He excelled in his engineering studies, and qualified for the honors' scholarship every year, meaning the army did not need to pay his tuition. He graduated with honors. In 2006, Klein was appointed deputy commander of the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade, a position he held at the time of his death. Death in action During the 2006 Lebanon War, Klein and his unit took part in the Battle of Bint Jbeil. During a Hezbollah ambush, a hand grenade was thrown over the wall that was between Hezbollah militants and Klein and his unit. Klein jumped on the live grenade and muffled the explosion with his body. The soldiers reported that Klein recited the Jewish prayer, Shema Yisrael, as he jumped on the grenade. After the grenade exploded and critically wounded him, he reported his own death, yelling \\"Klein's dead, Klein's dead\\" over the radio. In the following minutes, as he lay dying, he ordered soldiers who came to administer first aid and evacuate him to focus on Lieutenant Amichai Merhavia, another soldier who had been hit (and later died also) instead. He then handed over his encoded radio to another officer, who took command of the force, and died.. According to The Telegraph he yelled \\"Long live Israel\\", although this was probably a misinterpretation of \\"Shema Yisrael\\". Legacy Roi Klein became a symbol for heroism in Israel. New schools in Netanya and Raanana have been named after him. Institutions named after Klein exist throughout Israel, and Torah scrolls were written in his honor. The Senior Class 2006 from Leon Pinelo Jewish High School in Lima, Perú, have been named after him. For his actions during the war, Klein received the Medal of Courage posthumously. Klein's home was among 12 homes that were subject to a petition by the Israeli group Peace Now demanding they be demolished, claiming they were built on private Palestinian land. In July 2009, the Israel High Court of Justice ordered the demolition of Klein's home, where his family was still residing, among the 11 other homes. Klein's home was ultimately the only one spared: 10 other homes and part of the 11th were demolished in 2015.. In 2016, Klein's widow Sarah married Rabbi Yigal Levinstein, who had been one of Klein's teachers.

History  After several years of failed albums and singles, America returned to the top ten in 1982 with their Russ Ballard-penned single, \\"You Can Do Magic\\". In an effort to recreate this success, America had Ballard produce their 1983 album, Your Move. The results of that collaboration, however, were not altogether successful on an artistic or a commercial level. On America's next album, Perspective, the group went in a radically different direction. The album, featuring three different producers — Matthew McCauley, Richie Zito and Richard James Burgess — and a multitude of prominent session musicians, represented America's foray into the synthesizer-laden music popular in the mid-1980s, including the use of DMX Drums. Band members Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell were credited as executive producers on the project. It reached #185 on the Billboard pop album charts in November 1984, and was the last America album to make the charts at all until The Complete Greatest Hits did so in 2001. It was America's last studio album for Capitol Records, the last full-length studio album from the group until Hourglass was released in 1994, and the group's last major-label studio album until Here & Now in 2007. Perspective contains two minor hit singles, \\"Special Girl\\" and \\"Can't Fall Asleep to a Lullabye\\". \\"Special Girl\\", with lead vocals by Beckley, reached number 106 on Billboards Bubbling Under and number 15 on its adult contemporary charts in October 1984. \\"Can't Fall Asleep to a Lullaby\\" (misspelled as \\"Lullabye\\" on the album cover) features lead vocals by Bunnell and backing vocals by Steve Perry of Journey. It reached number 26 on the Billboard adult contemporary charts in January 1985. Perry returned the favor by featuring Bunnell in a brief cameo appearance in the video for his 1984 hit single, \\"Oh Sherrie\\". The album also features \\"Stereo\\", a collaboration between Beckley and songwriter Jimmy Webb, and the reggae-influenced \\"Lady with a Bluebird\\", co-written by Bunnell, Bill Mumy and Robert Haimer. Mumy and Haimer (known for their novelty recording act, Barnes & Barnes) also shared writing credits on \\"(Can't Fall Asleep to A) Lullaby\\" with Bunnell and Perry. Timothy B. Schmit (of Poco and the Eagles) provided backing vocals on \\"Cinderella\\". Perspective was recorded, engineered and mixed in a number of locations around Los Angeles, including at Amigo Studios in North Hollywood, Oasis Recording Studio in Universal City, United Western Studios in Hollywood and Larrabee Sound in West Hollywood. The front cover of the album shows Beckley and Bunnel standing in front of 100 Wilshire, located at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Ocean Avenue in Santa Monica, California. Completed in 1971, it is the tallest building in Santa Monica. A longer version of \\"Can't Fall Asleep To A Lullaby\\" was included on Encore: More Greatest Hits, released in 1991. Originally released only on vinyl and cassette, Perspective was first issued in the CD format in the United States by the now-defunct One Way Records in 1998. Reception AllMusic concluded that the album's \\"slight\\" songs and over-reliance on synthesizers make it no more than an \\"endearingly mediocre\\" period piece. However, they did give a nod to \\"the natural harmonies of Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell\\" and contended that the album is at least a significant improvement over its predecessor, Your Move.

It is the extinct nominate subspecies of the Tasman starling, the only other subspecies being the also-extinct Lord Howe starling (A. f. hulliana). Distribution The Norfolk starling was confined to Norfolk Island, an Australian territory in the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand. Description Norfolk Island Tasman starling (Aplonis fusca fusca), from the collection Drawings of birds chiefly from Australia, (1791-1792) The Norfolk starling was 20 cm long. The wing length was 9.8 cm to 10.3 cm, the length of the tail was 6.3 to 6.8 cm, the length of the culmen 1.3 cm and tarsus was 2.5 cm. It was generally greyish brown. The males were glossy metallic green from head to the throat. The back, the rump, the uppertail coverts, the wing coverts, and underparts were grey, but undertail coverts were whitish. The bill was black and the eyes orange red. The females were coloured similarly but the greenish gloss were slightly duller and a grey throat contrasted with pale brownish flanks. The under breast was washed ochraceous. The abdomen and the undertail coverts were yellowish white. Extinction The reasons for its extinction are unclear. Competition from introduced European starlings, song thrushes and common blackbirds, overhunting and habitat loss through agricultural clearing might have played important roles. Reports in older literature that it was driven to extinction by rats like its relative from Lord Howe Island are incorrect because rats did not become a pest on Norfolk Island until 1940, while the Norfolk starling became extinct in 1923.

The test aims to find the specific gene types (a genotype) of the patient that will determine how he or she metabolizes certain medicines, therefore guides the doctors to prescribe medicine for best effectiveness and least side effects. The AmpliChip CYP450 Test uses micro array technology from Affymetrix (GeneChip) to determine the genotype of the patient in terms of two cytochrome P450 enzymes: 2D6 and 2C19. 2D6 and 2C19 variability CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 belong to the Cytochrome P450 oxidase family. CYP2D6 has over 90 variants, 2C19 has mainly three. They are responsible for the majority of the inter-individual variability in the ability to metabolize drugs. There are four phenotypes of CYP2D6: Poor Metabolizer (PM), Intermediate Metabolizer (IM), Extensive (normal) Metabolizer (EM) and Ultrarapid Metabolizer (UM). For CYP2C19, there are only two phenotypes: PM and EM. If a substrate of the enzyme is given to the patient as a medication, and if the patient has reduced CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 activity, the patient will have elevated drug concentration in their body, and therefore severe side effects may occur. On the other hand, for the UM patient, the drug concentration might be too low to have a therapeutic effect. So testing the phenotype of the patient is important to help determine the optimum dosage of the drug. How it works The test analyzes the DNA of a patient to determine the genotype, and prediction of the phenotype can then be made. The DNA sample comes from blood (as Roche suggests) or, alternatively, comes from a mouth brush called buccal swab. The analysis has five steps after DNA is extracted from patient samples: #PCR amplification of the gene. #Fragmentation and labeling of the PCR product #Hybridization and staining on the AmpliChip DNA microarray. #Scanning the chip. #Data analysis. FDA approval FDA approved the test on December 24, 2004. The AmpliChip CYP450 test is the first FDA approved pharmacogenetic test. Applications Since a lot of the CYP2D6 substrates are psychiatric drugs (antidepressant and antipsychotics, for example), the AmpliChip CYP450 has been extensively used in psychiatry. Criticism The main criticism of the test is that the test finds out the genotype (the makeup of the gene types) of the patient, which does not necessarily cover all the phenotypes (the actual biological effect). For example, some argue that the so-called ultra-rapid metaboliser, who has extra copies of the 2D6 gene expressed, cannot be reliably tested. Also, the test does not cover some rarer genotypes, nor genotypes that have not yet been discovered. Also, insurance companies still do not cover the price of the test, which can cost $600–$1300 to the patient, because the test is \\"experimental, investigational or unproven\\". UPDATED: 2/12/2013 - Most Insurance Companies (except Blue Cross Blue Shield) now cover pharmacogenetic testing because they feel that it reduces their risk of the patient experiencing adverse events, and thereby save significant dollars to the healthcare system (i.e.: increases their profit).

Secretly acting on behalf of BCCI, Pharaon acquired control of two American banks in violation of federal banking laws. When the fraud was discovered, BCCI was forced to sell the banks, and soon after shut down by regulators when it was determined to be insolvent. Pharaon was charged with wire fraud and racketeering conspiracy; although he eventually paid out substantial fines and a major settlement to the bank's liquidators, the criminal charges were never resolved and American authorities were seeking his extradition until he died in 2017. Early life and education Ghaith Pharaon is the son of the former Saudi Ambassador to all Europe from 1948 until 1954. His father was also advisor to King Faisal. He attended schools in Lebanon, Syria and Switzerland. His university education was in the United States at the Colorado School of Mines from 1959 to 1961 followed by Stanford University from 1962 to 1963; and Harvard Business School from 1963 to 1965 (until his graduation). He was appointed as a member of the board of associates of Harvard Business School and as a member of the International Development Council of the Colorado School of Mines. After graduating from Harvard, Pharaon formed the Saudi Research And Development Corporation, Ltd. (REDEC), the largest private enterprise in the Middle East. Pharaon was a key player in the global oil and banking industries in the 1970s and 1980s and at one time, the No. 2 Saudi investor in the United States. In 1977, he acquired the National Bank of Georgia from owner Bert Lance as part of complex scheme to take over a large Washington D.C. bank, First American Bankshares, on behalf of BCCI.The BCCI Affair, Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations States Senate (A Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations United States Senate by Senator John Kerry and Senator Hank Brown; December 1992; 102d Congress 2d Session Senate Print 102–140) This eventually led to criminal charges against him in the United States. He died on January 6, 2017 at the age of 76. Last days Pharaon served as Chair of Attock Petroleum. He also served as the Chairman of National Refinery and Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd. He served as the Chairman of Attock Refinery Ltd. until February 18, 2011. He served as a Director of Pakistan Oilfields, the Attock Refinery Ltd., Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd and the National Refinery Ltd. =Military contracts= Although Pharaon had been a wanted fugitive by the F.B.I since 1991 for massive fraud in the financial collapse of BCCI Bank; Pharaon was awarded a total of $120 million in contracts by the United States military in 2008. The contracts were to supply thousands of tons of jet fuel to American bases stationed in Afghanistan and were awarded to Attock Refinery, a Pakistan-based refinery owned by him and directed by Kamal Adham, the former head of Saudi Intelligence. =Personal life= Pharaon used to spend up to six months a year in Pakistan, where he operated his businesses and commercial interests. The extremely wealthy Pharaon was known to have been quite fond of cigars. He lived in his super yacht, which he named Le Pharaon after himself and this repeatedly was seen moored alongside luxury yachts of the rich and famous. In June 2005, it was seen moored next to the personal yacht of Saudi King Abdullah in a Greek port. Two years earlier, it was seen parked next to another Saudi royal family super yacht near Beirut. In 2016 it was reported that he bought a house in Budapest, right next to the personal residence of the Hungarian Prime minister Viktor Orbán.

It was a number-one song on Billboard's Rhythm and Blues chart for eight weeks. Recording Turner, a big Kansas City blues shouter, had been spending all of his time out on the road, while Atlantic's Ahmet Ertegun was getting nervous that his backlog of Turner recordings was running low. When Turner was near New Orleans, Ertegun insisted he make some recording. Atlantic's New Orleans recording studio was fully booked, so Turner recorded some sides in the studio of local radio station WDSU. He did not have his own band but was able to round up the trombonist Pluma Davis and his band, the Rockers, as well as the boogie rhythm pianist, James Tolliver. Other musicians on the recording were Dimes Dupont on alto saxophone and Warren Hebrew on tenor saxophone. Lyrics Like the session, the song is largely adlibbed traditional blues verses with various incongruous lines thrown in, to a standard 12-bar blues. It opens with the bold statement, \\"Aw let 'em roll like a big wheel in a Georgia cotton field, Honey hush!\\" The title in this song Turner revealed his typical attitude toward a woman who will not do what he tells her to do, while the tailgate trombone gives the woman's raucous answers back. Although his songs talk about relationships as misery, his emotion in the song is upbeat. To quote Arnold Shaw in his book Honkers and Shouters The spirit of the song is the good-natured optimism that characterized his work. His lyrics are sexually suggestive and aimed at an adult audience and his vocal style is that of an urban blues shouterintimate and relaxed. The final lyric is a reference to the \\"Hi-Yo Silver!\\" trope popularised by the Lone Ranger television series, that aired on the ABC Television network from 1949 to 1957. Legacy The advent of rock and roll narrowed the content of songs to adolescent preoccupations and made simple the complicated rhythms of rhythm and blues. The explicitly sexual content was too adult, as was the singer's strong voice tone as well as his raw assumptions about life. A year later, in 1954, a Turner song very similar to this one, \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll,\\" with its boogie-woogie rhythm and squawking saxophone was cleaned up by Bill Haley to become a hit as rock and roll changed the face of music. Turner turned to recording songs by rock and roll writers, but his blues shouter voice betrayed him and his career faded. However, not long after the rock and roll craze hit, a new audience of intellectuals, college students, and eventually beatniks, and then another with European blues fans joining in, gave singers in partial retirement or obscurity new opportunities although they had to clean up some to fit the new role of authenticity, fueled by the writings of Samuel Charters, demanded by these new audiences. For urban blues singers, having grown up in cities, it was convenient to be labelled as country singers to fit the criteria of purity. In 1959, Turner re-recorded \\"a much tamer, lamer, teenage rock'n'roll version\\" of \\"Honey Hush\\" for Atlantic which was a mild hit and his last one. Turner returned to performing with jazz combos as the rock and roll founders settled in to please the suddenly important teenage market. Covers *Early covers were the 1956 version by Johnny Burnette's The Rock and Roll Trio. *In 1965, Chuck Berry recorded his version for Chess Records. *In 2008 the song was covered by Jools Holland on his album The Informer. The song has since been covered by—among many others—Jerry Lee Lewis, Screaming Lord Sutch, Foghat, Paul McCartney, Coco Montoya, Fleetwood Mac (on the album Kiln House, listed as \\"Hi Ho Silver\\"), George Jones, Elvis Costello, NRBQ, and John Lindberg Trio.

The football team is part of a larger sports club that has departments for badminton, handball, hockey, athletics, tennis, table tennis (playing as SG Victoria Eppendorf), gymnastics, baseball (the Wildcats), and softball (the Oysters). __TOC__ History Older logo The club was founded 5 May 1895 as FC Victoria Hamburg out of the youth clubs Cito and Excelsior and was briefly affiliated with SV Hamburg before finally becoming a fully independent football club in the fall of 1897. It was one of the founding members of the DFB (Deutscher Fußball Bund or German Football Association) at Leipzig in 1901. Victoria joined the HAFV (Hamburg-Altonaer Fußball Verband or Hamburg-Altona Football Federation) a year later, capturing the league title in 1905. The team won two consecutive north German championships in 1907 and 1908 and advanced as far as the quarterfinals in national championship play in both seasons. The club was renamed SC Victoria Hamburg on 10 June 1908. Gyula Kertész coached the side from 1924-28. In 1933 German football was reorganized under the Third Reich into 16 first division Gauligen. Victoria earned promotion to the Gauliga Nordmark in 1934 and in 1943 won a divisional championship in what had become the Gauliga Hamburg before going out in the first round of the national championship. The team remained in the top flight until the end of World War II. After the war, occupying Allied authorities banned all organizations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. Victoria was soon re-established and played the 1945 and 1946 seasons in the Stadtliga Hamburg. They were one of four Hamburg sides that joined the newly formed Oberliga Nord (I) for the 1947–48 season where they earned a last place result and were relegated to second-tier play. They made brief re-appearances in the top flight Oberliga in 1951–52 and 1953–54 while spending most of the 50s and 60s in the Amateurliga Hamburg (II). Victoria Stadium during DFB-Pokal match against Nürnberg After the formation in 1963 of the Bundesliga, Germany's new professional league, Victoria spent three seasons in the Regionalliga Nord (II) before being relegated to the Amateurliga Hamburg (III) and then slipping to the Landesliga Hamburg-Germania (IV) for a single season in 1968–69. They quickly returned to third division play and would compete at that level for the next eight seasons. In 1977, the club was sent down to the Landesliga Hamburg (IV) and settled into what would become the Verbandsliga Hamburg (IV) for the next 17 seasons. In 1987 several club members left to form Hamburger Club Deportivo Espanol. League re-organization led to the Verbandsliga becoming a fifth division circuit in 1994. Victoria won promotion to the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein (IV) for a single season but immediately slipped back. They have since played in the fifth division Verbandsliga Hamburg, now commonly known as the Hamburgliga, with the exception of a two-year stint in the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein / Oberliga Nord (IV) in 2003–05. In 2007, the club won the Hamburg city cup final by defeating VfL 93 Hamburg 1–0.

History Basketball came to Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1929. The Basketball Federation was founded on April 3, 1950 as a part of the Yugoslav Federation. As a part of former Yugoslavia, many Bosnian players and coaches were part of medal winning teams in the FIBA World Championship, Eurobasket and Olympic Basketball Tournament. KK Bosna won Yugoslav championship titles in men's, and ŽKK Željezničar Sarajevo and KK Jedinstvo Tuzla in women's categories. Bosna and Jedinstvo Tuzla also won a European Champions' Cup (now known as Euroleague) in 1979 and 1989, respectively. Independent Bosnia and Herzegovina Since Bosnia and Herzegovina gained independence, the Basketball Federation has transformed into the sport's national governing body. It was accepted by FIBA on September 15, 1992. There are close to 150 basketball clubs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with more than 5,000 registered players. The Basketball Federation is the organizer of the national championship and cup competitions. As a result of war, three separated championships and cups were played until the late 1990s. They were organized according to ethnic divisions. In 1998. joint playoffs were first organized, and today one league is being played in the country.

It begins in Drexel, an area within the city of Trotwood, at US 35 and runs northwesterly to Greenville, and then runs roughly along near the western edge of the state near the Indiana state line to the Michigan state line where it meets with Michigan's M-49. Route description Along SR 49 at its intersection with SR 705 in northwestern Darke County The intersection of Washington Street, Martin Street, and Broadway (SR 49, SR 121, and SR 571) in Greenville SR 49's southern terminus is west of Dayton, at the intersection of U.S. Route 35 and West Third Street in Drexel. Both Drexel (a census- designated place) and the intersection straddle the border between Trotwood and Montgomery County's Jefferson Township. The roadway carrying SR 49 continues southward (signed \\"east\\") from this intersection as US 35 (designated \\"C. J. McLin Jr. Parkway\\"), a limited-access expressway into downtown Dayton. (Westbound US 35 proceeds along West Third Street) SR 49 continues north from US 35 through Trotwood along a roadway locally called the \\"Northwest Connector\\" or the \\"Trotwood Connector\\", then turns onto Salem Avenue, which crosses into Clayton. The route then briefly travels through Englewood, straddles the Englewood-Clayton line, again crosses into Clayton, then the ramps to and from Interstate 70 cross into Englewood and back into Clayton. SR 49 is then concurrent with I-70 for approximately through Clayton. SR 49 then exits from I-70 at ramps passing from Clayton into Clay Township, Montgomery County. The route then continues north to Greenville, Fort Recovery, Willshire, Convoy, Payne, Antwerp, Hicksville, Edgerton and Edon. SR 49 then interchanges with the Ohio Turnpike at that highway's first interchange east of the Indiana-Ohio state line. SR 49 terminates at the Ohio- Michigan state line where it continues north as Michigan State Highway 49. A portion of SR 49 in Montgomery County has been designated the \\"Joseph G. LaPointe Jr. Memorial Highway\\", in honor of the United States Army medic who posthumously received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Vietnam War. History SR 49 was first designated along its current route between US 30 in Van Wert County and the Michigan state line in 1927 having replaced a discontinuous section of SR 51. In 1932, the route was slightly extended south to Convoy south of US 30 before absorbing SR 51 south to Greenville the next year. All of SR 51 was then renumbered to SR 49 in 1935 extending the route from downtown Dayton to Michigan. No major changes would occur to the routing until around 1960 when a part of SR 49 was rerouted on a new expressway segment of US 40 south and west of Clayton (now partly I-70) and the route through southern Darke County was straightened to bypass Arcanum. The old routing through Arcanum became SR 49 Alternate. The most recent change to SR 49 occurred in the 1990s. Before 1999, SR 49 began in downtown Dayton at SR 4 and SR 48. It traveled west along First Street and Monument Avenue, crossing under I-75, and over the Great Miami River. The eastbound and westbound directions merged at the intersection of Salem and Riverview avenues before it traveled northwest out of the city on Salem Avenue. A new four-lane highway through Trotwood was partially completed in 1994 between Free Pike and Salem Avenue with the new road being designated SR 49 Future. By 1999, the new highway between US 35 and Salem Avenue was complete and SR 49 was rerouted out of Dayton to run on this new road. The old route to Dayton was designated SR 49-J indicating that it was being prepared for abandonment. The old segment of SR 49 along Salem Avenue was finally deleted from the state highway system in the summer of 2004. Major intersections SR 49 Alternate Map of SR 49 Alt. Arcanum municipal building State Route 49 Alternate (SR 49 Alt., officially designated SR 49A) is a alternate route to SR 49 in southern Darke County. The route travels in an L-shape, and serves the community of Arcanum. SR 49 Alt. has its southern terminus at SR 49 approximately east of the village. It travels west into Arcanum, then turns north and proceeds to its northern terminus where it meets SR 49 again north of the village limits. SR 49 Alt. was established in 1962. Prior to this year, mainline SR 49 followed the entirety of SR 49 Alt. through Arcanum. In 1962, SR 49 was re-routed onto the more linear alignment that it utilizes today to the northeast of Arcanum between the endpoints of SR 49 Alt. Consequently, the SR 49 Alt. designation was applied to this former mainline alignment of SR 49.

She is a two-time Olympic champion in 500 metres (2010 and 2014) and the 2010 World Sprint champion. She is the current world record holder in women's 500 metres with the time of 36.36 seconds set in Salt Lake City on 16 November 2013, and also holds the South Korean record on 1000 metres. She has also won three World Championships medals in 500 metres, and has placed in the top three in World Cup events four times in this distance. Her first World Cup victory, however, came on the non-Olympic distance 100 metres. On the 1000 metres, however, she has never placed higher than fifth in international events (2010 World Sprint Championships, first 1000 metres). Early life and education Lee Sang-hwa was born in 1989 to Lee U-geun (father), a technician at Hwigyeong Girls' School, and Kim In-sun (mother). Lee has an older brother, Lee Sang-jun, who used to be a skater, too. Influenced by her brother, she started skating when she was in first grade at Eunseok Elementary School. Although her brother excelled at skating, and won a skating competition held in his elementary school, Lee appeared to have more talent for skating than him. Since their parents could not afford to support the extra activity of both children, only she continued skating.http://news.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/02/18/2010021800086.htmlhttp://www.bulkyo21.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=9600 Lee is remembered by her school teachers as a smart and active student. Lee and Mo Tae-bum, gold medalist at Vancouver 2010, are close friends since their elementary school period. Along with him, Lee is currently attending Korea National Sport University.http://www.koreatimes.com/article/578068 Career Lee first competed internationally aged 14 in Canada, where she skated several test races in October 2003, winning comfortably and skating with a best time of 39.02 seconds. At the time, the U19 world record was 38.53. Her first ISU championship was in Roseville, Minnesota, during the 2004 World Junior Championships. As the youngest participant, she finished 16th, though she took third place on the 500 metres, 0.45 seconds behind world junior record holder Shannon Rempel. The following season, she raced 38.77 in test races in Calgary, and was selected for the World Cup races in Nagano, Harbin and Calgary. She placed eighth in her first race, recording 38.71 in the M-Wave, Nagano, 0.29 seconds behind winner Wang Manli. She finished in the top ten a further five times that season, including two fourth-place finishes in 100 metre sprints, which gave her fifth place overall in the 100 metre World Cup. In other achievements, she won two senior Korean titles (on 2 × 500 metres and sprint), and came 14th in the 500 metres World Cup standings, 16th in the 1000 metres, and 15th in the samalog standings in the World Sprint Championships, though she was within half a second of the winner on both 500 metre races, finishing 9th and 12th. In the World Championships, Lee won three medals that season; two in the junior championships, where she won bronze in the overall standings, though she was four points after the winner after 16th place on the 1500 and 19th on the 3000 metre event, and silver with the Korean team in the team pursuit event. And during the World Single Distance Championships in Inzell in March, two fourth-places were enough to take her to third place overall in the 500 metre competition, behind Chinese skaters Wang Manli and Wang Beixing. In 2006, Lee improved on the 100 and 500 metres, though she fell into the B division on the 1000 metres. She finished on the World Cup podium four times during the season, including a win in the 100 metre World Cup final, though she finished behind Jenny Wolf in the overall standings. On the 500 metres, she was sixth in the World Cup. She also added three senior Korean titles to her record, winning the 500 metres, 1000 metres, and overall sprint championship. During the season, she registered a world junior record on the 500 metres, with a time of 37.90 in Utah Olympic Oval. She failed to improve on her 1000-metre time from last season, however. The Turin Olympics ended with fifth place for Lee, despite her third-best second run which wasn't enough to lift her up more than one place. Earlier, she had finished 19th on the 1000 metres and 12th in the World Sprint Championships. The 2007 season has seen further improvement for Lee. She is yet to finish outside the top two, and after three of 12 races she heads the overall standings on the 500 metres. She has also improved on the 1000 metres, and became 11th in the overall standings, with eighth place in Heerenveen. At the 2010 Winter Olympics, Lee won her first Olympic gold medal in the women's 500 m becoming the first Asian woman ever to do so. She raced against Germany's Jenny Wolf, the world-record holder at the time, in both of her races. Although Wolf had the best time in the second of the two races, Lee edged her out by five hundredths of a second with a combined race time of 76.09 seconds to Wolf's 76.14 seconds. On 9 November 2013, she broke the world record on 500 metres in the 2013–14 World Cup event in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, with a time of 36.74 seconds. On 15 November, in the 2013–14 World Cup event in Salt Lake City, United States, she improved the record a further 17/100, to 36.57 seconds. The next day, she improved it another 21/100, to 36.36 seconds. On 11 February 2014, she won her second Olympic gold medal in the women's 500 m at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics with an Olympic record of 74.70 seconds and successfully defended her crown from the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver. Lee's second run set the Olympic record of 37.28 seconds, giving her an aggregate time of 74.70 seconds. Russia's Olga Fatkulina finished second with an aggregate time of 75.06 seconds, and Margot Boer of the Netherlands came in third with an aggregate time of 75.48 seconds. She became the first woman since Catriona Le May Doan at the 2002 Olympics to defend the gold at the event and just the third woman ever to win back-to-back Olympic gold in the 500 metres, and the first Asian woman ever to do so. Lee competed in her fourth Winter Olympics at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, and won the silver, her third Olympic medal, in front of her home crowd. She was defeated by Japan's Nao Kodaira who was the other favourite coming into the event. Overcome with emotions upon finishing her lap, Lee burst into tears during the celebratory lap, and was consoled and embraced by her rival and friend, Kodaira. The scene of Lee and Kodaira embracing and congratulating each other, touched on many viewers and commentators worldwide, making it one of the most memorable moments of the 2018 Olympics. On a press conference in 16 May 2019, Lee officially announced she would retire from speed skating. Personal life On 16 March 2019, Lee's agency confirmed that she and singer Kangnam were dating. They got to know each other after appearing on the SBS variety show Law of the Jungle (\\"in Last Indian Ocean\\" part). On 29 August, Kangnam's and Lee Sang Hwa's labels collectively released an official statement, confirming the couple's marriage. The wedding ceremony was held on 12 October at a hotel in Seoul.http://www.newsen.com/news_view.php?uid=201903191815487910 Records =Personal records= =World records= References External links * * Lee Sang-Hwa at SpeedskatingResults.com * Sang-hwa Lee at SchaatsStatistieken.nl  * Category:1989 births Category:South Korean female speed skaters Category:Speed skaters at the 2006 Winter Olympics Category:Speed skaters at the 2010 Winter Olympics Category:Speed skaters at the 2014 Winter Olympics Category:Speed skaters at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic speed skaters of South Korea Category:Medalists at the 2010 Winter Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2014 Winter Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in speed skating Category:Olympic gold medalists for South Korea Category:Olympic silver medalists for South Korea Category:Asian Games medalists in speed skating Category:Speed skaters at the 2007 Asian Winter Games Category:Speed skaters at the 2011 Asian Winter Games Category:Speed skaters at the 2017 Asian Winter Games Category:Medalists at the 2007 Winter Universiade Category:Asian Games silver medalists for South Korea Category:Asian Games bronze medalists for South Korea Category:Medalists at the 2007 Asian Winter Games Category:Medalists at the 2011 Asian Winter Games Category:Medalists at the 2017 Asian Winter Games Category:Universiade medalists in speed skating Category:Living people Category:Speed skaters from Seoul Category:World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships medalists Category:World Sprint Speed Skating Championships medalists Category:Universiade gold medalists for South Korea Category:Universiade bronze medalists for South Korea Category:Speed skaters at the 2007 Winter Universiade Category:Competitors at the 2009 Winter Universiade Category:South Korean Buddhists ","title":"Lee Sang-hwa"},{"id":"7992940","text":"\\"L'amour s'en va\\" (\\"Love goes away\\") was the Monegasque entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1963, composed and performed in French by French singer and actress Françoise Hardy.

The company is ranked 524th on the Fortune 500, and is 39th on the list of largest banks in the United States. The company's banking subsidiary, The Huntington National Bank, operates 920 banking offices, primarily in the Midwest: 459 in Ohio, 290 in Michigan, 51 in Pennsylvania, 45 in Indiana, 35 in Illinois, 29 in West Virginia, and 10 in Kentucky. In January 2009, the bank's Board of Directors named Steve Steinour as president, CEO, and chairman, succeeding Thomas Hoaglan, who retired after eight years in those positions. The company is the second-largest originator of Small Business Administration loans. History P. W. Huntington formed P. W. Huntington & Company in 1866, operating on the northwest corner of High and Broad Streets. Huntington built its first 5-story building in 1878, on the intersection's southwest corner. Four out of five sons of P. W. would become partners during the 1890s and early 1900s. The bank was incorporated in 1905 as The Huntington National Bank of Columbus. Huntington died in 1918 shortly after turning the bank over to his sons. Francis Huntington became president and provided active leadership for 14 years. In 1915, the bank received limited trust powers. In 1922, the bank received full trust powers from the Federal Reserve System. In 1923, Huntington purchased Columbus-based the State Savings Bank & Trust Company and the Hayden-Clinton National Bank of Columbus, swelling its capital base. In 1958, Huntington acquired the Columbus-based The Market Exchange Bank Company. In 1962, Huntington acquired both First National Bank of Grove City and The People's Bank of Canal Winchester. In 1963, Huntington acquired both The Columbus Savings Bank and the Columbus-based The Northern Savings Bank. In 1966, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (HBI) was established as a bank holding company. In 1967, Huntington Bancshares acquired the Washington Court House-based The Washington Savings Bank. In 1969, it acquired the Ashland- based Farmers Bank. In 1970, it also acquired the Bowling Green-based The Bank of Wood County Company, the Toledo-based The Lucas County State Bank, and Lagonda National Bank of Springfield. In 1971, Huntington Bancshares acquired First National Bank & Trust Company of Lima, The Woodville State Bank, and the Kent-based The Portage National Bank.

In 1980, Farmers & Merchants Bank, Milford Center and The First National Bank of Burton were merged with Huntington Bancshares. In 1981, the bank acquired Alexandria Bank Company and renamed it The Huntington State Bank, with a loan production office opening in Cincinnati, Ohio. In 1982, the bank merged with the Reeves Banking and Trust Company. Huntington acquired the tiny Savings Bank of Chillicothe, Ohio in the early 1980s, which gained some fame in 2011 when 100-year-old June Gregg revealed to Huntington officials that her father had opened a savings account for her as a baby with Savings Bank in 1913 and that she had subsequently kept the account open. Huntington officials later confirmed it and gave her account a temporary increase in her interest rate to 5% as a centenarian present for her 98-year loyalty to Huntington and the Chillicothe branch's predecessor, Savings Bank. In 1983, the bank acquired Cleveland-based Union Commerce Bank. In 1997, the bank acquired First Michigan Bank Corporation of Holland, Michigan. In 2002, the company sold its branches in Florida to SunTrust Banks for $705 million. In March 2006, the company acquired Unizan Financial. In July 2007, the company acquired Sky Financial Group Inc. based in Bowling Green, Ohio, which increased its presence in Indiana and Ohio and expanded it into Western Pennsylvania for the first time. In November 2008, the United States Department of the Treasury invested $1.4 billion in the company as part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program and in December 2010, the company repaid the Treasury. The U.S. government made a profit of over $144 million from its investment in the company. In 2009, Huntington bid against rival Fifth Third Bank to acquire National City Corp. branches in the Pittsburgh region from PNC Financial Services. The United States Department of Justice ordered PNC to sell the branches to comply with United States antitrust law concerns after the National City acquisition by PNC. Ultimately, PNC sold the overlapping branches to First Niagara Bank. On October 3, 2009, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation named Huntington as receiver of a $400 million deposit portfolio from the bank failure of Warren Bank in Warren, Michigan. On December 18, 2009, Huntington signed a 45-day lease with the FDIC to run a bridge bank for the failed Citizens State Bank in New Baltimore, Michigan. In March 2012, the bank acquired Dearborn-based Fidelity Bank. In 2012, Huntington was in merger discussions with Flint, Michigan-based Citizens Republic Bancorp. Discussions stalled and FirstMerit, which was itself acquired by Huntington in 2016, purchased Citizens Republic in September 2012. In the first quarter of 2013, Huntington changed its ATMs to new ones that allow customers to make deposits by inserting cash and checks directly into the ATM. The bank started in 2014 offering ATM deposits from mobile phones and through online transfers until 11:59 p.m. and post them that day. In March 2014, the company acquired Ohio-based Camco Financial, holding company for Advantage Bank, for $97 million in stock. In September 2014, the company acquired 24 offices of Bank of America in Central Michigan, including the Port Huron, Flint, and Saginaw markets. This raised the number of Huntington branches in Michigan to 173, including over 40 locations housed in Meijer stores. In March 2015, the company acquired Michigan-based Macquarie Equipment Finance, Inc. from Sydney, Australia-based Macquarie Group for $458 million. In January 2016, Huntington announced it would purchase Akron-based FirstMerit Corporation for $3.4 billion, making it one of the largest banks in Ohio. Due to Sherman Antitrust Act concerns by the United States Department of Justice, it sold 11 branches in Canton and two in Ashtabula to First Commonwealth Bank. Additionally, 107 branches located within 2.5 miles of other Huntington / FirstMerit branches were closed. =Historic checks= In 2012, Huntington started displaying old checks that were written by famous people, including 24 former U.S. Presidents such as Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin Roosevelt, and Niles, Ohio native William McKinley. Other checks were signed by Charles Dickens, Thomas Edison, Ernest Hemingway, and Susan B. Anthony, among others. The most notable check was one written by Lincoln to \\"self\\" for $800 dated April 13, 1865, the day before his assassination. The checks are estimated to be worth over $75,000 today. Huntington acquired the checks in 1983 when it purchased Union Commerce Bank and received several boxes of old documents, but weren't discovered until 2011 when a Huntington employee was looking through the documents. =Huntington Preferred Capital= Huntington Bancshares also operates Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc., a real estate investment trust (REIT). It was organized under Ohio law in 1992 and designated as a REIT in 1998. Four related parties own HPCI's common stock: Huntington Capital Financing LLC; Huntington Preferred Capital II, Inc.; Huntington Preferred Capital Holdings, Inc.; and Huntington Bancshares Incorporated. All these entities are tied via ownership and/or interlocking directorships to Huntington Bancshares, either directly or through Huntington National Bank. In addition to the common stock, Huntington Preferred Capital also issued 2 million shares of preferred stock, paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.4925 per share. This stock is largely held by the same companies as the common stock, but a small fraction of the available shares are sold on the open market. Huntington Preferred Capital had one subsidiary, HPCLI, Inc., a taxable REIT subsidiary formed in March 2001 for the purpose of holding certain assets (primarily leasehold improvements). On December 31, 2007, Huntington Preferred Capital paid common stock dividends consisting of cash and the stock of HPCLI to its common stock shareholders. After the stock dividend was paid, HPCLI became a wholly owned subsidiary of Huntington Preferred Capital Holdings, which holds all the shares of HPCLI.

Its name is derived from Mundelingham or village of Mundel. Parts of Great Mongeham's church, St Martin's, date back to the 13th century. In the 19th century it was restored by William Butterfield. Locally produced ice cream and sausages found favour with Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who, as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, often stayed in her nearby official residence, Walmer Castle. Significant figures who have lived in the village include Captain Robert Maynard,Burial monument Stephen Haggett, Proctor of Queens' College, Cambridge in the seventeenth century and Olivia Barclay, astrologer. Great Mongeham may have been a settlement as long ago as the Bronze Age. When the site for the new primary school was being dug in February 1949 the body of a man and two fragments of food vessels were found. The man was in the crouched burial position used in the Bronze Age and one of the fragments was dated to about 1000 BC. Great Mongeham is close to the Roman road which ran from Dover to Richborough Castle. Archaeologists have discovered Roman pottery and evidence of cremation but we do not know if there was a permanent settlement here at that time. There certainly was a settlement here in 761 AD. In that year King Eadbert of Kent gave some land to St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury. This included the village, which was then called Mundelingeham. The names means \\"settlement of Mundel's people\\". By 1195 it was written as Munigeham. A possible variation may be Monyngham, seen in 1399.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; National Archives; CP 40/555; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/H4/CP40no555/aCP40no555fronts/IMG_0279.htm; 5th entry: 'Monyngham' is mentioned on the first line, with 'Northbourn' and ' Litle Monyngham' on the second line It had become Mongeham by 1610. Being close to the sea and to the rest of Europe has affected Mongeham's history. In 1415 Henry V granted the Fogge family of Mongeham the exclusive rights to brew and ship beer to the English soldiers in Calais. Behind the local Engineering Works is a steep bank dropping down to a brook. This is all that remains of the ancient Mongeham Docks, long since silted up. Chalk and lime used in the building of Deal Castle in 1538 were quarried from a pit called Pope's Hall. At the time of the Armada in 1588 Mongeham had a signal beacon which would have been lit to raise the alarm if the Spanish landed. Later, the smugglers hid their spoils near the village. Mongeham is also known for its lesser-known history, the first wooden bike recorded to have been manufactured was created in this very town, the town is also home to a very well known truffle forager who has been foraging under the trees for many years. St Martin's Church, Great Mongeham A number of buildings in Mongeham have shaped gable ends. This was a Dutch fashion which is found in several places along the east coast of Kent. The church porch, which was demolished in 1851, had fine gable ends. The village church has a complicated history. The original building probably dates from Saxon times but there are claims that it goes back to AD 470. In the sixteenth century the interior was brightly coloured but by 1665 the church was in a state of disrepair. One-third of the parishioners belonged to religious sects and did not attend service. The church was restored in 1851 by William Butterfield. Inside the church is a helmet Known as \\"Paul-Tucker\\" which is claimed to have been worn at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. There is also a poem by Robert Bridges, a former Poet Laureate, written as a tribute to his nurse, Catherine Ashby. She came from Mongeham and spent much of her life in service with the Bridges family who lived at St. Nicholas-at-Wade in Thanet, where Robert himself is buried. Also in the church is the finely sculpted monument to Edward Crayford, whose father-in-law was three times Lord Mayor of London. The Crayfords were once a prominent local family but Stone Hall, their house by the church, was demolished long ago. William Crayford led a contingent of Kent men in the Wars of the Roses on the Yorkist side. He fought in the Earl of Warwick's division at the Battle of Northampton in 1460 and was knighted by Edward IV for his services.

Biography Born in Weimar, Karl was the only son of Karl Alexander, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Princess Sophie of the Netherlands. He would serve in the army of the Grand Duchy of Saxony (Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach) and he was present when Wilhelm I was crowned as German emperor.Dr. med.

Schnaebeli: Photographs of the proclamation of the Emperor in Versailles, Berlin 1871. Because his mother was a daughter of King William II of the Netherlands and his older uncles, except King William III, died childless, Karl August was second in line in the succession to the throne of the Netherlands from 1890 to 1894. He was preceded only by his mother. This was the reason for him learning to write and speak fluent Dutch, due to the possibility of Karl August becoming king if his cousin Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands died without issue. In leisure, Karl dedicated himself to his copperplate collection and coin cabinet. He was also interested in the Grand Ducal Library and the newly built archive, where he often studied historical documents on the history of the house.Bernhard Post; Dietrich Werner: Ruler in the turn of the century: Wilhelm Ernst of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, 1876-1923. Glaux, Jena 2006, p. 37. His popularity and his uncomplicated outreach to the residents of the Grand Duchy made him a beloved leader of the duchy. Karl August died at Cap Martin, France, six years before his father; because of this, his eldest son Wilhelm Ernst succeeded his grandfather as Grand Duke. Karl August is buried in the Weimar royal crypt. Family and children In Friedrichshafen on 26 August 1873 Karl August married Princess Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. They were second cousins, as she was the paternal granddaughter of Prince Bernhard, who had been in the service of the king of the Netherlands and was a younger brother of the Grand Duke Karl Frederick of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the grandfather of Karl August. Her maternal grandparents were William I of Württemberg and his third wife Pauline Therese. Karl August and Pauline had two sons: #Wilhelm Ernst Karl Alexander Friedrich Heinrich Bernhard Albert Georg Hermann, Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (b. Weimar, 10 June 1876 – d.

The Ensemble Theatre is an Australian theatre company, situated in Kirribilli, New South Wales. It is Australia's longest continuously running professional theatre group, having given its first performance in Cammeray Children's Library on 11 May 1958. It relocated to the current premises in the old boatshed on the shore of Careening Cove in 1960. The theatre was founded by Hayes Gordon AO OBE along with the Ensemble Studios acting school, which introduced Stanislavsky- influenced method acting to Australia. Ensemble Studios was Australia's longest surviving acting school when it closed in 2009. Gordon passed on the position of Artistic Director of Ensemble Theatre to Sandra Bates in 1986, but remained Principal of the acting school until his death in 1999. Bates was joined by Mark Kilmurry first as her deputy and then as co-director, with Kilmurry replacing Bates upon her retirement in 2015. The most successful play in the theatre's history is Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks, a two-hander which in 2006 paired Todd McKenney, in his first non-musical play, with Nancye Hayes. The pair reprised these roles ten years later, reuniting with Sandra Bates in her final directorial role. The play was taken on tour, in collaboration with Christine Dunstan Productions, and won the 2007 Helpmann Award for Best Regional Touring Production. The complex also incorporates Bayly's Restaurant, named in honour of the actress Lorraine Bayly, in recognition of her long-running commitment to the Ensemble Theatre (she was a founding member), to mark her retirement from the stage in June 2003. In 2016, the Ensemble produced the Sydney premiere of Jane Cafarella's e-baby, a two- hander \\"quietly feminist play that asserts a heartfelt approach towards matters of infertility, adoption and motherhood.\\" Caferella's first full- length play which was world premiered in 2015 at the Chapel Off Chapel theatre in Melbourne. The Ensemble production was directed by Nadia Tass, multi-award winner for her films Malcolm and Amy, and starred Danielle Carter and Gabrielle Scawthorn; Carter and Scawthorn were described as bringing \\"such life to their roles\\" and being \\"utterly believable - in equal parts loveable and frustrating - [so that] the heartbreak, when it comes, is visceral.\\" Tass, described e-baby as \\"a play for today - the advances in medicine create a new world that allows new possibilities - in e-baby we enter that world and explore the raw truth, the unbridled joy and the paradox of surrogacy through a carefully woven story of love, generosity and a newborn child.\\"  References  External links *Ensemble Theatre Homepage Category:1958 establishments in Australia Category:Performing groups established in 1958 Category:Theatres in Sydney Category:Theatre companies in Australia Category:Theatre in Sydney ","title":"Ensemble Theatre"},{"id":"7992991","text":"Grasse is a commune in France.
