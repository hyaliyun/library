History When it was determined to restore the Benedictine Order in Brazil, the work was entrusted to the Congregation of Beuron, 24 April 1895, under the guidance of Dom Gerard van Caloen. By a Decree of the Sacred Congregation of the Consistory, 15 August 1907, the Abbey of Santa Maria de Monserrato at Rio de Janeiro, founded in 1589, was erected into an abbey nullius. The same Decree separated the District of Rio Branco from the Diocese of Amazones and subjected it to the jurisdiction of the Abbot of Santa Maria de Monserrato. This mission territory was bounded on the north and west by Venezuela, on the north and east by British Guiana, on the south by the two branches of the Rio Branco and the Rio Negro. In the early part of 1898 it was visited by Fathers Libermann and Berthon of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost, who did a little apostolic work among the Catholics scattered along the banks of the Rio Branco. The region contained 6000 Catholic Brazilians, and 50,000 pagan Indians. Mgr. Gerard van Caloen born, 12 March 1853; entered the Benedictine monastery of Beuron, was appointed Abbot of São Bento at Olinda, 20 May 1896, and general vicar of the Brazilian congregation in 1899, he was transferred, 28 February 1905, to the monastery of São Bento, at Rio de Janeiro; made titular Bishop of Phocea, 13 December 1907; and elected archabbot of the Brazilian congregation, 6 September 1908. He resided at Rio de Janeiro. On 8 June 1907 he obtained a coadjutor, Abbot Dom Chrysostom de Saegher, Abbot of St. Martin of Thebaen, who had the right of succession to the abbatial See of Monserrato. Archabbot Gerard retired at 1915 (+1932).

It was formed in 2005 to take over the former Traction Group fleets in Yorkshire by Stagecoach Group, which took over Traction from Frank Carter on 14 December 2005; Yorkshire Traction, Yorkshire Terrier and Barnsley & District. Since then the geographical coverage of the division has changed, with the divestment of services in the Huddersfield area, and the addition of Derbyshire operations from Stagecoach East Midlands. The former Yorkshire Traction and Barnsley & District operations are now branded as Stagecoach Yorkshire, whilst services in Yorkshire Terrier's former area are operated as Stagecoach Sheffield, and the Derbyshire operation continues as Stagecoach in Chesterfield. However, following rationalisation, services throughout the division are now registered to Yorkshire Traction. History Traction Group was formed in 1986, when Barnsley-based Yorkshire Traction was sold to its management and employees, led by Frank Carter. In 2000 Sheffield-based Yorkshire Terrier was taken over along with the operations of Andrews, South Riding, Sheffield Omnibus, and Kingsman, all in Sheffield, which all competed with Mainline in the city. Barnsley & District was formed in July 1990 when Traction bought Tom Jowitt Travel of Tankersley. It was enlarged in 1992 when Pride of The Road, Royston was purchased, and in 1995, when the bus operations of Globe of Barnsley were taken over. Mainline was sold to FirstGroup, became First Mainline and then First South Yorkshire. It still competes with Stagecoach Yorkshire and Stagecoach Sheffield today, which brings Britain's largest two bus groups into competition with each other. Following the takeover by Stagecoach, Barnsley & District was closed and absorbed into Yorkshire Traction in July 2006, and three months later the Stagecoach in Chesterfield operation was transferred into Stagecoach Yorkshire from Stagecoach East Midlands. From Sunday 20 May 2007 the company is operating a brand new bus service across Barnsley and South Yorkshire. There have been a number of changes, presented as a bid to improve the service but really major service reductions. Many cross-border services into West Yorkshire have been withdrawn, especially between Barnsley and the Huddersfield areas, a former Yorkshire Traction stronghold. In May 2008, following rumours that Arriva would purchase Stagecoach's Huddersfield operations, it was announced that Centrebus Holdings would buy the division. That company was a partnership between the Centrebus owner and Arriva, which held a 40% stake. It is now Yorkshire Tiger, wholly owned by Arriva. Stagecoach Yorkshire division's first Stagecoach Gold service commenced on Monday 10 November 2014, operated by Stagecoach in Chesterfield and running between Sheffield, Chesterfield and Matlock, more recently extended from Sheffield to Meadowhall and Barnsley. Depots *Barnsley (Wakefield Road) *Rawmarsh (Dale Road) Fleet National Express. This is Caetano Levante 59205, seen in Southampton coach station, on route 310 to Bradford. Stagecoach Yorkshire's vehicles are varied. Traction Group was known for a lot of variety among its bus fleet; Yorkshire Traction's fleet included the unique KIRN Mogul with East Lancashire Flyte body, a large fleet of Scania buses dating back to the 1990s, which were relatively rare then, and Traction has been the only major buyer of MAN 14.220s, all with East Lancs Myllennium bodies. Many more rare vehicles operate in the fleet, as well as more familiar vehicles, such as Dennis Darts, with Plaxton and Alexander bodies, low-floor Dart SLFs and Volvo B6BLEs with East Lancashire Spryte bodies, plus some ex-Blazefield Volvo B10Bs and B10BLEs with Wright bodies and Alexander ALX200-bodied Volvo B6LEs. The company's last MCW Metrobuses were withdrawn in the first quarter of 2007.Goodbye to the double-deckers Sheffield Today by the Sheffield Star (Retrieved 23 January 2007) Terrier's fleet was more standardised, with East Lancashire Spryte-bodied Dennis Darts and Volvo B6BLEs, East Lancashire Myllennium-bodied DAF SB220s, a single low-floor Volvo B6 with Plaxton Pointer bodywork, and 10 Alexander Dennis Pointer Darts. More recently, 25 MAN 18.240s with Alexander ALX300 bodywork joined the fleet, replacing all the remaining Alexander Dash-bodied Volvo B6s, and allowing the single low-floor Plaxton Pointer example to be cascaded (first to Doncaster, then to Barnsley where it currently resides). Since the Stagecoach takeover, 20 new Alexander Dennis Pointer Darts have entered service at Rawmarsh and Ecclesfield, of which 17 were branded for routes 88 and 108/9, along with seven MCV Evolutions at Rawmarsh and 30 Alexander ALX300-bodied MAN 18.240s split between Sheffield and Barnsley depots. In 2009, Barnsley received a number of Enviro400 vehicles, branded for service 66 (Barnsley – Elsecar). In 2010 Sheffield received fifteen brand new Enviro 400s branded for service 88 to replace the previous buses on this route, which moved on to new route 87 (Lowedges – High Green). More ALX 300 were transferred from Oxford and were placed into service on new service 79 (Batemoor – Ecclesfield). Also three Optare solos were transferred in from Preston Bus to operate new service SL2, linking the Stannington estate with the tram at Malin Bridge. Rawmarsh and Barnsley received seven Enviro 200s each. In 2011, Holbrook depot received 21 Alexander Dennis Enviro 400 Hybrids for service 120 (Halfway/Crystal Peaks – Royal Hallamshire Hospital/Fulwood), which were later followed with another 19 for service 52 in 2012. Ecclesfield Depot received six Enviro 200s for the enhanced Supertram Link service between Stocksbridge and Middlewood. More Enviro 200s followed in 2012; Barnsley received another six vehicles for the Townlines 1 service, displacing the existing Optare Solos to Holbrook for a new Supertram link service, whilst Holbrook received eight to upgrade service 25. In October 2017, three Volvo B9R Plaxton Elites were added for the new X10 route between Barnsley and Leeds. These were transferred from National Express and sport leather seating and USB charging.

Roberts tried about ten different variations, such as eating sushi, eating foods with low glycemic index, and drinking vinegar, before arriving at the Shangri La Diet. Roberts argued that weight is controlled by maintaining body fat at a certain amount, referred to as a \\"set point.\\" When weight is above the set point, appetite decreases, and it takes less food to feel full. When weight is below the set point, appetite increases, and it takes more food to feel full. He further stated that eating strongly flavored foods (like soda or donuts) can raise the set point, whereas flavorless foods (like sugar water, canola oil, extra light olive oil) can lower the set point.A Spoonful of Sugar Book Review These flavorless foods must be consumed in a \\"flavorless window,\\" at least one hour after and one hour before consuming flavors. Consumption of 100-400 flavorless calories per day lowers the set point, and therefore, lowers weight.

They mark the furthest western extent of the Alaska Range. The range is rarely visited because of the flying time necessary to get there and also because of the notoriously poor weather conditions that are prevalent in the range. The highest peak in the range is Mount Hesperus (9,828 feet/2,996 m). Description The Revelation Mountains are located approximately west-northwest of Anchorage, and approximately 130 miles (210 km) southwest of Denali. They are accessed by small plane; the closest airports to the range are near Anchorage and in Talkeetna, which is also approximately 130 miles (210 km) away. This makes access to the range very expensive; the weather also creates the potential for delays in reaching the range (both to drop off climbers and to pick them up). The principal peaks of the Revelation Mountains are granite spires, rising out of relatively low- elevation glacial valleys. The high vertical relief in the Revelations makes the range a very dramatic place and also creates challenging climbing conditions, despite the low absolute elevation of the peaks. The Revelations are drained on the northwest by the Big River, one branch of which flows from the Revelation Glacier, which is the main glacier of the core of the range. On the southwest they are drained by the Swift River, while the valleys of the southeast side feed the Stony River. The east and northeast slopes lead to the Hartman and South Fork Kuskokwim Rivers. History The first recorded visit to the range occurred in July, 1967 by David Roberts and his party from the Harvard Mountaineering Club. The group achieved a few first ascents, and subsequently named the range and many of its notable peaks. In his American Alpine Journal article, Roberts writes of extremely bad weather, including very high winds that frequented the range, and also of challenging climbing conditions. The Roberts party spent 52 straight days in the range. Roberts named the range the \\"Revelation Mountains,\\" and gave many of the peaks Biblical names because he had been reading aloud from the Bible as part of his English literature studies at the University of Denver and thought the apocalyptic descriptions in the Book of Revelation matched the landscape of the mountain range.Clint Helander, The Question: The Direct East Face of Golgotha, Posted on: March 16, 2015 http://www.alpinist.com/doc/ALP49/64-direct-east-face-golgathaDavid Roberts, On the Ridge Between Life and Death: A Climbing Life Reexamined (2006) Selected peaks in the Revelation Mountains * Mount Hesperus (9,828 feet/2,996 m).

While in the House, he served initially on the Science, Space & Technology Committee and the Public Works & Transportation Committee, before winning a seat on the Appropriations Committee in 1991. He also served six years (1993–99) on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. During his tenure in office, Skaggs became a voice for civility in politics. He and Representative Ray LaHood were founding co-chairs of the House Bi-Partisan Retreat, first held in 1997 and designed to encourage civility and comity in the House; the retreats continued through 2003. He was also co-founder of the Constitutional Forum (with Representative Jim Leach), a series of seminars with distinguished guest lecturers who led member discussions of constitutional issues. During the 104th Congress, Skaggs was Chairman of the Democratic Study Group, the principal policy and reform organization of House Democrats. Skaggs had a strong environmental record while in Congress. During his tenure in office, he sponsored 42 bills, three of which were successfully enacted, including the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993, legislation that designated certain lands in the State of Colorado as components of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Skaggs also co-sponsored the Energy Act of 1992 that, among other things, amended utility laws to increase clean energy use and improve overall energy efficiency in the United States and mandated installation of low flush toilets in all new homes. Additionally, Skaggs was a co-sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, outlawing discrimination based on disability. Notwithstanding his efforts to uphold civility and restore bipartisan comity to the House, Skaggs was often criticized for being partisan and voting along party lines. Though he was well known for his liberal voting record, he was a strong opponent both of the presidential line-item veto, once suing to block it, and President Clinton's use of military force without congressional approval. In 1992, Skaggs found himself at the center of controversy, coming under fire for his overdrafts from the so-called House bank.  After Congress  After retiring in 1999, Skaggs served as an adjunct professor at the University of Colorado and as executive director of the Center for Democracy & Citizenship at the Council for Excellence in Government for several years before moving back to Colorado to serve as executive director of the state Department of Higher Education from 2007 until resigning in 2009. His resignation raised eyebrows at the time, as no specific resignation reason was given; Skaggs merely cited a dispute with Gov. Bill Ritter. Immediately following his resignation, Skaggs was appointed the first chair of the board of the new Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) in 2008. After control of the House changed to the Republicans in 2010, former Florida Representative and CIA Director Porter Goss became OCE board chair, with Skaggs as co-chair. Additionally, Skaggs was a member of the U. S. Public Interest Declassification Board from 2005 to 2016. Skaggs also served as co-chair of the Constitution Project's bipartisan War Powers Committee. He serves on the boards of trustees of the National Endowment for Democracy, as Vice-Chair, [url=http://www.ned.org] and the American University of Iraq – Sulaimani [url=http://auis.edu.krd/]. He received the 2017 Distinguished Service Award from the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress. The National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration's David E. Skaggs Research Center in Boulder, Colorado, for which he secured funding, is named in his honor. He now is affiliated with the Denver office of the law firm Dentons US LLP where he serves as a senior strategic advisor and independent consultant. Skaggs and his wife have 3 grandchildren, Liam, Maddie, and Will, who enjoy regular visits to the Skaggs farm outside Niwot, Colorado.

Harris (January 21, 1902 – December 29, 1977) was a philatelist and stamp dealer who through his company, H.E. Harris & Co., popularized philately for many Americans, especially children. Selling stamps Harris began selling stamps to various local drug, novelty and variety stores at the age of 14.\\"The Kenmore Stamp Story.\\" When the Washington Post offered free advertising, Harris seized the opportunity to begin a mail- order stamp business. He opened his first retail store in 1921 at Kenmore Square in Boston.Logan, Richard: “We NEED Another Captain Tim”, American Philatelist Magazine, February 2010, Pages 150-151 Over the years, H. E. Harris's ads, which offered a quantity of stamps for a small amount of money (usually less than $1) on the condition that additional stamps were sent on approval, became ubiquitous in many magazines and comic books. While the company was noted for selling low-cost packets of stamps, it sold rarities as well. The company developed a fully illustrated postage stamp catalog that sold for a fraction of the cost of the more detailed Scott Stamp Catalogue. Stamp Club Procter & Gamble (P&G;) sponsored the radio show, \\"Ivory Stamp Club of the Air\\" during the Great Depression. The show was hosted by \\"Captain Tim\\" Healy, an authentic explorer and world traveler. H. E. Harris was contracted by P&G; to send each new club member a stamp album, badge and packet of stamps in exchange for an Ivory soap wrapper. To receive more stamp packets, members could send two soap wrappers and 10¢. When the last show was broadcast in 1936, the club had 2.5 million members. Many of them became Harris customers and helped build the company into one of the largest stamp businesses in the world. Further expansion Harris's business slowed due to a moratorium on stamp importation into the United States during World War II, so he went to England to serve in its Eighth Air Force. After the war, he revamped his business by acquiring the Kenmore Stamp Company in Kenmore, New York, in 1947 and reestablishing it in Arlington, Massachusetts. Litigation Harris gained media attention in 1962 when he went to court to prevent the Canal Zone and the United States Post Office Department from issuing large quantities of intentional error stamps to destroy the value of a few stamps that had reached circulation honoring the opening of the Thatcher Ferry Bridge (now the Bridge of the Americas) but lacking the silver ink used to depict the bridge. Harris had acquired some of the error stamps, and claimed that the issuance, which would reduce the value of the error stamps to a few cents each, violated his rights. He was successful in his lawsuit. Honors and awards For the success of his lawsuit against the United States Post Office Department, Harris received the Luff Award in 1966 for exceptional contributions to philately. He was also elected posthumously to the American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame in 1979.American Philatelic Society APS Hall of Fame Later years In 1975, H.E. Harris sold his business to the venture capital arm of General Mills, which discontinued the stamps-on-approval mail- order service.\\"What Happened to H.E.

The school's mascot is the Pioneers. History On July 19, 1935, an application was filed with the Public Works Administration for Kenton County, Kentucky for funds to construct a public high school. The application was approved, and on November 2, 1935, a deed was signed for a site on Madison Pike, one-half mile south of the center of the city of Independence. A addition was added shortly thereafter to allow for the construction of a lake on-site to provide water for the school. The overall project's cost is recorded as $175,606.85. The decision to name the school after famous Kentucky pioneer Simon Kenton, was made official on October 22, 1935, with the official dedication occurring September 5 of the same year. With an initial enrollment of 496 students, Simon Kenton High School opened its doors on September 13, 1937. The initial building that housed the school remained static until 1954, when a new bi-level building was completed to accommodate the growing student population. In 1964, a new cafeteria was added to the existing structure. In 1970, the original lake was drained after the drowning death of senior Robert Blanton. 1970 also saw the addition of a wing to the north side of the school as well as the expansion of the paved parking lot. The school later underwent a total renovation of the facade as well as the addition of a new wing, cafeteria, and library. On October 9, 1980, the school's four buildings suffered an estimated 1.5 million dollars in damage as a series of explosions from a natural gas line swept the campus. The continued explosions injured approximately 35 of the Fire and Rescue workers that responded to the scene. One student, a junior by the name of Robert Williams, also lost his life. Later in that same school year, the school would make headlines for a much more joyful reason; the Pioneers boys' basketball team won the 1981 Kentucky state championship, becoming the first school ever from Northern Kentucky to win the title. (Note that Kentucky, unlike almost all other states, has never adopted a multiple-class system for high school basketball.) The current principal is Mr. John Popham. Ms. Georgina Campbell, and Mr. Craig Reinhart serve as Assistant Principals. Mr. Trent Steiner and Mrs. Michelle Hickey are the Associate Principals. As of July 1, 2007, Mrs. Setters took over as principal, replacing Mr. Richard Culross. In late August, 2014 Martha Setters accepted a promotion to Director of Leadership and Learning for the Kenton County School District.http://www.kenton.kyschools.us/school_NewsArticle.aspx?artID=55352&schoolID;=3#sthash.7dbEhyW2.dpbs John Popham is the interim principal for the remainder of the 2014–15 school year and has remained the principal since then.

It deals with the nuclear fallout following a hypothetical disaster in the Sellafield Nuclear Reprocessing Plant in Cumbria on the British coast of the Irish Sea. The docu- drama suggests that, due to a changing wind direction, Ireland would bear the brunt of the British accident. The docu-drama was based on the false premise, (?) The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII) has said that the scenario as depicted in tonight’s RTÉ drama, Fallout, could not happen. The RPII, who viewed the drama...has analysed the scenario as depicted and has concluded that it is not possible for such an accident to occur in Sellafield. that such an accident as depicted in the drama could happen and that parts of Ireland would need to be evacuated following a serious accident at Sellafield. Dr Ann McGarry, chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, said: \\"The scenario envisaged in the programme is not realistic and grossly exaggerates the amount of radioactivity that could reach Ireland. The RPII cannot envisage any realistic scenario that would cause the radiation levels in Ireland to reach the concentrations as what was depicted in the drama\\". Following the dramatized accident, the docu-drama depicts Irish evacuation riots, societal collapse and widespread health impacts.

In addition, the Irish government are currently attempting through a court action to close the Sellafield nuclear plant; the topic of the programme may be regarded as being sub judice. 550px When attempting to stem leaks found in the Sellafield facility, an explosion occurs. This sets off a further chain of explosions in the HASTs (Highly Active Storage Tank), resulting in the release of a highly radioactive plume. A north-easterly wind carries this radioactive material over the Irish Sea, which hits Ireland's eastern coast, particularly County Louth and the Dublin area (Ireland's main population centre) causing widespread chaos. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland also voiced criticisms at the time of airing, Dr Ann McGarry, chief executive of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, said: The RPII was also concerned that the programme appeared to suggest that evacuation would be the appropriate response to an accident at Sellafield. With Dr. McGarry explaining that International best practice indicates that evacuation would not be required as Ireland is at sufficient distance from the British nuclear facilities, that radiation levels arising from an accident would never be sufficiently high to give rise to the effects displayed in the programme.

This painting tells the story of a journey of African Americans who, through years of sacrifice, have established a heritage built on their trials and tribulations. This story displays how they pride themselves on their accomplishments and achievements. Indirectly, it reveals how these people have struggled to make it in a society that is different from their norm. From the time they lived in Africa until their journey to America beginning the fight to reach their artistic and intellectual peaks, Jones depicts this story by using certain elements of design, line, color, and space. The works she created throughout her life tell the story of many different cultures. In this painting she chooses to represent her own culture. As Tritobia Benjamin, a student of Jones states, “Jones and others employed the portrait as a means of conveying profound respect for their race” (25). As described in the online article “Focus on the Slave Trade”, African Americans have not always had the same rights as other ethnicities throughout the United States, because in the beginning around the 17th century the ancestors of African Americans were traded in an agreement called the Atlantic slave trade ( “Focus on the Slave Trade”). Unlike other countries slavery in America was based solely on race. They were sold and forced to journey to the United States with their Caucasian counterparts. There they were abused slaves and remained in this position until approximately 1865, when the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution abolished slavery all over the U.S, even though the northern cities did away with slavery several years before, (“Focus”). As time went on African Americans were still mistreated, but some made their way into society by escaping to the north during the duration of slavery, while others educated themselves behind closed doors. By the 20th century some were very educated, seeing as though they finally had the right to do so. In her historical painting Jones allows viewers to observe the life of descendants of Ethiopia. Jones draws observers into the struggles of her people in this painting and by the way she uses design elements to tell the story. When an observer first views this painting the eye is immediately drawn to the figure in the bottom right corner wearing a blue and black headdress facing left with a profile view. This figure (which covers about one fourth of the canvas) is watching others carry pots on their heads. These silhouette-type figures are also gesturing toward a glowing star in the top left corner, or they are holding hands while looking towards a city in the top right corner. All are moving to an elevated position in the painting, the city in the top right corner is composed of two big buildings where there are two entertainers in front; one is playing the piano while the other seems to be preparing to sing because there are music notes around him. Then, behind these two big buildings there's a big round yellow circular object protruding from the side, surrounded by two blue/turquoise concentric circles. It has a face, and someone on a bended knee appearing to be acting on top of it. The turquoise colored circle bigger than the previous one has a face coming out towards the inside. Further up there's someone painting on top of the blue circle with the words art above enclosed within the blue circle. A symbolic palette and brush are painted within that same blue circle, the star in the top left corner has rays of squiggly blue, green, and black streaks that radiate diagonally. The star is inside of a yellow circle shining down on the people gesturing towards it, this picture reflects what Jones was trying to convey to her audience. Jones chooses to briefly convey certain moments of the story by the use of certain iconographic references, and narrative devices. She uses several strategies in this piece to tell this story. For example, to depict Ethiopia Jones uses the large figure wearing the ethnic headdress to signify the importance of Ethiopia to the painting. The words art and the people leading to the city represent the African-American community and their progress over time including their life struggles that influence their art. Not only does the large figure represent Ethiopia, but the pyramids do also. The star in the top left corner of the painting represents the infamous north star that the slaves used as a guide to lead them to the north. The position of the people in the image towards the bottom on the right suggests a plea for mercy, by the way position of their arms are bent and they are hunched over, accompanied by their body language that expresses redemption by their confident and straight up posture. Other design elements including line, space, and color all come together to tell this story. The lines in this painting are fluid, straight, and squiggly based on the outline of the figure, the sky to the right, and the mountain in the middle. The space in this painting is deep because due to the perspective of the painting. If the viewer is standing right in front of the figures with the head dress. The position of the objects allows her to take a deep perspective into what's going on. By the position of the objects and how they are placed in front of, and behind each other. Also the surrounding space frames the narrative, especially at the bottom by the large figure to the right, and to the left the stairs. The colors in this painting are of a cool dark color scheme using only black, and blue mostly, but also yellow to represent salvation, light, and triumph. The blacks and blues in this painting are used to represent their struggle, for example in the saying “blue in the face” or “beaten till your black and blue”. The visual elements are arranged asymmetrically, are rhythmic, open, and unbalanced to appeal to the viewer (Terry). The artists used the position and technique of the forms to tell the story. The figures in the bottom left corner include one with the clay pot. He is hunched over and seems sad. The others appear to be holding their heads up high. It seems as if they know that the times are going to change, and that things will get better because of a higher being. Also the colors used really emphasize the feel of the painting. The darkness of this picture emphasizes how over time African Americans used their education to bring their light to the rest of society. The creator of this painting Lois Mailou Jones was born in the city of Boston, ironically a city of the visual arts and the birthplace for American impressionism (Woods 644). Here she attended Boston's High School of Practical Arts, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (Laduke 28). After graduating Jones began a career as a freelance textile and fabric designer, however this was when she discovered that this career didn't give her the recognition she wanted (Benjamin 25). Textile design did not give her the recognition she was accustomed to from her previous works (Nicholson 598). Therefore, Jones sought out something that would gain her recognition as an artist (Benjamin 25). As a result, she found the Harmon Foundation of New York, a foundation established to assist in the development of a greater economic security for African Americans, that held national competitions for black artists (Benjamin 25). After exhibiting several of her works and receiving several awards Jones emerged as a black artist and strayed away from classroom teachings. Through this foundation she became interested in black America's 20th century movement known as the Harlem Renaissance. As a result, she created a painting that would launch her career as a full-time acclaimed artists. The painting that started Jones’ career was entitled The Ascent of Ethiopia and is an expression of “cultural identity” an identity that was simultaneously a part of American consciousness, considering that only a decade earlier the nation had been fascinated by Egypt after the discovery of King Tutankhamen's tomb (Benjamin 26). The Ascent of Ethiopia inspired by The Awakening of Ethiopia a sculpted piece created by Meta Warrick Fuller, as stated by Jones in an interview given by Charles Rowell (358). It was a painting created during the Harlem Renaissance, also known as The New Negro Movement a time when Harlem was the peak of black artistic culture (Benjamin 26). This era is represented in Jones’ painting by her image of the city and the words music, art, and drama. Also, by the way the image has figures that appear to be acting and singing. The Ascent of Ethiopia was one of Jones’ first works, but was typical because many of her other works were culturally diverse paintings (Benjamin 25-102). Her style of painting reflects many cultures and lifestyles, but some of her best works have come from painting aspects of her own heritage. The slave trade changed many lives and has affected millions throughout America. It is the foundation of African American history, and lead to the artistic movement of black culture known as the Harlem Renaissance. This history will continue to affect many generations, and Jones depicts the history accurately in her painting making the story appealing to everyone. With the way she uses design, line, color, space, narrative devices, and iconographic references to tell the story. This painting draws attention to an area of my life that is usually not highlighted in art. Her training in Boston allowed her to paint her heritage accurately, and the certain aspects of history she chose were the most important. Also, the recognition she gained from the Harlem Renaissance, thanks to The Harmon Foundation, is an honor she will never forget. “The Ascent of Ethiopia” her first acclaimed oil painting has been one of her best works, and Jones fits into her own painting by her contributions to art as an African American woman painter during the era of the Harlem Renaissance. The Ascent of Ethiopia was truly Lois Mailou Jones’ way of introducing the African American Heritage to the rest of the country.  Sources  * Benjamin Hayes Tritobia.

The New Westminster Royals was the name of several professional ice hockey teams based in New Westminster, British Columbia, first established in 1911 for the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA). Though nominally based in New Westminster, the team played its home games at the Denman Arena in nearby Vancouver, as an arena was not available; the team would never play a PCHA home game in New Westminster as a result. They won the inaugural PCHA championship in 1912, though financial difficulties saw the team relocated to Portland, Oregon in 1914 and become the Portland Rosebuds. History The first team played from 1912–1914 in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) which was established in 1911. The team was notable as it was the inaugural champion of the PCHA when the league first started out in 1912. It would be the only league championship the Royals would earn. Their home arena was the Denman Arena in Vancouver. The name was revived for a club that played in the Pacific Coast Hockey League from 1945 to 1952 and the Western Hockey League from 1952 to 1959. The Royals won the President's Cup in 1949–1950 as PCHL champions. The New Westminster Royals name was revived for a junior-level franchise in Pacific Coast Junior Hockey League in 1962, and later merged into the British Columbia Junior Hockey League. The BCJHL franchise played on-and-off from 1962 to 1991 in the years when the New Westminster Bruins were not playing.

Biography Harrelson was born in Double Shoals, North Carolina, though his postal address was listed as Lawndale, North Carolina. The son of Cleveland County farmer J. H. Harrelson, he was educated at Piedmont High School and then at N. C. State. Though he apparently enrolled initially as a textiles student, he changed his major to mechanical engineering by his sophomore year. He joined the college's Corps of Cadets in his sophomore year as a cadet corporal, and was promoted cadet first sergeant the following year. In July 1908, he enlisted in Company G of the 1st North Carolina Infantry, N. C. Army National Guard, serving a single term of enlistment. He was appointed captain of his cadet company in the fall of 1908, and was commended for his drilling abilities at a competition held on 16 October. Apart from his army training, Harrelson also served as historian of his sophomore class, as vice- president of his junior class, and as a commencement marshal in his senior year. He was also awarded honors in his sophomore and senior years. Harrelson graduated from the university in 1909 with a B.A. in engineering. After completing his bachelor's degree, Harrelson returned to N.C. State as an instructor of mathematics in the fall of 1909, teaching arithmetic, algebra, and plane and solid geometry, subsequently becoming a professor. During 1909 he also became a Freemason. In October 1915, he was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 1st Company of the North Carolina National Guard Coast Artillery Corps. In the same year, he completed an M.S. in mechanical engineering from N.C. State and was promoted to assistant professor of mathematics. In August 1916, Harrelson was promoted to captain in the National Guard and was assigned command of the 1st Company, Coast Artillery, then stationed in Raleigh. Following the U.S. entry into World War I in 1917, Harrelson took a leave of absence from N. C. State and was mobilized into the U.S. Army on July 25. He was given command of a training company at Fort Caswell, which included about 30 N.C. State alumni. In early 1918, he was posted on training courses in heavy artillery and anti-aircraft training at the Heavy Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Virginia. He resumed his command of the 7th Company at Fort Caswell on July 3, and until August 1918 also served as commander of the 1st Group Command, and as chief gunnery officer and commanding officer in charge of the post officers' school at Fort Caswell. Harrelson was noted for his performance as a company commander, with his training company having produced 26 commissioned officers by that time. He was promoted to major in the National Army on August 9, 1918, and was subsequently assigned to a post in Washington on the general staff in the office of Peyton C. March, the Chief of Staff of the United States Army. In this role, he took command of the personnel branch and wrote discharges for officers, including for himself. Harrelson was demobilized in August 1919 with the rank of major, and returned to the college. In December 1920, he was transferred to the N.C. Field Artillery Corps of Organized Reserves. In the same month, he was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Coast Artillery Reserve, and was promoted to colonel on January 29, 1923, which led to him being popularly known as \\"Colonel Harrelson\\" at the State College. Apart from teaching, Harrelson also served as a freshman football coach and as the graduate manager of athletics in 1921. Subsequently given command of the 534th Coast Artillery Regiment, on December 20, 1927, Harrelson was transferred to command the 316th Field Artillery Regiment, 156th Field Artillery Brigade, 81st Division, reporting to Brigadier General Albert Lyman Cox. In 1929 he was appointed by Governor O. Max Gardner to head the State Department of Conservation and Development. He left the office in 1933 to head the Department of Mathematics at N.C. State. Harrelson was a member of the local engineering fraternity Alpha Sigma Epsilon which became a chapter of Theta Tau in 1924. He was initiated as the second charter member of the new chapter. In 1934, following a reorganization at the Consolidated University of North Carolina, Harrelson was appointed as the first \\"Dean of Administration\\" at N.C. State; the school's sixth chief executive and the first alumnus to lead the school. He was also appointed the North Carolina civilian aide to the Secretary of War the same year. In this appointment, he participated in the Carolina Maneuvers in the autumn of 1941 as the coordinator for the North Carolina exercises, spending two weeks on active duty. With the outbreak of war, Harrelson was appointed chairman of the N.C. State Council of Civilian Defense. On February 25, 1943, Harrelson was recalled to permanent active duty, becoming the first head of a major Southern college to be so assigned. Effective March 8, he was assigned to the training section of the Fourth Service Command, helping to manage military training programs in U.S. colleges and universities. In his absence during World War II, regular university affairs were administered by the faculty council. His title was changed to \\"Chancellor\\" in 1945. Harrelson oversaw the establishment of the School of Design and the School of Forestry. Harrelson retired from office in 1953 and became the college archivist. He left a $100,000 endowment to NC State for art purchases and a lecture series. In 1954, he was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Engineering. On the evening of Saturday, 12 March 1955, Harrelson was scheduled to give the main address, \\"Recollections of D.H. Hill,\\" at the dedication of the new D.H. Hill Library building. Shortly after 8 p.m., he rose from his seat and stepped up to a microphone and podium in front of the circulation desk. Harrelson then began speaking, but before he could finish his first sentence, he suddenly collapsed to the floor, knocking over the microphone as he fell. He was rushed to Rex Hospital and placed under an oxygen tent, but was pronounced dead from a cerebral haemorrhage at 10:10 p.m. Harrelson died two months before his 70th birthday. In his will, he left bequests to purchase outstanding mathematics works for the library, for a distinguished lecture series and for purchasing artworks for campus buildings including the library and student union.Littleton, I.T. \\"The D.H. Hill Library: An Informal History 1887-1987\\". Friends of the Library. 1993. 34-35. Print Legacy In 2003, Harrelson was posthumously inducted into the Theta Tau Alumni Hall of Fame. In 1961, Harrelson Hall, a classroom building on the university's Main Campus housing mathematics and languages courses, was named after Harrelson. Notable for its unique cylindrical design, the building remained in use until 2015, shortly before its deconstruction in 2016. NCSU Libraries Special Collections Research Center currently houses John William Harrelson's manuscript papers and university archives.

The Nevada Legislature is a bicameral body, consisting of the lower house, the Assembly, with 42 members, and the upper house, the Senate, with 21. With a total of 63 seats, the Legislature is the third-smallest bicameral state legislature in the United States, after Alaska's (60 members) and Delaware's (62). The Nevada State Legislature is the first majority female State Legislature in the history of the United States. The Democratic Party currently controls both houses of the Nevada State Legislature. Establishment The Nevada Territorial Legislature was established upon creation of the Nevada Territory in 1861. It created the nine original counties during the its first session outside Carson City. Nevada became a state under the Nevada Constitution of 1864, vests the legislative authority of the state in a Senate and Assembly, which are designated \\"The Legislature of the State of Nevada\\". The legislature has the duty to establish the number of Senators and Assembly members and the legislative districts to which they are apportioned after each decennial census, though the total number of legislators may not exceed 75. The size of the Senate is tied to the size of the Assembly; the state constitution limits the Senate to no less than one- third and no greater than one-half of the size of the Assembly. Redistricting bills passed by the legislature after the 2010 US Census were vetoed by the governor, and the legislature was unable to override those vetoes. Ultimately, Nevada's legislative districts as of 2011 were established by order of a state district court. Since that time, Senate districts have been formed by combining two neighboring Assembly districts. Terms of members Members of the Assembly are elected to a two-year term with term limits of six terms (12 years). Members of the Senate are elected to a four-year term and similarly face term limits of three terms (12 years). Term limits were amended to the Nevada Constitution following a voter referendum in 1996 as reflected in Nevada Constitution, Art. 4, Sec 4. Sessions and qualifications The Legislature's first official working day is the first Monday of February following the election. Sessions of the Legislature are biennial, occurring during odd number years. The Nevada Legislature is one of only four states that have biennial sessions, the others being Montana, North Dakota, and Texas. The Legislature must adjourn sine die each regular session not later than midnight Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) 120 calendar days following its commencement. Any legislative action taken after midnight PDT on the 120th calendar day is void unless it occurs during a special session convened by the Governor of Nevada. The governor is obligated to submit the proposed executive budget to the Legislature not later than 14 calendar days before the commencement of each regular session. In order to be elected as a member in either chamber of the Legislature, a person must be a U.S. citizen, at least 21 years of age, a Nevada resident for one year, and a qualified voter in their residing district.

In 1869, the Legislature passed the State Capitol Act, signed into law by Governor Henry G. Blasdel, providing $100,000 for the construction of a capitol building. Under the supervision of designer Joseph Gosling, construction began on the Italianate building in 1870. The Legislature convened in the unfinished state capitol building the following year, with construction completed by the middle of the year. The Legislature continued to meet in the state capitol until 1971, when both chambers moved to the Legislative Building constructed just south of the original capitol. The old state capitol continues to be the office of the governor and other executive branch officials. The former Assembly and Senate chambers are now museums, and available for meetings.  History  Sadie Hurst (1857–1952) was the first woman elected to the Nevada Legislature (R-Washoe), in 1918. When the legislature met in special session on February 7, 1920 to ratify the Federal Suffrage Amendment, it was Hurst, the assemblywoman from Reno, who presented the resolution. She has the further distinction of being the first woman to preside over a state Legislature during the ratification of the Federal Suffrage Amendment. The 80th Nevada Legislature, , is the first women-majority bicameral state legislature in U.S. history. Two states have previously held a female majority in one legislative body.

The Andalusian city of Cádiz was the great European centre of the Spanish–American trade. The port's capture would not only help to sever Spain's links with her empire in the Americas, but it would also provide the Allies with a strategically important base from which the Anglo-Dutch fleets could control the western Mediterranean Sea. The military build-up was accompanied by diplomatic measures in Portugal aimed at securing King Peter II for the Grand Alliance. The Allies also intended to garner support in Spain for an insurrection in the name of the Austrian pretender to the Spanish throne, the Archduke Charles. The battle was the first of the war in the Iberian Peninsula, but due to Allied intra-service rivalry, ill discipline, poor co-operation, and a skilful defence from the Marquis of Villadarias, Admiral George Rooke was unable to complete his objective and, after a month, he set sail for home. Background On 15 May 1702 the Powers of the Grand Alliance, led by England and the Dutch Republic, declared war on France and Spain. Emperor Leopold I also declared war on the Bourbon powers, but his forces under Prince Eugene had already begun hostilities in northern Italy along the Po Valley in an attempt to secure for Austria the Spanish Duchy of Milan. Eugene's successful 1701 campaign had aroused enthusiasm in England for war against France, and helped Emperor Leopold's efforts in persuading King William III to send an Allied fleet to the Mediterranean Sea. Count Wratislaw, the Emperor's envoy in England, urged that the sight of an Allied fleet in the Mediterranean would effect a revolution in the Spanish province of Naples; win south Italy from the precarious grip of Philip V; overawe the Francophile Pope Clement XI; and encourage the Duke of Savoy – and other Italian princes – to change sides.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, p. 262 More modestly, Prince Eugene pleaded for a squadron to protect the passage of his supplies from Trieste across the Adriatic. The English had their own interests in the Mediterranean: the Levant Company needed escorts, and an Allied naval presence could challenge the dominance of King Louis’ Toulon fleet, an attack on which could deliver a mortal blow to French naval power.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 31 It was clear, however, that before the Allies could commit to the Mediterranean strategy, it would first be necessary to secure a base in the Iberian Peninsula. The decision to favour Cádiz – the capture of which would open the Straits, and place in Allied hands the gate to the trade with the New World – was taken before the death of King William III in March 1702, but the policy was continued under his successor Queen Anne, and her ministers led by the Earl of Marlborough. England's representatives at the Portuguese court in Lisbon, John Methuen and his son Paul, were also clamouring for a strong naval demonstration on the Spanish coast to encourage the wavering King Peter II to annul his recent treaties with France and Spain, and join the Grand Alliance.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 36. Securing Portugal would place the harbour of Lisbon at the disposal of the Anglo-Dutch fleet. In return for joining the Grand Alliance, Methuen promised, or hinted, that the King of Portugal might receive concessions of Spanish territory and compensation for the loss of the Asiento to the French. The Methuens were assisted by Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, a cousin of the Empress Eleonora. The Allies hoped that whilst the Methuens negotiated with the Portuguese, the Prince could inspire and even direct the pro-Austrian insurrection in Spain on behalf of the Emperor's youngest son and pretender to the Spanish throne, the Archduke Charles.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 40 Prelude The Anglo-Dutch fleet set sail at the end of July and passed down the Portuguese coast on 20 August. Admiral Rooke commanded 50 warships (30 English, 20 Dutch), and transports, totalling 160 sail in all; Ormonde, commander of the troops, had under him 14,000 men in total – 10,000 English (including 2,400 marines), and 4,000 Dutch. Yet Rooke had no faith in the expedition: his ships had insufficient victuals for a prolonged campaign, and he had concerns over the French port of Brest which lay between himself and England.Rooke was suffering from gout at this time; he was also upset by news of his wife’s death which reached him on the very day of sailing. Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt (1670–1705) accompanied the fleet in the interests of Austria. Prince George, in his ship the Adventure, had joined the fleet at Cape St. Vincent.The Portuguese government, still bound by its alliances with the Bourbons, were nervous of the fervent stirred up by Prince George. Under protest from the French and Spanish ambassadors, King Peter felt it expedient to ask politely for the Prince to quit Portugal. Both the Prince and Paul Methuen (who had also joined the expedition), reported to Rooke that Cádiz was poorly defended, but the admiral's own intelligence, received from captured fisherman, suggested that a powerful garrison of Spanish regulars had already strengthened the city. Allied doubts about the real strength opposing them were exacerbated by the Spanish stratagem of lighting extensive fires along the heights. Therefore, after the Allied fleet anchored off Cádiz on 23 August, three days were spent in futile discussions before any decision was reached.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 45 There were several options for the Allied attack. According to Rooke's journal of 25 August, Sir Stafford Fairborne: > … having proposed to the Admiral his forcing the harbour and destroying the > eight French galleys which lay under the walls of Cádiz, he [the Admiral] > called a council of flag officers to consider the same; but … it was > unanimously judged unreasonable and impracticable to hazard any the least > frigate on such an attempt.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. > 1, vol. ii, p. 610 Another option for the Allies was to land the army under the cover of a bombardment by the fleet on the isthmus dividing Cádiz from the mainland; from there, the troops could storm the city. This tactic was Ormonde's preference, but Major-General Sir Charles O’Hara insisted that a landing on the isthmus was inadvisable unless the navy could guarantee the landing of supplies on a daily basis, which, because of the lee shore, they could not.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 46 Ormonde's second choice was a blockade, supported by a bombardment of the town; but there was doubt that the ships could anchor close enough for an effective bombardment. In any case, Prince George objected to such a plan for fear of alienating the population. The decision, therefore, was to land the Allied troops between the Bay of Bulls and Fort Saint Catherine. This suited the navy because they could bring their ships near to the shore, and from the beachhead troops could seize the towns of Rota and Port Saint Mary. However, the landing place was a long way from the base of the isthmus on which Cádiz stood. (See map below). Don Francisco del Castillo, Marquis of Villadarias was given command in the threatened province of Andalusia.Stanhope calls Villadarias the ‘most active and able’ of all the Spanish generals of the war. Cádiz, Andalusia's main city, held a garrison of some 300 poorly equipped men with a similar number lining the shore, but the sudden appearance of the Allied fleet engendered a state of emergency, and, in Philip Stanhope's words, ‘the spirit and determination to repel it’.Stanhope: History of the War of the Succession in Spain, p. 50 The wealthy cities of Cordova and Seville contributed to the Spanish cause, the nobles took up arms, and the local peasantry were organised into battalions, so that after boosting the city's garrison Villadarias could still muster in the field five or six hundred good horsemen, and several thousand militia.Stanhope: History of the War of the Succession in Spain, p. 51 To increase the strength of his position further, the Spanish commander secured the harbour by drawing a strong boom and sinking two large hulks across its entrance. Battle =Landing and looting= Battle of Cádiz 1702. The landing took place on 26 August in a fresh wind, resulting in the loss of some 25 landing craft, and 20 men drowned. Fire from a Spanish 4-gun battery, and a charge from a squadron of cavalry offered resistance to the landing. The foremost ranks of the Allied forces consisted of grenadiers who repulsed the Spanish horsemen. Nevertheless, one of the Allied officers, Colonel James Stanhope, who later became British commander-in-chief in Spain, praised the courage of the English and Spanish troops engaged in the small action, admitting that 200 more such horsemen would have spoiled the Allied descent.Stanhope: History of the War of the Succession in Spain, p. 54 From the landing place Ormonde's forces marched on Rota. The town was found deserted (although after a while the governor and some of the inhabitants returned to greet them).Stanhope records that the governor of Rota admitted the Allies to the town and was the only notable defector to the Allied cause. The name of Rota’s governor is not recorded but Prince George conferred on him the title of Marquis hoping to entice other defections. The Allies stayed here for two days, disembarking horses and stores. Although military power remained in Anglo-Dutch hands, Prince George had been granted the head of the civil administration in any town occupied by the Allies. He distributed manifestos calling on Spaniards to declare for the House of Austria; the fact that some came forward to join the Allies at Rota was of value, for the Imperial representative was dependent on local volunteers to make contact with other inhabitants. However, the Spanish authorities had taken severe measures to prevent desertion to the allied cause, threatening with hanging anyone caught in possession of one of Prince George's manifestos.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 47 The Allies proceeded to take Fort Saint Catherine, before entering the town of Port Saint Mary. Ormonde's men initially encamped beyond the town, but the mistake was to allow them to return to it. The troops found the town full of unguarded warehouses stuffed full of goods, and the cellars full of wine and brandy, most of which was owned by English and Dutch merchants doing business under Spanish names. The men helped themselves, lost control, and fell to looting, destroying, and plundering, not just the warehouses, but also convents and churches.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 48 Prince George despaired and sent home a report damning the conduct of the officers, particularly Ormonde's subordinates, Sir Henry Belasys (Ormonde's second-in-command), O’Hara, and the Dutch Baron Sparr, whom he held responsible for persuading Ormonde to quarter the troops in the town. The navy were not at first involved in the looting, but they were soon tempted to take their share.Captain John Norris, the future admiral, was court-martialled for striking an officer in a dispute about some casks of claret they had appropriated. The cause of the Archduke Charles had suffered a serious setback due to the behaviour and misconduct of Ormonde's men, who, according to Trevelyan, plundered Saint Mary to 'the bare walls'.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, p. 265 A local English merchant wrote disparagingly, \\"our fleet has left such a filthy stench among the Spaniards that a whole age will hardly blot it out.\\"Roger: The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649–1815, p. 166 These excesses ended any hope that the local population would desert Philip V and join with the Allies, and were a boost to Bourbon propaganda. Rooke himself reported that, \\"the inhumane plundering of Port Saint Mary made a great noise here by sea and land, and will do so throughout Christendom.\\"Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 49 =Re-embarkation= The immediate effects of the looting were detrimental to the expedition; the army thought mainly of taking their spoils home and, according to David Francis, lost their combative spirit.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 50 For their part, the navy feared for the ships anchored off a lee shore, which in bad weather was dangerous. Nevertheless, the army's long march from the landing place to their objective required assistance from the men in Rooke's fleet. Crew members built bridges, cut fascines, dug trenches, fetched and carried, but, due to sickness, there was never enough labour available. Rooke was eventually obliged to limit these onerous demands on his sailors, declaring that \\"such slavish labour was not for seamen.\\" The admiral may have had no choice, but it was a blow to army–navy relations.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 51 After the occupation of Port Saint Mary the advance lost momentum. The marshy coast as far as Port Royal was occupied, and the English generals became more recalcitrant. However, Baron Sparr insisted on attacking Fort Matagorda situated on the Puntales (a sandy spit near the entrance to the inner harbour), thus enabling the entry of Rooke's fleet into the anchorage, before destroying the enemy ships within.Trevelyan: England Under Queen Anne: Blenheim, p. 266 With 600 Dutch and 1,600 English troops, the Allies made a causeway across the deep sand and brought a battery close to the stronghold, but they now found themselves within range of the Franco-Spanish ships anchored behind the boom – commanded by Conde de Fernan Núñez – and in a vulnerable position; they were also subject to attack from the galleys which still lurked outside the harbour. Villadarias, meanwhile, continued to harass detached Allied parties and cut off their communications; by a sudden attack he also recaptured Rota whose garrison commander, the former governor, was condemned to death and executed as a traitor.Stanhope: History of the War of the Succession in Spain, p. 59 The Allies made little or no progress. Matagorda held out, and after several days Rooke declared that even if the fort was taken, the other stronghold guarding the Puntales entrance would prevent the fleet from navigating the narrow passage. On the 26 September, therefore, facing certain failure, the decision was taken to re-embark the troops. A plan to bombard the city (against Prince George's wishes) was abandoned due to bad weather, and, after a further council of war, the fleet left on 30 September. The attempt to seize Cádiz had ended in abject failure. Aftermath The fact that no Spanish notables had joined the Allies during their time at Cádiz meant a loss of prestige for Prince George; but he did receive aboard his ship a deputation of Spanish grandees from Madrid which had missed him in Lisbon, and had been ferried over from Faro. The Prince informed Rooke and Ormonde that they were ready to declare for the House of Austria, but they were not prepared to commit themselves unless the Allies could guarantee them adequate support, and leave a force to winter in Spain. This assistance was not forthcoming.Francis: The First Peninsular War: 1702–1713, p. 52 There had, however, already been a number of Castilian defections, the most startling of which was that of the Admiral of Castile, Juan de Cabrera, Duke of Rioseco and Count of Melgar.Kamen: The War of Succession in Spain: 1700–15, p. 94 After leaving Madrid on 13 September 1702, he fled to Portugal where he issued a denunciation of the Bourbon government and entered the service of the Archduke Charles. Ormonde and Prince George wanted to land at another key place in Spain but Rooke, concerned about the autumnal gales, decided to head for England. By now Ormonde and Rooke were barely on speaking terms: the general thought he could have taken Cádiz were it not for Rooke vetoing his plan; for his part, the admiral had written bitterly to Ormonde regarding the behaviour of the soldiers on shore. However, it was fortunate for Rooke, Ormonde, and the Allied cause, that news of a Spanish silver fleet from America had arrived off the coast of Galicia. The subsequent Battle of Vigo Bay was considerably more successful than the attempt on Cádiz (although the financial rewards were far less than expected), and the victory had taken the edge off the failed expedition. Nevertheless, when the fleet returned to England the House of Lords insisted on an inquiry into the conduct of the Allies at Cádiz.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1, vol. ii, p. 611 The bad feeling between Rooke and Ormonde had led to hopes of a fruitful inquiry, but the success at Vigo had given the Tories the opportunity to build up Rooke as a hero; Ormonde was also given a triumphal reception and rallied to the Tory side. The inquiry, therefore, became a party struggle: the Tories glorifying Rooke and Ormonde, whilst the Whigs remained critical. The two Allied commanders made an obdurate joint defence before the House of Lord's Committee.Churchill: Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1, vol. ii, p. 612 However, a Court-Martial was held into the conduct of Belasys and O’Hara. O’Hara was cleared but Belasys was dismissed from the service. Both men were expected to lose their regiments, yet Belasys was later reinstated, and O’Hara was promoted to lieutenant-general in 1704.

Food cooperatives are usually consumer cooperatives, where the decisions regarding the production and distribution of its food are chosen by its members. Like all cooperatives, food cooperatives are often based on the 7 Rochdale Principles, and they typically offer natural foods. Since decisions about how to run a cooperative are not made by outside shareholders, cooperatives often exhibit a higher degree of social responsibility than their corporate analogues.The food cooperative.

History The cooperative movement started in the 19th century and the first notable food cooperative was started in Rochdale, England by industrial weavers known as the Rochdale Pioneers. The origination of the modern cooperative movement began in the 1960s when many \\"second wave\\" cooperatives started. The goals of these cooperatives were to provide an organic and anti-corporate alternative to chain grocery stores. Food cooperatives began to emerge in major cities and college towns, catering to the food-conscious. Co-op members made the decision of what foods to buy and how to purchase and distribute it. Between 1969 and 1979, close to 10,000 food co-ops were established.

In a typical food production model, a store is owned by a company, which is in turn managed by either a board of directors and shareholders if the company is publicly owned, or a collection of private individuals if it is not. A food cooperative, in contrast, is directly owned by both its employees and its members, people who shop at the cooperative and who typically pay a nominal fee for joining. When the store makes a profit, much as with a corporation, these profits are either divided among the members or reinvested in the business. These decisions are often made by a board, for which any member of the cooperative can run. In general, membership is open to any community member, with stores adopting official policies of nondiscrimination. However, some cooperatives will limit membership to a certain geographic area, such as a state. A food cooperative in Ames, Iowa. = Pricing = Each cooperative has a different fee structure, typically determined by its management, but in general, members of the public will have the option of purchasing a membership that will yield discounted prices on food, as well as a vote on decisions. A key difference with corporations is that while voting power on corporate decisions is in proportion to the number of shares owned, nearly all cooperatives operate according to the “one member, one vote” principle. = Tax policy = In the US, cooperatives are taxed differently than small businesses. Earnings of the cooperative itself are not subject to business taxes; however, any profits made by the individual members are treated as income and as such are subject to income taxes. = Comparison with CSA = In contrast, a similar program, community supported agriculture, socializes the risks associated with growing the food, transferring it from the growers to consumers. These two programs often work in concert in rural areas, and are associated with each other by consumers. However, in a CSA program, the consumer is purchasing a limited ownership in the farm, the production of the food, instead of the grocery store, the distribution of the food.  Scale of cooperatives in the US  Food cooperatives in various forms operate on a large scale in the United States, occupying a noticeable part of the grocery market, albeit with large geographic variation. One study found that grocery cooperatives claim 485,000 total members in the United States, with 290 total stores. However, differences in definition can lead to measurement discrepancies, depending on what exactly one defines as a food based cooperative, since many cooperatives operate in the food sector, but are not restricted to groceries. For example, “Farm supply and marketing” cooperative members totaled 2.484 million in the US.  Formation of a food cooperative  In general, cooperatives are formed by a core group of members who form the initial governing body. These members must contribute enough in initial membership fees to get the grocery store off the ground and finance startup costs, such as purchasing a store, which can be a significant challenge for the cooperative model. The logistical and financial obstacles associated with planning a store and establishing a distribution network are significant, especially when no individual owns the store. This contrasts with typical corporate grocery stores, which can be financed using debt or equity, and whose owners can eventually reap a profit to recoup their investment. Nevertheless, cooperatives claim higher levels of success than for-profit businesses: after 5 years, 90% of cooperatives are still in business, compared to 3-5% of businesses.  Benefits  = Market benefits = Cooperatives also potentially have spillover effects on the rest of the grocery store market. According to researchers at the University of Wisconsin, “Cooperatives play a key role in agricultural markets not only because they account for a significant fraction of economic activity in this sector, but also because they are believed to generate a pro-competitive effect in imperfectly competitive markets.” The grocery market, in particular, is often not very competitive in geographically isolated areas, with only enough consumer base to support one major supermarket. In response to high prices caused by this monopoly, a cooperative may spring up, supported by a network of consumers looking for lower prices. Because the profits are redistributed to the members, a traditional grocery store must reduce its profits in order to compete. Lastly, some studies indicate the spillover benefits to the community are significant. One found that “For every $1,000 spent at a food co-op, $1,606 goes to the local economy; for every $1 million in sales, 9.3 jobs are created”. = Agricultural sector benefits = Academic research has also described the benefits cooperatives can have in economically connected sectors, namely food production: “Cooperatives play other socially beneficial roles in the agricultural sector. They provide an opportunity for farmers to share risk and to control managerial decision-making for their direct benefit. Additionally, they offer a credence attribute— farmer ownership—which can be attached to farm commodities, thus providing additional value to some consumers.” = Consumer benefits = Another potential benefit to members is the different niche of the food market often occupied by cooperatives. Cooperatives often have a focus on local, organic, or otherwise more sustainably sourced products. Consumers often support the local ownership of the cooperative model, in contrast to many grocery store chains owned by multinational corporations.  Geography  In the United States, food cooperatives are also far more common in the northern states of the US, with Vermont, Minnesota, and Wisconsin having the highest concentrations. Vermont, in particular, has a concentration three times higher than any other state. Food cooperatives are also co-located with higher incomes, higher educational attainment, the presence of land trusts, and population over age 65. In the United States, there are a number of regional associations of food cooperatives. These associations can provide logistical support, a distribution network, or even operate under the franchise model, which can provide a recognizable brand.

Plot Another Hope is an alternative history re-imagining of the events in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope (1977). Mixing familiar moments from the film with new story material, Jareo drew inspiration and mixed in elements from the prequel films. The book deals in minute details of the Death Star, the politics of Darth Vader's henchmen, and insight into Vader and Princess Leia's adoptive parents. Biggs Darklighter, a minor character in the film, has been given an expanded role. The text adds a \\"Mary Sue\\" version of Ryoo Naberrie, described as \\"a gutsy underling on the Death Star\\". Publication and response Jareo printed the book through her WordTech Communications company, and made the material available for sale through Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, and Powell's City of Books. Jareo claimed the book was \\"not a commercial project\\", and that copyright law was not an issue because she wrote the book for herself. Despite these claims, Jareo agreed to Lucasfilm's request to stop selling Another Hope. Science-fiction authors Keith R. A. DeCandido and Lee Goldberg observed that problems with Another Hope would impact, and perhaps harm, print on demand publications.

The system has ten lines and 159 stations running on of track. It is operated and maintained by the Nanjing Metro Group Company. The total length of the system ranks fourth in China, after Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. In 2017, the metro system carried a total of 977.4 million annual riders. Proposals for a metro system serving Nanjing first began in 1984, with approval by the State Planning Commission granted in 1994. Construction began on the initial 16-station Line 1 in 1999, and opened in 2005. Future expansion plans include three lines set to open within the next few years, with several more awaiting approval to begin construction. History =Early proposals= In 1984 the first serious proposal for construction of a subway appeared in the Municipal People's Congress. In April 1986, the Nanjing Integrated Transport Planning group was established to research on how to implement a subway system in Nanjing. In December 1986 the team published the \\"Nanjing Metro Initial Phase\\". The phase consists of a north–south line, east–west line and a diagonal Northwest to Southeast line. The three lines meet in the city center forming a triangle. A revision of the \\"Nanjing City Master Plan\\" in 1993 added another line through the urban core, and three light metro lines connecting Nanjing's suburbs in Pukou and the at time proposed new airport. In addition a suburban railway to Longtan was proposed. A 1999 report on \\"Nanjing city rapid rail transit network planning\\" further proposed six subway lines, two subway extensions and three light metro lines. In 1994, the State Planning Commission approved the preparatory work for the subway only to have the entire metro project postponed in 1995 amid a national freeze on new metro projects. Major changes were made to \\"Nanjing Urban Rail Transit Network Planning\\" in 2003. The new master plan consisted of 13 lines, of which nine are subway lines and four are light metro lines. The new Line 6 will be a loop line connecting all the urban radial lines. The plan retained the original lines 1, 2 and 3 from the previous plan. According to the new plan, the initial phase would consist of the completion of Metro Line 1 and 2 by 2010. Together the two lines will form a basic \\"cross\\" network. By 2020 the completion of Lines 1, 2, 3, and 4 was to form a more robust \\"pound\\" shaped (#) network. Longer-term plans include the construction of a loop line connecting all existing lines. The plan also identified four subway lines crossing the Yangtze river. =First line= The initial section of Line 1 from Maigaoqiao to Xiaohang received final official approval in 1999. In May 2000, the Experimental Station resumed construction with the entire Line 1 project in full construction in December. A western extension of Line 1 from Xiaohang to a newly built stadium was fast tracked after Nanjing won hosting the National Games. Line 1's initial section and the western extension started trial operations on September 3, 2005, running from Maigaoqiao to Olympic Stadium with 16 stations and a total length of . The opening of the Nanjing Metro Line 1 gave Nanjing the sixth metro system in the Chinese mainland after Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.

It was home to the Portland Rosebuds Pacific Coast Hockey Association franchise from 1914 and 1918 and the Portland Penguins from 1928 to 1941. It was built in 1914 and closed in the 1950s due to concerns about fire safety. History Interior of the Portland Ice Arena. The announcement that Portland would be the site of an ice hippodrome came in October 1913, which declared the rink would be open by December on Northwest Marshall street and between 20 and 21 avenues. In reality the building opened almost a year later. The plan was to run the rink year-round with the exception of summer months where it could be rented out to automobile dealers. A Morning Oregonian article on November 2, 1913 continued to say the hippodrome would be open in December but on January 18, 1914, an article was published saying the construction was delayed until February or March. An article published in the September 27, 1914, edition of the Morning Oregonian announced that the hippodrome would open by December of that year and it would be the largest building of its kind in the world. Its seating could accommodate up to 5,000 patrons. The ice rink was (). Two thousand people attended the grand opening of the rink on November 9, 1914. The building's architect was Arthur J. Maclure and the contractor was Victor J. Carlson. In 1953 the building was given to the University of Portland, which planned to renovate it into a basketball venue. After a few years of plans for renovations the Portland Fire Marshal announced in 1956 he would not allow the building to open unless the old wiring were replaced.

Background Bella Dodd was born Maria Asunta Isabella Visono was born in 1904 in Picerno, Basilicata region, Province of Potenza, Kingdom of Italy, the youngest of ten children. When her family came to the United States, they were very poor, and stopped going to Church. She attended public schools in the New York City area including Evander Childs High School. In 1921, after winning a state scholarship, she attended Hunter College, a public university. She worked summers and received an A.B. in 1925, developing an interest in social issues and drifting into agnosticism. In her senior year, she became president of the student council. She received an MA from Columbia University, writing a thesis entitled \\"Is Congress a Mirror of the Nation?\\" She switched to the legal division from Fall 1927 to June 1930, and received a JD from the School of Law at New York University. In summer 1930 she traveled through Europe; she found Italian Fascism appalling and became vehemently anti-fascist. Dodd met her future husband John Dodd during this trip, and they married in late September. In 1940, her husband left her over political differences. They had no children. Career In fall 1925, Dodd got her first job as a substitute teacher of history at Seward Park High School. In February 1926, she began teaching at Hunter College, which she continued even after passing the New York bar in 1931. On route home from Europe in 1930, Dodd met a group of New York City school teachers in the Teachers Union. She started attending union meetings, but she \\"found them disconcerting because there was so much strife between groups seeking control.\\" She took off time from work after her marriage, but returned to Hunter College by 1932 when the Great Depression affected both her parents and husband. From 1926 to 1938, Dodd taught political science and economics at Hunter College. In 1938, she resigned to become a full-time activist for the New York City Teachers Union (TU). Dodd joined an \\"Anti-Fascist Literature Committee.\\" She was attracted to the Communist Party by Margaret Schlauch: \\"The Communist Party in this country set itself up as the one organization that was fighting fascism.\\" Harriet Silverman introduced her to Party leader Earl Browder. Teachers urged her to attend a \\"Class Room Teachers Association,\\" through which she learned of the Trade Union Unity League (TUUL) and the Teachers Union (TU). She saw Celia Lewis, Clara Richer, and Max Diamond emerge as leaders of the TU's \\"Red minority.\\" A first bill she helped pass led to her promotion as a TU legislative representative, for which she took a six-month leave of absence from Hunter College in Spring 1936, taking over from TU co-founder Abraham Lefkowitz. (Charles J. Hendley was TU president 1935–1945.) Party leaders like Jack Stachel and William Z. Foster demanded that American workers become \\"politicalized\\" and \\"proletarianized.\\" Through the intervention of friend and mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, Dodd got leave again. During the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939), teachers volunteered for the Lincoln Brigade: Dodd names Sid Babsky and Ralph Wardlaw. TU membership rose above 9,000, with a tenth communists. So many college teachers joined that they formed their own New York City College Teachers Union Local 537 AFT. Dorothy Wallace joined the TU as \\"minder\\" for the Soviets, under her brother, vice president Dale Zysman (Party name \\"Jack Hardy\\") who had trained in Moscow. Henry Linville and Abraham Lefkowitz split from the TU to form the New York City Teacher Guild. By 1938, Dodd resigned from Hunter College and took a full-time position in the pro-communist TU, and moved her family to Poughkeepsie to ease access to state legislators in Albany. In 1939, the Hitler-Stalin Pact undermined the TU's public position, and the Rapp-Coudert Committee started its anti- communist investigations, subpoenaing more than 600 teachers supected of communist sympathies. Dodd secretly burned a list of TU members in her possession. By 1940, opposition to the TU had gathered: Linville and Lefkowitz rallied George Googe and other anti-communists from the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the American Federation of Labor (AFL), and individuals including George Counts and John Childs of Teachers College, George Axtelle, Lovestoneites led by Ben Davidson, and teachers from Detroit, Atlanta, and Washington. The Party formed a \\"Committee to Defend the Public Schools\\" and Dodd headed a \\"Women's Trade Union Committee for Peace.\\" By that time, Dodd worked for NY Teacher's Union (TU) and the American Labor Party, but also secretly for the Communist Party. City College of New York expelled 50 teachers, including Morris U. Schappes. Dodd spent 1940-41 defending teachers or finding them new jobs. She also led the TU into new affiliation with United Public Workers as Local 555 UPW. In 1942, she found herself deep in political infighting between communists and socialists over control the American Labor Party. In 1944, she oversaw the opening of the Jefferson School of Social Science, successor to the New York Workers School, orchestrated by Earl Browder and Alexander Trachtenberg. She declined an offer to run the California Labor School. During her time with the TU, Dodd worked closely with the Party, but she was not an open member. As she testified before HUAC in 1953, \\"the Communist Pary was emphatic that professional people engaged in public service who had public jobs were not to be exposed and were not card- carrying members. Rather, she served in the faction that moved the TU \\"in the direction of the Communist Party.\\" By 1943, Dodd's feelings toward the Communist Party had changed: > During the war period I saw how opportunism and selfishness engulfed many > [Party] comrades. They wore expensive clothes, lived in fine apartments, > took long vacations at places provided by men of wealth.... There were the > trade union Communists who rubbed elbows with underworld characters at > communist-financed night clubs, and labor lawyers who were given patronage > by the Party...and now were well established and comfortable. In March 1943, Gil Green convinced Dodd to become an open Communist Party leader. Dodd succeeded Si Gerson (who was enlisting in the Army) as Communist legislative representative for the New York district, retaining an honorary TU position. At Party headquarters, she attended Politburo meetings with Gil Green, Earl Browder, William Z. Foster, Robert Minor, Jim Ford, Jack Stachel, John Williamson, and Elizabeth Gurly Flynn. Dodd, Philip Jones, and Allen Goodwin set up a law office at 25 West 43rd Street for political outreach beyond the Party, including with the National Maritime Union. In 1944, Dodd served on the National Committee of the Communist Party, on the secretariat of the New York State Communist Party along with Si Gerson and Israel Amter, and the National Committee of the \\"Communist Political Association.\\" She later wrote: > By January 1944 I was firmly established at Party headquarters on Twelfth > Street. There I organized the legislative program of the Party; but, more > important still, I supervised the legislative work of the unions, chiefly > the unions of government workers on a state, local, and national level, of > the mass organizations of women, and of 'the youth organizations. Dodd wrote that the Party had control of the CIO Political Action Committee as well as the Independent Committee of Artists, Scientists and Professionals, chaired by sculptorJo Davidson. Depressed by continued infighting, Dodd complained to Gurley Flynn, who sent Dodd on a cross-country speaking tour in 1945, but upon her return to New York she found no improvement. By April 1945, the US Communist Party leader Browder had fallen from favor in Moscow, and he was vocally opposed by Mother Bloor, Gurley Flynn, Ann Burlak, Benjamin J. Davis Jr., and Pat Tuohy. Dodd began angling to leave the Party but was refused. In January 1946, Browder and his followers were expelled from the Party for \\"Browderism\\"; Dodd claimed \\"several thousands were expelled\\". These included writer Ruth McKenney and husband Bruce Minton. Dodd began to come under government suspicion. She told the New York County district attorney's office she had become a Communist \\"because only the Communists seemed to care about what was happening to people in 1932 and 1933.... They were fighting hunger and misery and fascism then; and neither the major political parties nor the churches seemed to care.\\" In Spring 1947, after Foster traveled to Europe for consultations with Moscow, the Party replaced the Daily Worker editor Morris Childs with John Gates, with Dodd abstaining from the vote. Foster announced plans for a new Progressive Party, and in January 1948, \\"before Henry Wallace had made any public statement, in fact even before the Progressive Party had been formally organized, Foster announced through the Associated Press that it was going to be formed and that Henry Wallace would be its standard bearer.\\" By late 1947, Dodd became convinced of her pending Party expulsion for Browderism, and focused on her law work. On June 17, 1949, she heard from the Associated Press: \\"We have received a statement from the Communist Party announcing your expulsion from membership. It says here that you are anti-Negro, anti-Puerto Rican, anti-Semitic, anti-labor, and the defender of a landlord.\\"Starobin, Joseph Robert (1975). American Communism in Crisis, 1943-1957. University of California Press. Ostensibly, she was expelled for representing a landlord in a legal dispute with a renter, violating Party bylaws against defense of private property. =Catholicism= On April 8, 1952, Dodd rejoined the Roman Catholic Church after taking weekly instruction from Monsignor Fulton J. Sheen (whose converts also included Louis F. Budenz and Clare Booth Luce). She became an outspoken proponent for the Catholic Church and a vocal anti-communist, warning against the \\"materialistic philosophy\\" which guided public education and demoraled Americans, as well as formed the basis of both Communism and Nazism. =Congressional Testimony= On March 10, 1953, Dodd testified before a televised hearing of the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee (SISS) about widespread Party infiltration of labor unions and other institutions. The following day, The New York Times front page stated: \\"Bella Dodd Asserts Reds Got Presidential Advisory Posts.\\" Dodd had testified that \\"Communists had got into many legislative offices of Congress and into a number of groups advising the President of the United States,\\" as well as the State of New York's Office of Education in Albany and New York City's Board of Education, and the Party had \\"read the minds\\" of some thousand school and college teachers in New York. It had been very easy for her to inject communist beliefs into her teaching: this was the \\"function of a Communist teacher...to create people willing to accept a Communist government.\\" The only way to root out communism among teachers would be by \\"a Federal investigating group with subpoena power.\\" On June 17-18, 1953, Dodd testified before the U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), under the questioning of HUAC lead counsel Robert Lowe Kunzig. She claimed to have resigned her Party position in 1946 and returned to law. (However, in her memoir, she reports that she continued to use her position as a lawyer to continue Party work until her expulsion in 1949. She testified that she knew J. Peters.) She explained: * \\"The Communist Party in this country set itself up as the one organization that was fighting fascism.\\" * \\"I went in the Teachers' Union and I received $60 a week... When I went to serve as the legislative representative of the Communist Party, I received $50 a week... We weren't doing it for pay. We were doing it because we really believe in it.\\" * Her dedication to Communism arose from nascent Browderism: \\"After the Tehran Conference and Yalta Conference, we were told the United States and the Soviet Union were going forward to a hundred years of peace.\\" * American communists can justify overthrowing their government because \\"They (the Party) divide your loyalty to the 'country' from loyalty to the 'people.'\\" * When she tried to leave the Party in 1946, New York party secretary Bill Norman told her \\"Nobody gets out of the Party. We throw you out, but you don't get out by yourself.\\" She was warned that leaving the Party would descend into becoming a \\"stool pigeon.\\" She remarked, \\"That is a hard word to live with. It is a hard word to live with.\\" She encouraged others to testify: * \\"As far as I know, no one in New York City has been hurt by the fact that he was in the Party if he went to the superintendent and said, 'I was a member. I am no longer.' His or her name hasn't been mentioned publicly. The people who got notoriety are those who asked for it by refusing to answer the question.\\" * \\"The people I know, and I knew practically everyone in New York City who appeared before the various committees, I know of no one who has appeared and claimed the fifth amendment, in New York City, who was not a member of the Communist Party... It is my opinion that those attorneys who advise their clients to take the fifth amendment are putting their clients into a noose.\\" She claimed that more than 1,500 teachers nationwide were members of the Communist Party, and that the Party recruited teachers and professionals, but kept their participation highly secret. However, \\"99.99% [of American teachers] are loyal Americans.\\" In the Party, she said, there was no academic freedom, \\"no room for difference of opinion.\\" Dodd named teachers who were communists or sympathizers (\\"suckers\\", as Kunzig characterized them), including Moe Finkelstein (American Committee for Democracy and Intellectual Freedom), Franz Boas, Albert Einstein, and Christian Gauss. Later life Dodd continued as a lawyer for the rest of her life. In 1968, Dodd made an unsuccessful attempt to become a member of the US Congress as a candidate of the New York Conservative Party; she lost by a significant margin.Milestones: May 9, 1969, Time, 9 May 1969. She came in last place with 3% of the vote, against Democratic incumbent Leonard Farbstein (easily reelected with 53%), Donald Weeden (Republican), Ralph Denat (Liberal), and David McReynolds (Peace and Freedom).

The college has around 680 students, with 50 teaching staff and 30 associate staff. Opened in 2001 on the site of France Hill School; the college is currently designated a specialist Business and Enterprise College status by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. History Kings International College was opened on the site of the previous France Hill School in September 2001. The relaunch came as a result of a partnership between 3E's enterprises (a non-profit educational company based at the CTC Kingshurst in Birmingham) and Surrey County Council. It was intended that the relaunch would address the falling rolls and a financial deficit that existed at the time. The project was partially successful in that the rolls did increase initially, but the national decline in student numbers after 2002, which impact until approximately 2014, mean that the college is not full, although by 2018 it is predicted there will be insufficient places in the area and the College may need to increase its capacity. France Hill House school was opened in France Hill Drive, Camberley, in the 1940s. It moved to a brand new building in Watchetts Drive in the summer of 1958, retaining part of its original name by becoming France Hill County Secondary School. The original buildings were retained for some years, accommodating rising rolls in the 1960s. Later the old buildings were taken over by what had been Yorktown and Camberley junior and primary schools. In March 2011, Surrey County Council proposed that Tomlinscote School take over the Kings International School and that years 7, 8 and 9 be based on the Kings site and 10, 11 and 6th form on the Tomlinscote site. Initial meetings with parents at both schools suggested united opposition to the plans and sparked an internet debate. The school used to be in a 'soft federation' with Tomlinscote school. Curriculum The school is one of few state schools currently offering the International Baccalaureate. In years 7-11 the curriculum covers all the requirements of the National Curriculum and students are routinely entered for GCSE and other qualifications from year 9 onwards. The school is the only school in Surrey Heath that enters students for a GCSE in Humanities a year early. This allows students to gain exam experience before entering their GCSE years. The college is also a member of SHAPE (the Surrey Heath Area Partnership for Education) which is working towards effective collaboration in the curriculum across all the secondary schools in the borough. =GCSE results= In 2005, the school achieved a 63% pass rate of students receiving 5 A*-C grades, rising further in 2006, with 66% of students gaining the national standard. In the last three years the results have been consistently around 55% gaining 5 A*-C with 40-43% gaining this standard with Maths and English. Catchment Kings International students arrive from over 20 different primary schools in the area. The Watchetts Junior School in Camberley is the most local feeder, providing about 30% of the students, while other schools from across the borough of Surrey Heath provide the majority. There are also about 10% of students who cross from neighbouring Hampshire and Berkshire schools given the proximity of Camberley to the county boundaries. In recent years the college has experienced increasing cultural diversity. The local settlement of many ex-Gurkha families, for example, has meant that the College has about 10% students of Nepalese origin and this has resulted in an international partnership with a Nepalese school.  Projects  The school is regularly featured on local news channels for its projects, most recently for its involvement in a back pain project. In 2004 a selection of students constructed a life-size replica of a World War II panther tank made from wood, this was followed by a project in 2006 where a life size replica of an early aircraft was constructed. Facilities The college buildings date from the late 1950s with the vast majority of classrooms located in one and two storey buildings around a central 'quad'. Significant refurbishment of some of the buildings was undertaken in 2001 including the addition of a cyber cafe. The site is quite large for the number of students and there are extensive playing fields. Sport is further catered for with a swimming pool, an AstroTurf and a newly regenerated sports hall complex on site. There are data projectors in nearly all classrooms and interactive whiteboards in more than 50% of the rooms. The college has large well equipped drama and dance studios. The drama studio was completely refurbished in 2013. The site is heavily used by the local community in the evenings for a range of adult education classes. Camberley Athletics club and Camberley & Farnborough Hockey Club are both located on site and the college has very strong links to the neighbouring Rugby and Cricket clubs. The Beacon church is also a user of the facilities on a Sunday morning. Alumni * Paul Darke, academic, artist and disability rights activist attended France Hill School * Alex Matthews.

Executive cars are larger than compact executive cars (and the non-luxury equivalent mid-size cars), and smaller than luxury saloons / full-size luxury sedans. The term has also been adopted by Euro NCAP, a European organization founded to test for car safety.  Background  The term was coined in the 1960s to describe cars targeted at successful professionals and middle-to-senior managers. It was used by businesses as an incentive for employees in senior roles and to exploit Britain and Europe's tax schemes as a company owned vehicle. Early executive cars typically offered engines with displacements of , compared with for an equivalent sized— but less luxurious— \\"large family car\\". Prior to the 1990s, executive cars were typically sedans, however in recent years they have also been produced in other body styles, such as estates (station wagons), convertibles, coupés, and five-door hatch versions. They typically need to be \\"comfortable, refined and display some form of driving pleasure\\" on occasion.  Body styles  In general, executive cars are 4-door sedans. Some manufacturers seek to differentiate their offerings by making them as estate variants, or with 5-door hatchback bodies—in particular Rover, Saab, Renault and Citroën formerly have been known to prefer such body styles, with Ford also offering such models through the 1990s, and Audi and BMW have recently offered such body styles for their executive cars. Until the 1990s, some models were also available as 2-door coupés.  Production by country  = China = 2012 Roewe 750 One of the first Chinese-built executive cars was the 2006 Roewe 750, based on the Rover 75. In 2012, the Roewe 950 was introduced, which is a re-bodied version of the 2010 Buick LaCrosse. Several overseas brands have produced long wheelbase versions of cars specifically for the Chinese market, due to the preference Chinese owners have for being driven by a chauffeur. Examples include the \\"XF L\\" version of the 2016 Jaguar XF (X260),Jaguar XFL: long-wheelbase XF targets Chinese market Sam Sheehan 25 April 2016 the \\"Li\\" version of the 2017 BMW 5 Series (G30) and other models from Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo. = France = In France, executive cars are known as \\"'\\", a class of comfortable long distance cars that first emerged on the French market in the 1930s. Peugeot began producing large cars in the early 1900s. Following the Peugeot 601 being discontinued in 1935, Peugeot ceased production of large cars until the Peugeot 604 was introduced in 1975.Autocar, November 1977, p. 17Motor, 6 December 1975, p. 2 The 604 was replaced by the Peugeot 605 in 1989, which in turn was replaced by the Peugeot 607 in 1999. Following the end of the 607's production run in 2010, Peugeot no longer produces any executive cars. Citroën's first large car was the 1934 Citroën Traction Avant. In 1955, the Traction Avant was replaced by the iconic Citroën DS, which was replaced in 1974 by the Citroën CX and then the 1989 Citroën XM. The XM was discontinued in 2000 and for five years Citroën did not produce an executive car. The 2005 Citroën C6 was produced until 2012, and Citroën has not produced any executive cars since. Renault entered the executive car segment in 1975 with the Renault 20/30 models. They were replaced, in 1983, by the Renault 25 which featured a fastback rear end. In 1992, the 25 was replaced by the Renault Safrane. The Safrane was replaced by the Renault Vel Satis hatchback in 2002, which in turn was replaced by the Latitude in 2010 and later the Talisman. = Germany = The equivalent class for cars in Germany is \\"'\\" (lit. upper-middle class) as defined by the German federal authorities. Luxury cars larger than this are referred to as Oberklasse (\\"upper class\\"). Mercedes-Benz has produced large luxury cars since the early 1900s. Following World War II, Mercedes Benz's first all-new models were the Mercedes-Benz W120 executive cars. This lineage continues through to the present and has been marketed as the Mercedes-Benz E-Class since 1993. The Mercedes-Benz CLS-Class four-door fastback was added to the company's model range in 2004, with a shooting brake body style also produced from 2012-2017. BMW's first large luxury car was the 1936-1941 BMW 326. After a hiatus of 21 years, BMW's next executive car models were the 1962 New Class Sedans. In 1972, the New Class was replaced by the BMW 5 Series, which remains in production today. Over the seven generations of 5 Series, it has been produced in sedan, wagon and four-door fastback body styles. The first large luxury car produced by Audi was the Audi 100, which was released in 1968. The Audi 100 was replaced by the Audi A6 in 1994, which remains in production today. In 2010, the Audi A7 four-door fastback model range was added. The Ford Granada is an executive car produced by Ford Europe from 1972-1994. = Italy = 2013-present Maserati Ghibli Fiat's first large luxury car was the Fiat 24-32 HP, which was introduced in 1903. Other large luxury Fiats produced before World War II include the Fiat 510, Fiat 520, Fiat 527 and Fiat 2800. In 1959, the Fiat 1800 and 2100 executive sedans and station wagons were introduced. These models were replaced by the Fiat 2300 in 1961. FIAT's last executive car was the Fiat 130, which was produced from 1969-1977. Lancia produced several large luxury cars prior to World War II, including the Lancia Lambda, Lancia Artena and Lancia Aprilia. The Lancia Flavia was an executive car began production in 1961 and was replaced by the Lancia 2000 in 1971. The 2000 was replaced by the Lancia Gamma, which was released in 1976. In 1984, the Gamma was replaced by the Lancia Thema, then the Lancia Kappa in 1994. The Lancia Thesis, produced from 2001-2009 is the last executive car produced by Lancia. From 2011-2015, the Chrysler 300 was sold in Europe as the Lancia Thema. Maserati's first executive is the Maserati Ghibli, which has been in production since 2013. = Japan = 1998-2000 Mazda Xedos 9 Toyota has been producing large luxury cars since the 1955 Toyota Crown was released. The Crown remains in production today and is currently in its fifteenth generation. In 1991, the Toyota Aristo executive car began production and since 1993 has been marketed under Toyota's luxury sub-brand as the Lexus GS. The Lexus GS is currently in its fourth generation. Nissan's longest-running executive car began production in 1959 as the Prince Gloria, which was later renamed the Nissan Gloria, following the merger of Nissan and Prince. The Prince/Nissan Gloria was produced for 12 generations until 2004. Nissan's first executive car was the 1960 Nissan Cedric, which was produced until 2004 (although a taxi/fleet version remained in production until 2015). The Cedric was replaced by the 2004 Nissan Fuga— also sold as the Infiniti M since 2003 and the Infiniti Q70 since 2012— which presently remains in production. Mitsubishi began producing executive cars in 1964 with the Mitsubishi Debonair. The Debonaire was replaced in 1999 by the Mitsubishi Proudia, which was discontinued in 2001 and then returned from 2012-2016 as a rebadged Nissan Fuga. Mazda's first executive car was the 1969 Mazda Luce. In 1991, the Luce was replaced by the Mazda Sentia, which was produced until 1999. The Mazda Millenia— also sold as the Mazda Xedos 9 and the Eunos 800— was produced from 1993-2002. Honda introduced their first executive car, the Honda Legend (sold as the Acura Legend in the United States) in 1985. The Legend was produced until 2012, and then from 2014 until the present. = South Korea = A growing number of Asian manufacturers started offering executive cars, such as Kia Cadenza, Hyundai Azera and Genesis G80. = Spain = SEAT's only executive car was the 1963-1973 SEAT 1500, a rebadged version of the FIAT 2300. = Sweden = 1991-1994 Saab 9000 Saab's first executive car was the 1984 Saab 9000, which was produced in sedan and liftback body styles. The 9000 was replaced by the Saab 9-5. In 2010 the second generation of the 9-5 switched to a platform shared with various General Motors models, until Saab went bankrupt in 2012. Volvo began producing executive cars in 1968 with the Volvo 164. In 1974, the 164 was replaced by the Volvo 260, which was replaced by the Volvo 760 in 1982 and then the Volvo 960 in 1994. The 960 was renamed the S90 (sedan models) and V90 (wagon models) in 1996. The Volvo S80 was released in 1998, which was replaced in 2016 by a new generation of Volvo S90/V90 sedans and wagons that presently remain in production. = United Kingdom = Daimler Company produced luxury cars in various sizes starting in the late 1890s. The lineage that led to their executive cars began with the 1923-1929 Daimler 16 and Daimler 16/55 models, which were followed in 1932 by the Daimler Fifteen. The Fifteen was replaced by the 1937 Daimler New Fifteen and then the 1939 Daimler Consort (originally called the \\"Daimler 2½ Litre\\"). The Consort was replaced by the 1953-1958 Daimler Conquest. In 1962, the Daimler 2.5 V8 (later renamed the \\"Daimler V8-250\\") was released, based on the Jaguar Mark 2. In 1966, the Daimler Sovereign was introduced, based on the Jaguar 420. The Sovereign and V8-250 were produced alongside each other until they both ended production in 1969. Jaguar began production of executive cars in 1935 with the first of the Jaguar Mark IV models. These were replaced by the 1948-1951 Jaguar Mark V. The Mark V's successor increased in size to the full-size luxury car segment, so the next executive car was the 1955 Jaguar Mark 1. In 1959, the Mark 1 was replaced by the Jaguar Mark 2. In 1963, the Jaguar S-Type was introduced and sold alongside the Mark 2. Both models were replaced by the 1966-1968 Jaguar 420. Following a 30-year hiatus from the executive car market, Jaguar returned in 1998 with the retro-styled S-Type. The S-Type was replaced by the 2007 Jaguar XF (X250) and then the 2015 Jaguar XF (X260), which currently remains in production. Humber's first executive car was the 1945 Humber Hawk. The Hawk was available with features such as two- tone and metallic paintwork, leather upholstery, wood trimmings and a sunroof. Production of the Hawk, along with the similarly sized Humber Super Snipe and Imperial, ceased when the brand was dissolved in 1967. Rover entered the executive car market in 1948 with the Rover P3. The P3 was replaced by the Rover P4 in 1949, which was produced until 1964. The 1963 Rover P6 was the next executive car produced by Rover, which was replaced by the Rover SD1 in 1976 (marketed as the Standard 2000 in India). The SD1 was replaced by the 1986 Rover 800 series, which was a jointly developed with the Honda Legend and had a front-wheel drive layout. In 1999, the 800 series was replaced by the Rover 75, which was produced until 2005. The 75 straddled the executive and compact executive categories due to its size, although a long wheelbase version was available. The first executive car to be badged a Triumph were the 1946-1954 Triumph 1800/2000/Renown models. Triumph's next and final entry to the executive car market was the 1963-1977 Triumph 2000, which was a sales success in Britain. Ford Europe's first executive car was the 1950 Ford Zephyr. The Zephyr— and related Consul, Zodiac and Executive models— were produced over four generations until 1972. The 1972 Ford Granada was initially built in the United Kingdom before switching to being imported from Germany in 1976. In 1985, the Ford Scorpio was released, being sold in the U.K. as a Ford Granada until 1994. Vauxhall entered the executive car market with the 1978 Vauxhall Carlton and related Vauxhall Royale/Senator, which were based on the Opel Rekord E. In 1986, the Vauxhall Carlton Mark II switched to the German- built Opel Omega A, which was replaced in 1994 by the Vauxhall Omega (a rebadged version of the Opel Omega B). = United States = In the United States, executive cars are referred to as full-sized cars.

K. Munshi and offered Mr Fazeel to join his government as the chief law officer of the state. A few years later, Zia ul Haq, the military President in uniform dismissed Junejo due to political rivalry in May 1988. Zia wanted to retain Fazeel and offered him a place in his Zia's Senate Majlis Shoora (the General's version of a technocrat advisory body). However, Fazeel chose to resign. He would often remark to his friends: \\"The Attorney General comes with the Prime Minister and goes with the Prime Minister.\\" Consequently, he was named amongst Pakistan's 100 most influential citizens in a book published in 1990. Junejo case Following the dismissal of the Junejo government, Fazeel was retained by the Former Prime Minister, to contest the dismissal in the Supreme Court of Pakistan, in the famous haji Saifullah's case. The Supreme Court invalidated Zia's action terming it illegal. However, it allowed the Federation of Pakistan to continue with the announced dates of general elections in Pakistan. The historical context of PIL (Public Interest Litigation) in Pakistan The seeds of PIL were planted in Pakistan in the mid to late-1980s by such luminaries of the legal fraternity as, inter alia, Chief Justices Muhammad Haleem and Nasim Hasan Shah and former Attorney General Ali Ahmad Fazeel. In the wake of a newly reintroduced Constitution, elements within judicial circles began to debate the question of how the fundamental rights enshrined therein could be effectively enforced by a population which was (and is) largely ignorant or unaware of their rights. Part of the answer to this question was identified by Chief Justice Muhammad Haleem as a “massification” of society; where citizens were “increasingly drawn together” on the basis of rights and interests. Former Attorney General Ali Ahmad Fazeel and Former Chief Justice of Pakistan Nasim Hasan Shah also recognised the phenomenon of “massification” and, carrying the principle to its logical conclusion, were able to formulate more concrete answers to the question: That the enforcement of the rights of groups of people could be achieved if the law recognised the enforcement of rights beyond the concept of the aggrieved person; that justice for all could be served if the rights of groups of people could be enforced.

His photographs of the American West were used in more environmental campaigns than those of any other photographerhttps://www.sierraclub.org/library/philip- hydehttps://www.outdoorphotographer.com/on-location/featured- stories/landscape-masters-through-time/.  Education  Hyde first attended Ansel Adams' photography program at the California School of Fine Arts, now the San Francisco Art Institute, beginning with the Summer Session in 1946 and enrolling in the full-time professional photography training, the first of its kind, in the Fall of 1947, studying under photographers such as Edward Weston, Minor White, Imogen Cunningham and Dorothea Lange Gunderson, Comer and Klochko (2006). The Moment of Seeing: Minor White at the California School of Fine Art. Chronicle BooksWilliam Heick, Ira Latour, C. Macauley (2016). The Golden Decade, Photography at the California School of Fine Arts 1945-55.Steidl . Out of thousands of Ansel Adams' students, Hyde was one of the few Ansel Adams asked to teach with him.  Career with the Sierra Club  Hyde became a contributing photographer for the Sierra Club Annual in 1950. He photographed for This is Dinosaur: Echo Park Country and Its Magic Rivers, a 1955 book edited by Wallace Stegner highlighting a proposed dam on the Green River in Dinosaur National Monument in Utah and Colorado. Hyde eventually became the primary conservation photographer for the Sierra Club. David Brower commissioned him to photograph for what came to be known as \\"battle books\\", that helped the Sierra Club lead a coalition of environmental groups to establish or expand numerous national parks, wilderness areas and national seashoreshttp://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Philip-Hyde-leading-nature- photographer-2499297.php. This series of books the Sierra Club called The Exhibit Format Series. The most well-known photographers for the series were Ansel Adams, Eliot Porter and Philip Hyde. The Exhibit Format Series helped bring national attention to the Sierra Club and the cause of conservation and popularized the coffee table photography book paving the way for thousands of books of this type in the years since.Tom Turner (1991). Sierra Club: 100 Years of Protecting Nature. Abrams. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the US Bureau of Reclamation proposed two dams in the Colorado River on either end of the Grand Canyon. The Sierra Club published a book called Time and the River Flowing: Grand Canyon in 1964 in a successful campaign to turn public opinion against these dam projects that threatened the integrity of the wild river and its canyon. Hyde was the primary photographer. This book reshaped the image of the Grand Canyon for Americans and triggered an outpouring of support and letters from all over the world to prevent the flooding of the canyon. Hyde's photographs appeared in campaigns to create North Cascades National Park, Redwood National Park, Point Reyes National Seashore, High Sierra wilderness, the Wind River Range, Canyonlands, islands off Puerto Rico, Big Sur, Kings Canyon, Sequoia National Park, Denali National Park, Tongass National Forest, the Navajo Tribal Parks, the Oregon Cascades, and many other national treasures.Various volumes--the Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series--see books above--see also David Brower's Foreword to Navajo Wildlands. Hyde said, \\"For every place there will always be people that want to exploit it, and there will always be people—hopefully—that want to save it and keep it as it is. Even with the risk of inviting the crowds into paradise, better to publish your photographs and rally the troops. What’s in the frame of the photograph matters artistically, to be sure, but what’s outside the frame can destroy it.\\"Edward Abbey and Philip Hyde (1971). Slickrock: The Canyon Country of Southeast Utah.Sierra Club Books  Color Photography  Hyde began making color photographs in 1948. In 1949, the California School of Fine Arts photography department supplemented its usual black and white training with a color photography class that Philip Hyde attended. The Sierra Club Exhibit Format Series began to introduce color photography to their books in 1962. In Wildness Is The Preservation of the World by Eliot Porter was entirely in color and Island In Time: The Point Reyes Peninsula contained a significant number of color photographic reproductionsHarold Gilliam (1962). Island In Time: The Point Reyes Peninsula. Sierra Club Books. Philip Hyde's color photographs also appeared in Time and The River Flowing: Grand Canyon, Navajo Wildlands and other Sierra Club books before the 1970s. After spending time in the desert and discovering improvements in the dye transfer printing process, in the 1970s Hyde gradually transitioned completely away from black-and-white photography to focus solely on color. He collaborated with author Edward Abbey on the desert classic, \\"Slickrock: The Canyon Country of Southeast Utah,\\" (1971) yet another Sierra Club book published to highlight the threats to wilderness, in this case, the Utah Redrock country of Canyonlands National Park, Capitol Reef National Park, and the Escalante River wilderness..

It was followed by a sequel in 1980, Everything Happens to Me. The film's theme song \\"Sheriff\\", written and performed, like the rest of the soundtrack, by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis (then known as Oliver Onions), was a local airplay hit in the same year.  Plot  One morning, the little town of Newnan, Georgia, is thrown into hysteria when a UFO is reported over the nearby lake; even the personnel from the nearby Air Force base is mobilized. The only one remaining untouched by this hubbub is Sheriff Hall (Spencer), the big and punchy keeper of the local law; indeed, he does not believe in aliens, especially since layabouts like Brennan (Joe Bugner) use the excitement to commit all sorts of mischief. Still, strange things begin to happen to some of the citizens who share his point of view: a barber's chair begins to spin rapidly around its axis – along with its customer – and an ice cream cart suddenly disgorges its entire load (and more) onto the street after the vendor makes a joke about the aliens being hungry for his ice cream. The same night, a blackout hits the city. Hall goes on patrol when his rheumatic deputy Allen (Luigi Bonos) calls him to retrieve a runaway boy. Arriving at the boy's favorite place, the local amusement park, Hall finds not one but two boys; one of them – wearing a silver spacesuit – turns out to be the runaway, the other (an apparent nine- year-old; Cary Guffey) perpetually introduces himself as H7-25, comes up with space-related terms like lightyears and spaceship, brandishes a strange device which makes all things around him go haywire, and even enables Brennan (who has been taken into custody) to escape on two occasions and Allen to (temporarily) overcome his rheumatism. Still, the sheriff is not convinced – not until the boy irradiates him with what he calls \\"bio-magnetic energy\\", enabling him to make a very big trout leap into his hands and a horse talk in English! Meanwhile, however, an ambitious Air Force Captain named Briggs (Raimund Harmstorf) sees his chance with the UFO sighting and the evidence of an alien landing (which is, of course, H7-25's doing and caused the aforementioned blackout) to further his own career. Working without the knowledge of his highly sceptical general, Briggs finally manages to track down the boy – but his attempts to take him away are foiled by the sheriff's hard-hitting fists and H7-25's technical wizard device, as well as Brennan's assistance. Finally, while Hall and H7-25 camp out at Stone Mountain to await the arrival of the boy's pick-up, Briggs and his men manage to kidnap the boy and bring him to the base. The sheriff, however, manages to infiltrate the facility and gets the boy out. In a mass showdown at the local fire brigade hall, where a party was to be held, Briggs and his men get their share from the Sheriff Hall, the little alien and their friends. Later that night, a spaceship comes to pick up H7-25, and he and Hall part ways. But as Hall returns home, he suddenly finds H7-25 sitting in the back of his car – he has managed to get an additional period of leave on Earth to spend with his big friend.

Established in 1994 as WBYA, the station serves the Bangor area. The stations is owned by the Educational Media Foundation. The station carries Educational Media Foundation's K-LOVE Christian music format, simulcasting co-owned WKVZ.  History  Previous to simulcasting K-LOVE the station was an oldies station simulcasting co-owned WGUY and a modern rock station, owned by Clear Channel Broadcasting. Over Clear Channel's nearly 7 years of ownership the station shifted from classic rock to modern rock, all while carrying the syndicated Bob & Tom Show. Previous to Clear Channel's ownership, the station was owned by Moonsong Communications, owners of WVOM where it was an Adult Alternative Rock station and simulcasted WVOM for a time. During the 1990s it known as \\"The Wave\\" and with the call letters WBYA (no relation to the current WBYA 105.5 in Camden, Maine) simulcasting the classical music of WAVX in Thomaston (now WBQX). From 2001-2003 and 2004-2006 WFZX was simulcasted on 97.7 WNSX Winter Harbor. From January 2001 to August 2006 the station primarily focused on Classic rock artists such as The Eagles, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. In September 2006, a shift in programming occurred, playing newer acts such as Nickelback, Three Doors Down, Buckcherry and Red Hot Chili Peppers and still playing harder edged classic rock artists like Aerosmith. A year later, the station would dump the general rock format for Bangor's first modern rock station since the demise of 97X in the 1990s (Now country music WBFB). The station also carried New England Patriots football from 2002 to 2005 and NASCAR racing from Motor Racing Network. The station would carry the modern rock format until Clear Channel Communications sold their entire Maine group to Blueberry Broadcasting.

Biography Charles L. Thomas was born on February 12, 1843 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He left his home at Boudes Ferry Landing, Ohio to enlist in the 11th Ohio Cavalry in June 1863. He was mustered in at Cincinnati, Ohio. Thomas served in the West along the Overland Road for the duration of the Civil War, earning a promotion to Corporal in February 1864. During the Powder River Expedition in Montana Territory in September, 1865, Captain Frank North returned to the camp of Brigadier General Patrick E. Connor, Companies E and K, of the 11th Ohio Cavalry, and the left wing of the Powder River Expedition after a scout with 50 men. He reported that the right and center columns of the Powder River Expedition under Colonel Nelson D. Cole and Lieutenant Colonel Samuel Walker were surrounded by Indians on the Powder River. General Patrick Conner called for a volunteer \\"to go as a scout and find Cole or perish in the attempt.\\" Corporal Charles L. Thomas was the only man who volunteered to go. Connor detailed Thomas, one other soldier, and two Indian scouts to carry out the mission. Connor told him he could have any animal in the camp for his mission, so Thomas chose Second Lieutenant Oscar Jewett's fine gray horse, which he said \\"was the finest horse I ever saw.\\" Jewett objected and Connor threatened to have him arrested. Corporal Thomas and the three other unnamed men left Conner's camp at 7 a.m. on September 14, 1865 to find Colonels Cole and Walker and deliver to them a message from General Connor. That first day, the small party had several fights with small groups of Indians in the area, and they continued traveling throughout the night. On the second day, as they followed Cole's and Walker's trail along the Powder River, Thomas' group was again sighted and \\"began to exchange shots - it was a running fight for the balance of the day.\\" Thomas was wounded by an arrow in the right leg, and he killed an Indian warrior and captured his horse, which had a U.S. Cavalry brand and had previously belonged to an unfortunate soldier of the 6th Michigan Cavalry. Thomas kept the animal with him in case his own horse was shot. Later that day, he rescued Private John Hutson of the 2nd Missouri Light Artillery, who had been abandoned by Cole's column because he was unable to walk. Hutson was hiding when Thomas found the private. Charles got him onto the spare horse, and brought him into Cole's and Walker's camp when they arrived at about 9 p.m. and delivered General Connor's message. The four men had ridden for 39 hours traveling over 135 miles alone in hostile territory. Thomas recalled that he had \\"left Camp Connor with over 350 rounds of ammunition and had 17 shots left when I arrived at Colonel Cole's Camp.\\" He also said that \\"My old Spencer rifle was getting so hot I could not hold the barrel with my necked hand.\\" The next morning, September 16, Connor provided Thomas' detail with an escort of 15 men commanded by Lieutenant Thomas H. Jones of the 2nd Missouri Artillery to report back to General Connor. Corporal Thomas and the two scouts arrived back at his camp on September 18, 1865. In all, Thomas and his three companions rode nearly 200 miles in less than 100 hours. Charles Thomas was promoted to Sergeant and mustered out in 1866. He returned to Ohio and later moved to Kansas. He was awarded the Medal of Honor on August 24, 1894. Charles L. Thomas died on February 24, 1923 in Dwight, Kansas. He is buried in the Dwight-Morris cemetery, in Morris County, Kansas.

The movie takes place in Paris during the 1970s.  Plot  Ten years after having left high school, four friends, Momo, Léon, Alain and Bruno meet for the birth of the child of their friend Tomasi, who recently died. Together they dwell on their mutual memories concerning their last year at their Parisian high school during the seventies. This includes demonstrations, first experiments with drugs and women and also the contents of the courses. Cast * Romain Duris as Tomasi ** A rebellious, hedonistic teenager. When Barbara's friends introduce him to drugs, he quickly turns into a self-destructive truant who hangs around most of his time in Barbara's squat. Still he hits on Sophie and befathers her with a child before he dies of a drug overdose. *Julien Lambroschini as Bruno **Tomasi's best friend, and the most artistically talented of the group. He falls in love with Barbara and leads his friends into the squat where she lives with addicts. Due to this, and because he believes he could have saved Tomasi if only he had been a better friend, Bruno blames himself for Tomasi's death. *Joachim Lombard as Léon **The most politically conscious of the group and the brother of a high school dean. Their relationship is tense, especially because his brother was involved in the May 1968 events and accuses Léon's friends of just parroting catchphrases. (Only late Léon will admit he never understood what class struggle is actually about). As a Class President Léon is often torn between his friends and his responsibilities. He has a huge crush on fellow class president Christine (Hélène de Fougerolles), but doesn't dare to act upon it because her preppiness is the target of her friends' ridicule. That he will regret he later on. *Nicolas Koretzky as Momo **The son of a deaf-mute baker, with whom he has a strained relationship. While his father takes it for guaranteed that his son will become a baker too, Momo feels guilty for having other plans. *Vincent Elbaz as Chabert **A reckless teenager who concentrates on sports and parties. He is somewhat of a class clown, often irritating his friends who consider him immature. Within the group, Chabert is the only one who seems to retain his integrity throughout the movie. *Lisa Faulkner as Barbara **A British student who came to France as an assistant English teacher. She dwells in a squat with a bunch of hippies, who indulge in heavy drug use (particularly LSD). She falls for Bruno but their relationship dissolves when she heads back to England. *Julie-Anne Roth as Marie **a friend of the boys' who is committed to feminism. Yet she implies once being sexually harassed was flattering after all. She is very politically conscious, making their friends believe she and Léon will eventually become a couple. Léon later explains that this very expectation kept them from ever dating. * Hélène de Fougerolles as Christine * Élodie Bouchez as Sophie * Caroline Damiens as Nora * Coco Bouiller as Félicité * Eric Andreini as Thierry * Jackie Berroyer as Jo * Caroline Proust as Squat girl References External links  Category:1994 films Category:Films directed by Cédric Klapisch Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Films set in Paris Category:French films Category:French-language films ","title":"Le Péril jeune"},{"id":"4869382","title":"Marty Lyons"},{"id":"4869412","text":"The Mother, the Mechanic, and the Path is The Early November's second full- length album. The triple disc concept album was released on July 11, 2006 via Drive-Thru Records. Production The recording of the album began on February 28, 2005 and took over a year until its completion due to the nature of a triple disc record, stress, Enders changing the concept of the story several times mid-record, and ultimately the lack of focus which led to a mid- recording nervous breakdown. This forced the album's release to be postponed from its original June 2005 street date to July 2006. The third disc, The Path, was written by Enders and Jeff Kummer, and co-produced by Enders. According to an interview with Enders on Episode 17 of the Voice & Verse Podcast, there were multiple versions of the story that were recorded and considered. Though the first version to be submitted to Drive-Thru Records was not immediately accepted, the label was supportive and asked that some changes and additional work be done. In the end, it was Enders and those artistically involved with writing and presenting the story who ultimately re-worked the story and its presentation multiple times before it became the final product, despite rumors that Drive-Thru Records had turned down the story seven times for quality control issues before finally approving it. Enders also did the artwork for The Mother, the Mechanic and the Path, drawing up a father in a mechanics uniform named Matt, a mother and a son named Dean, for the cover and booklet. Recording took place at Portrait Recording Studios in Pompton Plains, New Jersey with Enders and Chris Badami producing the sessions. Badami also mixed and engineered the recordings. He was assisted by Michelle Dispenziere and Paul Spinella. Several people contributed to the recordings: David Rimelis (string and horn arrangements, nylon guitar and banjo), Arthur Fiacco (cello), Elizabeth Hostetter (viola), Andrea Schultz (violin), Angela Cordell (French horn), Richard Dispenziere (trumpet), Peter McGuinness (trombone), Kenny Sorenson (harmonica), Brian O'Neal (Roark) and Lynsie Crespo (background vocals), and Badami (piano and percussion). George Marino mastered The Mechanic disc and Greg Calbi mastered The Mother disc, both at Sterling Sound in New York City. Badami mastered The Path disc at Portrait Recording Studio. Music and lyrical content The concept album is broken down into three chapters: *The Mechanic – the proclaimed \\"rock\\" disc of the album, showcasing the heavier side of the band. According to singer/guitarist Ace Enders, The Mechanic is the group's \\"safe bet\\", the album they would have made if it had only been one disc. It represents the technical progression from its predecessor The Room's Too Cold (2003), hence the title. *The Mother – a mostly unplugged effort in the vein of The Early November's The Acoustic EP (2003) and Enders' solo CD I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business (2004). The disc focuses on the band's mellow facet, featuring a more natural sound, conveyed by the use of predominantly acoustic instruments and few effects or filters. *The Path – an audio theatre of sorts, which mixes dialogue between a young man named Dean and his psychiatrist with soft background music. The psychiatry sessions that narrate the story are interrupted by short \\"musical\\"-esque songs, also introducing the interaction of other characters. The songs cover a wide range of musical genres, including blues, country and folk. Release \\"A Little More Time\\" was premiered through AbsolutePunk on May 30, 2006. The Mother, the Mechanic, and the Path was released on July 11. Once released, Drive-Thru Records made an effort to boost record sales with various promotion campaigns, bonus offers and price discounts. During the first weeks of sales, purchases of The Mother, the Mechanic, and the Path from Best Buy were accompanied by a bonus DVD (containing the music video to \\"Hair\\" and a 35-minute making-of documentary), while Target customers were rewarded with an exclusive bonus track. In mid-September, the band went on a UK tour alongside the Starting Line and Anberlin. , the band has sold 78,669 copies of The Mother, the Mechanic, and the Path. In May 2014, the album was released on vinyl through TDR Records. Track listing All songs written by Ace Enders.

It also is used to deliver other malware to its host computers. Later versions include rootkits and ransomware. Infection A Vundo infection is typically caused either by opening an e-mail attachment carrying the trojan, or through a variety of browser exploits, including vulnerabilities in popular browser plug-ins, such as Java. Many of the popups advertise fraudulent programs such as AntiSpywareMaster, WinFixer, and AntiVirus 2009. \`Virtumonde.dll\` consists of two main components, Browser Helper Objects and Class ID. Each of these components is in the Windows Registry under HKEY LOCAL MACHINE, and the file names are dynamic. It attaches to the system using bogus Browser Helper Objects and DLL files attached to winlogon.exe, explorer.exe and more recently, lsass.exe. Vundo inserts registry entries to suppress Windows warnings about the disabling of firewall, antivirus, and the Automatic Updates service, disables the Automatic Updates service and quickly re-disables it if manually re-enabled, and attacks Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, Spybot Search & Destroy, Lavasoft Ad-Aware, HijackThis, and several other malware removal tools. It frequently hides itself from Vundofix and Combofix. Rather than pushing fake antivirus products, the new \\"ad\\" popups for the drive by download attacks are copies of ads by major corporations, faked so that simply closing them allows the drive-by download exploit to insert the payload into the user's computer. Symptoms Since there are many different varieties of Vundo trojans, symptoms of Vundo vary widely, ranging from the relatively benign to the severe. Almost all varieties of Vundo feature some sort of pop- up advertising as well as rooting themselves to make them difficult to delete. Computers infected exhibit some or all of the following symptoms: * Vundo will cause the infected web browser to pop up advertisements, many of which claim a need for software to fix system \\"deterioration\\". * The desktop background may be changed to the image of an installation window saying there is adware on the computer. * The screensaver may be changed to the Blue Screen of Death. * In the Display Properties Control Panel, the background and screensaver tabs are missing because their \\"Hide\\" values in the Registry were changed to 1. * Both the background and screensaver are in the System32 folder, however the screensaver cannot be deleted. * Windows Automatic Updates (and other web- based services) may also be disabled and it is not possible to turn them back on. * Infected DLLs or DAT files (with randomized names such as \\"__c00369AB.dat\\" and \\"slmnvnk.dll\\") will be present in the Windows/System32 folder and references to the DLLs will be found in the user's start up (viewable in MSConfig), registry, and as browser add-ons in Internet Explorer. * Vundo may attempt to prevent the user from removing it or otherwise impede its operation, such as by disabling the task manager, registry editor, and msconfig, thereby preventing the system from booting into safe mode. * Some firewalls or antivirus software may also be disabled by Vundo leaving the system even more vulnerable. Especially, it disables Norton AntiVirus and in turn uses it to spread the infection. Norton will show prompts to enable phishing filter, all by itself. Upon pressing OK, it will try to connect to real-av.org and download more malware. * Popular anti-malware programs such as Spybot – Search & Destroy or Malwarebytes may be deleted or immediately closed upon loading. Renaming the program executable can work around this. Malwarebytes's executable may be deleted as soon as it is installed (depending on the system's infection). Installing the program on another computer and copying the executable into the infected computer's Malwarebytes directory usually works too. * Web access may also be negatively affected. Vundo may cause many websites to be inaccessible. * Search engine links may be redirected to rogue security software sites, which can be avoided by copy and pasting addresses. * MS Juan may cause webpages to fail to load after sessions of browsing and present a blank page in the browser instead of the webpage. When this happens any programs may also fail to start and it may become impossible to use windows shutdown. * The hard drive may start to be constantly accessed by the winlogon.exe process, thus periodic freezes may be experienced. * Display pop-ups and also is additionally efficient in injecting promotions into search results.HowToFix - Trojan Vundo. * Warnings about SuperMWindow not shutting down may occur.SuperMWindow - A New Vundo. * Explorer.exe may constantly crash resulting in an endless loop of crashing then restarting. * Creates a virus critical driver in C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\drivers (ati0dgxx.sys). * The virus can \\"eat\\" away at available hard drive space; hard drive space can fluctuate so much as +3 to -3 Gb of space, evident of Vundo's attempt at \\"hiding\\" when being antagonized. * Vundo can impede download progress. * Entering safe mode after attempting to use HijackThis results in a true Blue Screen of Death, which cannot be recovered from without either restoring the deleted safe mode registry keys, or a reinstalled version of Windows. * The virus sometimes gives a \\"Run a DLL as an APP\\" error when some of the randomly named DLLs have been deleted. * The virus will rewrite randomly named DLLs while any of them reside on machine. * The virus changes \\\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run and RunOnce entries to start itself when Windows starts. * The virus installs adware that sometimes is pornographic. * The virus installs rogue security software such as Desktop Defender 2010 and Security Center with a .wav file telling the user that their system is infected. * The virus will cause the network driver to be corrupt which even after going into Registry Editor (regedit.exe) to delete Winsock 1 and 2 and trying to reinstall the driver is virtually impossible. * The virus deletes the network connection under My Network Places.

Previously, he worked eight years in the George W. Bush administration. After leaving the Bush administration, he was a lobbyist for energy companies. Within Facebook, Kaplan is seen as a strong conservative voice. He has helped place conservatives in key positions in the company, and advocated for the interests of the right-wing websites Breitbart News and The Daily Caller within the company. He has successfully advocated for changes in Facebook's algorithm to promote the interests of right-wing publications, and successfully prevented Facebook from closing down Facebook groups that circulate fake news, arguing that doing so would disproportionately target conservatives.  Early life and education  Kaplan was born in Weston, Massachusetts. He earned a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard University in 1991, after which he served as an Artillery Officer in the United States Marine Corps for four years. He then earned a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1998.  Career  After law school, he clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge J. Michael Luttig. He was an active conservative Democrat during the early-1990s. He registered as a Republican in the late-1990s.\\"Limelight Finds New White House Deputy\\", New York Times, 25 April 2006 = George W.

Bush administration (2001–2009) = From 2001 to 2003 he was special assistant to the president for policy within the White House Chief of Staff’s office. Then he served as deputy director of the Office of Management And Budget, serving under Joshua Bolten. While at the OMB, in 2006, Kaplan said the administration would cut the deficit by half by 2009. In April 2006 he returned to the White House as the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for policy, taking over policy planning duties from Karl Rove as part of a staff shake-up by White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten. Blake Gottesman was the other Deputy Chief of Staff and focused on operations. He was responsible for the development and implementation of the Administration’s policy agenda. While in the Bush administration, Kaplan was seen as very close to Bolten. =Private sector = Prior to joining Facebook, Kaplan was the executive vice president for public policy and external affairs for Energy Future Holdings (EFH), where he oversaw company-wide public affairs and led EFH’s efforts to \\"publicly demonstrate and communicate its role in the energy industry\\".  Facebook  In May 2011 Facebook hired Kaplan as its vice president of U.S. public policy, as part of a Facebook's effort to \\"strengthen\\" the company's ties to Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill. In October 2014, Kaplan succeeded Marne Levine as Facebook's vice president of global public policy. Within the company, Kaplan advocated against restrictions on racially incendiary speech. He played an important role in crafting an exception for newsworthy political discourse when deciding on whether content violated the community guidelines. During the 2016 election, Kaplan advocated against closing down Facebook groups which peddled fake news. Kaplan argued that getting rid of the groups would have disproportionately targeted conservatives. In 2017, after Facebook had implemented changes to its algorithm to expose users to more content by family and friends and less by publishers who engage in misinformation, Kaplan questioned whether the algorithm disproportionately hurt conservative publishers and successfully advocated for Facebook to change the algorithm again. He pushed against a proposed Facebook project that was intended to make Facebook users of different political views engage with each other in less hostile ways. Kaplan argued that this feature would lead conservatives to accuse Facebook of bias. Kaplan also reportedly advocated on behalf of Breitbart News and the Daily Caller within Facebook. Kaplan has helped to place conservatives in key positions in the leadership of Facebook. In 2018, he advocated strongly for the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. Kaplan sat behind Kavanaugh during his Senate confirmation hearings. Personal life On April 8, 2006, Kaplan married Laura Cox Kaplan (formerly Laura Lyn Cox) in Washington, D.C.

The genus was described from a skull discovered in an exposure of the Arcadia Park Shale (lower Middle Turonian) at Cedar Hill, Dallas County in south-central Texas, United States. The skull (SMU 73056, Shuler Museum of Paleontology, Southern Methodist University) was found in 1992 by a member of the Dallas Paleontological Society, who then donated to the museum. Other fragmentary specimens of Russelosaurus have been recovered from the slightly older Kamp Ranch Limestone at two other localities in the Dallas area. Etymology The type species, R. coheni, was named for the amateur fossil collector who discovered SMU 73056, and the genus name honours paleontologist Dale A. Russell for his extensive work on mosasaurs (\\"Russell's lizard\\"). This is the second species of mosasaur to have been named for Russell, the first being Selmasaurus russelli (Wright and Shannon, 1988). The type specimen of Russellosaurus is notable as being the oldest well-preserved mosasaur yet found in North America. Appearance Polcyn et. Bell (2005, p. 323) diagnose Russellosaurus as follows: \\"Small, lightly built mosasaur, frontal narrow with a length to width ratio of 1.6:1. Sixteen maxillary teeth and 16 dentary teeth. Anterior premaxilla broad and blunt, in dorsal view the premaxillary-maxillary suture is oblique. The ectopterygoid is lightly built and composed of a distinct small subrectangular pterygoid process and a slender rod-like jugal process. Incipient emargination of the frontal by the external nares. A pair of foramina separated by a thin median septum in the floor of the basioccipital are interpreted as the entrance of the basilar artery, and exit the ventral surface of the basioccipital as multiple small and anteriorly placed foramina. Extreme downgrowth of the pterygoid processes of the basisphenoid. Lightly built postorbitofrontal processes. The pineal foramen is located in the centre of the triangular parietal table. The supraoccipital loose cartilaginous contact with parietal. Median cleft in posterior parietal margin in dorsoventral aspect.\\" Species Polcyn et Bell (2005, p. 322) designated Russellosaurus the type genus of a new parafamily of mosasaurs, the Russellosaurina (= subfamily Russellosaurinae of Bell, 1997). This clade of marine lizards is defined as all mosasaurs more closely related to the subfamilies Tylosaurinae and Plioplatecarpinae and their sister group, consisting of the taxa Tethysaurus, Yaguarasaurus, and Russellosaurus, their common ancestor and all descendants than to the subfamily Mosasaurinae. The skull of Russelosaurus shows many characters diagnostic of the Plioplatecarpinae while retaining many plesiomorphic traits. Cladistic analysis indicates a close relationship between Russellosaurus and Yaguarasaurus columbianus, a primitive South American mosasaur from the Turonian of Colombia. Together with Tethysaurus nopcsai, another early mosasauroid from the Turonian of Morocco, these genera are believed to constitute a clade \\"basal to the divergence\\" of the subfamilies Plioplatecarpinae and Tylosaurinae. Based on the lack of fusion between elements of the basicarnium and a high degree of vascularization of the bone surface, which suggests the animal was undergoing a rapid growth stage when it died, the holotype skull of Russellosaurus coheni is believed to have come from a subadult individual. An even more primitive mosasaur, Dallasaurus turneri, was recovered from the same Cedar Hill locality as this specimen. Sources *Bell, G. L. Jr., 1997.

Based on the Greek mythological figure of the same name, he is the Greek god of war and a major adversary of the superhero Wonder Woman and the Justice League. The character has appeared in various forms of media. Alfred Molina voiced him in the 2009 direct-to-video animated movie Wonder Woman. Ares later made his live-action debut hiding under the alias of Sir Patrick Morgan in the 2017 film Wonder Woman, set in the DC Extended Universe, where he was portrayed by English actor David Thewlis. Thewlis made a small cameo as Ares in a flashback scene in the film Justice League. Publication history =Pre-Crisis= Ares first appeared in Wonder Woman #1, volume 1, published in the summer of 1942, written and created by Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston. In the next issue,Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #2 he reappeared under his Roman name, Mars. =Post-Crisis= He retained this name until February 1987,Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #1 when comics writer/artist George Pérez restored the Greek name Ares as part of his reboot of the Wonder Woman mythos. As the narrative continuity of Wonder Woman comics has been adjusted by different writers throughout the years, various versions of Mars/Ares, with various personalities and physical appearances, have been presented, though most have been depicted wearing Greek hoplite or Roman gladiator armor. The character's longest-running look, designed by George Pérez, is that of a red-eyed Greek warrior clad in black and indigo battle armor, face hidden by an Attic helmet. =The New 52= After DC's continuity was again rebooted in 2011 (an event known as the New 52), the character cycled through several divergent visual interpretations before returning to his Pérez-inspired warrior design.Wonder Woman (vol. 5) #12 In September 2011, the conclusion of the limited series Flashpoint (2011) established a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to a younger age and earlier stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue #1, \\"our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approach—not only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters.\\" Following this company-wide relaunch, Ares appeared in a new Wonder Woman volume. In this new timeline, Ares closely resembles the then- ongoing series writer Brian Azzarello, as originally intended by the artist Cliff Chiang. As the team was preparing the series, Azzarello requested \\"a tired, old guy\\" for the initial design of Ares. Chiang responded with a sketch of Azzarello's own look as a joke, to which Azzarello reportedly responded, \\"Cool\\". Other than hollowed eyes and bloodied legs, Ares is characterized by Azzarello's own bald head, long beard, and slender look. =DC Rebirth= Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= During most of the Golden Age, Silver Age, and Bronze Age, Ares was called Mars and was one of the most recurrent enemies of Wonder Woman. He was depicted as a Greco-Roman warrior in orange armor. Ares, who eventually became known as Mars, sought to realize his vision of eternal war and conflict in the world of man. He was chiefly opposed by Aphrodite, goddess of love, who sought to realize a contrary vision of loving civilization. Meanwhile, the men who worshipped Ares killed each other and their weaker brothers, selling women cheaper than cattle. When Ares taunted Aphrodite with the success of his plans, Aphrodite created a new race of women, the Amazons, whom she modeled from clay, who built a city-state called Amazonia, where they created a women-centered civilization for spreading the gospel of Aphrodite's Way. They were stronger than Ares's men. Hippolyta was granted a golden girdle that made her invincible.Wonder Woman (vol. 1) #1. DC Comics. When she arrives in Man's World and leaves Steve Trevor in a hospital, Wonder Woman accidentally drops a manuscript depicting Ares, Aphrodite, and the history of the Amazons. From Wonder Woman #1 Mars eventually created a home base on the planet of Mars, with its superpowerful population enslaved to serve him and his chief deputies, the Duke of Deception, Lord Conquest, and the Earl of Greed. Mars's aid-de-camp is General Destruction. He used Mars as an interplanetary headquarters, supplementing the enslaved Martian population with the spirits of the dead he collected from war zones on multiple planets, including Saturn and Earth. Slave spirits became embodied after being ferried to the planet Mars, where they were subjected to strength tests to determine how they would best be used, whether as gladiators in slave games, personal slaves in the retinue of Mars himself, or employees in the War Factories, one of which included the Lie Factory run by the Duke of Deception. The very strongest would be trained and given new bodies to be sent to wage future wars on earth. He also set up the Injustice Court for humiliating slaves and meting out punishments. Mars's Earth base was beneath Mount Olympus and run by Lord Conquest. From this base, he sought to defeat the Allied cause in World War II, sending thoughts of conquest, deception, and greed into the Axis leaders with the use of astral projection, but he found himself repeatedly thwarted by the Amazon champion Wonder Woman. When Wonder Woman rescued Steve Trevor from Mars, the War God ordered his three lieutenants to capture her. The Earl of Greed was sent and enlisted German aid, along with convincing the Dean of Holiday College to rob it, but failed and was imprisoned. The Duke of Deception gained Japanese help and captured Wonder Woman, but failed, as she escaped before she left Earth and he was imprisoned. The Count of Conquest gained Italian help and by trickery succeeded in shackling Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor and bringing them to Mars. Greed and Deception were released while Wonder Woman was imprisoned in the dungeons. However, with the help of Etta Candy's spirit form, Wonder Woman was able to escape and overpower Mars, whose Iron Palace was destroyed by his weapons, though he survived. The Duke of Deception tried many times to defeat Wonder Woman, but failed despite his cunning and incredible technology, and Mars finally stripped him of his mighty appearance, showing him to be a weak, toothless man. The Duke, after being set with the female slaves, caused them to rebel and briefly ruled Mars. Mars repeatedly tangled with Wonder Woman on Earth-One and Earth-Two. During a period when Diana abandoned her powers to live among the world of men, as the Amazons retreated temporarily to another dimension, Mars (calling himself Ares this time) and his children Phobos, Deimos, and Eris battled the Amazons to secure from Hippolyta the secret to domination of all dimensions of existence. Later, he enlisted his descendant Helen Alexandros to become the Silver Swan. His final scheme before the history-changing battle of the Crisis on Infinite Earths was to ally himself with Hades and the Anti-Monitor to subdue the Gods of Olympus. As Wonder Woman engaged him in final battle, Steve Trevor freed the gods and Hades's wife Kore appealed to her husband with a message of love, leaving Mars isolated. =Post-Crisis= Ares as Ares Buchanan Despite being Zeus's son, Ares never fit in with the other gods of Olympus and created his own realm, the Areopagus. Aphrodite, the patron of the Amazons, swore that her women would save the world with love from the hatred and warfare of Ares, meaning he opposed their creation. Recently, through his deceit and manipulations, Ares deposed Hades and became ruler of the underworld. Ares did his best to destroy the Amazons, using Hercules against them, who sacked the island, but Diana was born and raised just in time to fight Ares as Steve Trevor's plane, driven by one of Ares's human puppets, crashed into Paradise Island. His plot was to fire the missiles between the United States and Russia at the same time, provoking World War III, but Diana managed to make him see, trapped in her magic lasso, how this chaos would lead to his own disappearing, with Ares having no one to worship him. He then gave her the task of \\"saving mankind from themselves\\", promising to return if she fails, essentially acting as a continuous test of her success. Although Ares abandoned his plans that time, he managed to possess an unimportant criminal, Ari Buchanan. Possessing his body, he changed his name to \\"Ares Buchanan\\".Wonder Woman (vol. 2) #78–84. DC Comics. He began climbing the business ladder by providing high-tech weapons for gang wars. As Buchanan, he had a relationship with his lawyer Donna Milton (who was Circe in disguise, although not even she knew it then), conceiving a daughter named Lyta Milton. Lyta has been shown to possess a great amount of magic, which she is still practicing. However, Ares did not care much about Donna, shooting her while she was pregnant. Circe, as Donna, later tried to help Diana out of a trap he laid. She used the last of her forces to shoot a gun, which produced a sort of mini-black hole and absorbed Ares into it. Diana, the child, and she survived. As opposed to ancient times, the roles of various gods were shown to have altered somewhat according to modern practices and beliefs. Because of this, the actual faith-based power Ares's father Zeus received proved to be very much diminished. However, other gods such as Athena, Aphrodite, and Ares began to gain more power due to the appearance of the computer age, love never diminishing, and conflict remaining consistent. Thus, the three godly siblings eventually took over Olympus as the godly home's new masters. Realizing that conflict proved to maintain his strength over the output of war, Ares changed his title to the God of Conflict. To celebrate this change, he altered his appearance to a more approachable visage. His rule under this name proved to be short-lived, though, as the god Hades was also overthrown and Ares was all too eager to take up the mantle of God of the Dead. Family reunited Realizing that a crossroads for the gods of Olympus was at hand, Ares confided in his half sister Cassie Sandsmark about a future war. In exchange for additional powers, the only wish he requested in return from his sister was her love. He then traveled to Themyscira and kidnapped his daughter Lyta, who was under the protection of the Amazons. Discovering this fact, Circe confronted Ares and was surprised to learn of his new godly title. She agreed to remain as his consort and to raise their daughter Lyta in the Underworld. During Ares's family bonding with Cassie, he blessed her with a powerful lasso able to expel Zeus's lightning in times of anger for her to use in her persona as Wonder Girl. Ares has since appeared to Cassie repeatedly to warn her about \\"the coming war.\\" In one story, the Teen Titans were thrown 10 years into the future, where Cassie had inherited the mantle of Wonder Woman after Diana's death.Teen Titans (v3) #17–19. DC Comics. She was also referred to as \\"Ares's champion\\". Ares later appeared to Cassie, informing her that the gods were leaving this plane and Zeus was taking the power he had granted Cassie, as well.Teen Titans #33 In exchange for acknowledging their siblinghood and becoming his champion, he offered her some of his power, saying only that she would be \\"more powerful than [she has] ever been.\\" The full extent of Cassie's powers has not been revealed, though some indication exists that she has retained all of her former powers at this point.Infinite Crisis #6 and Teen Titans #34. DC Comics. During the events of Amazons Attack!, it is discovered that Ares left Circe and kidnapped their daughter to raise on his own. As Lyta and he were only spoken of during the storyline, their presence is yet unknown. Cassie is confronted by Ares's son, Lord Lycus, whom Ares has sent to interfere with Cassie's powers.Teen Titans #63. DC Comics. Death Wonder Woman fatally attacks Ares Shifting himself into the future, Ares stole the dead body of Wonder Woman and brought it back into the present. He then manipulated several villains to use the body to create his bride and chief agent Genocide. He then imbued this new creature with his own magical dominance, causing the new being's persona to be not only more deadly, but also completely obedient to him. Ares's plans to destroy the present-day Wonder Woman went awry when Diana was able to destroy Genocide, leaving the monster's dead body to drown in the ocean. Angered, Ares commanded a son of Poseidon to cause a swarm of deadly sea creatures to attack Themyscira and the new island nation of Thalarion. During this battle, Diana deduced that Ares was the grand manipulator and confronted him. Not allowing Ares much time to gloat in his latest masterpiece of war, Diana took a battle axe and used it to strike Ares's head, splitting his helmet in two. After death Despite being gone from the mortal world, Ares is still manipulating events to destroy the Amazons. His next plot involves the birth of five male children by five random Amazons. Once they are born, he takes them under his wing before Ares is banished from Themyscira both in body and spirit by his father Zeus.Wonder Woman (vol. 3) #39. DC Comics. =The New 52: Wonder Woman (2011–2016)= Ares's appearance in The New 52 continuity: Panel from Wonder Woman #4 (2012). Art by Cliff Chiang In The New 52 continuity, Ares is commonly referred to as War. His first appearance in this new continuity was in Wonder Woman #4, where he is depicted as a bald, aged man with a white beard. Due to the revelation that Diana is the demigod daughter of Zeus, their new dynamic is that of brother and sister. War's calves and feet are permanently smeared with blood. He appears in a bar in Darfur, where his brother Apollo tries to convince him to side with him in his quest to take over the rein of Olympus. His attitude also seems to be more pessimistic and uncaring. He is revealed to be Diana's former mentor in Wonder Woman #0, a stand-alone issue published in September 2012 set in the past. He takes Diana under his tutelage because of her vast potential in combat, and teaches her the ways of the warrior. Their relationship is like a father- daughter relationship. However, they part ways when Diana is asked by Ares to slay the Minotaur, but is unable to bring herself to kill it. This show of mercy makes her a failure in Ares's eyes. Over time, Diana learns she can trust Ares to protect their youngest brother, the infant Zeke, and his mother Zola. Alongside their British brother Lennox, Hera, and the New God Orion, they form a dysfunctional family unit that seeks to protect the baby from First Born, their eldest brother, who had been imprisoned by Zeus aeons ago. In Wonder Woman #23, Wonder Woman's group clashes with First Born in London, where Ares raises an army of soldiers and fights First Born himself after Wonder Woman is temporarily incapacitated. First Born manages to overpower Ares and prepares to kill him to usurp his position of God of War. Seizing her opportunity, Wonder Woman regretfully drives a spear through both of them, as it is the only way to stop First Born. In his last breath, Ares forgives and commends his former pupil, stating that she did what he would have done. Hades manifests to take Ares to his afterlife, and announces that Wonder Woman has taken on his position as God of War.Wonder Woman #23 (2013). DC Comics. Appearing to Wonder Woman in an apparition, counselling her on the ongoing conflict with the First Born, he tells her not to call him War anymore, as that is her name—she refers to him instead as Ares.Wonder Woman #34 (2014) =DC Rebirth: Wonder Woman (2016–present)= In the DC Rebirth reboot, Wonder Woman's origin is retold in the \\"Year One\\" storyline. A group of people called the \\"Sear\\" terrorizes a mall where Diana and her friends are exploring. They have been infected with the Maru virus, which causes them to lash out in homicidal rage, though Diana and Steve Trevor are able to defeat them, and Barbara Ann Minerva discovers Sear is an anagram of Ares. The god of war attacks shortly after this discovery. He reveals his desire to spread the virus across the world in major locations with the hope of turning most of the human population into warring killers to fuel his power. Diana offers him Themyscira's location in exchange for him sparing everyone, though Ares discovers she has no memory of its location; as a sacrifice of leaving the island, Diana was barred from returning by losing knowledge of how to return. Accepting her new role to save mankind, Diana, with the help of the patron gods in animal form, subdues Ares with the Lasso of Truth. Diana and her friends are given the locations where Ares has the virus sent and Diana is christened as Wonder Woman for her heroics. Soon after, Ares's sons Deimos and Phobos conspired to free Ares from his imprisonment on Themyscira. They coerced Veronica Cale into aiding them by kidnapping the soul of her daughter, Isadore. However, several years later, Cale and her associate Doctor Cyber still had no luck finding the island. Meanwhile, Cale was plotting against Deimos and Phobos, and recruited the sorceress Circe into trapping the twins into the bodies of two Doberman Pinschers.Wonder Woman #20 (2017) Years later, the mysterious tree that had been growing on Themyscira was teleported to the false island that Wonder Woman had originally thought was her home. During a battle with Cheetah, a drop of Wonder Woman's blood opened a portal to inside the tree. There, Wonder Woman and Veronica Cale encountered both Isadore Cale and an attractive, nude man who introduced himself as Ares.Wonder Woman #21 (2017) Diana had not faced Ares in Year One, but his sons in disguise. Themyscira serves as Ares's prison once he was calmed of his bloodlust with the love of his lover Aphrodite, and Deimos and Phobos plotted to gain access to kill their father and take his role, gaining his power. The gods altered Diana's memories to make her think she had returned to the island so that she could never try to find the real Themyscira, thereby granting access to darker forces. Isadore became his ward in the meantime. He gives her the clue to how to defeat his sons: with love, not hatred. Once his sons have been defeated and bound by the Lasso of Truth, Ares reveals Isadore cannot leave without being split from her physical and astral forms. She can live with the Amazons, however, and thus have a life where she will not age.Wonder Woman #23 (2017) Later, Darkseid's daughter Grail was imprisoned in the tree with Ares.Wonder Woman #45 (2018) Ares, inspired by the hope of justice, manipulated Grail into killing him with the Godkiller sword. This freed him of his imprisonment. Soon after, Wonder Woman encountered Ares, this time resembling the missing Steve Trevor, on a battlefield in Durkovia.Wonder Woman #58 (2018) Powers and abilities As do all Olympian gods, Ares possesses tremendous strength, though he is now perhaps the strongest of them, rivaled only by his half- brother Hercules. Moreover, he is a master of conflict and strategy with centuries of experience in the field, and has complete telekinetic command and mastery over any weapon or armor. He also possesses speed equal to that of Hermes once he absorbs massive amounts of the violent energies that give him his powers. Pertaining to his being a war god, violent actions and emotions such as anger, hate, death and bloodshed make him stronger and heals any wounds he may receive as his soul is able to absorb the psychic energy created by such events. His armor is virtually indestructible and his weapons are greater than mortal ones. He can shapeshift into any form he wishes and can teleport himself and others. At one time, he was also recognized as the Death God of the Greek Pantheon, having control over the dead and able to resurrect and command a whole army of undead from the Underworld to do his will, and then, send them back whenever he wished. Being a god, he is also immortal and cannot be harmed by mortal weapons, only magical ones. In The New 52 continuity, the character's mere presence invokes battle and slaughter in his surroundings. This is seen in Wonder Woman #4, where Ares is sitting in a bar in Darfur; all the men inside are dead and a riot is breaking out outside the bar- even children are taking part in the gunfire. In Wonder Woman #9, Ares is present at a cafe in Damascus, where a fatal blast takes place as he is leaving. Other versions =Wonder Woman: Earth One= In the Wonder Woman: Earth One continuity, Armored Response Environment Suit called A. R. E. S. is featured in Volume Two as a US military contingency plan for General Phil Darnell and Maxwell Lord. Ares himself is hinted at the end of the book as well. Wonder Woman Earth One: Volume 2 =Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman= Ares appears in two different stories in this anthology series featuring Wonder Woman. In the first, \\"Casualties of War,\\" Wonder Woman is attacked by a dragon that is later revealed to have been a pawn of Ares.Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman #28 In the second story, \\"Vendetta,\\" Ares ambushes Wonder Woman in a small, African city. He summons his Spartoi, reptilian soldiers, to aid in his battle, but he is inevitably defeated by Wonder Woman.Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman #33-35 =The Legend of Wonder Woman= While not appearing directly, Ares's subject, the Duke of Deception, is a servant of both Ares and Hades. The amazon Antiope is also depicted as Ares's high priestess.The Legend of Wonder Woman #5 =Injustice: Gods Among Us= Ares is featured as a major antagonist in the series based on the video game of the same name. He is initially in the Chapter 9 of Year 1, on which he watches as Wonder Woman fought against an entire army and then questions her decision to join Superman's side. He also asks her if she is going to \\"replace\\" Lois Lane, who died after the Joker tricked Superman into killing her, as Superman's significant other. Just as he asks this, Wonder Woman acknowledges he fears her union with Superman because it would end all conflict in the world and end war permanently (and without war, Ares would be left mortal). She asks Ares what he would become if Superman's endeavors succeeded and mockingly suggests he become a god of something less violent (as she suggested him being the \\"God of Ponies\\"). Enraged, Ares attacks Diana, proclaiming that Zeus himself would not save her so long as they are on a battlefield where Ares is strongest. Before he can harm Wonder Woman, Superman appears and takes Ares down with a single blow, allowing Diana to cut off his hand off and, just as Ares threatens her further, she impales him with her sword and leaves him to bleed. Superman, while disturbed by this, is assured by Wonder Woman that Ares will not die and the two head off to begin peace negotiations. As they leave, Ares admits to himself he fears that Diana will strip away Superman's restraint, and nothing in the world would be able to stand against them if such an event occurred, and in a world without war, Ares is unsure what he would become. =Dark Nights= In Dark Knights: The Merciless, part of a series looking at dark alternate versions of Batman who have the powers of other members of the Justice League, one Batman comes from a reality where Ares acquired a new helmet that enhanced his powers to induce conflict. After Wonder Woman and other members of the League had been apparently killed in battle with Ares, Batman donned Ares' discarded helmet to use it against him, only to succumb to the helmet's power, to the point that he not only defeated Ares, but even killed Diana when it was revealed that she had survived the attack because he was already so far under the helmet's influence.Batman: The Merciless In other media =Television= Ares in Justice League Unlimited * Ares makes an appearance in the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Hawk and Dove\\", voiced by Michael York. In the episode, Ares commissions Hephaestus to forge the Annihilator, a living suit of armor fueled by violence. Posing as Tom Sera and a Kasnian Monk, Ares uses it to incite conflict between North and South Kasnia, hoping to destabilize the entire region and create more conflict. Wonder Woman and Hawk and Dove intervene, forcing Ares to back down after discovering the Annihilator's weakness. The Annihilator armor is confiscated by the Justice League. * Ares appears in the web series, DC Super Hero Girls, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. * Ares appears in Harley Quinn as an exotic dancer on Hedonikka, an island near Themyscira. =Film= * Ares is featured in the animated feature film Wonder Woman, voiced by Alfred Molina. He differs slightly in this incarnation in that he had long platinum hair, although he wears a variation of his classic armor early in the film. * Ares first appears in the DC Extended Universe film Wonder Woman, the fourth installment of the DCEU, played by David Thewlis. As the God of War, he is depicted as the treacherous son of Zeus and the half-brother of Diana/Wonder Woman. After Ares corrupted mankind and slaughtered all of his fellow Gods, Zeus used the last of his strength to strike Ares down from Olympus and left the Amazons a \\"Godkiller\\" sword capable of slaying Ares should he ever return. Stranded on Earth, Ares spent centuries orchestrating wars and conflicts in order to maintain his power. During World War I, he masquerades as Imperial War Cabinet speaker \\"Sir Patrick Morgan\\" to manipulate both sides into entering conflicts. After revealing himself to Diana, Ares destroys the sword and informs her that she is the true \\"Godkiller\\" that Zeus left behind, before attempting to persuade her that humans are unworthy of her protection and should be destroyed in order to create paradise on Earth. Having concluded that love, not violence, is the only way to prevent conflict, Diana uses her powers as the last child of Zeus to fight and ultimately destroy Ares. * Ares is featured in the 2017 film Justice League, the fifth instalment of the DCEU. He appears during a flashback of the battle between Steppenwolf's forces and a unified army of the Olympian Gods, Amazons, Atlanteans, Green Lanterns, and mankind.

Hertzler. At the beginning of the game, Ares was seen fighting the Justice League alongside the featured villains assembled by Lex Luthor until he was defeated by Superman and corralled by Wonder Woman and Aquaman. In the alternate reality, Ares first appears to save Aquaman from the alternate Aquaman's army by freezing them in time. The alternate Ares tells Aquaman that Superman's Regime has ended all conflict leaving him virtually weak. The alternate Ares sends Aquaman to the Insurgency base where his comrades are. Later on in the game, the alternate Ares teleports Wonder Woman to Themyscira where he tells her that her alternate counterpart is planning to lead the Amazons to civilization as part of the alternate Superman's plan to destroy Metropolis and Gotham City. The alternate Ares then leaves when Wonder Woman is attacked by the alternate Raven. In Ares' Arcade ending, defeating Superman has the opposite effect of what he intended and he is further weakened by the ensuing peace. Near death, Ares imprisons Brainiac 5 and forces him to create a time loop of the game's events creating a never ending cycle of conflict from which he can feed off forever. ** He doesn't appear in the sequel, Injustice 2, however, as Wonder Woman claims she slew him and became the new goddess of war. * Ares appears in DC Universe Online. * In Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure, the New 52 version of Ares is one of the thousands of characters that can be summoned by the player. * Ares appears as a playable character in the mobile game DC Legends. * Ares appears as a playable character in DC Unchained. * Ares appears as a playable character in Lego DC Super-Villains, voiced by Fred Tatasciore. =Toys= DC Direct released an Ares action figure in 2001 as part of their Amazons and Adversaries line of Wonder Woman action figures.

He started working on the composition in 1903, but left it incomplete when he died in 1915. Scriabin planned that the work would be synesthetic, exploiting the senses of smell and touch as well as hearing. He wrote that :\\"There will not be a single spectator. All will be participants. The work requires special people, special artists and a completely new culture. The cast of performers includes an orchestra, a large mixed choir, an instrument with visual effects, dancers, a procession, incense, and rhythmic textural articulation. The cathedral in which it will take place will not be of one single type of stone but will continually change with the atmosphere and motion of the Mysterium. This will be done with the aid of mists and lights, which will modify the architectural contours.\\" Scriabin intended the performance to be in the foothills of the Himalayas in India, a week-long event that would be followed by the end of the world and the replacement of the human race with \\"nobler beings\\". At the time of his death, Scriabin had sketched 72 pages of a prelude to the Mysterium, entitled Prefatory Action. Alexander Nemtin spent 28 years reforming this sketch into a three-hour-long work, \\"Preparation for the Final Mystery\\" in 3 parts: Part 1 \\"Universe\\", Part 2 \\"Mankind\\", and Part 3 \\"Transfiguration\\". Part 1 was recorded in 1973, conducted by Kiril Kondrashin, released LP 1973; in1996 Vladimir Ashkenazy recorded all 3 parts with Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin.  In popular culture  Scriabin's Mysterium is depicted in Issue 3 of the graphic novel trilogy Suffrajitsu: Mrs. Pankhurst's Amazons (2015). The Black Tapes podcast (2015 – 2017) uses Scriabin's Mysterium as a potential example of someone trying to access supernatural forces.

In the mid-1960s, as the British Invasion was at its height in the United States, Uruguayan bands began a similar rise to fame in Argentina. Record labels began rapidly signing Uruguayan rock bands to promote in Argentina. Argentine television shows like Escala Musical were also a springboard for many of the bands' popularity. Like the British Invasion, the Uruguayan Invasion had died down by the late 1960s, as it became more popular to record harder-hitting Spanish-language music. Spurred on by the band Los Gatos's 1967 hit record \\"La Balsa\\", most bands began to record in Spanish.

A leading pioneer and a skilled lawyer, Sanders played a prominent role in the development of Montana Territory and the state's early political history. Early life Sanders was born in Leon, Cattaraugus County, New York, to Ira and Freedom (Edgerton) Sanders. His father was a farmer originally from Rhode Island, and his mother a native of Connecticut. Being a devout Methodist, Ira Sanders named his firstborn son after a hero of his faith, the founding president of Wesleyan University, Willbur Fisk (the name was often misspelled by his contemporaries with one \\"l,\\" instead of two). Family stories tell of a precocious child displaying a keen intellect and studious character. Wilbur attended the common schools in New York and afterward taught school himself. Following his mother's wishes, Sanders moved to Akron, Ohio, in 1854, where he continued teaching and studied law under his uncle, Sidney Edgerton. His Uncle Sidney, 16 years his elder, exercised a profound impact on his life. Also born in western New York, Edgerton had moved to Akron ten years earlier and rose to prominence under the tutelage of the veteran Ohio politician and lawyer Rufus P. Spalding. Edgerton likewise took Sanders under his wing. Sanders gained admission to the bar in 1856, and he and Edgerton soon entered a law partnership. Edgerton had become involved with the Free Soil Party in the 1840s, and by the mid-1850s, around the time Sanders joined him in Akron when his political activities had shifted to the fledgling Republican Party. Sanders followed his uncle's political development. On October 27, 1858, Sanders married Harriet P. Fenn, a native of Ohio. They had five children, but only three survived into adulthood: James, Wilbur E., and Louis. Civil War During the Civil War, he recruited a company of infantry and a battery of artillery in the summer of 1861 and was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 64th Regiment, Ohio Infantry, of which he was made adjutant. Sanders served in the Battle of Shiloh, and later in 1862, he assisted in the construction of defenses along the railroads south of Nashville. His family reported that he resigned from the army in August 1862 following an illness aggravated by a wound. He returned to his family in Akron, Ohio. Montana Territory He settled in that part of Idaho Territory, which later became Montana, where he engaged in the practice of law and also became interested in mining and stock raising. He was a young lawyer when he moved to Montana (BannackMontana's State Capitol: The People's House - Kirby Lambert, Patricia Mullan Burnham, Susan R. Near p.82? (archive)) in 1863. He was there before courts were organized and, being one of the first permanent settlers, took a prominent part in bringing law and order to Montana. He was a prosecutor for the infamous Montana Vigilantes who took the law into their own hands after over one hundred men had been ambushed and murdered for their gold in Virginia City, Montana. In December 1863, Sanders led the prosecution of George Ives as the murderer of Nicolas Tiebolt in Nevada City, Montana. Ives was convicted and hanged on December 21, 1863. The George Ives trial initiated a period of vigilantism that eventually brought an end to thefts and murders by \\"road agents\\" in the Virginia City region. Sanders was one of the five original organizers of the Alder Gulch Vigilance Committee, which was formed on December 23, 1863 in Virginia City, Montana. In 1873, Sanders became a member of the Territorial Legislature. Also, he realized the importance of preserving early records and was for thirty years the president of the Montana Historical Society, established in 1865. He accumulated newspapers and documents in his law office. Sanders was a founding member of the Society of Montana Pioneers and served as its secretary (1884) and president (1888). He was a Republican candidate for election in 1864, 1867, 1880, and 1886 as a United States Representative and was a member of the Territorial House of Representatives of Montana from 1873 to 1879. Upon the admission of Montana as a State into the Union, he was elected as a Republican to the US Senate and served from January 1, 1890, to March 3, 1893. While in the Senate, he was the chairman of the Committee on Enrolled Bills in the Fifty-second Congress. In the 1890s, Sanders represented the Chinese community in Butte, Montana, against labor unions boycotting Chinese businesses.Brian Shovers. \\"Butte, Montana\\" Encyclopedia of Immigration and Migration in the American West. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications, 2006. Credo Reference. Web. 3 September 2014 Sanders died in Helena, Montana, at 71, and was interred in Forestvale Cemetery there.

The facility opened in March 1995 as a replacement for a since-demolished 1950s era station. The new station, designed by Legat Architects of Waukegan, cost approximately $3 million and was funded from a number of sources, including Metra, the Illinois Department of Transportation, Amtrak and the village of Glenview.Great American Stations. Accessed March 21, 2013. On Metra, the station is located on the Milwaukee District North Line that runs between Chicago Union Station and Fox Lake, Illinois. On Amtrak, the station is located on two lines, the Hiawatha that runs between Chicago Union Station and Milwaukee, Wisconsin and the Empire Builder that operates between Chicago, Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon. It also served the short-lived Lake Country Limited which ran between Chicago and Janesville, Wisconsin between April 15, 2000, and September 23, 2001. Frequent, daily service is provided on both the Milwaukee District North Line and the Hiawatha, while the Empire Builder provides once- a-day service. Normally, passengers traveling between Glenview and Chicago or Glenview and Milwaukee are not permitted to board or disembark on the Empire Builder at Glenview, due to the availability of the more frequent Metra and Amtrak Hiawatha routes. However, for much of the spring of 2020, the Empire Builder allowed local travel between Glenview and Milwaukee when the Hiawatha was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is proposed that the Amtrak service would shift one stop north to North Glenview. This move would eliminate lengthy stops which block traffic on Glenview Road. This move would involve reconstruction of the North Glenview station to handle the additional traffic, and depends on commitments from Glenview, the Illinois General Assembly and Metra.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Florida Marlins, New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles. Career Paulino with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2007 =Pittsburgh Pirates: 1997–2008= Paulino signed as a non-drafted free agent with the Pittsburgh Pirates organization on December 29, 1997, at the age of 16. In 2002, he was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the Rule 5 draft, but he was returned to the Pirates in spring training of the following year. After making his major league debut in September 2005 with the Pirates, Paulino was selected to the Dominican Republic team for the 2006 World Baseball Classic as a backup catcher. The highlight of the World Baseball Classic for Paulino came on March 13, when Paulino started at catcher against the Cuban team. Paulino went 2–2 with a double, three walks, and a run scored in the Dominican's triumph over Cuba. On April 16, 2006, Paulino was recalled to the Major Leagues and quickly became the Pirates every day catcher. Eventually he was again demoted to Triple-A Indianapolis, as management would give Ryan Doumit the bulk of playing time behind the plate with the Pittsburgh Pirates. Paulino was praised by the Pirates pitching staff as an excellent catcher to work with. The staff earned run average (ERA) was markedly better when Paulino was behind the plate. His .310 batting average made him the first rookie catcher since Mike Piazza to play in at least 100 games and bat at least .310. He is only the second rookie catcher since 1969 to have those numbers. =Florida Marlins: 2009–10= On December 10, 2008, Paulino was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for minor league catcher Jason Jaramillo. He was then traded to the San Francisco Giants on March 27, 2009 for pitcher Jack Taschner. Two hours later he was traded to the Florida Marlins for pitcher Hector Correa. With the Marlins, Pauline platooned with left-handed hitting catcher John Baker. After Baker suffered a season-ending injury in May 2010, Paulino took over starting duties for the majority of the season. On August 20, 2010, Paulino received a 50-game suspension for violation of baseball's drug policy. Paulino claimed the positive test was a result of a dietary pill. Paulino during the Subway Series =New York Mets: 2011= In December 2010, the New York Mets signed Paulino to a one-year contract. On May 1, 2011, in a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Paulino went 5–7 and hit the game- winning RBI in the 14th inning in his first game as with the Mets. With the news of the death of Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader who was the mastermind of the September 11 attacks circulating during the game against their rivals, Mets manager Terry Collins said that Paulino delivered \\"a good win for us, and obviously a huge win for America tonight.\\" On June 8, Paulino hit his first home run with the Mets, a three-run home run off of the Milwaukee Brewers Kameron Loe. Paulino became a free agent after the Mets decided not to tender his contract. =Baltimore Orioles: 2012= The Baltimore Orioles signed Paulino to a minor league contract on January 30, 2012. He also received an invitation to spring training, but arrived three weeks late to camp after having visa issues. Paulino made the Orioles 2012 Opening Day roster after Taylor Teagarden, newly signed by the team to be the backup catcher, went on the disabled list because of back problems. In the second game of the 2012 season, Paulino made his first start of the year as the DH and went 4–4. On July 15, 2012, Paulino was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk to make room for Taylor Teagarden, who was coming off from the 60-day disabled list. =Seattle Mariners= Paulino signed with the Seattle Mariners after the 2012 season but was released in March 2013. =Baltimore Orioles= Paulino signed with the Baltimore Orioles on May 15, 2013 to a minor league contract. =Detroit Tigers= In August 2013, the Orioles assigned Paulino to the Toledo Mud Hens, the Detroit Tigers Triple-A affiliate. He re-signed with the Tigers in November 2013 to fill minor league organizational depth. On February 12, 2014, Paulino was suspended 100 games by Major League Baseball for a second PED-related offense. On July 19, 2014, Paulino was released. =Sultanes de Monterrey= On April 28, 2015, Paulino signed with the Sultanes de Monterrey of the Mexican Baseball League. =Vaqueros Laguna= On May 3, 2016, Paulino signed with the Vaqueros Laguna of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on June 27, 2016. =Olmecas de Tabasco= On July 1, 2016, Paulino signed with the Olmecas de Tabasco of the Mexican Baseball League. He was released on February 27, 2017.

He is also noteworthy as the author of Paris Was Our Mistress, a memoir on writers and artists associated with the American ex-patriate community in Paris in the 1920s and early 1930s. Work Putnam's most famous work is his 1949 English translation of Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote. It is the first version of the work in what would today be considered contemporary English; there is still archaic language, but less than in earlier English versions. The language is formal when spoken by educated characters, but seldom old-fashioned, while the peasant characters speak in colloquial modern English. Putnam worked on the translation for 12 years. He also published a companion volume, The Portable Cervantes, that included an abridged version of his translation, in addition to English versions of two of Cervantes's Novelas ejemplares. Daniel Eisenberg, comparing translations of Don Quixote, called Putnam's translation the most \\"sensitive\\", and by far the best documented. Putnam's complete translation, originally published by Viking Press, was reprinted in the Modern Library, and has seldom been out of print since its publication. Putnam was also a noted translator of Rabelais. He was known for his leftist leanings (he was a columnist for the Daily Worker). Putnam was the father of noted American philosopher Hilary Putnam. Hilary Putnam made his first published appearance in his father's Don Quixote translation, in a footnote explaining a joke from the text in terms of logic.

As a journalist he worked in France, Italy, England, Germany and Russia, from where he wrote political and cultural chronicles in Catalan and Spanish. Biography The son of rural business owners of modest means from Baix Empordà, he obtained his high school diploma in Girona, where, beginning in 1909, he was a boarding student at the Colegio de los Maristas (Marist School). In his last academic year (1912–13), he had to take his final exams without having taken the courses because he was expelled from the boarding school. In 1913 he registered to study science at the University of Barcelona and began his studies in medicine, but in the middle of his first course, he changed his mind and registered to study law. The emptiness that he felt in his life at the university did not prevent him from involving himself in another environment that would focus the intellectual disorientation of his youth - the Barcelona Ateneu Club, with its library and above all the daily tertulia (discussion group) led by Dr. Joaquim Borralleras and attended by celebrities such as Josep Maria de Sagarra, Eugeni d'Ors and Francesc Pujols. His admiration for Pío Baroja came from this period – a constant reference for his generation — as well as the influence of Alexandre Plana, a childhood friend and teacher, whom he credits with his decision to distance himself from the pretentious style of the 19th century and to support “a literature for the whole world” based on “intelligibility, clarity, and simplicity”, ideas which would be constant features through his literary career. In 1919 he graduated with a degree in Law and began to work in journalism, first in Las Noticias (The News) and soon after in night publication of La Publicidad (Publicity). He started his journey as a correspondent in various European cities (Paris, Madrid, Berlin). A modern Catalan nationalist, in 1921 he was elected as a diputado (Member of Parliament) of the Commonwealth of Catalonia (Commonwealth of Catalonia) by the Lliga Regionalista (Regionalist League) in his native region, Baix Empordà. En 1924, under the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, he underwent a military proceeding and was condemned to exile because of a critical article about the Spanish military policy in Morocco, published in Majorca's El Día (The Day). During the years of his exile, he negotiated with some of the principal Catalan opponents of the dictatorship such as Francesc Macià. He continued traveling through Europe (Paris, Russia, England), and in 1925 he published his first book, Coses Vistes, which was a great success and sold out in a week. It was a good preview of his aesthetic: \\"to write about the things which one has seen\\". In 1927 he returned to Spain, left La Publicidad and began to collaborate with La Veu de Catalunya, the Lliga Regionalista's newspaper, of a liberal-conservative tendency, to the orders of Francesc Cambó –leader of moderate Catalan nationalism, whose famous tertulias he attended regularly. In April 1931, on the same morning of the proclamation of the Republic of Spain, he was invited to Madrid by Cambó as parliamentary correspondent of La Veu and became a witness to the first days of the Republic. Madrid's book of the notable events of these months, of great historic value is El advenimiento de la República (The coming of the Republic). He remained in Madrid during nearly all of the Republican period, writing features about Parliament, which allowed him to mix with the Spanish political and cultural elite. Pla, who was neither an anti-republican nor an anti-monarchist but a pragmatist who wanted to see a modernization of the State, at first expressed a certain sympathy for the Republic. He believed that the new political system could get off the ground in Spain if it consolidated itself according to the French Republican model, even though little by little he was becoming disillusioned with the course of events until he eventually considered it “a frantic and destructive madness”. Claiming health reasons, he abandoned an agitated and dangerous Madrid a few months before the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. Not even Barcelona seemed safe to him, and he fled in a boat from Catalonia towards Marseille, in September 1938, in the company of Adi Enberg, a Norwegian citizen born in Barcelona who worked for the Francoist espionage service. She was the only person from his secretive and often meagre romantic life with whom we can be certain that he was involved. He continued his exile in Rome, where he wrote a good part of the immense Historia de la Segunda República Española (History of the Second Spanish Republic), an assignment for Francesc Cambó–one of the financiers of the military uprising, which Pla would refuse to re-publish during his lifetime, despite its being a historical work of great interest. In the autumn of 1938, Enberg and Pla traveled to Biarritz and from there they managed to reach San Sebastián, where they entered the Francoist controlled portion of Spain. In January 1939 he, Manuel Aznar and other journalists entered Barcelona along with the victorious Francoist troops. Between February and April 1939, when the war ended, he became the assistant manager of the newspaper La Vanguardia under the direction of Aznar. Overwhelmed by the course of events of the immediate post-war period and before the unexpected failure of his project at La Vanguardia, he moved to the Empordà (Girona) and separated from Adi Enberg. In September 1939 he published his first article in Destino, the weekly publication that his Catalan friends created in Burgos and for which he started to write weekly a few months later, from February 1940. These are the years he spent travelling around his native region, discovering its landscapes and people, small towns and, of course, the sea. Also he finally accepted his role of lower rural bourgeois and never again lived in Barcelona. Due to his regular work with Destino, although he was no longer one of its principal driving forces, he returned to travelling the world, not as a correspondent, but as a journalistic observer, which allowed him to write magnificent travel reports: he visited France, Israel, Cuba, New York, the Middle East, South America, and Russia. Regarding Israel, for instance, he left a unique testimony of its first years of existence as a State - he visited it in 1957, arriving in Tel Aviv in a boat from Marseille full of displaced Jews. He arrived during the enthusiastic construction of the cities and Hebrew infrastructures in the middle of the desert. As a curiosity, Pla had a fondness for travels in very slow oil tankers, which allowed him to write his works peacefully and without distractions from contact with tourists. In the 1970s Pla dedicated himself fully to the preparation of his complete works, a crucial stage since it involved an almost total re-writing of his work and the development of his own unique style. In order to publish these works, he counted on invaluable support of his fellow countryman Josep Vergés, editor of Destino. Meanwhile, culture in the Catalan language was reappearing little by little. After Francoism was terminated by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, despite already being the most-read writer in the Catalan language, fellow authors in Catalan (overwhelmingly on the Left) did not forgive him for his past support of the Francoists during the Civil War and his later coexistence with the régime (Pla had counted on a peaceful and ordered evolution towards democracy). He was also criticized by fellow Catalan authors because of his disdain for fiction as a literary form. He proved himself equally distant: his often sarcastic criticism of some Catalan political and cultural figures had the result, similar to the case of the artist Salvador Dalí, that Catalan culture denied him recognition in the form of prizes (the refusal to grant him the Premi d'Honor de les Lletres). They alienated him from his magazine for life, and they did not recognize his extraordinary worth until many years later. Even so, in 1980, near the end of his life, Josep Tarradellas gave him the Medalla d'Or de la Generalitat de Catalunya (The Gold Medal of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia). It is worth mentioning, as it represented a minor fissure within the so-far monolithic rejection of Pla by writers in Catalan, that Joan Coromines, a fundamental Catalan etymologist, supported Pla in his own acceptance speech for the gold medal Coromines was also granted. Pla died in 1981 in his native Empordà, leaving thirty-eight volumes (over twenty-five thousand pages) of Obra Completa (Complete Works) published, and many unedited papers that have been published since his death. Notability of his work Pla had to live under censorship for much of his life: first during Primo de Rivera's dictatorship, later in Italy and Germany (where he worked as a correspondent during the rise of the Falange), and during Francisco Franco's long rule. Although he initially sympathized with the dictatorship (he wrote in 1940 that it was \\"in the general interest\\"), his support only lasted a few months. He soon began to show skepticism, especially as it became impossible to publish in Catalan. Although he always maintained a moderate political stance that allowed him to publish, he was deeply uncomfortable with Franco's tireless censorship (he wrote in one of his diaries that it was \\"the worst that [I] have known\\", carried out by \\"servants of fanaticism\\"). He hated the regime's disdain for Catalan language and culture and its stubborn inability to turn itself into a democracy, not even a tutelary one. The most important characteristics of the \\"Planian\\" literary style are simplicity, irony, and clarity. Extremely modest and sensitive to ridicule, he detested artifice and empty rhetoric. Throughout his literary life, he remained faithful to his own style: “the necessity of a clear, precise, and restrained writing” and his lack of interest in literary fiction, cultivating a dry style, apparently simple, practical, and devoted to that which is real. He was an acute observer of reality in its smallest details and he gave a faithful testimony of the society of his time. His works show a subjective and colloquial vision, anti- literary, in which he stresses, nevertheless, an enormous stylistic effort by calling things by their names and \\"coming up with the precise adjective\\", one of his most persistent literary obsessions. An untiring writer, from his viewpoint life is chaotic, irrational, and unjust, while the longing for equality and revolutions are a delusion that incites worse wrongs than those that it tries to put a stop to. Conservative and rational, he was not inclined to action, but voluptuousness and sensuality: the pleasure of putting the world down on paper. A good conservative, he ate well and drank better (as an old man, whisky made up a good part of his diet), an inveterate smoker, he wore a bowler hat from his youth and later was inseparable from his country beret. He hated banality, cultural affectations (he never included quotations in his works, despite being a reader of the classics) and \\"people who talk just to hear themselves.\\" So he wrote: \\"It is more difficult to write than to think, much more difficult: so everyone thinks.\\" Works Pla lived a life completely dedicated to writing. The extent of his Obres Completes (Complete Works, 46 volumes and nearly 30,000 pages), which is a collection of all his journals, reports, articles, essays, biographies, novels, and some poems gives an idea of its daunting work schedule while complicating its chronological classification. Many of these pages are the fruit of a hard process of rewriting texts from his youth and weekly articles that were published in Destino for nearly 40 years, as well as hundreds of articles published in different newspapers and an abundance of correspondences. Thematic classification is not easy either, as many articles appeared in different locations with some changes, his thematic repertoire is extensive and, above all, the boundaries between the genres that he developed are not always clear. However, we can make an attempt at organizing into genres (the years outlined correspond to the original publication, not to the translation or the reissue of Complete Works). *Narratives: Coses vistes (1925), Linterna mágica (1926), Relaciones (1927) are books in which narration predominates but foreshadows and hints at other genres which later will be fundamental in his work. Life Embitters (La vida amarga), El estret (1952) and Aigua de mar are later narratives. *Books of notable events and memories: the book of notable events gives Pla great liberty in the combined use of different genres - the personal diary, description, narration, dialogue, personal reflections, advice to the reader, the portrait and analysis of the customs of people and towns. El quadern gris is a book of notable events that was devoted to Pla. It was not an authentic diary, but a “literary” book of notable events, compiled later. The central themes of the book of notable events are the countryside and geography of Empordà, descriptions of daily life and the narrator-author's obsession with writing. *Anthropological and folkloric essays: El payés y su mundo (1990) and Les hores (1953). *Biography: Vida de Manolo (1928), Santiago Rusiñol y su tiempo (1955), Francesc Cambó (1928–1930), Homenots, Retrats de passaport and Tres senyors. Other apparently biographical works are Girona, un llibre de records (1952), Primera Volada, Notes disperses and Notes del capvesprol. *Travel writing: Les illes, Viatge a la Catalunya Vella, Itàlia i el Mediterrani, Les Amèriques, Sobre París i França, Cartas de lejos and Israel, 1957 (1957) *Political writing: Madrid. El advenimiento de la República (1933), Crónicas (1933–1934) and (1934–1936) During the first years of the Francoist regime, due of the complete restriction of the Catalan edition, the following works were published in Spanish: Guía de la Costa Brava (1941), Las ciudades del mar (1942), Viaje en autobús (1942) – considered one of his greatest works, and which proves his skillful grasp of the Spanish language -, Rusiñol y su tiempo (1942), El pintor Joaquín Mir (1944), Un señor de Barcelona (1945) and La huida del tiempo (1945). In 1947, as soon as censorship was lifted, he returned to publishing in Catalan (Cadaqués, one of his most successful books). After 1956 he started the first series of his Complete Works, which extended to 29 volumes and in which he began to publish his extraordinary portrayals Homenots (Great men). In 1966, Ediciones Destino began the publication of this series. The first volume was an unpublished work, El quadern gris, a book of notable events initially written when he was only a little over 20 years of age (although rewritten and substantially expanded later). It was translated into Spanish as El cuaderno gris by Dionisio Ridruejo and into English as The Gray Notebook by Peter Bush.http://www.nybooks.com/books/imprints/classics/the-gray-notebook It was considered a before and after in the public consideration of Pla, much more than as a journalist, as the best narrator of contemporary Catalan literature. The success of the criticism and publicity of this work convinced Vergés to continue publishing the complete work, which has reached volume XLVI, with unpublished manuscripts (such as his Notas para un diario, written in the mid-1960s), not free from controversy, by the supposed amendments and manipulations to which Vergés himself was subjected (apparently, in order to suppress certain obscene passages). Later Keerl, his heir, became much more preoccupied with economically exploiting the documents than putting them at the disposal of investigators or the Josep Pla Foundation. Even though he did not write plays, his life and work inspired various significant works after his death, among which are: Ara que els ametllers ja estan batuts (Now that the almond trees have been knocked down) 1990, in which Josep Maria Flotats creates a portrait of Pla through a collage of his texts. Also La increíble historia del Dr. Floït & Mr. Pla (1997), a production by Els Joglars, which recreates the work of Robert Louis Stevenson where the characters Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are, respectively, a Catalan industrialist obsessed with wealth and, on the other side, an educated and indulgent writer which personifies the opposed values of industrial bourgeoisie, based on Pla. His liberal- conservative thought, skeptical and uncompromising, filled with irony and common sense, still resounds today, even though it seems to contradict the current cultural establishment the same as it did the previous establishment. His books remain in print, and both Spanish and Catalan critics have unanimously recognized him as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. Since 1968, the Josep Pla Award has been given in his honor, for works written and published in Catalan. Bibliography * Josep Pla, \\"Life Embitters\\", translated by Peter Roland Bush.

It practiced in the areas of business, labour and employment, litigation, taxation, entertainment law and intellectual property law. The firm was founded in 1973 by Roy Heenan, Donald Johnston, and Peter Blaikie. Based in Montreal, at one time the firm had over 500 lawyers with offices in Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, Quebec City, Sherbrooke, Trois-Rivières and Paris, and representative offices in Singapore. and a satellite office in Los Angeles which closed in December 2015. As of February 2011, it was the sixth largest law firm in Canada. It became the largest law firm to close in Canadian history after its partners voted to dissolve the firm on February 5, 2014. The firm closed on February 28, 2014.  History  The firm was founded in 1973 by Roy Heenan, Donald Johnston, and Peter Blaikie as Johnston Heenan Blaikie. After Johnston left to become a Member of Parliament in 1978, the firm was renamed Heenan Blaikie. The firm was one of the first to expand across Canada in the 1970s, helping pioneer the concept of national law firms. It also established a reputation as the landing ground for former Prime Ministers: both Jean Chrétien and Pierre Trudeau joined the firm after their respective political careers ended. At one point the home of over 500 lawyers, the firm began to suffer financial trouble in 2013. Hurt by falling revenues from a drop-off in business from resource companies, the opening of a Paris office at a time the economy was struggling there, and the end of several major cases at the same time, the firm announced a drop in income per partner of 10 to 15 percent. One week later, the firm faced a rash of defection, with nearly 30 senior partners exiting for more profitable firms. The firm voted on February 5, 2014 to start the orderly dissolution of the firm, the largest in Canadian history, surpassing the previous record set by Goodman and Carr in 2007. On February 28, 2014, the firm closed, leaving a skeleton crew of support staff to wind down the firm's operations over the next few months.  Work  At the international level, Heenan Blaikie was counsel to the Canadian Employers Council, an organisation that represents Canadian employers at the International Labour Organization (ILO). Heenan Blaikie was also the Canadian member of the National Workers' Compensation Defense Network (NWCDN), an organization of independent law firms in the United States and Canada with an established workers' compensation practice and experience in defending employers and insurance companies in workers' compensation and related actions. In addition to its European and Asian presence, its Paris office served as a foray into the African market. However, the firm's activities in Africa garnered controversy, as its endeavours there included a working relationship with Ari Ben-Menashe, from whom the firm tried to distance itself. According to Jean-Francois Mercadier, \\"partners started to lose any kind of faith in the management of the firm\\", which resulted in the company's collapse.

Howard that blends history and fantasy. Published posthumously in 1962, the first appearance of the story was in a collection titled Dark Mind, Dark Heart, edited by August Derleth.Works of Robert E. Howard, The Grey God Passes, retrieved 16 August 2007 The tale is a fictionalized version of the Battle of Clontarf (1014) recast in Howard's views, with doomful vision and fantasy elements. While the historical facts of the battle are accurate, they are not the most important parts of the story. The protagonist is Turlogh Dubh O'Brien, a recurring character of Howard's who is an outcast from Brian Boru's own clan. Howard first wrote a version of this story, called \\"Spears of Clontarf\\", but it was rejected by publishers, and he then added weird elements so as to be able to submit it to the Weird Tales magazine, where it was also rejected by editor Farnsworth Wright in December, 1931.https://historical.ha.com/itm/books/fiction/robert-e-howard-typed- manuscript-and-rejection-letter-for-the-grey-god-passes-this-lot-features-the- original-typed-ma/a/626-25788.s The first version first saw print in a chapbook in 1978.Works of Robert E. Howard, Spears of Clontarf, retrieved 16 August 2007 Plot introduction The core of the story, as indicated by the title, is the end of the influence of supernatural beings from our world with the victory of Christian King Brian over the heathen Vikings. Among the Irish dead is a fey prince whose own death will cause the death of his fairy lover, a metaphor for the waning away of all the Sidhe. Odin himself makes an impressive and doomful appearance, making the battle a Götterdämmerung. This is more Wagnerian in tone than the utter end of the world predicted for Ragnarök, though it is indeed the end of a world. Style While little known, this story can be regarded as a turning point in the timeline of Howard's universe. While even in his stories that take place in incredibly ancient times, the horror, supernatural and Cthulhu mythos elements are seen as survivals from older, more horrible epochs. It can be perceived that in stories that take place later, such elements are viewed as even more horrible and abnormal. (Compare the view of the supernatural in the Kull or Conan the Barbarian stories, with that in the Solomon Kane tales or in The Black Stone or The Children of the Night for instance.) The notable exception being Worms of the Earth where, in the fourth or fifth century, even a hard bitten hero like Bran Mak Morn finds horror beyond his ability to stand. Adaptations The story was adapted by Marvel Comics as a Conan story in Conan the Barbarian #3 (\\"Twilight of the Grim Grey God\\", Feb 1971). Finnish comic book artist Petri Hiltunen adapted the story to an album Harmaan Jumalan Hetki. Footnotes Category:Short stories by Robert E.

A Republican, he was most notable for his service as a United States Senator from 1895 to 1899. Mantle was born in Birmingham, England on December 13, 1851. His father died before Mantle was born, and his mother converted to Mormonism and immigrated to the United States with her children. The family settled in Salt Lake City in 1864. Upon observing that Mormons were practicing polygamy, Mantle's mother decided she had been deceived by the church missionaries who had recruited her, and the Mantles renounced the LDS Church. Mantle attended a village school and moved to Idaho Territory in 1870, where he was a telegraph operator and stage agent for Western Union. He moved to Butte, Montana in 1877 and became agent of the Wells-Fargo Express Co. Mantle was one of the organizers of Butte as a city, and in 1880 served on its first board of aldermen. In 1881, he established the Daily Inter Mountain, the first Republican newspaper in Western Montana. He was elected to the Territorial house of representatives in 1882, 1886, and 1888, and served as speaker in 1889. He was mayor of Butte from 1892 to 1893. In 1893, Mantle was appointed to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy for the term beginning on commencing March 4. He was not seated because the Senate determined that the governor did not have the power to make an appointment while the legislature was in session. He was later elected by the legislature, and he served from January 16, 1895 to March 3, 1899. In 1896, Mantle joined the Silver Republican Party and served as its chairman in Montana. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the U.S. Senate nomination in 1899, and returned to the Republican Party in 1900. Mantle was publisher of the Inter Mountain until 1901 and became wealthy through investments and ownership stakes in real estate, mines, insurance, and other ventures. In 1921, he moved to California. A bachelor until 1922, at age 70 he married a 25-year-old woman he had known since she was a child. They were married until his death, and were the parents of a son. Mantle died Los Angeles, California on November 18, 1934. He was interred at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Butte. Early life Theophilus Washington Mantle, usually known as Lee Mantle, was born in Birmingham, England on December 13, 1851, a son of Joseph Mantle and Mary Susan (Patrick) Mantle. His father died before he was born, and support of the family fell to Mantle's mother. A convert to Mormonism, in 1864 she brought her family of four boys and three girls to the United States, and they settled in Salt Lake City. After deciding that the Mormon missionaries who had recruited her had not been truthful with respect to the church's practice of polygamy, the Mantles renounced their affiliation. Lee Mantle attended local schools and was \\"placed out\\" to work for his room and board beginning at age 10. He worked for several years as a cattle herder and farm laborer, earning $50 (about $1,025 in 2020) a year for his family in addition to his food and shelter. At age 16 he obtained a job with the Union Pacific Railroad, which employed him as a teamster to haul ties and other supplies and equipment. After the Union Pacific and Central Pacific completed the first First Transcontinental Railroad at Promontory Point, Utah in 1869, Mantle walked to Malad City, Idaho (about 125 miles). In Malad City, Mantle was hired by Benjamin F. White to drive an ox team and wagon at White's saltworks. After two years at the saltworks, in 1872 Mantle arranged to learn telegraphy from an experienced operator, who agreed to train him on the condition that Mantle maintain the Western Union line along the Central Pacific tracks between Green River, Utah and Ogden, Utah during the winter months. In 1873, Mantle was assigned as a telegrapher at the Western Union office on the stagecoach line between Corinne, Utah and Helena, Montana. A year later, he purchased the station near Haskell Pass in Flathead County, Montana. Mantle was the Western Union telegraph operator and postmaster, and also purchased an interest in a toll road through Monida Pass. In 1877, Mantle sold his Haskell Pass businesses and moved to Butte, Montana, where he was employed as telegrapher by Wells Fargo & Company and also started the city's first insurance brokerage. Entering politics as a Republican, Mantle was one of the leaders of the effort to incorporate Butte as a city. The effort was successful, and in 1880, Mantle was elected to Butte's first board of aldermen. Continued career In 1881, Mantle started the Daily Inter Mountain, the first Republican newspaper in Western Montana. Through the paper's editorial stance, Mantle became a Republican leader and largely shaped the party's organization and policies in Montana. He was elected to the legislature of Montana Territory in 1882. When John Schuyler Crosby left the territorial governorship in 1884, Mantle was the candidate of Western Montana to replace him, but Eastern Montana Republicans prevailed in obtaining the appointment for B. Platt Carpenter. Mantle was a delegate to the 1884 Republican National Convention, and supported George F. Edmunds for president. In 1886, Mantle was elected to a second term in the Territorial House. When the Northern Pacific Railway attempted to obtain large grants of land in Montana from the federal government, Mantle was chosen president of the Mineral Land Association, the citizens' group formed to oppose the Northern Pacific. The association's lobbying and legal efforts proved successful, and the NP did not acquire the land it sought. In 1888, Mantle was again elected to the legislature, the territory's last, and he was chosen to serve as Speaker of the House. When Montana was admitted to the Union in 1890, Mantle was a candidate for the U.S. Senate, and narrowly lost in the legislature's Republican caucus to Wilbur F. Sanders and Thomas C. Power, who were elected. In 1890 and 1892, Mantle was chairman of Montana's state Republican convention. In 1892 he was elected chairman of the state Republican executive committee. He was also elected mayor of Butte in 1892, and he served one term. When Sanders' U.S. Senate term expired in 1893, the Montana Legislature was unable to agree on a successor. Governor John E. Rickards appointed Mantle to fill the vacancy, but the Senate refused to seat him on the grounds that the governor could not make an appointment while the legislature was in session. Also in 1893, Mantle was named chairman of the state commission that organized Montana's participation at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. United States Senator Sanders' seat remained vacant until January 1895, when the legislature elected Mantle as his successor. He served one partial term, January 16, 1895 to March 3, 1899. In the Senate, Mantle served on the Finance Committee, where he worked to obtain passage of amendments to the Dingley Act tariff which were favored by the National Wool Growers Association. Mantle was also an advocate of the Free silver movement, which many Montana miners favored in the belief that it would make their holdings more valuable. As a result of this view, in 1896, Mantle joined the Silver Republican Party and became its chairman in Montana. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection to the Senate in 1899. In 1900, he returned to the Republican Party. Another Mantle cause in the Senate was protecting Montana timber interests. In 1897, outgoing President Grover Cleveland withdrew six million acres of forest land from the public domain to be set aside as a timber reserve. In Mantle's view, this move threatened Montana's mining interests, which depended on timber when opening and expanding mines. He also viewed Cleveland's move as a threat to Montana logging companies, since removing the land from public domain prevented them from harvesting trees for production of wood and paper products. After William McKinley succeeded Cleveland, he reduced the size of the timber reserve by more than 700,000 acres. Later life After leaving the Senate, Mantle resumed his business interests. With partner Charles S. Warren, he held ownership stakes in the Silver Bow Electric Company, commercial real estate, mines, insurance companies, and publishing houses. He was a noted civic activist, and his memberships included the Masons, Elks, Knights of Pythias, and the Rocky Mountain Club of New York City. In 1901, Mantle was again a candidate for the U.S. Senate. Both seats were up for election, and former Senator William A. Clark was chosen for one. Mantle was a major candidate for the other, but after the legislature was deadlocked for over a month, Republican legislators decided to back Thomas H. Carter, who lost to Democrat Paris Gibson. In 1902, Mantle was a delegate to the state Republican convention, and he was chairman of the state party's 1904 convention. He was also a delegate to the 1904 Republican National Convention, which unanimously nominated Theodore Roosevelt for a full term as president and Charles W. Fairbanks for vice president. He declined the party's nomination for governor in 1904, but accepted election as the state Republican Party chairman. In that fall's election, his efforts led Republicans to victory in the down-ballot statewide races, but Democrats won the governorship and lieutenant governorship. In 1902, the Montana Legislature named Mantle to the commission responsible for the state's participation in the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis and 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition in Portland, Oregon. The commission chose Mantle to serve as its president, and he was responsible for creation and management of Montana's exhibits at both events. In 1905, Mantle was a candidate for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination, but lost to Thomas H. Carter, who was reelected. In 1907, he was a candidate for the Republican nomination for U.S. senator. He lost to Joseph M. Dixon, who went on to win the seat. In 1921, Mantle moved to San Francisco, California. After his marriage, he relocated to Los Angeles. Mantle died in Los Angeles on November 18, 1934. He was buried at Mount Moriah Cemetery in Butte. Family Mantle remained a bachelor until 1922. At age 70, he made national headlines when he married Etta Daly (1897-1993), a 25-year-old he had known since she was a child. They remained married until his death and were the parents of a son, Lee Mantle Jr. (1922-1985).

In physics, a theory in D spacetime dimensions can be redefined in a lower number of dimensions d, by taking all the fields to be independent of the location in the extra D − d dimensions. For example, consider a periodic compact dimension with period L. Let x be the coordinate along this dimension. Any field \\\\phi can be described as a sum of the following terms: :\\\\phi_n = A_n \\\\cos \\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi n x}{L}\\\\right) with An a constant. According to quantum mechanics, such a term has momentum nh/L along x, where h is Planck's constant. Therefore, as L goes to zero, the momentum goes to infinity, and so does the energy, unless n = 0\\\\. However n = 0 gives a field which is constant with respect to x. So at this limit, and at finite energy, \\\\phi will not depend on x. This argument generalizes. The compact dimension imposes specific boundary conditions on all fields, for example periodic boundary conditions in the case of a periodic dimension, and typically Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions in other cases. Now suppose the size of the compact dimension is L; then the possible eigenvalues under gradient along this dimension are integer or half-integer multiples of 1/L (depending on the precise boundary conditions). In quantum mechanics this eigenvalue is the momentum of the field, and is therefore related to its energy. As L → 0 all eigenvalues except zero go to infinity, and so does the energy. Therefore, at this limit, with finite energy, zero is the only possible eigenvalue under gradient along the compact dimension, meaning that nothing depends on this dimension.

Early life The Bonnelly-Fondeur family, circa 1902. The marriage of María Luisa Fondeur and Carlos Sully Bonnelly, appears alongside their children: Carlos Sully Rafael, Carmen Camelia Florencia, Manuel Furcy, Manuel Ulises, Raúl, and Luis Alberto. Rafael Filiberto Bonnelly Fondeur was born to Carlos Sully Bonnelly Arnaud and Ms Luisa Fondeur in Santiago de los Caballeros, the Dominican Republic. Bonnelly was born into a family of Corsican and French descent, descendants of white colonists that settled briefly in Saint-Domingue prior the Haitian Revolution, two generations of the Bonnelly family lived in Charlotte Amalie, Saint Thomas, and then they moved to the Cibao region in the Dominican Republic. While the origins of his Fondeur family was said to be born in Bordeaux and Paris (between 1812 and 1818, proposed Penzo), they may have arrived at the years of España Boba (Foolish Spain) or during the Haitian occupation (for the author cited between 1819 and 1822). He obtained his baccalaureate in Law on March 27, 1926 from the University of Santo Domingo. He became a teacher at the Normal School in Santo Domingo from 1926 to 1930. He married Aida Batlle and procreated four children: Luisa Amelia, Rafael Francisco, Juan Sully and Aida María. Also, he was the uncle of fashion designer Sully Bonnelly. Bonnelly's first foray into public life was his participation in the revolt against President Horacio Vásquez in 1930, led by Dr. Rafael Estrella Ureña, and supported by then head of the Army, General Rafael Trujillo. Bonnelly later became a Deputy at the National Congress, but rapidly had a falling out with Trujillo, who had deported Dr. Estrella Ureña and assumed the Presidency of the Country, after publicly voting against an Education bill sent by the dictator to Congress. His fall out with Trujillo in 1931 led to a 12-year professional hiatus, in which Bonnelly was prevented from working as a lawyer. The return of Dr. Estrella Ureña to the Dominican Republic in 1942, under an amnesty granted by Trujillo, led to Bonnelly's reappearance into Dominican public life as a Senator, between 1942 and 1944. After Dr. Ureña's death in 1945, Bonnelly started an ascending career as a public servant, which culminated with his naming as President of the Dominican Republic on January 1962. = Ancestors = His Career in Public Service During these years, Bonnelly held the following posts: 1944–46 Minister of the Interior; 1946–48 Minister of Labor; 1948–49 Attorney General; 1949–53 Dean of the University of Santo Domingo; 1949–53 Professor of Constitutional and Civil Law; 1953–54 Prime Minister; 1954 Minister of Education; 1954–56 Ambassador to Spain; 1956–57 Minister of Justice, 1957–59 Ambassador to Venezuela; 1960–62 Vice- President of the Dominican Republic. Bonnelly's main achievement as President was to organize the Dominican Republic's first free elections after the end of the 30-year-long Trujillo dictatorship, in which Dr. Juan Bosch was elected. But, during his brief but intensive Presidency, Bonnelly's Government wrote and passed some of the principal legislation in the country, such as the Banking and Housing laws, which are still used. In 1966, Bonnelly made an unsuccessful run for the presidency in an election which was won by Dr. Joaquín Balaguer, with strong backing from the government of American President Lyndon Johnson. Bonnelly and Balaguer were friends in their early days, and served together in several posts during the Trujillo dictatorship, but they became political opponents after Balaguer was ousted from the Presidency in 1961, being substituted by Bonnelly, his Vice-president at the time. Head to Head with Balaguer Bonnelly's last public bout with Balaguer was a national display of penmanship between the two leaders, right after the national elections of May 1978. Seeing that Balaguer's Partido Reformista was losing the elections, Balaguer's generals raided the Electoral Board and stopped the vote counting, sinking the country in a state of unrest and uncertainty. During two weeks, Bonnelly and Balaguer engaged in a public debate published in the main newspapers of the country, which ended with Balaguer accepting his defeat and proclaiming Antonio Guzmán, the candidate for the Partido Revolucionario Dominicano (PRD) and the President Elect. In the summer of 1979, he was awarded the Doctorate Honoris Causa by the Pontificia Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM), the leading private university in the country. On December 28, 1979, Dr. Rafael Bonnelly died of cancer in his home in Santo Domingo.

By contrast the love between other family members are predicated upon the commonness the two parties share. Friedman further states that husband and wife, male and female, in essence always remain strangers; for this reason the acquired love in the relationship is never entirely consistent.Lyman, Bari.

She quotes Friedman saying that a woman \\"violates herself\\" if she were to refrain from having children and that birth control is a \\"violent violation of a woman's being\\". Friedman insisted that the teenage angst experienced by girls stems from the fact that they are already biologically and psychologically ready for marriage but their urges are held back; he believes that girls should optimally get married at the age of fourteen. According to Davidman, Friedman's position on femininity differed entirely from the values of his students. Controversial comments =On the Israeli-Arab conflict= Friedman has claimed that the moral way to fight a war is to \\"Destroy their holy sites.

He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada. He was born in Scotland in 1801 and came to Niagara in Upper Canada with his parents. In 1814, he moved to York (Toronto) and entered the grocery business with his brother Jun Monro; he later struck out on his own sometime around 1824, becoming an importer and wholesaler. His business was regarded as one of the grandest mercantile businesses in town. The business was located on King Street and the building doubled as a residence and store. In 1830 he was one of the founding directors of the Home District Savings Bank of Toronto along with notable local figures like William Warren Baldwin, Jesse Ketchum and A.T. Wood. He was elected to city council in 1834 and served as mayor in 1841. He served as a captain in the local militia during the Upper Canada Rebellion. Monro ran unsuccessfully for the legislative assembly in the same year. In 1844, he was defeated by James Edward Small in the 3rd riding of York but was declared elected when Small was disqualified. He was defeated in the next general election in 1848 and he retired from business around 1856. He died in Toronto in 1878.

Howard, first published in the November 1931 issue of Weird Tales. The story introduces the mad poet Justin Geoffrey and the fictitious Unaussprechlichen Kulten by Friedrich von Junzt. The story is part of the Cthulhu Mythos, and follows the same pattern and has the same features as much of H. P. Lovecraft's classic work. Synopsis The story opens with an unnamed narrator being gripped with curiosity by a brief reference to the Black Stone in the book Nameless Cults, aka The Black Book, by Friedrich von Junzt. He researches the artifact but finds little further information. The ancient (though its age is debated) monolith stands near to the village of Stregoicavar (\\"meaning something like Witch-Town\\") in the mountains of Hungary. There are many superstitions surrounding it, for instance anyone who sleeps nearby will suffer nightmares for the rest of their life and anyone who visits the stone on Midsummer Night will go insane and die. Though the Monolith is hated and disliked by all in the village, it is said by the Innskeeper that \\"Any man who lay hammer or maul to it die evilly\\", so that all of the villagers simply shun the stone. The narrator decides to travel to Stregoicavar on vacation. Along the way he hears of the local history and sees the site of an old battlefield, where Count Boris Vladinoff fought the invading Suleiman the Magnificent in 1526. Local stories say that Vladinoff took shelter in a ruined castle and was brought a lacquered case that had been found near the body of Selim Bahadur, \\"the famous Turkish scribe and historian\\", who had died in a recent battle. The unnamed contents scared the Count but at that moment Turkish artillery destroyed a part of the castle and he got buried in the rubble, where his bones still remain till present day. Reaching the village, the narrator interviews some of the villagers. The current inhabitants are not the original people of the village - they were all wiped out by the Turkish invasion in 1526. They are said to have been of a different, unknown, race than the Hungarians with a reputation for raiding their villages and kidnapping women and children. A school teacher reveals that according to legend, the original name for the village was Xuthltan and the stone was worshiped by pagans at one time (although they probably did not erect it themselves). The black stone is \\"octagonal in shape, some sixteen feet in height and about a foot and a half thick.\\" A week after arriving the narrator realizes that it is Midsummer Night and makes his way to the stone. He falls asleep an hour before midnight but wakes to find the chanting and dancing people around the stone. After much dancing, during which the narrator is unable to move or do anything but observe, a baby is killed in sacrifice. Shortly a giant toad-like monster appears at the top of the stone and a second sacrifice, a young girl, is offered to it. The narrator faints at this point and decides that it was a dream when he wakes again. But slowly, he realizes that it was no dream. He remembers that Selim Bahadur's case was still with the Count's bones which hadn't been disturbed. The narrator digs out the nobleman's bones and with them, the case belonging to the Turk Selim Bahadur. He translates the account written by the historian and is horrified by his account of what happened near the Black Stone, how the monstrous creature killed at least ten men before being killed by steel weapons blessed by Muhammad. He realizes that the cultist worshipers are ghosts who're bowing before a ghost. He flings the contents of the case into a river. Characters =Justin Geoffrey= (1898-1926) A poet who wrote \\"The People of the Monolith\\" after visiting the village of Stregoicavar and died \\"screaming in a madhouse\\" five years before the events of the story. He is remembered by the villagers as acting in an odd manner, with a habit of mumbling to himself. The story opens with this stanza, which is attributed to him: > They say foul things of Old Times still lurk In dark forgotten corners of > the world. And Gates still gape to loose, on certain nights. Shapes pent in > Hell. =Friedrich Wilhelm von Junzt= (1795-1840) An eccentric German poet and philosopher noted for his extensive travels and membership in myriad secret societies. He is mainly remembered as the author of the Unaussprechlichen Kulten (Nameless Cults or The Black Book), which was published shortly before his death. Six months after his return from an expedition to Mongolia, he was found dead in a locked and bolted chamber with taloned finger marks on his throat. Robert M. Price compares the death of Von Junzt to the demise of Abdul Alhazred, author of the Necronomicon: \\"[In] Lovecraft's tongue-in-cheek 'History of the Necronomicon'...he recounts the doom of Abdul Alhazred.

It is the first in the video game series to Debut for the PlayStation 3 and Wii consoles as launch titles and the last one to be released on the Game Boy Advance. Former Seattle Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander is on the cover. This is the last game to feature NFL Europe in the series. Features Just as in previous titles in the Madden NFL series, Madden NFL 07 makes a few additions to the general game play. *Lead Blocker Control: After selecting a running play, the player will be able to cycle through the offensive players as they get into position at the line. The player can choose the athlete to control when the ball is snapped, and the game camera will zoom in on the fullback, tackle, guard, center, tight end, or wide receiver selected. With this feature, it is now possible for the player to open up a path for a running play, as the computer controls the halfback and tries to slip through the gap created. This feature also appeals to Madden players who do not wish to use computer assistance in any way, shape, or form. This feature allows the player to manually block with their fullback, tackle, guard, center, tight end, or wide receiver and quickly switch to their halfback to manually slip through the gap created, thus eliminating any computer assistance during the gameplay. *Highlight Stick: Players can now move the right analog stick in any direction to see an animation where the smaller running backs will duck, spin, or squirt out of a tackle. It is also possible to string such evasive moves together, piecing together a juke left with a hop step backwards (down on the right analog stick for PS2 and Xbox or down on the C stick for Gamecube) to elude defenders. The Truck Stick animations still exist for the bigger backs, but also feature more variety of running moves with the addition of the Highlight Stick. For example, using the Highlight Stick with Tiki Barber, a smaller back not known for trucking, utilizes an array of moves to avoid and squirt out of tackles. *Juking and Spinning: Players can now choose two types of both Jukes and Spins to avoid would-be tacklers. For the PS2, players can either do a cut move to the left or right using the L1 or R1 buttons respectively, or a wider juke to the left or right by flicking the Right Analog stick left or right respectively. For a quick spin to elude a tackler the player simply taps the circle button. For a stronger spin which could possibly break a tackle, simply hold down the circle button. *FreeMotion Controls: The Wii version of Madden NFL 07, which was developed at EA Canada rather than Tiburon, features a unique control scheme that has been completely redone to complement the motion sensing capabilities of the console's Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Wii versions The seventh generation version of Madden NFL 07 featured the Superstar Mode and Franchise but the Tony Bruno Show was absent in this game possibly due to a contractual issue, but he was in the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version also did not allow the player to edit the players appearance or attributes or change the numbers on their jerseys, but the Wii version and PlayStation 2 version did. Though, the Xbox 360 version did allow one to create a player. The franchise mode is not as deep as the previous generation versions, as Owner Mode is not present. Fantasy Draft and Two- Player co-operative play are missing as well. Also this game would be the last appearance of the NFL Europe teams in the Xbox version, next gen games came without the league teams. Soundtrack The soundtrack features 35 songs from various artists such as Audioslave, Rise Against, Keane, Wolfmother, Lupe Fiasco, Cord, Thirty Seconds to Mars, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus and Trae tha Truth. Reception =Critical reception= The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on all platforms except the DS and Game Boy Advance versions, which received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. AllGame gave the PS2 and Xbox versions each a score of four stars out of five and said of the entertainment, \\"The Madden gameplay has always been spectacular and it gets better with the new offensive line and running back controls.\\" IGN gave the 2D edition of the Mobile phone version a score of 4.5 out of ten and called it \\"a mess\\" and \\"a let-down and a bad call for all involved.\\" However, the same website gave the 3D edition of the same version a score of eight out of ten and called it \\"a far superior product over the 2D edition -- it's the only download you should consider if you want at some mobile Madden.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the PlayStation 2 version a score of one six, one eight, one six, and one seven, for a total of 27 out of 40, while also giving the Xbox 360 version a score of one seven, one eight, one seven, and one five, for the same total of 27 out of 40. =Awards= *The Wii version of Madden NFL 07 won GameSpot's award for Best Traditional Sports Game and for Best New Control Scheme of 2006. The reason cited for this selection, particularly in light of other versions that feature more detailed graphics and online play capability, is the Wii version's FreeMotion controls, which provided a fresh take on play mechanics that the editorial staff felt had grown stale after years of minimal year-to-year adjustments. *It received GameSpot's Award for Best Original Game Mechanic for the FreeMotion controls used in the Wii version. *It was named the \\"Best Sporting Game of 2006\\" on G4's television series, X-Play. *It was named the \\"Game with the most Game\\" on the Spike Guys' Choice Awards on June 13, 2007. *It was named BB&B;'s Sports Game of the year on August 22, 2006. =US sales= In December 2006, all versions of Madden NFL 07 combined sold 1.9 million units, making it the best- selling title that month in the United States. Overall in 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of Madden NFL 07 sold 2.8 million units, making it the best-selling video game that year in the US, while the Xbox 360 version sold 1.1 million units in the US. Legacy In November 2007, Madden NFL 07 was included in EA Sports: 07 Collection along with other 2006 EA Sports games.

This volatile liquid is highly reactive and more often discussed than intentionally prepared. It is a dangerous oxidizer and was first described in 1860.Aschoff, H. Ann. Phys. Chem. Ser. 2 volume 111 (1860) page 217 and page 224. It is the acid anhydride of permanganic acid.  Properties  The crystalline form of this chemical compound is dark green. The liquid is green by reflected light and red by transmitted light. It is soluble in carbon tetrachloride, and decomposes when in contact with water. Structure Its solubility properties indicate a nonpolar molecular species, which is confirmed by its structure. The molecules consist of a pair of tetrahedra that share a common vertex. The vertices are occupied by oxygen atoms and at the centers of the tetrahedra are the Mn(VII) centers. The connectivity is indicated by the formula O3Mn−O−MnO3. The terminal Mn−O distances are 1.585 Å and the bridging oxygen is 1.77 Å distant from the two Mn atoms. The Mn−O−Mn angle is 120.7°. Pyrosulfate, pyrophosphate, and dichromate adopt structures similar to that of Mn2O7. Probably the most similar main group species is Cl2O7. Focusing on comparisons within the transition metal series, Tc2O7 and Mn2O7 are structurally similar but the Tc−O−Tc angle is 180°. Solid Re2O7 is not molecular but consists of crosslinked Re centers with both tetrahedral and octahedral sites; in the vapour phase it is molecular with a similar structure to Tc2O7.Wells A.F.

He was born in Çırağan Palace, Ortaköy, on 5 July 1883, as the eldest son of Şehzade Mehmed Selaheddin Efendi, by his wife Naziknaz Hanım, and grandson of Sultan Murad V. He was educated privately. He was promoted to the rank of colonel of infantry of the Ottoman Army. Ahmed Nihad Efendi received the honors of the Collar of the Hanedan-ı-Ali-Osman and the Nişan-ı-Ali-Imtiyaz. He succeeded on the death of his cousin, Prince Abdulmecid Efendi, the last Ottoman Caliph, as Head of the Imperial House of Osman on 23 August 1944, to become the first head of the Ottoman family not to hold the office of Ottoman Caliph since his ancestor Sultan Selim I was granted this title in 1517. Had he been the reigning Sultan he would have been Sultan Ahmed IV. Life Şehzade Ahmed Nihad, spent his entire childhood and early adulthood confined in Çırağan Palace, Ortaköy, in Constantinople (Istanbul). The Palace served as an enforced residence to his grandfather Sultan Murad V, who had been deposed in 1876, and replaced by his brother, Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The restrictions imposed on the former Sultan extended to his entire family, and were not lifted until his death in 1904. On the death of his grandfather, Ahmed Nihad left his enforced confinement at Çırağan Palace and lived for a few years in the properties rented by his father in the Feneryolu, Kuruçeşme and Ortaköy districts of Istanbul. From 1911 until his exile he lived in the mansion which he had designed himself and had built on Serencebey hill overlooking Beşiktaş and from 1915 he would spend the summer months at the Muradiye Pavilion in Kurbağalıdere. However, he would only enjoy 20 years of freedom in his homeland, as following the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, and the abolition of the Ottoman Sultanate and the Caliphate, the entire Imperial Ottoman family were forced into exile in March 1924. Aged 41, Ahmed Nihad, left Turkey never to return, since he died before the decree of exile was lifted. He went into exile with both his wives, first to Budapest for a few months, then to Nice in France for 12 years. As the former Ottoman Sultan Mehmed VI had settled in San Remo, many members of the family had congregated to the South of France. In 1937 he moved to Beirut, Lebanon where he lived for the rest of his life. Life in exile was always very difficult since members of the Imperial Ottoman family had no financial means, and all yearned to return to their homeland but for Ahmed Nihad life was made harder after he suffered a stroke which left him handicapped. Ahmed Nihad became the head of the exiled Imperial family in August 1944, but was the first head of the Ottoman family since the early 16th century who did not hold the title of Caliph of Islam. Since many members of the family had settled in the Middle East following their exile, they frequently visited him in Beirut to pay homage, as was the custom of the family. Ahmed Nihad was a pious and dutiful man, who had a talent for architectural design and carpentry. He was also a talented composer and an accomplished musician and painter. Personal life Ahmed Nihad's first wife was Safiru Hanım. She was born in 1885. They married in the Çırağan Palace, during the confinement Sulltan Murad's family. She gave birth to the couple's only son Şehzade Ali Vâsib on 3 October 1903, one year before their ordeal in the Çırağan came to an end in 1904. Ahmed Nihad's second wife was Nezihe Hanım. She was born in 1890 in Circassia. Her mother was Fatma Şazende Hanım, who was the head kalfa in the harem of Sultan Murad. They divoced in 1916, after Nihad married Nevrestan, her stepsister. She then married Ali Fehmi Doğrusöz, an Ottoman officer, and had a son Feridun Doğrusöz. She died in 1972. Ahmed Nihad's third wife was Nevrestan Hanım. She was born in 1893 in Adapazarı. Her father was Tahir Bey Atzamba, an Abkhazian officer in the Ottoman army, and her mother was Fatma Şazende Hanım. Şazende had married twice, and Tahir was her second husband, making Nevrestan Nezihe's stepsister. They married on 10 April 1915. The couple resided in the Beylerbeyi Palace. At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, they settled in Beirut. When the female members of the Ottoman dynasty were allowed to return to Turkey in 1952, Nevrestan then moved to Serecebey, Istanbul where she died in 1983.

It was developed in 1968 as an enclosed shopping mall featuring Diamond's and J. C. Penney as the main anchor stores. The mall underwent a period of decline following the opening of Fiesta Mall in 1979, particularly after Diamond's consolidated with its store in that mall in 1984. Despite a mall-wide renovation completed in 1985 and the addition of new tenants such as ZCMI and Bealls, Tri-City Mall continued to diminish throughout the 1990s, with J. C. Penney closing in 1998. The mall was demolished in 1999 in favor of a strip mall anchored by Safeway Inc., although the former J. C. Penney building remained until 2006. Tri-City Pavilions is owned and managed by Lamar Companies. History =Development= Malouf Construction and Development Co., a construction company founded by Phoenix, Arizona retail developer Grant Malouf, first proposed Tri-City Mall in 1963. He had tried to acquire land that the University of Arizona was using as an alfalfa farm, at the corner of West Main Street and Dobson Road, but instead chose a plot across the street when it became available. Malouf chose the site because he felt that Mesa, being a tourist destination, was a suitable market for a shopping mall. After acquiring the land, he negotiated with two department store chains, J. C. Penney and Phoenix-based Diamond's, to become the mall's anchor stores. The center's building costs were estimated at over $10 million. Glenn A. MacCollum was the mall's architect. The name \\"Tri-City Mall\\" referred to the three cities expected to draw the most business from the mall: Mesa, Tempe, and Chandler, although Malouf noted that the mall would be the first to service the eastern side of the Phoenix metropolitan area and would be convenient to shoppers from nearby cities such as Scottsdale. Grand- opening ceremonies were held on August 14, 1968, a year after construction started in July 1967. 34 of the 50 stores in the mall opened for business that day, including J. C. Penney; the Diamond's store was still under construction at the time, with a targeted opening date of late 1969. Malouf held the ribbon-cutting ceremonies that day, with other attendees including Arizona's then-governor Jack Williams and Mesa's then-mayor, Jack Taylor. Other major tenants of the mall included Piccadilly Restaurants, a Bashas' supermarket, a Walgreens drugstore, and an S. H. Kress variety store. One feature of the mall was a -tall fountain which propelled oil through nylon tubes to simulate the appearance of rain. Other features included 26 light fixtures made of redwood and suspended by chains, as well as dome-shaped skylights. Landscaping around the mall included olive, oleander, and cypress, while the inside of the mall featured palm trees in planters. It was also the only mall in Arizona at the time to feature carpeted flooring in its main entrance. =1980s-1990s: Decline= In 1979, Tri-City Mall began to face competition when Fiesta Mall opened closer to the Superstition Freeway (now part of US 60). During the 1979 Christmas season, many mall merchants such as B. Dalton had reported decreases in sales. Despite this, the mall had only one vacancy at the time, and no tenants had announced plans at the time to move to Fiesta Mall. However, by 1984, Diamond's chose to consolidate its operations into the store at Fiesta Mall, having already reduced operations to just the first level two years prior. In response, local developer Grossman Companies purchased the property from Malouf in late 1984 and announced a $2.5 million renovation plan. Renovations were finished by May 1985. Among the additions were the replacement of the flooring with tile, the addition of wrought iron lightpoles and park benches, and a new fountain. Following this renovation, only the former Diamond's and one other space in the mall were vacant. By 1987, portions of the former Diamond's building had been taken by local clothing store Winston's, as well as a Cigna health office, along with a food court and four-screen movie theater. The Bashas' also closed and was replaced by a Ben Franklin craft store in 1989. Zion's Co-operative Mercantile Institution (ZCMI), a Salt Lake City, Utah-based department store chain founded by Brigham Young, chose to open in the former Winston's space in 1990. The Tri-City Mall store was not only the chain's first in Arizona, but also among the first in a concept known as ZCMI II, which had debuted two years prior in Utah. This concept featured a smaller footprint than a traditional ZCMI store, selling solely men's and women's brand-name clothing and shoes while lacking other departments typically found in the chain's stores such as children's clothing, linens, housewares, and cosmetics. ZCMI II opened for business in February 1990. A further addition to the mall came in 1991 when Florida-based Bealls opened its first Arizona location there. Despite these additions, the mall continued to dwindle in tenancy throughout the 1990s; one 1993 article noted that Fiesta had \\"decimated\\" Tri-City Mall. By 1992, ZCMI had converted the Tri-City Mall store from the ZCMI II format to an outlet store. In 1996, another Phoenix-based developer named Rubin Cos. bought the mall from Grossman and announced further renovation plans. Rubin representatives noted that Tri- City Mall had continued to decline in tenancy following the opening of Superstition Springs Center in 1990, and would likely continue to lose business after Arizona Mills' opening in 1997; another factor in the mall's decline was its distance from a major freeway or direction of residential growth. Despite reducing rent costs, Rubin Cos. was unable to secure new tenants for the mall for these reasons. J. C. Penney closed its store at the mall in 1998; the store was profitable, but the chain did not want to sign a new long-term lease agreement, and it had been actively pursuing moving its store to a proposed expansion of Fiesta Mall. By the time of J. C. Penney's closure, only six tenants remained: Bealls, Walgreens, Radio Shack, GNC, Furr's cafeteria, and a clothing store called Western Village. J. C. Penney had stalled redevelopment proposals being made by the Rubin Cos.; after it departed, Rubin announced that the entire structure would be demolished, except for the J. C. Penney building, in favor of a new strip mall called Tri- City Pavilions. =Late 1990s-present: Redevelopment into Tri-City Pavilions= Reconstruction of the mall into Tri-City Pavilions ensued in 1999, with a Safeway supermarket confirmed that year as a new anchor store. Demolition of the old center featured a harrowing moment when a man's foot became pinned in an upside-down Bobcat loader. Tri-City Pavilions officially reopened for business in 2000, and was sold to J.G. Management in 2006. The last standing Tri-City Mall store, the former J. C. Penney building, was demolished in April 2006 to make way for the Sycamore/Main Street Valley Metro Rail transit station, which was the original eastern terminus of the rail line; the station features a park and ride parking lot north of Main Street and east of the new mall for light rail commuters to park their cars.

Kidd. The novel's eponymous narrator takes his name from James Lovelock, the scientist-inventor who formulated the Gaia Hypothesis, which figures heavily in the book. Plot introduction Lovelock is set in a near-future in which humanity is preparing to send out its first interstellar colonization ship, called the Ark. Lovelock, a genetically- and cybernetically-enhanced Capuchin monkey relates the story in the first person. Lovelock serves as the \\"Witness\\" for Carol Jeanne Cocciolone, meaning that his job is to record every waking moment of the life of a prominent member of society. As the chief Gaiaologist of the Ark, Carol Jeanne is responsible for managing the extensive terraforming their new planet will require, integrating the terrestrial species needed for the colonists' survival with the planet's existing ecology. In the speculative future described by the novel, a new field of science, Gaiaology, has come into existence, based on the Gaia Hypothesis. Like every Witness, Lovelock has been indoctrinated to love and obey his owner unconditionally. Plot summary When the book begins, the Cocciolone family is packing for their new life aboard the Mayflower. The family consists of Carol Jeanne, her husband Red, their daughters Lydia and Emmy, and Red's parents Mamie and Stef. They take a shuttle to the Ark, during which Lovelock is ashamed of his primitive, terrified response to free-fall. Aboard the Mayflower, the Cocciolone family begins to integrate themselves into the society of the Ark. When Lovelock meets a scientist who attempts to communicate with him via sign language, Carol Jeanne explains that she hadn't taught her Witness sign language because she didn't want him \\"chattering to [her] all the time.\\"Card, Orson Scott. Lovelock (1994): 104 This event marks Lovelock's first feelings of furious rebellion. Lovelock begins to long for a mate, and children of his own. After learning about a supply of cryogenically frozen capuchin monkeys, he steals a young female monkey and hides her in the low-gravity poles that support the Ark. Unfortunately, she grows up stunted and sickly. Lovelock, realizing that should his actions be discovered he would be put to death, begins to write his story in a hidden file on the Ark's computer.

His hands-on involvement with cars and trucks, including a stint as head of engineering at a leading automotive accessories manufacturer, led him to a career in journalism after he retired from racing. Titus has written over 350 articles or segments for several magazines, including Motor Trend (as Technical Editor), Popular Mechanics (as West Coast Automotive Editor), TNN (as NASCAR Editor), Muscle Mustangs and Fast Fords (as Engineering Editor), Road & Track (as Features Editor) and Sports Car magazine (as Technical Editor). In addition, Titus is a spokesman for Ford Motor Company and has appeared in several ad campaigns and product information videos for various Ford vehicles. He is a lifetime member of the American Automotive Racing Writers and Broadcasters Association (AARWBA) as well as a member of the Motor Press Guild. In 1990, Chuck Beck of Special Editions and Rick Titus took seven Ford Festivas, gutted the interiors, and mounted Ford SHO (Yamaha-built for the Taurus SHO) 3.0 liter V6s behind the front seats to make the car mid-engined. There were substantial cosmetic and mechanical changes, including relocating the gas tank to the front of the car, structural bracing and improvements to the chassis, adding wider wheel arches to accommodate a wider stance and larger tires, and a complete redesign of the suspension. These changes resulted in a car that could accelerate from in 4.6 seconds, travel the quarter-mile (0.4 km) in 12.9 seconds at , and could achieve a lateral acceleration figure ranging from .95 to 1.04 g. It was called the SHOgun.

The club is located in a historic building (St. George's Hall) at 14 Elm Street in downtown Toronto. Its premises were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2007.St. George's Hall (Arts and Letters Club), Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaSt. George's Hall (Arts and Letters Club), National Register of Historic Places History and background Social reunion for the York Pioneers at St. George Hall, 1911. The club was founded in 1908 by journalist Augustus Bridle, \\"Member # 1\\"! In 1920 it moved to its present quarters at St. George's Hall, which has a lounge, meeting rooms, a library, art studio, and a two-story faux gothic Great Hall for concerts, plays, lectures and meals. The club has been an important part of Canadian cultural life since its founding. The Group of Seven were all members and regularly met for lunch at the Club, as did composers Healey Willan and Sir Ernest MacMillan. The annual Boar's Head Dinner is believed to be the oldest event of its kind in North America, and the Club's constitution is unique in that every year it is sung at the annual general meeting to music specially composed by Willan. The club's artistic life revolves around its \\"LAMPS disciplines\\": Literature, Architecture, Music, Painting, and TheatreStage. These are very broadly defined and include sculpture, photography, film/radio and TV arts, screenwriting, urban planning and other related fields. The Club welcomes both Professional Members, whose careers have been associated with one of more of these; however, it also has many non-professional members, who appreciate and support the arts. Membership in the Arts & Letters Club encompasses not only a wide range of art practices, but also includes men and women in all age groups from early 20s, through every decade including a handful of lively and engaged members now in their 90s. The events offered by the Club include lunch time talks and concerts, dinners with speakers on subjects of current interest, film nights, stage performances, studio painting sessions three days a week, art exhibitions for members which rotate monthly, and in-Club groups interested in photography, writing and poetry. Attracting the younger crowd, are the lively Ad Lib nights each Friday, which host everything from performance art, to improv, jam sessions and games. The Club's fine art collection and wealth of archival material relates to its rich history. Throughout its century plus life-span, it has had well-established relationships with many equally influential fine arts and literary associations, and it has hosted many important art exhibitions. The building is protected under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act, designated by the City of Toronto since 1975. Members Arthur Goss photo of the Group of Seven at the club. From left: Varley, Jackson, Harris, friend Barker Fairley, Johnston, Lismer, MacDonald. Missing: Carmichael. Aside from the Group of Seven, Willan, and MacMillan, some other well-known members of the club were Hector Charlesworth, Robertson Davies, M. O. Hammond, George Locke, Charles William Jefferys, Mavor Moore and Owen Staples. Since its founding, two club members have become Nobel laureates (Frederick Banting and John Macleod), six have been knighted (including Banting and MacMillan) and, since 1967, more than 150 have been named to the Order of Canada. Archives The club's archives contains a wide variety of original material documenting membership and activities since its founding. The archives are open to scholars, historians, and other researchers. References Bibliography A history of the club was published in 2008.

He was born in Keppoch, Scotland in 1790 and joined the Royal Navy at the age of 13. He became a lieutenant while serving during the Napoleonic Wars; he later reached the rank of captain. He retired from the Navy in 1823 and came to Upper Canada in 1833 with his brother William \\"Tiger\\" Dunlop who was a general superintendent for the Canada Company. He was appointed a justice of the peace in the London District in the same year. In 1835, he was elected to the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada for the new riding of Huron. He tended to support the province's administration, including Lieutenant Governor Sir Francis Bond Head and was reelected in 1836. In 1837, he joined the Orange Lodge and became a member of its provincial executive in 1838. He was named a colonel in the Huron militia during the Upper Canada Rebellion, but his unit was not called to serve. He supported the redistribution of the clergy reserves among the Protestant churches and promoting immigration to Upper Canada. He also supported the campaign against slavery in the province. He died on the family estate near Goderich in 1841. Royal Navy Career Robert Graham Dunlop joined the Royal Navy in 1803. In 1810 he took the exam for the rank of Lieutenant. he was promoted to Lieutenant in 1812 and later to Commander in 1822. =Napoleonic Wars= In 1813, Lieutenant Dunlop, in command of HMS Porcupine, captured or destroyed a number of French craft which had run ashore near Talmont-sur- Gironde. With orders from Captain Trevenen Penrose Coode, Lieutenant Dunlop commanded the boats of HMS Porcupine (1807) in pursuit of a French flotilla. After the French flotilla ran ashore, Dunlop landed with a party of seamen and marines and captured significant French naval assets. Political Career in Canada In 1833 Robert Dunlop emigrated to Upper Canada with his brother William \\"Tiger\\" Dunlop. The two brothers settled in Goderich, Ontario and shortly after Robert Dunlop was appointed to two offices: * Justice of the Peace, London District (later the Huron Tract) As a justice of the peace in Upper Canada, one could be expected to issue warrants, conduct preliminary inquiries, investigate misdemeanours, try a variety of summary offences, and commit the convicted to jail. * Commissioner of the Court of Requests, London District (later the Huron Tract) A Court consisting of two or more Justices of the Peace authorized to try any claim not exceeding 40 shillings, Quebec currency. The system of Court of Requests was repealed in 1841, by 4 & 5 Vict., ch. 3, which provided for Division Courts. Regardless of the changes, many of the same people continued in the similar capacities in these positions; Robert Dunlop being of them. =Parliamentary Voting Record= Robert Dunlop's political career in the assembly was predominantly supportive of the Family Compact, although some of his views and votes were supportive of the Colborne Clique. * supported the Huron Fishing company,Peter A.

The school is administered by the Fayetteville Public Schools system, formerly headed by Paul Hewitt, who retired on June 30, 2016 and was replaced by Dr. Matthew Wendt. In July 2018, Dr. Wendt was replaced as superintendent of schools by Dr. John L Colbert. The school recently underwent massive rebuilding and expansion with designs by architect Marlon Blackwell.  History  The school was first opened in 1908, and the previous building was built in 1950, with further renovations made in the 1990s. Phase 1 of the current building opened in 2012, Phase 2 in 2013, and Phase 3 in 2014, with the final phase opening in 2015. The current building, built adjacent to the University of Arkansas and just off of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, is also located on the Trail of Tears National Historic Trail, as indicated by two roadside signs--one of them a government sign, the other a sign erected by the University. The school also has one of the best TV studios in the country, from which they air the Bulldog Show on Channel 14. The school expanded to grades 9-12 in 2015. The school was also the first school in Arkansas to voluntarily desegregate when, on September 11, 1954, African American students first attended the high school. The school's marching band was selected to go to the Tournament of Roses Parade for 2006, only the second time an Arkansas band has attended.  Academics  The assumed course of study follows the Smart Core curriculum developed by the Arkansas Department of Education (ADE). Students complete regular (core) and career focus courses and exams and may select Advanced Placement (AP) coursework and exams that provide an opportunity for students to receive college credit. In 2006, Fayetteville High School was named the 413th best high school in the nation according to the Newsweek magazine's Top 1200 US Schools . Public schools are ranked according to a ratio called the Challenge Index. In 2010, Fayetteville High School was recognized above all other Arkansas public high schools as having the most students enrolled in AP courses.  Band  The Fayetteville High School Band at a marching competition in Carthage, MO. The Fayetteville High School Marching Bulldog Band is under the direction of Barry Harper.

The Purple Bulldogs’ girls’ gymnastics team has won eight straight state championships, and the girls’ soccer team took four straight from 1998 to 2001, plus one in 2010. Since 1996 the boys’ basketball team has made five appearances in the state semifinals and went to the title game in March. Fayetteville has also won four state championships in indoor track, which is not a recognized sport in the state.\\" 2007 saw the Bulldogs win their first state football championship after 103 years of playing football, defeating Springdale Har-Ber 28-7 in Little Rock. Eight years later, they would duplicate the feat, defeating Har-Ber 28-7 again to claim their fourth state championship. In March 2009, FHS concluded undefeated seasons in both boys and girls basketball and won 7A state championships. The girls finished 32-0 while the boys finished 30-0, with the boys carding a No. 8 final national ranking. In December 2011, Fayetteville High's football team upset top-ranked Bentonville and broke their 25-game winning streak with a 29-28 overtime victory in War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock to win their second state football championship. On December 1, 2012, Fayetteville defeated Bentonville again in the 7A state championship game, 31-20, to become the first school in the 7A era to repeat as state champions.  Bullying controversy  On March 24, 2008, the New York Times ran an article accusing the administration and teachers of ignoring violence and bullying against Billy Wolfe, a sophomore who attended Fayetteville High School. After years of abuse, his parents filed a lawsuit against one of the bullies, and considered an additional lawsuit against the district, claiming that their son had been wrongly suspended and accused of being responsible for his own situation by school officials despite evidence that other students were responsible. Some students had set up a Facebook group titled \\"Every One Hates Billy Wolfe\\" calling on them to attack him at school. One entry by a student on March 9, 2007 wrote \\"\\"Haha (your ) Billy got clocked today at school and I think one or two of his teeth got knocked out damn my friends are awesome\\".\\" Fayetteville High School representatives responded by saying that, in these types of cases, if laws have been violated then the school reports the incident to the Fayetteville Police Department, and stated that the article was \\"casting our school district in a very bad and undeserved light.\\" However, police records, Wolfe's mother, and Fayetteville Police Department Cpl. Craig Stout said an assault report was eventually filed by the Wolfe family, not the school. Wolfe's mother claims she begged the assistant principal of the school, Byron Zeagler, to call the police. \\"He said my son got what he deserved.\\" Former Fayetteville Superintendent Bobby New said \\"We stand behind our administrators and believe they acted appropriately.\\" Students at Fayetteville High School, in reaction to perceived bias in the New York Times article, stated when being interviewed by the local news that Wolfe \\"brings a lot of it on himself, that he actually picks a lot of the fights\\" and \\"that what he does, is he antagonizes the other person and starts the fight and when he loses he says 'Oh I got beat up.'\\" In a local newspaper report the following week, a student claimed that Wolfe \\"likes to call him names, like stupid or retarded,\\" and \\"screams in his ear, which is sensitive to noise because of his medical condition…[Wolfe] once pounded him in the back of the head several times with a medium-sized rubber ball.\\" Following the story's publication, the Fayetteville School District has reported receiving both a threatening phone call to McNair Middle School and an email which \\"suggested the district would be hit with some sort of Internet or computer network attack.\\" A decade ago a student attending Fayetteville High School's Vocational Campus was harassed and beaten for being homosexual. At that time the administration of Fayetteville School District had promised the office of Civil Rights they would adopt procedures to promote tolerance and respect. Currently, Fayetteville High School has a Gay-Straight Alliance, which, in 2004 was picketed by members of the Westboro Baptist Church.

As a military officer, he served in both the British and French armies, as well as taking part in Jacobite rebellions in 1715 and 1745, and spent nearly 20 years in exile on the Continent. He was pardoned some years after the first rebellion but following the failure of the latter at Culloden he was taken prisoner, charged with treason, and executed at Tower Hill. Historians of the 1745 rising often refer to him simply as Lord Balmerino, although he did not inherit the title until January 1746 and was for most of his life styled \\"the Hon. Arthur Elphinstone\\". Life Arthur Elphinstone was the son of John Elphinstone, 4th Lord Balmerino and 3rd Lord Cupar, and his second wife, Anne Ross or Rose, daughter of Arthur Rose, Archbishop of St Andrews. The family were descended from James (c.1553–1612), a younger son of Robert Elphinstone, 3rd Lord Elphinstone: he had been granted the lands of Balmerino Abbey in Fife by James VI and I, though by the 18th century a series of lawsuits had reduced the family's properties to the barony of Restalrig in South Leith. The Elphinstones were prominent members of the Episcopalian minority of the Scottish church: the burying ground of the ruined church at Restalrig on their estate was used by local Episcopalians throughout the 18th century. Arthur had three half-brothers from his father's first marriage; Hugh, Master of Balmerino, who died in 1708 at the Siege of Lille, James (1675–1746), a lawyer and judge, and Alexander (d. 1733).Campbell, J. (1867) Balmerino and Its Abbey: A Parochial History, Paterson, p.391The New Peerage, v. II (1763), R. Davis, p.213 He was not initially expected to inherit the family estate and embarked on a military career, being commissioned a captain in Lord Shannon's regiment in March 1714.Henshaw, V. (2014) Scotland and the British Army, 1700–1750: Defending the Union, A&C; Black, p.106 As a north-eastern Episcopalian Protestant, Elphinstone has been described as epitomising the most \\"ideologically committed\\" Jacobite supporters.McLynn, F. (1985) The Jacobites, Routledge, p.88 Many Scottish Episcopalians were conservatives who believed the deposition of the Stuarts to have been a breach of natural order, and also opposed the 1707 Union of England and Scotland. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 he fought at the inconclusive Battle of Sheriffmuir on the government side but, reportedly finding this \\"against his conscience\\", deserted and joined the Jacobites.Henshaw, p.107 The rising subsequently collapsed and he fled the country, possibly to Denmark, before joining the French army. In 1733, Elphinstone's father obtained a pardon for him and he eventually returned to Scotland: about this time he married Margaret Chalmers or Chambers, daughter of a Captain Chalmers of Leith. His half-brother James succeeded to the title of Lord Balmerino on the death of their father in 1736. Elphinstone was one of the first to join Charles Edward Stuart during his 1745 attempt to recover the British throne for the Stuarts. While his history of Jacobite activity was undoubtedly a factor, some contemporaries also suggested the family's poor financial standing meant he had little to lose. Alongside David Wemyss, Lord Elcho he was given command of a troop of Charles' \\"Life Guard\\"; unlike nearly all other senior Jacobites, he escaped any criticism in the post-rising memoirs by various participants.MacKenzie Annand, A. \\"The Life Guards of Prince Charles Edward\\", Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol. 73, No. 293 (Spring 1995), 14–15 John Daniel, a colleague in 1745, recorded that Elphinstone's \\"sole and predominant passion\\" was \\"hard drinking\\", but paid tribute to his loyalty, courage, and gift for languages, noting that \\"his memory for his years was wonderful\\". He became the 6th Lord Balmerino in early 1746 following his half-brother James's death, but in April of the same year he was taken prisoner at the Battle of Culloden. Balmerino was tried before Parliament, along with William Boyd, 4th Earl of Kilmarnock and George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie. Given his history and previous pardon, he represented himself and offered little in the way of a defence, joking that he only pleaded not guilty in order \\"that so many ladies might not be disappointed of their show\\". He was found guilty, attainted and was beheaded on the same day as the Earl of Kilmarnock.The Gentleman's Magazine Published by F. Jefferies, volume 156 January–June 1834. p. 133 quoting the Letters of Horace Walpole to Sir Horace Mann. Execution of the Earl of Kilmarnock and Lord Balmerino Balmerino went to his execution unrepentant, stating \\"If I had a thousand lives, I would lay them all down in the same cause\\". His insouciant attitude at the time of his trial and execution, joking with bystanders and insisting on taking the axe in his carriage so that Kilmarnock would not be bothered by it, was widely reported in the media of the time.McKenzie, A. \\"Martyrs in Low Life? Dying “Game” in Augustan England\\", Journal of British Studies, Vol. 42, No. 2 (April 2003), 167–205 Horace Walpole, in a letter, described him as \\"the most natural brave old fellow I ever saw [...] at the bar he behaved like a soldier and a man: in the intervals of form, with carelessness and humour\\". Balmerino's execution is sometimes reported to have taken three blows, though \\"the first certainly took away all sensation\\". Like Kilmarnock he was buried in the Church of St Peter ad Vincula: reportedly, at his request, alongside William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine.

He was an independent candidate for President of the United States in the 1996 presidential election and sought unsuccessfully to run again in 2000. In 1960, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum for his contribution to cattle ranching. Bay County, Florida book controversy In 1986, Collins, who was a former Bay County, Florida school board official, challenged the use of I Am the Cheese and other books at the Mowat Junior High School his granddaughter attended. He wrote letters to the parents of all the students, and placed an advertisement in the Panama City News-Herald. At a school board meeting Collins submitted what he claimed was about 9,000 signatures petitioning the use of the book, though a television reporter later found the number to be 3,549.Green 249-252. The case's first national coverage came from The Washington Post, which in the cover story of the Sunday magazine section reported on the case and the death threats that had been received by the teachers and parents defending the book and by the television reporter, Hill. Hill's apartment was attacked by arson and a bomb threat placed on her car required the summoning of a police bomb squad, though the device proved to be a fake one. Commenting on the attacks, Collins dismissed the dummy bomb as a \\"joke\\" and the fire as \\"a good way to get your apartment painted by the landlord.\\"DelFattore 105. 1996 Presidential election Mother Jones magazine called Collins the \\"consummate internet candidate,\\" and opined that he appealed to an online population of \\"isolationists, alarmists, and conspiracy theorists.\\"\\"Charles Collins.\\" His campaign advocated abolishing the Federal Reserve and the Internal Revenue Service and other pledges noted to be similar to that of the U.S. Taxpayers Party ticket of Howard Phillips and Herbert Titus.Koli 1996. He initially sought the Republican Party nomination, qualifying for and receiving some votes in the Republican presidential primaries. He received a mere forty-two votes in the New Hampshire primary and still fell far behind the other candidates in other states where he did better; e.g. 628 votes in Texas and 451 in Oklahoma Collins withdrew from the Colorado primary after the ballots were printed.\\"1996 Boulder County\\" 1999. The Republican National Committee barred him from debates. Collins also sought, and failed to receive, the nomination of the United States Taxpayers Party. Collins then decided to run as an independent, receiving the endorsement of a group called C.U.R.E. led by the former Republican governor of Arizona Evan Mecham. C.U.R.E. endorsed Collins over other potential choices including former California State Assemblyman and State Senator Don Rogers, who would later be the presidential candidate of the American Party in the 2000 presidential election and John Yiamouyiannas, formerly a candidate of Take Back America who had received 2,199 votes in the 1992 presidential election. On August 21, 1996 Collins attempted to have the United States Supreme Court declare all state ballot access laws to be unconstitutional.Winger 1996. They declined his motion.Collins v.

David Ng (2014), \\"San Diego Opera will close, in 'a sign of the times'\\", Los Angeles Times, March 20, 2014 The company was founded in 1950 as the San Diego Opera Guild, originally to present traveling productions by San Francisco Opera in the San Diego area. SDO began to stage its own productions in 1965, its first one being La bohème. From the beginning, the company performed at the San Diego Civic Theatre in Downtown San Diego. Until the 2008 recession, it presented five operas each season; in 2008 this was reduced to four productions, scheduled from January to April. In March 2014 the opera board announced that the 2014 season would be its last,\\"SAN DIEGO OPERA TO CEASE OPERATIONS AFTER 2014 SEASON\\", company press release, March 19, 2014 but this decision was later rescinded by the company's board of directors, and a cut down version of the already planned 2015 season was announced, reducing the number of titles from four to three.David Ng, \\"San Diego Opera reverses decision to close, announces 2015 season\\", Los Angeles Times, May 19, 2014 David Bennett of the Gotham Chamber Opera was hired as general director. Administration The founding SDO general director was Walter Herbert, who served in that position from 1965 until his death in 1975. Tito Capobianco served as general director from 1976 to 1983, during which time he \\"expanded the season to six productions, featuring renowned superstars such as Joan Sutherland, Luciano Pavarotti and Beverly Sills\\", as well as beginning an annual two-opera Verdi Festival which ceased in 1984 after his departure. Between 1983 and 2014, the general director was Ian Campbell who achieved considerable success as well as creating financial stability for the company. Campbell left the company in May 2014, following his contentious recommendation to shut down the opera. Since 2015 the general director has been David Bennett. =Proposal to close the company, March/April 2014= On March 19, 2014, the opera's board of directors voted to cease operations after its final performance on April 13, 2014, citing diminishing audiences and increasing costs.Beth Accomando, Megan Burke, Tarryn Mento (2014), \\"San Diego Opera Announces Current Season Will Be Its Last\\", KPBS, March 19, 2014 The announcement came as a shock to the public, because the company has no debt and had given no hint it was contemplating closure; director Campbell explained that the board decided to \\"wind down with dignity and grace\\" rather than become bankrupt.James Chute (2014), \\"San Diego Opera votes to fold\\", San Diego Union-Tribune, March 19, 2014 However, at a special board meeting on March 31, the board voted to delay the closure until April 29, to allow more time for major donors to come forward and to consider other options that could possibly save the 2015 season. Meanwhile, the labor union representing singers, chorus members and production personnel filed several complaints with the National Labor Relations Board about the decision to cease operation. In a dramatic meeting on April 17, the opera's board of directors voted to extend the shutdown deadline at least until May 19. The chairman of the board and twelve other board members resigned. Board member Carol Lazier was chosen as acting president; she proposed that the opera reorganize rather than shut down. The national organization Opera America was reported to be working with board members to come up with a list of possible savings and reforms. On April 25 it was announced that director Campbell and his ex-wife, who was also a high-ranking administrator with the opera, had both been placed on paid administrative leave. On May 15 the board reported that Campbell and his former wife were leaving the company.David Ng, \\"San Diego Opera officially parts ways with director Ian Campbell\\", Los Angeles Times, May 15, 2014 At a meeting of the board of directors on May 16, the group voted to rescind the decision to close.

In March 2015 the company announced the hiring of David Bennett, executive director of the Gotham Chamber Opera, as General Director of the San Diego Opera. He started on June 15, 2015. He was \\"tasked with downsizing and reimagining the company for 21st century audiences.\\" He cut the company's budget from $18 million in 2014 to $10 million in 2018 and established a schedule of three traditional opera productions each year, along with a \\"Detour series\\" of smaller, more innovative works and increased community outreach programs.

Early life and service Friedrich Theodor Noltenius was born in Bremen on 8 January 1894, the son of a Professor of Medicine. The younger Noltenius graduated from high school in Bremen. The war then interrupted his medical studies.Above the Lines: The Aces and Fighter Units of the German Air Service, Naval Air Service and Flanders Marine Corps, 1914–1918, p. 174 Noltenius enlisted in Field Artillery Regiment No. 13 at the outbreak of war, on 4 August 1914. He served on the Eastern Front from December 1914. In December, he transferred to the Western Front in France. He was commissioned as an officer in October 1916 and was wounded on 16 April 1917. Aerial service See also Aerial victory standards of World War I Noltenius' weapon was a Fokker D.VII. Noltenius' first air combat was with a Bréguet XIV. A Sopwith Dolphin was Noltenius' first confirmed victim. An Airco de Havilland DH.4 was Noltenius' final victim. Noltenius' end came in a takeoff accident in a similar Bücker Bü 131. It is unknown when he transferred to flying service, but he began aviation training on 3 November 1917. In February 1918, he began flight training. By early June, he was flying his first combat missions with Flieger-Abteilung (Artillerie) 234. After only a brief spell of directing artillery fire upon the enemy, he was sent to fighter training in late June. Upon graduation, he was assigned to Jagdstaffel 27, one of the squadrons commanded by Bruno Loerzer in his Jagdgeschwader III. Once he received his own Fokker D.VII, he had his personal insignia painted on it. He chose an elaborate display of red and white, with checkerboards and stripes both encircling the fuselage in a wide band and painted on the upper wing above the cockpit. His sister's name, Hertha, was on the side of the cockpit.Aces of Jagdgeschwader Nr III, pp. 37, 41. On 16 July, an exceptionally hot spell of weather settled in--so hot that it sometimes detonated incendiary bullets within cockpits. Flying in this killing weather Noltenius found himself one of three German pilots attacking a French Breguet 14 on the 18th. As he wrote in his diary:Aces of Jagdgeschwader Nr III, p. 54 > \\"Alternately, I was over him or under him and behind him...anyway, at an > altitude of 2500 metres I took good aim and pressed the trigger. Then a body > broke free of the seat and the observer fell out. It was an abominable > sight, and I can only say that I was extremely sorry for the poor devil....\\" The horror of his machine gunning the observer to death was compounded by his commanding officer, after they landed. According to him, unseen by Noltenius, the French pilot had futilely raised his arms to surrender. Also, Noltenius' combat claim of a victory was denied; the triumph was given to another pilot. On 3 August 1918, Noltenius pushed through drizzly weather to attack an enemy observation balloon. The gasbag was too wet for his incendiary bullets to set it alight. Noltenius chalked the failure up to experience.Aces of Jagdgeschwader Nr III, p. 57 His first victory was over a Sopwith Dolphin, on 10 August. His second win, ten days later, initiated him into the ranks of balloon busters as he destroyed an observation balloon. By 2 September, he was an ace, scoring his fifth and sixth triumphs.Aces of Jagdgeschwader Nr III, p. 175 On 3 September, Noltenius claimed another victory, only to find it was being double-claimed. The other claimant, the experienced ace Hermann Frommherz, was Noltenius' commanding officer. He took credit, and denied Noltenius. The next day, another double claim--and again the decision went against Noltenius. Outraged, he requested transfer to another squadron.Aces of Jagdgeschwader Nr III, pp. 77-80 He survived being blown out of the sky on 14 September, when he attacked a booby-trapped balloon full of high explosives that singed much of the fabric from his plane's wings, and left melted balloon fabric trailing from his airplane. He was lightly wounded the next day.Aces of Jagdgeschwader Nr III, pp. 80-81 He was also shot down on the 22nd by American ace George Vaughn, but survived. On 29 September, his requested transfer came through, and he shifted to Jagdstaffel 6. By this time, Noltenius had successfully claimed victory over another four enemy airplanes and three more balloons, raising his score to 13, with one pending. He shot down another balloon, and a Sopwith Camel in his new squadron. Then a clash with Ulrich Neckel, his commanding officer, led to another move, this time within the Flying Circus, to the Royal Prussian Jagdstaffel 11. He scored thrice for his new squadron on 23 October. Three more singleton victories, on 28 October, 3 and 4 November, closed out his career as an ace-his 21st and last credited victory was over a bomber crew of the American 11th Aero Squadron. He had flown 141 combat sorties by war's end. On 8 November, he received the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern. His twentieth victory qualified him for the Pour le Mérite, but the Armistice three days later scotched his award. Postwar life After the war he fought against the communists attempting to take over Germany. Then he completed his studies to become a doctor. Once he qualified as a doctor, he moved his family to South America. He returned to Germany in 1933, and again took up flying. In 1936, Noltenius was asked by Luftwaffe historians to contribute his extensive diaries to the archives because Jagdeschwader III the wing's war diary was incomplete. He obliged them. As a result, the wing's total air victories during its nine months of existence was found to amount to about 370 enemy aircraft destroyed. Just before 2 PM on 1 March 1936, Friedrich Noltenius took off from Johannisthal Air Field near Berlin. He crashed his Bücker Bü 131 biplane and died en route to hospital. His writings His war diary and military service record (Kriegsranglisten- Auszug) was published in the Cross and Cockade Journal, Volume 7, Number 4 (Winter 1966).

Biography Swiney née Biggs was born in Poona, India, but spent most of her childhood in Ireland. In 1871 she married Major John Swiney (1832–1918), and devoted herself to becoming a full-time wife and mother. Swiney relocated to Cheltenham, Gloucestershire in 1877, a place she described later in her life as \\"the town of no ideals\\", where her husband joined her ten years later. Since 1890, Swiney was a feminist activist, lecturer, and writer in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. She co-founded the Cheltenham Women's Suffrage Society (Cheltenham WSS) in 1896; was Vice President of the Cheltenham Food Reform and Health Association; and lectured in organisations such as the Higher Thought Centre in London, Theosophical lodges, and Ethical Societies. Swiney was a member of the Theosophical Society (TS), the Sociological Society, the National Union of Women Workers (NUWW), the Eugenics Education Society, the Secular Education League, the Woman's Freedom League (WFL), and the National Woman's Social and Political Union (WSPU), as well as of the council of the Woman's Branch of the International Neo-Malthusian League. Swiney was personally connected to various prominent and important figures of her time, such as Charlotte Despard, Harriet McIlquham, Charlotte Stopes, Margaret Sibthorpe, Elizabeth Wolstenholme Elmy, and Annie Besant. Since 1910, her books were co-published by the League of Isis, which she founded in 1909. The League of Isis aimed to bring about \\"the betterment of the Race, by individual observance of the Natural Law of reproduction (…) for the building up of the Higher Self\\". This organisation, together with her writings, reflects a deep engagement in theosophical teachings: the belief in a spiritual evolution and in the Divine Mother (Isis), as well as the convincement that Theosophy can overcome the boundaries between science and religion. Swiney died on 2 May 1922.  Theosophy, motherhood and feminism  Contemporary conceptions of motherhood and race strongly influenced Frances Swiney, the theosophist, feminist, and eugenicist. Like other feminists at that time, she reversed the negative connotations of womanhood and motherhood and used it for her own argumentation, to fight for women's enfranchisement. Swiney claimed justice for women as \\"aiders in creating the wealth of the nation and as mothers of the race\\". Swiney's feminist emphasis on motherhood, race, and evolution also influenced her interpretations of Theosophy. This is the reason why Swiney focussed on one particular aspect of theosophical thought: the Divine Feminine, or the Divine Mother, as personated by the Goddess Isis, and her role in the cosmic process. Herein, Swiney's theosophical concepts differ from mainstream Theosophy. This is evidence for her own, personal, feminist agenda within an esoteric framework. > The Mother, then, is the Supreme Unity, uniting all in Herself. It is not > difficult why in the eternal sequence of things in evolution the human race > is awakening to the truth of the Divine Feminine in the present stage of the > world history. (…) Relatively speaking, the race, still in its immature > youth, expelled the Mother from the nursery, and anarchy and chaos > prevailed, (…). The evolved soul has always known that this intense craving > for union once more with the Feminine Principle must be the first sign of > the regenerate heart. For her, the Divine Mother was oneness of the sublime cause, and all emanation would derive from her and return to her in the end of the circled cosmic process: > For the soul is the feminine creative principle in man (…). The Feminine is > therefore the inner nature of man, and woman (…), the objective > representative of the Divine Feminine. Swiney's imperial context (personal and family connections to British India) influenced her perception and interpretation of Theosophy and, therefore, her theosophical feminism. Furthermore, Theosophy, and esotericism in general, were deeply embedded in the discourse of Britain's First Wave Feminism, as it is evident especially by the vast number of theosophical feminists.

She was an illegitimate daughter of King James IV of Scotland who served as governess to her half- niece Mary, Queen of Scots. Janet was briefly a mistress of King Henry II of France, by whom she had a legitimated son: Henri d'Angoulême.Robert J. Sealy, The Palace Academy of Henry III, (Droz, 1981), 206. Her daughter, Mary Fleming, was one of the young queen's \\"Four Marys\\". Family Janet Stewart (also referred to as Jane, Jenny, and other variants) was the eighth known bastard of the Stewart king James IV. Her half-brothers included James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray; Alexander Stewart, Lord Chancellor of Scotland; and James V, King of Scots, her father's only surviving legitimate child. Her mother—the fourth royal mistress of James IV to bear his offspring—was Isabel, daughter of James Stewart, 1st Earl of Buchan (who bore the nickname \\"Hearty James\\").Norman MacDougall, James IV of Scotland Janet's parents were distantly related (precisely, half second cousins once removed) by a common ancestor: Joan Beaufort, Queen of Scots. Marriage and issue Janet Stewart married Malcolm Fleming, 3rd Lord Fleming, despite being related within a forbidden degree of affinity. They had eight children: # Johanna (born 1525) # Janet (born 1527), who was first married to John, Master of Livingston, killed at the battle of Pinkie 1547, eldest son of Alexander Livingston, 5th Lord Livingston, and a brother of Mary Livingston, one of Queen Mary's \\"Four Marys\\" # Margaret Fleming (born by 1532), who married Robert Graham, Master of Montrose, by whom she had a son, John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose; then was remarried to Thomas Erskine, Master of Erskine (younger brother of the John Erskine, 6th Lord Erskine), but had no issue; and thirdly, married John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl, by whom she had a son John Stewart, 5th Earl of Atholl and three daughters.

The following year, presumably due to her unofficial membership in the royal Stewart family, the widow Fleming was appointed governess or nurse to her infant half-niece Mary, Queen of Scots (her new mistress having been fathered by her late half-brother). Her own daughter, Mary Fleming, also joined the queen's household as a lady-in- waiting. In August 1548, mother and daughter accompanied the young queen to France. They waited aboard ship on the Clyde at Dumbarton Castle for a time. Lady Fleming asked Captain Villegaignon if the queen could go back ashore to rest. Villegaignon swore she would go to France or drown on the way.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 157. The Bishop of Orkney, Robert Reid, expressed worry over the lady's lack of French; as Janet was only fluent in Scots, he questioned her ability to communicate to French doctors any potential symptoms of illness seen in Mary.Pollen, John Hungerford, ed., Papal Negotiations of Mary Queen of Scots, SHS (1901), p.414, Reid to Giovanni Ferreri, 26 December 1548. At the royal court of France, the lady Janet soon attracted the attentions of King Henry II and became his lover. Their affair resulted in pregnancy, and—either before or after bearing the French monarch an illegitimate son—Janet was sent back to Scotland and replaced as governess to Mary by Françoise de Paroy. Her boy, called Henri de Valois-Angoulême (1551-June, 1586), was \\"the chief and most highly favored natural son of the King\\". He was legitimized and went on to become the \\"Grand Prior of France, Governor of Provence, and Admiral of the Levantine Sea.\\"Riddell 1843, pp. 47-51. In November 1549 the English prisoner James Wilford was exchanged for the release of her son James Lord Fleming who had been captured during the war of the Rough Wooing.HMC Manuscripts of the Duke of Rutland, vol. 4 (London, 1905), pp. 194-197. In October 1552, Janet's situation in Scotland was described by Mary of Guise in a letter written to her brother, the Cardinal of Lorraine. There had been talk of marrying Janet off to Henri Cleutin, Guise's military advisor. Although one of Janet's daughters had informed Mary of Guise that her mother did not wish to leave Scotland, Guise knew that Janet had discussed leaving Scotland with the Governor, Regent Arran, and wanted to see Henry II that winter. Guise told the Cardinal to reassure Catherine de' Medici, the queen of France, that Janet would not be leaving Scotland.Calendar State Papers Spain, vol. 10 (London, 1914), p. 588. Janet was one of the ladies who kept vigil over the body of Mary of Guise at Edinburgh Castle in June 1560. The ladies were not at first given mourning clothes, and Janet quoted in Latin a phrase from the Book of Joel to the English diplomat Thomas Randolph, \\"Scindite corda vestra, non vestimenta,\\" Rend your heart, not your garments.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 429, (Joel. ii. 13) Afterwards, Janet applied to the Privy Council for permission to leave Scotland with her son \\"Lord Hary de Valoys\\" on 22 August 1560. Henry took part in the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre and was killed in a duel in 1586.Riddell 1843, pp. 49-50 (citing a transcript of the Privy Council record in the Cotton library).

Life Welf III was the only son of the Swabian count Welf II of Altdorf (died 1030) and Imiza,Jordan, Heinrich der Löwe, p. 4. a daughter of Count Frederick of Luxembourg and niece of the later empress Cunigunde of Luxembourg.Renn, Das erste Luxemburger Grafenhaus, pp. 137ff. His sister Kunigunde of Altdorf (1054) married Margrave Albert Azzo II, of Milan, a member of the Italian House of Este, and became the ancestor of the House of Welf-Este of (Younger) House of Welf. Upon the death of his father, Welf III succeeded him in the family's extended estates in Swabia and Bavaria. Through the intervention of his aunt, Richlind of Altdorf, he also inherited the property of her late husband Count Adalbero II of Ebersberg in 1045.Schneidmüller, Die Welfen, pp. 123-124; Dopsch, 'Welf III,' pp. 96-97 Probably through his mother, Imiza's, intervention Emperor Henry III enfeoffed Welf in 1047 with the Duchy of Carinthia and the adjacent March of Verona, which after the death of Duke Conrad the Younger in 1039 both had been held personally by the Salian emperor.Dopsch, 'Welf III und Kärnten,' p. 101. Together with Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia, Welf accompanied Emperor Henry III on his 1051 campaign against King Andrew I of Hungary.Klaar, Die Herrschaft der Eppensteiner, p. 98. Later however, he turned against the emperor and got involved in a conspiracy around the deposed Duke Conrad I of Bavaria, who with Hungarian support raided the Carinthian March of Styria. A plot to assassinate Henry failed, when Duke Welf became confined to his sickbed and revealed the plans. Welf III never married and had no children when he died at his castle in Bodman on Lake Constance on 13 November 1055.Steindorff, Jahrbücher, II, p. 319. He bequeathed his property to Weingarten Abbey in Altdorf, where his mother was abbess.Schneidmüller, Die Welfen, p. 127 She in turn gave the property to Duke Welf I of Bavaria, the son of Welf III's sister Kunigunde and Margrave Albert Azzo II of Milan.Störmer, 'Die Welfen in der Reichspolitik,' p. 261. Welf III was the last male heir of the Elder Welfs, his patrimonial lands went to the senior branch of the House of Este and the Younger House of Welf. In 1057 Emperor Henry's widow Agnes of Poitou ceded the Carinthian duchy to the Ezzonid scion Conrad III. Welf was buried at Weingarten Abbey. Notes References *E.

It stars Carmen Electra, Daniel Letterle, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Adam West, C. Ernst Harth, Chelan Simmons, Chris Harrison, Joe Macleod, Alani Vasquez, Alana Husband, Jeff Geddis, Cascy Beddow, and Nick Carter.  Plot  The film begins with a high school senior, Josh, who is stunned to see that he unknowingly won an MTV contest to see Carmen Electra, and it was actually his sister, Jen, who won the contest and invites everyone they know in their school. Josh and his classmates arrive on an isolated island (which is later revealed to be located in the Bermuda Triangle) where they have an enormous party, but Josh, who has been dumped by his girlfriend, is not really into the fun. Despite having his best friends Andy and Stack with him, he is angry that Jen, who wanted her brother to have an awesome time, scammed him. After catching a quick glimpse of a flying winged ant, Josh and Jen get backstage passes to see Carmen Electra. Josh then finds himself attracted to the singer. Later on, a concert featuring Carmen begins and Josh dances with joy. Suddenly, the flying ant Josh saw earlier appears before the crowd, sending everyone into a panic, and heads toward the stage. Eightball, Carmen's bodyguard, is grabbed by the insect followed by Carmen. Josh then watches as the flying ant takes Carmen to a faraway mountain (which later turns out to be a volcano) after dropping Eightball. The partygoers, terrified, attempt to call on their cell-phones but are cut off from the mainland, and despite the assured announcements by Bob Staton, they then start to leave on the boats. However, Josh, who thinks he can go and rescue Carmen, halts them and manages to convince them to join him but thanks to statements by Staton, they leave for real. Josh, Andy, Stack, and Jen then prepare for the journey, but before going, they are joined by Lil Mindi, who is determined to highlight her career, and her cameraman GT as well as Josh's ex-girlfriend Maddy and her new boyfriend, arrogant class president Chase. As the gang travel into the jungle, Stack climbs up a tree after settling down the arguing group and catches a glimpse of the mountain before falling down. Eightball appears, having fell on the tree after being dropped, and faithfully joins the group's search for Carmen. Before moving on, Maddy finds a mysterious necklace and wears it, which leads her to point out to the mountain. The group heads further down, encounters a gigantic praying mantis, and escapes with a canoe on a lake. On the other hand, Carmen awakens to find herself deep within the mountain and is held prisoner. The group camps out, and are attacked by a fish-like monster (Piranha Man), which kills GT. The creature is then tranquilized by a mysterious man in a white suit. He introduces himself as Dr. Harryhausen, who leads them to an abandoned United States military base and tells them that he has been on the island for many years while he reveals that the island was once home to a tribe of prehistoric humans that disappeared and the military attempted to claim this land but to no avail. The doctor also says that the monsters that the gang has encountered have been transformed thanks to radioactive bombs dropped on the island, and warns them that the island, polluted and dumped with toxic waste, will soon sink to the bottom of the ocean. Josh and company take the doctor's advice and continue. They then see that Maddy is acting strangely heroic and determined, and shows them the way to the mountain. The team then hide from a pair of praying mantises, and flee from the female which killed its mate. Josh and the others cross a bridge, and Eightball sacrifices himself to save the others by using a bulldozer to knock down the mantis down the ledge and him along with it. Panicked, Chase yells about the dangers they may face and Maddy rejects him furiously. Upon reaching the mountain, Josh, Stack, Andy, Maddy, and Jen arm themselves before heading up. Meanwhile, Chase abandons Lil Mindi, who is then eaten by a monstrous spider, and takes her camera footage. Josh and the remaining group reach the top, and Josh manages to kill an attacking soldier ant with his makeshift bow and arrow. They see Dr. Harryhausen who decides to join them, and go into the mountain. In there, they see the queen ant and her underlings order a group of ancient people, revealed to be the disappeared tribe, to bring food to a pile and discover Carmen, who is being worshipped. Maddy, revealed as an incarnation of the island's goddess, uses the necklace to break the tribe free from control of the ants, and they retaliate. Eventually, the gang manage to get out of the volcano with Carmen while Harryhausen remains behind and uses an explosive to destroy the attacking queen along with himself. Soon enough, the island begins to shake and Josh then grabs the necklace from Maddy, bringing her back to her senses. However, the boat waiting for Lil Mindi left, and just when hope seems to be lost, a helicopter carrying Nick Carter arrives and saves the group and a couple of ancient people. In the helicopter on the way home, Rudy, a creature left in the care of the group, comes along and Josh and Maddy renew their relationship. The film ends with Chase being left behind, and he is then pursued by the Piranha Man.

Notes on the State of Virginia (1785) is a book written by American statesman, philosopher and planter Thomas Jefferson. He completed the first version in 1781, and updated and enlarged the book in 1782 and 1783. Notes on the State of Virginia originated in Jefferson's responding to questions about Virginia, posed to him in 1780 by François Barbé-Marbois, then Secretary of the French delegation in Philadelphia, the temporary capital of the United Colonies. Notes on the State of Virginia is both a compilation of data by Jefferson about the state's natural resources and economy, and his vigorous argument about the nature of the good society, which he believed was incarnated by Virginia. He expressed his beliefs in the separation of church and state, constitutional government, checks and balances, and individual liberty. He wrote extensively about slavery, his dislike of race-mixing, a justification of white supremacy, and his belief that whites and blacks could not co-exist in a society where the black population was free. It was the only full-length book which Jefferson published during his lifetime. He first published it anonymously in Paris in 1785, where he was serving the US government as trade representative. John Stockdale published the book in London in 1787, after Jefferson came to terms for a limited print run and other arrangements. Publication and contents Notes was anonymously published in Paris in a limited, private edition of two hundred copies in 1785. A French translation (by the Abbé Morellet) appeared in 1786. Its first public edition, issued by John Stockdale in London, began to be sold in 1787. It was the only full-length book by Jefferson published during his lifetime, though he did issue a Manual of Parliamentary Practice for the Use of the Senate of the United States, generally known as Jefferson's Manual, in 1801.Bernstein, 2004, p. 78 Notes includes some of Jefferson's most memorable statements of belief in such political, legal, and constitutional principles as the separation of church and state, constitutional government, checks and balances, and individual liberty. He celebrated the resources of Virginia. Overall, Jefferson was arguing with the proposition of the French naturalist Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, who in his authoritative Histoire Naturelle said that nature, plant life, animal life, and human life degenerate in the New World by contrast with their state in the Old World.Lee Alan Dugatkin, Mr. Jefferson and the Giant Moose: Natural History in Early America, 2009, Jefferson notes the 1648 work of scientists Georg Marcgraf and Willem Piso, whose work on natural history in Dutch Brazil resulted in the Historia Naturalis Brasiliae, arguing that the honey bee was not native to North America.Neil Safier, \\"Beyond Brazilian Nature: The Editorial Itineraries of Marcgraf and Piso's Historia Naturalis Brasiliae\\", in Michiel Van Groesen, The Legacy of Dutch Brazil, New York: Cambridge University Press 2014, p. 171. Outline The text is divided into 23 chapters, which Jefferson termed \\"Queries,\\" each describing a different aspect of the state of Virginia. # Boundaries of Virginia # Rivers # Sea Ports # Mountains # Cascades # Productions mineral, vegetable and animal # Climate # Population # Military force # Marine force # Aborigines # Counties and towns # Constitution # Laws # Colleges, buildings, and roads # Proceedings as to Tories # Religion # Manners # Manufactures # Subjects of commerce # Weights, Measures and Money # Public revenue and expenses # Histories, memorials, and state-papers Jefferson on freedom of speech and secular government Notes on the State of Virginia contained Jefferson's firm belief in citizen's rights to express themselves freely without fear of government or church reprisal and that government's role is only secular and should not have anything to do with religion.Thomas Jefferson, Notes on Virginia 1785 This led later to charges of atheism leveled at him by his opponents in Federalist newspapers leading up to the nasty election of 1800.Ellis, Joseph. \\"American Sphinx\\". p.101-103, They quoted his European-published Notes on Virginia as proof that he was Godless. Jefferson wrote in Notes on Virginia, addressing the authority of government and laws: > The legitimate powers of government extend to such acts only as are > injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there > are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. > Jefferson believed the only legitimate role of government was to prevent > injury to others. But to deny the existence of god or believe in 20 Gods was > none of the state's business. Yet, in Query XVIII, he also wrote, addressing the presumed retribution for lack of theistic respect: > Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we have removed their > only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of the people that these > liberties are the gift of God? That they are not to be violated but with his > wrath? Indeed I tremble for my country when I reflect that God is just: that > his justice cannot sleep forever ... Biographer Joseph J. Ellis reveals that Jefferson didn't think the work would be known in the U.S. since he did not publish it in North America and kept his authorship anonymous in Europe. He exchanged letters with friends worried what they would think about his authorship of such a religious heresy. They supported him in response. Jefferson did not respond at all to the mud- slinging charges. He won the 1804 presidential election anyway, but those charges of atheism and the charges of an affair with his 15-year-old slave Sally Hemmings published in newspapers by Federalists supporters put his belief in a free press and free speech to the test. His predecessor John Adams angrily counter-attacked the press and vocal opponents by passing chilling Alien and Sedition Acts. Jefferson, by contrast, worked tirelessly to overturn what he viewed as tyrannical limits on free speech and free press, except for when he asked Thomas McKean, governor of Pennsylvania, to have Federalist newspapermen indicted for libel, claiming that it was necessary to prevent licentious abuses of free speech.G.S. Rowe, Thomas McKean: The Shaping of an American Republicanism (Boulder, CO: Colorado Associated University Press, 1978), 339-40. Joseph Dennie, publisher of the Federalist Port Folio, was targeted, ostensibly for professing the futility of democracy; Rowe argues that he was actually indicted over his unsubtle attacks on Jefferson's unseemly sexual relationship with slave Sally Hemings. He later lamented the anguish caused by his political enemies; however, he never denied the charges made by them, including those in Notes on Virginia, and he never gave up his fight for \\"Republican principles\\" to shield the common man from state or religious oppression.Ellis, Joseph. \\"American Sphinx\\". p.101-103, Jefferson and slavery In \\"Laws,\\" (Query XIV-14) Jefferson redirected questions about slavery by focusing the discussion to Africans, referring to what he called \\"the real distinctions which nature has made\\" between people of European descent and people of African descent. He later expressed his opposition to slavery in \\"Manners\\" (Query XVIII-18). Jefferson's proposal for resettling freed blacks in a colony in Africa expressed the mentality and anxieties of some American slaveholders after the American Revolutionary War; this contrasted with rising sentiment among some other American slavers to emancipate their slaves, seeing the hypocrisy in fighting for independence while holding thousands of Africans in bondage. Numerous northern states abolished slavery altogether. Several southern states, including Virginia in 1782, made manumissions easier. So many slaveholders in Virginia freed slaves between the 1780s and the 1800s (sometimes by will and others during their lifetime) that the number of free blacks in Virginia rose from about 1800 in 1782 to 30,466, or 7.2 percent of the total black population in 1810.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery, 1619-1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1993, p. 81 In the Upper South, more than 10 percent of blacks were free by 1810; in northern states, more than three-quarters of blacks were free by that date. However, millions of slaves still remained in bondage in the South, and freedmen faced high levels of racism towards themselves in the North. The southern states would only abolish slavery following the American Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation.Kolchin (1993), p. 81 In \\"Laws,\\" Jefferson wrote: > It will probably be asked, Why not retain and incorporate the blacks into > the state, and thus save the expense of supplying, by importation of white > settlers, the vacancies they will leave? Deep rooted prejudices entertained > by the whites; ten thousand recollections, by the blacks, of the injuries > they have sustained; new provocations; the real distinctions which nature > has made; and many other circumstances, will divide us into parties, and > produce convulsions which will probably never end but in the extermination > of the one or the other race. Some slave-owners feared race wars could ensue upon emancipation, due not least to natural retaliation by blacks for the injustices under long slavery. Jefferson may have thought his fears justified after the revolution in Haiti, marked by widespread violence in the mass uprising of slaves against white colonists and free people of color in their fight for independence. Thousands of white and free people of color came as refugees to the United States in the early 1800s; many brought their slaves with them. In addition, uprisings such as that of Gabriel in Richmond, Virginia, were often led by literate blacks. Jefferson and some other slaveholders embraced the idea of \\"colonization\\": arranging for transportation of free blacks to Africa, regardless of their being native-born and having lived in the United States. In 1816 the American Colonization Society was founded in a collaboration by abolitionists and slaveholders. Jefferson also stated his belief in which he thought blacks were inferior to whites in terms of beauty, intelligence, artistry, imagination, and odor. Jefferson believed that the color of the skin was the primary difference between African Americans and Europeans in relation to beauty. He writes in \\"Laws,\\" \\"The first difference which strikes us is that of colour.\\" Jefferson believed that skin color was the foundation of \\"greater or lesser\\" beauty between the two races. Body symmetry and hair texture were other categories for determining beauty, according to Jefferson. He adds, > The improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in the first instance of > their mixture with the whites, has been observed by every one, and proves > that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of life. In \\"Manners,\\" Jefferson wrote that slavery was demoralizing to both White and Black society and that man is an \\"imitative animal.\\" Jefferson and the Navy Jefferson included discussion on the potential naval capacity of America, given its extensive natural resources. This section was subsequently used by Federalist William Loughton Smith to embarrass Republican anti- navalists during debate in 1796, over whether or not to continue construction on the original six frigates of the United States Navy. Smith claimed that he was not the only person to believe that commerce required a navy to protect it, and read a lengthy extract from Jefferson's Notes to prove that the country was capable of supporting a much larger navy than the Federalists wanted to build. This occasioned Republican accusations that Smith had taken Jefferson out of context, or claims that Jefferson was mistaken in his understanding.Annals of Congress, 5th Congress, 2nd session, 2141-2147. Jefferson on climate Chapter 7 contains Jefferson's observations on the climate of Virginia, including local warming: \\"A change in our climate however is taking place very sensibly. Both heats and colds are become much more moderate within the memory even of the middle-aged. Snows are less frequent and less deep. They do not often lie, below the mountains, more than one, two, or three days, and very rarely a week. They are remembered to have been formerly frequent, deep, and of long continuance. The elderly inform me the earth used to be covered with snow about three months in every year. The rivers, which then seldom failed to freeze over in the course of the winter, scarcely ever do so now. This change has produced an unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold, in the spring of the year, which is very fatal to fruits. From the year 1741 to 1769, an interval of twenty-eight years, there was no instance of fruit killed by the frost in the neighbourhood of Monticello. An intense cold, produced by constant snows, kept the buds locked up till the sun could obtain, in the spring of the year, so fixed an ascendency as to dissolve those snows, and protect the buds, during their developement, from every danger of returning cold. The accumulated snows of the winter remaining to be dissolved all together in the spring, produced those overflowings of our rivers, so frequent then, and so rare now.\\"http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/JEFFERSON/ch07.html Influence Jefferson's work inspired others by his reflections on the nature of society, human rights and government. Supporters of abolition considered his thoughts on blacks and slavery as an obstacle to achieving equal rights for free blacks in the United States. People argued against Jefferson's ideas in the Notes long after he died. For instance, the abolitionist David Walker, a free black, opposed the colonization movement. In Article IV of his Appeal (1830), Walker said that free blacks considered colonization as the desire of whites to remove free blacks > from among those of our brethren whom they unjustly hold in bondage, so that > they may be enabled to keep them the more secure in ignorance and > wretchedness, to support them and their children, and consequently they > would have the more obedient slave. For if the free are allowed to stay > among the slave, they will have intercourse together, and, of course, the > free will learn the slaves bad habits, by teaching them that they are MEN, > as well as other people, and certainly ought and must be FREE. Jefferson's passages about slavery and the black race in Notes are referred to and disputed by Walker in the Appeal. Walker valued Jefferson as \\"one of as great characters as ever lived among the whites,\\" but he opposed his ideas: > Do you believe that the assertions of such a man, will pass away into > oblivion unobserved by this people and the world? ... I say, that unless we > try to refute Mr. Jefferson's arguments respecting us, we will only > establish them. He went on: > Mr. Jefferson's very severe remarks on us have been so extensively argued > upon by men whose attainments in literature, I shall never be able to reach, > that I would not have meddled with it, were it not to solicit each of my > brethren, who has the spirit of a man, to buy a copy of Mr. Jefferson's > Notes on Virginia, and put it in the hand of his son. For let no one of us > suppose that the refutations which have been written by our white friends > are enough—they are whites—we are blacks. We, and the world wish to see the > charges of Mr. Jefferson refuted by the blacks themselves, according to > their chance; for we must remember that what the whites have written > respecting this subject, is other men's labours, and did not emanate from > the blacks.

VertiBird was the name of a line of toy helicopter products made by Mattel between 1971 and the early 1980s. Description =General= The VertiBird helicopter flies around a central base containing an electric motor, spring lift assist, pitch control, batteries, and a throttle. A 21-inch arm with pitch control rod and the spindle that transfers the power to helicopter via drive springs and drive rod, is connected from the central base to the helicopter. The original VertiBird playset has a space theme appropriate for the space age attitude of the 1970s. The first set was reminiscent of the Project Mercury program. Later versions of the VertiBird would continue to revisit the space theme as well as other popular television and movie themes of the 1970s and early 1980s time frames. =Box contents= The box contents of the average VertiBird playset consisted of the following items: * Cardboard packing for the Vertibird. Holds the VertiBird and rotor Also has punchouts as noted below. * VertiBird with base and controls and helicopter mostly preassembled (except as noted in version list below). * Cardboard skill accessories. (cardboard punchout Landing Platform) \\\\- Accessory bag with the following items. * VertiBird Instructions. * Label stickers for the VertiBird and accessories. * Two-bladed plastic rotor with safety rubber tips. * Skyhook. * Pickup accessories. (Astronaut, Space Capsule) * Plastic skill accessories. (Life raft) Other versions of the VertiBird also included: * Molded forms for the base and controls that were set theme specific. (Rescue Ship, Polar Adventure) * Punch-out cardboard buildings that are playset theme specific. (Airborne Rescue) * Glow-in-the- dark luminous Label stickers for the Vertibird and accessories. (Night Patrol) * Play mats. (Paramedic Rescue) * Site accessories that are playset theme specific. (Polar Adventure, Battlestar Galactica) * Various other pickup items that were set theme specific. =Power= Power was provided by 4 'D' sized alkaline batteries in the base. They also doubled as weight to hold down the base. =Flight= The helicopter is controlled using a two lever control unit. The controls operate similar to a real helicopter. The throttle control provides proportional control of the blade speed. The pitch control provides for tilting the Vertibird forward or backward. During flight the VertiBird is subject to the same physical flight characteristics as a real helicopter. This included ground-effects for low level hovering, plus altitude gains and losses when changing direction. Overall the VertiBird is easy to learn how to pilot for basic flight, but precision flying will require some patience and time on the controls as in a real helicopter. As noted there is a spring assist to lift the VertiBird. However, in actual operation the assist is not enough to lift the VertiBird off the ground. Most of the lift comes the spinning rotor itself. Subsequently, dropping heavy items during flight will result in a very rapid ascension of the VertiBird unless the pilot has good flight skills. Mattel designed the set with the young flyer in mind. The VertiBird can take quite a beating during crashes and toybox storage. This design has resulted in a toy that has survived over 38 years and remains as fun today as it was when VertiBird first came on the market back in 1971. The one exception to the required VertiBird flight skills was the introduction of the Space: 1999 themed playset, which did not feature the \\"VertiBird\\" branding on its packaging elements. The Space: 1999 version was the one playset which (more or less) abandoned the VertiBird concept in favor of a look and feel to match television series. The set had controls were radically different from the standard VertiBird controls. The Eagle (helicopter) was fully supported by controls. The set used only two C-cell sized batteries. The throttle provided nothing more than a switch to spin the rotor. Effectively there was no lift provided by the rotor and instead all lifting is performed with the controls using hand strength. This set would not be a good version for the first time VertiBird pilot wanting to have a true VertiBird experience. Considered notable only for its Space: 1999 theme tie in and high collector value. But otherwise a poorly performing VertiBird set. The later Battlestar Galactica playset successfully blended the VertiBird concept with a space theme. Spring linkage that connects the motor to the shaft that powers the rotor. Popularity The average retail price for most VertiBirds back during the 1970s was between $8.00 and $20.00(USD). Today, with more and more people collecting and restoring them, collectors are willing to pay over $400 for a working Vertibird. On July 31, 2006, a \\"mint in box\\" Vertibird sold for $500 on eBay, with 4 individual bidders bidding at least $400.eBay item #250012434640 Earlier eBay sales were also noted for final sale prices in excess of $1200.00 for the extremely rare Space: 1999 themed playset in unplayed, brand new, (C-10) condition. In 2005, a complete, near-mint condition set of the German \\"Libelle 12 Polizeihubschrauber\\" (considered by some collectors to be the second-rarest worldwide VertiBird variant after the \\"Space: 1999\\" model, although other internationally issued sets - in particular the Canadian \\"Okanagan Logging 'Copter\\" - appear to be much less common than the \\"Libelle\\") changed hands for $850 in a private sale. Distribution and licensing Distribution was not limited to the United States. Mattel produced international versions of the VertiBird playset for the various markets including Canada, Brazil, the UK, Germany, and Italy. Just when it seems the final international VertiBird version has been found, another is reported. To date it is unknown just how many markets and languages Mattel distributed the VertiBird into. The most recent \\"new\\" variant to surface is a Mexican version of the \\"Polar Adventure\\" set, offered on eBay in mid-November 2008. Mattel also licensed the VertiBird for production by other companies. At least two are known (see list below). In the media Several Mattel VertiBird commercials were made in the 1970s and early 1980s. One of the advertising agencies used for production was Ogilvy & Mather. In a Christmas-themed episode of That '70s Show, Eric Forman can be seen playing with the VertiBird in a basement scene. Tiltwing aircraft called \\"Vertibirds\\" (although different in appearance, it resembles a cross between a Dragonfly and a V-22 Osprey), appear in the games Fallout 2, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4. Similar VertiBird toys and games In addition to the VertiBird itself there are several other pre-VertiBird and post-VertiBird units covering various eras, global regions and business lines. Some units like the Dan Dare (see list below) were home usage toy sets. Others such as the WhirlyBird were skill games meant for arcade distribution or other location-based business usage. All units share the VertiBird's basic premise of fun by allowing the user actively control the helicopter, while still providing a safe and easily controllable experience. VertiBird versions There are 13 known different US versions of the VertiBird playsets. The original VertiBird had an early manufacturing change that modified the drive spring to drive rod coupling. The first version had the end of the drive rod screwed into the drive spring on the helicopter. The production modification resulted in the drive rod being permanently soldered to the drive spring, and packaged the base, controls, rods, and helicopter (except rotor) into one complete unit. In addition to the different US versions other international versions were produced. These international VertiBird versions were localized as needed for language, playset graphics, and pictures, and local service depot information as required. There were also some contracted production runs of the Mattel VertiBird for other companies. Grouped all together, there are currently 23 different known variations. Every year or so it seems a new variation is discovered somewhere around the globe. In February 2015, an American eBay seller with immaculate feedback offered several pieces of supposedly original conceptual art by former Mattel designer Tom Hodges, which featured graphic layouts for a number of unproduced VertiBird variants from the mid-to-late 1970s. These included a \\"Spacehawk X7\\" intergalactic probe model (undated), a \\"Medivac\\" military-themed set (1975), a \\"Disaster Air Rescue\\" version (1975), a \\"Space War\\" sci-fi model (1978), and a 1979 M*A*S*H-themed set that was obviously meant to tie in with the successful TV series. =USA versions= * 1971 - Set No. 5972 - - VertiBird.

(also released in the USA) Germany * 1978 - Set No. 2677-0919 - Libelle 12 Polizeihubschrauber (German version of \\"Air Police\\" set). This much sought- after model did not feature any reference to the \\"VertiBird\\" series on its packaging elements despite being a genuine Mattel product. Collectors should take note that two different versions exist of the \\"Libelle 12\\" set; with the more common one containing the getaway car, road barrier and radar receiver made of red plastic, while the much scarcer second variant had these same accessory pieces molded from clear plastic instead. Also, a rare early packaging artwork variation featured Mattel's \\"Hot Wheels\\" logo added to the lid of the box and employed a smaller, less prominent \\"Libelle 12\\" logo. Whereas the original German retail price for the \\"Libelle 12\\" was in the range of around DM 35, near-mint/unplayed sets auctioned off on eBay.de between January 2009 and May 2012 realized final bids from €90 to €150. Italy * 1978 - Set No. 2675-0920 - VertiBird Elicottero Carabinieri (Italian version of \\"Airborne Rescue Mission\\" set). It is of note that the initial version of this set featured the original US \\"Airborne Rescue Mission\\" packaging (containing two different instruction manuals in both English and Italian), while the second version - in different red box - was fully adjusted for the domestic market and came with the Italian-language manual only. Also, early Mattel ads published in Italy promoted the toy as \\"Elicottero S.O.S. Mattel\\" and utilized a picture of the US model (yellow helicopter and white base/control unit), although the actual \\"Elicottero Carabinieri\\" set consisted of a black helicopter and red operating elements. * 1980 - Set No. 3017-0926 - VertiBird Veicolo Spaziale Mazinga \\"Z\\" (Battlestar Galactica TV series theme).

A completely re-designed version of Mattel's earlier (1972) \\"Dareplane Stunter\\" flight toy that had worked on thin, flexible cables (which made it difficult for young kids to properly navigate the plane) and was prone to quick damage, with countless sets being returned for exchange to toy stores and Mattel itself within just a few days after purchase. Having the original cable connections replaced by a solid plastic arm that no longer allowed to do \\"loops\\" and the like, the later \\"Wingwalker\\" version generally operated in a way that was a lot more similar to the VertiBird concept (even including a sky-hook retractable from the plane, as well as several pick-up items) - in fact, the only thing these two toys had in common was the name. Other than the 1972 \\"Dareplane,\\" which had been available in North America only, the \\"Wingwalker\\" set also was released in Europe, but enjoyed little success on either market and thus disappeared from shelves rather quickly.

It was released on 22 April 1996, and was the band's final release for Cacophonous Records.  Recording  V Empire was hastily written and recorded for Cacophonous Records as a contractual obligation before the band jumped ship to Music for Nations. As such, it is the first of two albums released in 1996, the other being Dusk... and Her Embrace. Half of the band was replaced for this recording, with Stuart Anstis replacing guitarists Paul Allender and Paul Ryan and Damien Gregori replacing keyboardist Benjamin Ryan. All the guitars on V Empire were performed by Anstis. The name \\"Jared Demeter\\" listed as a second guitarist in the liner notes included in the booklet of the EP is just a made-up name to give the impression that there were two guitarists on the EP. Also, all keyboard duties on V Empire were handled by Keith Appleton. V Empire is the first recording to feature backing vocalist Sarah Jezebel Deva.  Content  V Empire sees a step up in production from the band's debut and introduces the fast, highly technical instrumentation that would be the hallmark of the band's next few releases. It includes a re-recorded version of \\"The Forest Whispers My Name\\" from the band's first album, The Principle of Evil Made Flesh. = Title = The Gospel of Filth, a definitive history of the band and its influences, written by Gavin Baddeley and Dani Filth and published in 2010, refers to this record throughout as V Empire. Due to the typographic sizing and spacing of the record's cover art, however, it has been widely read as Vempire in the years since its release. References like AllMusic and Discogs continue to retain the latter spelling, while some recent interviews appear to indicate that the band also pronounce it \\"Vempire\\" in conversation.

Early life Heder was born on June 23, 1977 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. She graduated from the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama.  Career  After graduation, Heder moved to Hollywood to become an actress and screenwriter while working for a nanny agency. At the agency, she worked for guests with children staying at four-star hotels and her experiences inspired her first short film. In early 2005, the script for Mother was 1 of 8 chosen to be awarded a fellowship for the prestigious American Film Institute's DWW (Directing Workshop for Women). Mother, Heder's first short film as writer and director, won the Grand Jury Award for \\"Best Narrative Short\\" at the Florida Film Festival. Mother also received honors at the Cinéfondation Competition of the Cannes Film Festival and the Seattle International Film Festival. Since then the film has been further selected to appear in competition at Palm Springs International Festival of Shorts and the British Film Institute's London Film Festival. In 2010 Heder won a Peabody Award, along with her fellow writers, for her work on the acclaimed U.S. television series, Men of a Certain Age. In 2011 she wrote and directed a short comedy, Dog Eat Dog (A Short Tale) starring Zachary Quinto to raise awareness for pet adoption, and that short film can be watched for free on YouTube. She wrote for seasons 1-3 of the Netflix original series Orange Is the New Black before taking time off from that job to direct the film Tallulah. In 2015, Sian Heder directed Tallulah, starring Ellen Page and Allison Janney. Tallulah was backed by Route One Entertainment, Maiden Voyages Pictures and Ocean Blue Entertainment. The film was set to premier as one of 65 films selected for Sundance Film Festival January 21–31 in Utah. Netflix obtained worldwide rights to stream Tallulah in January 2016.

He started his professional career with Barakaldo CF but soon signed with Athletic Bilbao, being eligible to represent the club due to learning his football skills in the territory. Merodio made his La Liga debut on 11 March 1956, scoring in a 2–1 home win against Atlético Madrid. His input during the season, however, was restricted to a further two games as the team won the league and also the Copa del Rey; on 16 January 1957, in the subsequent edition of the European Cup, he found the net in a 5–3 defeat of Manchester United in the quarter-finals' first leg, losing 5–6 on aggregate. During the 1958–59 campaign, Merodio scored 11 times over four consecutive league games (Athletic won 9–0, 9–0, 8–1 and 7–0). He eventually left the club in 1963 with 104 official appearances and 39 goals, joining Real Murcia also in the top division, playing there for two seasons and suffering relegation in his second.

There exist at least three theories as to its origin. According to one, it came into being when there was an individual who served the Austro-Hungarian forces on the military border - the past border between Austria and Bosnia, which later belonged to the Ottomans. Since the border was near the edge (\\"kraj\\") of the country, the surname Pokrajac came about. Pokrajac, therefore, is a name that describes an individual who lives or exists on an edge, or end (\\"kraj\\"). \\"Potkraj\\", in Bosnian, means \\"at the bottom of a mountain slope\\", and there are a number of villages in Bosnia named \\"Potkraj\\".

The hue of the color is used to show the arg (polar coordinate angle) of the complex logarithm. The saturation and value (intensity and brightness) of the color is used to show the modulus of the complex logarithm. In complex analysis, a complex logarithm' of the non- zero complex number , denoted by ', is defined to be any complex number for which .Sarason, Section IV.9. This construction is analogous to the real logarithm function , which is the inverse of the real exponential function , satisfying for positive real numbers . If a non-zero complex number is given in polar form as ( and real numbers, with ), then is one logarithm of . Since exactly for all integer , adding integer multiples to the argument gives all the numbers that are logarithms of : :. All these complex logarithms of are on a vertical line in the complex plane with real part . Since any nonzero complex number has infinitely many complex logarithms, the complex logarithm cannot be defined to be a single-valued function on the complex numbers, but only as a multivalued function. Settings for a formal treatment of this are, among others, the associated Riemann surface, branches, or partial inverses of the complex exponential function. Sometimes the instead of is used when addressing the complex logarithm. Problems with inverting the complex exponential function A plot of the multi-valued imaginary part of the complex logarithm function, which shows the branches. As a complex number z goes around the origin, the imaginary part of the logarithm goes up or down. This makes the origin a branch point of the function. For a function to have an inverse, it must map distinct values to distinct values, that is, it must be injective. But the complex exponential function is not injective, because for any w, since adding iθ to w has the effect of rotating ew counterclockwise θ radians. So the points :\\\\ldots,\\\\;w-4\\\\pi i, \\\\;w-2\\\\pi i, \\\\;w, \\\\;w + 2\\\\pi i, \\\\;w+4\\\\pi i, \\\\;\\\\ldots, equally spaced along a vertical line, are all mapped to the same number by the exponential function. This means that the exponential function does not have an inverse function in the standard sense.Conway, p. 39.Another interpretation of this is that the \\"inverse\\" of the complex exponential function is a multivalued function taking each nonzero complex number z to the set of all logarithms of z. There are two solutions to this problem. One is to restrict the domain of the exponential function to a region that does not contain any two numbers differing by an integer multiple of 2πi: this leads naturally to the definition of branches of , which are certain functions that single out one logarithm of each number in their domains. This is analogous to the definition of on as the inverse of the restriction of to the interval : there are infinitely many real numbers θ with , but one arbitrarily chooses the one in . Another way to resolve the indeterminacy is to view the logarithm as a function whose domain is not a region in the complex plane, but a Riemann surface that covers the punctured complex plane in an infinite-to-1 way. Branches have the advantage that they can be evaluated at complex numbers. On the other hand, the function on the Riemann surface is elegant in that it packages together all branches of the logarithm and does not require an arbitrary choice as part of its definition. Definition of principal value For each nonzero complex number z = x + yi, the principal value Log z is the logarithm whose imaginary part lies in the interval (−π, π]. The expression Log 0 is left undefined since there is no complex number w satisfying ew = 0\\\\. The principal value can be described also in a few other ways. To give a formula for Log z, begin by expressing z in polar form, z = reiθ. Given z, the polar form is not quite unique, because of the possibility of adding an integer multiple of 2π to θ, but it can be made unique by requiring θ to lie in the interval (−π, π]; this θ is called the principal value of the argument, and is sometimes written Arg z or (especially in computer languages) atan2(y,x), which agrees with arctan(y/x) when x > 0 but gives a correct value for any (x, y) ≠ (0, 0). Then the principal value of the logarithm can be defined by :\\\\operatorname{Log} z = \\\\ln r + i \\\\theta = \\\\ln z + i \\\\operatorname{Arg} z = \\\\ln\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} + i \\\\operatorname{atan2}(y,x). For example, Log(-3i) = ln 3 − πi/2. Another way to describe Log z is as the inverse of a restriction of the complex exponential function, as in the previous section. The horizontal strip S consisting of complex numbers w = x+yi such that −π < y ≤ π is an example of a region not containing any two numbers differing by an integer multiple of 2πi, so the restriction of the exponential function to S has an inverse. In fact, the exponential function maps S bijectively to the punctured complex plane \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times = \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\setminus \\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, and the inverse of this restriction is \\\\operatorname{Log}\\\\colon \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times \\\\to S. The conformal mapping section below explains the geometric properties of this map in more detail. When the notation log z appears without any particular logarithm having been specified, it is generally best to assume that the principal value is intended. In particular, this gives a value consistent with the real value of ln z when z is a positive real number. The capitalization in the notation Log is used by some authors to distinguish the principal value from other logarithms of z. Not all identities satisfied by ln extend to complex numbers. It is true that eLog z = z for all z ≠ 0 (this is what it means for Log z to be a logarithm of z), but the identity Log ez = z fails for z outside the strip S. For this reason, one cannot always apply Log to both sides of an identity ez = ew to deduce z = w. Also, the identity Log(z1z2) = Log z1 + Log z2 can fail: the two sides can differ by an integer multiple of 2πi : for instance, :\\\\operatorname{Log}((-1)i) = \\\\operatorname{Log}(-i) = \\\\ln(1) -\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{2} = -\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{2}, but :\\\\operatorname{Log}(-1) + \\\\operatorname{Log}(i) = \\\\left( \\\\ln(1) + \\\\pi i \\\\right) + \\\\left( \\\\ln(1) + \\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{2} \\\\right) = \\\\frac{3\\\\pi i}{2} e -\\\\frac{\\\\pi i}{2}. The function Log z is discontinuous at each negative real number, but continuous everywhere else in \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times. To explain the discontinuity, consider what happens to Arg z as z approaches a negative real number a. If z approaches a from above, then Arg z approaches π, which is also the value of Arg a itself. But if z approaches a from below, then Arg z approaches −π. So Arg z \\"jumps\\" by 2π as z crosses the negative real axis, and similarly Log z jumps by 2πi. Branches of the complex logarithm Is there a different way to choose a logarithm of each nonzero complex number so as to make a function L(z) that is continuous on all of \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times? The answer is no. To see why, imagine tracking such a logarithm function along the unit circle, by evaluating L at eiθ as θ increases from 0 to 2π. For simplicity, suppose that the starting value L(1) is 0. Then for L(z) to be continuous, L(eiθ) must agree with iθ as θ increases (the difference is a continuous function of θ taking values in the discrete set 2\\\\pi i \\\\mathbb{Z}). In particular, L(e2πi) = 2πi, but e2πi = 1, so this contradicts L(1) = 0\\\\. To obtain a continuous logarithm defined on complex numbers, it is hence necessary to restrict the domain to a smaller subset U of the complex plane. Because one of the goals is to be able to differentiate the function, it is reasonable to assume that the function is defined on a neighborhood of each point of its domain; in other words, U should be an open set. Also, it is reasonable to assume that U is connected, since otherwise the function values on different components of U could be unrelated to each other. All this motivates the following definition: : A branch of log z is a continuous function L(z) defined on a connected open subset U of the complex plane such that L(z) is a logarithm of z for each z in U. For example, the principal value defines a branch on the open set where it is continuous, which is the set \\\\mathbb{C}-\\\\mathbb{R}_{\\\\le 0} obtained by removing 0 and all negative real numbers from the complex plane. Another example: The Mercator series : \\\\ln(1+u)=\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} u^n = u - \\\\frac{u^2}{2} + \\\\frac{u^3}{3} - \\\\cdots converges locally uniformly for u < 1, so setting z = 1+u defines a branch of log z on the open disk of radius 1 centered at 1. (Actually, this is just a restriction of Log z, as can be shown by differentiating the difference and comparing values at 1.) Once a branch is fixed, it may be denoted \\"log z\\" if no confusion can result. Different branches can give different values for the logarithm of a particular complex number, however, so a branch must be fixed in advance (or else the principal branch must be understood) in order for \\"log z\\" to have a precise unambiguous meaning. =Branch cuts= The argument above involving the unit circle generalizes to show that no branch of log z exists on an open set U containing a closed curve that winds around 0. To foil this argument, U is typically chosen as the complement of a ray or curve in the complex plane going from 0 (inclusive) to infinity in some direction. In this case, the curve is known as a branch cut. For example, the principal branch has a branch cut along the negative real axis. If the function L(z) is extended to be defined at a point of the branch cut, it will necessarily be discontinuous there; at best it will be continuous \\"on one side\\", like Log z at a negative real number. =The derivative of the complex logarithm= Each branch L(z) of log z on an open set U is an inverse of a restriction of the exponential function, namely the restriction to the image of U under L. Since the exponential function is holomorphic (that is, complex differentiable) with nonvanishing derivative, the complex analogue of the inverse function theorem applies. It shows that L(z) is holomorphic at each z in U, and L′(z) = 1/z. Another way to prove this is to check the Cauchy–Riemann equations in polar coordinates. =Constructing branches via integration= The function \\\\ln(x) for x>0 can be constructed by the formula : \\\\ln(x) = \\\\int_1^x \\\\frac{du}{u}. If the range of integration started at a positive number a other than 1, the formula would have to be : \\\\ln(x) = \\\\ln(a) + \\\\int_a^x \\\\frac{du}{u} instead. In developing the analogue for the complex logarithm, there is an additional complication: the definition of the complex integral requires a choice of path. Fortunately, if the integrand is holomorphic, then the value of the integral is unchanged by deforming the path (while holding the endpoints fixed), and in a simply connected region U (a region with \\"no holes\\") any path from a to z inside U can be continuously deformed inside U into any other. All this leads to the following: : If U is a simply connected open subset of \\\\mathbb{C} not containing 0, then a branch of log z defined on U can be constructed by choosing a starting point a in U, choosing a logarithm b of a, and defining :: L(z) = b + \\\\int_a^z \\\\frac{dw}{w} : for each z in U.Lang, p. 121. The complex logarithm as a conformal map The circles Re(Log z) = constant and the rays Im(Log z) = constant in the complex z-plane. Any holomorphic map f\\\\colon U \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} satisfying f'(z) e 0 for all z \\\\in U is a conformal map, which means that if two curves passing through a point a of U form an angle α (in the sense that the tangent lines to the curves at a form an angle α), then the images of the two curves form the same angle α at f(a). Since a branch of log z is holomorphic, and since its derivative 1/z is never 0, it defines a conformal map. For example, the principal branch w = Log z, viewed as a mapping from \\\\mathbb{C}-\\\\mathbb{R}_{\\\\le 0} to the horizontal strip defined by Im z < π, has the following properties, which are direct consequences of the formula in terms of polar form: * CirclesStrictly speaking, the point on each circle on the negative real axis should be discarded, or the principal value should be used there. in the z-plane centered at 0 are mapped to vertical segments in the w-plane connecting a − πi to a + πi, where a is the real log of the radius of the circle. * Rays emanating from 0 in the z-plane are mapped to horizontal lines in the w-plane. Each circle and ray in the z-plane as above meet at a right angle. Their images under Log are a vertical segment and a horizontal line (respectively) in the w-plane, and these too meet at a right angle. This is an illustration of the conformal property of Log. The associated Riemann surface A visualization of the Riemann surface of log z. The surface appears to spiral around a vertical line corresponding to the origin of the complex plane. The actual surface extends arbitrarily far both horizontally and vertically, but is cut off in this image. =Construction= The various branches of log z cannot be glued to give a single continuous function \\\\log \\\\colon \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} because two branches may give different values at a point where both are defined. Compare, for example, the principal branch Log(z) on \\\\mathbb{C}-\\\\mathbb{R}_{\\\\le 0} with imaginary part θ in (−π,π) and the branch L(z) on \\\\mathbb{C}-\\\\mathbb{R}_{\\\\ge 0} whose imaginary part θ lies in (0,2π). These agree on the upper half plane, but not on the lower half plane. So it makes sense to glue the domains of these branches only along the copies of the upper half plane. The resulting glued domain is connected, but it has two copies of the lower half plane. Those two copies can be visualized as two levels of a parking garage, and one can get from the Log level of the lower half plane up to the L level of the lower half plane by going 360° counterclockwise around 0, first crossing the positive real axis (of the Log level) into the shared copy of the upper half plane and then crossing the negative real axis (of the L level) into the L level of the lower half plane. One can continue by gluing branches with imaginary part θ in (π,3π), in (2π,4π), and so on, and in the other direction, branches with imaginary part θ in (−2π,0), in (−3π,−π), and so on. The final result is a connected surface that can be viewed as a spiralling parking garage with infinitely many levels extending both upward and downward. This is the Riemann surface R associated to log z. A point on R can be thought of as a pair (z,θ) where θ is a possible value of the argument of z. In this way, R can be embedded in \\\\mathbb{C} \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\approx \\\\mathbb{R}^3. =The logarithm function on the Riemann surface= Because the domains of the branches were glued only along open sets where their values agreed, the branches glue to give a single well- defined function \\\\log_R \\\\colon R \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}.The notations R and logR are not universally used. It maps each point (z,θ) on R to ln z + iθ. This process of extending the original branch Log by gluing compatible holomorphic functions is known as analytic continuation. There is a \\"projection map\\" from R down to \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times that \\"flattens\\" the spiral, sending (z,θ) to z. For any z \\\\in \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times, if one takes all the points (z,θ) of R lying \\"directly above\\" z and evaluates logR at all these points, one gets all the logarithms of z. =Gluing all branches of log z= Instead of gluing only the branches chosen above, one can start with all branches of log z, and simultaneously glue every pair of branches L_1\\\\colon U_1 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} and L_2\\\\colon U_2 \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} along the largest open subset of U_1 \\\\cap U_2 on which L1 and L2 agree. This yields the same Riemann surface R and function logR as before. This approach, although slightly harder to visualize, is more natural in that it does not require selecting any particular branches. If U′ is an open subset of R projecting bijectively to its image U in \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times, then the restriction of logR to U′ corresponds to a branch of log z defined on U. Every branch of log z arises in this way. =The Riemann surface as a universal cover= The projection map R \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times realizes R as a covering space of \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times. In fact, it is a Galois covering with deck transformation group isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{Z}, generated by the homeomorphism sending (z,θ) to (z,θ+2π). As a complex manifold, R is biholomorphic with \\\\mathbb{C} via logR. (The inverse map sends z to (ez,Im z).) This shows that R is simply connected, so R is the universal cover of \\\\mathbb{C}^\\\\times. Applications * The complex logarithm is needed to define exponentiation in which the base is a complex number. Namely, if a and b are complex numbers with a ≠ 0, one can use the principal value to define ab = eb Log a. One can also replace Log a by other logarithms of a to obtain other values of ab. * Since the mapping w = Log z transforms circles centered at 0 into vertical straight line segments, it is useful in engineering applications involving an annulus. Generalizations =Logarithms to other bases= Just as for real numbers, one can define for complex numbers b and x : \\\\log_b(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\log x}{\\\\log b}, the only caveat being that its value depends on the choice of a branch of log defined at b and x (with log b ≠ 0). For example, using the principal value gives : \\\\log_i(e) = \\\\frac{\\\\log e}{\\\\log i} = \\\\frac1{\\\\pi i/2} = -\\\\frac{2i}{\\\\pi}. =Logarithms of holomorphic functions= If f is a holomorphic function on a connected open subset U of \\\\mathbb{C}, then a branch of log f on U is a continuous function g on U such that eg(z) = f(z) for all z in U. Such a function g is necessarily holomorphic with g′(z) = f′(z)/f(z) for all z in U. If U is a simply connected open subset of \\\\mathbb{C}, and f is a nowhere-vanishing holomorphic function on U, then a branch of log f defined on U can be constructed by choosing a starting point a in U, choosing a logarithm b of f(a), and defining :g(z) = b + \\\\int_a^z \\\\frac{f'(w)}{f(w)}\\\\,dw for each z in U.

After Riku matriculated in 1991 at Hoërskool Florida, Johannesburg, Gauteng Province, he studied philosophy at University of the Witwatersrand where he finished his honours degree. He changed his name to Victor S. Wolf and claimed that Riku Latti is \\"dead\\".The Death Of Riku Lätti And The Birth Of Victor S. Wolf, Rolling Stone, 2 July 2013 Since then he composed the complete film score for Jans Rautenbach's film \\"Abraham\\" on which he was credited as Riku Lätti, thereby being effectively resurrected. In South Africa Riku collaborated with superstars such as Koos Kombuis, Laurika Rauch, Frazer Barry, Churchil Naudé, David Kramer, Stef Bos, Paul Riekert among others. His songs have been performed and recorded by people like Karla du Plessis, Laurika Rauch, Bobby van Jaarsveld, the all-girl punk band The Pheobes and the jazz outfit Tsunami and Izak Davel. In 2005, he broke onto the international music scene when he completed his first tour in Belgium and the Netherlands. In 2006 during a follow-up tour through Europe he performed with Stef Bos. On October 1, 2007, Lätti releases his first album in the Benelux (Akoesties). For this album he re-recorded some of his best songs in a stripped-down version, using only his voice and a piano or a guitar. Riku together with Jahn Beukes wrote the music for the award-winning SABC television series Hopeville. Hopeville won the prestigious The Rose d'Or in Switzerland for best international TV series. It was also nominated for an Emmy Award. Other scores include the soundtrack for KykNet series Wie lê waar and the drama series Vlug na Egipte. He won a South African Film and Television Award (SAFTA) for his sound design and film score for the feature film Die Wonderlike Avonture van Hanna Hoekom. Other awards Riku has won include 2 GMT (Geraas Musiektoekennings). (The first for best Alternative Artist for his album Pleister vir my Nerwe. The second for best male vocalist for his album Aan't sterre tel.) And a Vonk Music award for his album Die President se keuse. His greatest work before his death was a collaborative album Radio Lava with Jahn Beukes and Arnaud van Vliet featuring original work from Huyser Burger. In his last act before his death he accused the South African media of not having transformed after the end of Apartheid. He is also the chief in charge of zimdollar, an Afrikaans cult newspaper. There is also a Finnish pop singer of the same name. Die Wasgoedlyn A few years ago Riku Lätti started recording many different artists all around South-Africa. Wherever he went he took his recording equipment with and before he knew it artists started featuring on each other's tracks, collaborating and performing together, and so Die Wasgoedlyn started and Die Wasgoedlyn CD was released in 2015. Die Wasgoedlyn (The Washing Line) is a concept centering around Afrikaans musicians telling and singing their stories in their natural habitat: at their homes, around braais, with friends. These informal gatherings are recorded by Riku Lätti with his mobile studio set-up ensuring that the music is not overproduced in a studio giving a sense of the real and the unpretentious. The name, Die Wasgoedlyn (The Washing Line), was chosen for two reasons. The first being that a washing line (in literal terms) is not usually a place where you would take your guests. It is usually in your backyard where things are a lot less presentable than the front (street view) of your house. In the same vain Die Wasgoedlyn attempts to unearth these raw performances of artists in a space (mentally and physically) that they take comfort in - in which they do not have to pretend. The second reason is that on a washing line you'll find a large variety of items, from work-shirts to church-blouses, patched socks, vest with holes in it, underwear from Jockey, petticoats, etc. Die Wasgoedlyn is as much about putting the artist in their most natural surrounding as it is about surrounding them with other artists - enabling the somewhat mystical bond between creatives to flourish resulting in instinctive collaborations. In 2014 Riku Lätti collaborated with Kilroy Was Here! Productions (Charl J. Naudé and Gideon Breytenbach) in attempts to turn Die Wasgoedlyn into a TV series with the same concept. The first season will feature approximately twenty artists including Lochner de Kock, Ryno Velvet, Willim Welsyn, Frazer Barry, Tribal Echo, Piet Botha, Jacques \\"Jake Gunn\\" Groenewald, Dana Snyman, Gert Vlok Nel, Jannie du Toit, C.

Life and legacy  An engineer, graduate of the École Polytechnique and of \\"Sup'Aéro\\" (the national aerospace engineering school) as well as a French air force officer and test pilot, he was a founding father of Airbus Industrie (along with Roger Béteille and Felix Kracht) and became its first CEO. He was the driving force behind the development of the Airbus A300B, the original aircraft that started Airbus on its road to global success by obtaining French government backing for the programme in 1969. Following his appointment as assistant director of the Centre d'Essais en Vol (government flight test centre) in 1938, he fought for the French Resistance during the Second World War. In 1944 he was made commander of the Free French air forces in London, going on to become chief of staff of the French Forces of the Interior under General Koenig. He was awarded the Croix de guerre 1939-1945 with three palms, the Médaille de la Résistance with rosette and appointed officer on the US Legion of Merit. While acting as a special representative of the French government in Britain and the United States, Henri Ziegler was also managing director of Air France from 1946 to 1954. In subsequent years he was the founder of Air Alpes, a member of several cabinet ministries, president of Avions Breguet; president of Sud Aviation (1968), leader of the Franco-British supersonic airliner project Concorde, and president and CEO (1970–1973) of SNIAS (Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale), which was renamed Aérospatiale in 1984. From 1971 to 1973, he was also managing director of the French Aerospace industries trade organisation (Usias), retiring from Airbus in 1975. In 1973, Ziegler received the Tony Jannus Award, along with Geoffrey Knight, for distinguished contributions to commercial aviation. Ziegler was the father of Bernard Ziegler, the former Airbus Director of Engineering. During his career, Ziegler was the recipient of several honours, including Grand Officer of the Légion d'honneur, honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and honorary Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO). \\"There would be no Airbus without Henri Ziegler,\\" Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert declared on 11 April 2006 at the dedication of the new Airbus delivery centre in Toulouse named in his honour.

When this is achieved, the screen is replaced with a mirror and the diverging lens is inserted between the converging lens and the mirror at such a distance to the mirror that the light returning through the diverging and converging lenses produces a sharp image on top of the luminous object. This is the case when the beam hitting the mirror is collimated. The distance found is the (negative) focal length of the diverging lens. Light from an origin point O is collimated (made parallel) by a high quality objective lens. If the collimated beam falls perpendicularly onto a plane reflecting surface, the light is reflected back along its original path and is brought to a focus at a point coincident with the origin point. If the reflector is tilted through an angle θ, the reflected beam is deflected through an angle 2θ, and the image I is displaced laterally from the origin 0.The amount of displacement is given by d=2θf where f is the focal length of the lens, and θ is in radians. Light from an illuminated target graticule at the focus of an objective lens is directed towards the lens by a beam splitter. After reflection by a mirror on the workpiece, the light returns through the Autocollimator and passes through the beam splitter, forming an image of the target graticule in the plane of an eyepiece graticule. The eyepiece graticule and the reflected image of the target graticule are viewed simultaneously through the eyepiece. The image of the target graticule is always seen in focus and at constant magnification in the eyepiece, regardless of the distance between the Autocollimator and the reflecting surface. However, at long working distances only a portion of the reflected target graticule may appear in the eyepiece, owing to the failure of obliquely returning rays to enter the Autocollimator. This will result in a restricted measuring range.

Description The topdog describes the part of an individual which makes demands based on the idea that the individual should adhere to certain societal norms and standards. These demands are often characterized by \\"shoulds\\" and \\"oughts\\". The underdog describes the part of an individual which makes excuses explaining why these demands should not be met. It is often the case that these excuses act as internal sabotage to ensure that the demands are never met. Gestalt therapists often guide their patients through an exercise where the patients takes on both of these roles. With the guidance of the therapist, the patients can come to gain insight about themselves which can help them have a healthier relationship with their environment. =References= * The Gestalt Center of Gainesville, Inc.

Biography The daughter of oboist Robert Bloom,Allmusic Bloom grew up in New Haven, Connecticut, where she studied the cello as a child and started playing the guitar when she was a teenager. Bloom collaborated with Bruce Neumann in the early 1970s, and started to record music with avant-garde guitarist Loren MazzaCane Connors in 1976. Bloom and Connors recorded multiple albums of fragile, simple folk and blues melodies, the majority of which were written by Bloom. She cites Robert Johnson and Lightnin' Hopkins as inspiration in this period. Their collaboration ended in 1984 with the release of their final album Moonlight, of which only 300 copies were pressed. Bloom stopped recording new material soon after her collaboration with Connors ended, and a period of financial hardship followed. A single mother, Bloom focused on raising her children, rarely playing shows outside of New Haven. She began writing songs and recording again in the early 1990s. According to a 2016 interview, Bloom first started touring in 2009, and she enjoys performing now more than she did earlier in her career. Film director Richard Linklater discovered Bloom's music sometime in the early 1990s and featured her song \\"Come Here\\" in his 1995 film Before Sunrise. Encouraged by Linklater's interest in her music, Bloom started writing new songs and released her first album in over 10 years, titled Come Here: The Florida Years, in 1999. A tribute album titled Loving Takes This Course was released in 2009 and features artists such as Devendra Banhart, Bill Callahan, Mark Kozelek, The Dodos, and Scout Niblett. Presently Bloom trains donkeys and plays with her band Love at Work, which includes longtime collaborator Tom Hanford and husband Stan Bronski, offering a musical programs for children and adults as well as playing solo shows in the Northeastern U.S. Bloom has been working with children since 1989. She lives in Litchfield, Connecticut.

It was brought to the U.S. by the Hirameki International Group. It was one of the first interactive dating games to be translated into English (although there was never an English voice dub for the US release). Originally, it was released exclusively in Japan in a PlayStation 2 format that could only be played on Japanese systems. Later, a PC version, also exclusively Japanese, was released, only this time with erotic content added to it. The U.S. version was released as an interactive DVD that didn't contain sexual content. Hourglass of Summer also has a 2 episode OVA that was released in Japan. It was animated by Rikuentai and Picture Magic, with direction by Takahiro Okao, scripts by Isao Shizuya, character designs by Yasunari Nitta, and music composed by Yuuichi Oota and Ryou Sakai. Plot The story revolves around a Japanese sophomore named Kotaro Makimura. As the school year ends and summer vacation approaches, he decides to admit his feelings to his crush, the beautiful Kaho Serizawa. As hopeless as the situation looks to his best friends Ai and Takeshi, he is determined to make Kaho his girlfriend by the end of summer vacation. However, on his way home, he has a collision with a mysterious stranger, and ends up getting covered in a strange multi-colored powder. When he wakes up the next day, he finds himself waking up on September 1 - the first day of the next school year. He also learns that Kaho, who had been his girlfriend, had died in a car accident. Eventually, Kotaro discovers that he has begun day-dropping, in which he skips days, and goes back and forth in time through different days of the summer vacation. With the help of Ligene the Time Patroller (also translated as Lee Jane), Kotaro must win Kaho's heart and prevent her death before he runs out of time. Although Kaho is the girl that Kotaro aspires for at the beginning of the game, the player can choose different decisions that will eventually lead him to relationships with one of the other four girls. Of course, the wrong decisions could result in an ending in which Kotaro wins the affections of none of them. Although the objective of the game is to become the boyfriend of one of the girls, some of these other endings can be the only way to view certain images not found in the other paths.

He was a consistent critic of American foreign policy, a campaigner for Asian communist and socialist movements, and, a supporter of the Khmer Rouge. Caldwell was murdered, likely on the direct orders of his idol Pol Pot, a few hours after meeting the sovereign at his private residence in Cambodia.\\"Lost in Cambodia\\", The Guardian, 10 January 2010 Early life and career Malcolm Caldwell was born in Stirling, Scotland, the son of an architect. The family moved to Kirkcudbright where his father, Archibald Thomson Caldwell was appointed the County Architect for Kirkcudbrightshire; a post he held from 1950 until his early death in 1957.DSA Architect Biography Report: Archibald Thomson Caldwell, scottisharchitects.org.uk.Retrieved 27 February 2019. Malcolm was educated at Kirkcudbright Academy where he was Dux in 1949. He obtained degrees from University of Nottingham and University of Edinburgh. He completed two years' national service in the British army, becoming a sergeant in the Army Education Corps. In 1959 he joined the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London as a Research Fellow. Although he met with conservative opposition within the School, he remained on its faculty throughout his life. As well as being an academic, he was an energetic and committed radical political activist. He was dedicated to criticising Western foreign policy and capitalist economics, paying particular attention to American policy.Peter F. Bell, Mark Selden Extract from a biography of Malcolm Caldwell, Bulletin of Concerned Asian Scholars vol. 11, 1979 He was a founding editor of the Journal of Contemporary Asia, a journal concerned with revolutionary movements in Asia. In 1978 Caldwell was one of the Labour Party candidates in St Mary's ward in local elections in Sidcup, Bexley.\\"London Borough Council Elections, 4 May 1978\\", GLC Intelligence Department, p. 20. Murder in Cambodia Caldwell was one of the staunchest defenders of the Pol Pot regime. He frequently attempted to downplay reports of mass executions by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and was widely criticized by many authorities for doing so.Thompson, Larry Clinton \\"Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975–1982. Jefferson, NC: McFarland Publishing Co., 2010, p. 136 In December 1978 Caldwell was a member, along with Elizabeth Becker and Richard Dudman, of one of the few groups of Western journalists and writers invited to visit Cambodia since the Khmer Rouge had taken power in April 1975. The three visitors were given a highly structured tour of the country. \\"We traveled in a bubble,\\" wrote Becker. \\"No one was allowed to speak to me freely.\\" On 22 December, Caldwell had a private audience with Pol Pot, the leader of Cambodia. After the meeting, he came back to the guest house in Phnom Penh where the three were staying in a mood described as \\"euphoric\\". At about 11:00 p.m. that night Becker was awakened by the sound of gunfire. She stepped out of her bedroom and saw a heavily armed Cambodian man who pointed a pistol at her. She ran back into her room and heard people moving and more gunshots. An hour later a Cambodian came to her bedroom door and told her that Caldwell was dead. She and Dudman went to his room. He had been shot in the chest and the body of a Cambodian man was also in the room, possibly the same man who had pointed the pistol at Becker.Becker, Elizabeth, When the War was Over: Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge Revolution New York: Public Affairs Books, 1998, pp. 426–430 The motives for Caldwell's murder remain unexplained.Milton Osborne, Sihanouk, Prince of Light, Prince of Darkness. Silkworm 1994 Andrew Anthony, writing in The Guardian, notes: \\"Certainly there must have been some kind of in-house involvement, as the guests were guarded. But who instructed the guards, and why they did so, remains a subject of speculation.\\" Journalist Wilfred Burchett and some of Caldwell's family members believe that Caldwell was killed on the orders of Pol Pot, possibly following a disagreement between the two during their meeting. Alternatively, four of the guards at the guest house were arrested and two of them \\"confessed\\" after torture at the Khmer Rouge's S-21 prison that the killers were subversives attempting to undermine the Khmer Rouge regime and that Caldwell was killed \\"to prevent the Party from gathering friends in the world\\". Three days after Caldwell was killed, the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia and soon put an end to the Khmer Rouge government.

The video was produced by Gakken, Aniplex, and Movic. The film has been dubbed into English by Media Blasters, and released on both Region 1 and 2 DVD.  Inspiration and concept  The Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman video is a parody of the famous Super Sentai series of Tokusatsu programs. The king of the alien planet, \\"Voice\\", has declared war against Earth. However, the war takes a peculiar form; it is a war of \\"Big Business\\". The king's plan is to send Prince Sasaki and his strategist, Seki, to Earth, in order to form a corporation which is large enough to rule Earth. The corporation would fund a television series titled \\"Greatman\\" and control its marketing. Earth, however, has The Special Duty Combat Unit Shinesman, a team of heroes ready to fight back. The opposing corporation, the \\"Right Trading Company\\" has created the Shinesman team along the lines of the superhero television programs of their day. The team of heroes includes: Shinesman Red, Shinesman Sepia, Shinesman Moss Green, Shinesman Salmon Pink, and Shinesman Gray. The heroes use weapons such as \\"Business Card Cutters\\" and \\"Tie Clip Bombs\\" to fight the aliens.\\"Shinesman\\" Anime World website. Accessed 23 April 2006.

Ryoichi Hayami / Shinesman Moss Green  Hayami believes himself popular with women; a \\"ladies' man\\". He helps Matsumoto to learn the ways of the Right Trading Company.  Shogo Yamadera / Shinesman Grey  Yamadera loves his car, a Montero. He becomes very anxious if someone else is working on it. He believes his color, grey, represents regal manliness.  Shotaro Ono / Shinesman Sepia  Ono is a devoted husband and father. He loves his little girl, Tamari. He keeps her photo on his desk and buys her a fish soft toy. He is unimpressed by the team's weapons.  Riko Hidaka / Shinesman Salmon Pink  Hidaka is the only female in the team. Although she is an office girl she objects to being sent to get cigarettes or coffee. She tends to accidentally break things by crushing them.  Kyoko Sakakibara  Sakakibara is the Manager of Human Resources at the Good Trading Company. She is also the team's deputy leader. She fantasizes about being a Shinesman herself one day. She dislikes the color of four of the team. Her assistant is Tsukasa Nakamura.  Hitomi Kasahara/Lafure  Kasahara is a sweet-natured and timid secretary who is actually from Voice. She came to Earth in search of her brother, who disappeared. Only Sakakibara knows her secret. = Antagonists =  Prince Suguru Sasaki  Sasaki leads the alien attack on Earth. Despite his leading role, Sasaki is angry at having to pose as a corporate employee. He is also unhappy to be working with his cousin, Shiina.  Prince Akihito Seki  Seki is Lafure's brother. They are from Voice. Seki once opposed Voice's invasion of Earth. He was brainwashed and now joins Sasaki's mission. He has also forgotten his sister, so when Seki meets Hitomi/Lafure, he assumes that she is a spy. This particular plot point has not been resolved (see the notes below).  Princess Shiina  Shiina is Sakaki's excitable and ditzy cousin. She never shows any bare skin to men as she states, she would have to 'marry or kill' them. Sakaki is annoyed she has come on his mission. Shiina falls in love with Matsumoto/Shinesman Red and starts to oppose Voice's invasion of Earth. Shiina appears only as an anime character.

Life Conzelmann studied at the universities of Tübingen and Marburg (where he was influenced by Hans von Soden and Rudolf Bultmann) and, after World War II (in which he was severely wounded), he became the assistant to Helmut Thielicke at the University of Tübingen. He served at the same time as a pastor and, from 1948, as a religion teacher in a secondary school. In 1951 he submitted his dissertation and, in 1952, his Habilitation (Dr. habil.) at Heidelberg University. He then took a position teaching New Testament at Heidelberg and was called, in 1954, to the University of Zurich, where he was made full professor in 1956. In 1960 he was called to be Professor of New Testament at the University of Göttingen, where he remained until his retirement in 1978. Work One of Conzelmann's major works was Die Mitte Der Zeit (Tübingen 1954), literally 'The Middle of Time', which was translated into English under the title, The Theology of St. Luke. This work, which approached Lukan theology by way of Redaction Criticism, paved the way for much scholarly discussion in the second half of the twentieth century. Conzelmann, along with other post-Bultmannian scholars, challenged the view that Jesus was an apocalyptic figure, but rather focused on the message of Christ as the kingdom of God breaking into the present. This was a challenge to the portrait of Jesus as expecting an imminent eschaton. Conzelmann contends that Jesus' teaching about eschatology is unconnected to his words about God and ethics.  Concept of Salvation History  Perhaps Conzelmann's main contribution to the study of Luke's Gospel was his contention that Luke changed the emphasis in Jesus' teaching from an expectation that he (Jesus) would return shortly after his death, resurrection and ascension (a belief in the imminent parousia) to seeing God at work in history and therefore that the early Christians needed to find ways of living as disciples of Christ 'in the long haul' through history. This theological emphasis was called Heilsgeschichte (usually translated into English as \\"Salvation History\\"). Conzelmann thought that history could be divided into three eras: 1\\\\. the Old Testament period (up to and including John the Baptist) 2\\\\. the period of Jesus' earthly ministry (which Conzelmann said was free from interference from Satan) 3\\\\. the era of the Church. These details have been challenged by later scholars - for example by asking where John the Baptist most accurately fits and if the life of Jesus really was a 'Satan free zone'.See e.g. Christopher Tuckett, Luke, (Sheffield Academic Press Guide) chapter 2.

He was its representative or orator when it sought a favor or a privilege, defended it when unjustly accused, and besought the aid of the Holy See when its rights, property or interests were violated or imperiled.  Antecedents :See also Protector (title) In ancient Rome a similar relationship had existed between the client (cliens) and his patronus (hence 'patron'); as Rome's power grew, a still closer analogy is visible between the Roman institution and the modern ecclesiastical protectorate. Nearly every provincial city had its patronus, or procurator, in imperial Rome, usually a Roman patrician or eques, and such persons were held in high esteem. Thus Cicero was patronus of Dyrrachium (later Durazzo, now Durrës) and of Capua, in which Campanian city a gilded statue was raised to him. In time the office became hereditary in certain families; Suetonius wrote, in his life of Tiberius, that the [imperial] Claudian family (gens Claudia) was from ancient times protector of Sicily and the Peloponnesus.Benigni, Umberto. \\"Cardinal Protector.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 3. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 5 Jan. 2015  Titular churches  Every cardinal (except a Cardinal-Patriarch) is also, since the reign of John Paul II, called the Cardinal protector of the title (titular church s.s. for a Cardinal priest or Cardinal-deaconry for a Cardinal deacon) in or near Rome which he is assigned to, which gives him his title and benefits from his material support for upkeep or restoration, especially when he holds a rich see (usually as Archbishop).  Cardinal protectors of religious orders  The Roman Church adopted this, with many other imperial institutions, as one serviceable for external administration, not that the popes who first conferred this office and title sought to copy an ancient Roman usage, but because analogous conditions and circumstances created a similar situation. The office is conferred by the pope through the Cardinal secretary of state, sometimes by spontaneous designation of the Pope, sometimes at the request of those who seek such protection. Such a cardinal protector had the right to place his coat-of-arms on the church or main edifice of the institute, or on the municipal palace of the city in question. The first to hold such an office was Cardinal Ugolino Conti (later Pope Gregory IX), who sought thereby to paralyze the intrigues of his many enemies at Rome; at the request of St. Francis himself, he was named protector of the Franciscans by Pope Innocent III, and again by Honorius III. Alexander IV and Nicholas III retained for themselves the office of protector of the Franciscans. Indeed, the latter were long the only order that could boast of a cardinal protector; it was only in the fourteenth century that gradually the office was extended. As early as 1370 Pope Gregory XI was obliged to restrain the abuses committed by the cardinal protector of the Franciscans; Pope Martin V (1417–31) forbade the acceptance by the protector of a religious order of any payment for his protection. While Sixtus IV and Julius II defined more particularly the limits of the office, Pope Innocent XII (1691-1700) must be credited with a lasting regulation of the duties and rights of a cardinal protector. Cardinal protectors of monarchs, states, and regional churches The earliest known example of a cardinal protector occurs in correspondence between Pope Urban V and King Louis of Hungary (1342–1382), in which Cardinal Guillaume de Jugié has entered into a mutual agreement with King Louis to protect (promote) each other's interests.Cotta-Schönberg, p. 7. : \\"quamvis teneamus indubie serenitatem tuam non ignorare. dilectum filium nostrum Guillermum sancte Marie in cosmedin diaconum cardinalem fore tui honoris et status ac tui regni fervidum zelatorem, et apud sedem apostolicam solicitum promotorem, et non expedire in favorem dicti cardinalis penes serenitatem eamdem adiici preces nostras, quia tamen decet. quod nos, qui continuo experimento videmus ipsum cardinalem apud sedem predictam tua tuorumque gentium negotia diligenti solicitudine prosequentem, eum tue magnitudini commendemus, celsitudinem regiam rogamus attente. quatenus pro nostra et prefate sedis reverencia procuratores ac familiares, et beneficia ecclesiastica ac iura cardinalis eiusdem in tuo regno consistencia suscipias propensius commendata.\\" (14 May 1365) Emperors, kings, and other dignitaries, were permitted to have cardinal protectors, until Pope Urban VI (1378–89) forbade such cardinals to receive anything from the respective sovereigns of these states, lest through love of money they should be led to abet works of injustice. In 1424 Pope Martin V forbade the cardinals to accept the protectorate of kings and princes.Cotta-Schönberg, p. 8. : \\"Protectiones Regum, Principum, Comitum aliorumque personarum saecularium non assumant, assumptasque non exerceant, ut liberius ipsi sanctissimo in consiliis ac aliis actibus valeant assistere.” Pope Eugenius IV, in his instructions to Cardinal Giulio Cesarini, his legate and president of the Council of Basel, wrote that cardinals should not be protectors of lords or communities.Cotta-Schönberg, p. 8, with note 4, citing Wodka (1938), p. 5, who quoted a manuscript in the Vatican: \\"Item quod non sint protectores dominorum aut communitatum”. And in March 1436, the council duly decreed: \\"And as the cardinals should assist him who is the common father of all [the pope], it is highly improper for them to make distinctions between persons or to become their advocates. Therefore this Holy Synod decrees forbids them, as co-judges, to represent any particular interest even if they themselves come from the country concerned. And they should not be partial protectors or defenders of any prince or community or anybody else against anybody, with or without payment. But freed of all passion, they should assist the pope in settling conflicts through concord and justice. But this Holy Synod encourages them to promote the just affairs of princes and all others, especially the poor and the religious orders, without payment and profit, but purely as a work of charity.” Cardinals, therefore, could not be Protectors, but they could be Promoters. The door had been reopened a crack.Cotta-Schönberg, p. 9. with note 17. At the time the council was still in communion with the pope. The prohibition was renewed in 1492 by Pope Alexander VI. Cardinal Francesco Todeschini-Piccolomini, the nephew of Pope Pius II, served as the protector of England at the Roman Curia from 1492 to 1503,William E. Wilkie (1974), The cardinal protectors of England. Cambridge University Press. , p. 18. W.E. Wilkie (1996). The Beginnings of Cardinal Protectorship of England: Francesco Todeschini Piccolomini, 1492-1503. Fribourg 1996. He also served as Protector of Germany. Cardinal Marco Vigerio was Protector of King Christian I of Denmark and the Danish nation, ca. 1513–1516.Cotta-Schönberg, p. 15. On 5 May 1514, in the ninth session of the Lateran Council, Pope Leo X promulgated his bull, \\"Supernae dispositionis\\", extensively reforming the Roman Curia. A lengthy section addressed the position and functions of cardinals. Leo points out that popes give assistance to the common Father of all Christian faithful, and that advocates of individuals are an annoyance. He therefore orders that cardinals should not take up any position of partiality, either of princes or communities, or of other people against some one person, nor should they become promoters or defenders unless some point of justice or equity demands it, or their own dignity and condition requires it. They shouold separate themselves from every private passion. The just business of princes and other persons, and especially the poor and religious persons should move them with pious feeling, and they should help the oppressed and unjustly harassed according to their abilities and the obligation of their office. A great deal of maneuvering space was left for the cardinalatial conscience and ingenuity by the \\"unless\\" clause. No mention of annuities, subsidies, or anything financial is made.Cotta-Schönberg, pp. 14-15. Until the Portuguese Revolution of 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal was the only state with a cardinal protector.  Roman curia  Within the papal Roman curia, a cardinal is also appointed as protector of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, which trains papal diplomats.

It is the largest garden-landscaped neighborhood in the state of Alabama. Built in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is one of Montgomery's \\"genteel\\" areas. The term serves two purposes: the \\"original\\" Cloverdale area, and the larger area, which includes other historic neighborhoods such as Cloverdale-Idlewild. History Purchased by William Graham in 1817, Cloverdale rests in a portion of the original lot. This area of land was originally called \\"Graham's Woods\\" because of its thick growth and distance from the city of Montgomery. The landscape was covered with virgin pines, a few of which still exist on the lawns of some Cloverdale homes. Consequently, this area was sometimes called \\"The Pines\\" in addition to the name \\"Graham's Woods\\". In addition to the pine trees, there were also a number of open glens where clover grew in abundance, and this seems to be the likely origin of the name, Cloverdale, which was adopted in 1892. The picturesque natural garden landscape developed in Europe during the early 19th century and was popularized during the mid-century in America by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted was America's preeminent landscape architect and responsible for a number of nineteenth century residential suburbs, including Riverside (1869) in Chicago and Druid Hills (1893) in Atlanta, Georgia. The plan for Cloverdale has basic qualities which are similar to Olmsted's suburban residential designs elsewhere around the country. Olmsted was at work on the landscape plan for the Alabama State Capitol grounds in Montgomery in 1889, contemporary with the early development of Cloverdale. No documentation, however, has yet surfaced to substantiate any definite Olmsted influence. A more likely designer of Cloverdale was the English landscape architect Joseph Forsyth Johnson, who emigrated to America in the 1870s after a successful career designing the grounds for a number of estates in England, Ireland and Russia. A comparison of Cloverdale with Johnson's design for the residential suburb Inman Park in Atlanta reveals some remarkable similarities. Both, for example, had proposed lake sites and both have long, narrow, central park areas surrounded by curving streets. The earliest documentation discovered for the construction of a house in Cloverdale is from a letter dated 1892. This house, which was located on the corner of what is now Felder Avenue and Norman Bridge Road, was demolished for an apartment complex in the late 1940s. In 1893, The Cloverdale Land and Development Company was bankrupt, due to the nationwide economic panic of that period. During the next fifteen years, the Cloverdale site lay dormant with the exception of some activity along the north side of Felder Avenue, where a small golf course and tennis courts were built, the beginning of the Montgomery Country Club. In 1908, there were only ten houses in Cloverdale, but by 1916 there were one hundred twenty-five. Many of these homes were designed by Montgomery's leading architects, B. B. Smith, Weatherly Carter, Frank Lockwood Sr., and Frank Lockwood Jr. One house was designed by Mobile architect Nicholas Holmes Sr. In 1910, the residents of Cloverdale voted for the first time to incorporate their suburb into a self-governing village. They elected Charles Tullis as the first mayor. This period also saw the development of a small commercial strip on the corner of Norman Bridge Road and the north side of Cloverdale Road, and this became Montgomery's first suburban commercial area. In the late 1920s, another similar business strip began to develop on the corner of Fairview Avenue and Woodley Road. Cloverdale has been one of Montgomery's choice residential areas since the turn of the century. It is one of Montgomery's earliest suburbs and is the oldest landscape garden designed residential area in Alabama, predating similar areas in Birmingham. Its short existence as an incorporated village (1910–1927) gave it a special sense of neighborhood, which it has retained to some degree to the present day. Old Cloverdale Historic District The original landscaped area of Cloverdale is now known as Old Cloverdale. Old Cloverdale is between Felder Avenue and East Fairview Avenue from the north & south, and between Norman Bridge Road from the west and College Street, Watson Avenue & College Court from the east.http://www.oldcloverdale.org/map.html Areas outside of these boundaries are not inside the Old Cloverdale Historic District; parts of some surrounding neighborhoods such as the Garden District, Edgewood, and Cloverdale-Idlewild are part of what some generically call the \\"Cloverdale\\" area of Montgomery. The neighborhood of Old Cloverdale became an official historic district on December 17, 1996.http://www.oldcloverdale.org/historicdesignationcompliance.html This helps to maintain and protect the charm, look, and character of the neighborhood. Old Cloverdale is home to Cloverdale Park, Mary Ann Neely Park, Fitzgerald Park, LeGrande Park, and Milo Howard Park.http://www.funinmontgomery.com/Parks/Parks Demographics Cloverdale was listed as an incorporated town on the 1920 U.S. Census with a population of 537.

The book was published in 1977. Synopsis Charlie Muffin is one of the top operatives in British Intelligence, despite his working-class background and scruffy appearance, and has been responsible for breaking up a major Soviet spy network in England, sending the network's leader Alexei Berenkov to prison for forty years. However, a new Director, Sir Henry Cuthbertson, who has a military background rather than in espionage, has reorganised the Department according to his own regimented and prejudicial ideas...which don't include a true professional like Charlie, whom he looks down upon and despises, and has appointed two of his favourites, Snare and Harrison, to major field positions, despite their obvious lack of experience. Charlie, Snare and Harrison are on assignment in East Berlin and are about to separately make the crossing over to West Berlin. Harrison has safely made the crossing earlier and Snare is about to do so; Charlie, who will make his own crossing by car later, is very nervous about the heightened security. Snare makes an uneventful crossing, but Charlie meets up with Gunther, an East Berlin student trying to escape to the West, and gives him the car he was supposed to cross over in and necessary documents. With Charlie watching from a distance, Gunther drives the car into the East Berlin checkpoint, but the security people suddenly move in and Gunther is shot down while trying to run. Charlie makes his own crossing and meets up in West Berlin with his fellow agents, who are stunned to see him alive having seen and had reported his supposed death ... confirming in Charlie's mind that the whole business was a set-up to get him captured or killed. In Moscow, General Valery Kalenin, chief planner of the KGB, is informed by his superiors of Berenkov's 40-year prison sentence. He is ordered to make sure that Berenkov is repatriated back to the Soviet Union within a reasonable amount of time...or else. Charlie visits Berenkov, with whom he has apparently become friendly, in prison for an interrogation which appears to Cuthbertson, his deputy Wilberforce, Snare and Harrison to be a complete failure. Cuthbertson is determined to have Charlie demoted as far as possible and has recommended as much to his Minister. However, Charlie proves that his interrogation \\"was one of the most productive [he] can remember having had with a captured spy,\\" and has provided valuable information which Cuthbertson has been unable to realise. Charlie spends the evening with Janet, Cuthbertson's secretary and god-daughter, with whom he is having an affair. After learning that Cuthbertson will be placing the blame for his premature recommendations on Wilberforce, Charlie promises that Cuthbertson will begging him for his help. At a reception at the US Embassy in Moscow, Kalenin, who has never been seen in public before, makes a public appearance, which amazes William Braley, the Resident CIA operative, and provokes interest by snubbing the Americans and concentrating his attentions on the British Embassy members present. Informed of this, both Garson Ruttgers, Director of the CIA, and Cuthbertson come to the same conclusion: Kalenin wants to defect, but to the British, not to the Americans. Knowing that two opportunities to contact Kalenin are coming up, one at a Trade Fair in Leipzig and one at a party at the British Embassy in Moscow, Cuthbertson dispatches Harrison to Leipzig and Snare to Moscow to contact Kalenin and make arrangements for the hoped-for defection, while Ruttgers, arriving in London and kept on the outside by Cuthbertson, is determined that his agency will be involved. Harrison makes a very clumsy contact with Kalenin in Leipzig, but is killed shortly afterwards trying to escape in a panic from Eastern German security forces. Cuthbertson, learning of this, decides not to tell Snare. At the British Embassy in Moscow, Snare meets briefly with Kalenin, who drops some pointed hints about how he can be contacted at a public park. However, Snare is seized shortly afterwards immediately by KGB agents and charged with black market dealing. With no choice left, Cuthbertson is forced to ask Charlie for help. Charlie is certain that Kalenin's intended defection is a set-up, but agrees on condition that he be allowed to operate without interference. He makes his own way to Moscow, successfully contacts Kalenin (learning from Kalenin that Harrison and Snare were identified to the KGB by the CIA) and settles the main details about Kalenin's crossing from Czechoslovakia into Austria and about the amount of money to be paid to Kalenin ($500,000 in US currency). Back in London at a meeting in Cuthbertson's office, Ruttgers (who has been using a threat by the US State Department that the President may snub London in an upcoming European tour to force the British into co-operating) is stunned to learn that Charlie has made successful contact with Kalenin without his knowledge. He is even more outraged by Charlie's insisting that the money (provided by the Americans) must be laundered by himself and Braley, and that Braley must remain close to Charlie at all times (thereby neutralising the possibility of Charlie being exposed), but the threat of the facts about Snare and Harrison's exposure being revealed makes him give in. Cuthbertson confronts Janet about her affair with Charlie and instructs her to keep him informed about Charlie. She agrees ... in exchange for expenses. Charlie and Braley hit casinos throughout Europe, \\"washing\\" the money and taking down random serial numbers. Later, they meet with Kalenin in Prague and finalise the details of the crossing at an obscure Czech border point. Charlie is still very worried and makes no secret of his belief that the whole thing is a big mistake on their part. Meanwhile, Berenkov is not adapting well to prison life and is beginning to crumble, while in Moscow Kalenin's superiors berate him for his apparent lack of progress in getting Berenkov back. Both Cuthbertson and Ruttgers decide to move 200 agents (100 British and 100 American) into Austria to safeguard Kalenin and to go themselves to meet with Kalenin at the CIA safehouse in Vienna. Charlie arrives in Vienna and is briefed on the plan (part of which, such as that the car he'll be driving will contain a radio- controlled bomb, he is not told). Both he and Braley (who is now as uneasy as Charlie) make their concerns known to their respective bosses, but are disregarded. Charlie and Braley arrive that night at the border crossing point and, as per Kalenin's instructions, Charlie crosses over with the money onto Czech soil to meet with the waiting Kalenin. After verifying the money, the two men cross back over into Austria and drive with Braley to the Vienna safehouse. There, Charlie leaves them to hide the car while Kalenin and Braley enter the safehouse. Cuthbertson and Ruttgers welcome Kalenin and outline the intended plan to get him out of Austria. However, to their surprise, Kalenin seems to know as much about it as they do, and they are even more amazed by his next words: that, in retaliation for the destruction of the Berenkov network and Berenkov's imprisonment, the Soviet Union had decided to both have Berenkov repatriated and deal to the Western Intelligence communities \\"as harmful a blow as possible.\\" To that end, he used himself as bait and the plan has worked perfectly: his men have captured the 200 British and American agents and now are in complete control of the house, and both Cuthbertson and Ruttgers will be going back with Kalenin to Moscow to be used as barter in exchange for Berenkov's release; the captured agents will be fingerprinted and photographed (making them useless for future Intelligence work) and then released. Cuthbertson and Ruttgers at first can't believe that this is happening, but then they realise that Charlie isn't there. Smiling, Kalenin confirms Cuthbertson's suspicions that Charlie had provided inside information and that Cuthbertson has only himself to blame because of his treatment of Charlie. The money is now Charlie's, and both Cuthbertson and Ruttgers realise with horror that they will not only be completely discredited but also made laughingstocks. Where they are in hiding, Charlie and Edith burn the recorded bills and relax. Charlie knows that he will be hunted, but assures Edith that no one will ever think of looking for the two of them where they are now (in Brighton). He also tells Edith that his affair with Janet (which Edith knew about all along) was necessary because it provided him with both a pipeline into Cuthbertson's office and chances to mislead Cuthbertson (since Charlie knew Janet was informing on him), but that he never loved Janet. In the novel's conclusion, Berenkov relaxes aboard a commercial flight to Moscow with a glass of champagne and toasts his absent friend. Sequels Several more novels featuring Charlie Muffin have been published since, including Here Comes Charlie M (published in the UK as Clap Hands Here Comes Charlie), The Blind Run, See Charlie Run, The Run Around, Comrade Charlie, Charlie's Apprentice, Dead Men Living, and Kings of Many Castles.

He is best known as the inventor of the hammerless shotgun, first introduced in 1878. Biography Born in Hopewell, New York, Uncle Dan Lefever's gunmaking career began as an apprentice in Canandaigua, New York in the early 1850s. He married Sarah Stead on June 10, 1857, in Canandaigua. He opened his own gunshop in Canandaigua in 1857. His principal business was making muzzle-loading rifles. In 1862 he joined with James Ellis to form Lefever & Ellis. They built long-range rifles which were used in the American Civil War. This partnership broke up in 1867. =Gun manufactory= Sometime before 1870 D. M. Lefever moved to Auburn, New York where he joined with Francis Dangerfield to form Dangerfield & Lefever. This firm made primarily breechloading double shotguns. They also converted muzzle-loading guns to breech-loading. This firm dissolved in late 1873 or early 1874. In early 1874 D. M. Lefever moved to Syracuse, New York. Here he joined with Lorenzo Barber to form Barber & Lefever. Again they made breech- loading shotguns and rifles. This partnership lasted a short two years. D. M. Lefever then joined with John Nichols and formed Nichols & Lefever. During this time D. M. Lefever worked on the development of the hammerless shotgun. These guns were cocked with a cocking lever on the side of the breech. In 1878 he won first prize at the St. Louis Bench Show and Sportsman's Association for the best breech-loading shotgun in America. =Automatic hammerless shotgun= By the time D. M. Lefever patented his hammerless shotgun in 1880 he had left Nichols & Lefever and gone into business for himself. In 1883 D. M. Lefever patented the first truly automatic hammerless shotgun. This internalized the cocking mechanism so that the gun was automatically cocked when the breech was closed. He also patented the automatic ejector system which ejected the used shells when the breech was opened. In 1886 D. M. Lefever lost control of his company which by then was called Lefever Arms Company. However, he remained as superintendent until 1902. In 1902 D. M. Lefever left Lefever Arms Company to form D. M. Lefever, Sons & Company with sons Charles F. Lefever (also known as Fred who later invented the Model 25 Daisy BB pump gun\\"It's A Daisy\\" by Cass S. Hough, pp 45-52, 1976, Daisy Division Victor Comptometer Corporation, Rogers, Arkansas), Frank, and George. They continued to make fine hammerless shotguns, but could not compete with the larger Lefever Arms Company. In 1904 they moved to Ohio, first in Defiance and within a year in Bowling Green. In 1906 they returned to Syracuse, New York, however, before being able to re- establish a viable company D. M. Lefever died on October 29 in Syracuse of a stomach ulcer. His remains are interred, with his wife (who died in 1898), in Woodlawn Cemetery in Syracuse. LeFever Arms Co. Optimus Grade shotgun The Lefever Arms Company continued to make fine Lefever designed shotguns in Syracuse until 1916 when they were purchased by the Ithaca Gun Company. Ithaca continued to produce Lefever-designed guns under the Lefever Arms Company name in Ithaca, New York until 1921. These were made using primarily left-over parts from the Syracuse operation. Shortly after that the Ithaca Gun Company used the Lefever name to market an inexpensive gun, the \\"Lefever Nitro Special\\", that was of their own design, having nothing to do with D. M. Lefever except to exploit his name. These were manufactured until the early 1940s. Many collectors consider original \\"D.M. Lefever\\" guns to be the finest ever produced in America. Uncle Dan LeFever Cup The Lefever Arms Collectors Association created the \\"Uncle Dan Lefever Cup\\" in honor of the legacy of D.M. Lefever. The \\"Uncle Dan LeFever Cup\\" shoot-off is held annually during a LACA designated trap shoot event. The highest scoring shooter wins a trophy engraved with the year the champion won. Only LACA members, firing Lefever guns, are eligible for the award. The first \\"Uncle Dan Lefever Cup\\" was awarded during the Greater Northeast Side by Side in Friendsville, PA, on June 6, 2010. LACA held the 2nd Annual shoot-off during the June 2011 Nimrod Classic in Bozeman, MT.

She is the daughter of Mors Kajak, Jed (chieftain) of Lesser Helium, and the granddaughter of Tardos Mors, Jeddak (overlord or high king) of Helium. She is the love interest and later the wife of John Carter, an Earthman mystically transported to Mars, and subsequently the mother of their son Carthoris and daughter Tara. She plays the role of the conventional damsel in distress who must be rescued from various perils, but is also portrayed as a competent and capable adventurer in her own right, fully capable of defending herself and surviving on her own in the wastelands of Mars.  Description  Except for some jewelry, all of the planet's races seem to eschew clothing and look down upon Earth's inhabitants because they do wear clothing. As Burroughs describes Dejah Thoris:  Publication history  Dejah Thoris first appeared as the title character in the initial Mars novel, A Princess of Mars (1917). Written between July and September 28, 1911, the novel was serialized as Under the Moons of Mars in the pulp magazine The All- Story from February to July 1912. It later appeared as a complete novel only after the success of Burroughs' Tarzan series. For its October 1917 hardcover publication by A.C. McClurg & Company, the novel was retitled A Princess of Mars. She reappeared in subsequent volumes of the series, most prominently in the second, The Gods of Mars (1918), the third, The Warlord of Mars (1919), the eighth, Swords of Mars (1936), and the eleventh, John Carter of Mars (1964). Dejah Thoris is also mentioned or appeared in a minor role in other volumes of the series.  Other media  =Comics= Dejah Thoris has appeared in numerous adaptations of the Martian stories, such as in a 1995 storyline of Tarzan's Sundays comic strip and various comic book series featuring her husband John Carter. She is mentioned in the first issue of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume II during a conversation between John Carter and Gullivar Jones. She is a prominent character in Dynamite Entertainment's 2010-11 comic miniseries Warlord of Mars, based on A Princess of Mars. She first appears in issue 6. Dejah Thoris is also the main character of the Dynamite spinoff comic Warlord of Mars: Dejah Thoris, which ran 37 issues. Set 400 years before A Princess of Mars, the first story arc portrays Dejah's role in the rise to power of the Kingdom of Helium, as well as her first suitor. The second story arc will depict her as the \\"Pirate Queen of Mars\\", other story arcs are: \\"The Boora Witch\\", \\"The Pirate Men of Saturn\\", \\"The Rise of the Machine Men\\", \\"The Phantoms of Time\\", and \\"Dual to the Death\\". Each were collected into a trade paperback. The entire series is being collected into a series of omnibus volume, the first collecting the first 20 issues. There was also 2 other mini-series, the 4-issue Dejah Thoris and the White Apes of Mars (2012) and the 12-issue Dejah Thoris and the Green Men of Mars (2013–14). In the 2018 series Warriors of Mars, her mother is given as Princess Heru from Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation. Dejah Thoris is the name of a boat that Professor Xavier is seen on in Uncanny X-Men #98. =Other novels/short stories/games= In Pierce Brown's book Morning Star, Dejah Thoris is the name of a dreadnought battleship, which belongs to a character nicknamed Mustang. Dr. Dejah Thoris \\"Deety\\" (for D.T.) Carter, née Burroughs, is a protagonist in Robert A. Heinlein's The Number of the Beast and The Pursuit of the Pankera. Burroughs's Dejah Thoris is also referred to in Heinlein's novel Glory Road by the protagonist when contemplating his female companion, Star. In the story \\"Mars: The Home Front\\" by George Alec Effinger, Dejah Thoris is kidnapped by the sarmaks and taken to their space gun base. John Carter assembles a Barsoomian force to both rescue her and foil the sarmaks' plan to invade Jasoom. In the earlier prequel short story \\"Allan and the Sundered Veil\\" by Alan Moore, a 'time lost' Carter sees a vision of himself fighting a Green Martian and winning Dejah Thoris in a \\"chrono-crystal aleph\\" (from Jorge Luis Borges's \\"The Aleph\\") In The Apocalypse Troll by David Weber, Richard Aston refers to the very human-looking female he has rescued from a sinking UFO as Dejah Thoris. In the Junot Diaz book The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Oscar describes a neighbor girl as being \\"so pretty she could have played young Dejah Thoris.\\" In the board game ANDROID, one of the six murder suspects, a human woman from the Mars colony, is named Dejah Thoris. =Films= Traci Lords portrayed Dejah Thoris in The Asylum's direct- to-DVD film Princess of Mars. In the Disney film John Carter, released on March 9, 2012, she is played by Lynn Collins. In this version, she is the daughter of Tardos Mors, rather than his granddaughter, and is also Helium's leading scientist. She is the name of the \\"Belgium Witch of Marwencol\\" in the documentary Marwencol, which the film Welcome to Marwen is based upon.

It was intended by the faculty to become, like its predecessor the 1914 Catholic Encyclopedia, a standard reference work for students, teachers, librarians, journalists, and general readers interested in the history, doctrine, practices, and people of the Catholic faith. However, unlike its predecessor, its first edition also contained more general articles on science, education, and the liberal arts. The NCE was originally published by McGraw-Hill in 1967. A second edition, which gave up the articles more reminiscent of a general encyclopedia, was published in 2002 and was listed as one of Library Journals \\"Best Reference Sources\\" for 2003. First edition The original Catholic Encyclopedia was published between 1907 and 1914, first by the Robert Appleton Company, which was specifically created for that purpose, and then by its successor The Encyclopedic Press Inc. Supplements to the Catholic Encyclopedia were published in 1922 and in 1958. In 1960, the Catholic University of America, in collaboration with the McGraw-Hill Book Company, began work on what was planned as an entirely new encyclopedia, and seven years later (in 1967) published the 15-volume New Catholic Encyclopedia (NCE1). Alphabetic supplemental volumes appeared in 1974, 1979, 1989, and 1996.  Jubilee Volume  In 2001, in collaboration with the Catholic University of America, Gale Publishing, a Thomson company, published a Jubilee Volume: The Wojtyła Years, which focuses on the pontificate of John Paul II and included thematic essays that covered the person, his work and pontificate in two parts: # From the Poland of Karol Wojtyła to the World of John Paul II — Thematic Essays # John Paul II and His Pontificate The second part offers various sections (e.g. \\"Magisterial Documents\\", \\"People and Places, Institutions and Events\\"), the content for each of which is arranged with entries in alphabetic order. At times listed as volume 20 of NCE1, it was envisioned by the editor \\"not so much as a supplement to the original edition as a propaedia, a preamble, to the revised edition of the NCE\\", which was to follow a year later. Some of the material of the Jubilee Volume appeared in later supplements, notably the 2010 supplement to NCE2 (see next section). Second edition The second edition of the NCE (NCE2), incorporating material from the original edition and its supplements, along with further additions and revisions, was published by Gale Publishing in 2002. It was published in fourteen volumes, with the fifteenth volume being a cumulative index to the entire encyclopedia. Later supplemental volumes appeared for this second edition. In addition to the hundreds of new signed articles on a wide variety of topics, the second edition also featured biographies of contemporary religious figures; thousands of photographs, maps and illustrations; and some updated bibliographical citations. The photographs remained black and white. =Reviews= NCE2 received mixed reviews. While applauding the effort, reviewers found the updating to be spotty, for example, many bibliographies were not updated, new notable buildings were omitted, and important new research results were not included. In addition, a large number of articles and 3.5 million words that appeared in NCE1 were omitted entirely. An editor, Berard Marthaler, said that the reduction in size \\"had to be done with a meat cleaver, not a scalpel.\\" Controversial subjects were, to some extent, avoided in the second edition; for example, as Jan Malcheski and Herman Sutter both noted in their reviews, an article from the 1996 NCE1 supplement on pedophilia was omitted in the NCE2. The tone of the multi-author work was also variable, from older, scholarly articles such as the one on \\"Aristotle\\", to those pitched for a more general audience such as the article on \\"Joy\\". =Supplementation for the second edition= In the summer of 2006, the publisher, Gale, together with the Catholic University of America Press, developed a plan for ongoing updating of the second edition in both print and electronic (eBook) formats. The updating plan indicated a special focus on the United States. The planned new entries included biographies as well as articles on movements, organizations, documents and ideas that are either Catholic or of special interest to Catholics. The first of these New Catholic Encyclopedia supplemental volumes. Supplement 2009 was published electronically in June 2009 and in print in November 2009. It focused on the theme of \\"Science and the Church\\", and contained such new articles as the ones on Charles Darwin and Sigmund Freud. A review of the 2009 supplement. It also updated the articles on the Catholic Church in each of the fifty States, as well as the 33 US archdiocese articles. It contains much updated bibliography. Most of the editors now belong to Catholic institutions other than the Catholic University of America. Supplement 2010, published in June 2010, focused on the theme \\"Church in Modern History\\", with particular emphasis on World War II and thereafter. It included about 200 entries on those beatified or canonized since 2003. Most of the beatified were new entries, while most of the Saints were revisions of previous articles, although overall the 2010 supplement had more new entries than revised (updated) ones. Supplement 2011 focused on the theme \\"Church and the Arts and Music\\"; among its new article were one on the sex abuse crisis and one on Pope Benedict XVI, as well as new entries on St. Mary Helen McKillop (1842–1907) and St. Andre Bessette (1845–1937). \\"Ethics and Philosophy\\" was the theme for the 2012-2013 supplement.

Among Haupt's arguments are that contemporary hip hop music provides critical insights into the inheritance of violence in post-apartheid South Africa. He contends that, despite commercial and often sexist imperatives in mainstream hip hop music, South Africa has produced a number of socially conscious hip hop artists, who are reluctant to compromise their art and political views.

He led a 52-man company of artillery at the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776. Situated on high ground at the head of King and Queen Streets, his two brass 6-pound cannons and other American guns helped dominate the battlefield. He was promoted to major on March 3, 1777 and lieutenant colonel on December 2, 1778. He resigned October 7, 1781. Forrest was elected as a Federalist to the Sixteenth Congress. He served as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture during the 16th United States Congress. The Committee on Agriculture was created on May 3, 1820. The population of the country was about 9 million and there were 213 Representatives in the House. Seven of these Representatives, under the chairmanship of Forrest were assigned to the new committee. Six other States were represented in this group: Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia. (The United States Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry was founded December 9, 1825.) He was again elected as a Federalist to the 17th United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of William Milnor. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1822.

The company, owned by Claudio and Mario Cirigliano, also operated long-distance services on the General Mitre Railway to central-western Argentina and on the General Urquiza Railway to northern Argentina and Uruguay on the international Tren de los Pueblos Libres. From 2004 to 2012 TBA - a company part of the Plaza Group, controlled by the Cirigliano family-\\"Un imperio llamado familia Cirigliano\\", Agencia CNA, 4 Jun 2010 also formed part of the consortium Unidad de Gestión Operativa Ferroviaria de Emergencia (UGOFE) which operated other commuter rail services in Buenos Aires. In more recent years, the company has become synonymous with the collapse of the railways in Argentina under privatisation and the company is under numerous investigations and legal proceedings. History Double decker carriages made by Emfer for TBA. TBA was established in 1995 after the Carlos Menem's administration privatised all the railway network, giving the company concession to operate the metropolitan Mitre and Sarmiento railway lines by Decree N° 730/95. The company took over both lines on 27 May. During the first two years of concession, TBA met the requirements specified on the contract, about the frequency of the service, with an average of 98%. By February 1999 the consortium had invested US$200 million, which included the reconstruction of 220 Toshiba carriages and the remodelling of 13 stations and workshops. In addition, a new ticket selling system was introduced with the installation of automated counters. One of the most notable improvements was the introduction of \\"Puma\\" coaches in the Retiro-Tigre branch. Those coaches had been built by local factory Emprendimientos Ferroviarios S.A. (EMFER) and featured air conditioning, ABS brakes and computer-supervising systems.Detalle de los coches Puma en sitio web de EMFER (Archive) In 1997 the Government decided to modify the contracts of concession with a plan of modernisation for US$2.5 billion. The future investments required the acquisition of 492 brand- new electric multiple units, refurbishing of more than 100 km of existing tracks, and the installation of new signalling, among other improvements. Nevertheless, the Government of Fernando De la Rúa (who had come to power in 1999) made changes to the original project, reducing the amount of the budget to US$1.3 billion. As compensation to the companies, the State granted subsidies to TBA (and the rest of the private operators) as a way to compensate losses. In addition to the commuter rail services on Sarmiento and Mitre Lines, TBA also operated the long-distance passenger trains on the General Mitre Railway from Retiro to the cities of Rosario, Santa Fe, and points between, in northern Argentina. Including all its commuter and long- distance services, the company ran approximately 1,000 trains per day and carried about 147.7 million passengers annually, or 500,000 daily. From 2004 the company also formed part of Unidad de Gestión Operativa Ferroviaria de Emergencia (UGOFE), a consortium with railway companies Metrovías and Ferrovías, which took over the running of commuter rail services on Belgrano Sur, Roca and San Martín lines in Buenos Aires after concessions granted to Metropolitano S.A. for the operation of these services were revoked. =Revocation of concession= Puma train in Trenes Argentinos livery, being retired from service (2014). Following a commuter train accident on February 22, 2012, at Once Station, Buenos Aires, in which 51 people died and at least 703 people were injured, TBA was placed under federal intervention on February 28; its concessions to operate the Mitre and Sarmiento lines were ultimately revoked on May 24. After the cancellation of the contact, both lines were taken over by the consortium Unidad de Gestión Operativa Mitre Sarmiento (UGOMS) and later Trenes Argentinos, putting them back in state hands. In October 2015, an Exposé in the conservative daily newspaper La Nación highlighted the firm's apparent mismanagement while in charge of the commuter rail lines. The article revealed large expenditures by the private company on luxury items like jewellery and champagne, as well as trips to Doha and Dubai. At the same time, the company is still under investigation due to the Once Tragedy and still has AR$ 70 million worth of unpaid fines as a result of its business practices.Los gastos insólitos de TBA, la firma que tenía la concesión del tren Sarmiento - La Nacion, 4 October 2015. It has also been revealed that the company had bribed the former transport minister Ricardo Jaime, who is also under investigation.Ricardo Jaime admits to taking bribes - Buenos Aires Herald, 1 October 2015. Sergio Cigliano, one of the owners of TBA, has been convicted to nine years in prison for negligence surrounding the original accident which had resulted in the revocation of concession.

The novel is about an undercover policeman looking for a homosexual serial killer in the gay New York City of 1970 before S/M and leather subcultures became well known (they existed but not to the extent they were portrayed in the film). The murder victims were closeted or relatively open (as open as they could be at the time) men who came across the killer while \\"cruising\\" for sex. While working undercover, the policeman develops feelings for his gay neighbor. Plot The novel focuses on three main characters, the killer Stuart Richards, the undercover policeman John Lynch, and the policeman Captain Edelson, who assigns the undercover role to Lynch. Each chapter (20 in total) focuses on one of the character's thoughts. Focus is placed on Lynch's feelings about various minority groups, including gay men and his feelings related to working undercover and how his life is changing as the job progresses. Additional focus is Richard's various heterosexual exploits, his rocky relationship with his father and many more memories of his life, both past and current, and Edelson's thoughts on the case and how he hopes it will garner him a promotion if he solves it. Film adaptation The novel was adapted as the 1980 film, also titled Cruising. There were substantial changes to the plot of the film, such as moving the killer into the world of sadomasochism and leather gay bars in Greenwich Village, New York. The movie includes the policeman Steve Burns (his name was changed from John Lynch) having an active sexual relationship with his girlfriend Nancy (played by Karen Allen). Neither of these facets are part of the plot of the novel. The film starred Al Pacino and was directed by William Friedkin.

He founded the Kappa Alpha Society (KA) in 1825 at Union College. Early life John Hart Hunter was born on May 3, 1807. His father, John Hunter, emigrated from Dublin, Ireland to Philadelphia in 1805 and then soon to New York where he worked as a bookkeeper. The elder John Hunter married Sarah Hart of White Plains. Hunter, a superb mathematician, soon gave up business for teaching. He also passed on his love for scholarship to his only son, John Hart Hunter. The younger Hunter developed his early education by extensive reading at the Apprentices' Public Library in New York. College Life John Hart Hunter entered college directly into the Junior Class at Union in 1824. He quickly became one of the leading academic scholars of the school at age 17. When Arthur Burtis Jr. entered Union in 1825 (also as a Junior following two years at Columbia), college president Eliphalet Nott personally insisted Hunter take him under his wing as roommate. Thus Hunter's plans for a single room were disrupted, and indirectly President Nott had set the stage for the foundation of Kappa Alpha. On November 26, 1825, John Hart Hunter founded the Kappa Alpha Society, the world's first Greek letter social fraternity, along with eight other students: six of them seniors in the class of 1826, and two juniors of the class of 1827. Upon graduating near the top of his class at Union in 1826, Hunter was admitted to the Princeton Theological Seminary where he studied until 1828.\\"Kappa Alpha to Celebrate Centennial\\". Schenectady Gazette. October 5, 1925. After Union Hunter was called in 1828 to serve as pastor of the Congregational Church of Fairfield, Connecticut. During his six-year tenure at Fairfield, he developed into a powerful preacher. John Hunter married Julia Maria Judson in 1830. Julia was a well-educated member of a prominent Stratford, Connecticut, family. She was born on January 11, 1811 in Stratford to Daniel and Sarah Judson. Julia graduated from Troy Female Seminary in 1827. John and Julia Hunter had nine children, including Daniel Judson Hunter, Julia E. Hunter, Kate P. Hunter, James Hunter, and Mary H. Hunter and four others.New York Tribune.

Schenectady Gazette. October 5, 1925. In 1851, Hunter moved west to Missouri with his son James, age 19, in hopes of improving the financial situation of his growing family. They had hoped to profit from land that Hunter had bought several years earlier. Hunter put the land to work for industrial purposes rather than simple farming. He later traded the land in Missouri for deeds to land in Texas. John Hart Hunter died of Congestion of the Lungs on February 12, 1872, at City Hospital in Galveston, Texas. He was buried the next day, February 13, 1872 in Galveston's Potter's field which is known today as Municipal Cemetery located at 61st Street and Avenue T 1/2. Julia Maria Judson Hunter died at the age of 95 on Saturday, October 14, 1905 at her home at 62 W 93rd Street in New York City.

This event is also sometimes called a Blister. The champagne model is perhaps one of the first numerical calculations of the propagation of ionisation fronts and of the expansion of HII regions that did not assume a constant density medium around the massive exciting star. The model assumes that star formation takes place in a dense cloud, surrounded and in pressure equilibrium with a low density inter-cloud gas. The ample supply of UV photons generated by the star rapidly establishes an HII region and the expansion of this, sooner or later allows also for the ionisation of the inter cloud gas. Ionisation disrupts then the former pressure balance between the cloud and the inter-cloud gas as under the stellar radiation field all photo-ionised gas acquires a temperature of the order of 10000 K. In this way, the ionised cloud material acquires an excess pressure, a pressure larger than the ionised low density inter cloud gas and this provoques the supersonic expansion of the ionised cloud matter into the surrounding gas (the champagne flow). The streaming of matter out of the cloud allows for the ionisation of a larger portion of the original cloud sustaining in this way the pressure imbalance which eventually leads to the complete disruption of the parent cloud. The terms champagne model and champagne flow were coined by Mexican astrophysicist Guillermo Tenorio-Tagle in a paper in 1979 (Astronomy and Astrophysics 1979A&A....71...59T;). The model focus on the size, velocity field and the large density variations observed in HII regions.

He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. He stands tall and weighs . Wilson is known for his large black beard, which he began growing during the 2010 pennant race. Wilson's entrance at home games accompanied by the song \\"Jump Around\\" was popular with fans. Wilson also portrayed Peterson, a pitcher in the movie Bottom of the 9th. Wilson pitched collegiately at Louisiana State University. His college career ended during his junior season, when he injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery. The San Francisco Giants selected him in the 2003 draft. He reached the major leagues in 2006 and had become the Giants' regular closer by the end of 2007. In 2010, he led the Majors with 48 saves which tied the franchise single season record while posting a 1.81 ERA, and he saved clinching games at every level of the playoffs, including the 2010 World Series over the Texas Rangers. In the first week of the 2012 season, Wilson injured his elbow and subsequently underwent his second Tommy John surgery. He completed his recovery midway through the 2013 season and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, pitching effectively with them as a late- inning reliever through the playoffs. However, he was not able to continue his success in 2014, and the Dodgers released him after that season. Early life Wilson was born in Winchester, Massachusetts on March 16, 1982. While he was in second grade, he moved to Londonderry, New Hampshire. Today, he talks little of his childhood except to discuss his father, Mike Wilson, who was an Air Force veteran and a demanding perfectionist. During fall, he would have Brian bag leaves and bury them in the woods; and in winter, he would have Brian spend seven hours shoveling snow on weekends. Brian said in a 2011 interview, \\"I think that's how you need to be raised. It's not your friend, it's your dad. And he's going to be strict. And one day you're going to understand why. And sometimes, it's a little too late. They might pass away, and you might not get that chance to say thanks or understand why you did those things. But when you become a man, you understand why.\\" When Wilson was 12 years old, his father was diagnosed with cancer. His father fought the disease for five years before dying while Wilson was attending Londonderry High School; Wilson today says he had to become a man when his father was diagnosed. In a 2011 story, ESPN.com writer Elizabeth Merrill said about Wilson's high school years, \\"He was an honor roll student at Londonderry, but clashed with various authority figures who didn't appreciate his occasional lack of a filter.\\" In the same story, a number of Londonderry faculty speculated that some teachers didn't understand Wilson's life situation at the time. Art Psaledas, an assistant principal at the school, added, \\"It happened at probably the worst time anybody could lose your dad. Watching his dad deteriorate over the years was probably the singular thing that formed his personality.\\" High school career Bob Napolitano, Wilson's coach at Londonderry High School, noticed Wilson's ability to concentrate on baseball. Napolitano specifically remembered the first home game of Wilson's senior year, which happened shortly after his father's death. No fewer than 29 professional scouts, all with radar guns, showed up to see him pitch. According to Napolitano, Wilson was completely oblivious to their appearance; he ate and drank in the dugout, warmed up, and pitched a two-hitter while apparently not noticing that scouts were there. The Cleveland Indians offered him a contract straight out of high school, but he did not sign, opting to attend college instead. College career After a coach saw Wilson pitch well at a tournament in California, he was offered a scholarship to Louisiana State University (LSU), where he played for the LSU Tigers baseball team, eventually becoming their No. 2 starter. In his time at LSU, Wilson pitched in 51 games (22 starts) and accumulated 18 wins, 10 losses, and five saves. In 2002, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was in the middle of his third season on March 28, 2003, when he injured his elbow and underwent Tommy John surgery. He also played for the Keene Swamp Bats of the New England Collegiate Baseball League, a summer league for collegiate prospects. Despite facing extensive rehabilitation, Wilson chose to enter the 2003 Major League Baseball draft. Professional career =Minor leagues= Coming off his surgery, Wilson was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 24th round in 2003. He began his career with the Hagerstown Suns of the Class-A South Atlantic League in 2004. In 23 games, he had a 2–5 record, a 5.34 earned run average (ERA), 41 strikeouts, and 22 walks in innings pitched. He made three starts that year, the only time he ever started games professionally. The Giants switched single-A affiliates the next year and Wilson began pitching for the Augusta GreenJackets. In 26 games, he had a 5–1 record, a 0.82 ERA, 30 strikeouts, and seven walks in 33 innings pitched while notching 13 saves, good for second in the league behind Brett Campbell's 19. His performance with Augusta caused Mark Camps of the San Francisco Chronicle to mention him in his \\"Minor Report\\" on May 15. He also pitched for the Norwich Navigators of the double-A Eastern League (posting no record, eight saves, a 0.57 ERA, 22 strikeouts, five walks, and innings pitched in 15 games) and the Fresno Grizzlies of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League (posting a 1–1 record, no saves, a 3.97 ERA, 13 strikeouts, eight walks, and innings pitched in nine games). =San Francisco Giants= 2006 season Wilson began 2006 with the Grizzlies before getting called up to the majors on April 23 to replace Tyler Walker, who was designated for assignment after struggling to begin the season. He made his major league debut that day in relief, pitching two innings, surrendering two hits and no runs while striking out three. He later revealed that he hurt himself during his first inning but continued pitching through the second without informing anyone of his injury. Afterward he was placed on the disabled list for a month. On May 23, he returned from the DL. He was optioned to Fresno on June 7 when Tim Worrell was activated from the DL; Giants' manager Felipe Alou said Wilson was not getting enough playing time. Wilson would go on to have three more stints with the Giants in 2006. On July 2, he got his first career save, stranding three inherited runners in the eighth inning and throwing scoreless innings in a 6–2 victory over the San Diego Padres. In 31 games, he had a 2–3 record, a 5.40 ERA, 23 strikeouts, and 21 walks in 30 innings pitched. In 24 games with Fresno, he had a 1–3 record, a 2.89 ERA, 30 strikeouts, and 14 walks in 28 innings pitched. 2007 season Wilson competed for the closer role with Armando Benítez in 2007 spring training. After he struggled and posted a 7.71 ERA, the Giants optioned him to the minors to start the season. After building a 1–2 record, 2.10 ERA, 37 strikeouts, 24 walks, 11 saves, and innings pitched in 31 games with Fresno, Wilson was called up on August 11 when Jonathan Sánchez was demoted. He was initially used as the setup man for closer Brad Hennessey, but he took over as closer on September 11 when Hennessey lost the role due to ineffectiveness. He went on to pitch in 24 games, recording a 1–2 record, a 2.28 ERA, 18 strikeouts, six walks, innings pitched, and six saves. 2008 season Wilson remained the Giants' closer in 2008 and kept the role all season. He recorded 24 consecutive saves from May 3 through August 17, the longest streak by a Giant since Robb Nen had 28 straight in 2000. Wilson was named to the All-Star Game after leading the NL in saves with 25 in the first half of the season. He gave up no hits and struck out one in 2/3 innings in a 4–3 loss to the American League. He continued to lead the league in saves until José Valverde passed him at the end of August. Despite posting a 4.04 ERA through September 6, Wilson converted 37 of 40 save opportunities. In his final seven games of the year, however, he posted a 9.56 ERA while converting just four out of seven opportunities. In 63 games, he had a 3–2 record, a 4.62 ERA, 67 strikeouts, and 28 walks in innings pitched. He converted 41 saves in 47 attempts; his 41 saves were tied with Brad Lidge's total for second in the league behind Valverde's 44. 2009 season On June 5, 2009, Wilson saved Randy Johnson's 300th win. Johnson, searching for his 300th win, gave up one unearned run in six innings in Game 1 of a doubleheader against the Washington Nationals; the Giants had a 2–1 lead in the eighth inning. With runners on first and second for the Nationals and two outs, Wilson was called on to get the save. He walked Ryan Zimmerman to load the bases and bring up Adam Dunn. He then loaded the count against Dunn before throwing a called strike three to end the inning. Wilson then pitched a scoreless ninth, preserving the victory for Johnson. On September 24, with two outs and two strikes in the ninth inning and the Giants leading the Chicago Cubs by a 2–1 score, Wilson gave up a two-run home run to Jeff Baker. The loss hurt the Giants' chances of reaching the playoffs. In 68 games, Wilson had a 5–6 record, a 2.74 ERA, 83 strikeouts, and 27 walks in innings pitched. He blew seven saves, but his 38 saves tied for third in the NL with Ryan Franklin's total behind Heath Bell's 42 and Francisco Cordero's 39. He led the league in saves requiring four outs or more, with eight. 2010 season Brian Wilson, September 2010 In 2010 spring training, Wilson was asked whether or not he thought himself one of baseball's elite closers. In what would turn out to be a very prophetic quote, he replied: On March 25, Wilson agreed to a contract extension with the Giants. He struck out five batters in innings on May 9 while recording a save in a 6–5 victory over the New York Mets. On May 15, against the Houston Astros with the bases loaded, two outs, and the Giants leading 2–1 in the ninth inning, Wilson struck out Kazuo Matsui in a 15-pitch at bat to end the game. The next day, against Houston with runners on first and second, two outs, and the Giants leading 4–3 in the ninth, Wilson retired Matsui to end the game. On June 12, Wilson entered in the eighth inning with one out, the bases loaded, and the Giants leading the Oakland Athletics 5–4. Wilson struck out Adam Rosales and retired Rajai Davis to end the inning; he then pitched a scoreless ninth to earn the save. He recorded 22 saves in his first 24 chances and was named to the All-Star Game in which he threw a scoreless eighth inning in the contest, a 3–1 victory over the AL. On October 3 (the final day of the regular season), the Giants faced the Padres, whom they led by one game in the NL West. Wilson threw a scoreless inning to earn the save and clinch the division for the Giants. Wilson converted his 48th save that day, tying the Giants' single season save record of 48 held by Rod Beck. He finished the season with a 3–3 record, a 1.81 ERA, 93 strikeouts, 26 walks, and inning pitched in 70 games. He converted 48 of 53 save opportunities and led the majors in saves as well as leading the major leagues in saves of four outs or more (10). He was named the This Year in Baseball Closer of the Year after the season. He finished 13th in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. 2010 postseason Wilson made his playoff debut in Game 2 of the NL Division Series against the Atlanta Braves; he blew a save, but that was partly because of an error by Pablo Sandoval. He earned saves in Games 3 and 4 as the Giants defeated the Braves in four games. In the NL Championship Series, the Giants faced the Philadelphia Phillies. In Game 4, Wilson threw a scoreless inning and earned the win in the 6–5 victory. In Game 6, Wilson entered with one out in the eighth inning, runners on first and second, and the Giants leading 3–2. He got Carlos Ruiz to line into a double play. He then pitched the ninth inning, striking out Ryan Howard with two runners on base, clinching the series for the Giants. He joined Dennis Eckersley, Mitch Williams, and John Wetteland as the only pitchers since 1969 to win or save four games in a postseason series. (In 2014 Greg Holland of Kansas City matched this feat.) The Giants faced the Texas Rangers in the World Series. Wilson appeared in three games, allowing no runs. He recorded the save in the series-clinching Game 5 as the Giants won their first World Series since 1954. 2011 season Wilson strained an oblique muscle in 2011 spring training and opened the season on the DL. He was activated from the DL on April 6. After posting a 3.75 ERA in his first two games, Wilson posted a 1.26 ERA in his next 35 outings. During a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Wilson blew a save for a second straight game and was taken out of the game by Bruce Bochy. Upon entering the dugout, Wilson took out his frustrations by throwing a Gatorade cooler and smashing it with a bat. The Giants still won the game 4–3 as Jeremy Affeldt got the save. Wilson was elected to his third All-Star Game; he earned the save in a 5–1 victory over the AL. Brian Wilson in September 2011 Wilson was placed on the DL on August 21 due to inflammation in his right elbow. At the time of his injury, he was third in the NL in saves, behind Craig Kimbrel and John Axford. On September 18, the Giants reactivated him from the DL. After two games back, Bochy decided to shut down Wilson for the final two games of the season. In 57 games, he had a 6–4 record, a 3.11 ERA, 54 strikeouts, and 31 walks in 55 innings pitched. He converted 36 of his 41 save opportunities, which tied Juan Carlos Oviedo for eighth in the NL. 2012 season Wilson's 2012 season would be short-lived. With the Giants leading the Colorado Rockies 4–1 entering the bottom of the ninth inning on April 12, he made his second appearance of the season to get the save for the Giants. He walked in a run to make it 4–2, but retired Marco Scutaro with the bases loaded to earn the save. He injured his elbow during the game and underwent Tommy John surgery for the second time in his career on April 19, causing him to miss the remainder of the season. During his injury shortened season, Wilson made only 2 appearances with an ERA of 9.00 and 1 save. The Giants went on to win their second World Series in three years. Wilson expressed confidence in an interview on April 15 that he would return to the Giants in 2013. However, because he was coming off an injury and would be owed at least $6.8 million for 2013, he was non- tendered after the season, which made him a free agent for the first time in his career. As of the end of the 2012 season, he ranked third all-time in saves as a Giant with 171, behind only Robb Nen (206) and Rod Beck (199). =2012–2013 free agency= Wilson chose not to sign with any team before the 2013 season because he wanted to be 100% recovered from surgery when he attempted his comeback.Free agent Wilson not expected to sign until after season starts On July 25, he threw a bullpen session in front of various teams' scouts with the hope to sign with a contender.Brian Wilson throws for scouts: \\"He looked good\\" =Los Angeles Dodgers= Los Angeles Dodgers in 2014 On July 30, 2013, Wilson agreed to a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the remainder of the 2013 season.Former Giants closer Brian Wilson reaches deal with the Dodgers After a few weeks at the Dodgers training facility in Arizona, he began a minor league rehab assignment.Dodgers' Brian Wilson to begin rehab assignment on Wednesday He joined the Dodgers active roster on August 19 and made his debut with the team on August 22 against the Miami Marlins at Marlins Park. He appeared in 18 games for the Dodgers with a 2-1 record and a 0.66 ERA. Regardless of signing for the team late in the season, Wilson made 3 relief appearances in the postseason without giving up an earned run until the Dodgers lost in the 2013 NLCS to the St. Louis Cardinals. On December 5, 2013, Wilson agreed to a one-year, $10 million contract to return to the Dodgers. The deal also contained a player option for the 2015 season. His numbers were not as good in 2014, as he had a 4.66 ERA in 61 appearances. On October 8, 2014, he announced that he would be exercising his player option for 2015. However, the Dodgers designated him for assignment on December 16, 2014. He was released by the Dodgers on December 19 and became a free agent. Wilson did not play in the MLB in 2015 or 2016, but announced in early 2017 that he would be attempting a comeback as a knuckleball pitcher. Scouting report Wilson was a power pitcher. He has a repertoire of four pitches. He throws a straight four-seam fastball around 92-95 mph; this is one of his main pitches. He also has a slider, a cut fastball, and a two-seam fastball. His slider traveled around 89 mph. His cut fastball has allowed him to use fewer four-seam fastballs. In 2011, he started throwing the two-seam fastball as well. The two-seamer starts away on a right-handed hitter (or in to a left-handed hitter) and has dramatic inward (or outward) movement over the plate. He has also experimented with curveballs, screwballs, and knuckleballs. Wilson has said that when pitching, players cannot be worried about the potential outcome. Personality Wilson is noted for his flamboyant personality.Nightengale, Bob. Giants' closer Brian Wilson not as crazy as he looks, acts, USA Today, October 18, 2010. Retrieved 2010-10-21. In the 2010 MLB All-Star Game, Wilson debuted a pair of bright orange cleats and continued to wear them throughout the season. On July 27, Marlins' manager Edwin Rodríguez complained that the shoes were too bright. Wilson received a $1,000 fine from MLB the next day, and he responded by coloring half of the shoes black with a marker. He said afterwards, \\"The fact that he (Rodríguez) thinks these shoes throw 97–100 with cut might be a little far-fetched. I guess we should probably have these checked for performance-enhancing cleats.\\" He also stated that he was punished \\"for having too much awesome on my feet.\\"Baggarly, p. 117 In addition to his mohawk hairstyle, Wilson has a large black beard, which he began growing and presumably dyeing during the Giants' playoff run in 2010. He never admitted to dyeing it, saying in 2010, \\"It's dark because we play a lot of day games. It's tanned. It's focused.\\"Rubin, Gideon. Brian Wilson's beard has mystique all its own, ESPN. Retrieved 2010-10-21. He decided he would not shave until the Giants' season was over, and only if they failed to win the World Series. During the Giants' playoff run in 2010, Giants' fans began growing their own beards or wearing fake beards. Many fans chanted \\"Fear the Beard\\", and held up signs bearing the same motto. Teammate Sergio Romo also began growing a beard in 2010; he has had it intermittently ever since. Wilson has a number of tattoos. On his left shoulder, he has a dragon to honor his father, which represents the \\"protection from fear\\" that Wilson's dad gave him. Across his chest, he has the words \\"In nomine patris\\" (\\"In the name of the father\\"), and on his right wrist he has a Celtic cross with lettering that says \\"All Honor To Him\\" in Gaelic; both of these tattoos symbolize his Christian faith. Finally, he has Japanese Kanji characters on his arm, which symbolize his faith; they say, \\"Father. Son. Eternal Strength.\\" Wilson has enjoyed a great deal of media attention during his career. He once had a locally produced, self-filmed reality show called Life of Brian. He has often been on The Cheap Seats. Following the World Series in 2010, a photo of Wilson celebrating with teammate Buster Posey appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated. Wilson also appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Lopez Tonight. He has frequently starred in commercials. Wilson became a Christian at the age of 23. He has adopted a gesture of crossing his arms, with his left hand in his glove and his right hand underneath pointing with the index finger while looking at the sky, which both honors The Holy Trinity as well as his late father who died of cancer when Wilson was 17. He performs it when he records a save or closes out a game. On May 30, 2011 (Memorial Day), Wilson announced that in memory of his father, an Air Force veteran, he would endow two scholarships for LSU Air Force ROTC cadets. The scholarship will be a need based scholarship available to any college junior or senior. Later that year, on July 7, Wilson gave away 1,000 baseball gloves to members of the Giants Community Fund's Junior Giants baseball program. Frequently, Wilson has made references to \\"The Machine\\", a character from the movie 8mm. In an episode of The Cheap Seats, he had someone dressed as \\"The Machine\\" walk past in the background in full BDSM leather fetish apparel, supposedly unknown to him (but almost certainly teammate Pat Burrell).Brian Wilson – Cheap Seats Interview – \\"The Machine\\" Revealed – YouTube Another time, in an interview with Rome, Wilson appeared to receive a call from \\"The Machine\\" and pulled a leather mask (allegedly \\"The Machine's\\") out of his pocket to show to Rome.Baggarly, pp. 116–118 See also * List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders * List of San Francisco Giants team records References Further reading * External links * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:People from Winchester, Massachusetts Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:National League All-Stars Category:National League saves champions Category:Baseball players from Massachusetts Category:Baseball players from New Hampshire Category:People from Londonderry, New Hampshire Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:Los Angeles Dodgers players Category:LSU Tigers baseball players Category:Hyannis Harbor Hawks players Category:Hagerstown Suns players Category:Mesa Solar Sox players Category:Augusta GreenJackets players Category:Norwich Navigators players Category:Fresno Grizzlies players Category:San Jose Giants players Category:Rancho Cucamonga Quakes players Category:Albuquerque Isotopes players ","title":"Brian Wilson (baseball)"},{"id":"4870845","text":"The Chair of Natural Philosophy is a professorship at the University of Glasgow, in Scotland, which was established in 1727 The Nova Erectio of King James VI of Scotland shared the teaching of moral philosophy, logic and natural philosophy among the regents.

Sergius VII (died 30 October 1137) was the thirty-ninth and last duke (or magister militum) of Naples. He succeeded his father John VI on the Neapolitan throne in 1122 at a time when Roger II of Sicily was rising rapidly in power. When Roger succeeded as duke of Apulia in 1127 and was crowned king in 1130, the fate of Naples hinged on Sergius' relations with the Sicilian court. In 1131, Roger demanded from the citizens of Amalfi the defences of their city and the keys to their castle. When the citizens refused, Sergius initially prepared to aid them with a fleet, but the Admiral George of Antioch blockaded the port city with a larger fleet and Sergius submitted to Roger. According to the chronicler Alexander of Telese, Naples \\"which, since Roman times, had hardly ever been conquered by the sword now submitted to Roger on the strength of a mere report.\\" Sergius' prestige was not high and all of southern Italy was now in Roger's hands. In 1134, Sergius supported the rebellion of Robert II of Capua and Ranulf II of Alife, but avoided any direct confrontation with Roger. After the fall of Capua, he did homage to the king. But the next year, on 24 April 1135, a Pisan fleet under the exiled Robert of Capua laid anchor in Naples. Carrying 8,000 reinforcements, the fleet increased rebel morale and soon a full-scale revolt had recommenced. Sergius had to welcome Ranulf, who was in the same position as he: in revolt against the king to whom he had so recently sworn fealty. The rebel leaders--Robert, Ranulf, and Sergius--were besieged in Naples until Spring 1136. By then, many people were dying of starvation. Yet according to the historian and rebel sympathiser Falco of Benevento, Sergius and the Neapolitans did not relent, \\"preferring to die of hunger than to bare their necks to the power of an evil King.\\" The naval blockade of Naples, however, had holes and Sergius was able to slip by to Pisa for more supplies and on another occasion Robert did the same. A relief army, commanded by none other than the Emperor Lothair II himself, however, was coming to Naples' rescue and Roger lifted the siege. Lothair left quickly after conquering nearly the whole of the Mezzogiorno, and so Roger was able to retake his lost possessions. Sergius again kneeled before him in homage, trying to spare his city another siege. Sergius was forgiven and accompanied Roger on an expedition against his erstwhile ally Ranulf, now duke of Apulia. On October 30, at the Battle of Rignano, he and Roger II, as well as Roger's son, were defeated, Sergius himself dying on the field. Ironically enough, Roger's defeat in Rignano opened the field to his conquest of Naples itself, since Sergius VII died heirless and Naples' nobility couldn't reach an agreement as to who would succeed as duke. Roger finally absorbed the Duchy of Naples into his new kingdom in 1139, when the pope, Innocent II, and the Neapolitan nobility acknowledged the young Alfonso of Hauteville as duke.

It is located alongside the Once de Septiembre Station of the Ferrocarril Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (Sarmiento railroad) in the heart of the Balvanera neighborhood.  History  The square lies on the former site of a mansion known as the Quinta de Miserere. Around 1814, it was known as Mataderos de Miserere (Slaughterhouses of Miserere), Hueco de los corrales (Hole of the corrals) in 1817, and Mercado del Oeste (Western Market) by 1850. It was also known as Mercado (or Plaza) 11 de septiembre (11 September Market or plaza); the name Plaza Miserere dates from 1947. The plaza was the site of skirmishes during the British invasions of 1806. It was the site of the defeat of the troops under Santiago de Liniers during the second invasion of 1807. The market functioned until 1882, when Mayor Torcuato de Alvear began the demarkation of the plaza. In 1882 it was used as the site for the South American Continental Exhibition. The neighboring Once Terminal was inaugurated in 1898. The square underwent an important remodel in 1913, when a Line A station for the Buenos Aires Metro was built underneath. This station was officially named after the square above it, but like the square itself became more popularly known as Plaza Once. The square's current design is from 1923. The mausoleum of Bernardino Rivadavia, the first Constitutional President of Argentina, was created by sculptor Rogelio Yrurtia and added in 1932, where his ashes remain despite his wish that they not stay in Argentina.

Pathology It causes a disease known as equine coital exanthema. The disease is spread through direct and sexual contact and possibly through flies carrying infected vaginal discharge. EHV-3 has an incubation period of as little as two days. Signs of the disease include pustules and ulcerations of the vagina, penis, prepuce, and perineum. Lesions may also be seen on the lips and teats. Usually the only symptom seen is a decreased libido in stallions. The lesions heal within two weeks. As with other herpes viruses, the virus remains latent in the host for life. Carrier animals can sometimes be identified by spots of pigment loss on black skin in the genital region. EHV-3 is best prevented by taking note of present clinical signs and keeping infected horses isolated and breeding stock from sexual contact with other horses. Antibiotic ointments should be used on the lesions to prevent secondary bacterial infections and hasten the healing process. It is also important to use disposable gloves and instruments in veterinary exams as the virus can be spread by using contaminated equipment.

BATAY OUVRIYE is an organization that regroups factory unions and committees, workers’ associations and militants, all struggling in Haiti for the construction of an independent, combative and democratic union movement, and to organize wage-workers, self-employed workers as well as the unemployed for the defense of their rights. The organization is an alternative to the traditional bureaucratic, corrupt union movement that upholds the dominant classes’ power amongst the exploited masses of Haiti. Not only do we take the initiative of developing spontaneous direct issue struggles, but also we incite the working class to fight and to organize themselves to defend their independent interests. Batay Ouvriye also links these particular struggles with those, more wide-ranging, of the people. In this sense, we take part in all types of popular democratic struggles by encouraging the involvement of workers. Batay Ouvriye entered the struggle against the Disney company and other large multinationals exploiting the workers of the earth. In this struggle, we were able to find the collaboration of various solidarity organizations throughout the world interested in workers’ struggles in general and those of the Haitian workers in particular. Batay Ouvriye representatives participate in various forums organized in protest against the violations and abuses endured by workers all over the world. Lately, we participated, for example,: \\\\- in the hemispheric organization of the garment workers of the export free trade zones in the Dominican Republic; \\\\- in debates around organizational strategy in free trade zone countries of Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean; \\\\- in Guatemala, on the gender question in the organizational effort in international subcontracting zones; \\\\- in Belgium, in the Peoples Court reporting against various companies multinational such Adidas, Disney, Levi Strauss, C&A; and H&M; \\\\- in the U.S.A., in the conference on «Independent Monitoring» accusing Disney, Nike, Walmart, Keymart,; \\\\- and in several informational tours in the struggle against Disney. For we are aware that in the present context of world capitalist development, Haitian worker struggles cannot be detached from those of all the other workers being led in other countries. We have brought and continue to bring our militant support to all the fights in defense of labor and peoples' democratic rights. In Haiti, Batay Ouvriye encourages the diffusion of information and workers’ training through conferences and debates, seminars or labor training workshops, by preparing and distributing didactic material on workers’ rights, international labor conventions and appropriate struggle strategies in order to thwart local or foreign bosses. Our interventions touch upon: 1) The non-respect of workers’ union rights, notably the right to unionize and the right to collective negotiation; 2) The need to increase the minimum daily wage, while insisting on the right of the workers to have a salary that takes into account the cost of life and the continuous devaluation of the gourd, our national currency; 3) The need for a progressive decrease until total elimination of production quotas in assembly factories; 4) Improvement of work conditions and respect for workers’ persons; 5) Impunity in the work arena: bosses have the Ministry of the Social Affaires or the Work Tribunal’s complicity in hindering workers legal rights; 6) Sexual harassment; 7) Generalized despotism in the work arena; 8) Lay-offs, illegal suspensions and all shapes of arbitrary of which workers are the victims; 9) Workers awareness on the need for a new Labor Code and the absence of a social security plan in Haiti, as well as the dubious practices of State institutions such as the old age office (ONA); 10) Necessary reforms within the Social Affairs Ministry but also our support to the civil servants in their struggle against the application of the structural adjustment program imposed by international financial institutions to our country; 11) Police repression and that carried out by elected local officials such the C.a.s.e.c. (Village Administration Councils) as well as certain employees of the Labor Ministry against peasant organization members; 12) Economic or political measures that don't allow for a real and sustained development of our natural and human resources; 13) The need for of another type of state capable of putting workers’ and popular masses’ interests foremost. Batay Ouvriye intervenes on all these points by distributing fliers, booklets and bulletins, organizing press conferences, sending press releases, distributing or pasting posters in the industrial zones and districts where workers reside. Also, we hold pickets at factories entries, in front of the Ministry of the Social Affaires to force them to hear our demands concerning the numerous problems we face. We wage a continuous struggle for a real change in our life and work conditions, as workers of Port-au-Prince, the high Artibonite, the low Central Plateau and the North, as well as specific struggles throughout the entire country around problems emerging from our daily lives. This, also, through campaigns: for day laborers wage hikes in the agricultural sector; their right to organize; the decrease of the production quotas in the textile factories; the respect of the rights of workers who have home responsibilities... Thanks to these practices and despite the difficulties resulting from the effect of high interests at stake in the Haitian social formation, we have been able to establish many unions and committees within factories, hotels, stores or small workshops, as well as associations of small craftsmen and teachers in urban zones and farmer and agricultural workers organizations in rural areas. This work of organization also gives us the opportunity to address the young, sons and girls of workers with whom we are in touch. We are engaged in the construction of a youth movement determined by the development of their struggles to satisfy their demands. At the same time, we address their parents and teachers. This has allowed us to build a coalition between workers’ organizations, pupils organizations and teachers’ organizations addressing the questions of education and teaching from the viewpoint of the working class and workers in general. Our work with youth is centered on three major axes: their concrete struggles, development of skills and instructive leisure. In the framework of some of these activities, these workers’ sons and daughters are learning the first notions of data processing and electricity, kitchen and pastry...This development walks hand in hand with the setting up of a library including school books and references and the publication of a youngsters newspaper, amongst others. . Batay Ouvriye, consequently, articulates workplace struggles with those generally concerning the changes necessary in workers’ daily lives, against the various shapes of oppression that stake out their existence.

Some countries, such as France, the United Kingdom and Australia, go further in their warnings (plain packaging) A pack or packet of cigarettes (also informally called fag packet in British slang; as in the idiom \\"back of a fag packet\\" or \\"fag-packet calculation\\") is a rectangular container, mostly of paperboard, which contains cigarettes. The pack is designed with a flavor-protective foil, paper or plastic, and sealed through a transparent airtight plastic film. By pulling the \\"pull-tabs\\", the pack is opened. Hard packs can be closed again after opening, whereas soft packs cannot. Cigarette packs often contain warning messages depending on which country they are sold in. In the European Union, most tobacco warnings are standardised (although the United Kingdom now has plain tobacco packaging). Package size Marlboro cigarettes (Munich, Germany, 2006) =Pack= The size of a pack is often regulated. Government agencies usually set a minimum pack size. In Australia, the most common quantity per pack is 25, but some brands have 26 or 20 (the legal minimum), with 30, 40 and even 50 packs also sold. In Canada, most packs sold have 25 cigarettes, but packs of 20 are also popular. In many European countries, increases of cigarette tax can cause the quantity of cigarettes in the pack to change to achieve the same end price. In Malaysia, the sale of packs containing fewer than 20 cigarettes is prohibited. In the United States, the quantity of cigarettes in a pack must be at least 20, with certain brands, such as Export As, coming in packs of 25. In the United Kingdom, brands are sold only in packs of 20; in May 2017, new laws restricting loose tobacco sales to multiples of 30g or 50g also outlawed the sale of 10-stick packs and branded packaging, introducing boxes which are a plain green color. The new packaging has the brand name in a basic typeface, with most of the packet dedicated to textual and photographic health warnings. While older vending machines sometimes dispense packets containing 16 or 18 cigarettes, the dimensions of the packaging are the same as the equivalent packet that contains 20. =Carton= A carton of cigarettes usually contains 10 packs, totaling 200 cigarettes. Some cartons contain twenty packs, totaling 400 cigarettes.  Hard pack and soft pack  A hard pack is the usual style of paperboard packaging for store bought cigarettes, which consists of a relatively stable box. The flip-top hard pack cigarette case was introduced in 1955 by Philip Morris. This successfully prevents the crumpling of cigarettes when kept in a pocket or handbag. The hard pack is designed to make the smoker look at the brand name and logo on the top of the pack every time on opening, keeping the brand fresh in the consumer's mind and potentially increasing brand loyalty. A soft pack is a box packaging made of thin paper, usually containing 20 cigarettes. Soft packs may be considered inconvenient as they rupture easily and cannot be resealed. They offer the immediate convenience of not having to open the package each time the smoker wants a cigarette. They require less physical 'pocket space' when fewer cigarettes remain in the pack. With American brands, cigarettes from a soft pack are usually a few millimeters longer than their hard-boxed counterparts. Collecting Cigarette packs are popular items among collectors. They are fine examples of industrial design and a good source for studies of social, cultural and marketing history. Collectors usually base their collections on various criteria like cigarette brand, country of producer, time period, warning message, etc. Also, it's important for collectors whether the packages empty or full. Empty packs are more common and cheaper than full ones. Full packs are considered to be rare and expect to pay more for them, especially for packs in original cellophane wrapping. =Collectible pack= 173x173px To encourage cigarette pack collectors, some cigarette packs were made to present a particular interest for collectors. There are cigarette packs labeled \\"collectible\\". Some brands introduce promotional packs to bypass advertising laws. An example would be a limited time promotion where the pack is made from tin with the shape, purpose, and look of a cigarette case to entice potential buyers. They are distinguished by unique décor or are very old or they were removed from manufacturing for some reasons and consequently became rare. = Cigarette brands from 1920-1930 = Wild Woodbine cigarette pack. The most popular cigarette brands of this period were Player's Navy Cut, Woodbine, Capstan, Craven 'A', and Black Cat. Woodbines were cheap cigarettes aimed at working-class people while Craven 'A' was one of the earliest filter brands initially targeted at women. = Cigarette brands from 1940s = The top- selling cigarette brands of the decade were Lucky Strike, Camel, Chesterfield, and Old Gold. That was the time of growth for the whole tobacco industry: again cigarettes were included in the soldier rations during World War II. = Cigarette brands from 1950s = The top-selling cigarette brands of the decade were the same as in the previous one except that the no.1 was Camel. The other brands were Balto, Brunette, Encore, Gitanes, and Kent. Cigarettes were widely advertised on TV. Features Most cigarette packs have no features at all and are just made up of a single container filled with cigarettes. However, some cigarette packs have been proposed that also contain an empty container for disposing the cigarette butts into. This could reduce cigarette butts of being discarded into the street, where they contaminate the environment.Patent for a cigarette packs with container for cigarette butts  Plain tobacco packaging  Plain cigarette packaging, as required in Australia since 2012: the pack has an olive drab colour, with the brand name printed in a standard font and size – no logo, other colour or branding allowed. Tobacco packaging drives brand image to attract new consumers to their tobacco products and creates brand loyalty. To give stylish impact to tobacco packaging companies use different techniques like gold and silver foiling, embossing, perforating, debussing, raised ink printing, digital printing, and screen printing. In general, tobacco packaging plays a major role in advertising and promotion of Tobacco marketing. Recent introduction of Plain packaging contributes to improving public health because young people told that plain packaging reduces the positive image of smoking and the possibility of stimulus related to the package design. The introduction of plain packages was considered as the end of cigarette pack collecting by some collectors as it made the packs unattractive. The other collectors adapted to the new reality and included variations of warning messages as one of the criteria for basing their collections on.

Biography  =Early years= The first incarnation of the group was formed around 1989 in Amityville, Long Island, New York, although the family grew up in Wyandanch, Long Island. The family of four brothers (Anthony, Richard, Joel, and Edward) and one sister (Dawne), of which Poetic (Anthony) was the eldest, were born to Trinidadian parents who moved from Trinidad and Tobago in 1971, making their first residence in Queens, New York for a short time, then moving to Wyandanch. John Berkeley (a pastor and a local businessman) and Ela Berkeley (a homemaker, cook-nutritionist, and teacher) were both singers and artistic in general, and they encouraged artistic expression in their five children. The family was well-rounded musically, singing gospel and R&B; up to their early teens all around New York, other states, and Canada as \\"The Berkeley Singers\\". Anthony (Poetic), Dawne, and Joel (Brainstorm) sang, accompanied by Richard on the drums and Eddie (E-Sharp) on the piano or keyboard. Poetic began rhyming in his early teens in Wyandanch, and was known by many names, the first of which was MC Supa Flea of the Wyandanch Crew The Phantom Squad, rolling with many other local crews of the era and building a name for himself as a lyrical battle MC. He changed his name to Poetic around 1985, and in 1986 he formed the crew known as Too Poetic, who in 1988-89 released a modestly popular single called: “God Made Me Funky/Poetical Terror”, under the DNA/Tommy Boy Music imprint. The group was composed of his two DJs and childhood friends - DJ Capital K (Fred Cox) and DJ Woody Wood (Randy Woods) – Too Poetic alluded to “Two DJs and One Poet”. The radio personality called DNA had been his manager and the host of the Hank Love & DNA Radio Show on 105.9FM WNWK of hip-hop underground radio fame. The group's relationship with Tommy Boy Records eventually panned out for various reasons, scrapping the album and making Poetic very displeased, an early casualty of the politics of the music business. Many artists who are not marketed properly have this attitude with their former labels. While Poetic was just beginning his formal hip hop career in 1987–89, Brainstorm was attending college at the State University of New York at Farmingdale, Long Island, where he was the roommate of Brooklyn's own Super DJ Richie Rich (who had been in Third Base, Clark Kent's Supermen, and the movie Juice). The college-based MC-DJ party collective called The Group Home Posse was loosely formed with Brainstorm and DJ Richie Rich to include his childhood friend The DJ-Rapper J.A.T. (Thomas Allen James), DJ Nike, Diamond Jay AKA “Americas Favorite DJ” (EPMD, Gravediggaz, Beyoncé Knowles), and Diamond Shell (Biz Markie’s brother) – all of whom attended Farmingdale University between 1987 and 1989. The university was host to many hip hop artists as visitors for parties and to do shows like Rakim, EPMD, Producer- Super DJ Clark Kent, and Biz Markie. After Brainstorm finished his college run in 1989, he took time to learn many aspects of the music business and attempted to record a solo demo with Marcy Projects’ Rapper-Producer The JAZ (Big Jaz, mentor of Jay-Z), and was found in many rap circles with Long Island's KMD and other “conscious” MCs of the time, but in 1989 he and Poetic mutually decided to pair up with a hardcore lyrical edge, original word play, and acute metaphors, after many collaborations between them since 1985. Thus, Da Bruthas G.R.Y.M. was born shortly after Too Poetic's deal with DNA/Tommy Boy had soured. The energy and high chemistry between these true by-blood brothers at the time was, simply put, natural. =The 1989–92 years= In the first Bruthas G.R.Y.M. era (c. 1989–1992), the brothers Poetic (Brother One) and Brainstorm (Brother Two) garnered much respect on the underground hip hop scene of New York – whose “dubs” from underground radio shows were boasting lyrics beyond what was known at the time. Their first official demo featured the underground bangers “Bruthas G.R.Y.M.”, “Circle-Circle-Dot-Dot”, the politically charged “Popcorn” and “Livin’ In Hell (Had To Survive)”, the name- calling “Turtle Soup”, and a neighborhood favorite, the battle rhymes of “GRYMnastics”. The demo featured production mastering by Nate \\"NATO\\" Tinsley, their in-house producer Semi-Automatic (Pedro Sims, Mr. Semi, Gravediggaz), and the brothers themselves. After blazing underground radio and live shows around New York City with their lyrics and knowledge of self-based content, they were listed in The Source magazine as the best unsigned rap group of 1989. The crew was then managed by longtime friend Jack Pope (Jack Sprat, Starving Artists Entertainment), who later became the road manager of the Gravediggaz. They acquired many long-term relationships from Poetic's various musical ties, as well as with Amityville locals like DJ-Cut Monitor Milo of Leaders of the New School (“The Case of the PTA”), Posdonous of De La Soul, and Doo Doo Man Records’ Crew (Prince Paul's Def Jam Imprint) Resident Aliens. These cassette tape “dubs” floated around the New York streets in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and their demo eventually made their way to the seasoned musical ear of fellow Amityvillain Prince Paul (Stetsasonic, De La Soul, Gravediggaz) from his association with the local Long Island artists who had met the brothers and saw their raw talent. He was hooked on the brother's metaphoric flare—all living in Amityville, Long Island, at the time. In 1990 Prince Paul decided to fund and executive produce further demos, finding various other known and up-and-coming producers for the unnamed project, as well as being the tentative DJ for the group, after which they were very close to closing a deal reaching seven figures within a year's time, with bidding by well-known record companies propositioning for their lyrical artistry. Then the unfortunate happened – being disenfranchised by the politics and games of the music business and life in general, Brainstorm just quit altogether for “personal enlightenment”, before any formal deal could solidify. According to him, “it was not about the money, it was about my personal growth and spiritual maturity”. Poetic understood about Brainstorm's personal path at that stage in his life, but was silently devastated because they were so close to sealing a major record deal that would have propelled them further into Hip Hop history. Prince Paul was even more puzzled, not fully realizing the reasoning of Brainstorm's sudden move – but he was still optimistic that a future project would be possible. Their original demo, even today, is still one of Prince Paul's favorites. It was not until 1992 that Poetic, after Brainstorm quit pursuing a Hip Hop Career in 1991, that it is said that Poetic “fell on hard times”, including a short period of homelessness. Brainstorm would continue to write for leisure and therapeutic reasoning, but never to seriously pursue a music career, moving to Brooklyn New York and later down south to various states; in fact, Brainstorm was so “finished with Hip Hop” that he gave Poetic all of his original rhyme books to use at his own discretion – some lyrics ending up on Gravediggaz projects. = Work with the Gravediggaz = Poetic, under the guidance of Prince Paul, later transformed into the distinguished G.R.Y.M. or Grym Reaper in the most well-known Horrorcore Super Group Gravediggaz. Prince Paul (“The Undertaker”), The RZA (Prince Rakeem, Wu Tang Clan's Abbot, “The RZArecta”), Frukwan (Stetsasonic, “The Gatekeeper”, Sunstar) along with Poetic (“The G.R.Y.M. Reaper”, Tony Titanium), all X-Tommy Boy Artists, recorded their demo between 1992–93 and got their deal with Gee Street/Island Records in 1994 – releasing their first classic single “Diary of a Mad Man” featuring Killah Priest and Shabazz the Disciple of the rap group Sunz of Man (Wu Tang Camp). Their first single, which made them an instant fixture on the rap scene, was said to be a parody of the group's trial for the murder of “Tommy's Boy”, a broader symbolism for all the record labels who rejected them, or counted their early careers as dead. Brainstorm was still present for many of the recordings and mastering of the album Six Feet Deep at Fire House Studios, although he had moved out of Brooklyn down to New Orleans, Louisiana and Columbus, Georgia in 1992, then to Birmingham, Alabama 1994. They were still recording songs here and there as Bruthas Grym and as you can well note, Poetic left the original form of the name-acronym G.R.Y.M. to mean “Ghetto Repaired Young Mind” to refer back to Da Bruthas G.R.Y.M. – so it is clear that the seed of his unorthodox style started with the original Bruthas Grym recordings. Poetic, still optimistic despite the turn of events, waited patiently to reunite with Brainstorm to spark the old-school Golden-Age of Hip Hop Flavor that made him hone his original following. Almost viewing the Gravediggaz group-project as a vehicle to do just that. Bruthas Grym was no so-called “horrorcore” group, they were graphic story-tellers as there moniker suggests, and their purpose was always cultural awareness. The Gravediggaz’ album Six Feet Deep (also known as Niggamortis),was Certified Gold and received rave reviews for their original and much misunderstood “horrorcore” angle, spawning countless groups and admirers of the genre in the mid to late 90s. some of which will still acknowledge the impact of the Gravediggaz first album. Gravediggaz did not originate the term “horrorcore”; however, they did become one of the most successful of the genre. Some well known early horrorcore groups were: Russell Simmons’ nephew Redrum’s (Jamel Simmons) group The Flatlinerz, also featuring Omen [OMN 999], a later inductee into Gravediggaz camp, under Poetic's Sharpshooters Regime on his label Plasma Records. =Reformation of The Bruthas Grym= The second incarnation of Bruthas Grym was after the first Gravediggaz album when Poetic reached out again to Brainstorm to get back into music through his Sharpshooters Regime and his label Plasma Records in 1996 where he recorded the hard-edged song “Bayaa!” produced by Poetic, and other notable jams with various MCs in the Sharpshooters Regime and Ancient Entities. Brainstorm had been living between Alabama and Georgia at the time, forming a short-lived group of three MCs called Ptahetic Poets (pronounced “path-etic”) with two MCs: Mind Bender AKA Reign Supreme and Sound Wave. The Sharpshooters’ compilation was being created by a whole regime of artist- soldiers for the project, Poetic was dubbed “General G.R.Y.M.” and the self- titled “The Horrorcore Father”. Among them were their brother E-Sharp (Eddie “Goalfingaz”), Flatlinerz-Gravediggaz Omen (now known as OMN 999), Sun of Man's Shabazz The Disciple, Shaqueen (Ma Barker), Amaze, Malik, Smuggler, Rhyme Valor, singer-songwriter Bell Muhammad, and others. Brainstorm and their cousin Prince (Self X-Planatory) crafted all of the skits of the groundbreaking album that was consequently never released. It was then that Poetic and Brainstorm recorded a few songs under the Bruthas G.R.Y.M. name again—most notably, “Buildin; In The Buildin'” produced by their brother E-Sharp. The youngest of the brothers, known as E-Sharp then, although not a part of the original Brothers G.R.Y.M. crew, had been working closely alongside Poetic on the first Gravediggaz LP and more closely on their second LP “The Pick, The Sickle, And The Shovel”, as well as the Sharpshooters-Plasma Records compilation along with another cousin and sound engineer Big Winst. E-Sharp and Big Winst (Gravediggaz) had both attended Five Towns College together to pursue careers as audio engineering and production. After graduation, E-Sharp quickly became a Top-Ten R&B; Producer under the name “Goalfingaz” with Kay Gee's (Naughty By Nature) Divine Mills Label, gaining production credits and crafting such notable R&B; hits like: the Divine Mills’ group Next's “Wifey”, Divine Mills’ crooner Jaheim’s “Just In Case” and “Fabulous”, Ideal's “Whatever”, Faith Evans’ “Good Life”, the late Gerald Lavert's “Made To Love You”, and various other gold and platinum hits, working with many Hip Hop and R&B; groups and soloists since the mid 90s. He is currently working with Reign Supreme, American Idol's Brittenum Twins, and 112’s Slim and Q. By far, he is the most musical of the brothers. = Death of Poetic and hopeful reactivation of the project = Death: In April 1999: \\"Grym Reaper\\" was diagnosed with a deadly colon cancer, and was given only three months to live. On Sunday, July 15, 2001, Anthony “Grym Reaper” Berkeley died, almost two years longer than the time he was given by the doctors.

Boundary layers can be either laminar or turbulent. A reasonable assessment of whether the boundary layer will be laminar or turbulent can be made by calculating the Reynolds number of the local flow conditions. Flow separation or boundary layer separation is the detachment of a boundary layer from a surface into a wake.White (2010), \\"Fluid Mechanics\\", Section 7.1 (7th edition) Separation occurs in flow that is slowing down, with pressure increasing, after passing the thickest part of a streamline body or passing through a widening passage, for example. Flowing against an increasing pressure is known as flowing in an adverse pressure gradient. The boundary layer separates when it has travelled far enough in an adverse pressure gradient that the speed of the boundary layer relative to the surface has stopped and reversed direction.Anderson, John D. (2004), Introduction to Flight, Section 4.20 (5th edition)L. J. Clancy (1975) Aerodynamics, Section 4.14 The flow becomes detached from the surface, and instead takes the forms of eddies and vortices. The fluid exerts a constant pressure on the surface once it has separated instead of a continually increasing pressure if still attached.Fundamentals of Aerodynamics 5th edition, John D. Anderson,Jr. 2011, , Figure 4.46 In aerodynamics, flow separation results in reduced lift and increased pressure drag, caused by the pressure differential between the front and rear surfaces of the object. It causes buffeting of aircraft structures and control surfaces. In internal passages separation causes stalling and vibrations in machinery blading and increased losses(lower efficiency) in inlets and compressors. Much effort and research has gone into the design of aerodynamic and hydrodynamic surface contours and added features which delay flow separation and keep the flow attached for as long as possible. Examples include the fur on a tennis ball, dimples on a golf ball, turbulators on a glider, which induce an early transition to turbulent flow; vortex generators on aircraft. Adverse pressure gradient Graphical representation of the velocity profile in the boundary layer. The last profile represents reverse flow which shows separated flow. The flow reversal is primarily caused by adverse pressure gradient imposed on the boundary layer by the outer potential flow. The streamwise momentum equation inside the boundary layer is approximately stated as :u {\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial s} = -{1 \\\\over \\\\rho}{dp \\\\over ds} + { u} {\\\\partial^2 u \\\\over \\\\partial y^2} where s,y are streamwise and normal coordinates. An adverse pressure gradient is when dp/ds > 0, which then can be seen to cause the velocity u to decrease along s and possibly go to zero if the adverse pressure gradient is strong enough.Balmer, David (2003) Separation of Boundary Layers, from School of Engineering and Electronics, University of Edinburgh Influencing parameters The tendency of a boundary layer to separate primarily depends on the distribution of the adverse or negative edge velocity gradient du_o/ds (s) < 0 along the surface, which in turn is directly related to the pressure and its gradient by the differential form of the Bernoulli relation, which is the same as the momentum equation for the outer inviscid flow. :\\\\rho u_o {du_o \\\\over ds} = -{dp \\\\over ds} But the general magnitudes of du_o/ds required for separation are much greater for turbulent than for laminar flow, the former being able to tolerate nearly an order of magnitude stronger flow deceleration. A secondary influence is the Reynolds number. For a given adverse du_o/ds distribution, the separation resistance of a turbulent boundary layer increases slightly with increasing Reynolds number. In contrast, the separation resistance of a laminar boundary layer is independent of Reynolds number — a somewhat counterintuitive fact. Internal separation Boundary layer separation can occur for internal flows. It can result from such causes such as a rapidly expanding duct of pipe. Separation occurs due to an adverse pressure gradient encountered as the flow expands, causing an extended region of separated flow. The part of the flow that separates the recirculating flow and the flow through the central region of the duct is called the dividing streamline.Wilcox, David C. Basic Fluid Mechanics. 3rd ed. Mill Valley: DCW Industries, Inc., 2007. 664-668. The point where the dividing streamline attaches to the wall again is called the reattachment point. As the flow goes farther downstream it eventually achieves an equilibrium state and has no reverse flow. Effects of boundary layer separation When the boundary layer separates, its remnants form a shear layerhttps://www.aps.org/units/dfd/resources/upload/prandtl_vol58no12p42_48.pdf, Fig 3 and the presence of a separated flow region between the shear layer and surface modifies the outside potential flow and pressure field. In the case of airfoils, the pressure field modification results in an increase in pressure drag, and if severe enough will also result in stall and loss of lift, all of which are undesirable. For internal flows, flow separation produces an increase in the flow losses, and stall-type phenomena such as compressor surge, both undesirable phenomena.Fielding, Suzanne. \\"Laminar Boundary Layer Separation.\\" 27 October 2005. The University of Manchester. 12 March 2008 . Another effect of boundary layer separation is regular shedding vortices, known as a Kármán vortex street. Vortices shed from the bluff downstream surface of a structure at a frequency depending on the speed of the flow. Vortex shedding produces an alternating force which can lead to vibrations in the structure. If the shedding frequency coincides with a resonance frequency of the structure, it can cause structural failure. These vibrations could be established and reflected at different frequencies based on their origin in adjacent solid or fluid bodies and could either damp or amplify the resonance.

She served as Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia from 2006 to 2010, She previously served as chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors from 1995 to 2003, as a county Supervisor for the Providence District from 1986 to 1995, and on the Fairfax County School Board.  Early life and education  The daughter of teachers Everett E. and Anna Catherine (Blanchard) Keith, Katherine Anne Keith grew up in Columbia, Missouri and graduated from David H. Hickman High School in 1961. She then attended the University of Missouri where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and graduated in 1965 with a B.A. in French Civilization and a B.S. in Secondary Education. Keith next attended Harvard University, where she received a M.A.T. in Social Science in 1966. On August 6, 1966, Keith married Edward John Hanley of Endicott, New York. The couple moved to Northern Virginia that same year, and would go on to have two children; son Patrick Keith and daughter Cecelia Anne. Career Hanley began her career as a teacher at George Mason Junior-Senior High School in the city of Falls Church. She also worked as a guidance counselor at the University of Missouri before leaving teaching in 1970. From 1976 to 1982, she and her husband owned and operated the Manor Home Center in Mountain Lake Park, Maryland. In 1984, Hanley was appointed to the Fairfax County School Board by Providence District Supervisor James M. Scott to replace Ann P. Kahn. Supervisor Scott announced his resignation in May 1986, and Circuit Court Judge Barnard F. Jennings set a special election to fill the unexpired term Scott's Providence District seat. Hanley defeated Republican State Delegate Stephen E. Gordy in the July 15 election. The following March, Hanley announced she would seek reelection to a full term as Supervisor from the Providence District. In the November 3 election, Hanley soundly defeated Republican Myron Smith with 62 percent of the vote. Despite Republican attempts to link her to then chair of the board Audrey Moore and a general sentiment against incumbents, Hanley was able to retain her seat on the board of supervisors in the 1991 elections, defeating Steve Armstrong. Thomas M. Davis was elected to Congress in 1994, necessitating a special election to fill his vacant seat as chairman of the board of supervisors. Hanley won the February 1995 special election, defeating Springfield Supervisor Elaine McConnell. Nine months later, Hanley retained the chair by defeating school board chairman Gary L. Jones in the November regular election. Hanley opted for a less visible presence as chair than some of her predecessors, such as Jack Herrity and Tom Davis, saying that the community did not prefer \\"show horses over workhorses\\", and also garnered some criticism as not having a clearly defined vision. However, the Republicans did not field a candidate against her in the 1999 election, and she handily defeated her three independent challengers, winning by a 3 to 1 margin. In 2000, Hanley sought the Democratic nomination to run for Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, following the withdrawal of State Senator Emily Couric due to illness, but withdrew in November. Richmond mayor Tim Kaine would ultimately gain his party's nomination. In 2003, Hanley did not seek reelection to the board of supervisors, and instead mounted a primary challenge against Jim Moran for Virginia's 8th congressional district, after Moran damaged himself politically by saying that American Jews were responsible for pushing the country to war with Iraq and that Jewish leaders could prevent war if they wanted to. She abandoned that campaign in November for family reasons. In July 2004 Governor Mark Warner appointed her to the Commonwealth Transportation Board. Following Tim Kaine's election as governor in November 2005, she was rumored to be a possible contender for Virginia Secretary of Transportation, but was passed over in favor of incumbent Secretary Pierce Homer. Instead, Kaine appointed her as Secretary of the Commonwealth of Virginia following the Virginia General Assembly's rejection of his first nominee, state AFL-CIO President Daniel G. LeBlanc. Governor Terry McAuliffe appointed Hanley to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board in November 2014. She currently serves as a member of the Fairfax County Electoral Board.

It is the most important viral cause of respiratory infection in foals. Like other herpes viruses, EHV-4 causes a lifelong latent infection in affected animals. These horses are usually the source for new infection for foals over two months old, weanlings, and yearlings. Symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, and discharge from the nose. Most infected animals recover in one to three weeks, but death can occur in environments with overcrowding and other stress factors. There are several vaccines available (ATCvet codes: inactivated, live, plus various combinations). Description EHV-4 is an upper respiratory disease restricted to the infection of the respiratory tract epithelium and its associated lymph nodes. EHV 4 and its close relative EHV 1 are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable and are the primary pathogens that causing respiratory tract disease in young horses from weanling to 2 years of age. Incubation period of Equine Herpiesvirus is 2–10 days. Symptoms include fever (38.9–41.7 °C), loss of appetite, and a nasal discharge giving it the nickname \\"snots\\". Without antibiotic treatment, the damage to the respiratory mucosal barrier predisposes infected horses to secondary infections and the involvement of the lower airways (ex. bronchiolitis or pneumonia); Increasing the duration, severity and the mortality of the disease. EHV-4 rarely causes abortion in infected pregnant mares unlike its EHV-1 counterpart. Although there is no specific treatment for the disease once a horse is infected, vaccination against EHV-1 and EHV-4 is recommended as part of preventative herd health for those at high risk of infection. Multiple vaccines are available (Duvaxyn EHV1,4, EquiGuard, EquiVac EHV-1/4, etc.), most in an inactivated virus form. The Equine Herpesvirus occupies the horse in such a way that allows post infection viral persistency over the lifetime of an animal. These carrier horses may comprise up to half of a given horse population. Therefore, management practices are recommended for controlling and managing EHV include isolating incoming horses for 3–4 weeks before co-mingling with resident horses and pregnant mares, reducing stress to prevent the reappearance of a latent virus and if there is an appearance of EHV affected horses should be isolated, and disinfection of the contaminated premise should commence. (The EHV has a large genome (150 kb) which is enclosed in a relatively fragile capsule. This limits their survival in the external environment and makes them highly susceptible to common disinfectants.) After an outbreak no horse should leave the premise for three weeks after the final clinical case recovers. Effective prevention measures, quick diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and the ability to control the spread in the case of an outbreak all allow for the management of EHV.

Because of the planet's somewhat eccentric orbit, scientists were able to confirm another planet within the system (HD 217107 c). Discovery It was found by detecting small variations in the radial velocity of the star it orbits, caused by the tug of its gravity. A study of the radial velocity of HD 217107 carried out in 1998 revealed that its motion along the line of sight varied over a 7.1 day cycle. The period and amplitude of this variation indicated that it was caused by a planetary companion in orbit around the star, with a minimum mass slightly greater than that of Jupiter. The planet's mean distance from the star is less than one fifth of Mercury's distance from the Sun. =Indication of second planet= While most planets with orbital periods of less than 10 days have almost circular orbits, HD 217107 b has a somewhat eccentric orbit, and its discoverers hypothesized that this could be due to the gravitational influence of a second planet in the system at a distance of several astronomical units (AU).

Although the origin of the poem was disputed until later in her life, Mary Frye's authorship was purportedly confirmed in 1998 after research by Abigail Van Buren, a newspaper columnist. Structure The poem is twelve lines long, rhyming in couplets. Each line is in iambic tetrameter, except for lines five and seven which have an extra syllable.https://www.ipl.org/essay/Analysis-Of-Do-Not-Stand-At-My- PKFEPJB74AJPR Origins There have been many claimants to the poem's authorship, including attributions to traditional and Native American origins. Dear Abby author Abigail Van Buren researched the poem's history and concluded in 1998 that Mary Elizabeth Frye, who was living in Baltimore at the time, had written the poem in 1932. According to Van Buren's research, Frye had never written any poetry, but the plight of a German Jewish woman, Margaret Schwarzkopf, who was staying with her and her husband, had inspired the poem. Margaret Schwarzkopf was concerned about her mother, who was ill in Germany, but she had been warned not to return home because of increasing unrest. When her mother died, the heartbroken young woman told Frye that she never had the chance to \\"stand by my mother's grave and shed a tear\\". Frye, according to Van Buren's research, found herself composing a piece of verse on a brown paper shopping bag. Later she said that the words \\"just came to her\\" and expressed what she felt about life and death. Frye circulated the poem privately, never publishing it. She wrote other poems, but this, her first, endured. Her obituary in The Times stated that she was the author of the famous poem, which has been recited at funerals and on other appropriate occasions around the world for 60 years. However, other, similar versions of this poem had been circulating for some time and were sometimes found in tombstones prior to when Frye claimed to have written the poem, and Frye did not produce any real evidence that she actually wrote this work. In addition, while there had been considerable anti-semitism in Germany back in 1932, the Nazis did not win power until 1933, weakening the veracity of Frye's story which was never corroborated. In Popular Culture The poem was introduced to many in the United Kingdom when it was read by the father of a soldier killed by a bomb in Northern Ireland. The soldier's father read the poem on BBC radio in 1995 in remembrance of his son, who had left the poem among his personal effects in an envelope addressed 'To all my loved ones'. The poem first four lines are engraved on one of the stones of the Everest Memorial, Chukpi Lhara, in Dhugla valley, near Everest. Reference to the wind and snow and the general theme of the poem, the absence of the departed, particularly resonate with the loved ones of those who \\"disappeared\\" in the mountain range to whom the memorial is dedicated. The poem is a common reading for funerals. It was recited in season four episode ten of Desperate Housewives by character Karen McClusky, as she scatters her best friends ashes onto a baseball field. BBC poll To coincide with National Poetry Day 1995, the British television programme The Bookworm conducted a poll to discover the nation's favourite poems, and subsequently published the winning poems in book form. The book's preface stated that \\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\" was \\"the unexpected poetry success of the year from Bookworm's point of view\\"; the poem had \\"provoked an extraordinary response... the requests started coming in almost immediately and over the following weeks the demand rose to a total of some thirty thousand. In some respects it became the nation's favourite poem by proxy... despite it being outside the competition.\\"Geoff Stephens. \\"Who DID Write the Nation's Favourite Poem?\\" October 2002. Retrieved November 25, 2012. This was all the more remarkable, since the name and nationality of the American poet did not become known until several years later. In 2004 The Times wrote: \\"The verse demonstrated a remarkable power to soothe loss. It became popular, crossing national boundaries for use on bereavement cards and at funerals regardless of race, religion or social status\\". Translations The poem has been translated into Danish, Dutch, French, German, Hebrew, Croatian, Ilocano, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, and other languages. Several Swedish versions exist. One version starts: \\"Gråt ej vid min grav...\\" Translated, it reads: \\"Do not weep at my grave - I am not there / I am in the sun's reflection in the sea / I am in the wind's play above the grain fields / I am in the autumn's gentle rain / I am in the Milky Way's string of stars / And when on an early morning you are awaked by bird's song / It is my voice that you are hearing / So do not weep at my grave - we shall meet again.\\" (Instead of these last four words there is also this version: \\"I am not dead. I only left\\".) Every so often the poem and similar variations appear in death and funeral announcements in Swedish morning papers (such as Svenska Dagbladet August 14, 2010). On August 29, 2010, the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter carried the following short English version: \\"I am thousand winds that blow / I am the diamond glints on snow / I am the sunlight, I am the rain / Do not stand on my grave and cry / I am not there / I did not die\\". Derivative works Several notable choral compositions, pop songs, and other creative works have been based on \\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\", adapting lines from Frye's poem as lyrics. *The Better Angels of Our Nature (song by Monks of Doom): Parts of \\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\" are interpolated with the lyrics to the rock song \\"The Better Angels of Our Nature,\\" from the 1991 Monks of Doom album Meridian. *Requiem (composition by Eleanor Joanne Daley): Eleanor Joanne Daley's Requiem (1993) includes a movement titled \\"In Remembrance\\", which uses the poem as its text.

It is part of Newman's song cycle, Songs On Motherhood in G Major, Op. 36, No. 2: V. In Newman's setting the poem clearly states that death is not an end, but a metamorphosis that makes possible a melding with our physical earth and metaphysical surroundings. In this final movement, the voice emerges with a prayerful plainchant, as the tutti ensemble blossoms into the movement proper. *\\"The Ballad of Mairéad Farrell\\" (song by Seanchai and the Unity Squad): On Seanchai and the Unity Squad's 1998 album Rebel Hip Hop, the song \\"The Ballad of Mairéad Farrell\\" tells the story of Mairéad Farrell, a member of the Irish Republican Army, and her imprisonment and eventual death at the hands of British security forces in Gibraltar. The song uses the opening couplet from the poem, and alters the closing couplet to say, \\"Do not stand at my grave and cry / When Ireland lives, I do not die.\\" *\\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\" (song by Alias Grace): On Embers, the 1998 debut album by British ambient folk duo Alias Grace (Peter Chilvers and Sandra O'Neill), the closing track is a straight setting of the original poem for piano, voice, guitar and Chapman Stick. *\\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\" (composition by Paul K. Joyce): At the request of a friend who had been diagnosed with cancer, composer Paul K. Joyce wrote a song for her funeral, setting the text of \\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\" to music.

The song used the same title as the poem and was included on Libera's 2004 album Free. *\\"A Thousand Winds\\" (song by Man Arai): Japanese singer-songwriter Man Arai (新井 満) translated the poem into Japanese and composed the song \\"\\" (translation: \\"Become A Thousand Winds\\"), originally sung by Man Arai himself. Other singers later covered the song, among them Japanese tenor Masafumi Akikawa (秋川 雅史).

In January 2007, it became the first classical music piece to top the Oricon weekly singles chart and became the first classical music piece to top the Oricon yearly singles chart. Another version of this song appeared on Hayley Westenra's 2008 album Hayley Sings Japanese Songs (with the title \\"Sen No Kaze Ni Natte\\"). *\\"The Soft Stars that Shine at Night\\" (choral composition by David Bedford): In 2006, several choirs in the United Kingdom commissioned a choral work from David Bedford through the organization Making Music. The resulting piece, entitled The Soft Stars that Shine at Night, was first performed in 2007. Its last movement is a setting of this poem, with slight alterations to the words. *Eternal Light: A Requiem (composition by Howard Goodall): Howard Goodall's choral orchestral work Eternal Light: A Requiem was recorded in 2008 with the Choir of Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford. \\"Do not stand\\" is in the Lacrymosa which is track 5. *\\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\" (composition by Kevin Siegfried) : The poem forms the lyrics for this piece for Soprano Solo and Keyboard or Harp from Siegfried's Cantata Songs for the Journey written in 2010 *\\"Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep\\" (song by Harry Manx and Kevin Breit): A song of this title, with lyrics adapted from the poem, appears on the album Strictly Whatever by the duo Harry Manx and Kevin Breit.

The planet was the second planet to be discovered orbiting the star HD 217107. HD 217107 c's existence was hypothesized in 1998 due to the eccentricity of the inner planet's orbit and confirmed in 2005 when radial velocity studies of the star indicated another, more distant and massive companion orbiting the star. The planet has an eccentric orbit lasting on order of a decade. Detection and discovery A study of the radial velocity of HD 217107 carried out in 1998 revealed that its motion along the line of sight varied over a 7.1 day cycle, indicating the presence of a planet in orbit around the star. The planet was designated HD 217107 b, and was found to be somewhat heavier than Jupiter, and orbiting extremely close to the parent star in an orbit with quite a large eccentricity. Most planets with orbital periods of less than 10 days have almost circular orbits, and its discoverers proposed that the high eccentricity of HD 217107 b's orbit could be due to the gravitational influence of a second planet in the system at a distance of several astronomical units (AU). Confirmation of the existence of the second planet followed in 2005, and it was designated HD 217107 c. The parameters of this planet was initially very weakly constrained, with a period in excess of 8 years with a high eccentricity and a minimum mass of approximately two times the mass of Jupiter. Continued observations restrained the plausible solutions substantially, resulting in the current parameters published in 2008.

History The school opened in 1965, serving grades 7-11. The Ocean Township seniors completed their final year at Asbury Park High School, which all Ocean Township public school students attended prior to the construction of OTHS. Thus OTHS graduated its first class in 1967. Gradually, the 7th and 8th grade students were moved to other schools. Beginning in the 1975-76 school year, with the opening of the then 7-9 Ocean Township Intermediate School, the school only served 10-12, with the freshman class returning to OTHS for the 1978-79 school year. At the end of the 2016-17 school year, Loch Arbour left the Ocean Township district after getting approval from the New Jersey Department of Education and following the overwhelming passage of a referendum.

Initial spread of EHV-1 by a newly introduced horse through direct and indirect contact can lead to abortion and perinatal infection in up to 70 percent of a previously unexposed herd. Abortion usually occurs in the last four months of gestation, two to four weeks after infection of the mare. Perinatal (around the time of birth) infection can lead to pneumonia and death. Encephalitis can occur in affected animals, leading to ataxia, paralysis, and death. There is a vaccine available (ATCvet code ), however its efficacy is questionable. The virus varies in severity from sub-clinical to very severe. Most horses have been infected with EHV-1, but the virus can become latent and persist without ever causing signs of infection. In 2006, an outbreak of EHV-1 among stables in Florida resulted in the institution of quarantine measures. The outbreak was determined to have originated in horses imported from Europe via New York, before being shipped to Florida.  Strains  Two main strains of EHV-1 have been isolated. D752 strains are correlated to outbreaks associated with neurological disease, whereas outbreaks with non-neurological disease are more closely associated with strains of N752. However, not all horses infected with D752 strains develop neurological disease; conversely, some horses infected with N752 strains will develop neurological disease.D.P. Lunn, N. Davis-Poynter, M.J.B.F. Flaminio, D.W. Horohov, K. Osterrieder, N. Pusterla, H.G.G Townsned. \\"Equine Herpesvirus-1 Consensus Statement.\\" May. Wiley Online Library. November 2014. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1939-1676.2009.0304.x/full A mutation results in both these two different main strains, D752 is the presence of aspartic acid and the N752 is the presence of asparagine. 80–90% of neurological disease is caused by the D752, and 10–20% for N752.\\"Equine Herpes Virus.\\" n.d. American Association of Equine Practitioners. November 2014. The disease caused by neurological strains has been named Equine Herpesvirus Myeloencephalopathy or EHM. There is currently no licensed vaccine against EHM and no treatment other than palliative care. The disease rose to worldwide public prominence in early 2011, due to an outbreak centered on the National Cutting Horse Association (NCHA) Western National Championships held in Ogden, Utah from April 29 to May 8, 2011. The outbreak lasted approximately two months, generating 90 confirmed cases of the disease, spread over 10 American states, and resulting in the deaths of 13 horses before it was declared contained by the US Department of Agriculture. = Latency = The EHV-1 virus can latently infect horses and can reactivate if appropriate conditions appear. These conditions include high levels of stress, immunosuppression, transportation,M Dunowska (2014) A review of equid herpesvirus 1 for the veterinary practitioner. Part A: Clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment, New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 62:4, 179–188, DOI: 10.1080/00480169.2014.899946. sale barns, competitions,M Dunowska (2014) A review of equid herpesvirus 1 for the veterinary practitioner. Part B:pathogenesis and epidemiology, New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 62:4, 179–188, DOI: 10.1080/00480169.2014.899946 geological and management practices. Current studies that have been done are showing that a majority of horses are actually latently infected with EHV-1. The consequence of latency is that in fact, it can cause an outbreak of EHV-1 in a closed group of horses, without any external source. Latent infected horses do not shed EHV-1 through nasal secretions and therefore are not infectious and are called clinically normal.  Signs, symptoms and transmission  The signs the occur with EHV-1 and the EHM strain include things such as decreased coordination, urine dribbling, fever, hind limb weakness, leaning against things to maintain balance, lethargy and the inability to get off the ground.\\"Equine Herpersvirus (EHV).\\" December 2008. Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. November 2014 More signs of the infection of this virus include depression, anorexia, nasal and ocular discharges. Fever is the most common clinical sign of EHV-1, some horses that appear perfectly healthy can still spread the virus from nostril secretions and also from secretions from coughing. Horses or humans that have been in contact with aborted fetuses, fetal fluids and placentae can easily spread the virus. When a human walks through secretions or walks in fetal fluid and gets it on their boots it will be transmitted to wherever they walk. It is highly transmissible. Most mature horses build some type of immunity through repeated natural exposure, but will not build immunity to the EHM strain. = Risk factors = There is a strong correlation between the risk factors and infected horses. The main risk factors that are directly related to EHV-1 include age, confined vs pasture, higher traffic of people and horses in and out of stables, use of common equipment, training and competition, the sex of the horse, the gender and even what season it is. Horses that are stabled are more prone to EHV-1 because of stress, those in pastures have less stress. Older horses have a higher susceptibility, and during the time of winter and spring are all risk factors. The horses past exposure has a huge increase in risk factor, transporting and hauling frequently also increases the risk.  Diagnosis, treatment and prevention  = Treatment = The current diagnosis for EHV-1 is PCR, polymerase chain reaction, which copies the DNA so one can see if a virus is in the DNA segment. PCR can detect the viral load in the DNA, telling if the horse is very infected or below detection levels. To get samples for PCR a veterinarian may want to have an uncoagulated blood sample and also a nasal swab. There are a few downfalls of PCR one being that it is very time-consuming and takes a while to get back samples and results and the other downfall is how the results are interpreted. Horses can have a latent virus but not show clinical signs and be called clinically normal, except the PCR results will give positive test result when it's not so straightforward The one other downfall of PCR is that there is not standardized protocols between the laboratories. Treatment for EHV-1 is limited at the time and there isn't one definitive treatment that is guaranteed to work. The treatments now include intravenous fluids, I.V's, or anti-inflammatory drugs. = Prevention = Vaccines exist to control the virus but not to prevent it. The inactivated vaccine contain a low antigen load and are made to help protect against the respiratory symptoms, the performance of the inactivated vaccines is variable are doesn't work for all. The modified live vaccine is made to vaccinate healthy horses 3 months or older, to help prevent the respiratory symptoms caused by EHV-1. Vaccinations should be given in 6-month intervals, and different horses will need to be vaccinated at different times. Pregnant mares should be vaccinated during the fifth, seventh and ninth months of gestation, with the inactivated EHV-1 vaccine. Foals should be vaccinated in a series of 3 doses starting at 3 months in 4–6 week intervals. Even though a horse has been vaccinated, infection and clinical disease still continues to occur. New vaccines to help prevent the spread of the virus are being studied. To prevent the spread of EHV-1, there are a few steps that should be taken. Most important is to stop horse movement and transportation; not allowing horses that have been exposed to EHV-1 to be in contact with unexposed horses; and to isolate animals that are showing symptoms of the virus. Ideally, horses that are showing symptoms should be completely quarantined. The recommended quarantined period is at least 21 days. Another facet of EHV-1 control is to be aware of the potential for spreading the virus via equipment, and transmission, via human contact, between horses. Since people can and do transfer this virus via their hands and clothing, people need to take sanitary precautions when handling a sick horse. Disinfecting footwear and wearing gloves can help minimize the risk of spreading. Routinely cleaning and disinfecting the barns and buildings where horses have been is important for preventing transmission. In the case of an outbreak, one should also take precautions to minimize stress on the horses. As stated previously, stress will trigger a latent virus to reactivate, and it can allow an uninfected horse to be more easily infected.

Fortuna is Spanish for fortune or luck. History An old Spanish pack of Fortuna cigarettes, with a Spanish text warning at the bottom of the pack Fortuna was first introduced in 1974 in Francoist Spain by Tabacalera, a Spanish tobacco conglomerate which is now half of the Altadis corporation. When Fortuna was launched in 1974, the market was dominated by black tobacco and the few international brands of blonde (light) cigarettes that were very expensive for the Spanish smoker. As a response to this, Tabacalera launched Fortuna cigarettes which were a type of blonde tobacco with a filter. With Fortuna came the first American blonde flavoured cigarette and in its first six months almost 700 million cigarettes were sold. From that moment, the brand did not stop growing and only ten years later, it began its adventure at an international level; first in France, and then in countries like Italy, Morocco and the United States, where the cigarettes are known for their \\"Spanish character\\". For more than thirty years, Fortuna has been the best- selling brand in the blonde cigarette market, surpassing even the arrival of international brands in Spain. The tobacco mixture used in Fortuna cigarettes is of a Virginia type. As of 2006 the brand remains the market leader in Spain. In April 2008, Altadis changed the pack design to a \\"new and modernised look\\" and reduced the amount of its big pack cigarettes from 25 to 24, with the aim of setting a round price (which was €3,00 at the time). At the time, Fortuna was the second best-selling brand on the cigarette market. In 2007 it obtained 10.665 million cigarettes were sold, with an increase in volume of 3%, which allowed it to increase its quota by 0.3 points to reach almost 14% of the segment of blond cigarettes. The great rival of Altadis is Philip Morris International, which advanced in global market share last month (32.26% vs. 31.39%), according to data from the Commissioner for the Market of Tobacco, published in the Expansión. In 2013, Fortuna was the fourth best- selling brand in Spain with more than 184,000,000 packs sold. In 2015, the taxes of Fortuna, Ducados and Nobel were once again increased from €4.40 to €4.45; an increase of 5 cents. In December 2016, Altadis raised the price of their Fortuna, Ducados and Nobel brands with 10 cents, while opting to keep their Fortuna soft pack brand at €4,45.  Advertising  Tabacalera and Altadis made various poster and magazine advertisements in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s to promote the Fortuna brand. Besides poster and magazine adverts, a few TV adverts were also made. Some were made for Spain, but also for other countries such as Venezuela. A few telephone cards have also been made, featuring Fortuna adverting on them. Other memorabilia that Tabacalera made during the time, includes lighters, calendars and game cars, featuring Fortuna advertising. Sponsorship =Grand prix motorcycle racing= Fortuna was a sponsor of various teams within the Grand Prix motorcycle racing classes. In races where anti-tobacco laws were in places (such as France and Germany) the Fortuna name was replaced with the \\"Spain's N°1\\" logo.

Society founder Henry Gerber was inspired to create it by the work of German doctor Magnus Hirschfeld and the Scientific- Humanitarian Committee. It was the first recognized gay rights organization in the United States, having received a charter from the state of Illinois, and produced the first American publication for homosexuals, Friendship and Freedom. A few months after being chartered, the group ceased to exist in the wake of the arrest of several of the Society's members. Despite its short existence and small size, the Society has been recognized as a precursor to the modern gay liberation movement. Henry Gerber Henry Gerber emigrated from Imperial Germany in 1913,Loughery, p. 53 settling with his family in Chicago because of its large German-speaking population. Within a few years of his arrival he experienced discrimination based on his sexual orientation when he was temporarily committed to a mental institution in 1917 for being homosexual. With the United States's entry into World War I, Gerber enlisted in the United States Army. After the war, he served as a printer and proofreader with the Allied Army of Occupation in Coblenz, Germany,Bullough, p. 25 from 1920 to 1923.Katz (1983), p. 554 During his time in Germany, Gerber learned about Magnus Hirschfeld and the work he and his Scientific- Humanitarian Committee were doing to reform anti-homosexual German law, especially Paragraph 175, which criminalized sex between men.Hogan and Hudson, p. 245 Gerber traveled to Berlin, which supported a thriving gay subculture,Hogan and Hudson, p. 246 on several occasions and subscribed to at least one homophile magazine. Gerber marveled at the development of the gay community in Berlin and later wrote \\"I had always bitterly felt the injustice with which my own American society accused the homosexual of 'immoral acts.' What could be done about it, I thought. Unlike Germany, where the homosexual was partially organized and where sex legislation was uniform for the whole country, the United States was in a condition of chaos and misunderstanding concerning its sex laws, and no one was trying to unravel the tangle and bring relief to the abused.\\" He was particularly impressed with the work of a group called Bund für Menschenrechte (Association for Human Rights) and absorbed a number of Hirschfeld's ideas, including the notion that homosexual men were naturally effeminate.Despite being naturally masculine and disliking the company of women and effeminate men, (Bullough, p. 32) Gerber would continue to espouse the idea of gay men's effeminacy, writing in 1932, \\"The homosexual man does not shun women because he wants to flee from the reality of normal sex life, but because he himself is a woman and his normal sex life is directed to the other sex, another man.\\" (Collected in Blasius and Phane, p. 220) Following his military service, Gerber returned to the United States and went to work for the post office in Chicago. Founding the Society Inspired by Hirschfeld's work with the Scientific-Humanitarian Committee, Gerber resolved to found a similar organization in the United States. He called his group the Society for Human Rights (the English translation of Bund für Menschenrecht)Bianco, p. 75 and took on the role of secretary. Gerber filed an application for a charter as a non-profit organization with the state of Illinois on December 10, 1924. The application outlined the goals and purposes of the Society: > [T]o promote and protect the interests of people who by reasons of mental > and physical abnormalities are abused and hindered in the legal pursuit of > happiness which is guaranteed them by the Declaration of Independence and to > combat the public prejudices against them by dissemination of factors > according to modern science among intellectuals of mature age. The Society > stands only for law and order; it is in harmony with any and all general > laws insofar as they protect the rights of others, and does in no manner > recommend any acts in violation of present laws nor advocate any manner > inimical to the public welfare.quoted in Katz (1976), pp. 386–87Of course, > since sodomy was illegal in every state in 1924, any participation in or > advocacy of sex with other men would constitute a recommendation of an act > in violation of a present law. Illinois was the first state to repeal its > law but did not do so until 1962 (Hogan and Hudson, p. 634). An African American clergyman named John T. Graves signed on as president of the new organization and Gerber, Graves and five others were listed as directors. The state granted the charter on December 24, 1924, making the Society the oldest documented homosexual organization in the nation.Hogan and Hudson, p. 244 Despite deliberately keeping the goals of the Society vague and excluding any mention of homosexuality from its mission statement, Society members were still surprised that no one with the state investigated any further before issuing the charter. The society's newsletter, Friendship and Freedom, was the first gay-interest publication in the United States. However, few Society members were willing to receive mailings of the newsletter, fearing that postal inspectors would deem the publication obscene under the Comstock Act. Indeed, all gay-interest publications were deemed obscene until 1958, when the Supreme Court ruled in One, Inc. v. Olesen that publishing homosexual content did not mean the content was automatically obscene.Murdoch and Price, p. 47 Two issues of Friendship and Freedom were written and produced, entirely by Gerber. No copies of the newsletter are known to exist.Bianco, p. 77 Gerber formulated a three-point strategy for winning what he referred to as \\"homosexual emancipation\\": #\\"...engage in a series of lectures pointing out the attitude of society in relation to their own behavior and especially urging against the seduction of adolescents. #\\"Through a publication...we would keep the homophile world in touch with the progress of our efforts.... #\\"Through self-discipline, homophiles would win the confidence and assistance of legal authorities and legislators in understanding the problem: that these authorities should be educated on the futility and folly of long prison terms for those committing homosexual acts.\\"With this strategy, Gerber anticipated by some three decades the strategies that would be adopted by such early homophile organizations as the Mattachine Society, ONE, Inc. and the Daughters of Bilitis. Each of these organizations organized lectures, published nationally-distributed magazines and sought legal reforms by exploiting the disease model of homosexuality, reasoning that homosexuals should not be punished for something over which they had no control (Bianco, pp. 136–37, 143; Loughery, p. 235–37). Gerber set out to expand the Society's membership beyond the original seven but had difficulty interesting anyone other than poorer gays in joining; he was also unable to gain any financial support from the more affluent members of Chicago's gay community. Gerber sought out the support of people in the medical professions and sex education advocates and was frustrated when he was unable to secure it, because of their fear of ruining their reputations through the association with homosexuality. Contemplating this failure in 1962, Gerber stated, > The first difficulty was in rounding up enough members and contributors so > the work could go forward. The average homosexual, I found, was ignorant > concerning himself. Others were fearful. Still others were frantic or > depraved. Some were blasé. Many homosexuals told me that their search for > forbidden fruit was the real spice of life. With this argument, they > rejected our aims. We wondered how we could accomplish anything with such > resistance from our own people.Katz (1976), p. 388 Gerber shouldered all of the labor and financial obligations for the Society and for production of Friendship and Freedom, something he was willing to do in service of the cause, believing it possible he would be remembered as the gay Abraham Lincoln for his effort.Bianco, p. 76 The Society sought affiliation with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology but the British Society declined, afraid of being linked with any organization that was specifically for homosexuals.Katz (1983), p. 420 Demise Gerber and Graves decided to limit Society membership to gay men and exclude bisexuals. Unknown to them, the Society's vice-president Al Weininger, a man Gerber described as \\"an indigent laundry queen\\", was married with two children. Weininger's wife reported the Society to a social worker in the summer of 1925,Loughery, p. 54 calling them \\"degenerates\\" and making claims of \\"strange doings\\" in front of her children. The police broke in on Gerber in the middle of the night with a reporter from the Chicago Examiner in tow, interrogated him, seized his personal papers and arrested him. The next morning, Gerber arrived in court to learn that Graves, Weininger and Weininger's male companion had also been arrested. The Examiner reported the story under the headline \\"Strange Sex Cult Exposed\\".Bullough, p. 27 The paper erroneously reported that Weininger and other members of the Society had performed sex acts in front of Weininger's children and that Society literature encouraged men to abandon their wives and children. This latter statement was in direct contradiction to the Society's policy of only admitting men who were exclusively homosexual. Gerber was put through three separate trials, before charges against him were finally dismissed because he was arrested without a warrant. Gerber's defense cost him his life savings,Bullough, p. 28 some of which may have been in the form of bribes paid through his lawyer.Loughery, p. 55 The police never returned Gerber's personal papers, his typewriter or his remaining copies of Friendship and Freedom despite a court order compelling their return. The only concrete record of the newsletter's existence is a photograph of one issue in a German homophile magazine and a review of the issue in a French homophile publication.Bullough, p. 26 Although Gerber avoided prosecution for obscenity under the Comstock Act, he lost his post office job for \\"conduct unbecoming a postal worker\\". Weininger paid a $10 fine ($ in 2013 dollars) for \\"disorderly conduct\\". With Gerber feeling he had hit a \\"solid wall of ignorance, hypocrisy, meanness and corruption\\"quoted in Fone, p. 382 and unable to continue his financial support, the Society dismantled, and Gerber was left embittered that none of the wealthier gays of Chicago had come to his aid for a cause he believed was designed to advance the common good. He left Chicago for New York City, where he re-enlisted in the Army, serving for 17 years before being honorably discharged. Legacy Former Location of the Society for Human Rights, 1710 N. Crilly Court, Chicago 2015 the 1700 block of Crilly Court, in Chicago Crilly Court, Chicago 2015 Henry Gerber and the Society for Human Rights serve as direct links between the LGBT-related activism of the Weimar Republic and the American homophile movement of the 1950s. In 1929, a young man named Harry Hay was living in Los Angeles. He soon discovered the cruising scene in Pershing Square, where he met Champ Simmons,Hay and Roscoe, p. 355 a man who had been a lover of one of Gerber's Society compatriots. This man told Hay about the Society's brief history,Loughery, p. 225 warning Hay of the futility of trying to organize gay men.Timmons, p. 145 Although Hay would later deny that he had any knowledge of previous LGBT activism,Gay Almanac, p. 131 he was inspired by this knowledge to conceive in 1948 a proposal for a gay men's political and social group. In 1950 Hay's idea reached fruition when he and several other men founded the Mattachine Society, the first enduring LGBT rights organization in the United States.Hogan and Hudson, pp. 382–83 Gerber was posthumously inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame in 1992. The Henry Gerber House, located at 1710 N. Crilly Court, Chicago, contains the apartment in which Gerber lived when he founded the Society. It was designated a Chicago Landmark on June 1, 2001. In June 2015 it was named a National Historic Landmark. The Gerber/Hart Library at 6500 N. Clark St in Chicago is named in honor of Gerber and early civil rights defender Pearl M. Hart.

The show was hosted by Tom Parks, announced by Burton Richardson, and produced by Jay Wolpert. Three male/female couples (most of the time parents, but occasionally grandparents or couples without children) match their own parenting styles with those of a professional parenting expert by answering questions dealing with a scenario involving a family's child or children in some way. The series was based on The Parent Game, a Chuck Barris-produced game that ran in syndication from 1972–1973; Parent creator Gary Jonke served as supervising producer on Wait 'til You Have Kids. Gameplay =Main game= A scenario question was asked to the three couples, with three possible responses by the parents given, labeled A, B and C. One couple at a time, the parents selected the response they would most likely use in that situation by placing a block labeled \\"A\\", \\"B\\" or \\"C\\" on the top of the score table in front of them and explain their rationale for choosing that response. A question would be as follows: Scenario: Your 17-year-old daughter gets grounded for her grades three days before prom. Do you... :A. Not let her go - no means no, she must stay home because she's grounded? :B. Make an exception for prom because it's a once-in- a-lifetime event, but make it clear she's still grounded beyond that? :C. Unground her altogether? For each question, the host would nominate one member of each couple to make the actual decisions (i.e., either all the husbands, or all the wives), although the one not making the decision on that question would offer an answer and his or her rationale. After all couples had explained their choices, the expert revealed the answer she thought best matched the situation. Any couple whose answers matched the expert's received a set number of points. * Question 1—1 point * Question 2—2 points * Question 3—3 points For the final question of the main game, the couples did not collaborate on an answer, but instead all six players chose an answer on their own. Each correct answer was worth 4 points, so 8 points were possible per couple for this question (for a possible grand total of 14 points for any couple at the end of the game). After all four questions were played, the couple with the most points won the game and proceeded to a bonus round. If there was a tie, a toss-up question like the ones used in the bonus round itself (see below) was asked, with the winner advancing. =Bonus Round= The couple was shown a graphic of a large house with seven windows, all with the lights turned out. Host Parks read a statement (e.g., \\"Your two-year-old tries to eat crayons\\", or \\"Your 15-year-old wants to be a game show host\\"). The couple decided together whether the expert had determined that the scenario was considered a problem at that child's developmental stage, or OK, meaning there was nothing necessarily harmful with the child doing that activity. The couple alternated turns, with the active player displaying his or her answer with a large, two-sided placard (one side reading \\"OK\\" and the other reading \\"Problem\\"). If the answer matched that of the expert, one of the windows was lit up and lighting all seven windows within 60 seconds awarded the couple $1,000 and the grand prize: usually a trip, occasionally another prize, and sometimes—near the very end of the series—a car. If the couple failed to win the bonus round, each window earned the couple $100. Production information The expert from September 30 to November 22 was Ellen C. Winters. Despite her title, a large portion of the answers she gave were called into question by both viewers and professionals. Their questioning of Winters' credentials proved to ring true - it was reported that Winters was in fact not an actual parental expert. When the series returned on December 30 following a five-week hiatus, Winters was replaced by radio and TV talk show host Marilyn Kagan, who held actual social worker/psychology credentials and experience.https://www.hayhouse.com/authorbio/marilyn-kagan-lcsw References Category:Cable game shows Category:The Family Channel (American TV network, founded 1990) original programming Category:1990s American game shows Category:1996 American television series debuts Category:1997 American television series endings Category:Television series by Jay Wolpert Enterprises Category:English-language television shows Category:Television series by MTM Enterprises ","title":"Wait 'til You Have Kids"},{"id":"4871365","text":"The \\"Gujarat Sabha\\" was established in 1884 at Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

Certain groups of people, such as Brahmins, landowners, and Kasars (brass-workers) of Saswad region, were exempted from veth-begar.

On 6 January 1915, Sir Leslie Rundle, Governor and Commander-in-Chief Malta, laid the foundation stone of the new Central Services Hospital. The building was commenced on the assumption that funds would be released to build the ancillary buildings at a later stage. By April 1915, the construction of the main block of the hospital was in hand. By 31 March 1916, the sum of £17,950 had been spent, out of the provisional total of £55,000. It was opened in June 1920 with beds for 6 officers and 190 other ranks.Malta Regimental and Military Hospitals The new hospital was taken over by 30 Coy RAMC on 23 June 1920. The old Barrack Hospital at Mtarfa, adjacent to Q Block, became a Families' Hospital. The former Families' Hospital moved from Valletta in 1920. The Cottonera Hospital was shut. In 1941, the hospital took over its war role and changed its name to 90 British General Hospital (90 BGH). It increased its beds from 200 to 2000 beds by taking over the whole of the infantry barracks for hospital wards, and the pitching of tented wards on the football pitch. 90 BGH reverted to 600 beds in late 1944. On 1st March 1951, the designation of the hospital changed to The David Bruce Military Hospital, after the discoverer of the root cause of brucellosis in 1887 (later traced to goats' milk in 1905 by Sir Themistocles Zammit). In October 1962, the David Bruce Military Hospital was handed over to the Royal Navy Medical Services. After the closure of Royal Naval Hospital Bighi, Mtarfa became the central services hospital. It was modified and re-opened as the David Bruce Royal Naval Hospital Mtarfa on 2nd October 1970 and remained as the only military hospital in Malta until the Royal Navy departed in 1979. It was then converted to a state secondary school named after Sir Temi Zammit, part of St Nicholas College. The school closed and moved to new premises in 2015. The site is now derelict but plans exist to re-open it as an international school. The hospital is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

On February 19, 1945, he landed on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands and before the day ended he had already sustained a slight wound. He was promoted to first lieutenant on March 1, 1945, twenty-five days before his death. A few minutes before dawn on the morning of March 26, the day the Iwo campaign officially closed, the Japanese launched a concentrated attack and penetrated the Marine lines in the area where 1st Lt Martin's platoon was bivouacked. He immediately organized a firing line among the men in the foxholes closest to his own, and temporarily stopped the headlong rush of the enemy. Several of his men were lying wounded in positions overrun by the enemy and the lieutenant was determined to rescue them. In the action which followed, he was severely wounded twice but continued to resist the enemy until he fell mortally wounded by a grenade. The Medal of Honor and citation were presented to his parents by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal at a ceremony in the Navy Department on May 6, 1946.

Khotkevych was a renaissance man and was multi-talented. Although he was trained as a professional engineer, he is known more as a prolific Ukrainian literary figure, and also as a dramatist, composer and ethnographer, and father of the modern bandura.Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus 2003  Early life and education  Khotkevych was born in Kharkiv in 1877. His mother was a domestic worker, though little is known about his father, who left the family in the mid-1880s. As a youth he learned to play the piano and violin and later learned to play the bandura through observing the blind folk kobzars of the region. He completed his tertiary studies in engineering at the Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute in 1900, and then worked as a railway engineer.Koshelivets, I. \\"Khotkevych, Hnat\\" in Encyclopedia of Ukraine, online.

Later there appeared \\"The Prodigal Son\\" (1898), \\"Analogies of Life\\" (1901), and \\"Mountain Aquarelles\\" (1914). His first major successful work was a novel about life in the Carpathian mountains, The Stone Soul, which was published in 1911. Other novels followed: Aviron (1928), Berestechko, and Tarasyk. An eight-volume collection of his writing was published in 1928; many of his unpublished works have been lost. Khotkevych incorporated original folkloric and ethnographic material, in particular folks songs, tales, customs and even dialectical and lingual differences of the region or time which he was writing about. He included many aspects of the modernist style popular in Ukraine at the time. = English Translations = English translations of Hnat Khotkevych's works include: * Short stories: “The Hunger Strike”, “In a Free Country p. 260”, “The Three”, “Facing the Door” and “It Had To Be Thus”Khotkevych, B., 1998, ''Brother against Brother, pp.252-293, Language Lantern Publications, Toronto, (Engl. transl..  Theatre  H. Khotkevych playing bandura in a student play in 1899 As a youth he had the chance of seeing a number of theatrical performances in Kharkiv. He was so taken by these performances that in the summers he organized a theatre in the village of Derkachi for all the peasants. In 1903 he organized a Ukrainian workers theatre in Kharkiv which was also hugely successful. He produced and wrote over 50 plays. Because his activities addressed social and national issues, he was forced to emigrate in 1905 to Halychyna (part of Western Ukraine) which at that time, was under Austro-Hungarian rule. In 1910 whilst in Halychyna he once again organized a theatrical troupe made up of illiterate Hutsuls who had great success touring Western Ukraine performing the ethnographic plays he had created. In 1912 he returned to Kharkiv and after being released form incarceration renewed the activities of the Kharkiv Ukrainian Theatre until his internal exile to Russia in 1914. He continued writing plays, the most interesting was the work Bohdan Khmelnytsky which chronicle the life and times of the renowned Kozak leader in the mid 17th century. In 1936 he played the role in the film Nazar Stodolya, which appeared in 1937, but after being shown briefly for two weeks was removed from showings. Khotkevych wrote a number of studies on the history of theatre in Ukraine such as \\"The Folk Theatre in Galicia\\", and \\"The Theatre in 1848\\".  Music  As a student Khotkevych became well known for his bandura playing. He first purchased an instrument in 1894, and first performed on stage as a soloist in 1896. When he was expelled from the Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute he joined Mykola Lysenko's touring choir as a bandura soloist. At a young age he was renowned as a virtuoso of the bandura. In 1902, he was asked to read a paper on the music and traditions of the folk bandurists known as kobzars at the XIIth Archeological Conference held in Kharkiv in 1902. He prepared a paper and also organized a concert which became the first performance of a bandura ensemble in history. During the congress, he was one of the initiators of the idea of the preservation of kobzar music by means of sound recording using recently invented phonograph. The Kobzar enemble at the XIIth Archeological Conference in Kharkiv in 1902. Since that time this art-form became hugely popular throughout Ukraine. After emigrating to Austria-Hungary in 1906 he traversed Halychyna with solo recitals of bandura music. In 1907, he wrote the first bandura handbook which was published in 1909 in Lviv. In 1910, he had one of his bandura compositions - \\"Odarochka\\" - published in Kiev which became the first composition published for the instrument. He returned to Central Ukraine in 1912 and was soon arrested, jailed and later exiled to Russia. He returned to Kharkiv only in 1917 where he taught Ukrainian Literature and Language at the Kharkiv Zoological College. In 1920 he organised a Ukrainian choir that performed ethnographic choral works and in the 1920s had numerous compositions published. From 1926 on, he taught the first conservatory level courses in bandura at the Kharkiv Music and Drama Institute. A new textbook for the bandura was partially published (the 3 final books were lost at the publishing house). A collection of his compositions for the bandura was prepared but was also lost by the publishing house. Only a handful of students completed these courses such as Leonid Haydamaka, O. Herashchenko, O. Hayevsky, I. Oleshko, and Hryhory Bazhul. Most were arrested in the early 1930s, however some found their way out to the West during World War II. In 1928, Khotkevych became the director of a special bandura studio, organized to retrain and convert the Poltava Bandurist Capella to play in the Kharkiv style. He composed and arranged numerous works for this ensemble. In 1931 the ensemble received the privilege of being the first Soviet ensemble to be invited to tour North America. Unfortunately the tour did not take place and Khotkevych was removed from the directorship of the ensemble in 1932. All of his pieces and arrangements being subsequently banned. Apart from his musical performance and compositions, Khotkevych also produced a number of books on Ukrainian folk instruments,For example \\"Muzychni instrumenty ukraïnsʹkoho narodu\\" published in 1930 and the bandura specifically. These books were openly criticised in the Soviet press and also banned from 1932.  Persecution  As an ethnographer he saw the type of persecution which blind kobzars suffered from Tsarist police whenever they visited the city. He was persecuted by Tsarist authorities because of his association with Ukrainian culture and the bandura. He was removed from studies in 1899, and in 1905 was forced to emigrate. When he returned from Austria-Hungary he was followed by police and incarcerated, and with the outbreak of World War I was forced into internal exile to Russia. From 1928 Khotkevych again had difficulties in all his publishing endeavours. Initially manuscripts began to disappear at publishing houses and in the mail. Works had to be submitted three or four times, and then they were often sabotaged in the publishing houses. Khotkevych wrote numerous letters to complain, but little was done. From 1931, he suffered numerous personal attacks in the Soviet press, which ultimately resulted in all his music and writing being banned in 1932 and him losing all employment. In 1933 his family starved during the Holodomor, as he was not given ration cards because he was officially unemployed. In 1934 someone tried to kill him by pushing him under the wheels of a train. As a result, he was hospitalised for a period with moderately severe injuries to his leg. In February 1938, during the Great Purge, he was arrested and tortured. In 1938 an NKVD tribunal in Kharkiv sentenced him to be shot and his property confiscated. The execution was carried out on 8 October 1938 and his body was buried in a mass grave on the outskirts of Kharkiv. Soviet sources initially falsely stated that he was sent to Siberia for 10 years without the right to correspond. False death certificates were issued to state that he died in 1943.  Postmortem  Khotkevych was politically rehabilitated by the Soviet government in 1956; however, only a small part of his literary output was republished. In 1977, despite being on a UNESCO list of noted cultural figures to be commemorated, nothing was published. In post-1991 Ukraine numerous works by this author have been republished and many manuscripts have found their way from the archives into publications due mainly to the efforts of the Khotkevych foundation in Kharkiv. In 1989 a film was made after the Khotkevytch book Kaminna dusha. directed by Stanislav Klymenko. A documentary about Khokevych's life \\"Sledovat' na sever mozhet'\\" was made in 1991.

It premiered as a single concert in Athens, Greece, in 19931993 concert program. but a recording was only released in 2001 by Vangelis' then new record label Sony Classical, which also set up the NASA connection and promoted a new concert, this time with a worldwide audience. For the 2001 version of Mythodea, Vangelis expanded and reorchestrated the original composition. It was first recorded and then played live on-stage by: Vangelis on synthesizers and keyboards, the London Metropolitan Orchestra augmented by two harpists, sopranos Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman, the chorus of the Greek National Opera, and, for the concert only, the Seistron and Typana percussion ensembles. The concert was held in Athens, Greece on June 28, 2001, but the record was officially released only on October 23, 2001, to coincide with the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft entering the orbit of planet Mars. The CD, and later the DVD, achieved a number of sales accolades around the world.  First concert: 1993  The world premiere of Mythodia (original spelling) took place on July 13, 1993 as a public performance at the Herodes Atticus Theater, in Athens, Greece, for charity purposes. On stage were: Vangelis, who provided the full musical score accompanied by two harpists; mezzo-soprano Markella Hatziana, soprano Lucienne Deval, and the chorus and percussion of the Greek National Lyric Stage, conducted by Yvan Cassar. Mythodia was then a piece in seven movements. Vangelis not only composed the music, he also wrote the lyrics in Ancient Greek. In a 2001 interview with KLEMblad magazine, Vangelis stated, : \\"This piece was composed in an hour. Yes, it took me an hour. […] I'm not using the technology in the conventional way. I'm not using computers.\\" For the encore, Vangelis played a selection of his repertoire, including \\"La Petite Fille de la Mer\\" (from the album L'Apocalypse des Animaux), \\"Chariots of Fire\\", \\"Pulstar\\" (from the album Albedo 0.39), three tracks from the soundtrack of the film Conquest of Paradise (\\"Hispañola\\", \\"City of Isabel\\" and \\"Conquest of Paradise\\"), and finished with a performance of the Greek national anthem.  Second concert: 2001  Mythodea would remain unheard in public for the next eight years, but Vangelis kept a recording of the 1993 concert for himself. Around the year 2000, Peter Gelb was the head of Sony Classical and was steering the record company in the direction of crossover music rather than mainstream classical repertoire. He had just signed with Vangelis and was in the process of selecting their first release together. Gelb was listening to some tapes that Vangelis had sent to him when he came upon Mythodea. He described the event in an interview: \\"When I first heard Mythodea I was in ecstasy with its rhythm and power themes, and with no further hesitation I suggested it was recorded immediately.\\" With the approval of Vangelis to record Mythodea with a full orchestra as Gelb had suggested, Sony Classical developed a marketing plan of Mythodea that with the help of Vangelis' friend and colleague, Dr. Scott Bolton, grew to include a promotional tie-in with NASA, a dedicated website, an audio CD and a live concert that involved the Greek Government and was broadcast on TV and published on video. The deal with NASA made Mythodea the official music of the mission involving the spacecraft 2001 Mars Odyssey. This mission took the spacecraft to the orbit of Mars on October 23, 2001, and the audio CD of Mythodea was scheduled to be officially released on the same day. Vangelis described the connection he felt between the music and the mission on the 2001 Mars Odyssey official website: The premiere of the new version of Mythodea was held on June 28, 2001. By this date, the album had already been recorded and was finished. The concert was a live performance of the album, with everyone involved in the recording reprising their roles plus additional performers. The setting was the ancient (6th century BC) Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens, Greece, featured on the album and video covers. Vangelis commented on the selection of location in an interview: \\"The record company wanted to promote this work and asked me 'where [...]?' and I thought that [...] Greece was really appropriate. And at the same time I had a proposition from the Minister of Culture [...] and this is what happened.\\" The concert was filmed by a 20-person camera crew. It was broadcast on TV from November 2001, and it was released on DVD in 2002. The budget for the spectacle was set at US $7 million, split in half between the record company, Sony Classical, and the Greek government, which considered the concert a good promotion for Greece abroad and had it included in the Greek Cultural Olympiad leading to the 2004 Summer Olympics. There were some objections raised, mainly by fellow musician Mikis Theodorakis, over the use of both public money and an archaeological site. Vangelis himself, like in 1993, waived payment for his performance. The spectacle involved 224 musicians on stage: Vangelis, the 75-person London Metropolitan Orchestra augmented by two harpists, soprano artists Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman, the 123-person chorus of the Greek National Opera, and Greek percussion ensembles Seistron and Typana, that provided 24 timpani. Except for both percussion ensembles, all the other artists had participated in the recording of the album. In the back, a projection screen measuring in length and in height showed images of Mars supplied by NASA, combined with elements of ancient Greek mythology. The number of attending spectators to the ticket-paid event was between 2,000, 2,500, and 3,000 with another 30,000 people watching for free on a giant screen at the nearby Panathinaiko Stadium. The concert lasted just over one hour, after which three encores were played: Chariots of Fire, Conquest of Paradise, and a combination of Movements 9 and 10. Mars itself made a special appearance at the concert as an announcer told the spectators to look for an orange spot shining in the clear sky above the orchestra. The concert was repeated the following day without an audience, to get extra camera angles. Despite not having been announced, around 50 people who showed up at the venue were admitted for free, authorized by Vangelis himself. Mythodea was expected to be performed by other orchestras, without Vangelis' participation, but that had not happened.  Album  The album was recorded at the Athens Concert Hall (Athens Μέγαρο Μουσικής - Megaro Moussikis), chosen for its excellent acoustics. For the recording, Vangelis expanded the original composition of 1993 by adding two movements, extending two more and inserting some new cues throughout. The chorus parts were also touched upon, with lyrics and melodic changes. Except for Vangelis, none of the performers of the 1993 concert reprised their roles. Instead, Vangelis was accompanied by the London Metropolitan Orchestra augmented with two harpists, sopranos Kathleen Battle and Jessye Norman (both Sony Classical artists as well), and the Greek National Opera Choir and percussion ensemble. Vangelis asked musician Blake Neely to make the instrument transcriptions and conduct the orchestra as well. Although the album was finished by the date of the concert in June 2001, its release was held back until October 23, 2001 to coincide with the entry of the 2001 Mars Odyssey spacecraft in the orbit of Mars. A promotional CD-audio was nevertheless given to the press at the date of the concert and a CD-audio in a blue velvet box was given to guests of a private dinner that took place after the concert. In 2004, two of these boxes were auctioned off online for charity purposes, fetching a total of US $2,435. Vangelis noted that \\"it's really the music that manages to speak to all. In Mythodea, everyone can find something to identify with, because it's in this shared language\\". = Track listing = # \\"Introduction\\" – 2:43 # \\"Movement 1\\" – 5:41 # \\"Movement 2\\" – 5:39 # \\"Movement 3\\" – 5:51 # \\"Movement 4\\" – 13:42 # \\"Movement 5\\" – 6:35 # \\"Movement 6\\" – 6:27 # \\"Movement 7\\" – 4:58 # \\"Movement 8\\" – 3:07 # \\"Movement 9\\" – 5:00 # \\"Movement 10\\" – 3:03 Two CD-singles were also released, both featuring a track called \\"Mythodea Special Edit\\" (3:57) which combined parts of \\"Movement 9\\" and \\"Movement 1\\", plus either \\"Movement 1\\" or \\"Movement 7\\". They were not widely available, so their original purpose may have been purely promotional, as were specifically a number of other CD-single releases. There were variations on the track listing: some releases of the album carried alternative titles \\"Movement 1\\" through \\"Movement 11\\", and \\"Mythodea Special Edit\\" was sometimes included either as a bonus or as a hidden track. The audio CD is CD-Text- enhanced, with the following header appearing on compatible players: Mythodea - Music for the NASA Mission: 2001 Mars Odyssey - Kathleen Battle, Jessye Norman, Vangelis. Text for tracks appears like this one for track 4: Movement 3 / Vangelis - London Metropolitan Orchestra - Athens Opera Choir - K.Battle - J.Norman. = Sales and awards = The album reached #1 in the sales charts of Greece, where it attained platinum certification and was nominated for the 2002 \\"Arion\\" Greek music awards, in the category \\"Best instrumental music\\". In Portugal, the album reached #2 in the charts and attained silver certification for over 10,000 sales. The album reached #39 in Italy, #46 in Germany and #75 in Switzerland. At the Billboard Classical Albums chart peaked at #12 position, charting 22 weeks, while #4 position on Top Classical Albums chart. = Other appearances = A remixed version of \\"Movement 1\\" is included in the Vangelis compilation Odyssey: The Definitive Collection (2003). The opening march starts with less sound effects, instruments join in one by one more clearly, and an initial spoken countdown is absent. The same \\"Movement 1\\" was used as the title theme of reality TV series Der Maulwurf (lit. The Mole), which was broadcast by German station Pro7 in 2001. It was also used in the soundtracks of the trailers for the Hollywood films X-Men (2000) and The Scorpion King (2002). Finally, \\"Movement 9\\" is included in the compilation album Classic Kathleen Battle /A Portrait.  Video  A one-hour condensed edit of the concert was made available for broadcast by TV stations and later released on video, cutting the intervals and leaving just the first encore, for a total running time of 76 minutes. More significantly, the live playing and singing were replaced by the album version mixed with live applause, except the encore which retained the original full-live recording. The synchronization of the live performance with the album recording was achieved with a click track being played to the performers. The DVD-Video and VHS were released on February 17, 2002. The DVD featured PCM stereo and 5.1 Dolby Digital sound, 16:9 non-anamorphic image, and had as extras: artist biographies, \\"Making of Mythodea\\", music video, an introduction by NASA, and written notes by Vangelis. The DVD-video reached gold status in Portugal, for over 14,000 sales.

It was initially established in February 1925, based on a male church choir who sang in the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Cathedral in Poltava under the direction of Fedir (Khvedir) Popadych. The ensemble was disbanded in October 1934. History Poltava Bandurist Capella 1928 with Kyiv style banduras made in 1927 by Poltava bandura maker M. Domnenko. The Poltava Bandurist Capella 1930 with new diatonic Kharkiv style banduras designed by L. Haydamaka and made by bandura maker H. Palyivetz. Concert poster of Poltava Bandurist Capella under the artistic direction of Hnat Khotkevych from January 1930 New Kharkiv banduras made by H. Paliyivetz for the Poltava Capella in 1931 specially for the North American tour. Note the retuning and dampening mechanisms. Poltava Bandurist Capella 1933. Note use of Bass bandura = Initial set up = The Capella's first rehearsals as a bandurist ensemble were sponsored by the HubSelBud (Regional Village Housing organization). The formation of the Poltava Bandurist Capella was inspired by a visit to Poltava by the kobzar (itinerant Ukrainian bard) Ivan Kuchuhura Kucherenko who was also their first instructor. It was also inspired by a performance by the Kyiv Bandurist Capella which had performed in Poltava and also information in the press of the establishment of a bandura school and Bandurist Capella in Prague. Initially the members of the group played on borrowed instruments. One of the major problems of these instruments was trying to keep them in tune as many had wooden tuning pegs which were not reliable and were difficult to finely tune the instrument. Initially they performed part of their concerts without bandura accompaniment, sometimes accompanied by the piano. The only member of the Capella who had prior experience with the bandura was Danylo Pika who had taken some bandura lessons from Opanas Slastion. From 21 December 1926 until 1 October 1928, the ensemble was known as the \\"Bandura Studio of the Poltava Region Bureau of Political Education\\". Its first performance took place at the opening of the Taras Shevchenko monument in Poltava in 1926. =Professional status = After a successful performance in Odessa the eleven members of the Capella ordered new banduras and in 1927 received new semi-chromatic Kiev type instruments made by Poltava bandura maker M. Domnenko. In 1928, despite the amateur status of the Capella and the fact that they could only perform in their free time from work, the Capella had some 85 works in their repertoire which they accompanied by bandura and piano. The ensemble gave 249 concerts before 122,825 listeners performing in Poltava and regions, the Donbas, Odessa, Kharkiv, Kremenchuk, Romny, Kherson and Mykolayiv. = Studio under Hnat Khotkevych = On 1 October 1928, the Capella was chosen by the People's Commissariat for Education to work with bandura specialist Hnat Khotkevych to form a special experimental studio for the development of bandura technique and repertoire. The members switched over to diatonic Kharkiv instruments made by Poltava bandura maker - Hryhory Paliyevetz. The Capella had its name changed to the \\"Exemplary Bandura Studio of UKRFIL\\". The eleven members of the Studio were joined by a twelfth - Ivan Boretz in 1928, who came to study at the studio from the Kharkiv Bandurist Capella. The studio functioned for 18 months. Each week Volodymyr Kabachok would travel to Kharkiv from Poltava to pick up the weeks assignments from Khotkevych. Khotkevych would visit once a month to review the progress of the students. The technique of the members of the Capella grew considerably and the new repertoire composed and arranged by Hnat Khotkevych opened up new aspects of the bandura previously never explored. Over 20 new pieces were prepared. These included such works as the \\"Poem about Bayda\\", and the \\"Duma: Storm on the Black Sea\\". At the completion of the studio period with Hnat Khotkevych the group had a concert examination in Kharkiv at the Korolenko Library Auditorium on 22 January 1930, attended by musical dignitaries of Ukraine. After a successful performance the members began to work professionally as artists in a full-time capacity. After the performance the Capella was renamed \\"The State Exemplary Bandura Capella of the Ukrainian SSR\\". In 1930 concerts were planned with the Capella being accompanied by a symphonic orchestra. Khotkevych made preparations composing a number of works for the Capella with full symphonic accompaniment. The performance however did not take place. This period coincides with a growing period of anti-Ukrainian actions by the Soviet government. = Concert exploitation = In 1931, after a successful performances in Moscow, the ensemble was chosen to be the first artistic group from the Soviet Union to tour North America. In order to prepare for a tour of the United States the received new instruments with tuning mechanism and dampening mechanisms made by Hryhorij Paliyevetz. Despite a deposit of $15,000 being paid, the announced tour did not take place. Instead, the group was exploited by UkrFil (The Ukrainian Philharmonic concert organization) giving some 28 concerts a month. Most of the concerts seemed to take place in areas which had little interest in the bandura and bandura music. Severe restrictions were also place on the repertoire redirecting the group away from historic repertoire and focussing more on Soviet mass songs. For a brief time however, the ensemble became extremely popular and demonstrated the direction for further development of the bandura for many years to come. =Persecution= In 1932 Hnat Khotkevych fell out of favour with the authorities. His compositions and arrangements were removed from the list of allowed works for performance in Ukraine. The members of the Capella also came under considerable pressure, being repeatedly taken for questioning by the NKVD (the Soviet secret police). In January 1934 the artistic director, Volodymyr Kabachok, was arrested after a concert by the Capella in Kiev and did not return to the group. With his arrest most of the scores used by the Capella which included many original handwritten manuscripts composed and arranged by Hnat Khotkevych specifically for the group were confiscated. With Kabachok's arrest the directorship of the Capella fell to Danylo Pika, who was not as strong an administrator. After many months of not being paid (from January–October) the Capella was forced to disband in October 1934. In 1935 some of the members moved to Kiev and worked under the protection of the Dumka Chorus and its conductor - Nestor Horodyvenko. In March 1935 some of the members of the Poltava Bandurist Capella participated in the formation of a new larger Kiev Bandurist Capella under the direction of Mykola Mykhailov. Recordings Under the direction of Volodymyr Kabachok the Poltava Bandurist Capella recorded a number of records. In 1933 the following songs were released in editions of 2500 copies: * Pip ta Popadia - arr. by H. Khotkevych #2578 * Na horodi Verba riasna - arr. Demutsky #2582 * Horlytsia - #2379 * Oi ty ziron'ko vechirniaia - arr. Lysenko #2580 * Ohirochky - arr: Studnytsky #2581 * V misiatsi ilui vypala porosha arr. H. Khotkevych - #2583 These same recordings were re-issued in 1934 in 2000 copies. Legacy Despite its short history, the legacy of the Poltava Bandurist Capella is significant. It pioneered the Kharkiv style of playing the bandura within a bandurist capella which allowed the use of unique technical devices not possible on other instruments. The repertoire was symphonic in its concept and implementation. Refinements in instrument construction developed by members of the Capella can be seen in instruments being constructed today.

It was produced by Shaw Brothers (HK) Ltd. (Chinese: 邵氏兄弟（香港）公司), the largest Hong Kong movie production studio at the time. The script was written by Chiang Yang (江陽). Made in Hong Kong, it is one of many kung fu movies with Indonesian-born actor Lo Lieh (羅烈) in the lead. He appeared in many similar martial arts film efforts from the 1960s, pre-dating the more internationally successful Bruce Lee. Released in the United States by Warner Bros. in March 1973 as Five Fingers of Death, the film capitalized on the success of Warner's TV series Kung Fu and was responsible for beginning the North American kung fu film craze of the 1970s with over 30 similar films being released in the U.S. in 1973 alone. Warners followed it with the first U.S.-Chinese Kung Fu co-production Enter the Dragon released later that same year which was the most successful of the chopsocky films of 1973. Plot A promising young martial arts student named Chi-Hao has spent most of his life studying under a master and has fallen in love with the master's daughter Yin- Yin. After the master fails to properly fight off a group of thugs, he sends Chi-Hao to study under a superior master, Shen Chin-Pei. He instructs Chi-Hao to learn from Chin-Pei and defeat the local martial arts tyrant, Ming Dung- Shun, in an upcoming tournament in order to earn Yin-Yin's hand. Chi-Hao meets a young female singer, Yen Chu Hung, on the road to the city and rescues her from Dung-Shun's thugs. She falls in love with him, but he resists her advances with difficulty. He reaches town and begins studying under Suen Chin- Pei. After an initial beating by Chin-Pei's star pupil, Han Lung, Chi-Hao improves rapidly. One day, another thug of Dung-Shun's, Chen Lang, breaks into the school and beats all of Chin-Pei's students. Chin-Pei finally arrives and fights him, but is struck by a dishonorable blow and severely wounded. Chi-Hao tracks Chen Lang down and defeats him. When Chin-Pei hears of this, he selects Chi-Hao to receive his most deadly secret, the Iron Fist. Han Lung discovers that Chi-Hao has been chosen as Chin-Pei's successor and becomes intensely jealous. He conspires with Dung-Shun to have Chi-Hao crippled. He lures Chi- Hao into the forest, where Dung-Shun's three new Japanese thugs ambush him. They overpower him and break his hands. Later, they visit his old master's school and kill him as well. Yen helps Chi-Hao recuperate and again tries to woo him, but he resists her. Finally, Chi-Hao's fellow students locate him and encourage him to regain his fighting spirit. He begins training and soon overcomes his wounds. Yin-Yin arrives, but withholds the news of her father's death. A rejuvenated Chi-Hao successfully defeats all the other students to become Chin-Pei's representative for the upcoming tournament. Han Lung returns to Dung-Shun with the news, but Dung-Shun's son blinds him and casts him out. On the day of the tournament, a conscience-stricken Chen Lang warns Chi-Hao of the three Japanese thugs lying in ambush on the road to the arena. Chi-Hao fights the thugs killing two of them. Then Chen Lang arrives and holds off the head of the Japanese thugs so that Chi-Hao can get to the tournament on time. He arrives just in time and defeats Dung-Shun's son to win the tournament. Dung-Shun stabs and kills Chin-Pei in the midst of the celebration and departs. As Dung-Shun arrives back home, he discovers that all the lights are out. Han Lung appears in the darkened room and, guided by Yen's direction, fights Dung-Shun and his son. Han Lung blinds the son, who is then stabbed by his father in the confusion. Dung-Shun bursts out of the dark room and summons his minions who kill Han Lung and he himself kills Yen Chu Hung. Chi-Hao arrives at Dung Shun's house, but Dung-Shun flees and commits suicide by stabbing himself before Chi-Hao can fight him. As he leaves, the chief Japanese thug arrives with Chen Lang's head. He and Chi-Hao face off. Chi-Hao uses his Iron Fist power, causing his hands to glow red, and delivers several powerful blows that send the thug smashing into a brick wall.

Five Fingers of Death exceeded in worldwide rentals by October 1973, and went on to earn in North American rentals. =Critical reception= In a contemporary review for The New York Times, Roger Greenspun wrote, \\"I don't know much about karate, but I know what I like. And the karate in 'Five Fingers of Death,' for all its slow-motion high leaps, its grunts, its whooshing fists, has the look of the bottom of the barrel. It is all too extravagant, too gratuitously wild—as if composed for show, rather than for attack, defense or any real purpose.\\"Greenspun, Roger (March 22, 1973). \\"Film: '5 Fingers of Death'\\". The New York Times. 54. Variety called it \\"a Chinese actioner glossed with all the explosive trappings that make for a hit in its intended market ...

Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and called it \\"a shoddy, poorly dubbed melodrama stuffed with insane dialog,\\" though he acknowledged \\"the genuine excitement generated by the fight sequences, providing you can get excited at the sight of a karate chop that splits a forehead.\\"Siskel, Gene (April 20, 1973). \\"Mortal combat, East and West...\\" Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 3. Fredric Milstein wrote in the Los Angeles Times, \\"Director Chen Chang Ho, who has a definite sense of style, keeps the pace fast and the action spectacular ...

In a review for the Monthly Film Bulletin, John Gillett found that the trick effect in which characters leap into the air to land either in a tree or on the opposite side of an opponent become \\"somewhat tedious as the film progresses.\\" However, \\"...the sheer panache of the staging and apparent enjoyment of the participants keep the narrative moving swiftly\\". In a retrospective review, AllMovie gave the film three stars out of five, stating the film was \\"not the best Kung fu movie the Shaw Brothers put out, but as an early entry it holds up surprisingly well for a genre getting its legs.\\" The review noted that \\"a more unfortunate stereotype perpetuated by this and future films is the Japanese as primitive ape-like villains\\" and that the film \\"drags a bit on what are now tired Kung fu clichés, but the punchy spirit that made it popular still survives\\".

A NKVD document issued sentencing Kucherenko to death by firing squad. Death mask of I. Kucherenko done by Fedir Yemetz. Ivan Iovych Kuchuhura-Kucherenko (; July 7, 1878 - November 24, 1937) was a Ukrainian minstrel (kobzar) and one of the most influential kobzars of the early 20th century. For his artistry he was awarded the title \\"People's artist of Ukraine\\" in 1919 and later \\"People's Artist of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic\\" in 1926. Biography =Childhood= Ivan Kucherenko (or as he later became known, Kuchuhura-Kucherenko) was born on July 7, 1878 in the village of Murafa of Bohodukhiv uyezd in the Kharkov Governorate of the Russian Empire. At the age of 3, he became fully blind in his left eye and had some damage in his right eye. At the age of 8, he lost his father and became an orphan. The young Kucherenko had exceptional musical talent which directed him to the lifestyle of a kobzar. He was apprenticed to the kobzar Pavlo Hashchenko and began to perform as a kobzar at the turn of the 20th century. =Education and performances= In 1902, Kucherenko participated in the 12th Archeological Conference held in Kharkiv where he was the youngest participant - at age 24. The performance at the conference was organized by Hnat Khotkevych who noticed that the kobzar was exceptionally gifted artistically, and during the preparation of the concert, spent a considerable amount of time with him. This association with Khotkevych left a significant impression on Kucherenko as he was able to learn much from Khotkevych. Khotkevych wrote in his memoirs: In 1906, Kucherenko was performing at the market in Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipropetrovsk) and was heard by the renowned historian Dmytro Yavornytsky. Kucherenko's high artism left a deep impression on Yavornytsky. Yavornytsky wrote: He invited Kucherenko to his home and later sent him to Myrhorod to further master his bandura performance under the guidance of Opanas Slastion. For three months Kucherenko lived and studied at Slastion's house, whereupon he returned to Yekaterinoslav and thanked the professor for his fatherly guardianship. Kucherenko demonstrated his newly acquired artistic skills to the professor, who was extremely satisfied, and very moved. Yavornytsky organized a concert for the kobzar in Yekaterinoslav, which was a resounding success and helped elevate the popularity of Kucherenko as an exceptionally talented folk singer. In 1908, Kucherenko was invited to work as a teacher at the Mykola Lysenko's music school in Kiev. Here he worked for a period of 18 months. The work was difficult, and he was unable to continue it. He resumed his concertizing where he remained a master performer. Kucherenko was a virtuoso player of the bandura and had an exceptional baritone voice which left an excellent impression on the audience. Khotkevych noted: In 1913, Kucherenko traveled to Saint Petersburg on the invitation of T. Pryvalov, on the recommendation of Hnat Khotkevych where he had over 40 concerts, mainly at educational establishments. After Saint Petersburg, Kucherenko was invited to Moscow by the \\"Kobzar\\" Society where he also performed at ethnographic concerts and evenings organized by the society. In 1915, Kucherenko gave a highly successful concert at the Kharkiv Public Library. During the brief period of Ukrainian independence, Kucherenko toured Ukraine with concerts supporting the government of Symon Petliura whom he knew personally. For his activity in supporting the government he was awarded the title \\"People's Artist of Ukraine\\" by the then Ukrainian government. =Soviet period= During the Soviet period, Kucherenko was able to perform even more often. Initially the government supported many of these performances. In 1921, in the city of Bohodukhiv, a special concert was organized to celebrate his 25th anniversary of being a kobzar and he was one of the first artists to receive the prestigious title of People's Artist of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1926. After 1928 Kucherenko began to perform on the grave mound monument of Taras Shevchenko in Kaniv. In the 1930s it is known that he secretly became ordained as an orthodox priest in the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. Until recently Kucherenko's true date of death was not officially known. Soviet sources such as the Soviet Encyclopedia stated that he died in 1943 in Kharkiv during the German occupation. Recently, it has become known that Kucherenko was arrested and after a period of eight months of prolonged torture was finally shot by the NKVD in 1937. His body was buried in a mass grave on the territory of the KGB recreational facility in the area of Piatykhatky on the outskirts of Kharkiv. Repertoire Kucherenko's repertoire included six dumy (sung epic poems): # Oleksiy Popovych (probably from Khotkevych) # About the Poor Widow and her three sons # Captives lament (from Slastion) # Khmelnytsky and Barabash (from literary sources) # The death of Bohdan Khmelnytsky (from literary sources) # The death of the kozak-bandurist. (from Khotkevych) Many of the texts of these dumy he learned from books, and the accompaniment he composed himself or sometimes borrowing from other bandurists. His repertoire also included numerous songs of literary origin and songs which he composed himself. Khotkevych also noted that Kucherenko had lost much of his folk character in his renditions of Ukrainian folk songs. References * Колесса Ф..

It was released on October 26, 2002 and re-released on September 5, 2006 in Holiday Double Feature with its earlier episode The Toy that Saved Christmas. Like the other holiday episodes, it has no usual ”A Lesson in...” subtitle and the countertops. A message, however, is that you can't teach people to love through pomp and flash, but rather that love must come from the inside; Jesus was sent on Christmas to help enable such a change, and He is the true \\"Star of Christmas\\". The story of The Star of Christmas centers on two would-be operatic composers who are based on W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. VeggieTales has spoofed Gilbert and Sullivan's work in Lyle the Kindly Viking and (specifically The Mikado) in Sumo of the Opera. In this episode however they spoof the people, Gilbert and Sullivan, themselves. The film was nominated for an Annie Award in 2002 in the category of Outstanding Achievement in an Animated Home Video Production, but lost to Rolie Polie Olie: The Great Defender of Fun.https://www.awn.com/news/2002-annie-award-nominees  Synopsis  The episode is set in London in 1882. It begins with Cavis Appythart and Millward Phelps—jingle writers who decide to make their big break into musical theatre. While Millward is content to see their work featured on billboards and in newspapers, Cavis believes they can make a difference in crime-ridden London by staging a grand musical that will move the citizens to greater expressions of love. Their opportunity arises when Millward's Uncle Nezzer grants them the use of his theater on Christmas Eve. They plan the huge production of a new musical called \\"The Princess and the Plumber\\". Unfortunately, the script is not yet complete, and the premiere is only three days away. Seymour Schwenk, their friend and an inventor, shows up in an experimental rocket car and delivers a box of light bulbs to them. Cavis maintains that if their production is glitzy and bright then it will be a bigger hit and reach more people. He plans to integrate the lights directly into the scenery itself (and, soon, the costumes as well). However, they still have much work to do. They need to convince the city's premiere talent, Constance Effie Pickering, to star in the lead role, and they need to get a commitment from Prince Calvin Fredrick to attend the premier. While Cavis and his assistant Bob Winston work on Pickering and the Prince, Millward struggles to complete the script. Everything comes together, and Cavis starts feeling confident that their production will be a huge success. The Prince tells Pickering that her pipes are corroded they water can't drain and her toilet exploded, she's flushing in vain. After noticing a flyer for a Christmas pageant planned to debut on the same night at a local church, Cavis goes to investigate. He observes Edmund Gilbert preparing a low-budget children's play, and concludes that it poses no threat to their grand production. However, the pageant intends to feature an object called the \\"Star of Christmas\\". Wondering aloud about this as he leaves the church, Cavis is overheard by Arthur McHollingshead. Arthur, a historian, reveals that the Star of Christmas is an ancient relic that has not been seen by the public in 79 years. He rushes off with great excitement to report the news, which promptly makes the front page headline the following morning. Faced with the prospect of losing their audience (and in particular the Prince) to the pageant, Cavis vows to make their own production greater and flashier. But they cannot compete with the Star of Christmas, and in desperation Cavis and Millward go to the church to steal the Star. They are caught, however, and narrowly escape from the aged \\"Moyer the Destroyer\\" who was left to guard the relic. With the Star and the flashy lights, Cavis is certain that \\"The Princess and the Plumber\\" is now a guaranteed success. But during dress rehearsal, the excessive amount of lights ignite the curtains. In minutes the theater goes up in flames and with it the Star of Christmas. As they stand and rue this terrible turn of events, an officer named Dwiglight Howarde arrives with Moyer LaGumtree, and Cavis and Millward are arrested. In the jail, they meet a scallion prisoner, Charles Pincher, who laughs at their efforts to spread love by means of an elaborate stage production. He claims that real love does not expect fame or wealth in return, that real love makes sacrifices to help others without expectation of personal gain. That kind of love, he says, is extremely rare. Edmond and his father, Jesse, arrive at the jail to release Cavis and Millward. They have chosen not to press charges for the theft of the Star. Cavis is moved, and he expresses his desire to attend the pageant. But the pageant starts in ten minutes and there is not enough time to get there. Just then Seymour shows up in the rocket car. He entrusts Millward to drive the vehicle and try to get them all to the church on time. It is a harrowing ride fraught with collisions and near-misses, but they do arrive just as the pageant is about to start. The pageant goes on with the Prince and Miss Pickering in attendance. Cavis finally learns that Christmas is not about glitz and grand productions; he understands that it is about Jesus. After the play, Moyer shows up and says that the real Star of Christmas is actually safe, and that they had taken the Turtle of Damascus, which most people consider a hoax. The episode ends with Cavis and Millward taking cookies and a gift to Charles Pincher in his jail cell.  Production  The studio was on a tight schedule in early Christmas 2001 to get the film done. Then, the air condition was left on, and a heat wave never hit Big Idea. Most people slept in their offices trying to get The Star of Christmas finished. Towards the end/before it wrapped, Mike Nawrocki was said he would be on his Sunday drive around the time of New Year's Eve. They were at a cafe, the same cafe they used for the premiere of \\"Larryboy and the Rumor Weed\\". There was Lisa Vischer singing \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" during the \\"Star of Christmas\\" premier.

After his death in 2010 from a respiratory illness from which he had suffered since childhood, a series of guest astronomers hosted until 2011, when Dean Regas, James Albury, and Marlene Hidalgo became permanent co-hosts. In 2019, Dean Regas and James Albury stepped down from the program and were replaced by Trace Dominguez. On the weekly program, the host informs the viewer of significant astronomical events for the upcoming week, including key constellations, stars and planets, lunar eclipses and conjunctions, as well as historical and scientific information about these events. The program is available free to all Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) public television stations, educational institutions and astronomy clubs. A month of episodes can be recorded from a satellite feed which occurs approximately two weeks before the official broadcast dates.  History  The Pleiades In 1964, Jack Horkheimer started working at the Miami Space Transit Planetarium for the Miami Museum of Science after meeting the museum's president, Arthur Smith. By the early 1970s, he was appearing on news programs talking about astronomy. He was approached by Florida's PBS affiliate, WPBT, to do a series of half-hour programs about astronomy, titled Horkheimer's Heavens. Horkheimer agreed on the condition that WPBT help him create a series of 5-minute shows on stargazing. This was the beginning of Jack Horkheimer: Star Hustler. The show debuted on November 6, 1976 on Florida public television. From 1976 until 1985, the show was very studious, with Horkheimer being calm and speaking quietly like an educator rather than an entertainer. This changed in 1985 after the show's executive producer, Ed Waglin, told Horkheimer that he needed to appeal to a general audience, rather than to astronomers. In May 1985, the show went national, being broadcast on PBS stations around the United States with the enthusiastic Horkheimer that most people are familiar with. For the first two years of the national broadcast, Horkheimer hated the show and would not watch it, saying, \\"Well this is certainly different from any Jack Horkheimer that I know.\\" After that, Horkheimer realized that he was playing a character in order to generate enthusiasm for the show. The show started broadcasting in foreign markets in 1989. From its inception until 1997, the show was named Jack Horkheimer: Star Hustler. With the rise of the Internet, however, viewers let the show's producers and WPBT know that, instead of the program's Web site showing up at the top of search results, search engines were giving results for the Hustler adult magazine. As a result, the producers renamed the show Star Gazer to avert any confusion, accidental or purposeful. On August 20, 2010, Jack Horkheimer died. For more than a year after Horkheimer's death, the program continued to be produced under the title Jack Horkheimer: Star Gazer, using the same opening sequence featuring Jack Horkheimer's name and face. During that time, the program continued to use the same format with a series of guest hosts filling in for Horkheimer. The show's theme music from its debut in 1976 until October 2011 was Isao Tomita's electronic rendition of Claude Debussy's Arabesque No. 1, from Tomita's album Snowflakes Are Dancing. According to the former Star Gazer website, this is the most frequently asked question the producers receive. On October 3, 2011, the program's name was changed to Star Gazers. The show's new opening sequence featured a new logo and new theme music done in an alternative/progressive/space rock style (like Muse). With the name change, the program's format was also changed to include two, and later three, co-hosts who appeared together in each episode. A new Web site for the show was launched as well. The show still retains the old format of using green screens, and still ends with Horkeimer's closing phrase, \\"Keep Looking Up.\\" For the show's 40th anniversary episode (October 31 – November 6, 2016) Tomita's version of Debussy's Arabesque No. 1 was used once again briefly as the show's theme music. For more than four decades, the show's weekly episodes were produced in a five-minute length format. One-minute length versions of these episodes were also produced for public television stations which preferred that shorter format. Starting with the weekly episodes produced for the month of December 2019, South Florida PBS discontinued production in the five-minute length format in favor of the one- minute length format; and, the reason that was given for doing this was that the shorter one-minute length episodes would be more appealing for online viewing. During the month of December 2019, South Florida PBS introduced evergreen segments, which were produced in addition to the regular weekly episodes. The evergreen segment was essentially a new type of episode which differed from the regular weekly episode in more than one way. The subjects of the evergreen segments focused on astronomical phenomena; while, the subjects of regular weekly episodes focused more on time-sensitive information about current sky events. Evergreen segments were generally longer than the one- minute length of the regular weekly episodes; although, they were usually shorter than five minutes. Unlike the regular weekly episodes, the evergreen segments were not intended for broadcast during any particular calendar week and could therefore be broadcast at any time due to the fact that their subject matter lacked expiration dates. Generally, the format and appearance of the evergreen segments resembled that of the discontinued five-minute format of the regular weekly episodes.  Content  Finding Arcturus and Spica The show educates viewers about astronomical events for the coming week and about astronomy and astronomical history in general. Viewers learn about various constellations and how to find different stars. Horkheimer used catchy phrases to help viewers remember the procedures for locating astronomical bodies. \\"Arc to Arcturus, speed on to Spica\\", was a common phrase used to define the technique to find Arcturus and Spica using the handle of the Big Dipper. Following the arc of the handle will lead to Arcturus as shown in the diagram. Another method Horkheimer used to teach viewers about the stars was to tell stories about them. The Pleiades, also known as the seven sisters, was a constellation he would tell stories about. Stars with unique names, such as Zubenelgenubi and Zubeneschamali were also used in the shows to help inform the viewers. When astronomical events were in the news, Horkheimer would speak of them, giving viewers much more detailed information. When Comet Hale-Bopp arrived in 1997 and when Halley's comet was visible in 1986, he did shows about them. In 1997, specific shows were made when Mars Pathfinder landed on Mars and when the spacecraft Galileo orbited Jupiter, both of which were major headlines in the news. The show has many catchphrases that viewers associate with Jack Horkheimer. Horkheimer's appearances on the show are always marked with his opening line, \\"Greetings, greetings, fellow star gazers!\\" and his signature closing line, \\"Keep looking up!\\" These are the most widely recognizable quotes from the show but there were also others in common usage throughout the series. Horkheimer used \\"So get thee outside...\\" to encourage viewers to watch the stars. When describing the heavens he would often say \\"Let me show you.\\" When introducing a picture of the night sky, he would often say, \\"O.K., we've got our skies set up for...\\" and then add a date and time. Each Star Hustler episode began with the announcer, Big Wilson, reciting this poem as the host walked onto the set: After Big Wilson's death in 1989, Star Hustler continued to use Wilson's pre-recorded voice in the television program's introduction as a \\"living memorial\\" to the man, with Horkheimer announcing the week's episode title. This introduction would be replaced 1997 with the show's change to Star Gazer; from 1997 to 2011, each Star Gazer episode began with the announcer reciting the following poem:  Production  Halley's comet The show is produced in advance and one month of episodes is transmitted to PBS stations and others approximately two weeks prior to broadcast. The show is broadcast on over 200 PBS stations. It is also available on NASA's Central Operation of Resources for Educators, VOA TV and the Armed Forces Network. Individuals can download the show free from the official website, view the program on YouTube or watch the show's video podcast feed through most podcast providers. It was originally designed to air on PBS stations just before sign-off, but since many PBS stations now stay on the air continuously, the show usually airs around midnight local time or before a station or member network transitions to the overnight network schedule, and often again at the start of the broadcast day. Additionally, WPBT now provides a one-minute \\"capsule\\" version of each episode with a brief summary of the week's events. Episodes usually featured Horkheimer in front of a green screen, where he appeared to stand on top of a planetary ring on one side of the screen. Horkheimer then uses the screen to illustrate starfields and diagrams appropriate to his subject.  Hosts  Jack Horkheimer was the creator, writer, and original host of the series until his death on August 20, 2010. Horkheimer created the series in 1976 in cooperation with WPBT. He had been creating presentations for the Miami Space Transit Planetarium when he started the series. Horkheimer often appeared on news programs to host astronomical events. Jack Horkheimer's final broadcast was for the week of August 30 to September 5, 2010, and can be seen at . The show was his 1,708th episode and was titled, Celebrate Labor Day The Cosmic Way With A Giant Triangle Of Stars Overhead. The show was recorded approximately one month before Horkheimer's death. Chris Trigg, the Energy Officer at the Miami Science Museum, temporarily took over the position as special guest host while Horkheimer was ill. Horkheimer had previously written episodes for the entire month of September 2010. Trigg stepped in and taped the episodes for that month to keep the show running. His first episode was the show's 1,709th titled, \\"Mercury In The Morning And Jupiter At Night\\", and can be seen at . After Horkheimer's death, Trigg took over the position as host and recorded episodes for the months of October and November 2010. The episodes were written and produced by Bill Dishong. The episodes were uploaded to YouTube on September 22, 2010 and can be seen at the Miami Science Museum's channel here (). Jack Kelly announced in November 2010 that a national search for a new host would start in December 2010. Dean Regas was the first to try out and, in November 2010, filmed episodes for the month of December. Regas was given topics for future shows and asked to write scripts for the January shows of 2011. Regas went back in December and filmed the January episodes. Ed Romano, an amateur astronomer from Rhode Island, hosted the February 2011 episodes. James C. Albury, Coordinator of the Kika Silva Pla Planetarium at Santa Fe College in Gainesville, Florida, was the host for the month of April. Dean Regas returned as host for the months of March and May 2011. In June 2011, Albury and Regas were named as permanent co-hosts. The September 2011 episodes ended with the announcement that the program would be appearing in October 2011 with the new name, \\"Star Gazers\\" and the new website stargazersonline.org. Marlene Hidalgo joined the program as its first female co-host in October 2011. Hidalgo was a high school science teacher who had spent more than a decade teaching to students with disabilities. Hidalgo moved with her family to the northeastern United States after making her last appearance on the program, which was broadcast in March 2014. In 2019, South Florida PBS decided to try a different approach to producing the show. They wanted to shorten the regular weekly episodes to make them more appealing for online viewing. Before these changes were implemented, Albury and Regas continued to co-host the program until leaving the show following the recording of the episodes for November 2019. Trace Dominguez, an award-winning science communicator and educator, was named the permanent host; and, his first appearance on the show was in December 2019. Ata Sarajedini, Ph.D. of Florida Atlantic University was named as series consultant.  Episodes  There have been 44 seasons of Star Gazers and the show has produced more than 2,200 episodes as of February 2020. Horkheimer's last season was 2010 and he had hosted 1,708 broadcast episodes before his death.  Home Video Releases  In addition to the weekly televised episodes of Star Gazers, anthologies of selected episodes from the series were released on four home videos. The titles of these episode collections were as follows. =Jack Horkheimer: Star Hustler videos= *Space Oddities (12 episodes) *Tales of the Night Sky (12 episodes) =Jack Horkheimer: Star Gazer videos= *Video Almanac (16 episodes) *Make the Stars Your Own (15 episodes)  Awards and recognition  In 1994, Jack Horkheimer: Star Hustler won the Astronomical League's Outstanding Achievement Award. The award was mentioned in the closing credits of episodes released in 1995.

The school's mascot is the wizard. The school's colors are Purple and Silver Background MCHS allows high school students to take high school classes and college courses at the same time, also known as Dual Enrollment. It was only in the year 2003 that they had ninth graders participating in the program as part of the transition to the Early College model conceptualized by the Middle College National Consortium. Most students have the opportunity to earn credit and to complete from a year to even an AA Degree or an Honors AA Degree worth of college classes. Most students take 3 to 11 college units a semester. Students have educational plans that structure their learning so that they can complete their AA requirements at Santa Ana College, while completing their high school course work. College courses are free to all MCHS students because educational partners such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation offer grants to pay for the students' college tuition and textbooks. MCHS has a high school academic counselor and a full-time SAC academic counselor who help students plan their courses. The school is staff by 13 teachers who are responsible for teaching the core curricula and many electives; the students spend their day taking both college and high school classes along with participating in many extra- curricular activities Athletics Middle College High School has sports such as volleyball, soccer, football and basketball. Middle college also offers college sports in which students must be 18 years or older to participate. Most universities only check the high school and college grades for the student's sophomore and junior year. In order to take college courses while at MCHS, student's parents have to sign the CAPP form, a permission slip, saying that the parents agree to let the student take the course that was assigned. Students take college PE classes to fulfill their physical education classes. Such classes include yoga, dance (from ballet to hip hop), circuit training, track, swimming, aerobics, soccer, etc. Achievements Although the school is still growing, it has many achievements that are noteworthy: Honorable Mention as a CA Distinguished High School; growth in its API score; and a 100% pass rate on the CAHSEE for the last 7 consecutive years.
