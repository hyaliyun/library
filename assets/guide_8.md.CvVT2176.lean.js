It was typically used as a filling in Royal Navy armour-piercing shells during the early part of the 20th century.  History  Shellite originated after World War I as a development of lyddite (picric acid). During the war, lyddite-filled, armour-piercing shells had been found to be shock-sensitive, with a tendency to prematurely detonate upon impact rather than after penetrating the target's armour plate.Preston et al, p.83 Shellite was less sensitive, and also had the advantage of a low melting point, that allowed it to be easily melted and poured into shell casings during manufacture.Zukas et al, p.38 The first trials of shellite took place in 1921, when the British monitor experimentally fired different types of 15 inch shell at , point-blank range against the surrendered German ship SMS Baden. During World War II, Shellite continued to be used in naval shells. It was used in the British Disney bomb, a type of concrete-piercing bomb. Legacy Shellite-filled munitions may still be encountered in the wrecks of sunken warships. They are considered hazardous as, over time, picric acid will react to form crystals of metal picrates, such as iron picrate. These crystals are extremely shock sensitive and it is recommended that wrecks that contain shellite munitions not be disturbed in any way.Albright, p.78 The hazard may reduce when the shells become corroded enough to admit seawater as these materials are water-soluble.

Shannon published his acclaimed book entitled Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes in 2008 to educate beginning and intermediate day traders on the tools and techniques that have made him \\"one of the best indie traders in the business\\". The book received mixed reviews but ultimately was received well by novice day traders. In the book The Stocktwits Edge, Howard Lindzon wrote \\"it is not by accident that about one-third of the traders featured in this book point to Brian as a mentor who has had the biggest impact on their careers.\\" Shannon runs a swing and day trading service which is focused on: low risk, high probability trade ideas presented as daily educational videos and a chat room through his Alphatrends web site as well as live webinars. Shannon trades using multiple timeframes. He is known to have a weekly chart, a daily chart, a 30-minute timeframe, a 15-minute timeframe and a five-minute timeframe so he can see five time-frames at once. This allows Shannon to see the interplay of bigger trends with shorter-term timeframe trends. Background Shannon was born in Denver, Colorado though his parents lived in Aurora, Colorado at the time. They later moved to Andover, Massachusetts where he grew up. Shannon watched Louis Rukeyser on Wall $treet Week with his physician father as a child. He placed his first trade with money earned as a caddie and his newspaper route when he was 13 years old. He was living in Boston and car thefts were common so he bought shares of LoJack at $US 5.00 and watched the stock double over the next three months. Shannon went to High School at Austin Preparatory School where he graduated in 1986. He then went on to receive a Bachelor of Arts in Business Management from Merrimack College in 1991. Shannon has two sons, Matthew and Ryan, and currently resides in Denver, CO. Career After college Shannon worked for a penny stock company called Thomas James for a couple of months before taking a position as a stockbroker with Lehman Brothers in Boston, MA where he was first exposed to technical analysis. Even though his interest in the market was founded at an early age his real passion for this line of work began with the chart analysis he was exposed to at Lehman Brothers. He moved to Tucker Anthony in 1992. From 1994 to 1998 Shannon worked as a stockbroker for Dain Bosworth in Denver, CO. He spent a short period as a trader for Generic Trading, LLC in New York, NY before moving to Denver, CO to run Landmark Securities as a Series 24 Manager. From 1999 to 2006, Shannon was Lead Trader and the Director of Research at MarketWise Securities before creating Alphatrends in 2006. Over the course of his career he has held Series 7, 24, and 63 licenses however they were all expired by 2013. Later in 2013, Shannon passed the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam. He has been described as \\"one of the best indie traders in the business\\" Shannon is a trend trader that focuses on price of primarily NASDAQ stocks. Shannon is not influenced by the rumors or news surrounding a stock though he does pay attention to the volatility created by these events. Shannon also believes every trader must define the risk and reward of and trade before taking the position. In the 2013 E-book on THE BEST OF THE BEST by Brian Lund, Shannon's planning and analysis styles from StockTwits are quoted. Shannon appeared on the CNBC Halftime Report in 2014 with Scott Wapner discussing charts for Tesla Motors, Caesars Entertainment Corporation, overall market direction as well as his view on managing risk. =Trader education= Shannon began educating and mentoring people about technical analysis and trading techniques at MarketWise. Alphatrends was created by Shannon in 2006 where his active participation in financial education included blog posts as well as daily video updates. The blog was called the \\"YouTube of technical analysis\\" by the editor of Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities in describing Shannon's teaching and occasional reviews of the Wallstrip stock of the day picks. As of 2010, over 400 people subscribed to Shannon's trading service. Shannon's primary focus is on price action and he registered the domain www.onlypricepays.com after repeatedly referencing that phrase since 2005. Technical trading tools and indicators like the VWAP and moving averages are taught and talked about in Shannon's Alphatrends posts. Shannon does look at volume because it shows him \\"the collective psychology of the participants if they are fearful or overly optimistic\\" but advises traders to use price to position their exit rather than volume. His approach is focused on assisting people apply these to make decisions about market direction and risk management. Shannon asserts that \\"you must have a backup plan for every situation. And you must do this before you enter your every trade\\". An early user and skeptic of the StockTwits network, Shannon likes the ability to gain different perspectives on trades and the open honest atmosphere. =Mentoring= Shannon provides mentoring services for new traders looking to improve their performance in the markets. He likes to mentor people with \\"street smarts\\" that can anticipate their thought flow and actions. In the book The Stocktwits Edge Howard Lindzon wrote \\"it is not by accident that about one-third of the traders featured in this book point to Brian as a mentor who has had the biggest impact on their careers.\\" Many notable traders have considered Shannon one of their mentors. Trader and author Anne-Marie Baiynd counts Shannon as one of her mentors for teaching her about time frame analysis. Baiynd references Shannon in her 2011 book as having never \\"met anyone in the work world who is so willing to share knowledge and insight with aspiring trader\\". Retired Major League Baseball starting pitcher Todd Stottlemyre cites the mentorship of Shannon and Joe Donohue with his success. Multi-millionaire Hedge Fund trader and author Timothy Sykes also cites Shannon as a mentor. Book Technical Analysis Using Multiple Timeframes was published by Shannon in 2008. The book was written to assist traders new to technical analysis with intermediate level material such as market structure and trend alignment. Though the book has been referred to as a \\"textbook\\", it is not ‚Äú'dry', boring and difficult\\". The book is filled with advice and ‚Äúnifty‚Äù sayings to assist the reader's memory. Timothy Sykes called the book the \\"single most accurate/honest/understandable book on charting since Steve Nison‚Äôs classic: Japanese Candlestick Charts.\\" Alex Capel at Wall St Cheat Sheet called the book a \\"must-have\\" for new and intermediate traders and Howard Lindzon added it to his top ten trading books in 2008. Edward Dobson, the President of Traders Press Inc. also noted that Shannon's book \\"earns a place in my 'top 10 trading books ever written' list\\". Charles E. Kirk of The Kirk Report noted that while many traders struggle to explain their methods, Shannon broke down \\"relatively complex ideas\\" in a very \\"straightforward manner\\". The Market Technicians Association review of the book called it \\"readable and valuable\\" for both novices and experienced traders. The book works through concepts in sections starting with explanations of the accumulation, markup, distribution, and decline phases of the market cycle. Shannon then describes how he applies analysis of price, trends, support and resistance, moving averages, volume, and time frames to define his trading methodology. He discusses these indicators and the psychology surrounding the moves associated with them. After building the framework of analysis, Shannon describes the selection of long versus short strategies. Shannon focuses on price action but takes the time to detail his views on the interpretation of news and fundamental data into the price. In the final section, Shannon offers the reader valuable wisdom on risk management, exiting a trade, and defines his personal rules.

Renamed the Kirkwood House, it was the residence of Vice President Andrew Johnson; he took the oath of office of the President of the United States there in April 1865 after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Kirkwood House was razed in 1875 and replaced with the Shepherd Centennial Building, a seven- story office building in the Second Empire style (it opened in 1876). The upper floors were rented by the Pension Office from 1876 to 1885, as they apparently had to use multiple private office buildings until their new building, the Pension Bureau building was ready. The ground floor on the Pennsylvania Avenue. side was rented by the Palais Royal department store from 1877 to 1893. The Shepherd Centennial Building was converted into a hotel in 1893 by architect Leon E.

His research covered Indigenous communities in Central Australia in the 1920s and 1930s. From the 1950s he worked for the World Health Organization (WHO) and became a world expert on yaws and other tropical diseases in Africa and South East Asia. Biography Hackett was educated at Queen's School, North Adelaide and St Peter's College. He studied medicine at the University of Adelaide between 1922 and 1927. At the end of his first year he went on a university expedition to Central Australia. Hackett there met an Aboriginal woman with boomerang leg. After graduating he worked a year in a hospital in Adelaide. Between 1929 and 1930 Hackett studied at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He became lifelong friends with another South Australian working there, Neil Hamilton-Fairley. Hackett then worked for the Colonial Service in Shanghai in 1932 but had to return to Adelaide because of his bad health. In 1933 Hackett joined Norman Tindale on an expedition to the Mann and Musgrave ranges to study the Pitjantjatjara people. This involved spending two months on camels following tribal groups. Hackett later wrote \\"The experience of living among the hunter-gatherer Pitjantjatjara in conditions where they were the majority and privileged and we were the minority and under privileged, made a lasting impression on me. We were attracted to these cheerful good-natured folk who were so well adapted to their tough environment‚Ä¶..Their detailed knowledge of their country, their skills and intelligence soon gained our respect.\\"Adelaide University Graduates Union Monthly Newsletter, December 1978, pages 15-16 His journals of this and other expeditions are now in the South Australian Museum. After encountering another person suffering from boomerang leg, Hackett was determined to find out the cause of the deformation. He received a grant from Adelaide University and managed to determine that the condition was not caused by yaws, as had been suspected, rather it was a non-venereal treponemal infection. For his discovery he was awarded a Doctor of Medicine. In 1937 Hackett once more went to England, where he worked in the Anatomy department of Cambridge University. He then received a Senior Research Fellowship from the British Medical Research Council. This enabled Hackett to go to Uganda, where he researched the occurrence of yaws and syphilis. On his return he married Bessie Beattie Shaw (born South Africa 10 November 1912). Hamilton-Fairley and his wife Mary were their witnesses. Cecil and Beattie went on to have two sons and remained married until his death. In 1940 his research was finished and Hackett received a doctorate from Cambridge, however his paper Bone lesions of yaws in Uganda would not be published until much later, in 1951. With the start of World War II Hackett joined the RAF, serving in Sierra Leone, Egypt, India and Burma, mainly being concerned with the prevention of malaria. After the war ended Hackett returned to England where he became director of the Wellcome Museum of Anatomy and Pathology in London. In 1954 he joined the World Health Organization in Geneva, to become Medical Officer in the Venereal Diseases and Treponematoses Section. During the following ten years he helped organise yaws eradication programs in many countries in Africa, Asia and South America.BMJ, Obituaries, Volume 311 page 682 The success of these campaigns in reducing the global prevalence of yaws and other endemic treponematoses by 95% was credited as one of the greatest public health achievements in the history of the organization.WHO Yaws Fact Sheet no 316 Updated February 2014 (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs316/en) He retired in 1965 and returned to London where he continued his research on diverse topics. One of these was to determine whether the historical spread of disease could be charted by examining the bone lesions of dated human remains. This work, published in 1976, has been used frequently to suggest that syphilis entered Europe long before Columbus. Hackett died of Alzheimer's disease in London in April 1995.

The film stars Ravish Desai and Hasan Zaidi, and features the Bollywood movie debut of noted television actor Karan Kundra. The film was released on 13 September 2013. The plot revolves around a night spent by seven youngsters at a haunted hotel. The film received positive reviews but was declared \\"Average\\" at the box office. The film is based on the Stephen King short story 1408. Plot Vikrant Nerula enters the deserted Grandiose Hotel alone. He proceeds to room 3046, goes to the terrace and jumps off, killing himself. Seven friends, Sam (Samraat), Maghhesh, Achint, Neel, Neena, Sonia and Maggie, reunite in a local pub after several years apart to celebrate the farewell of Neel, who is going abroad. They learn about an abandoned hotel that is reportedly haunted. It had originally been a mental asylum for the criminally insane, but was almost completely destroyed in a fire. The origin of the fire has never been fully explained. After years of neglect, the ruins were refurbished into a five star hotel. The hotel was unsuccessful due to strange happenings that drove the owner to suicide. Rumors state that he was pushed into suicide by the ghost of an asylum inmate. All of them treat it seriously, except Maggie and Sam. They say that they wouldn't believe something they haven't seen. A worker at the bar says, that \\"...you would not be alive to believe once you see it\\". Sam suggests that the group explore the abandoned building. They try to enter the hotel from the main door, but cannot, so enter by the back door. Neena observes strange things, but Neel brushes her claims aside. They find a TV set on with no transmission or power. Both Achint and Neel hear the sounds, \\"WELCOME\\". Ignoring it as a hallucination, they proceed to room 3046, a notorious room. There, Sam is killed. The group flees in panic and comes to realize that they are trapped inside the hotel with no way out. Achint and Maghhesh go to the terrace to try and find a cellular connection. There, Maghhesh is killed by ghost spirits. The group starts being terrorized by a ghostly woman. Sonia is dragged into the darkness by the ghost. With three people dead, the remaining four find an abandoned jeep which they use to try to get out of the hotel, amid ghostly apparitions. After a tiring drive through misty areas, the group escape, only to find that they are back at the door of room 3046. They realize that the only way to escape is to survive until dawn. Soon they are confronted by Sonia, whom Achint and Neel think is the ghost, but a tearful Sonia tells them that it is really her. The group learns that, when the hotel was a mental asylum, a possessed girl named Maya (Sheetal Singh) was admitted after she murdered her entire family. Maya would always claim to have 'married the devil', and would become very violent at the hospital, even killing the doctors and causing the fire that broke out and killed all the inmates. The group realize that it is Maya who is terrorizing them. Sonia tries to contact Maya to find what she wants. She gets a call from Maya, saying that the spirit wants to kill them all, nothing else. The terrified group then discover that Sonia is actually dead and Maya is speaking through her. Neena asks the time from Neel, only to be told that it is the same time (3:55 AM) she had seen on the clock in one of the rooms shortly after entering the hotel. Believing it is some kind of intuition, they decide to go back to the same room to understand Neena's extrasensory perception. There they find a book containing paranormal explanations and a way to locate an energy source of dark spirits. With the help of incantations from the book, they have visions of the past. They see that the hotel was a mental asylum and find that the energy source of the dark spirit is in a shock machine. They decide to burn it down to end the horror. Neel and Maggie go to kitchen in search of something flammable. Maggie sees a female spirit sitting on chair and reading newspaper. When she reaches towards her, Neel again brushes her aside. Maggie is killed by Maya who appears in the form of Neel. Achint is beheaded by the spirit, leaving only Neel and Neena alive. Neel tries to burn the machine, but is pulled by the spirit into a closet. The spirit starts terrorizing Neena. Neena starts a fire. Amidst ghostly apparitions and obstructions, and with the help of the spirit of Vikrant Narula (who had died at the beginning of the film), she manages to burn the machine. This results in the destruction of Maya's spirit. The film ends with the entrance doors of the hotel opening at dawn and a traumatized Neena, the only survivor, walking outside.

He also remarked that he wanted to avoid casting \\"big stars\\" in the film, as he believed that they \\"cannot turn the audience fearful\\" in what he termed as a \\"hardcore horror film\\". Ravish Desai has commented that the movie will be the first in a franchise and that planning for further films has already begun. Bhatt had earlier made films in the same genre, namely - 1920, 1920: Evil Returns and Haunted. In an interview, he had commented, \\"While [my] Raaz 3 and 1920 were romantic sagas with songs and full-on drama, this one is more of a Hollywood kind of drama. The horror lies in the story.\\" Marketing The promo of the movie released at Tulip Star Hotel in Mumbai. At the event, the director-writer-producer unveiled both the look of the film and its cast.

The associated inn served as a meeting place for the first branch of the German Workers' Party (DAP), which later changed its name to the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Similar to the B√ºrgerbr√§ukeller, it was a place of pilgrimage for the Nazi movement. The building is now used as a residential and commercial building and is a registered monument on the Bavarian monument list.  Location  The Sterneckerbr√§u was located in Munich's old town in the Tal 38 (originally 54) on the corner of Sterneckerstra√üe, very close to the Isartor.  History  The present building originally covered three plots of land. In Jakob Sandtner's model of the city of Munich from 1570, three two-story houses can be seen. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the house at the corner of Tal and Sterneckergasse was owned by the beer brewer family Sternegger, after whom the road is named since 1696. A brewery had been there since 1557. In the 19th century, the corner house and its eastern neighbor were replaced by a four- story building with a classical facade. This was demolished in 1901, and in 1901/02, the present building was built on the site of these two buildings and an additional adjoining plot. The building was built by Heilmann & Littmann for the brewer Joseph H√∂cherl. The German Workers Party (DAP) of Anton Drexler met once a week in the restaurant on the first floor of the new building. On 12 September 1919, Adolf Hitler attended a meeting of the DAP on behalf of the intelligence command of the army. The meeting took place in a meeting room of the Sterneckerbr√§u. Drexler invited him to join the DAP. Hitler accepted on that date, becoming the party's 55th member. In October 1919, the first branch of the DAP, which in February 1920 changed its name to the Nazi Party (NSDAP), was set up in a side room of the Sterneckerbr√§u. In 1921, the Bavarian nationalist and royalist league In Treue fest was founded at the Sterneckerbr√§u. It was banned by the Nazis on 2 February 1933, and later re- established in 1952. On 8 November 1933, Hitler opened the Museum of the Nazi Party at the Sterneckerbr√§u, which was also mentioned in the Baedeker. The first inventory and office furniture, as well as the members' rooms, can still be viewed there. The building survived World War II. In 1957 the restaurant was closed and the first floor was converted into a store.  Building  The Sterneckerbr√§u building today The Sterneckerbr√§u is a five-story corner building with a gable roof. The facade of the building facing the Tal has seven windows, and the one facing Sterneckerstra√üe has five. The corner is chamfered from the third floor upwards, with windows in the corner. On the first floor, the building has five large arcade arches at the Tal which serve as showrooms today. The entrance door is between the two leftmost arches. The facade of the building's upper floors is irregular. On the front facade of the building, on the third floor, the third and fourth windows from the left are bay windows, while on the fourth and fifth floors only the fourth windows are bay windows. On the fifth floor, the second and sixth windows have loggias.  Notes   References  * Heinrich Habel, Johannes Hallinger, Timm Weski: Landeshauptstadt M√ºnchen.

Randlev. In Hans Skov (ed.), Aros and the world of the Vikings (pp. 86‚Äì91). Gylling, Denmak: Narayana Press. The location of the archaeological sites Randlev and Hesselbjerg in Denmark. Hesselbjerg cemetery The Hesselbjerg family farm came into the archaeological spotlight in 1962 when Viking-Age bronze jewelry was found in the field by metal detector hobbyists. The Moesg√•rd Museum, an archaeological and ethnographic museum from the city of Aarhus, took over and managed an extensive excavation between 1963 and 1970. This yielded more finds including three small iron amulets gathered in a ring: Thor's hammer, sickle, and a fire striker. Beyond the finds of these objects, a large Viking-Age cemetery, now called Hesselbjerg, was discovered on the farm. At that time, 48 Viking graves were uncovered, some of which contained extremely well-preserved skeletons. The cemetery itself is located on a narrow, sandy, and flat landscape approximately 300‚Äì400 meters long. These finds were taken to Moseg√•rd Museum and the excavation ceased in 1970 due to a lack of funding. With renewed financial support, excavation resumed in 1997 and by 1999 approximately 2300 square meters were uncovered; the number of graves onsite reached 104. Of the 104 graves, 79 were inhumation burials and 25 were cremation burials. This variation in burial styles is not unusual‚ÄîViking burial practices were quite diverse, though cremation was slightly more common than inhumation in Northern Jutland. Cremation graves usually consist of pits in which the burnt skeletal remains are found amidst the remainder of the funeral pyre. The inhumation graves at Hesselbjerg cemetery contained, in general, fairly well-preserved skeletons along with grave goods that varied in value and type according to the age, gender, and status of the deceased. In a few instances, traces of decayed coffins were found outlining the skeletons in the graves. The former burial site at Hesselbjerg, - post-excavation. The burial site is now considered the largest one of the time period, stretching from the year 800 A.D. until the middle of the 10th century. The finds from the excavation in the nineties included knives, iron belt buckles, whetstones, pottery, a key, another small Thor's hammer made of iron, and a piece of an Arabic coin. A single pit contained numerous glass and amber beads and an elaborately decorated bronze gilt belt buckle. The cemetery exhibits several characteristics that are slightly unusual for Viking Age burial locations. Over 80% of those interred in the cemetery were women‚Äîalthough it is common for more women than men to be buried in cemeteries, such a majority is rarely seen. Potential explanations for this phenomenon include the idea that many men from Randlev may have died while raiding or trading with other countries, or perhaps simply emigrated to other areas. In addition, only one child's burial was found; although children in the Viking Age were rarely buried in cemeteries, this particular child was treated as though it were fully grown and received grave goods similar to those found in adult graves. The average life-expectancy in the Viking Age was 39 years for men and 42 years for women. Most of those buried at Hesselbjerg cemetery were of the age group 35‚Äì55. The bones show signs that these people were hard-working laborers. Generally the dental health was poor; many skeletons were missing teeth or had multiple cavities. In 2009 and 2010, strontium analysis was applied to 18 skeletons from the cemetery. This process compares background radiation an individual was exposed to over the course of their lifetime stored in their bones and teeth to the known background radiation of specific areas. Based on this analysis, 11 of this sample were born and raised in Denmark. The others were clearly foreigners with at least three of them showing Swedish and Polish heritage. A former grave marker, moved from its original location in Hesselbjerg cemetery. One skeleton in particular was selected to be extensively scientifically analyzed and facially reconstructed for an exhibit at the Moesg√•rd Museum. The woman was determined to have died in the 10th century at approximately 42 years of age. Though the average height for Viking women was 1.58 meters, this woman measured only 1.5 meters tall. She showed signs of hard work and disease, which was not uncommon either in the Viking Age or in the skeletons excavated at Hesselbjerg. Signs of anemia in her skull were indicative of poor nutrition as a child. Damage to her spine was likely linked to her relatively advanced age, and, like most of the women in the cemetery, she had lost several of her lower molars. In her grave, several artifacts were found: an iron knife (a common grave good) and a bronze pendant inlaid with gold foil and 21 glass beads. Strontium isotope analyses of her bones revealed that, unlike several other women buried in the cemetery, she spent her entire life in Randlev, never traveling outside the immediate area. =Notable finds at Hesselbjerg= Significant finds from the settlement include crescent and ship shaped jewelry decorated with the motif of a clutching beast with four paws. There was also a sword-amulet and a Thor's hammer. Randlev settlement The discovery of the Viking Age settlement near the town of Randlev was prompted in part by the extensive excavations at Hesselbjerg in the preceding years. Viking settlements are difficult to locate, as the sites did not leave many traces in the form of potsherds, waste, or the organic material that was used to construct houses and outbuildings. Therefore, scanning the area near burial sites for metal finds is often an efficient way to pinpoint the locations of settlements. In 1999, support from the Best Eiler Foundation funded a larger excavation that lead to the discovery of the settlement a few hundred meters from the burial. Starting with the approximate location of the silver hoard that was found in 1932, the archaeologists from Moesg√•rd were able to survey the surrounding area with metal detectors to search for indications of Viking occupation. The detectors located jewelry, coins, and other silver, iron, and bronze artifacts from the Merovingian Period. Though Viking Age burial sites and settlements are found all around Scandinavia, rarely are they next to each other, as they are in this site. Separating the settlement and the cemetery is a ditch which may have at one time contained a small river acting as a boundary-marker. Significant to note is the fact that the burial site would not have been visible from the settlement, despite their close proximity the graves are positioned on the far side of the ridge, hiding them from sight. =Excavation and findings at Randlev= The Randlev settlement contained hundreds of metal objects, many of which were located with metal detectors prior to breaking ground on the site. Once these finds were documented and recovered, half of the topsoil was removed and the soil was scanned again with detectors. Removal of the remainder of the topsoil revealed traces of features that confirmed human settlement at the site.Jeppesen, Jens (October 2010). Smykker i stykker. Skalk, 5, 11‚Äì15. A total area of 1000 square meters of soil was cleared in the initial excavation of the settlement. Besides the aforementioned metal finds, features included three pit-houses and postholes, which are indicative of larger buildings such as longhouses. Some of the features date to the Early Iron Age, around 1000 years before Vikings inhabited the area. The discovery of rivets and foundry waste indicated that there had been some craft specialization at the site, with production taking place perhaps in the pithouses. In August 1999, expanded exploration with metal detectors led to the discovery of two house sites. The houses were typical of the Early Viking Age, exhibiting features that were common at the time: slightly curved walls, sturdy roof-bearing posts, and supportive wall-bracing posts. The post holes marking where the walls once stood show that the longhouses were both approximately 15 meters in length. These structures seem to have been constructed around the year 700. Given the proximity to the Romanesque church built in 1100, it is tempting to call these buildings a precursor to the surrounding present-day village of Randlev. =Silver hoards and other notable finds at Randlev= In 1932, the first of Randlev settlement's three silver hoards was discovered by a local farmer as he plowed his fields. Though the precise location of the find was not documented, the hoard is clearly connected to the settlement. It consists of 237 silver Arab coins, which had been wrapped in birch bark and buried in a clay vessel. Similar caches of Arabic coins, which provide compelling evidence for contact between Vikings and the Arabic world, have been found throughout Denmark at other sites. The coins found in the Randlev hoard were determined based on design to have originated specifically from modern-day Uzbekistan, Caucasus, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Iran. Other coins seem to have been imitations of these Arabic coins that were produced in Russia, likely because Arabic and Viking traders often met on Russia's Volga River. The youngest coin from the hoard dates from 910 B.C.E./11 A.D., during which time the Vikings traded often with the eastern Arab empire. Silver was valued by weight, and therefore many imported coins such as the ones discovered in the hoard would have been melted down or cut to alter their value. Cut coins and plate are considered hacksilver. The dates supplied by the coins aided in precise dating of both the site and cemetery. The subsequent discovery of six additional Arab coins in a recently excavated pithouse has led to speculation that the two coin finds are somehow connected. A second silver cache, considered to be unassociated with the first, was found approximately 25 meters to the west during the 1990s excavations. It contained jewelry, silver bars, hack silver, and approximately 20 coins, although the objects were somewhat scattered due to soil disturbance from farming activity. Nearby, a silver cup with a sturdy handle was discovered. It dates definitively to the Early Roman Iron Age; it was likely produced in the first or second century A.D. Goblets such as this were a luxury good in Denmark; they were among the first extravagant items to be imported to the north from the Roman Empire. The cup discovered at Randlev is unique, one of only a few ever discovered in Scandinavia. The third and final silver hoard was discovered with the use of a metal detector near the edge of a large pit. The silver was not found in the form of intact coins, but rather as ‚Äúhacksilver‚Äù‚Äîcoins that were cut in order to decrease their value and make exchange transactions more precise. In addition, the cache contained four cuttings of silver plate. Though likely used as a form of currency, the silver found in this pit could also have been intended for melting down and reworking. Though the silver hoards are the most highly concentrated collections of metal artifacts found at Randlev, many other jewelry, silver, and bronze objects were excavated. The scattered nature of the artifacts is attributed partially to repeated plowing of the topsoil. Over seventy jewelry fragments were found around the settlement; some whole articles of jewelry were pieced together with fragments found at different locations in the settlement. These silver hoards and jewelry finds are indicative of prosperity at Randlev. Contact with outside cultures is apparent, not only because of the Arabic coins, but also because of more mundane materials that were clearly imported. Soapstone and slate whetstones and vessels from Norway were found on the farm, along with quern-stones from the Rhineland. Randlev was clearly well-connected with the world outside Denmark, exhibiting remarkable prosperity and diversity of trade. Association with Hesselbjerg Though Randlev and Hesselbjerg stand only a few hundred meters apart from one another and date to the same time period, the definitive evidence of their association came from the discovery of a man's iron brooch found as a grave good in Hesselbjerg cemetery. The pin had been decorated with bronze balls, but one of the ornaments had been broken off along with part of the iron ring that constituted the main part of the pin. The owner continued to use the brooch until it was buried with him. The later excavations at the western edge of the Randlev settlement, approximately 400 meters from the grave, turned up a fragment that proved to be the missing iron ring from the pin. The pin is thought to be approximately 1000 years old. This find clearly demonstrated the linkage between the Randlev settlement where the pin originated and the graveyard where its owner was buried. This is the only known occurrence of a burial site and settlement being linked in such a way. Significance of Radlev and Hesselbjerg Randlev and Hesselbjerg are both special sites in the context of Viking Age archaeology. It is rare that two such sites‚Äîa settlement and a cemetery‚Äîcan be so definitively linked. The quality of the grave goods and the finds in the settlement, such as the elaborate jewelry and silver coin hoards, indicates that the area was likely one of some wealth. This affluence could have been due in part to the rich and fertile fields that were ideal for Viking Age agriculture.  References  *Jeppesen, Jens (October 2010). Smykker i stykker.

He trained as a sculptor at the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°sticas but moved into painting under Antonio Rodr√≠guez Luna. He returned to sculpture in the 1980s, experimenting with stainless steel, creating monumental works with it starting in the 1990s. In 1992, he founded the Symposium on Stainless Steel Sculpture in his hometown, the first of its kind in the work, which has since attracted participants from the Americas, Europe and Asia. Life Hern√°ndez Urb√°n with Abel Ram√≠rez √Åguilar and snow sculpture in France Hern√°ndez Urb√°n was born in Tultepec, State of Mexico, a formerly rural town, now part of the Greater Mexico City area. His interest in the arts appeared in early childhood, actively participating in musical and artistic events in his hometown and having a particular interest in classical music. In 1954, he entered the Escuela Nacional de Artes Pl√°stica, where he specialized in sculpture. His early formation was influenced by Mexican muralism movement with teachers such as Ignacio As√∫nsolo, Antonio Rodr√≠guez Luna and Luis Ortiz Monasterio as well as working as an assistant with David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jos√© Ch√°vez Morado. Along with sculpture, he also received training in painting, working in the studio of Rodr√≠guez Luna, sharing his apprenticeship with painters such as Javier Arevalo, Luis Nishizawa and Susana Campos . Later, he did graduate studies at the Academy of San Carlos and traveled to France on a grant from the French government in 1969. His work as an artist, especially his sculpture has taken him to various parts of the world. While in Thailand, the country experienced a coup d'√©tat, however, the artists was working in a small city far from the capital. Career Statue of La Tehuana - Zapotec Woman - By Miguel Hern√°ndez Urb√°n Hern√°ndez Urb√°n began his career working as an assistant instructor for sculptor Luis Ortiz Monasterio in 1959, then in 1960 he was appointed as technical consultant and university consultant at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico. He has had individual exhibitions of both painting and sculpture in art galleries, cultural centers and museums in Mexico and has participated in major collective shows in Mexico and abroad such as the Pintura contempor√°nea mexicana in Havana, Confrontaci√≥n 66 at the Palacio de Bellas Artes and Pintura, dibujo, grabado mexicano contempor√°neo in Oslo. His work can be found in the collections of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, UNAM, the Organismo Internacional de la Cultura and the Museo deArte Contempor√°neo in Morelia. From 1996 he has constructed monumental sculpture for locations in the Americas, Europe and Asia. These include a sculpture in Sokogla, Thailand (2005), works for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, a work to commemorate the 80th birthday and 60th anniversary of the reign of King Bhumibol Adulydesen of Thailand (2006), a stainless steel piece in France (2007), a black marble sculpture for the ITM University, Gwalior in Bhopal, India (2007), a stainless steel piece called Amantes for the city of Goyan, South Korea (2009) and monumental sculpture for his hometown (2009) . In 2008, he created a sculpture called La Tehuana, which is located at the main highway entrance to the city of Tehuantepec, Oaxaca. The theme of the piece is traditional, an image of a traditional Tehuana bride, which has been adopted as the symbol of an area where women play a dominant social role. However, it is a modern interpretation done in stainless steel, a style more common in the center and north of Mexico than in the south.} In 1992, Hern√°ndez Urb√°n founded the first Symposium on Stainless Steel Sculpture in Tultepec, the first of its kind in the world with the aim of promoting the material to artists, artisans and other interested parties. Since then, the event is held each year, during the weeks up until the National Pyrotechnic Festival. Participants create works and exchange ideas, using sheets of stainless steel and equipment provided by the municipality, the Mexican government and private businesses. The resulting works are exhibited in various venues in Mexico and the United States and a number have been sold to cities, institutions and businesses. The event has attracted participants from Germany, Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Bolivia, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Korea, Costa Rica, Croacia, Cuba, Ecuador, Egypt, Spain, the United States, France, Greece, Guatemala, the Netherlands, India, England, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg, Nepal, Peru, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, the Ukraine, Uruguay and Venezuela as well as Mexico. In addition to paintings and sculpture, Hern√°ndez Urb√°n has produced sets and costumes for the theater, and in 2007, he designed the Centro Cultural y Ecol√≥gico, which includes an international school of sculpture. In 2006 he organized the XV Symposium and Eighth World Meeting of Symposium Directors in America, Europe and Asia in San Luis Potos√≠ . The artist's recognitions include first prize at the concurso Nacional de Pintura in Mexico City in 1969 and the Sal√≥n Annual de Pintura e la Pl√°stica Mexicana. In 1987, he received the Presea Estado de M√©xico en Artes Pl√°sticas award. At the Museum of Modern Art (Centro Cultural Mexiquense) in Toluca in 2012, the artist was honored with a retrospective called Miguel Hern√°ndez Urb√°n, 50 a√±os de trabajo, 75 de vida\\" (50 years of work, 75 of life) . He is also a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Artistry During his career Hern√°ndez Urb√°n has produced oils, acrylics, tempera, engravings on wood and metal, drawings and sculptures. He has experimented with styles such as abstract art, stylized human figures, costumbrismo, surrealism, and figurative art. \\"The aesthetic value of a work of art is based essentially in its composition and outline, the creativity and personal tough that the artist knows how to stamp on his work.\\" As a painter, Francisco Moreno Capdevila commented that \\"the work of Miguel Hern√°ndez Urb√°n is an ascetic painting, bare of details, in which space is all. ‚ÄòOpen to the infinite, the eye is submerged and wanders in the empty space in which form sometimes appears to disappear, being reduced to almost nothing. He frequently conveys a strange sensation of unprotectedness and desolation in a vastness with neither orientation nor direction. On occasions, the space seems to be an act of original creation without trace or sign, where time seems to be suspended in a tremendous attitude of waiting.‚Äô\\" The artist himself stated that \\"The handling of light has been a constant in my work. I am not an artist who is concerned to fill the canvas bur rather place in it what is necessary.\\" From his early work mostly in painting he moved to print making then small and monumental sculpture. He is noted today for his monumental sculptures in stainless steel, which he began experimenting with in the 1980s, moving into monumental pieces of the material in the 1990s. Hern√°ndez Urb√°n considers the materials as a symbol of modernity and urban life, but also appropriate to Mexican art, especially that of the Mexico City metropolitan area because of its heavy industry. In addition, the material is light, easy to transport, resistant workable into various shapes in large format and as he states \\"refracts the light of the sun in different matrices and forms.\\" References External links * Artist's page Category:Mexican artists Category:1936 births Category:Living people ","title":"Miguel Hern√°ndez Urb√°n"},{"id":"40146040","text":"Amphimallon javeti is a species of beetle in the Melolonthinae subfamily that is endemic to Sicily.

Sjoman WorldCat identities (born July 6, 1944, Mission City) is known as author of the 1996 book The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace, which contains an English translation of the yoga section of Sritattvanidhi, a 19th-century treatise by the Maharaja of Mysore, Krishnaraja Wodeyar III (b. 1794 - d. 1868). This book contributes an original view on the history and development of the teaching traditions behind modern asanas. According to Sjoman, a majority of the tradition of teaching yoga as exercise, spread primarily through the teachings of B. K. S. Iyengar and his students, \\"appears to be distinct from the philosophical or textual tradition [of hatha yoga], and does not appear to have any basis as a [genuine] tradition as there is no textual support for the asanas taught and no lineage of teachers.\\"  Education  Sjoman studied at the University of British Columbia and Stockholm University before obtaining a PhD from the Centre of Advanced Studies in Sanskrit at Pune University, and a pandit degree from the Mysore Maharaja‚Äôs Mahapathasala. Sjoman spent 14 years in India studying four different shastras in Sanskrit, with several pandits. From 1970 to 1976 Sjoman studied yoga under B.K.S. Iyengar. The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace  Sjoman discovered the illustrations of yoga asanas, such as Setubandhasana, in the 19th century Sritattvanidhi in the Mysore Palace. In the mid 1980s, while doing research at the Mysore Palace, Sjoman made copies of the yoga section of the Sritattvanidhi, a \\"colossal\\" illustrated compendium, authored in the 19th century in Karnataka by the then Maharaja. The book included diagrams of 122 yoga asanas. Unlike the few other known historical yoga treatises, the emphasis was solely on the physical activity. Some appeared based on Indian wrestling and other gymnastic exercises, in that aspect more closely resembling modern yoga as exercise forms such as Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga. Both B. K. S. Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois, who are major influences on modern yoga forms, themselves studied under teacher Tirumalai Krishnamacharya at the Mysore Palace in the 1930s. Sjoman further researched Krishnamacharya, finding several writings in the palace library. Sjoman discovered that the royal family, in the early 1900s, had employed a British gymnast to train the young princes. So, when Krishnamacharya arrived in the 1920s to start a yoga school, his schoolroom was the former gymnasium complete with ropes. Sjoman argues that several exercises detailed in a purposely written western gymnastics manual were incorporated into Krishnamacharya's syllabus, resulting in his vinyasa style, and further passed on to Iyengar and Jois. The Yoga Tradition of the Mysore Palace was published in 1996 including the 122 asana illustrations and extracts from the gymnastics manual. Naturally, the radical, perhaps heretical, idea that some of the practice of modern yoga as exercise is based on something as mundane as British gymnastics caused a stir in the yoga world.

In 1927 the building was restored and opened as 'The New Picture House', and the first talking picture was shown in 1930\\" Theatre in Wales includes dramatic works in both the Welsh language and English language. Actors from Wales have also achieved international recognition. History Dylan Thomas Theatre, Swansea =Middle Ages= The earliest known performance tradition is that of the mumming custom Mari Lwyd. However, the existence of a Roman amphitheatre at Caerleon suggests that drama may well have been introduced during the classical period. Drama in Wales as a literary tradition dates to morality plays from north-east Wales in the second half of the 15th century. Two extant miracle plays Y tri Brenin o Gwlen (\\"The three kings from Cologne\\") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad (\\"The Passion and the Resurrection\\") represent short individual plays rather than being elements of a larger cycle. Ymddiddan y Corff a'r Enaid (\\"Conversation of the body and the soul\\") can be compared to the Everyman tradition. =Modern era= The development of Renaissance theatre in England did not have great influence in Wales, as the gentry found different forms of artistic patronage. One surviving example of Welsh literary drama is Troelus a Chresyd, an anonymous adaptation from poems by Henrysoun and Chaucer dating to around 1600. With no urban centres to compare to England to support regular stages, morality plays and interludes continued to circulate in inn-yard theatres and fairs, supplemented by visiting troupes performing English repertoire. Stock Welsh characters occur in theatre in England on the Tudor and Stuart stage. Fluellen is a fictional character in the play Henry V by William Shakespeare. Snatches of dialogue and words in Welsh appear in plays such as John Fletcher's The Night Walker, Thomas Middleton's A Chaste Maid in Cheapside, Northward Ho by Thomas Dekker and John Webster, Patient Grissel by Thomas Dekker, Henry Chettle, and William Haughton, The Valiant Welshman, and Ben Jonson's masque For the Honour of Wales. Twm o'r Nant (1739‚Äì1810) was famous for his anterliwtau (interludes), performed mainly around his native Denbighshire. The bawdiness and licensed foolery of the comic stereotypes of the interlude tradition have been compared to commedia dell'arte. However the religious revival connected with the rise of Methodism in Wales brought an end to such libertine satires. Interludes came to be replaced as expressions of public drama by a high-flown and imagistic preaching style and dialogues on moral issues such as temperance. The English classical repertoire was brought to those who could understand it by travelling troupes such as the Kemble family (Charles Kemble was born at Brecon in 1775). =Into the 20th century= In the late 19th century and early 20th century, Welsh literature began to reflect the way the Welsh language was increasingly becoming a political symbol. Secular drama began to attract interest in the 1870s as national consciousness grew. Plays in a Shakespearean style were written, such as Beriah Gwynfe Evans' patriotic play Owain Glynd≈µr, performed at the Llanberis Eisteddfod of 1879. There was institutional opposition to the new drama. The Methodist Convention in 1887 recommended that chapels regard theatrical activity as an immoral practice on a par with gambling. It was not until 1902 when David Lloyd George called for patronage of Welsh drama at the National Eisteddfod that drama started to be respectable among devout communities. With the advance of the English language, theatre in English developed quickly between 1875 and 1925. By 1912 Wales had 34 theatres and many halls licensed for dramatic performances. However, the arrival of sound cinema in the 1930s led to the closure or transformation of most theatres. A full theatre tradition only developed in Wales with 20th century Welsh drama. Many playwrights were inspired by the example of the Abbey Theatre, Dublin. Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden, used his patronage to attempt the foundation of a national theatre for Wales. Among his attempts was the foundation of a bilingual theatre at Plas Newydd, Llangollen in the 1930s. He also exercised his patronage in favour of playwrights including John Oswald Francis and Robert Griffith Berry. =Inter-war period= The inter-war period has been described as a golden age of amateur dramatics, with five hundred companies active all over Wales providing a second occupation for large numbers of quarrymen and miners. This flourishing tradition was curtailed by the outbreak of the Second World War and ended by the arrival of television in the 1950s. Saunders Lewis (1893‚Äì1985) was above all a dramatist. His earliest published play was Blodeuwedd (The woman of flowers) (1923‚Äì25, revised 1948). Other notable plays include Buchedd Garmon (The life of Germanus) (radio play, 1936) and several others after the war. Siwan (1956) together with Blodeuwedd are considered as the \\"canonical examples of Welsh language drama\\"Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones, Trasiedi Gymraeg: Is there a Classical Tradition in Welsh Language Drama? He also translated Samuel Beckett's En attendant Godot into Welsh. Emlyn Williams (1905‚Äì1987) became an overnight star with his thriller Night Must Fall (1935), in which he also played the lead role of a psychopathic murderer. The play was noted for its exploration of the killer's complex psychological state, a step forward for its genre. It was made into a film in 1937 and has been frequently revived. The Corn is Green (1938) was partly based on his own childhood in Wales. He starred as a Welsh schoolboy in the play's London premiere. The play came to Broadway in 1940 and was turned into a film. His autobiographical light comedy, The Druid's Rest was first performed at the St Martin's Theatre, London, in 1944. It saw the stage debut of Richard Burton whom Williams had spotted at an audition in Cardiff. =Post war= Professional theatre developed in Wales in the 1950s and 1960s. Under Milk Wood is a 1954 radio drama by Dylan Thomas, adapted later as a stage play. The play had its first reading on stage on 14 May 1953, in New York, at The Poetry Center at 92nd Street Y.Dylan Thomas: The Collected Letters edited by Paul Ferris. Macmillan 1985. Footnote by editor. Thomas himself read the parts of the First Voice and the Reverend Eli Jenkins. Almost as an afterthought, the performance was recorded on a single-microphone tape recording (the microphone was laid at front center on the stage floor) and later issued by the Caedmon company. It is the only known recorded performance of Under Milk Wood with Thomas in the cast. A studio recording, planned for 1954, was precluded by Thomas's death in November 1953.Green Man Review, \\"Dylan Thomas Unabridged: The Caedmon Collection\\" The BBC first broadcast Under Milk Wood, a new 'Play for Voices', on the Third Programme on 25 January 1954 (two months after Dylan's death), although several sections were omitted. The play was recorded with a distinguished, all-Welsh cast including Richard Burton as 'First Voice', with production by Douglas Cleverdon. The play won the Prix Italia award for radio drama that year. Prix Italia \\"PAST EDITIONS ‚Äî WINNERS 1949 - 2007\\" Cynan (Albert Evans-Jones) was influential in the field of Welsh drama. He wrote two full-length plays. Hywel Harris won the premier Eisteddfod prize for drama in 1931. He was commissioned to write an exemplary play for the National Eisteddfod in 1957; his offering Absolom Fy Mab was accepted to great critical acclaim in Welsh dramatic circles, as were his translations of two English language plays: John Masefield's Good Friday and Norman Nicholson's The Old Man of the Mountain. In 1931 he was appointed reader of Welsh plays on behalf of the Lord Chamberlain, a post which he held till the abolition of censorship in 1968. He was seen as a liberal censor, having allowed James Kitchener Davies' drama Cwm Glo, a play full of \\"filth and depravation\\", to be performed after it won the drama prize in the 1934 Eisteddfod. Wales has two national theatres: Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru (the Welsh language national theatre of Wales, founded 2003), and National Theatre Wales (the English language national theatre company of Wales, founded 2009). Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru attempts to shape a distinctive identity for drama in Welsh while also opening it up to outside linguistic and dramatic influences.

Synopsis A family of middle-aged children decides to clean out years of accumulated stuff from their elderly mother's residence‚Äîwithout her knowledge. So, one morning, they task (by bribing) her teenage granddaughter to take the cranky old lady out for the day. Upon returning in the early evening, and after the family shows her all the new household items and furniture, and how clean the place now is, retired school teacher Nan informs them all that she had stored 50 years of savings (from pension income, renting the basement apartment, what she had previously inherited, and, as she puts it, ‚Äúwhatever your Dad didn‚Äôt drink‚Äù) in her mattress ‚Äì which is now gone -- and that the sum amounts to almost a million euros. Stunned, the family launches an all-out search for the mattress, which was presumably hauled away to the dump. Complications arise, and hilarity ensues.

Founder The library began as the personal library of the founder, Ayatollah Marashi Najafi, a prominent Islamic scholar known for his dedication to religious scholarship and education throughout his life, who began collecting rare texts as a student, partly to keep them from being possessed by the British colonial authorities. Marashi Najafi died shortly after laying the foundation stone of a new library building in 1989. His will states: History and management Since Najafi's death, ownership and management of the library has since passed to his son, Mahmoud Marashi, who is instructed by his father's will. The library was founded in 1963, with further expansion in 1974 and 1988. It is situated one hundred yards from the Fatima Masumeh Shrine in Qom, where Marashi Najafi was a cleric, as well as being near his own tomb. The cost of the library was at first personally financed by its founder and his descendants; but, beginning in 1997, the library began to be funded as a governmental institution, under Resolution 205 of the Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution, with its operation still overseen by Marashi Najafi's family, but in cooperation with the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini once remarked that, \\"the library of Ayatollah Marashi Najafi is an unparalleled library and perhaps unrivaled in Iran\\". The library contains books in at least 30 different languages, including Turkish, Urdu, and Arabic. The possession, maintenance, and showcasing of Hebrew books once surprised some American and British rabbis, who were guests of the Iranian government, and who had allotted 3 hours of time to visit Qom. One rabbi said that he imagined that, Qom being the center of the revolution, Hebrew books would be burned and the ashes scattered to the wind; but he saw that, instead, such works were given the same respect as Muslim books, and that Jewish prophets were well regarded. So charmed were the rabbis that they devoted the entire time of their stay in Qom to visiting the library. Holdings *As of 2003, manuscripts, rare books, and lithographs amounted to 60,000 in number, including 31,000 volumes on manuscript basics, words, and ideas; logic and philosophy; theosophy and mysticism; and the Hadith; with 65% in Arabic, and the rest in Persian, Turkish, Urdu, and other languages. Among these volumes are unique texts of many famous Islamic authors. The most ancient of these treasures show the history of the Qur'an from the late 2nd and 3rd centuries A.H.; including the oldest two-component version of the Qur'an in Kufic script, of Ali bin Hilal, also known as Ibn Abolhasan Ali Ibn Hilal, as well as two volumes of interpretation; the Nahj al-Balagha of Sharif Razi; the Gospel in Latin; and copies of the Avesta. *There are more than 4,000 volumes of photographs of manuscripts, as well as 12,200 microfilms and lists of books of the 10th and 11th centuries‚Äîprinted in Arabic, English, Turkish, Latin, and Armenian‚Äîas well as more than 30,000 rare lithographs. *There are over 1,500,000 printed books in Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Urdu, and other non-Latin languages. This collection is housed on three floors of the new buildings. There is also an archival library of books of Communist and anti-Islamic groups. *The periodical section has more than 2,500 journals and newspapers in Persian, Arabic, Turkish, and Urdu, as well as a number of old magazines and newspapers, in lithograph, from the time of the Qajar dynasty. *Handwritten documents over the previous five centuries number 500,000 so far.

C. Friley (July 12, 1845 - April 11, 1911), was a Southern Baptist clergyman and college president. He was from 1892 to 1894 the first president of Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, and the second president from 1909 to 1910 of Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana. The two assignments were fifteen years apart. Background A native of Mississippi, municipality and county unknown. Friley was the son of John J. and Mary F. Friley (both born c. 1823). Friley fought as a teenager for the Confederate Army in the American Civil War. He graduated in 1871 from Baptist-affiliated Mississippi College in Clinton, as did two later Louisiana College presidents, Edgar Godbold and Rory Lee. Friley's first pastorate after receiving his degree was in Yazoo City, Mississippi, and Friley received high marks from the state mission board for his work there. Baptist career A clear outline of Friley's life is missing; He seems to have appeared at unlikely places in time across Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. He was a Baptist pastor in Monroe, Louisiana, and thereafter he was listed as the correspondence secretary at the Louisiana Baptist Convention. In November 1880, through a series of revivals, helped to establish the First Baptist Church in Opelousas in St. Landry Parish in South Louisiana. Friley was the founding president of the former Ruston College in Ruston, Louisiana, a forerunner institution to Louisiana Tech University, which lasted for seven years and had annual enrollments of about 250 students. Louisiana Tech was launched in 1894 as \\"Louisiana Polytechnic Institute\\", by which time Friley had arrived at and already left Hardin- Simmons. Because it is the first college built in Texas west of Fort Worth, Hardin-Simmons, then known as Simmons College, is often called a \\"true pioneer institution\\". While at Hardin-Simmons, he was half-owner of the denominational newspaper, West Texas Baptists, but he sold his interest even before he left Abilene. In 1899, he was a pastor in Mexia in Limestone County and was in the process of relocating to Rockwall in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Family and death Friley and his wife, the former Ellen Douglas (1855-1939), also a Mississippi native, had two children. Daughter Mittie K Friley Howell (1878-1962) was born in DeSoto Parish south of Shreveport in northwestern Louisiana. Their son, Charles Edwin Friley (1887-1958), also born in Louisiana, had a highly successful career in higher education. He attended Sam Houston Teachers College in Huntsville, Texas, Baylor University in Waco, Texas, and graduated from Texas A&M; University in College Station. Charles Friley received a Master of Science degree from Columbia University in New York City. At Texas A&M;, Friley was registrar from 1912 to 1924 and dean of arts and sciences from 1924 to 1932.

The wings of the C.XIV were straight edged and of constant chord, with the two bays formed by parallel pairs of interplane struts. The C.XIV was the first Albatros C type to include stagger. The upper wing, held well above the fuselage on a cabane, had a semicircular cut-out to improve the pilot's vision from the forward of two tandem, open cockpits. Ailerons, which increased in chord outwards behind the inner line of the trailing edge, were fitted to this wing. The C.XIV was powered by a Mercedes D.III, mounted with the upper parts of its six inline cylinders partly exposed. It had a tall exhaust which reached over the wing leading edge-mounted radiator. The tailplane was mounted at the bottom of the fuselage. The undercarriage was of the fixed type, with mainwheels on V-struts and a faired-in tailskid. It first flew in the spring of 1918 but did not go into production. Instead, it was modified into the larger but lighter C.XV which entered a production run ended by the Armistice with Germany.

Vimuttimagga The Vimuttimagga (Path to liberation, Ëß£ËÑ´ÈÅìË´ñ) is an early meditation manual by the arahant Upatissa preserved only in a sixth-century Chinese translation.

In the Patisambhidamagga, there are only 5 stages presented. The first three stages are the same and the last two are \\"fear & disadvantage\\" (bhaya & ƒÅdƒ´nava) and \\"wish for deliverance & equanimity towards formations\\" (mu√±citukamyatƒÅ & sa·πÖkhƒÅrupekkhƒÅ).Analayo, The Dynamics of TheravƒÅda Insight Meditation.

The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off. The young man's thighs and abdomen would be tied and others would pin him down on a table. The genitals would be sterilized with pepper water and then cut off. A tube would be then inserted into the urethra to allow urination during healing. Any facial hair such as the beard would fall off and the eunuch's voice would become like a girl's. The eunuchs served as slaves to the Vietnamese palace women in the harem like the consorts, concubines, maids, Queen, and Princesses, doing most of the work. The only man allowed in the Palace was the Emperor, the only others allowed were his women and the eunuchs since they were not able to have sexual relations with the women. The eunuchs were assigned to do work for the palace women like massaging and applying make up to the women and preparing them for sex with the Emperor. Several Malay envoys from the Malacca Sultanate were attacked and captured in 1469 by Annam (Vietnam) as they were returning to Malacca from China. The Vietnamese enslaved and castrated the young from among the captured.Tsai (1996), p. 15 Rost (1887), p. 252 Rost (1887), p. 252 A 1472 entry in the Ming Shilu reported that when some Chinese from Nanhai county escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military. The escapees also reported that they found out up to 100 Chinese men remained captives in Vietnam after they were caught and castrated by the Vietnamese after their ships were blown off course into Vietnam. The Chinese Ministry of Revenue responded by ordering Chinese civilians and soldiers to stop going abroad to foreign countries.„ÄäÊòéÂÆ™ÂÆóÂÆûÂΩï„ÄãÂç∑‰∏ÄÁôæÂÖ≠ÔºåÊàêÂåñÂÖ´Âπ¥‰∏ÉÊúàÁô∏‰∫• China's relations with Vietnam during this period were marked by the punishment of prisoners by castration.Tsai (1996), p. 16 Tsai (1996), p. 245 A 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that thirteen Chinese men from Wenchang including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from Hainan to Guangdong's Qin subprefecture (Qinzhou), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the Chenghua Emperor's rule (1447 - 1487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, Wu Rui (Âê≥Áëû) was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the Vietnamese imperial palace in ThƒÉng Long. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to Longzhou.

The present-day struggle of the Vietnamese female victims of \\"bride- brokers\\" can be summarized by the larger-than-life poem known as \\"The Tale of Kieu,\\" which narrates the story of a female protagonist of Vietnam who was purchased by foreigners and was violated, yet kept fighting back against her captors and offenders.

He died on January 14, 1978 from a heart attack at Kimbrough Army Hospital at Ft. Meade. Early Life and Schooling Bernard Ardisana was born on October 27, 1924 in Tampa, Florida. Immediately after completing high school in 1943, he enlisted in the U.S. Army Signal Corps where he took up the position of radio engineer. He only stayed in the military for three years before returning to civilian life and attending the University of Illinois, where he graduated in 1949 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics. In 1966, as an officer in the Air Force Reserve, he earned his Master of Arts degree in education from Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio, Texas. Between April and September 1961, Ardisana attended and then graduated from the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base. In 1972, he attended the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base. Career Ardisana worked for several U.S. military agencies including the Air Force, the NSA, and the Army Signal Corps. In March 1952 he was called to active duty to train at the Brooks Air Force Base as a student in traffic-analysis. Upon completion of his training in August he was transferred to Washington, DC to work as a language officer for the Armed Forces Security Agency. In 1956 he was transferred to Fort Meade where he developed new analysis techniques that are still in use today. In 1958 he was transferred to Zweibr√ºcken, Germany, where he developed an operations communications system still used by the cryptography community today. Between 1963 and 1965 he served as chief of the Operations Inspection team at Kelly Air Force Base, San Antonio, Texas. In 1966 he became head of the Operations Systems Evaluation and Management Branch at the U.S. Air Force Security Service Directorate of Operations. Between 1967 and 1970 he served in Vietnam as the under various positions before being sent to Frankfurt, Germany to act as assistant deputy chief of staff for operations for the European Security Region.

Bote Mountain was named because of a misunderstanding when, in the 1830s, Cherokee workers were asked which route a new road would follow. They pointed towards Bote Mountain and said \\"vote\\", which was interpreted by the white workers, who thought they were naming the mountain, as \\"bote\\". Hence, the mountain was named \\"Bote Mountain\\". The Bote Mountain Trail follows the crest of the mountain, and intersects the Appalachian Trail at Spence Field.Trail Map of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park , NPS.gov.

It was directed by Hugh Harman, and first released on July 18, 1931 as part of the Looney Tunes series from the Leon Schlesinger animation studio and distributed by Warner Brothers. The film score was composed by Frank Marsales. Plot The cartoon opens with the phone ringing loudly, while Bosko is sleeping. The anthropomorphic telephone can't get its owner to wake up no matter how insistently it rings, since he is a heavy sleeper. It then turns its attention to an anthropomorphic alarm clock sleeping nearby, snoring with a \\"tick tock\\" sound. So the phone wakes up the alarm clock, so it can wake Bosko up. The alarm clock also has trouble waking up Bosko. He does not respond to its own ringing with bell-like sounds, nor to it hitting a brush against the bedpan. The alarm clock finally pokes him in the bottom with one of its pointy hands, waking him up. He wakes up screaming.Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". Bosko goes to the phone, and answers a call from Honey. She invites Bosko to a picnic, and Bosko seems pleased with the idea. She asks him to hurry up, says goodbye and then hangs up the phone. Bosko quickly gets ready for the excursion. The phone says \\"Scram, Bosko, scram!\\".Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". Bosko goes to get his car. The garage looks like a big doghouse, and Bosko summons the resident. Out comes not a dog but a car with a personality of its own. He gets into the car and leaves. Several little cars, presumably children of the big one, follow them. He stops to tell them to go home. He then remarks \\"Ain't that cute\\"? Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". The car is driving itself, leaving Bosko with nothing to do during the ride. Then, Bosko gets a banjo and sings, until a string breaks. So Bosko takes a mouse's tail to use as a replacement. The mouse seems to serve as an ornament in the car. The mouse is pretty mad at Bosko for taking his tail. As soon as Bosko arrives at Honey's house, the banjo strings come off. He then tries again to pull the mouse's tail off, but the mouse pulls its tail away and sticks his tongue out at Bosko. It then leaves. Bosko again responds \\"Ain't that cute\\", and sticks his own tongue out.Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". Bosko arrives at Honey's house to get her for the picnic, and calls her from the house's front yard. She comes out to her balcony and says \\"Hello, Bosko\\". Honey's dog follows the car. The car tries to drive up a very steep hill and path, and consequently goes stuck. Bosko gets out and tries to push the car. The dog pulls Bosko's pants, which makes him let go of the car. The car consequently goes backwards and knocks Bosko out. The dog licks Bosko, he regains consciousness and replies with \\"Hey!\\". He is about to kick the dog, when the dog escapes.Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". Bosko gets the car moving, and the dog comes back and bites a tire. This act causes the air from the tire to be sucked out, into the dog. It inflates like a balloon. Bosko gets mad and sucks the air back to the tire. The unhappy dog leaves, but soon comes back. When the trio walk to the picnic location, they find a log. They put the picnic basket there and start conversing. Bosko whispers an ungentlemanly suggestion to Honey's ear, which causes her to stand up in a huff. Bosko resorts to tempting her with food. He eats a sandwich, chewing noisily with his mouth open, and says it tasted sure fine. She seems tempted. The dog licks Honey's bottom, but she thinks Bosko did it. She slaps him and leaves in anger. Bosko says \\"Aw, nuts\\" and the film ends.Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". Notes Johnny Murray serves as the voice of Bosko. Rochelle Hudson voices Honey. Both are uncredited. The film was directed by Hugh Harman and Rudolf Ising. They were also the producers of the film, with Leon Schlesinger as an associate producer. The film was animated by Friz Freleng and Paul Smith. The musical score was a work of Frank Marsales.Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". This is the first cartoon where the title card had Bosko's name in it, and almost all subsequent entries in the series followed this practice.Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". The film has a simple plot which serves as an excuse for a series of inventive gags. The action is otherwise unremarkable. The short marks a turning point in the Bosko film series and the Looney Tunes series in general. This is the first short where the plot does not revolve around singing and dancing. Singing-and-dancing plots were subsequently reserved for the Merrie Melodies series.Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". The voices of both Bosko and Honey while speaking on the phone sound childish. Rochelle Hudson was 15 years old when recording the film, while Johnny Murray's age is unknown.Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\". The first meeting of the lovers, with Honey in the balcony and Bosko on the grounds, is reminiscent of the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet (1597).Analysis of the film in the website \\"Likely Looney, Mostly Merrie\\".

She is popularly known by the titles Padishah Bibi and Padshah Begum. By birth, Shahar Banu was a princess of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur and was the daughter of Ali Adil Shah II and his consort Khurshida Khanum. She was also the sister of Sikandar Adil Shah, her father's successor and the last ruler of Bijapur (before it was annexed by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb). After she married Aurangzeb's son, she sent a letter to Bijapur Muslim chiefs to loot and plunder the infidels i.e. Hindus and other non Muslim's wealth at the behest of Aurangzeb. Family and lineage Shahar Banu Begum was born a princess of the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur and was the daughter of Ali Adil Shah II and his consort Khurshida Khanum. Shahar's paternal grandparents were Mohammed Adil Shah, her father's predecessor and his Queen consort Taj Jahan Begum. Shahar's siblings included her two brothers, the princes Hussain and Sikandar, the latter of whom succeeded her father as King in 1672 at the age of four. By all accounts, Shahar was greatly loved by the people of Bijapur as well as by her family. She was very beautiful as well as intelligent. To see the princess was a comfort and inspiration to the people of her father's kingdom. She was very graceful, charming, and her smile was reportedly, bewitching. The princess was courageous and devoted to her kingdom for she herself played a great part in her state's defense in 1679 when she was forcibly married for a political alliance. Marriage Ali Adil Shah died on 24 November 1672, and with him departed the glory of the Kingdom of Bijapur. He was succeeded by his infant son, the four-year-old Sikandar Adil Shah, a period of anarchy ensued which ended only with the extinction of the dynasty and the independence of the Kingdom in 1686. The weakness and humiliation of Bijapur during this period is illustrated by the defection of 10,000 Bijapuris to the rival Mughal camp and the compulsory submission of Sikandar's sister, Shahar, to the Mughal harem. The promise to hand over the princess to the Mughals was made by Sikandar's regent, Khawas Khan, who was later assassinated for his treachery by his successor Abdul Karim. A peace treaty between Bijapur and the Mughals was signed by the terms of which Princess Shahar was to be wed to the imperial prince, Muhammad Azam Shah, the eldest son and heir-apparent of the reigning Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and his consort Dilras Banu Begum. The idol of her family and the people of Bijapur, the princess left the city of her birth on 1 July 1679, amidst the wailings of her family and her dear ones to enter her future husband's hated seraglio for it was her willing sacrifice for the welfare of the Bijapuri state. She arrived at the Emperor's court on 4 March 1680 and was married to Muhammad Azam on 26 July 1681. The emperor tied the sehra and Qazi Sheikh-ul-lslam celebrated the marriage in the mosque of Khas & Am (Jama Masjid). In accordance with the example of the Prophet Muhammad (at his marriage with Khadija), the mehr was fixed at 500 dirhams. Role in Mughal-Bijapur relations Shortly after her marriage, Shahar was induced by her father-in-law, Aurangzeb, to help pacify the relations between the Mughals and Bijapur by addressing a letter to Sharza Khan, the new regent of her brother so as to dissuade him from throwing his weight in favour of an alliance with the Marathas and to join the Mughals with the common objective of crushing them. The princess, recently married to Prince Azam, complied and sent a personal appeal to Sharza Khan (18 July), saying, \\"Help the imperialists loyally for the good of the Bijapuri state. Conquer the infidels possessions.\\" But, no reply came. The Bijapuri grandees had entered into a secret alignment with the Maratha king Sambhaji and had strengthened him by a secret alliance.

Antiquarianism movement The interest for historical metrology began by the early antiquarianism movement in Europe during 16th -17th centuries, when studies of the measurement systems in various ancient cultures became common, e.g. De Mensuris et ponderibus Romanis et Graecis, published in 1533 by Georgius Agricola (1494‚Äì1555). From the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century a plethora of books, with the aims to collate and clarify the relationships between different measurement systems and compile systems used in ancient cultures as well as in modern time, were published. Research efforts Research efforts were later also used to investigate measurement system in certain cultures or countries. Here it is appropriate to mention Hultsch,Hultsch, Friedrich Otto.

History The company was founded in 2012, as the successor of long-running company TRUTH Group, which founded TRUTH FM, TODAY FM and U FM. A change in format to the stations of TRUTH Group also saw the need for a new company to take the stations to new levels of success. By mid- June 2012, TRUTH Group had phased out the TODAY FM brand, in a move to replace it with a new, more innovative brand, U FM, which targeted a slightly younger audience than its predecessor. In February 2013, the company's newest station, U FM, dubbed \\"the home of remix\\" was replaced with top 40 station, TODAY FM, as the current station was no longer reaching the success the company had hoped for. By 2013, Empire Media had become New Zealand's oldest Internet Corporate for internet radio stations and YouTube channels. In March 2014 for its formal name review, Empire Media was chosen over Empire Christian Group due to the companies changing structure.

Queensland (Australia). He was a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Early life Arthur Rutledge was the son of James and Lucy Ann (n√©e Field). He was born at Castlereagh near Penrith, New South Wales. He went with his parents to Drayton on the Darling Downs, Queensland (then in New South Wales) in 1851, returning to Sydney with them in 1855. He was the eldest child of the family. His brothers were Rev William Woolls Rutledge 1849‚Äì1921, Rev Dr David Dunlop Rutledge 1852‚Äì1905.and James Josiah Rutledge 1854‚Äì1946. His sisters were Maria Jane Rutledge 1845‚Äì1922 (married William John Newton), Susanna Wesley Rutledge 1847‚Äì1936 (married Pierre Claude Louat), Lucy Ann Rutledge 1858‚Äì1901 (married Dr Joseph Parker), Frances Margaret Rutledge 1861‚Äì1919 (married John Scott Connell and Rev Alfred Ernest Jones Ross). Rutledge entered the Wesleyan Church, being ordained a minister in 1865. His parishes in New South Wales were Tenterfield 1865‚Äì1868, Maitland 1868‚Äì1869, West Kempsey 1869‚Äì1872, Grafton 1872‚Äì1875 and, in Queensland, Fortitude Valley (Brisbane) 1875‚Äì1878. Arthur Rutledge was married in Surry Hills (Sydney) on 24 March 1869, to Mary Thomas Rabone who was born in 1848 in Vava'u, Tonga, the youngest daughter of the Wesleyan missionary Rev. Stephen Rabone. Political career Rutledge felt that his energy would be better served in a parliamentary seat than in a pulpit. To do that, he also needed the income as a barrister. In May 1878 he was admitted to the Queensland Bar. After unsuccessfully contesting the North Brisbane constituency he was elected with the Hon. James Robert Dickson, for Enoggera at the general election of 1878. Rutledge's political drive came from his desire to see all the British colonies on the Australian continent as one country. He believed the forced use of Pacific Island labourers on the plantations in North Queensland and the push for separation in the north would destroy Queensland's chance of joining in the federation of Australia. In his bid to win over the north he campaigned and won the seat of Kennedy in 1883. He was appointed Attorney-General in Sir Samuel Griffith's Ministry on 13 November 1883, and held that position until the Ministry resigned on 12 June 1888. Rutledge was elected for the Charters Towers district in 1888. He was one of the representatives of Queensland at the National Australasian Convention held in Sydney in 1891. At the convention he took part in the drafting of the Australian Constitution aboard the Queensland Government Steam Yacht Lucinda that Easter on the Hawkesbury River. In 1893 Rutledge attempted to return south from his seat of Charters Towers by contesting his previous seat of Enoggera but failed to win it. He then returned to the Bar as a barrister and Crown Prosecutor. By 1899 Queensland appeared to be very unlikely to join the Commonwealth and Rutledge felt he had to return to parliament to continue his fight for federation. On 18 March 1899 he won the seat of Maranoa. He again served as Attorney-General from December 1899 until September 1903. Rutland was made a knight bachelor on 15 August 1902, after the honour had been announced in the 1902 Coronation Honours list published on 26 June 1902. As part of his strategy to become Premier after the election of 1904, Rutledge decided to contest an electorate closer to Brisbane, and chose the semi-rural seat of Nundah which, he assumed, would be easily won by a man of his political experience, especially as it was already held by a fellow Ministerialist Thomas Bridges. Many large business houses backed him, as did the editor of the Brisbane Courier, the local newspaper whose editor was his son-in-law. His public meetings were packed with prominent religious and political leaders, in contrast to a low-key campaign run by Bridges based on his community service and a commitment to keep the cost of railway tickets low. Contrary to every prediction, Bridges won the election by 253 votes. This loss ended Rutledge's political career, and he accepted an appointment as district judge. He was formally Leader of the Opposition for two months from 28 June 1904. Later life and legacy Arthur and Mary Rutledge's children (who survived infancy) were Florence Mary Rutledge 1869‚Äì1939 (married Charles Brunsdon Fletcher, editor of the Brisbane Courier), Violet Rabone Rutledge 1873‚Äì1960 (married Rev Joseph Snell), Harold Moreton Rutledge 1876‚Äì1935, Ernest Richmond Rutledge 1878‚Äì1942, Olive Cowlishaw Rutledge 1880‚Äì1948 (married Arthur Crawshaw Wilcox), Clifton Garfield Rutledge 1882‚Äì1943 and Ivy Victoria Rutledge 1884‚Äì1950. Rutledge had a series of appointments as an Acting Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, the first of which was on 6 September 1904. On 22 March 1906 he was permanently appointed judge of District Courts while continuing periods on the Bench of the Supreme Court. He held these positions until his death in Manly, Sydney on 8 February 1917. He was survived by his second wife (Rose Ann Davy who he had married on 21 June 1910), his three sons, four daughters and twenty grandchildren. His funeral was held at the Albert Street Methodist Church in Brisbane and he was buried at Toowong Cemetery. On 3 March 2001, during the Centenary year of the Federation of Australia, Toowong Cemetery unveiled a memorial pavilion and wall to commemorate the lives of Rutledge and his three parliamentary colleagues who had participated in the 1891 Federation Convention in Sydney and are buried in the cemetery. The other members were Sir Samuel Walker Griffith, John Donaldson and Thomas Macdonald-Paterson.

Compte Rendu de la Societe de Biologie Paris 76: 768-771 The genus was named after Professor Maurice Caullery at the Laboratoire d‚ÄôEvolution des Etres Organises in Paris. There are five species currently recognised in this genus. The type species is Caulleryella aphiochaetae.  Description  The species in this genus are spread by the orofaecal route. They infect the epithelium of the gut. The sporozoites are elongate and attach to intestinal epithelium. The trophozoites are flask shaped and have the neck embedded in the host cell. During merogony the cell becomes spheroidal with peripheral nuclei. Cytokinesis occurs to yield a bouquet of merozoites attached at one end to a residuum. The gamonts are spheroidal. They pair and fuse A common wall forms around the juxtaposed gamonts forming a gametocyst within which the two gamonts are termed gametocytes. Each pair of gamocytes give rise to 16 isogametes. These in their turn pair and fuse to form 8 zygotes. The zygotes also undergo cytokinesis by a progression of cleavage furrows from one end. This leads to the formation of 8 sporozoites attached to a single polar residuum. These may infect other cells within the gut or form a cyst which is released from the gut.

Impala has been described as the open-source equivalent of Google F1, which inspired its development in 2012. Description Apache Impala is a query engine that runs on Apache Hadoop. The project was announced in October 2012 with a public beta test distribution and became generally available in May 2013. Impala brings scalable parallel database technology to Hadoop, enabling users to issue low- latency SQL queries to data stored in HDFS and Apache HBase without requiring data movement or transformation. Impala is integrated with Hadoop to use the same file and data formats, metadata, security and resource management frameworks used by MapReduce, Apache Hive, Apache Pig and other Hadoop software. Impala is promoted for analysts and data scientists to perform analytics on data stored in Hadoop via SQL or business intelligence tools. The result is that large-scale data processing (via MapReduce) and interactive queries can be done on the same system using the same data and metadata ‚Äì removing the need to migrate data sets into specialized systems and/or proprietary formats simply to perform analysis. Features include: *Supports HDFS and Apache HBase storage, *Reads Hadoop file formats, including text, LZO, SequenceFile, Avro, RCFile, and Parquet, *Supports Hadoop security (Kerberos authentication), *Fine-grained, role-based authorization with Apache Sentry, *Uses metadata, ODBC driver, and SQL syntax from Apache Hive. In early 2013, a column-oriented file format called Parquet was announced for architectures including Impala. In December 2013, Amazon Web Services announced support for Impala. In early 2014, MapR added support for Impala. In 2015, another format called Kudu was announced, which Cloudera proposed to donate to the Apache Software Foundation along with Impala. Impala graduated to an Apache Top-Level Project (TLP) on 28 November 2017.

Early years Helmer Molander was born in 1892, son of Jonas Molander and Anna Sofia √Ñs√©n. His father was a carpenter by profession. The household where Molander grew up was embedded into the nascent labour movement. His brother was a trade union activist. Helmer Molander began working at a saw mill as a teenager. He became active in the local Social Democratic Youth club.Svenskt biografiskt lexikon. Helmer Molander Politics When the Social Democratic Party was split in 1917, Molander sided with the left-wing. After a brief experience in local politics (he served as vice chairman of the S√§br√• municipal council 1920-1926), Molander was elected to Parliament and V√§sternorrland County Council as a candidate of the Communist Party. In 1924 he represented the Communist Party of Sweden at the Fourth World Congress of the Communist International. When the Communist Party split in 1924, Molander sided with Zeth H√∂glund's independent Communist Party. Molander was the sole member of the H√∂glund party in the Second Chamber of parliament. Soon H√∂glund's party would merge back into the Social Democratic Party. Between 1926 and 1941, Molander worked as ombudsman of the Social Democratic Party District of √Öngermanland. As a key organizer of the party in √Öngermanland, Molander's political work was characterized by sharp confrontations with the Communist Party and the Farmers' League. Following the deadly 1931 √Ödalen riots, the Social Democratic Party organized an investigatory commission consisting of Molander, Ivar Vennerstr√∂m and Georg Branting. In spite of his militant past, Molander appealed for calm after the killings.Johansson, Roger.

As a parliamentarian, he was engaged in issues like the abolition of the bicameral system and lowering the age of suffrage. In 1928 he was included into the national party board (where he remained until 1941). He served as chairman of the V√§sternorrland County Council between 1938 and 1940.Wik, Harald.

Its services include web hosting, virtual private servers, domain name registration and management, dedicated servers and a content delivery network. It provides services to individuals, small businesses, blue-chip enterprises and resellers, through a family of brands it has created or acquired, among them UK2.net, Resell.biz, Midphase, WestHost, Dotable, VI.Net, VPS.net and 100Tb.  History  1998-2010 The group‚Äôs first brand, UK2.Net, was launched in the UK by Danish entrepreneur Bo Bendtsen in October 1998 as a low-cost, no-frills provider of Internet domain names. By 2000 it had become the UK‚Äôs largest web hosting company, with an estimated 435,000 customers. Bendtsen retired from the company in 2002, but maintained a controlling stake. Following his departure, the company struggled to maintain its market position under chief executive Erik Anderson. Over the next three years, its customer base shrank by around 50%. In 2006 Anderson stepped down, and the group appointed Ditlev Bredahl as chief executive. The next three years were marked by a series of strategic acquisitions, within and outside the UK. By 2009, the group had successfully rebuilt its market reputation and returned to financial health. Staff numbers had grown from 30 to more than 200. In February that year, it was ranked the second-most reliable hosting company in the world by hosting market analyst Netcraft. UK2 Group continued to tighten operations in the wake of the Great Recession and, in May 2009, the company closed its overseas call centres, eliminating around 40 jobs in India and 35 in the Ukraine in favour of a smaller support team. At the same time, the group streamlined its executive management team. 2011‚ÄìPresent In April 2011, Lloyds Development Capital (LDC) - a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group - acquired a majority stake in UK2 Group for ¬£47 million (about US$77 million), as part of a management buyout. At this time Bredahl departed, to become CEO of another LDC-backed business, OnApp, and Phil Male, previously chief strategy officer at Cable and Wireless, joined as the new CEO. The group has expanded into new markets such as Latin America, and introduced a series of new brands and services in a bid to meet the growing demand for hosting and cloud computing services among business and individuals. By 2011, the group was ranked 45 on the list fastest-growing private technology companies in Britain, but in 2012, number 53. As of 2015, the group was planning to further expand its global data center capacity and consolidate its brands. In May 2017, LDC sold UK2 Group to online retailer The Hut Group. From July 17 2020 through to July 24 2020, UK2 suffered a major outage due to a loss of operational control by its Canadian contractor Tucows, resulting in the loss of access to emails for thousands of its UK users.  Brands and Acquisitions  In 2006, UK2 Group acquired UK domain name business Another.com. In 2007, it purchased the reseller business of US web hosting company Stargate, which it integrated and rebranded as Resell.biz. It also acquired Stargate‚Äôs shared hosting business, which was integrated and rebranded as US2.net. In 2007 it also purchased US shared hosting and VPS provider midPhase Services, including the company‚Äôs ANHosting.com and Autica.com brands. In 2008 it acquired ICANN-accredited domain registrar Naming Web, and US-based web-hosting brand WingSix from ServerCentral. It also acquired Australian community-focused web-hosting provider Dotable, US-based shared and dedicated hosting provider WestHost, including its data center in Salt Lake City, Utah, and UK-based dedicated and managed hosting company Virtual Internet. That year, it also created the 10TB.com brand, partnering with cloud provider SoftLayer Technologies to offer a global, high-bandwidth dedicated web-hosting service. As SoftLayer‚Äôs network capacity expanded, UK2 upgraded the service and in March 2010 relaunched it as 100TB.com to reflect the increased bandwidth. In 2010, the group launched another new brand, VPS.Net, to cater for the anticipated growth in demand for virtual private servers. In 2011, the group announced the launch of HostPuru - a hosting brand targeting the Latin American market and in 2012 it announced it was launching a virtual private network service, VPNHQ. Current list of brands in 2018 with reviews on each one is maintained on whtop.com.  Sponsorship and community initiatives  UK2 sponsored the Marussia F1 racing team in 2012. In November 2014, UK2 partnered with children‚Äôs charity Barnardo‚Äôs and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, to launch an initiative to teach troubled children to build and use Raspberry Pi computers.

Definitions and existence Let G = (V,E) be an undirected graph with n = V vertices. An orientation of G is an assignment of a direction to each edge of G, making it into a directed graph. It is an acyclic orientation if the resulting directed graph has no directed cycles. Every acyclically oriented graph has at least one source (a vertex with no incoming edges) and at least one sink (a vertex with no outgoing edges); it is a bipolar orientation if it has exactly one source and exactly one sink. In some situations, G may be given together with two designated vertices s and t; in this case, a bipolar orientation for s and t must have s as its unique source and t as its unique sink. An st-numbering of G (again, with two designated vertices s and t) is an assignment of the integers from 1 to n to the vertices of G, such that *each vertex is assigned a distinct number, *s is assigned the number 1, *t is assigned the number n, and *if a vertex v is assigned the number i with 1 < i < n, then at least one neighbor of v is assigned a smaller number than i and at least one neighbor of v is assigned a larger number than i. A graph has a bipolar orientation if and only if it has an st-numbering. For, if it has a bipolar orientation, then an st- numbering may be constructed by finding a topological ordering of the directed acyclic graph given by the orientation, and numbering each vertex by its position in the ordering. In the other direction, every st-numbering gives rise to a topological ordering, in which each edge of G is oriented from its lower-numbered endpoint to its higher-numbered endpoint. In a graph containing edge st, an orientation is bipolar if and only if it is acyclic and the orientation formed by reversing edge st is totally cyclic. A connected graph G, with designated vertices s and t, has a bipolar orientation and an st- numbering if and only if the graph formed from G by adding an edge from s to t is 2-vertex-connected. In one direction, if this graph is 2-vertex-connected, then a bipolar orientation may be obtained by consistently orienting each ear in an ear decomposition of the graph. In the other direction, if the graph is not 2-vertex-connected, then it has an articulation vertex v separating some biconnected component of G from s and t. If this component contains a vertex with a lower number than v, then the lowest-numbered vertex in the component cannot have a lower-numbered neighbor, and symmetrically if it contains a vertex with a higher number than v then the highest-numbered vertex in the component cannot have a higher-numbered neighbor. Applications to planarity formulated st-numberings as part of a planarity testing algorithm, and formulated bipolar orientations as part of an algorithm for constructing tessellation representations of planar graphs. A bipolar orientation of a planar graph results in an st-planar graph, a directed acyclic planar graph with one source and one sink. These graphs are of some importance in lattice theory as well as in graph drawing: the Hasse diagram of a two-dimensional lattice is necessarily st-planar, and every transitively reduced st-planar graph represents a two-dimensional lattice in this way. A directed acyclic graph G has an upward planar drawing if and only if G is a subgraph of an st- planar graph. Algorithms It is possible to find an st-numbering, and a bipolar orientation, of a given graph with designated vertices s and t, in linear time using depth-first search. The algorithm of uses a depth-first search that starts at vertex s and first traverses edge st. As in the depth- first-search based algorithm for testing whether a graph is biconnected, this algorithm defines pre(v), for a vertex v, to be the preorder number of v in the depth-first traversal, and low(v) to be the smallest preorder number that can be reached by following a single edge from a descendant of v in the depth- first search tree. Both of these numbers may be computed in linear time as part of the depth-first search. The given graph will be biconnected (and will have a bipolar orientation) if and only if t is the only child of s in the depth-first search tree and low(v) < pre(v) for all vertices v other than s. Once these numbers have been computed, Tarjan's algorithm performs a second traversal of the depth-first search tree, maintaining a number sign(v) for each vertex v and a linked list of vertices that will eventually list all vertices of the graph in the order given by an st-numbering. Initially, the list contains s and t, and sign(s) = ‚àí1\\\\. When each vertex v is first encountered by this second traversal, v is inserted into the list, either before or after its parent p(v) in the depth-first search tree according to whether sign(low(v)) is negative or positive respectively; then sign(p(v)) is set to ‚àísign(low(v)). As Tarjan shows, the vertex ordering resulting from this procedure gives an st-numbering of the given graph. Alternatively, efficient sequential and parallel algorithms may be based on ear decomposition. While the DFS-based algorithms above depend inherently on the special open ear decomposition caused by the underlying DFS-tree, the open ear decomposition here may be arbitrary. This more general approach is actually used by several applications, e.g. for computing (edge-)independent spanning trees. An open ear decomposition exists if and only if the graph formed from the given graph by adding an edge st is biconnected (the same condition as the existence of a bipolar orientation), and it can be found in linear time. An st-orientation (and thus also an st-numbering) may be obtained easily by directing each ear in a consistent direction, taking care that if there already exists a directed path connecting the same two endpoints among the edges of previous ears then the new ear must be oriented in the same direction. However, despite the simplicity of this folklore approach, obtaining a linear running time is more involved. Whenever an ear is added, the endpoints of this ear must be checked on reachability, or, equivalently for the st-numbering, which vertex comes first in the preliminary st-numbering before. This obstacle can be solved in worst-case constant time by using the (somewhat involved) order data structure, or by more direct methods. provide a complicated but localized search procedure for determining an appropriate orientation for each ear that (unlike the approach using depth-first search) is suitable for parallel computation. A modern and simple algorithm that computes st-numberings and -orientations in linear time is given in. The idea of this algorithm is to replace the order data structure by an easy numbering scheme, in which vertices carry intervals instead of st-numbers. report on algorithms for controlling the lengths of the directed paths in a bipolar orientation of a given graph, which in turn leads to some control over the width and height of certain types of graph drawing. The space of all orientations For 3-vertex-connected graphs, with designated vertices s and t, any two bipolar orientations may be connected to each other by a sequence of operations that reverse one edge at a time, at each step maintaining a bipolar orientation. More strongly, for planar 3-connected graphs, the set of bipolar orientations can be given the structure of a finite distributive lattice, with the edge- reversal operation corresponding to the covering relation of the lattice. For any graph with designated source and sink, the set of all bipolar orientations may be listed in polynomial time per orientation. st-edge-numberings and -orientations One may construct an ordering that is similar to st-numberings by numbering edges instead of vertices. This is equivalent to st-numbering the line graph of the input graph. Although constructing the line-graph explicitly would take quadratic time, linear-time algorithms for computing an st-edge- numbering and st-edge-orientation of a graph are known.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for the city of Barrie, Ontario. Background Flower-class corvettes like Barrie serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail- driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Ordered 1 February 1940 as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program, Barrie was laid down by Collingwood Shipyards Ltd. at Collingwood, Ontario on 4 April of that year. She was launched on 23 November 1940 and commissioned on the 12 May 1941. During her career Barrie had two significant refits. The first one began in September 1941 and which took two months to repair defects. The second one began in mid-March 1944 at Thompson Brothers in Liverpool, Nova Scotia where her fo'c'sle was extended. War service After commissioning Barrie was assigned to Sydney Force. On 3 September 1941 she departed to escort convoy SC 43 however she left the convoy early to head on to Belfast due to major defects. After completing repairs Barrie served as an ocean escort until May 1942. On 9 February 1942, she rescued 38 survivors from the British merchant ship , which had been torpedoed and sunk south east of Saint John's, Newfoundland by . In May 1942 she was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). She remained with the WLEF for the remainder of the war. In June 1943 she was assigned to escort group W-1. Barrie stayed with W-1 for much of the war except for a short period in 1944 where she was temporarily assigned to escort group W-8. Post war service Barrie was paid off on 26 June 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold to Argentine mercantile interests in 1947. She was renamed the Gasestado. In 1957 Gasestado was taken over by the Argentine Navy and renamed Capit√°n C√°nepa. She was used as a survey vessel until being broken up in 1972.

In 1890 he isolated Salmonella typhimurium. In 1893, he was involved in research into the flour moth, \\"scourge of the flour mill\\", Ephestia kuehniella. In 1898, he was working on rinderpest. In 1903, he worked on a way to control the vole plague in France. He was, in 1903, the first person to use radium to treat malignant diseases. He was contacted in 1905 regarding Australia's rabbit plagues and responding to the New South Wales government's offer of ¬£25,000 for a novel solution to the country's rabbit pest problem, he arrived in Australia the following year to advise on biological control measures. He brought a strain of Pasteurella bacteria which he had developed to selectively kill feral rabbits and conducted a series of trials on Broughton Island, New South Wales coast with his team. He left in May 1907 after a series of inconclusive trials, leaving his assistant A. Latapie with Dr. Tidswell of the NSW Health Department to continue trials. His organism was eventually proved to be identical to one already known to science, and although it was not found to be injurious to other animals, it was ineffective as a control. The Danysz phenomenon, where a toxin added to antitoxin in an equal amount at once is non-toxic but when added at intervals in a fraction results in a generally toxic mixture, was named for him.Debus, Allen G.

Rackmil (1906-1992) was the co-founder of Decca Records and head of Universal Pictures and Vice-Charman of MCA Inc. Early life and education Rackmil was born to a Jewish family on the Lower East Side of New York City and grew up in Brooklyn. He graduated from New York University with a degree in accounting. Career After school in the 1920s, he worked for the Brunswick Radio Corporation in Manhattan and later moved to its plant in Scranton, Pennsylvania where he served as general manager and controller. In 1932, he helped to start the Brunswick Radio Corporation. In 1934, he left Brunswick with two co-workers and co-founded Decca Records (along with Jack Kapp and Edward Lewis) in New York City, first serving as treasurer then as vice president in 1945, executive vice president in 1946, and president in 1949. Although many believed that radio would displace record sales, Rackmil bet on the opposite: that radio would spur record sales. He was correct and Decca, focusing on big name stars and 35 cent records with a top hit on each side, became the dominant company in popular music. His label featured Bing Crosby, Ella Fitzgerald, Glenn Miller, Guy Lombardo, The Dorsey Brothers, Duke Ellington, Count Basie, the Mills Brothers, Al Jolson, the Andrews Sisters, Woody Herman, Lawrence Welk, the McGuire Sisters, Teresa Brewer, Ethel Waters, and the Four Aces. In 1952, the federal government filed an antitrust suit against Decca Records, its overseas sister company Decca Records Company of London, and a third unrelated company, alleging that they had illegally colluded to divide up the international markets; later that year, under a consent decree, Decca Records agreed to desist from said activities. Thereafter, Rackmil entered the film industry in 1951 - which many believed was on the decline due to the advent of television - with Decca Records becoming the largest shareholder in the Universal Pictures Company; in 1952, he became its president. Applying the same strategy as he did with records, he shifted Universal's strategy from low budget productions with B-grade actors to big, lavish productions utilizing maximum star power, employing actors such as Cary Grant, James Stewart, Kirk Douglas, Doris Day, and Rock Hudson. He produced the films The Glenn Miller Story (1954), Pillow Talk (1959), Spartacus (1960), and That Touch of Mink (1962). In 1962, MCA Inc. purchased both Decca Records and Universal Pictures. Rackmil became vice-chairman of MCA's board and remained the head of both the film and record companies until his retirement in 1972. In 1962, Rackmil was awarded the \\"Motion Picture Pioneer of the Year\\" award by the Will Rogers Motion Picture Pioneers Foundation. Personal life Rackmil has been married four times: *In 192?, he married Marie Stevelman. They had one daughter, Marlene Rackmil Salkin (married to Decca executive Martin P. Salkin). They divorced shortly after Marlene's eighteenth birthday. *In 1959, he married American actress and singer Vivian Blaine; they divorced in 1961. *In 1963, he married Gladys Lenore Blum, the ex-wife of songwriter Fred Stryker; they divorced in 1973 (Gladys would later marry theater owner and producer Robert Nederlander).New York Times: \\"Gladys Nederlander, 83, Show Producer, Is Dead\\" by BRUCE WEBER July 22, 2008 *In 1975, he married Joan Crane.

The methodology of Roman prosopography involves defining a group for study‚Äîoften the social ranking called ordo in Latin, as of senators and equestrians‚Äîthen collecting and analyzing data. Literary sources provide evidence mainly for the ruling elite. Epigraphy and papyrology are sources that may also document ordinary people, who have been studied in groups such as imperial freedmen, lower-class families, and specific occupations such as wet nurses (nutrices).Susan Treggiari, Roman Social History (Routledge, 2002), n.p. In German scholarship, Friedrich M√ºnzer's many biographical articles for Realencyclop√§die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft took a prosopographical approach.Alexander, \\"Oratory, Rhetoric, and Politics,\\" p. 103.

Alexander, \\"Oratory, Rhetoric, and Politics in the Republic,\\" in A Companion to Roman Rhetoric, p. 102. Leading 20th-century scholars who wrote in English on the prosopography of the Roman Republic include T.R.S. Broughton, whose three-volume The Magistrates of the Roman Republic is a standard reference; Ronald Syme, whose Roman Revolution (1939) became the basis for later scholars' work on the late Republic and the transition to the Principate; T.P.

Other scholars, such as P.A. Brunt, have cautioned against an overreliance on prosopography, particularly the tendency to see court trials as \\"proxy wars\\" between political factions rather than as judicial proceedings in pursuit of just outcomes: even bitter enemies such as Cicero and Clodius Pulcher are recorded as testifying on behalf of the same party.Alexander, \\"Oratory, Rhetoric, and Politics,\\" pp. 102‚Äì103.

The film acts as the core for a transmedia project developed for various platforms. The world premiere was scheduled for 10 January 2014, taking place in Dublin. Plot The Large Hadron Collider research at CERN was on the verge of a breakthrough in regards to black holes. Scientists believed that they would be able to control the micro black holes once created but Peter Ansay, a young genius in quantum physics thought differently. His report brought up astounding conclusions that the current research on the radiation phenomenon was inaccurate and that if they were actually able to create these black holes, the level of radiation would be so significantly lower than anticipated that they would literally implode in on themselves, taking all surrounding matter with them. Depending on the exact level of radiation it could be catastrophic. Peter's report was rejected by CERN and his credibility as a scientist was destroyed. On 23 September 2012, Peter breaks into the CERN laboratories to gain access to the Collider and sabotage it preventing any future experiments. But something goes wrong in a way that Peter couldn't have predicted, and he is transported to 2018 by a wormhole to a world destroyed by natural disasters and at war with the Unknown. He wakes up in a strangely familiar place, convinced he's somehow been there before. He is now in the future, 2018, and \\"trapped\\" inside what seems to be a hotel. Outside, the atmosphere is unlivable and anyone who ventures out disappears in the shadows, taken by the Unknown. What Peter soon realises is that he is not alone. Five total strangers from different times and places are also in the hotel with him, but unlike him they know nothing about the future or how they got there. Peter keeps getting flashes of memory and a sense of d√©j√† vu linked to the future. If he's right then he has just 36 hours to figure out a way to get to CERN, reverse the wormhole and prevent the apocalypse because when the clock runs out so does Earth's existence.

Due to its popularity, it was moved to the prime time evening slot on Mondays beginning with the episode broadcast on 15 April 2013, where it has been airing (with slight time changes) ever since. In the programme, a team of interviewers go around various airports in Japan, with Narita International Airport as their main reporting hub, and ask non-Japanese arrivals \\"Why did you come to Japan?\\". They then attempt to follow the interviewees on their journeys around Japan, in a process called . A question posed for departees is, \\"What souvenir did you buy?\\" Besides interviewing people at airports, another skit tries to find non-English teaching foreigners in randomly chosen cities throughout Japan.

It is located in the town of Ulsteinvik on the western side of the island of Hareidlandet. It is the church for the Ulstein parish which is part of the S√∏re Sunnm√∏re prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of M√∏re. The white, wooden church was built in an octagonal style in 1849 by the architect Hans Nicolai Wraamann, the local parish priest. The church seats about 400 people. Originally, the church was built about north of Ulsteinvik, but in 1878 it was taken down and moved into Ulsteinvik. History Site of the first church in Ulsteinvik. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to 1432, but the medieval stone church was likely built in the 12th century. The church was originally located a little north of Ulsteinvik. The old medieval church was made of stone and whitewashed on the inside and outside, measuring approximately for the main hall of the church. Throughout the centuries the building was expanded and remodeled. In 1660, an extension of the building to the south and a new entrance to the north was constructed. Lightning struck the church tower on 30 October 1847 and the building (which already was in poor condition) was heavily damaged beyond repair. The church was completely demolished and a new church was built to the west to the old site. The new church was a timber- framed building that was built in an octagonal design. In 1878, the church building was disassembled and moved into the nearby town of Ulsteinvik to be closer to the main population centre of the parish.

He is also the past president of the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, was editor in chief of the journal Toxicological Reviews, and was a member of the board of directors of the American College of Medical Toxicology. Previously, most of Brent's research focused on the use of fomepizole as a treatment for both methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning, and he led a trial of this drug which resulted in the FDA approving it in December 1997. Currently, Dr. Brent serves as Director of the Toxicology Investigators Consortium, an NIH and FDA supported multi center research and surveillance group. Brent is also a senior editor of \\"Critical Care Toxicology: Diagnosis and Management of the Critically Poisoned Patient,\\" originally published in 2005, and now in its second edition, which was published in 2017. Education In 1970, Brent graduated from Hunter College with a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry, as well as a masters' degree in molecular biology. He completed his PhD in biochemistry at Mount Sinai School of Medicine and earned his MD from State University of New York at Buffalo's school of medicine. He also completed a fellowship at Denver Health Medical Center, a residency at Emory University and an internship at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Career He was initially appointed to the University of Colorado in 1987 as an instructor, and then was promoted to assistant professor, then associate, then full, and finally to distinguished professor. He has authored more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. He was the chair of the toxicology section of the American College of Emergency Physicians from 1991 to 1993. Brent has published many scientific studies, primarily in the area of medical toxicology. Brent was one of the U.S. government's experts in the autism omnibus hearing, in which he testified in support of the scientific consensus that thimerosal-containing vaccines do not cause autism, and specifically criticized a study by Holmes et al. which the plaintiffs had cited to argue that TCVs were dangerous to a specific subpopulation who were not as good at excreting mercury in hair. He also argued that chelation therapy is of no use as a treatment for autism, and that the signs and symptoms of autism are very different from those of ethylmercury poisoning. Testimony In the so-called autism omnibus trial, Brent testified on behalf of the government, i.e. that thimerosal does not cause autism. In particular, he criticized the concept of hypersensitivity to thimerosal as a concept that had been invoked as a way to bypass real science. He also testified that, with regard to the levels of mercury in the urine of Jordan King and William Mead, who had been chelated, that \\"You always expect to see levels in the urine bump post-chelation.\\" He also criticized the plaintiff's use of Doctor's Data Laboratories as relying on urine mercury levels rather than the gold standard, blood mercury levels. Brent has also voiced opposition to the use of chelation therapy as an autism treatment both in the omnibus trial, where he testified that \\"there was absolutely no reason to chelate them [the children who served as the test cases] for any mercury-related reason,\\" and in peer-reviewed journals.

The highway's southern terminus is at a T-intersection with State Route 83 north of Coshocton. Its northern terminus is at a T-intersection with the concurrency of State Route 93 north of Baltic. A section of the route is part of a scenic byway. The route was commissioned in the late 1930s. The northern terminus was relocated to a temporary end with Temporary SR 557, in late 1940s. The highway was paved during the 1950s and 1960s. In the late 1960s the highway's northern terminus was moved to its current location. Route description SR 643 begins at a T-intersection with SR 83 in rural Coshocton County. The highway heads northwest, before turning northeast. The road passes through farmland, with some woodlands and houses. The route enters New Bedford and has an intersection with SR 651\\\\. The highway leaves New Bedford and continues towards the northwest, before turning easterly. The road makes a sharp curve towards the north. After turning due north, the route has a T-intersection with SR 557\\\\. SR 557 heads west and SR 643 heads east from the T-intersection. SR 643 heads east-northeast, before its northern terminus at a T-intersection with SR 93. The highway between SR 651 and SR 557 is inclusive in the Amish Country Byway, an officially designated National Scenic Byway. The route is not included in the National Highway System. SR 557 has its lowest traffic counts; within the 2011 ODOT survey, the road is listed with an average annual daily traffic (AADT) of 830 vehicles on a section of highway between SR 651 and Holmes County line. ODOT figured that the peak traffic levels were present on the section that is between SR 557 and SR 93, where 1,350 vehicles used the highway daily. History SR 643 was commissioned in 1937, on most of the same route as today. The northern terminus of SR 643 was about south of the current intersection at SR 93. In 1949, the northern terminus was at Temporary SR 557, when Temporary SR 557 was commissioned. Between 1953 and 1955, SR 557 was paved, in Holmes County. The route in Coshocton County was paved between 1957 and 1961. The Temporary SR 557 was removed by 1969 and SR 643 was extended to the current intersection with SR 557\\\\. SR 643 replaced SR 557 from that intersection to SR 93. No significant changes have taken place to this state route since 1969.
