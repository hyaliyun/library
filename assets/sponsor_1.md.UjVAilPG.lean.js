Similar to the Suite Vollard completed in 2001 in Brazil, each floor is designed to rotate independently, resulting in a changing shape of the tower. Each floor is designed to rotate a maximum of per minute, or one full rotation in 180 minutes. It was proposed as the world's first prefabricated skyscraper with 40 factory-built modules for each floor. Fisher said that 90% of the tower could be built in a factory and shipped to the construction site. This would allow the entire building to be built more quickly. The core of the tower must be built at the construction site. Fisher said that the prefabricated portions would decrease the project's cost and the number of workers, and that construction will take 30% less time than a normal skyscraper of the same size. The majority of the workers would be in factories, working under safer conditions. Kitchen and bathroom fixtures would be pre-installed. The core would serve each floor with a special, patented connection for clean water, based on technology used to refuel airplanes in mid-flight. The entire tower is proposed to be powered from wind turbines and solar panels. Enough surplus electricity should be produced to power five other similar sized buildings in the vicinity. The turbines would be located between each of the rotating floors. Fisher said that they could generate up to 1,200,000 kilowatt-hours of energy each year. The solar panels are expected to cover the roof and the top of each floor. In 2008, Fisher said that he expected the skyscraper to be completed in 2010. In 2009, Fisher said construction would be complete in late 2011. Fisher did not \\"say where the tower would be built, [...] because he wanted to keep it a surprise.\\" Fisher acknowledges that he is not well known, has never built a skyscraper before and has not practiced architecture regularly in decades. As of , construction has not started, and there has been no official announcement of the building site.

Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re-establish them as Air National Guard units.Rosenfeld, Susan, and Gross, Charles J.

It was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and its mission was the air defense of the state. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the New Hampshire Air National Guard's official birth, concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. On 25 June 1950, the New Hampshire Air National Guard was federalized and placed on active duty. The 133d was federalized on 10 February 1951 and assigned to the federalized Maine ANG 101st Fighter-Interceptor Wing, although it initially remained stationed at Grenier AFB, mostly flying gunnery practice missions. Its mission was expanded to include the air defense of New England, although a majority of officers and a substantial number of airmen saw duty overseas in different theaters of operations including Korean combat missions. The squadron was then attached to the Air Defense Command 23d Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Presque Isle AFB, Maine, on 1 April 1951 with no change of mission. It was reassigned to the 4711th Defense Wing on 6 February 1952 at Presque Isle AFB. It was released from active duty and returned to the control of the State of New Hampshire on 1 November 1952. In 1960, the mission of the NH Air National Guard changed to air transport in time for their participation in the Berlin Crisis of 1961. This is also when they received their present 157th designation. In the mid-1960s, the 157th moved to Pease Air Force Base, from which they also began flying logistical support to U.S. troops in Vietnam. In 1974, the NH Air National Guard received its current mission as in-flight refuelers. Within hours of the September 11 attacks in 2001, the NH Air Guard began refueling the fighter jets that patrolled the airspace over major U.S. cities. The 157th was later deployed overseas in support of the War on Terror. The NH National Guard responded to Operation Iraqi Freedom in what was the largest call up of New Hampshire troops since World War II. Over half of New Hampshire's soldiers and airmen served overseas, conducting various security and infantry missions, providing medical care, building schools, and fostering international relations. The 157th refueled planes further forward in the conflict than at any other time in their history.https://www.nh.ngb.army.mil/history/historyhome After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit in New Hampshire were activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism.

The theory first came to prominence in the 1990s to early 2000s, but the theory receded once it became clear that the more likely explanation for the increase in scoring during that time was an increase in steroid use, as documented in the Mitchell Report in 2006. The juiced ball theory made a resurgence in the late 2010s, as a noticeable uptick in offensive output, especially home runs, was observed. 1990s to early 2000s According to the juiced ball theory, it was said that a \\"juiced\\" ball bounces off the bat at a higher speed. Johnny Oates observed hits being made off pitches that should not have been elevated. In 2000, Jim Sherwood, a professor at UMass Lowell, was hired to test the baseballs manufactured in the Rawlings facility in Costa Rica. The tests and regulations for MLB baseballs were described in detail. He said that he did not expect to find any change from the manufacturing process that had been used for the previous 16 years or more. Various baseball manufacturers in the United States also agreed that the theory is nonsense, as there are many quality checks in place. The stitchers interviewed did not even know what a juiced ball was. On the other hand, there is an argument that their livelihood depends on baseball sales, which may increase if the balls are juiced. Many pitchers felt that the balls became harder and traveled faster. Some pitchers performed their own tests. Kenny Rogers found that the ball in the center of each baseball was made of rubber, rather than the old cork. Billy Koch found that when dropped from the same height, the rubber balls from 2000 bounced higher than rubber balls from 1999. In 2000, Frank Deford, a writer for Sports Illustrated, interviewed Sandy Alderson, an MLB vice president, to discuss the possibility of a conspiracy by MLB to doctor the balls. Alderson denied this possibility, and Deford also discredited it as a conspiracy theory. Some players in the 2002 World Series complained that the balls were juiced after an 11-10 game. Alderson denied these allegations. The \\"Juiced Ball Theory\\" receded in popularity since the exposure of widespread use of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs by professional baseball players during the same period, providing a more likely explanation for the increased numbers of home runs. Late 2010s During the 2017 MLB season, a record-breaking 6,105 home runs were hit by the league, surpassing the record of 5,693 set in 2000, during the height of the steroid era. Beginning that season, several commentators pointed out the surge in home run rate and pointed to the 2015 All-Star Break as a likely beginning point for a change in baseball composition, if there was one. In an article for The Ringer in 2017, Ben Lindbergh and Mitchel Lichtman tested three dozen game-used balls and found evidence that in 2015 the balls became slightly bouncier, and in 2016, the balls became slightly smaller and with lower seams. New York Mets manager Terry Collins said, \\"The seams on the ball are definitely lower. I think that’s why everybody is having blister problems all of a sudden. And there’s no question that the ball is harder.\\" The following month San Francisco Giants pitcher Johnny Cueto stated that he strongly suspected that a \\"tighter\\" baseball was the cause of the first blisters in his career. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred repeatedly denied allegations that modern baseballs are \\"juiced\\" throughout 2017, maintaining that baseballs continue to be tested and fall within their designated measurable limits. In March 2018, research by FiveThirtyEights Rob Arthur found evidence of significant difference in the composition of the cores of baseballs produced after 2015 and before. Several months later, the MLB received the results of its own scientific study, looking into the increase in home run rate since 2015, and acknowledged that the increase was due, at least in part, to \\"a change in the aerodynamic properties of the baseball\\". The report suggested several steps to address the issue. Researchers Brian J. Love and Michael L. Burns, writing for The Conversation, identified other factors that could be contributing to the changing baseball composition, including lowering quality of cork supplied worldwide due to climate change, and new standards for humidity control for storing baseballs at MLB stadiums. In June of 2018 it was announced that MLB had teamed up with a private equity firm to purchase Rawlings, the longtime manufacturers of the baseballs used by MLB, for a reported $395 million. Regarding the decision to purchase Rawlings, Chris Marinak, the executive vice president for strategy, technology and innovation for MLB said, \\"We are particularly interested in providing even more input and direction on the production of the official ball of Major League Baseball, one of the most important on-field products to the play of our great game.\\" The purchase of Rawlings by MLB has fueled fan concerns over a possible conspiracy by MLB to boost the offense as a way to combat low attendance and TV ratings. In 2019, the juiced ball theory came to the forefront once again, as the league was on pace to hit 6,668 home runs as of the All-Star break, which would smash the 2017 record of 6,105.The actual end-of-season total was 6,776. The Triple-A- level minor leagues also saw a sharp increase in home runs, 58% over the previous year, after switching to the same ball used in the majors. Pitcher Emilio Pagan said, \\"To see the big league ball fly for the first time—it's pretty mind-blowing. Guys that had never seen it before, well, it's hard to put into words how much farther the big league ball goes, because it's spun tighter.\\" Shortly before the 2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Manfred acknowledged the difference in the balls, saying, \\"Our scientists that have been now studying the baseball more regularly have told us that this year the baseball has a little less drag. [...] We are trying to understand exactly why that happened and build out a manufacturing process that gives us a little more control over what's going on. But you have to remember that our baseball is a handmade product and there's gonna be variation year to year.\\" All-Star Game starting pitcher Justin Verlander said that the balls used in MLB games are \\"a fucking joke\\" and that he believes \\"100 percent\\" that the league has implemented juiced balls to increase offense.

His father was a bookbinder, a poor man who reportedly made many sacrifices so that his son might attend the Jesuit college at Blois; but after young Charpa few years he was compelled to leave and work to support himself. He chose to pursue the art of engraving, and entered the atelier of a copperplate engraver in Paris. He made a number of inventions related to this field, the first being a purely mechanical process for engraving in aquatint (gravure au lavis) and in colour. After making many prints using the technique, he sold the secret. An engraver and patron of art, the Comte de Caylus, was one of the first to use the new machine. Louis XVI gave him the appointment of \\"Royal Mechanician\\" (Mécanicien du Roi), and provided a studio for him in the gardens of the Louvre, where he used a burning-mirror for melting metals without fire. He invented a fire-engine which was very widely adopted and, in 1771, a machine for drilling metals. Another invention for mechanical engraving was one which enabled lace- manufacturers to engrave in a few hours elaborate patterns and designs which formerly had required at least six months work of the burin. Charpentier's device for lighthouse-illumination so pleased Louis XVI that he offered the inventor a pension and a place as the head of the Department of Beacons, asking him to fix the price for his discovery. Charpentier reportedly refused the pension and suggested that the office be given to a younger man, saying that he would \\"prefer freedom in order to devote himself to the development of his ideas\\". He received a thousand crowns for his discovery. During the period of the French Directory he made an instrument for boring six gun-barrels at once, and a machine to saw six boards simultaneously. For these the government paid him 24,000 francs and named him director of the Atelier de prefectionnement, established at the Hôtel Montmorency. Charpentier received many offers from Russia and England for his labour-saving devices, but refused them all. He died as he had lived, in poverty. His chief extant works of his, all prints, are: Education of the Virgin, after François Boucher; Death of Archimedes, after Ciro Ferri; Shepherdess, after Nicolaes Berchem; Descent from the Cross, in colour, after Vanloo. Charpentier was the father of the sculptor Julie Charpentier. References ;Attribution * Cites: **BRYAN, Dict. of Painters and Engravers (London, 1903).

Oguz tribes occupied a vast territory in Kazakhstan along the Irgiz, Yaik, Emba, and Uil rivers, the Aral Sea area, the Syr Darya valley, the foothills of the Karatau Mountains in Tien-Shan, and the Chui River valley (see map). The Oguz political association developed in the 9th and 10th centuries in the basin of the middle and lower course of the Syr Darya and adjoining the modern western Kazakhstan steppes.  Etymology  The etymology of the name \\"Oguz\\" is unclear. It was discussed many times in historical and philological literature. The term probably means \\"tribes\\", or the \\"tribal union\\", and then could turn into a collective ethnic name. The original Oguz areas were the south-eastern regions of Central Asia. The beginning of the early Oguz group formation is linked to the Western Zhetysu (often known, in Russian and other European languages, as Semirechye).  History = Early history = The first reference of the Oguz State is by the Arab geographer Yaqubi, who mentioned the Oghuz's wars against the Toquz Oghuz, Kimeks, and Karluks; another geographer, Ibn al-Faqih, reported that the Oghuzes along with the Kimeks and Toguz Oghuzes were the \\"kings\\" (malik), and were revered among the Turks.\\"Oghuz Djabgu state (9th - early 11th centuries)\\", Qazaqstan Tarihy In Zhetysu the old Oguz capital was Guziya. The Chinese sources dated to the 7th and 8th centuries mentioned Nine-Clans Uyghurs (九姓回鶻; Mandarin: Jiǔxìng Huíhú), reminiscent of the Tokuz Oguz confederation, consistently located in the vicinity of Issyk Kul – Talas,Zuev Yu.A., Horse Tamgas from Vassal Princedoms (Translation of Chinese composition \\"Tanghuyao\\" of 8th–10th centuries), Kazakh SSR Academy of Sciences, Alma-Ata, I960, p. 133 (In Russian) from the Issyk Kul area the center of the Oguz confederation shifted to the lower course of the Syr Darya under pressure of the refugees of the Sary Turgesh tribe.Bartold W.W., \\"Sketch of the Jeti-su history\\", Frunze, 1943, pp. 20–21\\"In the 8th century, Oguzes were already on Syr-darya outside of the ten arrows Türkic Kaganate (Western Turkic Kaganate)\\". Zuev Yu.A., Horse Tamgas from Vassal Princedoms, p. 134 However, Golden contended that the Toquz Oghuz, from whom emerged the Uyghurs, were not the same people as the Oghuz who founded the Oghuz Yabgu state in Transoxiana. In 766, after Karluks overran the Türgesh Khaganate in Zhetysu (southeastern modern Kazakhstan), Karluk tribes formed a Khanate centered there under the rule of a Yabgu, and they occupied and transferred their capital to Suyab. By that time the bulk of the Uch-Karluk (Three Karluks) confederation had left the Altai, and the supremacy in Zhetysu passed to the Karluk tribes. After the Oguz confederation lost a struggle with the Karluks for leadership in the Turgesh Kaganate, a significant part of Zhetysu Oguzes migrated to the Karatau Mountains foothills and the valley of the Chu River in the Issyk Kul basin. At the beginning of the 9th century the Oguz confederation, in alliance with Karluks and Kimaks destroyed the Kangar Union and captured the lower course of the Syr Darya river and the Aral steppes, displacing the Kangars and Pechenegs. The nomadic tribes of the Syr Darya Kangars were forced to join the Oguzes, and a part of them migrated to the west to the northern Black Sea region. The Oguzes moved their capital to Yangikent and became known as Oguz Yabgu State. The state was founded in Eni-Kent which was an Oguz yayla (summer village). Oguz il extended from \\"Issyk Kul and Almalyk, in the south, to Sairam, in the west, to the city of Yangikent, which stands at the mouth of the river Syr (Syr-darya), and to the Kara-Kum (desert)\\".Kononov A.N., Genealogy of Turkmens, Moskow-Leningrad, USSR Academy of Sciences, 1958, p. 81 (Кононов А.Н., Родословная туркмен. Сочинение Абу-л-гази, хана хивинского, Москва-Ленинград, АН СССР, 1958) (In Russian) The capital of the Oguz il was variously spelled Eni-Kent, Yangikent, Djanikand, Yenikent, Yanikand, all meaning New City, and also in Arabic literature al-Kariya al-Hadisa and in Persian literature Deh-i Hay; presently it is a Central Asian ghost town Jankent. The state was ruled by the leader of the Oguz Turks with the title Yabgu, which is similar to other Turkic ruling titles such as Khan and Kagan/Hakan, but initially with a status below Khagan. The army was commanded by Subaşı, \\"sü\\" meaning \\"army\\" (possibly from Middle Chinese 戍 ɕɨoH \\"frontier guard\\")Dybo, Anna (2014), “Early contacts of Turks and problems of Proto- Turkic reconstruction”, in Tatarica, 2, p. 8 and \\"başı\\" \\"head > ruler\\". = Political history = The Oguz State played an important role in the military and political history of Eurasia. In 965 the Oguz State allied with Kievan Rus in a war against the Khazar Kaganate. In 985 the alliance with Kievan Rus defeated Volga Bulgaria, which increased the political power of the Oguz State. At the turn of the 10th–11th centuries, popular uprisings broke out against excessive taxation in the state. The revolts became especially strong in the second half of the 10th century, during the rule of Ali Yabgu. The split between the ruling Oguzes and Seljuk branch of Oguzes turned out to be detrimental to the state. The upheaval was used by the Seljuk branch, who led an uprising and took Jend, but soon they were forced to leave the Jend area. During the reign of the last Oguz Yabgu Shahmalik the state rebounded. In 1041 Shahmalik Yabgu conquered Khorezm from the Ghaznavids, but two years later he was captured by the Seljuk forces and executed. Shahmalik Yabgu was the last ruler of the Oguz State. Internal turmoil and conflict with the Seljuks weakened the Oguz State. The weakened state fell under attacks by the Kipchak tribes from the Kimak Kaganate. Under the pressure of the Kipchaks, the two branches of the Oguz people split, a significant part of the Oguzes went to Eastern Europe, and the Seljuk Oguzes left toward Asia Minor. Another part of the Oguzes fell under the rule of the Karahanids and Seljuk rulers of Khorasan. The remnants of those Oghuz defeated by the Kipchaks subsequently dissolved among the Turkic-speaking tribes of Dasht-e-Kipchak. The Oghuz tribes contributed to the formation of many of today's Turkic peoples. In the 11th century, Oguz migration to Persia and the Near East began. The movement was led by the head of the Kınık tribe Tughril and Chaghri Beg, the grandchildren of Seljuk. This migrating group became, in time, the Seljuk Empire. In 1025 a part of the Seljuks settled in the territory of the modern Turkmenistan, centered on the city of Nysa. In 1034 – 1035, they were joined by Togrul bek's subjects. In 1038–1040, the Seljuks fought against Ghaznavids and captured Nishapur. Subsequently, they were able to create a huge state, which consisted of Asia Minor, Persia, and parts of the Caucasus and Central Asia. The Oguz il state existed for three centuries. Another Turkic group, Kipchaks and Kimeks of the Kimek Kaganate, ended the state by the 12th century. By that time, Selçuk Bey and his Kınık (tribe) headed to Persia to found their own Muslim state, which in the future would become the Great Seljuq Empire, and a part of the state population moved eastward to the N.Pontic areas. =Oghuz Yabgu state on the Syr Darya= The above is mostly an account of the Oghuz as a whole. 'State' is misleading for a group loosely- organized tribes. Bregel has the following for one group.Yuri Bregel, Historical Atlas of Central Asia, maps 11,13,14. When the Oghuz drove the Pechenegs out of the Syr Darya delta a leader from the Barani clan took the title of yabghu. How far his power extended is not clear. His capital or winter camp was at Yangikent (=new-town) where the Syr Darya made its last split. Around 985 one of his commanders named Seljuk split off and moved to Jend south of the upper delta and converted to Islam. His followers became the Seljuks. The yabghu converted a little later. In 1034-35 yabghu Shah Malik Barani defeated the Seljuks and Turkomans of Khwarezm which caused many Turkomans to move south to Khorasan and the Kopet Dagh. In 1041 Shah Malik conquered Khwarezm after a three-day battle. The Seljuks drove him out in 1043. He fled and was later killed, his 'state' perhaps disappearing.  Political system  The economic base of society was private ownership of livestock. Little is known about the old farming communities in the oases, river valleys, and wetlands. The cities continued to be populated by traders and artisans. The title of the elected ruler was Yabgu. The power was hereditary within a ruling clan. The heir to the throne was called Inal, they were brought up by an Atabek tutor. Elections of Yabgu were conducted at the tribal assemblies. The rulers were chosen by the codex of unwritten rules of customary law – \\"tore\\", from the most powerful clans. The power of the supreme ruler was limited by the council of largest military-tribal aristocracy. The wives of the rulers bore a title \\"Khatun\\" and played a significant role in the court life. Yabgu was assisted by regional rules titled Kul-Eerkins. An important place was occupied by warlords. A head of the army was called Subashi, from su – army and bash – head. The Subashi was supported by a military council, and actively interfered in political events. The Oguz States was subdivided into uruks and aimaks. The term uruk designated tribal divisions, aimak was an administrative district. The clans and tribes united into larger tribal alliances were known as il (country). By the end of the 10th century formed a formal administrative apparatus and a system of regular taxes. The main religion was the traditional Tengrism, and later Islam.  Ethnic composition  The powerbase of the Oguz State were semi-nomadic and nomadic tribes of Zhetysu and Siberia: Yughra, Charuk, Khalaj, Kimek, Karluk, Imur, Bayandur, Kai,Agajanov, S.G. \\"The States of the Oghuz\\" History of Civilizations of Central Asia, Volume IV: The Age of Achievement AD 750 to the End of the Fifteenth Century. Motilal Banarsidass. pp. 61–76 and the remaining tribes and sedentary population of the Kangar Union that submitted to the Oguz Yabgu. The Oguz State was heterogeneous in ethnic terms. In urban and rural areas lived Turkic and Horezmian-speaking population. The reformation of the Oguz ethnic community was a complex and lengthy process. According to the Mahmud Kashgari (11th century) testimony, Oguz confederation consisted of 24 tribes, of which 12 tribes were Buzuks or Bazouk (Turkish and Turkmen: Bozoklar - Grey Arrows), and 12 tribes were Uchuks (Turkish and Turkmen: Üçoklar - Three Arrows). The Buzuk wing had a privileged status. Later authors, notably Marvazi, describe only about 12 tribes. The discrepancy between the sources probably resulted from the Oguz division into two exogamous parts, Buzuks and Uchuks belonging respectively to the right and the left wing of their army. Oguz States share in the Uruk and aimags. The term \\"Uruk\\" designated tribal divisions. Clans and tribes, united into larger tribal alliances known as \\"il\\" (the country).

History On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re- establish them as Air National Guard units.Rosenfeld, Susan, and Gross, Charles J. (2007), Air National Guard at 60: A History. Air National Guard history program AFD-080527-040 The Maine Air National Guard origins date to the formation of the 132d Fighter Squadron at Dow Army Airfield, Bangor, receiving federal recognition on 4 February 1947. It was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and its mission was the air defense of the state. 18 September 1947, however, is considered the Maine Air National Guard's official birth, concurrent with the establishment of the United States Air Force as a separate branch of the United States military under the National Security Act. A Lockheed F-80C Shooting Star of the 132d Fighter Squadron, 1950 The 132d was placed under the organization of the 67th Fighter Wing with headquarters at Logan Airport, Boston, Massachusetts (USA). The Maine 101st Fighter Group was federally recognized on 4 April 1947 with station at Camp Keyes, Augusta, Maine. Additional units of the 101st FG were organized and federally recognized. These units were: *132d Weather Station *201st Air Service Group *201st Air Service Group, Det. A In December 1948 the command was transferred to the Continental Air Command. Two years later the 101st FG was reorganized into a Wing-Base in order to standardize the Guard units with their active duty counterparts. This provided for additional supporting medical, service, transportation and base operating elements. The 101st Fighter Group was federalized and ordered to active service on 10 February 1951 as a result of the Korean War, being assigned to the Eastern Air Defense Force, Air Defense Command (ADC). ADC changed the status of the 101st from a Group to a Wing, and established the 101st Fighter-Interceptor Wing. The 101st Fighter-Interceptor Group was assigned to the new Wing as a subordinate unit. Support elements of the wing were the 101st Air Base Group; 101st Maintenance and Supply Group, and 101st Medical Group. The 132d, 133d and 134th Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons remained assigned to the 101st FIG. The mission of the 101st FIW was the air defense of New England. Its assigned squadrons were dispersed and equipped as follows: * 132d Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons, Dow AFB (F-80C) * 133d Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons, Grenier AFB (F-47D) * 134th Fighter- Interceptor Squadrons, Burlington Municipal Airport (F-51H) On 1 February 1952, the 101st Fighter-Interceptor Wing and Group were inactivated, the unit being taken over by the Air Defense Command 4711th Defense Wing at Presque Isle AFB, Maine. The 4711th assumed its mission and its operational squadrons all being transferred to the 4711th DW. The Maine State ANG Headquarters, Camp Keyes, Augusta was organized and federally recognized on 19 March 1952. KC-135Es of the 101st Air Refueling Wing at Pisa Airport, Italy, 1996 On 15 April 1956 the 101st FG was put on duty in New Hampshire until December 1960, when it was reassigned and reactivated in the State of Maine. The first nurses were assigned to the Maine Air National Guard in June 1956. Four years later the responsibility for training and inspection of the ANG was transferred from the Continental Air Command to the Air Defense Command. When the USAF Air Defense Command reorganized its Continental Air Defense forces to a numbered Air Force/Air Division Organization in April 1966, the 101st Air Defense Wing was assigned to the 36th Air Division located at Topsham Air Force Station, Maine and to Headquarters, First Air Force located at Stewart Air Force Base, New York. In September 1967 the number of aircraft was reduced from 25 to 18. In April 1976, the first KC-135A Stratotankers were assigned to the unit and the gaining command was changed from Air Defense Command to Strategic Air Command. In August 1990 selected Maine ANG units were mobilized in support of the Operation Desert Storm. Two years later the gaining command changed from SAC to the Air Mobility Command. The 101st ARW was then integrated into the Northeast Tanker Task Force (NTTF) in September 1994. After the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Maine has been activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle air defense overflights of major United States cities. Also, Maine ANG units have been deployed overseas as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as well as other locations as directed.

History= World War I= The Rhode Island Air National Guard traces its lineage back to 1915, when a group of Rhode Island residents purchased two Curtiss Model F flying boats, one of which was assigned to the state national guard. The border conflict in Mexico and America's entry into the First World War prevented much use, and in 1919 the National Guard aircraft, now obsolete, was sold as surplus.http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/air/143aw/default.aspx = World War II= In 1939, with war raging on both the European and Asian continents, President Franklin D. Roosevelt increased measures to prepare the U.S. armed forces for an American involvement. The State of Rhode Island was allocated one of only two new observation squadrons authorized by Congress that year. The 152nd Observation Squadron was organized and less than one year later federalized for extended active duty. After American entry into World War II, the 152nd Observation Squadron immediately took up its primary mission of anti-submarine patrols along the Northeastern shipping lanes. In September 1944 the unit, now designated the 37th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron, transferred overseas. Assigned to the 15th Air Force, squadron pilots flew photo reconnaissance missions in northern Italy, southern Germany and the Balkans until the end of the war in Europe in June 1945. =Cold War= An F-51D Mustang of the 152d Fighter Squadron, 1954 In 1946 the unit was reassigned back to the State of Rhode Island and designated the 152nd Fighter Squadron based at T. F. Green Airport, Warwick, Rhode Island. In September 1948 the 152nd received Federal Recognition and was assigned to the Continental Air Command program which tasked Air National Guard units with the defense of U.S. airspace. Flying the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and later the North American P-51 Mustang the unit trained for this mission. The USAF, in an effort to upgrade to an all jet fighter force, required Air National Guard Aerospace Defense Command units to upgrade to jet-powered aircraft like the Republic F-84 Thunderjet. This requirement ultimately proved to be the downfall of the 152nd. The Rhode Island Airport Commission and National Guard authorities found themselves in a conflict over the use of T.F. Green Municipal Airport in Warwick for tactical jet operations. Unable to resolve these differences the Air Force removed the jets from the state; however, quick negotiations and the National Guard Bureau's desire to have a flying unit located in every state brought a new mission and the numeric designation which is carried to this day, the 143d. The 143rd Air Resupply Squadron received federal recognition in November 1955. The National Guard flying program was once again alive and well in the State of Rhode Island. The unit was assigned the Grumman SA-16A Albatross seaplane and for a short time retained the Douglas C-47 Skytrain. There were several minor mission designation changes, and the C-47 was eventually replaced by the Curtiss C-46 Commando. In 1963 the first major mission change for the 143rd since the days of the fighters occurred. Situations around the world produced a need for specialized units which could insert a small group of trained combat troops on land or sea anywhere at a moments notice. The 143rd was tasked as one of the representatives of the National Guard in the Air Force's Air Commando Group structure. The C-46 Commando was replaced with the Helio U-10A/D Courier. During a three-year period starting in 1965, the U-10s belonging to the 143rd and other Air National Guard units were transferred back to the USAF for use in Vietnam, during which the U-10 was replaced by U-6 Beaver. In 1968 the U-10s returned from their tour of duty in Vietnam, and at this time the unit was redesignated the 143rd Special Operations Group. The Grumman SA-16A/HU-16A Albatross, flown by 143rd pilots since 1955, was replaced in 1968 with an updated version of the Albatross, the HU-16B. With twice the cargo capability and range, the HU-16B opened up new avenues of opportunity as was demonstrated in 1970. Flight and Ground crews of the 143rd assisted scientists and engineers of the Naval Underwater Systems Center, conducting studies of undersea acoustics, at Lake Tanganyika in Africa during April and again in August at Hudson Bay, Canada. The unit would work in the Special Operations field for seven more years, during which the HU-16 aircraft were eventually retired in 1972 and replaced with the Fairchild C-119G/L Flying Boxcar, an aircraft which the 143rd would fly for only three years. In 1975 as part of a general program to upgrade the countries Air National Guard units the 143rd was redesignated as a Tactical Airlift Group and assigned Lockheed C-130A Hercules aircraft. Always pressed for room at TF Green Airport the \\"new\\" C-130s, twice the size of anything the unit had previously flown, created quite the concern for the 143rd TAG commanders, flight crews and especially the crew chiefs and maintenance folks of the 143rd Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron. Relief would arrive in 1977 as part of the United States Navy's 1974 closure of Naval Air Station Quonset Point as part of a post- Vietnam defense cutback and returning the land and facilities to the State of Rhode Island. For the first time since 1915, when Guard pilots flew the Curtiss F from the old National Guard Training Camp at Quonset, the Rhode Island Air National Guard flying unit was to have a home to call its own - coincidentally the site occupied by the 143rd Airlift Group is in approximately the same location as the facilities used in 1915. In 1980, after three years of negotiations and construction the 143rd TAG moved into its new home at Quonset Air National Guard Base. The new facilities provided the room desperately needed to grow and expand the C-130 program. Over the next seven years the men and women of the 143rd trained with the aging \\"A\\" model C-130s. Rhode Island \\"Herks\\" could be found in all parts of the United States, Europe, Africa, and especially South America and the Caribbean. The RH Air Guard has consistently participated in deployments such as: Volant Oak, Volant Pine, Red Flag, Dragon Hammer, Volant Rodeo competition and humanitarian efforts such as \\"Operation Toy Lift\\" which provided toys to the children of Grenada after the U.S. intervention there in 1983. =Gulf War 1991= In 1989, after years of getting the job done with the C-130As, the 143rd TAG was finally selected for conversion to the C-130E model \\"Hercules\\". Hard work and determination during the conversion paid off in the summer of 1990 when volunteers answered the call to provide support during Operation Desert Shield. The 143rd TAG was among the first of the National Guard units to provide Flight Crews and Maintenance personnel needed by the USAF when additional trained manpower was needed. The first volunteers, in September 1990, flew out of Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany and provided backfill support for active duty personnel transferred into Turkey and Saudi Arabia in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The second group of volunteers departed in January 1991 and were stationed at RAF Mildenhall in the United Kingdom. Again, flying backfill operation, this crew had the distinction of being in the \\"Theater of Operation\\" when Operation Desert Shield turned into Operation Desert Storm, the Gulf War. This second group of volunteers returned home in February after completing a one-month rotation at Mildenhall ready to return to civilian life and jobs. However, about one week after their return these civilian soldiers were again asked to answer the call to duty, this time by the President of the United States. Not since World War II had members of the Rhode Island Air National Guard flying squadron been called to Federal Service. As in the Second World War the unit initially provided support in the United States doing the jobs vacated by active duty personnel transferred to the Gulf; but in April the unit finally got into the action again returning to RAF Mildenhall. With the defeat of the Iraqi forces and the end of the Gulf War, members returned home in June 1991 and were released from active duty. =Humanitarian relief operations= A C-130J-30 of the 143rd Airlift Group at the 2016 Farnborough Airshow In 1992 the unit was redesignated the 143rd Airlift Group in response to Air Force wide restructuring and assigned to Air Combat Command. The 143rd Airlift Group continues to support State, Federal and United Nations activities throughout the world. Volunteers from the 143rd have participated in may United Nations sponsored relief missions during the last three years; Somalia in 1992 and in late 1992 and much of 1993 Operation Provide Promise, where Rhode Island Air Guardsmen and women flew daylight airland missions into Sarajevo Airport and night airdrops over remote areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 1998 the USAF formed the Expeditionary Air Force (EAF); smaller sized fighting units able to rapidly respond to regional conflicts. The RH ANG has participated in five AEF operations, supporting Operation Joint Forge in the Balkans, Operation Southern Watch in Southwest Asia and Operation Coronet Oak in South America. A program of base infrastructure modernization and construction began in 2001 with the acquisition of adjacent land bringing Quonset to 42,800 qm (103.6 acres). An eight-year, $65 million base modernization and construction program included the installation of new fiber- optic, communication and electrical power infrastructure to support future base wide construction; the completion of a new Life Support Building; the complete reconstruction of the Motor Pool roof; construction of a new Aircraft Maintenance and Hangar facility to accommodate the conversion to the C-130J-30. In December 2001, the 143d received its first C-130J-30. The Rhode Island ANG became the first in the Air Force to receive the \\"stretch\\" version of the \\"J\\" model. The C-130J-30 can carry more cargo or personnel farther, faster, and more economically than the C-130E proving its increased airlift capability. The fleet for the 143d was completed with the arrival of the eighth C-130J at Quonset on 15 June 2007. =BRAC 2005= In its BRAC 2005 recommendations, the United States Department of Defense would realign Warfield ANGB, Maryland. DoD recommended to distribute the eight C-130J aircraft of the 175th Wing to the 146th Airlift Wing, Channel Islands ANGS, California (four aircraft), and 143d Airlift Wing (four aircraft). As a result of this recommendation, the 143rd Airlift Wing would retire two C-130E aircraft. This recommendation would move C-130Js to the California ANG and Rhode Island ANG, both of which already operated the C-130J, avoiding conversion training costs. In another recommendation, DoD recommended to realign the Arkansas Air National Guard by realigning one C-130J aircraft to the 143rd Airlift Wing.http://states.ng.mil/sites/RI/air/143aw/pg2/default.aspx =War on Terror= After the September 11 attacks 2001, the RI ANG responded to the call again, deploying unit members to Ground Zero, to US bases for homeland security and implemented 24-hour operations at Quonset State Airport. Since September 11 the 143rd AW has supported the War on Terror by not only becoming a bridge to and from the theater but by also providing airlift in support of the war effort. The RI ANG provided the 1st ever C-130J aircraft in a combat role by the USAF in December 2004 and continued to support the war effort with both the C-130E and C-130J until retiring the C-130E in 2005. The RI ANG also provided troop support within Southwest Asia and many other areas of the world. The location of Quonset being the easternmost C-130 base has provided the 143rd AW with a unique opportunity to become a \\"bridge\\" between Europe and the Continental United States in support of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom. Quonset State Airport is ideally located to fully support all C-130s, both departing for and returning from their overseas missions.

It is, along with the Vermont Army National Guard, an element of the Vermont National Guard. The 158th Fighter Wing is its sole unit. It is under the jurisdiction of the Governor of Vermont through the office of the Vermont Adjutant General unless they are federalized by order of the President of the United States. The Vermont Air National Guard is headquartered at Burlington Air National Guard Base. Overview Under the \\"Total Force\\" concept, Vermont Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the United States Air Force (USAF). Vermont ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a Major Command of the USAF if federalized. In addition, the Vermont Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window. Along with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the Vermont ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense. History On 24 May 1946, the United States Army Air Forces, in response to dramatic postwar military budget cuts imposed by President Harry S. Truman, allocated inactive unit designations to the National Guard Bureau for the formation of an Air Force National Guard. These unit designations were allotted and transferred to various State National Guard bureaus to provide them unit designations to re- establish them as Air National Guard units. F-51H Mustangs of the 134th Fighter Squadron at Burlington Airport, 1952 The Vermont Air National Guard origins date to the formation of the 134th Fighter Squadron at Burlington International Airport, receiving federal recognition on 14 August 1946. It was equipped with F-47D Thunderbolts and its mission was the air defense of the state. It was assigned initially directly to the Vermont Air National Guard until the Massachusetts ANG 67th Fighter Wing, was federally recognized on 15 October 1946. The 67th Fighter Wing was the first ANG command and control organization in New England. On 4 April 1947, it was transferred to the Maine ANG 101st Fighter Group. During the Korean War, the 134th was federalized on 10 February 1951 and assigned to the federalized Maine ANG 101st Fighter- Interceptor Wing, although it initially remained stationed at Burlington Airport. Its mission was expanded to include the air defense of New England. The squadron was then attached to the Air Defense Command 23d Fighter- Interceptor Wing at Presque Isle AFB, Maine on 1 April 1951 with no change of mission. It was reassigned to the 4711th Defense Wing on 6 February 1952 at Presque Isle AFB. It was released from active duty and returned to control of State of Vermont on 1 November 1952. On 1 May 1956 the 134th was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 158th Fighter Group (Air Defense) was established by the National Guard Bureau; the 134th FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. In line with an Air Force-wide redesignation, the wing became simply the 158th Fighter Wing in 1992. Today the Vermont Air National Guard provides air defense as part of the United States Northern Command (USNORTHCOM)/North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) in time of war or national emergency for the defense of the North American continent. From 1989 to 1997 the wing had aircraft on 5-minute alert, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. After the September 11 attacks, elements of every Air National Guard unit in Vermont has been activated in support of the Global War on Terrorism. Flight crews, aircraft maintenance personnel, communications technicians, air controllers and air security personnel were engaged in Operation Noble Eagle air defense overflights of major United States cities. Also, Vermont ANG units have been deployed overseas as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq as well as other locations as directed. In December 2013 the USAF announced the first US Air Force Air National Guard unit to fly the new F-35 Lightning II will be the 158th Fighter Wing of the Vermont Air National Guard based at the Burlington Air Guard Station. The 158th currently flies the F-16 Falcon, which are nearing the end of their useful service lives. The last of the Vermont Air National Guard F-16s left in April of 2019 to make way for the arrival of the F-35 later that year. On September 19th, 2019 the first two F-35s arrived at Burlington International Airport with another eighteen being delivered at later dates.

The original civilian airfield that preceded it, the Harvard Aviation Field, dates back to 1910. The base was sited on Squantum Point in the city of Quincy, Massachusetts. It also abutted Dorchester Bay, Quincy Bay, and the Neponset River. History Early military usage of the airfield dates to the early months of U.S. involvement in World War I when the Massachusetts Naval Militia (a forerunner to the United States Naval Reserve) built a small wooden seaplane hangar and pier on the Dorchester Bay shoreline adjacent to the former Harvard Aviation Field. Primary flight instruction was provided at the Massachusetts School for Naval Air Service, as the tiny seaplane base was originally called, to members of the Massachusetts Naval Militia who would subsequently go on to take advanced flight training at the Navy's flying school at Pensacola, Florida. In May 1917 the Navy took the seaplane base over and evicted the Sturtevant Aeroplane Company from the former Harvard Aviation Field as well. The Navy continued to use the U.S. Naval Air Station Squantum as a primary flight training facility until the end of September 1917 when all naval flight training activity was consolidated in areas of the country with better year-round flying weather. Thereafter, much of land surrounding the former seaplane base and Harvard Aviation Field was taken over by the Navy Department for the construction of a new shipyard called the Victory Destroyer Plant. The Victory Plant, which was owned by the government but operated by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, was designed specifically to mass-produce one type of ship, the Clemson-class destroyers. A total of 35 were built at the Victory Plant before the shipyard closed on 1 June 1920. During the summer of 1923 then-Lieutenant Richard E. Byrd, with the assistance of a group of volunteer Navy veterans of the First World War, helped found the NRAS (Naval Reserve Air Station) at Squantum Point using the disused First World War seaplane hangar, which had remained more-or- less intact after the Victory Plant shipyard was built. NRAS Squantum, which was commissioned on 15 August 1923, is considered to have been the first air base in the Naval Reserve program.\\"Squantum Twenty Years Old: Aviation site since 1911\\", Naval Aviation News, October 1943. Cf. p.9 During October 1929 a small turf airfield was opened at NRAS Squantum. Up to this point, NRAS Squantum was a seaplane base only, though occasional naval landplane operations were conducted using the airfield at the nearby Dennison Airport. In early 1930, possibly because of the addition of the airfield, Squantum was redesignated a Naval Reserve Air Base or NRAB. OJ-2s and SBUs of VS-2R lined up for inspection, in 1938. Throughout the 1930s decade NRAS Squantum was greatly improved and expanded, in the manner of an aerodrome, without defined runways. This was due in large part to the ingenuity of executive officer John J. Shea, a man who knew how to leverage and make the most out of volunteer labor, salvaged materials, and Depression-era public works programs like the Works Progress Administration. The greatest expansion efforts on the base took place between 1939 and 1941 when, among other things, three \\"proper\\" paved runways were built (in contrast to the earlier \\"aerodrome\\" design) and the old Victory Plant Shipyard buildings (many of which had been gutted during a previous fire) were razed. On 5 March 1941 the base at Squantum was redesignated a Naval Air Station or NAS. During the Second World War NAS Squantum served as a maritime patrol as well as a training base for American and British naval aviators. Regular Navy squadrons VJ-4 and VS-1D1/VS-31 flew anti-submarine patrols over Massachusetts Bay and the Gulf of Maine using Grumman J2F Ducks, Consolidated PBY Catalinas, Vought-Sikorsky OS2U Kingfishers, Douglas SBD Dauntlesses, and Curtiss SB2C Helldivers. In addition, the base provided elimination and primary flight instruction for Naval Aviation Cadets as well as advanced training to Fleet Air Arm (Royal Navy) torpedo and dive-bomber squadrons, and U.S. Navy fighter, torpedo, and dive-bomber squadrons. It was at Squantum that baseball legend Ted Williams did his paperwork to join the Civilian Pilot Training Program during the war. After the war ended, NAS Squantum became an important component of the new Naval Air Reserve Training Command, some of types based there in numbers being Consolidated PBY-5A/6A Catalinas, Curtiss SB2C-5/CCF SBW-4E Helldivers, Vought F4U-4 and Goodyear FG Corsairs, Douglas R4D Skytrains, North American SNJ Texans and Grumman F6F-5 Hellcats. The base served as the focus of Navy and Marine Corps reserve aviation training activity in New England until December 1953 when the reserve program was moved to nearby NAS South Weymouth where longer runways would be available and Squantum was closed. The CO's SNB made the official last flight from Squantum when aircraft were transferred en masse to South Weymouth, however, an Avenger with maintenance problems became the last plane to actually depart a few days later. Squantum's base housing would continue to be used, however, for decades as military housing for the Boston area. \\"Modern\\" NAS Squantum had a couple of problems. First, its proximity to Boston's Logan International Airport resulted in increasing airspace conflicts in the postwar era; the Boston Logan Instrument Landing System was in alignment with Runway 2 of Squantum. In one case, an Air France Lockheed Constellation bound for Boston actually landed at Squantum by mistake. The base's second problem was its short and landlocked (water locked?) runways. These were not long enough to support routine jet operations and because of the base's position on the Squantum peninsula they could not be lengthened. The 1946 and 1949 USGS topographic maps labeled the property as \\"U.S. Naval Reservation\\", but did not depict an airfield. The base's third problem was that it was old and that many of its facilities had been jury-built using scrap materials and re-used structures salvaged from the Victory Plant Shipyard during the depths of the Great Depression when funds were hard to come by. It was said of NAS Squantum in the January 1949 issue of Naval Aviation News that it \\"grew like topsy\\" and was more the result of having to make do with what was available instead of careful planning. Closure The location of the airport doomed it to be closed in 1953. Operations were moved to the nearby NAS South Weymouth. In 1957, the Navy transferred to the Air Force, which made the Squantum Electronics Research Annex. The site was labeled as an \\"Abandoned Airport\\" in 1960. Present-day usage One of several informational plaques in Squantum Point Park, this one commemorating the Harvard-Boston Aero Meet of 1910 Today a marina sits on its northern end; the air station's main hangar was its main building into the 1990s. Boston Scientific is also located on the site. A portion of the primary northwest runway was opened to the public in 2001 as Squantum Point Park.\\"Squantum Point Park\\" – Massachusetts Department of Conservation & Recreation Other than that, condominiums and other buildings forming the Marina Bay development dot the landscape of the former naval air station. A local veterans' organization, the Association of Naval Aviation Patriot Squadron, operates and maintains a small museum called the Shea Field Naval Aviation Historical Museum dedicated to preserving the heritage of NAS Squantum and NAS South Weymouth in the former Navy gymnasium (The Shea Fitness Center) located on CDR Shea Boulevard at former NAS South Weymouth (the SouthField Development) in Weymouth, Massachusetts.

He was capped nine times by Scotland. Career After working in a bank on leaving school, Irvine began his professional career with Falkirk in 1983, aged 18. During his spell with the Bairns, he became an evangelical Christian. After two years and nearly forty league appearances at Brockville, Irvine moved to Aberdeen, the team he had supported as a child, for a fee of £110,000. During twelve years with the Dons, Irvine made over 350 appearances in all competitions, gradually becoming a regular in the defence alongside Alex McLeish as veteran captain Willie Miller's career came to an end. Aberdeen won the Scottish Cup in 1990, with Irvine scoring the winning penalty in a 9–8 shootout win against Celtic in the final, having also scored in the quarter-final and semi-final. He had already come on as a substitute in the League Cup final victory in the same season, and played a part in two other finals and five runners-up finishes in the Scottish Premier Division (losing out to Rangers on every occasion), as well as helping the club avoid what would have been a first-ever relegation via a play-off in 1995. He took over in goals in emergencies (if the goalkeeper was injured or sent off) on several occasions, saving a penalty in a match against Hibernian in 1991. In June 1995 he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, returning to action four months after the diagnosis. Irvine left Pittodrie in 1997 (following a testimonial match against Wimbledon) and moved to Dundee, featuring nearly 70 times in two years. In 1999, Irvine moved to Ross County, where he finished his playing career in 2003. Coaching career / later work After retiring, Irvine stayed with County as a coach, taking his first managerial job in January 2006 with Elgin City.

The world price of oil had peaked in 1980 at over US$35 per barrel (equivalent to $ per barrel in dollars, when adjusted for inflation); it fell in 1986 from $27 to below $10 ($ to $ in dollars). The glut began in the early 1980s as a result of slowed economic activity in industrial countries due to the crises of the 1970s, especially in 1973 and 1979, and the energy conservation spurred by high fuel prices. The inflation-adjusted real 2004 dollar value of oil fell from an average of $78.2 in 1981 to an average of $26.8 per barrel in 1986.Oak Ridge National Lab data In June 1981, The New York Times proclaimed that an \\"oil glut\\" had arrived and Time Magazine stated that \\"the world temporarily floats in a glut of oil\\". However, The New York Times warned the next week that the word \\"glut\\" was misleading, and that temporary surpluses had brought down prices somewhat, but prices were still well above pre-energy crisis levels. This sentiment was echoed in November 1981, when the CEO of Exxon Corp also characterized the glut as a temporary surplus, and that the word \\"glut\\" was an example of \\"our American penchant for exaggerated language\\". He wrote that the main cause of the glut was declining consumption. In the United States, Europe, and Japan, oil consumption had fallen 13% from 1979 to 1981, \\"in part, in reaction to the very large increases in oil prices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporters\\", continuing a trend begun during the 1973 price increases. After 1980, reduced demand and increased production produced a glut on the world market. The result was a six-year decline in the price of oil, which reduced the price by half in 1986 alone. Production OPEC, Non-OPEC, & World oil production, 1973–2004EIA – International Energy Data and Analysis =Non-OPEC= During the 1980s, reliance on Middle East production dwindled as commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico, and the Soviet Union became the world's largest producer of oil.\\"World: Saudis Edge U.S. on Oil\\". Washington Post, 3 January 1980, p. D2. Smaller non-OPEC producers including Brazil, Egypt, India, Malaysia, and Oman doubled their output between 1979 and 1985, to a total of 3 million barrels per day. United States In April 1979, US President Jimmy Carter signed an executive order to remove price controls from petroleum products by October 1981 so that prices would be wholly determined by the free market. Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan, signed an executive order on 28 January 1981, which enacted that reform immediately, allowing the free market to adjust oil prices in the US. That ended the withdrawal of old oil from the market and artificial scarcity, which encouraged an increase in oil production. The US oil windfall profits tax was lowered in August 1981 and removed in 1988, ending disincentives to US oil producers. Additionally, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System began pumping oil in 1977. The Alaskan Prudhoe Bay Oil Field entered peak production, supplying 2 million bpd of crude oil in 1988, 25 percent of all US oil production.National Energy Technology Laboratory. \\"Fossil Energy – Alaska Oil History,\\" Arctic Energy Office. Accessed 29 July 2009. North Sea Phillips Petroleum discovered oil in the Chalk Group at Ekofisk, in Norwegian waters in the central North Sea. Discoveries increased exponentially in the 1970s and 1980s, and new fields were developed throughout the continental shelf. =OPEC= From 1980 to 1986, OPEC decreased oil production several times and nearly in half, in an attempt to maintain oil's high prices. However, it failed to hold on to its preeminent position, and by 1981, its production was surpassed by non-OPEC countries. OPEC had seen its share of the world market drop to less than a third in 1985, from about half during the 1970s. In February 1982, the Boston Globe reported that OPEC's production, which had previously peaked in 1977, was at its lowest level since 1969. Non-OPEC nations were at that time supplying most of the West's imports. OPEC's membership began to have divided opinions over what actions to take. In September 1985, Saudi Arabia became fed up with de facto propping up prices by lowering its own production in the face of high output from elsewhere in OPEC. In 1985, daily output was around 3.5 million bpd, down from around 10 million in 1981. During this period, OPEC members were supposed to meet production quotas in order to maintain price stability; however, many countries inflated their reserves to achieve higher quotas, cheated, or outright refused to accord with the quotas. In 1985, the Saudis tired of this behavior and decided to punish the undisciplined OPEC countries. The Saudis abandoned their role as swing producer and began producing at full capacity, creating a \\"huge surplus that angered many of their colleagues in OPEC\\". High-cost oil production facilities became less or even not profitable. Oil prices as a result fell to as low as $7 per barrel. Reduced demand World energy consumption, 1965–2013, showing oil demand falling significantly in the early 1980s OPEC had relied on the price inelasticity of demand of oil to maintain high consumption, but underestimated the extent to which other sources of supply would become profitable as prices increased. Electricity generation from coal, nuclear power and natural gas; home heating from natural gas; and ethanol blended gasoline all reduced the demand for oil. =United States= New passenger car fuel economy in the United States rose from in 1978 to more than in 1982, an increase of more than 30 percent.

In 1981, before the brunt of the glut, Time Magazine wrote that in general, \\"A glut of crude causes tighter development budgets\\" in some oil- exporting nations. Mexico had an economic and debt crisis in 1982.

It was upset by Kuwait contributing to the glut and allegedly pumping oil from the Rumaila field below their common border. Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, planning to increase reserves and revenues and cancel the debt, resulting in the first Gulf War. The Soviet Union had become a major oil producer before the glut. The drop of oil prices contributed to the nation's final collapse. In the US, domestic exploration and the number of active drilling rigs were cut dramatically. In late 1985, there were nearly 2,300 rigs drilling wells; a year later, there were barely 1,000. The number of US petroleum producers in decreased from 11,370 in 1985 to 5,231 in 1989, according to data from the Independent Petroleum Association of America. Oil producers held back on the search for new oilfields for fear of losing on their investments. In May 2007, companies like ExxonMobil were not making nearly the investment in finding new oil that they did in 1981. Canada responded to high energy prices in the 1970s with the National Energy Program (NEP) in 1980. The program was in place until 1985.

History  The club was established in 1909 as Fußball Club Bergisch Gladbach and was joined that same year by the membership of FC Montania Bergisch-Gladbach. On 22 January 1919, FC merged with Turn- und Sportverein der Firma J. W. Zanders Bergisch Gladbach to form Sport-Verein Bergisch Gladbach. This club merged with VfL Gronau in 1936. The team emerged from lower-tier play into the Landesliga Rheinbezirk in 1948, and in the following season, into the 2. Liga-West (II). Following league reorganization in 1952, FC settled into the Amateurliga Mittelrhein (III), where they first took a group title within the division in 1953 before moving on to capture the national amateur final 3:2 over Homberger SV. This led to a first-round DFB-Pokal (German Cup) appearance in 1954, which was followed by additional Amateurliga Mittelrhein group titles in 1955, 1956, and 1958. FC was unable to match its earlier success and the team's performance fell off entering into the 1960s. They played as a lower-table third-division side into the early 1970s.Grüne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag A 1973 merger with SSG Bergisch Gladbach – itself newly formed out of the union of SV Blau-Weiss 1962 Hand, SV Katterbach, and Sportfreunde Paffrath – failed to improve the club's fortunes, and SSG slipped to lower- level competition. The club has since made sporadic appearances in the Oberliga Nordrhein (IV) (1987–88, 1996–98, 2003–04), most recently returning to fourth-tier play in 2006. In 2007 Bergisch Gladbach decided to drop SSG from its name. The club changed its name again in April 2008 to SV Bergisch Gladbach 09, though it is called Bergisch Gladbach 09 most of the time. After a number of seasons fluctuating between the Verbandsliga Mittelrhein and the Oberliga Nordrhein, the club won promotion to the NRW-Liga in 2009. When this league was disbanded in 2012, they were admitted to the Regionalliga West, where they lasted for just one season before being relegated to the Mittelrheinliga.SV Bergisch Gladbach at Fussball.de Tables & results of the German football leagues, accessed: 25 March 2015 They were promoted back to the Regionalliga West as champions in 2019.  Women's football  Bergisch Gladbach fielded a very successful women's side that has a record nine national titles to its credit, as well as three Frauen DFB-Pokal wins. Though the club has produced 18 players who played for the German national team, Silvia Neid is by far the most famous former player of the club. The women's football department left the club in 1996 to become part of TuS Köln rrh., which in turn passed their licence to Bayer Leverkusen after the 2007–08 season.

It was built in 1960, and is the largest shopping center in Lincoln, with 107 stores. The mall's anchor stores are Dillard's, Shoe Dept. Encore, David's Bridal, Dick's Sporting Goods, Round 1 Entertainment, and JCPenney. There are 3 vacant anchor stores that were once Younkers, Forever 21, and Sears. History The mall opened as Gateway Shopping Center in 1960, developed by Bankers Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (now Ameritas Life Insurance Company) at 60th and O streets on land adjacent to its headquarters. It was an open-air mall anchored by Montgomery Ward and local department store Miller & Paine. An expansion was completed in 1971. Brandeis added a department store, in the unusual location of directly next door to Miller & Paine (typically, mall department store anchors are located apart from each other in separate wings). This project included an enclosed mall corridor and new Sears. A new wing leading to a JCPenney department store was added in 1995-1996; Penney's had been located in a former grocery store in a strip mall behind the shopping center after moving from downtown Lincoln. The original, open-air mall was also enclosed at this time, with a food court built in the southern end of the Center Court. A $45 million renovation in 2004-2005 added a new food court and carousel in the Center Court area. The old Montgomery Ward space (vacated in 2001) was refitted with a new Steve and Barry's (which has since closed due to that retailer's bankruptcy) and Qdoba Mexican Grill, among other retailers. Bankers Life sold the mall in 1985 to Jacobs Visconsi Jacobs (later The Jacobs Group). Westfield Group bought the mall in 2001. In June, 2012, Starwood Capital Group acquired the mall from Westfield.Starwood Capital Group Completes Acquisition of Shopping Centers from Westfield Group.

Israel. It occurred on May 23, 2002. The attempt was foiled with no injuries, but if it had succeeded, it could have killed thousands of people in a massive fireball.  The attack  On Thursday, May 23, 2002, Israeli truck driver Yitzhak Ginsburg drove a tanker truck into the Pi Glilot gas depot, and pulled up next to eight other parked fuel tankers. As the truck was being filled with diesel, a bomb on the underside of the truck was detonated, causing the truck to rupture and catch fire. Ginsburg was thrown from the vehicle but was not injured. Safety workers at the facility put out the fire using sprinkler systems. Israeli police stated that the bomb had been placed on the truck by a Palestinian terrorist while the truck was parked overnight in a publicly accessible lot near the facility. He waited for the truck to be refueled, then detonated the bomb using a remote-control device, possibly a mobile phone. According to investigators, the terrorist watched the tanker from a nearby vantage point.\\" Bomb blast at fuel depot could have killed thousands.\\" Israel Faxx, May 24, 2002. Israeli officials said that if the plot had succeeded, the fire would have spread to nearby gas tanks stored in the Pi Glilot facility, which held about 3,000 tons of gas and 80 million liters of fuel. This would have sparked a chain reaction, resulting in an explosion that would create a shock wave powerful enough to destroy cars and buildings in the area, and a massive fireball that would have consumed everything within a radius of several kilometers. The results would have been devastating due to the Pi Glilot depot's location. The depot was located in Herzliya, north of the upscale Tel Aviv neighborhood of Ramat Aviv and near the city of Ramat HaSharon. The depot also stood next to the Glilot Junction on Highway 2, one of Israel's busiest traffic arteries. The headquarters of Mossad, Shin Bet, and Israeli Military Intelligence are located at the Glilot Junction. If the truck had been carrying a more volatile fuel than diesel such as gasoline, disaster would have been more likely.CLOSE TO CATASTROPHE AT PI GLILOT: Israel's largest fuel depot attacked by Palestinian groupGlick, Caroline: The Israeli Solution: A One-State Plan for Peace in the Middle East (2014) Police estimated that the attack would have killed 10,000 people.

By September 2013, two flight-capable entry, descent and landing systems (EDLS) have been manufactured and tested. As of 2015 baseline funding exists until 2020. As of 2016, neither the launch vehicle nor precursory launch date have been set. The objective is to establish a widespread surface observation network on Mars to investigate the planet's atmospheric structure, physics and meteorology. The bulk of the mission consist of at least 16 MetNet impact landers deployed over the Martian surface. History The basic concepts of Mars MetNet were initiated by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) team in late 1980s. The concept was matured over a decade, and eventually the development work started in the year 2000.MetNet - Precursor Mission Overview MetNet can be considered as a successor of the NetLander, Russian Mars 96 and the earlier ESA Marsnet and InterMarsnet mission concepts. Of these Mars 96 went all the way to launch, but failure on the trans-mars injection with fourth stage of the rocket caused it to re-enter Earth and break-up. As part of this multi-part mission were two penetrators quite like MetNet. Main difference being that on the impact the front part would separate from the back and delve some meters deeper into ground. MetNet was among the missions proposed at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly in April 2016.http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-7592.pdf = Status = The scope of the Mars MetNet mission is eventually to deploy several tens of impact landers on the Martian surface. Mars MetNet is being developed by a consortium consisting of the Finnish Meteorological Institute (Mission Lead), the Russian Space Research Institute (IKI) (in cooperation with Lavochkin Association), and Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA) from Spain.Design of an enhanced MEIGA-MetNet dust micro-sensor able to perform gas sensing in Mars atmosphere. M. A. Rodríguez. Electron Devices (CDE), 2015. The baseline program development funding exists until 2020.Mars MetNet Mission Status. 17 April 2015. Definition of the precursory mission and discussions on launch opportunities are currently under way. The precursory mission would consist of one lander and is intended as a technology and science demonstration mission. If successful and if funded, more landers are proposed to be deployed in the following launch windows. By 2013, all qualification activities had been completed and the payload and flight model components were being manufactured. By September 2013, two flight-capable entry, descent and landing systems (EDLS) had been manufactured and tested with acceptance levels. One of those two probes is being used for further environment tests, while a second is currently considered flight-worthy. The tests covered resistance to vibration, heat, and mechanical impact shock, and are ongoing as of April 2015. The test EDLS unit may later be refurbished for flight. Scientific objectives Detailed characterization of the Martian circulation patterns, boundary layer phenomena, and climatological cycles requires simultaneous in situ meteorological measurements from networks of stations on the Martian surface. The fact that both meteorology in particular and climatology in general vary both temporally and spatially means that the most effective means of monitoring these is to make simultaneous measurements at multiple locations and over a sufficiently long period of time. Mars MetNet includes both a global-scale, multi-point network of surface probes supplemented by a supporting satellite in orbit, for a projected duration of two Martian years. Somewhere in the range of ten to twenty observation points is seen as a minimum to get a good picture of atmospheric phenomena on a planet-wide scale. Scientific objectives of the lander are to study: * Atmospheric dynamics and circulation * Surface to atmosphere interactions and planetary boundary layer * Dust raising mechanisms * Cycles of CO2, H2O and dust * Evolution of the Martian climate The purpose of the Mars MetNet Precursor Mission is to confirm the concept of deployment for the mini- meteorological stations onto the Martian surface, to obtain atmospheric data during the descent phase, and to obtain information about the meteorology and surface structure at the landing site during one Martian year or longer. Lander concept Artist's rendering of a MetNet impactor entering the Martian atmosphere. Lower module: inflatable heat shield; upper module: 1.8 m inflatable decelerator Each MetNet lander, or impactor probe, will use an inflatable entry and descent system instead of rigid heat shields and parachutes as earlier semi-hard landing devices have used. This way the ratio of the payload mass to the overall mass is optimized, and more mass and volume resources are spared for the science payload. The MetNet lander's atmospheric descent process can be partitioned into two phases: the primary aerodynamic or the 'Inflatable Braking Unit' deceleration phase, and the secondary aerodynamic or the 'Additional Inflatable Braking Unit' deceleration phase. The probes will have a final landing speed of 44.6 to 57.6 m/s. The operational lifetime of a lander on the Martian surface will be seven years. Deployment= As secondary payload = As the requirements for a transfer vehicle are not very extensive, the Mars MetNet impact landers could be launched with any mission going to Mars. The landers could piggyback on a Martian orbiter from ESA, NASA, Russia or China or an add-on to larger Martian landers like ExoMars. = Dedicated launch = Also a dedicated launch with several units from low Earth orbit is under study. Most of the Mars MetNet landers would be deployed to Mars separately a few weeks prior to the arrival to Mars to decrease the amount of required fuel for deceleration maneuvers. The satellite platform would then be inserted to an orbit around Mars and the last few Mars MetNet impact landers would be deployed to the Martian surface form the orbit around Mars to be able to land on any selected areas of the Martian surface in a latitude range of +/- 30 degrees for optimal solar panel efficiency. A sounder on board the orbiter would perform continuous atmospheric soundings, thus complementing the in situ observations. The orbiter will also serve as the primary data relay between the impact landers and the Earth. Precursory mission A technology demonstrator mission called 'Mars MetNet Precursory Mission' could be launched either piggy-backing with another Mars mission or with a dedicated launch using the Russian Volna — a converted submarine sea-launched ballistic missile. The Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) originally planned to launch the demonstration lander on board the Phobos Grunt mission on 2011. However, the Mars MetNet lander was dropped from the Phobos-Grunt mission due to weight constraints on the spacecraft. Phobos-Grunt later failed to depart Earth orbit and crashed into the Pacific Ocean on January 16, 2012. The precursory mission launch date is yet to be determined. =Payload= The notional payload of the Mars MetNet Precursor Mission may include the following instruments: *MetBaro: pressure sensor with a 1015 hPa limit (100 g) *MetHumi: humidity sensor (15 g) *MetTemp: temperature sensor with a range from -110 °C to +30 °C (2 g) *Panoramic camera with four lenses mounted at 90° intervals (100 g) *MetSIS: a solar radiance sensor with an optical wireless communications system for data transfer *Dust Sensor: an infrared dust and gas detector (42 g) =Power= The impact landers are equipped with flexible solar panels, located on the upper side of the inflatable braking unit, that will provide approximately 0.6 W during the day. As the provided power output is insufficient to operate all instruments simultaneously, they are activated sequentially according to the different environmental constraints.

The Amtrak Railroad Anacostia Bridge is a railway-only bridge which crosses the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. It carries Amtrak's Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line passenger rail traffic. It was the site of the famous \\"Crescent Limited wreck\\" in August 1933, caused when the bridge was damaged by the 1933 Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane. Construction On February 26, 1903, the Commissioners of the District of Columbia gave their approval for the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&P;, then controlled by the Pennsylvania Railroad [PRR]) to build a more direct line from Baltimore to the District of Columbia.\\"In Favor of New Railroad,\\" The Washington Post, February 27, 1903. The new route would be called the Magruder Branch (because it crossed the Magruder Branch, a stream which is a tributary of the Anacostia River). It would largely replace the local section of the Washington City Branch, which crossed the Anacostia to the south. The Magruder Branch would connect the new Union Station with the PRR Magruder Station in Landover, Maryland (a major hub for the railroad). Construction of the Magruder Branch line, however, required that a new bridge be built across the river (then also known as the \\"Eastern Branch\\"), and the Commissioners gave their approval for this bridge as well. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, which at the time had control over all rivers and bridges in the District of Columbia, approved the new bridge in September 1903.\\"New Bridge for 'The Branch',\\" The Washington Post, September 13, 1903. Construction began in 1904. A deep bed of gravel was laid down, and concrete piers placed on top of it. By the end of January 1905, the bridge was nearly finished, with the foundation and entire substructure complete.\\"Spending Millions on Union Railways Terminals,\\" The Washington Post, January 29, 1905. As of April 1906, one of the two tracks across the bridge had been laid.\\"Washington's New Station,\\" The New York Times, April 8, 1906. Wreck of the Crescent Limited The bridge was the site of the famous \\"Crescent Limited wreck.\\" On August 23, 1933, a hurricane (known today as the Chesapeake–Potomac Hurricane of 1933) passed over the District of Columbia, bringing of rain, extensive flooding, and much damage.\\"Gale Brings 7-Inch Rain, Floods River,\\" The Washington Post, August 24, 1933. Early in the morning on August 24, the Crescent Limited—a high-fare, luxury train catering to wealthy individuals—derailed as it crossed the bridge, plunging the locomotive and some of the passenger cars into the Anacostia River.\\"300 Work on Wreckage of Express Train That Killed Two,\\" The Washington Post, August 25, 1933. Although traveling only , the locomotive was hurled nearly from the point where it left the rails.\\"Views of the Debris After Fatal Train Wreck at Anacostia Bridge,\\" The Washington Post, August 25, 1933. The Anacostia's floodwaters had undermined the bridge's central piers, causing the bridge to sag and the rails to separate.\\"Limited Wreck On Anacostia Is Laid to Flood,\\" The Washington Post, September 1, 1933. The bridge's destruction had been swift: A track foreman had inspected the bridge 90 minutes before the wreck and found it sound, and a track walker had crossed the bridge just 10 minutes earlier and saw no damage.

The engineer and fireman were both killed, and 13 passengers injured (but only two severely).\\"Train Wreck Inquest Is Set,\\" The Washington Post, August 26, 1933. Just 30 passengers were aboard, which limited casualties. The couplings between the cars also held, preventing more cars from crashing into the river. Other factors also helped. When the train left Baltimore, railroad officials warned the engineer to slow down because of conditions created by the hurricane, and the locomotive's steam had been cut off (with the object of allowing the train to coast down the grade into the city). The cost of the disaster was estimated at between $80,000 and $240,000 ($ to $ in dollars). More than 300 workers began clearing the wreck the next day. The clearing of the wreck and reconstruction of the bridge was itself the cause of several injuries. A dredge, several cranes, and a pile-driver were brought on site to shore up the bridge and assist with the removal of debris and wreckage.\\"Worker Hurt By Pile Boom,\\" The Washington Post, August 28, 1933. Two men were hurt on August 24 by debris and cranes attempting to lift the locomotive from the water. Two days later, a man was killed when a telephone pole on the bridge toppled over onto him.\\"Accidents Balk Bridge Repairs,\\" The Washington Post, August 27, 1933. The same day, the pile-driver toppled over into the river as well. Another worker was injured on August 27 after being hit by a boom. At least one wrongful-death lawsuit was filed.\\"'Pennsy' Sued In Man's Death,\\" The Washington Post, October 30, 1934. A temporary single-track span was erected on August 28, and traffic over the bridge resumed shortly thereafter.\\"New Railway Span At Wreck Site Ready,\\" The Washington Post, August 29, 1933. An inquest into the wreck was scheduled for August 30. The inquest determined that flooding caused by the hurricane had undermined the bridge's piers. There was concern that dredging of the river's bottom, which had been going on since the bridge was completed, may have cause the velocity of the river to speed up and helped undermine the bridge's foundation. But experts from the Interstate Commerce Commission ruled this out in November 1933.\\"Report Blames Faulty Bridge In Rail Wreck,\\" The Washington Post, November 22, 1933.

The new structure had abutments which extended an additional onto the shore on either side of the bridge, and it was rather than above the water. Protective pilings and walls were also placed around the piers, to prevent fast-moving water from scouring around the piers and causing another collapse. In 1942, a Pennsylvania Railroad bridge watchman was struck by a train and thrown from the bridge.\\"Rail Policeman Tumbled Off Span by Train,\\" The Washington Post, August 29, 1942. The bridge suffered a fire early in the morning on January 24, 1944.\\"Bridge Fire Probe Fails to Reveal Sabotage,\\" The Washington Post, January 25, 1944. At first, the Federal Bureau of Investigation feared that the bridge had been set on fire deliberately as an act of sabotage. But the Metropolitan Police Department said that the fire started when a night watchman dumped hot coals from the stove in his watchhouse down the embankment of the river, igniting dry brush and oil (which had dripped from passing rail cars) at the base of the bridge. A fireboat and 20 fire trucks and engines were needed to put out the blaze, which sent flames into the air. Some of the bridge's spans buckled because of the fire's heat. Major repair work was done on the bridge in 1999. The work was done in conjunction with repairs and upgrades to the New York Avenue Bridge, a highway bridge just upstream.Leslie Koren, \\"Work begins today on New York Avenue,\\" The Washington Times, March 2, 1999; Alan Sipress, \\"Repair Work Begins on New York Avenue,\\" The Washington Post, March 3, 1999. The work included assessing damage to and repairing the concrete piers under the bridge, replacing masonry and repairing the abutments, and repairing and maintaining the steel girders which form the bridge's superstructure. It is unclear how safe the bridge actually is, or what its current lifespan is projected to be. According to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), the federal government does not maintain an inventory of rail bridges or their condition.Federal Railroad Administration. \\"Railroad Bridge Safety Fact Sheet.\\" September 2008, p. 2.

It is the site where, according to Philip Melanchthon, the Ninety-five Theses were posted by Martin Luther in 1517, the act that has been called the start of the Protestant Reformation. From 1883 onwards, the church was restored as a memorial site and re-inaugurated on 31 October 1892, 375 years after Luther's posting. History A first chapel dedicated All Saints was erected at the new residence of the Ascanian duke Rudolf I of Saxe- Wittenberg from about 1340. Consecrated on 6 May 1346, Rudolf subordinated his foundation to the immediate jurisdiction of the Holy See. With further donations made by his successor Duke Rudolf II, it was determined the Wittenberg main church by Pope Boniface IX in 1400. =Foundation= Wittenberg Castle Church, after a woodcut by Lucas Cranach the Elder (1509) When in the late 15th century the Wettin prince Frederick III the Wise, elector of Saxony from 1486, had the former Ascanian fortress rebuilt, a new All Saints' Church was designed by the architect Conrad Pflüger (c. 1450 – 1506/07) and erected between 1490 and 1511 in the Late Gothic style. Consecrated on 17 January 1503, it became part of Frederick's electoral castle or Residenzschloss, also called '. Extensive furnishings by Tilman Riemenschneider, Jacopo de' Barbari, and Albrecht Dürer contributed to the construction of the castle complex and then the church. After in 1502 Elector Frederick III founded the University of Wittenberg (Leucorea) and received confirmation by the papal legate Raymond Peraudi in 1507, All Saints' was incorporated to serve as a chapel to the university and it quickly evolved into an important academic and worship center. Students were awarded their doctorates there, and the reformator Philipp Melanchthon made his famous inaugural speech at the church. A tradition of burying academic dignitaries of the university at the church developed. Several notable epitaphs are preserved up to today. =Theses Doors= \\"Theses Doors\\", commemorating Luther's Ninety- five Theses The main portal was often used by the university staff to pin up messages and notices; it is generally believed that on 31 October 1517, the eve of All Saints' Day, Martin Luther posted his Ninety-five Theses on the doors of All Saints' Church. This act, meant to promote a disputation on the sale of indulgences, is commonly viewed to be a catalyst for the Protestant Reformation. Whether the event actually took place or not, however, cannot be conclusively established. Nevertheless, Luther sent his objections in a letter to Archbishop Albert of Mainz on the same day. Frederick the Wise died in 1525 and was buried in the Castle Church. In the same year, the Lutheran rite was implemented. The church became the burial site of Martin Luther himself in 1546, and of Philipp Melanchthon in 1560. When during the Seven Years' War the Wittenberg fortress was occupied by the Prussian Army and shelled by Imperial forces in 1760, the Castle Church was destroyed by a fire resulting from the bombardment. The blaze left only half of the foundation standing, and none of the wooden portals survived. All Saints' was soon rebuilt, albeit without many priceless works of art that were lost forever. After Wittenberg was incorporated into the Prussian Province of Saxony, King Frederick William IV, in 1858, ordered commemorative bronze doors to be mounted onto the jambs where the original wooden ones had been located. On the doors the Theses are inscribed in their original Latin form. The doors themselves weigh . with ornaments modelled by Friedrich Drake. On 10 November 1858, 375 years after Martin Luther's birth, the new doors were commemorated at a formal ceremony. Above the doors is a tympanum crucifixion painting that portrays Luther on the left with his German Bible translation, and Philipp Melanchthon on the right, with the 1530 Augsburg Confession, the main confession of faith in the Lutheran Church which was formed by Luther and Melanchthon. These doors are among the most photographed in Europe. =Renovation= Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott\\", inscription on the church tower On the occasion of the fourth centenary of Luther's birth in 1883, an extensive restoration of All Saints' in a Neo-Gothic style was begun under the supervision of the Prussian architect Friedrich Adler by his disciple Paul Ferdinand Groth (1859-1955). The interior redesign included the present rib vault ceiling and pilasters, as well as matronea and the apse. Also, the -tall steeple was rebuilt, from which one can obtain a good view of the city of Wittenberg and the surrounding countryside. A quote, \\"Ein feste Burg ist unser Gott\\" (\\"A Mighty Fortress Is Our God\\"), from one of Luther's hymns, encircles the tower. On 31 October 1892, 375 years after Luther posted his 95 Theses on the doors of the church, All Saints' was re-inaugurated. All Saints' today Organ of the Schlosskirche, Wittenberg A Lutheran Castle Church parish was established in 1949. It later evolved to a centre of the East German peace movement (swords to ploughshares), when Friedrich Schorlemmer served here as a preacher from 1978 onwards. In 1983, 500 years after the birth of Luther, 12 new stained glass windows were installed in All Saints'. These honored the most important Reformation students of Luther, and were created by Renate Brömme in a \\"timeless\\" style at the order of the Lutheran World Federation. A new glazed brick roof was added in 1999-2000. Today, All Saints' Church serves not only as a place of worship, but it also houses the town's historical archives, is home to the Riemer-Museum, and a youth hostel. In view of the five-hundredth anniversary of Luther's Theses, the building has again undergone extensive renovation. The church was festively reopened on 2 October 2016 in the presence of President Joachim Gauck and Margrethe II of Denmark, who dedicated an altar frontal designed by herself.

It is the only member of the tribe MischocyttariniChecklist of the Polistine Tribe Mischocyttarini; the asymmetrical tarsal lobes of Mischocyttarus separates it from the tribe Epiponini. Mischocyttarus is the largest genus of social wasps, containing over 200 species and subspecies.. Mischocyttarus wasps build a relatively simple, single comb nest. Sometimes, the nest is built within a meter of the nest of Polistes carnifex. Foraging adults bring nectar and small caterpillars back to the nest to feed to the developing larvae which are individually housed in separate cells in the nest. Not all nests have a female with developed ovaries. Their biology is similar to that of species in the genus Polistes. However, Mischocyttarus appear to show considerably more social and reproductive flexibility than Polistes.

Early life and journey to America Robert de La Berge was born on May 24, 1638, in Colomby-sur-Thaon, Normandy, France, in what is now the department of Calvados. Robert was the son of Jacques de la Berge and Marie Poitevin who were married on May 8, 1636 in Colomby-sur-Thaon. Marie Poitevin was the widow of Jacques Touchet and had a son, Thomas, from that marriage. Jacques and Marie had two other sons: Abraham (born 2 September 1640) and Guillaume (born 15 February 1643). Abraham and Guillaume remained in France. Thomas Touchet, a carpenter by trade, had spent the years from 1650 to 1653 in New France. When he returned to New France in 1658, he took his half- brother Robert with him. Robert went to New France as a laborer, under a 3-year contract to work for a man named Massé Gravel in Château-Richer. Under the terms of the contract, Robert received a cash advance, an annual salary, and a guaranteed return trip to France. Robert arrived in New France aboard the ship Taureau on August 6, 1658. In 1661, Robert completed his 3-year obligation to Massé Gravel, but instead of returning to France, he received a concession of land in Château-Richer. In the October 1662, after a year of hard work, Robert sold the land to Charles Pouliot. Robert was apparently discouraged and intended to return to France. During the winter, Robert must have changed his mind. On February 4, 1663 Robert received a concession of land in the parish of Sainte-Famille. At about this same time, Nicolas Durand and his wife Françoise Gausse dit Le Borgne were living on a farm in Château- Richer (which would later become L'Ange-Gardien) with their infant daughter, Marie-Ursule. Nicolas had received the land as a concession from Olivier Le Tardif and built a wood house with a stone chimney on it. While that wood house, along with an addition built in 1697, was burned by the English in 1759, it is believed the two surviving stone chimneys are those of Maison Laberge. Françoise Gausse was the daughter of Maurice Gausse and Marguerite Blay of Noyon, Picardy, France. In late March 1663, Nicolas Durand had a fatal accident while clearing his fields. His widow and young daughter were left to fend for themselves. After only two months of widowhood, Françoise married Robert LaBerge on May 28, 1663 in Château-Richer. Françoise probably knew Robert from his earlier years in Château-Richer. Robert sold his property in Sainte-Famille and took up residence on the Durand farm in Château-Richer. In the years that followed, Robert became a respected citizen. He participated in the election of the first 3 church wardens of L'Ange-Gardien. Records of his business transactions indicate that Robert prospered financially in New France. Robert was one of the early industrialists in the area. Sometime before 1674, Robert installed furnaces which were used for the manufacturing of lime. In 1674 Maison Laberge was built. It was later expanded in 1692 and 1791. It is one of the oldest buildings in Canada. Maison Laberge is located at 14, rue Adrien Laberge, L'Ange-Gardien, Quebec, QC G0A 2K0. The LaBerge household also grew over the years. Robert and Françoise had six children: *Geneviève LaBerge was born on 22 April 1664 and was baptized the following day. *Françoise LaBerge died a few days after her birth and was buried in Château-Richer on 6 February 1666. *Catherine LaBerge was baptized on 15 September 1667. In 1687 she married Guillaume Maroist. In 1702 he purchased the western portion of the Laberge property from Nicolas who had received it as his inheritance. The 30th prime minister of Québec, Mme Pauline Marois, is a direct descendant of Guillaume Maroist. *François LaBerge was born on 12 June 1669. *Nicolas LaBerge was baptized on 29 February 1672. In 1702, Nicolas sold his property mentioned above, left his wife an children and went to help establish a tannery at present day Cairo, Illinois. After an epidemic broke out, he continued down the Mississippi to Mobile where he arrived in 1705. He was in the 1711 census and one of the very earliest inhabitants of French Louisiana. *Guillaume LaBerge was born on 30 April 1674. In 1702, Guillaume had signed a contract to farm at Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit but did not leave most likely because of the lawsuit with Marie Ursule Durand mentioned below was resolved. Robert was involved in a near-fatal accident during a trip to Québec. The event which took place prior to 1667 was recorded by Father Thomas Morel as follows:  Later life and death  Monument to the first colonists of L'Ange-Gardien. LaBerge became embroiled in a legal dispute with his stepdaughter, Marie-Ursule Durande, that lasted for 5 years before finally being resolved. On March 22, 1694 Robert obtained a receipt for 600 pounds from Marie-Ursule and her husband, Antoine Huppé dit Lagrois. This receipt was in return for the 600 pounds stipulated in her marriage contract and granted the entire property in L'Ange-Gardien to Robert. Later, in 1697, Robert sold a half acre to his son Guillaume. In 1697, Robert sold most of the remaining property to his sons, Nicolas and Guillaume. It was after these transactions, in 1698, that Marie-Ursule and her husband filed a petition with Sovereign Council seeking to have their marriage contract declared null and void and to renounce their inheritances. Marie-Ursule alleged that she was short-changed on her inheritance by Robert and Françoise who underestimated the value of her father's estate. She also alleged that she was a victim of her stepfather's greed and that he had attempted to marry her off at the age of 12 to a simpleton. She stated that her marriage to Antoine Huppé freed her from the slavery and abuses of her stepfather, Robert. The Court initially decided in favor of Marie-Ursule. Robert and Françoise appealed and the decision was overturned in August 1703 and all of Marie-Ursule's claims were dismissed. Robert LaBerge lived to the age of 74. His son, François, took care of him during his last years. Robert was found dead in his bed on the morning of 12 April 1712. He died at the home of Guillaume Boucher, the father-in-law of his son, François. Robert was buried in Château-Richer on the same day. Françoise Gausse died at the home of her daughter, Marie-Ursule Durant, in Beauport. She was buried on 8 March 1714. The burial records gave her age as 80 years.  De La Berge surname and notable descendants  He was the first to arrive in North America with his surname. Most people today with his surname (and its variants) in North America trace their family roots back to him. His descendants have held esteemed positions in private industry, Church and State in both Canada and the United States and include notable patriots, writers, artists, humanitarians, explorers and adventurers. While there are currently many Laberges in the town of L'Ange-Gardien where Maison Laberge is located, many Laberges migrated to Montreal and the town of Châteauguay, just south of it. When Robert arrived in 1658 he was illiterate but soon learned to read and write, most likely from Françoise. Robert signed his name many different ways. During the period of 1660 to 1680 one finds his named signed as: Robert de la Barge (1660); Rober de laberge (1662); Robert de Laberge (1663); Robert De la berge (1663); Rober La Berge (1663); Robert de la Bergue (1663); Robert Labarge (1665); Rober de la berge (1667); Rober la Berge (1668); Robert Laberge (1671); Robert laberge (1674),and Robert de laberge (1678). Starting in 1680 the form which prevailed and was widely used was Robert Laberge. As his children and descendants migrated into different parts of Canada and the United States, the name took two spellings: La Berge and La Barge with combinations of space or no space and capital \\"B\\" or lower case \\"b.\\" As an example, see the surname spellings of the Notable Descendants listed below. The predominant spelling used today in Québec is Laberge. The meaning in modern French of \\"la Berge\\" is \\"a bank or edge of a river or canal.\\" Prior to about 1590, however, there is no trace of the name \\"de la Berge.\\" The stem \\"Berg\\" with its early Germanic, Dutch & Nordic origins means \\"mountain\\" and is very common throughout Europe with many variants. Captain Joseph LaBarge (1815–1899) - Joseph LaBarge of St. Louis, Missouri, was one of the most famous of the Mississippi river boat captains. He transported people and goods up and down the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. According to an 1898 newspaper article, Captain LaBarge was the man who taught Mark Twain about the Mississippi River. His illustrious life is documented in the book, History of Early Steamboat Navigation on the Missouri River: Life and Adventures of Joseph LaBarge by Hiram M. Chittenden. Joseph LaBarge Biography Joseph Marie LaBerge (1787–1860) - The father of famed riverboat captain, Joseph LaBarge, Joseph Marie LaBarge Sr. was born at l'Assomption, Quebec, on July 4, 1787. In about 1808, he emigrated to St. Louis in a birch-bark canoe, travelling through various waterways to reach the Mississippi River. LaBarge served in the War of 1812 and was wounded in the battle of the River Raisin. In this battle, LaBarge lost two fingers from a gunshot and was scarred for life from a tomahawk wound to the head. He became a naturalized citizen following his service in the Army. For several years he was involved in the manufacture of charcoal and later owned a hotel and livery in St. Louis. He is probably best known for his exploits as a fur trapper in the far west. Several geographical landmarks such as LaBarge (or Battle) Creek and the city of La Barge, Wyoming, were named in his honor. These took their name from a battle with Indians in which LaBarge took part. Details of this event have been lost, however. LaBarge was also present in General Ashley's disastrous fight with the Aricara Indians on the Missouri River in 1823, and was the man who cut the cable of one of the keelboats so that it might drift out of range of the fire of the Indians. In January 1860, while on his way to visit an ill relative, LaBarge slipped on an icy St. Louis sidewalk and struck the curb. He died from his injuries two days later on January 22, 1860. (Further details of Joseph Marie LaBarge's life are contained in Hiram Martin Chittenden's book, History of Early Steamboat Navigation on the Missouri River: Life and Adventures of Joseph LaBarge, published by Ross & Haines, 1962.) Michel LaBerge (1836–1909) - Michel Laberge, born in Chateauguay, Quebec, was the first French-Canadian to explore the Yukon in 1866. Laberge worked at one time for the Russians and in 1867 he did some surveying for Western Union who wanted to build an overland telegraph to Europe. He later engaged in the fur trade in the Yukon under the name of the Pioneer American Fur Company. His contribution to geography is commemorated by Lake Laberge in the Yukon Territory, which was named after him in 1870. The lake, also known as Lake Lebarge in some early documentation, was the setting for Robert W. Service's famous poem, The Cremation of Sam McGee. Jean Baptiste LaBerge (1804–1883) - Leader of Rebellion of 1838, also called Lower Canada Rebellion in Beauharnois, Quebec. For his part in the uprising, Jean-Baptiste Laberge was imprisoned in Montreal on November 16, 1838 and received the death sentence on January 26, 1839. The sentence was changed to deportation and he was exiled to Australia, arriving in February 1840. Laberge and his fellow prisoners were later pardoned and Laberge was back with his family by the spring of 1844 and was regarded as a hero in his local community. Mia LaBerge (born 1967) is an American artist who painted the first Steinway Art Case Piano created to honor a university.Robinson, Michael A., \\"James Madison University Gets a Unique Art Case Steinway\\", Steinway & Sons (Magazine), Summer 2007, pg 56-57 In 2006, LaBerge was commissioned to paint the Madison Bluestone Art Case Piano which celebrates the hundredth anniversary of James Madison UniversityMadison (magazine), Summer 2007, pg 22 and also recognizes its status as Virginia’s first All-Steinway Music School.Bowser, Heather, \\"A Grand Work of Art : One- of-a-Kind Piano Comes to JMU Campus\\", Daily News-Record (Harrisonburg,VA) Tu 21 Aug 2007 The Madison Bluestone was among the last Art Case pianos with which Henry Z.

The first confirmed signal came from Alan Worsley under study in England; however his group did not publish their results until later.Alan Worsley Though the technique is simple, it opens broad new avenues of dream research and pushed the field of dream research, or oneirology, beyond its protoscientific and largely discredited psychoanalytic roots, establishing it as a fruitful and respectable discipline.

The assistance is provided through three basic programs: an online community for women business owners supplemented by live events; the \\"Make Mine a Million $ Business\\" award, providing up to US$50,000 to businesses with a minimum of two years in business and $250,000 in annual revenue; and the \\"Micro to Millions\\" award, offering up to $10,000 for businesses not meeting the time or revenue requirements for the larger award. History Count Me In is a leading national not-for-profit provider of resources, business education and community support for women entrepreneurs seeking to grow micro businesses to million dollar enterprises. Founded in 1999 by Iris Burnett and Nell Merlino, Count Me In began as the first online microlender, and in the following years discontinued the microlending program in order to focus on providing the education and resources women need to grow their businesses and find funding from other sources. The estimated economic impact of accelerating women's business success will generate at least four million new jobs and $700 billion in economic activity. Leading the charge and making their organizational vision a reality is co-founder with Iris Burnett, and CEO, Nell Merlino, the creative force behind Take Our Daughters to Work Day. Merlino was an entrepreneur who founded the organization based upon her personal experiences in growing her own small business. Facing questions regarding sources of capital, hiring quality talent and financial planning, she was unsure where to find answers. Recognizing that other women were likely facing similar circumstances and questions, she founded Count Me In for Women's Economic Independence to act as that informational resource. In 2005 the \\"Make Mine a Million $ Business Competition\\" -- known informally as \\"M3\\" -- was launched in the cities of Dallas, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Long Beach, California; Atlanta, Georgia; and New York, New York. Awardees were chosen by panels of local business owners. Following the initial launch, the M3 Competition spread across the country to include women entrepreneurs from every city and in every service or industry. “Beatriz Helena Ramos, founder and president of Dancing Diablo, a creative advertising company located in Brooklyn and Caracas, went from seeing herself as an artist/animator making $200K in annual business revenue to being the CEO of a million-dollar plus company creating jobs. She was the inspiration for our Make Mine a Million $ Business program.” ~Nell Marino. Today, the organization boasts a growing community of tens-of- thousands of women entrepreneurs utilizing an array of resources and tools to develop and grow their businesses. The organization announced a goal of helping one million woman-owned companies achieve $1,000,000 in revenues by 2010. In support of this goal, Count Me In established partnerships with American Express' OPEN credit card as well as the QVC network and Cisco Systems to provide marketing and technological support.\\"Make Mine a $Million,\\" Enterprising Women, 7(4).

It was then later published in the US by Atlus. The fighting system is different from other fighting games in that there are not a lot of directional inputs needed for moves. Instead, special moves are set by collecting \\"Bullets\\" and then activating them with the DS's touch screen. Story The story of Draglade takes place in a post-modern setting where the world's primary source of power is a form of energy called \\"Matter.\\" A piece of technology called a G-Con is capable of absorbing Matter and transforming it into a physical object. A weapon conjured by this means is called a Glade, which can emit a distinct sound when colliding with other objects. During the era that the events of Draglade take place, fighting using Glades is the world's most popular sport, called \\"Grapping.\\" The story follows four characters on their own individual quests become professional Grappers. Characters=Player characters=Hibito Element: Fire Glade Type: Sword Draglade Color: Red Hibito is a fiery youth who has idolized Grappers ever since he was saved by one as a young child from a wild variant. Against his grandfather's wishes, he journeys around the continent to take the Grap Exams and become a Major Grapper. He makes many fire-related puns. Guy Element: Lightning Glade Type: Fist Glade Color: Yellow Once known as the \\"Shadow Fist\\", Guy used to belong to a corrupt Grapper gang called the \\"Black Fang\\". Like the others, he abused the power of Dark Glades, but he eventually came to his senses and abandoned the dark power, severely hampering himself. He now takes the Grap Exams in order to train himself up to be able to fight and defeat the Black Fang. Kyle Element: Water Glade Type: Double-Sided Spear Glade Color: Blue Kyle's a pirate, son of the pirate Orca, who owns a large vessel known as the \\"Blue Whale\\". Orca has been tricked into working up a large debt, and Kyle ventures to become a Major Grapper so he can enter a Majors-only tournament with a cash-reward big enough to pay it off. Daichi Element: Earth Glade Type: Hammer Glade Color: Orange A kind young boy from Dolittle village, a place where the residents possess the unique ability to speak with animals (A reference to Doctor Dolittle). Daichi is one of two young people selected to take an important journey to help animals the world over, but only one can be selected. In order to prepare himself for the decisive match, he decides to train by taking the grap exam. Yuki Element: Wind Glade Type: Rapier Glade Color: Green A young man that Hibito meets on his journey. Yuki at first is kind and helpful, but eventually it is revealed that he is not confident in his own abilities. He is unfortunately led astray by the temptation of Dark Matter. But after his 2nd battle against Hibito, he realized the truth and destroyed the dark G-con. Gyamon Element: Poison Glade Type: Shadow Claw Glade Color: Violet A well known member of the \\"Black Fang\\" organization Guy used to be part of. In fact, he and Guy were considered two of the strongest grappers in the gang, and were rarely apart. He is commanded to find Guy and eliminate him for leaving, but instead he makes several attempts to persuade Guy back into the organization, claiming he misses \\"the good old days\\". Shelly Element: Ice Glade Type: Bow Glade Color: Periwinkle Shelly is a girl who seeks revenge for her brother, who wished to be a Major Grapper, but had his dreams destroyed when the \\"Black Fang\\" hurt him so badly he could never Grap again. She finds Guy and wishes to battle him to avenge her brother against the \\"Black Fang\\". She soon realizes that Guy may have changed his ways. Asuka Element: Flower Glade Type: Fan Glade Color: Pink Asuka is from the same village as Daichi and can thus also talk to animals. She was the second name chosen to represent her village, she aims to become a Major Grapper so she can prove she is most worthy to represent her village, she does not believe Daichi can handle the responsibility because he is too slow and kind. Zeke Element: Dark Element Color: Black Glade Type: Dual Sword Glade Zeke is a mysterious dark warrior that all the heroes encounter, he has great power and skill. He works for Mad Company, but is not truly interested in their goals. Once he has done what he was paid to do, he simply leaves. =Non player characters=Cross Element: Light Glade Type: Sword Glade Color: Green He was a legendary grapper that Hibito idolized. And he seemed like he was important when he met Hibito. It has said that the Hero of Light wields the blade to repel evil and summon clones of him. Not much was known about him ever since, but he does appear in the sequel. President D. Element: Dark Glade Type: Dark Draglade The CEO of the Mad Company and the game's main villain. He started Mad Company to study and work with Dark Matter, in hopes of creating the ultimate glade, the Dark Draglade. When the glade was completed, he activated its power, going insane in the process. After the player beats him once, he tries to get more power from the Dark Matter and became a giant monster, though he is returned to normal after the player character beats him a second time. Ultimately, he dies after his defeat by the effect of the Dark Matter. Pudding Element: Unknown Glade Type: Golem A young girl and boss of the DoraDora Dan. She appears in everyone's story but plays a much bigger role in Kyle's. When meeting her for the first time, she sends her servants to take out your character. Her company has made gun-type G- Cons which shoots out a golem type glade. Besides Kyle's story she cannot be fought because she has forgotten her G-Con. She hates being called a child or baby and claims she is mature.

McBride joined the New York City Ballet in 1959. She became a principal in 1961, becoming the company’s youngest principal. She danced with the company for 30 years, including roles created for her by choreographers George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins. New York City Ballet career In the 30 years she spent dancing with the company she had numerous roles created for her by George Balanchine such as: Hermia in A Midsummer Night's Dream; Tarantella; Colombine in Harlequinade; the ballerina role in the Intermezzo of the Brahms–Schoenberg Quartet; Rubies; Who Cares? (\\"The Man I Love\\" pas de deux and \\"Fascinatin' Rhythm\\" solo); Divertimento from Le Baiser de la Fée; Swanilda in Coppélia; Pavane; the paper ballerina in The Steadfast Tin Soldier; the Pearly Queen in Union Jack and the \\"Voices of Spring\\" section of Vienna Waltzes. Jerome Robbins created roles for McBride in Dances at a Gathering (pink), In the Night (third nocturne), The Goldberg Variations, The Four Seasons (fall) and Opus 19/The Dreamer, among other ballets. In 1979, she danced in Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme (ballet), a ballet based on the 1670 play by Molière. Her role was minor, and danced well, in contrast to that of Rudolf Nureyev and Jean‐Pierre Bonnefoux. The dance had been first choreographed by Balanchine, then picked up by Jerome Robbins. A review of the performance focussed on Nureyev's role, and how Nureyev was not becoming the character, in contrast to Bonnefoux, who did become his character as he danced. McBride was featured in the documentary film A Portrait of Giselle. Honors McBride was honored with a special performance of the City Ballet on June 4, 1989 at the New York State Theater at New York City's Lincoln Center on her retirement. McBride was recognized on December 7, 2014, as a Kennedy Center Honors recipient. North Carolina Dance Theatre McBride is the Associate Artistic Director and Master Teacher of Charlotte Ballet.

Opening with shots of aerial combat over Europe the film turns to footage of the airmen acting casually in their base in East Anglia, reading newspapers, playing ping pong, and listening to the radio. However, they are soon called for a debriefing about their next mission, a strike deep into Germany's industrial region, the Ruhr. They ready their planes and arrive over their targets like clockwork, shooting down some German Luftwaffe planes in the process. None of the missions have failed due to enemy resistance alone, the narrator informs the audience, though some have not succeeded because of weather conditions. Captured German footage is shown to prove that the enemy was just as determined to stop the attacks as the Allies were to carry them out. In February 1944 a new bombing initiative is begun. Instead of waiting to be attacked by the Germans the Americans will seek them out, targeting German airfields. Then the focus turns to enemy transportation, and the Allies make it impossible for a railroad to operate at day, also targeting trucks, barges, and even flak towers. All this made the eventual landings at Normandy and the opening of the second western front possible. With victory won in Europe, it must now be won in the Pacific. Two versions of the film were released. A short version, narrated by Ronald Reagan, was released to theatres with a running time of approximately 20 minutes. The complete version, with narration by Reed Hadley, runs 41 minutes.

Biography The brothers were born and raised in East Hickory, North Carolina, as the fourth and fifth siblings in a family of six children.McNeil 2005, p. 41.Bogdanov, Woodstra, Erlewine 2003, p. 70. Their parents, who were deeply religious and belonged to the First Church of God,Wolfe 2001, p. 99. taught them to sing hymns and gospel music. A neighbour taught Bill how to play guitar and banjo while Earl on the other hand learned to play mandolin and guitar. Eventually, they decided to switch instruments and Bill chose the mandolin while Earl concentrated on the guitar. They made their radio debut in 1935 at local radio station WWNC in Asheville, North Carolina as part of the \\"Crazy Hickory Nuts\\".Wolff 2000, p. 9. Sponsored by the \\"J. F. Goodson Coffee Company and together with Homer Sherrill of the \\"Crazy Hickory Nuts\\" they formed the \\"Good Coffee Boys\\" in the late 1935. Six months later, in June 1936, the Bolick brothers moved to Atlanta, Georgia to perform at radio station WGST.Erbsen 2003, p. 109. Because they were sponsored by the \\"Crazy Water Crystal\\", they had to perform using the name \\"(Crazy) Blue Ridge Hillbillies\\".Harkins 2005, p. 92. In Atlanta, the Bolick brothers went to RCA Records for an audition. At first, Eli Oberstein, the A & R man, was reluctant to hear the brothers sing, accusing them of copying the Monroe Brothers. He changed his mind when he heard them sing and immediately signed them to a recording contract.Wolfe 2001, p. 97. A discussion arose concerning what they should call themselves. Since they couldn't use the previous name \\"the Blue Ridge Hillbillies\\" - it had been taken by Homer Sherrill when the brothers left WGST - they decided to use \\"Blue Sky Boys\\" as their name. Their choice of name came from the nickname of western North Carolina: \\"Land of the Blue Sky\\".Wolfe 2001, p. 98. They made their first recordings in Charlotte, North Carolina on June 16, 1936. Their first record \\"Sunny Side of Life\\" coupled with \\"Where the Soul Never Dies\\" became an instant success. It sold so fast the brothers were dubbed \\"The New Hillbilly Kings.Wolfe 2001, p. 99. Between 1937 and 1941 the group recorded about 100 songs for RCA to considerable success on the hillbilly music circuit. Between 1941 and 1946 both brothers served in the military; after their discharges they returned to Atlanta and resumed recording with RCA. Some of their sides featured fiddle playing from Leslie Keith, Sam \\"Curly\\" Parker, Joe Tyson and Richard Hicks. They enjoyed a number of hits just after the war, but disliked the burgeoning honky tonk style and refused to record it. When RCA asked them to play with an electric guitar, they refused and stopped recording until 1949. Due to personal issues, the Blue Sky Boys retired in 1951. Bill became a postal clerk in his birth state and Earl took a job at Lockheed Aircraft in Atlanta. When Starday Records released an LP of their radio recordings in 1962, they decided to reunite and record again. Two LPs of new material followed, one secular (Together Again) and one religious (Precious Moments). They occasionally played live at folk festivals, and during a trip to California to perform at the UCLA Folk Festival, the brothers spent two days in the studio recording an album for Capitol Records. But by the end of the 1960s they had decided to call it quits again. Once more, in 1975, they were convinced to record again, this time for Rounder Records, and another round of folk and bluegrass circuit touring ensued. Following this, Bill moved back to his birthplace and lived in Longview, North Carolina, while Earl retired to Tucker, Georgia. In the 1990s, Copper Creek Records issued a series of four albums with live radio transcriptions from the 1940s.

Parker, Jr. Initially titled The Baltimore-Washington Wine Advocate the first issue was published in 1978. Accepting no advertising, the newsletter publishes in excess of 12,000 reviews per year, utilizing Parker's rating system that employs a 50–100 point quality scale (Parker Points® or simply RP).erobertparker.com The Wine Advocate Ratings System These wine ratings have a significant effect on the sales of the reviewed wine.Wine-searcher.com Robert Parker Scores and Wine Prices Background and history Robert Parker first developed an interest in wine on a trip to France while in college studying law. In the 1970s, Parker was influenced by the activist consumerism philosophy of Ralph Nader and saw in the wine industry a lack of independent wine criticism that was not sponsored by the distributors or wineries being reviewed. He released his first edition of The Baltimore-Washington Wine Advocate in 1978, originally as a complimentary bi-monthly feature.C. Platman \\"Emperor of Wine\\" Birmingham Post, May 31, 2006 It soon changed to a subscription periodical and by 1984 was successful enough that Parker could quit practicing law full-time and focus on wine reviews.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition p. 507 Oxford University Press 2006 Parker and The Wine Advocate first garnered international, mainstream attention for his early prediction of the superiority and quality of the 1982 vintage of Bordeaux wine. Parker's enthusiastic endorsement created a spike of interest from American wine buyers in purchasing wine futures of this vintage, prior to its release to the public. This had the effect of raising the price dramatically for 1982 Bordeaux wines. Subscriptions to The Wine Advocate continued to grow and by 1998 had more than 45,000 subscribers from 35 countries. In 2000, an online version of the magazine was introduced, eRobertParker.com, which expanded the publication beyond Wine Advocate content to include an interactive Bulletin Board managed by Mark Squires and many articles and features not available in the printed version. By 2012, subscribership had grown to about 50,000, with 80% of readers from in the United States. Transformation in 2012-2013 , many changes were announced concerning the management and format of The Wine Advocate following the sale of a majority stake in the publication to investors from Singapore. A transition from print to fully on-line distribution was announced, to take effect before the end of 2013. The role of editor-in-chief went from Parker to Lisa Perotti-Brown, a Singapore-based correspondent for the publication. A second editorial office was opened in Singapore. Following lead critic Antonio Galloni's departure from The Wine Advocate in February 2013, three new critics were recruited adding to what Robert Parker called his \\"Dream Team\\". Jeb Dunnuck joined the publication on April 3, 2013 followed by Monica Larner and Luis Gutiérrez on April 23, 2013. On 22 November, 2019 it was announced that Michelin Guide became the sole owner of The Wine Advocate. =Team of Reviewers= Starting in 2001, Parker started to delegate many of the world's wine regions to a team of critics. Joe Czerwinski reviews the wines of Provence, the Rhône Valley (North and South), Languedoc-Roussillon, Australia and New Zealand. Luis Gutiérrez (wine critic) covers the wines of Spain, Chile, the Jura and Argentina. Monica Larner is responsible for reviewing the wines of Italy.

The End of an Era: Robert Parker Stops Reviewing California Wine Previous Wine Advocate critics include Pierre Rovani, Jeb Dunnuck, Daniel Thomases, Jay Miller and Antonio Galloni. Influence on the wine industry While not the first American wine publication, nor the first to use a numerical wine ratings scale, The Wine Advocate was the first to widely adopt the 50-100 point scale and use it as parallel to the American educational grading system. This system was familiar to Robert Parker's original target audience—the average American consumer—and provided a guideline for quantifying a wine's quality in a standardize format. Retailers have used The Wine Advocate's \\"Parker scores\\" to aggressively market wines with high scores. The scores have also become focal points for collectors and wine investors who purchase highly rated wines in the hopes that the Parker scores will increase the value of the wine. Throughout various wine regions, most notably Bordeaux, The Wine Advocate early vintage evaluation-sampled while the wine is still in oak barrels—can have a dramatic effect on the eventual prices of all the region's wine upon their release.Murphy, Linda, San Francisco Chronicle (October 21, 2004) Robert Parker pops the corks on a dozen 100-point wines Individual scores of wine can also affect whether or not distributors or retailers will order the wine to sell with some retailers refusing to order wine rated below 85 points.Prial, Frank J., The New York Times (December 6, 1989) Wine Talk; When He Sips, Vintners Tremble Wine Advocate Fund The Wine Advocate also operates The Wine Advocate Fund For Philanthropy,wineadvocatefund.org Wine Advocate Fund for Philanthropy a nonprofit organization that raises money primarily for cancer research.

Robert Parker's Wine Advocate Fund Combats Cancer and Illiteracy with Daniel Boulud Criticisms The influence of The Wine Advocate on the demand and commercial interest of wine has met with some criticism, with wineries being accused of making wines tailored to Parker's tastes. In the late 1980s, wine expert Jancis Robinson noted that Parker and The Wine Advocate were \\"... in danger of controlling the international fine wine market\\". The subject of scoring of The Wine Advocate scoring has also been criticized by wine writers, such as Hugh Johnson, who stated that wine tasting and evaluation are intrinsically subjective, with the wine having the potential to dramatically change and evolve over time.

After beginning her career in concert singing and musical theatre, Wales joined the chorus of D'Oyly Carte in 1959, soon performing smaller roles. By 1963, she was performing a mix of small and larger roles, also understudying some of the larger mezzo-soprano roles. She continued to appear with the company until 1975, recording several of her roles. After this, she played in other Gilbert and Sullivan troupes and taught voice privately. Life and career Wales was born at Stockton-on-Tees, England to a musical family. She showed an interest in singing early on and studied voice with Roy Henderson. She joined the Stockton Stage Society, where she played the soubrette lead in musical theatre productions such as The New Moon, The Maid of the Mountains, The Student Prince and The Vagabond King. Early in her career, Wales performed in oratorio and musical theatre in the north of England. She joined the chorus of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1959. During her early years with the company, Wales performed the small roles of Isabel in The Pirates of Penzance, Leila in Iolanthe and occasionally Cousin Hebe in H.M.S. Pinafore. In 1961, when the company revived Princess Ida, Wales added the larger role of Melissa to her repertoire. She also occasionally performed the role of Phoebe Meryll in The Yeomen of the Guard. By 1963, she was also singing Hebe in Pinafore and Vittoria in The Gondoliers full-time and occasionally Lady Saphir in Patience, Pitti-Sing in The Mikado and Tessa in The Gondoliers. After Gillian Humphreys left the company in 1965, Wales moved up to the role of Kate in Pirates, took over the roles of First Bridesmaid in Trial by Jury, Saphir in Patience, Peep- Bo in The Mikado, Ruth in Ruddigore and Tessa in The Gondoliers, and continued performing the roles of Hebe, Leila and Melissa. As understudy, she also had the opportunity to play the title role in Iolanthe and Phoebe in Yeomen. She continued to perform most of these roles over the next decade. Wales left the D'Oyly Carte organisation in 1974 but returned at the end of the year to play Melissa in Princess Ida as a guest artiste during the Gilbert and Sullivan centenary London season. Later, she sang with The Magic of D'Oyly Carte, a Gilbert and Sullivan concert group; with the Gilbert and Sullivan for All touring company; as Mad Margaret in Ruddigore for Kent Opera in 1975; and in various \\"Together Again\\" concerts at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival. She taught singing in Radcliffe-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire, and also directed the Radcliffe Ladies Choir. During her time with D'Oyly Carte, Wales was married twice, first to chorister John Maguire in 1961, and then to principal bass-baritone Thomas Lawlor in 1971 (with whom she had a daughter, Frances), both of whom she divorced. Later she married Richard Howarth, the musical director of the Radcliffe-on-Trent Male Voice Choir. Wales died in Radcliffe-on-Trent in 2020 at the age of 82. Recordings and broadcasts With the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, Wales recorded her roles of Leila in Iolanthe (1960), Kate in Pirates (1968), Hebe in Pinafore (1971), and Peep-Bo in The Mikado (1973). She also is heard as Hebe and Pitti-Sing on \\"A Gilbert and Sullivan Spectacular\\" (1965) and as a soloist on the recording \\"Songs and Snatches\\" (1970). In 1965, Wales participated with other D'Oyly Carte artistes in a BBC television production of Patience, playing Lady Saphir. The following year, she appeared as Peep-Bo in the 1966 film version of The Mikado, and in 1973, she played Cousin Hebe in a televised production of H.M.S. Pinafore on ITV. She also participated in the live D'Oyly Carte broadcast of Iolanthe in 1961 as Leila.

The company sells pulse oximetry to hospitals. Masimo was founded in 1989 by electrical engineer Joe Kiani, who was later joined by fellow engineer Mohamed Diab. In March 2020, to support efforts to combat COVID-19, Masimo announced a number of noninvasive monitoring and single-patient-use solutions to help care teams manage the surge in patients, including Masimo SafetyNet. Masimo has been recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the medical device industry. In 2000, the Society for Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) awarded Masimo the Technology Excellence Award. Masimo went public in 2007 and is currently traded on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol MASI. In 2011, Forbes named Masimo to its list of top 20 public companies under a billion dollars in revenue. In 2012, Joe Kiani, founder, CEO and Chairman of the Board was named the Ernst & Young National Entrepreneur of the Year - 2012 Life Sciences Award Winner. Technology=Signal Extraction Technology (SET) pulse oximetry= True and false SpO2 alarm rate of Masimo SET versus 19 competing pulse oximetry technologies. The Masimo Radical-7 is a pulse oximeter that can also noninvasively measure a patient's hemoglobin and respiration rate. Masimo SET adhesive sensors monitor oxygenation, pulse rate and \\"special rainbow\\" sensors allow additional measurement of noninvasive blood constituents. Pulse oximetry uses two light emitting diodes (LEDs), one red and one infrared, to measure the absorption of light and translates that into the percentage of hemoglobin molecules that are bound with oxygen, which is called arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Conventional pulse oximetry assumes that arterial blood is the only blood moving (pulsating) in the measurement site. However, during patient motion, the venous blood also moves, which can cause conventional pulse oximetry to under-read SpO2 levels because it cannot distinguish between the arterial and venous blood. SET identifies the venous blood signal (which has a lower oxygen saturation level than arterial blood), isolates it, and uses adaptive filters to cancel the noise and extract the arterial signal in order to report accurate SpO2 and pulse rate. In addition, SET pulse oximetry provides perfusion index (PI) and pleth variability index (PVI). Multiple studies have shown that compared to non-SET pulse oximeters, SET increases the ability to detect life-threatening events and reduces false alarms during challenging conditions. Additional studies have also shown the impact of SET on patient outcomes, such as helping clinicians: :* Decrease retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in neonates :* Increase detection of critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in newborns :* Reduce ventilator weaning time by titrating FiO2 faster and reduce arterial blood gas measurements in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) :* Decrease rapid response activations and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) transfers to save lives and costs in post-surgical patients on the medical-surgical floors through earlier identification of patients in distress through low SpO2 and abnormal pulse rate measurements :* Decrease fluid administered during surgery and reduce patient risk In 2011, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommended mandatory screening for all newborns, using \\"motion- tolerant pulse oximeters that report functional oxygen saturation have been validated in low perfusion conditions\\". To make this recommendation, the CCHD workgroup relied on two independent studies that exclusively used SET pulse oximetry to assess newborns. In 2012, Masimo received FDA 510(k) clearance for devices and sensors with labeling for screening newborns for CCHD. It marked the first time the FDA cleared specific labeling indicating the use of pulse oximeters, in conjunction with a physical examination, to screen newborns for CCHD. In 2012, the National Health Service (NHS) Technology Adoption Centre in the United Kingdom advised hospitals to use Intraoperative Fluid Management, and included Masimo's PVI among technologies available for helping clinicians manage fluid during surgeries. In 2013, the French Society for Anaesthesia and Intensive Care (SFAR) added PVI to its guidelines for optimal hemodynamic management of surgical patients. = rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry = rainbow Pulse CO-Oximetry uses more than seven wavelengths of light to continuously and noninvasively measure hemoglobin (SpHb), carboxyhemoglobin (SpCO), and methemoglobin (SpMet), in addition to oxygen saturation (SpO2), pulse rate, perfusion index (Pi), and pleth variability index (PVi). A study at Massachusetts General Hospital showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians decrease the frequency of patients receiving blood transfusions during surgery from 4.5% to 0.6%. Another study from Cairo University showed that SpHb monitoring helped clinicians reduce blood transfusions in high blood loss surgery by an average of 0.9 units per patient. A study at CHU Limoges in France found that monitoring with SpHb and PVi, integrated into a hospital- wide fluid and blood administration protocol, was associated with earlier transfusion and reduced mortality at 30 and 90 days by 33% and 29%, respectively. Emergency department studies have shown that SpCO helps clinicians increase the detection of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning and decreases the time to treatment compared to invasive methods. The Pronto-7 device for noninvasive spot checking of hemoglobin, along with SpO2 and pulse rate, has been recognized with a gold Medical Design Excellence Award. The World Health Organization called noninvasive hemoglobin an \\"innovative medical technology for cost-effectively addressing global health concerns and needs\\". In October 2014, Masimo announced CE Mark of Oxygen Reserve Index or ORi, the company's 11th noninvasive parameter, which provides real-time visibility to oxygenation status. ORi is intended to supplement, not replace, oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring and partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) measurements. ORi can be trended and has optional alarms to notify clinicians of changes in a patient's oxygen reserve, and may enable proactive interventions to avoid hypoxia and unintended hyperoxia. Noninvasive Patient Monitoring=Patient SafetyNet= Patient SafetyNet is a remote monitoring and notification system designed for patients on medical/surgical care floors. A large study by Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center showed Patient SafetyNet helped clinicians achieve a 65% reduction in distress codes and rescue activations and a 48% decrease in patient transfers to intensive care units (ICU), yielding a savings of 135 Intensive Care Unit (ICU) days annually for an annual opportunity-cost savings of $1.48 million. In 2020, Dartmouth- Hitchcock published a retrospective study showing that over ten years of using Patient SafetyNet, there were zero patient deaths and no patients were harmed by opioid-induced respiratory depression while continuous monitoring with Masimo SET was in use. ECRI Institute gave Dartmouth its Health Devices Achievement Award for its use of Patient SafetyNet to prevent \\"severe patient harm\\". Masimo has introduced Halo ION in the Patient SafetyNet system, combining multiple physiologic parameters into one number to help clinicians assess overall patient status. =Rainbow acoustic monitoring= Rainbow acoustic monitoring provides noninvasive and continuous measurement of respiration rate using an adhesive sensor with an integrated acoustic transducer that is applied to the patient's neck. Researchers have evaluated acoustic respiration rate (RRa) and found the acceptable accuracy and significantly fewer false alarms than traditional respiration rate monitoring methods, end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) and impedance pneumography. =SedLine brain function monitoring= In 2010, Masimo began offering brain function monitoring to measure the effects of anesthesia and sedation by monitoring both sides of the brain's electrical activity (EEG). Studies have shown this results in more individualized titration and improved care. =Capnography and gas monitoring= In 2012, Masimo began offering ultra- compact mainstream and sidestream capnography as well as multigas analyzers for end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), oxygen (O2), and anesthetic agents, for use in the operating room, procedural sedation, and in intensive care units (ICU). A multi-center study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University Medical Center (Tucson, Arizona), and Children's Medical Center (Dallas), found that respiratory rate measured from noninvasive, acoustic monitoring had similar accuracy and precision as nasal capnography, the current standard of care when used in pediatric patients. = Masimo SafetyNet = In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Masimo introduced Masimo SafetyNet for the smartphone. In addition to helping combat COVID-19, Masimo SafetyNet can also be configured to help clinicians create, relay, and manage treatment plans for more than 150 other health needs. Radius-7 On December 1, 2014, Masimo announced FDA 510(k) clearance of Radius-7 for the Root patient monitoring and connectivity platform, the first and only wearable, wireless monitor with Masimo's rainbow SET technology, enabling early identification of clinical deterioration while offering patients continuous monitoring with freedom of movement. Radius-7 attaches to the patient's arm or can be placed alongside the patient in their bed, allowing untethered monitoring. Studies have shown that patient mobility is a key factor in more rapid patient recovery.Needham D, Korupolu R, Zanni J, Pradhan P, Colantuoni E, Palmer J, Brower R, Fan E. \\"Early Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation for Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure: A Quality Improvement Project.\\" Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Vol 91, Issue 4, PP 536–542, April 2010 =iSpO2 pulse oximeter for smart phones and tablets= iSpO2 pulse oximeter was awarded the Hot Product Award at the 2013 EMS Today Conference & Exposition. Supported Causes=Clinton Global Initiative= In 2012, Masimo embarked on its first Commitment to Action with the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) to solve the global problem of maternal mortality and anemia. The $1 million, two-year project initially focuses on five villages in Liberia and Uganda – two countries where the epidemics of maternal mortality and anemia are among the worst. =Patient Safety Movement Foundation= In 2013, Masimo Founder, CEO, and Chairman Joe Kiani, in conjunction with the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation, and Competition in Healthcare, founded the nonprofit Patient Safety Movement Foundation with a mission to eliminate the more than 200,000 preventable patient deaths that occur in U.S. hospitals each year. The foundation holds annual Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summits, featuring leaders from healthcare, industry, and government; former President Bill Clinton has served as a frequent keynote speaker. In 2020, the Patient Safety Movement Foundation was awarded a $5 million, five-year grant from the Masimo Foundation to help advance its mission and expedite its efforts.

It is administered by BJC HealthCare, based in St. Louis, Missouri. The hospital is a regional referral center, providing services to 25 Mid- Missouri counties. It employs over 2000 people, making it one of the largest employers in Columbia. History Built in 1921, the original Boone County Hospital was a 40-bed facility serving the citizens of Boone and surrounding counties. Due to increased demand, an addition to the facility was opened in 1954, called the Nifong Wing, after Dr. Frank Nifong, a prominent Columbia physician and fundraiser for the hospital. Voters also agreed in 1955 to fund a $3 million, 200-bed expansion that was completed in 1959. This new 6-story east wing brought the total number of patient beds to 250. By 1962, the hospital had an average of 158 patients every day within the facility and space was becoming an issue. In 1973, a new 4-story patient care tower that added much needed space for patients as well as additional parking for visitors was completed. Its top 2 floors remained unfinished until funds were available. In 1974, workers began $290,000 worth of remodeling in the hospital wing, updating crucial aspects of the facility infrastructure. Also completed in 1974 was a 16-bed psychiatric unit staffed by 6 specially trained nurses, which opened on the 2nd floor. This facility operated until 2008, when an economic downturn forced employee layoffs. In 1975, Boone County Hospital made great strides in the ground-breaking field of nuclear medicine with the purchase of two pieces of supplementary equipment for its \\"gamma camera.\\" Thanks to this new acquisition doctors were able to get clear images of internal organs through the use of radioisotope solution injections. Shortly thereafter, it was announced that Boone County Hospital would be one of the first facilities in the nation to acquire a whole body scanner, which represented the very latest in radiological diagnosis. A 2-story wing was added in 1978. This housed radiology, surgery, diagnostic treatment, emergency care and obstetrics. In addition, the top 2 floors of the patient tower were completed, along with 120 new parking spaces and 2 new elevators. In 1982, Boone Hospital Center opened a clinic in Centralia, Missouri to better serve the residents of northern Boone County. Boone's board of trustees voted in 1988 to approve a 10-year lease agreement with Christian Health Services, thereby relinquishing county government's central role in the hospital's operation yet maintaining ownership of the plant and property. In 1993, Christian Health Services merged with Barnes and Jewish hospitals in St. Louis to form Barnes-Jewish-Christian Healthcare (BJC). In 2006, the board of trustees voted to continue the lease agreement with BJC Healthcare through 2015. In 1990, the hospital's trustees purchased of land across Broadway in Stephens Park and unveiled an ambitious long-range expansion plan for the existing hospital facility as well as the . The first phase of the plan remodeled the front entrance and lobby, created a new out-patient surgery waiting area, cardiac catheterization facilities and a women's health center. Medical office buildings were constructed on the property to the north of the hospital, called the Broadway Medical Plaza, and were connected to the hospital by a covered pedestrian walkway that now spanning Broadway. In 2005, the hospital became the first facility in Mid-Missouri to receive the Magnet designation from the American Nurses Credentialing Center, and it also was honored as one of the nation's \\"Top 100 Hospitals\\" by Thomson Reuters in 2010. The Wound Clinic at BHC received two hyperbaric chambers in 2008. Previously, the University of Missouri Hospital had the only hyperbaric chambers in mid- Missouri The patient care tower currently under construction Completed construction and new main entrance In 2009, the hospital opened the Spine Center, a specialized-care unit on the 5th floor. The facility features 20 private rooms, a room for physical and occupational therapy, a family/relaxation room, a redesigned nurses’ station, and a classroom for pre- operation classes. The project cost $1.8 million and was paid for with hospital operating funds. Boone Hospital Center completed a 940-space parking garage on its west side in 2010 and broke ground on a new 7-story, 128-room patient tower. The entire project, including landscaping along William Street, will cost about $125 million. BHC funded the project by selling $100 million in municipal bonds, and the remaining $25 million will be paid for by funds designated by the hospital's Board of Trustees. The tower was finished in spring 2011. In 2010, Boone Hospital Center unveiled the first \\"high-field\\" open MRI machine in Mid-Missouri. This machine can be used for patients too large to fit into a traditional closed MRI or those who suffer from claustrophobia issues. Emergency services Boone Hospital operates 5 ambulances in Boone County. They are located at bases in Centralia, the northeast side of Columbia, the north-central side of Columbia, the southeast side of Columbia, and on the Boone Hospital grounds. They, along with the University of Missouri Hospital ambulance service, provide emergency care for the entire county.

Many of Naugatuck's citizens who supported independence from British rule during the Revolutionary War are buried in the cemetery. The cemetery is also considered by many to be haunted.  The Gunns  The history of the Gunn family has been traced to before the colony of Connecticut. The first to arrive to Connecticut was Scottish-born Jasper Gunn (1606-1670).Jasper Gunn His first journey was from London to Boston on October 8, 1635. He and his wife then made their way to Roxbury, CT. Looking to start his own small colony, Jasper, with several other families from Roxbury and Dorchester, purchased even more land from the local Indians. Then on November 24, 1640, this area was named the town of Milford. Being considered one of the founders of Milford, Jasper Gunn was also considered to be Milford's first physician. After living in Milford for a while, he and his family moved around Connecticut a few times; in 1647 they moved to Harford. Along with being a doctor, Jasper Gunn did many other things. He was also a deacon at the church in Milford, a lawyer (for a few cases), and sealer of weights and measures. With all his life experience, he was made the main operator at Hartford’s Mill from 1649 to 1658. At his death in 1670, he and his wife Christian had seven children. His decedents have since spread throughout Connecticut, including Naugatuck. The area that was once called Gunntown is an 800-acre area located just off of Naugatuck’s Rubber Ave Ext. The Gunn family was said to have lived and operated a sawmill in this area sometime around the 1740s. The Gunntown cemetery lies somewhat in the middle of area, with many people buried there bearing the same name. Haunted reputation Connecticut demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren declared the cemetery to be \\"officially haunted\\". The most frequently reported phenomenon there is the sound of children's laughter and music that begins in the surrounding woods, then closes in on the listener until it seems to be inside the cemetery. Some people have also seen a solid black dog near the cemetery. Some feel that this is a foreboding sign of death. Sometimes a person clearly sees the black dog in the cemetery but his or her companions see nothing. There have also been reported cases of people hearing a large dog running towards them, but seeing nothing. orb is supposedly seen in the background. Many photographs that have been taken at the cemetery are purported to show spirit energy in the form of orbs, globules or ectoplasmic mist. On rare occasions, visitors have claimed to see colorful orbs flitting about the grounds with the naked eye.Cheri Revai. Haunted Connecticut.

History Foley's original idea for the book was a more behind the scenes look into Vince McMahon and the lead-up to WrestleMania. Foley, however, thought it would be difficult to write about the event without actually having a match in it, so he opted to write a journal-entry based book instead. Content The book is the third installment of Mick Foley's autobiographical series and begins where the first two books – Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks and Foley Is Good: And the Real World Is Faker than Wrestling – leave off. Unlike his other two books, The Hardcore Diaries is set up in a journal or diary-type format. He focuses mainly on his involvement with WWE in 2006, including his match at One Night Stand with Edge against Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamer. It also includes the creative process surrounding the match. Some of the topics Foley also talks about are his trips with WWE to Iraq and Afghanistan and his work with the Christian Children's Fund, as well as talking about his sons Mickey and Hughie who were born since Foley finished writing Foley Is Good in 2001 and 2003. He also mentions considering joining Total Nonstop Action Wrestling at the behest of his friend Scott Levy in 2005. He also does not shy away from criticizing WWE management.

He was the co- founder, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter for the American rock band Tommy Tutone based in San Francisco, California, and was co-writer of that band's most famous single, 867-5309/Jenny. Since 1992, Keller has worked with Philip Glass, first running Glass's publishing company and eventually managing his career as director of Dunvagen Music. In 1999, Keller founded St. Rose Music as a publishing and management company for friends and associates. Their roster has grown to include Nico Muhly, Rachel Portman, Angélica Negrón, the music theater works of Tom Waits, Jeff Beal, Paul Leonard-Morgan, Ravi Shankar, and Anoushka Shankar. In 1978, Jim Keller and Tommy Heath began playing around the greater San Francisco area with a variety of backup musicians under the billing Tommy Tutone. By 1979, Tommy and Jim were invited to play a label showcase that brought the attention of the Warner Bros. record label. They entered the studio with bassist Terry Nails and drummer Micky Shine to record the band's first album, Tommy Tutone. Three singles were released including Angel Say No which peaked at No. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 Charts. In early 1981, the band had begun recording their second LP, when Keller approached Heath with a song he had co-written with former Clover frontman Alex Call. Neither expected that the song would become a hit. In 1982, the song was number 4 on the Billboard charts for 27 weeks. After the band's third album, National Emotion, failed to produce a hit single, they went their separate ways. For several years, Keller played in bands, wrote jingles, and helped friends and colleagues with music publishing. Keller stopped performing and recording in 1994. A project around that time had led him to calling Philip Glass's office. When he called a second time the person he'd been speaking with had left the company. He asked if they were looking to replace him which landed Keller an interview. Glass recalled in The New Yorker, \\"he had none of the conventional qualifications that I thought someone should have. I asked, ‘What do you know about the music business?,’ and he said, ‘Only what I learned on the street,’ but that’s how I learned, so it didn’t sound bad to me. He said, ‘What did you pay the last guy?,’ and I told him, and he said, ‘I’ll come and work for you for that, and, if I double your income in the first year, you’ll double my salary.’ I thought about that for about thirty seconds, and I realized, That could be great for me, and he did it.” After a ten-year hiatus, Keller began writing songs and performing again in 2005. He has recorded three solo albums since he left Tommy Tutone, including Sunshine in my Pocket (2009), Soul Candy (2011), and Heaven Can Wait (2014). He has a new record, produced by Mitchell Froom, slated for release in February 2021. He continues to play regularly with the Jim Keller Band.

It was developed by Vicarious Visions, published by Activision, and released in June 2007 in North America, and July 2007 worldwide. The game is a Nintendo DS port of Transformers: The Game, and, unlike it, features only one campaign, focused entirerly on the Decepticons; instead, a separate game, Transformers: Autobots, which focuses entirerly on the Autobots, was developed in parallel with Decepticons and was also released in 2007. While mostly similar to Decepticons, it has several missions taking place in the Arctic, replacing Decepticons' missions set at a desert military base in Qatar. Gameplay The game consists of four virtual locations, semi-destructible environments and enemies in the form of local law enforcement and opposing Transformers. Only cars and other robots may be destroyed. \\"Hazard levels\\" denote the extent of attack the player character comes under based on how much destruction they perpetrate. Glowing spots on the map denote mission markers, which come in two varieties - twenty-three story missions, which further the game storyline, and thirty-four challenge missions, for players to test their skills. The game also features a slight RPG element in the form of XP, gained by destroying enemies and completing missions, which steadily increases players' levels (up to 20), unlocking new abilities and increasing stats. While a select number of missions allow players to take control of five of the Autobots or Decepticons featured in the movie, for the majority of the game, the player will control the \\"Create-A-Bot,\\" a customizable generic Transformer whose alternate mode the player can determine by scanning any one of over thirty-seven vehicles found throughout the game locations. The games utilizes the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for the \\"AllSpark Wars\\" online campaign, which pits players of the two different versions of the game against each other. Players are able to download one new special single player challenge each day and earn points upon its completion. Their score is then uploaded to a server at the end of the challenge and the side with the most points at the end of the day (Autobots or Decepticons) wins the \\"battle\\". The first side to win seven battles wins the overall \\"war\\" and a new war begins. However, if the Autobots and Decepticons win at least one piece each, a \\"tiebreaker match\\" will be played until the whole Allspark is under control of either side. Players earn Wi-Fi tokens for their involvement, which will unlock additional vehicles and cheats for use while playing the main game. Despite the aforementioned Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection support, multiplayer death-matches are limited to localized wireless play. Synopsis= Setting = The game focuses on the eponymus Transformers, a race of extraterrestrials from the planet Cybertron who resemble robots and can change their form into various vehicles, such as tanks or jets. The Transformers are divided into two factions, the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, and arrived on Earth following a civil war that left their home planet a deserted and lifeless place. Forced to disguise themselves by taking the form of human vehicles, the Transformers soon reenact their past conflict upon learning that the AllSpark, a powerful artifact and the source of all Transformer life, is on Earth; while the Decepticons seek its power to subjugate the Earth, the Autobots attempt to save the planet from this threat and make peace with mankind. =Characters= * Create-A-Bot (voiced by Steven Blum) - the player's custom-made character, who serves as a new Decepticon recruit and Starscream's protégé. *Megatron (voiced by Frank Welker) - the leader of the Decepticons, who was frozen in ice after tracking the AllSpark to Earth. He transforms into a Cybertronian jet. * Barricade (voiced by Keith David) - the leader of a Decepticon team investigating the Decepticon signal that originated from Earth. He serves as a mentor figure to the Create-A-Bot and wishes to find Megatron and remove Starscream from power. He transforms into a Ford Mustang Saleen S281E police car. * Blackout (voiced by Noah Nelson) - a polite member of Barricade's team who turns into a Sikorsky MH-53 Pave Low helicopter. * Brawl (voiced by David Sobolov) - a destructive, yet childish member of Barricade's team who turns into a modified M1 Abrams tank. * Starscream (voiced by Daniel Ross) - the second-in-command of the Decepticons who seeks to find the AllSpark and become leader of the Decepticons. He transforms into a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor jet. =Plot= Starscream sends his protégé, the \\"Create-A-Bot\\", to Earth to help Barricade investigate a faint Decepticon signal they received. After Create-A-Bot undergoes a basic systems check, under Barricade's coordination, they encounter a group of Autobots in the area, including the Create-A-Bot from Transformers Autobots, whom he destroys. He is then called to Tranquility and tasked with helping Barricade find the Autobot Bumblebee, who has information regarding Megatron, and whom they discover has learned from a news article about a frozen \\"giant metal man\\" found in the Arctic. The Create-A-Bot then relays this information to Starscream, who encourages him to earn Barricade's trust. While Create-A-Bot distracts the local police, Barricade finds and fights Bumblebee, defeating him and retrieving the information from him. It is revealed that a human military organization called Sector 7 had Megatron imprisoned at a base in the Arctic, but moved him to an unknown location, and that a file called \\"Project: Ice Man\\" has information regarding Megatron's current location. Blackout and Create-A-Bot next head to a SOCCENT Military Base in Qatar, where they rendezvous with Brawl, who helps Create-A-Bot attack the airfield as a distraction, while Blackout cuts off communications and hacks into the humans' network to find the \\"Project: Ice Man\\" file. The Autobot Ratchet shows up with reinforcements, but is defeated and flees Create-A-Bot the relays the information they found to Starscream, who informs him that Megatron and the AllSpark are on Earth, Megatron having followed it here years ago. Starscream encourages the Create-A-Bot not to tell anyone about the AllSpark being on Earth, claiming he wants to secure it and avoid having to fight with anyone else over it. Back in Tranquility, Blackout discovers that Sector 7 has set up automated defenses made from Megatron's technology all over town, whom Create-A-Bot destroys, while Barricade uses the town's power plant to get enough energy to crack the file. After Brawl shields the plant's generators from Sector 7, Optimus Prime arrives on Earth with more Autobots. Create-A-Bot distracts them to give Barricade more time, culminating with him defeating Bumblebee and leaving him to be captured by Sector 7. Barricade then learns that the \\"ice man\\" described in the file is Megatron, who is being held at the Hoover Dam. The Decepticons attack the dam, with Brawl destroying several communication satellites and planting bombs as a contingency plan, while Starscream orders the Create-A-Bot to kill Megatron before Barricade can revive him. Troubled by these orders, Create-A-Bot relays them to his fellow Decepticons, who realize that Starscream wants to secure the AllSpark to ensure that no one can challenge him. Meanwhile, Barricade attacks a military base near the dam and finds a way inside after learning that Sector 7 joined forces with the Autobots. With Blackout's help, Barricade infiltrates the dam and finds that Sector 7 has kept Megatron frozen to study his technology, before unfreezing him. With Megatron alive and leading the Decepticons once again, he vows to kill Starscream for his treachery and gives an inspiring speech to his followers, before Brawl arrives with the news that the Autobots have taken the AllSpark to Tranquility. The Decepticons attack the city, though Megatron is ambushed by Jazz, who disposed of the bombs Brawl planted earlier, and whom Megatron swiftly kills after a brief fight. In Tranquility, the Decepticons kill most of the Autobots, with Brawl taking down Ironhide, and Starscream eliminating Bumblebee. Blackout and Barricade then attempt to arrest Starscream, but he kills them both and escapes, despite Create-A-Bot's attempt to stop him. Elsewhere, Megatron battles and kills Optimus, before Starscream arrives and challenges him for leadership of the Decepticons. Alongside Create-A-Bot, Megatron pursues him to the casino strip where the former landed on Earth. Create-A-Bot attempts to kill Starscream by shoving the AllSpark into his chest, mortally wounding himself in the process, but to no avail. Megatron ultimately kills Starscream on his own, before executing the wounded Create-A-Bot, as he is no longer useful in his current state. With most of his troops dead, Megatron then transforms into a jet and flies off into the night sky, his destination unknown. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

It has been a strong supporter of Irish unionism and has had close links with the Ulster Unionist Party, which governed Northern Ireland from 1922 to 1972. The Institution has lodges throughout Ireland, although it is strongest in the North. There are also branches throughout the British Commonwealth (especially in Scotland and Canada), and in the United States. In the 20th century, the Institution went into sharp decline outside Northern Ireland and County Donegal. Observers have accused the Orange Institution of being a sectarian organisation, due to its goals and its exclusion of Roman Catholics and close relatives of Catholics as members.\\"... No catholic and no one whose close relatives are catholic may be a member.\\" Northern Ireland The Orange State, Michael Farrell; ; The Orange marches The Order has a substantial fraternal and benevolent component.Tim Pat Coogan, 1916: The Easter Rising, Phoenix, 2001, , p. 14 Background William III (\\"William of Orange\\") King of England, Scotland and Ireland, Stadtholder of the Netherlands The Orange Order arose out of the divisions between Catholics and Protestants in Ireland. Sixteenth century attempts by the English to impose Protestantism on the Irish had been largely unsuccessful, and so the Irish-speaking majority in Ireland, consisting of Gaelic Irish and the descendants of medieval Hiberno-Norman settlers, remained Catholic, in contrast to the post-Reformation Planters from Britain, who were mostly Protestant. In the early seventeenth century the English, partly in response to an uprising based in Ulster, settled large numbers of English and Scottish Protestants in the province, a process known as the Plantation of Ulster. Hiram Morgan \\"O'Doherty, Sir Cahir\\" The Oxford Companion to Irish History. S.J. Connolly. Oxford University Press, 2007; Hiram Morgan \\"Ulster plantation\\" The Oxford Companion to Irish History. S.J. Connolly. Oxford University Press, 2007. This changed Ulster from the most Catholic and Gaelic of the four Irish provinces\\"Ulster\\" A Dictionary of British History. Ed. John Cannon. Oxford University Press, 2001. to the most Protestant and British, although many Catholics remained. The two communities feared and resented each other, and when James II of England was overthrown by William of Orange in 1688 most Irish Catholics (in Ulster and elsewhere) continued to support James while the Protestants supported William. After initially fleeing to France, James arrived in Ireland in 1689 with French troops and money provided by Louis XIV, who was at war with William. James' supporters (Jacobites) controlled most of Ireland, with the exception of Ulster. Here the Protestants held out for William, especially at Enniskillen and Derry, which were besieged by Jacobite forces. General Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg and a small army were sent by William to Ireland, but they failed to make progress against the Jacobites. In 1690 William came to Ireland himself, and soon defeated James in the Battle of the Boyne. James fled again to France and although the Williamite War in Ireland was not resolved until the following year, William had achieved a decisive victory over James. In England, William's overthrow of James is remembered as the Glorious Revolution, so-called because in that country there was little bloodshed, and because it established significant limits on royal power. For many years the Revolution was seen as a major turning point in English and world history,Jeremy Black \\"Glorious Revolution\\" Encyclopedia of the Enlightenment. Ed. Alan Charles Kors. Oxford University Press 2003. as an important step towards democracy and against arbitrary government. In Ireland, William's victory signalled the beginning of the Protestant Ascendancy. Although the Treaty of Limerick negotiated at the end of the war was in some ways generous towards the defeated Catholics,Bruce Philip Lenman \\"Limerick, treaty of\\" The Oxford Companion to British History. Ed. John Cannon. Oxford University Press, 1997. it was not properly ratified and was repeatedly broken by the Protestant-controlled Parliament of Ireland. Ironically, the increased powers won for parliament in the Revolution meant that William was unable to prevent it from overturning the promises he had made in the Treaty.S.J. Connolly, 'The Penal Laws', in W.A. Maguire, ed., Kings in Conflict: The Revolutionary War in Ireland and its Aftermath, 1689–1750, Belfast, 1990, pp.160–1. The subsequent Penal Laws barred Irish Catholics from most aspects of public life and reduced many to poverty.\\"penal laws\\" The Oxford Companion to Irish History. S. J. Connolly. Oxford University Press, 2007. Although there were no uprisings or wars in Ireland in the hundred years after the Battle of the Boyne, there continued to be tension and some conflict between the Protestant and Catholic communities. Foundation of the Order Under the influence of the United Irishmen according to T. A. Jackson, political unity was replacing sectarian divisions in Ulster. This he says inspired \\"public-spirited zeal\\" in Catholic areas with areas like Armagh where the population had been evenly divided and the scene of sporadic violence between the Peep O'Day Boys and Catholic Defenders for years dying down to nothing under the influence of the United Irish. However, with the arrival of the new pro-Catholic Viceroy, Earl Fitzwilliam the Peep of Day boys resumed their activity after nearly a two-year absence. Jackson suggests that it is impossible to miss the connection between this fact, and the lie propagated by the Clare-Beresford faction that Fitzwilliam was there to replace the Protestant ascendancy with a Catholic one. With Defenders, again in action, he says, every successful defence against Peep of Day attack being then portrayed as a \\"Catholic outrage.\\" This \\"artificially worked-up pogrom\\" would culminate in what came to be known as the Battle of the Diamond.Ireland Her Own, T. A. Jackson, Lawrence & Wishart, Fp 1947, Rp 1991, pg. 142-5 In the aftermath of the \\"battle\\" which occurred on 21 September 1795 the Orange Society was founded, with the first Orange lodge established in Dyan, County Tyrone. Its first grand master was James Sloan of Loughgall, in whose inn the victory by the Peep O'Day Boys was celebrated.A New Dictionary of Irish History from 1800, D.J. Hickey & J.E. Doherty, Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 2003, pg375 According to Robert Kee, the Peep O'Day Boys would reorganise under the name the Orange Society, which he described as a crude organisation at the time.Robert Kee, Vol I, pg.71. However, Ruth Dudley-Edwards has stated that, \\"The traditional belief that Peep O' Day Boys founded the Orange Order ... does not bear scrutiny.\\"Ruth Dudley Edwards: The Faithful Tribe, page 220. Harper Collins, London, 2000. Dudley-Edwards, Mervyn Jess and Colonel Robert Hugh Wallace, a former Grand Master of the Belfast Orangemen, have suggested that the Orange BoysAfter Protestant homes were attacked in Benburb, County Tyrone, on 24 June 1794, Freemason James Wilson, asked his fellow masons to help defend vulnerable Protestants. After being refused he left the Freemasons claiming that he \\"would light a star .... which would eclipse them forever\\". He had already organised the Orange Boys at the Dyan (County Tyrone) in 1792, as is evidenced by the notice in the Belfast News Letter on 1 February 1793, which referred to a meeting of the 138 members of the Orange Boys held on 22 January 1793.\\" The Orange Boys Wallace writes, were predominantly Presbyterian. William Blacker, Robert Hugh Wallace, The formation of the Orange Order, 1795–1798: Education Committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, 1994 , Pg 49 and the Volunteers seem to have been the true forerunners of the Orange Institution.Ruth Dudley Edwards: The Faithful Tribe, pages 220 and 227–228.

Dublin, 2007William Blacker, Robert Hugh Wallace, The formation of the Orange Order, 1795–1798: Education Committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, 1994 , Pg25. Wallace states the Peep O' Day Boys were never a properly organised group and moreover continued to operate of their own accord after the formation of the Orange Institution.William Blacker, Robert Hugh Wallace, The formation of the Orange Order, 1795–1798: Education Committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, 1994 , Pg 126,78 James Wilson was joined by Daniel Winter and James Sloan. The infant Orange Order according to Wallace, had both Presbyterian and Anglican members.William Blacker, Robert Hugh Wallace, The formation of the Orange Order, 1795–1798: Education Committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, 1994 , Pg 49 The colour orange had long been a popular symbol with which to celebrate the victory of William of Orange over James II a century before. The Orange Order proper was founded in Loughgall in County Armagh 21 September 1795 in the aftermath of this Battle of the Diamond.Ireland Her Own, T. A. Jackson, Lawrence & Wishart, Fp 1947, Rp 1991, pg. 145 Many of the Orange Order's terms and language are derived from Freemasonry (e.g. lodge, grand master, and degrees.) The two movements have since grown apart; today the highest bodies in Freemasonry specifically deny any connection between the two institutions. Early years Much of the Order's early activities involved opposition to the Society of United Irishmen, a revolutionary organisation set up to abolish sectarian distinctions and to create an independent Irish republic. It was composed of Anglicans, Dissenters (i.e., non-Anglican Protestants, mainly Presbyterian), and Roman Catholics. The United Irishmen were violently opposed by the Orange Order. The Governor of Armagh, Lord Gosford, gave his opinion of the late 18th century disturbances to a meeting of magistrates: \\"It is no secret that a persecution is now raging in this country... the only crime is... profession of the Roman Catholic faith. Lawless banditti have constituted themselves judges...\\" According to Col. R.H. Wallace, whoever the Governor believed were the \\"lawless banditti\\" they could not have been Orangemen as there were no lodges in existence at the time of his speech.William Blacker, Robert Hugh Wallace, The formation of the Orange Order, 1795–1798: Education Committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, 1994 , Pg 37 Against the background of the seditious activity of the United Irishmen, the government backed the Orange Order from 1796. Thomas Knox, British military commander in Ulster, wrote in August 1796, \\"We must to a certain degree uphold them, for with all their licentiousness, on them we must rely for the preservation of our lives and properties should critical times occur.\\" The Order spread rapidly in mid-Ulster and many Orangemen found their way into the government militia and Yeomanry. For their part, the United Irishmen exacerbated Catholic fear of the Order by spreading fabricated rumours of an \\"Orange extermination oath\\" to massacre all Catholics. Nevertheless, Protestant factions did expel up to 7000 Catholics from their homes in this period and by 1797, Henry Joy McCracken, the United Irish leader, was receiving word of the \\"barbarities committed on the country people in Moneymore, County Londonderry, by the Yeomen and Orangemen.\\" Orange historians state that the first Orangemen did not sympathise with the Peep of Day Boys or \\"wreckers\\" (of Catholic homes and churches) and never allowed them to join the Orange Institution.William Blacker, Robert Hugh Wallace, The formation of the Orange Order, 1795–1798: Education Committee of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland, 1994 , Pg126. Others have stated that some Peep of Day Boys might have \\"slipped through the net\\"Mervyn Jess. The Orange Order, page 20. The O'Brian Press Ltd. Dublin, 2007 but if so they found themselves in a vastly different organisation.Mervyn Jess. The Orange Order, page 18. The O'Brian Press Ltd. Dublin, 2007 Many Orangemen fought on the government side in the subsequent Irish Rebellion of 1798. Moreover, there were accusations that the Institution was involved in reprisal attacks after the rebellion, in which over 60 Catholic churches were burned. However Orange historians would point out that in County Antrim Orangemen were among the first to contribute money to a repair fund for a Catholic chapel damaged in the violence.Ruth Dudley Edwards: The Faithful Tribe, pages 236–237. Harper Collin, London, 2000. Anti-Catholic actions were fuelled by rebel atrocities against Protestants, such as the Scullabogue Barn massacre. In the wake of the rebellion, once its usefulness had passed, the Orange Order was once again seen by the authorities primarily as a threat to public order. By the early 19th century, the Order had spread outside Ireland, reaching England in 1807. In some areas, particularly around Liverpool, it was used by the Tories against the Liberals. The Order also spread to the United States, and Tim Pat Coogan argues that it \\"manifested itself\\" in movements as the Know Nothings and the Ku Klux Klan, and also proved useful to employers as a device for keeping Protestant and Catholic workers from \\"uniting for better wages and conditions.\\" Conflict and suppression In the early 19th century, much of the Order's activities were bound up with violent conflict with the Ribbonmen, a Catholic secret society. A report from the time says: > \\"The 26th July, 1813 is memorable as the day on which a conflict occurred > between Loyalists and Ribbonmen. The latter, who assembled to the number of > 1500, attacked the house of a resident named Davidson, where the Orange > Lodges were in the habit of meeting. The owner of the doomed premises, > warned of their intentions, had a few trusty friends at hand to lend any > necessary assistance. Three of the Ribbonmen were killed outright, while > others, mortally wounded, died soon after. This did not end the trouble > because a month later twelve men from the neighbourhood of Garvagh were > charged before Judge Fletcher at Derry for murder. Three of the accused were > acquitted and the others found guilty of manslaughter.\\" Of the acquittal a song says, \\"The Judge he then would us condemn Had it not been for the jurymen Our grateful thanks are due to them For they cleared the boys of Garvagh.\\" The Ribbonmen were found guilty but were acquitted at a later assizes when it was stated \\"that both parties had become reconciled and were ready to give bail for their future good behaviour.\\" The Orange Order, along with other organisations, was banned between 1823 and 1845 by the British government because of its involvement in sectarian violence in Ulster. Although they were then illegal the parades continued. In 1829, seven people were killed during disturbances in Clones, County Monaghan, and eight in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh. The first Orange-related disturbances in Scotland were reported in 1830. In 1835, a Parliamentary Committee set up to investigate the activities of the Order heard from a local magistrate, William Hancock, that: > \\"For some time past the peaceable inhabitants of the parish of Drumcree have > been insulted and outraged by large bodies of Orangemen parading the > highways, playing party tunes, firing shots, and using the most opprobrious > epithets they could invent... a body of Orangemen marched through the town > and proceeded to Drumcree church, passing by the Catholic chapel though it > was a considerable distance out of their way.\\" In 1836, the British Army used artillery to quell trouble at the annual gathering at Scarva, County Down. Many Orange songs of the 19th century period suggest that the Royal Irish Constabulary were sympathetic to the Thrashers and turned a blind eye to numerous skirmishes in County Down. In July 1849 near Castlewellan, County Down there was a skirmish shortly before the Battle of Dolly's Brae. This 'battle' took place on 12 July 1849 as the result of a parading dispute. At least 30 Catholics were killed in clashes between Ribbonmen and Orangemen. The British government banned Orange Order marches again after this incident. The Grand Master of the Order, Lord Roden, was forced to resign his position as a justice of the peace after it emerged that he incited the Orangemen before the incident at a gathering hosted on his estate nearby. Revival By the later 19th century, the Order was in decline. However, its fortunes were revived by the spread of Protestant opposition to Irish nationalist mobilisation in the Irish Land League and then around the question of Home Rule. Some Protestants perceived the Land War (sometimes violent agitation for the rights of tenant farmers) to be anti- Protestant, as most of the Landowning class were Protestants. As a result, the Orange Order, in October 1880, sent 50 labourers from counties Cavan and Monaghan to work the lands of Captain Charles Boycott (who was being boycotted by his own tenants) in County Mayo. They also established the Orange Emergency Committee in 1881, to oppose the Land league and to help landlords. These actions gave the Order greater appeal among the Ulster Protestant landed gentry and business community. The Order's revival was completed by the controversy over Home Rule (or self-government for Ireland), which it virulently opposed on the grounds that Protestants would face discrimination in a Catholic dominated Ireland. Many of the Order's backers were also industrialists and valued the economic common market which the Act of Union guaranteed with Britain. In 1886, the Order was instrumental in the foundation of the Unionist Party, a coalition of former Liberal and Conservative Members of Parliament and an organisation named the Ulster Loyalist Anti-Repeal Union, to oppose the first Home Rule Bill. Between them, the Orange Order and the Unionist Party became mass organisations in Ulster, gaining the support of much of the Protestant population there. In 1886, William Ewart Gladstone's Home Rule Bill was before Parliament. The Bill was defeated in June, and serious rioting broke out in Ulster, continuing on into the marching season in July. By September, fifty people were dead, and thousands had been driven from their homes. In 1894, the Order and the Unionists successfully opposed the Second Home Rule Bill, which was passed in the House of Commons but rejected by the House of Lords. British Prime Minister William Gladstone hinted at this time that special provision might need to be made for Ulster, a proposal that prefigured the subsequent Partition of Ireland. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the Order suffered a split, when Thomas Sloane left the organisation to set up the Independent Orange Order. Sloane had been suspended from the main Order after running against a Unionist candidate on a pro-labour platform in an election in 1902. The Independent Orange Order was initially more left wing than its parent organisation. By 1905, it had over 70 Lodges. However, its appeal was hurt by the suggestion of its first grand master, Lindsay Crawford, that unionists might accept Home Rule under certain circumstances. It later became associated with more traditional unionist politics, but remained critical of the close relationship between the Orange Order and the Unionist Party. Role in the partition of Ireland In 1912, the Third Home Rule Bill was passed in the British House of Commons (though it was held up by the House of Lords for two further years). The Orange Order, along with Irish Unionists and the British Conservative Party, were forthright in opposing the Bill. The Order organised the 1912 Ulster Covenant a pledge to oppose Home Rule that was signed by up to 500,000 people. In addition, in 1911 some Orangemen in County Tyrone had begun to arm themselves and engage in military training with the intention of resisting Home Rule. To facilitate this, several Justices of the Peace revived an old law permitting the formation of militias \\"for the purpose of maintaining the constitution of the United Kingdom as now established.\\" This practice spread to other Orange lodges under the name Ulster Volunteers, and in 1913 the Ulster Unionist Council decided to bring these groups under central control, creating the Ulster Volunteer Force, a militia dedicated to resisting Home Rule. There was a strong overlap between Orange Lodges and UVF units. A large shipment of rifles was imported from Germany to arm them in April 1914 in what became known as the Larne Gun Running. Civil war looked likely to break out between the Ulster Volunteers and the nationalist Irish Volunteers. However, the crisis was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 and the temporary suspension of the Home Rule Act placed on the statute books with Royal Assent. Many Orangemen served in the war with the 36th (Ulster) Division suffering heavy losses and commemorations of their sacrifice are still an important element of Orange ceremonies. After the war, the island of Ireland became embroiled in the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), which pitted the Irish Republican Army (the I.R.A.) against British Crown forces. The Orange Order appealed for Protestant unity in this period, condemning militant labour action such as strike for a 40-hour week in Belfast in 1919. In addition, some members of the Order were involved in paramilitary activities against nationalists. The leader of the Ulster Volunteer Force, Colonel Wilfrid Spender, wrote to Sir James Craig, 1st Bt., in 1920, \\"Some of the Orange Lodges have decided that the UVF is too slow and have decided to raise a special force of their own.\\" Many Orangemen were subsequently recruited into the Ulster Special Constabulary, an Auxiliary, mostly Protestant police force. Many of them were allegedly involved in attacks on Catholics, in which over 350 people were killed in the period 1920–1922. The Fourth Home Rule Act was passed as the Government of Ireland Act 1920, the north eastern part of Ulster being partitioned from Southern Ireland as Northern Ireland. This new self-governing entity within the United Kingdom was confirmed under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. Southern Ireland became the Irish Free State in December 1922, then, in December 1937, it became Éire. This independent Irish state has been popularly known (in English) as the Republic of Ireland since it left the Commonwealth in April 1949. In Northern Ireland The Orange Order had a central place in the new state of Northern Ireland. It acted as a basis for the unity of Protestants of all classes and as a mass social and political grouping. At its peak in 1965, the Order's membership was around 70,000, which meant that roughly 1 in 5 adult Protestant males were members. It had very close ties to the ruling Unionist Party and the senior leadership of both frequently overlapped. Lord Craigavon said in 1934, \\"I am an Orangeman first and a politician and a member of parliament second.\\" Membership of the Order was also useful in obtaining jobs and public housing. The Order's principal commemoration on 12 July was made a public holiday and in effect, Northern Ireland's national day. The Orange Order began to lose influence in the 1960s, when it came into conflict with a movement towards modernisation and a reduction in sectarianism led by Captain Terence O'Neill, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Although the Order's leadership remained supportive of O'Neill as a fellow Orangeman, many rank and file members opposed his programme and his supporters suffered heckling at Orange Order events. One MP, George Forrest, was kicked unconscious by spectators at the 1967 Twelfth. Cabinet minister Phelim O'Neill quit the Order rather than have it discipline him over his attendance at a Catholic ceremony, becoming one of only four Stormont Cabinet ministers in history not to belong to the Order. The Order was also challenged from the other side by The Rev. Ian Paisley and his followers, who accused the Order of being insufficiently opposed to Catholicism, humanism and ecumenism. Since 1965, membership has gone into decline, notably in Belfast and Derry. There was a membership spike following the beginning of The Troubles, but most new members who signed up did not remain long. The Order's political influence suffered greatly when the Unionist-dominated Stormont parliament was prorogued in 1972. Since then the Order has existed primarily as a pressure group, although many Ulster Unionist Party MPs and officials are members of the Order. The Order also suffered considerably in the Troubles, although the majority of murdered Orangemen were killed as members of the security forces rather than as Orangemen per se. Numerous Orange halls have been subject to arson and other vandalism, with some requiring heavy security and being uninsurable. As nationalists gained increased power within Northern Ireland, the Order became less able to parade along many of its traditional routes through Catholic neighbourhoods. This issue has led to considerable verbal and physical conflict both within the Order and between the Order and other groups, especially concerning the Drumcree conflict in Portadown. Traditionally, the Orange Order was affiliated with the institutions of establishment Unionism: the Ulster Unionist Party and Church of Ireland. It had a fractious relationship with the Democratic Unionist Party, Independent Orange Order and the Free Presbyterian Church; at times discouraging their members from joining these organizations . To this day, according to Tim Pat Coogan, Orangemen still overlook the Papal input to the creation of their icon William of Orange. However at least one Orange publication has mentioned the Pope's support for William,M.W. Dewar, John Brown and S.E. Long, Orangeism: A New Historical Appreciation, Belfast, 1967, pp.43–6. and so it would be wrong to assume that Orangemen in general are ignorant of the Pope's role. Military contributions Orangemen have fought in numerous wars, including the War of 1812, the Crimean War, the Indian Mutiny and the Second Boer War. Able Seaman Bro William George Vincent Williams of LOL 92 Melbourne, was the first Australian to be killed in the war. The Institution's most notable military contribution was on the first day (1 July) of the Battle of the Somme, 1916. Many Orangemen had joined the 36th (Ulster) Division which had been formed from various Ulster regiments and had also amalgamated Sir Edward Carson's Ulster Volunteers (who were formed to oppose Home Rule for Ireland) into its ranks. But for the outbreak of World War I, Ireland had been on the brink of civil war, as Orangemen had helped to smuggle thousands of rifles from Imperial Germany (see Larne Gun Running). Several hundred Glasgow Orangemen crossed to Belfast in September 1914, to join the 36th (Ulster) Division. Roughly 5000 members of the Division were casualties on the first day of the battle. Orangemen also fought in World War II and subsequent conflicts, and many served in the Ulster Defence Regiment during the Northern Irish Troubles, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. At least five Orangemen have been awarded the Victoria Cross: George Richardson, in the Indian Mutiny; Robert Hanna, Robert QuiggMichael MacDonagh, The Irish on the Somme, London, 1917, p.48. and Abraham Acton during World War I; and Rev. John Weir Foote in World War II. Numerous lodges have been formed by serving soldiers during various conflicts, with varying levels of official approval. In September 2007 there was controversy when a photograph of British soldiers in Iraq, wearing Orange sashes and carrying a banner reading 'Rising Sons of Basra', appeared in the Ulster Volunteer Force magazine The Purple Standard.

They were used around coastal areas and in coastal operations, and were tasked with – among other things – coastal patrol, ship escort, and naval combat. Warships were not available in sufficient numbers in the Imperial Navy and the Kriegsmarine to control the long coasts of the territories under German rule. For this reason, many different types of smaller craft were modified for use in combat. Most Vorpostenboote were pre-war fishing vessels, yachts or harbour craft. Such vessels were ideal because they were plentiful, and were of simple and robust design, advantageous in rough waters. They were the German equivalent to the trawlers of the Royal Navy. There were several hundred Vorpostenboote active during each World War. Vorpostenboote typically carried one or two medium-calibre guns (e.g. 88 mm), many light automatic anti-air artillery pieces (20–40 mm), and a varying number of machine guns. For anti-submarine warfare they were also fitted with depth charges. Crewed by sixty to seventy men, most of whom were weapons personnel taken from the naval reserve, the Vorpostenboote became particularly feared by the Royal Navy for their firepower and efficiency in battle. While Vorpostenboote were able to engage and defeat light naval forces – such as small motor gun boats – they were not powerful enough to effectively combat destroyers or larger warships. Some Vorpostenboote (and submarine chasers) were given heavier AA guns and re- rated as Flakjaeger or Flakkorvetten, but the heaviest armed German AA batteries were converted old warships.Gardiner and Brown p58 During the Cold War, the German Navy planned to use Vorpostenboote as part of its wartime strategy, in squadrons 122 and 124 of the Navy.

History Although little is known about John Gore before his service with the Royal Navy, it is believed he was born in the British Colony of Virginia in either 1729 or 1730. He first appears in the record books in 1755, joining HMS Windsor at Portsmouth as a midshipman. Five years later Gore took his lieutenant's exam and was appointed master's mate of HMS Dolphin. Aboard the Dolphin Gore circumnavigated the globe twice-- first under John Byron and then Samuel Wallis. His experience in the Pacific Ocean and on extended navy expeditions led to him being called up to join James Cook's mission to record the Transit of Venus in Tahiti and search for Terra Australis in 1768 aboard HMS Endeavour. On Endeavour, Gore was initially third-in-command (i.e. 3rd Lieutenant) behind Cook (1st Lieutenant) and Zachary Hicks (2nd Lieutenant). After the death of Hicks on the return voyage to England on 26 May 1771, Gore became second-in-command (2nd Lieutenant) Captain James Cook by Richard Hough. Coronet, London 1995 p 64,210 Gore had previously been part of the Royal Navy crew aboard Wallis's Dolphin that had \\"discovered\\" Tahiti and he became valuable to Cook for his knowledge of the island. In 1769 Gore became the first recorded person on the expedition to shoot and kill a person of Māori descent, following an altercation over a piece of cloth as the Endeavour charted the coast of New Zealand. Later, on 14 July 1770 Gore became famous for being the first person to shoot and kill a kangaroo (for scientific research) as the expedition made its way up the eastern seaboard of Australia. Returning to England, in 1772 Gore joined the botanist Joseph Banks (who had also been on Cook's first Pacific voyage) in a private scientific expedition to Iceland and the Hebrides. Gore and Banks may have become friends as evidence shows that Banks was the executor of Gore's will. The trip did not return until after Cook had sailed on his second Pacific voyage. However, in 1776 Gore answered the call from Cook and the admiralty once again and joined HMS Resolution as First Lieutenant for Cook's third voyage. As the Resolution explored the Pacific in search of the famed Northwest Passage, Gore would sight the American continent of his birth from the west coast. Later, following Cook's death in Hawaii, Charles Clerke, captain of Resolution's sister ship HMS Discovery took command. Gore then assumed command of Discovery in Clerke's place. When Clerke himself died shortly after, Gore took responsibility for the entire expedition (unaware that his place of birth had declared its independence from Great Britain two years previously) and brought the ships home to England on 4 October 1780-- more than a year after assuming command. He was formally promoted to the post of captain on 2 October 1780. In recognition of his achievements John Webber, who had previously painted Cook, took Gore's portrait as the navy made him an honorary post-captain. Moving further in the footsteps of Cook, he was offered the late Captain's vacant rooms at the Greenwich Hospital. In 1790, having circumnavigated the globe four times, he died on 10 August. Legacy Gore was survived by a son, John (born 1774) who was also a Royal Navy Officer, who reached the rank of captain on 19 July 1821, retiring in that rank on 1 October 1846, later promoted to Retired Rear Admiral on 8 March 1852 and dying in 1853.This John Gore is not to be confused with two other British naval officers - Sir John Gore, who reached the rank of vice admiral on 27 May 1825, and died on 21 August 1836, and the Honourable John Gore, who died in 1812 with the rank of commander; see The Commissioned Sea Officers of the Royal Navy 1660-1815 (Navy Records Society, 1994) He moved to Australia in 1834 as one of the first free settlers. Little is known of his mother (John Gore senior's wife), Ann Gore, although she is known to have received a Royal Navy widow's pension from 1790.WRD Leigh 1978 Biographical Notes and Genealogical Charts of Families descended from John Gore and Richard Leigh in Australia. His son (that is, John Gore senior's grandson), Graham Gore, continued the expeditionary heritage, perishing in John Franklin's ill-fated attempt to navigate the Northwest Passage, nearly 70 years after his grandfather had attempted the same. Gore Point and the Gore Peninsula in the Alaskan Kenai fjords were named for John Gore by Captain Nathaniel Portlock, a fellow veteran of Cook's third voyage who explored the Pacific Northwest of America in the late 18th century. There are also several Australian and New Zealand sites named after John Gore.

Melvill was awarded a trophy for shooting the first whale in the South Sea. Britannia left on 7 January 1792, intending to cruise for three months, and then either sail back to Port Jackson, of for England, depending on her fortunes.Collins, King, & Bass (1798), p.195. She arrived home on 9 August 1793 with 118 tuns sperm oil plus 1900 seal skins.British Southern Whale Fishery database – Voyages: Britaania. In 1793 Tysack (or Tyzack) Hullock became her master, and in 1795 James Wilkie replaced him. =Second convict voyage= Britannia, under command of Robert Turnbull, departed England in early 1798 and arrived in Port Jackson on 18 July 1798. She embarked 96 female convicts two of whom died during the voyage. On 7 October 1798 she left Port Jackson, ostensibly for England. =Second whaling voyage= However, she actually went whaling just off the coast of New South Wales. She spent a little over two months at sea, perhaps some 30 leagues off shore, and returned on 29 December with 60 tons of spermaceti oil. She then left for England. =Third whaling voyage= Britannia sailed from Britain on 21 November 1800 with Turnbull, master. Britannia was at New South Wales between January and March 1801. By 10 December she was at the island of Mocco. She reported to Governor King at New South Wales that she had gathered 1300 barrels of oil. She returned to England on 7 December 1802. =Fourth whaling voyage= Captain George Quested sailed Britannia from England on 7 May 1803, bound for New Zealand. She stopped in Rio de Janeiro in June for refreshment and repairs. In May 1804 she was \\"all well\\" off the coast of New Zealand. Britannia sailed again on 17 September 1804 for the Pacific Ocean, with Nathaniel Goodspeed (or Godspied, or Godsped), master. She was on the coast of Peru 10 April 1805 in ballast. She was reported to have been well in May 1805. She returned to Britain on 9 December 1805. She was at Sydney from the coast of California 22 June 1806 after having been out 22 months. She had gathered 16,000 to 20,000 seal skins plus at least 95 tons of sperm oil. Fate Britannia was wrecked at 0200 on the morning of 25 August 1806. The wrecking occurred on either Middleton Reef or Elizabeth Reef, some 297 miles east of the Clarence River Heads in New South Wales. She struck the reef several times before waves lifted her onto the reef where her back was broken. When the crew lowered the lifeboats, one was immediately smashed but the two others, with nineteen men in all aboard, got away. Five men stayed aboard Britannia. Two were rescued the next day while the other three found another boat, put water and biscuits on board, and launched it. The three boats with their 24 men aboard headed for Newcastle. On 29 August one of the boats, with eight men on board, separated from the other two in a gale and was never seen again. The survivors reached Newcastle on 8 September and Port Jackson on 13 September 1806.

The initial purpose of the dam from its establishment until its decommissioning during the 1970s was for the supply of potable water to the Gold Coast region. There is no public access to the dam.  Location and features  The Tallebudgera Dam is located approximately south west of the . Designed and constructed by the Coolangatta- Nerang Water Supply Board in the 1940s, construction of the Tallebudgera Dam was finalised in the early 1950s. The dam was one of the earliest water supplies for the region, and provided a constant flow to the intake that was located downstream of the dam. Growth and demand in the region led to the construction of Little Nerang Dam and Mudgeeraba Water Treatment Plant, which then made Tallebudgera Creek Dam obsolete as a water supply. The decommissioning is believed to have occurred in the 1970s and included the removal of the valve house and filling of the valve chambers. It appears that the dam was left for recreation purposes after decommissioning. Following introduction of the , a Failure Impact Assessment noted the dam design did not comply with the latest safety standards and may over top during a 1 in 50 year average recurrence interval. The Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water issued advice that the dam was to be upgraded to meet the current dam safety standards. Options considered were to permanently lower the level of the spillway, install flood-triggered gates and removal of the dam. In 2006, after two years of investigation, reports and public consultations, work commenced to upgrade the existing dam to the required standards.

Having started as a session musician in the 1940s, he was a part of the Nashville A-Team of session players, which included pianist Floyd Cramer and pedal steel guitarist Pete Drake. He is one of the most recorded guitarists in music history. Early life  Bradley was born in Nashville, Tennessee, one of six children of Vernon Bradley and Letha Maie Owen in 1926. As a child, he played tenor banjo but switched to guitar on the advice of his elder brother, record producer Owen. Owen arranged for Harold to tour with Ernest Tubb as lead guitarist in his band, The Texas Troubadours, while Harold was still in high school. After graduation, Harold joined the Navy in 1944 and was discharged in 1946, after which he attended George Peabody College (now a part of Vanderbilt University) in Nashville, studying music while accompanying Eddy Arnold and Bradley Kincaid at the Grand Ole Opry. His first session was with Pee Wee King and the Golden West Cowboys in Chicago in 1946. His debut in Nashville was four years later in 1950. Career  In 1954, Owen and Harold built Bradley Film and Recording Studios, later known as the Quonset Hut Studio, which was the first music industry-related business on what is now known as Music Row. Harold enjoyed frequent work as a session musician into the 1970s, performing on hundreds of albums by country stars such as Patsy Cline, Willie Nelson, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley and Slim Whitman. He also played bass guitar on records, initiating the \\"tic-tac\\" method of bass muting. He was a member of the Nashville A-Team, which would play for such musicians as Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and The Byrds, and was inducted into the Musician's Hall of Fame in 2007. Harold recorded three albums as a pop guitarist on Columbia Records, Misty Guitar, Guitar for Lovers Only, and Bossa Nova Goes to Nashville, in the 1960s. From 1991 to 2008, Bradley served as the President of the Nashville chapter of the American Federation of Musicians (AFM). He was also the first President of the Nashville chapter of the Recording Academy. In 1999, he was elected as the AFM International Vice-President and served until 2010. Bradley was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 2006, as his brother Owen previously had been. In 2010, Bradley was a recipient of the Trustees Award at the 52nd Grammy Awards. Bradley died at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville on January 31, 2019, twenty-nine days after his 93rd birthday. He was survived by two daughters and his wife of 66 years, Eleanor Allen Bradley. Harold's nephew Jerry, would be inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame later in 2019.

Today, all that remains of the city are the ruins of several royal temples: Preah Ko, the Bakong, Lolei.Higham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, Higham, C., 2014, Early Mainland Southeast Asia, Bangkok: River Books Co., Ltd., Etymology This 7th century sculpture of Harihara is from Phnom Da in Cambodia. The name \\"Hariharalaya\\" is derived from the name of Harihara, a Hindu deity prominent in pre-Angkorian Cambodia. The name \\"Harihara\\" in turn is a composite of \\"Hari\\" (one of Vishnu's names listed in Vishnu sahasranama) and \\"Hara\\" (meaning the Hindu god Shiva). Cambodian representations of Harihara were of a male deity whose one side bore the attributes of Vishnu and whose other side bore the attributes of Shiva. For example, the deity’s head-covering consisted of a mitre-type hat (the attribute of Vishnu) on one side and as twisted locks of hair (the attribute of Shiva) on the other. Alaya is a sanskrit word meaning \\"basis,\\" or \\"home,\\" so Hariharalaya is home of Harihara or home of the deity representing both Hari (Vishnu) and Hara (Shiva). History The Bakong is the royal temple mountain founded by King Indravarman I at Hariharalaya. Toward the end of the 8th century A.D., the Cambodian king Jayavarman II conquered vast territories near the great lake Tonle Sap. For at least part of this time, he established his capital at Hariharalaya.O'Reilly, Dougald J.W. Early Civilizations of Southeast Asia. Rowman & Littlefield Pub Inc. 2006. . pp.123-124 However, when he declared himself the universal monarch of the country in 802 A.D., he did so not at Hariharalaya, but at Mahendraparvata on the Phnom Kulen Plateau. Later, he returned the capital to Hariharalaya, where he died in 835.Freeman and Jacques, p.9. Jayavarman II was succeeded by Jayavarman III and then by Indravarman I, who were responsible for the completion of the royal temple mountain known as the Bakong and the construction of Indratataka baray.Coèdes, George (edited by Walter F. Vella; translated by Susan Brown Cowing). The Indianized states of Southeast Asia. University of Hawai\`i Press. 1986. . p.110ff Indravarman I consecrated the temple’s dominant religious symbol, a lingam called Sri Indresvara (the name is a combination of the king’s name with that of Shiva), in 881. Indravarman I also constructed the much smaller temple today called Preah Ko (\\"Sacred Bull\\"), dedicated in 880. In 889, Indravarman I was succeeded by his son Yasovarman I, who constructed the temple of Lolei (the name may be a modern corruption of \\"Hariharalaya\\") on an artificial island in the middle of Indratataka.The reason for its offset towards the north seems to be that Indravarman closed off hastily the north side while preparing to move the capital to Angkor site, as in Freeman and Jacques, p.202 Yasovarman also founded a new city at the site of Angkor Thom north of modern Siem Reap and called it Yasodharapura. Yasovarman made the new city his capital and constructed a new royal temple mountain, known as the Bakheng. Yasodharapura was to survive until the 1170s when it was sacked by invaders from Champa.Freeman and Jacques, p.9ff.

It is also used in many other parts of the world, including Spain (especially in Seville), China, Malaysia, Mexico, Egypt, Japan, Peru, Thailand, Cambodia, Romania, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Argentina, Chile, United Arab Emirates, Brazil and many others. On 18 March 2016 Google celebrated Xiaolüren's 17th birthday with a doodle. A similar figure as a crossing signal first appeared in East Berlin in 1961 and gained the local nickname Ampelmännchen, but was static rather than animated. Origin Xiaolüren, a sign on traffic signals for pedestrians, was created in 1961 by traffic psychologist Karl Peglau (1927–2009) as part of a proposal for a new traffic lights layout in East Berlin, Germany. The sign is generally for pedestrian road-crossings. The frontal-facing red man denotes \\"stop\\", while the animated side-facing green man in the striding motion denotes \\"go ahead\\". Until 2000, however, the green man was static rather than animated in other cities of the world, including Berlin. Animated pedestrian traffic lights In 1998, following the lead of cities such as those in Spain, the Taipei City Government intended on adding a count-down timer to all static pedestrian traffic signals. Together, The Department of Transportation () and the Chinese Signal Company () and other participating companies created the “dynamic crossroad signal for pedestrians”. By the end of that year, the Taipei City Government had started testing and installing these new animated Xiaolürens. This specially designed sign follows the Traffic Signs, Marking and Lights Installation Regulation issued by the Taiwan Ministry of Transportation and Communications. Its main function is to improve perceptibility of traffic signals for pedestrians. Other than retaining the general concept of “go at green, stop at red”, features of a count-down timer and the walking animation of Xiaolüren are added. Design guidelines The animated pedestrian signs test-driven by the Taipei City Government were built along these guidelines: *Walking animation: The blue/green walking signal is usually constructed by seven differently shaped and positioned icons, and the walking or running movements are a result of persistence of vision. The Little Green Man moves in two or three different velocities: slow, fast, and occasionally, extremely fast. When the sign turns green, the little green man would first move slowly. After a certain duration of time (usually 14 seconds left on the countdown display, depending on width of pedestrian crossing), the animation would occasionally start moving at a faster speed or just simply flicker. When there is only ten seconds left to cross the street, the animation would occasionally move at its fastest speed and/or flicker. *Countdown display: When the sign turns blue/green, the other window shows the amount of time left before the sign turns red again. It is usually allotted a specific two-digit seconds to countdown to zero. Because there are only two digits on the display, if the allotted duration of time exceeds 99 seconds, the display would only start counting down when there are 99 seconds left until the sign turns red. In addition, on one version of xiaolüren traffic lights, the “6” and “9” figures on the display are designed differently from conventional digital numbers used in most versions. The top bar of “6” and the bottom bar of “9” are eliminated, however once the lights start getting old and breaking apart, the bottom and top lines become visible, to prevent the numbers in the lights becoming completely unreadable. The numbers are yellow, white, blue, or green when counting down the blue/green lights, and red or yellow when otherwise. *Red standing figure/hand: When the system sends out a “stop walking” signal to the device, the countdown display originally on the top window becomes replaced by a red standing figure or hand. The bottom window, previously showing the walking animation, sometimes becomes a countdown display in red, although there are many versions of xiaolüren pedestrian lights where countdowns are absent and not build in to red lights, red light timers also break more easily than green light timers, as the devices are possibly programmed to believe that green/blue light timers are more important than red light timers. Occasionally, the red light starts out flickering, often with a countdown display, telling pedestrians to go faster, then stops, telling pedestrians to completely stop. Testing and launch The very first in-service Xiaolüren, located at the intersection of Songzhi and Songshou roads near Taipei 101, which is displayed on the left side of the photo. From the end of 1998 to March 1999, Taipei City Hall set three experimental count-down pedestrian signals at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall (Guangfu S. Rd.), Daan Forest Park (Xinsheng South Rd.) and VIESHOW Cinemas (Songzhi Rd.). All were made with similar concepts but different designs. The three count-down pedestrian signals were sponsored by non-governmental organizations in Taiwan. At start of 1999, Xiaolüren device at the intersection of Songzhi Rd. and Songshou Rd. was adopted by Taipei City Hall after the run-off. On 18 March 1999, Taipei City Hall not only officially started using Xiaolüren at the intersection, but also decided to use this signal as the model of all the pedestrian signals in Taipei and started replacing previous signals. By the end of 2003, there were already 1,139 intersections among all the 1,364 with three-colored traffic lights at which there were retrofitted Xiaolürens in Taipei, and over 1,300 in year 2007. Xiaolüren signal has been included in the Traffic Signs, Marking and Lights Installation Rules amended by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, Republic of China. According to Taipei City Traffic Engineering Office’s statistics, there were 11,848 original light bulb pedestrian signals; all were re-equipped with LED light signals until the end of 2010. The re-equipped ones and the newly built ones add up to 16,832 LED count-down pedestrian signals in Taipei City. In 2017, Pingtung county police bureau have announced that they will introduce an additional female figure to pedestrian traffic lights, reported the Taiwan News website. The couple is seen walking across the street hand in hand when the light is green, and when it turns red, the man will kneel down to propose to his girlfriend with a love heart appearing between them. After four months of depicting a couple, the pedestrian crossing lights featuring a little green man with his girlfriend in Taiwan's southern city of Pingtung, have been upgraded to the follow-up version depicting them becoming parents. The girlfriend is pregnant on the red light and the couple welcoming their first child on the green light. Prevalence Featuring a friendly, smile-inducing design of personified animation, the little green man has been on duty since 2000, guarding more than a thousand intersections in Taipei City. Later, its footprint spread further to New Taipei City, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung; now it can be seen island-wide as well as overseas. With its ubiquitous presence, the little green man has become part of the folk culture, amusing visitors from abroad and inspiring commercial ideas. Aside from pedestrian signals, traffic lights are now equipped with countdown timers, too. There were red-light and green-light timers, but the latter were mostly taken down due to the accidents they induced by encouraging drivers to speed up as the green-light timers ended. As for red-light timers, they cannot only inform the time remains for waiting but also make the drivers focus on their own signal instead of green light of the other direction. This reduces clashes between cars that start too early and cars that run yellow light. Urban legend There are a number of urban legends associated with the Xiaoluren in Taiwan, with the most popular version being that the figure will fall down every 20,000 steps,Epoch Times or when the traffic becomes too busy. Other urban legends are that the Xiaoluren would turn sideways or walk upside down from time to time to fool the pedestrians. Controversy Ming Shiun Chang, the chief manager of Eucertec, has protested through a councilman, claiming that he was the inventor of the little green man. Since The Ministry of Transportation & Communication proclaimed that the device is an aggregative creation and thus should be public property, Chang has stated his will to resort to the law.Patent controversy See also *Little Green Men (disambiguation) *Ampelmännchen ReferencesExternal links *Book Category:Pedestrian crossing components Category:Taiwanese culture Category:Road transportation in Taiwan Category:Articles containing video clips ","title":"Xiaolüren"},{"id":"15036415","title":"Melodie Crittenden"},{"id":"15036487","text":"In constructive mathematics, a collection X is subcountable if there exists a partial surjection from the natural numbers onto it. This may be expressed as :\\\\exists (I\\\\subseteq\\\\omega).\\\\, \\\\exists f.\\\\, (f\\\\colon I\\\\twoheadrightarrow X). where \\\\omega are the counting numbers ({\\\\mathbb N} with disregard for arithmetic) and where f\\\\colon I\\\\twoheadrightarrow X denotes that the intersection of f and I\\\\times X gives a total relation that is surjective. In other words, all elements of a subcountable collection X are functionally in the image of an indexing set of counting numbers I\\\\subseteq\\\\omega and thus the set X can be understood as being dominated by the countable set \\\\omega.  Discussion = Example = An important case is where X denotes some subclass of a bigger class of functions as studied in computability theory. Consider the subclass of total functions and note that being total is not a decidable property, i.e. there cannot be a constructive bijection between the total functions and the natural numbers. However, via enumeration of the codes of all possible partial functions (which also includes non-terminating functions), subsets of those, such as the total functions, are seen to be a subcountable sets. Note that by Rice's theorem on index sets, most domains I are not recursive. Indeed, no effective map between all counting numbers \\\\omega and the infinite (non-finite) indexing set I is asserted here, merely the subset relation I\\\\subseteq\\\\omega. Being dominated by a constructively non- countable set of numbers I, the name subcountable thus conveys that the uncountable set X is no bigger than \\\\omega. The demonstration that X is subcountable also implies that it is classically (non-constructively) formally countable, but this does not reflect any effective countability. In other words, the fact that an algorithm listing all total functions in sequence cannot be coded up is not captured by classical axioms regarding set and function existence. We see that, depending on the axioms, subcountability may be more likely to be provable than countability. = Relation to Excluded Middle = In constructive logics and set theories, which tie the existence of a function between infinite (non-finite) sets to questions of effectivity and decidability, the subcountability property splits from countability and is thus not a redundant notion. The indexing set I of natural numbers may be posited to exist, e.g. as a subset via set theoretical axioms like Separation axiom, so that :\\\\forall (i\\\\in I). (i\\\\in\\\\omega). But this set may then still fail to be detachable, in the sense that :\\\\forall (n\\\\in \\\\omega). \\\\left((n\\\\in I) \\\\lor eg(n\\\\in I)\\\\right) cannot be proven without assuming it as an axiom. One may fail to effectively count X if one fails to map the counting numbers \\\\omega into the indexing set I, for this reason.  In classical mathematics  Asserting all laws of classical logic, the disjunctive property of I discussed above indeed does hold for all sets. Then, for nonempty X, the properties numerable (X injects into \\\\omega), countable (\\\\omega has X as its range), subcountable (a subset of \\\\omega surjects into X) and also not \\\\omega- productive (a countability property essentially defined in terms of subsets of X, formalized below) are all equivalent and express that a set is finite or countably infinite.  Non-classical assertions  Not asserting the law of excluded middle :(\\\\phi\\\\lor eg \\\\phi) for all proposition \\\\phi, it can then also be consistent to assert the subcountability of sets that classically (i.e. non-constructively) exceed the cardinality of the natural numbers. Note that in a constructive setting, a countability claim about {\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N} out of the full set \\\\omega, as in \\\\omega\\\\twoheadrightarrow{\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N}, may be disproven. But subcountability I\\\\twoheadrightarrow{\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N} of an uncountable set {\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N} by a set I\\\\subseteq\\\\omega that is not effectively detachable from \\\\omega may be permitted.  Set theories = Cantorian arguments on subsets of the naturals =Into function spaces As an example, the theory CZF has Bounded Separation, Infinity, is agnostic towards the existence of power sets, but it includes the axiom that asserts that any function space X^Y is set, given X, Y are also sets. In this theory, it is moreover consistent to assert that every set is subcountable. Asserting the permitted subcountability of all sets, {\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N} is subcountable in particular. For a function on an infinite subset of the counting numbers, f\\\\colon I\\\\twoheadrightarrow{\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N}, the set comprehended asJohn L. Bell \\"Russel's Paradox and Diagonalization in a Constructive Context\\" :\\\\\\\\{\\\\langle n, y\\\\rangle \\\\in{\\\\mathbb N}\\\\times{\\\\mathbb N}\\\\mid (n\\\\in I\\\\land D(n, y)) \\\\lor ( eg(n\\\\in I)\\\\land y=1)\\\\\\\\} with the diagonalization :D(n, y)=( eg(f(n)(n)\\\\ge 1)\\\\land y=1) \\\\lor ( eg(f(n)(n)=0)\\\\land y=0) is classically a function in {\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N}. However, constructively the set does not lead to a violation the potential surjectivity of f, unless n\\\\in I is decidable, e.g. when I={\\\\mathbb N}. A full surjection {\\\\mathbb N}\\\\twoheadrightarrow{\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N}, with domain {\\\\mathbb N}, is indeed contradictory. For any non-zero number d, the functions i\\\\mapsto f(i)(i)+d in I\\\\to{\\\\mathbb N} cannot be extended to all of {\\\\mathbb N} for the same reason. Note that when given a n\\\\in{\\\\mathbb N}, one cannot necessarily decide whether n\\\\in I, i.e. whether the value of a potential function extension on n is already determined by f. In other words, there are then partial functions that cannot be extended to full functions {\\\\mathbb N}\\\\to{\\\\mathbb N}. The subcountibility axiom is incompatible with any new axiom making I countable, including LEM. Into power classes Assuming {\\\\mathcal P}{\\\\mathbb N} is a set, the set violating a possible surjection f\\\\colon I\\\\twoheadrightarrow{\\\\mathcal P}{\\\\mathbb N}, given by :\\\\\\\\{n \\\\in {\\\\mathbb N}\\\\mid n \\\\in I \\\\land D(n)\\\\\\\\} where :D(n)= eg(n\\\\in f(n)), in Cantors theorem about power sets exists via Separation and indeed immediately leads to a contradiction.Daniel Méhkeri \\"A simple computational interpretation of set theory\\" This demonstrates that {\\\\mathcal P}{\\\\mathbb N} can actually not be a set and is thus a proper class. The two discussed situations are different in that a function makes accessible the data for all its subdomains (subsets of the superset). Naturally, in CZF, the total functions X\\\\to\\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} are not in bijection with the subsets of X, a more involved concept. In fact, even the power set of a singleton, e.g. {\\\\mathcal P}\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\}, is shown to be a proper class in this context (there are provably not just the two truth values 0 and 1). = The notion of size = Motivated by the above, the infinite set {\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N} may be considered \\"smaller\\" than the class {\\\\mathcal P}{\\\\mathbb N}. Subcountability shall not be confused with the standard mathematical definition of cardinality relations as defined by Cantor, with smaller cardinality being defined in terms of injections out of X and equality of cardinalities being defined in terms of bijections. Moreover, note that constructively, an ordering \\"<\\" like that of cardinalities can be undecidable. As seen in the example of the function space considered in computability theory, not every infinite subset of \\\\omega necessarily is in constructive bijection with \\\\omega, thus making room for a more refined distinction between uncountabile sets in constructive contexts. The function space {\\\\mathbb N}^{\\\\mathbb N} (and also \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}^{\\\\mathbb N} ) in a moderately rich set theory is always found to be neither finite nor in bijection with {\\\\mathbb N} , by Cantor's diagonal argument. This is what it means to be uncountable. But the argument that the cardinality of that set would thus in some sense exceed that of the natural numbers relies on a restriction to just the classical size conception and its induced ordering of sets by cardinality. = Models = The above analysis affects formal properties of codings of \\\\mathbb R. Models for this non-classical extension of CZF theory have been constructed.Rathjen, M. \\"Choice principles in constructive and classical set theories\\", Proceedings of the Logic Colloquium, 2002 Such non-constructive axioms can be seen as choice principles which, however, do not tend to increase the proof-theoretical strengths of the theories much. More examples: * There are models of IZF in which all sets with apartness relations are subcountable.McCarty, J. \\"Subcountability under realizability\\", Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, Vol 27 no 2 April 1986 * In CZF, as discussed, it is indeed consistent to assert the Subcountability Axiom that all sets are (internally) subcountable. The resulting theory is in contradiction to the Axiom of power set and with the law of excluded middle. * More stronger yet, some models of Kripke-Platek set theory validate that all sets are even countable.  Subcountable implies not \\\\omega-productive  Any countable set is subcountable and any subcountable set is not \\\\omega-productive: A set X is said to be \\\\omega-productive if, whenever any of its subsets is the range of some partial function g, there always remains at least one element that lies outside that range. This may be expressed as :\\\\forall g.\\\\, \\\\left((g\\\\colon\\\\omega\\\\to X) \\\\implies \\\\exists (x\\\\in X).\\\\, x otin {\\\\mathrm{rng}}(g)\\\\right). A set being \\\\omega-productive speaks for how hard it is to generate its elements: They cannot be generated using a single function. As such, \\\\omega-productive sets escape subcountability. Diagonal arguments often involve this notion, be it explicitly or implicitly.

The Coombabah wetlands are significant because they are the most southerly lake and coastal swampland representatives in the bioregion, and because the area provides significant wildlife value and refuge habitat. The conservation area includes tidal marshlands and mangroves along part of the lakes edge. The Melaleuca boardwalk allows viewing of the wildlife. The mangroves are home to frogs, crabs and fish that attract native and migratory birds. There are guided bushwalking and canoeing activities as part of community conservation and environmental workshops to promote local conservation. Location and features Situated near the suburb of , from the coast and northwest of , the lake borders the Ivan Gibbs Wetland Reserve, is classified as a Fish Habitat Area within the Moreton Bay Marine Park and serves as an important wildlife corridor between the Nerang State Forest and the coast. The lake is fed by Coombabah Creek which rises to the west in the Nerang Forest Reserve. The Ivan Gibbs Wetlands Reserve and Lakeside Country Club golf course are both located to the south of the lake. Houses in Helensvale have been built a short distance from the lake's western shore. The Park safeguards close to 1200 hectares of wetland, eucalypt forest, mangrove habitat and salt marsh and acts as habitat for migratory birds.

A core function of mental health triage is to conduct risk assessment that aims to determine whether the patient is a risk of harming self or others as a result of their mental state, and to assess other risks related to mental illness As with other triage models, the mental health triage clinician must assign a category of urgency to the case, which is recorded using verbal indicators of risk such as 'extreme risk' through to 'low risk', or by using numerical (urgency= time-to-treatment) categories 1 (immediate) to 5 (2 hours), as per the 5-point Australasian Triage Scale.

Alongside Mark Billingham's Gary, the two guards were ostensibly part of 'ye baddies', but were really very sympathetic, (if slightly dim-witted) comedic sidekicks and foils to Tony Robinson's Sheriff of Nottingham. Initially, this semi-musical pseudo-Children's comedy programme was written solely by Mr Robinson, but by the third series, both Lloyd and Billingham were helping out with storylines and scripts, both ultimately gaining on-screen credits as co-writers. The three remain friends, and can be seen discussing writing Maid Marian on the DVD release of Series 3. =Other children's TV= Lloyd (and Billingham)'s work on Maid Marian with Tony Robinson gave them a grounding in comedy scriptwriting, and spurred them to write more. Between 1993 and 1996, the two collaborated on the writing of another children's comedy programme: Harry's Mad, based on the novel by British children's author Dick King-Smith. The programme featured an intelligent talking parrot (\\"Madison\\"), inherited by his owner, Harry, upon the death of his uncle. The parrot's abilities were only known by a select few, but would be heard at inopportune moments, causing considerable trouble for Harry.Memorable TV: Harry's Mad. Accessed 9 February 2008Harry's Mad at Answers.com. Accessed 9 February 2008 The show ran for four series, and also featured Lloyd, Billingham and Maid Marian co-star Howard Lew Lewis in various small roles. Soon after (1996 to 1998), Lloyd was back in front of the cameras, playing Mr Bill Hunter, the husband of Tessa Peake- Jones's character, who adopt the main character of Dinah Glass in the BBC series The Demon Headmaster (based on the books by Gillian Cross). Although rarely seen during the first series, Lloyd's character played a larger role in the second and third. (A fourth series was reputedly planned, but ultimately scrapped, and never filmed.) In March 2009 he made a guest appearance as Mr Marvelloso in the BBC children's series 'Grandpa in my Pocket'. =Screenwriting= While taking minor roles in such programmes as Casualty, The Bill and Waking the Dead, Mr Lloyd has turned his skill and experience from Maid Marian and Harry's Mad into a symbiotic career as an accomplished screenwriter of non-Children's programmes, having produced scripts for Casualty (2004) and EastEnders (2003–06). In 2001, he began writing for the daytime BBC medical soap/drama Doctors, and has rapidly become one of the most prolific writers on that show having written over 65 episodes. His 2002-penned episode \\"It Shouldn't Happen to a Doctor\\" (in which Tony Robinson guest- starred) received a \\"Most Spectacular Scene\\" nomination at the British Soap Awards for its final scene.Doctors: \\"It Shouldn't Happen to a Doctor\\".

It is observed in certain cnidarians and helminths. This mode of reproduction is characterized by high offspring output, which, in the case of the parasitic tapeworms, is of great significance. Strobilation in cnidarians *The process starts with preliminary morphological changes. In particular, the cnidarian's tentacles tend to be reabsorbed. *Neck-formation: transverse constrictions appear near the upper extremity of the animal. A strobilating polyp is called a strobila while the non-strobilating polyp is called a scyphistoma or scyphopolyp. *Segmentation: the number of constriction sites increases and migrates down the body length, transforming the body into a sequence of disks. The fissures intensify until the initial body is divided into equally spaced, separate segments. The oral end of the polyp becomes the oral end of the ephyra. *Metamorphosis: The two previous processes involve neurosecretory products, which now disappear. Neck-formation and segmentation are only separated for clarity purposes. In reality, the two processes are simultaneous, with segmentation to release new ephyras occurring at the upper end while neck formation spreads further down the body. Usually, a portion of the animal remains adhered to the substrate and regenerates the body. =Examples= *The moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) reproduces both sexually and by strobilation. This latter process occurs during the colonial polyp stage and produces either polyps or juvenile Medusae called ephyra. Strobilation tend to occur at specific periods, typically early spring. As ephyra size remains constant regardless of the polyp size, larger polyps produce more numerous ephyras. *Some scyphozoans, such as Nausithoe aurea, cnidarians also strobilate in their solitary polyp form, producing either ephyra or planuloids. Strobilation does not happen periodically, but is thought to be induced by external stimuli, such as iodine, light regime, temperature, or food availability. =Induction in laboratory conditions= Strobilation is successfully induced in laboratory conditions by intensive feeding and temperature lowering, and also by the effect of artificial compounds. Strobilation in helminths In cestodes, the whole body except for the head and the neck undergoes strobilation continuously, reflecting the important role reproduction plays in the parasitic mode of life. The strobilating section is called strobila, or scolex, and each of its segment is a proglottid. As they mature, proglottids are disposed of in the feces of the host.

The Louisville and Portland Canal was a canal bypassing the Falls of the Ohio River at Louisville, Kentucky. The Falls form the only barrier to navigation between the origin of the Ohio at Pittsburgh and the port of New Orleans on the Gulf of Mexico; circumventing them was long a goal for Pennsylvanian and Cincinnatian merchants.Yater, George. The Encyclopedia of Louisville, p. 531. \\"Louisville and Portland Canal\\". University Press of Kentucky (Lexington), 2001. Accessed 9 October 2013. The canal opened in 1830 as the private Louisville and Portland Canal Company but was gradually bought out during the 19th century by the federal government, which had invested heavily in its construction, maintenance, and improvement. The Louisville and Portland Canal was renamed as the McAlpine Locks and Dam in 1962 after extensive modernization.. The name \\"Louisville and Portland Canal\\" (or simply \\"Portland Canal\\") is still used to refer to the canal itself, which runs between the Kentucky bank and Shippingport Island from about 10th Street down to the locks at 27th Street. The canal was the first major improvement to be completed on a major river of the United States.Trescott, 694. History=Background= The Falls of the Ohio are the only natural obstruction to riverine traffic from the source of the Ohio at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to the Gulf of Mexico. Some of the earliest cities in Kentucky Louisville, Portland, and Shippingport developed from the need for portage of cargo around the rapids, except during a few weeks each spring when water on the river was very high. Although this source of income was popular with locals, merchants invested upriver particularly those in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati disliked the expense and hassle. The situation caused wide fluctuations in prices up- and downstream, as there was always a glut of shipments during the few weeks of high water each year.Trescott, 686-687. Thomas Hutchins's 1778 map of the rapids The first meeting of the trustees of the Town of Louisville on February 7, 1781, adopted a petition to the Virginia General Assembly for the right to construct a canal around the falls. Two years later, engineer and canal advocate Christopher Colles petitioned the Congress of the Confederation, promising to start a canal company in exchange for a grant comprising the necessary land. They declined.. Serious plans for a canal circulated throughout the early 1800s, with Cincinnatians in particular advocating a northern route through Indiana in order to blunt competition from Louisville. Canal companies were chartered by the state legislatures of both Kentucky and Indiana in 1805, but nothing came of either effort.Trescott, 687. In 1808, the Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin suggested national funding for a Kentucky-side canal. The United States Senate passed bills to this effect in 1810 and 1811, but both died from Democratic opposition in the House.Trescott, 687-688. Gen. William Lytle II, founder of Cincinnati, laid out Portland in 1811 and sold lots in order to finance his own canal project. The Indiana Canal Company, that state's second effort, was chartered in 1818 and made preliminary excavations using private and state funds. The failure of a dam and the Panic of 1819 ended the attempt. Rumors that the Indianan dam had been sabotaged arose from the risk a canal posed to much of Louisville's economy, including not only forwarding, storage, drayage, and shipping but also provisioning, financing, hotels, and entertainment. Against this, however, some locals argued for the benefit a canal would provide to local manufacturing. =Privately held company= The route of the Louisville and Portland Canal in the 1850s. Despite the completion of the federally funded National Road in the 1810s and the state- funded Erie Canal in the 1820s (the latter of which cut transportation costs across New York by around 95%), continuing Democratic and Louisvillian opposition crippled attempts to fund a public canal in the Kentucky General Assembly. Instead, Charles Thurston of Louisville sponsored a bill to charter the private Louisville and Portland Canal Company. The charter established an initial toll of 20¢ per ton, permitted the company to operate the canal in perpetuity, and granted it powers of eminent domain over land necessary to the canal's construction. The initial estimates in 1824 called for one year of construction at a cost of $300,000.Trescott, 688 ff. The company was chartered in 1825. Its initial members included James Guthrie, John J. Jacob, Nicholas Berthoud, John Colmesnil, James Hughes, Robert Breckinridge, Isaac Thom, Simeon Goodwin, Charles Thurston, Worden Pope, William Vernon, Samuel Churchill, James Brown, and James Overstreet. Guthrie was elected president.Johnson, Leland & al.Triumph at the Falls: The Louisville and Portland Canal, pp. 30 ff. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Louisville), 2007. The canal was authorized by its charter to sell up to 6000 shares of stock at a cost of $100 each, but the company required only $10 down and an additional $10 quarterly. In this way, $350,000 was raised from the initial sale of stock in March 1826, and $150,000 soon after. Much of this capital came from Philadelphia investors. This private, out-of-state ownership was praised at the time by Louisville's leading newspaper, the Public Advertiser, which said \\"no one is now apprehensive of any imprudent or unjust action on the part of the Legislature\\". In May 1826, the United States Congress voted to purchase 1,000 shares as well. Construction began in 1826. As it became evident that the canal would have to be dug through solid rock, the cost estimate rose past $375,000, with two years of construction required. Local investors were the first to learn of the difficulties; several defaulted on further payment towards their shares, reducing the company's available capital. Abraham Lincoln is said to have worked on the construction of the canal in 1827.. The course was found to require adjustment, and Congress invested an additional $133,500 in 1829. The company was still due to run out of funds by the end of 1829, and a third influx of funds from Congress was vetoed by the newly elected Pres. Andrew Jackson, who denounced the practice of giving federal funds to private corporations. The company was forced to borrow $154,000 in 1830. By this time, the stock was valued at over $1,000,000, of which the federal government held $290,000. The first ship the SS Uncas passed through the partially completed locks in December 1830. The canal was fully completed in 1833, six years behind schedule. Its wide dimensions were huge in comparison with projects like the Erie Canal and intended to permit full-sized ships to pass from one side of the falls to the other. Nevertheless, the growing power and size of steamboats left the canal nearly obsolete soon after opening at the same time that the Alabama Fever and booming Black Belt cotton plantations increased demand for produce and goods from the north. The canal increased its prices to 40¢ per ton in 1834 and to 60¢ per ton in 1837 and still saw traffic increase from 170,000 tons in 1834 to 300,000 in 1839. At the same time, Louisville's \\"carrying trade\\" also increased to a greater volume than before and a line of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad was constructed beside the canal from Louisville to Portland in 1838. The company's high tolls and disinterest in improving the canal either to enlarge it or to correct the lower end, which opened into a narrow part of the river with a swift current, provoked dissatisfaction among its customers. Ohioan and Pennsylvanian opposition in Congress sometimes passed bills in the Senate approving a full buyout of the company, but such bills were consistently defeated in the House by Kentuckians, Southern proponents of states' rights such as Rep. Jefferson Davis (D–MS), and Indianan representatives, who still hoped to build their own canal as late as 1842.Trescott, 695 ff. The company's management opted to solve the problem on their own: instead of funding expansions, improvements, or dividends, profits from the canal were used to purchase privately held shares at a premium, gradually increasing the government's ownership stake. Despite the succession of long depressions set off in 1837 and 1843 and a reduction of the toll to 50¢ per ton in 1842, the company remained highly profitable, and the buyout was completed in 1855. =Government-acquired corporation= Union troops arrive at Louisville in 1862. By the 1850s, around 40% of the steamboats on the Ohio were too large for the canal and required transshipment of their cargo around the Falls. Despite holding full ownership of the company after 1855, the federal government found it impossible to get Congress to approve taking formal control of the canal. Bills offered from 1854 to 1860 failed on grounds of constitutionality, economy, and efficiency. Sen. Lazarus Powell (D-KY) was of the opinion that \\"the only reason why the government of the United States has not long taken charge of the canal, is the fear that there would be demand on the national treasury to Enlarge it\\", a reasonable fear given the reasons for the buyout of the original owners.Trescott, 700-701. The 1863 home of Enoch Lockhart, the first canal superintendent, commanding a direct view of the works.. In the end, the government simply directed the company to finance the needful improvements on its own. A $865,000 plan was approved and undertaken in 1860 but was almost immediately shelved by the Civil War. The facility was a target of Confederate forces in Kentucky, at least one of whom advocated destroying it so \\"future travelers would hardly know where it was\\",United States Army Corps of Engineers. Civil War Engineering and Navigation . but Union control of the state rendered the threat moot. The loans involved in the original plan, however, meant that the company was $1.6 million in debt by 1866. Radical Republican control of Congress meant that the Army Corps of Engineers was finally allowed to take over improvements for the canal in 1867. Two new locks, each long and wide, opened in February 1872. =Government control= In May 1874, Congress passed a bill allowing the Corps of Engineers to take full control of the canal and authorizing the Treasury to pay off the bonds for the recent improvements. By 1877, despite the vastly increased use of railroads, traffic on the canal had tripled from any previous level.Trescott, 702-706. This was mostly heavy, low-value industrial supplies such as coal, salt, and iron ore. In 1880, under political pressure from upriver producers, Congress removed the canal's tolls entirely, forgoing profit and paying the entirety of its expenses from the Treasury.Trescott, 706 f. A new lock was built in 1921 as a part of Congress's plan for the \\"canalization\\" of the Ohio River. Further expansions in 1962, increasing the width of the canal to , caused the canal to be known as the McAlpine Locks and Dam.. Economic impact In the 19th century, the high toll and insufficient capacity of the canal served Louisville well, permitting high profits for shareholders without greatly curtailing the portage and related sectors of the local economy. The gradual buyout well-compensated the owners for their initial investments in the venture. Louisville boomed at the expense of its onetime partners Portland and Shippingport, which were relegated to backwater status. Portland, after initially continuing to grow and incorporating separately in 1834, accepted a proposal to widen the canal and annexation to west Louisville in 1837 in exchange for its wharf becoming the terminus of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad; when the western line of the railroad only managed to successfully connect Portland with Louisville before its 1840 bankruptcy, the community removed itself again from 1842 to 1852, before accepting reannexation. Much of the community was destroyed by or razed after the floods of 1937 and 1945. Shippingport, included within Louisville's borders during its 1828 incorporation and enisled by the canal, declined slowly until the government bought out the remaining families in 1958.. At the same time, these factors blunted the economic impact of the canal on other communities up- and downstream. Although (even at its highest tolls) the canal decreased the freight rate along the river, it did not permit significantly lower prices in commodities, which fell at a faster rate in the 25 years before the canal opened than they did in the 25 years afterwards. The 1850s and 1860s particularly saw usage of the canal merely plateau despite booming growth in river traffic.

Kate was among the earliest recorded women in country music, and arguably her best remembered song was a rendition of her father's composition \\"Little Mary Phagan\\". Carson was born the youngest of nine children in Atlanta, Georgia. As early as the age of five, she appeared as a vocalist and dancer at stage shows and political rallies as an accompaniment to her father's musical act. By age 14, Carson proficiently performed with the guitar and banjo as she played alongside her father on Atlanta's flagship radio station, WSB, and toured with him and the Virginia Reelers throughout Georgia. When Carson graduated from high school, she became a permanent member of the band. In June 1925, Carson made her recording debut accompanying her father on guitar on four sides for OKeh Records. In the same session, she also recorded two solo efforts, \\"The Lonely Child\\", which was about a lonely wandering orphan, and \\"Little Mary Phagan\\". The somber ballad was composed by Fiddlin' Jon Carson in 1915, as a response to the notorious, and highly publicized murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan, which was allegedly perpetrated by her manager, Leo Frank. She played and recorded with the Virginia Reelers until 1934, adopting the stage name Moonshine Kate in 1928 at the suggestion of Okeh Records man Polk Brockman. Many of Kate's recordings for Okeh play up her name, consisting of short musical passages interspersed with quick-witted dialogues revolving around the moonshine trade. The Great Depression ended the Carsons' recording days, and she continued to perform intermittently, also working with Eugene Talmadge on his 1932 bid for Governor of Georgia and for the Atlanta Department of Recreation. She married in 1944 and retired in Georgia. In 1983, both she and her father were inducted into the Atlanta Country Music Hall of Fame.

Then in 1976 the group rented an old hotel in Carlton which was named Tara House by Lama Thubten Yeshe. In 1977 the center moved to a rented house in Kew and began to develop a retreat centre at Noojee in 1978. The first resident teacher, Geshe Dawö arrived in 1980 with his translator, Kelsang Tsering. Following the advice and persuasion of Lama Thubten Yeshe in 1981 to \\"think big\\" Tara House bought an old mansion in East St Kilda in 1983. By 1987 this location had become too small and so the current building at Marillac House, which incorporates an historic mansion, was purchased. The centre was then renamed Tara Institute.

He was often dubbed \\"The Original Singing Cowboy\\". Sprague was one of the first country musicians on record, recording in the early 1920s. Biography Sprague grew up on a farm near Houston, Texas and learned traditional cowboy songs as a child. During his college years at Texas A&M;, he played in a band and, later on, worked as an athletic trainer. He also found time to conduct a weekly radio program on campus. Sprague served in World War I. He graduated from college in 1922 and was offered occasional work performing on radio. He received a recording contract by Victor in 1925. In August, the same year, he went to Camden, New Jersey to record his first ten songs. His debut sides were \\"When the Work's All Done This Fall\\" and \\"Bad Companions\\"; the former would go on to sell over 900,000 copies. His recording of \\"The Dying Cowboy\\" became a hit in 1926. Other successful recordings were \\"The Boston Burglar\\" and \\"The Two Soldiers.\\" He recorded with Victor until 1929, releasing 33 songs. In the 1930s he moved to Bryan, Texas and ceased recording, though he would return to play folk festivals during the genre's resurgence in the 1950s and 1960s. He died in 1979 in Bryan, Texas.

It is based on a story written by George W. George and Robert Altman. The drama features Lawrence Tierney and, in her final screen appearance, Priscilla Lane. Plot After being put on suspension at the LAPD, Mike Carter punches his lieutenant and quits in disgust. A few days later, at a baseball game, he is approached by Fred Dyson, who wants to hire Carter as a bodyguard for his aunt, Jean Dyson, a widow and head of Continental Meat Packing Corp. Carter refuses. Later, at his apartment, an envelope is slipped under the door with $2000 in it. Carter rushes out, but the person who did it is already gone. Carson drives to the Dyson mansion in Pasadena, where he pushes his way in and, after meeting the members of the household, finds Mrs. Dyson is uninterested in having a bodyguard. Carter returns the money to Fred, but just as he is leaving, someone shoots at Mrs. Dyson but gets away. After she goes to bed, Fred convinces Carter to stay, just for the night, and Carter takes back the money. At 3:45 am, Carter catches Mrs. Dyson's secretary, Connie, digging the bullets out of the wall, then sees Mrs. Dyson drive away. He follows her car to the downtown Los Angeles warehouse district, where he is hit on the head, waking up later in his car, with the lieutenant shot dead beside him, on the railroad tracks with a train bearing down. Carter barely gets out in time. Realizing he is being framed for the lieutenant's murder, he asks his fiancee, Doris, who is the lieutenant's secretary, to find out all she can about the cases the lieutenant was working on. She drives him to the Dyson home; finding Jean not at home he goes to tbe plant; she is not there either. In the info on lieutenant Bordon's cases, one stands out, the death of an inspector at the Continental Meat Packing plant. Back at the Dyson mansion, Carter confronts Mrs. Dyson about her movements that morning. After she gives him a plausible explanation, he calls Doris and asks her to bring him more information on the inspector's death. He then talks to the dead man's brother, who recognizes Carter as being wanted by the police. Carter discovers evidence that the inspector's sight was not as faulty as claimed in the accident report. Narrowly avoiding arrest checking out the testimony of the optometrist at his office, Carter next tries to find information at the glasses manufacturer; it's after hours so he breaks in. Finding the information he needs, he calls the captain and tells him to meet him at the Dyson home. Meanwhile, at the plant, where she went despite Carter telling her not to, Doris spies on Fred and Fenton, the supervisor. At the mansion, Carter confronts Mrs. Dyson, who reveals that Freddie thinks Fenton has been tampering with the meat and that the inspector was murdered to cover it up. Carter tells her he believes Fred is in with Fenton on the fraud. Discovering Doris is in danger at the plant, Carter steals the police car and heads to the plant. At the plant, Fred, after revealing how he will frame Fenton for the deaths and exonerate himself, shoots Fenton dead. Carter arrives just as Fred is about to shoot Doris and, after Feed runs out of bullets, fights with and knocks out Fred. The police arrive and take both Carter and Fred into custody. The next scene shows the newlywed Mr. & Mrs. Mike Carter heading off for their honeymoon in a police cruiser.

Sirin in Berlin in 1924. It was first published in Rul, a Russian émigré paper founded by his father, Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov, and later included in a number of short story collections: Vozvrashchenie Chorba, Tyrants Destroyed and Other Stories (1975), and The Stories of Vladimir Nabokov (1995). He and his son, Dmitri Nabokov, provided the English translation. Plot summary The story has an outer narrator who receives the story by Sack, the inner narrator. Sack is the impresario of Bachmann, but he is callous, and does not care for him. The core story deals with the love relationship between Mme. Perov and Bachmann. Bachmann is an awkward and eccentric pianist and composer to whom she is introduced at a party where she (like the reader) first mistakes Sack for Bachmann. Sack speaks disparagingly of B, who has \\"no brains\\". Sack has to track him down frequently as he being an alcoholic tends to disappear before his performances. Mme Perov becomes a necessary and enhancing facilitator for the musical genius; he always made sure that she was sitting in the first row when he was performing. One night, when she was sick and absent, Bachmann refused to play and insulted the audience (Sack complained that he was showing them \\"the fig - instead of the fugue\\"). Sack dragged her out of her bed to the theatre, but Bachmann had left already. Sack made her look for Bachmann in a cold and rainy night, and when she finally returned to the hotel, she found Bachmann in the room. The outer narrator describes their togetherness: \\"I think that these two, the deranged musician and the dying woman, that night found words the greatest poets never dreamed of\\". She died the next day. Bachmann disappeared after the funeral and became insane. Sack saw him later in a deplorable state and avoided him. Comments The complex construction of the story shows a tension between the unfeeling and callous inner narrator who may well carry some responsibility for Mme Perov's death and Bachmann's madness, and the more sympathetic outer narrator who shows two unique individuals who find inner fulfillment in their relationship and transform themselves. The outer narrator has no direct involvement in the events but knows more than what Sack tells him. The portrait of the artist as a unique and vulnerable person who does not fit in and is eccentric and close to madness is later picked up in the figure of Luzhin in his novel The Defense. A reference to the famous contemporary pianist Pachmann is present in the name, but also in the early recording (\\"in wax\\") of the performances, and the use of gestures towards the audience. The description of the female character as a stabilizing and uplifting factor for the genius was written shortly after Nabokov met his future wife who in a way had a similar enhancing effect upon Nabokov's life. Vera, too, was always sitting in the front row when he was lecturing.

Stationed in the interbellum in the garrison in Kolomyja, it participated in the Polish September Campaign, fighting in southern Poland. It became famous after its night attack on parts of the German Independent Regiment SS-Standarte Germania. History The Regiment was created in early 1919, and was based on the 15th Infantry Rifle Regiment of General Haller's Blue Army. In September 1919 it was renamed to 40th Kresy Infantry Rifle Regiment – and in March 1920 – to 49th Kresy Infantry Regiment. Most of its soldiers were Hutsuls (firstly volunteers, then conscripts), and this was recognized by the headquarters of the Polish Army, which on April 12, 1937, decided to name its 1st Battalion as the Hutsul Battalion of the Polish Legions, in appreciation of the outstanding World War I service of the Hutsul Company of the Polish Legions. Then, on March 4, 1938, the adjective Hutsul was attributed to the whole Regiment. Also, soldiers of the Regiment were ordered that during special events they should wear hats and coats based on traditional Hutsul folk clothes. Polish September Campaign In early September 1939, the Regiment, commanded by Colonel Karol Hodala was moved west and ordered to defend the lines of the Wisłok, Wisłoka and San rivers, together with other units of the Army Karpaty. On Sunday, September 10, in the town of Błażowa, 30 soldiers of the Regiment under Lieutenant Edmund Szczot organized a trap on a German column, which belonged to the 4th Light Division. Eleven German soldiers were killed, and the Poles captured several documents, including maps and orders. Polish losses were limited to two wounded. However, German superiority was crushing and Polish units did not take advantage of the success. During the following days, the Regiment was forced to retreat, fighting several skirmishes with advancing Wehrmacht. Finally, on September 14, it found itself in the area of Sadowa Wisznia and Jaworów. =Night attack= On the night of September 15/16, 1939, the 49th Hutsul Rifle Regiment and the 98th Infantry Regiment (38. Reserve ID) attacked parts of the SS-Standarte Germania, which was stationed in the villages of Przelbice, Muzylowice, Mogiła and Czarnokonce. The SS had been ordered to close the roads leading east and prevent Polish troops from reaching Lwów. It has been established that in Muzylowice, where the main Polish attack took place, the following German units were stationed: the regiment's HQ, 3rd. battalion and support subunits. To catch the SS by surprise, Colonel Hodala and Colonel Bronisław Prugar-Ketling (commandant of the 11th Carpathian Infantry Division) ordered their soldiers to unload their rifles and use bayonets. After 30-minutes of fierce hand-to-hand combat, which started at 9 pm, the Germans suffered heavy casualties, with at least 205 KIA and WIA. The commander of the III battalion SS-Obersturmbannführer Willy Koeppen and the regiment's aide-de-camp SS-Obersturmführer Schomburg were among those killed by bayonets. The regiment's HQ fled to Jaworów and German soldiers scattered in panic across the area. Several prisoners were taken and the SS lost almost all of its heavy equipment, including 16 75mm artillery pieces, 8 105mm artillery pieces, 15 AT guns, the majority of mortars, plus all vehicles (20 armored vehicles and transporters, 70 motorcycles, 50 trucks and cars). The battleground was witnessed on September 16 by General Kazimierz Sosnkowski, who later described these events in his book \\"Cieniom września\\". The Colonel Prugar-Ketling also described the night attack in his memoirs \\"Aby dochować wierności\\". He wrote that the 30-minute attack was carried out in complete silence and the panic was visible the next day on the terrified faces of the dead German soldiers. Prugar-Ketling, who died in 1948, was shocked to see how much equipment was captured. =Aftermath= Even though Polish success was complete, the Germans quickly re-organized their defence, and called for aerial support. The Poles, on the other hand, did not have men experienced enough to utilise the captured equipment, and decided to destroy most of it with grenades. The 49th Hutsul Regiment managed to reach Lwów on September 19, and there it capitulated to the Red Army, together with Lwów's garrison.

Built just before the 1892 Homestead Strike, it was used as headquarters by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers and for reporters covering the confrontation. It is the only significant building associated with the strike that remains intact. It is a contributing property to the Homestead Historic District. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1999. After some use as a rooming house and hotel, today it serves as the headquarters and visitor center for the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area.Heritage Areas, National Park Service: Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area, National Park Service, n.d. Accessed 2012-04-27. Museum The museum features displays the area's industrial, social and cultural history. Exhibits include two restored rooms reflecting the 1892 Homestead Strike by the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers during the Homestead Lockout and Strike, and a room dedicated to the Homestead Steel Works. Visitors can pick up information about other sites of the area as well as driving tours of the area's communities that reflect the industries of steel, coal, aluminum and glass. Building The building is , located at the corner of East Eighth and Heisel Avenue. It is three stories high, faced in brick laid in common bond, resting on a stone foundation and topped with a flat asphalt roof. Bands of stone run along the slightly skewed south (front) facade at the tops of all six windows on the upper stories, forming lintels to complement the similar sills. The roofline is marked with stepped brick corbels on the south and east. At the ground level on the east is a glass and aluminum storefront. Inside, the first floor serves as a museum, with original floorboards and period wallpaper. One room has exhibits devoted to the history of the strike, the other to the building's restoration. The second and third stories consist of guest rooms that have been left largely intact since the strike. At the second floor stair landing, and the top of the stair, there is a section where the paint has peeled off and exposed graffiti on the underlying plaster. Pencilled in are the words \\"Homestead 1892\\" and some names. It is possible that it was left during the strike. History Intended as a hotel for new hires or prospective hires at the growing Homestead Steel Works, which at the time were just next door, it had not entirely been finished inside when the company locked out its workers, precipitating the eventual strike. The union found it an ideal headquarters, since its upper floors had a commanding view of the factory next door. Reporters from American and British newspapers who covered the strike wired home their dispatches from a telegraph office on the first story. Deputy sheriffs and Pinkerton men taken captive during some of the violent confrontations were held at the Bost Building to protect them from retribution. After the strike, the building did become a hotel and rooming house, although it was never successful in the long term. The only significant change to it was the alteration of the storefront during the 20th century, and some changes to the upper floors during its late 20th-century renovation to comply with contemporary fire codes.

He was the sixth sultan of the Nasrid dynasty, succeeding to the throne at ten years old when his father, Ismail I (), was assassinated. The initial years of his reign were marked by conflict among his ministers, who vied for control of the young sultan's government. This escalated into a civil war between the party of the vizier Muhammad ibn al-Mahruq and that of the powerful commander of the Volunteers of the Faith, Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula. Uthman declared Muhammad's uncle, Muhammad ibn Faraj, as a rival sultan and secured support from Alfonso XI of Castile (), Granada's Christian neighbour to the north. Muhammad IV requested help from Abu Said Uthman II () of the Marinid Sultanate in Morocco and gave him territories in the Iberian Peninsula, including Ronda, Marbella, and Algeciras, probably in exchange for Marinid troops. The civil war ended in 1328 when Muhammad, who despite his youth had begun taking a more active role in government, reconciled with Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula, and ordered Ibn al-Mahruq assassinated; the pretender Muhammad ibn Faraj was sent to North Africa. In 1329 he appointed his childhood tutor Abu Nuaym Ridwan as the ' (chamberlain), outranking his other ministers; this was the first time the title appeared in the Emirate of Granada. In 1328 and 1329, Alfonso XI formed an anti-Granada alliance with another Iberian monarch, Alfonso IV of Aragon (). Both Christian kingdoms invaded Granada in 1330, with Alfonso XI leading his army to take Teba and pillage the Granadan countryside. Muhammad sought terms, and secured a treaty with Castile on 19 February 1331. Alfonso XI soon broke the treaty by stopping food exports to Granada as had been agreed, while Aragon did not join the treaty and was invaded by Granadan forces. In September 1332, Muhammad sailed to the Marinid court at Fez to request help. The new Marinid Sultan Abu al- Hasan Ali () sent 5,000 troops, led by his son Abu Malik Abd al-Wahid, to Algeciras in early 1333. The troops besieged the Castilians at Gibraltar: the town surrendered in June 1333 but was in turn besieged by Alfonso XI. Muhammad raided Castile in a diversionary attack before marching to relieve Gibraltar. This resulted in a stalemate that ended with a truce on 24 August 1333 that lifted the siege of Gibraltar and restored the 1331 treaty. One day later, Muhammad was assassinated (aged 18) on the orders of the sons of Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula (who had died in 1330), who resented either the sultan's alliance with the Marinids or his friendliness with Castile. He was succeeded by his brother Yusuf I ().  Background  alt=Colored map of the Iberian Peninsula and Western North Africa Founded by Muhammad I in the 1230s, the Emirate of Granada was the last Muslim state on the Iberian Peninsula. Through a combination of diplomatic and military manoeuvres, the emirate succeeded in maintaining its independence, despite being located between two larger neighbours: the Christian Crown of Castile to the north and the Muslim Marinid Sultanate across the sea in Morocco. Granada intermittently entered into alliance or went to war with both of these powers, or encouraged them to fight one another, in order to avoid being dominated by either. From time to time, the sultans of Granada paid tribute to the kings of Castile, an important source of income for Castile and a heavy burden for Granada. From Castile's point of view, Granada was a royal vassal, but the European concept of vassalage was alien to the Islamic world. Muhammad I, for instance, on occasion declared his fealty to other Muslim sovereigns. Between the last decades of the 13th century and the mid-14th century, in what modern historians call the \\"Battle of the Strait\\" (Batalla del Estrecho), Granada, Castile, and the Marinids contended for the strategically important ports of the Straits of Gibraltar, such as Algeciras, Gibraltar, and Tarifa, which controlled passage between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. At the time of Muhammad IV's accession, Castile held Gibraltar (after a siege in 1309), allowing it to interfere with traffic into the nearby Algeciras, while Granadan control of Algeciras similarly impeded traffic into Gibraltar from the Castilian-held Tarifa and elsewhere. Another Christian power in the peninsula, the Crown of Aragon was at peace with Granada following the 1321 treaty between the two kingdoms, which included a provision for free movement for Aragonese Muslim subjects who wished to emigrate to Muslim lands.  Early life  Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Ismail was born in the city of Granada on 14 April 1315 (7 Muharram 715 AH), the first son of Sultan Ismail I, who took the throne in February 1314 after deposing his uncle Nasr. His mother was Alwa, a Christian. On 8 July 1325 (26 Rajab 725 AH), his father was assassinated by a relative, Muhammad ibn Ismail. According to Ibn al-Khatib and the Castilian Chronicle of Alfonso XI, the direct motive of the attack was a personal grievance, but the Castilian chronicle adds that it was secretly masterminded by Uthman ibn al-Ula, the or the commander of the Volunteers of the Faith—North African troops in Granadan service. The assassin, as well as his brother who participated in the attack, were arrested and killed on the spot, but Uthman was not incriminated. According to Ibn Khaldun, Uthman was instead the person who found and executed the murderer. The ten-year-old Muhammad was proclaimed sultan on the same day. Ismail's vizier (chief minister), Abu al- Hasan ibn Mas'ud, was wounded while defending Ismail I during the assassination, but managed to rally the court to declare their allegiance to Muhammad IV. Among the people who swore their allegiance were judges, preachers, sufis, ulama, grammarians, and secretaries of the chancery. Muhammad's paternal grandmother, Fatima bint al-Ahmar, lent crucial support to his accession, and provided additional legitimacy because it was through her that Muhammad IV descended from previous sultans of Granada, while his grandfather Abu Said Faraj did not belong to the lineage of sultans.  Reign = The young sultan and his ministers = A map of the Emirate of Granada, depicting relevant towns and cities Due to his youth, he was subject to the influence of his court ministers and his grandmother. At first Ibn Mas'ud continued to serve as vizier, but he died from infections of his wounds a month after Muhammad's accession. He was replaced by the Muhammad ibn al- Mahruq, nominated by Uthman, who kept his post as the commander of the Volunteers. Uthman's military command and his link to the vizier made him a powerful figure in the young sultan's court. Muhammad's guardianship was left to his tutor, Abu Nuaym Ridwan, and his grandmother, both of whom also participated in government. Soon, Uthman's despotic behaviour alienated the other ministers, as he deprived them of authority and appropriated the state funds almost exclusively for the payment of the Volunteers. This led Ibn al- Mahruq to fear that the ambitious Uthman was planning a coup to seize power for himself. An open rivalry emerged between the two, which climaxed in December 1326, when Uthman's troops occupied the city and forced Ibn al-Mahruq and his followers to confine themselves to the Alhambra palace, while Ibn al- Mahruq appointed Yahya ibn Umar ibn Rahhu, Uthman's son-in-law and a member of the Banu Rahhu clan, as a rival commander of the Volunteers. This led the Volunteer troops to abandon Uthman, who was left with his own family and their followers, numbering only 1,000 men. = Civil war = Uthman and his followers marched to Almería, pretending that he planned to return from that port to his native North Africa. However, there he invited an uncle of Muhammad IV, Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Faraj, and declared him a rival sultan in late January 1327, with the laqab (regnal honorific) al-Qaim bi-amr Allah (\\"He who carries out God's orders\\"). Uthman and Abu Abdullah won the allegiance of the people of the nearby fortress of Andarax on 4 April. Uthman turned it into his stronghold for the struggle against Muhammad's ministers. The surrounding areas soon also recognised his authority, throwing Granada into an open civil war. Uthman made contact with the Castilians to support him in the war. King Alfonso XI of Castile quickly took advantage of the division in Granada by invading its western provinces, and some Muslim sources even report that one of Uthman's sons guided Alfonso XI during his invasion of the province of Ronda and the capture of Olvera, in June 1327. Subsequently, Alfonso conquered Pruna, followed by the nearby Ayamonte and Torre Alháquime which both surrendered without a fight. At sea, the Granadan fleet was defeated by that of the Castilian admiral Alfonso Jofré Tenorio: three galleys and 300 men were captured and taken to Seville. Muhammad's court was forced to seek help from the Marinid Sultanate, and he had to surrender Ronda and Marbella, followed by Algeciras in the next year, to the Marinids, probably in exchange for troops. The Marinid sultan Abu Said Uthman II sent troops to the peninsula in 1327 and 1328 to help Muhammad. Meanwhile, Muhammad, now 13 years old, began to exercise effective control of his government. The losses inflicted by the civil war caused him to change course: in July/August 1328, he effected a reconciliation with Uthman ibn al-Ula, who settled in Guadix. On 6 November 1328 Muhammad ordered his household slaves to assassinate Ibn al- Mahruq. Muhammad reappointed Uthman as shaykh al-ghuzat, a post that he held until his death in 1330. Uthman, back in his previous position of power, sent the pretender Abu Abdullah to North Africa, definitively ending the civil war. = Political developments up to 1329 = Alfonso XI had been proclaimed to have reached majority on 13 August 1325, his fourteenth birthday, ending the period of weak leadership that had followed the death of his regents at the Battle of the Vega of Granada in 1319 and the decisive Granadan victory in that battle. He was involved during the civil war between Muhammad's ministers, fighting on Uthman's side and capturing frontier castles in 1327. His neighbour, James II of Aragon, maintained peaceful relations with Granada, having signed a peace treaty with Muhammad IV in 1326, based on the previous treaty with Ismail I in 1321. James II died in 1327 and was succeeded by his son Alfonso IV, who took a more belligerent stance towards Granada. The new Aragonese king was wary of Muhammad's alliance with the Marinids, while the latter increased their naval activities in the Straits of Gibraltar and reportedly planned to invade Spain. He renewed his father's treaty with Muhammad, but at the same time he allied himself with Alfonso XI, signing the treaties of Agreda in 1328, and of Tarazona on 6 February 1329, aiming at a joint attack against Granada. Alfonso IV also married the Castilian king's sister, Eleanor. He cancelled the Aragon–Granada treaty in March 1329, citing persistent Muslim attacks, and instead declared war on Granada. Against the Aragon–Castile alliance, the Granadan military in 1329 included 4,000 horsemen, including 3,000 North African and 1,000 Andalusians. Among these, 1,000 North Africans and 600 Andalusians were deployed to garrison the capital. On 17 May 1329 (17 Rajab 729), Muhammad appointed his former tutor Abu Nuaym Ridwan as (chamberlain). This was the first time the office of appeared in the history of the Nasrids. The office was modeled after the of the 10th century Umayyad Caliphate of Córdoba: the acted as a sort of prime minister, outranked the vizier and the other ministers and had command of the army in the absence of the sultan. Ridwan, a Castilian-Catalan convert to Islam who rose through the ranks during the reign of Ismail I, would continue to hold the post during the reign of Muhammad's successor Yusuf I and the first reign (1354–1359) of Muhammad V, except for a brief pause during Yusuf's rule. = Countering Christian invasion = The Battle of Teba, in which Muhammad IV's forces were defeated by Alfonso XI After Pope John XXII declared the war against Granada a crusade in February 1330, Alfonso IV sent 500 knights to invade Granada's border areas, while Alfonso XI personally led his troops from Córdoba in July 1330. Castilian forces laid siege to the fortress of Teba on 7 August, and were confronted by the 6,000-strong Granadan army led by Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula. The Granadan forces were defeated, and the fortress surrendered on 30 August. Uthman died in the same year at Málaga, and was replaced by his son Abu Thabit Amir as commander of the Volunteers. Crusading forces operating independently from Alfonso XI ravaged the Granadan countryside, causing severe food shortages and leading Muhammad to sue for peace. A peace treaty was agreed on 19 February 1331 in Seville, which was to last for four years. Muhammad agreed to pay tribute to Castile and to send his representative to pay homage to Alfonso XI annually. As part of the peace treaty, Castile agreed to export wheat and livestock to alleviate the shortage in Granada. Despite Muhammad's request, Alfonso IV refused to join the treaty. Alfonso XI soon broke the truce by stopping the food exports to Granada. Granada continued to be in a state of war with Aragon. Muhammad sent an army led by Ridwan to invade the region around Alicante. The Granadan army sacked Guardamar on 18 October 1331, raided the surrounding countryside, then returned with captives as well as 400 Aragonese Muslims who had decided to join the army. Ridwan's army returned in April 1332 and besieged Elche for five days. Muhammad, considering the continuing threat to his realm and aware of Castile's treaty violation, requested help from the Marinid Sultan Abu al- Hasan Ali, who had succeeded Abu Said Uthman in August 1331. On 7 September, Muhammad personally sailed to Morocco to meet Abu al-Hasan at his court in Fez. The Marinid sultan responded positively, promising to send troops to help the Granadan Muslims and providing Muhammad with gifts. Muhammad also tried to form an alliance with the rebellious Castilian nobleman Juan Manuel. = Marinid help and the capture of Gibraltar = Abu al-Hasan's aid to Granada consisted of 5,000 soldiers, led by his son, Abu Malik Abd al-Wahid. They sailed to Algeciras in the beginning of 1333, soon besieging Gibraltar by sea and land. The Marinid army was joined by Granada's troops led by Ridwan. The Castilian admiral Alfonso Jofré Tenorio tried to deliver supplies to Gibraltar, but this was prevented by the blockading Marinid fleet. He attempted to fire bags of flour into the town using the trebuchets on his ships, but most of them did not reach the castle. Meanwhile, Muhammad unsuccessfully attacked Castro del Río, but subsequently captured the fortress of Cabra. Gibraltar's defenders surrendered on 17 June 1333, after about five months of siege, and were given safe conduct out of the town. Alfonso XI heard the news three days later, when his relieving army was just a few days' march away at Jerez. The Castilian attempt to retake Gibraltar, 1333. x20px Granada, x20px Castile, x20px The Marinids Alfonso XI hastened his march, crossing the Guadarranque by Castellar on 26 June and soon laying siege to retake Gibraltar. The Muslims had reinforced the town by moving supplies from Algeciras, and the troops of Abu Malik stationed in that town opposed Alfonso's army. To divert Castile's attention, Muhammad led a counterattack into Castilian territory, capturing Benamejí and raiding the areas surrounding Córdoba. He met with no resistance because Alfonso's army was pinned by Abu Malik's forces and the Castilian nobles who were supposed to oppose Muhammad rebelled and attacked the Alfonso's castles instead, joined by Juan Manuel who had deserted Alfonso's camp. Muhammad then marched towards Gibraltar. Muhammad initially encamped on the banks of the Guadiaro near the besieged town, and then went to the Sierra Carbonera to join forces with Abu Malik. The Muslim and Christian armies faced off for several days, but after several skirmishes neither side was confident of a decisive victory. Alfonso was also worried about the destruction of his realm by his rebellious nobles. A truce was agreed on 24 August 1333, with Muhammad and Alfonso reaffirming the 1331 treaty of Seville. Muhammad visited Alfonso's tent bringing various gifts, while the Castilian king welcomed him on foot and bareheaded as a sign of respect, and they had a sumptuous meal together.  Death  Muhammad was assassinated on 25 August 1333 (13 Dhu al-Hijja 733 AH) near the mouth of the Guadiaro. Uthman ibn Abi al-Ula's sons, Abu Thabit—the new commander of the volunteers after his fathers death—and Ibrahim, were responsible for the plot, although the actual killing was carried out by a slave named Zayyan. According to near-contemporary historian Ibn Khaldun, Muhammad was killed by the two brothers because of his Marinid alliance: their family had been exiled to Granada as political dissidents by the Marinids, and considered the latter as their enemies. Moreover, the Marinid military involvement on the Iberian Peninsula caused the Volunteers of the Faith to lose the influence they previously had as the dominant military force fighting for Granada. Contrary to the Muslim sources, which cite the Marinid factor as the motive for the assassination, Castilian sources state that Muhammad was killed because of his excessive friendliness with Alfonso XI. According to the historian Brian Catlos, the Ridwan, who was present at the time of the assassination, rode quickly to the capital, arriving on the same day, and, after consultation with Fatima, arranged for the declaration of Muhammad's younger brother Abu'l-Hajjaj Yusuf as the new sultan, Yusuf I. This version of Yusuf's proclamation was also quoted by historians L. P. Harvey and Francisco Vidal Castro, who attribute it to Castilian sources. Francisco Vidal Castro favours another version in which the declaration and the oath of allegiance took place in the Muslim camp near Gibraltar instead of in the capital, and that the sons of Uthman were the ones who proclaimed him. Vidal Castro also writes that the proclamation happened on the day after Muhammad's death (26 August/14 Dhu al- Hijja). Muhammad's body was recovered and buried near the manor house (al- munya al-sayyid) in Málaga, also on 26 August. As per Islamic customs for a martyr, his body was buried immediately without washing. Later a domed mausoleum () was built on his tomb and poetic epitaphs were inscribed on his tombstone.  Character  His biographers wrote that he loved hunting, a common pastime of the Nasrid monarchs. He was also reported to be an accomplished rider, often competing with other riders in the arena. He was skilled in the martial arts, and interested in literature and poetry: he commissioned the Málagan poet Ibn al-Murabi al-Azdi to write verses about the Sierra Nevada and used to listen to poems as a way to relax. In early January 1332 he fell seriously ill and rumours circulated about his death, but he recovered on or before 23 January. At his death, aged around 18, he did not have any descendants, and was likely unmarried.

Landlocked and mountainous, it bordered Tajikistan and China to the south, Uzbekistan to the west and Kazakhstan to the north. The Kirghiz branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union governed the republic from 1936 until 1990. On 30 October 1990, the Kirghiz SSR was renamed to the Socialist Republic of Kyrgyzstan; on 15 December, after declaring its state sovereignty, it was renamed again to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. On 31 August 1991, it transformed into independent Kyrgyzstan. Etymology The name \\"Kyrgyz\\" is believed to have been derived from the Turkic word for \\"forty\\", in reference to the forty clans of Manas, a legendary hero who united forty regional clans against the Uyghurs. The name \\"Kyrgyz\\" or \\"Kirghiz\\" means \\"Land of the forty tribes\\", combined from three words: kyrg (kırk) meaning \\"forty\\", yz (uz) meaning \\"tribes\\" in East-Turkic, and -stan meaning \\"land\\" in Persian.Forty tribes and the 40-ray sun on the flag of Kyrgyzstan , SRAS–The School of Russian and Asian Studies Politically, the name of the republic was the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic as stated in the 1937 and 1978 Constitutions of the Kirghiz SSR. From 30 October 1990 to 15 December 1990, it was renamed the Socialist Republic of Kirghizia (or Kyrgyzstan). Afterwards, the \\"Socialist\\" prefix was dropped and it became the Republic of Kirghizia, which retained this name after independence.A Political Chronology of Central, South and East Asia. From 15 October 1990 to 15 December 1990, it was named the Socialist Republic of Kirghizia. History Established on 14 October 1924 as the Kara-Kirghiz Autonomous Oblast of the RSFSR, it was transformed into the Kirghiz ASSR (Kirghiz Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic) on 1 February 1926, still being a part of the RSFSR. The borders were not divided however by ethnic or linguistic lines. On 5 December 1936, with the adoption of the 1936 Soviet Constitution, it became a separate constituent republic of the USSR as the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic during the final stages of the national delimitation in the Soviet Union. At the time of formation of Kirghizia, its territory was divided into districts. On November 21, 1939 five oblasts (regions) were created: Jalal-Abad, Issyk Kul, Osh, Tyan Shan, and Frunze Oblasts. Tyan Shan Oblast was abolished in 1962, when the rest of the country with the exception of Osh was divided into districts of republican subordination. In 1970, Issyk-Kul and Naryn (formerly Tien Shan) were defined, and in 1980 so was Talas. In 1988, the Naryn and Talas oblasts were again abolished, but in 1990 they were restored. At the same time, Jalal-Abad and Chui (formerly Frunze) were reestablished. These districts were particularly known for their heavy application of fertilizers after independence. The Osh Massacre in 1990 undermined the position of the first secretary. That same year, on 15 December, the Kirghiz SSR was reconstituted as the Republic of Kyrgyzstan after declaring its sovereignty. On 17 March 1991, Kirghizia supported the Union preservation referendum with a 95.98% turnout. However, this did not come to pass when the hardliners took control of Moscow for three days in August 1991. Askar Akayev, the first president, unequivocally condemned the putsch and gained fame as a democratic leader. The country declared its independence on 31 August 1991 and the Soviet Union was formally dissolved on 26 December 1991. However, the 1978 constitution remained in effect after its independence until 1993. Politics Similar to that of the Soviet republics, Kirghizia's government took place in the framework of a one-party socialist republic with the Communist Party of Kirghizia as the sole legal political party. The First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kirghizia served as the head of the party, while the Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet functioned as the executive head of state and the Chairmen of the Council of Ministers led the legislative branch. EconomyDemographics In 1926, the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic had a population of 1,002,000 people. In 1939, 1,458,000 people were recorded. The population grew significantly in the decades after World War II; the republic had 2,065,837 people in 1959, 2,932,805 people in 1970, and 3,529,030 people in 1979. In the final Soviet census of 1989, the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic had grown to 4,257,755 people. The majority of the population were ethnic Kyrgyz people. However, because large numbers were sent here in deportations, at times there were significant other ethnic groups. Between March and May 1944 alone, it was reported in the Kremlin that 602,193 residents of the North Caucasus region had been deported to the Kirghiz and Kazakh SSRs, of which 496,460 were Chechens and Ingush, 68,327 of which were Karachai and 37,406 were Balkars. The majority of the Kyrgyz population were (as they are today) Muslims, speaking a Turkic language. Bishkek had the largest concentration of Russians in the country, some 22% of the population by independence, with Uzbek minorities in the Fergana Valley especially constituting some 13% of the population. In 1990, violent clashes between Uzbeks and Kyghyz peoples broke out in the Osh Raion; ethnic tension still remains in the region. =Religion= Under Soviet rule, Islam in Kirghizia was heavily suppressed with people actively encouraging atheism. Soviet authorities permitted limited religious activity in all the majority- Muslim Soviet republics. Most of the Russian population of Kirghizia were atheist or Russian Orthodox. After independence, the country enjoyed greater religious freedom and remains to this day a secular state. Geography A map of modern Kyrgyzstan, with the same borders as the former Kirghizia Kirghizia, a landlocked republic in Soviet Central Asia shared its borders with Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan as well as China on the outside lying between latitudes 39° and 44° N, and longitudes 69° and 81° E. It is farther from the sea than any other individual country, and all its rivers flow into closed drainage systems which do not reach the sea. The mountainous region of the Tian Shan covers over 80% of the country, with the remainder made up of valleys and basins. Issyk-Kul Lake, or Ysyk-Köl in Kyrgyz, in the north- eastern Tian Shan is the largest lake in Kyrgyzstan and the second largest mountain lake in the world after Titicaca. The highest peaks are in the Kakshaal-Too range, forming the Chinese border. Peak Jengish Chokusu, at , is the highest point and is considered by geologists to be the northernmost peak over in the world. Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for hydro-electricity. Culture As the Soviet Union respected other cultures even after delimitation, there are a wide variety of cultural items in Kirghizia listed here: * Manas, an epic poem * Komuz, a three-stringed lute * Tush kyiz, large, elaborately embroidered wall hangings * Shirdak, flat cushions made in shadow-pairs * Other textiles, especially made from felt * Falconry =Traditions= Apart from celebrating the New Year each 1 January, Kirghizia, like all Soviet Republics, observed the Great October Socialist Revolution on 7 November. Its festivals and traditions such as Nowruz and Ulak Tartish were suppressed by the Soviet authorities. The tradition of bride kidnapping, remains illegal to this day, was suppressed by the Soviet regime. It is debatable whether bride kidnapping is actually traditional. Some of the confusion may stem from the fact that arranged marriages were traditional, and one of the ways to escape an arranged marriage was to arrange a consensual \\"kidnapping.\\"\\"Reconciled to Violence: State Failure to Stop Domestic Abuse and Abduction of Women in Kyrgyzstan\\".

Greene Memorial Museum, also known as Greene Geological Museum or Greene Museum, is a mineral and fossil museum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin administered by the Department of Geosciences at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. Original building The original fireproof museum building, designed by noted Milwaukee architect, Alexander Eschweiler, held the collection of Thomas A. Greene, Milwaukee druggist and amateur geologist, plant collector, and fossil collector. In 1913, Greene's heirs, Mrs. H.A.J. Upham and Mr. Howard Greene, had the facility built to house his collection, and it was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1993, in recognition of the collection's significance as a largely intact amateur geological collection. With The collection has been removed from the building, and is now displayed and housed in Lapham Hall on the UWM campus. The building has been renovated and is currently used as academic space for UWM's Sam and Helen Stahl Center for Jewish Studies.Quirk, Kathy. \\"Center for Jewish Studies Receives $2 Million Gift.\\" UWM Today v.11 no.2 (Fall 2009), p. 6 Collection Greene amassed most of the fossils in his collection, totaling about 75,000 specimens, during the 1880s and 1890s. The majority of these specimens come from the Silurian Racine Dolomite Formation and the Devonian Milwaukee Formation in the vicinity of southeastern Wisconsin. Preserved mostly as internal molds in dolomite, these fossils include a wide range of Silurian marine invertebrate groups including trilobites, crinoids, tabulate and rugose corals, brachiopods, cephalopods, and gastropods. Devonian fossils consist mainly of fish and plant remains. All of these fossils were collected from quarry outcrops that no longer exist, making the collection irreplaceable. The mineral collection contains a wide range of minerals and ores from localities throughout North America, as well as some from overseas. It includes exquisite examples of amethyst, apatite, stibnite, copper, tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, cobalt, nickel, mercury compounds, aluminum compounds, malachite, lapis-lazuli, tourmaline, garnet, labradorite, fluorite, beryl, and turquoise, among others. Perhaps the highlight of the mineral collection is a piece of iron meteorite that landed in nearby Washington County, Wisconsin. It was given to Greene by the scientist Increase A. Lapham, the namesake of Lapham Hall. Greene collaborated with another amateur, Dr. Fisk Holbrook Day, whose home in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, the Dr. Fisk Holbrook Day House, has also been designated a National Historic Landmark.

Background  It is not known when Zong Chuke was born, but it is known that his family was from Pu Prefecture (蒲州, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). His ancestors were originally from Nanyang, and his great-grandfather Zong Pi (宗丕) had served as an official during late Liang Dynasty (a period sometimes known as Western Liang). After Liang, then a vassal of Sui Dynasty, was terminated in 587 by Sui, which directly took control of its territory, Zong Pi resettled in what would eventually become Pu Prefecture. Zong Chuke's father Zong Ji (宗岌) served on the staff of Emperor Taizong's favorite son Li Tai the Prince of Wei and participated in a project that Li Tai commissioned—the writing of a work known as the Journal of Geography (Kuodi Zhi). Zong Chuke's mother was a cousin of Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), the second wife of Emperor Taizong's son and successor Emperor Gaozong. Zong Chuke had at least two brothers—an older brother named Zong Qinke, and a younger brother named Zong Jinqing (宗晉卿). Zong Chuke himself was described as tall, with a handsome beard. After passing the imperial examination, he served as an official, eventually serving as the deputy minister of census (戶部侍郎, Hubu Shilang) late in Emperor Gaozong's reign. After Emperor Gaozong's death in 683, his son Li Zhe the Crown Prince succeeded him (as Emperor Zhongzong), but Empress Wu retained actual power as empress dowager and regent. In 684, after he showed signs of independence, she deposed him and replaced him with brother Li Dan the Prince of Yu (as Emperor Ruizong), but wielded power even more firmly thereafter, and as the years went by, she showed signs that she wanted to be \\"emperor\\" herself rather than just empress dowager. Zong Chuke's brother Zong Qinke encouraged her, and in 690 created a number of modified Chinese characters as signs of good fortune.  During Wu Zetian's reign  Later in 690, Wu Zetian had Emperor Ruizong yield the throne to her, and she took the throne as emperor, establishing a new Zhou Dynasty and interrupting Tang Dynasty. She made Zong Qinke Neishi (內史) -- the head of the legislative bureau of government (鳳閣, Fengge) and a post considered one for a chancellor, while Zong Chuke remained a deputy minister and Zong Jinqing became a commander of the imperial guards. Just slightly over a month after taking the throne and making Zong Qinke a chancellor, however, she received accusations that Zong Qinke was corrupt and Zong Chuke and Zong Jinqing, in addition to being corrupt, also committed rape. She demoted Zong Qinke to be the sheriff of Zunhua County (遵化, in modern Qinzhou, Guangxi) while exiling Zong Chuke and Zong Jinqing to the same region. Zong Qinke died in exile, but Zong Chuke and Zong Jinqing were recalled after about a year in exile. It was probably around this time that he served as a low-level official at the minister of defense and became considered familiar with military matters. On one occasion, when there were reports that the Tujue chief Tashili Tudun (沓實力吐敦) was set to rebel. Zong Chuke, knowing that Tashili Tudun was faithful, opined that this must be a false report by Tashili Tudun's nephew Tashili Mozi (沓實力默子). Soon, news came that Tashili Mozi was the one who rebelled, and that he had been captured by joint forces of Tashili Tudun and Tang forces. In 697, Zong was serving as deputy minister of defense (夏官侍郎, Xiaguan Shilang) when Wu Zetian gave him the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (同鳳閣鸞臺平章事), making him a chancellor de facto. However, in 698, he was stripped of the chancellor designation, although he continued to serve as deputy minister of defense. Around this time, he developed an enmity with his cousin Wu Yizong (武懿宗) the Prince of Henan (a grandson of Wu Zetian's uncle Wu Shiyi (武士逸)). Around the new year 699, while Zong Chuke was serving as Wenchang Zuo Cheng (文昌左丞), one of the secretaries general of the executive bureau (文昌臺, Wenchang Tai), Wu Yizong submitted articles of impeachment against him and Zong Jinqing, accusing them of corruption and building mansions of excessive luxury. Zong Chuke was demoted to be the military advisor to the prefect of Bo Prefecture (播州, roughly modern Zunyi, Guizhou), while Zong Jinqing was exiled to Feng Prefecture (峰州, roughly Vĩnh Phúc Province, Vietnam). (It did appear that the Zongs had overly luxurious mansions, for when Wu Zetian's only daughter Princess Taiping visited their mansions, she stated, \\"Once we look at their mansions, it is like we have not lived.\\") After some time, Zong Chuke was allowed to move closer to the capital Luoyang, and he successively served as the prefect of Yu Prefecture (豫州, roughly modern Zhumadian, Henan), then deputy director of palace supplies (少府少監, Shaofu Shaojian), then prefect of Qi Prefecture (岐州, roughly modern Baoji, Shaanxi) and then Shan Prefecture (陝州, roughly modern Sanmenxia, Henan). He eventually became deputy minister of defense again, and in 704 was again made chancellor with the Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi designation. Later that year, however, he was accused of retaining a servant girl originally of Li Chongrun the Prince of Shao (Wu Zetian's grandson, whom she forced to commit suicide in 701), and he was demoted to be the commandant at Yuan Prefecture (原州, roughly modern Guyuan, Ningxia), as well as the commanding general of the army in the region.  During Emperor Zhongzong's second reign  Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup in 705, and Emperor Zhongzong was restored to the throne. Soon, his cousin Wu Sansi the Prince of Dejing became powerful as his trusted advisor and lover to his powerful wife Empress Wei. Zong Chuke was initially made the minister of husbandry (太僕卿, Taipu Qing), and soon, under Wu Sansi's advocacy, he was made the minister of defense (兵部尚書, Bingbu Shangshu), and Zong Jinqing was made the imperial architect (將作大臣, Jiangzuo Dachen). In 707, Emperor Zhongzong's son, Li Chongjun the Crown Prince, angry at insults thrown at him by his powerful sister Li Guo'er the Princess Anle and her husband Wu Chongxun (武崇訓, Wu Sansi's son) and LI Guo'er's repeated attempts to displace him to become crown princess, started a rebellion and killed Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun. When he next approached the palace, hoping to arrest Empress Wei, Li Guo'er, and Consort Shangguan Wan'er (Emperor Zhongzong's concubine, who was also having an affair with Wu Sansi), Zong Chuke was one of the commanders of the forces defending against Li Chongjun's forces, and subsequently, when Li Chongjun was defeated, it was Zong who sent forces after him and, after he was killed by his own guards, returned his head to the capital Chang'an. It was further at Zong's request that Li Chongrun's head be presented to the caskets of Wu Sansi and Wu Chongxun. He soon became a member of Empress Wei's faction, and later that year, he led a group of officials in presenting Empress Wei with the honorific title of Empress Shuntianyisheng (順天翊聖皇后). Further, he and LI Guo'er tried to implicate Princess Taiping and Li Dan the Prince of Xiang (the former Emperor Ruizong) in Li Chongjun's plot, but at the advice of Xiao Zhizhong, Emperor Zhongzong stopped investigations against Li Dan and Princess Taiping. He was, however, successful in getting Emperor Zhongzong to exile the chancellor Wei Yuanzhong, whose son Wei Sheng (魏升) had been forced to participate in Li Chongjun's rebellion. Later that year, he was made a commanding general of the imperial guards and given the de facto designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (同中書門下三品). However, he received praise from later historians when he, in 708, supported the proposal of the general Zhang Rendan in building three forts north of the Yellow River in order to control the local Tujue population, which was effective. (Zhang's proposal was opposed by most imperial officials, but Zong supported it strenuously, stating, \\"This will benefit the empire for 10,000 generations.\\") However, he was also criticized for his flattery of Emperor Zhongzong and Empress Wei, particularly his repeated presentation, either by himself or through proxy, of various signs of fortune purportedly showing that Emperor Zhongzong's line will last for 100 generations. Also in 708, Zong was involved in an incident that would cause Suoge (娑葛), the chieftain of the Tuqishi (突騎施), to rebel. Suoge had in 706 succeeded his father Wuzhile (烏質勒), and Wuzhile's subordinate Juechuo Zhongjie (闕啜忠節)The New Book of Tang, followed by the Zizhi Tongjian, referred to this person as Juechuo Zhongjie, but the Old Book of Tang referred to him as Ashina Zhongjie (阿史那忠節). had been unwilling to submit to Suoge. Juechuo was, however, unable to prevail over Suoge, and he was set to give up his forces and go to the Tang capital Chang'an, when the Tang general Zhou Yiti (周以悌) suggested to him the idea of bribing Zong and his ally and fellow chancellor Ji Chuna to launch an attack against Suoge. Juechuo did so, and Zong, after Juechuo's bribery, proposed to Emperor Zhongzong the idea of attacking Suoge in alliance with Tufan, which Emperor Zhongzong agreed despite opposition by the general Guo Yuanzhen. Suoge heard of this plan and acted first, successfully attacking several Tang outposts and then sending an envoy to Chang'an to demand that Zong be executed. Subsequently, Guo reported the facts of the situation to Emperor Zhongzong, and Emperor Zhongzong sent a peace envoy to make peace with Suoge and creating him Shisixing Khan. Subsequently, in 709, the censor Cui Wan (崔琬) submitted articles of impeachment against Zong and Ji for corruption that led to disaster on the borders. The protocol at that time required that, as the articles of impeachment were read, that the accused officials step out of the palace and await imperial instructions, but Zong did not do so and, in anger, spoke to Emperor Zhongzong and stated that he was faithful and being falsely accused. Instead of investigating, Emperor Zhongzong ordered Zong and Cui swear to brotherhood with each other, causing the people to give Emperor Zhongzong the semi-derogatory epithet of \\"Peacemaking Son of Heaven.\\" Later in 709, Zong was made Zhongshu Ling (中書令, the new title for the head of the legislative bureau, now renamed Zhongshu Sheng (中書省)). In 710, a low level official, Yan Qinrong (燕欽融) submitted an accusation to Emperor Zhongzong, stating that Empress Wei was committing adultery and that Li Guo'er, her second husband Wu Yanxiu (武延秀, also a nephew of Wu Zetian), and Zong were about to harm the imperial clan. Emperor Zhongzong summoned Yan to his presence and interrogated him, and Yan was insistent on his accusation. While Emperor Zhongzong was mulling over the matter, Zong had Yan killed, an act that, while Emperor Zhongzong did not punish him for, was displeased about, and this displeasure was said to begin to bring fear into the hearts of Empress Wei and her faction.  Death  Soon thereafter, Emperor Zhongzong died suddenly—a death that traditional historians believed to be a poisoning carried out by Empress Wei and Li Guo'er, to allow Empress Wei to eventually become emperor and Li Guo'er to become crown princess. For the meantime, Empress Wei made Emperor Zhongzong's son by a concubine, Li Chongmao the Prince of Wei, emperor (as Emperor Shang), while retaining power as empress dowager and regent. Under the initial proposal by Consort Shangguan and Princess Taiping, a power balance would be achieved in that Li Dan would be made coregent, and Consort Shangguan drafted a will on Emperor Zhongzong's behalf to that effect, but after the will was given to Zong Chuke and Empress Dowager Wei's cousin Wei Wen, Wei Wen and Zong, pointing out that this would cause Empress Dowager Wei to lose some of the power, altered it such that Li Dan would not be coregent. Meanwhile, the members of the Wei clan, Zong, Wu Yanxiu, and other officials Zhao Lüwen (趙履溫) and Ye Jingneng (葉靜能) were said to be trying to persuade Empress Dowager Wei to take over as emperor, and finding ways to eliminate Li Dan and Princess Taiping. However, Zong's friend Cui Riyong leaked this plan to Li Dan's son Li Longji the Prince of Linzi. Li Longji thereafter joined forces with Princess Taiping and her son Xue Chongjian (薛崇簡) and launched a coup, killing Empress Dowager Wei, Li Guo'er, and Wu Yanxiu. Zong put on mourning clothes (which included a white veil, thus covering his face) and tried to ride a donkey to flee. When he got to Tonghua Gate (通化門), one of Chang'an's city gates, the guard at the gate recognized him and tore off his veil. Zong was arrested and executed, as was his brother Zong Jinqing. It was said that while Zong Chuke followed Empress Wei, he actually also had designs to be emperor, once telling his friends, \\"In the beginning, when I was in an inferior office, I wanted to be chancellor. Now that I am a chancellor, I want to be Son of Heaven, even if only for a day.\\"  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 92. * New Book of Tang, vol. 109. * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 204, 206, 207, 208, 209.

The term adolescent and young people are often used interchangeably, as are the terms Adolescent Health and Youth Health. Young people's health is often complex and requires a comprehensive, biopsychosocial approach.  Adolescent health risks  Some young people engage in risky behaviours that affect their health and therefore the majority of health problems are psychosocial. Many young people experience multiple problems. These behaviours are established as a young person and go on to become the lifestyles of adults leading to chronic health problems. Social, cultural and environmental factors are all important. Young people have specific health problems and developmental needs that differ from those of children or adults: The causes of ill-health in adolescents are mostly psychosocial rather than biological. Young people often engage in health risk behaviours that reflect the processes of adolescent development: experimentation and exploration, including using drugs and alcohol, sexual behaviour, and other risk taking that affect their physical and mental health. Adolescent health also encompasses children's and young people's sexual and reproductive health (SRH). The World Health Organisation describes the leading health-related problems in the age group 10 – 19 years to include: *Early pregnancy and childbirth *HIV *Other infectious diseases *Mental health problems including depression and suicide *Violence *Alcohol and other drugs *Injuries both unintentional and self-injury *Sexual health / Infectious diseases *Malnutrition and obesity *Exercise and Nutrition *Tobacco use *Rights of adolescents *Adolescent and young adult oncology Young people often lack awareness of the harm associated with risk behaviours, and the skills to protect themselves as well as the lack knowledge about how and where to seek help for their health concerns. By intervening at this early life stage, many chronic conditions later in life can be prevented.  Key principles  Evidence-based practices include harm reduction and health promotion to intervene early in the life course and illness trajectory. Adoption of unhealthy behaviors are evident particularly during life stages involving transition such as the commencement of university where physical inactivity, sedentary activity and poor dietary habits prevail. Youth health is founded on collaborative approaches that address social justice. Youth development approaches include youth empowerment and youth participation. Their aim is to promote youth rights, youth voice and youth engagement.  Access to health-care services  Studies about young people's access to healthcare have identified major barriers including concerns about confidentiality, practitioners attitudes and communication style, environment, availability of services, cost and the developmental characteristics of young people. Marginalised young people can have greater difficulty accessing health services and need support to navigate the health system. The World Health Organisation 'Global standards for quality health-care services for adolescents' include: * Adolescents’ health literacy * Community support * Appropriate package of services * Providers’ competencies * Facility characteristics * Equity and non-discrimination * Standard Data and quality improvement * Adolescents’ participation Key health services for young people Youth Health includes adolescent medicine as a speciality, along with other primary and tertiary care services. Health services for young people include mental health services, child protection, drug and alcohol services, sexual health services. General Practitioners work alongside multidisciplinary health practitioners including psychology, social Work and Youth health nursing and school health services. Youth work and youth development services support and engage young people. Web based supports, such as Reach Out!, provide early intervention. Youth health services ('one-stop-shops' for young people) are specialist services providing multi-disciplinary, primary health care to young people. Focusing on engaging disadvantaged young people, they deliver flexible and unique services to young people in relaxed and comfortable youth-friendly environments. Youth health services work in partnership with other government and non-government services. Youth health services provide a range of entry-points and non-threatening services (such as creative arts, basic services such as showers and laundries, a drop in service, sports and recreational facilities), which encourage young people to connect with the service on their own terms. They also provide informal links to other support services and sectors including education, housing, financial support and legal services, offering support to young people who are dealing with complex issues. Youth health services understand the need to respond immediately to young people's requests for support and assistance and they share a common operating philosophy, which values social justice, equity, and a holistic view of young people's health and well being. Capacity building organisations support the Youth Health sector by providing access to information and resources, conducting research and providing training.  Effects of discrimination = Social-emotional distress = In a comprehensive review of research literature including 126 different studies that analyzed the relationship between perceived discrimination and social- emotional distress with effect sizes from small to moderate, perceived discrimination was shown to correlate with many social-emotional distresses for adolescents (Benner et al., 2018). Additionally, the study found that the more an adolescent perceived they were a victim of discrimination, the more likely it is that they will also report experiences with depression, anxiety, loneliness, and stress. = Risky health behaviors = Adolescents who report more discrimination also tend to report engaging in more risky health behaviors such as delinquency, anger, and other externalizing behaviors Other risky health behaviors include substance abuse and risky sexual behaviors like unprotected sex and sex with multiple partners. The data was taken from 71 different studies that analyze the relationship between perceived discrimination and risky health behaviors with effect sizes from small to moderate. The relationship between risky health behaviors in adolescents and discrimination can be partially explained by a greater tendency for school administrators to discipline minority students more often and more severely than other students (Mallett, 2016). This increase in discipline can lead to further delinquent and externalizing behaviors as they spend less time in the classroom environment. = Academics = Perceived discrimination has also been linked to lower academic performance in adolescents. Students who feel they face discrimination are more likely to have lower grade point averages (GPA), more absences, less engagement in class, and lower academic motivation. The data was taken from 73 different studies that analyze the relationship between perceived discrimination and academic outcomes in all areas with small effect sizes. The increased frequency of discipline also takes class time away from students which could contribute to their lowered academic outcomes. With less time in the classroom they do not receive the same amount of instruction that students in the classroom receive.  Research = The American teen study = Reliable research in adolescent sexual behavior has been subject to political interventions in the past, particularly with funding availability, and the formal peer review process. Reasons for political interventions pertaining to research in adolescent sexual behavior is rooted in conservative ideologies from political figures and activist organizations. These groups tend not to support funding for abstinence education rather than programming that might inadvertently support teenage sexual behavior. These political interventions result in less of an understanding of long-term adolescent risk- taking sexual behavior and thus disease prevention. The American Teen Study, which began in May 1991, was a peer-reviewed study on adolescent sexual risk- taking behavior whose funding from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development was shut down by former secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), Louis Sullivan. This cancellation led to further amendments created to halt the National Institutes of Health from funding research in adult and adolescent sexual behavior studies because conservative political figures such as, Gary Bauer, believed there was enough literature on this subject. However, the data meant to be collected from the American Teen Study was critical for accurately understanding the dynamics of how adolescents may come into contact with sexually transmitted infections, such as HIV, and how to further prevent adolescents from being infected. = The need for data = The American Teen Study acknowledged that there is insufficient data required for assessing rates of sexually transmitted infections among adolescents, which creates a barrier for trying to prevent infection rates and treatment of infections. HIV seroprevalence surveys, evaluating archived data on AIDS infections in the past, and adolescent risk-taking behaviors are the various types of data needed for accurately assessing the HIV infection trends among adolescents. Seroprevalence surveys give an idea about the rates of HIV infections among various groups of people, however, using this data solely is not always externally valid as it is not completely feasible to produce accurate rates of HIV among all of the groups being measured. Evaluating archived data of AIDS infections in the past is useful for obtaining an idea of how current HIV trends may be, but this data is not separated by age, which does not allow researchers to distinguish whether decreasing rates are applicable to adolescents. However, by integrating both of these methods, and further incorporating data on adolescent sexual behavior, the information would be more effective with determining HIV rates among various groups of adolescents. In addition, for future studies, researchers must incorporate comprehensive sample sizes, perform various research design types, understand the social norms that may influence risk-taking behaviors, and also be consistent with replicating research studies as risk-taking trends among adolescents may change. Overall, this data is needed in order to understand and effectively prevent infections of sexual transmitted infections, however, political figures policing peer-reviewed research studies gets in the way of obtaining this information. = Peer review process = Political interventions on peer-reviewed research may affect the integrity of the sciences, and political figures rescinding funding for certain studies they do not accept also affects the well-being of all individuals. It is recommended for specialist peer reviewers to have the freedom in being able to allocate funding for certain research studies, while also allowing a justified veto of funding decisions to be made by the HHS secretary if studies are later deemed as unethical. This reform is mindful that specialist peer reviewers will not be driven by personal bias, but instead by assuring that research funded is ethical, just, and neutral to the objective of the study, such as the American Teen Study.

Detection of genetic materials allows an early diagnosis of a disease because the detection of antigens and/or antibodies requires time for them to start appearing in the bloodstream.

Such NATs are called nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). There are several ways of amplification, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), strand displacement assay (SDA), or transcription mediated assay (TMA). Virtually all nucleic acid amplification methods and detection technologies use the specificity of Watson-Crick base pairing; single-stranded probe or primer molecules capture DNA or RNA target molecules of complementary strands. Therefore, the design of probe strands is highly significant to raise the sensitivity and specificity of the detection. However, the mutants which form the genetic basis for a variety of human diseases are usually slightly different from the normal nucleic acids. Often, they are only different in a single base, e.g., insertions, deletions, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In this case, imperfect probe-target binding can easily occur, resulting in false-positive outcomes such as mistaking a strain that is commensal for one that is pathogenic. Much research has been dedicated to achieving single-base specificity.  Advances Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) strands with corresponding sequences stick together in pairwise chains, zipping up like Velcro tumbled in a clothes dryer. But each node of the chain is not very sticky, so the double-stranded chain is continuously coming partway unzipped and re-zipping itself under the influence of ambient vibrations (referred to as thermal noise or Brownian motion). Longer pairings are more stable. Nucleic acid tests use a \\"probe\\" which is a long strand with a short strand stuck to it. The long primer strand has a corresponding (complementary) sequence to a \\"target\\" strand from the disease organism being detected. The disease strand sticks tightly to the exposed part of the long primer strand (called the \\"toehold\\"), and then little by little, displaces the short \\"protector\\" strand from the probe. In the end, the short protector strand is not bound to anything, and the unbound short primer is detectable. The rest of this section gives some history of the research needed to fine-tune this process into a useful test. In 2012, Yin's research group published a paper about optimizing the specificity of nucleic acid hybridization. They introduced a ‘toehold exchange probe (PC)’ which consists of a pre-hybridized complement strand C and a protector strand P. Complement strand is longer than protector strand to have unbound tail in the end, a toehold. Complement is perfectly complementary with the target sequence. When the correct target(X) reacts with the toehold exchange probe(PC), P is released and hybridized product XC is formed. The standard free energy(∆) of the reaction is close to zero. On the other hand, if the toehold exchange probe(PC) reacts with spurious target(S), the reaction forwards, but the standard free energy increases to be less thermodynamically favorable. The standard free energy difference(∆∆) is significant enough to give obvious discrimination in yield. The discrimination factor Q is calculated as, the yield of correct target hybridization divided by the yield of spurious target hybridization. Through the experiments on different toehold exchange probes with 5 correct targets and 55 spurious targets with energetically representative single-base changes (replacements, deletions, and insertions), Yin's group concluded that discrimination factors of these probes were between 3 and 100 + with the median 26. The probes function robustly from 10 °C to 37 °C, from 1 mM to 47 mM, and with nucleic acid concentrations from 1 nM to 5 M. They also figured out the toehold exchange probes work robustly even in RNA detection. Further researches have been studied thereafter. In 2013, Seelig's group published a paper about fluorescent molecular probes which also utilizes the toehold exchange reaction. This enabled the optical detection of correct target and SNP target. They also succeeded in the detection of SNPs in E. coli-derived samples. In 2015, David's group achieved extremely high (1,000+) selectivity of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) by introducing the system called ‘competitive compositions’. In this system, they constructed a kinetic reaction model of the underlying hybridization processes to predict the optimal parameter values, which vary based on the sequences of SNV and wildtype (WT), on the design architecture of the probe and sink, and on the reagent concentrations and assay conditions. Their model succeeded in a median 890-fild selectivity for 44 cancer-related DNA SNVs, with a minimum of 200, which represents at least a 30-fold improvement over previous hybridization- based assays. In addition, they applied this technology to assay low VAF sequences from human genomic DNA following PCR, as well as directly to synthetic RNA sequences. Based on the expertise, they developed a new PCR method called Blocker Displacement Amplification (BDA). It is a temperature- robust PCR which selectively amplifies all sequence variants within a roughly 20 nt window by 1000-fold over wildtype sequences, allowing easy detection and quantitation of hundreds of potentials variants originally at ≤ 0.1% allele frequency. BDA achieve similar enrichment performance across anneal temperatures ranging from 56 °C to 64 °C. This temperature robustness facilitates multiplexed enrichment of many different variants across the genome, and furthermore enables the use of in- expensive and portable thermocycling instruments for rare DNA variant detection. BDA has been validated even on sample types including clinical cell-free DNA samples collected from the blood plasma of lung cancer patients.

Tools made from Silver Mound's quartzite have been found as far away as Kentucky. The oldest have been dated to around 11,000 years ago, so they provide clues about the first people in Wisconsin. Silver Mound Archeological District was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006. Geography and geology Silver Mound Silver Mound is in the town of Hixton, Jackson County, Wisconsin. Its sandstone was laid down long ago in the Cambrian Period, like many other bluffs in the area. But in this sandstone a layer of very hard stone called silicated quartzite or orthoquartzite formed. Stone like this is fairly uncommon. With simple tools it can be broken into pieces and shaped into points through a process called knapping. And this quartzite from Silver Mound can be distinguished by technical analyses from similar orthoquartzite from other locations. Human use A fluted point made from Hixton quartzite The earliest known humans at Silver Mound were Paleo- Indians, who entered the area about 9550 BC. This is not long after the last glacier began retreating a short distance to the north, when the climate remained cool and mammoths and mastodons still roamed the area. To hunt them, the Paleo-Indians needed good projectile points. They also needed knives and scrapers for processing their kill. These tools could be made from the quartzite from Silver Mound, which was the largest source of orthoquartzite in the Midwest. Tools made from Hixton orthoquartzite and datable to this period have been found as far away as Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. Later Indians continued to quarry the quartzite at Silver Mound. By 8,000 BC the mammoths and mastodons were extinct, but Archaic Indians needed points to hunt large, now-extinct bison, elk and deer, and some quarried orthoquartzite at Silver Mound. Later Woodland and Oneota peoples also used stone from Silver Mound. In total there are about one thousand quarry pits on the mound. From the fragments left, some areas have been identified as workshops where the larger pieces of quartzite were broken up into smaller pieces suitable for working. In other workshops the smaller pieces were finished. Six rock shelters have also been found on the bluff. Two contain rock art. Euro-Americans have been aware of the Indian quarries on the mound since the 1840s. It was named Silver Mound because they mistakenly believed it contained silver. Some mining was done, but no silver was found. The land around the base of the mound has been farmed for years, but much of the mound itself remains largely undisturbed. Professional archeologists first visited the mound in 1928. Gradually the remarkable age of some of the Indian quarries emerged. In 1975 Silver Mound was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2006 it was named a National Historic Landmark, largely because of the potential information it may still hold about the earliest people in Wisconsin.

She was the daughter and only child of Antonia Hybrida Minor and triumvir Mark Antony. Her parents were paternal first cousins. Her maternal grandparents were an unnamed Roman woman and politician Gaius Antonius Hybrida, while paternal grandparents were Julia (third cousin of dictator Julius Caesar) and praetor Marcus Antonius Creticus). Biography Antonia was the eldest known recorded child of Antony's. Some modern historians consider her to be the first child born to Antony. She was born and raised in Rome. By 47 BC, Antonia’s parents had divorced because her mother had slept with her father’s friend, the tribune Publius Cornelius Dolabella. Antonia’s father had arranged for her to be betrothed in 44 BC, to Marcus Aemilius Lepidus the Younger, the son of triumvir Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. However, for an unknown reason the betrothal was later broken off. In later years, she appeared to have travelled with her father. In 36 BC, Antonia married Pythodoros of Tralles, who was an Anatolian Greek, who originated from Tralles (modern Aydın, Turkey). He was extremely wealthy and was a friend to the late triumvir Pompey. Pythodoros was about 20 years older than Antonia. The reason why Antony married his daughter off to Pythodoros was to hopefully gain some of Pythodoros’ wealth for his war chest in his campaign to invade Parthia. This was a testament to Antony’s Eastern perspective, as at that time Antony was married to Ptolemaic Greek Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt and was living with her at her palace in Alexandria, Egypt. Antonia’s marriage to Pythodoros and her father’s motive for the marriage to occur horrified the Roman Senate, particularly Octavian. This was one of the reasons that Octavian in 31 BC, declared war on her father and stepmother. In the following year, her father and stepmother committed suicide when Octavian defeated them and conquered Egypt. Antonia and Pythodoros settled in Smyrna (modern Izmir, Turkey). Either in 30 BC or 29 BC, Antonia bore Pythodoros, a daughter and only child Pythodorida, who through her marriages became Queen of Pontus and Cappadocia. Pythodorida was born and raised in Smyrna. After that moment, nothing more is known about Antonia.

In contrast to conventional cinema, where viewers passively watch a singular linear story unfold on a flat screen, T_Visionarium allows viewers to explore and edit a multitude of stories, in 3 dimensions, on a 360-degree fully surrounding screen. T_Visionarium takes two forms. The first version, T_Visionarium I (2003), is set within an inflatable dome, named EVE or the Extended Virtual Environment, 12 metres wide and 9 metres high. This immersive environment was invented by Shaw in 1993. Once inside EVE viewers wear a head mounted position tracking device and headphones and step onto a control platform in the middle of the dome. This interface device enables the viewer's head movements to control the movement of the projection system. By moving the direction of their head, and hence their gaze, viewers navigate around the images projected onto the interior of the dome. The second version, T_Visionarium II (2008), is set within AVIE, or the Advanced Visualisation and Interaction Environment. AVIE is the world's first 360 degree stereoscopic projection cinema 1. AVIE is a 120-square metre circular screen that surrounds the audience and provides the environment for a wholly immersive three-dimensional cinematic experience. AVIE allows audiences to wander at will through the projection space without having to sit in a fixed location as in a conventional cinema or to stand on a control platform as in T_Visionarium I, interacting with the projected information as if they are really there 2. Viewers wearing three-dimensional glasses step inside a cylindrical cinema screen measuring four metres high and 10 metres in diameter. Twelve digital projectors create a high-resolution stereoscopic 3D image on this screen, and the audio is spatially enhanced via a 24- channel surround sound system. iCinema The Director of the Centre is Dennis Del Favero. It was founded in 2002 by Jeffrey Shaw, Dennis Del Favero and Neil Brown and is a unique multi-disciplinary joint venture of the College for Fine Arts, the Faculty of Engineering and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at The University of New South Wales. The iCinema Centre comprises over 20 research staff and 16 research students working together across the disciplines of new media, aesthetics, experimental art, film theory, multimedia design, computer science, artificial intelligence and software and hardware engineering. The iCinema research program focuses on research into digital interactivity for benchmark applications across the arts, culture and industry. This includes research into: * Interactive Narrative Systems, involving the theoretical and experimental investigation of the differentiated structures of narrative brought about by the digital; * Immersive Visualisation Systems, involving the research and development of mixed reality environments; * Distributed Interface Systems, involving the integration of distributed multi-user environment within networked systems; and * Theories of Interactive Narrative Systems, involving the inquiry into digital systems in the context of the contemporary world. Funding The T_Visionarium project was funded by an Australian Research Council Discovery Grant, and co-produced with the ZKM Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe, Germany . Exhibitions T_Visionarium I was premiered at EuroLille, Lille, France, as part of the 2004 European Cultural Capital Lille Festival. Since then the work has been exhibited at Casa Dell'Architettura, Rome, Italy, as part of the 2006 La Rivoluzione Algorithmica exhibition. T_Visionarium II was premiered at the iCinema Scientia Facility at The University of New South Wales in January 2008 as part of the Sydney Festival. In November 2009, T_Visionarium was exhibited in Amsterdam, at the Zuiderkerk. T_Visionarium I and T_Visionarium II For the T_Visionarium I project researchers at iCinema captured 24 hours of European television, for T_Visionarium II 28 hours of digital free to air Australian television, both over a period of one week. This footage was segmented and converted into a massive database, in the latter case containing over 20,000 video clips. Each video clip was then tagged with descriptors known as metadata, which define the properties of the clip. Information can be encoded such as the gender of the actors, the dominant emotions they are expressing, the pace of the scene, and specific actions such as standing up, lying down, or telephoning. Having the video data segmented in this way deconstructs the television's original linear narrative into components that then become building blocks that the viewer can associate and re-assemble in an infinite number of ways 3. In T_Visionarium I, the viewer is able to search this database of television recordings via a touch screen menu using a keyword search. The software then reassembles these clips over the entire projection surface of EVE, generating relationships between clips based on the viewer's keyword search. In T_Visionarium II over three hundred video clips are simultaneously displayed and distributed around AVIE's circular screen. Using a specially designed interface, the viewer can trigger and reassemble clips from the database by selecting a particular video clip from those displayed. The archive of video clips then reassembles themselves within the 3D immersive space of AVIE based on their relationship to this selection. Those clips with the strongest relationship to the selection are triggered from the archive and cluster around the particular clip, whilst those with weaker relationships shift away from the clip 4. Rather than the keyword search of T_Visionarium I, T_Visionarium II allows for associative and affective searches. This latter search is based on the visual or emotional characteristics of the clip selected, rather than based on semantic information. The decontextualisation of the television clips fractures the medium's imaging of the world. Rather than the definite representation of the world proposed by television's linear narrative logic, in T_Visionarium, the viewer is confronted with a world represented as a complex of data, of emergent narrative events, rather than mediated as a prefabricated linear narrative 5. Aesthetics The T_Visionarium project is framed by the concept of aesthetic transcription, that is, the way new meaning can be produced is based on how content moves from one expressive medium to another 6. This is seen throughout art history where an artist recreates motifs from another artist's work (for an instance of this one can cite the apparent evolution from the goddess figure, say Venus, in archaic Greek sculpture to its conception in the classical period through to its appearance in renaissance oil painting). The concept of aesthetic transcription treats each adoption of techniques or cultural data as differentiated in itself, as something new, rather than as an imitation of what went before 7. In T_Visionarium, the digital allows the transcription of televisual data, decontextualising the original data, and reconstituting it within a new artifact. In other words, the archiving abilities of the digital allow data to be changed from its original conception as firstly, new narrative relationships generated between the multitudes of archived data and secondly, as meaningful narrative events that emerge as a result of viewer interaction. Following Roland Barthes' famous essay \\"The Death of the Author\\", this work, rather than being the product of a single author, allows aesthetic negotiations to occur between audience and text. It enables an emergent bond between artist, audience, and the work. In this way, T_Visionarium provides not just a recognition of the artist and the audience's part in the formation of art, but also the constitutive role of the particular media 8. In T_Visionarium, the artist sets the initial conditions for interaction and the viewer and the technology are responsible for the formation of the art event. The T_Visionarium project also proposes a re-evaluation of narrative in the digital. Del Favero, Brown, Shaw and Weibel have explained that traditionally narrative is conceptualized as mono-temporal and linear whereas interactive narrative is commonly understood as non-linear. In contrast to this, in T_Visionarium narrative is to be understood as \\"multi-temporal\\", a concept that alleviates the sharp distinction between linear and non-linear narratives 9. They explain this concept as the mingling of virtual time and real time. This occurs in T_Visionarium as the viewer searches the televisual database in virtual time and experiences the consequences of this navigation in real time. Tim Barker builds on this description to situate the \\"multi-temporal\\" in T_Visionarium as the consequence of the viewer's ability to access multiple temporal episodes simultaneously. As each television clip represents different time periods, the result of accessing these all at once is what he refers to as a \\"multi-temporal duration\\", a duration of time that is made up of multiple and differentiated representations of time 10. In this model of interaction, the viewer and the database form \\"…a digital ecology able to generate unprecedented aesthetic and social meanings\\" 11. In other words, the viewer and the database of T_Visionarium collaborate to generate the narrative events that constitute T_Visionarium. Applications The unique way that T_Visionarium uses AVIE to navigate and articulate vast amounts of audiovisual data is significant for the cultural, entertainment, education and industrial sectors 12. Particular examples of this are the licensing of AVIE systems to Mines Rescue Pty Ltd as a mines safety training device 13.

Minimidget was written and illustrated by John F. Kolb (1913–2004). After Centaur's collapse in 1942, Minimidget is now in the public domain.  History  Minimidget was the first shrunken superhero, beating Doll Man by a matter of months. He first appeared in Amazing-Man #5 (the first issue, the other four were never published), and in his first story, he and a girl called Ritty are shrunken down to about six inches tall by a scientist named Dr. Anton Barmell. Barmell brings Minimidget to his family home and then has him climb up a drainpipe into the bedroom of his elder brother, whom Minimidget kills with a poisoned needle. After two more such killings – both victims were also Barmell's relatives – the FBI men manage to uncover the truth, after which Minimidget is fatally wounded in a mousetrap. Upon being cornered in his lab, Barmell blows it and himself to kingdom come. Although Minimidget was supposed to have been killed, in the next issue (#6), he's revived by a paramedic. Free from the spell of Dr. Barmell, he and Ritty fall in love and go on to have many adventures together, in Amazing-Man and then in Stars & Stripes comics. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"they have no superpowers, but are smart and adventurous and make use of tiny sports cars and miniature airplanes. They fight men like the Power, a would-be world conqueror with his own island fortress. They are sent into the year 3000 by a scientist, just to see if his \\"time destroying machine\\" works.\\" He last appeared in Amazing-Man #25 (Dec 1941), just before Centaur went out of business. Minimidget and Ritty's real names were never revealed in the original comics, but in the AC Comics version, he's revealed to be Jack Rhodes, a character who appeared once in Amazing-Man #5. Inspiration Kolb's primary influence was Flash Gordon; he even named his son after one of the characters in the Flash Gordon series. Ritty was based on his wife, who died suddenly when his son was a boy. He didn't pick up a pen to draw for more than 30 years after she died, and much of his work was lost during that long depression.

La Follette House is a historic house located at 733 Lakewood Boulevard in Maple Bluff, Wisconsin, United States. The house was the home of Robert M. La Follette, Wisconsin governor and U.S. Congressman and presidential candidate, from 1905 until his death in 1925. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1964.Blanche Higgins Schroer (August 6, 1976) , National Park Service and History By the time La Follette purchased the house in 1905, he was already an accomplished Wisconsin politician. La Follette first gained a national political office in 1885, when he entered the U.S. House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party; he remained a representative until 1890, when he lost a reelection bid due in part to ideological differences with party leadership. After leaving office, La Follette began a Progressive campaign against several of Wisconsin's large and politically influential corporations; his ideas won him enough popular support to secure him Wisconsin's governorship in 1900. While his Progressive plans were initially rejected by an unsympathetic state legislature, several of his policies became law by the middle of the decade, particularly tax reform policies such as a statewide income tax. In 1905, the same year that he purchased his house in Maple Bluff, La Follette was elected to the U.S. Senate. La Follette remained a senator until his death; he became known for progressive stances such as the introduction of national regulatory commissions, support for organized labor, and opposition to World War I. La Follette also considered presidential office during his term as a senator; he was proposed as a Republican candidate in 1908, and he mounted an independent campaign in the 1924 election which carried Wisconsin and earned him one-sixth of the national vote. La Follette died in 1925 of chronic illness; his wife Belle Case and sons Philip and Robert Jr. remained influential in Wisconsin politics. The house in 2014 La Follette's life and political career was significantly associated with his homes in and near Madison, the state capital; before moving to his Maple Bluff house, he lived in a house on Broom Street in Madison. His house in Maple Bluff was originally situated on a plot, which had shrunk to by the time of its National Historic Landmark nomination. The two-story brick house is composed of two sections and features Victorian elements and a projecting bay with a mansard roof. After La Follette's death, the property remained in his family for several generations.

These may have been made by the euthycarcinoid, Mosineia macnaughtoni, which is also found at Blackberry Hill. Diplichnites are arthropod trackways with two parallel rows of blunt to elongate, closely spaced tracks oriented approximately perpendicularly to the mid-line of the trackway.Minter et al., 1986 The term is more often used for the ichnofossils of this description; however, similar trackways from recent arthropods are sometimes given this name as well.Davis et al., 2007  The Diplichnites makers  This type of trackway was originally based on large fossils from Pennsylvanian strata of Nova Scotia, when Sir J. W. Dawson named it in 1873.Dawson, 1873 Dawson proposed that Diplichnites were produced by a fish “walking” in shallow water on pectoral or ventral fin spines. Previous to this he had suggested that a large crustacean, annelid worm or myriapod (such as a millipede) could have made them.Dawson, 1862 Subsequent evidence has supported this earlier interpretation. The fossils on which this ichnotaxon was based are now thought to be from giant myriapods,Briggs et al., 1979 such as Arthropleura. In the decades following Dawson’s work, the trackways of several other arthropods were also included within Diplichnites – particularly, trilobites, which are known from marine Paleozoic deposits around the world. In addition, recent evidence indicates that some Diplichnites trackways from certain Cambrian intertidal and subaerial deposits of North America, especially the Potsdam and Elk Mound Groups, were produced by euthycarcinoids.Collette & Hagadorn, 2010Collette, Gass & Hagadorn, 2012 In that scenario, the Diplichnites may have been undertracks that penetrated to the underlying layer of sediment, and the fossil trackways thus produced on the top surface (preserving the impression of the dragging tail) were Protichnites.Goldring & Seilacher, 1971Hoxie, 2005 ReferencesFurther reading    * * External links Diplichnites: *Photo-- Diplichnites gouldi arthropod trackway--(marine, tidal); Article - \\"Bulletin 241\\", Kansas Geological Survey *Photo--from Arthropleura sp; Article - \\"Nova Scotia, Carboniferous Geology and Paleontology\\" *Video--Euthycarcinoid animation on Diplichnites slab (Milwaukee Public Museum) Trilobite Tracks: *Trilobite Trace Fossils - 3-main types of trilobite trace fossils Category:Arthropod trace fossils Category:Fossil trackways ","title":"Diplichnites"},{"id":"15037553","text":"Geneva High School is a public secondary school located in Geneva, Alabama.

It contains one of the nation's highest concentrations of immigrant Belgian and Belgian-American culture, land use, and architecture. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1990. Description and history In the 1850s, in response to a drive by the state of Wisconsin to increase settlement of its rural areas, immigrants from the area that is now Belgium began to arrive in the state. Originating in the provinces of Namur and Brabant, they settled on the eastern shore areas of Brown, Kewaunee, and Door counties. They used indigenous materials in combination with traditional building practices imported from their homeland to construct an architecturally distinct landscape. Houses were typically built out of either red brick or limestone, with frame outbuildings. In the 1860 and 1870 censuses Wisconsin had a higher percentage of Belgian-origin residents than any other state. The area around the village of Namur was judged in a wide-ranging survey of Belgian-settled areas to best represent this influx. The historic district is basically rectangular in shape, with the village of Namur just north of its southern boundary. To the west and north, it is bordered by Green Bay and County Road \\"K\\", and to the east it is bordered by the properties on Thruway Road. Covering about , the district includes over 180 historically significant buildings, most of them farm-related buildings. There are 41 separate farmsteads, each averaging more than five buildings. Properties were typically developed between 1880 and 1930. Non-residential properties include the St. Mary's Catholic Church and parsonage house in Namur, and the Harold Euclide General Store, built in 1916.

It is part of the Nabatieh Governorate. Jbaa is situated on the great Safi Mountain, and rises over (in the town center) from the sea level and then begins to rise to in the district of \\"Ein-Elsataoun\\". The village covers over . Surrounding the village is gorgeous greenery including diverse trees, especially walnut trees that spread around most of the town houses.  Etymology  This town’s name means “the mountain, the hill or highland” in the Aramaic language. The addition to its name of Al-Halaweh (the Arabic word for “the beautiful”) relates to its natural beauty.  History  Jbaa is the capital of Iqlim al-Tuffah, and was the Directorate of Independence during the French mandate over Lebanon. In the 20th century, it became known as a resort for the peoples of Nabatieh and Sidon and the rest of the Jabal Amel area. Jbaa has a number of restaurants and hotels because of its many natural springs: Ein-elteen, Marjah, Kabiy, Ein-Arkez, Hoelh-spring, spring-Abboud, Spring-Valley and Albsis. Evidence shows that Jbaa has been continually inhabited since the times of the Phoenicians. During the Islamic period, the village was a center for the growth of Shia Islam. Scholars would come from all over to study religious doctrine in Jbaa. An important inhabitant at this time was Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al-Amili, who was one of the greatest scholars in Shi'ism. During the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war, Jbaa became a safe haven for Christian refugees fleeing Druze aggression in Mount Lebanon. The notables of the village had offered protection to the fleeing Christians and granted asylum to those running from persecution. In the year 1889 scientific, cultural, and social development enveloped Jbaa. The government established the Turkish primary school for males and another for females in the remnants of Almenakrh Castle, located in the center of Jbaa. In 1922 after the First World War, the golden age of education in the town begun with the establishment of a branch of the secondary school established by Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah. Difficult times in the Nabatieh caused many students from surrounding area to come to Jbaa because of its safety, so the number of students reached 870 students. Then it became a secondary school in the year 1981/1982. Jbaa was also famous for its festivals (mahrajanat), which were held in the summer and people gathered from all over Lebanon. There would be ongoing weddings and parties in Jbaa during the lasting peace in the 1960s and 1970s. Jbaa became a home and a haven for the people of Nabatieh caza at the beginning of the first Israeli war during the 1977/1982 period. The following Israeli war spread to the village and 80% of inhabitants moved to Sidon and Beirut in the year 1985. After its liberation from the Israeli occupation in 1985, there was a renovation to most of the village which saw the revival of cafes and restaurants to have a prosperous summer season and revive the old days and times.  Sites  Jbaa has a Roman cemetery south west of the town, used by Christians in the past. There are also still remains of an old Christian monastery in the central part of the town. There was also a mosque build by the Second Martyr, Zayn al-Din al-Juba'i al-Amili, which was later destroyed leaving nothing but a painting of the old history of restoration. A new mosque was built on the ashes of the old one in the modern town center. Other sites include a fortress built by the rulers in the town, Almenakrh (currently the Jawad family), which was subsequently used as a Srai by the Turkish government, then as a school in the late nineteenth century (1889) . After that a modern primary school was built on the ashes in the year 1958, the remainder were used as the basis wall to the modern secondary School. Archaeology A Neolithic archaeological site was discovered in Jbaa on the road to Nabatieh at around above sea level. The site is credited as having been discovered by Von Heidenstam although the material in the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut is marked with name of \\"Hajji Khallaf\\" who may well have sold the pieces to Von Heidenstam. The majority of the flint tools found were Heavy Neolithic of the Qaraoun culture along with an example each of a later polished tipped axe, pick and adze that are thought to be entirely neolithic. Two other series from the site include two Lower Paleolithic bifaces and several Middle Paleolithic flints.  Population  The population includes 10,000 inhabitants, most of whom are Shia Muslims. Families include: Zein, Abou Haidar, Al-Horr, Atwi, Aquil, Awada, Barakat, Dhayne, Fawaz, Fayad, Ghamloush, Hammoud, Harb, Hneieno, Horchi, Hussein, Issa, Jameel, Jawed, Jezzini, Karaki, Khachfeh, Khafaja, Mahmoudy, al- Moussawi, Mohammad, Muhieddine, Mouallem, Nasser, Nehme, Noureddine, Raad, Ramadan, Saleh, Safawi, Takkieddine, Wehbe, Yassine, and more.

Lapham and Fisk Day on the site of a quarry owned by the Schoonmaker family. Geologist James Hall declared its significance in 1862.SCHOONMAKER QUARRY It was the first ancient reef described in North America, and among the first described in the world. and It is located North of W. State St., between N. 66th St. and N. 64th St. extended, in Wauwatosa. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1997. Geology A closeup of fossilized reef material The Schoonmaker Reef formed approximately 425 million years ago during the Silurian period. It is largely dolomite, a sedimentary rock of calcium magnesium carbonate (CaMg(CO3)2) that is similar to limestone. The reef is stratigraphically consistent with the Racine Dolomite, a formation in Wisconsin and Illinois. The exposed portion of the reef is in the Menomonee River valley in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. It exists as a massive, rock hill that stretches in a outcrop. It is exposed on the lower of a bluff; the upper portion of the bluff is formed by glacial sediments left in the last million years. The reef contains a variety of fossils from Silurian period organisms, including trilobites. History The first known human interaction with the reef was in 1838, when Joseph Higgins identified it as a source of lime. Lime burning at the reef may have first occurred five years earlier. Silas Brown constructed lime kilns in the 1840s which remained in use until 1857. Increase A. Lapham first identified the reef as an area of geological interest in 1844. John Schoonmaker and Isaac W. Van Schaick purchased the land in 1857. Schoonmaker operated the quarry until 1909 and is its namesake. In 1862, James Hall identified Schoonmaker Reef as the first ancient reef on mainland North America. Hall was made aware of the reef by Lapham, who sent him fossils that he had collected there. He frequently visited Lapham in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area in the 1850s to examine Lapham's fossil collection. Hall made Schonmaker a focus of his studies of ancient reefs and it became the scientific model for reef development in the nineteenth century. Thomas Chrowder Chamberlin, the Wisconsin State Geologist, published a study of the reef in 1877 comparing it to modern reefs. He identified Schoonmaker as an important model of reef study because of its abundance of fossils. Amateur geologists like Thomas A. Greene and Fisk Holbrook Day collected fossils from the site. Day's collection, which featured samples from about two hundred species, was responsible for approximately 90% of reef species identification. Alexander Emanuel Agassiz purchased most of Day's collection (over ) for the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University in 1881. Day sold over five thousand fossils to Greene for this museum and another 10,000 of his collection were sold to the University of Michigan after his death. William C. Alden photographed the reef in 1899; the picture was widely distributed in geology textbooks. In 1904, Amadeus William Grabau published a paper on the reef in the Geological Society of America Bulletin in 1903. The G. D. Francey Coal, Stone & Supply Company bought the land from Schoonmaker in 1909 to produce aggregate. Robert Rakes Shrock published a paper on Wisconsin reefs, featuring the Schoonmaker Reef, in the Geological Society of America Bulletin in 1939. He was the first to completely diagram a cross-section of the reef. In 1948, the Bliffert Concrete Company bought the quarry and concrete plant and leased it to the Fuller Company. It was abandoned two years later. In recent years, an apartment complex named The Reef was constructed in front of the reef site.The Reef Apt See also *Soldiers' Home Reef *List of National Historic Landmarks in Wisconsin *National Register of Historic Places listings in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin ReferencesExternal links *Wangard Partners, Inc.

The storm is also tied with 2006’s Hurricane Ioke as the fifth-strongest Pacific hurricane on record. It was the first named storm of the 1973 Pacific hurricane season. Forming in early June, Hurricane Ava eventually reached Category 5 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the first Pacific hurricane to do so in June and the earliest ever in a season. Its central pressure made it the most intense known Pacific hurricane at the time. Despite its intensity, Ava stayed at sea without significant impact. Ava was given the most advanced measurement and reconnaissance available at the time. Recon flights were conducted and meteorological equipment was tested. The hurricane was also photographed from space by satellites and Skylab astronauts. Meteorological history On June 2, 1973, a tropical depression formed about south of Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. It started out nearly stationary, and became a tropical storm late on the same day it formed, the first named storm of the 1973 Pacific hurricane season. Ava then slowly moved westwards away from Mexico and became a hurricane on June 3. Ava became a major hurricane on the afternoon of June 5. On the next day, a United States Air Force recon flight measured a wind speed of and a central pressure of . These measurements made Hurricane Ava by far the most intense storm of the season. At its peak, Ava had winds of . These winds made it a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, the highest possible category and the first Category 5 since the 1959 season. Ava was also a hurricane with windspeeds rapidly increasing the closer to the eye they were measured. Over a distance of , wind speeds increased from , and they increased from over half that distance. The reading of was roughly lower than the ambient environment far from the storm. After its peak, Ava started weakening on June 7 as it continued its westward path. Its winds were on June 7 and on the next day. It was no longer a major hurricane after its winds fell to on June 9. Later that day it weakened to a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Ava became Tropical Depression Ava on June 11. The system then turned north and dissipated on June 12. Its remnants then became embedded in the trade winds as a tropical wave. Forecasting and observation Radar during a recon flight In terms of how well it was forecast, Ava had the largest error of any cyclone during the season. This 14° error five days out was mainly due to its northward turn when it was a weakening depression. For a few days, Ava was directly underneath Skylab during its first manned mission. Astronauts acquired photographs of the hurricane, which was big enough for Science Pilot Joseph Kerwin to describe it as \\"an enormous spiral\\" that was big enough to dominate the view outside the space station's window and prevent anything else from being seen. Astronauts also provided microwave data through Earth Resources Experiment Package sensors. Skylab also used a scatterometer on the system. Unfortunately, Skylab's scatterometer data was harder to use than normal as it was degraded. Ava was also underneath the NOAA-2 and Nimbus 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided photographs that were used to estimate Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's existence, as did the wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm. Nimbus 5 carried an Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer. Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall. Recon aircraft also penetrated Hurricane Ava. It was the first Pacific hurricane penetrated by National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration aircraft, but not by aircraft from other agencies. NOAA craft were laden with sensors and measured wave heights reaching with a microwave radar system and a laser altimeter. That was the first time ever that sea conditions in a tropical cyclone had been measured that way. United States Air Force planes measured central pressure, air temperature, and humidity in the eye pressures using dropsondes. The collection of data from both space and the air was done in order to allow comparisons. Collectively, all of this measuring made Hurricane Ava the best-measured northeastern Pacific tropical cyclone at the time. Impact and records Hurricane Ava stayed at sea. Consequently, no one was killed and there was no reported damage. However, when it was a recently named tropical storm, Ava did cause sustained winds below gale-force to three ships called the Joseph Lykes, Hoegh Trotter, and Volnay. In addition, large ocean waves churned up by Ava created hazardous surf and strong riptides at Southern California beaches on June 9 and June 10. Those waves reached heights of up to at Newport Beach, at Long Beach, and at Seal Beach. Those waves made beaches more hazardous, resulting in double-to-triple the usual contingent of lifeguards throughout Southern California beaches. At Seal Beach and Newport Beach, lifeguards made 35 and 75 rescues, respectively. When it was active, Hurricane Ava set many records. Several have since been broken, but Ava still holds a few. Ava ceased being a Category 5 hurricane on June 7, 1973. 1994's Emilia reached Category 5 intensity on July 19, 1994. This span of 7,712 days, which Ava began and Emilia ended, is the longest time between successive Category 5 hurricanes in the northeastern Pacific, and anywhere worldwide, in recorded history. When Hurricane Gilma reached Category 5 strength on July 24 also in 1994, it marked the shortest gap between Category 5 Pacific hurricanes recorded. Ava was also a Category 5 hurricane for exactly 24 hours; a record at the time. Hurricane John broke that in the 1994 season, and hurricanes Linda and Ioke also lasted longer, tied with John. In addition, Ava is the strongest June tropical cyclone in the western hemisphere north of the equator. A spokesperson from the U.S. National Weather Service was quoted as saying that, \\"Ava had sustained winds of about 180 knots with some gusts at 200 knots when she was peaking\\". However, the official \\"Best track\\" data file and the seasonal summary in the Monthly Weather Review contradict that report and give maximum winds of 140 knots. If Ava's winds were that high, they would one of the highest ever reported in a tropical cyclone anywhere. Like any report of winds that high it is suspect. At the time, Hurricane Ava's minimum known pressure of was the lowest-known in its basin, making Ava the most intense Pacific hurricane. Ava is now the fifth-most intense, tied with Hurricane Ioke, as hurricanes Patricia, Linda, Rick and Kenna recorded lower pressures. However, Linda's and Rick's pressures were only estimated from satellite imagery, so Ava held the record for lowest measured pressure until Kenna surpassed it in 2002. However, the meteorological record for the eastern north Pacific are unreliable because geostationary satellite observation did not begin until 1966. Ava's pressure record is itself incomplete; Ava was only a Category 4 when its pressure was measured, and the only reading when it was a Category 5 is . These two factors mean that Ava's lowest pressure may be below , and that there may be other cyclones stronger than Ava.

Inigo developed from a tropical low that crossed eastern Indonesia in late March 2003. Becoming a named tropical cyclone on 1 April, Inigo rapidly intensified as it tracked southwestward, reaching a minimum central pressure of 900 hPa on 4 April. An approaching trough weakened the cyclone and turned it to the southeast, and on 8 April, Inigo dissipated after making landfall on Western Australia, as a minimal tropical storm. The precursor disturbance dropped heavy rainfall across eastern Indonesia, causing widespread flooding and mudslides. The worst of the damage was on Flores island, though damage was also reported on West Timor and Sumba. The flooding and mudslides damaged or destroyed thousands of houses, forcing many to leave their homes. A total of 58 casualties were reported in association with Inigo, as a disturbance. In Australia, Inigo produced locally heavy rainfall, but did little damage. Meteorological history On the 26th of March, an area of disturbed weather was located within the near-equatorial trough near Papua New Guinea. Initially located within an area of easterly wind shear, it tracked westward, due to the presence of a ridge to its south, and on 27 March, a low- pressure area formed over Western New Guinea. Thunderstorm activity increased around a mid-level circulation as it crossed into the Arafura Sea, and its overall organisation continued to increase. On 29 March, a low-level circulation was visible, though significant tropical development was prevented due to wind shear and land interaction with islands in the Indonesian archipelago. The system developed into a tropical low on 30 March. After turning to the southwest, the tropical low crossed the island of Flores on 31 March; upon doing so, the storm's convection greatly increased, due to increased upper-level divergence, which produced heavy rainfall on Flores and Timor. On 1 April, wind shear decreased as the system crossed into the Savu Sea, and the storm developed into a tropical cyclone to the northeast of Sumba. At 1200 UTC on 1 April, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued its first advisory on the system, classifying it as Tropical Cyclone 26S. At 0000 UTC on 2 April, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) warning centre in Perth classified the system as Tropical Cyclone Inigo. The storm quickly intensified as it tracked southwestward, aided by low wind shear and strong divergence. An eye featured gradually organised, and early on 3 April, the BOM classified Inigo as a severe tropical cyclone, with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). Later that day, the cyclone underwent rapid intensification, as the eye became increasingly better defined. On 4 April, Inigo attained Category 5 status on the Australian cyclone scale, and at 0600 UTC, Inigo reached peak winds of 240 km/h (150 mph) and an estimated minimum pressure of 900 hPa (mbar), while located about 950 km (590 mi) north of Onslow, Western Australia. Around the same time, the JTWC assessed Inigo as a powerful cyclone with 1-min winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). With a minimum pressure of 900 hPa, Inigo tied Cyclone Gwenda of the 1998–99 season as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian cyclone region. Upon reaching peak intensity, Inigo maintained an eyewall 32 km (20 mi) in diameter. Late on 4 April, an approaching upper- level trough increased wind shear over the system, which caused a steady weakening trend. On 5 April, the eye became cloud-filled, and later that day the cyclone reached its westernmost point before the approaching trough turned it to the southeast. By 7 April, its winds decreased to below severe tropical cyclone status, or below 120 km/h (75 mph). The convection continued to decrease, leaving the centre exposed from the convection as it made landfall early on 8 April, in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Upon moving ashore, Inigo had winds of around 75 km/h (45 mph). Inigo's circulation dissipated within 12 hours after moving ashore. Impact Inigo approaching western Australia on 7 April The precursor tropical disturbance dropped heavy rainfall in eastern Indonesia; on the island of Flores, Larantuka recorded 223 mm (8.78 in) in a 24‑hour period. The rainfall caused flash flooding and mudslides, primarily in Flores but also on West Timor and Sumba. In some locations, the depth of the floodwaters reached 5 meters (16 ft). The Oessao River in West Timor exceeded its banks, which flooded seven villages. In Kupang in West Timor, the system destroyed hundreds of homes and large fields of corn, bean, and rice crop. Heavy damage was reported near Ende, where flooding and mudslides destroyed 20 houses and destroyed the roads connecting to East Flores. In Ende, a total of 294 animals were killed. The city's airport was flooded with one meter (3 ft) of water, preventing aerial transportation and leaving the city temporarily isolated. In East Flores Regency in eastern Flores Island, the system left 75 destroyed houses, along with 77 severely damaged and a further 56 receiving light damage. Damage in Indonesia totalled less than $6 million (2003 USD, $6.8 million 2007 USD), and 102 injuries were reported. The Indonesian representative to the Tropical Cyclone Committee of the World Meteorological Organization in 2004 reported the death toll related to the disaster in Indonesia as 58 fatalities. Additionally, the precursor disturbance produced rough seas along the coastlines, which resulting in the sinking of 12 sailing vessels. Two ships, each with a crew of five to eight people, were reported missing to the southwest of Sumba, after Cyclone Inigo passed over their location on 3 April. Inigo moved ashore on Australia as a weak tropical cyclone, though several locations reported winds near gale force. The storm dropped light to moderate precipitation near its landfall location, with a maximum rainfall total of 226 mm (8.90 inches), of which 128 mm (5.04 in) of rain fell in 80 minutes. No casualties or significant damage was reported in the country. Aftermath Shortly after the storm passed through Indonesia, local government and Red Cross officials distributed assistance to the storm victims, including food, medicine, clean water, and mattresses; additionally, the government sent about $400 million (2003 IDR, $50,000 2003 USD). The affected citizens resided in temporary shelters, including schools, police offices, and shelters built by local governments. Officials deployed machines to remove debris from the roads affected by the landslides. As a result of its damage, the name Inigo was retired subsequent to its usage; its name was replaced with Iggy, which was first used in 2012.

Background Cameron was born in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. His father, Doctor Henry George Cameron, died when he was three, and he was raised by his mother, Enid Constance, a medical secretary, in Calgary, Alberta. He graduated from Crescent Heights High School in Calgary in 1956, with an Alberta Hotelmen's Scholarship to the University of Alberta, also winning a Robinson Memorial Scholarship in Creative Writing to attend the Banff School of Fine Arts Summer School. He switched from the University of Alberta after two years to Queen's University in Kingston, completing his degree, in mathematics with a minor in French Literature, in 1964. He returned to university full-time in 1966-67, taking a qualifying year at Sir George Williams University in history and making the Dean's Honour List. He was admitted to graduate studies in history at McGill, taking his M.A. in history in 1969, and winning a McConnell Fellowship to continue Ph.D. studies in history. He carried out three years of Ph.D. research, including two years in England, a study of the British scientific elite in the first half of the 20th century, but never submitted his thesis, although publishing articles based on the research. In 1973 he took a permanent position as a history teacher at John Abbott College in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, which continued for over thirty years, also serving at as vice-president of the faculty association, member of the academic council, and executive member of the board of governors. He also taught university courses, part-time, in European history for Concordia University, in the history of science at Concordia Liberal Arts College and for McGill History Department. From 1980, he began doing consulting work for Brendan Wood International, a financial research firm. In 1982 he became a freelance op-ed columnist and book reviewer, first for Montreal community newspapers, then for the Montreal Daily News, the Ottawa Citizen and the Montreal Gazette. He also published a number of articles in the U. S. as well as Canada, and scholarly studies in three historical essay collections, Rutherford and Physics at the Turn of the Century (1979), Otto Hahn and the Birth of Nuclear Physics (1980) and Leadership and Responsibility (2005). Cameron was married from 1970 to 1989 to Ruth Woodward. He has a stepson and stepdaughter. He died on December 19, 2019. Provincial politics In the 1989 provincial election, he ran as an Equality Party candidate in the Montreal riding of Jacques-Cartier and defeated Quebec Liberal Party incumbent Joan Dougherty. In the legislature, he served on the Education Committee, the Committee on the Future of Hydro- Electric Power, as an alternate voting member of the Belanger-Campeau Commission, and as a voting member of the Expert Committee on the Political Implications of Sovereignty. He prepared a minority report on the latter, Imagining Sovereignty/Souverainté d'Esprit, which was circulated to the major Canadian universities. In 1993, he introduced Bill 199, a private member's bill which would have made English and French fully co-official languages in the province.Bill 199: The Charter of the English and French Languages He continued to teach one course per year at John Abbott College throughout his term as an MNA.

It is located on the University of Pittsburgh's upper campus on Allequippa St. Charter Falk Laboratory School was established in 1930 under a charter agreement between the University of Pittsburgh and benefactors Leon Falk Jr. and his sister, Marjorie Falk Levy. The school was named in honor of Leon and Marjorie's mother, Fanny Edel Falk. It features progressive, experiential, and inquiry-based instruction and develops and refines its own curriculum. Originally chartered as a progressive experimental school for demonstration purposes, Falk School's charter was amended in 1946 to include the mentoring and observation of practice teachers as one of the school's functions. It is the only known laboratory school in existence to have a legal charter that stipulates its purposes and functions. Over the years the faculty added to the school's original functions to incorporate educational research and to integrate new educational practices as they are developed. Teachers are in charge of, and responsible for, developing their own curricula and programs. History Progressive laboratory child education at the University of Pittsburgh was established when a laboratory school for children four to seven years old was opened by the School of Education on October 6, 1913. The original school grew into two schools, collectively known as the University Demonstration Schools, composed of the School of Childhood, for children up to second grade, and the Elementary School for grades three, four, and five. Following a reorganization within the School of Education, the University Demonstration Schools became independent and continued as a private project known as the Community School until the establishment of the Falk School in 1931, at which time it reabsorbed the Community School. The Falk School opened on September 14, 1931 with 78 enrolled children, a principal, seven full-time teachers, and a part-time teacher from the Department of Physical Education. The school at first was placed in temporary quarters in the Stephens house of the university until its own dedicated facility opened a few weeks later. Martin P. Chworowsky served as its original director. The Falk School facility had an original capacity for 155 children and included a nursery, kindergarten, and classrooms for first through sixth grades. It originally admitted children from two and one-half to twelve years of age. A health program was directed by the Women's Medical Adviser of the University of Pittsburgh. The three lower grades had sessions between 9am and noon, while the upper grades met from 9am to 3:15pm. By the end of Falk School's sixth year, it expanded to eight grades with full training for high school. Ongoing expansion and renovations allowed for a planned increase in enrollment from 275 students in 2008 to 429 in 2018. Tuition for Falk School was originally $200 a year for lower grades and $275 a year for upper grades. Current tuition for 2018-2019 is $15,370 per year, for all grade levels K-8.  Building  The Falk Laboratory School at the University of Pittsburgh was built in 1931. A Tudor-style gray stone school house with Old English slate shingle roof, the Falk School building was designed by Janssen and Cocken and built in 1931 at an original cost of $200,000. The cornerstone of Falk School was laid in August, 1931 and contains, among other papers, a speech read by Majorie Falk Levy in which she described the life and charter of her mother, and the school's namesake, Fanny Edel Falk. The building was designed to initially accommodate 155 students in its eight classrooms. Expansion of the Falk School, from the facility to a facility occurred in 2008 and renovations of the original building were completed in 2009. The $21.1 million expansion and renovations, designed by architectural firm Perkins Eastman, features several green building components and will allow for increased enrollment of up to 403 students by 2012. The new academic wing for the school includes 14 classrooms for Kindergarten through eighth grade, a new computer classroom (now has been transformed into the WonderLab, A Hub For Learning Through Making), art room, library, cafeteria, science room, and support areas. The outdoor play area was relocated to the west side of the building and a new play area was constructed on the gym roof. The front facade of the new addition is designed to match the stone finish of the old building with a circular drive to enhance student safety during drop-off and pick-up. The back of the building has a more modern look with red siding and two walls of windows that enclose the expanded cafeteria and library space. The back also has two outdoor terraces and a sidewalk for easy access to the renovated ground-level play spaces. Administration The Head of School (Director) of Falk Laboratory School is a member of the Executive Committee in the University of Pittsburgh's School of Education and the Chair of the Falk School Board is the School of Education's Dean. Falk School teachers are faculty in the University of Pittsburgh's School of Education and the Director holds the rank of Associate Professor at the University. Falk is a teacher-training site for education students at the University of Pittsburgh with as many as 30 Master of Arts in Teaching candidates apprenticing at Falk each year.

The paper introduces the pedagogical landscape surrounding the publication of SICP. The paper starts with a history and critique of SICP, followed by a description of the goal of the computing curriculum. It then describes the principles of teaching behind HtDP; in particular, the difference between implicit vs. explicit teaching of design principles. It then continues on to describe the role of Scheme and the importance of an ideal programming environment, and concludes with an extensive evaluation of content and student/faculty reaction to experience with SICP vs. HtDP. One of the major focuses of the paper is the emphasis on the difference in required domain knowledge between SICP and HtDP. A chart in the paper compares major exercises in SICP and HtDP, and the related text describes how the exercises in the former require considerably more sophisticated domain knowledge than those of HtDP. The paper continues on to explain why this difference in required domain knowledge has resulted in certain students having confused domain knowledge with program design knowledge. The paper claims the following four major efforts that the authors of HtDP have made to address perceived issues with SICP: 1) HtDP addresses explicitly, rather than implicitly, how programs should be constructed. 2) To make programming easier, the book guides students through five different knowledge levels corresponding to data definition levels of complexity. 3) The book's exercises focus on program design guidelines, rather than domain knowledge. 4) The book assumes less domain knowledge than that of SICP. The paper then distinguishes between structural recursion, where the related data definition happens to be self-referential, requiring usually a straightforward design process, and generative recursion, where new problem data is generated in the middle of the problem-solving process and the problem solving method is re-used, often requiring ad hoc mathematical insight, and stresses how this distinction makes their approach scalable to the object-oriented (OO) world. Finally, the paper concludes with a description of responses from various faculty and students after having used HtDP in the classroom.

It has the chemical structure Ile-Asn-Leu-Lys-Ala-Leu-Ala-Ala-Leu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Ile-Leu-NH2. The net effect of mastoparan's mode of action depends on cell type, but seemingly always involves exocytosis. In mast cells, this takes the form of histamine secretion, while in platelets and chromaffin cells release serotonin and catecholamines are found, respectively. Mastoparan activity in the anterior pituitary gland leads to prolactin release. In the case of histamine secretion, the effect of mastoparan takes place via its interference with G protein activity. By stimulating the GTPase activity of certain subunits, mastoparan shortens the lifespan of active G protein. At the same time, it promotes dissociation of any bound GDP from the protein, enhancing GTP binding. In effect, the GTP turnover of G proteins is greatly increased by mastoparan. These properties of the toxin follow from the fact that it structurally resembles activated G protein receptors when placed in a phospholipid environment. The resultant G protein-mediated signaling cascade leads to intracellular IP3 release and the resultant influx of Ca2+. Research has shown that Mastoparan inhibits all developmental forms of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that is responsible for Chagas disease. Vinhote, J. F. C., Lima, D. B., Mello, C. P., de Souza, B. M., Havt, A., Palma, M. S., ... & Martins, A. M. C. (2017). Trypanocidal activity of mastoparan from Polybia paulista wasp venom by interaction with TcGAPDH. Toxicon.  Structural transition  In an experimental study conducted by Tsutomu Higashijima and his counterparts, mastoparan was compared to melittin, which is found in bee venom. Mainly, the structure and reaction to phosphate was studied in each toxin. Using Circular Dichroism (CD), it was found that when mastoparan was exposed to methanol, an alpha helical form existed. It was concluded that strong intramolecular hydrogen bonding occurred. Also, two negative bands were present on the CD spectrum. In an aqueous environment, mastoparan took on a nonhelical, unordered form. In this case, only one negative band was observed on the CD spectrum. Adding phosphate buffer to mastoparan resulted in no effect. Melittin produced a different conformational change than mastoparan. In an aqueous solution, melittin went from a nonhelical form to an alpha helix when phosphate was added to the solution. The binding of melittin to the membrane was believed to result from electrostatic interactions, not hydrophobic interactions.  Attempts to remove mastoparan toxicity  Despite the toxic effects to mammalian cells, mastoparan is also a potential antibiotic template due to its potent antimicrobial activity. In design study performed by Irazazabal and co-workers (2016), it was demonstrated that the inclusion of an isoleucine and an arginine residue at positions 5 and 8 respectively [I5, R8], dramatically reduced the toxicity of mastoparan, turning it into a potentially valuable drug for fighting infectious disease.

It was in business for nearly 100 years before liquidating in bankruptcy in early 2008. History=Growth= The company was founded in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, in 1910 by Richard Levitz. Story displays with JavaScript disabled. In the 1960s, Levitz successfully pioneered selling moderately priced brand-name furniture from a warehouse-style store. It suffered in the 1990s as consumers began to prefer showroom sales that featured spaces arranged to look like actual rooms in houses. The chain continued to expand in 2005, when they acquired Seaman's Furniture and Huffman Koos stores after bankruptcy. =On a related note= Six years after the founder's retirement and no longer associated with the Levitz Furniture company, the founder reentered the furniture market purchasing the store chain RB Furniture eventually renamed The RoomStore, eventually selling them to Heilig-Meyers. He along with other family members, later bought into Ashley Furniture HomeStores, eventually owning 9 locations. =Marketing= The store is known for the slogan and jingle \\"You'll love it at Levitz.\\" =Bankruptcy and liquidation= Levitz Furniture store during liquidation sale, December 2007. Levitz was accused of having been poorly run for more than a decade starting in the 1990s. It declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy twice during the period, in 1997 and again in 2005, both times emerging after a corporate restructuring and the participation of new outside backers. On December 21, 1998, Levitz announced it would close 27 stores and lay off 25% of its workforce. The company downsized its warehouse system from 65 to 17 sites. The furniture market underwent a prolonged nationwide downturn after the September 11 attacks, and was hurt again in late 2007 by the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis. Levitz filed for bankruptcy the final time in October 2007. As of that time, it was operating nearly 80 stores, mostly in the Northeastern United States and on the West Coast, under the corporation PLVTZ LLC. In October 2008, Levitz Furniture, with bankruptcy court approval, converted its Chapter 11 case to Chapter 7, and started liquidation sales. The company was sold in bankruptcy to a group of bidders, led by Hilco Merchant Resources, that acted to rapidly liquidate its inventory and close all remaining stores.

Numerous commercial systems provide this function, or a system can be custom built or homemade. Types Whole house audio systems can be classified as: single source-single zone, single source-multiple zone or multiple source- multiple zone. =Single source, single zone= These systems distribute the same audio source everywhere—individual rooms must listen to the same audio source. This is the simplest type of system that can be installed. If designed properly, no special equipment is required other than one amplifier and a desired audio source. Care must be taken not to overload the amplifier by keeping the total speaker impedance above the amplifier's rated minimum impedance. This can be done by wiring the speakers in series, as opposed to parallel (though if the impedance is too high, power transfer is inefficient), with impedance-matching transformers, or by using constant-voltage transformers (often, 70 volts). These systems are commonly employed in retail environments and large buildings such as churches, where large, open areas benefit from additional speakers. =Single source, multiple zone= Separate volume controls are usually installed in each room or zone to compensate for differences in apparent volume due to room size and shape. Here especially, impedance-matching volume controls can be used to protect the amplifier from overload. This system design is otherwise the same as a single source, single zone in that all zones must listen to the same audio source, though volume control is independent in each room (and audio can be turned off in rooms, as desired). =Multiple source, multiple zone= These systems are the most advanced and flexible, and the most expensive. Different zones can select (and often control) different audio sources independently of other rooms. In contrast to the systems described above, this kind requires multiple amplifiers (at least one per source, but usually one per zone). This kind of system could be assembled from separate components (e.g. a splitter-router- matrix mixer, a processor, amplifiers and control panels), though knowledge of professional audio equipment and automation systems would be required. More commonly, commercial systems are employed to accomplish these tasks. Some systems distribute digital audio over Cat5 cable to amplifiers installed in each zone. Others have all equipment centralized and distribute speaker-level audio from the \\"headend\\" equipment location. Manufacturers of such equipment include NuVo and Zon. Speakers Virtually any kind of audio speaker may be used in distributed audio applications. Home audio systems usually make use of in-ceiling and in-wall speakers or small \\"satellite\\" speakers. Larger venues often use larger speakers. For outdoor installations, speakers may be camouflaged as rocks or hidden in landscaping.

Playing career=Early career= Grant was born in Bedlington and as a youth played for Morpeth Town before joining Newcastle United as a trainee in 1937. His career was interrupted by the Second World War when he joined the Royal Air Force. Towards the end of the war he signed professional papers with Manchester City, but continued with the RAF. Whilst stationed at Wareham he guested for Southampton; as he had a brother working for Southern Railway at Eastleigh he was keen to remain in Hampshire and after the cessation of hostilities Southampton bought him out of his Manchester City contract for £1,000. =Southampton= He made his debut for the \\"Saints\\" in a Second Division game away to West Bromwich Albion on 5 October 1946 on the left wing, where he soon became settled, scoring a brace in a 5–1 victory over Plymouth Argyle on 26 October. Manager Bill Dodgin preferred him on the right, however, (where he replaced Billy Bevis), teaming up with the ageing Bill Rochford. This role was not to Grant's liking and his form slumped. Although he was transfer-listed in August 1948, he remained with Southampton for the next two seasons, used occasionally as replacement for Eric Day. In 1948–49 he seemed settled back on the left before he lost his place to Bill Heaton. After a rather frustrating time, he joined Cardiff City in March 1950 with Ernie Stevenson coming to the south coast in exchange. In his four seasons at The Dell he made 64 appearances scoring 13 goals. =Cardiff City= Soon after his move to Ninian Park, manager Cyril Spiers moved him to centre forward following the arrival of Mike Tiddy, where his devastating turn of speed immediately produced instant rewards, with 14 goals coming in the 1950–51 season as Cardiff finished in third place in the Second Division. The following season Cardiff went one better finishing in second place, thus gaining promotion to the First Division. During Cardiff's promotion season Grant was top scorer with 26 goals, the first 19 of which were at home. Shortly after Cardiff secured their place in the top flight, Grant's superb form earned him a call up to the England 'B' team for a match against their French equivalents on 22 May 1952. Unfortunately for Grant the match ended in a resounding 7–1 victory for the French which brought his international career to an end. He spent two further seasons with Cardiff in the First Division where, jointly with Ken Chisholm, he was again top scorer in 1953–54 with 12 goals as Cardiff reached tenth place in the league table. After four and a half seasons at Cardiff City, Grant was sold to Ipswich Town in October 1954 for a fee of £7,500. In his career at Cardiff, Grant made a total of 159 league and FA Cup appearances scoring 67 goals. =Ipswich Town= At Ipswich he was manager Scott Duncan's most expensive signing at £7,500. At the end of Grant's first season at Portman Road, Ipswich were relegated to the Third Division South. In August 1955 Duncan resigned and was replaced as manager by Grant's former Southampton teammate, Alf Ramsey. In 1955–56 Grant contributed 16 goals (including two hat-tricks against Millwall) as Town finished in third place, missing promotion by one point. Injuries and loss of form restricted Grant to 12 appearances in 1956–57 (at the end of which Ipswich were promoted as Champions). After three years with Ipswich, Grant (now 37) dropped out of the Football League to join Llanelli as player-manager. Coaching and management After a year with Llanelli, during which his \\"astute management\\" helped them gain promotion to the Welsh Football League First Division, Grant returned to Cardiff City where he spent four years as a coach, helping them back to the First Division in 1960. He was sacked during the 1962–63 season after a row with the board. He then spent some time as a scout for Bristol Rovers before being appointed as manager at Southern League Premier Division Worcester City in December 1971. After a year at Worcester he was replaced by Graham Newton. His final managerial position was at Bromsgrove Rovers (of the Southern League Division One North) who he joined in December 1974, but was sacked nine months later. After football He subsequently became a sports teacher at a Worcester college. He died in Worcester on 17 July 1990 shortly before his 70th birthday.

Two later interpretations achieved large popularity as well as measured by radio ratings: those of Manuel Jiménez Quartet (RCA Víctor, 1948) and the one by Joe Valle with Moncho Usera and his orchestra (Seeco, 1949). Theme A street scene in Old San Juan, the subject of the song Together with La Borinqueña and Preciosa, \\"En mi Viejo San Juan\\" is considered a national anthem by many Puerto Ricans, especially those who live far away from their Caribbean homeland, Puerto Rico. In this context, the song was put in juxtaposition with Anglo songs including America from West Side Story and America by Neil Diamond.La puesta en escena de la familia immigrante puertorriqueña. Alberto Sandoval Sanchez. Mount Holyoke College. 1993. In more general terms, and despite its original military motivation and origins, the song reflects the sentiments of not just Puerto Ricans stationaed abroad as servicemen as was Estrada's brother Eloy Jr., but those of the entire DiaspoRican community as well.Words Were All We Had: Becoming Biliterate Against the Odds. María E. Fránquiz. María de la Luz Reyes, ed. Boriquen Querido: growing up bilingual in a military family. p.131. By all measures, nevertheless, the song is a reflection of Estrada's \\"intimate\\" love connection with his motherland.Expresiones de inclusividad: análisis socio histórico de \\"Mi Viejo San Juan,\\" serie de pinturas de Ramón Bulerín.

He was the son of scientist Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger (1779–1857), inventor of an early galvanometer. He studied medicine in Erlangen and Halle, earning his doctorate in 1852. Subsequently he became a medical assistant to Peter Krukenberg (1788–1865) at the University of Halle, and from 1856 worked under anatomist Heinrich Müller (1820–1864) at the University of Würzburg. In Würzburg he learned microscopic pathology and anatomy of the eye, thus developing an interest in ophthalmology. Later he moved to Berlin, where he spent six years as an assistant to Albrecht von Graefe (1828–1870). In 1868 he was appointed professor of ophthalmology at the University of Göttingen, and in 1871 succeeded Albrecht von Graefe as chair of ophthalmology at the Charité-Berlin, a position he would hold for 28 years. He is remembered for his work involving microscopic pathology of the eye. He also made contributions in his research of strabismus and glaucoma. Beginning in 1882 he was co-editor of Hermann Knapp's Archiv für Augenheilkunde. He was author of a textbook on ophthalmology called Handbuch der speciellen Augenheilkunde that was later translated into English as Handbook of ophthalmology (1878, from the 3rd German edition).

Story A young rabbit named Periwinkle Bellflower (\\"Agaric Passiflore\\" in the French version) learns of the summertime Full Moon Ball that will soon take place in the community of Beechwood Grove. Unlike the other rabbits in his family, he cannot dance, and this makes him sad. But, with the help of a conniving magpie, Magda, and a wood pigeon and a frog as his teachers, he soon learns how to do so in a couple of days. On the night of the Ball, Periwinkle takes centre stage with his moves, unaware of Madga's plan: the whole of Beechwood is supposed to laugh at him in embarrassment. However, a white owl in the audience exposes the magpie's trick. Recognising his steps, she asks Periwinkle to dance them again, much to the joy of his family and the other rabbits. He continues until dawn, when the Bellflowers return home. TV episode On November 10, 2004, France's TF1 network aired an adaptation of the book, entitled \\"Periwinkle's First Dance\\" in English.

A national security expert whose career spans government service and academia, she most recently served as Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights, where she was the key architect of the Obama Administration's preventive approach to combatting violent extremism abroad. At both the Pentagon and State Department, she built and led organizations that integrated security and human rights in their policy and operational work. She spent ten years as a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where she directed the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy. In partnership with U.S. military leaders, she helped revise U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine, led groundbreaking field assessments of U.S. civilian casualty mitigation efforts, and created new operational concepts for halting mass atrocities. Early years Sewall became interested in anti-satellite weapons during a Washington internship, turning this topic into her undergraduate honors thesis at Harvard. She did graduate work on strategic and international studies at New College, Oxford. She worked as a military analyst for the House Democratic Study Group before becoming Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell's Senior Foreign Policy Advisor in 1997. In that role, she was appointed to the bipartisan Senate Arms Control Observer Group, monitoring U.S. arms negotiations and treaty compliance. For six years, Sewall advised Mitchell and drafted legislation to halt U.S. nuclear testing, halt U.S. support for Cambodian rebels, oppose chemical weapons use in Iraq, and reform the War Powers Resolution.  DOD  In 1993, Sewall moved to the Pentagon, serving as the inaugural Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Peacekeeping and Peace Enforcement Policy. She built the peacekeeping office mission, staff, and operations to provide equipment and services to the United Nations. She led Defense Department policy during the expansion of UN peacekeeping in Haiti, Somalia, and Bosnia. Under her leadership, the Peacekeeping Office also absorbed all DOD humanitarian policy and activities. Harvard and military partnerships In 2000, Sewall transitioned to academia, where she helped shape the field of civilian security. Sewall joined Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where she launched the Project on the Means of Intervention, a ground-breaking forum for military and humanitarian actors to engage contentious questions about the conduct of war. Succeeding Michael Ignatieff, Sewall served as director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy for three years. She was also the Minerva Chair at the U.S. Naval War College in 2012. As a professor, Sewall taught classes on the tension between values and interests in US foreign policy and on the use of force for almost a decade. She is best known for her research on minimizing the effects of war upon civilian populations and her work with military actors to put these ideas into practice. She collaborated with General David Petraeus to revise U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine, making humanitarian issues central to the project, and writing an influential introduction to Field Manual FM 3-24.Fred Kaplan, The Insurgents: David Petraeus and the Plot to Change the American Way of War, Simon and Schuster 2013George F. Will, Letting Soldiers do the Thinking, September 9, 2007 Washington Post Sewall subsequently launched the MARO Project, a partnership with the U.S. Army Peacekeeping Institute, to develop an operational concept for intervening to halt mass atrocities.Nathan Hodge, Making Plans to Stop Mass Murder, May 10, 2011 Wall Street Journal The MARO Handbook: A Military Planning Guide, was incorporated into U.S. Army doctrine. Sewall also conceived and led the first major field study on civilian casualty mitigation, which she conducted in Afghanistan with an inter-service team of researchers over 2008-2009. The Joint Civilian Casualty Study, as the unclassified version is known, documented the viability of enhancing mission effectiveness while reducing civilian harm and provided recommendations for institutionalizing civilian protection.Spencer Ackerman, Army Writes New Manual on Preventing Civilian Deaths, Wired 6-14-11  Obama Campaign, Transition, and State Department  Sewall was an early foreign policy advisor to then-candidate Barack Obama and served as a national surrogate during the 2008 campaign. She helped lead his pre-election transition effort and following the election directed the reviews of all national security, foreign policy, intelligence and development agencies before returning to Harvard. President Obama nominated Sewall to be Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy and Human Rights (known bureaucratically as \\"J\\") and she was confirmed on February 11, 2014. Sewall was responsible for integrating a reconfigured team of 5 bureaus and 3 offices with widely disparate missions, some 2,000 employees, and over $5 billion annual budget. An early strategic review process produced a joint J mission and three key priorities that guided Sewall's tenure: preventing the spread of violent extremism, preventing mass atrocities, and advancing the rule of law and anticorruption. She is credited with spearheading the Obama Administration's 2015 Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) policy and the associated White House Summit to Counter Violent Extremism hosted by the State Department. The policy harnessed non-military foreign assistance to prevent radicalization of vulnerable communities and elevated the role of civil society in prevention efforts. Sewall also consistently emphasized the importance of governance and human rights in the counterterrorism battle. The United Nations ultimately adopted this comprehensive, rights-based approach, which it calls preventing violent extremism (PVE). Sewall also strengthened the State Department's ability to understand and prevent conflict, particularly mass killings of civilians. She worked to elevate corruption as a U.S. foreign policy priority and security issue. Sewall's personal diplomatic engagement focused on preventing conflict, terrorism, and atrocities in countries such as Nigeria, Guatemala, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, East Africa, Bangladesh, and Kazakhstan.  Personal life  Sewall has been married to Thomas P. Conroy since 1994. They have four daughters. Conroy served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 2007 to 2015.

Frutig (August 19, 1918 - February 26, 2011http://blog.packers.com/2011/03/02/last-living-packer-from-41-green-bay- chicago-playoff-game-died/) was an American football end who played for the University of Michigan Wolverines from 1938 to 1940. He was selected as a first-team All-American in 1940 by William Randolph Hearst's International News Service. A teammate of Heisman Trophy winner Tom Harmon for three years at Michigan, Frutig was Harmon's main receiver, and played in the National Football League (NFL) with the Green Bay Packers (1941, 1945) and Detroit Lions (1945–1946). Early years Born and raised in River Rouge, Michigan, Frutig was the son of a River Rouge councilman. 1938 season Frutig attended the University of Michigan from 1937 to 1941. He came to Michigan with very little football reputation and is reported to have “barely made the freshman squad” in 1937. Frutig put himself through college by covering Ann Arbor for a Detroit newspaper. As a sophomore in 1938, he was part of coach Fritz Crisler's first Michigan football team. This was the year that Crisler introduced the Winged Helmet at Michigan. He was “just another varsity candidate as a sophomore” in 1938 but before the season was over, he was “the best end” on the team. “That's real development,” said Fielding H. Yost. Going into the 1938 season, Michigan had not scored a touchdown against Ohio State in four years. On November 19, the drought ended as Michigan beat the Buckeyes, 18–0. In the fourth quarter, Frutig caught two passes from Tom Harmon, one a 22-yard pass to the 18-yard line and then a five-yard pass for a touchdown. 1939 season As the 1939 season got underway, former Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost called Frutig the greatest Michigan pass receiver since Bennie Oosterbaan. Yost said, \\"He's got the grace and the speed. And the tips of his fingers appear coated with glue.\\" Frutig was also described as “a sweet defensive player.” In the Big Ten opener against Iowa, Frutig caught a 27-yard pass from Tom Harmon and was pushed out of bounds at the two-yard line to set up Michigan's first touchdown in a 27–7 win. However, he suffered a twisted knee in the Iowa game and did not play against Chicago. He came back in the Minnesota game but was injured again, with a dislocated ankle tendon, and did not play the rest of the season. 1940 season Frutig finally put together a complete season as a senior in 1940. Hw started all eight games at end as the Wolverines went 7–1 and were ranked third in the final AP poll. The only loss was a 7–6 defeat to Minnesota. The 1940 season was the year Tom Harmon won the Heisman Trophy and Frutig's accomplishments were largely overshadowed. In Michigan's eight games, Frutig had 12 receptions for 181 yards (over 15 yards per catch) and three touchdowns. He also blocked five punts and won a reputation as a superior defensive player. As the 1940 season was about to start, Yost said that Frutig was the best pass catcher he had seen in ten years, though he admitted Frutig was \\"not the best wingman\\" in other areas of play. In the season opener against the California Bears, Michigan won 41–0 and Frutig blocked one of Reinhard's punts, setting up Harmon's fifth touchdown. In the second period against Illinois, Frutig caught a Harmon pass at the 25-yard line and ran untouched across the goal line. On the next possession, Illinois drove the ball to the Michigan 12-yard line, but Frutig intercepted a Pfeffer pass to end the threat. Against Pennsylvania, Frutig made a “leaping catch on the goal line” for a touchdown on a pass from Harmon, as the Wolverines won, 14–0. Frutig played all 60 minutes against Penn and said afterward he could have played 60 minutes more. “Of course,” Frutig added, “I'd need that boy Al Wistert right by me if I had to play much more than the regulation time.” The season's only loss came to Minnesota in a close 7–6 game. Frutig nearly won the game for Michigan as he blocked a George Franck punt, which Reuben Kelto recovered on the Minnesota three-yard line. But Minnesota intercepted Harmon's pass in the end zone, and Michigan lost by one point. Harmon had also missed a point after touchdown kick earlier in the game. Despite the loss, one columnist said of Frutig's performance against Minnesota: “The best end I saw all year I saw in this game. That was Frutig of Michigan and that goes for offense and defense. He ruined about six coming in there trying to block those Gopher punts. He did block one.” Against Northwestern, Frutig blocked a punt from the end zone to set up Harmon's 30th touchdown of the season. In his final game in the Michigan uniform, a 40–0 win over Ohio State, Frutig caught his third touchdown pass of the season. Aside from his pass receiving and defense, Frutig won praise as a punt blocker. In Michigan's eight games in 1940, Frutig “personally blocked five punts, all of them at a crucial moments.” Oddly, despite numerous accounts referencing his punt blocking exploits, Frutig is not listed among NCAA Division I players to have blocked as many as three punts in a season. Frutig was a first-team All- American pick by Hearst Publications' International News Service and football writer Maxwell Stiles. Frutig was selected as a third-team All-American by UP, AP and Central Press Association. He was chosen by conference coaches as a first-team player on the Associated Press All-Big Ten Conference team. Frutig, Harmon and Forest Evashevski teamed up one last time in the 16th annual East- West Shrine Charity Football Game in San Francisco on New Year's Day 1941. Evashevski and Frutig scored the East's only touchdowns, with Frutig scoring on a 21-yard pass from Harmon into the end zone. Frutig leaped high to grab Harmon's pass “while boxed in between two West defense men.” Professional football and military service Frutig was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the third round of the 1941 NFL Draft, and played for the team in 1941. However, when the United States entered World War II, Frutig enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he earned his wings as a naval aviator. While serving in the Navy, Frutig was named to the All-Navy All-American football team in 1942. He also played for the 1942 Corpus Christi Naval Air Station Comets football team that compiled a 4–3–1 record playing against southwest college teams. He also served as a flight instructor at a naval air base at Grosse Ile, Michigan. Later years In the early 1950s, Frutig served as the end coach at Washington State College in Pullman. College teammate Forest Evashevski was the Cougars' head coach, and recruited him to the WSC coaching staff in 1950\\\\. Frutig was credited with developing end Ed Barker, who broke two Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) pass-catching records in 1951. After two seasons, he resigned in December 1951 to take a job with an advertising firm in East Lansing, Michigan, and went on to become successful in the advertising business. In 1967, Frutig and Bob Westfall were the leaders of the Alumni for Evy Committee, organized to bring Evashevski to Michigan as both head football coach and athletic director. Instead, Bo Schembechler and Don Canham were hired to the jobs. Frutig's daughter, Suzy Bales, has published thirteen books about gardening, including \\"The Garden in Winter\\" published in 2007.

Their fear may stem from a general anxiety about sexuality, from a fear that they are physically inferior, or from a fear that their nakedness leaves them exposed and unprotected. Gymnophobia refers to an actual fear of nudity, but most sufferers with the condition learn how to function in general society despite the condition. They may, for example, avoid changing rooms, washrooms, showers, and beaches. However, the condition can be regarded as an anxiety disorder if the person cannot control the phobia or it is interfering with their daily life. Gymnophobia has been likened to the fictional condition \\"never-nude\\" portrayed in the comedy series Arrested Development.

The tapes consisted of 16 songs, all created by a solo Hendrix armed only with his voice and a Martin acoustic guitar. Near the end of the collection lies an embryonic two-part rendition of his superhero themed funk-rock tune \\"Astro Man\\", in which Hendrix sings lines from the 1950s Mighty Mouse cartoon theme and makes humorous references to Superman. Other songs from the Black Gold sessions were also further developed in the studio and have surfaced in the Hendrix catalogue (\\"Stepping Stone\\", \\"Machine Gun\\", and \\"Drifting\\"), but at least nine of the songs are known to be unique to the tapes. Months later, at the Isle of Wight Festival, Hendrix gave the tapes to his drummer Mitch Mitchell to have him listen and comment on the necessary rhythm section requirements for recording the songs. After Hendrix's death in September 1970, Mitchell simply forgot about the tapes, apparently unaware that they were one-of-a-kind masters. For 22 years, the Black Gold tapes sat in a black Ampex tape box that Hendrix tied shut with a headband and labelled \\"BG\\". It was not until 1992 that Tony Brown, the avid Hendrix collector and biographer, interviewed Mitchell and learnt that the mythical Black Gold tapes, thought to have been stolen from Jimi's apartment by vandals who ransacked it for collectibles soon after his death, were lying in Mitchell's home in England. Mitchell also possessed the Martin guitar that was used to create the material. Brown was invited to review the tapes and published a summary of his account, but to date the material has not been released and is not available to Hendrix collectors. There is a bootleg release called \\"Black Gold\\" but that is a collection of Electric Ladyland outtakes and rehearsals, and does not include the Greenwich Village material. Only Brown and a handful of friends close to Mitch Mitchell have listened to the real Black Gold tapes. Many aficionados consider Black Gold the \\"holy grail\\" of Hendrix collectibles. The themed songs, plus the label markings and conventions used by Hendrix to identify the tapes lead fans to believe that this demo represents a proposed fifth studio album and predict that the material will reveal the broadest extensions of Hendrix's intended musical direction. Mitch Mitchell's association with Experience Hendrix LLC was an indicator that Black Gold might see worldwide release. Mitchell's death, however, means that the future and whereabouts of Black Gold are even more uncertain. In March 2010, Janie Hendrix stated that Black Gold will be released \\"this decade\\", though that did not eventuate. \\"Suddenly November Morning\\" was included in the album West Coast Seattle Boy: The Jimi Hendrix Anthology, released in November 2010. The first track on the Black Gold suite, it was released as the last track on the album. This is the only track from Black Gold ever released. Tentative track listing There is little to go by regarding the actual names of the tracks on Black Gold. On the only recorded source Jimi had written \\"Idea for L.P. side 1 suite ...

The transmission of the Greek Classics to Latin Western Europe during the Middle Ages was a key factor in the development of intellectual life in Western Europe. Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics, and Society, Marvin Perry, Myrna Chase, Margaret C. Jacob, James R. Jacob, 2008, 903 pages, p.261/262, Google Books webpage: [https://books.google.com/books?id=kKGgoNo4un0C&pg=PA261&lpg;=PA261 BooksG-kK]. Interest in Greek texts and their availability was scarce in the Latin West during the earlier Middle Ages, but as traffic to the East increased so did Western scholarship. Classical Greek philosophy consisted of various original works ranging from those from Ancient Greece (e.g. Aristotle) to those Greco-Roman scholars in the classical Roman Empire (e.g. Ptolemy). Though these works were originally written in Greek, for centuries the language of scholarship in the Mediterranean region, many were translated into Syriac, Arabic, and Persian during the Middle Ages and the original Greek versions were often unknown to the West. With increasing Western presence in the East due to the Crusades, and the gradual collapse of the Byzantine Empire during the later Middle Ages, many Byzantine Greek scholars fled to Western Europe bringing with them many original Greek manuscripts, and providing impetus for Greek-language education in the West and further translation efforts of Greek scholarship into Latin.Alexander. A. Vasiliev. History of the Byzantine Empire The line between Greek scholarship and Arab scholarship in Western Europe was very blurred during the Middle Ages and the early Modern Period. Sometimes the concept of the transmission of Greek Classics is often used to refer to the collective knowledge that was obtained from the Arab and Byzantine Empires, regardless of where the knowledge actually originated. However, being once and even twice removed from the original Greek, these Arabic versions were later supplanted by improved, direct translations by Moerbeke and others in the 13th century and after. Direct reception of Greek texts As knowledge of Greek declined in the west with the fall of the Western Roman Empire, so did knowledge of the Greek texts, many of which had remained without a Latin translation.Lindberg 52 The fragile nature of papyrus as a writing medium meant that older texts not copied onto expensive parchment would eventually crumble and be lost. After the Fourth Crusade (1202–1204) and the Sack of Constantinople (1204), scholars such as William of Moerbeke gained access to the original Greek texts of scientists and philosophers, including Aristotle, Archimedes, Hero of Alexandria and Proclus, that had been preserved in the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, and translated them directly into Latin.Grabmann; note that many of William's works were redactions rather than original translations, as is commonly supposed The final decline and collapse of the Byzantine empire in the fifteenth century heightened contact between its scholars and those of the west. Translation into Latin of the full range of Greek classics ensued, including the historians, poets, playwrights and non-Aristotelian philosophers. Manuel Chrysoloras (c. 1355–1415) translated portions of Homer and Plato. Guarino da Verona (1370–1460) translated Strabo and Plutarch. Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459) translated Xenophon, Diodorus, and Lucian. Francesco Filelfo (1398–1481) translated portions of Plutarch, Xenophon and Lysias. Lorenzo Valla (1407–1457) translated Thucydides and Herodotus. Marsilio Ficino (1433–1499) and his Platonic Academy translated Plato. Poliziano (1454–1494) translated Herodian and portions of Epictetus and Plutarch. Regiomontanus and George of Trebizond translated Ptolemy's Almagest.Johann Müller Regiomontanus Important patrons were Basilios Bessarion (1403–1472) and Pope Nicholas V (1397–1455). Armenia harbored libraries of Greek classical literature. An Armenian codex of Aristotle (Δ) is one of the main sources in the text-critical apparatus of today's Greek text.L. Minio- Paluello. Aristoteles Categoriae et liber de interpretatione recognovit brevique adnotation instruxit. Oxford Classical Texts. Syriac translations Syriac plays an important role in modern text-criticism even today. The Oxford Classical issue of the Greek text of Aristotle's Organon uses the sigla Ρ, Ι, and Γ, which are texts dating from Christian possessions from the 6th to 8th century. Syriac translations played a major role for the later reception into Arabic. These translators from Syriac were mostly Nestorian and Jacobite Christians, working in the two hundred years following the Abbasid period. The most important translator of this group was the Syriac-speaking Christian Hunayn Ibn Ishaq (809-873), known to the Latins as Joannitius. Western Roman Empire Classical Greek learning was firmly found in every metropolis of the Roman empire, including in Rome itself. =Boethius= In Rome, Boethius propagated works of Greek classical learning. Boethius intended to pass on the great Greco-Roman culture to future generations by writing manuals on music and astronomy, geometry, and arithmetic.General Audience of Pope Benedict XVI, Boethius and Cassiodorus; accessed November 4, 2009. Several of Boethius' writings, which were largely influential during the Middle Ages, drew from the thinking of Porphyry and Iamblichus.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Anicius Manlius SeverinusBoethius. Internet. Availablefrom http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/boethius/; accessed November 7, 2009. Boethius wrote a commentary on the Isagoge by Porphyry, which highlighted the existence of the problem of universals: whether these concepts are subsistent entities which would exist whether anyone thought of them, or whether they only exist as ideas. This topic concerning the ontological nature of universal ideas was one of the most vocal controversies in medieval philosophy. Besides these advanced philosophical works, Boethius is also reported to have translated important Greek texts for the topics of the quadrivium. His loose translation of Nicomachus's treatise on arithmetic (De institutione arithmetica libri duo) and his textbook on music (De institutione musica Libri quinque, unfinished) contributed to medieval education. De arithmetica, begins with modular arithmetic, such as even and odd, evenly even, evenly odd, and oddly even. He then turns to unpredicted complexity by categorizing numbers and parts of numbers.Schrader, Dorothy V. ´De Arithmetica, Book I, of Boethius.¡ Mathematics Teacher 61 (1968):615-28.

These were widely used during the Middle Ages. =Early Middle Ages in the Western Provinces= In the Western Provinces (what today is considered the Western Europe's heartland), the collapsing Roman empire lost many Greek manuscripts which were not preserved by monasteries. However, due to the expense and dearth of writing materials, monastic scribes could recycle old parchments. The parchments could be reused after scraping off the ink of the old texts, and writing new books on the previously used parchment, creating what is called a palimpsest.Reynolds & Wilson, Scribes and Scholars, (1991) p. 85-86 - But note that recycling of parchment did not necessarily prejudice against the genre, as Tischendorf's discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus shows. Fortunately for modern scholars, the old writing can still be retrieved, and many extremely valuable works, which would have otherwise been lost, have been recovered in this way. As the language of Roman aristocrats and scholars, Greek died off along with the Roman Empire in the West, and by 500 CE, almost no one in Western Europe was able to read (or translate) Greek texts, and with the rise of the Islamic Empire, the west was further cut off from the language. After a while, only a few monasteries in the west had Greek works, and even fewer of them copied these works (mainly the Irish).Laughlin 139 Some Irish monks had been taught by Greek and Latin missionaries who probably had brought Greek texts with them.Laughlin 140 =Late Middle Ages: William of Moerbeke= William of Moerbeke was one of the most prolific and influential translators of Greek philosophical texts in the middle half of the thirteenth century. Very little is known of William's life.see Grabmann 1946 and the short account by Minio- Paluello 1974 He was born probably in 1215 in the village of Moerbeke, now in Belgium, and probably entered the Dominican priory in Leuven as a young man. Most of his surviving work was done during 1259-72. William's contribution to the \\"recovery\\" of Aristotle in the 13th century undoubtedly helped in forming a clearer picture of Greek philosophy, and particularly of Aristotle, than was given by the Arabic versions on which they had previously relied, and which had distorted or obscured the relation between Platonic and Aristotelian systems of philosophy.Fryde William's translation of Proclus was also important, demonstrating that the influential book Liber de Causis, was not a genuine work of Aristotle, but rather derived from Proclus' Elementatio Theologica.Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2001, Macmillan Reference USA According to a tradition originating in the later Middle Ages, William knew Thomas Aquinas and was commissioned by him to make some of the translations. But there is no contemporary record of the friendship or the commissions. If they did meet, it is most likely during the three or four years Aquinas was working at Orvieto, i.e. not before the election of Pope Urban IV in August 1261, who invited Aquinas to serve at the Papal court, and not after 1265, when Aquinas left for Rome. His translation of De motu animalium is cited by Thomas in Summa Contra Gentiles, probably completed in 1264. Arabic translations and commentary Arabic logicians had inherited Greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered Egypt and the Levant. Their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the Arab West into Spain and Sicily, which became important centers for this transmission of ideas. Western Arabic translations of Greek works (found in Iberia and Sicily) originates in the Greek sources preserved by the Byzantines. These transmissions to the Arab West took place in two main stages. =First period: Greek–Arabic translations= An Arab's depiction of Socrates teaching his students. Umayyads The first period of transmission during 8th and 9th centuries was preceded by a period of conquest, as Arabs took control of previously Hellenized areas such as Egypt and the Levant in the 7th century.Rosenthal 2 At this point they first began to encounter Greek ideas, though from the beginning, many Arabs were hostile to classical learning. Because of this hostility, the religious Caliphs could not support scientific translations. Translators had to seek out wealthy business patrons rather than religious ones. Until Abbasid rule in the 8th century, however, there was little work in translation. Most knowledge of Greek during Umayyad rule was gained from those scholars of Greek who remained from the Byzantine period, rather than through widespread translation and dissemination of texts. A few scholars argue that translation was more widespread than is thought during this period, but theirs remains the minority view.Rosenthal 3-4 Abbasids The main period of translation was during Abbasid rule. The 2nd Abbasid Caliph al-Mansur moved the capital from Damascus to Baghdad.Lindberg 55 Here he founded the great library with texts containing Greek Classical texts. Al-Mansur ordered this rich fund of world literature translated into Arabic. Under al-Mansur and by his orders, translations were made from Greek, Syriac, and Persian, the Syriac and Persian books being themselves translations from Greek or Sanskrit. The 6th-century King of Persia, Anushirvan (Chosroes I) the Just, had introduced many Greek ideas into his kingdom.Brickman 84-85 Aided by this knowledge and juxtaposition of beliefs, the Abbasids considered it valuable to look at Islam with Greek eyes, and to look at the Greeks with Islamic eyes. Abbasid philosophers also pressed the idea that Islam had from the very beginning stressed the gathering of knowledge as important to the religion. These new lines of thought allowed the work of amassing and translating Greek ideas to expand as it never before had.Rosenthal 5 =Baghdad's House of Wisdom= The Caliph al-Mansur was the patron who did most to attract the Nestorian physicians to the city of Baghdad which he had founded, and he was also a prince who did much to encourage those who set themselves to prepare Arabic translations of Greek, Syriac, and Persian works. Still more important was the patronage given by the Caliph al-Ma'mun, who in A.H. 217 (= A.D. 832) founded a school at Baghdad, suggested no doubt by the Nestorians and Zoroastrian schools already existing, and this he called the Bayt al-Hikma or \\"House of Wisdom\\", and this he placed under the guidance of Yahya ibn Masawaih (d. A.H. 243 = A.D. 857), who was an author both in Syriac and Arabic, and learned also in the use of Greek. His medical treatise on \\"Fevers\\" was long in repute and was afterwards translated into Latin and into Hebrew. The most important work of the academy however was done by Yahya's pupils and successors, especially Abu Zayd Hunayn ibn Ishaq al-Ibadi (d. 263 A.H. = A.D. 876), the Nestorian physician to whom we have already referred as translating into Syriac the chief medical authorities as well as parts of Aristotle's Organon. After studying at Baghdad under Yahya he visited Alexandria and returned, not only with the training given at what was then the first medical school, but with a good knowledge of Greek which he employed in making translations in Syriac and Arabic. Later the Caliph al-Mamun also sent emissaries to the Byzantines to gather Greek manuscripts for his new university, making it a center for Greek translation work in the Arab world. At first only practical works, such as those on medicine and technology were sought after, but eventually works on philosophy became popular.Lindberg 56Long 96 Most scholars agree that during this period rhetoric, poetry, histories, and dramas were not translated into Arabic, since they were viewed as serving political ends which were not to be sought after in Arab states. Instead, philosophical and scientific works were almost the entire focus of translation. This has been disputed by a minority of scholars, however, who argue that stories such as the Arabian Nights carry clear parallels to Greek literature—evidence that many Arabs were familiar with Greek humanities more than is thought.Grunebaum 277-278 =After translation: Arabic commentary on Greek works= A medieval Arabic representation of Aristotle teaching a student. Al-Kindi (Alkindus), a famous logician and prominent figure in the House of Wisdom, is unanimously hailed as the \\"father of Islamic or Arabic philosophy\\". His synthesis of Greek philosophy with Islamic beliefs met with much opposition, and at one point he was flogged by those opposed to his ideas. He argued that one could accept the Koran and other sacred texts, and work from that point to determine truth. Whenever he ran into an impasse, he would abandon the Greek ideas in favor of the Islamic faith.Laughlin 114-117 He is considered to be largely responsible for pulling the Arab world out of a mystic and theological way of thinking into a more rationalistic mode. Previous to al-Kindi, for example, on the question of how the immaterial God of the Koran could sit on a throne in the same book, one theologist had said, “The sitting is known, its modality is unknown. Belief in it is a necessity, and raising questions regarding it is a heresy.” Few of al-Kindi's writings have survived, making it difficult to judge his work directly, but it is clear from what exists that he carefully worked to present his ideas in a way acceptable to other Muslims. After Al- Kindi, several philosophers argued more radical views, some of whom even rejected revelation, most notably the Persian logician, Al-Razi or “Rhazes.” Considered one of the most original thinkers among the Persian philosophers, he challenged both Islamic and Greek ideas in a rationalist manner. Also, where Al-Kindi had focused on Aristotle, Al-Rhazi focused on Plato, introducing his ideas as a contrast. After Al-Kindi, Al-Farabi (Alpharabius) introduced Neoplatonism through his knowledge of the Hellenistic culture of Alexandria. Unlike Al-Kindi or Al-Rhazi, Al-Farabi was hesitant to express his own feelings on issues of religion and philosophy, choosing rather to speak only through the words of the various philosophies he came across. Decades after Al-Farabi, Ibn Sina (Avicenna) compiled the ideas of many Muslim philosophers of the previous centuries and established a new school which is known as Avicennism. After this period, Greek philosophy went into a decline in the Islamic world. Theologians such as Al-Ghazali argued that many realms of logic only worked in theory, not in reality. His ideas would later influence Western European religious ideas. In response to Al-Ghazali's The Incoherence of the Philosophers, the Andalusian philosopher Ibn Rushd (Averroes), the most famous commentator on Aristotle and founder of Averroism, wrote a refutation entitled The Incoherence of the Incoherence. By 1200, when philosophy was again revived in the Islamic world, Al-Kindi and Al-Farabi were no longer remembered, while Ibn Sina's compilation work still was.Laughlin 119 Ibn Sina, otherwise known as Avicenna, would later heavily influence European philosophical, theological and scientific thought, becoming known as “the most famous scientist of Islam” to many Western historians. =Western European reception of Greek ideas via the Arabian tradition= While Greek ideas gradually permeated the Islamic world, Muslims conquests extended to the European continent. Spain was conquered by the Arabs around 700 AD, even reaching as far as Poitiers, France by 732 (Battle of Tours). By 902 Sicily was conquered. With the aid of Greek and other ideas, Spain in particular quickly became the most heavily populated and thriving area in Europe. One of the rulers of Muslim Spain, Al-Hakam II, made an effort to gather books from all over the Arab world, creating a library which would later become a center for translation into Latin.Lindberg 57-8 As books were gathered, so were many Arab scholars who had studied Greek ideas in the east. For example, Muhammud ibn 'Abdun and 'Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Ismail came to Spain and introduced many ideas about medicine as well as several of the works of Aristotle and Euclid. Ibn Bajjah (known as \\"Avempace\\") and Ibn Rushd (known as “Averroes”) were among the other famous philosophers of Spain who furthered the expansion of Greek ideas in medicine and philosophy.Laughlin 120 Prior to Averroes, many Arab philosophers had confused Aristotle with Plotinus, a Hellenized Egyptian who founded Neoplatonism and had mixed Aristotle's ideas with Plato's. Averroes rediscovered the “true” Aristotle by translating key texts reintroducing him to Arab Spain. He also challenged Al-Ghazali's largely anti- Greek philosophies and offered some of the best reconciliation of Islam and philosophy of the time.Laughlin 121 Key to his arguments was the idea that although there was only one truth, that truth could be expressed in many ways, including both philosophy and religion. He even used the Qur'an to back up his arguments in favor of Greek philosophy and logic, especially the passage: “It is He, [O Muhammad] who has revealed the Book to you...some of its verses are unambiguous...and the others are ambiguous...only God and those confirmed in knowledge know its interpretation.” Averroes argued that “those confirmed in knowledge” were philosophers. The Scholastic philosophers and theologians of the Middle Ages such as Aquinas later called Averroes “The Commentator,” and Michael the Scot translated several of Averroes' works within fifty years of the Arab's death. However, Averroes' reception in Western Europe contrasted with his ultimate rejection by Arabs in Spain.Laughlin 122 Soon after Averroes, Greek ideas in the Arab world were largely opposed by those who disliked anything not “truly Arab.”Laughlin 124 The Christian medieval scholar St. Jerome (here depicted by Domenico Ghirlandaio, church of Ognissanti, Florence) was against many Greek ideas. Arabic: Latin or Vernacular While Muslims were busy translating and adding their own ideas to Greek philosophies, the Latin West was still suspicious of pagan ideas. Leaders of the Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire also frowned upon philosophy, and the Empire had just gone through a period of plague, famine, and war.Laughlin 104 Further west, several key figures in European history who came after Boethius had strengthened the overwhelming shift away from Greek ideas. For centuries, Greek ideas in Europe were all but non-existent, until the Eastern part of the Roman Empire – Byzantine – was sacked during the crusades unlocking numerous Greek texts.Transmission of the Classics Within Western Europe, only a few monasteries had Greek works, and even fewer of them copied these works. There was a brief period of revival, when the Anglo-Saxon monk Alcuin and others reintroduced some Greek ideas during the Carolingian Renaissance of the 8th century.Laughlin 141 After Charlemagne's death, however, intellectual life again fell into decline.Laughlin 143-46 By the 12th century, however, scholastic thought was beginning to develop, leading to the rise of universities throughout Europe.Laughlin 147-48 These universities gathered what little Greek thought had been preserved over the centuries, including Boethius' commentaries on Aristotle. They also served as places of discussion for new ideas coming from new translations from Arabic throughout Europe. By the 12th century, European fear of Islam as a military threat had lessened somewhat. Toledo, in Spain, had fallen from Arab hands in 1085, Sicily in 1091, and Jerusalem in 1099.Watt 59-60Lindberg 58-59 These linguistic borderlands proved fertile ground for translators. These areas had been conquered by Arab Greek and Latin-speaking peoples over the centuries and contained linguistic abilities from all these cultures. The small and unscholarly population of the Crusader Kingdoms contributed very little to the translation efforts, until the Fourth Crusade took most of the Byzantine Empire. Sicily, still largely Greek-speaking was more productive; it had seen rule under Byzantines, Arabs, and Italians, and many were fluent in Greek, Arabic, and Latin. Sicilians, however, were less influenced by Arabs and instead are noted more for their translations directly from Greek to Latin. Spain, on the other hand, was an ideal place for translation from Arabic to Latin because of a combination of rich Latin and Arab cultures living side by side. Spain and Sicily As early as the 10th century, scholars in Andalusia had begun to gather translated texts, and in the latter half of that century began transmitting them to the rest of Europe.Lindberg 60-61 After the Reconquista of the 12th century, however, Spain opened even further for Christian scholars, who were now able to work in “friendly” religious territory.Lindberg 62-65; Palencia 270 As these Europeans encountered Islamic philosophy, their previously held fears turned to admiration, and from Spain came a wealth of Arab knowledge of mathematics and astronomy. Foreigners came to Spain to translate from all over Europe, and Toledo became a center for such travelers, since so many of its citizens wrote daily in both Arabic and Latin-based languages. Although there was a huge amount of work being accomplished in Spain, there was no central school for translating and no real organized effort, as there had been at times among the Arabs. Translators came from many different backgrounds and translated for many different reasons. For example, non-Christian Jewish scholars participated by translating Arabic works which had already been translated into Hebrew, into Latin and Vulgate languages.Brickman 86Lindberg 67 Some scholars, however, have suggested that Raymond de Sauvetât the Archbishop of Toledo, seems to have started an organized movement of support for translations, and many scholars who seem to be associated with him in documents may have translated two-by-two, working together. Whether Raimond actually started a truly central, organized effort at translation, later generalized as the Toledo School of Translators, remains unknown. What is known is that most translations coming out of Spain dealt with either medicine or astronomy. Hugo of Santalla, for example, translated a large selection of Arabic works all dealing with astronomy, as well as tracing the history of astronomic thought through history, underscoring the work of the Greeks, Persians, Hellenists, and Arabs in one large preface to his volume.Pingree 227-9. By the 13th century, translation had declined in Spain, but it was on the rise in Italy and Sicily, and from there to all of Europe. Adelard of Bath, an Englishman, traveled to Sicily and the Arab world, translating works on astronomy and mathematics, including the first complete translation of Euclid's Elements.Clagett, 356. Powerful Norman kings gathered men of high knowledge from Italy, and other areas, into their courts, as signs of prestige.Lindberg 70-72 Even the Byzantines experienced an Aristotelian revival in the mid-12th century, and gathered men from Italy as well.

The longest, at 266 minutes, and one of the most complex of Godard's films, Histoire(s) du cinéma is an examination of the history of the concept of cinema and how it relates to the 20th century; in this sense, it can also be considered a critique of the 20th century and how it perceives itself. The project is widely considered the most important work of the late period of Godard's career. Histoire(s) du cinéma is always referred to by its French title, because of the untranslatable word play it implies: histoire means both \\"history\\" and \\"story,\\" and the s in parentheses gives the possibility of a plural. Therefore, the phrase Histoire(s) du cinéma simultaneously means The History of Cinema, Histories of Cinema, The Story of Cinema and Stories of Cinema. Similar double or triple meanings, as well as puns, are a recurring motif throughout Histoire(s) and much of Godard's work. The film was screened out of competition at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival. Nine years later, it was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1997 Festival. The soundtrack was released as a 5-CD boxed set on the ECM record label.Presto ClassicalLanguage GamesThe New YorkerJean-Luc Godard Is, Quietly, a Probing Musical Mind – The New York Times In 2012, it was voted the 48th greatest film of all time in a poll of film directors by Sight & Sound magazine.The top 50 Greatest Films of All TimeSight & SoundBFI Episodes Histoire(s) du cinéma consists of 4 chapters, each one subdivided into two parts, making for a total of 8 episodes.

It is located in Højbjerg, a suburb of Aarhus, Denmark. MOMU cooperates with the Institute of Prehistoric Archaeology, Medieval and Renaissance Archaeology and Anthropology at Aarhus University. The main part of the museum’s archaeological collection is of Danish origin. In addition, the Ethnographical Collections contain almost 50,000 artifacts from all over the world. They are used both for research and exhibitions. The collection also contains photographic material, films and sound recordings. The museum’s exhibitions presents several unrivaled archaeological findings from Denmark’s ancient past, among others the Grauballe Man, the world’s best preserved bog body and the large ritual weapon caches from Illerup Ådal, testifying the power struggles and warfare of the Iron Age. The collection also contains seven local rune stones. Temporary exhibitions at the museum also display examples of the world's cultural heritage.  Exhibitions  A large new museum building, designed by Henning Larsen Architects, housing both exhibitions for the public and headquarters for academic activities, was inaugurated in 2014. The museum building is constructed around a broad central staircase. The upper levels shows changing exhibits of history and culture from around the world, while the lower levels house the permanent exhibitions on Danish, Scandinavian and European history and culture. The permanent indoor exhibitions comprise the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age and Viking Age as it unfolded in Denmark and Scandinavia specifically and an exhibition on Medieval Denmark in c. 1050 to 1536. They are highly interactive in several languages, designed to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, without losing academic depth and accuracy. The prehistoric exhibitions includes these notable artifacts: * Model of a large Bronze Age barrow, \\"Borum Eshøj\\" * Thousands of items from the Iron-Age votive site at Illerup Ådal * Copies of the Golden horns of Gallehus (Guldhornene) * Grauballe Man, a bog body from Grauballe, Denmark * Various runestones, including the Mask stone (Maskestenen) * Snaptun stone, often identified as a depiction of Loki * Hørning Church, a reconstructed early Danish stave church  The historical landscape  Moesgaard Manor Reconstructed Hørning stave church Remains of a Stone Age passage grave As an open-air museum, the landscape surrounding Moesgaard Museum displays different epochs and eras of Denmark's past, from ancient to modern times. A larger part of the woodlands represents different prehistoric climatic epochs of the Holocene, and a number of reconstructed buildings are strewn across the landscape, stretching all the way to the beach and shores in the east. The buildings include several relocated tumuli from the neolithic and the Bronze Age, houses from the early Iron Age and Viking Age, and several Medieval buildings, some of which are still in use. = Stave-church and Viking houses = Just south of the new museum building, two houses and Hørning Church, a stave-church from the Viking Period have been built. First is a house from the Viking Age town of Hedeby near Schleswig, Germany. It has been dated around 870 AD and is interpreted as the home of a craftsman’s or trader’s family. The other house is a reconstruction of a pit- house from Viking Age Aarhus, dated to about 900 AD. Pit-houses are small huts, dug half-way into the ground, used as dwellings, workshops or storerooms. On a small hill behind the houses, a stave church has been erected with a bell frame. None of the original stave churches in Denmark have survived, but the floor and post-holes from a Viking Age stave church were excavated under the present Hørning Church near Randers in 1960. Compared to the medieval stone churches, it was a quite small building; 31 feet long and 15 feet wide. Also preserved from the stave church in Hørning was a portion of the so-called hammer-beam, the horizontal beam just under the roof-projection, which held the vertical planks. The \\"Hørning-plank\\" was found as early as 1887 during a restoration of the walling of the present church. It can be seen in the Danish National Museum. On the outside, the hammer-beam from Hørning was ornamented with writhing serpents, a characteristic of the Late Viking Period. On the basis of the growth-rings in the timber, the stave-church has been dated to about 1060, the transition from the Viking Age Period to the Middle Ages. At the excavation site in Hørning, traces of a bell frame were discovered. This has also been reconstructed just in front of the church entrance. The church bell has been cast at Moesgaard, following a 900-year-old description of bell casting. It is a replica of the almost 800-year-old bell from Smollerup church near Viborg. = Moesgaard Manor and surroundings = The estate of Moesgaard covers 100 hectares of park, forest, open fields and shoreline, and extends from the museum buildings down to the Bay of Aarhus. The former manor house at Moesgaard Manor was constructed in 1780–84 by nobleman and diplomat Christian Frederik Gyldenkrone (1741-1788), based upon plans by architect Christian Joseph Zuber (1736–1802). Torkild Christian Dahl (1807-1872) took ownership of the manor in 1844. In 1960 Århus County bought the manor and estate. The former manor house now houses a department of the Institutes of Archaeology and Anthropology of Aarhus University. In the park is also a house from Thailand which was donated to Moesgaard Museum by the Kingdom of Thailand in 1975. The house is around 100 years old and originally from Ayutthaya, the old capital of Siam, 200 km north of Bangkok. The house was once a part of a larger building complex. From the manor park, a 4 km long Prehistoric Track starts off, running through the estate all the way to the sea in the east. A short walk from the park, an Iron Age house has been reconstructed. It is a typical farmhouse from 200-300 AD, based on a settlement at Tofting near Husum, just south of the Danish border. This house- type was common throughout Northern Europe in its day. The building is 16 m long and both humans and cattle lived under the same roof. The open fields and slopes below the manor are grazed by sheep, goats and horses, and present a handful of ancient tumuli. In the forest of Moesgaard Skov further east, it is possible to visit the old timber-framed Medieval water mill of Moesgård Forest Mill (Skovmøllen) , powered by the stream of Giber Å. The first reference to the mill dates from 1590 but all the buildings were rebuilt and an overshot mill-wheel was installed in 1785. An extra story was added to the mill house in 1852. Production ceased in 1910, but the mill is still in full working order as both a saw and granary mill. The milling business was initiated again by a team of volunteers in 2000 and guided tours are held throughout the year. There is a restaurant in the attached buildings and Skovmøllen has a long history of recreational activities. Near Moesgaard Beach is a reconstruction of a Stone Age cult-building from the Funnel Beaker Period, around 2500 BC. The original house was located near two dolmens and a passage grave at Tustrup in Northern Djursland. It is believed that the building served religious ceremonies – perhaps as a resting place for the dead, until the flesh had decayed and the bones could be moved into surrounding graves. The original wooden building burnt to the ground at some point, and parts of the roof sheeting of birch-bark with turf cover collapsed inwards with the burnt wall planking. 26 richly decorated offering vessels and pottery ladles representing the golden age of pottery in Danish prehistory were found inside the collapsed building. The ceramics can be seen on display at the Moesgaard Museum. Further east, at the mouth of the Giber Å stream on the beach, is an old fisherman's house from 1856. The residents used to serve the estate until 1935, when Aarhus Municipality acquired the land. Moesgård beach is popular in the summer with people looking for a sunbath, recreational watersport activities or a place for picnics. Public toilets and a kiosk selling ice-cream and fast food can be found here. In 2019, the landscape around Moesgaard Museum was used for the IAAF 2019 Cross Country World Championships. The route included the museum buildings grass covered roof. =Prehistoric Trail= Footbridge passes through the forest swap The Tustrup House The Prehistoric Trail is a 4 km trail that runs from the Moesgaard Manor to the beach and back transecting most of the 100 hectare area of garden, park, forest, fields and beaches that is owned by the Moesgaard Museum. Along the route are several reconstructed prehistoric buildings and burial mounds. The trail also passes through the Prehistoric Forest, an area divided into sections representing the successive forest types of Denmark since the ice sheets of the last ice age retreated.Kirkeby, Jens: Guide til dyrelivet og fuglene ved Oldtidsstien på Moesgård. 2001 Moesgård Museum. Points of interests - both historical and biological - are explained on information boards.Moesgaard Museum - Nature For the most part the trail is marked by large white stones adorned with a red dot. The Prehistoric Trail leads you through the baroque-styled Manor Park, laid out around the same time Moesgaard Manor was constructed (in the 1770s) down to the field shown on maps as \\"Jens Michelsens toft\\". Here are several stone burial chambers from various parts of Denmark illustrating how traditions of burial changed over time during the Stone and Bronze Ages. These were relocated here and carefully reconstructed when their original sites were lost to development. The field is grazed by Gotland sheep in the summer to keep the vegetation around the burial chambers down.Forhistorisk Museum Moesgård: Moesgaard : Oldtidsstien, 1973.J. Aasbjerg: Oldtidsstien ved Moesgård, Jul i Århus, 1972; Årg. 29 (1972). - p. 28-30 The next points of interest along the trail include the old watermill, which today also houses a restaurant, and the ruin of a long barrow. The route then leads into the ancient woodland, the forest swamp, which is crossed on a footbridge. Among the Red Alders are tussocks rich in herbs. The trail continues through The Prehistoric Forest, which the museum planted in 1964 to illustrate the ecological succession in the forests of Denmark from the Stone Age until today. Thus the forest is divided into the periods Birch and Pine period (9550-8250 BC), Hazel and Pine (8250-7500 BC), Early Lime (7000-3800 BC), Late Lime (3800-700 BC) og Beech (700 BC - today).Fyhn, Mette Wessel: Guide til kultursporene i landskabet. 2006 Moesgård Museum. The trail exits the Beech period close to the beach. From the beach the trail leads back west through the forest past reconstructed houses including The Tustrup House. The original house was located in the town of Tustrup on the peninsula of Djursland north of Aarhus. This house was probably used for religious ceremonies and perhaps for storing dead bodies until all that remained was bones, which could then be placed in a passage grave or stone barrow. The Prehistoric Trail ends back at the Manor, which nowadays houses the museum administration, Aarhus University offices and student facilities. There is no public access to these buildings. However just across the road is the last point of interest on The Prehistoric Trail, the reconstructed stave church from a town about 35 km to the north of Moesgaard.

It is one of the southernmost rivers on the western slope of the mountains, and drains a high, relatively dry plateau country of along the Sierra Crest. The upper South Fork flows through a series of rugged canyons, but it also drains a flat, marshy valley before joining the Kern River at Lake Isabella. Course It rises in the Inyo National Forest on the Tulare side of the Inyo County-Tulare County line, in a small meadow on the Sierra Crest near the Pacific Crest Trail. The river flows south through meadows and broad valleys, drawing very close to Golden Trout Creek, a tributary of the Kern River to the west. Much of the river's course south is just to the west of Owens Valley, which lies to the east at the base of the Sierra. The river then enters the Sequoia National Forest and receives Trout Creek from the right. Entering a gorge, the river courses through a -deep canyon before coming out of the mountains near Onyx. There it receives Canebrake Creek and turns southwest. The South Fork Kern then passes Weldon and the Kern River Preserve. As it nears Lake Isabella its fast waters slow and spread into extensive marshes. The river enters the reservoir at the end of a small delta. Its original confluence with the Kern is submerged under the lake, which is formed by Isabella Dam. History The valley of the lower South Fork Kern River was once inhabited by the Tübatulabal and Kawaiisu tribes. Humans have lived along the river for approximately 3,000 years. In 1834, Joseph R. Walker and his company of explorers surveyed along the river trying to find a low pass over the Sierra Nevada mountains. During their journey, they discovered Walker Pass, a mile above sea level, which lies at the headwaters of Canebrake Creek, a major tributary of the South Fork. Walker returned in 1843, leading an early party of emigrants over the Sierra by way of the pass. Gold strikes brought miners to the area in the 1850s and 1860s, and the first permanent settlements along the river were built in 1859. Conflicts ensued between the newcomers and the native inhabitants, and a U.S. Army outfit, Camp Leonard, was established on the river to provide military control over the area. River modifications Most of the river is free- flowing – with no dams and few diversions – with one exception. In 1953, the Isabella Dam was built on the Kern River near Bodfish by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, flooding the lower parts of the North Fork Kern (the main stem above Isabella) and the South Fork Kern under Isabella Lake to provide flood control and hydroelectric power. However, problems have developed with the dam's structure, creating a high risk of failure. A collapse of the dam, which could be caused by a quake on the Kern Canyon fault that lies directly under the structure, could inundate the city of Bakersfield within hours. In addition, the lower Kern, South Fork Kern and Canebrake Creek valleys provide an important transportation route. California State Route 178 runs through them, linking Bakersfield and Inyokern, which lie on opposite sides of the Sierra, via Walker Pass. SR178 is one of the few routes that cross this section of the mountain range. The road was first built in the 1890s. It was added to the California state highway system in 1919, and was paved in 1940.

It is native to eastern Asia. It grows from crevices in coastal cliffs, stream banks, rocky slopes, and other moist, stable areas. Description Sorus; diameter about 1.2 mm. (The reddish background is chlorophyll fluorescence.) This fern is a perennial plant with a large light brown rhizome. Cyrtomium falcatum has leaves exceeding in length made up of six to ten pairs of shiny bright green leaflets. Each leathery leaflet has a flat to wavy to slightly toothed margin and a netlike pattern of veining. The underside of each leaflet has sori beneath brown or black indusia. Cultivation Cyrtomium falcatum is a popular ornamental plant in temperate climate gardens (zones 7 to 10), and is also popular as a house plant. It is hardier than most ferns; it thrives in light shade to deep shade with average fern soil. It is easily and quickly propagated by spores, but it can also be propagated via rhizome division. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The fern has escaped from cultivation on other continents and has become established in the wild as an introduced species. It can now be found in much of Europe, North America, the Atlantic Islands, Australia, New Zealand, and South America.Olsen, Sue. Encyclopedia of Garden Ferns. 2007.

The trap uses a water seal to prevent air from the public sewer entering the property. In the days before individual plumbing fittings were separately trapped, the smell from the public sewer could permeate the house. Waste flows from the house through a U-bend in the trap. This means that there is always water in the pipe preventing the passage of anything from the other direction. The device is a large clay U-bend with an air-inlet/access point on the 'house' side. It is located below the ground level, but can be accessed through the air-inlet and sometimes a rodding hole. Blockage risk The Buchan trap will collect solids, sludge and waste that is not in suspension. In recent times, non-paper based wipes have posed a particular problem, according to most Water Authorities. The end result of these adverse conditions is a partial or complete blockage. The sewage/rainwater then backs up the pipe and exits from the lowest connected appliance (sink, bath, dish washer, washing machine, etc.). This can be a significant problem in multi-level dwellings (e.g. tenements) where those at the lowest level will receive all the waste waters from those above. They should be checked, and cleaned if required, on a recurring basis, such as annually. History The Buchan trap was devised in the 19th century to stop the flow of sewer gases also known as miasmas. It was believed that the disease cholera was an airborne infection, not waterborne. The Buchan trap is normally found in the bottom of manholes or drop-shafts. It normally denotes the end point of the domestic property's sewer before it joins the main public sewer.

He lives in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was signed by the Los Angeles Avengers as an undrafted free agent in 2008. He played college football at Arizona State and Nebraska. Although Keller's football career never took off on any significant professional level, he is still remembered by many college football fans for being the player with a lawsuit against EA Sports and the NCAA that ultimately resulted in the cancellation of the widely popular NCAA Football video game series after 17 consecutive years of successful release. Keller was also a member of the Oakland Raiders. Early years Keller attended San Ramon Valley High School in Danville, California and was a student and a letterman in football and basketball. In football, Keller was a three-year starter, twice named his team's Offensive M.V.P., was a two-time first team All-East Bay League selection, and was a two-time second team All- Contra Costa Times selection. He finished his senior season with 3,282 passing yards and 38 touchdowns. After his senior football season, Keller was invited to the California/Florida High School All-Star Football Game. In basketball, he was a four-year starter. Sam Keller graduated from San Ramon Valley High School in 2003. College career=Arizona State= Keller enrolled at Arizona State on a scholarship offer in 2003, as the ninth-ranked quarterback in the class. He played in six games as a true freshman, passing for 247 yards and a touchdown. His most extensive action was against UCLA, when he threw for 79 yards. In 2004, as a sophomore, Keller played backup to senior Andrew Walter. He played in only six games, but threw for 606 yards and five touchdowns with only one interception. Keller earned his first career start in the Sun Bowl against Purdue, leading a fourth-quarter comeback victory with 370 yards and three touchdowns. He earned the Sun Bowl Most Valuable Player Award. As a junior in 2005, Keller played well in his first four games of the season. He had 461 yards against LSU, followed up by 409 yards against Northwestern. He continued with 300-yard performances against USC and Oregon State. In his four games, he passed for 1,582 yards with a 145.78 quarterback efficiency rating. However, he suffered a season-ending hand injury shortly after the four-game stretch. He only started the next three games, but finished the season with 2,165 yards and 20 touchdowns. =Nebraska= After Rudy Carpenter established himself as a capable starter in Keller's absence, in 2006, Keller transferred from Arizona State to the University of Nebraska. Due to NCAA transfer rules, he was forced to sit out his senior season, but redshirted to save his year of eligibility. He was named the team's scout team offensive player of the year. In 2007, as a redshirt-senior, Keller finished the season with the Cornhuskers with 2,422 yards and 14 touchdowns in nine games. Keller also set a Nebraska career and single-season record by completing 63.1 percent of his passes, as well as passing yards per game in a single season and career (269.1). The team finished the season with a 5-7 record. Keller broke his collar bone in the ninth game against Texas and was replaced as the starter for the final three games of the season by Joe Ganz. He also briefly held the school record for passing yards in a single game (438 vs. Ball State), which Ganz later broke (510 vs. Kansas State). Keller's 2,422 yards was a career-high, along with his 10 interceptions. His 14 touchdowns was the lowest since his sophomore season, and his quarterback efficiency rating was a career-low 133.74. Professional career=National Football League= Keller was tried out by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers immediately following the 2008 NFL Draft after going undrafted, however they did not sign him. Then, in May 2008, the Oakland Raiders were said to have given him a tryout. On June 25, the Raiders waived quarterback Erik Meyer and signed Keller. He was then waived on July 24. Sam is now a sales representative for a wine and spirits company in Scottsdale, AZ. Lawsuit On May 6, 2009, Keller filed a lawsuit against EA Sports and the NCAA in an attempt to recover damages for the likenesses of college athletes being used in the NCAA Football and NCAA Basketball series. On July 31, 2013, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in California, ruled Electronic Arts was not protected by the First Amendment free speech in portraying the likeness of a college football player. After that ruling, Keller's attorney stated that next step would be to take aim against the NCAA. Personal Sam Keller was the ninth-rated quarterback in the nation coming in from high school. In College, Keller majored in interdisciplinary studies (political science and history). Keller's father, Mike (sports management consultant), and stepmother, Kimberly, live in Las Vegas, NV. His father was an All-American at Michigan for Bo Schembechler and a third-round draft choice of the Dallas Cowboys. Sam Keller has three sisters named Gabby (20), Jessica (37), Crystal (21), and a brother named Robby (25). His mother Melissa Coveney and stepfather Robert Coveney live in Danville, CA. Keller married his wife Hilary on February 23, 2016 in Tempe, AZ.

Development Originally developed as an escort fighter for early Strategic Air Command bombers such as the B-36, the B-47, and the B-50, the mission of the F-101 was changed to that of a \\"strategic fighter\\" with equal emphasis on bomber escort and nuclear weapons delivery. This change took place in late 1952, while the F-101A was still under development. At that time, small nuclear weapons suitable for high-speed external carriage did not exist. The MK 5 and MK 7 weapons were initially considered for use with the new F-101. However, the existing MK 5 bomb would have produced excessive drag and the MK 7, already deployed by F-84 units, was restricted to a maximum carriage speed of Mach 0.82, prohibiting full use of the high-speed performance of the Voodoo. Since use of the MK 7 did not represent a significant improvement over existing capabilities, a commission of representatives from the Air Force, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP), Sandia Corporation, and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was formed in August 1953 to consider a derivative of the MK 5 as the XW-5/F-101 Joint Project Group. Originally envisioned as a new streamlined casing for the W-5 payload, the new store allowed for the carriage of extra fuel, increasing the combat range of the F-101. The Air Force and the AEC allocated 8 million dollars toward the development of a combination weapons/fuel pod designed, developed, and produced by McDonnell Aircraft Company as the Model 96 store. Initially, the Model 96 store was to weigh between four and five tons and carry a W-5 fission warhead with a yield of about 80 kilotons. Ballistic testing of the pod began with the first drop of a Model 96 \\"shape\\" from a B-47 on March 6, 1954. However, the rapid development of compact thermonuclear weapons led to the W-5 being superseded by the W-15 warhead, based on a Los Alamos device nicknamed Zombie. Although somewhat larger and heavier than the W-5, the W-15 boasted a much greater yield of between 1 and 3 megatons. The resulting pod was 32 feet long, 42 inches in diameter, and had capacity for 703 gallons of fuel in addition to the 6,000-pound class W-15 warhead. The Model 96 store attached directly to the belly of the F-101A. A retractable ventral fin allowed the aircraft to rotate during takeoff. The gross takeoff weight of the F-101/Model 96 combination was just less than 50,000 pounds. Over 19,000 pounds of fuel would have been available in this configuration, giving a high-altitude combat radius of 1,287 nautical miles and a mission endurance of about five hours. To help contend with the extra weight, the F-101 had provision for dual droppable mainwheels that could be attached to the main landing gear. Flight testing of the Model 96 store mounted on the F-101A began in July 1955, using the tenth preproduction aircraft, 53-2427, to conduct the tests. However, stability problems due to interference effects between the aircraft and the large pod quickly became apparent. Besides experiencing heavy buffeting, the Voodoo also exhibited instability along the roll and yaw axes when carrying the Model 96 store. Considering to Voodoo's propensity for inertia coupling and for sensitivity to \\"pitch-up\\" at its cruising altitude, this represented a serious problem. Despite the sustained efforts of the McDonnell engineers, these problems were never entirely overcome. In May 1955, late in the development of the Model 96 store, the AEC approved a modified version of the Model 96 carrying the new, lighter W-27 thermonuclear warhead with a yield of 2 megatons. This configuration allowed for a 2,700 pound warhead along with 849 gallons of transferable fuel, and weighed just less than 10,000 pounds. However, the continuing problems with the Model 96/F-101 combination coupled with the rapid development of the MK 28 EX weapon resulted in the demise of the Model 96 program in March 1956.

Pythodoros became the first son-in-law of the Roman triumvir Mark Antony. In 36 BC, Pythodoros had married to one of Antony’s eldest children, his daughter Antonia.App. BC 5.93; for a brief discussion, see Gaius Stern, Women, Children, and Senators on the Ara Pacis Augustae, (Berk. diss. 2006), page 43 FN 12. Antonia was the daughter and only child from the triumvir’s second marriage to his paternal cousin Antonia Hybrida Minor. His wife was about 20 years younger than he was. The reason that Antony arranged for Pythodoros to marry his daughter was to hopefully gain some of Pythodoros’ wealth for his war chest in his campaign to invade Parthia. However, it is uncertain if Antony ever managed to do this. Pythodoros and his wife settled in Smyrna (modern İzmir, Turkey).

The supplies were originally transported down the Coosa River from Fort Armstrong. The regiment brought supplies to the area where Fort Williams would be built and were met there by Jackson. A fort was erected at this site on March 22, 1814 and named for Colonel Williams. The majority of Jackson's forces were garrisoned at Fort Williams prior to the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, and blazed a 52-mile trail from the fort to the battle site.Braund 2012, p. 147.

He went to an Institution in Tanta and was instructed in the science of Tafsir (exegesis), Qiraa'at (art of recitation) and Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence). After completing his formal studies, Sheikh Mustafa Ismail devoted his life to the service of the Quran. Notable moments His son Wahid Mustafa said: =Egyptian radio= The Qari who recited the Quran on Egypt radio became ill, Mustafa Ismail was given the opportunity to recite in his place. King Farouk of Egypt was listening in the audience. King Farouk enjoyed Shaykh Mustafa Ismail's recitation so much that he requested Sheikh Mustafa Ismail to recite Quran during the Islamic month of Ramadan for himself. He was now the King's Qari. By the 1940s he was recognized and respected by almost the whole of Egypt, one particular quality of note is that Sheikh Mustafa Ismail's personality never changed. Sheikh Mustafa Ismail recites at a Special Programme to celebrate the birth of the Prophet Mohammed was organised by a non-profit organisation. The programme was to be broadcast on Egypt's national radio station Egypt and was scheduled to be on-air for 30 minutes. Sheikh Abdul Fattah Shashi was to recite the Quran, unfortunately he couldn't attend due to illness, the organisers tried to find another Qari as good as Sheikh Abdul Fattah Shashi. The only Qari the organisers could find to recite in place of Sheikh Abdul Fattah Shashi was Sheikh Mustafa Ismail. Sheikh Mustafa Ismail was concerned of the 30 minute duration, Sheikh Mustafa Ismail was accustomed to recite for several hours at a time and now he would have to achieve the same quality recitation in only thirty minutes. In order to achieve this Sheikh Mustafa Ismail began practicing against the 30 minute limit. This marked a turning point in the life of Sheikh Mustafa Ismail of his life. =Visit to Turkey 1961 and 1969= Sheikh Mustafa Ismail arrived in Turkey in the year 1969, scheduled to stay in Ankara for 15 days, 15 days in Istanbul and then to visit the other major cities. Sheikh Mustafa Ismail wasn't very happy with his initial reception, especially the number of people in the audience. He decided to shorten his stay in Ankara and he set off for Istanbul. When he arrived in Istanbul, Sheikh Mustafa Ismail was mesmerized. The President of Turkey invited him to the Royal Palace and gave a golden lettered Quran, as a special gift. Sheikh Mustafa Ismail stayed in Turkey for the whole month of Ramadhan. In this month he developed a special connection with Turkey, he said that he loved the people of Turkey. He also said \\"the people of Turkey are very respectful towards the Quran and they are very quiet and respectful during recitations.\\" One member of the audience was Dr.Emin Isık from the University of Marmara. Dr. Emin Isık says \\"When we heard that he was going to recite in the Suleymaniye Mosque we rushed to listen to him. He recited the Quran for thirty minutes after the Taraweeh prayers. Unlike the people of Ankara, we had known Shaikh Mustafa Ismael very well. The mosque was completely full, Sheikh Mustafa Ismael said \\"I have travelled around the world but I have never seen anything like the audience of Istanbul.\\" He was very impressed and happy about the audiences love for the Quran and the beauty of the Mosque. According to his son Wahid, Shaykh Mustafa Ismael was delighted to be in Turkey. When they asked him \\"Would you recite Quran to us?\\" He never refused. Even when they asked him to recite Quran outside the Mosque, he never said no. Style Sheikh Mustafa Ismail had a unique style, he would recite the Quran in a particular fashion, employing the Arabic maqamat to illustrate the words of Allah to the listener. Dr. Ahmed Nuaina, an Egyptian Qur'an reader, once told noted composer Ammar El-Shereii: The composer Abdel-Wahab was of much the same opinion: \\"He was big in his art, he was big in his management of his voice, and was the only reciter who surprised listeners with unexpected maqam routes,\\" he once declared. In his Dream TV program two years ago, El-Shereii tried to analyze the sheikh's musical approach by replaying a few short recitations. \\"His recitation was miraculous, and he was a musical miracle as well. He was unique.\\" Analyzing a different verse, the composer says: Chronology * 1905 Mustafa Mohamed El-Mursi Ismail born on June 17 in Mit Ghazal, a Gharbeya governorate village. * 1911 The young Mostafa started learning the Qur'an in the kuttab of Sheikh Abdel Rahman Abul Einein * 1913 Mustafa moved to the kuttab of Sheikh Abdallah Shehata * 1915 The 10-year-old became a celebrity reciter in his village, as his voice started to draw listeners. * 1917 Ismail finished studying the art of tilawa and tajwid with Sheikh Idriss Fakher.

History  The division was first formed in September 1918 at Vladimir in the Moscow Military District. After reorganisation, probably as part of forming new divisions, the division was re-formed for the second time in August 1939 at Poltava in the Kiev Special Military District. In September–October, 1939 the division took part in the Soviet invasion of Poland (1939) as part of the 6th Rifle Corps, 6th Army, Ukrainian Front. From the Kiev Special MD it was sent to Finland around the middle of January 1940. The division arrived in Perk-yarvi (Перк-ярви) around the end of January or the start of February and moved to lake Mikkelin-yarvi. From 3 February 1940 it joined the 50th Rifle Corps, and advanced with the Corps from 13.02.1940 as part of the 7th Army. It was then shifted to the 10th Rifle Corps about 20 February 1940, on the Hotinen (Хотинен) direction. It was then shifted again, to the 34th Rifle Corps in February–March and awarded the Order of the Red Banner. Returned to the Kiev Special Military District in April 1940, it participated in the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in June–July 1940. In August 1940 it was reformed as the 7th Motorized Division. During the Soviet-Finnish campaign the division consisted of the 27th, 257th, and 300th Rifle Regiments, the 23rd Reconnaissance Battalion, and the 405th Separate Tank Battalion. Fighting as part of the 8th Mechanized Corps, 26th Army, Southwestern Front,Orbat.com/Niehorster from June 1941, the division was decimated in attempting to halt the German advance. It was engaged in the Lutsk-Rovno area soon after the German invasion began. The division was reformed on 27 December 1941 for the third time from remnants of the 22nd Estonian Territorial Rifle Corps. It was reformed at Sverdlovsk in the Ural MD in 1942, as an Estonian national formation, which later joined the 8th Estonian Rifle Corps of the Red Army. It took part in operations from 7 November 1942 as part of the 3rd, 1st Shock, 8th and 42nd Armies. Its first combat was the Battle of Velikiye Luki. On 1 December 1942 it was part of the 8th Rifle Corps, subordinated directly to the Kalinin Front alongside other Estonian formations.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 1 December 1942. On 22 September 1944 elements of the division, along with the 45th Estonian Tank Regiment and the 952nd SU Regiment (SU-76s), formed the forward detachment of 8th Rifle Corps and liberated Tallinn, for which all three units received the name of that city as a battle honor.Charles C.

Life and career Pessoa was born on January 24, 1878, at Umbuzeiro, Paraíba, Brazil. He enrolled at the Military Academy of Praia Vermelha in 1895, but dropped out before completing the course. He joined the Faculdade de Direito do Recife (Faculty of Law of Recife) in 1899, graduating in 1904. From 1909, he worked as a lawyer in Rio de Janeiro, in the Ministry of Finance and the Navy. In 1919, Epitácio Pessoa, João Pessoa's uncle, became President of Brazil, and João was made a minister of the Supremo Tribunal Militar (Supreme Military Court). In 1928, João Pessoa was elected governor of Paraíba, in which role he attempted to bring about reform of the state's political and administrative structure, and imposed taxes on trade conducted between Paraíba and the port of Recife. In the 1930 presidential elections, Pessoa refused to support the Republican candidate, Júlio Prestes, and accepted an invitation to become the running mate on the ticket of Getúlio Vargas. Prestes won the election, and one of his supporters, Colonel José Pereira Lima, led a revolt against Pessoa's state government, with the cooperation of the federal government. Pessoa responded by ordering raids on the homes and offices of suspected rebel sympathizers; during one such raid on the house of João Duarte Dantas, an ally of Pereira, police discovered intimate letters from Dantas' mistress, which were subsequently published in the state press. Death On July 26, 1930, Pessoa was on an official visit to Recife when he was shot and killed by an infuriated Dantas. The assassination stirred up a wave of bad feeling toward the federal government and the outgoing president Washington Luís, who was accused of bearing the \\"moral responsibility\\". Not long after Pessoa's death, Washington Luís was overthrown, and Getúlio Vargas installed as president. Legacy The state capital, formerly Parahyba, was renamed João Pessoa in September 1930. Pessoa is also commemorated in the Paraíba state flag, which features the word Nego (\\"I deny\\"), a reference to Pessoa's refusal to accept Júlio Prestes as president. The colors of the flag, red and black, symbolize the blood shed during the assassination and the period of mourning which followed.

He was born in a Slovene-speaking family in the village of Šalovci, in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, today in the Prekmurje region of Slovenia. His parents were Ferenc Bakos and Éva Ábraham. In 1779, he became a pastor in Surd, then part of the County of Somogy (now in Zala County). In the 17th and 18th centuries, numerous Slovene families from the Slovene March settled in Somogy. Many of them were Lutheran, and so Slovene-language services were set up for them. Bakos' predecessor was István Küzmics, a Slovene writer that translated the New Testament into his local Prekmurje dialect. Between 1784 and 1785, Bakos served as a pastor in Križevci (Hungarian Tótkeresztúr), in Prekmurje. He later returned to Somogy, where he served as the dean for Somogy and Zala counties. In 1791, he wrote the Slovene hymnal Krszcsánszke peszmene knige (Christian Hymnal). See also *Slovenes in Somogy *List of Slovene writers and poets in Hungary References * Anton Trstenjak. 2006.

This plant is native to the Iberian Peninsula. Description This is a tall shrub often exceeding in height. It is highly branched and sprawling. The sparse leaves are made up of small leaflets about a centimeter long each. The shrub bears yellow legume flowers and the pods are covered in white hairs. This shrub is similar to its relative, Cytisus scoparius, but it can be distinguished by the paler shade of yellow of its flowers and by the hairy coat on its pods. Invasive plant species It is also known in other parts of the world as an introduced species. It was introduced to California in the 1960s as an erosion-controlling plant, but it 'escaped' and spread to become a major noxious weed, an invasive species colonizing in many habitats there. It is also caused ecological damages in Oregon. This plant, beyond its native range, causes problems in many ways, including displacement of native species causing ecosystem degradation and loss, removing native plant food sources for wildlife, and a susceptibility to wildfire ignition and spread.

It can be produced by heating bromoethylamine hydrobromide or 2-aminoethyl hydrogen sulfate in the presence of sodium hydroxide (Gabriel method). It contains at least one three- membered ring which is very reactive because of the ring strain. It is used to inactivate the foot-and-mouth disease virus in vaccines for cattle, as well as other viruses and mycoplasma in blood samples. Contrary to early assumptions that ethylenimines only modified nucleic acids, it was found that trimeric ethylenimine also alters proteins in virus preparations, especially at higher pH values. The modification of the proteins affected viral particle uptake into cells. This should be taken into consideration when using BEI and other ethyleneimines as well. Safety BEI is very hazardous since it attacks nucleic acids and proteins as described above. It can be neutralised by sodium thiosulfate; the thiosulfate is a nucleophile which opens the three-membered ring. The presence of BEI can be tested for using silver nitrate solution.

Those customization abilities can be used by end-users to tailor the ISV's application within a managed extensibility environment just like Visual Basic for Applications. History Visual Studio Tools for Applications was announced by Microsoft with the release of Visual Studio 2005. The first Community Technology Preview (CTP) of Visual Studio for Application was released in April 2006. Version 1.0 was released to manufacturing along with Office 2007.VSTA RTM's with the 2007 Office System Visual Studio Tools for Applications 2.0 is the current version. The second version of Visual Studio Tools for Applications includes features such as the Dynamic Programming Model and support for WPF, WCF, WF, LINQ, and .NET Framework 3.5. VSTA is included with Microsoft Office 2007 for use by end-users and business application developers, and the SDK is available separately for ISVs. It is however integrated in Microsoft InfoPath only, as other applications in the suite use Visual Basic for Applications instead. Architecture Visual Studio Tools for Applications (VSTA) is based on the .NET Framework and is built on the same architecture as Visual Studio Tools for Office (VSTO). Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Applications is based on the .NET 2.0 framework and Visual Studio 2005, while Visual Studio Tools for Applications v 2.0 is based on the .NET 3.5 SP1 framework and Visual Studio 2008. Some of the technology developed for Visual Studio for Application (VSA) was incorporated within Visual Studio Tools for Applications. Visual Studio Tools for Applications consists of both a runtime and design time environment or IDE. The runtime is used by host applications to expose their object models to add-ins as well as discover and load add-ins. Add-ins have access to the host object model through a proxy which utilizes the VSTA runtime, or alternatively add-ins can directly reference the host application. The IDE is a streamlined and customizable version of the Visual Studio IDE- Visual Studio 2005 for VSTA 2005 and Visual Studio 2008 for VSTA 2.0. It supports Visual Basic .Net and C#. The IDE can be customized to add or hide functionality. This makes it ideal for professional developers as well as power users and other end users who may have a more macro recording oriented coding style. Visual Studio Tools for Applications also features 64-bit support and macro recording of the host application, but does not incorporate Active Scripting support. In order to integrate VSTA into a host application the SDK is needed, to distribute VSTA with an application a license and the VSTA distributable is required. Licensing VSTA 2008 integration licenses were distributed by Summit Software, which entered into a licensing agreement with Microsoft in April 2006. Independent software vendors (ISVs) wishing to integrate VSTA into their applications must pay a license fee to Summit Software that is calculated either on a $50 per-seat basis or on the basis of a 1%, 2% or 3% royalty depending on the products' revenue.

For his first team in the regional competition Ulmanis scored 60 out of the teams 78 goals and was called up to the flagman of Latvian football - Daugava Rīga. In his first game for Daugava - an international game against Polish GKS Katowice - Ulmanis scored 3 goals. He was popular among Latvian football fans for his \\"lazy\\" and relaxed playing manner which he was able to alter with unexpected outbursts of energy in form of shots on goal or passes to the center. His popularity was partly also connected with his last name Ulmanis (the same as former Latvian president Kārlis Ulmanis) which also brought him troubles with the Soviet authorities. He played for Daugava for almost his entire career - from 1955 until 1969, scoring many important goals and having been elected the team captain.

The whole valley of Egådalen - 1,5 km wide and 6 km long - was created as a tunnel valley at the end of the last ice age and holds numerous evidence of prehistoric human activities, from the Stone Age to present times. The Egå stream has its source at Geding Lake and from here it flows through the Geding-Kasted bog, the lake of Egå Engsø, the suburban area of Egå and the beach park of Åkrogen, before it terminates at the Bay of Aarhus.  The Egå suburb  The suburban area of Egå is located approximately 7 km north of the Aarhus city centre and is named after the Egå stream, that flows through the area. Egå originated as a rural village, probably in the Viking Age. A runestone, from c. 970–1020 in the late Viking Age, was discovered in 1814 and is on permanent exhibit in the National Museum of Denmark. Egå has merged with the city of Aarhus. The neighbourhood of Skæring north of central Egå has been merged administratively with Egå and it is in process of changing status to an urban area. Egå is one of the more affluent neighbourhoods, with some of the highest cost of land in the municipality. Egå is primarily a residential area with detached houses and no high-rises. The suburb houses a lively marina (Egå Marina), built in 1978, surrounded by the large beach park of Åkrogen. Egå Gymnasium was built in 2006.

It is the seat of the administrative district of Gmina Boguchwała. It was officially granted town status on 1 January 2008. The name of the town means \\"praise to God\\". Boguchwała lies approximately south-west of the regional capital Rzeszów. Its population is recorded as 5,712 (02.06.2009). History In the Middle Ages, the area of contemporary Boguchwała was located in western outskirts of Red Ruthenia, near the border with Lesser Poland. It frequently changed hands, to be finally annexed into the Kingdom of Poland, by King Kazimierz Wielki (1340). Near Boguchwała, boundaries of three lands met: Sanok Land, Przemyśl Land, and Sandomierz Land, which was later changed into Sandomierz Voivodeship. Boguchwała itself was part of Sanok Land. In 1375, Roman Catholic Diocese of Przemyśl was established, covering the lands of Sanok and Przemyśl. Its creation spurred the influx of Polish settlers into the mostly abandoned Carpathian foothills. As a result, several parishes were established in local villages. In late 16th century, several villages near Boguchwała became property of Castellan of Sandomierz, Mikolaj Spytek Ligeza, who was the owner of Rzeszów. The time of relative growth and prosperity ended in 1624, when a Crimean Tatar raid resulted in burning of a number of villages, and deaths of thousands of residents. In the early 18th century, the Great Northern War brought widespread destruction to Boguchwała and its area. In 1702, Rzeszów and its vicinity was occupied by Swedish forces, which plundered the town. In 1704, Swedes were replaced by Saxon troops, which also robbed local residents. Further destruction was brought in 1715–16, during civil war known as Tarnogrod Confederation. In 1724, Duke Teodor Lubomirski named Boguchwała main center of his estate, creating the so-called \\"Boguchwała State\\". Lubomirski wanted Boguchwała to compete with Rzeszów, and due to his efforts, the village received town charter in 1728, together with a new Rococo-style church. In 1772, after the first partition of Poland, the government of Austrian Galicia voided this decision and Boguchwała lost its town status. Before that happened, in early 1740s, Teodor Lubomirski expanded his manor house, turning it into a Baroque palace complex, with a spacious park. Boguchwała remained in the Habsburg Empire until late 1918. In 1895, the village received rail station, along the newly built line from Rzeszów to Jasło. In the Second Polish Republic, Boguchwała was part of Lwów Voivodeship. In spring of 1939, construction of the ZAPEL plant ended, part of the Central Industrial Region. The Wehrmacht entered Boguchwała on September 6, 1939. The village was an important outpost of the Home Army, and local AK unit took part in the Operation Tempest. Boguchwała recovered its town charter on January 1, 2008. Economy The town is a local centre of the electro-technical and energy industry with ZAPEL and Instytut Energetyki companies based in the town.

In pharmacology, the salt form of pamoic acid (pamoate ion) can be used as a counterion of a drug compound to affect the dissolution rate of the drug. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms enables significant hydrogen bonding to occur. Hydrogen bonds facilitate the dissolution of compounds in water. Pharmaceutical drugs formulated this way include cycloguanil pamoate, hydroxyzine pamoate, imipramine pamoate, olanzapine pamoate hydrate, oxantel pamoate, pyrantel pamoate, and pyrvinium pamoate.

He has been called the \\"father of British field botany\\". Life Johnson was born at Selby in Yorkshire between 1595 and 1600. He seems to have received a good education, and to have become an apothecary in London by 1626. Possibly before that he was living in Lincolnshire (Gerard, Herball, ed. 1633, p. 74). In 1629 he was in business on Snow Hill, city of London, where he had a physic-garden, and had become a prominent member of the Apothecaries' Company. On the outbreak of the civil war Johnson joined the royalists, and, partly for his learning, partly no doubt for his loyalty, was made a Bachelor of physic by the University of Oxford in 1642, and M.D. on 9 May 1643. Johnson took an active part in the defence of Basing House, becoming lieutenant-colonel to Sir Marmaduke Rawdon, the governor, and on 14 September 1644, during a skirmish with a detachment of Sir William Waller's troops under Colonel Richard Norton, he received a shot in the shoulder, \\"whereby contracting a feaver, he died a fortnight after\\" (Siege of Basing Castle, 1644).  Work  His first work was a short account of one of the herborising excursions which the company was in the habit of undertaking. This, the first local catalogue of plants published in England, was entitled \\"Iter Plantarum Investigationis ergo susceptum a decem Sociis in Agrum Cantianum, anno Dom. 1629, Julii 13\\" (London, 1629), and an appendix of three pages is headed \\"Ericetum Hamstedianum seu Plantarum ibi crescentium observatio habita anno eodem 1 Augusti.\\" Johnson seems (Herball, p. 450) to have been in Kent in 1626, and to have revisited both that county and Hampstead Heath, as in 1632 he published an enlarged edition of both lists. The plants are named in them according to Lobel, Dodoens, and Gerard. Anna Pavord provides an account of this expedition in her book, The Naming of Names following Gilmour's translation (Gilmour 1972), stating that he was inspired in his explorations by one of the first descriptions of botanical exploration, that of Ulisse Aldrovandi (1557). In 1633 Johnson published his most important work, The Herball, … gathered by John Gerarde, … very much enlarged and amended by Thomas Johnson, citizen and apothecary of London. So great had been the progress of botany in the thirty-six years since John Gerard's original publication (1597), that Johnson added over eight hundred new species to the list, and seven hundred figures, besides numerous corrections. The work, which contains about 2,850 descriptions, is commonly known by the name \\"Gerard emaculatus\\", given to it by Ray. Johnson seems, however, to have completed it in a year. It was reprinted in 1636 without alteration. Haller styles it \\"dignum opus, et totius rei herbariæ eo ævo notæ compendium\\". In 1634 Johnson published Mercurius Botanicus; sive Plantarum gratia suscepti itineris, anno 1634, descriptio, a description, in seventy-eight pages, of a twelve-day tour to Oxford, Bath, Bristol, Southampton, and the Isle of Wight, with English and Latin names of the plants observed. To this was added De Thermis Bathonicis … Tractatus, pp. 19, with plans of the baths. In 1641 he issued Mercurii Bot. pars altera, describing a visit to Wales and Snowdon, and the discovery of many new plants. In 1643 he published a translation of the surgical works of Ambroise Paré from the French, which was reprinted in 1678.  Legacy  Wood speaks of him as \\"the best herbalist of his age in England,\\" and as \\"no less eminent in the garrison for his valour and conduct as a soldier.\\" The minor botanical works of Johnson, which became very scarce, were collected and edited by T. S. Ralph in 1847, under the title of Opuscula omnia botanica Thomæ Johnsoni. Genera dedicated to his memory by Miller and by Adanson having become merged in the genera Callicarpa and Cedrela respectively, the name Johnsonia now belongs to a genus of Xanthorrhoeaceae named by Robert Brown.  Publications  * John Gerard's Herball, or general historie of plants first published in 1597 was enlarged by Thomas Johnson and published in 1633 and again in 1636.

It opened in July 1906 and closed to public use on 17 September 1932, although it remained open by special arrangement after that date until some time after 1956. It served Milton Range rifle range. The station was constructed on a low embankment to the south of the Thames and Medway Canal beyond Higham, where the line climbs at 1 in 215 and then falls in a short cutting at 1 in 267. Initially, an island platform was provided, but this was removed in 1914 to be replaced by wooden facing platforms. These were later rebuilt in concrete and survived beyond official closure to passenger traffic in 1932. At the eastern end of the platforms was a gated sleeper crossing which carried a public footpath over the line. Ostensibly provided to serve the adjoining rifle range, Milton Range Halt was more frequently used by platelayers and railway workmen who would unload tools and materials at this desolate spot. For many years there was a long engineer's siding behind the down platform. The station took on greater importance early in the First World War when around 200 soldiers travelled on weekdays to Milton Range Halt from on the 0750 service from , returning on the 1325 to , which had three extra third class carriages attached for the use of the soldiers. By May 1915, special calls at the halt were being made by six down and five up services when requested; the stationmaster was informed when special calls were to be made by down trains, whilst the stationmaster was responsible for up trains. These stations had to telephone Milton Range Halt every time that a train was to call, with three minutes being allowed for the stop. This arrangement remained in force for the duration of the war. The station was the site of an accident in August 1922 when a down passenger train held at the halt was struck from behind by another train, resulting in the death of five passengers. After the arrival of the 0540 workmen's train from Charing Cross to Strood at 0630, a number of workmen employed in the construction of the A2 road to the south alighted and crossed the line in front of the engine. They proceeded along the up line when they were struck in dense river fog by an up train, killing one workman and seriously injuring another. The accident caused the first train to be delayed at the halt where it was run into by the next workmen's special, timed to leave at 0555 and to arrive at Milton Range Halt ten minutes after the first train. The collision resulted in the death of a third workman and fatal injuries to two others. The driver of the second train was found to be primarily responsible for the accident by passing a signal without observing its position. The last remains of the derelict platforms survived until 2009. References.Sources   * External links * Subterranea Britannica * Kent Rail * Milton Range Halt station on navigable 1940 O.

The performer may be supported by one or both feet, which swivel in place during the pivot turn.Ann Hutchinson (2005) \\"Labanotation: The System of Analyzing and Recording Movement\\", , Chapter 8: \\"Turns\\", section \\"Pivot Turns In some dance genres, a pivot on both feet is called a twist turn. Pivot turns are commonly named as such in ballroom dancing, folk dancing and ethnic dances. In many other dance genres, pivot turns are known by specific names and typically are not referred to as pivots. For example, in ballet, a pirouette is a type of pivot turn on one foot. Ethnic dances A Native American pivot turn, as described by Bessie and May Evans (1931), is performed standing on the ball of one foot and tapping with the other foot, accompanied with small turns on the standing foot with each tap. The full turn requires about 16 taps. \\"Native American Dance Steps\\", by Bessie Evans, May Garrettson Evans, 2005: , first published by A. S. Barnes & Co., 1931. A Russian pivot turn, as described by Bessie and May Evans, is performed as follows. The right foot is placed flat and the left foot is placed with the toe by the right heel and the left heel raised and this relative position basically maintained during the turning. The turn starts with the right foot raised from the floor. While continuously revolving, on each strong beat (downbeat) the right foot is stepped flat and on each weak beat (upbeat) the left foot is stepped on the ball (by the right heel). Ballroom technique Various types of pivot turns are performed in ballroom dance, including slip pivot, reverse pivot, chains of pivot turns, half pivot (as in fourth step of a natural spin turn), man's first step of an outside spin, and man's third step (toe pivot) of a double reverse spin.The Ballroom Technique; Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing.

Located 4 km from the city centre of Aarhus, Åby was originally an old village, but is now an integrated a part of Åbyhøj, that sprawled around it. To distinguish Åby from Åbyhøj, the village area is often referred to as Gammel Åby (lit.:Old Åby). Åby is situated at a bend of the Aarhus River and there is access to the river and the pathway of Brabrandstien from here. Etymology The name Åby translates literally as river-town in modern Danish and it also derives from the Old Norse for \\"village on a river\\" (Old Norse á, river, and býr, village). Åby is identical in meaning with Aby in Lincolnshire in England. History The town of Åby is very old and grew from a port that used to be here in the Viking Age, when Aarhus Å was a fjord. Over the years, the fjord sanded up and transformed into the narrow waterway we now know as Aarhus River. The usual village charm and characteristics are still clearly visible in Åby, especially around the church.  Gallery  File:Gl. Aaby gadebillede 4.jpg File:Gl.

Lisbjerg has a population of 1,029 (1 January 2020).BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas The Mobile Statbank from Statistics Denmark Lisbjerg is situated on the northern slopes of the broad and flat valley of Egådalen, marking the northern limits of Aarhus. The village is cut through by the expressway of Randersvej, connecting the cities of Aarhus and Randers. East and northeast of the village lies the forest of Lisbjerg Skov and immediately north are the large camping grounds of Aarhus Camping and a large authentic Japanese garden. Lisbjerg Forbrændingen is an important incineration plant and hazardous waste treatment facility and works as a landmark for this area. Lisbjerg is an old settlement and boasts a 12th-century church, one of the oldest in Denmark, but there are also new residential quarters here and a large new residential area is under construction west of the old village center. The new quarter, known as Lisbjerg Bakke (Lisbjerg Hill), is built to accommodate 20-25,000 new residents when it is finished. Several houses, apartments and a school have already been built as of 2015 and in 2017, Aarhus light rail is intended to have its end station here. The old village church originally housed a Romanesque golden altar. The altar was removed from the church in 1867 and is now on display at the National Museum of Denmark.Jeppesen, Jens, and Hans Jørgen Madsen. \\"Trækirke og stormandshal i Lisbjerg.\\" Kuml 1995-96: 149-171. Print. Since 1989, Moesgaard Museum has been carrying out archaeological excavations around Lisbjerg church. They have found traces of an important late Viking Age farmstead in this area, possibly indicating continuity between the centers of importance before and after the introduction of Christianity in Denmark.Jeppesen, Jens. \\"Magnate Farms and Lordship from the Viking Age to the Medieval Period in Eastern Jutland: The Excavations at Lisbjerg and Haldum Churches.\\" Settlement and Lordship in Viking and Early Medieval Scandinavia.

Egådalen was once a brackish water fjord and the slopes of the valley have been populated since the earliest Stone Age.Excavation 12 - New Lystrup road The Archaeology beneath the Expressway (Moesgård Museum)  History = Church and Viking Age farmstead = Farmstead  The farm excavated at Lisbjerg shows traces of three building phases, indicating that it existed for a significant time period. The phases were dated based on the style of some long houses found in the farmstead. Similar houses have been found at Gammel Hviding and Vilslev as well as the closing phase of Vorbasse. Relying on these parallels, the houses at Lisbjerg were placed no earlier than the beginning of the 11th century and no later than about 1100.Jeppesen, Jens, and Hans Jørgen Madsen. \\"Stormandsgård og kirke i Lisbjerg.\\" Kuml 1988-89: 289-310. Print. A semi- spherical ceramic vessel type common in all phases of the farm was previously thought to have fallen out of use around 1000, but the long houses found at Lisbjerg are clearly a later development than Trelleborg-type houses of the late 10th century. The farmstead thus dates from the 11th century, which indicates that semi-spherical vessels remained in use after the year 1000 in Jutland. In all three phases, the farm was at least partially surrounded by a fence. Relatively light in the earliest phase, by the latest it had developed into a substantial palisade surrounding a roughly rectangular patch of land of about 170 by 110 meters. In addition to fences surrounding the farm area, a smaller one was found near the center of the farmstead. Owing to similarities with the palisade from the third phase, it is placed in the same time period. This fence would have partially surrounded the main farmhouse, traces of which have been found under the present stone church. The area inside this fence might be the \\"sheltered yard\\", a particular part of a farmstead which has special status in medieval law.Jeppesen, Jens. \\"Stormandsgården ved Lisbjerg kirke.\\" Kuml 2004: 161-180. Print. Two waste pits found from the farmstead area contained iron slag, while West Slav pottery highly popular in the Viking Age was found from a third. Yet another pit contained waste from metal crafts as well as glass of Roman and Byzantine origin.  Connection between farmstead and church  Golden altar from Lisbjerg stone church at the National Museum of Denmark Under Lisbjerg stone church, remains of an earlier wooden church have been found in addition to the main farmhouse. The wooden church must have existed after the farmhouse, but before the 12th century stone church, which places it around the year 1100. The wooden church might have been located inside the farmstead after the removal of the main house. However, it is more likely that the wooden church was built only after the farmstead was demolished, as its orientation is different from the orientation of the fence surrounding the farmstead. In either case, their proximity in time implies a connection between the church and the farmstead. It is likely that the farm owner was involved in building the church.  Influence and importance  The particular importance of the Lisbjerg farm is emphasized by its large area and the strength of the surrounding palisade. Its isolated location on the east side of the important old road to Aarhus is also suitable for property belonging to a magnate or nobleman. Artifacts implying a contemporary village west of the road have been found. Moesgaard Museum has also found traces of a moat running across the road from Lisbjerg to Aarhus, which would have forced travelers to cross the stream of Egå just south of the village. The moat may have been used as a traffic control measure. It has not been dated, but a connection between the moat and the magnate farm at Lisbjerg is possible. The farm may have had an important administrative function because the settlement at Lisbjerg has given its name to Lisbjerg herred, a division which already existed by the end of the 11th century. As the Lisbjerg settlement is located in the south-western part of the herred and far from its geographical center, it must have been all the more important in order to assume a central administrative role. If the farm owner at Lisbjerg was indeed powerful enough to hold authority over the whole herred, he would have been an obvious candidate for building a church upon the introduction of Christianity. In general, placing the church on the site of an important farm can be associated with the continuity of power in the area. It is also possible that continuity of tradition or cult practices played a role, as pagan rituals may have been carried out at main houses of important farms during the Viking Age.Olsen, Olaf. \\"Hørg, hov og kirke.\\" Aarbøger for Nordisk Oldkyndighed og Historie 1965: 100ff., 182ff. Print. The farmstead was perhaps even a royal estate, given its location close to Aarhus, an important center of royal power. Upon the founding of the Diocese of Aarhus around 1060, the farm may have been donated to the church, perhaps becoming the bishop’s residence. This is supported by a written source from 1604 claiming that \\"Aarhus was moved in 1102 from Lisbjerg to the place where it now lies\\". If the statement is interpreted as referring to the relocation of the bishop’s residence to Aarhus, it would be reasonable to expect that the farmstead at Lisbjerg had become the bishop’s estate by 1102. = Bronze Age hoard = Lisbjerg area has also produced archaeological finds from the Bronze Age. In August 1933, a Late Bronze Age hoard was found in a gravel pit east of Nymølle farm near Lisbjerg. It includes three hanging vessels, five fibulas, a belt ornament, an awl, two casting jets and a piece of casting waste. The find has been dated to 1000-900 BC. It is significant as one of few Late Bronze Age hoards in the Aarhus area. Furthermore, the hoard contains equipment from at least three different women, which is very rare in all of Denmark.Frost, Lise. \\"Et depotfund fra yngre bronzealder.\\" Kuml 2010: 9-47. Print.

It was established in 1973 following the charter, statutes and regulations of the governing body of the college as a representative body for UCC students. Each UCC student is automatically a member by virtue of a student levy. The UCC Students' Union (UCCSU) oversees the running of several committees (a media executive, societies guild executive and clubs executive) that cover a number of extra curricular activities for students in UCC. The Student Council of the UCCSU also acts as the student parliament for UCC, and represents students on a number of committees including UCC's Governing Authority, Academic Council, and externally at national bodies such as the Union of Students in Ireland. History The UCC Students' Union was established in 1973 to \\"represent and support their members at every level within the university\\". The union replaced a previous body known as the 'Students' Representative Council'. This body (known in Irish as Comhairle Teachta na Mac Léinn CTM) was established around 1908. In its early years, all officers of the body served in a voluntary capacity. The first full-time officer came with the introduction of a paid presidency role in 1940, and increased to four full-time officers in 2004. The Pride flag flown atop the UCC Students' Union building Since 2010, UCCSU has awarded Honorary Life Memberships, to \\"individuals that have demonstrated commitment to working in the best interests of students both within the University and externally\\". On 5 December 5, 2014, UCC Students' Union became the first third-level institution on the island of Ireland to install a permanent Pride flag on campus. Publications Publications by the UCCSU include union handbooks, the twice weekly union newspaper, and monthly magazine. Since 2004 the campus newspaper has been known as the 'UCC Express'. The newspaper had been known over previous years variously as: 'Aire', 'The Gazette', 'The University Examiner', 'The Campus Chronicle', and 'The University Xpress'. The union also publishes the monthly 'Motley Magazine', which was named 'KBC Irish Student Magazine of the Year' in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Organisation and services As of 2015, there are six full-time sabbatical officers (President, Campaigns Officer/Deputy President, VP Education, VP Welfare, VP Commercial and Communications & Entertainment Officer) and a number of voluntary or non- sabbatical positions, which are elected each year by students. The union also has six 'rights officers' (LGBT*Q, Gender Equality, International, Mature Students, Suicide Awareness and Mental Health (SÁMH) & Disability) whose roles are to advise on the issues pertaining to students under their remit. UCCSU also provides other services to students – a jobs portal, education advice and grinds, welfare advice, free condoms, and a second-hand bookshop. It is also involved in charity and fundraising, advocacy and community relations, and campaigning on other issues.

History  Sabro was originally one of the smaller villages in the area, with a few houses and farms south and west of Sabro Church. After the road between Aarhus and Viborg (today Primærrute 26) was built through the area around 1890, a small settlement developed at the crossroads about from the original village. In the mid-20th century the sogn (parish) councils of Borum-Lyngby, Lading and Sabro-Fårup (of which Sabro was part until 1 April 1970) decided to make this the location of a central school, Sabro Korsvejskolen (Sabro Crossroads School), which was dedicated in 1964. In the 1970s and 1980s the crossroads settlement and the original village merged, as part of a strong urban growth which has since continued eastwards, covering former agricultural land in the direction of the neighbouring village of Mundelstrup.

With his partner John Gaff Gillespie developed an attenuated high-rise style for the office buildings of the fin de siecle cities. One of his most famous buildings is the category-A listed \\"The Hatrack\\" (1899–1902) in St Vincent Street, a heavily glass-fronted Art Nouveau tower, remarkable in execution for its day. This building was only recently rescued from demolition. Salmon was born in Glasgow, the son of architect William Forrest Salmon (1843–1911) and Jessie Alexander, and grandson of architect James Salmon (1805–1888). He was educated at Glasgow High School from 1883 to 1888, when he joined the architecture practice his grandfather had established in 1830. James senior had died that year, leaving William in charge. James junior attended classes at Glasgow School of Art from 1888 until 1895, and completed his apprenticeship in the office of William Leiper (1839–1916). On completion of his articles he undertook a grand tour, taking in France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Belgium, Holland, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Greece and Spain. Some works include: * Rowantreehill in Kilmacolm (1898) (tudor, art nouveau) * chauffeur's house in Gallowshill (1903) * Miyanoshta in Kilmacolm (1905) (romantic, art nouveau) * Lion Chambers in Glasgow (1905) * Den o' Gryffe (c.1903) (art nouveau) * Hazelhope in Kilmacolm (c.1900) (tudor, art nouveau) * Northernhay in Kilmacolm (1906) (modernism) * Nether Knockbuckle in Kilmacolm (c.1910) In 1895 Salmon rejoined the family firm, where John Gaff Gillespie (1870–1926) was now a partner. He worked on designs for the Mercantile Chambers in Bothwell Street, and was himself made a partner in 1898. In that same year he designed his first villa for his father. In November 1903 the firm was renamed Salmon Son & Gillespie. He continued to undertake study tours to Europe, and was admitted as a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) in 1906. Salmon's designs were largely in the Glasgow Style of art nouveau, influenced by the sculptors he had met at Glasgow School of Art, and by the architecture of the arts and crafts movement. In 1904-5 Salmon was responsible for the Lion Chambers on Hope Street, an early example of reinforced concrete construction. William Forrest Salmon died in 1911, leaving his share of the partnership to his second wife Agnes, James Salmon's stepmother. Gillespie bought out Agnes' interest, becoming senior partner, and later taking on William Kidd (1879–1929) to form the basis of the modernist practice Gillespie, Kidd & Coia. Salmon left the practice in 1913, retaining a commission for the Admiralty Village at Greenock, and setting up on his own as James Salmon & Son. When the First World War broke out, this connection brought further commissions, although he had little other work after the split. After the war, he concentrated on domestic and hospital work. In 1923 he retired due to bowel cancer, and died the following April.

History  Tranbjerg was formerly a small rural village but is now a suburb of Aarhus about 10 kilometers south of the city center. Tranbjerg Church is a typical old Danish village church, built in the later part of the 1100s, but with several later adjustments and additions. It is dedicated to Saint Ursula and the eleven thousand handmaidens. In 1737, King Christian VI gave charter to the Tranbjerg parish for the public school of Tranbjerg Skole. The school was placed right next to the church, but newer and larger schoolbuildings were erected elsewhere in the 1970s. In 2013, Tranbjerg Skole and Grønløkkeskolen - another local public school - merged to form the Tranbjergskolen public school. Tranbjerg has a relatively extant center known as Center Syd (Center South). It developed in the later part of the 1800s, after Tranbjerg trainstation was built in 1884. The trainstation transformed the village to a railway town, attracting industry and improving the trade options for local farmers. Tranbjerg Kro was built in 1885. The trainsstation was rebuilt and modernised in 1993. Tranbjerg Brugsforening, a local cooperative retailer, opened in 1918 as the cooperative idea flourished and took hold in Denmark. Kvickly Tranbjerg is built on the site of the former Tranbjerg Brugsforening headquarters. The local sports association of AIA- Tranbjerg was also initiated in 1918 as a local department of the larger AIA (Arbejdernes Idrætsklub, Aarhus). Football has played a prominent role in the history of AIA-Tranbjerg. In 1970, Tranbjerg became part of Aarhus Municipality.

Frederiksbjerg is part of the postal district Aarhus C and is located just south of the historical city centre, separated from it by a broad railway yard and connected by three bridges. Despite being part of the inner city, Frederiksbjerg has its own charm and character and express some of the first large scale attempts to plan the development of Aarhus as a city. With around 20,000 inhabitants, it is basically a residential area, but with three large shopping streets; Bruunsgade, Jægergårdsgade, and Frederiks Allé.  History  Frederiksbjerg was annexed by Aarhus in 1874, when the city limits was moved south from the railway yard. The city was at bursting point for expansion, due to the accelerating industrialization and population growth, and new building sites were desperately needed. From 1870-75 Frederiksbjergs population rose from just 300 to 2000 citizens and with the building of the new bridge of Bruuns Bro, the admission accelerated further. This development inspired the City Council to adopt a strategy of large scale city planning, something hitherto unheard of in Aarhus and Denmark in general. Several plans was proposed and worked out, but the architect Hack Kampmann and city engineer to Copenhagen Charles Ambt's innovative plan from 1898, ended up as the most influential. Frederiksbjerg was soon fully developed and populated thereafter.  Gallery  Aarhus skyline 03.jpgSkyline Hallssti (efterår).jpgHallssti.

He played a major role in financing the construction of major Roman Catholic infrastructure in Singapore, Bangkok and China, which is still in use today.  Life  \\"Jacob\\" Low as mentioned by his son in this commemoration plaque at the former Saint Joseph's Institution, now the Singapore Art Museum. Jacob Low was born in the South Chinese Guangdong province coastal town of Shantou (formerly Swatow) in 1843 in a Teochew family. Due to financial difficulties his family sent 2 sons to Singapore in search of work. Low, arriving in Singapore as a 16-year-old in 1859, had originally worked as a cook, and later as a clerical assistant at the French Roman Catholic religious order Missions Étrangères de Paris (MEP) headquarters in Oxley Road, Singapore, from the 1850s. It was during his employ as a young man that the residing parish priest Fr Patria recognised promise in Low and advised the young man to relocate to Bangkok in Siam to start up a business venture. According to family sources the Roman Catholic Church extended a generous loan to Low in order for him to see the plan through. By 1872, Low established the retail/import-export firm Kiam Hoa Heng along the east bank of the Chao Phraya river in Bangkok. He did so with a childhood friend and now business partner Mr. Joseph Chan Teck Hee (1845–1930). It was from their import-export business based in Bangkok, Kiam Hoa Heng and in 1883 Buan Hoa Seng in Singapore were set up. The Singapore side of this operation was overseen by Mr. John Goh Ah Seng (1851–1916).Business Directory of the Straits Settlements and Singapore', 1903' In the 1880s, Kiam Hoa Heng received royal Siamese patronage from King Chulalongkorn himself. The story goes that one day a man walked into his shop with an entourage of people. No one knew who he was but one employee did recognise this person as the King. Low was at the local church for his daily afternoon prays and so missed this visit. After the visit the owner was invited to the royal palace to receive a plaque signifying royal patronage. According to the Miramar shipping index website, Low commissioned a 1,100 ton powered ship, the 'Ban Hong Liong' in 1906.http://www.miramarshipindex.org.nz/ship/list?search_op=OR&IDNo;=23728 The ship was later sold and played a prominent role as a transport and logistics ship for British forces during the second World War.http://www.australiansatwar.gov.au/stories/stories.asp?war=W2&id;=71 Low Kiok Chiang died on the 12 March 1911 from complications arising from blood poisoning due to an infection. His body was transported via steam ship from Bangkok to Singapore for burial. He was buried in a cemetery behind Singapore's Presidential Istana (Palace) which was exhumed in 1970 to make way for a park. His marble tombstone and body are now interned at the Choa Chu Kang Cemetery in Singapore. By the second decade of the 20th century, the Low family network began linking up with other prominent Roman Catholic Chinese philanthropist families such as the Wee (Ng) family, headed by David Wee Cheng Soon (1875–1944), who contributed heavily to the construction of the Church of St Theresa in 1929 (Singapore), the St Anthony's Church in 1927 (Singapore) and other Roman Catholic infrastructure such as the school hall of St Joseph's Institution in 1911 (see photo). Wee ran a large construction company based in Stamford Road, Singapore city. Wee's company also constructed the Majestic Hotel (1932) now the National Art Gallery in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Singapore's first airport runway at the former Kallang Airport. Immediate descendants live in Singapore, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, Italy and the UK.  Contributing to Roman Catholic expansion in Singapore, Bangkok and China  Assumption Cathedral, Bangkok After having attained financial success, Jacobe Low donated large amounts of capital needed for the construction of local Chinese parishes and mission schools in Singapore, Bangkok and in Swatow China, especially between the mid-1890s to 1910. There is, however, no evidence to show if the Roman Catholic Church had a direct say in the use of Mr. Low’s business profits. From interviews with descendants in the 1970s and 1980s, it appears the reasons for doing so were totally personal. This wealthy patronage did not go unnoticed by some in the rival Protestant churches. Rev. J. A. Bethune Cook accused the Roman Catholic Church in 1907 of conducting ‘ordinary business houses in the name of Chinese traders and others.’Rev. J. A. Bethune Cook, 'Sunny Singapore: An Account of the Place and its People with a Sketch of the Results of Missionary Work', London: Elliot Stock, 1907, p. 134 Much of Low's contributions were directed to the Catholic Church and its various instruments. In the late 19th century, Low single-handedly paid for restoration of damaged roofs at the Convent of the Holy Infant Jesus in the Singapore city precinct. His family and firm contributed several thousand dollars to Singapore's St Joseph's Institution. Kiam Hoa Heng also paid for refurbishments in the form of three large stained glass windows behind the altar, at the St Peter and Pauls Church in Queen Street, Singapore. In addition to this he gave large tracts of land and city- based properties to the Catholic Church in Bangkok. Around 1902, he paid for the construction of a church in his birthplace Shantou (formerly Swatow), in China, and during the Churches recent centennial celebrations, descendants of the Low family from London, Singapore and Bangkok were invited to the celebration there. The largest project funded by Low was the grand French Romanesque-revivalist Bangkok Roman Catholic Assumption Cathedral which still stands today. According to his daughter Veronica Low (b. April 1888 d. 4 Jan 1976), he was the primary financial sponsor to this Church, to a point where members of the Low family took on large cuts to their financial allowances. The Cathedral was completed in 1909.http://www.tour-bangkok- legacies.com/assumption-cathedral.html His last project was the modest Church of the Sacred Heart in Tank Road, Singapore completed in 1910, one year before his death.

Ludwig's father, a German-born industrialist named Karl Gustav Adolf Martens, was the owner of a steel mill in Kursk, Russia. There were five sons and two daughters in the family. Two of them, Ludwig and Olga, became professional revolutionaries.Biography of Martens In 1893 Martens graduated from a Kursk Realschule and entered Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology, from which he graduated to become a mechanical engineer.\\"Consul of Russian Republic Her to Open Trade With U.S.; Authorized to Spend $200,000,000,\\" New York Call, vol. 12, no. 80 (March 21, 1919), pp. 1-2. =Political career= While at the State Institute of Technology, Martens became acquainted with Vladimir Lenin and Julius Martov. Soon he became a member of their illegal Marxist group League of Struggle for the Emancipation of the Working Class. In 1896 he was arrested, and in 1899 as a German national was deported to Germany where he became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. In 1902 he graduated from the Technical College of Charlottenburg. In 1906, following the failure of the 1905 Russian Revolution, Martens emigrated to Great Britain. In emigration Martens worked as a procurement agent for the Demidov Iron and Steel Works, purchasing machinery for the large industrial works, one of the largest steel works in Russia. In 1915, with the onset of World War I, the Kursk steel mill owned by Martens' family was confiscated by the Russian government because the Martens family were considered German nationals. In 1916 Martens emigrated to the United States where he worked as a vice president of the engineering firm Weinberg & Posner (New York City). In 1917, after the February Revolution, Martens - together with Leon Trotsky and 278 other Russian Social Democrats - returned from the United States to Russia on a steamship. In March 1919 Martens returned to the United States and founded the Russian Soviet Government Bureau, an informal embassy of Soviet Russia. He established commercial contacts (formally illegal as the USA boycotted Soviet Russia at the time) with more than one thousand American firms including such as Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of J. P. Morgan. He negotiated a loan with the then Irish Emissary to the United States, T.D. Harry Boland, using Russian jewels as security. In June 1919 the Bureau was searched by police. In response to charges by the United States Department of Justice, Martens stated in Washington, D.C., on January 10, 1920, that he had done nothing to justify being deported. “My activities in the United States have been entirely friendly and along commercial lines,” he said.United Press, “Soviet Leader Denies He Can Be Deported,” Riverside Daily Press, Riverside, California, Saturday 10 January 1920, Volume XXXV, Number 9, page 1. After hearings in the United States Senate and the United States Department of Labor, Martens was finally deported to Soviet Russia in January 1921. =Return to Russia= After returning to Russia, Martens became a member of the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy and the Chairman of Glavmetal (a state organization holding all the metallurgical enterprises of Soviet Russia). On that position Martens started works on developing the Kursk Magnetic Anomaly, the largest iron ore deposits in Russia. In 1924−26 Martens worked as the first Chairman of the Committee on Invention of the Supreme Soviet of the National Economy (Комитет по делам Изобретений; the Soviet counterpart of a Western Patent Office). In 1925 he published a monograph, On the vibration of piston engines. Martens engine In 1926−36 Martens worked as the Head of the Research and Development Institutes for Diesel Manufacturing (Научно-Исследовательский Институт Дизелестроения) in Leningrad. He was the author of the N-2 diesel (also known as the Martens Engine) intended as an aviation engine. The novel element of the diesel was that the 12-cylinder piston engine was aspired by a 6-cylinder piston air compressor. The diesel was tested in 1932.Авиационные Дизели, Или Тернистый Путь А.Д.

After some experiments it was adopted by the pdfTeX team as a successor to pdfTeX (itself an extension of eTeX, which generates PDFs).TeX Frequently Asked Questions - What is PDFTeX?TeX Frequently Asked Questions - PDFTeX and LuaTeXPDFTeX's NEWS file - news for 3.141592-1.40.0 version. Later in the project some functionality of was included (esp. multi-directional typesetting). The project was originally sponsored by the Oriental TeX project, founded by Idris Samawi Hamid, Hans Hagen, and Taco Hoekwater. Objective of the project The main objective of the project is to provide a version of TeX where all internals are accessible from Lua. In the process of opening up TeX much of the internal code is rewritten. Instead of hard coding new features in TeX itself, users (or macro package writers) can write their own extensions. LuaTeX offers support for OpenType fonts with external modules. One of them, written in Lua, is provided by the LuaTeX team, but support for complex scripts is limited; there is work in progress (as of 2019) to integrate HarfBuzz. A related project is MPLib (an extended MetaPost library module), which brings a graphics engine into TeX. The LuaTeX team consists of Luigi Scarso, Taco Hoekwater, Hartmut Henkel and Hans Hagen. Versions The first public beta was launched at TUG 2007 in San Diego. The first formal release was planned for the end of 2009, and the first stable production version was released in 2010.LuaTeX roadmap Version 1.00 was released in September 2016 during ConTeXt 2016. , both ConTeXt mark IV and LaTeX with extra packages (e.g. luaotfload, luamplib, luatexbase, luatextra) make use of new LuaTeX features. Both are supported in TeX Live 2010 with LuaTeX 0.60, and in LyX. Special support in plain TeX is still under development.
