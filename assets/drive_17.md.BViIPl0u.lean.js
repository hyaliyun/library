It was originally published by Momentum Press in 1980 and was re-published in 1986 and 2009.Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press. 1980. Print. Copyright Page. The book is divided into four sections, and draws inspiration from the events of the Vietnam War era and Ostriker's personal experiences with motherhood. In the work, Ostriker juxtaposes meditations on war against musings of motherhood and the experience of birth. The many verses and prose pieces that comprise the book contrasts a woman's roles as teacher, mother, and wife, with the violence, corruption, and death of war. Background Ostriker began composing The Mother/Child Papers after the birth of her son, a few days following the shooting of four students at Kent State.http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~ostriker/home.htm In the work, Ostriker chronicles her fears of bringing a son into the brutal modern world with so many expectations and pre-constructed notions of what makes a great man, especially during wartime. The title of the work similarly emphasizes its historic position by echoing The Pentagon Papers.Prins, Yopie, and Maeera Shreiber. Dwelling in Possibility: Women Poets and Critics on Poetry. Ithaca, NY: Cornell UP, 1997. Print. The Mother/Child Papers explores such topics as women's strengths, the joys and frustration of parenthood, shock and outrage over war, and the destruction of the natural environment, and challenges typical notions of mother-child relationships, female experience, and sexual perceptions of women.  Summary   I: Cambodia  The books begins with a lengthy prose section in which Ostriker recalls the events of her son, Gabriel's, May 14, 1970 birth and relates it to political developments that occurred around that time, most notably the Kent State Shootings and the beginning of Operation Total Victory, the United States invasion of Cambodia. The three events are described in tandem, with each intertwined with the others. Ostriker then tells of the births of her two older daughters. One was delivered in a progressive Wisconsin hospital and another by midwife in England. Ostriker says that these two experiences shaped her expectation of what childbirth should be like: “a woman gives birth to a child, and the medical folk assist her.”Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 4. Ostriker then speaks of the birth of her third child, Gabriel, at a southern California traditional hospital. Despite having reached an agreement with her doctor about what drugs she was to be given during the procedure, while in the early stages of labor Ostriker inadvertently consented to being injected with Demerol, a sedative, thinking it was a local analgesic. Under the effects of the Demerol, Ostriker then consented to receive a spinal anesthetic, which left her unable to feel anything from the waist down. Upon waking, Ostriker was furious about being deprived of the experience of natural childbirth and relates the invasion of her body by the medical professionals who delivered the child to the US invasion of Cambodia.  II: Mother/Child  The second section of the book is a series of related, untitled stream-of-consciousness poems alternating between the new mother and the child's perspective. In these sections, Ostriker explores the intimate, even erotic, relationship between a mother and her infant child. She expresses the different emotions she experienced towards the child during this time, from blissful admiration and boundless optimism, to bitter resentment and a wish that the “leech” would “die”.Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 22. There are also a number of short prose sections in which Ostriker relates the events of the Kent State shooting and the immediate aftermath of Gabriel's birth. References to war and devastation pervade both accounts; as Ostriker muses on the beauty of her child, she suddenly thinks of “babies stabbed in their little bellies / and hoisted up to the sky on bayonets”.Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 18. The section ends with two titled pieces: “Paragraphs,” a prose piece in which Ostriker examines the range of emotions new mothers feel towards their infants, ranging from almost divine love to murderous rage, and “Mother/Child: A Coda,” in which she dispenses advice about life and consciousness to her child, alerting him to its savage, brutal nature, as well as its potential for transcendent beauty.  III: The Spaces  The third part of the book is the longest and is composed of a series of 16 titled prose and poetry pieces exploring life with the new child and its effects on the family. In “Letter to M.” the speaker discusses the erotic pleasure inherent in nursing a child and ponders why this is never discussed in any parenting material. The poem “Song of the Abandoned One” is written from the perspective of the infant's jealous and angry older sibling, begging her parents to “Kill the baby”.Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 34. Ostriker recounts an experience with her family listening to a production of Shakespeare’s Macbeth on the radio in “Macbeth and the Kids In the Cabin at Chester.” In “Things to Remember of Eve,” Ostriker describes her daughter, Eve Ostriker, at two different stages in her life, at ages 8 and 21. In “In the Autumn of My Thirty-Seventh Birthday,” Ostriker describes the sense of emptiness and depression she experienced dealing with family life, recounting also a discussion with a depressed friend, N., who refuses to take the antidepressants her psychiatrist prescribed her. In “Exile,” Ostriker considers the contrasting powers of love and violence, wondering when her son will grow to the point where “he will turn away” from his mother's kisses “not to waste breath.” The poem's post-script reads, “during the evacuation of Phnom Penh, 1975.” Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 40. In the section's titular prose piece, “The Spaces,” Ostriker recalls an ideal “windy, snowy January evening” at home with her children.Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 41. Throughout the poem, there are a number of allusions to William Blake’s Songs of Innocence, as well as a repeated lamb motif. Ostriker’s perfect winter day with her children is contrasted with her husband’s discussion about entropy and the ultimate heat death of the universe. The next poem, “Propaganda Poem: Maybe For Some Young Mamas” is divided into three parts. In the first part, “The Visiting Poet,” Ostriker recounts an experience she once had giving a guest lecture to a class of feminist college students. She read the class a poem about pregnancy and was shocked when the class reacted with revulsion to the notion of motherhood. Ostriker tries to explain that motherhood is one of the most fulfilling and empowering experiences possible for a woman to experience and that the class has been thoroughly brainwashed against it through patriarchal messages. In part two, “Postscript to Propaganda,” Ostriker acknowledges that raising children is an incredibly difficult and demanding experience which wears a mother down, but she concludes the poem by asking the audience, “Come on, you daughters of bitches, do you want to live forever?”Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 47. The poem's last part, “What Actually,” indicts the “ideological lockstep” that Ostriker claims dictates women's feelings on motherhood.Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 48. She goes on to explain that she believes that certain women are born to be mothers, while others simply were not. She concludes by once more acknowledging that although raising children wears away at a person, so does anything enjoyable in life, and that those who refuse to do anything dangerous are “already dead.”Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 49. In “The Leaf Pile,” Ostriker recounts the events of an October day when, upon catching her son trying to put something dirty in his mouth, she slapped him. The poem explores the workings of memory and how such events can be easily forgotten by the child but remain a vivid mark of shame for the parent. The next work is a prose piece titled “The Seven Samurai, The Dolly, and Mary Cassatt.” Ostriker remembers an evening watching Akira Kurosawa’s The Seven Samurai, trying to compare it to other masculine art works in an attempt to come to a better understanding of the male perspective. She is interrupted by her children coming to her asking for attention and assistance. She recalls a quote by W.B. Yeats about how one must choose between the perfection of one’s craft and one's life before going to help her daughter with her report on Mary Cassatt. The next poem, “The Change” explores the relationship between animate and inanimate things how it parallels the distant relationship Ostriker's daughter maintains with her as they drive to her horseback riding lessons. In “One, To Fly,” Ostriker examines the transformation of her son Gabriel as he grows up. In nursery school, he tells her that his three wishes are to be able to fly, to be able to talk to animals, and for there to be no more war. The poem's last stanza reveals that at age 9, Gabriel has largely lost his pacifist nature due to bullying and social pressures and now fights children who bully him. “In the Dust,” the section's penultimate poem, deals with the development of Ostriker's daughter and examines the mother's own role in helping mold her daughter into an acceptable woman in society's eyes, even if that role has made the mother personally unhappy. In the last poem of the section, “His Speed and Strength,” Ostriker meditates on seeing her son at play, overtaking her on his bicycle, using his strength for a purely creative purpose. She also sees a group of black and white children playing together without any tension and thinks to herself that maybe “it is not necessary to make hate.”Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 58.  IV: This Power  The book's last section is composed of three poems, “One Marries,” “This Power,” and “Dream.” “One Marries” begins with a quote from Percy Shelley’s Hymn to Intellectual Beauty, “To fear himself, and love all human kind.” In this poem, Ostriker meditates upon the dynamics of marriage, comparing its necessity for balance to the crude, simple domination of Imperialism. In “This Power,” Ostriker considers the respect and attraction children feel towards their mothers, even in the most degrading and trying circumstances. “Dream,” the book's last poem is very brief and describes“a woman / oliveskinned like an Indian / brownhaired like a European” “giving birth / comfortabl[y]” for days on end.Ostriker, Alicia Suskin. The Mother/Child Papers. 65. Critical reception The Mother/Child Papers enjoyed fairly favorable reception upon its release. The Iowa Review said, “It is startling to read the early pages of this book: where, before this, was the literature of squalid bliss and righteous woe of taking care of an infant? It is alive in Ostriker . . . one of the most intelligent and lyrical of American poets.”http://www.upress.pitt.edu/BookDetails.aspx?bookId=35954 The American Poetry Review said, “Ostriker's work details the achievement of a connection between personal history and public fact as both present themselves to a very intelligent writer . . . Nothing in the novels of Margaret Drabble is as affecting, as convincing, as a few lines of Ostriker's.” http://www.upress.pitt.edu/BookDetails.aspx?bookId=35954 In the years after the initial release of The Mother/Child Papers, it has come to be regarded as an extremely influential book in feminist circles. Upon its 2009 republishing, poet Eleanor Wilner remarked, “So many women shed shame and took heart from The Mother/Child Papers, which feels as fresh and necessary as ever- feminism without dogma, motherhood without sanctimony, the power of the pen dipped in blood: this time not of battle but of birth. Rejoicing at its return, I recall how far this book-awakening us to all that had been left out of literature-was ahead of the curve: gravity's rainbow, the trajectory of a culture's once heaven-bound imagination, headed back to Earth.”Wilner, Eleanor. http://www.upress.pitt.edu/htmlSourceFiles/pdfs/Sp09catalog.pdf References Category:1980 poetry books Category:American poetry collections ","title":"The Mother/Child Papers"},{"id":"34031271","text":"Stemmatophora byzacaenicalis is a species of snout moth in the genus Stemmatophora.

Education  While attending Florida A&M; University in the early 1930s, Kershaw worked part time at the Florida Capitol complex as a janitor. Sometimes after hours he would stand on the Speaker's podium and pretend he was addressing the Florida House of Representatives. While attending Florida A&M; University he became a life long member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity. He graduated with a degree in History in 1935.  Career  After graduating, Kershaw taught civics at a Coral Gables junior high school in Dade County, renamed Miami-Dade County in 1997. In 1955 he earned his Master of Education degree from Florida A&M; University. While living in Miami, he served on the Miami Economic Advisory Board, and was a member of the Knights of Columbus and the Holy Name Society. Kershaw was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in November 1968, to represent the Florida 99th district, which at the time covered mostly Dade County. Upon being elected, he became the first African-American legislator in the state of Florida since Reconstruction. Kershaw served as chairman of the Elections Committee and introduced legislation that lead to the formation of the Florida Human Rights Commission. In 1971, Kerhsaw maneuvered Florida Statute 241.477 through the legislature, which lead to the creation of the Black Archives at Florida A&M; University. He was known in the Florida House of Representatives as \\"Cane Pole,\\" due to his ongoing battle to exclude cane pole fishing from requiring a license.

A Republican, he represented Maine's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives from 2015 to 2019. Poliquin was first elected to Congress in the 2014 general election. From 2010 to 2012 he was the Maine State Treasurer. He was a candidate for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in 2012, finishing second in the primary election. In January 2017, at the start of the 115th United States Congress, Poliquin was the only Republican representing a U.S. House district in New England. Poliquin was defeated by Democrat Jared Golden in his 2018 run for reelection, and is the first incumbent to lose his seat in Maine's second district since 1916. Poliquin claimed the ranked-choice voting process used in the election was unconstitutional and claimed to be the winner because he led after the initial tally. He sued to be declared the winner and have ranked- choice voting declared unconstitutional, but his lawsuit was rejected. He conceded to Golden on December 24, 2018. Early life Poliquin was born and raised in Waterville, Maine. He grew up in a family of French-Canadian ancestry. His father was a school principal and his mother was a nurse. He attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, where he was a running back on the varsity football team,Christopher Cousins, Poliquin recalls when famed New England Patriots coach Belichick was better at lacrosse, Bangor Daily News (January 17, 2014). and graduated in 1972.With Honors: USS Thomas Hudner christened, Phillips Academy (March 31, 2017).

Career Investment management After college Poliquin worked in the investment management industry in Chicago and New York City. Gubernatorial campaign In 2010 Poliquin sought the Maine Republican Party's nomination for governor of Maine. He spent $711,000 of his own money on the campaign and finished sixth of the seven candidates. Paul LePage won the nomination and Poliquin endorsed him. Following LePage's election in November 2010, the Maine Legislature elected Poliqiun Maine State Treasurer. State Treasurer In 2011 Poliquin expressed concerns about the Maine State Housing Authority's plans to construct a low-income housing complex in Portland. Poliquin cited the proposed $314,000 per unit cost as an example of irresponsible government spending. Dale McCormick, the authority's director and an appointee of Democratic Governor John Baldacci, approved the proposal following a reduction in the per unit price to $265,000. In 2012 Maine Democrats accused Poliquin of violating the state constitution by engaging in commerce while in office. The complaints against Poliquin centered around his involvement with the Popham Beach Club, a private club in Phippsburg, Maine, and Dirigo Holdings LLC, a real estate company. Maine Attorney General William Schneider advised Poliquin to disassociate himself from his business ventures but did not offer an opinion as to whether he had actually violated the Constitution. The Maine House voted unanimously to send the issue to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court to settle the matter. The Court declined to offer a ruling, concluding that there were no circumstances in Poliquin's case requiring immediate attention. In February 2012 some Democrats criticized Poliquin for his use of the Maine Tree Growth Tax Program, a program meant to preserve forestland from development pressures for commercial timber harvesting, with 10 acres of his oceanfront property in Georgetown. The program reduced the value of his property from the originally assessed $1.8 million to $725,500, resulting in Poliquin paying $30 a year in property taxes. A 2009 Maine Forest Service report discussed Poliquin's property as an example of one that might not be fully complying with the law, stating that restrictions on timber harvesting in shoreland areas would limit any commercial use of the land. But the report acknowledged that as long as the property was 10 acres it could remain in the program. Poliquin later transferred the property in question to the Open Space program, a less generous tax abatement program. He said the issue was a distraction for the town and was politically motivated by Democrats' dissatisfaction with his policies as treasurer. At the end of his term Poliquin wrote an op-ed in the Bangor Daily News with a list of his accomplishments as treasurer. These included reforms to the state workers' pension plan, efforts to reduce the cost of affordable housing, reduced wasteful spending, and retention of the state's Aa2 bond rating. Post-treasurer career In March 2012 Poliquin announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Olympia Snowe. He lost the Republican primary to Charlie Summers, who lost the general election to Independent former governor Angus King. On July 10, 2013, Poliquin said he was not interested in becoming the Chairman of the Maine Republican Party, despite encouragement to do so from many Republicans, including Governor LePage. U.S. House of Representatives 2014 election In August 2013 Poliquin announced that he would seek the Maine Republican Party's nomination for the Second Congressional District. Poliquin won the primary election against former Maine Senate President Kevin Raye and faced Democratic State Senator Emily Cain and Independent retired Navy captain Blaine Richardson in the general election. Poliquin won with 47% of the vote. 2016 election Poliquin ran for reelection in 2016. He was a member of the National Republican Congressional Committee's Patriot Program, which was designed to help protect vulnerable Republican incumbents in the 2016 election. Poliquin ran unopposed in the primary election. He faced Democrat Emily Cain, whom he beat in 2014, in the November 8 general election. Poliquin defeated Cain with 55% of the vote. 2018 election Describing Poliquin on February 10, 2018, as \\"the last of an endangered species\\" as a House Republican from New England, the Boston Globe wrote that his \\"fight against extinction\\" was \\"looking more dire,\\" with \\"Democrats' leaders looking to make New England a clean sweep in 2018.\\"Goodwin, Liz; Democrats target New England's GOP House holdout; Boston Globe; February 10, 2018; https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2018/02/10/democrats-seek-wipe-out- last-gop-house-member-new-england/foLtPeeoDo9CZErg7vgCPO/story.html In the general election Poliquin faced Democratic nominee Jared Golden and independent candidates Tiffany Bond and Will Hoar. At an October debate Poliquin refused to commit to accepting the results of Maine's ranked-choice election if he lost. After the election Poliquin sued to block the ranked- choice tabulation of results before it began. The judge denied his request on November 15, and rejected Poliquin's lawsuit on December 13. On election night, Poliquin led Golden by 2,000 votes, but was short of a majority. Exit polls indicated that 90% of the independents' supporters ranked Golden as their second choice, which on paper was enough to give Golden the victory. Bond's and Hoar's supporters overwhelmingly ranked Golden as their second choice, allowing Golden to defeat Poliquin by nearly 3,000 votes after all votes were tabulated. It was the first time that since 1916 that the district's incumbent had been unseated in an election. On November 10, 2018, a Poliquin campaign spokesperson raised concerns about the vote count in the race, alleging that some voter boxes lacked proper locks and that a Bangor polling clerk counted ballots unmonitored, which the Maine Journals interpreted as an accusation of voter fraud. Maine Secretary of State Matt Dunlap called the claims \\"a distraction\\" and cautioned the campaign to avoid \\"irresponsible\\" attempts to slow down the tabulation process and erode faith in the system. Tenure In January 2015 Poliquin voted for the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. On April 29, 2015, Poliquin introduced his first bill, the Child Support Assistance Act of 2015. Co-sponsored with Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), it was intended to help single parents secure child support payments by making it harder for the other parent to hide property or funds. The bill was rolled into a transportation bill that passed Congress and was signed into law by President Obama on December 4, 2015. Poliquin voted against granting the president fast-track authority in negotiating trade agreements on June 12, 2015, saying that Congress should be able to help shape such agreements. In September 2015 Poliquin was one of ten Republican U.S. House freshmen who signed a letter urging Republicans to avoid a government shutdown by passing a short-term spending bill a week before federal agencies were slated to run out of money. In April 2016 Poliquin and Chellie Pingree (ME-1) proposed legislation that would allow Cuban-bound flights to make technical stops at American airports for refueling and restocking. The bill's purpose was to prevent American airports from losing business to Canada. Poliquin and Niki Tsongas (MA-3) pushed legislative efforts begun during the tenure of his Democratic predecessor, Mike Michaud, to require the U.S. Department of Defense to purchase U.S.-made sneakers. Poliquin opposed the creation of a national park or national monument in the Maine North Woods. He called for congressional hearings in the region where the proposed park is now, and said that federal officials and non-local supporters ignored the concerns of local residents who opposed it. He proposed a bill to limit the president's Antiquities Act power to declare national monuments. Poliquin was a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership and the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus. Committee assignments *Committee on Financial Services **Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises **Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations * Republican Study Committee Political issues =Taxation= In November 2017 Poliquin said he would vote for the new Republican tax bill, whose framers had dismissed \\"a late suggestion by President Donald Trump to lower the top rate on high-wage earners.\\" As paraphrased by The Washington Times, Poliquin said the proposal \\"would help Maine residents by doubling the standard deduction and increasing tax credits for children ... while keeping taxes low for small businesses and making large businesses more competitive by bringing the corporate rate into line with other industrialized countries.\\" \\"We want to eliminate as many of these loopholes and special-interest carve-outs that only the wealthy and well-connected are able to take advantage of,\\" he said, describing the work on the bill as \\"very methodical, very transparent and very thoughtful.\\" Noting that he had voted earlier in November \\"to move the tax proposal forward in the House, trusting the Senate would continue to work on it and improve it,\\" he expressed approval of the changes Senator Susan Collins and others made \\"that will benefit Maine families and small businesses, such as retaining the medical expense deduction and improving the provision dealing with historic tax credits.\\"Sharp, David; Rep.

The Democratic Leader of the Maine State Senate, Troy Jackson (D-Allagash), praised Poliquin \\"for his successful efforts to fight against illegal and unfair foreign trade\\".

His spokesman said that while Poliquin supported repeal, the proposed bill did not offer a \\"free- market alternative\\" to immediately take its place, which he felt was needed. Poliquin was subsequently criticized by conservative groups seeking immediate repeal of the law, including the Republican Liberty Caucus, which voted on February 5, 2015, to rescind their endorsement of him. Poliquin responded that House had voted numerous times to repeal the law without effect, and that \\"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.\\" In his 2016 reelection campaign Poliquin ran on repealing the Affordable Care Act. On May 4, 2017, he voted to pass the American Health Care Act, which would have effectively repealed the ACA and included cuts to Medicaid. He said it included the best parts of previous attempts to repeal the ACA. He received criticism for taking money from insurance companies and avoiding discussions of his vote to repeal. In his 2018 campaign the health care section of Poliquin's website no longer explicitly mentioned the Affordable Care Act. In 2018 Poliquin co-sponsored legislation that would have cut $7 billion of federal aid to children's health insurance. =Veterans affairs= In October 2017 Poliquin announced plans for the Veterans Access to Long Term Care and Health Services Act, which would \\"reduce red tape\\" for nursing homes treating veterans.Collins, Steven Bruce Poliquin focuses on helping veterans get services; Sun Journal; October 19, 201; http://www.sunjournal.com/bruce-poliquin-focuses-on-veterans/ In November 2017 Poliquin questioned officials of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at a Veterans Affairs Committee hearing. The hearing followed a report by the Government Accountability Office detailing the VA's \\"failure to report potentially dangerous medical practitioners to their national database, which is intended to prevent such bad actors from crossing state lines and putting patients at risk elsewhere.\\" Poliquin later introduced legislation requiring VA medical professionals to report malpractice at the VA to state licensing boards.Slack, Donovan; Lawmakers rip VA on failure to report potentially dangerous medical providers; USA Today; November 29, 2017; https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/11/29/va-officials-face- grilling-failure-report-potentially-dangerous-medical-providers/903347001/ =Immigration= In March 2018 Poliquin criticized his Democratic challengers, writing that \\"illegal immigration is still illegal. We are a country of immigrants, but we are also a Nation of Laws. People entering America must do so legally, otherwise they are not immigrants, they are illegals.\\" He added: \\"This common-sense position is not shared by a single one of my four opponents....They are more concerned with appeasing the extreme far left and having the support of Nancy Pelosi.\\"Collins, Steven; Bruce Poliquin spars with Democrats over immigration; Sun Journal; March 23, 2018; http://www.sunjournal.com/bruce-poliquin-spars-with-democrats-over- immigration/ =LGBT issues= In May 2016 Poliquin voted against a measure intended to uphold an executive order that barred discrimination against LGBT employees by religious organizations that contract with the federal government. He was one of seven House Republicans to switch their votes at the last minute under pressure from Republican House Leadership. After criticism from Democrats, he issued a statement saying, \\"I am outraged that political opponents or members of the press would claim or insinuate that I cast a vote due to pressure or party politics. No one controls my vote\\", and that he abhorred discrimination in any form. =Terrorism= In 2016 Poliquin drafted a bill that would prohibit the federal government from giving food stamps to individuals convicted of terrorism-related crimes. He said the legislation would close a loophole that allows convicted terrorists to apply for aid. =Iran= In December 2017 the House passed Poliquin's Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act by a 289-135 vote. His fourth bill to pass the House that year, it required the public disclosure of the assets of Iran's regime. \\"Reports have indicated these funds are being used to support and sponsor terrorism around the region and to undermine our own national security interests.

This cultural meme reflects \\"the popularization of smartphones and the introduction of tablets and other web-enabled devices that allow consumers to access media content through several touch-points during the course of their daily digital lives.\\" As Mobile Web users increasingly own mobile devices, cross-platform multimedia consumption will continue to re- shape the digital landscape, both in terms of the type of media content they consume and how they consume it. According to a new 2011 survey from comScore, \\"smartphones and tablets are driving nearly 7% of all digital traffic in the United States, with two-thirds of that growth attributed to smartphones alone.\\" Today, half of the U.S. mobile population uses mobile media, up 19% in the past year to more than 116 million people. This growth is only expected to increase as 36.1% of Americans over the age of 13 now own a smartphone. Digital omnivores are a global phenomenon driving 5% of all non-computer device Internet traffic in August 2011. Singapore leads the way at 7.2%, while the U.S. and the United Kingdom both score 6.8% and Australia and Canada complete the top five global markets with 5.3% and 4.4%, respectively. Looking deeper into the 6.8% of non-PC web-browsing done in the U.S., we find that 64.4% comes from mobile phones, 28.1% from tablets and 7.5% from other devices such as game consoles and e-readers. This means that in the U.S. about 4% of overall web browsing comes from smartphones and 1.6% from tablets. While small, these figures point to the way people are beginning to toggle between devices across various day-parts. An analysis of the way consumers in the U.S. viewed news content on different devices throughout the day demonstrates the influence devices have on the way people consume content. On a typical weekend morning digital omnivores access their news using their tablet, favor their computer during the working day and return to tablet use in the evening, peaking between the hours of 9pm and midnight. Mobile phones are used for web- browsing throughout the day when users are away from their personal computer. The impact of connected devices on digital consumption Increased Wi-Fi availability and mobile broadband adoption are changing the way people are going online today. \\"In August 2011, more than a third (37.2%) of U.S. digital traffic coming from mobile phones occurred via a Wi-Fi connection while tablets, which traditionally required a Wi-Fi connection to access the Internet, are increasingly driving traffic using mobile broadband access.\\" Tablet owners Tablets, while not yet widely adopted, already contribute nearly 2% of all web browsing traffic in the United States. This traffic is driven almost exclusively by the iPad, which accounted for more than 97% of all tablet traffic in the second half of 2011. During this period, iPads also began to account for a higher share of Internet traffic than iPhones (46.8% vs. 42.6% of all iOS device traffic. In the U.S., tablet users largely display the demographic characteristics of early technology adopters: younger males (49.5% under the age of 34) with above average incomes (45.9% belong to households earning $100,000 or more a year). At this point in time, more than half of tablet users report that they have used their tablet at least once in the previous month for activities such as social networking, online shopping, consuming news, and viewing videos for entertainment. As the current trend of content providers optimizing their sites for tablets and creating tablet- specific apps continues, it is likely that tablet owners will interact with these devices even more. Implications for marketing, advertisers and publishers While messaging to a set of connected consumers who move effortlessly between their online and terrestrial lives may seem chaotic, complex and difficult to navigate, it is actually presenting opportunities never before thought possible. Media execution and buying are quickly becoming the new creativity levers for marketers as each smartphone, tablet and other connected device represents a unique canvas for media engagement. Brands that strategically manage their communication strategy across this complementary messaging matrix are best positioned to create long term loyalty and high engagement with their audiences. Consumers are utilizing a full-spectrum of digital devices now and cultural communicators must understand these patterns in order to develop incremental, unduplicated reach across the entire digital ecosystem.

Born at Bethnal Green in England to general dealer James Crofts and Ann Rebecca, née Luxton, Crofts entered the workforce at the age of twelve, leaving school to work in a sheet metal factory and joining the Tinsmiths, Braziers and Gas Meter Makers' Society of London. He married Agnes Humphreys at Bethnal Green on 6 August 1893. He and his family moved to Melbourne in 1898, where Crofts became a member of the Sheet Metal Workers' Union (SMWU), serving as vice-president (1907) and president (1908-09). In 1911 he was on the first executive of the Federated Gas Employees' Industrial Union and in 1914 was elected to the SMWU's national executive. He defied his employer, the Metropolitan Gas Company, to attend a union meeting in Sydney in 1914 and was subsequently dismissed, but soon after won the position of secretary to the Gas Employees' Union, a paid position, winning the national secretaryship two months later. Crofts, an activist president, served on the Melbourne Trades Hall Council's executive and was its president from 1924 to 1925. He was secretary of the Commonwealth Council of Federated Unions from 1923 to 1927 and was first secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in 1927, a position he held until 1943. In 19430 he was the Australian delegate to the Fourteenth Session of the International Labour Conference in Geneva, the International Federation of Trade Unions' Fifth Annual Congress in Stockholm, and the British Commonwealth Labour Conference in London; he also served as a deputy on the board of the International Labour Organization. A leading workers' advocate during the Depression, he retired from the secretaryship in 1943 to concentrate on his presidency of the Gas Employees' Union. Crofts was also active in the Australian Labor Party, serving as a Victorian executive member and Federal conference delegate and being president (1926-27) and treasurer (1942-44) of the Victorian branch. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1934. He was frequently an advocate in the Arbitration Court. Identified as a moderate within the Labor movement, Crofts was a firm anti-communist but identified as a socialist. He died at Caulfield in 1950 and was cremated.

Due to the renown of the saint, this Italian name became widespread in Western Europe during the Middle Ages in different versions (Francisco, François, etc.). However, it was not regularly used in Britain until the 16th century as Francis.Francis The name of France itself comes from the Germanic people known as the Franks; the origin of their name is unclear but is thought to mean \\"free\\".

Both he and his family were extremely honored by Emperor Zhuangzong of Later Tang, but later, he was falsely accused of plotting a rebellion, and Emperor Zhuangzong put him and his entire family to death.  Background  It is not known when Zhu Jian was born. His family was from Xu Prefecture (許州, in modern Xuchang, Henan), and both his grandfather Zhu Yan () and father Zhu Cong () were minor military officers at Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered at Xu Prefecture). During Huang Chao's rebellion, Zhu Jian left his home area and became a subordinate of Bo Kui () the defender of Mianchi Base (澠池鎮, in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). At some point, he left that army post and became a bandit, but yet later again an army officer under Wang Gong the military governor of Baoyi Circuit (保義, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia).History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 63. Wang was impatient and harsh, and his subordinates had no love for him. Even the officer Li Fan (), whom Wang favored and often depended on, could not escape severe caning for minor faults. As a result, Li secretly resented Wang. Further, Wang had engaged a lengthy struggle with his cousin Wang Ke the military governor of Huguo Circuit to try to take over Huguo, but was repeatedly defeated, and the army morale was low. In 899, Li started a mutiny and killed Wang Gong, and the soldiers supported him to be acting military governor. Several months later, Zhu further overthrew Li and claimed the title of acting military governor, and became a vassal of the powerful warlord Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. (The main traditional historical sources differ as to Li's fate, with Zhu's biographies in both the History of the Five Dynasties and the New History of the Five Dynasties indicating that Li fled to Zhu Quanzhong's capital Bian Prefecture ()New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 45. (with the New History of the Five Dynasties further stating that Zhu Jian was involved in Li's mutiny against Wang Gong) while the Zizhi Tongjian stated that Zhu killed Li.)  Rule of Baoyi Circuit  In 900, under Zhu Quanzhong's support, Zhu Jian was commissioned to be acting military governor, and then full military governor of Baoyi, by then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. After Emperor Zhaozong was forcibly taken by the powerful eunuchs to Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), which was then ruled by the eunuchs' ally Li Maozhen, in 901, Zhu Quanzhong, who was allied with the chancellor Cui Yin and was trying to take Emperor Zhaozong back from the eunuchs' and Li Maozhen's control,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. was frequently traveling through Baoyi Circuit to deal with the campaign and was treated with respect by Zhu Jian. As a result, after a subsequent siege by Zhu on Fengxiang's capital Fengxiang Municipality forced Li Maozhen to slaughter the eunuchs and surrender Emperor Zhaozong to Zhu Quanzhong,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. Zhu Quanzhong had Zhu Jian given the honorary chancellor designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). When Zhu Quanzhong subsequently forced Emperor Zhaozong to move the capital from Chang'an to Luoyang in 904,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. the forced move of the imperial court was so rushed that not even the imperial officials accompanying Emperor Zhaozong had proper clothes to wear. Zhu Jian prepared 100 sets and had them given to the officials when the imperial train travelled through Baoyi Circuit. Subsequently, after Emperor Zhaozong's arrival in Luoyang, Zhu Jian was given the greater honorary chancellor title of acting Shizhong (). As Zhu Jian shared a family name with Zhu Quanzhong, he thereafter sent a petition to Zhu Quanzhong, stating: Zhu Quanzhong greatly appreciated this request, so he changed Zhu Jian's name to Zhu Youqian (\\"You\\" being the generational character in the personal names of all of Zhu Quanzhong's sons and nephews), and added Zhu Youqian to his family roll, treating Zhu Youqian as a son. Thereafter, Zhu Youqian served him faithfully and contributed to his campaigns.  Rule of Huguo Circuit   Under Emperor Taizu of Later Liang  In 907, Zhu Quanzhong forced Emperor Zhaozong's son and successor Emperor Ai to yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang with him as its Emperor Taizu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. Emperor Taizu moved Zhu Youqian to the more prosperous Huguo Circuit as military governor and also gave him the title of acting Taiwei (太尉, one of the Three Excellencies). He was eventually also given the greater honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling () and created the Prince of Ji. He was known to have received the former Tang official Su Xun () and Su Xun's son Su Kai () as his guests as of 907, when Emperor Taizu, while having received input from Su Xun on preparations of taking the throne but having looked down on Su for what he considered to be selling out the Tang imperial house, forced Su to retire. In 910, believing that two prefectures of Huguo, Jin (晉州, in modern Linfen, Shanxi) and Jiang (絳州, in modern Yuncheng), were too close to Later Liang's borders with its archenemy Jin and therefore was strategically important in Later Liang's campaign against Jin, Zhu Youqian offered to have them carved out of his circuit so that a general can be dedicated to their defense. Emperor Taizu agreed, and carved those two prefectures out of Huguo and making them, in addition to Qin Prefecture (沁州, in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), into a new Dingchang Circuit (), making Hua Wenqi () the prefect of Jin its military governor (to reward Hua for his having earlier been successful in repelling a Jin attack).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 267.  Vacillation between Later Liang and Jin  In 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who, after blaming the assassination on his adoptive brother Zhu Youwen the Prince of Bo and executing Zhu Youwen, took the throne himself. However, rumors quickly spread that Zhu Yougui was the killer, and, despite Zhu Yougui's attempts to placate them with promotions and gifts, many of the senior generals were angry with him. Zhu Youqian was particularly vocal, and when Zhu Yougui's emissary announcing Emperor Taizu's death arrived at Huguo, Zhu Youqian wept and stated to the emissary:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. Zhu Yougui tried to placate Zhu Youqian by bestowing him dual chancellor titles of Shizhong and Zhongshu Ling, and wrote an edict to defend himself against rumors of patricide. He also summoned Zhu Youqian to Luoyang for a meeting. Zhu Youqian refused, stating: Zhu Yougui, knowing that Zhu Youqian would not follow his orders, commissioned the general Han Qing () to attack Zhu Youqian. Zhu Youqian therefore surrendered Huguo Circuit to Jin's prince Li Cunxu, seeking for Jin aid. Zhu Yougui therefore sent the general Kang Huaizhen () the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (感化, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) against Zhu Youqian, with Han serving as Kang's deputy. Kang and Niu Cunjie () the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Weinan as well) subsequently launched an intense siege on Huguo's capital Hezhong Municipality (). Li Cunxu sent his adoptive brothers Li Cunshen, Li Sigong (), and Li Si'en () to aid Zhu Youqian, and he himself then personally headed to Huguo to intercept Kang. Li Cunxu defeated Kang at Jie County (解縣, in modern Yuncheng), forcing Kang to withdraw back to Shan Prefecture (陝州, the capital of Baoyi, now named Zhenguo ()). In gratitude, Zhu Youqian personally went to Li Cunxu's camp with only unarmed guards to thank him. He honored Li Cunxu as if Li Cunxu were a maternal uncle and bowed to Li Cunxu. Li Cunxu held a feast for Zhu, kept Zhu at his tent overnight, and held another feast for Zhu the next day, before Zhu departed. It was said that as Zhu slept, Li Cunxu looked at him and commented, \\"The Prince of Ji truly has an honored physique, except for his arms being short.\\" In 913, Emperor Taizu's nephew Yuan Xiangxian launched a countercoup against Zhu Yougui at Luoyang, and Zhu Yougui, surrounded, committed suicide. Yuan supported Zhu Yougui's younger brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun as the new emperor, and Zhu Youzhen thereafter claimed the throne, moving the capital to Daliang (the old capital of Xuanwu Circuit), where he was at the time. (He also changed his name to Zhu Zhen.) He wrote Zhu Youqian to urge Zhu Youqian to return to the Later Liang fold, and Zhu Youqian did so, recognizing him as emperor and used the Later Liang era name to show submission. However, Zhu Youqian did not cut off relations with Jin altogether. (Despite this continued relationship, however, Huguo troops (along with troops from Zhenguo, Ganhua, and Zhongwu Circuits) participated in a surprise attack that the Later Liang general Wang Tan () launched on the Jin capital Taiyuan in 916 while the main Jin strength under Li Cunxu was battling Later Liang forces under Liu Xun to the east, which nearly captured Taiyuan before being repelled.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 269. In 920, Zhu Youqian launched a surprise attack on Zhongwu Circuit's capital Tong Prefecture (), expelling its military governor Cheng Quanhui (). He then made his son Zhu Lingde () Zhongwu's acting military governor and submitted a petition to Zhu Zhen, requesting that Zhu Lingde be made full military governor. Zhu Zhen was angered and initially refused, but later, fearful that Zhu Youqian would resent him, issued an edict making Zhu Youqian military governor of Zhongwu as well. However, by the time that he issued the edict, Zhu Youqian had resubmitted his own circuit to Jin, and Li Cunxu issued an edict in the name of the Tang emperor (as Jin had been existing under the theory that Li Cunxu was exercising powers for the Tang emperor in hopes of Tang's reestablishment) making Zhu Lingde military governor of Zhongwu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. Zhu Zhen reacted by ordering Liu Xun, assisted by other generals Yin Hao (), Wen Zhaotu (), and Duan Ning, to attack Tong Prefecture. Zhu Youqian sought aid from Li Cunxu, who sent Li Cunshen, his cousin Li Sizhao, as well as Li Jianji () and another adoptive brother, Li Cunxian (),While the Zizhi Tongjian called this individual Li Cunzhi, the real Li Cunzhi was already dead in 908. The description of Cizhou prefect (慈州刺史) matches that of another adopted son, Li Cunxian, perfectly. to aid Zhu Youqian. They fought the Later Liang forces under Liu to an initial stalemate, and then eventually tired Liu's troops out such that Liu withdrew. The Jin forces then attacked Liu's forces as they withdrew, inflicting great losses. However, during the stalemate, as a result of the warfare, food supplies in Huguo dwindled. Zhu Youqian's sons tried to persuade him to resubmit to Later Liang. Zhu Youqian, however, responded: As one of Liu Xun's children was married to one of Zhu Youqian's children, Liu did not attack quickly initially, sending letters to Zhu Youqian to try to persuade him to return to the Later Liang fold before attacking. Therefore, after the defeat, Yin and Duan made accusations to Zhu Zhen that Liu was intending to make sure that Zhu Youqian would receive Jin aid. As a result, Zhu Zhen had Liu poisoned to death. Meanwhile, as Li Cunxu was at that time considering claiming imperial title himself and was seeking past Tang officials to help him reestablish an imperial government, Zhu Youqian sent Su Xun to him. Li Cunxu, meanwhile, created Zhu Youqian the Prince of Xiping and gave him the title of acting Taiwei.  Under Emperor Zhuangzong of Later Tang  In 923, Li Cunxu declared himself emperor, establishing Later Tang as its Emperor Zhuangzong. Later that year, he launched a surprise attack on Daliang (which was defenseless with the main Later Liang strength under Duan Ning preparing a major attack on Later Tang north of the Yellow River). Zhu Zhen, caught by surprise and believing that defeat was inevitable, committed suicide, ending Later Liang. The Later Liang regional governors all submitted to Later Tang, and Zhu Youqian went to Daliang to congratulate him. It was said that Emperor Zhuangzong feasted with him and bestowed on him many gifts. He also changed Zhu Youqian's name to Li Jilin, and had his oldest son Li Jiji honor Li Jilin as an older brother.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. He stated to Li Jilin, \\"My great accomplishment is due to your contribution, Lord.\\" Li Jilin subsequently requested that Ci () and Xi (隰州, both in modern Linfen, Shanxi), which had previously belonged to Huguo, be returned to him. Emperor Zhuangzong declined, but did give him Jiang Prefecture. Also, at Li Jilin's request, in 924, Emperor Zhuangzong allowed him to restart salt production at Anyi (安邑, one of the counties making up Hezhong) and Jie County and put him in charge of the operation, sending revenues to the imperial government on a quarterly basis. Later in the year, Emperor Zhuangzong also granted Li Jilin an iron certificate — a guarantee that he would not be put to death even if he committed death-punishable crimes — and made both Zhu Lingde and another son, Zhu Lingxi (), military governors; further, all of Li Jilin's sons, as long as they were old enough to wear official uniforms, were given official titles. It was said that no other household was more honored than Li Jilin's.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273.  Death  Meanwhile, as the years went by in Emperor Zhuangzong's reign, his favorite actors and eunuchs became powerful figures at court. They repeatedly demanded gifts from regional governors, including Li Jilin, and Li Jilin eventually was fed up with their requests and stopped giving them gifts. During Later Tang's 925 campaign against Former Shu (which resulted in Former Shu's destruction), titularly commanded by Li Jiji but with Emperor Zhuangzong's chief of staff Guo Chongtao as the actual commander, Li Jilin held a ceremonial examination of the Huguo troops before sending Zhu Lingde with his troops to follow Li Jiji and Guo. Emperor Zhuangzong's favorite actor Jing Jin () and the eunuchs used the opportunity to falsely accuse Li Jilin of preparing to rise against Emperor Zhuangzong and being in league with Guo (whom the actors and eunuchs were also falsely accusing of treason and planning to secede with the Former Shu territory). Li Jilin decided that the way to end the rumors was to go Luoyang to personally meet with Emperor Zhuangzong, and he went to Luoyang in spring 926, despite his close associates' attempts to persuade him not to, under the belief that his going to Luoyang might allow him not only to save himself but also Guo. As Li Jilin was heading to Luoyang, however, Emperor Zhuangzong's wife Empress Liu, who firmly believed in rumors of Guo's being treasonous, had already, without his approval, issued an order for Li Jiji to kill Guo. Li Jiji therefore had his servant Li Huan () assassinate Guo with a hammer and also killed his sons Guo Tinghui () and Guo Tingxin (). Emperor Zhuangzong, receiving news of Guo's death, also killed Guo Chongtao's other sons. Further, when he received news that his brother Li Cun'ai () the Prince of Mu, who was a son-in-law of Guo's, was angry about Guo's death, he also had Li Cun'ai killed. Jing then accused Li Jilin of being in league with Guo and Li Cun'ai. Emperor Zhuangzong therefore issued an order moving Li Jilin from Huguo to Yicheng Circuit (義成, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan), but that night, had his guard commander Zhu Shouyin surround Li Jilin at his mansion, chase him out of Hui'an Gate () and kill him outside the gate. He ordered Li Jilin's name posthumously changed back to Zhu Youqian, and also ordered Zhu Lingde and Zhu Lingxi killed at their circuits. Then, he sent Li Shaoqi () the military governor of Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan) to Hezhong to slaughter Zhu Youqian's family. Knowing that she could not escape, Zhu Youqian's wife Lady Zhang met Li Shaoqi with 200 members of her household, and stated to him that while the Zhu household should be killed, the household servants should not, so at her request Li Shaoqi spared them, saving some 100 lives. Before she and her family members were to be killed, she also showed the iron certificate that Emperor Zhuangzong had bestowed on Zhu Youqian, stating sarcastically, \\"This was what the Emperor had given.

Jacobs was born at Surrey Hills in Melbourne to English-born warehouseman Henry Atwood Jacobs and Amy Lilian, née Scales. He attended Scotch College and the University of Melbourne but suspended his education during World War I to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force (5 January 1916), serving on the Western Front in the 15th Field Ambulance. He won the Military Medal for his actions on 29–30 September 1918 at Bellicourt, where he evacuated the wounded under heavy fire for thirty-six hours continuously. He completed his degree after the war, qualifying with a Bachelor of Medicine and a Bachelor of Surgery. He moved to Western Australia and took up a position on the staff of Fremantle Hospital. On 6 January 1929 Jacobs married nurse Eva Ivy May Hurst in the chapel at Perth College. He worked at Harvey during the Depression and joined the Douglas Credit Party, of which he was vice-president in 1933. He ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1934 (for Social Credit) and for the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1944 (for Labor) and 1968 (as an independent). He jointly founded the Western Australian branch of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties and the rise of fascist ideologies drove him towards the left of the political spectrum; he was under surveillance from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Jacobs and his family moved to Narrogin in 1940, where he became involved in Aboriginal welfare. He was one of the founders of the Narrogin Native Welfare Committee in 1946, which campaigned for full citizenship rights and better opportunities for indigenous people. During this period Jacobs began to suffer from tuberculosis, and he was hospitalised in 1947, 1950, 1952 and 1955. He fought vigorously against Robert Menzies' attempt to ban the Communist Party, but denied involvement in the party itself; he occupied himself as a civil liberties and Aboriginal rights campaigner. Jacobs died at Narrogin in 1976.

Raghavendra Rao and produced by K. V. V. Satyanarayana under Saudhamini Creations. The film stars Venkatesh, Meena and Aparna playing the lead roles, with original soundtrack by M. M. Keeravani.http://movieken.com/movies/item/sundarakanda-1992.html The film was a remake of the Tamil film Sundara Kandam. The film was a Super Hit at the box office. Plot Venkateswarlu (Venkatesh Daggubati) arrive at the town and gets appointed as a Telugu lecturer in the junior college where he completed his education. He is fooled by the students headed by a brilliant but mischievous student Roja (Aparna). Venteswarulu is irritated by her indiscipline and finds fault for whatever she does. But this does not stop Roja from playing pranks on him. Thukaram (Brahmanandam), classmate of Venkateswarlu (who is still a student for many years) and some other students create a fake love letter in the name of Roja and put it in Venkateswarlu's desk. Venkateswarlu misunderstands that it is also one of the pranks of Roja and warns her and gives the letter to her. But Roja considers that he wrote the love letter and falls in love with him. Roja's classmates repeat the mischief again and again and Venkateswarlu misunderstands it as Roja's mischief and complaints to Principal (Kota Srinivasa Rao), because of which Roja is suspended without any chance to defend herself. Later on, Venkateswarlu understands that there is no fault with Roja and apologizes to her. Roja, who has also found out the truth, insists that since both their reputations have been spoiled in the college, it is better that both get in love and marry. Scared by her acts, Venkateswarlu keeps away from her. But Roja does not lose her heart and she chases him to win his love. But Venkateswarlu insists that it is not a good ethic for a teacher to fall in love with his student and reveals that he is not willing to marry her. Roja seeks TC from her college and discontinues her studies and insists that she is not his student anymore and he can marry her. Yet Venkateswarlu does not yield to her. Roja shifts to her friend's home as a paying guest, which is next to Venkateswarlu's house and makes it her full-time job to love him. Unable to resist the torture, Venkateswarlu marries a girl named Nanchari (Meena) from an orphanage, which shocks Roja. Venkateswarlu has a great dream about his wife, but Nanchari does not have any qualities of his dream girl, yet she manages somewhat to live to her husband's expectations. Roja understands her situation and helps Nanchari without her knowledge. But when Nanchari finds out the truth she gets furious that Roja has tried to snatch away her husband and warns her that if she ever turns her face towards her husband, she would go so violent. But later Nanchari finds that Roja was his student and feels bad for her acts. Roja and Nanchari become good friends. Roja helps Nanchari to cook, to speak in English and all the ways to attract her husband. But Roja and Nanchari's relationship is not liked by Venkateswarlu and he insists that Roja keep away from their life, but eventually Roja's parents die in an accident. Because she became an orphan, Nanchari brings and keeps Roja in her house. Roja, on the one hand, helps Nanchari and on other hand, makes her attempt to win Venkateswarlu's love and become his wife before her death. He gives a final warning to her that Nanchari will not keep quiet if she ever comes to know Roja's attempt on him. Nanchari hears their conversation, but does not react to that, instead she goes to a hospital for a check-up. When Venkateswarlu wonders why, Nanchari explains that she a got a handkerchief of Roja with blood stains on it. Finally, both come to know that Roja is battling for her life with cancer and counting her days. Nanchari insists that Venkateswarlu marry Roja so that her last wish is fulfilled. But Roja dies in her college, in her classroom, in the place where she sat wearing her school uniform. In her last speech recorded on a tape, she praises Venkateswarlu for insisting that a teacher should not marry his student at any cost. She presents her jewels to Nanchari and tells her that she will be born again as their child. In the end, Venkateswarlu and Nanchari put the jewels on their baby, considering that Roja is born again.

History Cooch Behar State Railway built the line between Geetaldaha, which connected to Lalmonirhat, and Jainti during 1893-1901. The Eastern Bengal Railway constructed the Hasimara–Alipurduar section during the period 1900–1910. The Bengal Dooars Railway also constructed certain lines in the area. Their longest line was from Lalmonirhat to the western Dooars. Those were metre gauge railways. The Eastern Bengal Railway and the Assam Bengal Railway were merged during World War II and came to be known as the Bengal Assam Railway. With the partition of India in 1947, the Indian part of Bengal Assam Railway became Assam Railway, which subsequently became part of North Eastern Railway and Northeast Frontier Railway. The metre gauge track was converted to broad gauge. The long New Jalpaiguri/ Siliguri-Samuktala Road Line was constructed as part of the Assam Rail Link project in 1948-50. After conversion to , it was re-opened on 20 November 2003. Locale The rail bridge across the Teesta, to the south of the Coronation Bridge The Dooars or the Himalayan foothills cover a stretch of about 140 km in the northern part of Jalpaiguri district between the Teesta and Sankosh rivers with fields, forests and tea gardens in the backdrop of low hills. Numerous mountain streams criss-cross the region. The Dooars are particularly notable for its forests and wild life sanctuaries – Gorumara National Park, Jaldapara National Park, Chapramari Wildlife Sanctuary, Chilapata Forests, and Buxa Tiger Reserve. The New Jalpaiguri-Alipurduar-Samuktala Road Line runs through the area. It also runs through another sanctuary outside the Dooars – Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary. Elephants As the line runs through deep forests, it faces problems with elephant herds. A large number of elephants have been killed by speeding trains. There have been restrictions on the speed of trains, particularly at night, followed by protests by the local population. Sikkim connection The construction of a new long railway track from Sevoke on the New Jalpaiguri-Alipurduar-Samuktala Road Line in West Bengal to Rangpo in Sikkim commenced in 2010. The railway line up to Rangpo is expected to be completed in 2021.Financial Express. Indian Railways new Sivok-Rangpo rail project: Travel from West Bengal to Sikkim in just 2 hours. (30 August 2019). In the second phase the line will be extended up to Gangtok.Times of India. Very soon, travelling to Sikkim by train will be a possibility. (17 September 2019). Branch lines The broad gauge branch line from Malbazar in Jalpaiguri district to Changrabandha in Cooch Behar district exists with connecting line to New Cooch Behar. Old metre gauge extension of this line on the Bangladesh side from Burimari to Lalmonirhat is still functional. The Alipuduar–Bamanhat branch line ends near the India–Bangladesh border across the Dharla River. In pre-independence days, it used to connect to Mogalhat, now in Bangladesh, across the Dharla. The bridge is broken. The line from Golokganj meets the branch line. Before the Dharla bridge was broken the rail link from Parbatipur to Fakiragram used to pass through Geetaldaha, now a border village in Cooch Behar district, and Bamanhat. The Alipurduar-Bamanhat branch line was converted to in 2007. Dhubri-New Jalpaiguri Inter-city Express via Cooch Behar was introduced in February 2012.

In the 1770s some of the Mayeye moved to the coast and joined with the Coco people.

It lies about 20 km north of the mining city of Mount Isa in the Waggaboonyah Range. It is an important site for Carpentarian grasswrens. Description The boundary of the Important Bird Area (IBA) is defined by the boundaries of pastoral leases containing sites at which the grasswrens have been recorded. The Buckley River, a major tributary of the Georgina River system of the Lake Eyre Basin, runs through the central parts of the IBA and has its source within it. Some 95% of the site is within cattle stations, about 80% is covered by mineral exploration leases, and about 5% is subject to active mining leases. Landforms include gently undulating plains and low hills. Areas favoured by the grasswrens are characterised by laterites, shallow loams and clays, and skeletal soils. The vegetation generally consists of tropical savanna open woodland, with scattered shrubs and trees of Eucalyptus leucophylla, E. leucophloia and Corymbia terminalis, and a ground layer of large Triodia hummocks separated by bare ground. Patches of gidgee occur throughout. Several seasonal streams have fringing vegetation of Eucalyptus camaldulensis with Lophostemon grandiflorus. In the south of the IBA there are small areas of the grass Dichanthium fecundum and Astrebla tussock grassland on clay plains.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Buckley River. Downloaded from on 2011-12-12. Birds The site has been identified as an IBA by BirdLife International because it contains the largest population of Carpentarian grasswrens. It also supports dusky and Kalkadoon grasswrens, Australian bustards, varied lorikeets, white- gaped, yellow-tinted, banded and grey-headed honeyeaters, silver-crowned friarbirds, long-tailed finches, painted firetails and spinifexbirds.

According to \\"The Politics of Poetry\\"by David Orr, poetry and politics connect through expression and feeling, although both of them are matters of persuasion. Political poetry connects to people's feelings, and politics connects to current events. Poetry can also make political references and have real effects on the perception of politics. Political poetry can impact readers because both politics and poetry express views, with political poetry often defined as being: \\"a specific political situation; rooted in an identifiable political philosophy; addressing a particular political actor; written in language that can be understood and appreciated by its intended audience; and finally, offered in a public forum where it can have maximum persuasive effect\\". Political poetry has existed from the earliest times, including the Roman, Horace ( 65 BC – 8 BC).  Can poetry be political?  Some critics argue that political poetry can not exist, stating that politics do not belong with and can not be incorporated with traditional definitions of poetry. One of the most vivid examples of this comes from a 1968 essay, \\"Studies in English Literature: Restoration and Eighteenth Century\\", written by A.L. French. In this work, French provides criticism of the influential 17th century poet John Dryden's work, claiming that the majority of praise Dryden receives is due to his political messages rather than the quality of his poetry, which French believes is mediocre. For example, French believes Dryden relies too heavily on excessive allusion to get his messages and themes across; French describes Dryden's work and \\"his treatment of the body politic in the epic simile\\". French's argument reveals the inherent difficulty of political poetry: the attempt to incorporate the literal (politics), can destroys the fanciful and imaginary qualities that make poetry what it is.  Britain During the eighteenth century the Augustan poets, such as Dryden and Pope wrote political poetry. Working Class Political Poetry  Working- class women poetry describes the works of the voices behind the machinery and factories of the Victorian era. Critic Megan Timney argues that working-class women poets engaged with nineteenth century class politics and their simple use of diction and themes resonated with. This poetry calls for equality in the workplace, fair compensation and the improvement of working conditions. Meagan Timney examines how working-class women of the Victorian era in Britain were deemed unimportant or unrecognized in comparison to working-class males. As a result of this injustice, many female poets from this time period did not receive the proper recognition they deserved. Many women authors did not receive credit for their works since it was hard to trace an author to her work during this time. Only recently has their history been discovered. Timney argues that working-class women poets engaged with nineteenth century class politics and their simple use of diction and themes resonated with Chartist poetry. In works written by Mary Hutton, she incorporated issues of the day during the 1830s and 1840s by politicizing both gender and class while carefully walking a line of legislative changes and political revolution. Other than Mary Hutton, there are other examples of poetry by other working- class women during the late 1800s through the early 1900s. Besides Hutton, there were also others who had their own stance on the treatment of the working-class. These women poets were helpful because of their influencing ideas for revolutionary change and the commitment to justice. Hutton, a Chartist Poet, focused on political subjects and observed the workings of justice and how women of the working class were treated. Working-class women often were denied access to the reforms of the Chartist movement thus denied the right to fight for their worker's rights. Current research of Mary Hutton has opened doors for further research on female working poets like Hutton to be credited as equal to other working class writers. The importance of this poetry highlights the specifics of the working class during this time period, and how work matters to society.  Irish political poetry  In the 1840s political poetry was widely distributed in a newspaper called The Nation. This was intended to spread nationalism across Ireland. In 1843 some of the major contributors of the newspaper were Thomas Davis, Charles Gavan Duffy, and John Blake Dillon. They produced an anthology of poetry titled The Spirit of the Nation, which consisted of politicised poetry with heavy nationalistic tones and motives, much like the newspaper. The contemporary Irish critic and poet Eavan Boland argues that the act of a woman writing poetry in Ireland is a political act in itself due to the traditional exclusion from the art. The prolific Irish poet Nuala Ni Dhomhnaill asserted, \\"the image of women in the national tradition is a very real dragon that every Irish woman poet has to fight every time she opens her door\\". The political poem's roots in Ireland are very male centric, both in who was writing it and also the subject matter. Women often had no voice or were objectified, and put into the traditional housewife role in Ireland's poetic history. Political Poetry was widespread across Ireland in the mid 19th century: \\"The national and the feminine [was] frequently mixed in the rhetoric of the newspaper\\" (Boland). This association repressed the female voice in the poetry of Ireland. Since then there have been many successful female political poets from Ireland.  Mexican women's poetry  Critic Christopher Conway argues that in the disarray of the U.S.-Mexican War of 1846-1848, many Mexican writers recognized that the losses their country was facing were due to the disconnection among their people. Writers responded to this in a number of ways, but most notably through a new dimension of women's poetry. Centralists and Federalists did not stand together which ultimately mounted to the countries losses, and writers saw that the country needed national unity. Mexican female poets utilized poetry as a way to speak out about the war without being criticized or ignored because of their gender. Women during the U.S.-Mexican War were marginalized and could not hold high political positions. In order to be heard, they created poems and literature. Women poets would go on and form a \\"sisterhood\\" of poets that stood up and collectively spoke out against Mexico's government and its failures. Writing poetry brought empowerment to Mexican women during the US- Mexican war 1. These poets utilized poetry as an approach to voice their feelings in a way where they could feel comfortable without the direct judgement from public figures as well as the men in their lives. Conway explains that \\"... women began to represent and share their experiences through poetry, thereby carving out space for their voice to be heard by the educated women who constituted the primary readership of literary print material in Mexico...\\" 1 During the war, Mexican women took on many important roles like republican spies, smugglers, nurses, and conspirators. But as the war went on, the European notion that women belonged at home started to take over and the term of \\"angel de hogar\\" (angel of the hearth) became a strong belief. Women were denied education: \\"... we find a staged dialog between various men and women at a tertulia over the merits of the prospectus of the magazine, which calls for the education of women 'Some argue against women's education, seeing it as a threat to men, whereas others disagree, arguing that that women need to be educated to strengthen marriage and motherhood' (Gondra 1841,15)\\" 1. Although women had many important roles during the US-Mexican war, men and some women alike feared that women with education would become a threat to the \\"masculine sphere of politics\\".  American   History  American political poetry arguably dates back to the turn of the century. One of the first political poems was written in 1930 by Uri Zvi Grinberg, a poem titled \\"I Hate the Peace of Those who Surrender\\". \\"The East of the Jordan\\", by Zeev Jabotinsky, is another poem; a more modern poetry book is Democracy in Contemporary U.S. Women's Poetry written by Nicky Marsh; political poetry originates from all around the world, however, it is viewed with distinctive variations. Through the reader's point of view, political poetry conveys and expresses political aspects which then shapes how it is read, \\"Poetry might be perceived as political by its audience even if the writer did not mean to convey a political message or ideas, values, praise, or criticism.\\" Poetry uses emotion to convey messages that poets to get across, incorporating the use of culture and politics. Politics, however, has always been heavily involved with complex issues that cannot be solved with emotion alone. John F Kennedy, the 35th president, linked poetry to politics when he said: \\"If more politicians knew poetry, and more poets knew politics, I am convinced the world would be a better place in which to live.\\" The effectiveness of poetry draws from reader experience and emotion; politics, however, is mostly used to convince their audience. Political poetry incorporates these two ideas together, creating something that both influences the audience and convinces them as to the main idea of the poem. William Butler Yeats, an Irish senator in 1922, believed that \\"rhetoric stems from our confrontations with others while poetry stems from our confrontations with ourselves\\".  American Indian political poetry  In \\"Surviving the War by Singing the Blues: The Contemporary Ethos of American Indian Poetry\\", author and critic Rebecca Tsosie argues that the creation of American Indian political poetry in the 1890s was strongly inspired by the struggles and oppression American Indians faced. American Indian Political Poetry consists of poetry and music written by politically-motivated American Indians in order to raise awareness and call for change. Many poets, such as John Trudell and Wendy Rose, represent the hardships that American Indians face in their poetry to \\"ignite and create a unified, spiritual flame\\". In the mid to late 1980s, influential poets and musicians, such as John Trudell and Jesse Ed Davis, created musical poems about American Indian hardships. Although American Indian political poetry originated in the 1890s, \\"numerous Indian poets such as Wendy Rose, Paula Gunn Allen, Leslie Silko, Philip Minthorn, and Maurice Kelly\\" continue to write political poetry in the present day. The messages each artist sends are relayed through the use of poetry and traditional music. The poetry and music written by many Indian poets expose the tragic events American Indians experienced, such as the fight to obtain clean water (issues that are not often talked about). Tsosie asserts \\"contemporary Indian poets... utilize the strength of their traditional past to address the critical issues of present and future\\". Many of the struggles faced by American Indians, such as being generalized as being one group rather than being acknowledged as distinct groups, are caused by Western stereotypes. American Indian poets present ideas to deal and cope with the unjust ways they were treated. Tsosie argues \\"Ward Churchill... notes a central continuity between the 19th century Ghost Dance vision and the contemporary politically motivated poetry of many American Indians\\". The purpose of the Ghost Dance was for American Indians to be able to challenge the injustices and repression that occurred during this time. Poetry has been used to criticize events in America, calling the government into question or being used to show the viewpoint of citizens. One example of this is the government's handling of Hurricane Katrina. Hurricane Katrina was a natural disaster which devastated the Gulf Coast region and many people lost their homes and families to both the storm and subsequent man-made disaster. In, \\"Hip Hop as Disaster Recovery in the Katrina Diaspora\\", Zenia Kish demonstrates the political role that hip hop played in an effort to portray a positive view of the residents that were criticized and labeled as \\"refugees\\" during hurricane Katrina. The music created after Hurricane Katrina demonstrated how influential it can be by \\"... giving a voice to 'those who are losing their own.'\\" The music that was created in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was a way to express the injustices of treatment and media representation. Many African-Americans who had just lost their homes and loved ones were being labeled as refugees instead of disenfranchised victims who lost their housing. This hip hop music movement is similar to the birth of the blues music genre. These types of music were created in response to a natural disaster and to represent how African-American and other minority cultures had been affected. This also gave hip hop artists motivation to criticize the mainstream media as well as the U.S. government and FEMA for the lack of support for the victims. By using musical and lyrical forms of poetry, artists brought awareness to survivors that were mislabeled as refugees. Local artists Mia X and 5th Ward Weebie both used the platform of hip hop to express the difficulties their community was experiencing in the aftermath of Katrina. More popular and mainstream artists such as Jay-Z and Kanye West used this platform to speak out against the prejudice against those affected by hurricane Katrina. A notable example of criticism comes from an off-the-script speech during A Concert for Hurricane Relief where Kanye West candidly exposed double standards in the media when it came to the ethnicity of looters. This was similar to Richard Macwilliam's political poem, \\"A Time of Change\\", where he pinpoints poverty and alienation as possible causes of the September 11 terrorist attacks.  Chicano political poetry  Chicano political poetry thematizes Mexican-American empowerment and addresses inequality. According to critic Adolfo Ortega: \\"Chicano poetry [was] an aesthetic medium of considerable impact on the [Chicano] Movement...[it] helped give vision to the Movement; its power loomed early.\\" In mid-century America, many Mexican- Americans were disenfranchised and didn't have the same rights as white Americans. In 1965, Corky Gonzalez (a Chicano poet) assembled a Chicano youth conference attended by many social activists and poets. This gathering led many young and creative artists to organize to advocate for increased social, political, and economic rights. The Chicano movement used poetry to address these issues to Americans inside and outside the mainstream socio-political establishment. Adolfo Ortega, a famous Mexican-American political poet, in 1965 addressed the Chicano Movement, saying: \\"The Chicano Movement gave birth to a cultural consciousness that resulted in an explosion of artistic talent, poets, novelists, painters, sculptors, and musicians set out to recapture the Chicano world-vision.\\" One example of Chicano political poetry is the poet Alurista, who wrote in bilingual verse to call for equality: raza ain 't you tired raza ain't you tired of the nagging tell the man \\"the cosa es mia [the thing is mine] and i ain't taking a number this time i won't wait in line this time i come in bailando [dancing] a recoger mi cosa [to pick up my thing] the man, he nagging?  Asian American political poetry  Asian American writers must often confront racial bias that seeks to diminish their work. Dorothy Wang argues that there is a bias against Asian-American writers because of their race. Wang states that the: \\"marginalization of Asian American poetry is, arguably, a synecdochic reflection of the larger state of poetry in a capitalist society – poets tend not to write best sellers and poetry has no use-value – yet the erasure of poetry within literary purviews bespeaks a more profound and troubling fundamental misapprehension within American literary (and racial) ideologies: the (mis)reading, even if mostly unconscious, of the category of 'Asian American poetry' as oxymoronic, a contradiction in terms, one that pits the sociopolitical (read: racial) against the aesthetic (the formal, the \\"purely\\" literary) in a false binary.\\" The lack of attention to race in poetry can cause Asian American's contribution to the poetic world to become almost nonexistent. Asian American literature has been taught in English departments across the country only for the past few decades and much of it has third-class status. Many American minority poets were not recognized for their poetry. For example, the 2008 PMLA \\"The New Lyric Studies\\" and in the\\"Poetry and Society\\" were two awards where minority poets were not acknowledged for their poems. The multicultural Asian American movement in the 1960s and 1979s strived to include Asian American poets and artists into the mainstream media. Asian American poets wrote embracing the concept of\\"yellow power\\" similar to the\\"black power\\" movement, that would help them rise to be a larger part of the American poetic scene. They searched to express themselves on a larger media base in order to erase any racial profiling that comes along with their appearance. They wanted to be seen as normal American writers, not ethnic writers. Mei-mei Berssenbrugge (b. 1947) is an Asian American political poet who came to the United States of America from Beijing at the age of one. Berssenbrugge identifies herself as a racially minoritized biracial poet in the language of her poetry. She wants to be seen as an American poet, where her racial profile is overlooked so that when people read her work, she is seen as an American writer and not an Asian one, a political choice. In \\"Fog\\", Berssenbrugge relatives are crossing a long bridge because of how long it will take for them to finally be accepted into society as normal Americans. The following two lines are from \\"Fog\\": \\"It has no shape or color that is stable, as if I had fallen asleep and a long bridge / appeared, where my relatives are like companions crossing a bridge.\\" Her critique of racial identity tends to be indirect; however, as Berssenbrugge mentioned in a 2006 interview, \\"I try to expand a field by dissolving polarities or dissolving the borders from one thing and another.\\" Therefore, her presentation of race and racial identity are \\"not marginal to her poetry but central to her project of desiring to dematerialize whatever...keeps states of being and of nature separate.\\" She uses her understanding of the world to combine two, unlike entities into a much larger picture. Another example of politics in Asian American poetry is in \\"Chinaman, Laundryman\\" (1928) written by H. T. Tsiang (1899–1971): My skin is yellow, Does my yellow skin color the clothes? Why do you pay me less For the same work Tsiang recognizes the inequalities faced by Asian Americans as they try to root themselves in America. Unlike Berssenbrugge, Tsiang directly mentions his skin color in his poem, and he works for race equality improvements for people of color. While some Asian American poets tried to hide their race, others did not. Wang concludes that \\"those who were later to be called 'Asian American' were, from the very beginning, both political (in the broadest sense) and formal, aesthetically self-conscious – never delinked from the social and historical contexts of their making and of the poets' formations\\".  South Asian American political hip hop lyrics  African Americans and South Asian Americans share a social connection in the United States: they both have diasporic roots. Sharma argues that South Asians in the United States utilize hip hop lyrics to display solidarity with African Americans, sharing the status of racialized minorities in the United States. South Asian hip hop artists also advance a social justice agenda that everyone could benefit from. These South Asian hip hop artists are also known as Desi artists (plural, Desis). Desi artists recognize the political potency and relevance of hip hop to promote social change: \\"Hip hop is a powerful lens through which to examine Asian/Black relations not only because of its enormous popularity as a global form but also because hip hop culture is explicit about race, difference, inequality, and power\\". In the 1980s and 1990s Desi artists were influenced by the messages in black rap music and began to write lyrics that challenged problems South Asian faced as they were adjusting to their new cities and being first and second generation South Asians in the United States. Desis artists hip hop lyrics serve to: \\"Blu[r] the line between art and politics... cro[ss] racial, class, and national boundaries and is an extension of the racialized political identities that they forge through hip hop\\". D'Lo is one of the more popular South Asian American hip hop artists and is at the forefront of social change within his community. In his performance piece \\"Eyes Closed In America\\", on resistance to discrimination: ... Behind eyes closed we CAN'T be blinded no more Envisioning a new world for us all Where poor ain't a word no more Where All the colors of races would be revered as gold Where class only means the school you go Where The only wars would be against discrimination Where there's free education... Thus, Desi artists approach hip hop as an extension of their social activists work of being political while helping to build the community they live in.  American political slam poetry  Critic Susan Somers-Willett asserts that slam poetry began between November 1984 and July 1986, in the Green Mill Jazz Club in Chicago. Slam poetry is a type of \\"political complaint\\" and protest that uses identity and other forms to protest oppression. Slam poets and audiences see slam poetry not only as literary or performative, but also as a political event. Somers-Willett argues that: \\"poems that make an empowered declaration of marginalized identity and individuality are a staple of one's slam repertoire.\\" Race, gender and sexuality are all factors that affect poets and the message of their work. Slam poets work is an embodiment of their identity and it breaks the homogeneity of traditional poetry structure. But, a poet is not bound to a certain identity based on their culture, sexuality, or race, although many do use identity. Slam poetry's main goals is to express authenticity of identity to its audience. By this, poets will create a genuine and intimate connection with the audience through their identity based experience. Slam poetry revolutionizes of traditional forms of poetry. Slam poetry ranges from comical poems to extremely serious work about racism, sexual identity, violence, and personal struggles with life; slam poetry is the outlet a lot of writers use to express themselves. Many poets write from a \\"I\\" stand point where in their poems they describe events that has happened to them personally whether it be a positive or negative experience. \\"Inhabiting the space where the \\"I\\" of the page translates quite seamlessly to the \\"I\\" of the stage, the author comes to embody declarations about personal experience in performance.\\" An example of authors using \\"I\\" would be Ragan Fox, who wrote To be Straight: \\"I want to be straight because sometimes being gay is just too difficult.\\" Authors try to reach out to their audience by relating what they say in their poems to how the audience might have felt but never had the courage to say. There are also different ways to perform poetry. Patricia Smith, an African American poet, performed a poem in the voice of a white male skinhead. This shows the opposing party explaining to the audience the hatred and what is going through their minds. Slam poetry can come in various forms, but is a tool that can get a poetic argument across to those who listen. \\"The Cultural Politics of Slam Poetry\\" by Susan B.A. Somers-Willett analyzes different poets and their work. Using poems such as \\"Thick\\" by Sonya Renee, \\"Tongue Tactics\\" by Mayda Del Valle, and \\"To Be Straight\\" by Regan Fox, Somers breaks down how each poet's work is an embodiment of themselves and their individual emotions and struggles. Somers also claims that, \\"poems that make an empowered declaration of marginalized identity and individuality are a staple of one's slam repertoire\\". A poet's work most often aims for authenticity and that in the work itself, the \\"I\\" is a reference to the poet. Slam poetry as a literary form and performance originates from Chicago at the Green Mill Jazz Club in 1986 but was first performed less popularly in 1984 around southern U.S. Regardless of its origins in the U.S. slam poetry can be found in many different parts of the world, Somers reinforces the idea that slam poetry differs for each culture, sexuality, and race; each offering a different perspective and worldview.  Tupac Shakur's political lyrical content  Karin L. Stanford argues that Tupac Shakur wrote political lyrics: \\"Tupac's lyrics underscore his refusal to accept economic inequality and inadequate employment opportunities. He also continues his attack on patriotic symbolism...Tupac's life and political advocacy prove that hip hop music and activism are not mutually exclusive....Tupac's political work reveals his aspiration for social change.\\" Tupac's music also focused on civil rights and oppression to minorities. For example, in his lyrics he criticizes Americans who \\"pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us Honor a man that who refuses to respect us Emancipation, Proclamation, Please! Ni*ga just said that to save the nation These are lies and we all accepted...\\" This refers back to the revolutionary war when colonists promised African slaves that they would abolish slavery if they aided them in the war. This also shows the struggles that African Americans had to endure throughout history to get to where they are today. According to Stanford: \\"Although Tupac's discourse was not framed in traditional revolutionary nationalist rhetoric, his political associations, use of language, public statements, and lyrical content suggest that he identified with Revolutionary Nationalism.\\" In the poem \\"How Can We Be Free\\", Shakur's lyrics give readers a sense of racism and makes a call for change. Sometimes I wonder about this race Because we must be blind as hell 2 think we live in equality While Nelson Mandela rots in a jail cell Where the shores of Howard Beach Are full of Afrikan corpses And those that do live 2 be 18 Bumrush 2 join the Armed Forces This so called \\"Home of the Brave\\" Why isn't anybody Backing us up! When they c these crooked a? Redneck cops Constantly Jacking us up Now I bet some punk will say I'm racist I can tell by the way you smile at me Then I remember George Jackson, Huey Newton And Geronimo 2 hell with Lady Liberty  Salvadoran women political poetry  In El Salvador \\"since 1979, 75,000 Salvadorans have died in politically related violence...over two million live in extreme poverty\\". During the war women experienced a disproportionate impact. Many of these women have been subjected to rape and other forms of sexual torture by military men. Salvadoran women used poetry to write about this violence. \\"Salvadoran women's political poetry moves not from language to idea to action...but rather from action and ideas to language.\\" DeShazer claims that \\"poetry is no luxury but instead provides essential, rigorous witness: to a consistently underreported war against the salvadoran people by the US and Salvadoran governments\\". Mary DeShazer claims that \\"Exiled poet Liliam Jimenez's bitter address to Salvadoran soldiers offers a searing indictment of fifty years of military atrocities and employs apocalyptic revenge motifs, fantasies of retributive violence.\\" Women in El Salvador began to collectively stand together to describe their suffering. According to author Zoe Anglesey: \\"Our poetry will express our total range of feelings: from Outrage to Reconciliation. \\"The voices of less famous women also had a crucial place in the resistance movement and the building of a female literary tradition. Zoe Anglesey writes about how to move on from war: \\"Young women and men of the future / for you it's waiting / the final moment of transition / for you / the day of infinite purple is reserved / the triumph coppery from our blood / for you will be / the bread and soil of our dreams / the all-night worry of our struggles/ the honey and water of our wounds.\\"  Alevi political poetry  Alevi poetry is a type of political poetry. Most (proto) Alevi Poetry deals with discrimination and injustice in society. Alevi poetry has a long tradition of dealing with political injustice and discrimination, going back to the 16th century. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was a very strong division between Turkey nationalist and leftist ideologies. In contrast, the Alevis sided themselves with the left because they were able to have more religious freedom. Alevi poetry is best exemplified in Pir Sultan Abdal's poems. Some poems mix religious and political subjects such as poems themed around the Turkish War of Independence or the social unrest of the 1960–70s. One example of this is the poem \\"The Epos of the Liberation\\" about the War of Independence written by Adil Ali Atalay: It is grievous to be a prisoner in my own country, My mother cried out, did you hear it, sister? The Mahdi appeared and put the crown on his head, All together they were hurrying as if a revolution had broken out. We were invincible, we became one and complete, We were undividable, we were together with Ata[türk], Not as captives, if we had died we would have been free, The brave men said [this is] the time and place, and [they] became heroes This excerpt shows some structure of a typical Alevi poetry. Alevi culture is an oral culture by which their songs, stories, and poems are orally transmitted, remembered and interpreted. Poems are categorized as Alevi when the author see themselves as Alevi and when Alevi symbols and topics are referred to. The reciter of these poems are called asiks (also known as ozan). The term asik literally means \\"the one in love [with God]\\" in Turkish and is part of the heritage of popular Turkish culture. This term has been used since the fifteenth century and derives from Islamic mystical traditions. Asiks usually play a saz (a long-necked lute) as they sing the poems. Askis interprets poems of other asiks as well as their own. According to Dressler, their work includes \\"epic tales, songs of love and devotion, religious hymns, as well as social and political critiques\\". Epic tales are combined with knowledge of popular Sufism. One of the primary functions of the asik is to spread the Alevis' mystical knowledge and epic traditions by \\"chanting poems\\". If there had been no asik institution, Alevi traditions could have disappeared in (proto) Alevism. An asik is can spread poems and also write new ones, which can give him the \\"creative power to reinterpret the tradition\\". Traditionally, this is made by the asik being initiated. That can be done by a recognized asik, by a departed asik in a dream, by a saint (Alevi saint) or by God. Religious themes of asik poetry are made up of devotion for twelve Imams also admired by the Twelver-Shia. Asik tradition is mostly practiced on the countryside and commonly the audience is peasants. Scenes for performances were private homes or coffeehouses. Today, some publishes poems as well. One reason this political poetry is written is because it's a response to the following event: On June 2, 1993, in the city of Sivas about thirty-five Alevi people were killed in a hotel fire by the Sunnis. This caused Alevism to go through a process of religious reorientation. Alevi had a constant chain on suffering, due to the Sivas event. The leftists ended up losing their importance and ended up becoming marginalized.  Nicaraguan political poetry  Nicaraguans facing political oppression used political poetry to oppose the Somoza regime dictatorship in 1978. There were several significance poets who wrote political poetry and spoke out against the grime by using their influence within the community to unite everyone and make a call for action. Political poetry served as a way for the people of Nicaragua to oppose and advocate for their political rights, to be treated fairly and to have freedom to express themselves without fearing that the regime would retaliate. Marc Zimmerman and Ellen Banberger in their article: \\"Poetry & Politics in Nicaragua\\", claim that: \\"Against U.S. intervention and the Somoza dictatorship, poetry and poeticized political discourse have served as dominant vehicle for ideological expression and development.\\" Zimmerman and Banberger list poets who spoke against Somoza including Ernesto Castillo, a young poet determined to share the truth. His poems helped inspire young university students and women to oppose the government that mistreated them and tore their country apart. In his poem \\"In this Country\\", Castillo talks about his generation's struggles: \\"But we were born in Nicaragua In this country, We write each other Letters and poetry,\\" Not about love, But about struggle...\\"  Kimondo-Kenyan form  Kimondo is a form of Kenyan political poetry that often uses satirical elements. Politicians hire poets to write poems that praise them directly while also alluding to the corruptness of the opposer. Athman Lali Omar of Lamu—a poet critic—declares, \\"Kimondo is lightning and it is an attack\\". Kimondo is a Swahili word which means meteor or \\"satan's firebrand\\". This style of poetry is used as direct an attack on politicians. The poet's knowledge of particular politicians helps promote their favorable leader, while simultaneously criticizing the opponent. While kimondo is an older tradition, the modern style of kimondo poetry was established in the late nineteenth century by the Waswahili of the Lamu East Constituency of Kenya on the island of Lamu, located on the northern coast of Kenya, Africa. The establishing of European institutions is the primary cause for the contemporary kimondo style. Europeans left a legacy of political elections, thus starting a style of campaigning that utilizes poetry for campaign electioneering. Political election campaigning will at times be conducted through kimondo in order to provide critique of an opponent's competing points of view. This form of political poetry has been written out of satire by popular Kenyan poets in the past who are then hired by parliamentary to present a poem intended for attack and rebuttal. 198\\\\. Alipokipata kiti ---- When he was elected M.P., akipita kwa matiti, ---- he used to walk with a strut, na kuwambia umati ---- and used to tell the electorate Yeo kwenu nimekuja. ---- \\"Today, I have got round to you!\\" 199\\\\. Akenda kwa Mdhihiri, ---- He then went up to Mdhihiri, kamtukana vizuri ---- and insulted him roundly! huku akiyifahiri, ---- And then went on vaunting, saying, Basi bado nakwambia. ---- \\"And this is just the beginning!\\" 200\\\\. Na siku alosimama ---- And there is the day he stood up mbele ya wengi kauma ---- before a large crowd kwa bayana akasema ---- and said distinctly Kiti ni changu sikia. ---- \\"This seat is mine you understand?\\" 201\\\\. Na hapo akatukana ---- And here too he was abusive. yaso maana tanena ---- I shall tell you of his unspeakable words, watu wafahamu sana ---- so that people may understand very well yote alotangazia. ---- all that he blurted around the place. The purpose of this poem was to display that Bwana Mzamil (the opposer of Bwana Madhubuti) believed he was indispensable, persuading listeners that he was a bad politician. Kimondo poetry will go back and forth, with the speakers representing their respective sides of the political parties. In these kimondo poems, Madhubuti's poet criticizes Mzamil, and vice versa.  In the Post-Mao era of China  Political poetry in the Post-Mao period (1976–1989) was initially used to revere political figures but evolved into a means for protest against communism throughout China. After the death of China's communist leader Mao Zedong, poets chose to write poetry that \\"[eulogized] the heroes that fought against the gang of four\\" (Shiao 1983). Poets also chose to use martyrs who had died protesting against China's government, as their subjects for poetry. A notable martyr of the time was Zhang Zhixin who, like many other martyrs, died for her anti-government views. The historical events that lead to the Post-Mao era was the death of China's leader, Mao Zedong. China's government was experiencing a power struggle that ended once Deng Xiaoping came into power. His reign resulted in social conflicts and lead to the Tienanmen Square Protests. The influence that poetry had in China lead to its evolution into a tool that freely \\"exposes the maladies in the political system\\" (Shiao 1983). Many critics pose the following questions \\"should literature serve politics?\\" (Shiao 1983) and \\"can the writer write about the dark side of society?\\" (Shiao 1983). The question of political content and poetic form is at the center of literature versus propaganda. Poems/poets A-Z *A Time of Change.: Richard McWilliam – Looks at the possible causes of 9/11. Talks about poverty and alienation being the roots of this unfortunate event *Black Workers.: Hughes, Langston – Gives a theology about the body also leaves behnd the bees, and the bees go out and do the work. while others take away from the bees and all they have done.

Taçon (born 1958) is an anthropologist and archaeologist based in Australia. He has conducted field work in Australia, Botswana, Cambodia, Canada, China, India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, South Africa and the United States. In 2011, he was appointed the first Chair in Rock Art research at Griffith University on the Gold Coast, Australia. Taçon has made several key archaeological discoveries in Australia, most notably in western Arnhem Land (NT) and Wollemi National Park (NSW). These include the earliest rock art evidence of warfare in the world, the origins of the Rainbow Serpent, significant new Arnhem Land rock art sites, rock art discoveries in Wollemi National Park and the oldest rock paintings of Southeast Asian watercraft in Australia. Early life and education Taçon earned a BA (Honours) at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, in 1980, followed by an MA in Anthropology from Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, in 1984. In 1990 he was awarded a PhD from the Australian National University in Canberra, after a spell as professor at Trent University from 1989 to 1990. Career He was based at the Australian Museum in Sydney from 1991 to 2005, acting as a principal research scientist in anthropology from 1999 to 2005 and Head of the Museum's People and Place Research Centre from 1995 to 2003. In 2005, Taçon joined Griffith University as Professor of Archaeology & Anthropology, taking the Chair in Rock Art Research in 2011, a position he still holds . From 2008 he led two research programs at Griffith, \\"Picturing Change\\" and \\"Late Pleistocene Peopling of East Asia\\". He has pioneered the use of radiocarbon dating of beeswax rock art, and his research team was the first to use uranium-series direct dates for rock art in China. Taçon established and became the Director of the Place, Evolution and Rock Art Heritage Unit (PERAHU) at Griffith University. This research unit is located within the School of Humanities, and advocates multidisciplinary, multicultural and scientific approaches to rock art and cultural evolution research. From 2012 he was funded by the Australian Research Council as chief investigator on \\"The peopling of East Asia and Australia\\", and by the Northern Territory Government to lead the project \\"History places: Wellington Range rock art\\". The latter led to the publication of a study which documents rock art of great significance known as the Maliwawa figures, published in Australian Archaeology in September 2020. The art includes 572 images across 87 sites in northwest Arnhem Land, from Awunbarna (Mount Borradaile) across to the Wellington Range. They are estimated to have been drawn between 6,000 and 9,400 years ago. The find is described as very rare, not only in style, but in their depiction of bilbies (not known historically in Arnhem Land) and the first known depiction of a dugong. his research is focused on improving the placement of Australian archaeology and history of European contact in a regional context, in Southeast Asia. He involves Indigenous peoples (including Indigenous Australians) in his archaeological research, and is himself involved in collaborative research on human evolution research. He has close collaborations with the Rock Art Research Centre at the Australian National University and the Centre for Rock-Art Studies at the University of Western Australia. Other work \\"Protect Australia’s Spirit” campaign He launched the \\"Protect Australia’s Spirit\\" campaignProtect Australia’s Spirit in May 2011 with actor Jack Thompson.

He was punched by an inmate and fell, hitting his head on the floor, and dying in hospital the next day. Biography Born in South Carolina, Palmer attended Jefferson High School in West Virginia and then spent four years in the United States Marine Corps, including time at Quantico Marine Corps base. He met a New Zealand woman, Tracy, online and moved to New Zealand where they married a year later. When he died, he was survived by Tracy and three children: Taylor 15, Riley, 5, and Abbey, 3. Death Palmer worked at the Spring Hill Corrections Facility. Palmer was killed by Latu Savelio Halangingie Kepu while unlocking the door to Kepu's cell with two other officers. As the door opened, Kepu swung a punch at Palmer who fell back and hit his head on the concrete pathway outside the cell. Palmer died in hospital the next day when his life support was discontinued. There had been previous confrontations between Kepu and Palmer and Palmer had laid several misconduct charges against Kepu, including one the day before the deadly attack. Palmer had allegedly requested to be moved from that unit in writing due to death threats from Kepu, but his requests were apparently denied. Also not mentioned in the official inquiry is that the 3 officers including Jason Palmer that unlocked Kepu that day were very inexperienced - the most senior officer on the unit that day had been moved down to a low-security unit due to staffing shortages. At the inquest, much was made of the \\"lack\\" of high-security process during the unlock; such as why Kepu wasn't made to stand with his hands on the wall as he was unlocked. This focus obscured the real reason why Jason's death occurred in a supposedly low-security prison - managerial incompetence. Kepu had been reclassified as a maximum security prisoner because he had already seriously assaulted another officer 3 weeks previously, but had not yet been relocated to the maximum security facility at Paremoremo because they did not have any room. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to six years and four months in prison. He appealed the length of the sentence, but this was declined. Kepu is a member of the Killer Beez, gang and reports arose that claimed the death was a gang-ordered hit, whilst prison staff members were well aware of threats made against Palmer. The Corrections Department denied the claim made by these reports, stating that an internal investigation had found that prison management and staff were not at fault. Palmer's mother, Ada Palmer, disagreed with the findings of the Corrections Department's investigation. It was reported that Ada Palmer said, \\"They said it was an accident... it is a cover-up.\\" Judith Collins, then Minister of Corrections, described Palmer's death as the saddest day in the department's historyCorrections on defensive after prison guard death, NZ Herald, 16 May 2010. and moved in Parliament \\"that this House express its deep sympathy and condolences to the wife, family, friends, and colleagues of Spring Hill Corrections Officer Jason Palmer, who died on Sunday as a result of an assault by a prisoner.\\" References Category:1970s births Category:2010 deaths Category:People from South Carolina Category:Prison officers Category:American manslaughter victims Category:United States Marines Category:American emigrants to New Zealand ","title":"Jason Palmer (prison officer)"},{"id":"34032103","text":"Bennett is a locality in Alberta, Canada.

Dr. Seth C. Hawkins, an emergency physician who specializes in EMS and wilderness medicine, founded ACWM in 2007 in the state of North Carolina. It is the first regional wilderness medicine non-profit of its kind in the United States. Contemporary authorities in wilderness medicine have noted its importance in establishing a mechanism for regionally pooling information and resources in a field that otherwise has little connection between local or regional experts. Critical to that effort have been uses of the internet in ways not previously seen in wilderness medicine. At the time of its founding, ACWM served the American states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia. With the Knob Creek Resolution of 2011, ACWM expanded to include Alabama, Maryland, and Kentucky. Programs Although its primary purpose as a non-profit is promoting communication and awareness of programs already in place, ACWM developed a number of programs of its own to fill holes in the region. Chief among them was an Advanced Wilderness Life Support (AWLS) course and the ACWM Southeastern Student Wilderness Medicine Conference-–neither previously available on a regular basis in the southern Appalachians.  AWLS Course  The ACWM version of the AWLS course has been recognized for its innovative use of high-technology medical simulation, using state of the art simulation mannequins in wilderness scenarios, as well as its role in attracting healthcare professionals into the nascent profession of wilderness medicine. The ACWM AWLS course was run continuously from 2007-2016 in southern Appalachian locations: in Linville Gorge NC from 2007-2009, in New River Gorge WV from 2010-2012, in Black Mountain NC from 2014-2015 (with transitional organizing in 2013), and in Roanoke VA in 2016. In 2012 Outside Magazine cited the AWLS program as one of the top four wilderness medicine training programs in the United States.  Student conference  Over a thousand medical students and wilderness enthusiasts were introduced to wilderness medicine through the ACWM student conference. It used a novel organizational strategy, moving every year to a new medical school in the southeast. This strategy increased geographic access throughout the region and provided organizational experience for the medical students at each host school. In the summer of 2012, the conference became independent of the Center and is now run through Blue Ridge Adventure Medicine as the Southeastern Student Wilderness Medicine Conference. The Center promotes this independently configured conference as it does all quality wilderness medicine conferences in the southeast, also including the Southeast Wilderness Medicine Conference, the Appalachian Wilderness Medicine Conference, and Wilderness Medical Society conferences in the region. Past ACWM Southeastern Student Wilderness Medicine Conference locations: 2008: Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 2009: UNC-Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC 2010: Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA 2011: Quillen College of Medicine, East Tennessee State University, TN 2012: Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston Salem, NC  Other programs and partnerships  In addition to its primary regional organizing function, ACWM has served as an incubator for other local and national programs, such as the Green EMS Initiative, a precursor to the International Institute for Sustainability in Emergency Services. It has also served as a partner in multiple regional wilderness medicine and safety initiatives. These include partnership with the New River Alliance of Climbers in Fayetteville WV (arising from the need to address wilderness medicine education within the southeastern climbing community) and Friends of Seneca (positioning first aid caches at the popular and historic climbing area Seneca Rocks). ACWM staff have also provided instruction at multiple conferences and festivals, including the Roanoke GO Outside Festival and the New River Rendezvous. Mountain Laurel Award The ACWM also sponsors the Mountain Laurel Award every year, which has been cited as the most prestigious wilderness medicine award in the southeastern United States. This lifetime achievement award is given to individuals or groups who have made “extraordinary, lasting and substantial contributions to wilderness medicine in the southern Appalachians.”  Mountain Laurel Award Recipients  :* 2008: Tom Kessler (Gallatin TN): course director for the Wilderness Medical Society Student Elective, held in Townsend, Tennessee, which trains students from around the world in wilderness medicine :* 2009: Jack Ditty (Morgantown WV): founder and director of the Appalachian Wilderness Medicine Conference (a conference not affiliated with ACWM) :* 2010: Michael Caudell (Augusta GA): founder of MEDWAR, a wilderness medicine adventure course with versions now appearing around the world; founder and current director of the Georgia Health Sciences University Wilderness Medicine program :* 2011: Justin Padgett (Cullowhee NC): founder of Landmark Learning, a premier wilderness medicine school based in the southeast; founder of Disaster Medic program; author and founder of Starguard Wilderness Lifeguard program :* 2012: Chris Moore (Chattanooga TN): founder of the Southeastern Wilderness Medicine Conference; Venue Medical Coordinator, Whitewater Competition, 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games; Medical Director, World Cup Whitewater Competition; Founder, Wilderness Medical Society Environmental Council; Wilderness Medical Society's Delegate to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro :* 2013: Slim Ray (Asheville NC): internationally recognized expert on swiftwater and river rescue; author of River Rescue and Swiftwater Rescue; course developer and instructor with Rescue 3 and Nantahala Outdoor Center :* 2014: Seth C.

P19 cells is an embryonic carcinoma cell line derived from an embryo-derived teratocarcinoma in mice. The cell line is pluripotent and can differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers. Also, it is the most characterized embryonic carcinoma (EC) cell line that can be induced into cardiac muscle cells and neuronal cells by different specific treatments. Indeed, exposing aggregated P19 cells to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) induces differentiation into cardiac and skeletal muscle. Also, exposing P19 cells to retinoic acid (RA) can differentiate them into neuronal cells. Origin of the P19 cell line Cancer cells in humans may result in the patient's death if the aggressive cancer cell grows and metastasizes. However, researchers utilize these cells to study the development of cancer cells in order to find more specific treatments. For developmental biologists, embryonal carcinoma, which is derived from teratocarcinoma, is a good object for developmental study. In 1982, McBurney and Rogers transplanted a 7.5 day mouse embryo into the testis to induce tumor growth. Cell cultures containing undifferentiated stem cells were isolated from the primary tumor which have a euploid karyotype. These stem cells were named embryonal carcinoma P19 cells. These derived P19 cells grew rapidly without feeder cells and were easy to maintain. Moreover, the multipotency of P19 cells was then confirmed by injecting the cells into blastocysts of another mouse strain. The researchers found that there were tissues from all three germ layers growing in the recipient mouse. Based on their continuous studies, they further derived subtype cell lines from original P19 cells: P19S18, P19D3, P19RAC65 and P19C16. The difference between these subtype cell lines is the ability to differentiate into neuronal cells or muscle cells in response to treatment with retinoic acid or DMSO, respectively. More recently, various studies generate cell lines that were initially derived from differentiated P19 cells. Due to the pluripotency of P19 cells, those new derived cell lines can be ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm-like cells. Differentiation of P19 cells P19 cells can be maintained in exponential growth because of a stable chromosomal composition. Because embryonal carcinoma can differentiate into cells of all three germ layers, P19 cells can also differentiate into those ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm-like cells. When embryonal carcinoma cells are cultured at high density, they start to differentiate. By aggregating the cells into an embryonic body, EC cells can also process differentiation. In P19 cells, addition of non-toxic concentrations of drugs to aggregated embryoid body cells can induce differentiation of P19 cells into specific cell lines depending on the added drug. The two most common and effective drugs are retinoic acid (RA) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Studies have shown that a certain concentration of RA can induce P19 cells to differentiate into neuronal cells, including neurons and glial cells, whereas 0.5% - 1% DMSO led P19 cells to differentiate into cardiac or skeletal muscle cells. In the RA treatment method, neurons, astroglia and fibroblasts can be identified after aggregation. Differentiated cells also have choline acetyltransferase and acetyl cholinesterase activities. When treated with DMSO, cardiac muscle cells developed after 5 days of exposure and skeletal muscle cells appeared after 8 days of exposure. Those studies showed that drug exposure causes multipotent P19 cells to differentiate into different layers of cells. Because the concentration of retinoic acid or DMSO is nontoxic to the cells, the drug-specific differentiation is due to induction of cells not selection. Mutants of P19 cells have been generated to investigate the mechanism of drug-specific differentiation. Moreover, signaling pathways related to neurogenesis and myogenesis were also investigated by studying gene expression or generating mutants of P19 cells. Neurogenesis in P19 cells. Treatment of undifferentiated P19 cells with retinoic acid can specifically induce them into neuronal cells. Using doses between 1 μM to 3 μM of RA can generate neurons as the most abundant cell type. Neurons under this treatment reached the highest populations between six days and nine days. Several neuronal markers such as neurofilament proteins, HNK-1 antigen and tetanus toxin binding sites are expressed at highest levels during these days. After six to nine days of treatment, the relative neuronal population declines, likely because of faster proliferation of non-neuronal cells. After 10 days of exposure, astroglial cells can be detected using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is a specific marker of glial cells. Other than into neurons and astrocytes, P19 cells can also differentiate to oligodendrocytes, which can be detected using the specific markers, myelin-associated glycoprotein and 2',3'-Cyclic-nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase. Moreover, oligodendrocytes also developed and migrated into fiber bundles in mice when the RA-induced cells were transplanted into the brains. Retinoic acid can induce not only P19 cells but also other progenitor cells or embryonic stem cells to differentiation. Since cells after retinoic acid treatment did not immediately express neuronal marker genes, RA must initiate some pathway to process cellular differentiation. Many studies used P19 cells to investigate the RA-induced mechanisms, including generating the mutant allele of retinoic acid receptor genes and studying the expression of receptor genes, Hox genes and retinol binding proteins while exposing to RA. All of these studies indicate that the P19 cell is a good in vitro model system for investigating the mechanism of drugs that interfere with specific cellular pathway. What is more, by using the ability of RA-induced neurogenesis in P19 cell, lots of researchers started to identify the in vitro differentiation mechanisms of neuro- or gliogenesis. Several related pathways or including Wnt/β-catenin pathway, Notch pathway and hedgehog pathway are investigated either using gene expression or generating alleles for related genes. Myogenesis in the P19 cell line Same as retinoic acid, DMSO induced differentiation is not specific to P19 cells. It could also induce neuroblastoma cells, lung cancer cells and mouse ES cells. At concentration of 0.5–1% DMSO induced P19 cells to aggregate and process mesodermal and endodermal cell types. After 2 days of exposure, the endoderm—like cells appeared and resembled primitive extraembryonic endoderm. After 6 days of exposure, the cardiac muscle appeared in the interior of the aggregates. The content of cardiac muscle cells were 25% of the cells. After 10 days of exposure, skeletal muscle cells appeared around the embryo body. The cellular mechanism that occurs during aggregation and differentiation is still not fully studied. However, some studies showed that the cellular communication plays an important role in muscle differentiation in P19 cells which might explain why cells need to aggregate first to process the muscle differentiation. In order to elucidate the mechanism of myogenesis in P19 cells, several cardiac specific transcription factors including GATA-4, MEF2c, Msx-1, Nkx2.5, MHox, Msx-2 and MLP are found to change during differentiation. Reports have shown that GATA-4, NKx2.5 and MEF2c were all upregulated after DMSO induction. In recent years, P19 cells were also used in studying the mechanism of cardiac differentiation and myogenesis. The main affected signaling pathway, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) pathway is the most strongly studied signaling in P19 cells. By generating the P19CL6noggin cell line, which overexpresses the BMP antagonist noggin, they found that the mutant cells didn’t differentiate into cardiomyocytes when treated with 1% of DMSO, suggesting that the BMPs were indispensable for cardiomyocyte differentiation in this system. They also provided the evidence showing that TAK1, Nkx-2.5, and GATA-4 are important in cardiogenic BMP signaling pathway. Future directions P19 cells provide valuable formation of both neuronal cells and muscle cells in vitro. Since P19 cells are easy to maintain and culture compared to other embryonic stem cells, they are a convenient model to perform developmental studies in vitro. Techniques to manipulate this cell line to express or knock out certain genes allow for detailed investigation of signaling pathways, functional aspects and the regulation of protein expression of myogenesis and neurogenesis. The extended research can also elucidate the later stages of heart or brain development and maturation.

The rooftop photovoltaic installation supports the Department of Defense's goal of increasing renewable energy sources to 25 percent of all energy consumed by the year 2025. The United States Department of Defense is one of the largest single consumers of energy in the world, responsible for 93% of all US government fuel consumption in 2007 (Air Force: 52%; Navy: 33%; Army: 7%. Other DoD: 1%). In FY 2006, the DoD used almost 30,000 gigawatt hours (GWH) of electricity, at a cost of almost $2.2 billion. The DoD's electricity use would supply enough electricity to power more than 2.3 million average American homes. In electricity consumption, if it were a country, the DoD would rank 58th in the world, using slightly less than Denmark and slightly more than Syria (CIA World Factbook, 2006). The Department of Defense uses of fuel annually, an average of of fuel per day. A large Army division may use about per day. According to the 2005 CIA World Factbook, if it were a country, the DoD would rank 34th in the world in average daily oil use, coming in just behind Iraq and just ahead of Sweden. General The military recognizes that renewable energy can provide improvements in force safety and budget stability as well as mitigate climate change so it has several programs working on deploying alternative energy at major facilities and in forward operating bases. Admiral Samuel J. Locklear has called climate change the biggest concern for the United States military.Chief of US Pacific forces calls climate biggest worry March 9, 2013 Boston GlobeNavy Admiral Samuel J. Locklear says the biggest security threat in the Pacific region is climate change. March 12, 2013 Wall Street Journal Air Force The Air Force is the largest user of fuel energy in the federal government. The Air Force uses 10% of the nation's aviation fuel. (JP-8 accounts for nearly 90% of its fuels.) This fuel usage breaks down as such: 82% jet fuel, 16% facility management and 2% ground vehicle/equipment.Powering America’s Defense: Energy and the Risks to National Security , CNA Analysis & Solutions, May 2009 To meet renewable energy goals, the Air Force plans to certify its entire fleet on coal-to-liquid synthetic fuel blends by 2011. By 2016, it plans to fuel half of its domestic transportation by US-produced synthetic blends, including blends of biofuels and jetfuels, known as Hydrotreated Renewable Jet (HRJ). The Air Force is currently the leading purchaser of renewable energy within the Federal government and has been a long time pioneer of renewable energy development and leadership. The Air Force is recognized by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Green Power Partner, one of the nation's top purchasers of green power. The Air Force Energy Plan, published in May 2010, includes more information about the Air Force's goals, including reducing demand, increasing supply, and changing the culture to include energy awareness. Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Operational Energy Plans and Programs In 2010, DoD established the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Operational Energy Plans and Programs to coordinate energy issues. In July 2010, DoD also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Department of Energy to facilitate cooperation and accelerate research, development, and deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. DoD's Energy Conservation Investment Program (ECIP) improves the energy and water efficiency of existing Military Services' facilities. The program's projects help the Military Services save on energy usage and cost.Whitehouse.gov The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided $120 million for the ECIP. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 has also given money for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Army National Guard and Air National Guard facilities to invest in energy efficiency. Recent developments The US Army has recently prioritized renewable energy strategies in Iraq.Vogel, Steve. Pentagon Prioritizes Pursuit Of Alternative Fuel Sources, The Washington Post, 4/13/09 Strategies include the Tactical Garbage to Energy Refinery Program, which converts of waste to of JP-8 fuel, a photovoltaic flexible, portable mat, insulating foam technology, hybrid-electric Manned Ground Vehicles (MGV), and highly efficient portable cells. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act gave more than $150 million to develop these technologies. Stateside, the Army created the Net Zero program with a goal to have 30 installations achieve net- zero energy by 2030, including some that will also be net-zero in waste and water. In 2011, they opened the Base Camp Systems Integration Laboratory, which compares an energy efficient base camp with a traditional one and trains soldiers to use energy efficient technologies. The Army Energy Security Implementation Strategy,http://www.asaie.army.mil/Public/Partnerships/doc/AESIS_13JAN09_Approved%204-03-09.pdf published in 2009, gives details about the Army's energy goals. The Department of the Navy established Task Force Energy to focus on meeting energy goals, which include reducing non-tactical petroleum use in the commercial fleet by 50 percent by 2015, producing at least 50 percent of shore based energy from alternative sources by 2050, acquiring 50 percent of total energy from alternative sources by 2020, and having 50 percent of Navy and Marine Corps installations be net-zero by 2020. The Navy hopes to demonstrate a Green Strike Group (fueled by biofuels and nuclear power) by 2012 and sail the Great Green Fleet by 2016. The Office of Naval Research developed and deployed the Experimental Forward Operating Base (ExFOB), including photovoltaic energy, shelter insulation, small unit water purification, and energy efficient heating, lighting, and cooling. The Marine Corps established the Expeditionary Energy Office to increase combat effectiveness by reducing the need for liquid fossil fuel by 50 percent by 2025, using liquid fuel for mobility only.

It has about 3,000 active and senior members. Its annual meeting is the association's main forum to communicate scientific progress in surgery. Until 2005, the association held its own meetings. These meetings were hosted by surgical university departments in the United States. In 2006, the organization merged its annual meeting with the annual meeting of the Society of University Surgeons to form the \\"Academic Surgical Congress\\". History The Association for Academic Surgery was founded by U.S. American surgeon-scientists in 1967. It was grown steadily over the past few decades and now counts about 3,000 members from the United States and other countries. Since its inception, most of its members have been younger academic surgeons at the assistant professor or associate professor level. Mission The mission of the organization is to promote surgical research investigations through the communication of ideas between surgical residents, surgical fellows, junior surgical faculty and full professors and through awarding surgical research grants. Members and leaders of the association usually maintain active laboratories or academic research programs (e.g. in outcome research) at their institutions. In recent years, the association has increased its international involvement and taken a role in policy development. More members are from outside North America than in the past. Membership and age limit Surgeons interested in academic research may join the association even before they have completed their surgical training. Active membership is available to senior residents, chief residents and surgical fellows that are enrolled in recognized training programs for general surgery or surgical subspecialties. The majority of active members are junior faculty members at a major university. The period of active membership ends already 10 years after the first academic faculty appointment. Members then superannuate and become senior members. Senior members are no eligible to serve in administrative or officer positions. After age 60, members are no longer required to pay dues. This is specified in the constitution to keep the association's membership young. Communications Active and senior members participate actively in the association's functions. Surgical research teams submit scientific abstracts each summer for presentation at the Academic Surgical Congress early the following year. A majority of members attends the annual Academic Surgical Congress each February where new research papers presented and discussed. The official organ of the Association is the Journal of Surgical Research. In addition, all members receive a newsletter that is published by the AAS Executive Council every six months. This publication describes the ongoing activities of the association and informs members about other pertinent issues facing the association as well as surgery in general. Awards The Association for Academic Surgery awards the following grants and prizes to outstanding surgeon-scientists: * Joel Roslyn Faculty Award to junior surgical faculty members in the first five years of their career * AAS Foundation Research Fellowship Award to surgical residents in their research fellowships * AAS/Taiwan Surgical Association International Visiting Professorship Award * AAS/Royal Australasian College of Surgeons Younger Fellows Committee Leadership Exchange * AAS/Colombian Surgical Association International Visiting Professorship Award * AAS Student Travel Grant International courses The Association for Academic Surgery conducts annual courses to introduce young surgeon-scientists to surgical science.

Like Shah Waliullah Muhaddith Dehlvi he was worried about the state of Muslims of South India, especially those of Nagore and its nearby regions. He founded the Madrasa Al-Baqiyat As-Salihat in Vellore in the year 1857.hazrath fidwee rah, அண்ணல் அஃலா ஹள்ரத்(ரஹ்)அழகிய சரிதை – Beautiful History of A'la Hadrath, Pages 31–48, Vellore – 632004, Darul Khatib,1992J.B.P.More, Political Evolution of Muslims in Tamil Nadu and Madras 1930–1947, Page 54, Orient Blackswan, 1997,  Early life Wahhab was born on 1 Jumādā al-Ūlā of Hijri 1247 (19 October 1831) in Vellore. His father, Abdul Qadir Sahib, died when he was 4 years old in Madurai, India. He moved into his mother's household in Vellore and gained early education there.  Early education In Vellore, after having finished his pre-school education with his mother and uncle, Wahhab did his primary schooling with Hakeem Jainul Abideen, a teacher and medical practitioner, who lived in the same street. He completed his primary education in Arabic and Persian languages with him.A'la Hadrat, பாகியாதுஸ் ஸாலிஹாத் பத்வாத் தொகுப்பு-ஓர் அறிமுகம் – Compilation of the Islamic Rulings of Al-Baqiyat As- Salihat – An Introduction, Vellore – 632004, Madrasa Al-Baqiyat As-Salihat, 1989 To complete the necessary education of the time, Wahhab left for Madurai. There he stayed with Abdus Salaam Ibrahim, who taught him for seven more years. Having finished his schooling, Wahhab returned to Vellore. He married and started his family life. On 15 Sha'ban 1284 AH, he left for Hijaz, Arabia, while his three-year-old son and family stayed in India.  Higher education In Mecca, he learned from Rahmatullah Kairanawi, Imdadullah Muhajir Makki and Muhammad Hussein Peshawari. Wahhab learned some Islamic books and Munazara from Rahmatullah Kairanawi. He completed his higher studies in the principles of Hadith from Syed Muhammad Hussein Peshawari. He pledged allegiance to his teacher Imdadullah Muhajir Makki and started his spiritual journey. He found yet another teacher in Abdul Latheef back home in Vellore.  Strange coincidence Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi, the founder of the Madrasa Darul Uloom Deoband in North India and A'la Hadrat, the founder of the Madrasa Al-Baqiyat As-Salihat in South India shared a common lineage in their Islamic Studies. Wahhab’s teachers were Rahmatullah Kairanawi, Muhammad Hussein Peshawari and Abdul Latheef. And the scholar who taught these three was Maulana Shah Muhammad Is-haaq.M.Abdul Majeed Baqavi, November 2011, 'அண்ணல் அஃலா ஹள்ரத்(ரஹ்) மற்றும் பாக்கியாத்தின் மஸ்லக்-கொள்கை என்ன? – What was the Maslaq- of A'la Hadrat and Al-Baqiyat As-Salihat?',மனாருல் ஹுதா – Manarul Huda – Tamil Islamic Monthly Magazine, Vol: 2, Issue: 10, Pages 13–21, Registered with the Registrar of Newspaper of India under No. TNTAM/2010/32087 The teacher of Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi in his higher studies was Shah Abdul Ghani. And his teacher was Shah Muhammad Is-haaq. Shah Muhammad Is-haaq's teacher was Shah Abdul Aziz and whose teacher was none other than Shah Waliullah Muhaddith Dehlvi. And thus this common lineage of Wahhab and Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi in Islamic Higher Studies goes as far as Shah Waliullah Muhaddith Dehlvi. Further, in their spiritual studies and journey, Wahhab and Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi are even more closely related. Both their spiritual teacher was none other than Haji Imdadullah Muhaajir Makki. Though these two scholars, Wahhab and Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi, shared a common lineage in the Islamic Studies and Spiritual path, there is no definite proof that these two Islamic Reformers of the Indian Sub-Continent ever met.  Islamic services After completing his studies, Wahhab was offered the post of Deputy Collector when he was visiting Hyderabad. But he turned down the offer.Maulana Nisar Ahmad Fitwhi Baqavi.Mujaddid-e-Junoob, Page 74, cited in மனாருல் ஹுதா – Manarul Huda – Tamil Islamic Monthly Magazine, Vol: 2, Issue: 10, November 2011, Page 11 Returning from Hyderabad, the first thing he did was to make himself financially stable. He sold off his ancestral land in Zameen Attur and bought land in Vellore. This provided him with an income. After he attended to his personal financial statement, he commenced his Islamic Social Services. He visited villages and towns and called Muslims to live their lives according to Shariah and stressed the need for it. When it came to Bid'ah, he vehemently opposed it and voiced against it publicly. In this course, he stayed in Thittachery for a long period and educated the Muslims about Islam and Bid'ah that had crept into their beliefs again and again. Though the people of Thittachery vowed to stay away from Bid'ahs and Shirk, they did it only for a short period. At this juncture, Mohamed Ghouse advised him to start a Madrasa so that graduates could aid him in his Islamic social reforms.S.S.Abdul Cader Baqavi, October 1971, 'Mujaddid', Rahmath, Page 18, Rahmath is a Tamil Islamic Monthly Magazine published from Tirunelveli So he founded the Islamic Madrasa Al-Baqiyat As-Salihat in 1884. He also started the Khanqahey Baqiyat in Vaniambadi, which served as a centre for the Qadiriyya and Chishtiya orders.  Madrasa Al-Baqiyat As-Salihat On the lines of his teacher Rahmatullah Kairanawi, Wahhab started a Madrasa in his house without many resources. Rahmatullah Kairanawi was founding the Madrasa Sawlatiyya in Mecca around that time. There is no reference to the name of this small Madrasa. This Madrasa founded in a small house grew into the Madrasa Al-Baqiyat As-Salihat with a new Syllabus at its present location in 1884 (Hijri 1301). The Madrasa had three objectives. The First was Islamic Education, the second was emphasise and call Muslims towards the Sunnah and the third was to create Service Minded Islamic Scholars who would be steadfast in their fight against Bid'ah or un- Islamic Innovations in Islam. Following the footsteps of his teacher Rahmatullah Kairanawi, who wrote authored the famous Islamic Works, Izhar ul- Haqq, Izalathush Shukook, Izalathul Awham, A'la Hadrat spearheaded the Islamic Da'wah and answering Christians in South India. It is astonishing to find that there was no other Islamic Scholar of his calibre when it came to Islamic Social Reform during the later part of the 19th century or the earlier part of the 20th century in Tamil Nadu.

A  * Abiding Presence - the Spirit of God, which permeates everything. * Absolute - the God principle, the Supreme, the Unknowable, Unthinkable, Unmanifest—yet manifest in all. The Unconditioned, yet in every condition. * Absolute and relative - refers to the Unconditioned Cause and any effect which It may project. * Abstract - in the realm of the formless; apart from any particular object, as in the realm of ideation. Abstract thought is in the higher ranges of thought, rather than in the concrete, as in particular objects. * Abundance - since thought produces fact, then fact must be like the thought which produces it. Hence a thought of impoverishment would create an impoverished condition, while the recognition of abundance would inevitably produce abundance. * Accumulated Consciousness — the sum total of all that one has ever said, thought, done or seen, consciously or un-consciously. * Active ideas of truth - a spiritual treatment is a definite statement, an active state of consciousness created for a definite purpose. * Active right thinking - mental treatment is an active thing; it sets about to demonstrate or prove a certain point in Mind through the definite activity of consciousness. Treatment is always active; it is never day-dreaming. * Adam - undeveloped, or unenlightened man. The opposite of the Christ Principle, as \\"in Adam all sin, so in Christ all are made free from sin\\" (1 Cor. 15:22). * Adam as Christ - the first Adam is of the earth; the second Adam is the Lord from heaven. Adam as Christ means lifting up the principle of Reality within us to a comprehension of its union with Spirit. * Adam Kadmon - in the Kabalah this term means the ONE (son) of the Divine Father. * Affirmation - see supreme affirmation, subconscious denial of our affirmations, tool of affirmation, * Affirmation in mental treatment - affirming the Divine as the only Presence. That is, affirming the presence of whatever ought to be. * Affirmation of truth - any statement which affirms the supremacy of good or which denies the reality of that which is contrary to good. (See also spiritual affirmations; transforming power of thoughts and words. * Affirmative factor - the invisible Power that concentrates primordial substance into new forms. It is the principle of the unfoldment of life through the Intelligence that permeates all space, the very Nature of Being Itself as Subjective Intelligence.

Any doctrine which affirms that all knowledge is relative and uncertain. * Akasha - space, or ether, as a mind principle. * Alchemy - a medieval science, the object of which was to try to transmute base metals into gold. In the life of the metaphysician, the term alchemy is used in referring to the transmutation of the lower nature (that is, the qualities of ruthless selfishness, greed, cruelty, etc.) into the perfect spiritual Form, toward which man is evolving. The uncovering of the God-self, which already exists, potentially, in each one. This alchemy, or transmutation, is an actual chemical change in the cells of the body, through the use of mental law and high spiritual aspiration. * All is mental or spiritual - not only is the invisible Principle of Life a thing of mind and spirit, form also is mental and spiritual. It is Spirit caught in a temporary mold for a definite purpose. * All is mind - all creation is Mind in form and responsive to the Intelligence which creates it. This same Intelligence in us therefore responds to us. Immanuel Kant said that we are able to recognize an apparently external object by reason of the fact that it awakens an intuition within us. * All thought is creative - it would be impossible to assume that one type of thought would be creative without assuming that all types must be. * Alpha and Omega - this symbolizes all that God is—Spirit, Matter.

An agreement between two things in some ways, but not identically. In metaphysical teaching, stories are told which bear a resemblance to the thing being illustrated, in order to clarify the thought on the subject at hand.

The resurrection principle. * Ascetic - one who devotes himself to a solitary and contemplative life; one who practices extreme rigor and self-denial. * Asceticism - refers to the doctrine that the material or carnal world is evil or despicable, and that salvation is gained by mortification of the flesh. * \\"As he thinketh in his heart so is he\\" - as the inner state of consciousness is, so will the condition become. (See also James Allen's As A Man Thinketh) * Assimilation and elimination - metaphysically interpreted, this means the circulation of Truth eliminating anything unlike Itself. * Atomic intelligence - the primary Intelligence inherent in the very substance of things; the Intelligence in the atom that keeps it revolving around its central unit of power. This Intelligence is characterized by responsiveness, which may be made use of in healing work. Every atom in every cell of the body has intelligence. * Atonement - the old Jewish doctrine of redemption through suffering or sacrifice to expiate for a sin. To make amends for an offense. We all atone for wrongdoing, in that the Law of Cause and Effect punishes us until we learn to stop making mistakes. Metaphysical students now realize that the only atonement—that is, the real redemption—is an At-One-Ment with Life Itself, God. Through unity the old accounts are settled and dissolved. (See also Atonement Understood by Annie Rix Militz) * Attachment - to be bound by sense objects, so that it is painful to be without them. * Attraction, Law of - a metaphysical belief that \\"like attracts like\\", that positive and negative thinking bring about positive and negative physical results, respectively. * Automatic writings - written messages received when one is controlled by some psychic influence, which many believe may emanate from oneself, those around one, or discarnate spirits. * Auto suggestion - one's thoughts acting upon one's own mind. * Axiom - a Truth so self-evident that it would be impossible for sanity to contradict it.

That out of which all experience is projected. * Being - in its absolute sense, God, Spirit, Reality. (See also Truth of being.) * Belief, change of - changing our psychological patterns of thought to the acceptance of that which includes the Allness of God, relative to any fact or experience. * Belief is a certain way of thinking - no matter how spiritual the belief or the faith may be, it is still an act of consciousness, hence it can be reduced to a state of thought. * Belief, Law of - belief creates its own law, which is changed only by reversing the belief. * Believe in your heart - refers to the positive inner conviction. * Beloved Son - the divine unique individualization of God which every man is.

Infinite Intelligence refers to limitless capacity consciously to know. * Blood - symbol of Divine Life manifesting Itself on the physical plane. * Body is mental and spiritual - body is not to be denied; we are to affirm that body is a combination of spiritual ideas harmoniously expressing life. * Body of Christ - the Body of Christ is the immortal individuality within us, manifesting Itself on any particular plane upon which we may be living.

Since limitation is a limited viewpoint of Reality, a greater viewpoint automatically heals the limitation. Thus, we are apparently bound and actually set free by one and the same Law. * Bowl of acceptance - refers to our mental attitudes, which, as it were, are held up that the outpouring horn of plenty may fill them. * Bread of Heaven - the Truth as spiritual food for the soul. (See also \\"I am the bread of life.\\") * Breath - the Life of all beings; symbolic of spiritual action which breathes thought into form and withdraws form into thought. The word Spirit comes from the Latin word spiro, meaning breath. We read in the Bible that \\"God breathed into man the Breath of Life, and man became a living being.\\" To breathe is to live. Every living thing is a part of the Great Breath, from the very plants, up through the animal kingdom, to man. The breath is a part of the Action of God in man and is quite beyond man's control. In ancient teachings we are told the Great Breath was the beginning of life and energy on the planet. \\"And the Spirit of God [the Breath] moved upon the waters.\\" * Burning bush - refers to the thought that all nature is alive with the Divine Presence. It is the recognition of this Divine Presence which causes the voice to proceed from nature. That is, we commune with God through nature.

Evidence from eyetracking, event-related potentials, and other experimental methods indicates that in addition to integrating each subsequent word into the context formed by previously encountered words, language users may, under certain conditions, try to predict upcoming words. In particular, prediction seems to occur regularly when the context of a sentence greatly limits the possible words that have not yet been revealed. For instance, a person listening to a sentence like, \\"In the summer it is hot, and in the winter it is...\\" would be highly likely to predict the sentence completion \\"cold\\" in advance of actually hearing it. A form of prediction is also thought to occur in some types of lexical priming, a phenomenon whereby a word becomes easier to process if it is preceded by a related word.Neely, J. (1991). Semantic priming in visual word recognition: a selective review of current theories and findings. In: Basic processes in reading: visual word recognition (Besner D, Humphreys GW, eds), pp 264 –336. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum Associates. Linguistic prediction is an active area of research in psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience. Evidence from eyetracking Visual world paradigms In the eyetracking visual world paradigm, experimental subjects listen to a sentence while staring at an array of pictures on a computer monitor. Their eye movements are recorded, allowing the experimenter to understand how language influences eye movements toward pictures related to the content of the sentence. Experiments of this type have shown that while listening to the verb in a sentence, comprehenders anticipatorily move their eyes to the picture of the verb's likely direct object (e.g. \\"cake\\" rather than \\"ball\\" while hearing, \\"The boy will eat...\\").Altmann, G. & Kamide, Y. (1999). Incremental interpretation at verbs: restricting the domain of subsequent reference. Cognition, 73, 247–264. Subsequent investigations using the same experimental setup showed that the verb's subject can also determine which object comprehenders anticipate (e.g., comprehenders look at the merry-go-round rather than the motorcycle while hearing, \\"The little girl will ride...\\").Kamide, Y., Altmann, G. & Haywood, S. (2003). The time-course of prediction in incremental sentence process- ing: evidence from anticipatory eye movements. Journal of Memory and Language, 49, 133–159. In short, comprehenders use the information in the sentence context to predict the meanings of upcoming words. In these experiments, comprehenders used the verb and its subject to activate information about the verb's direct object before hearing that word. However, another experiment has shown that in a language with more flexible word order (German), comprehenders can also use context to predict the sentence's subject.Kamide, Y., Scheepers, C. & Altmann, G. (2003). Integration of Syntactic and Semantic Information in Predictive Processing: Cross-Linguistic Evidence from German and English. Journal of Psycholinguistic Research, 32 (1), 37-55. Natural reading Eyetracking technology has also been used to monitor readers' eye movements while they read text on a computer screen. Data from this kind of experiment has supported the hypothesis that readers use contextual information to predict upcoming words during natural reading. Specifically, readers fixate their eyes on a word for a shorter time when the word occurs in a moderately or highly constraining context, compared to the same word in an unconstrained context. This is true regardless of the word's frequency or length. Readers are also more likely to skip over a word in a highly constraining context only.Rayner, K. & Well, A. (1996). Effects of contextual constraint on eye movements in reading: A further examination. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 3 (4), 504-509. Subsequent investigations of reading in the Chinese logographic script have shown that despite the large differences between the Chinese and English orthographies, readers exploit contextual information for prediction in similar ways, with the exception that Chinese readers were more likely to skip words in moderately constraining contexts.Rayner, K., Li, X., Juhasz, B. & Yan, G. (2005). The effect of word predictability on the eye movements of Chinese readers. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review, 12 (6), 1089-1093.

Evidence from event-related potentials M100 The M100 discussed here is the magnetic equivalent of the visual N1 potential—an event-related potential linked to visual processing and attention. The M100 was also linked to prediction in language comprehension in a series of event-related magnetoencephalography (MEG) experiments. In these experiments, participants read words whose visual forms were either predictable or unpredictable based on prior linguistic contextDikker, S., Rabagliati, H., Farmer, T. & Pylkkänen, L. (2010). Early occipital sensitivity to syntactic category is based on form typicality. Psychological Science, 21(5), 629-634.Dikker, S., Rabagliati, H. & Pylkkänen, L. (2009). Sensitivity to syntax in visual cortex. Cognition, 110 (3), 293-321. or based on a recently seen picture.Dikker, S. & Pylkkänen, L. (2011). Before the N400: Effects of lexical–semantic violations in visual cortex. Brain and Language 118, 23-28. The predictability of the word's visual form (but not the predictability of its meaning) affected the amplitude of the M100. There is ongoing controversy about whether this M100 effect is related to the early left anterior negativity (eLAN), an event-related potential response to words that is theorized to reflect the brain's assignment of local phrase structure.Friederici, A. & Weissenborn, J. (2007). Mapping sentence form onto meaning: The syntax-semantic interface. Brain Research, 1146, 50-58. P2 The P2 component is generally thought to reflect higher-order perceptual processing and its modulation by attention. However, it has also been linked to prediction of visual word forms. The P2 response to words in highly constraining contexts is often larger than the P2 response to words in less constraining contexts. When experimental participants read words that are presented to the left or right of their visual fixation (stimulating the opposite hemisphere of the brain first), the larger P2 for words in highly constraining contexts is observed only for right visual field presentation (targeting left hemisphere).Wlotko, E. & Federmeier, K. (2007). Finding the right word: Hemispheric asymmetries in the use of sentence context information. Neuropsychologia, 45, 3001-3014. This is consistent with the PARLO hypothesis that linguistic prediction is mainly a function of the left hemisphere, discussed below. N400 The N400 is part of the normal ERP response to potentially meaningful stimuli, whose amplitude is inversely correlated with the predictability of a stimuli in a particular context.Kutas, M., & Hillyard, S. A., (1984). Brain Potentials during reading reflect word expectancy and semantic association. Nature, 307, 161-163. In sentence processing, the predictability of a word is established by two related factors: 'cloze probability' and 'sentential constraint'. Cloze probability reflects the expectancy of a target word given the context of the sentence, which is determined by the percentage of individuals who supply the word when completing a sentence whose final word is missing. Kutas and colleagues found that the N400 to sentences final words with cloze probability of 90% was smaller (i.e., more positive) than the N400 for words with cloze probability of 70%, which was then smaller for words with cloze probability of 30%. Closely related, sentential constraint reflects the degree to which the context of the sentence constrains the number of acceptable continuations. Whereas cloze probability is the percent of individuals who choose a particular word, constraint is the number of different words chosen by a representative sample of individuals. Although words that are not predicted elicit a larger N400, the N400 to unpredicted words that are semantically related to the predicted word elicit a smaller N400 than when the unpredicted words are semantically unrelated. When the sentence context is highly constraining, semantically related words receive further facilitation in that the N400 to semantically related words is smaller in high constraint sentences than in low constraint sentences.Federmeier, K. D., & Kutas, M. (1999). Right words and left words: electrophysiological evidence for hemispheric differences in meaning processing. Cognitive Brain Research, 8, 373-392.Federmeier, K. D., McLennan, D. B., De Ochoa, E., Kutas, M. (2002). The impact of semantic memory organization and sentence context information on spoken language processing by younger and older adults: an ERP study. Psychophysiology, 39, 133-146.Federmeier, K. D. (2007). Thinking ahead: the role and roots of prediction in language comprehension. Psychophysiology, 44, 491-505. Evidence for the prediction of specific words comes from a study by DeLong et al.DeLong, K. A., Urbach, T. P., Kutas, M. (2005). Probabilistic word pre-activation during language comprehension inferred from electrical brain activity. Nature Neuroscience, 8, 1117-1145. DeLong and colleagues took advantage of the use of different indefinite articles, 'A' and 'AN' for English words that begin with a consonant or vowel respectively. They found that when the most probable sentence completion began with a consonant, the N400 was larger for 'AN' than for 'A' and vice versa, suggesting that prediction occurs at both a semantic and lexical level during language processing. (The study never replicated. In the most recent multi-lab attempt (335 participants), no evidence for word form prediction was found (Niewland et al., 2018). Late positivity =P300= The P300, specifically the P3b is an ERP response to improbable stimuli and is sensitive to the subjective probability that a particular stimulus will occur. The P300 has been closely tied to context updating, which can be initiated by unexpected stimuli.Donchin, E., & Coles, M. G. H., (1988). Is the P300 component a manifestation of context updating? The Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 11, 357–374. =P600= The P600 an ERP response to syntactic violations, as well as complex, but error free, language.Osterhout, L., & Holcomb, P. J. (1992). Event-related brain potentials elicited by syntactic anomaly. Journal of Memory and Language, 31(6), 785-806.Friederici, A. D., Hahne, A., & Mecklinger, A. (1996). Temporal structure of syntactic parsing: early and late event-related brain potential effects. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 22, 1219-1248. A P600-like response is also observed for thematically implausible sentences: example, \\"For breakfast, the eggs would only EAT toast and jam\\".Kuperberg, G. R., Sitnikova, T., Caplan, D., Holcomb, P. (2003). Electrophysiological distinctions in processing conceptual relationships within simple sentences. Cognitive Brain Research, 17, 117-129. Both P600 responses are generally attributed to the process of revising or continuing the analysis of the sentence.Kuperberg, G. R. (2007). Neural mechanisms of language comprehension: challenges to syntax. Brain Research, 1146, 23-49. The syntactic P600 has been compared to the P300 in that both responses are sensitive to similar manipulations; importantly, the probability of the stimulus.Coulson, S., King, J. W., & Kutas, M. (1998). Expect the unexpected: event-related brain response to morphosyntactic violations. Language and Cognitive Processes, 13, 21-58. The similarity between the two responses may suggest that the P300 significantly contributes to the syntactic P600 response. =Post-N400 positivity= A late positivity is often observed subsequent to the N400. Recent meta-analysis of the ERP literature on language processing has identified two different Post-N400 Positivities.Van Petten, C., Luka, B. J., Prediction during language comprehension: Benefits, costs, and ERP components. International Journal of Psychophsiology. (2011). In comparing the Post-N400 Positivity (PNP) for congruent and incongruent sentence final words, a parietal PNP is observed for incongruent words. This parietal PNP is similar to the typical P600 response, suggesting continued or revised analysis. Within the congruent condition, when comparing high- and low-cloze probability sentence final words, a PNP response (if it is observed) is generally distributed across the front of the scalp. A recent study has shown that the frontal PNP may reflect processing an unexpected lexical item instead of an unexpected concept, suggesting that the frontal PNP reflects disconfirmed lexical predictions. Evidence from functional imaging Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that uses nuclear magnetic resonance to measure blood oxygenation levels in the brain and spinal cord. Because neural activity affects blood flow, the pattern of the hemodynamic response is thought to correspond closely to the pattern of neural activity. The fine spatial resolution afforded by fMRI allows cognitive neuroscientists to see in detail which areas of the brain are activated in relation to an experimental task. However, the hemodynamic response is much slower than the neural activity measured by EEG and MEG. This poor sensitivity to timing information makes fMRI a less useful technique than EEG or eyetracking for studying linguistic prediction. One exception is an fMRI test of the differences in neural activation between strategic and automatic semantic priming. When the time between the prime and the target word is short (around 150 milliseconds), priming is theorized to rely on automatic neural processes. However, at longer time intervals (approaching 1 second), it is thought that experimental subjects strategically predict related upcoming words and suppress unrelated words, leading to a processing penalty in the event that an unrelated word actually occurs. An fMRI test of this hypothesis showed that at longer intervals, the processing penalty for an incorrect prediction is related to heightened activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus and Broca's area.Gold, B., Balota, D., Jones, S., Powell, D., Smith, C., & Andersen, A. (2006). Dissociation of Automatic and Strategic Lexical-Semantics: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Evidence for Differing Roles of Multiple Frontotemporal Regions. Journal of Neuroscience, 26 (24), 6523-6532.  Theories of prediction   PARLO theory The PARLO (\\"Production Affects Reception in Left Only\\") framework is a theory of the neural domains supporting language prediction. It is based on evidence that shows that the left and right hemispheres differentially contribute to language comprehension. Generally, the neural structures that support language production are predominantly in the left hemisphere for most individuals creating a hemispheric asymmetry, which results in differential language processing abilities of the two hemispheres. Because of its spatially close ties and integration with language production, left hemisphere language comprehension seems to be driven by expectancy and context in a top-down manner, whereas the right hemisphere seems to integrate information in a bottom-up manner. The PARLO framework suggests that both prediction and integration occur during language processing but rely on the distinct contributions of the two hemispheres of the brain.  Surprisal theory  The surprisal theory is a theory of sentence processing based on information theory.Levy, R. (2008). Expectation-based syntactic comprehension. Cognition, 106(3), 1126-1177. In the surprisal theory, the cost of processing a word is determined by its self-information, or how predictable the word is, given its context. A highly probable word carries a small amount of self-information and would therefore be processed easily, as measured by reduced reaction time, a smaller N400 response, or reduced fixation times in an eyetracking reading study. Empirical tests of this theory have shown a high degree of match between processing cost measures and the self-information values assigned to words.Levy, R., Fedorenko, E., Breen, M. and Gibson, T. (2011). The processing of extraposed structures in English. Cognition, 122(1), 12-36.Levy, R. (2011).

He served as the governor of Najran Province (2009–2013) and then as the governor of Mecca Province (2013–2015). Early life and education Prince Mishaal bin Abdullah was born on 25 November 1970 in Riyadh. He is the sixth son of King Abdullah. His mother is Tathi bint Mishan al Faisal al Jarba (al Jarbah), a member of the Iraqi branch of the Shammar tribe. He has six blood siblings, including Turki bin Abdullah and Oraib bint Abdullah, wife of Salman bin Abdulaziz. Prince Mishaal received a bachelor of arts degree in political science from King Saud University in 1995. He has a PhD in political science. Early career Mishaal bin Abdullah started his career as the director of the computer department of the National Guard, and served there from 1997 to 2003. Then, he was appointed the minister plenipotentiary with a third rank at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs beginning on 22 August 2003. Next, he became minister plenipotentiary at the same ministry ranked fourteenth on 12 February 2006. He was also an adviser at the Saudi royal court. In November 2006, he led Saudi Arabia's delegation to a meeting of UN General Assembly. Governorship Prince Mishaal was appointed the Governor of Najran Province on 1 April 2009. It is reported that the Province witnessed considerable progress following his appointment. He warned public and private agencies on 18 November 2011 that he would monitor service projects that have been carried out in the province and take punitive action against negligent companies and officials. His appointment to Najran Province is commonly regarded as King Abdullah's positive gesture towards the Ismailis residing in the province. Mishaal bin Abdullah was one of the advisors of late Crown Prince Nayef. The other two were Mohammed bin Fahd and Faisal bin Khalid. On 22 December 2013, Prince Mishaal was appointed governor of Mecca Province, replacing Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud in the post.Saudi King Appoints Son as New Mecca Governor Boston, 22 December 2013. He was released from this position by King Salman on 29 January 2015, six days after his father's death. Khalid bin Faisal Al Saud replaced Prince Mishaal in the post. The latter was made an advisor to the king on the same date. Reasons for his appointment as governor of Najran Province In the Najran Province, the south of Saudi Arabia, the small Saudi Ismaili minority (population approximately 400,000) experienced systematic discrimination after the appointment of the highly conservative Mishaal bin Saud in 1996. During his tenure, Ismailis' religious freedoms were curtailed such as the closure of mosques, the arrest of clerics and restrictions on religious schooling for young Ismailis. As a result, the Ismailis thought that it was under siege and began to arm itself in case of an attack upon its religious leader, Da’i al-Mutlaq (the Absolute Guide), at his home in Najran. Despite the fact that the Ismailis are the majority of the population of Najran, they hold only a tiny minority of all senior government posts. Moreover, the Saudi government pursued a policy of naturalising Yemeni Sunnis from the Hadramawt region of Yemen, providing them with land plots, letting them to carry weapons and allegedly turning a blind eye to attacks upon Ismailis. This policy would appear to be remarkably short-sighted in that many of the tribes invited to live in Najran have been the most fertile recruiting ground for al-Qaeda in Yemen. Due to these negative events, tension between local authorities and the Ismaili population increased, resulting in a confrontation between armed Ismaili demonstrators and police and army units outside the Holiday Inn hotel in Najran city in April 2000. As a result of domestic and international reactions, King Abdullah fired Mishaal bin Saud as governor of Najran Province in late 2008 and appointed his son, Prince Mishaal, in April 2009. Mishaal bin Abdullah who has acquired a reputation for his intellect and diligence in working to reduce poverty in Saudi Arabia began a programme to address the social and economic grievances of the Ismaili community, including the distribution of land to previously dispossessed Ismailis. Controversy and detention On 27 March 2012, Mishaal bin Abdullah was reported to ask the ministry of culture and information to investigate the programs of a satellite TV channel which allegedly provoked sectarianism and harmed the national unity due to the fact that the channel aired a program that allegedly aimed to divide the residents of the region along sectarian lines. A speaker on the related TV channel made negative comments against the people of Najran Province along sectarian lines. Upon his request, an investigation was started. Then Saudi minister of culture and information, Abdul Aziz Khoja, declared that such provocations of sectarianism were against national unity and cannot be tolerated. In November 2017 Mishaal bin Abdullah was detained together with other senior members of the royal family. They were held at Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh. He was released in December 2017 following the undisclosed financial settlement with the Saudi government. Personal life Prince Mishaal married Luluwah bint Nawaf bin Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Abdulrahman Al Saud in January 2009. He secondly got married on 10 May 2012 to Princess Nouf bint Bandar Al Saud, and has twin daughters, Seeta and Mashael. Prince Mishaal is an honorary member of Al-Hilal FC.

It is mainly used for the evaluation of nuclear medicine imaging data after the injection of a labeled ligand that binds reversibly to specific receptor or enzyme. In conventional compartmental analysis, an iterative method is used to fit the individual model parameters in the solution of a compartmental model of specific configuration to the measurements with a measured plasma time- activity curve that serves as an forcing (input) function, and the binding of the tracer can then be described. Graphical analysis is a simplified method that transforms the model equations into a linear equation evaluated at multiple time points and provides fewer parameters (i.e., slope and intercept). Although the slope and the intercept can be interpreted in terms of a combination of model parameters if a compartmental model configuration is assumed, the graphical methods are independent of any specific model configuration. In case of irreversible tracers, certain fraction of the radioactivity is trapped in the tissue or the binding site during the course of the experiment, whereas reversible tracers show uptake and loss from all compartments throughout the study. The theoretical foundation of graphical analysis for irreversible tracers (also called Patlak graphical analysis or Patlak plot) was laid by Clifford Patlak and his colleagues at NIH. Based on the original work of Patlak, Jean Logan and her colleagues from Brookhaven National Laboratory extended the method to tracers with reversible kinetics.  Description  The kinetics of radiolabeled compounds in a compartmental system can be described in terms of a set of first-order, constant- coefficient, ordinary differential equations. The time course of the activity in the multicompartmental system driven by a metabolite-corrected plasma input function C_p(t) can be described by: : \\\\frac{d\\\\mathbf{A}}{dt} = \\\\mathbf{KA} + \\\\mathbf{Q}C_p(t) where \\\\mathbf{A} is a column vector of activity concentration for each compartment at time t, \\\\mathbf{K} is the matrix of the transfer constants between compartments, and \\\\mathbf{Q} is the vector of plasma-to- tissue transfer constants. Patlak and Blasberg showed that the above equation can be written as: : \\\\int_0^t A(\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau = -\\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\int_0^t C_p(\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau + \\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{A} where \\\\mathbf{U}_n^T represents a row vector of 1s and A(t) = \\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{A}. The total activity in the region of interest, \\\\mathrm{ROI}(t), is a combination of radioactivities from all compartments plus a plasma volume fraction (V_p) and thus: : \\\\int_0^t \\\\mathrm{ROI}(\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau = (-\\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Q} +V_p) \\\\int_0^t C_p(\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau + \\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{A} By dividing both sides by \\\\mathrm{ROI}(t), one obtains the following linear equation: : {{\\\\int_0^t \\\\mathrm{ROI}(\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau} \\\\over \\\\mathrm{ROI}(t)} = (-\\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Q} +V_p) {{\\\\int_0^t C_p(\\\\tau) \\\\, d\\\\tau} \\\\over \\\\mathrm{ROI}(t)} + {{\\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{A}} \\\\over {\\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}} For t > t', Patlak and his colleagues showed that \\\\mathbf{A} = -\\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Q} C_p(t), i.e., the steady-state condition. When this condition is satisfied, the intercept has reached its constant value so that after some time a plot of {{\\\\int_{0}^{t} C_p(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau} \\\\over \\\\mathrm{ROI}(t)} versus {{\\\\int_{0}^{t} \\\\mathrm{ROI}(\\\\tau)d\\\\tau} \\\\over \\\\mathrm{ROI}(t)} becomes a straight line with slope (-\\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{Q} + V_p) and intercept {{\\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{K}^{-1} \\\\mathbf{A}} \\\\over {\\\\mathbf{U}_n^T \\\\mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}. For a catenary two-tissue compartment model with transfer constants K_1 (forward transport from plasma to tissue), k_2 (reverse transport from tissue to plasma), k_3 (binding parameter proportional to B_\\\\max k_\\\\mathrm{on}), and k_4 (dissociation constant) to analyze enzyme or receptor system, the slope represents the total distribution volume (V_d) and is given by \\\\frac{K_1}{k_2}(1+\\\\frac{k_3}{k_4}) + V_p, where k_3 = B_\\\\max k_\\\\mathrm{on}, k_4 = k_\\\\mathrm{off}, \\\\frac{k_3}{k_4} = \\\\frac{B_\\\\max}{K_d}, and K_d = k_\\\\mathrm{off}/k_\\\\mathrm{on}, in which B_\\\\max is the concentration of ligand binding sites, K_d is the equilibrium dissociation constant for the ligand-binding site complex, k_\\\\mathrm{on} is the ligand-binding association constant, k_\\\\mathrm{off} is the ligand-binding dissociation constant. For a one-tissue compartment model with transfer constants K_1 and k_2, the slope is \\\\lambda + V_p, where \\\\lambda is the partition coefficient ({K_1}/{k_2}) and the intercept is \\\\frac{-1}{k_2(1+V_p/\\\\lambda)}.

G. Ramachandran in leading dual roles, Latha, Manjula, M. N. Nambiar and Sharada in supporting roles. It is a remake of the 1970 Hindi film Sachaa Jhutha. Plot Sundaram (M. G. Ramachandran) is an innocent band musician who lives with his physically challenged sister Sita (Sharada) in a village. He needs more money for his sister's marriage and he sets off to Madras to earn. On the other hand, Madras city Police department is shocked by a series of diamond thefts. But Inspector Mohan (M. N. Nambiar) suspects the thief to be Ranjith Kumar (M. G. Ramachandran), who is actually a wealthy diamond businessman on the account that whenever a theft occurs, he is present there. But he has no evidence and searches for it. He creates a plan with Leela (Manjula) to attract Ranjith to know his secret plans. Sundaram arrives in the city and goes to a party hall. Ranjith, who arrives at the party is surprised to see Sunadaram as he looks identical to him. He immediately makes a plan. He takes Sundaram to his place and reveals himself. He convinces Sundaram to act like Ranjith in front of society as he is a heart patient and requires a treatment. Until his return from treatment, Sundaram has to make believe to everybody that he is Ranjith. Actually, he makes him as Ranjith so that he can continue with his diamond smuggling; meanwhile, there will not be any evidence as Sundaram is going to be Ranjith everywhere. But he did not reveal the reason to him. He also promises that he would give money for his sister's marriage. Innocent Sundaram believes him and agrees to the plan. Ranjith's girlfriend Mohana (Latha) trains Sundaram to be like Ranjith and he acts like him. Sundaram finally learns every mannerism of Ranjith and at an instance he behaves like Ranjith to Ranjith. He acts as Ranjith in the city and real Ranjith continues his underground work. Inspector Mohan cannot come to a conclusion. Leela moves intimately with Sundaram thinking of him as Ranjith, but Sundaram falls in love with her. In the village, due to heavy floods, Sita loses everything and comes in search of her brother to Madras with her dog Mothy (Rexy). Mohana meets Sita and helps her to reach the place. In one situation, Mohan saves her from them and takes her to his home. Mohana, who follows Sita to Mohan's house, informs Ranjith about her. Ranjith, posing like her brother, goes to Mohan's home and takes her with him. Sundaram finds Ranjith is actually a thief and plans a grand diamond loot. Sundaram resists the plan, but Ranjith blackmails him with his sister. Unwillingly, he accepts the plan. Ranjith steals a huge amount of diamonds, but Sundaram replaces him by attacking him and leaves the place. One of the stolen diamond pieces has a transmitter and police follow the jewels with the help of it. Sita is confused as to who is her brother among them. After several fights, both Sundaram and Ranjith are arrested. Both of them claim to be Sundaram and confuse everyone. Many tests to find who is real Ranjith fail. Confused by this, the court is helpless to find out who is the real Ranjith. Suddenly a body of a dead woman enters the court. Ranjith finds that the woman is his mother (Kanthimathi). Unable to resist his feelings he screams at his mother and cries on her body. Court finally concludes who is Ranjith. But Ranjith's mother is not dead, but pretended to be, to find out who is her son. Ranjith is arrested and sent to prison. He apologizes to Sundaram and promises Mohana that he will marry her after he got out from prison. Sita finally marries Inspector Mohan. Cast *M. G.

The 2011 Derbyshire Dales District Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of Derbyshire Dales District Council in Derbyshire, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. Election result The Conservatives increased their majority on the council after winning 28 seats at the election in May. They gained 4 seats from the Liberal Democrats, more than offsetting losing 1 seat to Labour. This meant Labour went up by one to five seats, while the Liberal Democrats dropped to four, losing half of the seats they had won in 2007, and there remained one independent. Overall turnout at the election was 50.8%. The Conservatives gained 4 seats from the Liberal Democrats in the wards of Darley Dale, Matlock All Saints and Matlock St Giles. However the Conservatives did lose 1 seat to Labour in Masson, by a 5-vote margin. In total of the 38 seats elected in May, 15 new councillors were elected. The election in Stanton ward was delayed until 23 June after no candidates were nominated for the seat originally. At the delayed election the Conservatives held the seat and therefore had 29 of the 39 councillors. 7 Conservative candidates were unopposed at the election. The above results include the delayed election for Stanton ward. Ward results Stanton delayed election The election in Stanton was delayed until 23 June 2011 after no candidates originally stood for the seat at the May election.

Recently, PetroVietnam has been concerned. The Ministry of Defence has assigned the Vietnam People's Navy and Vietnam Marine Police the responsibility to protect oil and gas activities in Vietnamese territorial waters. If oil and gas resources are owned by Vietnam, Vietnam will protect those areas at any cost. Vietnam is a member of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), Vietnam implements its membership responsibilities, and asks others to do the same. All members must uphold UNCLOS.

Modern ships will be equipped to launch rescue activities capable of providing first aid to more than 100 people. Capacity building for the staff is also among his priorities.

Grass Manual Treatment. Retrieved 12-12-2011. It is also present in Argentina. This species is an annual or perennial grass producing tufts of stems up to long, lying prostrate, spreading, or standing erect. The inflorescence has up to 11 branches, each a dense row of up to 40 spikelets. The fruit weighs about 0.03 milligrams. This lightweight seed is dispersed on the wind and by animals. It is annual or perennial, sprouting from seed or from its root crown after summer rainfall. Flowering usually begins around July and lasts until October. There are three varieties of this species. The var. barbata is an annual plant with decumbent stems that may root at stem nodes, var. rothrockii, sometimes considered a separate species, is perennial with erect stems, and var. sonorae, which is limited to northern Mexico, spreads via stolons. This grass grows in many types of habitat including prairie, grasslands, pinyon-juniper woodland, chaparral, creosote, shrubsteppe, savanna, and Ponderosa pine forest. It is a resident of dry regions. It grows in the deserts of the American southwest and Mexico, including the Colorado, Mojave, and Chihuahuan Deserts. It can also be found in dry disturbed habitat such as roadsides, railroads, and overgrazed pastures. While it is palatable, this grass is not considered a good forage for livestock, as it is a small plant and is green for a short time. Many types of other animals utilize it, however. Many birds, and small animals including prairie dogs and desert kangaroo rats eat the seeds of this and other grama grasses. Harvester ants in Arizona also eat the seeds of this species.

The idea was immediately supported by the Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs Uffe Ellemann-Jensen and EU Commissioner Henning Christophersen, and a draft paper on the creation of a Euro-faculty was accepted at the founding CBSS meeting with the implicit expectation that the Western member states as well as the EU would become donors to the faculty. The faculty, under the name EuroFaculty, was (like the CBSS) established by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs (MFAs) in the enthusiastic atmosphere surrounding the regained independence of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. However, the CBSS as well as the EuroFaculty were decided upon without subsequent parliamentary approval, and without an official legal status, thus being, broadly speaking, based on the personal friendships which developed among MFAs during the fight for freedom of the Baltic states. Unfortunately, the core group of MFAs behind the CBSS (and the EuroFaculty) left office within a year after the creation of the CBSS. The idea about creating a “Euro- faculty” was saved by the personal engagement of Franz Peter Küpper from the European Commission, who guided the EuroFaculty to obtaining EU support in the first years. It was also helpful that the German contribution came through Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, (DAAD), which was efficient as donor due to its position as (relatively) independent of political changes. Structure The EuroFaculty had its headquarters at the University of Latvia in Riga, and was besides organized with sections, at each of the universities in Tartu, Riga, and Vilnius. Connected to the EuroFaculty project were the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga and the Riga Graduate School of Law. The board of the EuroFaculty (the steering committee) was composed of members representing the EU and the CBSS member countries, and was chaired by (among others) the Danish professor Nikolaj Petersen and later by the Latvian professor Baiba Rivža. An academic committee representing the universities of the member countries was chaired by the German rector of Greifswald University, Jürgen Kohler, one of the leading personalities behind the Bologna declaration. Foreign professors came from Denmark, Norway, the United Kingdom, Finland, Sweden, the U.S., the Netherlands, and Germany. Including local teaching associates, student teaching assistants, student research assistants and three vice-directors, the EuroFaculty annually employed around 100 people. Defiance As the EuroFaculty's first director, the Estonian-Canadian professor Toivo Miljan had to build up the EuroFaculty from the very bottom. The EuroFaculty suffered from a lack of legality which could only be ignored during the pioneering period. He ended up being forced away by the European Commission because of his anti-bureaucratic attitude. New waves changed the rules, and the idea that the EU would support the EuroFaculty in line with the Baltic Sea donor countries was subsequently derailed. Toivo Miljan's successor was the Norwegian professor Arild Saether. During his time as director real academic progress became apparent, as the EuroFaculty students performed brilliantly internationally and the EuroFaculty gained increasing prestige. The EuroFaculty became recognized as the strongest institution for substantial pan-Baltic cooperation. However, Arild Saether was caught up in a Sisyphus fight with the many-headed donor corps composed of national states, which, good in will, but weak in action, made his job feel impossible to cope with and to implement, and consequently he decided to leave office. The Danish economist Gustav N. Kristensen subsequently became director of a mature and successful EuroFaculty, which in spite of financial difficulties would reap the fruits of systematic work during many years. In their capacity as observer countries of the CBSS, the Netherlands joined the EuroFaculty and provided teachers. Likewise, the U.S. made a highly efficient support to the EuroFaculty by its Fulbright Program. Results The EuroFaculty successfully attracted a large number of outstanding Baltic students to its programs and made a significant impact on the Baltic university system. A former EuroFaculty student, Kaspars Balodis, became dean of law at the University of Latvia in 2002 and later, in 2006, judge at the Constitutional Court in Latvia. Another EuroFaculty student, Vytautas Nekrošius, became dean of law at Vilnius University in 2003. The EuroFaculty delivered highly qualified staff to the national banks and the Central Administration in the Baltic states, as well as to the World Trade Organization and the World Bank. Several members of the Baltic parliaments are former EuroFaculty students. One of the EuroFaculty's first students, Nils Ushakovs became Mayor of Riga in 2009. Baiba Rivža became Minister of Education and Science in Latvia in 2006. Vjačeslavs Dombrovskis, Latvian Minister of Education and Science, is also a EuroFaculty alumnus and former teaching assistant. The EuroFaculty set up the Baltic Journal of Economics during its period of leadership in Baltic research within social sciences. In May 2004, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania became members of the European Union. This new structure led to the closing down of the EuroFaculty Tartu-Riga-Vilnius in 2005. A major reason for the success of the EuroFaculty was the fascination in Western Europe and America for the three Baltic states and the enthusiasm surrounding their regained independence. Outside the EU a EuroFaculty was later established in Kaliningrad (2000–2007) and in Pskov (2009 and onwards). Sources Kristensen, Gustav N. 2010. Born into a Dream.

Early years  Arnamnart was born in Wahroonga, New South Wales. He was educated at Asquith Boys High School. Arnamnart completed at the 2006 Australian Short Course Swimming Championships reaching the finals of all three backstroke events. He finished 5th in 50 metres, 4th in the 200 metres and won the bronze medal in the 100 metre event finishing behind the winner in all three events Matt Welsh. On the back of these results he was named in the team of 30 to represent Australia at the second edition of the Junior Pan Pacific Swimming Championships held in Maui, Hawaii, in January 2007. At that event, he won the 100 metre backstroke in 54.99 seconds a new Under 17's Australian record. He also won two more gold medals when he teamed up Bobby Jovanovich, Robert Hurley and Reece Turner to take out the 4x100-metre freestyle relay and with James Stacey, Sam Ashby and Bobby Jovanovich to win the 4x100-metre medley relay. At the conclusion of the event, he was named the swimmer of the meet.  Senior career   London Olympics  Daniel Arnamnart qualified for the 2012 Olympics by winning silver medal in the 100-metre backstroke at the Australian Swimming Championships in Adelaide with a time of 54.05. At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Arnamnart competed in the preliminary heats of the 100-metre backstroke, and finished with the 16th-best time overall, qualifying for the semifinals. In the semifinals, his time was not fast enough to qualify for the final.

Biography Family and early life He was the second born out of the six children of Felix Sturzo Taranto and Catherine Boscarelli, among his brothers, ten years younger, was Luigi Sturzo. He joined the well known seminary at a very young age where he knew Bishop Blandini known for his social commitment. In 1881 he inscribed in the Law Faculty of Catania. and then continued his legal studies in Rome. In his youth he was the president and the chief promoter of the Catholic Youth Club \\"St. Thomas Aquinas\\", whereby lay Catholics gathered. Priesthood In 1887, at the age of 26, returned to the seminary in Caltagirone and September 21, 1889, was ordained a priest by Xavier Gerbino, previously the Bishop of Piazza Armerina. He was rector of the seminary of Caltagirone in 1890-1891 and among his pupils was his brother Luigi, whom he helped to reach priesthood. He was later appointed canon of the Cathedral of Caltagirone and then vicar general. In 1894 he coordinated the work of the first diocesan synod. In his priestly activity he collaborated with his brother Louis to promote the Catholic movement Calatino. In 1895 the first interparochial committee of organization of congresses in St. George’s parish, with the youth section “St. Philip Neri”, the workers section, St. Joseph\\" and the agricultural section, “St. Isidor”. In 1897 he collaborated in the redaction of the Catholic movement Calatino review, “The Cross of Constantine”, in which he published three novels of the popular-moralistic character with the pseudonymEneleo in the appendix. Moreover, he wrote 27 sketches which highlight his initial inclination for Christianity embodied in the story. Activities as a bishop In 1903 Pope Leo XIII appointed him Bishop of Piazza Armerina and was consecrated in the cathedral of Catania by Cardinal Francesco Nava July 19, took possession of the diocese on 11 October and made the solemn entry on 15 November 1904. In his first pastoral letter, of November 1903, he maintains, on the wake of the thought of his brother Luigi’s thought, that, for obtaining salvation of souls one cannot ignore so as to pursue interests of the body, through a commitment in the renewal of the society in the light of the social teaching of the church. He realized a general reorganization of the diocesan clergy and erected numerous parishes in almost all the twelve town councils of the diocese. He refounded the diocesan monthly bulletin, changing the title from “Gleaning” to “The Angel of the Family”. His episcopal activities were carried on, in the periodic pastoral visits, in the celebration of meetings of “Catholic Action”, in the Lenten preachings and retreats and in the conference for teachers and professionals. He reformed morally and materially the diocesan seminary, closed temporarily from 1904 to 1907 and from 1920 he started his activity of teaching in the internal school of the seminary. He founded in the diocese the priestly congregation of the Oblates of Mary, on the example required by Carlo Borromeo, for which he laid the constitutions and of which he organized the common life. In the villages of his diocese he favoured the rise of rural banks and other Catholic Social works. Some local officials accused him to the Holy See of modernism and socialism and was sent to the diocese as apostolic visitor, Charles Joseph Cecchini, who wrote to pope Pius X on 19 August 1907 a letter accompanied by a positive report on his reforms. He established in Piazza Armerina a Catholic School named after Prospero Intorcetta. He wrote numerous pastoral letters in which a cross-recurring theme was that of the family and moral education. He also wrote on the theme of psychological intense activity of the conversion and outlined a theology of the laity. For a decade he was also a secretary of the Sicilian Episcopal Conference and spread some collective pastoral letters. In 1937 he addressed at Enna the first Congress of the parish. Activities as a scholar He was interested in philosophical studies, attempting to rinnovate the Scholastic Philosophy with the aim of putting the contemporary culture at the service of God and of the church as an apostolate instrument. From 1915 he collaborated with the neo-scholastic review. And critically confronted with some of the main exponents of the Western Philosophy, including Maurice Blondel, Etienne Gilson and Benedetto Croce, opposed to positivism and idealism. In 1927, after making contacts with scholars of the Catholic Institute in Paris and in Milan, with Fr. Agostino Gemelli, he founded in Piazza armerina a Literary-Philosophical Review (Review of Autoformation), that resumed faithfully in format and in the graphic the review, “Critic of Benedetto Croce”. He himself taught literature and philosophy, publishing notes which later on were collected in volumes. Correspondences in exile and relations with the fascist regime During the exile of his brother Luigi, former secretary of the Italian Popular Party, he exchanged with him many letters in which they discussed philosophy, theology, literature and mysticism. They loved and respected one another, but they criticized each other and at the same time strengthening one another spiritually. From those letters emerges despite the difference of their personality and of their personal histories, their profounding spirituality- the common anxiety of sanctity, the great intellectual approach and pastoral charity which led them to deepen the cultural and social relevance of the faith lived in the internal of the church. The two brothers do not write about politics just as “special surveillants” of the fascist regime. In the central archive of the State there are over a thousand sheets that refer to Sturzo don Luigi, was Felix, anti fascist. For Mario exist about three hundred sheets in the same archive in two funds. Mons. Mario Sturzo had an uncompromising attitude toward the fascist regime attracting ungenerous slanders and veiled persecutions which he endured with firmness and evangelical patience as ensues from the documentation preserved in the central archive of the state. Philosophy and neo-syntheticism The initial aspect from which Sturzo begins his philosophical research is the “thought relation-action. Surely the action will be worthy of admiration only if it will have philosophical foundation and anthropological objective. For Sturzo there will be no true philosophical research if not in the history and at the service of the same, philosophy becomes almost the methodology of history in the sense that it gives method in living and in reading the same. “Sturzo, writes Salvatore Latora in opposition-dialogue with the modern philosophy goes on elaborating its philosophical system- the neo-synthetism, which inspired in a critical manner I. Kant and A. Rosmini , wants to propose a new form of classical realism and christian, supporting the thesis of priority of synthesis on analysis, which has at its centre man” (Latora Salvatore, Sturzo Mario, in Encyclopedic Dictionary of Thinkers and of Theologians of Sicily, 19th and 20th Centuries, vol. VI, Salvatore Sciascia editor, Caltanisetta- Rome, 2010, 3062). The comparison with the epistemological subjectivism and the historicism of the “neo-Italian idealists” led him to grant a privilege to the role of the subject in the known process in a synthesis between immanence and transcendence, between natural and supernatural. Call by the Holy See His life was not of easy paths or foreseen, indeed, his activity of philosophical research, had disapproval of the ecclesiastical hierarchy of the time. In 1931 there was a call of Holy Office of 17 January and came to be published an editorial of Catholic Civilization in which the content and language of Sturzo’s thought were criticized as they seemed to be closer to the neo- idealism of Cross and Gentile which are not to the Scholastic and Thomistic philosophy. They also criticize even his doctrine on knowledge, as also the concepts of philosophy and history. The explicit call of Holy Office put an end to the activity of the “Autoreformation Review” and brought the bishop to the public retraction in cathedral, after the solemn pontifical mass of 8 April 1931. On 19 of the same month the “Osservatore Romano” published the news, leaving his brother Luigi, who was from London in darkness of all stunned. Immediately after this order from the part of the Holy See, Mons. Sturzo suspended the publication of the “Autoreformation Review” because, as he writes to his brother “in it, it is seen not as a service but a struggle”.

The station, established in 1972, is owned by Mike Parchman, through licensee Consolidated Media LLC, with primary studios in Dickson, Tennessee and secondary studios and sales offices in Clarksville, Tennessee. History The station began broadcast operations on September 26, 1972 with 3,000 watts of effective radiated power on a frequency of 104.9 MHz from an antenna in height above average terrain. The station was assigned the call sign \\"WVRY\\" by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The station was built by Humphreys County Broadcasting Company as an FM sister station to WPHC (1060 AM). In March 1984, license holder Robert M. McKay, Jr., (doing business as Humphreys County Broadcasting Company) agreed to sell WVRY and WPHC to Mid- Cummberland Communications, Inc. The FCC approved the joint sale on May 24, 1984, and the deal was completed on July 12, 1984. In May 1988, WVRY management applied to the FCC for permission to change the station's frequency to 105.1 MHz, increase the effective radiated power to 50,000 watts, raise the height above average terrain of the antenna to , and change class to C2. The Commission issued the station a construction permit to make these changes on November 23, 1988, with a scheduled expiration date on May 23, 1990. Construction and testing were completed in June 1989, so a new broadcast license application to cover these changes was submitted. The FCC granted the new license on June 14, 1990. In November 1996, Mid-Cumberland Communications, Inc., reached a deal to sell WVRY and WPHC to Reach Satellite Network, Inc. The FCC approved the combo deal on November 27, 1996, and the sale was completed on December 12, 1997. Within days, the new owners sold AM station WPHC to Canaan Communications, Inc., an area religious broadcaster. In December 1999, the stockholders of Reach Satellite Network agreed to sell the company and its broadcast assets to Salem Communications. At the time of the sale, Reach Satellite Network held the broadcast licenses for WVRY and WBOZ (104.9 FM in Woodbury, Tennessee). The FCC approved the transfer of control on February 15, 2000, and completion of the transaction took place on March 31, 2000. On March 9, 2007, Salem sold WVRY to Grace Broadcasting Services, for a total of $900,000. The deal gained FCC approval on May 23, 2007, and was completed on May 29, 2007. On May 1, 2013, WVRY was sold to JWL Communications for $1 million. In 2016, the station was acquired by MP Media for an undisclosed purchase price. After briefly stunting as Trump 105.1, playing songs vaguely related to Donald Trump, the station flipped to country legends as 105.1 The Wolf.

Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often delusional struggle of the eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and its refusal to psychologize its characters, as well as in its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been read as a precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.; Plot As the novel opens, Wadzek, owner of a factory that produces steam engines, is locked in a struggle with his more powerful rival Rommel, whose much larger company manufactures turbines. He can be seen as representing a new type of entrepreneur, more technologically advanced and less scrupulous than Wadzek. Losing value, the stock of Wadzek's company is being bought up by Rommel; in desperation, Wadzek teams up with Schneemann, an engineer working at one of Rommel's factories, to thwart his company's takeover by Rommel. This effort includes the misguided theft of some of Rommel's business correspondence. Fearing legal retribution for this theft, Wadzek, accompanied by Schneemann, flees with his wife Pauline and daughter Herta to his house in Reinickendorf, where the two men fortify the house in delusional preparation for a siege that never comes. Financially and spiritually broken, Wadzek returns to Berlin and with Schneemann attempts to turn himself in at a police station, where they learn that no warrant has even been issued for their arrest. There follows a temporary reconciliation with his estranged family and the first attempts to begin a new career in education—Wadzek would instruct his students in a new, moralistic and humane approach to technology. However, after walking in on an erotically and exotically charged debauch held in his own parlor (the aftermath of an African-themed birthday party Pauline held with her two new friends from Reinickendorf), Wadzek suffers a further breakdown. The novel ends aboard a ship bound for America, Wadzek eloping with Gaby, an old acquaintance and erstwhile lover of Rommel's, to begin a new life. Stylistic and thematic aspects The novel, originally conceived by Döblin as a novel in \\"Kino-Stil\\" (\\"cinematic style\\"), is characterized by rapid shifts of perspective and the increasingly sophisticated use of montage. Döblin, having emphatically rejected the psychological novel in his 1913 essay \\"To novel writers and their critics,\\" presents the reader of Wadzek with a depiction of characters from a perspective that, rather than offering psychological motivations for their actions, opts for a \\"psychiatric method\\" that records events and processes without commenting on them or attempting to explain them. Condemned by contemporary critics for its overly-detailed and grotesque descriptive language, the novel's style has since received acknowledgment for its \\"radical naturalism\\".; Describing the narrative technique used in Wadzek, the critic Judith Ryan has written, Döblin's refusal to make Wadzek a tragic figure, as well as the novel's thematization and satire of tragedy, earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht, who declared, \\"Ich liebe das Buch.\\" Other themes of the novel include monopoly capitalism, modern technology, the bourgeois family, and the modern metropolis. Certain aspects of the plot, such as Schneemann's dislike of Stettin (Szczecin) and Wadzek's elopement for America, recapitulate elements of Döblin's own biography. Genesis and publication By his own account, Döblin wrote Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine \\"in one go\\" from August to December 1914, at which time he had to begin work as a military doctor near the western front in Sarreguemines.; While he had originally conceived of the work as a three-stage narrative about the progress of modern technology (represented by the steam engine, the steam turbine, and the oil motor), his planned sequel, Der Ölmotor (The Oil Motor), never came to fruition. He conducted extensive research for the novel, spending time in the facilities of AEG and learning about the construction of machines, turbines, and motors. Döblin submitted the draft to rigorous stylistic overhaul during the war years, shortening the novel considerably and radicalizing the syntax.

The episode was co-written by series creators Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis, while being directed by David M. Barrett. Horowitz and Kitsis had intended to kill off Graham since the pilot episode was picked up, believing that it would add \\"stakes\\" to the series and show viewers that the story is \\"not in Henry's head.\\" The episode is considered significant, as Graham's death reveals that Regina is aware of her fairytale past. The series takes place in the fictional seaside town of Storybrooke, Maine, in which the residents are actually characters from various fairy tales that were transported to the \\"real world\\" town by a powerful curse. This episode's story follows Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) as he remembers his fairytale counterpart, leading to significant consequences that parallel his previous life as the Huntsman. It first aired in the United States on ABC on December 11, 2011. An estimated 8.91 million viewers watched the episode, placing third in its timeslot behind NBC and CBS. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics, as some praised Dornan's character but were divided on the ending sequence. It was the series' mid-season finale. Plot Opening sequence A wolf is shown in the forest. In Storybrooke In Granny's Cafe, Sheriff Graham (Jamie Dornan) throws darts at a picture of a deer very accurately. Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrives but leaves immediately because she has not forgiven him for hiding his relationship with Regina (Lana Parrilla). Emma attempts to avoid conversation, but Graham is insistent on explaining to her he feels nothing for Regina. He kisses Emma and suddenly sees a vision of a wolf, only to have Emma push him away. Frustrated by Emma's lack of understanding, Graham, drunk, later has sex with Regina. In the middle of the night, he awakens abruptly from a dream of a deer and a wolf. When Graham tells Regina that the dream felt like a memory, Regina tries to convince him to stay, telling him that he's still drunk, but Graham leaves. As Graham attempts to get to his car, the wolf from his visions appears next to him, startling him before it leaves. As he tries to find the wolf in the woods, he runs into Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle). Graham tells him about the wolf, and Mr. Gold suggests to him that dreams are memories from another life. The following morning, Emma discovers flowers on the table and throws them out, assuming they are from Graham, but Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) says that they were hers from Dr. Whale (David Anders), with whom she had a one- night stand. Emma is glad to hear that Mary Margaret appears to be getting over David (Josh Dallas). Mary Margaret tells Emma that it is obvious that she has feelings for Graham, but does not acknowledge them because she is putting up a \\"wall\\" to keep herself from getting hurt. The sheriff finds the wolf in the woods, and when he whistles, the wolf goes to him. As he pets the wolf's head, he sees himself holding a knife, about to hurt the woman he only knows as Mary Margaret. Graham pays a visit to her classroom, telling her that he believes they know each other from another life, before Storybrooke. Mary Margaret assumes that the sheriff has been talking to Henry, and while this is not the case, this gives Graham the idea to consult Henry about his book. Meanwhile, at the sheriff's office, Regina shows up and warns Emma to stay away from Graham, apparently jealous of his connection with Emma. Graham visits Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) and describes his visions, to which Henry replies that he must be the queen's Huntsman. The Huntsman was hired by the Evil Queen to remove Snow White's heart and bring it back to her, but when he does not do so, she removes his heart. Graham later attempts to explain to Emma that he could not feel anything with Regina because he does not have a heart. Graham and Emma then encounter the wolf from Graham's visions, and follow it to a graveyard and vault marked with a symbol Graham saw in his visions and in Henry's book. Looking for his heart, Graham fervently searches the vault, which turns out to be the tomb of Henry Mills. Regina arrives to place flowers on her father's grave and is furious to find them there. Regina accuses Emma of stealing the sheriff from her, and Emma responds that Regina has chased everyone away. Graham defends Emma, and the women exchange blows. Later, while Graham cleans Emma's wounds, Regina pushes aside the stone inside the vault, which turns out not to be a tomb after all; the stone reveals a staircase. Emma realizes her feelings for Graham and the two kiss just as Regina opens a storage box in the hidden room and clutches Graham's heart, crushing it to dust, showing that she remembers being the Evil Queen. Before he collapses and dies, Graham's last words to Emma are \\"I remember! Thank you.\\" In the characters' past In the Enchanted Forest, the Evil Queen mourns the death of her husband, Snow White's father, although she herself is responsible for his death. Snow (Goodwin) and the Queen seemingly comfort each other over the loss. The Queen consults her magic mirror (Esposito) to ask how she can kill Snow, who is beloved by the people but a threat to her bid for the throne. She says that the king's knights will not kill his daughter, and the mirror tells her that she needs a huntsman. As Graham saw in his flashbacks, the Huntsman (Dornan) and his brother wolf seem to enjoy living a peaceful life in the woods. The Huntsman kills only for himself to live, and has no compassion for humans, who do not understand the wild. As the Huntsman and his wolf enter a tavern, the other patrons begin harassing him, prompting him to successfully defend himself. His performance is viewed in the magic mirror by the Queen, who is greatly impressed. She summons the Huntsman to offer him anything he wants on the condition that he brings her Snow's heart. He agrees to this deal, in return asking for the protection of all the wolves in the Enchanted Forest. Snow and the Huntsman walk together in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs as well as a request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him to her chamber and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet (sexually as well as otherwise) and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze (which she does in Storybrooke to kill him). Production Jamie Dornan commented of his character's exit, \\"It's pretty gruesome, but you know, it's a little bit cool. Not many people get to die like that... As TV deaths go, I was pretty happy.\\" The episode was co-written by co-creators Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz, and was directed by The Mentalist veteran David M. Barrett. Guest actor Giancarlo Esposito made his second appearance in the series as Magic Mirror/Sidney Glass. Meghan Ory returned as Ruby/Red Riding Hood, while Scott Heindl made his only appearance for the series as Bartholomew. Leading up to the episode broadcast, Kitsis and Horowitz noted that \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" would feature consequences of events that occurred in the previous episode. Horowitz explained, \\"Emma is in a raw emotional place, trying to come to terms with her feelings about what she discovered about Graham. Graham is also in a very raw emotional place because he's clearly conflicted and it's this cauldron of emotions that leads to the kiss.\\" Kitsis added that, \\"We're really excited that the kiss that you've seen is really just the jumping off point of the story we're telling. It's not like it ends with the kiss, it starts with that and it takes us somewhere that we're excited to show you.\\" In the episode, the character of Sheriff Graham was killed off, something that actor Jamie Dornan had known would happen since ABC picked up the pilot. It was the first major death of the series. In an interview with E! reporter Kristin Dos Santos, Dornan hinted that while his counterpart in Storybrooke has died, the huntsman could return at some point, as Dornan is still a regular on the series. As much of the episode involves Graham discovering his fairytale past, the writers designed the episode to mislead viewers by having them invest in the character. Kitsis and Horowitz commented that while the death made them \\"sad,\\" the battle between Emma and Regina requires \\"stakes and unfortunately, sometimes stakes are people's lives.\\" They also decided to kill the character relatively early in the series in order to show viewers that \\"it's real. It's not in Henry's head.\\" Kitsis continued, \\"It’s interesting, but part of the intent was to make you love him and we loved him very much. And the fact that the audience seems to have loved him means a lot to us, in that we feel like we succeeded on that front. If you don’t feel sad, then it was a failure of the execution of the story.\\" Actress Lana Parrilla believed that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss \\"was not easy for [Regina]. That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear coming out of her eye. She didn’t want to do it, but she had no choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m not saying I agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do.\\" Parrilla also cited \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" as the first episode where viewers see \\"how the two worlds collided,\\" a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, \\"is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke.\\" The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013. Reception Ratings For the third week in a row, the ratings once again slipped, as it placed 2.9/7 among adults aged 18–49 and a 5.2/8 overall, with only 8.91 million viewers tuning in. It ranked third in its timeslot, being beaten by Football Night In America on NBC and 60 Minutes on CBS but ahead of The Simpsons on the Fox network. \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" served as the series' mid-season finale, as the next episode aired on January 8, 2012. In Canada, the episode finished in twelfth place for the week with an estimated 1.6 million viewers, a slight increase from the 1.55 million of the previous episode. Reviews \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" received mixed reviews from television critics. TV Fanatic writer C. Orlando enjoyed the episode, remarking \\"I love Once Upon a Time because it's like a mini-movie every week and I'm completely enthralled by this intriguing other world filled with characters that feel familiar yet completely new.\\" He called the ending scene \\"heartbreaking.\\" IGN writer Amy Ratcliffe rated the episode 9/10, giving particular praise to Jamie Dornan's ability to be \\"magnetic in every scene.\\" Ratcliffe called his backstory her favorite fairytale of the series up to that point. Television Without Pity's Cindy McLennan wished they had not killed Graham, but gave credit to the writers for making her care about him. She concluded, \\"Episodes like this give me strong hope for the second part of this season, one-nighters and all. Bring on the pain, boys.\\" She graded the episode with an A. Blast Magazine columnist Christopher Peck was disappointed that the writers had not yet revealed the reason for the Evil Queen's grudge, commenting, \\"If the thing that sticks out most about an episode of television is what I didn’t get out, that’s an ominous sign: a foreshadowing that the show has no goddamn clue where it’s headed.\\" He did however enjoy seeing Graham's memories, calling them and the other series flashbacks \\"the freshest and most thrilling part of the show.\\" While describing Graham's death as \\"heartbreaking,\\" Peck felt that it \\"completely nullifies any advancement the episode made.\\" He graded the episode with a C+. Entertainment Weeklys Shaunna Murphy was a little more critical of the episode, though she did call it \\"game-changing.\\" Noting that it \\"felt rushed,\\" she \\"would have preferred a slow-burning mystery spread out over several episodes over this dramatic, Nikki and Paulo-style stand-alone sendoff.\\" Murphy however concluded that Graham's death was \\"one of the coolest sequences we've seen so far on this show.\\" The A.V. Club columnist Oliver Sava graded \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" with a C. He also noted negative similarities to the television series Lost, explaining, \\"Remember when Jack, Sawyer, and Kate were stuck in the polar-bear cages, and the plot just wandered in an aimless haze? The time when a bunch of viewers started jumping off because the writers kept adding questions without ever giving answers? What took Lost 44 episodes, OUAT has done in seven.\\" Unlike other reviewers, Sava called the ending a \\"frustrating conclusion,\\" and believed that \\"Horowitz and Kitsis [took] one step forward and two steps back with this development.\\" References External links * * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 1) episodes ","title":"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Once Upon a Time)"},{"id":"34033932","text":"Homoranthus papillatus, commonly known as mouse bush, is a plant in the myrtle family Myrtaceae and is endemic to a small area in southern Queensland.

Talamoni also held civic office for a brief period though later resigned due to the rise of Fascism in the area and dedicated his career to proper care for the poor and to the maintenance of civic infrastructure. His beatification was celebrated in 2004. Life Luigi Talamoni was born in Monza on 3 October 1848 as the second of six children to Giuseppe Talamoni and Maria Angelica Sala; he was baptized mere hours after his birth. His father worked as a hatmaker. Talamoni attended frequent Mass with his father and served at the altar which prompted him to dream of becoming a priest. He completed his initial education in the \\"Oratorio di Barnabita Carrobiolo\\" in Monza that welcomed him later in the \\"seminar of the poor\\" due to his modest economic condition; the Barnabite priest Luigi Villoresi encouraged and supported him. In 1865 he graduated and commenced his studies for the priesthood in Milan where he underwent theological and philosophical studies in addition to literature – the latter two he took up after completing the former. Talamoni received his ordination as a priest on 4 March 1871 from Archbishop Luigi Nazari di Calabiana (he celebrated his first Mass at Monza) and was soon sent to teach at the \\"Collegio San Carlo\\" in Milan where he had as a student (1874–75) Achille Ratti – the future Pope Pius XI. In 1875, he was called to Monza as a teacher of the high school there and also worked in pastoral care with a particular emphasis on preaching and working in the confessional. The growing success of socialism led him to the political field: he agreed to be included in the civil lists of the \\"Catholic Committee of Monza\\" and in 1893 was elected to the Monza council. His political commitment was directed to the needs of schools and kindergartens as well as to improve the status of public roads and lighting and to the defense of moral values. Talamoni also remained committed to the establishment of houses for the poor and the protection of small businesses as well as the distribution of medicines for the poor and the improvement of the prison environment. The social work efforts also earned him the esteem of his political opponents. Despite his re-election in 1923 the climate of violence that the wave of Fascism initiated forced his resignation from the council. His first term in office was from 1896 until 1916 and then ran again from 1923 until his resignation in 1926. Talamoni was encouraged with and helped to direct the relief organization that Maria Biffi Levati (1835–1905) started and with her assistance founded the Merciful Sisters of Saint Gerard on 25 March 1891. His order received diocesan approval from Cardinal Andrea Carlo Ferrari on 18 March 1902. Father Talamoni died in Milan – in the clinic of the Sisters of Maria Bambina – in 1926. His remains were exhumed on 20 May 1966 and relocated to the motherhouse of the order while his order later received the papal decree of praise from Pope Pius XII on 15 February 1942 and later his full papal approval on 10 May 1948. As of 2005 there were 90 religious in 15 houses in various Italian cities and has been active in Switzerland and in Togo since 2008. Beatification The fame for his personal holiness reached far and wide across both Milan and Monza which prompted the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster to commence the investigations for potential canonization. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini – the future Pope Paul VI – inaugurated the informative process in June 1957 and later closed it in December 1958. His spiritual writings received the approval of the theologians called in to assess them on two occasions on 29 March 1963 and again on 9 October 1971. The informative process received the validation of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints on 13 January 1989 so that the cause could proceed; the postulation submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. in 1989. Theologians assented to the cause's continuation on 14 January 1992 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. on 2 June 1992. On 11 July 1992 he was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope John Paul II confirmed that Talamoni led a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle needed for beatification was investigated in the place it originated in and was later validated on 15 June 2001 before a medical board approved it on 21 November 2002. Theologians also issued their assent on 28 February 2003 as did the C.C.S. on 1 April 2003 before John Paul II granted final approval to it on 12 April 2003 and thus confirmed Talamoni would be beatified. On 21 March 2004 – in Saint Peter's Square – John Paul II beatified him. His remains were moved on this occasion from the church his remains were housed in to a new location. On 3 October 2009 a solemn celebration in the Duomo of Monza that Cardinal Dionigi Tettamanzi presided over with the archpriest Silvano Provasi saw the announcement of the positive pronouncement of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments on Talamoni being made the patron of the Province of Monza and Brianza. The second miracle – and the one required for sanctification – was investigated in the location that it originated in and received validation from the C.C.S. on 30 October 2009.

Background  Lanthionine ketimine was recognized as a natural metabolite as early as 1983 by Dorianno Cavallini, who published regarding its synthesis and chemical properties.Cavallini, D.; Ricci, G.; Federri, G. (1983) The ketimine derivatives of thialysine, lanthionine, cystathionine, cysteine: Preparation and properties. In Sulfur Amino Acids: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects, Alan R. Liss Inc., pp. 355–364 Cavallini and others showed that lanthionine ketimine forms from alternative reactions of the transsulfuration pathway enzyme cystathionine-β-synthase, which normally condenses the amino acids homocysteine and serine to form cystathionine. In an alternate pathway, cysteine and serine (or two equivalents of cysteine) condense to form lanthionine. The product of these transformations is lanthionine or cystathionine ketimine, respectively. Additional sources of lanthionine ketimine have been proposed. Lanthionine ketimine also binds the brain protein lanthionine synthase-like protein-1 (LANCL1), a glutathione-binding protein of uncertain function. It has been hypothesized, but not proved, that LANCL1 might catalyze formation of glutathione-lanthionine conjugates in a pathway leading to lanthionine ketimine. Lanthionine ketimine and a synthetic, cell-penetrating ester derivative called lanthionine ketimine-5-ethyl ester (LKE) potentiate growth factor-dependent extension of neuron processes (neurites) in cell culture. This neurotrophic activity may occur through interaction of lanthionine ketimine with a protein called collapsin response protein-2 (CRMP2, also known as dihydropyrimidinase-like protein-2 or DPYSL2). Normally CRMP2 functions to promote or inhibit neurite growth. Lanthionine ketimine interacts with CRMP2 in affinity proteomics experiments and alters CRMP2 binding to other proteins in brain lysate preparations. Beside its neurotrophic effects, lanthionine ketimine and its ester LKE protect neurons against oxidative stress and inhibit the activation of microglia (brain macrophages) triggered by exposure to inflammatory cytokines. Administration of LKE to the SOD1G93A mouse model of the motor neuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), slows progression of paralytic disease in this mouse.  Preparation  Lanthionine ketimine or its ethyl esters can be synthesized by condensation of cysteine derivatives (e.g. L-cysteine-ethyl ester hydrochloride) with 3-bromopyruvic acid or derivatives in water, followed by filtration and thorough aqueous washing of the precipitate. When dried, the precipitate can be resolubilized in aqueous medium by slow titration with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or other base.

The site at Baking Pot is unique in that it had a large population during the Terminal Classic while other sites in the Belize River Valley were declining, and occupation continued into the Postclassic whereas major Classic Period sites in the southern lowlands were by then abandoned.Aimers, James J. (2003). Abandonment and Nonabandonment at Baking Pot, Belize. In Takeshi Inomata and Ronald W. Wedd, Eds., The Archaeology of Settlement Abandonment in Middle America. Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press. After the Classic period site cores in much of the Belize Valley were abandoned, but at Baking Pot “survey and excavation of house mounds and plazuela groups immediately outside the site core suggested that Postclassic occupation there is more substantial and prolonged than in the site core”. The abundance of Tayasal-associated Augustine Red ceramics at Baking Pot, along with the association of these ceramics with a different organizational and settlement pattern suggest that there was an intrusion of people from central Petén during this time.Chase, Arlen F. (1986). Time Depth or Vacuum: The 11.3.0.0.0 Correlation and the Lowland Maya Postclassic, in J.A. Sabloff and E.W. Andrews V, Eds., Late Lowland Maya Civilization: Classic to Postclassic, pp. 99-140, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque. Researchers like Aimers favor a gradual abandonment of the site at a much later time period than other sites in the region.  History  In the late Preclassic, Baking Pot had a small population with little public architecture. In the Early Classic, the site experienced a construction boom. Two architectural groups were built, with Group A to the north and Group B (containing the largest structure at Baking Pot) to the south. This north-south orientation is similar to nearby Xunantunich.Awe, Jaime J.

Institute of Archaeology, National Institute of Culture and History, Belmopan, Belize. Earlier excavators like Ricketson, Gordon Willey, and Bullard and Bullard describe these groups as Group 1 and Group 2. These major complexes make up the center of Baking Pot and are connected by a causeway (or sacbe). In the Late Classic, the population increased to approximately 3000 people. Toward the end of the Classic period the local elite left and the palace complexes in the city center were abandoned. In the early Postclassic, people were still living on a portion of the site but rarely used the ceremonial center and there was very little new construction. Much of the people living at Baking Pot were farmers; being close to the Belize River the site has fertile soil in an alluvial valley and is primarily associated with agricultural production.  Excavations  In the 1920s, A.H. Anderson first conducted archaeological research at Baking Pot after some materials from the site were used in the construction of the western highway.

A complex water management system exists at the site, including a series of aguadas and seasonal streams, along with the presence of drains in the palace complex, work to feed water from the foothills to the south down through the site and into the aduadas before dumping into the Belize River. Baking Pot is named after large pots were found by archaeologists that were once used to boil chicle. At the Bedran group nearby, a house group that was excavated, burial grave goods were found including painted ceramic vessels with a primary standard sequence around the top dated to the Early Classic.Awe, Jaime J. and Christophe G.B.

These vessels were cacao drinking vessels and were thought to contain a placename: Four Water Place, although this is now reinterpreted as a royal title. There are no carved monuments at Baking Pot, although several uncarved stelae and uncarved altars have been found. A causeway extends south and to the west of Group B and ends at a causeway terminus structure (Mound 190). Here hundreds of broken vessels were found in front of the stairway, possibly from a termination ritual. Mound 190 had deposits with finger bones, an altar, and intact mini ceramic vessels below it with tiny specks of jade. This mound also contains evidence of ritual activity and is believed to be used for ritual/ceremonial purposes. The discovery of finger bones is similar to the finger bowl caches associated with Caracol (and also found at Cahal Pech) and may provide evidence of Caracol control or influence at Baking Pot at the time.Helmke, Christophe and Jaime J.

As suggested by its name, it has tiny leaves but it also produces creamy white to white flowers throughout the year in its native range.  Description  Melaleuca minutifolia is a shrub or small tree growing to about high with white papery bark and glabrous branches. The leaves are arranged in alternate pairs (decussate), making four rows of leaves along the stems. They are rhombic in shape, long, wide with their upper surface pressed against the stem revealing raised oil glands on their lower (outer) surface. The flowers are white to creamy white and are arranged in short spikes on the ends of the branches which continue to grow after flowering or on their sides. The spikes are up to in diameter and contain up to 10 pairs of flowers. The petals are long and fall off as the flower matures. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers with 8 to 16 stamens in each bundle. Flowering occurs throughout the year, although mainly in autumn and spring and is followed by fruit which are woody, cylindrical capsules, long and in diameter, arranged in small, loose clusters along the stem. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Victorian Government Botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1859 from \\"barren localities in North Western Australia\\". The specific epithet (minutifolia) is from the Latin words minutus meaning \\"little\\" or “small” and folia meaning \\"leaves\\" referring to the tiny leaves of this species. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca minutifolia occurs in sandy or rocky soils in and between the Drysdale River National Park in northern Western Australia and the south west part of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory Conservation Melaleuca minutifolia is listed as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses Horticulture This species has an informal, attractive shape and a useful screening plant for tropical climates. Essential oils The oil from the leaves of this species consists mainly of sesquiterpenes and monoterpenes.

By default, it just needs the class to have defined default no-args constructor (which can be worked around, see Features). The following example demonstrates the most basic usage of Gson when serializing a sample object: module GsonExample { requires gson; requires java.sql; // Required by gson exports Person; exports Car; } package Car; public class Car { public String manufacturer; public String model; public double capacity; public boolean accident; public Car() public Car(String manufacturer, String model, double capacity, boolean accident) { this.manufacturer = manufacturer; this.model = model; this.capacity = capacity; this.accident = accident; } @Override public String toString() { return (\\"Manufacturer: \\" + manufacturer + \\", \\" + \\"Model: \\" + model + \\", \\" + \\"Capacity: \\" + capacity + \\", \\" + \\"Accident: \\" + accident); } } package Person; import Car.Car; public class Person { public String name; public String surname; public Car[] cars; public int phone; public transient int age; public Person() public Person(String name, String surname, int phone, int age, Car[] cars) { this.name = name; this.surname = surname; this.cars = cars; this.phone = phone; this.age = age; } @Override public String toString() { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.append(\\"Name: \\").append(name).append(\\" \\").append(surname).append(\\" \\"); sb.append(\\"Phone: \\").append(phone).append(\\" \\"); sb.append(\\"Age: \\").append(age).append(\\" \\"); int i = 0; for (Car item : cars) { i++; sb.append(\\"Car \\").append(i).append(\\": \\").append(item).append(\\" \\"); } return sb.toString(); } } After calling package Main; import Car.Car; import Person.Person; import com.google.gson.Gson; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Gson gson = new Gson(); Car audi = new Car(\\"Audi\\", \\"A4\\", 1.8, false); Car skoda = new Car(\\"Škoda\\", \\"Octavia\\", 2.0, true); Car[] cars = {audi, skoda}; Person johnDoe = new Person(\\"John\\", \\"Doe\\", 2025550191, 35, cars); System.out.println(gson.toJson(johnDoe)); } } you will get this output: { \\"name\\":\\"John\\", \\"surname\\":\\"Doe\\", \\"cars\\":[ { \\"manufacturer\\":\\"Audi\\", \\"model\\":\\"A4\\", \\"capacity\\":1.8, \\"accident\\":false }, { \\"manufacturer\\":\\"Škoda\\", \\"model\\":\\"Octavia\\", \\"capacity\\":2.0, \\"accident\\":true } ], \\"phone\\":2025550191 } Since the Person's field \\"age\\" is marked as transient, it is not included in the output. To deserialize output produced by last example, you can execute the following code: package Main; import Person.Person; import com.google.gson.Gson; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Gson gson = new Gson(); String json = \\"{\\\\\\"name\\\\\\":\\\\\\"John\\\\\\",\\\\\\"surname\\\\\\":\\\\\\"Doe\\\\\\",\\\\\\"cars\\\\\\":[{\\\\\\"manufacturer\\\\\\":\\\\\\"Audi\\\\\\",\\\\\\"model\\\\\\":\\\\\\"A4\\\\\\",\\" + \\"\\\\\\"capacity\\\\\\":1.8,\\\\\\"accident\\\\\\":false},{\\\\\\"manufacturer\\\\\\":\\\\\\"Škoda\\\\\\",\\\\\\"model\\\\\\":\\\\\\"Octavia\\\\\\",\\\\\\"capacity\\\\\\"\\" + \\":2.0,\\\\\\"accident\\\\\\":true}],\\\\\\"phone\\\\\\":2025550191}\\"; Person johnDoe = gson.fromJson(json, Person.class); System.out.println(johnDoe.toString()); } } And the following output will be generated: Name: John Doe Phone: 2025550191 Age: 0 Car 1: Manufacturer: Audi, Model: A4, Capacity: 1.8, Accident: false Car 2: Manufacturer: Škoda, Model: Octavia, Capacity: 2.0, Accident: true The following example demonstrates how to pretty print a Json using Gson library. import com.google.gson.Gson; import com.google.gson.GsonBuilder; import java.nio.file.Files; import java.nio.file.Paths; import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.List; import lombok.SneakyThrows; public class PrettyPrintExample { //SneakyThrows annotation will internally declare all checked exceptions. @SneakyThrows public static void main(String[] args) { List cars= Arrays.asList(\\"Fiat\\",\\"BMW\\",\\"Lamborghini\\"); //Create new GSON object Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create(); String prettyJson=gson.toJson(cars); System.out.println(\\"pretty \\"+prettyJson); } } And the following output will be generated: pretty [ \\"Fiat\\", \\"BMW\\", \\"Lamborghini\\" ] Features * Gson can handle collections, generic types and nested classes (including inner classes, this can not be done by default though) * When deserializing, Gson navigates the type tree of the object being deserialized. This results in ignoring extra fields present in the JSON input. * User can write a custom serializer and/or deserializer so that they can control the whole process and even (de)serialize instances of classes for which the source code is not accessible. * User can write an InstanceCreator which allows them to deserialize instances of classes without a defined no- args constructor. * Gson is highly customizable, you can specify: :* Compact/pretty printing (whether you want compact or readable output) :* How to handle null object fields - by default they are not present in the output :* Rules of what fields are intended to be excluded from (de)serialization :* How to convert Java field names External links * Gson on GitHub * Gson tutorial with examples Category:Java (programming language) libraries Category:JSON Category:Google software Category:Computer-related introductions in 2008 ","title":"Gson"},{"id":"34034097","text":"Jusélius Mausoleum () is one of the most famous sights in Pori, Finland, located at the 1884 opened Käppärä Cemetery.

It is part of the Northumberland Church of England Trust occupying the Josephine Butler Campus of its predecessor The Northumberland Church of England Academy which was an all-through school spread out across six campuses in southeastern Northumberland. History The school was founded in September 2009, replacing Hirst High School and nine primary school sites in the Ashington, Newbiggin-by-the-Sea and Lynemouth area of Northumberland. The new Josephine Butler Campus was handed over to the academy by Kier Construction and Northumberland County Council on 2 March 2012, moving secondary, primary and special needs students into one building with the exception of the Thomas Bewick, William Leech, Grace Darling and James Knott campuses, which will stay at their current location. The Centre [Special Educational Needs unit] includes the SEN pupils from Abbeyfields First School in Morpeth which is also located in the Josephine Butler Campus. £48 million was spent on the new academy. Of the sum, £2 million has come from the county council with the DfE and other grants funding the remainder. Funding was also provided by the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle and the Duke of Northumberland (represented by Northumberland Estates). In 2013 the Northumberland Church of England Academy was an all through academy of 2,700 students based on six campuses in Ashington, Newbiggin and Lynemouth. It comprises five primary school campuses for learners aged 3 to 11, a secondary campus, the Josephine Butler Campus for learners aged 11 to 19 and a 100-place centre for students with profound and/or multiple learning difficulties or with severe learning difficulties. 10% of students were of White British origin. The number eligible for pupil premium funding was well above average. and the proportion with a statement of special educational need much higher than the national average. 30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. © Crown copyright Ofsted Ofsted assessed the school in 2013 and declared it \\"requires improvement\\". It found that though parents and students were supportive and primary aged children were getting a better deal, there were weaknesses elsewhere. They judged that the governors were ineffective, and leadership was inconsistent. The said that planning at all levels of leadership was not focused sharply enough on the need to raise achievement in English and mathematics. They also criticised variable quality teaching and the behavior of some pupils. Since then the school has been monitored in 2014 , and inspected in 2015 and 2017 and in all cases the school was found to be requiring improvements. Following the 2017 inspection, the controlling trust separated out the various units, to become stand alone schools. The special needs unit became Castle School, and the secondary section, based at the Josephine Butler Campus became the NCEA Duke's Secondary School. This became an 11–19 mixed ability, secondary school with sixth form – it has separate governance and structures. Academics In the first three years, (Key Stage 3). The trust balances the need to fulfill the National Curriculum with the principles of the Church of England. Some pupils enter the academy with low literacy and numeracy skill. The curriculum complies with the statutory obligations to provide courses in National Curriculum subjects: English, Mathematics, Science, History, World Studies (Geography) French, Healthy Living (DT), ICT, Art, Music, Drama and P.E., together with Religious Education. The government promotes EBacc subjects as a way to create an academic core curriculum in Key Stage 4. The Duke's Secondary School provides a broad and balanced curriculum to meet the needs and aspirations of all pupils. It is built round a core of academic subjects, and option blocks enable a wider personalised curriculum of academic, creative and vocational subjects to be created. Core is Maths, English Language, English Literature and Science. There are a number of elements of the Key Stage 4 curriculum that are core provision, but do not lead to external accreditation. However, the full programme of study that pupils follow is valuable for their future, and includes Religious Studies (RS); Personal, Social, Health and Careers Education (PSHCE); ICT; and Physical Education (PE). Students select 3 options from a selection of GCSE and BTEC level 1 courses. The sixth form is known as JBVI. Students are guided into Level 3 and Level 2 pathways largely on their Attainment 8 score. They have four option columns; vocational studies feature strongly: These courses are offered: ; Level 3 academic (A levels): Art and Design ,Biology, Core Maths, ASDAN EPQ, Psychology, Sociology ; Level 3 Vocational:Creative Media (single), Health & Social Care (double), ICT (double), Science (single), Sport (double)) ; Level 2 Courses: Business Enterprise, Childcare, Hospitality & Catering, ICT, Personal Development, PHSE There is a fifth option column where a range of AS levels and lower level vocational topics can be attempted by the student.

Theories Éric Pichet has developed theories in different areas. Corporate governance theories =Enlightened shareholder theory= Enlightened Shareholder Theory \\"Enlightened Shareholder Theory: Whose Interests Should Be Served by the Supporters of Corporate Governance?\\", papers.ssrn.com, 05/09/08 is an advanced and essentially shareholder-oriented corporate governance theory. The rest of Pichet's body of work in this area, including his 2006 PhD thesis on the “Convergence between corporate governance practices in large publicly listed companies with diffuse shareholdings”, allows him to define three main categories of governance principles that can be applied in large publicly listed companies. These principles : * Ensure the transparency of corporate information * Ensure shareholder control of the company, specifically via balanced boards (mixing independent directors with different competencies) and optimised board procedures. * Enable the whole of the board to participate in corporate strategising, not just the CEO. =Financial Institution governance theories= After analysing the role that failed governance mechanisms played in the Kerviel affair, \\"What Governance Lessons Should be Learnt from the Société Générale's Kerviel Affair?\\", papers.ssrn.com, 14/10/10 Pichet detects a need for major improvements in the governance of large financial institutions, based on: * Large banks’ internal control systems reporting to the board instead of to the executive * Boards being able to hire financial market specialists to develop greater authority in this area * A systematic development of specialist board committees, notably for strategy and risk control purposes More generally, having analysed financial institutions that made huge losses in 2007–2010, he identifies 6 symptoms What Kind of Financial Regulation for the 21st Century?\\", http://papers.ssrn.com, 19/03/2012 that are always present under these conditions, which create an explosive cocktail when combined. The symptoms include: # Having a power-hungry and authoritarian leader (Richard Fuld at Lehman, Sean FitzPatrick at Anglo Irish Bank) driven by an insatiable need for social recognition and obsessed by the desire to unseat the current leader (Goldman Sachs, in this instance). # Failed internal governance systems, always involving the board of directors, who on each occasion turned out to be incompetent in terms of managing their strategic control function, and/or too subservient to the executive. # An almost unlimited ability to access cheap short-term funding. # Massive investment of short-term borrowings in high yield assets with over-estimated safety and liquidity. Between 2002 and 2006 this was best exemplified by direct or indirect investments in property; mortgage loans backed by property assets (i.e. Northern Rock); or lastly, investments in other assets index-linked to property or property loans, such as CDOs, subprimes, etc. # Excessive gearing, frequently 20 or 30 times the equity investment on these operations. # Failed external regulation mechanisms, due either to excessive complicity between regulators, governments and large financial institutions (Iceland, Ireland); incompetent regulators (Iceland); or insufficient monitoring (the Bank of England's “light touch” regulation). Note other dysfunctions, such as the fact that the Fed never tries to burst asset bubbles; a poor distribution of tasks among different regulatory bodies (in the UK, between the FSA, Bank of England and HM Treasury; in the US, the Fed's failure to monitor investment banks); or outright complicity with the institutions that the regulators were supposed to control (as in Ireland). When all six conditions are met, financial institutions can experience major losses causing them to collapse (Lehman Brothers). Fundamentally, this is an example of systemic risk. As Pichet teaches students, “The needle that pops the balloon (i.e. subprime loans) is just the trigger for the crisis, not the root cause”. The best way of avoiding future financial failures is to: * Ensure that large banks provide transparent information * Reinforce boards’ authority and ability to control corporate strategy * Enhance regulatory quality He also criticises three legislative trends that began after the crisis: * Too many purely formal regulations (like Dodd Frank), * The illusion that splitting commercial and investment banking offers a viable solution * Banning short sales, which has no impact on price changes Tax theory =Wealth tax Theory and political consequences= Although Pichet does not contest the theoretical utility of wealth taxes in modern fiscal systems, his analysis of the economic consequences of the ISF \\"The Economic Consequences of the French Wealth Tax\\", papers.ssrn.com, 05/04/07 French Wealth Tax led him to the conclusion that this particular levy yields half as much as it costs in lost revenue \\"Here's how a revamped wealth tax could fuel the COVID recovery\\",weforum.org,03/08/20. He took clearly position against the \\"French utopia\\" of a Global tax on the Superrich. \\"An Immodest Proposal: A Global Tax on the Superrich\\",businessweek.com,04/10/14 His research \\"Democrats Love a Wealth Tax, But Europeans Are Ditching the Idea\\",bloomberg.com,03/28/19 fuels the debate set up in the US \\"Where Wealth Taxes Failed\\",wsj.com,11/04/19 by Senator Elizabeth Warren \\"Why Europe Axed Its Wealth Taxes\\",nationalreview.com,03/27/19 about the possibility of an annual tax on household wealth of 2 percent on net wealth above $50 million and 3 percent on net wealth above $1 billion. =Optimal taxation theory= Having authored two biographies about Adam Smith, a strong influence in his writings, Pichet's idea is that taxation must be based on four principles formulated by Smith in “An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations“, albeit only after adapting them to the 21st century: * Fairness: taxes must be paid according to each person's resources and must integrate the Polluter Pays Principle, * Judicial Security: prohibition not only of all forms of arbitrariness but also all forms of insecurity for however long the taxpayer needs to manage the incentives associated with the initial measure, * Savings principle. Taxes must be as low as possible to avoid harming economic development. This explains why in 2011 Pichet advocated doing anything possible to reduce the deficit. He disagreed, however, with the proposal that France's Fillon government put forward in its September 2011 second Budget reading to raise taxes by €11 billion and cut spending by €1 billion. Rather than this to sustain the country's growth dynamic, he suggested parity between tax rises and spending cuts. * Convenience principle. Tax payments need to be made easy for taxpayers. This is congruent with the principle of intelligible taxation that France's Constitutional Council \\"Décision n° 2005-530 DC du 29 décembre 2005\\", www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr, 29/12/05 enacted around the turn of the century. =General Theory of Social and Tax Expenditures= In an initial study published 5 April 2012 in La Revue de droit fiscal\\"Tax Expenditure Theory and the Reform of French Loopholes\\", papers.ssrn.com, 18/04/12 Pichet distinguishes between simple tax determination modalities and actual tax loopholes, his idea being that fiscal advantages (like family allowances) awarded to dependent or disabled persons do not constitute tax loopholes but are instead ways of determining the amount of tax owed in France's benchmark tax system. His suggestion was that tax expenditures that are illegitimate (because they lack incentivising effects or are too costly or unfair) be eliminated. He set up a methodology that can be used to assess tax loopholes in terms of their level of usefulness and to eliminate any tax expenditures that serve no purpose. In 2016, Pichet published his General Theory of Social and Tax Expenditures in an article published in La Revue de droit fiscal dated 8 September 2016.\\"General Theory of Social and Tax Expenditures and Proposals for Recasting the French System of Tax 'Loopholes'\\", papers.ssrn.com, 08/09/2016 The theory is based on the idea that all compulsory levy systems are divided into six main categories called specific tax reference segments, each featuring a set of homogeneous fiscal standards enabling a methodical identification of relevant social and tax expenditures. Pichet followed this up with a rigorous doctrine in which individual exception provisions are identified using a series of six successive filters analysing their legitimacy, utility, relevance, efficiency, effectiveness and social acceptability. The analysis is prescriptive in nature and leads to a general doctrine in which each specific reference segment can be monitored. By including tax and social loopholes, Pichet theory achieves a more specific definition of social and tax expenditures, being ‘Any legislative, regulatory or administrative provision whose implementation translates into a public administration losing receipts that can be replaced by a budgetary expenditure; and which directly or indirectly reduces certain categories of taxpayers’ compulsory levies compared to what they would have paid had norms emanating from general legal principles been applied in the specific tax reference segment in question’. =Optimal income and wealth tax theory; the notion of fiscal exile= In a research paper published in the French Review La Revue de droit fiscal on November 15Th 2012, \\"The New French President’s Budgetary and Fiscal Doctrine: Constraints, Implementation and Consequences\\", papers.ssrn.com, 15/11/12 and in line with Arthur Laffer, Pichet explains that there is an optimal threshold above which tax yields decrease and become both marginally and globally negative due to the diminishing attractiveness of the country implementing the tax and international competition. Pichet has invented the expression \\"Fiscalité au Bollinger\\"Les conséquences de la doctrine budgétaire et fiscale actuelle, ifrap.org,12/11/12 or “Champagne Taxation” to illustrate this theory. Theory of central banking Drawing lessons from the 2007-2008 financial crisis, in a May 2013 Journal of Governance and Regulation article \\"Building the Foundations for a New Central Bank Doctrine: Redefining Central Banks’ Missions in the 21st Century\\", papers.ssrn.com, 01/05/2013 Pichet suggests a new central banking theory for the world's older industrialised countries. The idea is that central bankers in the Global North failed to anticipate the crisis but were still able to adopt emergency measures saving the banking and financial systems: conventional measures such as massive cuts in interest rates (and a similarly massive injection of liquidities into the bank system in exchange for strong guarantees, i.e. financial assets with an at least BBB- rating); and non-conventional measures, including huge purchases of state debt. The article strongly criticises the European Central Bank's May 2010 decision to purchase Greek state debt in large quantities (totalling €40 billion by 2013) at a time when the country was being downgraded. This policy ran counter to prudential doctrine, according to which central banks are only supposed to purchase investment grade assets. It also failed to lower Greek Treasury bond yields and exposed the ECB to heavy losses in case Greece defaulted. This contrasted with the actions taken by the US and UK central banks, who bought secure AA+ rated securities issued by their national governments. Hence Pichet's suggestion of a new doctrine appropriate for 21st century central banking, one redefining the concept of inflation to include not only consumer prices but also asset inflation, including shares, property and even bond market bubbles. There should also be a new tool distinguishing benign from dangerous asset inflation, with central banks being given a new mission of controlling leveraged asset price rises, based on the ready availability of short-term credit. Lastly, Pichet advocates reshaping central banks’ governance systems along three lines: independence (essential, notwithstanding certain actions taken by Japanese and Hungarian governments in 2013); accountability, based on greater strategic transparency; and redrawn boards of directors, not only featuring a better gender balance (an ongoing challenge, as witnessed by arguments about the BCE's 100% male board) but also and above all by co-opting members from a wider range of backgrounds. In his view, it is clear that appointing governors without any trading experience was a major factor in the BCE's strategic mistake of purchasing huge quantities of Greek state debt, subjecting taxpayers across the Eurozone to huge levels of risk. Participation in taxation debates Tax amnesty In 2004, Pichet and attorney Maurice Christian Bergerès co-authored a study into the economic advantages of a tax amnesty. \\"Deux experts pronostiquent « un échec » de l'amnistie\\", lemonde.fr, 06/08/04 Debates on the consequences of the « Trente Six Dispendieuses » “Trente Six Dispendieuses” (36 year bust or 1981–2016 years of extravagant spending from 1981-2011).\\"The Path of Public Finances from 2014 to 2017: The Helplessness of Law and Truth About Accounts\\", papers.ssrn.com, 11/17/2014 Debates on the French structural public deficit An article appearing in the 27 November 2014 issue of the Revue de Droit Fiscal has shown that the 2014 the French structural public deficit will be closer to 4% than the official 2.4%, due to the fact that the nation's growth potential has fallen by 1% per annum since the 2008 crisis broke out. This means it will be impossible to catch up with the pre-crisis growth trendline. Although the article contests neither the Haut Conseil des Finances Publiques' independence or competency, it does criticize this body's excessive caution and refusal to analyse the Government's calculations with any degree of seriousness. The Revue de Droit Fiscal article published in response by Mr. Migaud, in his capacity as Chair of the Haut Conseil des Finances Publiques, states that \\"Even if the Haut Conseil is not providing quantitative estimates for the output gap and structural deficit - estimates that would, by their very nature, be highly uncertain - it is clear in noting that the output gap that will be much lower than the one calculated by the Government, meaning that the structural deficit will be much higher\\".  The future of the French CADES and French tax innovation named CRDS  In a first paper published in 2000\\"Projet de loi relatif au financement de la sécurité sociale pour 2001\\", senat.fr, 11/09/2000 , Pichet analysed the French legislator’s to limit the life of the CADES Welfare Debt Repayment Fund and the CRDS Welfare Debt Repayment Tax both created in 1996 to enable full redemption of all outstanding debts that the different branches of the French Social Security system had accumulated over the period 1993-1995. He had doubted of the deadline fixed by the year 2008. In a second paper published in 2003\\"The Inexorable Apotheosis of France’s CADES and CRDS Welfare Debt Repayment Schemes\\", ssrn.com, 15/06/2020 he announced that the CADES fund and the CRDS tax would be being turned into permanent fixtures in France’s budgetary and fiscal landscape\\"Sécurité sociale: main basse sur le trou\\", page 154, 2004. In May 2020 he published a paper\\"The CADES: It’s Found Again. What? – Eternity\\", ssrn.com, 04/06/2020 showing that after several decisions pushing the Fund’s dissolution date back to 2024, thecovid-19 crisis having to contend with terrifying deficits in the country’s Health Insurance system, another reopening of the CADES fund was decided in May 2020 in order to postpone it again to 2033. Therefor there is little doubt that the CADES and CRDS are immortal. Moreover together with VAT, created in 1954 and imitated throughout the world, the CRDS is undoubtedly the greatest French innovation in the 20 tt century in terms of compulsory taxation. Public asset research A June 2005 study published in the Politiques et Management Public magazine \\"Le patrimoine de l'État : une évaluation au 1er janvier 2004\\", 06/2012 suggested creating a new field of scientific research operating at the border between economics and financial analysis – public asset research, based on a methodology that would count all assets held by the State (including intangible assets such as telephone frequency rights), together with all debts, from the explicit (State debt as per the Maastricht definition) to the implicit, like pension liabilities for civil servants. Having assessed the French State's net asset value at €1.1 trillion as of 1 January 2004, with total debt (implicit and explicit combined) reaching €2.5 trillion, the French State counted net liabilities of €1.4 trillion, much higher than in 1980. Epistemology for the Social Sciences Influenced by the thinking of Kurt Lewin, according to whom “Nothing is more practical than a good theory”, Pichet always tries to develop social science theories that have practical consequences. Also influenced by Paul Feyerabend, he maintains the necessity of a constructivist epistemology that is specific to social sciences. \\"If we consider the most complex object in the universe (besides the universe itself) to be the human brain, then human societies, and particularly the societies of the hypermodern era into which we have entered and which are the fruit of the interaction of thousands of human minds, and even, since globalisation and the advent of the internet, of the interaction of billions of human minds, are far and away the most complex entities there are to study\\". \\"L’art de l’HDR\\", page 115, Éric PICHET, 2011 Debates on the future of the Bitcoin In an article published in the French Edition of The Conversation \\"Le bitcoin, bulle spéculative ou valeur d’avenir ?\\", theconversation.com, 28/11/2017 dated 28 November 2017 Pichet warns against the bubble of the Bitcoin : \\" the raise of the Bitcoin above 10 000 dollars is typically an archetypal bubble Like all crypto-currencies, it has no intrinsic value, not even as a collector’s item, due to its immateriality. As a result and unlike official currencies, it can never be booked as a central bank or financial institution liability. Nor is it a financial asset like a stock or bond, since it generates no return. The only investment value resides in the higher price that prospective buyers are willing to pay. In short, bitcoin is a commodity lacking an underlying asset, with investors only able to recover their initial currency stake if someone buys their holdings off of them. Even more than the 2000 dot.com bubble, this speculative instrument probably constitutes the first hyper-modern bubble, given its complete immateriality. The globalised network means there are potentially 7 billion buyers (especially since it can be divided up to eight decimal points), largely explaining the funnel effect materialising, inter alia, in the first bitcoin futures contract that began trading in December 2017. \\" However, he notes that blockchain and decentralised transaction validation mechanisms hold real promise and are likely to become the most interesting legacy from this adventure. In the future, secure decentralised systems using blockchain-like innovations will rival traditional trusted third parties (banks, notaries, etc.), if only because they cost less. In and of itself, this would be a revolution. Any remotely lucid observer knows that even if it were possible to short-sell bitcoin, the strategy is prohibited and potentially disastrous. After all, it is impossible to predict how long and how high this speculative wave is going to go. As Keynes once wrote, \\"A market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent\\". All that is left is to sit this one out and wait for the rivers of fortune to carry off bitcoin and its debris. Publications * 2001: Éric Pichet.

It is native to North America, where it occurs from the Northwest Territories to Ontario in Canada and as far south as New Mexico and Kansas in the United States.

Journal of Range Management. 26(3) 212-14. Each stem has up to 12 leaves up to long by wide. The leaves tend to roll up during dry conditions. The inflorescence is a panicle up to long. The spikelet is pale and shiny.Wynia, R. & W. Duckwitz. (2006). Calamovilfa longifolia. USDA NRCS Plant Fact Sheet. Retrieved 12-14-2011. The fruit is a caryopsis a few millimeters in length which has a ring of long hairs around its base. These help the seeds disperse on the wind. The plant may reproduce sexually via seed, but most of its reproduction is vegetative as the plant sprouts from the starchy tips of its rhizomes. Plants growing in moist, disturbed habitat and recently burned areas are most likely to produce seeds. This grass occurs in several types of habitat, including many types of grassland and prairie, pine and hardwood forest, sagebrush, and pinyon-juniper woodland, and dunes such as those on the margins of the Great Lakes. The plant grows in climates featuring hot summers, cold winters, and moderate precipitation. It is a dominant grass species in many regions, including the Nebraska Sand Hills Retrieved 12-14-2011. and other sand hills, the Red River Valley, many prairies and grasslands of the Great Plains, and certain beaches along the Great Lakes, such as those at Kohler-Andrae State Park and Point Beach State Forest in Wisconsin. Though it is not one of the most palatable or nutritious grasses, this species is an important forage for livestock in sand hills regions. It begins growth earlier in the season than many other grasses. Some species of wildlife utilize it for food, such as California quail and pocket gophers. Waterfowl and black-tailed prairie dogs use it for cover. This grass is useful for stabilizing soil and preventing erosion because its robust rhizome easily holds loose, sandy soils. It can be used in revegetation efforts in disturbed habitat with sandy substrates, such as blowouts. A number of cultivars have been developed, including 'Goshen' and 'Pronghorn'. Pests of the grass include grasshoppers and the rust fungus Puccinia amphigena.

He is best known for his compositions, including Five Folk Songs for Soprano and Band which has become a reputable work in contemporary band music repertoire. Life Dr. Bernard Gilmore was born in Oakland, California and, shortly thereafter, raised in southern California by his parents Bernard Gilmore Sr. and Rose (Virginia) Gilmore née Vineburg. He has one older sister named Caroline. Gilmore attended Van Nuys Junior High and High School, at which time began to play the French horn and become active in both solo and ensemble performance. Gilmore was in numerous honor groups, including the California Junior Symphony Orchestra directed by Peter Merenblum. He studied the French horn under instructors Fred Fox and Sinclair Lott and was a member of the Los Angeles Horn Club. Gilmore received his B.A and M.A. in composition from UCLA, and his D.M.A. in conducting from Stanford University. In 1959, he married pianist Phyllis Sandra Markin, who would eventually contribute to many performances of his solo piano works. Gilmore performed in Bruckner's Symphony No. 7 with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Eduard van Beinum and under Georg Solti in a performance of Stravinsky's Sacre du Printemps, as well as with the Boston Pops Tour Orchestra on a ten-week tour of the United States.Classical Composers Database: Bernard Gilmore As a professor, he taught at Cornell University and Oregon State University before finally joining the faculty of UCI in 1982. Gilmore retired in 2006 and died while living in Irvine, California after long suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He is particularly remembered for his dedication to working with students, both as a conductor and classroom instructor. Composition Bernard Gilmore began composing at age 24 and continued to write while on faculty at Cornell University.Cornell University Wind Ensemble #29, Marice Stith (March 22, 1981) KM 6945, program notes In 1961, he completed his first major work: Four Poems of Dylan Thomas for tenor and orchestra. Shortly after, Gilmore moved to teach at Oregon State University where he continued to compose music such as Three Little Madrigals (1969) and Symphonic Movement for orchestra (1971). While teaching at UCI, he composed the majority of his works in addition to being the orchestra director, instructor of low brass (French horn, trombone, tuba), instructor of music theory, orchestration, composition, and music literature-history. In 1982, Gilmore accepted a position as Visiting Assistant Professor of Music at UCI, where he spent the remainder of his educational career. Bird of Time (1983) is a work for violin and orchestra, written for violinist Zina Schiff, and premiered with the Irvine Symphony Orchestra conducted by Gilmore on October 4, 1983.Bernard Gilmore Musical Scores. MS-F036. Special Collections and Archives, The UC Irvine Libraries, Irvine, California. It was performed later that year in New York at the Abraham Goodman House in an arrangement for violin and piano. In 1986, when the International Chamber Consort commissioned a work for its 1986-87 European concert tour, Gilmore created Concertino for trumpet, xylophone, and orchestra (1986), intended to be performed by the Duisburg Symphony Orchestra as part of a festival of American music in the cities of Aachen and Düsseldorf. Later that year, he went on sabbatical to Netanya, Israel, where he composed a one-act opera, Lord Byron's Love Letter (1986). In 1998, he was commissioned by the University of Wisconsin to compose a piece for their symphonic band's tour of the British Isles. Gilmore's Isles Tryptych was the featured work for this tour. Three Miniatures for Violin and Piano was written for faculty members Haroutune Bedelian and Lorna Griffitt in 1992 and subsequently recorded by this duo. Coffee Date, a one-act comic opera was presented at UCI in 1998 with vocalists and piano, and was later performed with vocalists and chamber orchestra in 2003. Breed Street (2007), a work for orchestra evoking the spirit of the Breed Street Synagogue in Los Angeles, was his last piece written at UCI, and was performed by the UCI Orchestra conducted by Stephen Tucker in 2006, shortly before Gilmore retired. An accumulation of many of his compositions were performed for his retirement concert, \\"A tribute to Bernard Gilmore\\", given that same year at UCI. It included numerous chamber and solo works written for UCI students and faculty, including Two Songs from Torah, sung by Awet Andemicael who originally commissioned the compositions for her Masters Recital in 1999. At that same concert Pianojazz (1990), a large-scale jazz-influenced work for solo piano, was performed by UCI faculty jazz pianist Kei Akagi. Gilmore's compositions influenced the work of other composers including Mark Riley, Jason Barabba, Timothy Melbinger, Kendra d’Ercole, Maxim Vladimiroff, and Darren Wilsey. Style Bernard Gilmore's composition style changed significantly throughout the duration of his life. His earlier works, notably the Five Folk Songs for soprano and wind band, are historically themed and utilize a strong sense of melodic foundation. His later works are genuinely innovative in the scheme of modern music, exploring the vast realm of harmonic chromaticism and atonality. However, even in his later works, such as Coffee Date, he retains the purity of the melody, both in lyric text and instrumentation. Gilmore uses both original and published texts to bind his works together in the most creative manner. His close working with students helped adapt his style for each performer. Five Folk Songs Gilmore's signature piece, Five Folk Songs for Soprano and Band, is a [folk song] arrangement composed in 1963 for the annual conference of the College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) and published by Maecenas Music, has enjoyed countless performances nationwide and internationally.Classical Archives This composition is the first major work written expressly for soprano and band and was awarded \\"Best Original Composition\\" at the CBDNA Biennial Conference in 1967.Humboldt State University Department of Music, Paul Cummings: Director's Notes for Symphonic Band Five Folk Songs for Soprano and Band contains five movements, each of which is in a different language. The complexity of the soprano having to learn a variety of languages can make the work difficult to learn. Nevertheless, the piece has been widely adopted as standard music repertoire in the university setting. Works Gilmore's original works are located at the UCI Special Collections and Archives.

The film won the Golden Prize at the 7th Moscow International Film Festival in 1971 and the Prix lntemational de l'Academie du Cinema at the Étoile de Cristal Awards in 1972. Plot Police Captain Bonavia (Balsam) arranges the release of a criminally insane prisoner, Michele Lipuma, who immediately sets about settling a score with a local construction magnate, Ferdinando Dubrosio. As Bonavia follows Lipuma's initial movements, it becomes clear that Bonavia orchestrated his release for that outcome. Lipuma's attempt to kill Dubrosio fails—Dubrosio was tipped off somehow and left three gunmen in his place...all of whom, including Lipuma, end up dead. D.A. Traini (Nero), energetic and idealistic, takes over the case and is informed by Bonavia of the stranglehold Dubrosio has over the local construction industry, and how he and various government officials game the system for their own benefit. As the case unfolds, Traini realizes that Bonavia masterminded the events as intricately as any criminal, and vows to bring him down. Traini believes whole-heartedly in the system and its officials, refusing to accept corruption of any official, but is countered by Bonavia, who explains that all he has to do to derail Traini is muddy the water with slander. Central to the overall case is the whereabouts of Lipuma's sister, Serena, who was once involved with Dubrosio and privy to many of the conversations held between Dubrosio and the government officials. As witnesses to Dubrosio's activities tend to disappear, when Bonavia finds Serena, he puts her in a safe house known only to himself. Traini finally decides to start the prosecution of Bonavia, prompting Bonavia to write a full confession, including the murder of Dubrosio, which he then commits while Traini is reading the confession. Bonavia immediately turns himself in, and when the arrest is mentioned on TV, Serena calls the courthouse to enquire...only to have Dubrosio's thugs arrive at the safe house, claiming to be sent by the court. She is unceremoniously killed, encased in a concrete, and incorporated into a local construction project. From prison, Bonavia questions whether Traini will investigate how Dubrosio found out where Serena was hidden...as it was only after she contacted the courthouse...but Traini refuses to consider any possible collusion between parties. He reassures Bonavia that the system has integrity and will serve justice in the end. Bonavia responds that prison is a different world, and one where Traini holds no influence. Bonavia is duly killed in prison, eliminating the last 'loose thread'. With that, Traini realizes that the word could only have come from the Attorney-General himself, who smugly smiles and asks \\"Is something wrong?\\" when finally confronted.

Up to 22 October 2009 it was a separate borough of Mönchengladbach. Previously it had been part of Rheydt, which was suburbanized with Mönchengladbach in 1975. On 30 June 2007, Giesenkirchen had 15,853 inhabitants. Of these, 9,130 lived in the district of Giesenkirchen-Mitte, 4,431 in Giesenkirchen-Nord and 2,292 in Schelsen.  History  The name Giesenkirchen was first recorded in 1150, in a deed now held in the historical archives of Cologne. This deed mentions the donation of a newly-cleared plot of land, the so-called Neubruchzehnt, made by the provost of St. Gereon in Cologne. The land was gifted to the church of Giesenkirchen under the condition that future small repairs to the roof and sacristy of the church would be paid for by the parishioners. Until the start of the French occupation in October 1794, Giesenkirchen belonged to the Electorate of Cologne. Under French rule, the territorial boundaries were abolished.  Politics  In the election for District Council in September 2004, the CDUreached 43.3% (6 seats), the SPD 25.4% (3 seats), the Free Democratic Party (FDP) 4.7% (1 seat), The Greens 8.3% (1 seat) and the FWG 16.1% (2 seats) of the votes. For District Frank Boss (CDU) was elected. As of 2009 the Council Members were Giesenkirchen North: Horst-Peter Vennen (SPD), Giesenkirchen- South: Ralf Kremer (CDU). From 2004 to 2009, the CDU in Giesenkirchen lost over 50% of their votes. In 2000, Hans-Willi Körfges (SPD), a native of Giesenkirchen, became a member of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia.  Schools  The first school was a Catholic parish school whose origin is unknown. It is documented that in 1571 \\"uff Remigii\\" became the master. In 1809 on the south side of the church, the congregation built a school building with a classroom. With the introduction of compulsory education in 1825 a second classroom was added. On 19 October 1868 the school was inaugurated as Meerkamp and approved for teaching. An extension was created in 1898. The school reached its final form with the construction of a new building with four classrooms, teaching materials and teachers' lounge room in 1912. For the Protestant students from Schelsen, in 1846 a private school was opened. The cost was covered by voluntary contributions and a grant from Gustav-Adolf- Verein. Because of the low number of students it was dissolved in 1945. A public Protestant elementary school began in 1947 in the building of the Catholic elementary school. In 1959 they moved into a free-standing building on Fries Road. A new school building was for the Protestant Elementary School in the years 1965/1966, prepared by the city at Rheydt Asternweg. In 1968, the existing school system was divided into an elementary school and secondary school. Giesenkirchen emerged at the beginning of 1968 as a Catholic primary school. A Protestant primary school was set up in the building Friesenstraße. At the beginning of the school year 1969/1970 the school was converted into a Primary School. Due to low student numbers, the Catholic elementary school at Bauerstraße was dissolved in 1969.

It was the 9th UFC event of the year, and took place on April 21, 2012 at the Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. Background The headline fight at UFC 145 was a UFC Light Heavyweight Championship contest between champion Jon Jones and challenger Rashad Evans. Jones and Evans are former teammates at Jackson's MMA, under the tutelage of coach Greg Jackson. Evans was one of Jackson's most successful fighters, and was a core member of his training camp. Being in the same weightclass, and a long-time member of Jackson's MMA, the UFC veteran Evans naturally took the young and inexperienced fighter Jones under his wing. In the months leading to UFC 145, the two engaged in a bitter and public feud. At UFC 128 (March 19, 2011), Evans was expected to fight for the Light Heavyweight title against then- champion Mauricio Rua. However, a knee injury forced Evans off of the card. Needing an opponent for Rua at UFC 128, the UFC offered Jones the match. Jones accepted, with Evans' blessing. Shortly afterwards, Jones stated in an interview with MMA reporter Ariel Helwani he would be willing to fight Evans if the UFC asked. Evans felt betrayed by his teammate and friend, starting a feud which forced Evans to leave Jackson's MMA. Evans then joined the Imperial Athletics camp in Florida. Since UFC 128, Jones had defended his championship twice against former champions (Quinton Jackson and Lyoto Machida). Evans had defeated former champion Tito Ortiz, as well as Phil Davis, to setting the stage for \\"the most anticipated Light Heavyweight bout since Chuck Liddell fought Tito Ortiz\\". This was the third scheduled contest between the two. The first match was scrapped due to a hand injury to Jones, the second because of a thumb injury to Evans. UFC Primetime returned to promote the main event. Matt Wiman was expected to face Mark Bocek at this event, but was forced off the card with an injury and replaced by the returning John Alessio. John Makdessi weighed in two pounds over the Lightweight limit. He was fined 20 percent of his purse, and his fight with Anthony Njokuani became a catchweight bout at 158 lb. Event 15,545 fans filled Philips Arena to witness UFC 145 and the grudge match between Jones and Evans. The event consisted of twelve mixed martial arts bouts, sanctioned by the Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission and contested under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. All bouts were scheduled for three five-minute rounds except for the main event championship match between Jones and Evans, which was five five-minute rounds. Two of the preliminary fights were streamed on Facebook, and four were televised on FX. Attendance was 15,545, with a gate of $2,200,000. The pay- per-view buyrate was 700,000. Preliminary card All but one of the event's six preliminary fights went the full three rounds, ending in a decision. The first bout of the evening was between Maximo Blanco and Marcus Brimage. After three uneventful rounds between the hesitant fighters, the judges scored the contest 29–28 Blanco, 30–27 Brimage, and 29–28 for the winner by split decision, Marcus Brimage. Immediately after the fight concluded, Blanco executed a backflip, which was mimicked by Brimage. The two fighters then engaged in an impromptu backflip competition to the delight of the fans. In the second match, Keith Wisniewski took on UFC newcomer Chris Clements. In the first round, Wisniewski clinched and dragged Clements to the mat, and passed to full mount. Clements regained half guard as Wisniewski landed hard shots. With two minutes left in the round, referee Fernando Yamasaki issued a controversial stand-up order. Following the stand-up, Clements dropped Wisniewski with a turning kick to the body. Wisniewski recovered and the two traded punches shortly before the round ended. After a close second round, Clements controlled the third, landing powerful right hand punches and dropping Wisniewski with a knee. He closed out the fight with strong ground-and-pound as time expired, sending the fight to the judges for a decision. The judges scored the bout 29–28 Clements, 29–28 Wisniewski, and 30–27 for the winner by split decision, Chris Clements. In the third bout, Mac Danzig fought Efrain Escudero. In the first round, Escudero unsuccessfully attempted a heel hook submission. Danzig proceeded to take Escudero's back and attempt a rear-naked choke in one motion, but Escudero escaped. After three close rounds, the bout went to a decision. The judges scored it 30–27, 30–27, and 29–28 for Mac Danzig, the winner by unanimous decision. The fourth match pitted Anthony Njokuani against taekwondo fighter John Makdessi. The first round was defined by kicks. While Makdessi was the aggressor, Njokuani landed more kicks. In the second round, Njokuani continued to use his reach advantage to land kicks and punches. Makdessi could not get his timing down and Njokuani continued to counter. The third round was more of the same until the horn sounded, and all three judges scored the bout 30–27 for the winner by unanimous decision, Anthony Njokuani. In the fifth fight, Stephen Thompson faced Matt Brown. In the first two rounds, Thompson had success striking on the feet but had trouble stopping Brown's takedowns. Thompson started the second round strong, wobbling Brown with kicks and punches. Brown then knocked Thompson down with an elbow and, from the top, landed elbows and punches which opened a cut on Thompson's face. Brown dominated the third round by securing a mounted crucifix and then a mounted triangle. Brown finished out the fight by pummeling a bloody Thompson until the horn sounded. The judges scored the bout 30–27, 29–27, and 30–27 for Matt Brown, the winner by unanimous decision. In the sixth bout of the evening, heavyweights Travis Browne and Chad Griggs squared off. In the first round, Browne secured a takedown and landed in half guard. Browne easily transitioned into the full mount position and quickly secured an arm triangle choke. Griggs tapped out at 2:29 of the first round, in the first finish of the night. The UFC awarded Browne with the \\"Submission of the Night\\" bonus award for his performance. Main card Shot of The Octagon from UFC 74: Clay Guida vs. Marcus Aurelio. The first bout on the main card was a lightweight match between Mark Bocek and John Alessio. Bocek started strong and dominated the first round after a takedown. From there, he landed several big elbows. He continued to grapple and soften up Alessio with punches until the end of the round. Both men slowed down in the second round, but Bocek controlled the action. In the final round, Bocek transitioned to full back mount from a body triangle on Alessio. However, Bocek failed to fully apply a rear-naked choke, and Alessio escaped. Neither fighter could finish the fight before time ended, and the fight went to a decision. The three judges scored the bout 30–27, 29–28, and 30–27 for Mark Bocek, the winner by unanimous decision. The next fight was between two featherweight fighters, Mark Hominick and Eddie Yagin. Hominick survived the first round after being knocked down by a right uppercut/left hook combination from Yagin. At the start of the second round, Hominick looked less tired than Yagin. Hominick landed solid punches until Yagin landed another big shot of his own. Yagin followed up with hard shots on the ground but, once again, Hominick recovered. Hominick peppered Yagin in the third round with hooks and jabs, while Yagin threw power shots. Hominick continued to land punches throughout the round, and both fighter's faces were bruised and bloody by the end. The fight ended in a split decision. The first judge scored the bout 29–28 for Yagin. The second scored it 29–28 for Hominick. The third scored it 29–28 in favor of the winner, Eddie Yagin.

Chandler, Mifflin Gibbs, and Leroy Pierce. Jasper Alston Atkins (August 8, 1898 - June 28, 1982) was an attorney, activist, and educator. Early life Jasper Alston Atkins was born August 8, 1898, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina to Dr. Simon Green Atkins and Mrs. Oleona Pegram Atkins. Prior to Jasper's birth, his parents founded the Slater Industrial Academy on September 28, 1892. Jasper would attend this school, and upon his graduation in 1915 the name was changed to Slater State Normal School. The institution became Winston-Salem State Teacher's College in 1925 and Winston-Salem State University in 1969. College In September 1915, Atkins matriculated to Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. As a freshman, he won the first prize in oratory, earning a similar success at graduation. While at Fisk, Atkins competed on the debate team and was initiated into the Omega Psi Phi fraternity through the Camp Howard chapter in 1918. He graduated magna cum laude from Fisk in 1919. Law school Upon graduation, Atkins received a scholarship to attend Yale Law School in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1920 he served as editor to the esteemed Yale Law Journal, the first time a black person had ever done so. Further, Atkins was charged with the task of creating a scientific index for the thirty one volumes of legal periodicals in the Yale Law Library. As he graduated Yale Law School cum laude with his LL.B. in June 1922, Atkins was elected to the Order of the Coif honor society, the first black to ever earn such a distinction.J. Clay Smith Jr., Emancipation: The Making of the Black Lawyer, 1844-1944 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 39. Omega Psi Phi Atkins was instrumental in the founding of Delta Chapter of Omega Psi Phi in 1919, which had its origins at Fisk but amidst university dissent was forced to relocate to Meharry Medical College just down the street. He was a charter member of Chi Chapter at Yale University in 1920, along with several other Yale Law students and members of the New Haven community, and served as the Chapter's first Basileus (president). At the 10th Grand Conclave in Atlanta, Atkins was elected Grand Basileus (national president) in December 1921. He maintained these duties while a student in law school, serving in office until 1924. Under his tenure as Grand Basileus, Atkins reorganized the Fraternity in a number of significant ways. First, he created the office of Vice Grand Basileus, whose responsibility it was to oversee the expansion of Omega. Next, he amended the role of the Grand Keeper of Records (national Secretary) to Grand Keeper of Records and Seals, which turned the focus of the office from mere record keeper to active record shaper, and added the position of Grand Keeper of Finance. Atkins also established five geographic regions, or districts, to better attend to the needs of various colleges and communities within Omega, which by that time (1922) spanned New England down to the Southeastern States, the Midwest out to the far West.Herman Dreer, The History of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity: A Brotherhood of Negro College Men, 1911-1939 (Washington, D.C.: The Fraternity, 1940), p. 38-40, 51-4. Lastly, Atkins commissioned the ritual to be composed at Chi Chapter in New Haven, but its chief composer, a Yale Law School student by the name of Warren Westmoreland Purdy (initiated at Beta Chapter), died suddenly on June 9, 1922 during its composition. The ritual would then be completed at the next Grand Conclave, held in Philadelphia.\\"Chi Chapter Loses Two Brothers,\\" Oracle 1, no. 3 (1922): 17-19. Legal career Following his graduation of Yale Law School in 1922, Atkins moved to Muskogee, Oklahoma to open a law firm with Carter Walker Wesley, a Northwestern Law School graduate and fellow Fraternity brother who was initiated at the Fraternity's Ft.

By 1927, Atkins and Wesley relocated the firm to Houston, Texas, a short time after which the two were joined by James Nabrit, Jr. to form the firm of Nabrit, Atkins, & Wesley. Also in 1927, Atkins was admitted to practice law before the U.S. Supreme Court. In 1935, he argued the case of Grovey v. Townsend, a landmark civil rights case in which Grovey was denied an absentee ballot for voting in a Texas primary election. The case resulted in defeat, but it was overruled a nearly a decade later by the Court's decision in Smith v. Allwright. Atkins briefly served as editor of the Informer and Texas Freeman (Houston) before returning to his home state of North Carolina.

It uses centrifugal force to separate the water from the leaves, enabling salad dressing to stick to the leaves without dilution. Salad spinners are usually made from plastic and include an outer bowl with an inner removable colander or strainer basket. A cover, which fits around the outside bowl, contains a spinning mechanism that when initiated causes the inside strainer to rotate rapidly. The water is driven through the slits in the basket into the outer bowl. There are a number of different mechanisms used to operate the device, including crank handles, push buttons and pull-cords. The salad spinner is generally easy to use, though its large and rigid shape has been criticized by food editor Leanne Kitchen and Herald-Journal reporter Mary Hunt. A salad spinner is often considered bulky and difficult to store. Although devices used to wash, dry and spin salad have long been in existence, including one from the 19th century, the modern mechanism-operated spinner originated in the early 1970s. Two patents by French designers, Jean Mantelet and Gilberte Fouineteau, were particularly influential in the early development of the product's design. In 1974, the Mouli Manufacturing Co. introduced a crank-operated salad spinner to the American market; other companies were not far behind with their own patented variations. The product sold favorably and demand was high, with stores struggling to keep it in stock. Despite the product's popularity, however, it was not entirely without criticism; some were skeptical about the necessity of \\"another gourmet gadget\\". History Although the invention of the salad spinner is considered to be modern, earlier devices, including one from the 19th century, did exist and performed similar functions. When the salad spinner was introduced to the mass market in the 1970s, a number of other techniques and products were already available and employed for the drying of vegetables and salad. One such device was a wire basket dryer, in essence a collapsible colander, which could be shaken or spun to expel the excess water. This method has been criticized by some for its impracticalities and according to one writer, the process was \\"akin to standing near a dog that’s shaking himself dry.\\" Another product was a wire lettuce dryer designed for use in the sink. A basket was fixed with suction cups to the bottom of the sink, and pushing a pump caused the basket to spin around a center post, often spraying expelled water on the operator. Paper or fabric towels were also commonly used for drying salad and vegetables after washing, however the method was perceived as time-consuming and costly. Early patents In 1971, Jean Mantelet filed a patent for a \\"Salad Dryer,\\" a hand-operated, centrifugally-driven device along with another called the \\"Household Drying Machine\\" which could also be used for salads. Mantelet was a prominent designer of domestic appliances and the founder of the French company Moulinex. He patented another salad dryer device in 1974. Mantelet was particularly proud of his salad dryer design. Of the new product, one user commented that, \\"it saves shaking my salad basket out of the kitchen window.\\" Gilberte Fouineteau, another French inventor, has been credited as the creator of the modern salad spinner. He filed a patent for a device in 1973. It too used centrifugal force to dry and drain vegetables and salads. The patent describes its difference being the removable basket and a lack of a central post. American market The Mouli Manufacturing Co., a kitchen supply brand, introduced the salad dryer to the American market in 1974. Others companies soon followed with their own, similar versions of the device. The salad spinner proved to be an immediate success however it was not without some skepticism. The product received criticism for being “another gourmet gadget” and the latest piece of “kitchen junk” to add to the growing list of new appliances which included hot dog cookers, cookie shooters and electric potato peelers. Despite reservations, the salad dryer was selling well in the American market. Over the five-year period since the product's introduction, sales of the dryer had quadrupled, with an estimated 500,000 units said to have been sold in 1978 alone. Cookware stores were unable to keep hold with demand and reported being out of stock of the device. The product even appealed to skeptics and was thought to be a time saver compared to the “tedious hand method of patting dry each leaf” that was known for leaving \\"soggy linen\\" and towels. A report at the time estimated that the money spent on a month's supply of paper towel reserved for drying lettuce could easily be enough to pay for a new salad dryer. Design Salad spinners are usually made from plastic. The design is an outer bowl with an inner, removable colander or strainer basket. A cover, which fits around the outside bowl, contains a spinning mechanism which causes the inside strainer to rotate rapidly. There are a number of different mechanisms used to operate the device, including the use of a crank handle, push button or pull-cord. ;Crank or handle : This is the original design, and still very popular. It works through a system of gears. The handle or crank is turned in a circular motion, which rotates a gear. This is connected to another gear that turns the basket. Critics describe it as \\"cumbersome\\", saying the motion is awkward. The crank style is thought to require more physical effort than the other spinning mechanisms. ;Pull cord : Operated by pulling a cord. This type is thought to be gentler on the greens than the push button method. ;Push or pump button : this spinner is operated by pushing down on a pump which initiates the basket spinning. There is a button which when pressed stops the centrifuge motion as well as a lock to secure the pump down for easier storage. ;Electrically powered : Scaled-up, electrically driven spinners are a more powerful version of the device. They are used in commercial or industrial operations and can spin many pounds of salad at one time. Usage A salad spinner in use Raw leaves in a salad need to be clean as well as dry. Salad which has not been properly washed can be potentially harmful, although generally the risk of illness is low. Listeria, E. coli, and other causes of food poisoning have been known to be present in unwashed salads. Costas Katsigris suggests that an increased rise in foodborne illness outbreaks has encouraged the use of salad washers and spinners. Drying the leaves for the salad is important as salad dressings and oils do not stick well to wet lettuce or salad leaves. Salad greens left in water for a long period of time will go limp, and fragile salad leaves can be easily damaged and bruised if handled harshly during the washing and drying process. The greens are placed in the colander section of the spinner and the container is filled with water. The floating salad is spun and left to sit before the water is poured out. This process can be repeated until no visible traces of dirt or sand remain. Once drained, the greens are spun, which generates a centripetal force that drives the excess moisture, through the perforation in the central strainer, to the outer bowl. Salad spinners are considered to be an easy product to use and operate, but have been criticized for being bulky, space-consuming and difficult-to-store.

Waddow Hall has been managed by Girlguiding since 1927.  History  The Waddow estate and the Parish of Waddington were managed by Roger de Tempest of Bracewell, Lord of Waddington in 1267. Waddow Hall was built by the Tempest family during the Tudor period, and the estate and lands remained in the Tempest family until 1657, when Richard Tempest died in a debtors' prison. Waddow hall overlooks the River Ribble. Following Richard Tempest's death in prison, the land and buildings of the Waddow estate were acquired in 1658 by Christopher Wilkinson of Clitheroe, an out-bailiff and later a Member of Parliament. Wilkinson bequeathed the estate and buildings to his nephew John Weddell of Widdington in 1693 (rather than to his own son whom he suspected of popery) and the property remained in the Weddell family until 1778, when Thomas Weddell bequeathed them to Sir John Ramsden. Waddow remained in the Ramsden family until the mid-1800s, when it was sold to William Garnett by Sir John Ramsden, 5th Baronet. The Girl Guides Association rented the Estate between 1927 and 1928, using it as an activity centre, and purchased it for £9,000 from William Garnett's son on 16 October 1928. During the Second World War the estate was lent to Lancashire County Council, and served as an isolation hospital for children.  Haunting  According to local folklore the estate is haunted by the ghost of O'Nell, a former servant at the hall, who was either murdered by her mistress, or died in an accidental fall. The legend suggests that O'Nell was sent to fetch water from a well, when her mistress cast a spell on her, causing her to slip and die, or had expressed the wish that she fall. In November 2004 the British paranormal reality television show Most Haunted broadcast an episode from Waddow Hall.

It is based on dissolution in order to separate PVC from other materials or impurities.  Background  A major factor of the recycling of polyvinyl chloride waste is the purity of the recycled material. In most composite materials, PVC is among several other materials, such as wood, metal, or textile. To make new products from the recycled PVC, it is necessary to separate it from other materials. Traditional recycling methods are not sufficient and expensive because this separation has to be done manually and product by product. VinyLoop is a recycling process which separates PVC from other materials through a process of dissolution, filtration and separation of contamination. A solvent is used in a closed loop to elute PVC from the waste. This makes it possible to recycle composite structure PVC waste, which would normally be incinerated or put in a landfill site.http://www.ifu.com/uploads/tx_ifureference/Umberto_Success_Solvay_en.pdf  Process  The process consists of the following steps: # Pre-treatment: waste plastics are cleaned, ground and mixed # Dissolution: a specific solvent is used to selectively dissolve the PVC compound in a closed loop # Filtration: impurities which have not been dissolved are removed through filtration—they are separated by type of material by filtration, centrifugation and decantation. After separation, the secondary materials are washed with pure solvent to dissolve all remaining PVC compounds # Precipitation of the regenerated PVC compound: the solution of PVC is recovered in a precipitation tank, where steam is injected to evaporate the solvent and precipitate the PVC.

From 1952, he was lektor (assistant professor) at Stockholm University, and from 1969, he was Professor of Applied Mathematics at Linköping University. (Webpage of Professor Åke Björck at Linköping University) Early life Hans Rådström was the son of the writer and editor Karl Johan Rådström, and the elder brother of the writer and journalist Pär Rådström. Rådström studied mathematics and obtained his Ph.D. under the joint supervision of Torsten Carleman and Fritz Carlson. His early work pertained to the theory of functions of a complex variable, particularly, complex dynamics. He was appointed lektor (assistant professor) at Stockholm University in 1952. Later, he was associated with the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In 1952 he became co-editor of the Scandinavian popular-mathematics journal Nordisk Matematisk Tidskrift. He also edited the Swedish edition of The Scientific American Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions, a recreational mathematics book by Martin Gardner., see Set-valued analysis Lars Hörmander (pictured) proved a variant of Rådström's embedding theorem using support functions. Per Enflo (pictured) wrote his doctoral thesis under the supervision of Hans Rådström. Rådström was interested in Hilbert's fifth problem on the analyticity of the continuous operation of topological groups. The solution of this problem by Andrew Gleason used constructions of subsets of topological vector spaces, (rather than simply points), and inspired Rådström's research on set-valued analysis. He visited the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton from 1948 to 1950, where he co-organized a seminar on convexity. Together with Olof Hanner, who, like Rådström, would earn his Ph.D. from Stockholm University in 1952, he improved Werner Fenchel's version of Carathéodory's lemma. In the 1950s, he obtained important results on convex sets. He proved the Rådström embedding theorem, which implies that the collection of all nonempty compact convex subsets of a normed real vector- space (endowed with the Hausdorff distance) can be isometrically embedded as a convex cone in a normed real vector-space. Under the embedding, the nonempty compact convex sets are mapped to points in the range space. In Rådström's construction, this embedding is additive and positively homogeneous. Rådström's approach used ideas from the theory of topological semi-groups. Later, Lars Hörmander proved a variant of this theorem for locally convex topological vector spaces using the support function (of convex analysis); in Hörmander's approach, the range of the embedding was the Banach lattice L1, and the embedding was isotone. : Rådström characterized the generators of continuous semigroups of sets as compact convex sets. Students Rådström's Ph.D. students included Per Enflo and Martin Ribe, both of whom wrote Ph.D. theses in functional analysis. In the uniform and Lipschitz categories of topological vector spaces, Enflo's results concerned spaces with local convexity, especially Banach spaces. In 1970,: Hans Rådström died of a heart attack. Enflo supervised one of Rådström's Linköping students, Lars-Erik Andersson, from 1970–1971, helping him with his 1972 thesis, On connected subgroups of Banach spaces, on Hilbert's fifth problem for complete, normed spaces. The Swedish functional analyst Edgar Asplund, then Professor of Mathematics at Aarhus University in Denmark, assisted Ribe as supervisor of his 1972 thesis,Acknowledgement in before dying of cancer in 1974. Ribe's results concerned topological vector spaces without assuming local convexity; Ribe constructed a counter-example to naive extensions of the Hahn–Banach theorem to topological vector spaces that lack local convexity.

After his death in a car accident in 2009,In Memoriam: Jared Franklin Purton (1976–2009) the Jared F. Purton Foundation was set up in his memory to support charitable causes in the San Diego area.  Biography  Purton was born in Box Hill, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne, and grew up in Sale, Victoria until the end of primary school. He then moved to Surrey Hills, Victoria where he attended Camberwell High School until the end of Year 10. He completed Years 11 and 12 at Camberwell Grammar School. Purton was an avid sportsman and longstanding member of the Camberwell Hockey Club. He was a supporter of the Essendon Football Club in the Australian Football League, the association football teams Celtic F.C. and Norwich City F.C., and the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association. Purton also achieved certifications in open water and rescue scuba diving, and logged over a hundred dives. A health scare in Purton's family prompted him to embark on a career as a medical research scientist. He helped organise fundraisers for cancer research, and volunteered his time at a camp in Pasadena, California for children affected by HIV and AIDS. He was also a keen participant in Movember each year.  Scientific career  Purton earned an undergraduate degree in Genetics from Monash University in 1998 and Doctor of Philosophy in Immunology from Monash University in 2002. He was commended for the 2002 Victorian Premier's Awards for Medical ResearchPast Premier's Award for Medical Research Winners and won the Mollie Holman Medal for Excellence in a PhD Thesis on graduation.Mollie Holman medals awarded Purton published three first-author papers from his thesis entitled, \\"The influence of glucocorticoids and other factors in T-cell development and selection\\". His major publication appeared in the prominent journal, Immunity. After being awarded a prestigious National Health and Medical Research Council CJ Martin Fellowship,Early Career Fellowships Purton travelled to San Diego in 2003 to commence his postdoctoral studies at The Scripps Research Institute. During his time working with T cells and vaccines at Scripps,Miltenyi \\"MicroBead\\" Artifacts Detected in T cells after 72 hours of Incubation Purton published another three first-author papers as a postdoctoral fellow.  Death  In December 2009, Purton was struck from behind while in his car by a speeding drunk driver. Purton was killed instantly. In December 2009, a memorial service for Purton was held at La Jolla Shores where over 300 people attended.DUI Victim Was Trying to Find Cure for Cancer A second memorial service was later held in his home town of Melbourne where over 500 people attended the Salvation Army Hall in Camberwell, Victoria. Many people wore green to the memorial service, which was Purton's favourite colour.  Legacy  Since his death, the Jared F. Purton Foundation was set up in Purton's memory to promote local volunteerism and create positive changes in the San Diego community. Since 2010, a 5K Charity Run/Walk around Mission Beach, San Diego has been held every October. The Scripps Research postdoctoral group Society of Fellows also created the Jared Purton Award \\"in loving memory of our esteemed colleague\\". The prize is awarded annually as part of the group's research symposium to individuals who excel in the field of immunology.

Until 1884 her regular run was between Liverpool and Quebec. On 23 November 1885, near Matane, she collided with the which sank as a result. On 30 June 1886, she ran aground on the Antrim coast, but was refloated, sold, and renamed Lismore. On 8 June 1888 she was wrecked at Porto Plata in the Dominican Republic. This iron screw-steamer was the first of the Beaver Line steamships and was set to sail between Liverpool, Quebec, and Montreal when navigation of the Saint Lawrence River was ice-free. In the winter she would run between Liverpool and any American port. Lake Champlains hull and 250-horsepower engines were constructed by the London and Glasgow Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding Company at Govan. Owned by the Canada Shipping Company of Montreal and Liverpool, she was registered in Montreal, the first Clyde-built steamer under the Dominion flag. Measuring 321 ft. with a 35 ft. beam and 26 ft. deep hold, she was rated at 2207 tons gross. She had three decks, the upper deck being a spar deck and the others designed for carrying passengers. Barque-rigged, and equipped with steam steering-gear, steam windlass for raising anchors and four steam winches, she was a state-of-the-art ship. Her design was intended to withstand the worst weather of the Atlantic, and her hull had been specially strengthened for any contact with ice.

It is native to North America, where it is found across Canada from British Columbia to Manitoba and south to Colorado in the United States. This plant is a perennial grass growing a single stem, not forming a tuft or clump. It grows up to 60 centimeters tall. It has a network of thin rhizomes and roots that hold the soil, forming sod. The roots have been observed to penetrate over a meter deep in the soil. The stiff, rolled leaves are mostly located around the base of the stem and reach up to 15 centimeters long by just a few millimeters wide. The inflorescence is a narrow panicle up to 10 centimeters long. The spikelet contains one flower. The plant reproduces vegetatively by sprouting from its rhizome and sexually by its wind-dispersed seed. This grass occurs in a number of habitat types, including temperate coniferous forest, sagebrush, shrubsteppe, and several types of prairie and grassland. It is a dominant grass species in several regions in the Great Basin and Great Plains. It tolerates cold winters and hot summers. It is common in disturbed habitat. It grows in all stages of ecological succession and is a climax species in some regions, such as the Canadian mixed-grass prairie and the mountains and foothills of Montana. This is the only Calamagrostis that provides forage for grazing livestock on the northern Great Plains. It is consumed by cattle and horses, and less often by sheep. It is not a favorite forage plant for livestock because its leaves are coarse in texture.

Biography In the mid-1960s whilst at school, Testi began promoting shows in venues as diverse as scout huts, youth clubs, schools, pubs and civic halls. In the summer of 1969, with a band formed at school, he went to London where he met Freddie Bulsara. A few weeks later Bulsara appeared on stage for the first time, fronting the band Testi had taken to London. Bulsara changed the band’s name from Ibex to Wreckage and later changed his own name to Freddie Mercury.Gunn, Jacky & Jenkins, Jim (1992). Queen: As It Began. Sidgwick & Jackson Ltd. During 1970, as a college social secretary, Testi continued to follow Mercury’s progress with Roger Taylor and Brian May in the newly formed Queen and arranged three shows for the band; at a youth club in Potters Bar, at St Helens College of Technology and at Liverpool’s Cavern Club. Testi returned to London and spent 1971 encouraging Queen and generating interest from record companies. In mid-1972 Testi returned to Merseyside, working with local musicians until 1974 when he met members of a band from Liverpool College of Art who had taken their name from the building where they rehearsed – Deaf School. Deaf School became the spark that ignited a creative, musical explosion in Liverpool which had seen scant original musical output since The Beatles. During two years of tour management with Deaf School, Testi formed an alliance with Roger Eagle. The two first met in the 1960s at the Magic Village in Manchester. Together they established Eric's Club in Mathew Street, Liverpool in 1976. The first band to play was Deaf School, followed by many of the leading acts of the day: The Stranglers, The Runaways, The Sex Pistols, The Damned, Elvis Costello, The Police, Ian Dury and the Blockheads, Nick Lowe, Dave Edmunds, The Clash, The Ramones and Talking Heads, amongst others. Before it closed in March 1980, many new local acts had been encouraged to take to the stage for the first time including Jayne Casey, Bill Drummond, Ian Broudie and Holly Johnson (Big in Japan), Paul Rutherford and Budgie (The Spitfire Boys) and Pete Wylie. In the 1980s, the UK and international record charts were dominated by talent that had emerged from Eric’s including, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, KLF, The Lightning Seeds, The Teardrop Explodes, Echo & the Bunnymen and Dead or Alive. In 1988 Testi persuaded Deaf School to reform for a series of shows, from which Clive Langer produced a live album, 2nd Coming: Liverpool '88. In 2008 Testi produced an Eric’s Show at Liverpool Academy featuring acts from the club. In the same year Liverpool’s Everyman Theatre produced “Eric’s, The Musical”. Testi currently runs a company called Eric's Productions Limited, where he produces a number of shows each year for Deaf School, and their celebrity guests who regularly include Suggs and Lee Thompson (Madness), Kevin Rowland (Dexys Midnight Runners) and Ian Broudie (Lightning Seeds).

He has written numerous articles on the subject and is probably best known for his extensive collection of original memorabilia including his collection of large-format images signed by most of the Apollo astronauts. For a while he acted as an advisor to the London Science Museum Space Department regarding the Apollo 10 Command Service Module better known as Charlie Brown, currently on and has written various articles on the subject of space travel and space art, particularly that of Apollo 12 moonwalker, Alan Bean. The London exhibitions of his large-format Apollo mission images captured the interest of many new devotees of the Apollo programme, and a large collection of his work is currently on display at the Kansas Cosmosphere, Hutchinson, Kansas.cosmo.org Biography Cantwell was born in Sutton, Surrey, England, and after leaving school at an early age, drifted into the IT sales industry, setting up his own company in 1982. Nowadays his company and various interests occupy his time but allow him opportunities to travel to America to attend events and meetings with the Apollo astronauts. Photo collection The Leslie Cantwell Collection is considered by space industry experts to be the largest and most important of its kind in the world, and celebrates the golden age of space travel. The collection is a montage of autographs and official NASA photographs including images of all six voyages that Man made to the moon. Some of the images are original Hasselblad photographs (the official camera of choice used on all missions) and many of the photographs were taken in space by the astronauts themselves; others were taken by their NASA colleagues on the ground. Walter Cunningham, Lunar Module Pilot of Apollo 7, has said of the photographs, “These are rare and unique pictures from a unique time in the history of the world.” The photographs themselves are an awe- inspiring reminder of the magnitude of the achievement of the US space program in the 1960s and 1970s of actually putting a man on the moon, but what makes the collection so unique is that each bears a handwritten inscription by the very astronauts who made history which, in Cantwell's words, give the images “the personal touch of a moonwalker who fulfilled the dream of man over millennia, writing in his own hand a segment of mission transcripts, poetry, or his own comments”. The combination of imagery and poetry takes the photographs beyond visual art and captures the glory of one of the most milestones in the history of Man. The collection originates from a single photograph given to Leslie Cantwell by the Apollo 15 moonwalker, James Irwin, in Hanover, Germany, in 1981. Irwin was there to promote his book, and offered to sign a picture for Cantwell, which he inscribed with the words, “with love from the moon.” When Cantwell returned home the photograph was consigned to the attic to gather dust. Cantwell is an avid reader of renaissance literature and poetry, especially Dante's ‘La Divina Commedia’. When, by chance, he rediscovered Irwin's photograph amongst his possessions ten years later, he happened to be reading ‘Paradiso’ (Part 1 of La Divina Commedia) and, contemplating the photograph, he was struck by the fact that many of the lines relating to the poet's ascent into heaven could be applied to the astronauts’ forays into space. For example, “I’ve been in the heavens … and I’ve seen things which cannot be told by anyone who’s not been up there.” Dante refers to himself as ‘the vessel of Apollo’ (lines which Gene Cernan, Apollo 17 Commander, later inscribed on a photograph of the Apollo 17 command module). Similarly, lines from Kipling's ‘The Secret of the Machines’the-secret-of-the- machines also evoked the paradox of the audacity of the missions and their very precariousness: “But remember, please, the Law by which we live, We are not built to comprehend a lie, We can neither love nor pity nor forgive, If you make a slip in handling us, you die!”. He is quoted as saying he imagined a Saturn V rocket on the launch pad. “All the noise, the arc lights, the technology, and Man’s audacious venture in relation to this image” For Cantwell, it was the touch paper for a passion that would lead him to amass an enormous number of photographs, from which he painstakingly selected images that, appropriately inscribed, he felt would portray not only the magnitude of the US space program but also the absolute transcendence of the astronauts’ experience of actually looking down from space. He always thought their heroism and sheer daring is awe-inspiring. He says, “The early astronauts were the greatest explorers ever. They left the planet and went up into the Dark Unknown, knowing that in all likelihood they might not return.” As the collection grew, Cantwell sent the images to Venice to be enlarged to a 16” X 20” format (the usual NASA format is 8” x 10”). He says, “Some of that imagery is simply breathtaking and an 8x10 would do it no justice. I also needed ‘room to work’, and the placement of the inscription, the colour of the pen and other details were all relative to the quality of the finished article. Furthermore, the actual signature, following the inscription formed the fusion required to bring the image to life thus making it more meaningful to the viewer.” Cantwell made countless trips back and forth across the Atlantic, travelling extensively throughout the United States to meet and converse with the Apollo astronauts, with many of whom he developed a special rapport that would enable him to understand the “men behind the mission”. Amazingly, he was able to persuade all but one of the twelve men who set foot on the moon to inscribe the images, including Buzz Aldrin, Alan Bean, Gene Cernan, Charlie Duke and Harrison Schmitt, amongst others. Only Neil Armstrong refused (for years he has turned down Cantwell's requests. The fact that he was able to persuade the likes of Buzz Aldrin and John Young to write such lengthy personal inscriptions when they rarely so much as sign an autograph, is an exceptional feat. As well as containing passages chosen by Cantwell from Dante and Kipling, some of the images bear inscriptions which capture amusing exchanges that occurred during the voyages; others describe some of the more chilling moments which gripped the world. Images from the Apollo 13 are one such example. Apollo 13 Whilst studying the logo of the Apollo 13 mission Cantwell had an idea which resulted in a unique photographic project. Apollo 13 was the 7th manned mission in the Apollo program and was intended to be the third such mission to the moon. However, it is probably best remembered as the first in the Apollo program to require an emergency abort. The moon landing was abandoned after an oxygen tank exploded en route to the moon, approximately 200,000 miles from Earth, which crippled the service module necessitating emergency makeshift repairs to the lithium containers so that carbon dioxide could be eliminated to ensure adequate oxygen in the module, and also resulted in limited power, loss of cabin heat, shortage of drinking water and before it was possible to return the crew safely to Earth. Jim Lovell, the Apollo 13 commander, later called the mission, “a successful failure”. The Apollo 13 mission logo depicted three horses as Apollo's chariot flying into the void of lunar space as well as the motto “Ex luna, scientia” (“From the moon, knowledge”). For Cantwell the logo perfectly encompassed the hope and fearlessness of the astronauts and was struck by the paradox between anticipation and reality, given that the final outcome was so poignantly in contrast to the expectations. He had the logo printed onto a large-format, high-resolution picture which he then had inscribed with actual mission and mission control quotations by those involved, both at Mission Control and aboard the space module. The mission commander, Jim Lovell, wrote his now- famous quote: “Houston, we have a problem.” Cantwell also produced a large- format image of the lithium dioxide container which the crew had had to repair using materials to hand on board. He tracked down Joseph P. Kerwin, the CapCom controller on-duty at the time of the emergency who had conveyed the repair instructions to the crew, who agreed to write the actual instructions he had conveyed to the crew. The Apollo 13 images give a unique perspective of a moment when the world held its breath at history was made. Other photographs Other images in the collection are no less haunting or poignant: an image of an Apollo 11 earth orbit is brought to life by a 35-word inscription by Buzz Aldrin of the ‘silent communion’ prayer he uttered shortly after landing on the moon, or Al Worden's inscription on an image from the Apollo 15 archives of his poem “Blast Off” (from his book, Hello Earth, Greetings from Endeavour) - he wrote the words in the shape of a rocket on a launch pad. The collection has been on exhibition at The Proud Galleries in London which received much media coverage (including a podcast with Alan Bean) and at the Cosmosphere in Kansas, which also was attended by astronauts such as Jim Lovell and Fred Haise.

By applying comparative genomics, the genomes of multiple species are compared in order to identify genetic and phenotypical differences between species. Observed phenotypical characteristics related to the neurological function include behavior, personality, neuroanatomy, and neuropathology. The theory behind cognitive genomics is based on elements of genetics, evolutionary biology, molecular biology, cognitive psychology, behavioral psychology, and neurophysiology. Intelligence is the most extensively studied behavioral trait. In humans, approximately 70% of all genes are expressed in the brain. Genetic variation accounts for 40% of phenotypical variation. Approaches in cognitive genomics have been used to investigate the genetic causes for many mental and neurodegenerative disorders including Down syndrome, major depressive disorder, autism, and Alzheimer's disease.  Cognitive genomics testing   Approaches  = Evo-geno = The most commonly used approach to genome-investigation is evolutionary genomics biology, or evo-geno, in which the genomes of two species which share a common ancestor are compared. A common example of evo-geno is comparative cognitive genomics testing between humans and chimpanzees which shared an ancestor 6-7 million years ago. Patterns in local gene expression and gene splicing are examined to determine genomic differentiation. Comparative transcriptomic analyses conducted on primate brains to measure gene expression levels have shown significant differences between human and chimpanzee genomes. The evo- geno approach was also used to verify the theory that humans and non-human primates share similar expression levels in energy metabolism-related genes which have implications for aging and neurodegenerative disease. = Evo-devo = Evolutionary development biology (evo-devo) approach compares cognitive and neuroanatomic development patterns between sets of species. Studies of human fetus brains reveal that almost a third of expressed genes are regionally differentiated, far more than non-human species. This finding could potentially explain variations in cognitive development between individuals. Neuroanatomical evo-devo studies have connected higher brain order to brain lateralization which, though present in other species, is highly ordered in humans. = Evo-pheno and evo-patho = Evolutionary phenotype biology (evo- pheno) approach examines phenotype expression between species. Evolutionary pathology biology (evo-patho) approach investigates disease prevalence between species.  Imaging genomics  = Candidate gene selection = In genomics, a gene being imaged and analyzed is referred to as a candidate gene. The ideal candidate genes for comparative genomic testing are genes that harbor well-defined functional polymorphisms with known effects on neuroanatomical and/or cognitive function. However, genes with either identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms or allele variations with potential functional implications on neuroanatomical systems suffice. The weaker the connection between the gene and the phenotype, the more difficult it is to establish causality through testing. = Controlling for non-genetic factors = Non-genetic factors such as age, illness, injury, or substance abuse can have significant effects on gene expression and phenotypic variance. The identification and contribution of genetic variation to specific phenotypes can only be performed when other potential contributing factors can be matched across genotype groups. In the case of neuroimaging during task performance such as in fMRI, groups are matched by performance level. Non-genetic factors have a particularly large potential effect on cognitive development. In the case of autism, non-genetic factors account for 62% of disease risk. = Task selection = In order to study the connection between a candidate gene and a proposed phenotype, a subject is often given a task to perform that elicits the behavioral phenotype while undergoing some form of neuroimaging. Many behavioral tasks used for genomic studies are modified versions of classic behavioral and neuropsychological tests designed to investigate neural systems critical to particular behaviors.  Species used in comparative cognitive genomics   Humans  In 2003, the Human Genome Project produced the first complete human genome. Despite the project’s success, very little is known about cognitive gene expression.Interview with Todd Preuss, PhD, Yerkes National Primate Research Center Prior to 2003, any evidence concerning human brain connectivity was based on post-mortem observations. Due to ethical concerns, no invasive in vivo genomics studies have been performed on live humans.  Non-human primates  As the closest genetic relatives to humans, non-human primates are the most preferable genomics imaging subjects. In most cases, primates are imaged while under anesthesia. Due to the high cost of raising and maintaining primate populations, genomic testing on non-human primates is typically performed at primate research facilities. = Chimpanzees = Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) are the closest genetic relatives to human, sharing 93.6% genetic similarity. It is believed that humans and chimpanzees shared a common genetic ancestor around 7 million years ago. The movement to sequence the chimpanzee genome began in 1998 and was given high priority by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). Currently, human and chimpanzees have the only sequenced genomes in the extended family of primates. Some comparisons of autosomal intergenic non-repetitive DNA segments suggest as little as 1.24% genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees along certain sections. Despite the genetic similarity, 80% of proteins between the two species are different which understates the clear phenotypical differences. = Rhesus macaques = Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) exhibit a 93% genetic similarity to humans approximately. They are often used as an out-group in human/chimpanzee genomic studies. Humans and rhesus macaques shared a common ancestor an estimated 25 million years ago. = Apes = Orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus) and gorillas (Gorilla gorilla) have been used in genomics testing but are not common subjects due to cost.  Neurobehavioral and cognitive disorders  Despite what is sometimes reported, most behavioral or pathological phenotypes are not due to a single gene mutation but rather a complex genetic basis. However, there are some exceptions to this rule such as Huntington's disease which is caused by a single specific genetic disorder. The occurrence of neurobehavioral disorders is influenced by a number of factors, genetic and non-genetic.  Down syndrome  Down syndrome is a genetic syndrome marked by intellectual disability and distinct cranio-facial features and occurs in approximately 1 in 800 live births. Experts believe the genetic cause for the syndrome is a lack of genes in the 21st chromosome. However, the gene or genes responsible for the cognitive phenotype have yet to be discovered.  Fragile-X syndrome  Fragile-X syndrome is caused by a mutation of the FRAXA gene located in the X chromosome. The syndrome is marked by intellectual disability (moderate in males, mild in females), language deficiency, and some autistic spectrum behaviors.  Alzheimer’s disease  Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes age-correlated progressive cognitive decline. animal model using mice have investigated the pathophysiology and suggest possible treatments such as immunization with amyloid beta and peripheral administration of antibodies against amyloid beta. Studies have linked Alzheimer’s with gene alterations causing SAMP8 protein abnormalities.  Autism  Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder characterized by abnormal social development, inability to empathize and effectively communicate, and restricted patterns of interest. A possible neuroanatomical cause is the presence of tubers in the temporal lobe. As mentioned previously, non-genetic factors account for 62% of autism development risk. Autism is a human-specific disorder. As such, the genetic cause has been implicated to highly ordered brain lateralization exhibited by humans. Two genes have been linked to autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD): c3orf58 (a.k.a. Deleted In Autism-1 or DIA1) and cXorf36 (a.k.a.Deleted in Autism-1 Related or DIA1R).  Major depressive disorder  Major depressive disorder is a common mood disorder believed to be caused by irregular neural uptake of serotonin. While the genetic cause is unknown, genomic studies of post-mortem MDD brains have discovered abnormalities in the fibroblast growth factor system which supports the theory of growth factors playing an important role in mood disorders.  Others  Other neurodegenerative disorders include Rett syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and Williams-Beuren syndrome.

Otis (born July 27, 1946) is a law professor and former federal prosecutor who served as Special Counsel to President George H. W. Bush. Education and legal career A graduate of the University of North Carolina (1968) and Stanford Law School (1974), Otis is currently an adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center. He also contributes to the legal blog Crime and Consequences. In 2007, Otis wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post urging President George W. Bush to commute the prison sentence imposed on Scooter Libby, who had been sentenced to 30 months in prison, a $250,000 fine, and two years of probation for his role in the aftermath of the Valerie Plame affair. Approximately one month after Otis's piece appeared, Bush commuted Libby's prison sentence, while leaving the rest of the sentence intact. Otis spent much of his career as head of the Appellate Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. For ten years, he was a member of the Attorney General's Advisory Subcommittee on the Sentencing Guidelines. In 1992, during the investigation into \\"Iraqgate,\\" he served as Special Counsel for President George H. W. Bush. He returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office the next year, and ended his tenure there in 1999. He returned to federal service three years later as Special Assistant to the Secretary of Energy. In 2003, he was appointed Counselor to the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, where he remained until 2007. Otis has appeared before both houses of the United States Congress as an expert witness on diverse subjects in criminal law including the death penalty, illegal drugs, and the United States Sentencing Commission. He has been interviewed on these and other subjects by The New York Times, The Atlantic magazine, CBS's 60 Minutes, The O'Reilly Factor, ABC News, and MSNBC. He has written op-ed pieces for various newspapers on topics including legal ethics, Miranda warnings, and the firing of U.S. Attorneys by then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.  U.S. Sentencing Commission nomination  On March 1, 2018, President Donald Trump nominated Otis to the United States Sentencing Commission. Otis' nomination was criticized by several advocacy groups for his support of existing mandatory sentencing laws, and his views on demographics and crime. In an earlier blog post, Otis had defended a speech given by Fifth Circuit Judge Edith Jones to an audience at the University of Pennsylvania Law School, observing that in the U.S., minorities commit more violence than whites. Otis contended that Jones' speech had been challenged as offensive but not as untrue. He stated that \\"race and criminality have no causative relationship,\\" and that the disproportionate commission of violent crime by blacks was a product of a breakdown in family structure, not an inherent characteristic, as the Washington Post had included in a headline it altered hours after being published. He supported his argument by pointing to the fact that persons of Asian descent (whom he described as \\"Orientals\\") have lower crime rates than whites, even though Asians had been subjected to discrimination whites did not face. He said the lower crime rates of Asian- Americans, as opposed to white or black Americans, resulted from intact, two- parent families that honor \\"work, education and tradition...values, not race or skin color, influence choices.\\" Otis’ nomination lapsed without action by the Senate. Personal life A survivor of liver cancer thanks to a liver transplant, Otis is married to Lee Liberman Otis, a co-founder and officer of the Federalist Society.

A k-homogeneous graph obeys a weakened version of the same property in which every isomorphism between two induced subgraphs implies the existence of an automorphism of the whole graph that maps one subgraph to the other (but does not necessarily extend the given isomorphism). A homogeneous graph is a graph that is k-homogeneous for every k, or equivalently k-ultrahomogeneous for every k. Classification The only finite homogeneous graphs are the cluster graphs mKn formed from the disjoint unions of isomorphic complete graphs, the Turán graphs formed as the complement graphs of mKn, the 3 × 3 rook's graph, and the 5-cycle. The only countably infinite homogeneous graphs are the disjoint unions of isomorphic complete graphs (with the size of each complete graph, the number of complete graphs, or both numbers countably infinite), their complement graphs, the Henson graphs together with their complement graphs, and the Rado graph. If a graph is 5-ultrahomogeneous, then it is ultrahomogeneous for every k. There are only two connected graphs that are 4-ultrahomogeneous but not 5-ultrahomogeneous: the Schläfli graph and its complement. The proof relies on the classification of finite simple groups.; ; .

Barrett, then a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow. It was first published in 1994 by the Oxford-based company Blackwell as a part of their ‘Social Archaeology’ series, edited by the archaeologist Ian Hodder of the University of Cambridge. An adherent of the post-processual school of thought in archaeological theory, in Fragments from Antiquity, Barrett eschews the 'grand narrative' approach which he associates with processualism, instead focusing in on the much smaller period of time between 2900 and 1200 BCE. Although many of Barrett’s interpretations of the evidence remained controversial, Fragments from Antiquity has remained an influential text amongst archaeologists studying British prehistory. Background Post-processualism John C. Barrett Barrett had contributed a section on Early Bronze Age hoards and metalwork to the 1985 book Symbols of Power: At the Time of Stonehenge, a work written by D.V. Clarke, T.G. Cowie and Andrew Foxon which had been published by the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland. Synopsis In the book's introduction, Barrett criticises the trend amongst processual archaeologists to focus on the generalisation of past societies into a series of processes, instead arguing that archaeologists should instead think about the individuals of the past, who are otherwise forgotten. He therefore accepts the role that post-processual theory plays in the book, but argues that \\"this is not a book about archaeological theory\\", instead being \\"an empirical study aimed at building a history of the period between about 2900 and 1200 BC in southern Britain\\" a timespan that he considers to be \\"one of the most remarkable periods in European prehistory\\".Barrett 1994. pp. 1-7.

Co-written by the archaeologists D.V. Clarke, T.G. Cowie and Andrew Foxon, it also contained additional contributions from other authors including John C. Barrett and Joan Taylor. Published by the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland in 1985, it was designed to accompany an exhibition on the same subject that was held that year in Edinburgh, Scotland. Focusing in on the use of theme of how power, prestige and status were manifested in the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Ages, it looks primarily at \\"the ideology of domination\\", in doing so adopting a quasi-Marxist approach. The book proceeds from a discussion of how hierarchical symbols are found in society to looking at the role of ancestor veneration in Early Neolithic Britain through the construction of chambered tombs. It then continues to look at the changes which accompanied the transition to Late Neolithic society, with an end to ancestor veneration and the construction of new forms of ritual monument, like henges and stone circles. Moving on, it looks at the arrival of Beaker pottery and metallurgy in the British Isles, arguing that this brought with it a new social elite who became dominant during the ensuing Early Bronze Age. Various academic reviews were produced of the book and published in specialist journals Background Symbols of Power was designed to accompany an exhibition which was held in Edinburgh in 1985, although the authors noted that the book was \\"nevertheless designed as an independent unit\\" that could stand-alone from the exhibit.Clarke, Cowie and Foxon 1985. p. 1. Synopsis In their introduction, the authors discuss the state of prehistoric archaeology in Britain, noting that at the time most of the populace still considered prehistoric people to be little more than \\"squat, grunting savages\\" and that whilst terms used for Iron Age peoples like \\"Celts\\" and \\"Picts\\" evoked an emotional response from contemporary Britons, the terms used by archaeologists for other, earlier prehistoric groups, such as \\"Windmill Hill culture\\" or the \\"Grooved Ware Sub-Culture\\", failed to do so. Proceeding to argue that the communities of prehistory were far from the \\"savage and primitive\\" people presented in the popular imagination, it then lays out its intentions in presenting a more accurate picture of prehistoric folk.Clarke, Cowie and Foxon 1985. p. 2. Claiming that the book's theme is to look at \\"the manifestation of power, prestige and status in the third and second millennia bc\\", it notes that in doing so it will be looking primarily at the \\"ideology of domination\\", and that it will therefore take influence from the work of German sociologist Karl Marx, the founder of Marxist theory, although noted that at the same time it did not take \\"a doctrinal approach\\" in adopting any particular theoretical position, whether Marxist or otherwise.Clarke, Cowie and Foxon 1985. p. 3. The authors then describe how symbols in contemporary British culture are used to display status and power, discussing a variety of examples from politicians to traffic wardens, in order that the reader better understands the role which symbolism has in displaying hierarchy.Clarke, Cowie and Foxon 1985. pp. 3-13. The second chapter, entitled 'The Use of the Ancestors', discusses the Early Neolithic in Britain, as farming arrived to supplant the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had previously dominated British society. It then goes on to look at the great reverence held for ancestors in Early Neolithic society, with the construction of chambered tombs for the dead, in doing so discussing examples such as West Kennet Long Barrow in Wiltshire and Maeshowe in Orkney.Clarke, Cowie and Foxon 1985. pp. 15-34. Chapter three, 'From Ancestors to Gods', looks at the Late Neolithic transition from a society dominated by tombs and ancestors to one that instead focused on the construction of causewayed enclosures, henges, cursus monuments and stone circles. In that chapter, the authors also examine decorative art from the period, for instance examining the curvilinear designs that are found on the tombs at Newgrange and Gavrinis, before then looking at the monument at Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric site in Britain.Clarke, Cowie and Foxon 1985. pp. 35-80. The fourth chapter, entitled 'The Acknowledgement of Individual Power', looks at the arrival of Beaker pottery and its associated cultural traits, including metal, into the British Isles, arguing that the rise of blacksmiths and those who had the knowledge to develop metal tools soon supplanted the existing social elite.

She has been giving solo performances since 1990 and has performed in several major sabhas / organizations such as Sri Shanmukhananda Sabha in Mumbai (1995) and New Delhi (2016), Ministry of Culture (India), Mulund Fine Arts Society, twice in NCPA in Little theatre and Godrej Dance Academy, four in ISKCON – monthly festival and Janmashtami Festival, Mulund Fine Arts Society, Cultural Festivals organized by Governments of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, ‘Vividha Kala Mahotsav’ organized by Department of Cultural Affairs, Govt of Maharashtra, ‘Pongal festival’ organized by Govt of Tamil Nadu at Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, and Centaur Hotel, festival under the aegis of Department of Tourism, Govt of Andhra Pradesh at Shilparamam, Regional conference of ICSI, SICA at Ravindra Bharathi, Hyderabad, dance festival of Kalasagaram, Secunderabad and Bombay Andhra Maha Sabha, Mumbai. In the year 2014, Subhashni completed 25 years as a dance exponent. She performed at the Potti Sreeramulu Telugu University to mark this occasion. She also has set up a BharataNatyam Academy by the name - \\"Suguna Nrityalaya\\" in the memory of her late sister Smt Suguna, who mentored her to pursue BharataNatyam in the first place. The money from this Academy would be forming the corpus of a Trust. The Trust money would be for imparting education to the underprivileged.  Academic career  She is a post graduate in commerce from R.A.Podar College of Commerce, and also a Chartered Accountant. She became a FCA – fellow member of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India from 2003. In 2004, she acquired a post qualification degree DISA – Diploma in Information and Systems Audit from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. She has been conferred the title of ‘SHRINGAR MANI’ and adjudged as best dancer all over India, by SUR SINGAR SAMSAD. She has been pursuing her academic career with equal dedication and is a practising Chartered Accountant in Mumbai.  Choreographies  Subhashni has choreographed many of her Dance Recitals * She choreographed special dance theme \\"Shri Krishna Kaarunya\\" and performed it at Sri Janmashtami Festival at ISKCON, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai and \\"Shri Krishna Vaibhav\\" performed at ISKCON, Juhu, Mumbai. * Her recent concept which she gave shape to was ‘Navarasas in the life of a student till he / she becomes a Professional / CA’. The concept, choreography and the performance was appreciated by the audience. \\"First time in the history of Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, CA motto and history of CA emblem was shown by me in Abhinaya and Mudras with English subtitles, on CA Foundation day on 1 July 2011.\\"  Philosophy  The reason God made her to pursue her career and her passion (Bharathanatyam), both with the same zeal and enthusiasm was because God had chosen CA to fulfill the financial needs and Dance for her inner Bliss, she says. The Supreme satisfaction of the inner self while performing dance is unexplainable. The main reason that She has never made Dance a source of income after being a performer for more than two decades is that, she has always considered Bharathnatyam Dance as eternal and spiritual. When one could get so much of immense self-satisfaction and pure happiness then what else one could ask for from Dance? Materialistic thing like money? She has dedicated herself to Bharathanatyam. She believes in continuing her art all through her life and train as many dancers as possible who will carry on this legacy in to the future generations, without making it a commercial proposition. She says \\"If Every dance Performance of mine can motivate at least one person to pursue this rich Indian art of Bharata Natyam that would be my humble contribution to the field of art.\\"  References  *Official Website *The Hindu Friday Review *The Hindu Friday Review *The Hindu Friday Review *The Hindu Friday Review *The Hindu Friday Review *Times Of India Article *Times Of India Article *Times Of India Article *Times Of India Article *Article in Hindustan Times *Westside Plus, Times Of India Article *Article in Mumbai Mirror *The Hindu Friday Review *Review in Hans India *Review in Hans India *Review in Hans India *Review in Telangana Today Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Bharatanatyam exponents Category:Indian female classical dancers Category:Performers of Indian classical dance Category:Dancers from Tamil Nadu Category:Artists from Chennai Category:Women artists from Tamil Nadu Category:20th-century Indian dancers Category:20th-century Indian women artists ","title":"Subhashni Giridhar"},{"id":"34035416","text":"Christy Byrne (born 1971 in County Kildare, Ireland) is a former Irish sportsperson.

The series was written by Loe de Jong (1914-2005), director of the Dutch Institute for War Documentation (Nederlands Instituut voor Oorlogsdocumentatie, or NIOD), and was published between 1969 and 1991. The series contains 14 volumes, published in 29 parts. De Jong was commissioned to write the work in 1955 by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. The first volume appeared in 1969, and de Jong wrote his last (volume 13) in 1988. The final volume, containing critique and responses, appeared in 1991. Publication history Loe de Jong was commissioned to write The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II by the Ministry of Education and Sciences, the predecessor of the current Ministry of Education, Culture and Science. The series was to be completed in 15 years and comprise six or seven volumes, but it took de Jong until 1969 to publish the first volume. Originally the government intended for the series to be edited by four professors of the four main Dutch politico- denominational pillars, who quickly realized that they would be unable to fulfill the task in addition to their regular obligations. Instead, the assignment was given to de Jong, then a young historian who had already argued for such a reference work in 1948 and became the first director of the NIOD. De Jong himself wrote the first thirteen volumes, the last of which was published in 1988. In 1987, the Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sciences, in response to criticism, asked the NIOD to appoint an investigative committee to evaluate de Jong's thirteen volumes and write a fourteenth, which was to include the opinions of other historians. This committee, made up of Jan Bank, , A. F. Manning, E. H. Kossmann, A. H. Paape, and , published the fourteenth and final volume in 1991, with Jan Bank, professor of Dutch history at Leiden University, and , department head at NIOD and professor of history at the University of Amsterdam, as general editors. An electronic edition of the 18,000 pages was made available for downloading on 11 December 2011; the following Monday, 12 December, NIOD's website crashed as a result of too many downloads. Influence and criticism De Jong's work gained much popular currency when parts of it were televised in a documentary television series from the 1960s, De Bezetting (\\"The Occupation\\"), directed by Milo Anstadt. It established de Jong as a figure of national importance and a media personality. He was later chastised for being overly concerned with his own image and reputation, a critique extended to his historical work—for instance, his cursory investigation in 1965 of the activities during World War II of Claus von Amsberg, then fiancé of crown princess Beatrix, was deemed insufficient and too positive (as opposed to his investigation in 1977 of politician Wim Aantjes, in which he too easily reached a negative conclusion, according to critics). De Jong's work is regarded as the most important Dutch publication on World War II, and in the series he uncovered hitherto unpublicized events from the war, such as the death by firing squad of Dutch deserter , executed for desertion on 12 May 1940 after a quick court- martial—he was the only Dutch soldier to be executed by the Dutch in the twentieth century. De Jong's work supported and contributed to a vision of the Dutch during the war that has come increasingly under fire. The general idea presented in The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II is that the Dutch fought bravely against the German occupier, and that after they were defeated they continued to resist the occupation, with only a minority collaborating with them for instance by joining the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (Dutch NSB). Moreover, most Dutch people helped their Jewish fellow citizens in hiding. This myth dominated the view the Dutch had of themselves, supported in great measure by de Jong, until historians began publishing more critical studies. These pointed out that, comparatively speaking, a larger percentage of Jews was deported than in surrounding countries, that the Dutch economy at least until 1942 fared well under the German occupation, and that as late as 1944 the economy was growing due in part to Dutch companies actively trading with the Wehrmacht. In recent years, however, his influence has waned, and his treatment of various topics has come under criticism. With each volume's publication, national discussion on the war and the way de Jong described it started anew, ever increasingly, until even members of the investigative committee publicly vented their unease with de Jong, his writing, and his media presence. In a 1981 article published in Het Parool, P.W. Klein, then a historian at Erasmus University Rotterdam, severely criticized de Jong's work: > His moralizing stance, his tone so full of pathos, the unverifiability of > his statements, his chronicling approach, the lack of thematic analysis of > structures and processes, his blindness toward the functioning of impersonal > societal forces, his uneven treatment of the material—directed more by what > happens to be known than by problem-oriented investigation—his verbosity, > the lack of documentation, the ease with which he accepts sources as correct > or incorrect, his limitless approvals and disapprovals, especially in > regards to people: it is all fodder for historical criticism. The Dutch and the Jews According to I. Vuijsje, author of Tegen beter weten in. Zelfbedrog en ontkenning in de Nederlandse geschiedschrijving over de Jodenvervolging (2006), de Jong stated incorrectly that most Dutch citizens did not know the fate of deported Jews; Vuijsje argues that the majority did know. David Barnouw of NIOD responded by saying that de Jong's assessment was more nuanced than Vuijsje made it appear, and that Vuijsje argued from the benefit of hindsight. De Jong's personal history The investigative committee was highly critical of de Jong's insertion of his own personal history in the series. He described in volume 3 how he fled the Netherlands, in volume 7 how his family fared during the war, and reflected on his family's history in volume 12.

Previously the Luba kings had built their palaces northeast of Lake Boya, but the move to Katende set a precedent for locating the capital near the Mashyo resource that was followed by Ilunga Sungu's successors. According to legend, late in the reign of Mulopwe Ilunga Sungu (c. 1770 - c. 1810) the town had become so large that the \\"Lord of Hygiene\\" could not keep the streets clear of refuse and excrement, even working all day with the help of his sons and relatives. The old king complained, blaming the Bene Kanyoka, and said they should take their dirt home with them. The Kanyok went back to their home in the west and never paid tribute to the Luba again.

History In April 1945, towards the end of World War II, Munich was occupied by the 7th US Army. Radio broadcasts for the United States armed forces were, at the time, made from the United Kingdom and France. In July 1945, transmissions began from occupied Germany too. On 10 July 1945, the AFN Munich commenced broadcasting as the first AFN station in Germany. It operated from a villa in the Kaulbachstraße that had previously belonged to Adolf Wagner, Nazi Gauleiter of the Gau München-Oberbayern. The first broadcast, made by Major Bob Light, began with the following sentence: Light's first broadcast was incorrect as the 3rd US Army had taken over control over Munich the previous night, a fact Light had missed. General George S. Patton, commander of the 3rd Army, was furious about the mistake, demanding that the responsible person be court martialed. Patton, not a friend of the American Forces Network in the first place, was shaving at the time and cut himself on hearing the broadcast. Light was surrounded by Military Police on Patton's order but managed to convince them of his innocence and returned to AFN Paris before the end of the day.AFN Europe 1943–2003 Dokumentationsarchiv Funk, accessed: 15 December 2011The American Forces Network Overseas American Forces Radio and Television Service website, accessed: 27 December 2011 The station, broadcasting with one of the strongest signals in Germany, could be received in the northern parts of the country. It enjoyed immense popularity with young Germans too, as it allowed them to listen to Jazz and Blues, outlawed during the Third Reich, and later to Rock 'n' Roll and Country music. It also helped Germans learn English in order to be able to understand the broadcasts. The station had many high-profile visitors, including Jimmy Carter, Freddie Mercury, Lou Gramm, John Glenn, Huey Lewis and The News, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Scorpions, Bruce Hornsby, Molly Hatchet, The Gap Band, and John McCain. In 1963, the station changed its frequencies, moving from 1106 to 1045 kHz on the mediumwave AM band, and from 101.2 to 102.4 MHz on the FM band. In 1973 a study was carried out that recommended closing down the station if US forces in the region were significantly reduced. In 1982 it was suggested that the station should relocate from number 15 Kaulbachstraße to number 45, into a building formerly utilised by the Bundeswehr. The cost for the alterations to the new location were covered by the Bavarian government, and AFN Munich started broadcasting from number 45 on 12 November 1984. The villa at number 15, home of the station for almost 40 years, was returned to the Bavarian government. AFN Munich stayed at its new location for a much shorter time than at the old one. The end of the Cold War and the reduction of US forces in Europe, with the closure of some of their Munich facilities, meant the end of the station. On 14 February 1992, at 3 p.m., AFN Munich hosted what was called \\"The last radio show\\", DJ'd by Army Sergeant Jef Reilly. AFN Munich ceased transmitting after playing the national anthem of the United States of America by the late Whitney Houston & The Florida Orchestra. Nothing remains of the station at either of its two former locations.

The company said that it would create 300 jobs.iYogi picks Lewiston company for customer service center The partnership ended in October, 2015, when Argo Marketing terminated the contract and filed a lawsuit against iYogi to collect about US$72,000; Argo CEO Jason Levesque said that, after taking on 30 employees, it had been paid about half of what it was owed. He said he decided to terminate the agreement \\"because of a myriad of factors\\", and that Argo was not interested in further partnerships with iYogi. Performance The service was reviewed by Michael MuchmorePC Mag: Michael Muchmore for PC Mag in April 2014 and was awarded two stars out of five. The review praised the service's low cost, polite staff, and privacy warnings, but found it performed poorly, with limited tools and cleanup, remarking that iYogi was once the value leader, but other services were now preferable in light of its lackluster performance.PC Mag: iYogi, 22 April 2014, accessed 24 April 2015 In April 2016 Hindustan Times published an article saying that the company was fast losing customers. iYogi employees were reported to have complained about not being paid for over a year and multiple months, and had said that over 2,500 of the 4,000 employees had left in consequence; iYogi said the number was smaller. iYogi CEO Challu spoke of a \\"cash flow crisis\\" and a \\"difficult time in the business cycle\\", but that the company would get over it, and that people quitting jobs is normal in the industry that has \\"50-60% attrition rate\\". Reports of misconduct, and legal action iYogi's sales tactics have been criticised. InfoWorld in 2012 published articles under the byline of Robert X. Cringely, used by several InfoWorld writers, about people who called computer support lines thinking they were getting free or under-warranty support from their suppliers, but were in fact talking to iYogi. Attempts were made to sell them subscriptions for $US170 per year, and people were told, untruthfully, that their computers had severe problems. Brian Krebs, formerly a writer for The Washington Post and later a blogger on security, called iYogi and concluded that the company was indeed trying to scare users into subscribing. After this information was first published, other people contacted the author to report similar experiences. Dave Mello, a vice-president of support and services for Kaspersky Lab, reported regular complaints from customers who had been under the impression that they were receiving authorized Kaspersky Lab support. Cringely said about iYogi \\"How it goes about selling support, however, is not unlike how the Mob markets protection: through fear and intimidation.\\" In March 2012 antivirus software company Avast! severed its ties with iYogi. Under an agreement that lasted a little more than two years, iYogi had provided online support to Avast! users free-of-cost. Avast! accused iYogi of forcefully selling its online support plans to Avast! users; which the antivirus supplier characterised as unnecessary and expensive. Avast! accused iYogi of, at best, misconduct. Reports of misleading conduct continued in 2015. Nuance Communications, on hearing that iYogi was selling technical support for their Dragon NaturallySpeaking, in April 2015 clarified that iYogi was not certified by Nuance, suggested \\"NOT USING the support site for iYogi\\", and \\"Be sure that you are using Nuance's technical support\\".Nuance Web site:Information on iYogi technical support for Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Answer ID 17521, 29 April 2015 A false advertising class-action lawsuitConsumer Class Actions site: \\"Have You Used iYogi’s Computer Support Services?

In October 2015 a federal court approved a deal including $40 payments to each of about 189,000 iYogi subscribers if they submit a claim form (a total of about $7.5m, only 8% of the available damages under the TCPA). It was reported on 16 December 2015 that Washington state, US, together with Microsoft and AARP, had filed a lawsuit alleging deceptive business practices under the state Consumer Protection Act and violations of the state Computer Spyware Statute. The state Attorney General said that hundreds if not thousands of Washington residents had been scammed by iYogi. iYogi announced, before responding formally, that the lawsuit was without merit, and that they would have clarified the issues if they had been consulted.Lawsuits Cloud iYogi Remote Tech Support Reputation, 11 January 2016 In December 2015 Infinite Computer Solutions sued iYogi for non-payment of invoices worth $6.7 million. According to a court filing of 12 May 2016, iYogi indicated that it would make a settlement offer, but was not at the time in a financial position to do so. In October 2016 a court ruled that iYogi had to pay $7.3 million to Infinite Computer Solutions. In March 2016 Tata Communications, Bankers Warranty Group, OneCall sued iYogi for breach of contract, non-payment, and other issues. iYogi filed a Notice of Appearance in the Washington State case in late March, and had 60 days from that submission to respond formally. Tata Communications was awarded $1.24m as part of a default judgment against iYogi reported on 21 September 2016. In some of the suits iYogi's attorneys resigned because the company failed to meet court deadlines. In April 2018, a Washington State court issued judgment in the iYogi lawsuit. In addition to the judgments, iYogi's United States president, Vishal Dahr, agreed to cease the company's illegal practices in Washington State, with $500,000 in suspended penalties. iYogi is now shut down completely, but before they ended operations, the company allegedly told their users that they were still in business. After this last false statement, iYogi has ceased its business operations. As of July 2020 phishing emails claiming to be from IYogi are still being sent.

OHSU named the monkey ANDi because it stands for iDNA spelled backward. Birth circumstances ANDi was born with an extra glowing gene called green fluorescent protein (GFP). This GFP gene, which is naturally occurring in jellyfish, was taken from a jellyfish and genetically added to ANDi’s DNA sequence through his chromosomes. OHSU used rhesus monkeys because they share 95% of the same genes as humans. Genetic modification method During the method in which ANDi was created, 224 eggs were injected with the protein and only 166 or 75% were successfully fertilized. 126 or 76% of these fertilized eggs developed to the four-cell-stage embryos. 40 of the fertilized embryos were implanted in 20 surrogate rhesus mothers, each carrying two embryos. 5 of the surrogates became pregnant. From these five surrogates, three live births proceeded. In these three monkey births, only one infant, ANDi, carried the transgene. Research team leader Gerald Schatten said the technique that created ANDi would become a vital tool for scientists investigating therapies for human diseases. Implications By being able to genetically modify a monkey, a new breakthrough in technology was formed. ANDi was created in the hope of finding a cure for complicated human diseases such as cancer. Since ANDi was born, scientists want to introduce more significant DNA changes. Scientists are looking to make genetic modifications such as those that would make primates closely mimic human diseases like breast cancer or HIV. Scientists also want to try to study and cure other diseases through trans genetics such as Alzheimer's, AIDS, and diabetes. Although ANDi carries the gene, it does not appear to be functional; ANDi does not actually glow.

E. Littlewood in 1925, is a theorem in operator theory and complex analysis. It states that any holomorphic univalent self-mapping of the unit disk in the complex numbers that fixes 0 induces a contractive composition operator on various function spaces of holomorphic functions on the disk. These spaces include the Hardy spaces, the Bergman spaces and Dirichlet space. Subordination theorem Let h be a holomorphic univalent mapping of the unit disk D into itself such that h(0) = 0. Then the composition operator Ch defined on holomorphic functions f on D by :C_h(f) = f\\\\circ h defines a linear operator with operator norm less than 1 on the Hardy spaces H^p(D), the Bergman spaces A^p(D). (1 ≤ p < ∞) and the Dirichlet space \\\\mathcal{D}(D). The norms on these spaces are defined by: : \\\\f\\\\_{H^p}^p = \\\\sup_r {1\\\\over 2\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(re^{i\\\\theta})^p \\\\, d\\\\theta : \\\\f\\\\_{A^p}^p = {1\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\iint_D f(z)^p\\\\, dx\\\\,dy : \\\\f\\\\_{\\\\mathcal D}^2 = {1\\\\over \\\\pi} \\\\iint_D f^\\\\prime(z)^2\\\\, dx\\\\,dy= {1\\\\over 4 \\\\pi} \\\\iint_D \\\\partial_x f^2 + \\\\partial_y f^2\\\\, dx\\\\,dy Littlewood's inequalities Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit disk D and let h be a holomorphic univalent mapping of D into itself with h(0) = 0. Then if 0 < r < 1 and 1 ≤ p < ∞ :\\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(h(re^{i\\\\theta}))^p \\\\, d\\\\theta \\\\le \\\\int_0^{2\\\\pi} f(re^{i\\\\theta})^p \\\\, d\\\\theta. This inequality also holds for 0 < p < 1, although in this case there is no operator interpretation. Proofs Case p = 2 To prove the result for H2 it suffices to show that for f a polynomial :\\\\displaystyle{\\\\C_h f\\\\^2 \\\\le \\\\f\\\\^2,} Let U be the unilateral shift defined by : \\\\displaystyle{Uf(z)= zf(z)}. This has adjoint U* given by : U^*f(z) ={f(z)-f(0)\\\\over z}. Since f(0) = a0, this gives : f= a_0 + zU^*f and hence : C_h f = a_0 + h C_hU^*f. Thus : \\\\C_h f\\\\^2 = a_0^2 + \\\\hC_hU^*f\\\\^2 \\\\le a_0^2+ \\\\C_h U^*f\\\\^2. Since U*f has degree less than f, it follows by induction that :\\\\C_h U^*f\\\\^2 \\\\le \\\\U^*f\\\\^2 = \\\\f\\\\^2 - a_0^2, and hence :\\\\C_h f\\\\^2 \\\\le \\\\f\\\\^2. The same method of proof works for A2 and \\\\mathcal D. General Hardy spaces If f is in Hardy space Hp, then it has a factorization : f(z) = f_i(z)f_o(z) with fi an inner function and fo an outer function. Then : \\\\C_h f\\\\_{H^p} \\\\le \\\\(C_hf_i) (C_h f_o)\\\\_{H^p} \\\\le \\\\C_h f_o\\\\_{H^p} \\\\le \\\\C_h f_o^{p/2}\\\\_{H^2}^{2/p} \\\\le \\\\f\\\\_{H^p}. Inequalities Taking 0 < r < 1, Littlewood's inequalities follow by applying the Hardy space inequalities to the function : f_r(z)=f(rz). The inequalities can also be deduced, following , using subharmonic functions. The inequaties in turn immediately imply the subordination theorem for general Bergman spaces.

Trimberger outlines several criteria for what she calls \\"revolution from above\\" and attempts to explicate this social phenomenon's emergence developed through a comparative historical analysis. Most of the book is dedicated to explaining the Meiji Restoration in Japan and the Turkish War of Independence. The theory is then extended to include the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and Peru's 1968 coup led by Velasco. Trimberger's contribution is significant with regard to sociological theories of the state significant insofar as it departs from the Marxist conception of the state as merely a political superstructure built on an economic base.  Synopsis   Definition of Revolution from Above  Trimberger outlines five characteristics which make a case a \\"revolution from above\\" (p. 3): # The extralegal takeover of political power and the initiation of economic, social, and political change is organized and led by some of the highest military and often civil bureaucrats in the old regime. # There is little or no mass participation in the revolutionary takeover or in the initiation of change. Mass movements and uprisings may precede and accompany revolution from above, but military bureaucrats who take revolutionary action do so independently from, and often in opposition to, such movements. # The extralegal takeover of power and initiation of change is accompanied by very little violence, execution, emigration, or counter-revolution. # The initiation of change is undertaken in a pragmatic, step-at-a-time manner with little appeal to radical ideology. Both the third and fourth characteristics are the result of control and use of a bureaucratic apparatus for radical aims. # Military bureaucrats who lead a revolution from above—as opposed to a coup d'état—destroy the economic and political base of the aristocracy or upper class. This destructive process is basic to both revolution from above and from below.  Notion of the state  Trimberger departs from the Marxian theories of the state as simply the political \\"superstructure\\" on top of the economic \\"base\\", or the more substantive theory of \\"relatively autonomy\\" as described by Nicos Poulantzas. Instead, Trimberger has a theory of the state in which the state is more autonomous, with its actors acting without regard to dominant class interests. Trimberger sees the state as \\"relatively autonomous\\" when military and civil bureaucrats are not recruited from dominant classes and when they do not form social and economic ties with these classes after their ascension to high office. These state bureaucrats become \\"dynamically autonomous\\" during periods of crisis, in which they take measures to destroy the existing economic and class order. They act independently of the existing class structures.  Criteria for emergence  Furthermore, she outlines five criteria for the emergence of a revolution from above. The criteria are later revised to include only four after incorporating the Egyptian and Peruvian cases. The five criteria are the following (p. 41-43): # Military bureaucrats have the potential for leading a revolution from above when the officer class—or a significant segment of it—is independent of those classes which control the means of production. Military bureaucrats are autonomous in this sense when they are not recruited from the dominant landed, commercial, or industrial classes, and when they do not form close personal and economic ties with these classes after their election to high office. # As bureaucrats, military officers are trained to be specialized professionals working in a hierarchy and isolated from general political concerns. Autonomous military bureaucrats become revolutionaries only if they develop political cohesion. # Autonomous military bureaucrats united around a nationalist ideology will act in a revolutionary manner only in response to movements within the country demanding an end to national degradation by foreign powers. # Autonomous military bureaucrats can stage a successful revolution from above only when contradictions in the international constellation of power can be exploited to increase national autonomy. # Dissident military bureaucrats must have a provincial base of power separate from the central government to stage a revolution from above. Trimberger removes the final criterion in applying the theory to the Egyptian and Peruvian cases, given that these conflicts did not need a provincial base to succeed.  Criticism  Trimberger's book was favorably received by revolutions scholars, who had focused so much on the \\"Great Revolutions\\" of France, Russia, and China, but had largely neglected the so-called \\"revolutions from above\\". However, like Theda Skocpol's States and Social Revolutions, scholars have raised objections regarding the status of values, meaning, and cultural to the explanation of revolution. Another objection regards the selection and inclusion of cases: phenomena that fit under the rubric of \\"revolution from above\\" may fit more intuitively under another, more strictly delineated category.

Unallotment was used by a number of governors in the wake of the economic recession of 2008, most notably by Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty in July 2009. Requirements for Unallotment In Minnesota, in order for unallotment to be used, all of the following circumstances must exist: * A balanced budget has been enacted into law * Expected revenues have been determined to be less than anticipated * The governor has approved the unallotment * The commissioner has sought advice from the Legislative Advisory Committee * The budget reserve has been exhausted If all of these conditions exist, the executive branch is given broad authority to cut state budgets without the consent of the state legislature. Use In July 2009, Governor Tim Pawlenty used his unallotment authority to cut $33 million of the Minnesota state budget. This resulted in the budgets for most government agencies in Minnesota being cut by as much as 2.25%. In doing this, Pawlenty proclaimed that he would not ask the legislature to approve the unallotment cuts: “The legislators are gone, and they’re not coming back”. The response from some Democratic Minnesota legislators was to take steps to curtail the governor's unallotment power through legislation that would limit or repeal the governor's unallotment authority. Pawlenty indicated that he would veto any such legislation in a letter to Democratic legislators. Court Ruling on Unallotment The issue of the unallotment statute in Minnesota was heard by the Minnesota State Supreme Court in the case of Brayton et al. v. Pawlenty, et al. In a 4-3 majority opinion written by Chief Justice Eric Magnuson, a Pawlenty appointee as well as the governor's former law partner, the court ruled that Pawlenty eliminated money for the program before the budget process had been completed. The ruling said, in part: “The unallotment statute provides the executive branch with authority to address an unanticipated deficit that arises after the legislative and executive branches have enacted a balanced budget. The statute does not shift to the executive branch a broad budget-making authority allowing the executive branch to address a deficit that remains after a legislative session because the legislative and executive branches have not resolved their differences. Because the legislative and executive branches never enacted a balanced budget for the 2010-2011 biennium, use of the unallotment power to address the unresolved deficit exceeded the authority granted to the executive branch by the statute. We therefore affirm the district court’s conclusion that the unallotment of the [nutrition program] funds was unlawful and void.” The ruling in the Brayton case did not address the constitutionality of the unallotment statute; only that Gov. Pawlenty had violated the unallotment statute with his actions. Many critics of unallotment have doubts about the constitutionality of the unallotment authority, arguing that unallotment is a violation of separation of powers under Minnesota's constitution. Unallotment reform After the unallotment fight in Minnesota's Supreme Court, the Minnesota House of Representatives passed a bill altering the governor's unallotment powers in May 2010. The legislation caps the amount a governor can unallot from the general fund budget to 2% in addition to prohibiting the governor from eliminating entire programs using unallotment.

Ryan is an American businessman that came to prominence during the 1990s, when he was the first outsider to become CEO of Prudential Insurance. Starter years Arthur Ryan was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised on Long Island. He attended Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School. He went on to attend Providence College in 1963, where he received his BA in mathematics. During college, Ryan sold magazines to earn extra money; this was Ryan's first sales experience job. Ryan also served in the U.S. Army and was stationed outside of Washington D.C. While being in D.C., Ryan decided to take extra classes at American University. In 1965, Ryan was discharged from the Army and went to work as a computer system designer at Control Data Corporation. Early career From 1972 to December 1994, Ryan worked with Chase Manhattan Bank. In 1976, Ryan became head of the entire securities processing business for Chase. In 1978, Ryan hit his big break when Thomas G. Labrecque saw potential in Ryan and gave him the responsibility to oversee the bank's domestic wholesale operations like check processing, wire transfers and securities services. By 1984, Ryan was appointed to an executive vice president for Chase and received a chairman position on the board. In the same year, Labrecque succeeded the former CEO and Ryan realized that his career at Chase hit a plateau. Prudential Insurance At 52 years in old, Ryan was offered CEO and chairman position at Prudential Insurance, a life insurance company. He was the first outsider to become CEO of the company. He changed the whole system that Prudential operated on and the environment the Prudential grew a reputation for. In the news, Prudential was covered with scandals, so he asked New Jersey to launch a full investigation against the company. New Jersey came up with $35 million in fines and $410 million to $1 billion for victimized policy holders. During this time, Prudential slowly slipped down to 5th in assets. Ryan had no political agenda, he was there solely to create a better company. Ryan also launched an $800 million cost- cutting program. He fired hundreds of agents and managers. He improved the technology keeping Prudential competitive. Ryan's greatest success was bringing the company from a mutual to a stock company (a private company to public). The new company, Prudential Financial, took control of Prudential Insurance's assets while Ryan remained CEO. He retired from Prudential in 2008 and now lives in Florida but remains on the Board of biopharmaceutical company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. Philanthropy Arthur Ryan has been a loyal and generous supporter of his alma mater, Providence College, from which he earned a mathematics degree in 1963. In January 2015, the college announced that the new home of its School of Business will be called The Arthur and Patricia Ryan Center for Business Studies, thanks to a generous naming gift. The Ryan Concert Hall in the college's Smith Center for the Arts already bears the Ryan name, and the Arthur F. Ryan Family Scholarship Fund supports PC business students from Suffolk County, where he grew up. Ryan has also donated back to his high school. He and his wife have always valued the educational system and support it. He is also involved with New Jersey United to help public schools stay on top of the standards and better the community. Ryan is a trustee of Prudential Foundation and the Board of NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital. Ryan is married to his wife Patricia and has four grown children. He retired from Prudential in 2008 and now lives in Florida. He is the grandfather of seven.

Early life and education Chaplin was born in Philadelphia and graduated from St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire. He holds a degree in English literature from Boston University and an MA in American history from Stanford University, where he also attended the Stegner seminar in creative writing. Chaplin grew up in Nassau, Bahamas, where his father, Charles C. G. Chaplin, worked as an ichthyologist and co-authored the taxonomic textbook Fishes of the Bahamas and Adjacent Tropical Waters (Livingston Press 1968:, University of Texas Press 1992). Career Chaplin's first book, Joyride (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1982), is a novel stemming from his experiences in Southeast Asia both as a reporter in Newsweek's Saigon bureau and as an editor on the Bangkok World in Thailand. Its teenaged American protagonists, attending high school in Bangkok where their parents are based, embark on a motorcycle trip to Saigon, hoping to glimpse the war first-hand. The novel was optioned by film director Paul Mazursky, and Chaplin wrote the screenplay for MGM Studios. After fifteen years as a journalist, the last period of which he spent as a staff writer for the Washington Post Magazine, Chaplin moved to Todos los Santos, Baja California Sur where he worked as a trip leader, divemaster and publicistWashington Post, April 25, 1982,\\"Of Men and Whales in the Baja\\" for Baja Expeditions. There he became involved as a fundraiser and project consultant with the foundation Niparaja,Niparaja a non-profit group seeking to preserve the marine and coastal areas of the Gulf of California and the Pacific coast of Baja. Next, he took to the sea himself in the Lord Jim, a 36-foot Dutch-built motorsailor, with his partner Susan Atkinson. His travel- essay book, The Fever Coast Log: At Sea in Central America (Simon & Schuster, 1991) is an account of their voyage down the coast of Central America from Belize to Panama in the final days of the Sandinista regime and its American- backed opponents, the Contras. His memoir, Dark Wind:: A Survivor’s Tale of Love and Loss (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1999) details the tragedy of their next voyage, which ended with Susan’s death in a typhoon in the Marshall Islands, halfway across the Pacific. In addition to his journalism, he has contributed articles to Audubon Magazine,Audubon Magazine,\\"El Tigre Hombre\\", April 1986 p. 41 Men’s Journal,Men's Journal,\\"Carl Hiaasen's Unbalanced Nature\\" August 1997 p.67 Esquire,Esquire,\\"Stanley Marsh Plays with his Money\\" December 1974, p. 166 and other publications. In 2004 Chaplin was invited by a group of scientists from his father’s old institution, The Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, to participate in a 50-year retrospective study of the coral reef environment he’d frequented as a child, using his father's work as a baseline. His article \\"Return to the Reefs,\\" Smithsonian Magazine, Feb. 2006 and his subsequent book Full Fathom Five: Ocean Warming and a Father’s Legacy (Skyhorse Publishing, 2013) Kirkus Reviews, Aug. 2013 are accounts of this effort. As a research associate at the Academy, he is a co-author of two resulting scientific studies, \\"Assessing 50-year changes in Bahamian Reef Fish Assemblages: Evidence for Community Response to Recent Disturbances?\\"Bulletin of Marine Science, July 2011 and \\"Detection of Shifts in coral reef fish assemblages structures over 50 years at reefs of New Providence Island, the Bahamas, highlights the value of the Academy of Natural Sciences collections in a changing world\\".Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, March 2013. 162:61-87.

Career In 1891, Carpenter left school at age 14 to join the Sydney office of Burns, Philp & Co, Limited. In 1895, he was transferred to the firm's office at Esperance, Western Australia, and in 1896 to the Thursday Island, Queensland office. In 1899, he resigned from Burns Philp, bought three luggers and established a family pearl-shelling business, J. B. Carpenter & Sons Ltd., of which he was managing director. In 1908, leaving his brother William Carpenter in charge, he left Thursday Island and rejoined Burns Philp. After a year at the company's offices in Sydney, he moved to Fiji and managed a subsidiary company purchased by Burns Philp. In 1914 he formed the firm of W. R. Carpenter & Co. Ltd. in Sydney, and began establishing plantations, stores, trading stations, shipping services in the Southwest Pacific.The Carpenter Group: A Proud Tradition, http://www.carpenters.com.fj/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=18&Itemid;=35.

When World War I erupted, he capitalized on the importance of copra for making munitions and as a food, and took enormous risks with resulting large profits which enabled his company to expand into New Guinea when the Australian government expropriated German property. The company branched out as major storekeepers, traders, and property owners in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, establishing W. R. Carpenter & Co. (Papua New Guinea) Ltd. in 1919 and W. R.

In New Guinea, Carpenter took advantage of the development of the Morobe gold fields to acquire hotels in Wau and Bulolo, set up electrical power plants and cold storage facilities, and operate a fleet of inter-island steamers and a desiccated-coconut factory. In 1933 he established the first air service between Salamaua and Wau with two De Havilland Fox Moth aircraft, followed in 1934 by a direct shipping line between Australia, the Western Pacific, and European ports. In 1935 he launched an insurance company and in 1936 expanded his airline through a government-subsidized route between Rabaul and Australia. At the outbreak of World War II Carpenter's ships and aircraft were commandeered by Australian and British forces, so in 1940 he travelled to the United States and purchased two freighters which he operated in the Pacific free of European control. He formed a new company in Canada and built a copra- crushing mill near Vancouver to access the North American market. His buildings and plantations in New Guinea and the Solomon, Gilbert, and Ellice islands were destroyed when Japan entered the war, but he continued to benefit from wartime prosperity in Fiji, and later received compensation for war damage to his holdings. Philanthropy Carpenter was a generous philanthropist, counting among the public charities he supported the subsidizing of a home for destitute children, and donating a valuable house and a large amount in cash to the Commonwealth government for a 1935 jubilee maternity hospital, in addition to numerous other contributions to causes large and small in places where his company operated.

Personal Walter Randolph Carpenter was born on 31 October 1877 at Singapore, Straits Settlements to Captain John Bolton Carpenter and his wife Emma Frances (née Griffin) Carpenter. John Bolton Carpenter was a merchant, whaler and sea captain who emigrated from New Haven, Connecticut to Singapore as a result of American Civil War restrictions on his shipping business; Emma was a native of England. On 18 December 1899, Carpenter married Edith Anderson, daughter of a sugar planter. He was knighted in 1936. In November 1941 they relocated with his new Canadian company to Vancouver, British Columbia and in May 1948 became Canadian citizens. He died on 1 February 1954 at Killara, New South Wales, and was cremated with Anglican Rites. He was survived by his wife, two sons and three daughters.

In certain species of bats, which produce constant frequency (CF) echolocation calls, the bats compensate for the Doppler shift by lowering their call frequency as they approach a target. This keeps the returning echo in the same frequency range of the normal echolocation call. This dynamic frequency modulation is called the Doppler Shift Compensation (DSC), and was discovered by Hans Schnitzler in 1968.Schnitzler, H.U. 1968. Die Ultraschallortungslaute der Hufeisennasen- Fledermäuse (Chiroptera, Rhinolophidae) in verschiedenen. Z. Vergl. Physiol. 57, 376–408 CF bats employ the DSC mechanism to maintain the echo frequency within a narrow frequency range.Hiryu, S. Shiori, Y. Hosokawa, T. Riquimaroux, H. Wantanabe, Y. 2008. On Board Telemetry of Emitted Sounds from free-flying bats: Compensation for velocity and distance stabilize echo frequency. Journal of Comparative Physiology A. 194: 841–851. This narrow frequency range is referred to as the acoustic fovea. By modulating the frequency of the outgoing calls, the bats can ensure that the returning echoes stay nearly constant within this range of optimal sensitivity. Ultimately, by keeping the echoes in this optimal range, the bats can quickly ascertain certain properties (such as distance and velocity) about the target. This behavior appears to have evolved independently in several species of the Rhinolophidae and Mormoopidae families.Jones, G., & Teeling, E. (2006). The evolution of echolocation in bats. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 21(3), 149–156. . The common features shared by bats with DSC are that they produce CF sounds, and that they have a specialized cochlea that is adapted to receiving a narrow range of frequencies with high resolution. DSC allows these bats to utilize these features to optimize the echolocation behavior.  Description  All bats, when there is some nonzero relative velocity between itself and the target (the object that the call rebounds off of, which produces an echo), will hear Doppler shifted echoes of the pulses they produce. If the bat and the target are approaching each other, the bat will hear an echo that is higher in frequency than the call it produced. If they are moving away from each other, the bat will hear an echo that is lower in frequency than the call it originally produced. It is important that the bat be able to detect and be extremely sensitive to these echoes, so that it can determine properties about the target object. For CF bats, who possess an acoustic fovea, the Doppler shifted echo will fall outside of the narrow range of frequencies to which the bat is optimally responsive. This problem can be avoided if the frequency of the calls produced is altered. As the bat speeds up and approaches a target, the echoes it hears will be of increasingly high pitch, outside of the auditory fovea. In order to compensate for the Doppler shift during an approach toward an object of interest, the bat will lower the frequency of the calls it produces. The overall effect is that the echo frequency maintains nearly constant, and remains steadily within the auditory fovea. By lowering pulse frequency by the same increment that the Doppler shift will raise the echo frequency, the bat can maintain the frequency of the echoes around a constant value, within the auditory fovea. This was measured using a small, portable microphone (the Telemike) on the top of the bat's head to record the echo frequencies heard by the bat.  Bat Echolocation Calls  Bats can either produce echolocation calls of a constant frequency or that are frequency modulated. DSC is a unique strategy employed by constant frequency (CF) bats, which exclusively produce CF calls. These bats have a narrowly defined range of frequencies over which they are maximally sensitive, which is termed the acoustic fovea.  Constant Frequency vs. Frequency Modulated Pulses  DSC is only found in CF bats. This is because they have a narrow range of frequencies to which they are optimally sensitive, and have a specialized cochlea that is adapted to responding to one frequency with high resolution. DSC however is not employed by frequency-modulated, or FM, bats. These bats have a broad range of frequencies to which they are maximally sensitive, and thus do not need to tightly modulate the echo frequency. For FM bats, the frequency of the Doppler shifted echoes still falls within their range of auditory responsiveness. Hence, they do not need a DSC mechanism to optimize their echolocation behavior. FM bats produce short pulses, often less than 5 ms in duration, that contain a broad range of frequencies covering up to 80–100 kHz.Neuweiler, G. 2003. Evolutionary aspects of bat echolocation. Journal of Comparative Physiology A. 189(4): 245–256. Bats use FM pulses to determine target distance, by using the delay between multiple emitted pulses and their returning echoes to calculate range.Suga, N. 1990. Biosonar and Neural Computation in Bats. Scientific American. 60–68. In CF-FM bats, a short, upward FM sweep precedes the long, CF component of the pulse. The pulse is then terminated with a short, downward FM sweep. Bats that produce these types of compound signals still use the DSC to modulate the frequency of the returning echoes, due to the CF component of the pulse. These pulses are best suited for the precise determination of target distance. CF pulses are long pulses that are 10–100 ms in duration, which consist of a single component of a relatively constant frequency. These types of pulses are produced by CF bats, and are also incorporated into the calls of CF-FM bats, which produce compound pulses that contain both CF and FM elements. The CF pulse is preceded by a short, upward FM sweep, and is terminated by a brief, downward FM sweep. The second harmonic of the CF-FM pulse is typically the dominant (highest amplitude) sound, and is usually about 80 kHz. The fundamental frequency of the pulse is usually about 40 kHz, and is of a lower amplitude than the second harmonic. These types of echolocation pulses afford the bat the ability to classify, detect flutter (e.g. the fluttering wings of insects), and determine velocity information about the target. Both CF and CF-FM bats use the Doppler shift compensation mechanism is order to maximize the efficiency of their echolocation behavior. A bat's hearing is especially sensitive to sounds that have similar frequencies to its own echolocation pulses. The resting call pulses of CF and CF-FM bats are largely characterized by notes of a single frequency, while the resting calls of FM bats span an extensive range of frequencies. Stated differently, CF bats produce narrow bandwidth sounds, or sounds over a restricted range of frequencies. Contrastingly, FM bats produce broad bandwidth pulses, which contain a wide range of frequencies. It follows that CF bats have auditory systems that are highly sensitive to a limited range of frequencies, while the auditory systems of FM bats are sensitive to a vast range of frequencies.  The Acoustic Fovea  = Illustration = Original figure found in Metzner, Zhang, and Smotherman (2002) This plot shows behavioral threshold, in decibels, vs. frequency, in kilohertz, obtained from the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). In other words, on the y-axis is the threshold for which the bat will show a response, with a lower number indicating that the bat is more responsive (e.g. more sensitive) to a particular frequency.Metzner, W., Zhang, S., and Smotherman, M. 2002. Doppler- shift compensation behavior in horseshoe bats revisited: auditory feedback controls both a decrease and an increase in call frequency. Journal of Experimental Biology. 205(11): 1607–1616 The very sharp tuning curve, which is shown by the short bar below the graph, shows that the bat is maximally responsive to an extremely narrow range of frequencies. This sharp tuning curve is referred to as the acoustic, or auditory, fovea, and is demarcated on the plot by the short bar beneath the graph. = Description = As described in the previous section, a bat's hearing is especially sensitive to sounds that have similar frequencies to its natural echolocation pulses. In the case of a CF bat (such as the greater horseshoe bat), the narrow bandwidth of the frequencies contained within the pulse is reflected within the narrow range of frequencies to which the bat is optimally sensitive (which is shown in the tuning curve above). CF bats’ auditory systems are finely tuned to the narrowband frequencies in the calls they produce. This results in a sharp acoustic fovea, as illustrated in the audiogram above. The disproportionate number of receptors in the cochlea that respond to frequencies within a narrow range ultimately gives rise to the acoustic fovea. This cochlear morphology is the anatomical correlate of the acoustic fovea. As a result, bats are able to respond preferentially to sounds of these frequencies. = Function of acoustic fovea = The specificity of the auditory system is proportional to the range of frequencies found in the resting call frequency (RF) of the bat. Therefore, the narrow range of frequencies found within the RF of a CF bat is reflected in the sharp sensitivity of the auditory system (the auditory fovea). FM bats do not possess an acoustic fovea, because the broad range of frequencies in the RF does not lend itself to the formation of a sharply tuned auditory system. Rather, the vast range of frequencies in the resting call is reflected in the extensive range of frequencies to which an FM bat is responsive. Conversely, the narrow, well-defined span of frequencies within CF element of the CF pulses is reflected in the auditory system's sharp range of optimal sensitivity (e.g. a fovea). Evolutionarily, this proportionality between the tuning of the auditory system and the natural frequencies within the resting bat's calls is logical. It is advantageous to be maximally responsive to the frequencies found within the calls of conspecifics, and it follows that the frequencies found within conspecific calls is mimicked by the frequencies in one's own call. Thus, the narrow, well-defined span of frequencies within CF pulses is reflected in the auditory system's sharp range of optimal sensitivity (e.g. a fovea).  Which species have DSC?  CF bats use the DSC, to maintain a constant echo frequency.Schnitzler, H.U. and Denzinger, A. 2011. Auditory fovea and Doppler shift compensation: adaptations for flutter detection in echolocating bats using CF-FM signals. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 197(5): 541–559 Bats of the families Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, and some species within Mormoopidae employ the DSC to modulate the echo frequency. The Doppler shift compensation mechanism appears to have evolved independently in these families. Species within these families include those of the genus Rhinolophus, such as Rhinolophus ferrumequinum (the greater horseshoe bat), in the family Rhinolophidae, and those of the genus Pteronotus, in the family Mormoopidae. Bats of the genus Pteronotus include P. parnellii (Parnell's mustached bat, discovered by Suga et al., 1975Suga, N., Simmons, J.A., Jen, P.S. (1975). Peripheral specialization for fine analysis of Doppler-shifted echoes in the auditory system of the CF-FM bat Pteronotus parnellii. J Exp Biol. 63:161–192.) and P. personatus (Wagner's mustached bat).Smotherman, M., and Guillén-Servent, A. 2008. Doppler-shift compensation behavior by Wagner’s mustached bat, Pteronotus personatus. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 123(6), 4331–4339  Feedback Control of Call Frequency  In order to maintain the echo frequency around a constant value for optimal hearing, the bat must dynamically modulate the frequency of the pulses it emits. This is done rapidly in the naturally behaving animal, and is accomplished by making a series of small changes to the call frequency upon receiving auditory feedback in the form of an echo.Smotherman, M. and Metzner, W. 2003. Fine control of call frequency by horseshoe bats. Journal of Comparative Physiology A, 189(6): 435–446 These small changes are produced between, not within, calls. The bat produces a call, listens for the returning echo, and makes a small, step-wise adjustment in the frequency of its next pulse. By making small changes to the frequency of each call, and increasing the overall rate of pulses produced, the bat is able to rapidly attend to ongoing auditory feedback and use that information to accurately stabilize the echo frequency around a constant value. Making large changes in call frequency without increasing the call rate leads to a risk that the bat will overcompensate for the Doppler shift, which will also result in the echoes falling outside of the auditory fovea. By making a series of small, rapid changes to call frequency, the Doppler shift can be acutely compensated for, without the echo frequency falling outside of the acoustic fovea. This mechanism of feedback control ultimately optimizes speed, accuracy, and overall stability of the DSC in the animal's natural context.  Function of the Doppler Shift Compensation Mechanism  By continually decreasing the frequency of the emitted pulses as the target is approached (and the velocity of the bat with respect to the target is increased), the Doppler shifted echoes are dynamically maintained at a nearly constant frequency within the acoustic fovea. This allows the bat to perform neural computations about the target properties and target distance, because it is the most sensitive to the frequency that the echo is maintained at. The function of this echo frequency modulation thus is to optimize the resulting processing of the echo. By keeping the echo within the range that the bat is the most sensitive to, the bat can quickly pick up on the echo and process it for the relevant target information In this way, the bat modulates something that is relatively easy to control (the pulses it produces) while maintaining neural machinery that is sensitive to only a narrow range of frequencies. If the bat consistently produced the same pulse frequency as it approached the target, the echoes would increase way beyond this narrow range of sensitivity. This would result in the need for neural machinery that is extremely sensitive to a very wide range of frequencies, and more complicated neural computations. These computations would entail a very specific determination of the exact change in the echo frequency relative to the expected echo frequency, and then that information would somehow need to be related to the properties and distance of the target. On the other hand, simply detecting the change that is made to the pulse frequency and relating that to target properties is a lot simpler, in terms of a neural computation. Therefore, the overall function of the DSC is to allow echoes to be analyzed within a narrow range of optimal sensitivity, which ultimately reduces the computational strain on the bat's nervous system.  Neural Pathway  Neurons of the midbrain tegmentum of the CF-FM bat brain have been implicated in the DSC mechanism.Metzner, W. 1989. A possible neuronal basis for Doppler-shift compensation in echo-locating horseshoe bats. Nature 341, 529–532 Neurons of the tegmentum have firing properties that make them strong candidates for regulating DSC. The neuronal response in the tegmentum is dependent on the time delay between an auditory stimulus and the subsequent feedback, and the neurons only respond to paired stimuli that occur in DSC. Later work has revealed that the parabrachial nuclei (PB), a different region of the midbrain, is the neural substrate for DSC and auditory feedback regulation of pulse frequency.Smotherman, M., Zhang, S., and Metzner, W. 2003. A neural basis for auditory feedback control of vocal pitch. Journal of Neuroscience, 23(4), 1464–1477 When neurons of the PB are inhibited via exogenous drug administration (e.g. using muscimol, the GABAA agonist, or CNQX, an AMPA antagonist), the pulse frequencies emitted at rest and in flight (during DSC) were lowered. Conversely, when the area was excited via exogenous drug administration (e.g. using BMI, the GABAA antagonist, or AMPA to cause excitation), the resting call frequency was increased, and there was a severely reduced or completely abolished response to auditory feedback of increased frequency. The magnitude and specificity of these results suggest that the PB is directly involved in the integration of auditory and vocal stimuli, and is involved in neural regulation of call frequency, because manipulations in the area drastically affected pulse frequency. This is suggestive of a midbrain network of control of call parameters, that functions in parallel to and independently of cortical control of pulse parameters.  Advantages of the Doppler Shift Compensation Mechanism in Biosonar Systems  This mechanism allows for the reduction of neural computational load (as described in the \\"Function of the Doppler Shift Compensation Mechanism\\" section). In biosonar, instead of having the animal be highly sensitive to every frequency and then compute the target properties from a wide range of echo frequencies, the animals control something that is relatively easy to modulate- the frequency of the emitted pulses. The resulting neural computation is much simpler to perform; the bat only needs to detect the feedback regulated changes that it actively makes to its pulses, and how this relates to target distance and target properties. Artificial sonar systems are less effective and employ the opposite strategy. They produce only one pulse frequency, and must detect a wide range of echo frequencies in order to calculate information about the environment. This results in a more complicated echolocation computation, in which there is a need to compute now how deviations of the echo frequencies relate to target properties. Such a sonar mechanism increases computational strain on the system, and reduces its overall effectiveness.

Stutenkerl is available usually around Saint Nicholas' Day, December 6, but in parts of the Rhineland at Saint Martin's Day in November.

It is a perennial found in the state of Meghalaya, India. Most members of the ginger family, to which it belongs, are tropical, but R. brandisii, like other species of Roscoea, grows in much colder mountainous regions. Description Roscoea brandisii is a perennial herbaceous plant. Like all members of the genus Roscoea, it dies back each year to a short vertical rhizome, to which are attached the tuberous roots. When growth begins again, \\"pseudostems\\" are produced: structures which resemble stems but are actually formed from the tightly wrapped bases (sheaths) of its leaves. Plants are usually tall, occasionally shorter or up to . The first one or two leaves consist only of sheaths; the remaining 5–8(–11) leaves have curved (falcate) blades mainly long by wide (although lengths and widths outside this range are also found). The sheaths sometimes have small 'ears' (auriculate) at the junction of the blade and sheath, where there is also a small ligule, extending to about . The stem (peduncle) of the flower spike (inflorescence) is held within the leaves. The bracts which subtend the flowers are more or less the same length as the calyx. Each flower has the typical structure for Roscoea (see the diagrams in that article). There is a tube-shaped outer calyx, with a bluntly two-lobed apex. Next the three petals (the corolla) form a white tube, longer than the calyx, terminating in three purple lobes, a hooded upright central lobe, about long by wide, and two narrower side lobes, about long by about wide (which are sometimes fused). Inside the petals are structures formed from four sterile stamens (staminodes): two lateral staminodes form what appear to be small upright petals, which are by , with a non-central vein; two central staminodes are fused to form a lip or labellum, long by about wide. The labellum may or may not be split into two lobes at the end. The single functional stamen has an anther, about long, with long spurs formed from the connective tissue between the two capsules of the anther. The seeds when they form are brown and somewhat elliptical. R. brandisii resembles R. auriculata. The two species are separated by lowlands in Assam and the Indian state of West Bengal. R. brandisii is usually smaller, with narrower falcate leaves and smaller purple flowers with a long white tube at the base. Taxonomy Roscoea brandisii was initially treated as part of R. purpurea (e.g. by Hooker in 1852). It was first separately named in 1890 as Roscoea purpurea var. brandisii King ex Baker. Karl Schumann elevated it to a full species in 1904. The collector of the type specimen was named Brandis. Evolution and phylogeny The family Zingiberaceae is mainly tropical in distribution. The unusual mountainous distribution of Roscoea may have evolved relatively recently as a reaction to the uplift taking place in the region in the last 50 million years or so due to the collision of the Indian and Asian tectonic plates. Species of Roscoea divide into two clear groups, a Himalayan clade and a \\"Chinese\\" clade (which includes some species from outside China). The two clades correspond to a geographical separation, their main distributions being divided by the Brahmaputra River as it flows south at the end of the Himalayan mountain chain. It has been suggested that the genus may have originated in this area and then spread westwards along the Himalayas and eastwards into the mountains of China and its southern neighbours. R. brandisii falls into the Himalayan clade. It occurs to the south of the rest of the clade, on the other side of the Brahmaputra River. Distribution and habitat Roscoea brandisii occurs only in the Khasia Hills in the modern Indian state of Meghalaya (formerly part of the state of Assam). It grows at altitudes of in grassland, rocky areas and banks, and on cliffs. Cultivation , R. brandisii is not known to be in cultivation. R. tumjensis has been grown in the UK under this name.

The 87-page report gives background to the situation, then identifies and document all the types of violations that took place, with the aim of putting out recommendations to the Bahraini government, as well as the EU, US, UN OHCHR and the ICC. The report was published on 22 November 2011, 1 day before the Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry report was published. The report has found that the violations have been widespread and systematic. Finally, the report urged the U.N. to \\"send an urgent mission to Bahrain to investigate the deaths of at least 4 protesters killed since BICI closed its doors.\\" Background As part of a string of protests that occurred across the Arab World following the self-immolation and eventual death of Mohammed Bouazizi in Tunisia, the mostly Shia population of Bahrain took to the streets demanding greater freedoms. The move was seen as potentially destabilising to the Sunni-led regime of Bahrain, following which a brutal government crackdown led to widespread suppressions of the Shia people across many sectors,Cockburn, Patrick (18 March 2011). \\"The Footage That Reveals the Brutal Truth About Bahrain's Crackdown – Seven Protest Leaders Arrested as Video Clip Highlights Regime's Ruthless Grip on Power\\".

It occurs at depths of and lives on the substrate under large rocks, cliffs or other overhangs. Physical appearance Like all triplefin-blennies, T. delaisi has three dorsal fins and can hence easily be distinguished from members of the families Blenniidae (1 dorsal fin) and Gobiidae (2 dorsal fins) that have a similar live-style and general appearance. It has a peaked head and short tentacles above the eyes.⁠ Colouration The common name yellow black-faced blenny derives from the colouration of territorial males during the breeding season: their body becomes yellow and their head turns black; during a territorial fight the colouration of the head changes to a grey colour as a sign of aggression. Non- territorial males, females, and juveniles are cryptically coloured and are grey-brown with five dark and broad dorso-ventral bands between the head and the tail. Outside the breading season, males and females can only be told apart with certainty by dissection. Body dimensions The black-faced blenny can grow up to long. On average, territorial males () are slightly larger than non-territorial males () and females ().⁠ Individuals caught in deeper water are generally larger than those captured in shallow waters.⁠ Distinction from T. tripteronotus Territorial males are distinctive and can hardly be confounded with any other species. Non-territorial males, females, and juveniles, are very similar in T. delaisi and Tripterygion tripteronotus. They can be told apart by a dark spot on the basis of the tail of T. delaisi, which is absent in T. tripteronotus. Additionally, the largest spine of the first dorsal fin is the first one in T. delaisi, whereas the 2nd spine is of equal length (in some individuals even larger) in T. tripteronotus. Fluorescence The iris of T. delaisi produces a fluorescent red signal. This signal is effected by guanine crystals in iridophores located in the stratum argentum, a reflective silvery, cellular layer external to the iris.⁠ These guanine crystals absorb a large part of the ambient light (400-580 nm, peak at 540 nm) and re-emit it at longer wavelengths with a peak emission of 600 nm (perceived as red by humans).⁠ On the posterior side of the stratum argentum lays a layer of melanophores with finger-like extensions that reach above the iridophore layer of the stratum argentum. The fish controls the brightness of its fluorescence through aggregation (brighter) and disaggregation (duller) of pigmented melanosomes in these finger-like expansions. The transport of the melonosomes is K⁺-dependent and thus likely to be neurally controlled.⁠ When stressed or inactive the fluorescence decreases in intensity, but gets brighter when foraging. Additional to the fast change in brightness, a long-time adaptation to the light environment has been described for the fluorescence of T. delaisi: The fluorescence of animals caught at is significantly more efficient than in animals caught at .⁠⁠ Experiments have shown that this long-time adaptation is controlled by the ambient brightness and not by the ambient spectrum.⁠ T. delaisi has three cone types in its retina: two single cones (maximal photon absorption at 481 nm and 500 nm respectively) and a double cone (maximal photon absorption at 518 and 531 nm). The absorption rate of the double cone overlaps with the fluorescence emission; T. delaisi is hence physiologically capable of detecting its own fluorescence. Behavioural experiments have shown that T. delaisi can distinguish between grey cues and cues matching the colour of its fluorescence ⁠ and is therefore capable of perceiving its own fluorescence. Ecology and behaviour Diet and feeding behaviour T. delaisi is a carnivore that mainly feeds on small crustaceans, such as Harpacticoids, Tanaidaceans, Caprellidae, and Amphipods. It cannot bite pieces out of its prey and thus cannot eat prey larger than its mouth.⁠ Defecation takes 1 to 2 s.⁠ Prior to the capture, T. delaisi looks at the prey item for several seconds; meanwhile the first dorsal fin rhythmically twitches about twice per second. The capture is achieved by a sudden inhaling movement, which sucks the prey into the mouth. If the prey is attached to the substrate, it is torn loose by a sideward movement of the head. Locomotion and resting Over large distances the locomotion of T. delaisi can be described as anguilliform: The propulsion is caused by wavy movements of tail and body. During this motion the pectoral fins are adducted and the 3rd dorsal fin and the caudal fin are spread. Raising all dorsal fins precedes swimming over short distances. Repeated synchronous adduction of the pectoral fins thrusts the body forward and is aided by backwards- and downwards-movements of the pectoral fins. While swimming the dorsal fins are folded. When resting, T. delaisi lifts up the anterior part of the body and leans on the lower edge of the pectoral and on the ventral fins. T. delaisi sleeps on unprotected substrate relaying entirely on its camouflage.⁠ To scratch one of its sides, T. delaisi turns on that side and swims (using tailbeats for locomotion) to rub its body against the substrate. When yawning, it opens the mouth wide, spreads its operculum and lowers the floor of the buccal cavity while spreading the caudal and all dorsal fins.⁠ Reproduction Overall the territorial period of the males lasts from beginning of February until beginning of September, but the average duration of the territorial period per male was 47.1 days (in Corsica )⁠. Male T. delaisi show territorial behaviour for 2 consecutive years. Spawning takes place from mid of March until June.⁠ The male territories are located on the lower side of overhanging cliffs and rocks and have a diameter of around . If two territories are visually hidden from each other their centres can be as close as . Within the territory a smaller area of is used for nesting. Male T. delaisi are able to find their territories from distances up to 200 m away.⁠ =Fights= During the reproductive season territorial males will defend their territory from intruders; this behaviour is not displayed outside the breeding season. The behaviour of a challenged territorial male varies with the size of the intruder ⁠: If the intruding male is smaller than the territory holder, the holder rams it to drive it away. If the intruder is almost as large as the territory holder, the territory holder swims in front of the intruder (both fish form the letter T) and the territory holder beats the intruder with its tail until the intruder retreats. If the intruder is as large or larger than the territory holder a fight might take place. The territory holder warns the intruder by raising its first dorsal fin. This gesture is succeeded by slowly moving the anterior part of the body up and down (further called rearing up) if the intruder does not retreat. The intruding male may respond with a rearing-up-motion itself. This initialises a fight: The territory holder, tail-beating and all dorsal fins spread, swims towards the intruder, where they move into either a parallel or an antiparallel position. Now, both fish use their tails to beat each other; in later stages of the fight they may also ram and bite each other. The fight is frequently interjected by short breaks, during which the animals sit on the ground and rear-up. In most described fights, the territory holder successfully defends its territory and the intruder retreats at some point. Fights between females are rare, interspecific fights with closely related species (such as Tripterygion tripteronotus or Tripterygion melanurus) have not been described. If a spawning T. delaisi pair is disturbed by another territorial male, both spawning fish ram the intruder until it flees. When a female enters the territory of a male T. delaisi, that is not ready to spawn, the male drives the female away by ramming.⁠ =Spawning= Spawning is always initialised by females. They either move into the territory of a male and begin to spawn by themselves or react to a male performing courtship behaviour: When a male is ready to spawn but no female is close, it swims loops from the ground upwards; these loops are directed horizontally in absence of a female and towards an attracted female when the attraction behaviour is successful.⁠ If undisturbed, a female spawns all mature eggs in one spawning session (thus, with the same male), and a male may fertilize up to 490 eggs a day.⁠ One complete spawning session lasts for 45-105 min and each egg is laid individually. Spawning consists of two phases per egg: In the first phase, the female wriggles its whole body while slowly swimming over the substrate, scanning it for suitable nesting sites with its genital papilla. Once it found a suitable place to spawn the wriggling movements increase in frequency and decrease in amplitude and the first dorsal fin is spread. The male, which has either been sitting on the substrate near the female or swimming circles around her during the first phase, then moves closer and both tremble when releasing their gametes. Once the egg is laid and fertilized, the male jumps away from the female, which repeats phase 1. To further stimulate the female, the male frequently swims in the shape of an 8 in front of the female. Spawning finishes when the female leaves the territory of the male or stops wriggling for more than 20 seconds, after which it is driven off by the male. =Parental care= The female leaves after spawning and only the male takes care of the eggs. Fanning fresh water at the eggs for increased oxygen supply, a widely distributed behaviour in most fish families, is not displayed by T. delaisi. Nevertheless, the male cleans the eggs by frequent plucking and defends them against predators. The main threat to T. delaisi eggs are blenniids, juvenile sparids, Crenilabrus species, crabs and sea urchins. Although some of these predators are much larger than the defending male, a nest is only rarely preyed upon when defended by a male; when removed all eggs are normally eaten within half an hour.⁠ Fish predators are bitten in their flanks and fins, crabs in their eye-stalks and successfully driven away. Although sea urchins are also attacked by T. delaisi males, they are the only threat a guarding male cannot defend his eggs against.⁠ Dead eggs are removed by the male and usually eaten. If a dead egg is still attached to substrate it is carried away from the rest of the eggs and spat out. When accidentally plucking a hatching egg, the male swims upwards and spits the larva out, giving it a better chance of being carried away by the water currents. =Larval development= Larvae of T. delaisi hatch after approximately 19–20 days and live as plankton for several weeks before returning to a benthic lifestyle as post-larvae;⁠ the first post-larvae can already be found in July. The entire development takes place in nearshore-environments. Distribution and habitat T. delaisi inhabits 2 disjunct areas: 1. the western Mediterranean Sea and adjacent parts of the Atlantic Oceans from north to the British Isles and south of Casablanca and Morocco, 2. western tropical Africa north to Senegal and the Macaronesian islands. It lives at depths between ⁠ but is most common at depths between . It prefers shaded, dark areas, such as shady rock faces, overhangs and crevices ⁠. In the Atlantic Ocean T. delaisi can be observed without cover even in shallow waters, but in the Mediterranean Sea it can only be seen without cover below depths of . This phenomenon can be explained through a lack of competition: In the Mediterranean Sea T. tripteronotus occurs in depth from ⁠ whereas in the Atlantic Ocean, where T. tripteronotus is absent, this niche is free to occupy. The territorial males of T. tripteronotus and T. melanurus both have a red body with a black head,⁠ a signal that is strong in shallow waters where red light is still abundant, but becomes less and less striking with increasing depth due to the high absorption of long wavelengths in water. This might explain why T. delaisi only occurs below in depth, whereas T. tripteronotus lives between : Males with a primarily red colouration can only successfully court for females where red light is present in the environment but in these shallow waters red is a stronger signal than yellow. Yellow males however, still exhibit a relatively striking colouration even at larger depths where they can successfully court for females. Phylogeny and evolution Taxonomy T. delaisi belongs in the genus Tripterygion in the family Tripterygiidae, which consists of four species: T. delaisi (Cadenat & Blache, 1970), T. melanurus (Guichenot, 1850), T. tartessicum (Carreras-Carbonell, Pascual & Macpherson, 2007) and T. tripteronotum (Risso, 1810). Besides T. delaisi, all species are endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. The species T. delaisi is subdivided in two subspecies: T. delaisi delaisi in the Mediterranean Sea and T. delaisi xanthosoma in the Atlantic Ocean. The subspecies can be distinguished by their courtship behaviour: T. delaisi delaisi court in free water and T. delaisi xanthosoma stay on the ground for courtship behaviour. Speciation The speciation process is still under discussion and several hypotheses have been proposed. * Zander (1972)⁠ suggests that T. tripteronotus and T. delaisi evolved from two populations that were separated along the western African coast during the last glaciations — a cold-resistant population, northern population (ancestors of T. delaisi) and a warm-adapted southern population (ancestors of T. tripteronotus). * Wirtz (1978, 1980)⁠ proposes that the current Tripterygion species are the ancestors from the last group of primarily African fish that invaded the Mediterranean Sea several times and were isolated in the Mediterranean Sea by a fluctuation of sea levels. * De Jonge and Videler (1989)⁠ argue that the current Tripterygion species evolved either sym- or allopatrically inside the Mediterranean Sea. * Geertjes et al. (2001)⁠ suggest that the speciation process started in the Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) and that T. melanurus and T. tripteronotus survived the glaciation. T. delaisi would then have diverged sympatrically from T. tripteronotus. * Carreras-Carbonell, Macpherson and Pascual (2005)⁠ analysed five different genes and came to the conclusion that T. delaisi, T. melanurus, and T. tripteronotus rapidly diverged after the Messinian Salinity Crisis and have a trichotomic relationship. * An analysis of several nuclear and mitochondrial genes has shown that there are two clades of T. delaisi with limited gene- flow: one on the eastern Atlantic islands and a second one in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts of Europe. The time of coalescence of these clades is estimated to be 1.7 million years ago (i.e. more recent than the Pleistocene glaciations). The conclusion of this analysis is that the ancestors of Tripterygion colonized the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean from their western African home range.⁠ Etymology The species was described in 1970 by Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache, from a type series collected at Gorée in Senegal by Michel Delais of Institut Fondamental d'Afrique Noire in Dakar, who is honoured in its specific name.

Initially designed to extend the Atom (and RSS) protocols for data feeds, the protocol can be applied to any data type (e.g. HTML, text, pictures, audio, video) as long as it is accessible via HTTP. Its main purpose is to provide real-time notifications of changes, which improves upon the typical situation where a client periodically polls the feed server at some arbitrary interval. In this way, WebSub provides pushed HTTP notifications without requiring clients to spend resources on polling for changes. In October 2017, PubSubHubbub was renamed to WebSub for simplicity and clarity. , the WebSub protocol has been adopted by the W3C as a Recommendation.  Protocol  Under WebSub, there is an ecosystem of publishers, subscribers, and hubs. A subscriber first retrieves content from an HTTP resource (URL) by requesting it from the webserver. The subscriber then inspects the contents of the response, and if it references a hub, the subscriber can subscribe to that resource's URL (it's called a 'topic' by the spec) on that hub. The subscriber needs to run a web accessible server so that hubs can directly notify it when any of its subscribed topics have updated, using a webhook mechanism. Publishers expose their content with the inclusion of hub references in the HTTP headers. They post notifications to those referenced hubs whenever they publish something. Thus, when a publication event occurs, the publisher calls its hubs and the hubs call their subscribers. WebSub includes a simple verification of intent mechanism in order to prevent abusive subscriptions, and a validation mechanism allows for subscriptions to private or protected web resources. When the subscriber sends the subscription request to the hub, the subscriber address and a code needs to be included. The hub immediately sends a verification message to the subscriber with the URL of the topic and the above code. The subscription request will only be accepted if the subscriber sends a positive response to the verification request of the hub. In order to provide a secure chain, subscribers should share a secret with the hub, which will be used by the hub to compute an HMAC key that will be sent to the subscriber. The latter can then easily verify the origin by comparing the supplied signature with a similarly computed signature on their end.  Usage  WebSub is used to push content by many websites, including all blogs served by Blogger and WordPress.com, news sites including CNN and Fox News, and social networks like diaspora*, Mastodon, MySpace or Medium.com. Subscribing services (“feed readers”) include Flipboard, Feedly, NewsBlur, among other popular options.

The riots left 18 people dead. Following a policy of appeasing the National Socialist German Workers Party, Franz von Papen's government on 28 June 1932 lifted a ban on the SA and SS which had been in place since April. This led to recurrent riots and open street fighting between Nazis and Communists. In July, an SA and SS demonstration through the workers' quarter of Altona was approved by Social Democratic police president Otto Eggerstedt, despite threats by the Communists. Eggerstedt himself was on an election trip, and his deputy was on vacation. As expected, it triggered a major confrontation between 7,000 Nazis and Altona's Communist residents, leading to massive police intervention. Eighteen people, including two SA members, were killed, most of them by police bullets. The riots were used by Papen as an excuse for his Prussian Coup on 20 July. When Hitler seized power in Germany in May 1933, 15 Communists who had been arrested were tried for murder. In addition to prison terms, four of the accused were sentenced to death and beheaded on 1 August 1933. In the 1990s, the Federal Republic of Germany reversed these convictions, declaring the convicted men innocent.

The museum has collected authentic equipment from a former military installation.  The name  The coastal artillery fortress was named Batterie Vara (MAB 6./502 Vara) by the Germans, when it was built by the German Wehrmacht during World War II. It was named after Major General Felix Vara, who was killed off Alderney in the English channel on 3 November 1941. After the war, the Norwegian Armed Forces named it Møvik Fort.  History  The fort was constructed between 1941 and 1944 by the German navy. Together with four other coastal batteries, it formed a part of the Kristiansand Artillery Group. Together with its sister battery at Hanstholm in Denmark, Møvik Fort was built to obstruct Allied naval forces by blocking the Skagerrak strait and the seaways to Eastern Norway, the Kattegatt Bay, the Baltic Sea and the Baltic region for the allied naval forces.History at the Kristiansand Cannon Museums Homepage Only a field, ten nautical miles wide, in the Skagerrak could not be covered by the guns of these facilities. This field was therefore mined.The Atlantic Wall Linear Museum - 085_N 6_Marine Artillerie Abteilung 502 Battery Vara in Norwegian Adolf Hitler worked personally for the barrier strategy and the decision about the fortress in Hanstholm was made in May 1940. In May 1941, two of the guns in Hanstholm were in place and on the Norwegian side preparatory work started. For a few years after the war, Møvik fort was an operating Norwegian fortress. In 1953 it became part of Kristiansand fortress. On April 20, 1959 the fort was closed and two of the guns and the foundations of the fourth were scrapped.Kristiansand Kannonmuseum on www.venturenorway in English Møvik: Det største tyske forsvarsverk på Sørlandet DigitaltMuseum  The museum  Plans for a museum began in 1984.

He succeeded his grand-nephew Philipp Ludwig III in 1641. When Johann Ernst died in 1642, Hanau-Münzenberg fell to the Hanau-Lichtenberg line.  Youth  Johann Ernst was the son of Count Albrecht of Hanau-Münzenberg-Schwarzenfels and his wife, Countess Ehrengard of Isenburg-Büdingen. Johann Ernst was educated at the school of the former convent in Schlüchtern, which is now called the Ulrich-von-Hutten-Gymnasium, and the University of Basel. After completing his studies, he undertook a Grand Tour to France. He returned home in 1633. The Thirty Years' War forced him and his family to Worms and later to Strasbourg, where they faced great financial difficulties. After his father died there, he followed his mother to Frankfurt. Unlike his father, he did not challenge his nephew's right to rule Hanau-Münzenberg alone and did not demand a role as co-regent. He got on well with the ruling count, his nephew Philipp Moritz and his wife Sibylle Christine of Anhalt-Dessau.  Reign  Philipp Ludwig III died on 21 November 1641 at the age of 9. With his death, the main Hanau-Münzenberg line died out in the male line, and the county fell to Johann Ernst, as the only male representative of the collateral line Hanau- Münzenberg-Schwarzenfels. Shortly after ascending the throne, he became engaged to Susanna Margarete of Anhalt-Dessau, a sister of Sibylle Christine. However, he died before they could marry. Susanna Margarethe later married Johann Philipp of Hanau-Lichtenberg. Her sister, Sibylla Christina, married Johann Philipp's elder brother, who was Johann Ernst's successor, Friedrich Casimir. Both marriages remained childless.  Death  Johann Ernst died of smallpox on 12 January 1642, after reigning for only seven weeks. The attending physicians, including Peter de Spina III, had only recognized the disease very late and had treated him with laxatives and bloodletting when he was dying. He was buried on 26 February 1642 in the family vault in the St. Mary's Church in Hanau, which had to be extended first, as it was full. The metal coffin in which he was buried, was stolen in 1812, during the Napoleonic Wars. His body and corpses from other stolen coffins, were reburied in a common coffin. Johann Ernst was succeeded by Friedrich Casimir, who was also Count of Hanau-Lichtenberg, thereby reuniting Hanau in a single hand, after a 184-year split. As Friedrich Casimir was still a minor, he stood under the regency of Baron Georg II of Fleckenstein-Dagstuhl.

K. Thamizharasu. The film featured Arulnidhi and Ineya in the lead roles, while John Vijay, Madhusudhan Rao, Uma Riyaz Khan, Krishnamoorthy, and Balakrishnan play supporting roles. Mouna Guru illustrates a misunderstood college youth who becomes unwittingly involved in a crime plot that spirals his life out of order. The film, which has music composed by S. Thaman, released on 16 December 2011 to highly positive reviews, subsequently becoming a sleeper hit. The film was remade in Kannada as Guru, in Telugu as Shankara and in Hindi as Akira. Plot Karunakaran (Arulnidhi) finds it difficult to adjust with the society that he lives. As a result, he is unable to control his anger and ends up with trouble. His unpredictable behavior becomes a constant worry for his mother (Sujatha Sivakumar) and brother. A series of incidents force him to leave his hometown of Madurai and end up in Chennai. Despite scoring high marks in school, he joins a local arts college in the city and stays in a hostel, where trouble begins. Medical student Aarthi (Ineya) is the younger sister of Karuna's sister in-law, and she has had soft corner for Karuna. Meanwhile, rogue Assistant Commissioner Marimuthu (John Vijay), Inspector Rajendran (Madhusudhan Rao), Sub-Inspector Selvam (Balakrishnan), and Head Constable Perumalsamy (Krishnamoorthy) witness a car accident in the outskirts of Chennai. When they are about to take the victim to a nearby hospital, they come across a huge stash of cash. The policemen kill the half-dead victim and flee to Chennai with the money. However, Maya (Kajal), a prostitute, finds the truth by overhearing Marimuthu's telephone conversation and video records it. When Maya plans to threaten Marimuthu, she accidentally loses her camera which had the video footage. The next day, Marimuthu gets a threatening call from a guy and finds out that it was Maya who recorded his conversation. An angered Marimuthu beats up Maya and eventually kills her. A sincere police officer named Palaniammal (Uma Riyaz Khan) takes up this case. In the college where Karuna studies, there is a series of thefts happening in the hostel. Marimuthu finds out that it was one of the college students who had actually stolen Maya's camera and threatened him. One day, a bag containing all the stolen items is kept in front of Karuna's hostel room, making him the prime suspect of all the threats, which leads him to get arrested. Marimuthu, along with his friends, kidnaps Karuna and Maya's friends with plans of killing them in a forest. They kill Maya's friends, but Karuna escapes from there and reaches Chennai. In the meantime, Marimuthu understands that it was not Karuna who had blackmailed him. Karuna is falsely accused of mental instability by Marimuthu and his team of policemen and is institutionalised. Karuna is kept under constant sedation with the help of a corrupt doctor. They forge a story that Karuna is suffering from a mental disorder which makes him think that he is being chased by a group of policemen for a fake encounter. Karuna escapes from the mental asylum and reaches his hostel. Karuna kidnaps Rajendran and threatens him to disclose all the truth to the public. Meanwhile, Palaniammal collects vital info and cracks the case. It is revealed that the person who stole Maya's camera was Dinesh (Dinesh Ravi), who happens to be the son of the college principal. Knowing this, the principal had tried to save his son by keeping all the stolen items in front of Karuna's room during vacation, so that honest Karuna will return the things and all will be done. But everything went south. When Palaniammal corners and is about to arrest the culprits in the college old auditorium, she gets a call from the commissioner that the person murdered by Marimuthu and his team of policemen was a leading politician in Bangalore which could lead to state problems and hence does not disclose this to the media. Palaniammal is helpless and leaves the place. However, Karuna gets angry and kills Marimuthu, Rajendran, Selvam, and Perumalsamy. Karuna is sentenced to psychological treatment (as he is falsely believed to have a mental disorder). After getting released, he marries Aarthi and becomes a deaf-dumb school teacher.

The Hindu gave the film a positive review citing that \\"Mouna Guru is one of the small gems of Tamil cinema this year\\" and that \\"it marks a promising debut for Shantakumar and advances Arulnidhi's career\\". Rohit Ramachandran from Nowrunning.com rated the movie 3/5 and wrote that \\"Mouna guru is a well-intentioned thriller that keeps you glued to your seat, which is more than I can say for most Tamil movies.\\" Sify.com described the film as \\"very good\\", claiming it \\"works as an intelligent, taut thriller that sustains dramatic tension throughout\\". The critic also went on to claim that Arulnithi \\"drives the film with the intensity in his eyes, body language and an underplayed performance\\", while describing John Vijay's performance as \\"riveting\\".

Based on oral records, he ruled from some time around 1780 to around 1810. Early years Ilunga Sungu's father was King Kekenya and his mother was a Songye princess named Dyango. His father died when he was young, and was succeeded by Ilunga Sungu's cousin Kumwimbe Kaumbu. Ilunga Sungu would have lived with his mother's Ilande subgroup of southern Songye people while he was a child. Traditions say that Kumwimbe Kaumbu attacked the northern Songe and much of the fighting took place among the southern Songye, but do not mention any attack on Ilunga Sungu. After Kumwimbe Kaumbu died following an unsuccessful battle, he was briefly succeeded by his brother Miketo. Ilunga Sungu disputed the succession and gained the throne without serious opposition. King A nineteenth century Luba sculpture Ilunga Sungu gained power around 1780, although the exact date is very uncertain. He established his court at Katende, southwest of Lake Boya and to the west of the Mashyo salt district of the Luba heartland. Previously the Luba kings had built their palaces northeast of Lake Boya, but the move to Katende set a precedent for locating the capital near the Mashyo resource that was followed by Ilunga Sungu's successors. Later he established a second residence at Kipushya village to the east in the upper Luvidjo River valley, in the iron-producing region of Kilulwe. The two residences lay on either side of the heartland with its wealth of iron and salt. During his rule, the Luba Empire expanded, conquering and assimilating distant peoples, often in densely populated regions. The size achieved was impressive given that all travel was by foot or by canoe. The kingdom of Mutombo Mukulu lay between the Luba kingdom to its east and the Lunda kingdom to the west. Ilunga Sungu attempted to persuade Mutombo Mukulu to accept his authority, and when this was refused made an unsuccessful attempt to conquer the kingdom. The Kanyok states lay still further west in the area between the Lubilash and Mbuji Mayi rivers. By tradition, the heads of these states paid tribute to the Luba emperors, and at their accession had to visit the Luba emperor and pay tribute before being acknowledged. Around 1800 the Kanyok states became unified, and rejected Luba authority. According to legend, the town of Katende had become so large that the \\"Lord of Hygiene\\" could not keep the streets clear of refuse and excrement, even working all day with the help of his sons and relatives. The old king complained, blaming the Kanyoks, and said they should take their dirt home with them. The Kanyok went back to their home in the west and never paid tribute to the Luba again. The Luba invaded Kanyok territory, but after various engagements were forced to withdraw. To the east, the Luba under Ilunga Sungu had more success with their expansionary policy. The land east of the Lualaba River between the Lukuga and the Luvua rivers was inhabited by the Hemba, or eastern Luba, in the east and the Tumbwe further east in the highlands beside Lake Tanganyika. Luba forces raided this territory and penetrated as far as the region of Kalemie at the source of the Lukuga where it exits the lake. Some of the Luba remained there, settling among the local Holoholo people and paying tribute to the Luba emperors. The Hemba also became tributaries to the Luba, headed by a \\"fire king\\", who symbolically represented the Luba king. Ilunga Sungu died at Katende and was buried there. Two of Ilunga Sungu's sons, Kape and Kumwimbe Ngombe, disputed the throne. After several engagements Kape was captured and executed, and Kumwimbe Ngombe emerged as the ruler. The Hemba fire kingdom in the east cut its links to the Luba empire after Ilunga Sungu died. Kumwimbe had to fight several campaigns to recover the eastern territories.

The film was directed by Tibor Takács, produced by Tracey Jeffrey and Written by Peter Mohan. It stars Michael Trucco and Kari Matchett. The plot describes the attempts to save San Francisco from a barrage of meteor strikes; how devastating if those meteors touch the earth's crust or ground and burning almost completely everything to ashes.  Plot  San Francisco becomes a target for waves of destructive meteors after a rogue comet swings past the earth. For astro-physicist, Dr. Michelle Young (Kari Matchett), what was meant to be a once-in-a-lifetime celestial event, turns into a nightmare as thousands of meteors transit through the atmosphere, destroying San Francisco. The military contacts Young to ask her to help investigate this extinction-level event and to determine what is causing the seemingly targeted strikes. Meanwhile, Colonel Tom (Michael Trucco) is responsible for the evacuation of the Bay area. Michelle discovers that Element 120, designated Unbinilium, is the main cause of meteors targeting the San Francisco area. Millions of years ago a Unbinilium asteroid hit the Earth and created the entire bay. Dr. Young immediately reports her findings to Colonel Jack Clancey (Viv Leacock) about Unbinilium. Unfortunately, they discover that a gigantic asteroid, named Apophis, is on a collision course with Earth. Their numbers show that the rock will hit the San Francisco bay within four hours. With each passing storm, everything deteriorates. Michelle and Colonel Clancey informs Gen. Brock (Kevin McNulty) that they need assistance from the Russians as US satellites won't be in position to guide the launched ICBMs, but the Russian satellites will be. They plan to use ICBMs to clear a path through the smaller meteor field, allowing for an experimental nuclear asteroid interceptor system to reach Apophis and divert it. They speak with the president and he tries to negotiate with the Russian president. As time runs out the president orders the ICBMs be launched, despite Russias hesitancy to assist. The ICBMs destroy the debris field while the interceptor nuclear missiles successfully divert Apophis and save the planet. The information in the film is astronomically incorrect. As the location of the impact of the meteors is leaded only by the rotation of the earth, it doesn’t go to east, but to west.

Bharat Mata by Abanindranath Tagore (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet Rabindranath Tagore, and a pioneer of the movement The modern Indian art movement in Indian painting is considered to have begun in Calcutta in the late nineteenth century. The old traditions of painting had more or less died out in Bengal and new schools of art were started by the British. Initially, protagonists of Indian art such as Raja Ravi Varma drew on Western traditions and techniques including oil paint and easel painting. A reaction to the Western influence led to a revival in primitivism, called as the Bengal school of art, which drew from the rich cultural heritage of India. It was succeeded by the Santiniketan school, led by Rabindranath Tagore's harking back to idyllic rural folk and rural life. Despite its country-wide influence in the early years, the importance of the School declined by the 'forties' and now it is as good as dead. British art schools Oil and easel painting In India began in the starting of eighteenth century which saw many European artists, such as Zoffany, Kettle, Hodges, Thomas and William Daniell, Joshua Reynolds, Emily Eden and George Chinnery coming out to India in search of fame and fortune. The courts of the princely states of India were an important draw for European artists due to their patronage of the visual and performing arts and also their need for European style of portraits The merchants of the East India Company also provided a large market for native art. A distinct genre developed of watercolour painting on paper and mica in the later half of the 18th century depicting scenes of everyday life, regalia of princely courts, and native festivities and rituals. Referred to as the \\"Company style\\" or \\"Patna style\\", it flourished at first in Murshidabad and spread to other cities of British suzerainty. The style is considered by authorities to be \\"of hybrid style and undistinguished quality\\". Post-1857, John Griffiths and John Lockwood Kipling (father of Rudyard Kipling) came out to India together; Griffith going on to head the Sir J. J. School of Art and being considered as one of the finest Victorian painters to come to India and Kipling went on to head both the J. J. School of Art and the Mayo School of Arts established in Lahore in 1878. The enlightened eighteenth-century attitude shown by an earlier generation of British towards Indian history, monuments, literature, culture and art took a turn away in the mid-nineteenth century. Previous manifestations of Indian art were brushed away as being \\"dead\\" and the stuff of museums; \\"from the official British perspective, India had no living art\\". To propagate Western values in art education and the colonial agenda, the British established art schools in Calcutta and Madras in 1854 and in Bombay in 1857. Raja Ravi Varma Raja Ravi Varma (1848–1906) was a remarkable self-taught Indian painter from the princely state of Travancore. His exposure in the west came when he won the first prize in the Vienna Art Exhibition in 1873. Varma's paintings were also sent to the World's Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893 and his work was awarded two gold medals.Kilimanoor Chandran, Ravi Varmayum Chitrakalayum(in Malayalam), Department of Culture, Kerala, 1998 He is considered the first of the modernists, and, along with Amrita Sher-gil (1913–1941), the main exponents of Western techniques to develop a new aesthetic in the subjective interpretation of Indian culture with \\"the promise of materiality in the medium of oils and the reality- paradigm of the mirror/window format of easel painting\\". Some other prominent Indian painters born in the 19th century are Pestonjee Bomanjee (1851–1938), Mahadev Vishwanath Dhurandhar (1867–1944), A X Trindade (1870–1935), M F Pithawalla (1872–1937), Sawlaram Lakshman Haldankar (1882–1968) and Hemen Majumdar (1894–1948). The work of Varma was considered to be among the best examples of the fusion of Indian traditions with the techniques of European academic art, in the colonial-nationalistic framework of the 19th century. He is most remembered for his paintings of beautiful sari-clad women, who were portrayed as shapely and graceful. Varma became the best-known allegorist of Indian subjects in his depiction of scenes from the epics of the Mahabharata and Ramayana. Raja Ravi Varma considered his work as \\"establishing a new civilisational identity within the terms of 19th Century India\\". He aimed to form an Indian canton of art in the manner of those of the classic Greek and Roman civilisations. Varma's art came to play an important role in the development of the Indian national consciousness. Varma purchased a printing press which churned out oleograph copies of his paintings which graced the middle-class homes of India, many decades after he died. Considered a genius in his heydey, within a few years of his passing, Varma's paintings came under severe strictures for mimicking Western art. Raja Ravi Varma died in 1906 at the age of 58. He is considered among the greatest painters in the history of Indian art. The Bengal School During the colonial era, Western influences had started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes, Raja Ravi Varma being prominent among them. The Bengal school arose as an avant garde and nationalist movement reacting against the academic art styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Varma and in British art schools. Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the West, the British art teacher Ernest Binfield Havel attempted to reform the teaching methods at the Calcutta School of Art by encouraging students to imitate Mughal miniatures. This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havel was supported by the artist Abanindranath Tagore, a nephew of the poet Rabindranath Tagore. Abanindranath painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the \\"materialism\\" of the West. His best-known painting, Bharat Mata (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. The other prominent figures of the Bengal school of art were Gaganendranath Tagore, Abanindranath's elder brother, Jamini Roy, Mukul Dey, Manishi Dey and Ram Kinker Baij, who is more famous as the pioneer of Modern Indian Sculpture. Another important figure of this era was Chittaprosad Bhattacharya, who rejected the classicism of the Bengal School and its spiritual preoccupations.Manifestations II, Rabina Karode, Delhi Art Gallery 2004, His book Hungry Bengal : a tour through Midnapur District included many sketches of the Bengal Famine drawn from life, as well as documentation of the persons depicted. The book was immediately banned by the British and 5000 copies were seized and destroyed. Only one copy was hidden by Chittaprosad's family and is now in the possession of the Delhi Art Gallery. During the opening years of the 20th century, Abanindranath developed links with Japanese cultural figures such as the art historian Okakura Kakuzō and the painter Yokoyama Taikan as part of a globalised Modernist initiative with pan-Asian tendencies.Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard. Modernism and the Museum: Asian, African and Pacific Art and the London Avant Garde. Oxford University Press, 2011, passim. *Also see Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard. \\"The Transcultural Roots of Modernism: Imagist Poetry, Japanese Visual Culture, and the Western Museum System\\", Modernism/modernity Volume 18, Number 1, January 2011, 27–42. .Video of a Lecture discussing the global importance of the Calcutta-Tokyo art connection, London University School of Advanced Study, March 2012. Those associated with this Indo-Far Eastern model included Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee, Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, B.C. Sanyal, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha, and subsequently their students A. Ramachandran, Tan Yuan Chameli, and a few others. The Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of modernist ideas post-independence. Santiniketan The mantle of the Bengal School was taken up when Rabindranath Tagore established the visionary university of Santiniketan, a university focussed on the preservation and upliftment of Indian culture, values and heritage. It included an art school \\"Kala Bhavan\\" founded in 1920–21. Though Rabindranath himself came late to painting in his long, productive life, his ideas greatly influenced Indian modernism. In private, Tagore made small drawings, coloured with inks, for which he drew inspiration for his primitivism from his unconscious. In public life, Rabindranath's primitivism can be directly attributed to an anti- colonial resistance, akin to that of Mahatma Gandhi. One of the early students of Abanindranath Tagore was Nandalal Bose, who subsequently became a teacher and later the Director for art. Nandalal led the school to a position of pre- eminence in the nationalistic ideology now emerging in Indian culture. The Shantiniketan school of thought emphasised that \\"an aesthetic was also an ethos, that art’s role was more than life-enhancing, it was world-shaping\\". It established an Indian version of naturalism distinct from the oriental and western schools, one example being the eschewing of oil and easel painting for work on paper drawn/coloured using watercolours, wash, tempera and ink. Rabindranath Tagore's dream of veneration of old values, typified by motifs such as rural folk, especially Santhal tribals, came to fruition in the art- related schools of Viswa-Bharati University at Santiniketan. Some of the prominent artists of Santiniketan school are Benode Behari Mukherjee, Ramkinkar Baij, Manu Parekh, Sankho Chaudhuri, Dinkar Kaushik, K. G. Subramanyan, Beohar Rammanohar Sinha, Krishna Reddy, A. Ramachandran, Sobha Brahma, Ramananda Bandhapadhyay, Dharma Narayan Dasgupta, Sushen Ghose, Janak Jhankar Narzary . Contextual Modernism art historian R. Siva Kumar The idea of Contextual Modernism emerged in 1997 from R. Siva Kumar's Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism as a postcolonial critical tool in the understanding of an alternative modernism in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists. Several terms including Paul Gilroy’s counter culture of modernity and Tani Barlow's Colonial modernity have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that ‘Contextual Modernism’ is a more suited term because \\"the colonial in colonial modernity does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan’s artist teachers’ refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.\\"http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming- polarized-modernities.pdf According to R. Siva Kumar \\"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\\"http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the- lived-world-ii/ He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice. Contextual Modernism in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in Architecture.http://www.diva- portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711 Post-independence By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences. The Progressive Artists' Group, established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Its founder was Francis Newton Souza and S. H. Raza, M. F. Husain and Manishi Dey were early members. It was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all of the major artists of India in the 1950s were associated with the group. Prominent among them were Akbar Padamsee, Sadanand Bakre, Ram Kumar, Tyeb Mehta, K. H. Ara, H. A. Gade and Bal Chabda. In 1950, V. S. Gaitonde, Krishen Khanna and Mohan Samant joined the Group. The group disbanded in 1956. Pseudorealistic Indian painting.

Women artists like B. Prabha, Shanu Lahiri, Arpita Singh, Anjolie Ela Menon and Lalita Lajmi have made immense contributions to Modern Indian Art and Painting. Art historians like Prof. Rai Anand Krishna have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Some of the acclaimed contemporary Indian artists include Nagasamy Ramachandran, Jitish Kallat, Atul Dodiya and Geeta Vadhera who has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta. Indian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post liberalization Indian art works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it. Artists have introduced new concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. Devajyoti Ray has introduced a new genre of art called Pseudorealism. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil. Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into fantastic images. In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the abstract painter Natvar Bhavsar, abstract Art painter Nabakishore Chanda, and sculptor Anish Kapoor whose mammoth postminimalist artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks. Art scholars such as Vaibhav S. Adhav, C. Sivaramamurti, Anand Krishna, R . Siva Kumar and Geeta Kapur have taken Indian Art to a global platform.  Late 21st Century Painters (2013-2019)   2013  In the 21st century, Modern Indian paintings consisted of self reflection and of emerging issues in the country. One such artist that has had great influence is Bhupen Khakhar, and his style included, “producing colorful works with much humor, driven by strong narratives capturing a mixture of daily middle-class life and erotic fantasy.\\" In 2013, an exhibit named “Touched by Bhupen” displayed artworks from artists including: Subodh Gupta, Atul Dodiya, Ratheesh T, Nataraj Sharma, and Jogen Chowdhury, depicting Bhupen’s impact on their art. Also in 2013, an Indian Art Fair took place in which some Indian artists exhibited their art along with artists from all over the world. Some of the Indian artists who were involved included: SH Raza, Nilofer Suleman, Viveek Sharma, and Smriti Dixit. Each artist has its own style, Raza’s paintings contain Hindu thinking, and Suleman’s paintings are very modern and incorporate Indian graphic styles. Sharma’s paintings embody political statements, and Dixit’s paintings contain notions of reuse and rebirth.  2016  K. G. Subramanyan was known for his mixing of traditions. Specifically speaking, he brought together traditional contemporary Indian art with pop culture and traditional Indian folk art with modern, urban trends. By attending Santiniketan art school the founder of the school, Rabindranath Tagore wanted impose onto his pupils the idea of asserting Indian traditions with handicrafts. Subramanyan was able to take those teachings from Tagore and bring them to the future generation of artists whilst he himself was a teacher at Maharaja Sayajiaro University in Baroda.  2017-2019  Pradip Sengupta was named an emerging artist in 2017. He received his degree from Visva Bharati University in Santiniketan. His paintings combine a large variety of colors, mixed with different techniques. All of his paintings capture the change that he has gone through during his life; they represent the feelings that he has inside, yet his artwork seems to envision some sort of fantasy, even including some western figures like Superman. Sarang Singla was also recognized as an upcoming artist in 2017. Her style is a mix between contemporary art and traditional, Indian culture. She mixes textures and techniques to depict her inspirations that she gathers from what is happening in the world around her. Also among those listed as an emerging artist in 2017, Siddharth S. Shingade expresses his feeling though an interesting integration of detailed faces. He elongates the creatures in some and tries to tell stories about historical events. Where he calls home is in Marathwada, India. He often uses color palettes that represents this. There is a wide variety of yellow's that imitate the warm climate of Marathwada. The mood of his artwork tends to be more somber, really capturing the oppression that the people in his homeland faced. An upcoming artistic 2018, Bakula Nayak, uses mixed media painting to really express happiness. She tends to create work that is very light hearted and comical. Mostly influenced my Western art and imagination; she creates animal characters to participate in human activities. This creates a story-like environment. Dinkar Jadhav, also an upcoming artist in 2018, has a passion for love, passion, and freedom. He depicts this through his frequent paintings of bulls and horses. Creativity is key and he shows this incorporating different geometric shapes, color blocking, and sharp angles into his paintings. He is using modern art to depict some traditional values. In 2018, Roy K. John's art became some of the most popular of that year. He uses very traditional techniques, blended with contemporary styles to creates his interpretation of Hindu deities and traditional Indian iconography. He uses vibrant colors to show his love for nature and stays true to his roots by recreating some of the most traditional Indian art The year of 2019, Buddhadev Mukherjee from Kolata, India, started to be recognized for his unusual interest in separating human form from all other things. He is known to incorporate the main human figure into something with animal qualities. He mixes two unlike things to create one fluid paining.

Walther (born 1958) is the Mark and Susan Bertelsen Presidential Chair in Technology and Society and the Director of the Center for Information Technology & Society at the University of California, Santa Barbara. His research focuses on social and interpersonal dynamics of computer-mediated communication, in groups, personal relationships, organizational and educational settings. He is noted for creating social information processing theory in 1992 and the hyperpersonal model in 1996. Life and work Joseph B. Walther was born in 1958 in Santa Monica, Calif. Walther attended Sana Ana College, Saddleback College and spent time with the Royal Shakespeare Company at Coastline Community College before transferring to the University of Arizona and graduating magna cum laude in 1983. Walther continued at the University of Arizona, earning a master's degree in speech communication in 1984 and a doctorate in 1990. Walther has previously held appointments in Information Technology, Psychology, and Education and Social Policy at universities in the U.S. and the United Kingdom and was chair of the Organizational Communication and Information Systems division of the Academy of Management, and the Communication and Technology division of the International Communication Association. Based on his research into computer- mediated communication, Walther introduced social information processing theory in 1992. Social information processing theory finds that the development of relationships via computer-mediated communication depends on sufficient time and message exchanges, and on the application of available communicative cues by users. The lack of nonverbal cues means that computer- mediated communications contain less information than face-to-face communications, however social information processing theory finds that longer and/or more frequent communication as well as the use of other cues (i.e. spelling ability) while participating in computer-mediated communication help address the issue of information exchange. The social information perspective assumes that communicators in computer-mediated exchanges are similarly driven to acquire social information that will encourage the development of social relationships as are communicators using other media. Support for social information processing theory has been found in contexts such as online dating and online multi-player video games. Walther's research also led him to develop the hyperpersonal model of communication in 1996. Walther's work on the hyperpersonal model is his research that has been most cited by other researchers. The hyperpersonal model finds that in certain circumstances, computer-mediated communication surpasses the affection and emotion of similar situations of face-to-face interpersonal communication. This model also offers a robust view of computer-mediated communication, taking into account the contributions of the sender, receiver, channel and feedback in a computer- mediated interaction. The hyperpersonal model finds that two characteristics of computer-mediated communication – reduced communication cues and potentially asynchronous communication – facilitate both optimized self- presentation by message senders and idealized perceptions of the sender by message receivers. Walther's hyperpersonal model predicts that media classified as less rich by media richness theory or less natural by media naturalness theory allow more socially desirable levels of interaction than face-to-face communication.

The episode was written by Tim Minear and directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon. This episode is rated TV-MA (LV). The episode was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Miniseries or a Movie. In this episode, Vivien (Connie Britton) gives birth and Violet (Taissa Farmiga) learns that Tate (Evan Peters) is the biological father to one of her new siblings. Kate Mara and Zachary Quinto guest star as Hayden McClaine and Chad Warwick, respectively. Plot Tate cannot promise Vivien's baby to Nora, who Tate treats as his mother ever since she saved him from the Infantata and taught him how to make the ghosts leave him alone, for fear of revealing to Violet that he raped her mother, but Nora is resolved to take the child anyway. Ben picks up Vivien to take her from the ward to her flight to Florida, not understanding why Violet refuses to leave with him. The doctor tells Vivien and Ben that one of the twins is ready to be born imminently. In the house, Violet and Tate realize Chad and Patrick are planning to take the twins. Violet asks Constance for help, who confronts Chad and says he can have Ben's child, but her grandson is her own. Chad realizes that Tate fathered one of the twins. Constance and Violet enlist the help of Billie Dean, who teaches Violet a banishment spell. Violet tells Ben that she is dead and can't leave the house, and urges him to take Vivien away from the house and its ghosts before she gives birth, but Ben doesn't believe her. Meanwhile, Vivien goes into labor in the car and Constance appears, and takes her into the house. The power goes out and ghosts destroy the car, forcing Ben and Vivien to have the babies there. Dr. Charles Montgomery handles the delivery. Violet recites the banishment spell, but realizes it doesn't work. Chad tells her that Tate killed him and Patrick and also raped Vivien. Vivien gives birth, with the first twin being stillborn, and Dr. Montgomery hands it to Nora. Constance takes the second twin to wash it. Vivien begins to postpartum hemorrhage due to the larger child. Violet appears and urges her to let go and join her in the afterlife. Ben, unaware of Violet's presence, urges Vivien to live. Vivien dies and Ben finds himself alone. Violet confronts Tate, revealing that she knows everything he has done and she forces him to remember the school massacre. Then asks why he raped her mother. Tate pleas her for forgiveness, but Violet angrily banishes him by saying \\"Go away\\". As he leaves, Violet becomes devastated and heartbroken, but Vivien's ghost appears and comforts her daughter to calm down. Production Connie Britton knew from the beginning of her character's fate. The episode was written by consulting producer Tim Minear, while Alfonso Gomez-Rejon directed. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, series co-creator Ryan Murphy stated that he had told Connie Britton, early on, that her character Vivien would die this season. \\"We've really had the whole season mapped out from the beginning,\\" he said. \\"In the meetings with the core actors, the three leads being Connie, Dylan [McDermott] and Jessica [Lange], as we tried to snare them we were able to say this is where you start, this is the middle, and this is where you end up. So, yes, I was able to tell Connie really the whole run of the series.\\" Reception Rotten Tomatoes reports a 100% approval rating, based on 9 reviews. James Queally of The Star-Ledger commented about the episode, \\"For 10 episodes American Horror Story has ranged from ridiculous to ghoulish fun... but \\"Birth\\" is all execution, and quite frankly, that might be exactly what this show needs to be.\\" The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff stated, \\"In general, I thought \\"Birth\\" was basically fine, just my kind of genre hokum/guilty pleasure. But at the same time, it was just a touch too sedate.\\" In its original American broadcast, \\"Birth\\" was seen by an estimated 2.59 million household viewers and earned a 1.4 rating share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode was up in number of viewers but down in the age range from the previous episode.

She was elected to the Argentine Senate in 2009, and in 2011 became the first woman and first Jew to be designated as its Provisional President; the post put her second in Argentine line of succession, after Vice President Amado Boudou. Both Rojkés and her husband, José Alperovich, who has been governor of Tucumán since 2003, are considered leading “K” (or Kirchner) politicians who are “very close to the Casa Rosada.” Their lavish way of life has been severely criticized, as has the fact that several of their relatives have been given high-level government jobs. Both of them have been the subject of corruption allegations. Also, Rojkés has frequently made remarks that have been viewed in the media as insensitive to the poor and to crime victims. In 2015, she visited flood victims in the town of El Molino and made headlines when she called one of them a “lazy bum” and boasted of having ten mansions. Early life and education Beatriz Liliana Rojkés was born in San Miguel de Tucumán to Luisa Werblud and Salomón Rojkés, both Ashkenazi Jews who emigrated from Europe. Salomón Rojkés inaugurated a textile mill in the city, Textil Americana. She earned a degree in Psychopedagogy and married a fellow member of Tucumán's Jewish community, José Alperovich, with whom she had four children. Career She became a partner in her father-in-law's auto dealership, León Alperovich de Tucumán S.A., in 1997, and by 2010 controlled 98% of the firm (one of Tucumán's largest Ford and Volkswagen distributors). Following the election of her husband as Governor of Tucumán, she was elected in 2005 to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies on the Front for Victory ticket (the majority, center-left Justicialist Party faction then headed by President Néstor Kirchner). She introduced numerous bills advancing children's rights, women's rights and nutrition, among other issues. She was elected to the Senate in 2009. Her stake in the Rojkés and Alperovich family businesses made her the wealthiest woman in the Senate by 2010, and the fourth-wealthiest overall. She was named to the Senate committees on Constitutional Affairs, Labor, Health, Ombudsmanship, and Bermejo River works. Early in 2010, the opposition was able to transfer Rojkés de Alperovich's position on the Congressional Bicameral Committee to an opposition politician, Luis Juez. The government protested. On April 29, 2010, the Appeals Court confirmed Rojkés's reinstatement on the committee. She said that “We will be able to work normally from now on.” Rojkés was elected Provisional President of the Senate on November 30, 2011. Married to one of the few Jews in Argentina to be elected governor, she herself made history by becoming both the first Jew and the first woman to hold this key post. Rojkés promised the President her “loyalty.” In a radio interview, Rojkés de Alperovich said that she “fully supports the political system” of the Kirchner regime and that she was “proud” to have been selected for the position. The Provisional President of the Senate is second in the line of succession to the Presidency in Argentina. Speculation mounted in the days leading to the second inaugural of President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner that Senator Alperovich might be asked to administer the Oath of Office in lieu of Vice President Julio Cobos, who had been distanced from the rest of the administration since his surprise tie- breaking vote in 2008 against an export tax increase supported by the president. President Fernández de Kirchner ultimately opted to take the oath independently, as did Vice President Amado Boudou. In June 2013, Cristina Kirchner criticized opposition politicians for failing to come up with new ideas so as to make possible “a healthy democratic debate.” When she made the remarks, she was flanked by Alperovich and Rojkés, whom the Buenos Aires Herald described as “two staunch supporters of her administration.” In February 2014, it was announced that Rojkés de Alperovich would be replaced as provisional leader of the Senate by Zamora. Controversies At a public event in March 2006, Rojkés condemned the writer and journalist Tomás Eloy Martínez, calling him a former Tucumáno – effectively disowning him as a resident of the province – because he had published an article in La Nación about the high level of poverty in the province. She was criticized in November 2011 by a political opponent, Senator Jose Cano, for saying that there were no street urchins in the province of Tucumán. Cano said that her remark gave him the feeling that “she lives in another province.” Rojkés caused controversy in 2012 by commenting on the brutal murder of a six-year- old girl, Mercedes Figueroa, saying that her parents were “drunks” who had not cared for her properly and that as First Lady she could not associate herself with such people. She later apologized for the remarks. Marita Verón case The disappearance of a young woman named Marita Verón in Tucumán became a public issue and was held up as an example of the extent of human smuggling in the province. Suspects went on trial but were acquitted on December 12, 2012, in a verdict widely seen as exemplary of the corruption of courts in the province and the collusion of judges with gangsters. Rojkés said that she was “shocked” and “surprised” by the court's decision to free all of the defendants, but also, in what became a very controversial statement, added that prostitution and human trafficking “exists and will continue to exist.” El Molino incident In March 2015, Rojkés visited the southern town of El Molino, which had recently experienced serious flooding. In response to local residents who had been affected by the flooding and who were angry at delays in government assistance, she told them, “Don’t get angry, because you will make the whole world go crazy and you won’t solve anything.” She added, “We are listening, but it’s not my fault if the river floods.” This statement caused outrage among the locals, and led to a heated discussion. When one flood victim was particularly critical of the government's response and of her attitude, she responded dismissively. This led to a heated argument between the two in which she called the man a \\"bum\\" and he called her a \\"crook\\". During the argument she called out that she owned ten mansions. Her remarks were caught on video and quickly went viral. Rojkés later denied that she actually had ten houses. On March 23, 2015, she called the incident a set-up and said that she “fell for it in the worst way.” She added: “I reacted like an idiot” and attributed her reaction to “a mix of pain, impotence, of being unable to provide a solution. It made me lose my temper.” The flood victim told a television reporter “that he was only trying to get the provincial government to send machinery that could help prevent floods in the future.” Rojkés apologized for her remarks to the man, while Cabinet Chief Aníbal Fernández accused the man of provoking her. Radical Civic Union (UCR) gubernatorial candidate José Cano criticized Rojkés for her remarks in El Molino, saying “she belonged to a caste of political leaders who believe they are superior to everyday citizens” and noting that she had “a long history of outbursts.” For example, she had “drunkenly called the family of the assassinated girl (six-year-old Mercedes Figueroa), she threatened the doctors that protested in favour of higher salaries and questioned mothers that take drugs for not taking care of their children.” In a March 25, 2015, commentary headlined “Adding insult to injury,” the editors of the Buenos Aires Herald condemned Rojkés de Alperovich for the remarks she made to the flood victims. “Throwing in the face of somebody who has just lost his home her possession of 10 mansions (in any case a false claim, according to her) is so obviously wrong that it becomes hardly necessary to elaborate,” they stated. “This is not the first evidence of an authoritarian regime in the province governed by her husband for the last 12 years – remember that by far the bloodiest repression of the late 2013 looting occurred in Tucumán. The latest Rojkés gaffe thus largely serves to suggest that this is an authoritarian style where the sticks are much longer than the carrots.” In an April 2015 commentary for La Nación, Fernando Bracaccini and Renzo Lavin suggested that the incident in El Molino underscored the lack of accountability for public officials under the Kirchner regime. They noted that Rojkés had not made public any information about her income or fortune since 2009, and that there was no way to know how many houses she owned. A 2013 federal law, they explained, enabled public officials to avoid disclosing their private financial or property information by putting it in the names of their spouses or children, and under provincial legislation her husband, even though serving as governor of Tucumán, was not required to disclose such data. Alleged Nepotism A July 2012 article in La Nación held up the province of Tucumán, and particularly the relatives of Rojkés and Alperovich, as “a crude example” of nepotism in government and the enrichment of Kirchner-connected families with government funds. At the time the article was published, Rojkés's sister Silvia Rojkés Temkin was the provincial Minister of Education, her brother Carlos Rojkés was an officer in the national Senate, her niece Veronica Rojkés was a member of the National Congress, and her brother was a supplier to the province of Tucumán state. Also, Paul Zeitume, Alperovich's son, was Director of Commerce for Tucumán province; Isaac Bromberg, an Alperovich cousin, was a national deputy; another cousin, Beatriz Mirkin, was a former Minister of Social Development and a current national deputy; Oscar Mirkin, yet another cousin, was Secretary of Public Works in Tucumán; and Lucia Temkin, niece of Alperovich's private secretary, was provisional president of the national Senate. Corruption allegations In November 2014, Rojkés was criticized by opposition leaders for claiming that there had been “no corruption” in Tucumán during her husband's term as governor. Opposition politician Manuel Avellaneda said that she must have a “very poor memory,” given the number of allegations of corruption that had been made against her husband, his efforts to control the judiciary, and his refusal to take action for greater transparency. Avellaneda said that according to Enrique Romero, Alperovich's administration is the “most corrupt in history.” Avellaneda stated that “as in dictatorships, corruption is the soul of the government of her husband, which is the most corrupt in the democratic history of Tucumán.”  References  Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine Jews Category:People from San Miguel de Tucumán Category:Argentine businesspeople Category:Jewish Argentine politicians Category:Justicialist Party politicians Category:Members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies Category:Members of the Argentine Senate Category:Women members of the Argentine Senate Category:Argentine women in business Category:Women members of the Argentine Chamber of Deputies ","title":"Beatriz Rojkés de Alperovich"},{"id":"34037508","text":"Propionibacterineae is an Actinomycete suborder with two families and numerous genera.

She finds herself in Bardo, a Tibetan Buddhist netherworld and the place where you wait to be reincarnated. She is not enthusiastic. All she's interested in is dying again, and as soon as possible. But her perky Indian spirit guide Maryamma insists that she go back to earth, again and again, and it is all for her own good. She is persistently pessimistic and cranky and the other spirits dub her Miss Witherspoon—the kind of name you'd associate with a grumpy old English lady in an Agatha Christie novel.

Critical reception Ben Brantley, in his review of the 2005 production for the New York Times, wrote: \\"As it pursues the afterlife and later lives of its title character, \\"Miss Witherspoon\\" retreads territory that Mr. Durang has charted more sharply before, from family pathology (\\"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\\") to theological perversity (\\"Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You\\"). This meandering sweep dilutes impact,....aside from a gorgeously realized opening scene that establishes its heroine's particularly obdurate form of depression....the play feels, well, earthbound in its familiar sendups of the nastiness of earthly life.... Ms. Nielsen's eyes go wide at such moments and her voice becomes a wounded bleat. That the same genuine pain underlines Mr. Durang's habitual archness is what makes him, even when he's not in top form, such an essential and affecting presence in the American theater.\\" The CurtainUp reviewer of the 2005 production wrote: \\" 'Miss Witherspoon' is part fable, part stand-up comedy, part farce. It's a fable that puts a hopeful spin on the modern world's man-made and natural horrors, stand-up comedy that's roll-over with laughter funny -- and even at its most whacky and farcical, it's never witless. Despite some lapses into somewhat preachy and facile interchanges, it all adds up to a timely, stimulating, colorfully staged -- and, yes, hopeful -- ninety minutes. If you'll forgive the indulgence in word play, it's a tour- de-farce elevated to heavenly heights by tour-de-farceur Kristine Nielsen.\\"Sommer, Elyse. \\"A CurtainUp Review 'Miss Witherspoon' curtainup.com, November 26, 2005 References External links * Miss Witherspoon at the Internet off-Broadway Database Category:Plays by Christopher Durang Category:2005 plays ","title":"Miss Witherspoon"},{"id":"34037600","text":"Andrew or Andy Love may refer to: * Andrew Love (musician) (1941–2012), American saxophone player * Andy Love (jazz vocalist) (né Andrew Jackson Love; 1911–1982), jazz vocalist with the Tune Twisters * Andy Love (singer) (active 1998–2000), British singer (Northern Line) * Andrew C.

It was selected as the Mexican entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 47th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Background The film is based on the titular character from the famous Mexican comic book Los Supermachos created and drawn by Mexican cartoonist Rius, who co-wrote the screenplay.Calzónzin Inspector at IMDB.com \\"Cazonci\\" or \\"Caltzontzin\\" was the term used in the Purépecha culture, to name their emperors. The film, which is influenced by Nikolai Gogol's The Government Inspector, centers around two poor Mexicans who are mistaken for government inspectors from Mexico City by the corrupt mayor of a small town. It is a humorous political critique, aimed squarely at the then ruling party Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) and its paramilitary caciques, at a time when freedom of speech in politics was highly restricted. There are at least two versions of the film, with one having some scenes deleted by State censors, the most notable of which depicts the killing of a renegade farmer by a police officer, who shoots the farmer in the back. Plot When the mayor of a fictional town in rural Mexico learns that an incognito inspector is sent by the Government to supervise him, he tries in all the ways to intercept him in order to avoid him discovering his corrupt ways. Almost at the same time a poor Mexican guy, called Caltzontzin that looks like a beggar with a Mexican sarape, arrives to town and soon is confused with the aforementioned inspector. Then the Mayor does all he can to try to show Caltzontzin that the town is running fine, since closing the local bar and putting in jail all his patrons, and using them for different purposes (like showing them in jail, then to play a soccer game in the local park and to even as bed them as the sick people in a hospital), making the students of a closed school to go back to attend classes, make a goofy representation of Adam and Eve in Paradise and making them to sing in front of the Inspector, through this backfires to the wife of the Mayor when she realizes that the pianist of the cantina made the children to sing \\"Aventurera\\" (a bolero song written by Agustin Lara about a prostitute). Soon, the other inhabitants of the town do whatever they can to get the attention of Caltzontzin as long as they demand some help from him to put down the Mayor, making a colorful parade in front of his hotel and giving him some letters that probes the Major's corruption. Caltzontzin and his friend Chon confides to send the information to a reporter for a diary only to have his letter intercepted by the people from the Mail Office (concerned that this letter would go to the Governor) and soon the Major discovers Caltzontzin's true identity. Caltzontzin is condemned to be tied and left to be killed by a bull during the town's bulls parade. However Chon manages to free him and using bullfighting tools manages to make a goofy but effective bullfighting game to keep them alive, until, when trying to kill the bull with the estoque they unexpectedly touch a dynamite detonator left my the Major oppositors making the arena to blow in pieces, while Caltzontzin leaves the town literally flying, the real Inspector arrives to town to encounter a dismayed and shocked Mayor, along with his people, pledging for help.

David Ebersole. The film details the life and near death story of Patty Schemel, drummer of the seminal '90s alternative rock band Hole, and charts her early life, music career, and spiral into crack cocaine addiction. The film weaves together Hi8 video footage Schemel recorded while on Hole's 1994-95 world tour with contemporary interviews with her, bandmates Courtney Love, Eric Erlandson, and Melissa Auf der Maur, as well as her family members. The film also features interviews with other female drummers and musicians, including Nina Gordon, Kate Schellenbach, Gina Schock, Debbi Peterson, and Phranc. The film's score is written by Roddy Bottum of Faith No More. It was produced by Todd Hughes and Christina Soletti and was released theatrically in North America in 2012 by Well Go USA via Variance Films. It also screened a series of film festivals, including South by Southwest, the Marché du Film at Cannes, the Seattle Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, The Portland Queer Documentary Film Festival, and Outfest. The title is a reference to a song on Hole's 1998 album Celebrity Skin. Background Hit So Hard was conceived after Schemel discovered a cache of Hi8 video footage which she had recorded herself during her world tour with Hole promoting their second album, Live Through This (1994). In the process of digitizing the footage to preserve it from deterioration, Schemel and Ebersole sought to utilize the footage in order to tell Schemel's story. Synopsis The film begins with discussion amidst Hole's 1994 and 1995 world tour, then works backwards to Schemel's childhood growing up in Marysville, Washington, and details her coming out to her family as a lesbian, as well as her immersion in Seattle's music scenes, where she would eventually cross paths with Kurt Cobain. Through contemporary interviews with Schemel's bandmates Courtney Love, Eric Erlandson, and Melissa Auf der Maur, her beginnings in Hole are detailed, including her audition with Love and Erlandson in Los Angeles amidst the Rodney King riots, as well as her time living with Love and husband Kurt Cobain, and the songwriting process between Love, Schemel, and Erlandson. Additional commentary from fellow female drummers, musicians, peers, and friends of Schemel's are provided throughout. After the death of Hole's bassist Kristen Pfaff in 1994 (only two months after the death of Kurt Cobain), the band embarked on a world tour with Auf der Maur as Pfaff's replacement, and Schemel, along with Love, began heavily using heroin. Schemel's drug use leads to a breakup with her girlfriend, who acted as Love's personal assistant on the tour, and Schemel reflects on her time in a rehabilitation facility she checked into with Love after the conclusion of the tour in 1995. In 1998, the band enters the studio to record their third album, Celebrity Skin, where Schemel is eventually replaced by a session drummer at the suggestion of the record's producer, Michael Beinhorn, who had been given authorization by the rest of the band after providing them with studio loops of Schemel's weaker drum tracks. This leads to a rift between Schemel and the band, and her eventual resignation. After leaving Hole, Schemel becomes addicted to crack-cocaine and ends up living on the streets in Los Angeles for two years, only occasionally maintaining contact with Love. The film then charts Schemel's recovery from her addiction, mending with the band, her marriage to wife Christina Soletti, and her newfound passion for animals, opening her own animal boarding and dog walking business. The film concludes with Schemel teaching drum lessons in her spare time.

Postmodern branding is more about understanding and leveraging technology, space and mindset of the moment to create an enriched user experience. Idris Mootee cites in, “Branding in the Post-Modern Culture When Consumer Transcends the State of Being the Subject in a Society” that brands are becoming more and more important in this day of age. When looking at how the media ecosystem has evolved with the developments of Twitter, Facebook, mobile codes and video, a marketer can see that the brand “exists beyond the ads and the products”. As a result, brands have found new ways to enter the home and places in the consumers life. This newly developed entryway and space usually takes the form of branded content, branded entertainment, branded utilities, and most importantly brand personification (which occurs when the brand is treated and engaged with as one would engage with a physical person. i.e. make appointments with, talk to, touching, etc.). These are behaviors predominantly found in the daily life of the postmodern consumer. Watching scheduled TV programs, utilizing and interacting with voice recognition services like Siri are examples of how branded content and utilities are becoming more predominate within our current culture. Although some examples are eroding away like scheduled TV viewing (according to JD Power and Associates roughly 45% of cable TV service customer have a DVR subscription, which is up from 38% in 2010), others are introduces with remarkable interfaces and user engagement protocols. Mobile applications like Siri allow users interact with their phone at treat it like a personal assistant. Successful branding within the postmodern society rely more on the developments of brand personality. Developing brand personality sets the stage in identifying deeper meaning around “How it, the brand, works.” The formation of studying and defining a brand in this manner hinges on the trait theory of psychology. According to this theory, inherent traits (habitual patterns, thoughts and emotions) are perceived to remain relatively stable over time.Saul Kassin, (2003). Psychology. USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc. Holding inherent traits constant while manipulating environmental cues and situational stimuli, natural personalities emerge. When applied to marketing, this process is called a brand-trait observational research study. By performing such studies a brand is able to extract “marketable” personalities; thus creating “livable brand personas”. These personas are then used to help brands live better and more fluently within social destinations, communities and strategist around technical road maps, developments and customer interactions.

He is particularly experienced in environmental protection and historic preservation. Nugent is best known for having been Executive Director of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW). He was the first to hold that position and was in office when the organization was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Background Conn Nugent was born in Dublin, Ireland of Irish-American parents: James P. Nugent, a civil engineer, and Polly O'Donnell, a fashion model. Nugent's paternal grandfather, James J. Nugent, worked as a labor-union organizer and Tammany politician. His maternal grandfather was a coal industry lobbyist in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Nugent and his four siblings were raised in Larchmont, New York. He graduated with honors from Harvard College and Harvard Law School. In between, Nugent served two years with the Peace Corps in Costa Rica. His appointment in 1977 as executive director of the VingoTrust - a family foundation endowed by Boston investor WIlliam Appleton Coolidge - marked the first step in what was to become a back-and-forth pattern of running both foundations and the non-profits that rely on them. Non-Profit Consulting & Management Nugent has served as executive director of a variety of non-profits: they include New Alchemy Institute (solar energy); International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW); Five Colleges, Inc. (curriculum development and retiree education); Liberty Tree Alliance; Citizens Union of the City of New York (monitoring municipal government); and the Heinz Center for Science, Economics and the Environment (carbon pricing and federal tax policy). On the philanthropy side, Nugent was the Founding Environmental Program Director at the Nathan Cummings Foundation (1990-1995), and served as Executive Director of the JM Kaplan Fund (2000-2012). His Cummings portfolio concentrated on carbon-intensiveness in US transportation and agriculture. At JM Kaplan he developed a program that concentrated on North American cross-border ecosystems (grasslands in New Mexico and Chihuahua; hunting waters off Alaska and Yukon; fish larvae migration pathways in US, Mexican, and Cuban waters). The cross-border emphasis also informed Kaplan's Historic Preservation Program (prairie churches in North Dakota and Saskatchewan; cliff dwellings in Arizona and Sonora; Art Deco buildings in Miami and Havana). Nugent has been a Member of the Board of Directors of The Land Institute (Salina, Kansas) for 24 years. He served as Chairman for eight years. He was also a Board Member of the Association of Massachusetts Grantmakers, the Environmental Grantmakers Association and the Biodiversity Funders Group, and a Senior Fellow at the Ocean Foundation. In 2015, Nugent was asked by The Pew Charitable Trusts to a) assess the possible environmental consequences of mining the ocean seabed; and b) consider the advisability of a new Pew program on the subject. His reports informed the decision of the Pew Board to establish that program and set as its objective the first-in-history approval of an environmental protection rulebook to govern an industry before it begins. Nugent then agreed to become the first director of the Pew Seabed Project and remained at its head for four years. Writing & Editing Most of Nugent's writing output has taken the form of private reports on philanthropic initiatives, usually on environment and historic preservation. Beginning with his tenure as Narthex of the Harvard Lampoon, he has also kept up a side career writing for newspapers and magazines. Nugent was a frequent contributor to Stewart Brand's CoEvolution Quarterly, and designed and guest-edited that journal's “When Things Go Wrong” issue. His articles have appeared in the Boston Globe, Los Angeles Times, Newsday, and the New England Monthly. Nugent devised and managed two award- winning websites of the 1990s: Liberty Tree Alliance (environmental news) and The Gotham Gazette (New York City politics). In 2003 Nugent and DJ LaChapelle produced one of the first wildfire crazes of the Internet: WeLoveTheIraqiInformationMinister.com, a site that showcased the hapless spokesman as a hero of French deconstructionists and Hollywood press agents.

As the Director of Operations, he opened the Liberia Office and managed operations as part of the UN Secretary General's Ebola Emergency Response Mission (UNMEER), and was the UNWFP Emergency Co-ordinator for the 2015 Nepal earthquake response. He's spent time in the private sector as the Senior Director with Vulcan, Microsoft Co-Founder Paul Allen's company. Also with the UN World Food Programme he has served as the (WFP) Representative to Bangladesh, Tanzania, Nepal, North Korea, Zambia, and worked on emergencies in East Timor, Kosovo and China. He also re-opened WFP's office in Libya after it was evacuated in 2014. Ragan appears regularly in both international and national media, and is listed in the book, Mississippians, which features famous people from the state of Mississippi. Biography Early career Ragan served as a US Peace Corps Volunteer in the Sierra Madre Mountains of the Philippines. Working as an agriculture extensionist, he lived with Ilongots in Quirino Province. The Ilongots are considered the Philippines’ last ritual head-hunters and were the subjects of Dr. Michelle Rosaldo's book, Knowledge and Passion: Ilongot Notions of Self and Social Life. Living among the semi-nomadic Ilongots, Ragan worked on agriculture and land reform issues. Following his Peace Corps experience, Ragan worked for the US House of Representatives Veterans Affairs Committee and as a Defense and Foreign Policy Aide for Congressman Les Aspin from Wisconsin. Clinton administration Ragan held a number of jobs in the Clinton Administration; as an official in the Secretary of Defense's office, as a Director on the National Security Council, and as a Deputy Assistant Administrator in the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Serving in The Pentagon, he led the team that designed the Humanitarian Daily Ration (HDR), a culturally appropriate, air-droppable, ready-to-eat ration that was first used in airdrops over Bosnia and is often provided by the US military in humanitarian crisis. In 1996, as the Director of Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs on President Clinton's national security team, he was the first White House official to visit North Korea. As the Deputy Assistant Administrator in the Bureau of Humanitarian Response (BHR), he was in charge of the Government's food and humanitarian aid programs. United Nations Ragan first joined the UN in 1998 as the WFP Deputy Representative to China. During that time, he managed WFP's response to the 1998 Yangtze River floods while also serving in Kosovo and East Timor, during the period both countries faced conflict. In 2001, Ragan joined the UN full-time serving as WFP's Representative to Zambia. During the Southern African drought of 2002-2003, he faced the difficult challenge of turning back thousands of tons of genetically modified food aid in the face of 3.5 million starving people. Ragan then took over WFP's operation in North Korea (2003). His wife and young daughter accompanied him and are the only American family to have ever been allowed to officially reside in the country. During that time Ragan ran one of the largest operations in WFP's history, feeding 6.5 million people out of a population of 22 million. He also served as the acting Humanitarian Coordinator (HC), and was the last HC to serve in North Korea. The UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs was asked to leave North Korea in 2005. In Nepal, during his four-year tenure, Ragan expanded WFP's annual program from US$25 million to US$125 million to address the “silent food crises” that gripped the country. In 2014, Ragan served as the Head of Operations in Liberia for UNMEER and helped manage the UN's response in that country at the height of West Africa's Ebola crisis. Having managed large-scale operations, one of his key professional interests is to bring innovation in large organizations. Personal Ragan is married to Marcela Sandoval, also a former Clinton Administration official, and Le Cordon Bleu trained chef, who has worked at Kinkead's in Washington DC and The Courtyard Restaurant in Beijing China, among other places. They have three children. His Uncle Lattie Michael founded the fast food chain Backyard Burgers. Ragan graduated from SIT in Brattleboro, Vermont with an MA in International Development, and from Ole Miss with a BS in Business. With a personal interest in exploration, he provided sponsorship and support to the historic 2008 all Nepali female expedition to Mount Everest. The team, considered the most successful female expedition on the mountain, put all 10 members on the summit. He has also climbed with Russell Brice, and snowboarded with Craig Calonica on some of the world's highest peaks. In 2008, he narrowly escaped an avalanche on Annapurna South. He is an avid surfer regularly riding surf breaks in the Indian Ocean, off Africa's East Coast. He writes a monthly newspaper column in The Cleveland Current about the humorous side of living abroad with his family. Ragan collaborated with photographer and Kathmandu based art dealer James Giambrone to produce a photography book The Life of Food in Nepal which features images and stories about the life, the land, and the ritual of Nepal's food. Collaborating with Kiran Joshi of Incessant Rain they produced Nepal's first 3-D animation short. Ragan served on the Board for the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) for over a decade. Working again with Giambrone, he produced the documentary \\"Holding up the Sky\\" which tells the personal stories of 10 women climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. Cameo Ragan appeared in the Bangladesh's first film on surfing, titled \\"Dare To Surf\\" (original title No Dorai). In the movie, he is an enthusiast traveler who discovers the sport on Cox's Bazar beach and asks the protagonist to teach him the technique. Beside showing the beauties of Bangladesh, the movie denounces the condition of girls and women in the country.

Like other planktonic foraminifera, G. bulloides carbonate tests found in marine sediments obtained from ocean cores can be used to reconstruct climatic histories, and to align marine sediment cores with one another or with astronomical cycles. In this vein, oxygen isotopic analyses of these forams from drill cores in the North Atlantic have helped precisely date the timing of the onset of northern hemisphere glaciations in the late Pliocene, 2.5–3 million years ago.Bartioli, G., Sarnthein, M., Weinelt, M., Erlenkeuser, H., Garbe-Scheonberg, D. and D.

Adams and later Henry Blacklock, both of London. They are named after founder George Bradshaw, who produced his first timetable in October 1839. Although Bradshaw died in 1853, the range of titles bearing his name (and commonly referred to by that alone) continued to expand for the remainder of the 19th and early part of the 20th century, covering at various times Continental Europe, India, Australia and New Zealand, as well as parts of the Middle-East. They survived until May 1961, when the final monthly edition of the British guide was produced. The British and Continental guides were referred to extensively by presenter Michael Portillo in the BBC TV series Great British Railway Journeys, Great Continental Railway Journeys, Great American Railroad Journeys, Great Indian Railway Journeys, Great Alaskan Railroad Journeys, Great Canadian Railway Journeys, Great Australian Railway Journeys and Great Asian Railway Journeys. Early history Bradshaw's name was already known as the publisher of Bradshaw's Maps of Inland Navigation, which detailed the canals of Lancashire and Yorkshire, when, on 19 October 1839, soon after the introduction of railways, his Manchester company published the world's first compilation of railway timetables. The cloth-bound book was entitled Bradshaw's Railway Time Tables and Assistant to Railway Travelling and cost sixpence (p). In 1840 the title was changed to Bradshaw's Railway Companion, and the price raised to one shilling. A new volume was issued at occasional intervals and from time to time a supplement kept this up to date. The original Bradshaw publications were published before the limited introduction of standardised Railway time in November 1840, and its subsequent development into standard time. The accompanying map of all lines in operation (and some \\"in progress\\") in England and Wales, is cited as being the world's first national railway map.http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/great-railway-maps- of-the-world/9780241954089/ Page 6 In December 1841, acting on a suggestion made by his London agent, William Jones Adams, Bradshaw reduced the price to the original sixpence, and began to issue the guides monthly under the title Bradshaw's Monthly Railway Guide. Many railway companies were unhappy with Bradshaw's timetable, but Bradshaw was able to circumvent this by becoming a railway shareholder and by putting his case at company AGMs. Soon the book, in the familiar yellow wrapper, became synonymous with its publisher: for Victorians and Edwardians alike, a railway timetable was \\"a Bradshaw\\", no matter by which railway company it had been issued, or whether Bradshaw had been responsible for its production or not. Timetable from the 1850 Bradshaw The eight-page edition of 1841 had grown to 32 pages by 1845 and to 946 pages by 1898 and now included maps, illustrations and descriptions of the main features and historic buildings of the towns served by the railways. In April 1845, the issue number jumped from 40 to 141: the publisher claimed this was an innocent mistake, although it has been speculated as a commercial ploy, where more advertising revenue could be generated by making it look longer- established than it really was. Whatever the reason for the change, the numbering continued from 141. When in 1865 Punch praised Bradshaw's publications, it stated that \\"seldom has the gigantic intellect of man been employed upon a work of greater utility.\\" At last, some order had been imposed on the chaos that had been created by some 150 rail companies whose tracks criss-crossed the country and whose largely uncoordinated network was rapidly expanding. Bradshaw minutely recorded all changes and became the standard manual for rail travel well into the 20th century. By 1918 Bradshaw's guide had risen in price to two shillings (10p) and by 1937 to half a crown (12½p). Although historic money values are difficult to calculate, this would have been equivalent to perhaps £6.00 at 2009 values. Later history Bradshaw's timetables became less necessary from 1923, when more than 100 surviving companies were \\"grouped\\" into the Big Four. This change reduced dramatically the range and number of individual timetables produced by the companies themselves. They now published a much smaller number of substantial compilations which between them covered the country. Between 1923 and 1939 three of the Big Four transferred their timetable production to Bradshaw's publisher Henry Blacklock & Co., and most of the official company timetables therefore became reprints of the relevant pages from Bradshaw. Only the Great Western Railway retained its own format. Between the two world wars, the verb 'to Bradshaw' was a derogatory term used in the Royal Air Force to refer to pilots who could not navigate well, perhaps related to a perceived lack of ability shown by those who navigated by following railway lines. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, five of the six British Railways Regions followed the companies' example by using Blacklock to produce their timetable books, but production was eventually moved to other publishers. This change must have reduced Blacklock's revenue substantially. Parts of Bradshaw's guide began to be reset in the newer British Railways style from 1955, but modernisation of the whole volume was never completed. By 1961 Bradshaw cost 12s 6d (62½p), and a complete set of BR Regional timetables could be bought for 6s (30p). The conclusion was inevitable, and the last edition, No. 1521, was dated May 1961. The Railway Magazine of that month printed a valedictory article by Charles E. Lee. Reprints of various Bradshaw's guides have been produced. References in literature 19th-century and early 20th-century novelists make frequent references to a character's \\"Bradshaw\\". Dickens refers it in his short story The Portrait-Painter's Story (1861). In Around the World in 80 Days, Phileas Fogg carries a Bradshaw. In W. Somerset Maugham's \\"The Book Bag\\" the narrator states \\"I would sooner read the catalogue of the Army and Navy Stores or Bradshaw's Guide than nothing at all, and indeed have spent many delightful hours over both these works\\" Crime writers were fascinated with trains and timetables, especially as a new source of alibis. Examples are Ronald Knox's The Footsteps at the Lock (1928) and novels by Freeman Wills Crofts. One mention is by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in the Sherlock Holmes story The Valley of Fear: \\"the vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous and terse, but limited.\\" Other references include another Sherlock Holmes story, \\"The Adventure of the Copper Beeches\\"; Lewis Carroll's long poem Phantasmagoria; and Bram Stoker's Dracula, which makes note of Count Dracula reading an \\"English Bradshaw's Guide\\" as part of his planning for his voyage to England. In the 1866 comic opera Cox and Box, the following exchange takes place: :BOX: Have you read this month's Bradshaw, sir? :COX: No, sir. My wife wouldn’t let me.Burnand, F. C. Cox and Box, 1866, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012 There is also a reference in Death in the Clouds (1935) by Agatha Christie: \\"Mr Clancy, writer of detective stories ... extracted a Continental Bradshaw from his raincoat pocket ... to work out a complicated alibi.\\" Bradshaw is also mentioned in her The Secret Adversary. In Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca (1938), the second Mrs de Winter observes that \\"Some people have a vice of reading Bradshaws. They plan innumerable journeys across country for the fun of linking up impossible connections.\\" (chapter 2). Another reference is in an aside in Riddle of the Sands (1903) by Erskine Childers: \\"... an extraordinary book, Bradshaw, turned to from habit, even when least wanted, as men fondle guns and rods in the close season.\\" In G. K. Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday, the protagonist Gabriel Syme praises Bradshaw as a poet of order: \\"No, take your books of mere poetry and prose; let me read a time table, with tears of pride. Take your Byron, who commemorates the defeats of man; give me Bradshaw, who commemorates his victories. Give me Bradshaw, I say!\\" In Max Beerbohm's Zuleika Dobson (1911), a satirical fantasy of Oxford undergraduates, a Bradshaw is listed as one of the two books in the \\"library\\" of the irresistible Zuleika. Anthony Trollope refers to Bradshaw's in Barchester Towers and The Warden. Bradshaw is mentioned in modern novels with a period setting, and in Philip Pullman's The Shadow in the North (Sally Lockhart Quartet). In Jerome K. Jerome's 1891 novel Diary of a Pilgrimage, an aside called A Faithful Bradshaw is contained. This section describes a comical incident where the author gets always misled by referring to outdated guides. Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide In June 1847 the first number of Bradshaw's Continental Railway Guide was issued, giving the timetables of the Continental railways. It grew to over 1,000 pages, including timetables, guidebook and hotel directory. It was discontinued in 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War. Briefly resurrected in the interwar years, it saw its final edition in 1939. The 1913 edition was republished in September 2012. A travel documentary series named Great Continental Railway Journeys has been made based on the 1913 edition. Bradshaw's and other printed timetables today In December 2007, Middleton Press took advantage of Network Rail's willingness to grant third-party publishers the right to print paper versions of the National Rail timetable. Network Rail had discontinued official hard copies in favour of PDF editions, which could be downloaded free of charge. As a tribute to Bradshaw, Middleton Press named its timetables the Bradshaw-Mitchell's Rail Times. A competing edition reproduced from Network Rail's artwork, is published by TSO, This is a same-size reproduction of the Network Rail artwork, although the size is only about 70% in the Middleton Press versions to reduce the page count.

Takes place in New York City during the mid-1950s, the musical based on West Side Story explores the rivalry between the two gangs Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different cultural backgrounds (Deaf and Hearing). The members of the Sharks from Puerto Rico are taunted by the Jets, a white working-class group. The young protagonist, Tony, one of the Jets, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks. The theme, music, and dances focus on culture problems. Background The American musical West Side Story has been staged many times. However, a Deaf school in Jacksonville and MacMurray College in Illinois remade the musical into Deaf Side Story. Diane Brewer, drama instructor was determined to put on a performance by having deaf students and hearing students perform the well-known musical West Side Story. The musical is a rivalry between Sharks and Jets, two teenage gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. Members of the Sharks gang are from Puerto Rico and the members of the Jets are white working class group. Just like the storyline of Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare’s Maria, sister of Bernando leader of the Sharks, falls in love with Tony member of the Jets, which was not accepted by either gang. Deaf Side Story portrays similarities from West Side Story, however in this storyline two different cultures are shown, Deaf culture and the hearing world. Concept Brewer went to the Illinois School for the Deaf to cast the Sharks. Hearing college performers at MacMurray auditioned to be the Jets. Once Diane Brewer had cast her hearing Tony and deaf Maria, came the challenging part of teaching her whole cast to not only sing but learn to sign, and dance all the songs the famous musical is known for. The idea seemed so simple at first. Brewer thought the language of American Sign Language should be onstage, not off. She then found Christopher Smith, a deaf choreographer from Chicago, who was more than happy to help with the musical. With great support and assistance, they were ready to start the show. Deaf Side Story also showed Smith’s talents. It demonstrated that deaf performers could accomplish expectations of those who think they lack a sense of musicality. Brewer and Smith continued to explore the nature of their deaf and hearing collaboration as well as the intercultural connections between the Deaf and hearing communities. Deaf Side Story gave Brewer the opportunity to tell a story about two people who fall in love across a cultural-linguistic barrier. Language divided the Jets and the Sharks but brought Tony and Maria together as they began to use the same language. Deaf Side Story Deaf Sharks, Hearing Jets and a Classic American Musical Deaf Side Story Deaf Sharks, Hearing Jets and a Classic American Musical by Mark Rigney, nominated for a Pushcart Prize, portrays the progress of the production of the musical. Rigney included everything from the production, including all the frustrations and achievements, and the problems between the deaf and hearing cast members. He followed the production and kept records on what was happening on specific days and times, and on each cast member. He described challenges with interpreters and with ensuring that deaf and hearing audience would be able to understand both sides. He then covers successful production of Deaf Side Story showing individuals from many cultures and how they cooperated to perform a classic American musical. Rigney titles each chapter from the hit songs in the original West Side Story. He describes the problems having to get hearing members of the audience to understand the Sharks’ signing in their scenes. Rigney follows Brewer on how it all started and the challenges they all faced.

Her photographs cover the early days of diverse women's and LGBT social movements, as well as the Civil Rights, Peace, and farmworkers' rights movements.  Early life  Born in 1938, Davies was raised in Maine, the Catskills region of New York State, New York City, and Boston. Her grandparents were union organizers and Debs socialists — Davies credits her family background with influencing her later activist work. Davies left high school at 16 and worked as a waitress and dishwasher while pursuing a musical career.  Career  In the 1960s, Davies became involved in photography during her work with theatre and music, and began her work using equipment purchased at a yard sale. She taught herself how to develop and print her own photos, and began her photography work shooting behind-the-scenes images at theaters. Davies began working with Agnes \\"Sis\\" Cunningham and Gordon Friesen, editors of Broadside magazine. Through her contact with them (and based on her family background), she developed an interest in human rights work. Davies photographed numerous pivotal moments in music and social justice movements throughout the 1960s and 1970s, including the Poor People's March on Washington, Newport Folk Festival, and the Philadelphia Folk Festival. She photographed the Smithsonian Folklife Festival during its early years. In addition to her work in the United States, she has photographed Central America, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. From the 1960s through the 1980s, her work appeared in such publications as Life, The New York Times, and The Boston Globe. Davies aligned herself with the Gay Liberation Front and contributed images to Come Out!, a magazine published by the GLF. She documented the first [Pride Parade] in New York City on 28 June 1970. In the 1990s, she shifted her focus to illustration, painting and graphic art and largely ceased working as a photographer. Davies writes plays with social justice themes, having throughout her life participated in and supported all aspects of \\"people's theatre.\\" As of 2018, Davies was living in Northampton, Massachusetts. She continues to perform in musical groups — including as percussionist for the group Flame n Peach and the Liberated Waffles.  Collections  Davies' work is housed in the Ralph Rinzler Folklife Archives and Collections located in the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage, the New York Public Library, Howard University, the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College, and the Swarthmore College Peace Collection.

History Hemba carved stool The Hemba language belongs to a group of related languages spoken by people in a belt that runs from southern Kasai to northeastern Zambia. Other peoples speaking related languages include the Luba of Kasai and Shaba, the Kanyok, Songye, Kaonde, Sanga, Bemba and the people of Kazembe. Today the Hemba people live in the north of Zambia, and their language is understood throughout Zambia. Some also live in Tanzania. They live west of Lake Tanganyika and Lake Mweru in the DRC, and their villages are found several hundred miles up the Lualaba River. The Hemba people migrated eastward to the Lualaba valley from the Luba empire, probably some time after 1600. They traded salt for iron hoes made in the Luba heartland, and wore raphia cloth that came by way of the Luba from the Songye people further to the west. At the time of the eastward expansion of the Luba Kingdom under King Ilunga Sungu around 1800, Hemba people were living in a territory bounded by the Lukuga River in the north, the Luvua River in the south and the Lualaba River to the west. The lower Lukuga and the Lualaba provided natural lines of communication, and the river valleys were densely populated. During Ilunga Sungu's rule the southern Hemba became tributaries to the Luba. They were headed by a \\"fire king\\", who symbolically represented the Luba king. The Hemba fire kingdom cut its links to the Luba empire after Ilunga Sungu died. His successor, Kumwimbe Ngombe, had to fight several campaigns to recover the eastern territories. Kumwimbe created a client state that united the Hemba villages of the Lukushi River valley, and that played an important role in preserving Luba dominance over other small states in the region. Later the Hemba regained their independence, but were subject to attacks by Arab slave traders in the later part of the nineteenth century, and then to colonization by the Belgians. Culture The Hemba people live in villages, recognizing chiefs as their political leaders. A chief will be the head of an extended family of landowners, inheriting his title through the maternal line. Hemba people may also belong to secret societies such as the Bukazanzi for men and Bukibilo for women. The So'o secret society is guarded by the beautifully carved mask of a chimpanzee, which is used in rituals that relate to the ancestral spirits. These societies serve to offset the power of the chief. Although the Luba people failed to keep the southern Hemba in their kingdom they did have considerable cultural influence. Art forms, including wooden sculptures representing ancestors, are similar in style to Luba sculptures. The Hemba religion recognizes a creator god and a separate supreme being. The Hemba make sacrifices and present offerings at the shrines of ancestors. When social harmony has been upset, religious leaders may demand offerings to the specific ancestors that have become displeased and are causing the trouble. Each clan owns a kabeja, a statuette with one body and two faces, male and female, on one neck. Sacrifices are made to the kabeja, which will convey them to the spirits. A receptacle on the top of the kabeja is used to receive magic ingredients. A kabeja is dangerous to handle. Economy The villagers live by subsistence agriculture, growing manioc, maize, peanuts, and yams. They also hunt and fish to a small extent to supplement their diet. Cash is obtained through panning alluvial copper from the streams. Many Hemba men are also employed as miners in the copperbelt. Gallery of Hemba artwork The Hemba artistic tradition is well known. Subjects include ancestral figures, spirits, human faces and ceremonial masks. The Hemba had very talented sculptors and the art of the tribe is mainly known for the ancestors figures, the Singiti, symbols of power who exude astonishing serenity and natural authority The Kabeja is a rare Janiform sculpture which represents the couple of founding ancestors of each clan. The statue was unique and owned by the chief, while each group had several Singiti figures. It was used in all Hemba ceremonies, as well as in court decisionsLa grande statuaire Hemba du Zaire, François Neyt, Institut superieur d'archeologie et d'histoire de l'art, UCL, Louvain-La-Neuve, 1977 File:Africa Hemba Warrior Ancestor Figure 2 Kimbell.jpgWarrior Ancestor Figure; 19th century File:Hemba male figure1.jpgMale figure, Niembo chiefdom, late 19th to early 20th century File:Hemba male figure2.jpgMale figure, Niembo chiefdom, late 19th to early 20th century File:Kabeja.Hemba.jpgKabeja Hemba References Sources  Category:Ethnic groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ","title":"Hemba people"},{"id":"34038210","text":"Majestic Pictures was an American film production and distribution company active during the 1930s.

The Superintendent of the India Office Records between 1884 and 1898, he was also a historian and wrote works on India. Life Born at Hornsey on 1 July 1833, he was second son of Frederick Samuel Danvers of Hornsey, an officer in the East India Company's service, and his wife Mary Matilda Middleton, daughter of H. Middleton of Wanstead, Essex. After education at the Merchant Taylors' School, London, King's College, London, and Addiscombe College, he studied for two years as a civil and mechanical engineer. Then he became, on 26 January 1853, a writer in the old East India House. On the creation of the India Office Danvers was, in September 1858, made a junior clerk there. Deputed in 1859 to Liverpool and Manchester to report on the fitness of traction engines for use in India, where railway construction was still in its infancy, he was transferred on account of his technical knowledge to the public works department of the India Office in 1861. He there rose to be senior clerk in June 1867, and assistant secretary in February 1875. He attended the Exposition Universelle of 1867 in Paris, reporting in the Quarterly Journal of Science that other European nations were closing the technology gap with the United Kingdom.Graeme Gooday, Precision Measurement and the Genesis of Physics Teaching Laboratories in Victorian Britain, The British Journal for the History of Science Vol. 23, No. 1 (Mar., 1990), pp. 25–51, at p. 44.

His report, based on research in the Torre do Tombo archives and the public libraries in Lisbon and Evora, was published in 1892. He retired from the India Office in July 1898. His work on Portuguese records and history was recognised with the Order of Christ, knight commander. Archival researches 1893–5 at The Hague into Dutch maritime history were the subject of a further report, published in 1945 as Dutch activities in the east. Danvers died on 17 May 1906 at Broad Oaks, Addlestone, Surrey, and was buried at All Saints' Church, Benhilton. Works Danvers published History of the Portuguese in India (2 vols. 1894), an ambitious work. Sydney Ernest Fryer wrote in the Dictionary of National Biography that it \\"was marred by want of perspective and incomplete reference to authorities. Outside his official duties, Danvers wrote mainly on technical areas. He contributed articles on public works in India to Engineering (1866–75), and a volume \\"India\\" (1877) in the series Information for Colonial Engineers published by E. and F. N. Spon. He besides compiled memoranda on Indian coal, coal washing, and artificial fuel (1867–9), and publishing Statistical Papers relating to India (parliamentary paper, 1869), Coal Economy (1872), and A Century of Famines, 1770–1870 (1877). He read papers before the Society of Arts on Agriculture in India (1878), Famines in India (1886), and The India Office Records (1889).

It has an Arctic–alpine distribution in Eurasia and North America, and grows up to tall in a variety of habitats. Distribution Carex bigelowii has a circumpolar or circumboreal distribution, occurring throughout the northern latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. It is present in Europe, Asia and North America, where it occurs from Alaska to Greenland, and in alpine climates as far south as Utah and Colorado. Description Carex bigelowii produces 3-angled stems up to tall, growing in a tuft or singly. The leaves are stiff and dark green, and the leaves of previous seasons may remain on the plant. The inflorescence is accompanied by a short bract. The inflorescence has 1–3 black pistillate spikes under 1–2 staminate spikes. The plant usually reproduces vegetatively, sprouting tillers from its rhizome. It also spreads via stolons. It has a thick root network that allows it to form a turf, and the roots may grow deep in the soil. The plant sometimes reproduces sexually, producing seeds, which can remain viable for 200 years. Ecology Carex bigelowii grows in many types of Arctic and alpine habitat. It occurs in forest, bog, meadows and tundra. It occurs alongside plants such as willows (Salix spp.), dwarf arctic birch (Betula nana), lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), bog blueberry (V. uliginosum), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), northern Labrador tea (Ledum palustre), American green alder (Alnus crispa), cloudberry (Rubus chamaemorus), alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina), varileaf cinquefoil (Potentilla diversifolia), elephanthead lousewort (Pedicularis groenlandica), white mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), entireleaf mountain avens (D. integrifolia), alpine timothy (Phleum alpinum), alpine rush (Juncus alpinoarticulatus) and tussock cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum), as well as feathermosses (Hylocomium and Aulacomium spp.), lichens (Cladonia and Cladina spp.), and sphagnum mosses. In Scotland, particularly on Glas Maol, this sedge is codominant with the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum in a heath ecosystem, the British NVC community U10. The sedge is also associated with this moss on lava fields in Iceland. Carex bigelowii can colonize disturbed habitat. It has been noted to grow at oil spill sites within two months of the disturbance, and it grows alongside the Dempster Highway in northwestern Canada. Its long-lasting soil seed bank allows it to sprout after the soil is disturbed, and the rhizomes may prevent erosion.

Blue denotes a stable fixed point; Green denotes an unstable fixed point. By varying the input parameter, the two equilibria collide and form a stable limit cycle; Gray arrows indicate that the points are attracting in \\\\mathbb{R}^2; Black arrows indicate the direction of movement along the unit circle. The theta model, or Ermentrout–Kopell canonical model, is a biological neuron model originally developed to model neurons in the animal Aplysia, and later used in various fields of computational neuroscience. The model is particularly well suited to describe neuron bursting, which are rapid oscillations in the membrane potential of a neuron interrupted by periods of relatively little oscillation. Bursts are often found in neurons responsible for controlling and maintaining steady rhythms. For example, breathing is controlled by a small network of bursting neurons in the brain stem. Of the three main classes of bursting neurons (square wave bursting, parabolic bursting, and elliptic bursting), the theta model describes parabolic bursting. Parabolic bursting is characterized by a series of bursts that are regulated by a slower external oscillation. This slow oscillation changes the frequency of the faster oscillation so that the frequency curve of the burst pattern resembles a parabola. The model has just one state variable which describes the membrane voltage of a neuron. In contrast, the Hodgkin–Huxley model consists of four state variables (one voltage variable and three gating variables) and the Morris–Lecar model is defined by two state variables (one voltage variable and one gating variable). The single state variable of the theta model, and the elegantly simple equations that govern its behavior allow for analytic, or closed-form solutions (including an explicit expression for the phase response curve). The dynamics of the model take place on the unit circle, and are governed by two cosine functions and a real-valued input function. Similar models include the quadratic integrate and fire (QIF) model, which differs from the theta model by only by a change of variables and Plant's model, which consists of Hodgkin–Huxley type equations and also differs from the theta model by a series of coordinate transformations. Despite its simplicity, the theta model offers enough complexity in its dynamics that it has been used for a wide range of theoretical neuroscience research as well as in research beyond biology, such as in artificial intelligence. Background and history A model of pre-Bötzinger complex (pBC) neuron. The pre-Bötzinger complex is a region in the brain stem responsible for maintaining breathing rhythms. This is an example of a square-wave burster. In a slice preparation of the pBC complex, the neurons burst periodically and synchronize as long as they receive a continual, external, noisy input. Bursting is \\"an oscillation in which an observable [part] of the system, such as voltage or chemical concentration, changes periodically between an active phase of rapid spike oscillations (the fast sub-system) and a phase of quiescence\\". Bursting comes in three distinct forms: square wave bursting, parabolic bursting, and elliptic bursting. There exist some models that do not fit neatly into these categories by qualitative observation, but it is possible to sort such models by their topology (i.e. such models can be sorted \\"by the structure of the fast subsystem\\"). All three forms of bursting are capable of beating and periodic bursting. Periodic bursting (or just bursting) is of more interest because many phenomena are controlled by, or arise from, bursting. For example, bursting due to a changing membrane potential is common in various neurons, including but not limited to cortical chattering neurons, thalamacortical neurons, and pacemaker neurons. Pacemakers in general are known to burst and synchronize as a population, thus generating a robust rhythm that can maintain repetitive tasks like breathing, walking, and eating. Beating occurs when a cell bursts continuously with no periodic quiescent periods, but beating is often considered to be an extreme case and is rarely of primary interest. Bursting cells are important for motor generation and synchronization. For example, the pre-Bötzinger complex in the mammalian brain stem contains many bursting neurons that control autonomous breathing rhythms. Various neocortical neurons (i.e. cells of the neocortex) are capable of bursting, which \\"contribute significantly to [the] network behavior [of neocortical neurons]\\". The R15 neuron of the abdominal ganglion in Aplyisa, hypothesized to be a [pneurosecretory[] cell (i.e. a cell that produces hormones), is known to produce bursts characteristic of neurosecretory cells. In particular, it is known to produce parabolic bursts. Since many biological processes involve bursting behavior, there is a wealth of various bursting models in scientific literature. For instance, there exist several models for interneurons and cortical spiking neurons. However, the literature on parabolic bursting models is relatively scarce. Parabolic bursting models are mathematical models that mimic parabolic bursting in real biological systems. Each burst of a parabolic burster has a characteristic feature in the burst structure itself – the frequency at the beginning and end of the burst is low relative to the frequency in the middle of the burst. A frequency plot of one burst resembles a parabola, hence the name \\"parabolic burst\\". Furthermore, unlike elliptic or square-wave bursting, there is a slow modulating wave which, at its peak, excites the cell enough to generate a burst and inhibits the cell in regions near its minimum. As a result, the neuron periodically transitions between bursting and quiescence. Parabolic bursting has been studied most extensively in the R15 neuron, which is one of six types of neurons of the Aplysia abdominal ganglion and one of thirty neurons comprising the abdominal ganglion. The Aplysia abdominal ganglion was studied and extensively characterized because its relatively large neurons and proximity of the neurons to the surface of the ganglion made it an ideal and \\"valuable preparation for cellular electrophysical studies\\". Early attempts to model parabolic bursting were for specific applications, often related to studies of the R15 neuron. This is especially true of R. E. Plant and Carpenter, whose combined works comprise the bulk of parabolic bursting models prior to Ermentrout and Kopell's canonical model. Though there was no specific mention of the term \\"parabolic bursting\\" in Plant's papers, Plant's model(s) do involve a slow, modulating oscillation which control bursting in the model(s). This is, by definition, parabolic bursting. Both of Plant's papers on the topic involve a model derived from the Hodgkin–Huxley equations and include extra conductances, which only add to the complexity of the model. Carpenter developed her model primarily for a square wave burster. The model was capable of producing a small variety of square wave bursts and produced parabolic bursts as a consequence of adding an extra conductance. However, the model applied to only spatial propagation down axons and not situations where oscillations are limited to a small region in space (i.e. it was not suited for \\"space-clamped\\" situations). The lack of a simple, generalizable, space- clamped, parabolic bursting model motivated Ermentrout and Kopell to develop the theta model. Characteristics of the model General equations It is possible to describe a multitude of parabolic bursting cells by deriving a simple mathematical model, called a canonical model. Derivation of the Ermentrout and Kopell canonical model begins with the general form for parabolic bursting, and notation will be fixed to clarify the discussion. The letters f, g, h, I are reserved for functions; x, y, \\\\theta for state variables; \\\\varepsilon, p, and q for scalars. In the following generalized system of equations for parabolic bursting, the values of f describe the membrane potential and ion channels, typical of many conductance-based biological neuron models. Slow oscillations are controlled by h, and ultimately described by y. These slow oscillations can be, for example, slow fluctuations in calcium concentration inside a cell. The function g couples \\\\dot{y} to \\\\dot{x}, thereby allowing the second system, \\\\dot{y}, to influence the behavior of the first system, \\\\dot{x}. In more succinct terms, \\"x generates the spikes and y generates the slow waves\\". The equations are: : \\\\dot{x} = f(x) + \\\\varepsilon^2 g(x,y,\\\\varepsilon), : \\\\dot{y} = \\\\varepsilon h(x,y,\\\\varepsilon), where x is a vector with p entries (i.e. x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^p), y is a vector with q entries (i.e. y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^q), \\\\varepsilon is small and positive, and f, g, h are smooth (i.e. infinitely differentiable). Additional constraints are required to guarantee parabolic bursting. First, \\\\dot{x}=f(x) must produce a circle in phase space that is invariant, meaning it does not change under certain transformations. This circle must also be attracting in \\\\mathbb{R}^2 with a critical point located at x = 0. The second criterion requires that when \\\\dot{y}=h(0,y,0), there exists a stable limit cycle solution. These criteria can be summarized by the following points: #When \\\\varepsilon = 0, \\\\dot{x}=f(x) \\"has an attracting invariant circle with a single critical point\\", with the critical point located at x=0, and #When x = 0, \\\\dot{y}=h(0,y,0) has a stable limit cycle solution. The theta model can be used in place of any parabolic bursting model that satisfies the assumptions above.  Model equations and properties  The theta model is a reduction of the generalized system from the previous section and takes the form, : \\\\frac{d\\\\theta}{dt}=1-\\\\cos\\\\theta+(1+\\\\cos\\\\theta)I(t), \\\\qquad \\\\theta \\\\in S^1. This model is one of the simplest excitable neuron models. The state variable \\\\theta represents the angle in radians, and the input function, I(t), is typically chosen to be periodic. Whenever \\\\theta reaches the value \\\\theta = \\\\pi, the model is said to produce a spike. The theta model is capable of a single saddle-node bifurcation and can be shown to be the \\"normal form for the saddle-node on a limit cycle bifurcation\\" (SNIC). When (I < 0), the system is excitable, i.e., given an appriate perturbation the system will produce a spike. Incidentally, when viewed in the plane (\\\\mathbb{R}^2), the unstable critical point is actually a saddle point because S^1 is attracting in \\\\mathbb{R}^2. When (I > 0), \\\\dot{\\\\theta} is also positive, and the system will give rise to a limit cycle. Therefore, the bifurcation point is located at I(t) = 0. Near the bifurcation point, the theta model resembles the quadratic integrate and fire model: : \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = x^2 + I. For I > 0, the solutions \\"blow up\\" rather quickly. By resetting the trajectory x(t) to -\\\\infty when it reaches +\\\\infty, the total period is then : T = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{\\\\sqrt{I}}. Therefore, the period diverges as I \\\\rightarrow 0^+ and the frequency converges to zero. =Example= When I(t) is some slow wave which can be both negative and positive, the system is capable of producing parabolic bursts. Consider the simple example I(t) := \\\\sin(\\\\alpha t), where \\\\alpha is relatively small. Then for \\\\alpha t \\\\in (0, \\\\pi), I(t) is strictly positive and \\\\theta makes multiple passes through the angle \\\\pi, resulting in multiple bursts. Note that whenever \\\\alpha t is near zero or \\\\pi, the theta neuron will spike at relatively a low frequency, and whenever \\\\alpha t is near \\\\alpha t = \\\\pi/2 the neuron will spike with very high frequency. When \\\\alpha t = \\\\pi, the frequency of spikes is zero since the period is infinite since \\\\theta can no longer pass through \\\\theta = \\\\pi. Finally, for \\\\alpha t \\\\in (\\\\pi, 2\\\\pi), the neuron is excitable and will no longer burst. This qualitative description highlights the characteristics that make the theta model a parabolic bursting model. Not only does the model have periods of quiescence between bursts which are modulated by a slow wave, but the frequency of spikes at the beginning and end of each burst is high relative to the frequency at the middle of the burst. Derivation The derivation comes in the form of two lemmas in Ermentrout and Kopell (1986). Lemma 1, in summary, states that when viewing the general equations above in a subset S^1 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^2, the equations take the form: : \\\\dot{x_1} = \\\\overline{f}(x_1) + \\\\varepsilon^2 \\\\overline{g}(x_1, y, \\\\varepsilon) \\\\qquad x_1 \\\\in S^1, : \\\\dot{y} = \\\\varepsilon \\\\overline{h}(x_1, y, \\\\varepsilon) \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^q. By lemma 2 in Ermentrout and Kopell 1986, \\"There exists a change of coordinates... and a constant, c, such that in new coordinates, the two equations above converge pointwise as \\\\varepsilon \\\\rightarrow 0 to the equations : \\\\dot{\\\\theta} = (1-\\\\cos\\\\theta) + (1 + \\\\cos\\\\theta)\\\\overline{g}(0,y,0), : \\\\dot{y} = \\\\frac{1}{c} \\\\overline{h}(0,y,0), for all \\\\theta eq \\\\pi. Convergence is uniform except near \\\\theta = \\\\pi.\\" (Ermentrout and Kopell, 1986). By letting I(t) := \\\\overline{g}(0,y,0), resemblance to the theta model is obvious. Phase response curve The phase response curve of the theta model with K = 1. Since perturbations always result in a phase advance, this is a type 1 PRC. In general, given a scalar phase model of the form : \\\\dot{\\\\theta} = f(\\\\theta) + g(\\\\theta)S(t), where S(t) represents the perturbation current, a closed form solution of the phase response curve (PRC) does not exist. However, the theta model is a special case of such an oscillator and happens to have a closed- form solution for the PRC. The theta model is recovered by defining f and g as : f(\\\\theta) = (1-\\\\cos\\\\theta) + I(1+\\\\cos\\\\theta), : g(\\\\theta) = (1 + \\\\cos\\\\theta). In the appendix of Ermentrout 1996, the PRC is shown to be Z(\\\\theta) = K(1+\\\\cos\\\\theta). Similar models Plant's model The authors of Soto-Treviño et al. (1996) discuss in great detail the similarities between Plant's (1976) model and the theta model. At first glance, the mechanisms of bursting in both systems are very different: In Plant's model, there are two slow oscillations – one for conductance of a specific current and one for the concentration of calcium. The calcium oscillations are active only when the membrane potential is capable of oscillating. This contrasts heavily against the theta model in which one slow wave modulates the burst of the neuron and the slow wave has no dependence upon the bursts. Despite these differences, the theta model is shown to be similar to Plant's (1976) model by a series of coordinate transformations. In the process, Soto-Trevino, et al. discovered that the theta model was more general than originally believed. Quadratic integrate-and-fire The quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model was created by Latham et al. in 2000 to explore the many questions related to networks of neurons with low firing rates. It was unclear to Latham et al. why networks of neurons with \\"standard\\" parameters were unable to generate sustained low frequency firing rates, while networks with low firing rates were often seen in biological systems. According to Gerstner and Kistler (2002), the quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) model is given by the following differential equation: : \\\\tau \\\\dot{u} = a_0(u-u_\\\\text{rest})(u-u_c) + R_m I, where a_0 is a strictly positive scalar, u is the membrane potential, u_\\\\text{rest} is the resting potential u_c is the minimum potential necessary for the membrane to produce an action potential, R_m is the membrane resistance, \\\\tau the membrane time constant and u_c > u_\\\\text{rest}. When there is no input current (i.e. I = 0), the membrane potential quickly returns to rest following a perturbation. When the input current, I, is large enough, the membrane potential (u) surpasses its firing threshold and rises rapidly (indeed, it reaches arbitrarily large values in finite time); this represents the peak of the action potential. To simulate the recovery after the action potential, the membrane voltage is then reset to a lower value u_r. To avoid dealing with arbitrarily large values in simulation, researchers will often set an upper limit on the membrane potential, above which the membrane potential will be reset; for example Latham et al. (2000) reset the voltage from +20 mV to −80 mV. This voltage reset constitutes an action potential. The theta model is very similar to the QIF model since the theta model differs from the QIF model by means of a simple coordinate transform. By scaling the voltage appropriately and letting \\\\Delta I be the change in current from the minimum current required to elicit a spike, the QIF model can be rewritten in the form : \\\\dot{u} = u^2 + \\\\Delta I. Similarly, the theta model can be rewritten as : \\\\dot{\\\\theta} = 1-\\\\cos\\\\theta + (1+\\\\cos\\\\theta) \\\\Delta I. The following proof will show that the QIF model becomes the theta model given an appropriate choice for the coordinate transform. Define u(t) = \\\\tan(\\\\theta/2). Recall that d\\\\tan(x)/dx = 1/\\\\cos^2(x), so taking the derivative yields : \\\\dot{u} = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\cos^2\\\\left(\\\\frac \\\\theta 2\\\\right)} \\\\frac 1 2 \\\\dot{\\\\theta} = u^2 + \\\\Delta I. An additional substitution and rearranging in terms of \\\\theta yields : \\\\dot{\\\\theta} = 2\\\\left[ \\\\cos^2\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\theta2\\\\right)\\\\tan^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\theta2\\\\right) + \\\\cos^2\\\\left(\\\\frac\\\\theta2\\\\right)\\\\Delta I \\\\right] = 2\\\\left[ \\\\sin^2 \\\\left(\\\\frac \\\\theta 2\\\\right) + \\\\cos^2 \\\\left ( \\\\frac \\\\theta 2\\\\right)\\\\Delta I \\\\right]. Using the trigonometric identities \\\\cos^2(x/2) = \\\\frac{1+\\\\cos(x)}{2}, \\\\sin^2(x/2) = \\\\frac{1-\\\\cos(x)}{2} and \\\\dot{\\\\theta} as defined above, we have that : \\\\dot{\\\\theta} = 2 \\\\left[ \\\\frac{1-\\\\cos\\\\theta} 2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{1+\\\\cos\\\\theta}{2}\\\\right) \\\\Delta I \\\\right] = 1-\\\\cos\\\\theta + (1+\\\\cos\\\\theta)\\\\Delta I. Therefore, there exists a change of coordinates, namely u(t) = \\\\tan(\\\\theta/2), which transforms the QIF model into the theta model. The reverse transformation also exists, and is attained by taking the inverse of the first transformation. Applications Neuroscience =Lobster stomatogastric ganglion= Though the theta model was originally used to model slow cytoplasmic oscillations that modulate fast membrane oscillations in a single cell, Ermentrout and Kopell found that the theta model could be applied just as easily to systems of two electrically coupled cells such that the slow oscillations of one cell modulates the bursts of the other. Such cells serve as the central pattern generator (CPG) of the pyloric system in the lobster stomatograstic ganglion. In such a system, a slow oscillator, called the anterior burster (AB) cell, modulates the bursting cell called the pyloric dilator (PD), resulting in parabolic bursts. =Visual cortex= A group led by Boergers, used the theta model to explain why exposure to multiple simultaneous stimuli can reduce the response of the visual cortex below the normal response from a single (preferred) stimulus. Their computational results showed that this may happen due to strong stimulation of a large group of inhibitory neurons. This effect not only inhibits neighboring populations, but has the extra consequence of leaving the inhibitory neurons in disarray, thus increasing the effectiveness of inhibition. Theta networks Osan et al. (2002) found that in a network of theta neurons, there exist two different types of waves that propagate smoothly over the network, given a sufficiently large coupling strength. Such traveling waves are of interest because they are frequently observed in pharmacologically treated brain slices, but are hard to measure in intact animals brains. The authors used a network of theta models in favor of a network of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) models due to two primary advantages: first, the theta model is continuous, and second, the theta model retains information about \\"the delay between the crossing of the spiking threshold and the actual firing of an action potential\\". The LIF fails to satisfy both conditions. Artificial intelligence =Steepest gradient descent learning rule= The theta model can also be applied to research beyond the realm of biology. McKennoch et al. (2008) derived a steepest gradient descent learning rule based on theta neuron dynamics. Their model is based on the assumption that \\"intrinsic neuron dynamics are sufficient to achieve consistent time coding, with no need to involve the precise shape of postsynaptic currents...\\" contrary to similar models like SpikeProp and Tempotron, which depend heavily on the shape of the postsynaptic potential (PSP). Not only could the multilayer theta network perform just about as well as Tempotron learning, but the rule trained the multilayer theta network to perform certain tasks neither SpikeProp nor Tempotron were capable of. Limitations According to Kopell and Ermentrout (2004), a limitation of the theta lies in its relative difficulty in electrically coupling two theta neurons. It is possible to create large networks of theta neurons – and much research has been done with such networks – but it may be advantageous to use Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons, which allow for electrical coupling in a \\"straightforward way\\".

More than 160 had been sold by 2009. Design and development The Jora was designed by Oldrich Olsansky who also designed the similar Fantasy Air Allegro. It is built mostly from wood and laminates, covered by polyester fabric. The main exception is the central fuselage section, which has a riveted tube frame. The Jora has separate wings with constant chord and square tips. These are each built up around a single spruce spar. Plywood covering and polyester-filled laminate ribs form a box spar forward to the leading edge, with spruce ribs and polyester covering aft. Since 2006 all composite parts have been replaced by carbon fibre castings. Each wing has a single, faired lift strut to the lower fuselage. Full-span combined ailerons and flaps (flaperons), constructed like the wing, are attached to an auxiliary spar. Separate ailerons and flaps are an option, in which case the wing profile (airfoil) is changed from the laminar flow UA-2 to SL-1. The wings can be detached for transport, though wing folding is an option. Apart from its tube centre section the fuselage is wholly laminate with strengthening bulkheads and ribs. The fuselage becomes slender towards the fin and has a constant chord tailplane and elevators. The fin has sweep on its leading edge and extends into a small keel below the fuselage. The cockpit seats two in side-by-side configuration, with dual controls including a split, central control column. It is enclosed with a single-piece windscreen and deep side transparencies. The Jora normally has a fixed, tricycle undercarriage, though a conventional undercarriage is an option. The mainwheels are mounted on inverted tubular steel A-frames, hinged to the lower fuselage; the nosewheel is on a forward-leaning leg and is steerable. Some Joras have single cantilever main legs. Rubber springs are used on all legs; the main wheels have hydraulic disc brakes. The standard engine for the Jora is a 38.2 kW (52 hp) Rotax 582, a two-cylinder two-stroke engine, housed under a short cowling. It can accept engines of up to 75 kW (100 hp).

They have a long period of occupation from the Bronze Age with cairns and entrance graves through to Iron Age field systems and a Roman shrine on Nornour. Before the 19th century, the islands were known by their Cornish name, which had also become the name of the largest island in the group after the submergence of the connecting lands.Weatherhill, Craig, Place Names in Cornwall and Scilly, Wessex Books, 2005 Geography The islands are located to the south–east of St Martin's, and are within the Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and part of the Scilly Heritage Coast. The Isles are not as exposed to gales as the Western Rocks and consequently the soils do not receive so much salt spray, and remnant habitats such as coastal grassland and maritime heath have survived the inundation of the sea. If the practice of summer grazing had continued there would be even more grassland instead of the dense bramble which has smothered some of the small growing plants. The islands by area are: *Great Ganilly *Great, Middle and Little Arthur *Menawethan *Little Ganilly *Great Innisvouls *Great Ganinick *Nornour *Little Ganinick *Little Innisvouls *Ragged Island *Guther's *Hanjague Eastern Isles seen from Pentle Bay, Tresco Geology The underlying rock is coarse grained Hercynian granite topped by wind–blown sand. Some of the islands are linked with boulder ridges and sandy bars and at low tide can be viewed as one island. During the Roman occupation of England and Wales the area was a low–lying plain between St Mary's and St Martins and the present Eastern Isles small hills. The Isles of Scilly are a Geological Conservation Review (GCR) site for the largest assemblage of tied islands outside of Orkney and Shetland. Four islands represent the different stages in the linking of islands by a sandy bar or tombola and they are Teän (not part of the Eastern Isles) which is to the north–west, between St Martin's and Tresco; and Great Arthur, Great Ganinick and Little Ganinick which are to the south–east of St Martin's. Wildlife and ecology Most of the islands have dense cover of bramble Rubus fruticosus and bracken Pteridium aquilinum and grassland along the coastal fringes. Goldenrod (Solidago virgaurea) is locally abundant amongst the heath communities growing on the podzolic soils on the higher parts of the islands. The heaths are classified as a poor fit somewhere between H10 and H11 and the heather (Calluna vulgaris), bell heather (Erica cinerea) and bracken merge into pure bracken on the lower slopes. A feasibility study is needed to decide if the vegetation would benefit from grazing through a Higher Level Stewardship (HLS) agreement. With no resident botanist, together with the difficulty of recording on remote islands, there are not many plant records and the number of species for each of the Eastern Isles was finally published in 1971 from surveys carried out by J D Grose, Mr & Mrs J E Dallas and J E Lousley in 1938 and 1939. Lousley listed 111 species of higher plants in his 1971 Flora, and by 1999 further surveys recorded a similar number (114). Some of the islands have species that are only found on that island and not on the other Eastern Isles such as an oak tree found by Mr and Mrs Dallas on Great Gannick. Possible ancient woodland indicators such as butcher's-broom (Ruscus aculeatus), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) have also been recorded on Great Gannick. The nationally rare orange bird's-foot (Ornithopus pinnatus) is found on the northern side of Great Ganilly. The Eastern Isles are one of three main grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) pupping areas, Western Rocks and Norrard Rocks being the others. Four other mammals have been recorded: rabbit, brown rat described as a plague on some of the Eastern Isles, house mouse and the so- called Scilly shrew. The isles are also home to breeding colonies of eight species of seabird; including three species of gull, as well as the common shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), northern fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), razorbill (Alca torda) and puffin (Fratercula arctica). Several of the isles are closed to visitors during the birds' breeding season (15 April to 20 August). The islands Great Ganilly Great Ganilly Great Ganilly (, great salt water down) (), is the largest of the Eastern Isles and consists of two hills joined together by a low sandy neck. The northern of the two hills has the highest point at and has a ruined Bronze Age entrance grave on the summit. Stones from the chamber have been used to make a pyramidal navigational marker. Other evidence of past occupation include a hut circle on the neck as well as the remains of field systems. A freshwater spring would have made living on the island during the kelp burning season possible. The hills have maritime heath on each summit and dense bracken communities on the lower slopes. A total of seventy-four plant species were recorded in the surveys of 1938 and 1939; the largest number of species on any of the Eastern Isles and includes Portland and sea spurge, sea–kale and balm–leaved figwort in the small sand dune system. Common thyme and orange bird's–foot grow on the heath, which is dominated by bell heather (Erica cinerea). Betony (Stachys officinalis) which is a common plant in Cornwall but known from only two places in Scilly was discovered simultaneously here, and on Tresco in 1998, but was not seen in 2000. Mammals recorded are rabbit, brown rat, house mouse and Scilly shrew. Great, Middle and Little Arthur The Arthurs (, facing land) (), part of the Geological Conservation Review site (GCR), are three rocky islands joined by two beaches forming a crescent around Arthur Porth; compare with Great Ganinick and Little Ganinick (see below) where the process is ongoing. Great Arthur, as the name suggests, is the largest with a fringe of maritime grassland, dune vegetation and strandline vegetation. There are three entrance graves on the summit ridge connected by a prehistoric boulder wall. They are surrounded by maritime heath with English stonecrop on the bare areas. The area of blown sand is dominated by marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) which helps to stabilise the dunes and shelter a relatively rich flora of non-maritime plants such as a stunted grey sallow (Salix cinerea). This (probably the same) plant is recorded in both Louseley (1971) and Parslow (1997). Middle Arthur has an unusual boat-shaped entrance grave on the summit with walls of standing slabs. A ceramic burial urn together with pieces of bone and flint were found during excavations in 1953. The island as a few patches of heather and some strandline vegetation on the sheltered parts of its shore, while Little Arthur has bracken on the deeper soils and heath on the summit with English stonecrop in the bare areas. Also on Little Arthur is a small area of strandline vegetation and sand dunes with slender St John's-wort (Hypericum pulchrum); a plant common in Cornwall but uncommon in the Isles of Scilly. Menawethan Menawethan (, the tree stone) (), is a steep-sided island to the south–east of the group with vegetation that is typical of islands with breeding seabirds. It was one of the first islands where Natural England carried out rat eradication. Some areas are covered in hottentot fig (probably carried to the island by gulls); thrift and sea campion also dominate in some areas. Other species recorded include Yorkshire fog, orache, common scurvy-grass and tree-mallow which forms temporary stands in some years. Brookweed (Samolus valerandi), a plant restricted to cliff flushes in Cornwall and an unusual plant in Scilly, grows among rocks above the shore. The rocky shore is used by grey seal for haul outs. There is a Bronze Age cairn on the summit. The island is recorded as Mynangwython c1588. Little Ganilly Little Ganilly (, little salt water down) () is just to the north of Little Arthur and has a small area of heath on the summit. Bracken dominates the slopes and there are maritime grassland and cliff communities along the coast which has several small caves on the east side. Surveys in 1938 and 1939 recorded 37 species of plants. The only mammals recorded are brown rats and grey seals which use the island as a haul out. Great Innisvouls and Little Innisvouls Great Innisvouls (, great wether island) (), has a small area of maritime grassland and bracken, and Little Innisvouls (, little wether island) () has strandline plant species. Both have breeding seabirds and the Scilly shrew has been recorded on Great Innisvouls. Gurney reported twelve pairs of shag with egg and one pair with young on Great Iinnisvouls on 12 May 1887. To the north–east of Little Innisvouls is a small rock called Mouls (, wether (a castrated male sheep)) (), where a nationally scarce pseudoscorpion, Neobisium maritimum was found in 1927. Great Ganinick and Little Ganinick Great Ganinick and Little Ganinick The islands of Great Ganinick and Little Ganinick (, place of wild garlic) (), are part of the GCR and are in an early stage of the linkage of two islands by a tombola. The sand bar is building from Little Ganinick, northwards, towards the larger island although the sand supply does not appear to be sufficient to link the two islands. On the north side of Great Ganinick a \\"cuspate\\" shaped beach is forming. Great Ganinick has the only known oak tree in the Eastern Islands. Described by Mr and Mrs Dallas in 1938 as ″.... about 2 ft 6in (0.76 m) tall in tangle of bracken, bramble and honeysuckle. It was still there (or possibly one like it) in 1997. Great Ganinick is rich in plant species with 74 species recorded by Lousley including butcher's–broom, wood spurge, wood small–reed and white ramping–fumitory. Little Ganinick has grassland with strandline vegetation and seabird colonies. Nornour Nornour (, facing the mainland) (), consists of one hill covered in bracken to the north of, and joined at low tide, to Great Ganilly by a boulder causeway. There was a long period of habitation during the Bronze and Iron Ages when the island would have been part of a larger island, and after a storm in 1962 the eroded sand dunes uncovered hut circles. Eleven circular stone buildings were found and the site was excavated in 1962–66 and 1969–73. Many features were found including doorways, dividing walls, steps, hearths, querns and stone- lined pits. Two of the buildings have since disappeared under beach boulders. Among the numerous Roman finds found in the two western huts were more than three hundred brooches dating from the later first to later third century AD. They were found in the upper layers of two of the prehistoric buildings, along with coins (late first to late fourth century), glass, miniature pots and pieces of small clay Gallic figurines. The earliest coins are from Vespasian (AD 69–79) and the later date indicate that the site was still being used into late fourth century. Analysis of the brooches indicate they came from numerous places in Britain and the Continent and, because there are no comparable sites on Scilly, it suggests that the finds were not for trade but perhaps for paying respect to a local cult. The finds indicate a shrine and Sulis has been suggested. With dates ranging over four centuries, it is unlikely that the objects came from a shipwreck. Despite attempts to protect the archaeological site sea erosion still occurs. The boilers of the paddle steamer Earl of Arran can be seen at low tide on the western shore. She hit Irishman's Ledge () on 16 July 1872 when the Captain attempted to take a short cut through English Island Neck. There is a small area of heath on the hill with heather and bell heather and in the disturbed area around the hut circles. The nationally scarce plants Portland spurge (Euphorbia portlandica) and balm–leaved figwort (Scrophularia scorodonia) have been recorded on Nornour, as has butcher's–broom, sea spurge (Euphorbia paralias) and sea spleenwort (Asplenium marinum) The endangered shore dock (Rumex rupestris) colony has not been seen since 1970. Ragged Island Ragged Island () has two unexpected plants; Chilean hard-fern (Blechnum cordatum) and borage (Borago officinalis). It is not known how they got there, neither species was recorded by Lousley in his 1971 Flora, although spores from ferns can be blown some distance; Chilean hard-fern was recorded in Higher Town, St Martin's in 1936. Other species recorded include thrift, scurvy grass, hastate orache and sea beet. Guther's Guther's Island Guther's (or Gunther's) (, channels) (), is a small island which lies on the western side of the Eastern Isles and south of St Martin's. It has limited vegetation consisting of grass, docks and sea beet. Greater black-backed (Larus marinus) and herring gulls (L. argentatus) nest as do common shags. It is possible to walk out to this island from St Martin's at exceptional low tides, but great care must be taken not to be cut off. Hanjague Hanjague (, the windy one) (), is a sea stack approximately one km north east of Great Gannilly and is the easternmost island in the archipelago. The island has no vegetation and is used as a roost by birds. English Island The rock is between English Island point, St Martin's to the north, and Nornour to the south-east ().

The subject is Lilith, who was, according to ancient Judaic myth, \\"the first wife of Adam\\" and is associated with the seduction of men and the murder of children. She is shown as a \\"powerful and evil temptress\\" and as \\"an iconic, Amazon-like female with long, flowing hair.\\"Delaware Art Museum, Lady Lilith Rossetti overpainted Cornforth's face, perhaps at the suggestion of his client, shipping magnate Frederick Richards Leyland, who displayed the painting in his drawing room with five other Rossetti \\"stunners.\\"Waking Dreams, p. 58. After Leyland's death, the painting was purchased by Samuel Bancroft and Bancroft's estate donated it in 1935 to the Delaware Art Museum where it is now displayed. The painting forms a pair with Sibylla Palmifera, painted 1866–70, also with Wilding as the model. Lady Lilith represents the body's beauty, according to Rossetti's sonnet inscribed on the frame. Sibylla Palmifera represents the soul's beauty, according to the Rossetti sonnet on its frame. A large 1867 replica of Lady Lilith, painted by Rossetti in watercolor, which shows the face of Cornforth, is now owned by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has a verse from Goethe's Faust as translated by Shelley on a label attached by Rossetti to its frame: Painting On 9 April 1866 Rossetti wrote to Frederick Leyland: Lady Lilith was commissioned by Leyland in early 1866 and delivered to him in early 1869 at a price of £472. 10 s. Two studies, dated to 1866, exist for the work, but two notebook sketches may be from an earlier date. The painting focuses on Lilith, but is meant to be a \\"Modern Lilith\\" rather than the mythological figure. She contemplates her own beauty in her hand-mirror. The painting is one of a series of Rossetti paintings of such \\"mirror pictures.\\" Other painters soon followed with their own mirror pictures with narcissistic female figures, but Lady Lilith has been considered \\"the epitome\\" of the type. Rossetti's assistant, Henry Treffry Dunn, states that the final part painted was the flowery background. He and G. P. Boyce gathered large baskets of white roses from John Ruskin's garden in Denmark Hill, and returned with them to Rossetti's house in Chelsea. Dunn is thought to have later recreated Rossetti's picture of Lady Lilith in coloured chalk. Sources disagree on whether Leyland or Rossetti initiated the repainting,Waking Dreams, p. 188. but the major change was the substitution of Alexa Wilding's face for Cornforth's. The painting was returned to Rossetti in February 1872, and he completed the repainting on 2 December at Kelmscott Manor before returning it to Leyland. Alexa was born Alice Wilding and was about 27 years old at the time of the repainting. Rossetti paid her a retainer of £1 per week for modelling. Wilding's face had earlier replaced the face in another painting Venus Verticordia.Venus Verticordia, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, 1864-8, Rossetti Archive, Retrieved 18 December 2011. Despite Rossetti's record of serial liaisons with his models, there is little or no evidence of a romantic attachment between Wilding and Rossetti. Characteristics of the painting that are commonly noted include the overt flower symbolism, and the unreal, crowded, depthless space, perhaps best shown by the bizarre mirror that reflects both the candles in the \\"room\\" and an exterior garden scene. The white roses may indicate cold, sensuous love and reflect the tradition that roses first \\"blushed\\" or turned red upon meeting Eve. The poppy in the lower right hand corner may indicate sleep and forgetfulness and reflect the languid nature of Lilith. Foxgloves, near the mirror, may indicate insincerity.Smith, Sarah Phelps. “Dante Gabriel Rossetti's ‘Lady Lilith’ and the Language of Flowers.” Arts Magazine 53 (1979): 142–145. One of Rossetti's assistants, Charles Fairfax Murray, who had created copies of his master's work claimed that some paintings later attributed to Rossetti were actually painted by his assistants. Murray claimed that the Lady Lilith in the Metropolitan Museum of Art was painted by Henry Treffry Dunn and was just \\"touched up\\" by Rossetti. Body's Beauty and Soul's Beauty Sibylla Palmifera, 1866–1870, also features Alexa Wilding as the model. It forms a pair with Lady Lilith with Rossetti poems inscribed on each frame. Now in the Lady Lever Art Gallery. Rossetti began painting Sibylla Palmifera before persuading George Rae to commission it in late 1865. The final price was 400 guineas. He worked sporadically on the painting and only completed it in December 1870. In June 1869 he received £200 from Leyland for a copy that was never completed. The name Palmifera means \\"palm-bearer,\\" and the model holds a palm in her hands. The palm, together with the inclusion of butterflies, may indicate the spiritual nature of the painting. This painting also has flower symbolism – using red roses and poppies in this case – and an unrealistic background space. Rossetti wrote the sonnet \\"Soul's Beauty\\" to accompany the painting Sibylla Palmifera, just as he wrote the sonnet \\"Lilith\\" to accompany the painting Lady Lilith. Both pairs of poems and pictures were first published, side-by-side, in Algernon Charles Swinburne's Notes on the Royal Academy Exhibition in 1868. In 1870 the poems were published again in Rossetti's Sonnets for Pictures. It was not until 1881 however that the sonnets became a true pair. At that time Rossetti decided to directly contrast the two poems, renamed \\"Lilith\\" to \\"Body's Beauty\\" and published them on consecutive pages of his book The House of Life as sonnets LXXVII and LXXVIII.  Feminist perspective In myth, Lilith is a powerful, threatening, sexual woman who resists domination by men. Thus she has been considered a symbol of the feminist movement. In the painting she concentrates on her own beauty, luxuriates in her free, sensual hair, lacks the usual Victorian corset, and wears \\"clothes that look as if they are soon to be removed.\\" In The Power of Women's Hair in the Victorian Imagination, Elizabeth G.

Samuel Bancroft, a textile mill owner from Wilmington, Delaware, bought the painting at Leyland's estate sale, held at Christie's on 28 May 1892, for £525. He bought at least four other Rossetti paintings at the same time and later accumulated one of the largest collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside of the United Kingdom. The Bancroft estate donated Bancroft's extensive collection of paintings in 1935 to the Delaware Art Museum. The painting was exhibited in London in 1883, and Philadelphia in 1892 while Bancroft's house was being expanded to hold his new paintings. It has also been exhibited in Richmond, Virginia (1982), Tokyo (1990), Birmingham and Williamstown (2000), and in London, Liverpool and Amsterdam (2003).Waking Dreams, p.186.

It was first produced posthumously at the Dionysia in Athens, most likely in 405 BCE, in a trilogy with The Bacchae and Iphigenia in Aulis. The trilogy won first prize. Except for a few fragments, Alcmaeon in Corinth has been lost. Irish playwright Colin Teevan published a reconstruction of the play in 2005. Approximately 23 fragments covering about 40 lines of Alcmaeon in Corinth are extant and were incorporated by Teevan in his reconstruction, although it is not certain that all these fragments belong to this play. No complete scene has survived, nor has the cast of characters. Plot What is known of the plot of Alcmaeon in Corinth is based on a summary in the Library of Pseudo- Apollodorus. According to this summary, during the time he went mad Alcmaeon had a son, Amphilochus, and a daughter, Tisiphone, by Manto. Alcmaeon left the children to be raised by King Creon of Corinth, but Creon's wife Merope, jealous of Tisiphone, sold her into slavery. Alcmaeon unknowingly purchased Tisiphone as a slave, and returned to Corinth with her, where he was reunited with Amphilochus, who was later to be the founder of Amphilochian Argos. The play began with a prologue narrated by the god Apollo during which he explained that although Manto did not have any children with him, she had two children by Alcmaeon. While Alcmaeon was in Corinth, there would have been a recognition scene in which Tisiphone's identity was revealed, probably by Merope. Based on one of the surviving fragments, Creon fled childless into exile after the true father of Amphilochus was revealed to be Alcmaeon rather than Creon. The chorus was probably a group of females. British classics scholar Edith Hall finds a possible thematic link between the three plays in the trilogy that included Alcmaeon in Corinth. Iphigenia in Aulis tells the story of King Agamemnon sacrificing his young daughter Iphigenia. The Bacchae tells the story of Agave killing her young adult son Pentheus. Similarly, Alcmaeon in Corinth incorporated the story of a parent's relationship with a youth. Hall suggests that Alcmaeon in Corinth may have used at least a partially comic tone. This theory is based on a fragmentary dialogue exchange. One character, possibly Alcmaeon, says that he \\"killed his mother, to put it in a nutshell.\\" Another character responds \\"Was this a consensual act, or were you both reluctant?\\" Fragments According to Christopher Collard and Martin Cropp, only four fragments of more than a few words have been definitively assigned to Alcmaeon in Corinth. In fragment 73a, Apollo states that Manto had no children by him but had two by Alcmaeon. In fragment 74, upon Alcmaeon's arrival in Corinth the chorus asks the stranger who has just arrived who he is. In fragment 75, a character, possibly Tisiphone or Alcmaeon, says to Amphilochus \\"Son of Creon, how true then it has proved, that from noble fathers noble children are born, and from base ones children resembling their father's nature.\\" Fragment 76 tells of Creon fleeing into exile after Amphilochus is revealed to be Alcmaeon's son rather than Creon's. In addition to these fragments, there are several extant fragments that belong either to this play or to Euripides' earlier play Alcmaeon in Psophis (438 BCE), but the specific play to which they belong cannot be determined definitively or the assignment is not universally agreed upon. Themes Alcmaeon in Corinth was written towards the end of the Peloponnesian War, which Athens was on the verge of losing. The play treats the king and queen of Athens' enemy Corinth negatively. On the other hand Amphilochus, the Argive founder of Athens' Peloponnesian ally Argos, is shown to have been falsely appropriated by Corinth. In popular culture The supposed discovery of a manuscript of the play features as a plot device in the episode \\"The Lions Of Nemea\\" of the British television series Lewis.

According to The New York Times, Bragg was \\"regarded by many as the leading professional deaf actor in the country\\".  Early life and education  Bernard Bragg was born on September 27, 1928, in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Jennie and Wolf Bragg. He grew up learning sign language, which was taught to him by his two deaf parents. From a young age, Bragg demonstrated an interest in theatre, which developed as a result of the influence of his father, who was an amateur actor and play manager. Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Bragg attended the New York School for the Deaf, informally known as \\"Fanwood\\", and entered Gallaudet College (now University) upon graduating in 1947. Whilst attending Gallaudet, Bragg studied theater under a deaf professor named Frederick Hughes, and starred as the lead role in a number of school plays, for which he won numerous honors. Ultimately, Bragg's theatrical activity culminated in his directing of a play, an adaptation of John Galsworthy's Escape. In addition to theater, Bernard Bragg wrote poetry throughout his time in college, earning the Teegarden Award for Creative Poetry in his senior year.  Teaching career, mime, and the founding of the National Theatre of the Deaf  Shortly after graduating from Gallaudet College in 1952, Bragg was offered a teaching position at the California School for the Deaf, Berkeley, which he accepted. While working as a member of the school faculty, Bragg was given the authority to direct drama productions performed by the students of the institution. In addition, Bragg contributed to shows staged by the National Association of the Deaf and the Los Angeles Club of the Deaf outside of school hours. Four years after becoming a teacher, in 1956, Bragg met the world-famous mime Marcel Marceau after seeing one of his shows in San Francisco. Marceau took a liking to the aspiring actor, and offered to teach him mime in France. Bragg accepted the offer, and travelled to Paris at the end of the 1956 school year. Upon returning to the United States, Bragg began performing mime in various locations throughout the state of California while maintaining his career as a teacher. In addition, Bragg enrolled in San Francisco State University, graduating with a master's degree in special education and a minor in drama in 1959. Two years later, in 1961, a New York University psychologist named Dr. Edna Levine petitioned Bragg about the possibility of creating a professional troupe of exclusively deaf actors. Although funding for the concept could not initially be achieved, the project was saved by David Hays, a Broadway set designer, who overtook management for the idea in 1966. In 1967, Bernard Bragg met with Hays and several other performers and individuals involved in the theatre, and together they founded the National Theatre of the Deaf in Connecticut, prompting Bragg to quit his job as a teacher at the California School for the Deaf, a position which he held for 15 years.  Debut on NBC  Shortly after the founding of the NTD, NBC offered to film Bragg and a set of all deaf actors in a 1-hour program special that would serve as a part of the series NBC Experiment in Television. Premiering on April 2, 1967, the special featured Bernard Bragg, Audree Norton, Ralph White, Howard Palmer, Gil Eastman, June Russi, Phyllis Frelich, and Lou Fant as deaf actors. Gene Lasko, Joe Layton, Arthur Penn, and Nanette Fabray were responsible for the script, musical score/choreography, stage direction, and program introduction, respectively. The special was aired nationwide and made history by being the very first televised instance of deaf actors conversing and performing in sign language rather than mime.  Criticism  Prior to its airing in April, the idea for the special faced heavy criticism from The Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, which deemed the program's use of sign language as inappropriate for television.  Career as a director  Bernard Bragg directed numerous plays throughout his lifetime. Tales from a Clubroom, one of his most notable plays, was written in collaboration with Eugene Bergman; it was last performed for a live audience in 2006. In his later years when he moved back to California, Bragg began to teach at California State University Northridge. While working there, he wrote and directed several plays, including To Whom It May Concern; Laugh Properly, Please; and True Deaf. Although most of his productions premiered in the United States, some were adapted for foreign audiences in Germany and China as well. In 2013, Bragg played himself in No Ordinary Hero: The SuperDeafy Movie.

Give me back my language the way it used to be– before linguists “discovered” it and conferred a new name on it. Give me back my language the way I learned from my deaf parents, from their deaf friends, from my teachers, both deaf and hearing. Give me back my language the way I remember how the deaf storytellers role-modeled it to me. Give me back my language without any of those rules, restrictions, impositions, or fixed boundaries that the linguists established for it. Give me back my language that has a great potential for change and growth. Give me back my language which is very much part of who I am. – Bernard Bragg  Honors and awards  *1975 La Decoration au Merite Social International — Premiere Classe, World Federation of the Deaf *1977 Special Tony Award for Theatrical Excellence to the Actors of the National Theatre of the Deaf (NTD Photo with Sidenote by Michael Schwartz) *1986 National Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities *1988 Doctor of Humane Letters, Gallaudet University *1989 The John Bulwer Award, The National Center on Deafness *1990 The Bernard Bragg Artistic Achievement Award, Center on Deafness, Chicago *1997 Honorary Founder's Award, New York School for the Deaf *2001 Special Lifetime Achievement Recognition Award, World Federation of the Deaf, Rome *2006 The Bernard Bragg Humanitarian Award, ICODA *2007 Recognition Award: NTD Founder, Texas Association of the Deaf *2008 Fred C.

The cloud formations coincide with reported cases of Lyme from 2007. Tick entomology After the larvae have fed, they drop off the host and molt to nymphs. The nymphs then overwinter and their activity almost completely ceases until late spring. They emerge the following year in May, June, and July. This emergence is just before the new generation of larvae hatch, allowing the nymphs to transmit tick-borne disease to new generations of hosts. This increases the possibility that the next generation of larvae will also become infected. Nymphs usually attach and feed on small mammals and birds. After feeding, nymphs drop off and molt to adults that will reappear in the fall of the same year. Adults seek medium to large mammalian hosts, primarily deer. Once adulthood is reached, ticks no longer hibernate during the winter and may become active on warm winter days.Stafford III, Kirby C. \\"Tick Management Handbook.\\" Maine Medical Center Research Institute.

Climate The incidence of Lyme disease is tied to many factors including climate. Certain regions worldwide supply the proper conditions for ticks to flourish. Ticks like habitats with at least 85% humidity and can only practice host questing at temperatures greater than . In order to find microclimates that are suitable ticks will use thermoreceptors to detect these proper conditions. One region with especially suitable climate for ticks is the northeastern United States. This region is part of a temperate and humid zoneMajor Biomes Map. Soil climate map, USDA-NRCS, Soil Survey Division, World Soil Resources, Washington D.C. (1999). http://soils.usda.gov/use/worldsoils/mapindex/biomes.html. Accessed 11 Dec. 2011. presenting the ideal conditions for tick survival. Climate change Climate change could affect ticks in a variety of ways. Süss et al. (2008) lists the following as possible changes to tick populations due to increased temperature brought on by global climate change: #an acceleration of the ticks developmental cycle #an extension of the ticks developmental cycle #an increase in egg production #an increase in population density #a shift in risk areas Many of these changes could potentially increase the Lyme disease incidence and pose a threat to human populations, especially in the eastern half of the United States. Rainfall and temperature In addition to climate, seasonal weather variations have a strong effect on tick populations. Changes in temperature and precipitation from year to year affect the Lyme disease incidence. Multiple studies have shown that there is a correlation between the amount of precipitation and the incidence of Lyme disease. After nymph ticks feed on and infect their host with Lyme disease they lose their ability to effectively control their water content. During a year with very little precipitation many ticks may die following feeding because of this loss of water regulatory control.Subak, Susan. Effects of Climate on Variability in Lyme Disease Incidence in the Northeastern United States. American Journal of Epidemiology, Vol. 105, No. 6 (2003): 531–538. These nymph ticks that have died out will never reach adulthood and lay eggs. Two years later their offspring nymph tick population will be reduced and thus Lyme disease incidence will also decrease. Schauber et. Al. (2005) also suggests a similar tie between lagged precipitation as measured by the Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index and Lyme disease incidence in the northeastern United States.Schauber, Eric M. Richard S. Ostfeld and Andrew S. Evans, Jr. What Is the Best Predictor of Annual Lyme Disease Incidence: Weather, Mice, or Acorns? Ecological Applications, Vol. 15, No. 2 (Apr., 2005): 575–586 In addition to direct effects on nymph tick populations summer precipitation may also be a factor for controlling the population of the ticks’ primary host – the white-footed mouse. Decreased rainfall in the summer months may also decrease the amount of vegetation available for mice populations to eat in order to sustain themselves during the winter.Jones, C.J. and U.D. Kitron. Populations of Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae) Are Modulated by Drought at a Lyme Disease Focus in Illinois. Journal of Mecial Entomology, Vol 37, No. 3 (2000): 408–415 It thus follows that a decrease in rainfall may decrease the population of the ticks’ primary host and thus reduce tick populations and Lyme disease incidence. Subak (2003) proposes that a link between human behavior and precipitation could be another factor in Lyme disease incidence. In the northeastern United States when the summer weather is especially hot and dry, it may disincline people from outdoor activity. In fact, Subak (2003) found a link between dry conditions and a decreased Lyme disease incidence during late summer months in the northeast United States. Temperature may also play a role in Lyme disease incidence. Schauber et al. (2005) found a positive correlation between the mean summer temperature and the rate of Lyme disease in the northeastern United States. Additionally, Subak (2003) suggests that there may also be a relationship between warmer winters and increased Lyme disease. This study discovered a tentative link between warmer winter weather lagged one year and Lyme disease incidence. A more moderate winter may increase the survival of the White-footed Mouse host allowing for increased tick populations in the spring and summer. These warmer winter temperatures may also allow for more adult tick activity during winter and cause an increase in nymph populations the following year.

Fox. p.110 The Memorial of the New Mexican Railway Company, in Relation to the Pacific Railroad was introduced by Miguel Antonio Otero in the United States Congress on May 21, 1860. p.437 It was an argument in favor of the southern route for a transcontinental railroad. Arguments over the central vs. southern route were a part of the complex of insoluble relations between states, dating back to James Gadsden's involvement in 1845 (as described in the discussion under the Gadsden Purchase). These arguments contributed to the outbreak of the American Civil War. The New Mexican Railway Company was formed in conjunction with the attempt to retain rights of in-state railroad construction oversight within the Territorial government. The act of incorporation stated that company rights and privileges would be forfeited if construction had not begun within a period of five years. Beginning in 1862, after the outbreak of Civil War, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Central Pacific Railroad of California were granted lands and construction privileges for the First Transcontinental Railroad project under the Pacific Railway Acts. Construction of this Overland Route was begun in 1863 and completed in 1869. The southern route did not become a reality until 1883, when the Southern Pacific Railroad linked New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico with Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean.  Memorial... in Relation to the Pacific Railroad  The Memorial document is an attempt to persuade the U.S. Congress to authorize construction of the first Transcontinental Railroad via a southern route through New Mexico rather than the route that was eventually authorized by the Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864. Several arguments were made in favor of the southern route including preferable weather conditions for operations, shorter distances, lesser grades, proximity to the southern border for military action and for Mexican mineral resources, proximity to southern ports of the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific, and overall cost-benefit savings. Issues of slavery were also discussed in the document. In addition, in the case that the southern route was chosen, the document stressed the rights of the New Mexico Territorial Legislature to oversee and assign land and resources within their territory that would be involved in completion of such a project. The New Mexican Railway Company was incorporated for these purposes. * Bills, on leave, were further introduced as follows, viz: By Mr. Otero: A bill (H. R. 761) to authorize contracts for carrying the mails and troops and naval and military stores on the New Orleans, Opetousas, and Great Western, the Sabine and Rio Grande, the Southern Pacific and New Mexican railways, and for other purposes; which was read a first and second time, and referred to the select committee on the Pacific railroad, and, together with the memorial of the New Mexican Railway Company, ordered to be printed. * The memorial of the undersigned respectfully represents that at their late session the legislature of the Territory of New Mexico passed an act, (a copy whereof is hereto annexed,) incorporating them under the name and style of \\"The New Mexican Railway Company,\\" with authority and privilege \\"to locate, construct, own, and maintain a railway, commencing at such point on the eastern boundary of said Territory as after exploration they may select, and running thence across the entire Territory in the direction of California, upon such route as after survey they may designate, with such branches as they may from time to time construct for the purpose of connecting their said road with any other railroad made or to be made in Mexico or in Texas, or in any adjoining State or Territory.\\" And the said legislature have also \\"granted and transferred to the said New Mexican Railway Company all the right, title, and interest which the Territory of New Mexico has now or may have hereafter in any grant of land made by the United States in aid of the construction of a railroad or of a branch railroad in the Territory of New Mexico, which road or branch road may be made by the said company.\\" * The undersigned, therefore, submit that whatever grants of land or public credit may be given by the government of the United States in aid of the construction of a railroad through New Mexico should be given to them, the said New Mexican Railway Company; and they respectfully protest against the proposition now pending before your honorable body to give to an association of individuals, without authority from the Territory of New Mexico, grants of land and of credit to enable them to construct what is termed a Pacific railway. The report of the Hon. Mr. Curtis, (H. R. No. 428,) and the accompanying bill (No. 646) propose to give to a number of individuals therein named, and to such persons as a majority of those individuals shall admit as their associates, sixty millions of dollars, ($60,000,000,) equal to $33,860 per mile, in aid of the construction of a railway upon the route recommended by the committee. * ...the sum asked for the so-called central route is sixty millions of dollars, with a declaration that the road is to cost one hundred and twenty millions; whereas the Southern Pacific Railroad Company ask but thirty-five millions, and the official estimates show that this difference in the sums asked for is not greater than the difference in the cost of these roads will be. It is therefore apparent, that by making an appropriation in aid of the southern route the government will receive much greater services for a much less sum.  Incorporation Document  It is apparent that the act of incorporation was an attempt to keep the allocation of lands and construction resources for the railroad within NM Territory under the jurisdiction of the Territorial government. The act of incorporation stated that company rights and privileges would be forfeited if construction had not begun within a period of five years. * Section 9. Be it further enacted: That it is hereby made incumbent upon the said company hereby incorporated, to commence actual operations in laying out, locating and grading said road within the limits of the Territory of New Mexico, within five years from and after the passage of this act; and upon their failure to do so, all the rights, privileges and immunities hereby granted to said company are hereby revoked, and this charter to said company is hereby forfeited. * Section 10.

She was married to Helmut Damerius from 1922 to 1927 and later, was married to Wilhelm Koenen. She was a member of the Communist Party of Germany and spent most of the Nazi era outside Germany, in the Soviet Union and other countries. She returned to Germany in December 1945, where she was active in East German women's organizations.  Biographical details  Damerius-Koenen was born Emma Zadach to working class parents in Berlin- Rosenthal. She was one of four children. After attending Volksschule, she took classes at an evening trade school. She then worked as a shop clerk at Heymann & Schmidt GmbH Berlin, an art printer; she was later employed at other printers. In 1922, she and Helmut Damerius were marriedCatherine Epstein (2003), p. 34 Retrieved December 14, 2011 and were active with the Friends of Nature and pacifists. In 1923, she joined the Communist Youth Association of Germany, and in 1924, the Communist Party of Germany (Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands, or KPD). She and Damerius had one child, who died when very young. She and Damerius were divorced in 1927. Until 1934, she worked as a full-time volunteer for the district leadership of the Berlin-Brandenburg KPD, first as a political worker and then as leader of the women's division. After the Nazi Party seized power in 1933, the KPD and other opposition parties were outlawed, making such work illegal. In 1934, learning that she was on a Gestapo list,Catherine Epstein (2003), p. 52 Retrieved December 14, 2011 she went to Moscow and worked in the Women's Secretariat of the Communist International. In 1935 and 1936, she attended the Communist University of the National Minorities of the West in Moscow using her cadre name, Emmy Dublin. She had been living with Leo Scharko, a Polish communist.Catherine Epstein (2003), p. 55 Retrieved December 14, 2011 In 1936, he was arrested in the Great Purge and came back a few weeks later, humorless and tense. Although he didn't reveal much about his confinement, Damerius-Koenen apparently deduced he had agreed to denounce others. After the University was closed, she was sent to work with the Party leadership in Paris, Prague and Zurich. From Paris, she and Scharko corresponded, although with precautions such as invisible ink and cover addresses. Learning that the verity of Scharko's academic background was being challenged because of a lack of documentation in his cadre file, she managed to acquire a copy of the missing degree, which she forwarded to Scharko. Rather than prove his credentials, however, the document was taken as substantiation that Scharko had connections in Nazi Germany, a deadly serious charge in the Soviet Union at that time. As Damerius-Koenen later wrote, \\"Since 1937, there has been no trace of Leo Scharko.\\" She and Wilhelm Koenen were married in 1937 and lived in Prague. In January 1939, they emigrated to England and she worked in London. In 1940, she was interned as an \\"enemy alien\\" on the Isle of Man, where she stayed until her release in February 1941. In 1943, she was a founding member of the Free German Movement (Freie Deutsche Bewegung, or FDB) in London and in 1944, she was one of the initiators of the Women's Commission of the FDB. She and Koenen returned to Germany in December 1945. She worked as an editor in Halle and Dresden. On her return, she was committed to the creation of local Women's Committees and in 1946, she became the vice chairwoman of the Saxon Women's Committee. Damerius- Koenen played a dominant role in the preparatory committee to found the Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands (DFD). She gave the keynote address at the German Women's Congress for Peace, March 7–9, 1947 at the Admiralspalast in Berlin. The Women's Congress was also the founding congress for the DFD, of which, Damerius-Koenen became the vice chair. In April 1948, she replaced the organization's chairwoman, Anne-Marie Durand-Wever, who was not aligned with a political party; Damerius-Koenen was elected chairwoman at the May 29–30, 1948 DFD national congress. Her international experience was helpful in getting the DFD accepted into the Women's International Democratic Federation, which had been established in Paris in 1945 by communists and anti-fascists. In spring 1949, she was forced to relinquish the DFD chair, the result of a 1949 decision by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) regarding western emigration and internal struggles with the SED Women's Secretariat, under the leadership of Elli Schmidt and Käthe Kern. Schmidt became head of the DFD in May 1949. From 1950 to 1958, Damerius-Koenen worked as an editor, team leader and assistant chief editor at the Berlin publishing house, Verlag Die Wirtschaft. After 1958, she worked as a freelance journalist and she worked for her husband until his death in October 1963. She wrote many articles in the women's press of the Soviet occupation zone and many detailed memories regarding the history of the SED and the DFD. Damerius-Koenen died on May 21, 1987 in the Friedrichshagen district of East Berlin and her ashes are buried in the \\"Pergolenweg\\" of the Socialists' Memorial at the cemetery, Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde.

It was released for the Acorn Electron and BBC Micro with an enhanced version for the BBC Master. The game was particularly well received for the Electron as it was the first 3D racing game with corners for that machine. Gameplay Acorn Electron screenshot showing a corner on the Le Mans circuit. The player competes as one of sixty riders in a series of motorbike races held on the real life race circuits Le Mans, Anderstorp, Paul Ricard, Brands Hatch, Misano, Silverstone and the Nürburgring. The player must finish in the top six in order to qualify for the next race. As the race begins, the player's bike is slow to accelerate so the rest of the field speed past. The player must attempt to catch and pass the other racers. The player may also gain bonus points by knocking the other racers off their bikes by side swiping them when the player is slightly in front. If the computer controlled racer is slightly in front when the bikes clash, it will cause the player to slow down. If the player hits the back of another bike, their bike is disabled for a short time.Original instructions, Superior Software Development and release The game was originally conceived as an Acorn Electron car racing game as a follow-up to the hugely successful Overdrive. That game was the only 3D racing game available for the Electron so despite only having straight tracks, became Superior Software's biggest selling game. In late 1986, Superior reissued Acornsoft's BBC Micro only racing simulation Revs and were also working on the Grand Prix Construction Set, set for release in 1987. Neither of these games were able to be converted for the Electron. After completing the shoot 'em up Galaforce, Superior asked Kevin Edwards if he would be interested in writing an Electron racing game.\\"No Cutting Corners On Crazee Rider\\", Kevin Edwards, Electron User #4.12, September 1987 During development, it was decided to change the game to a motorbike racer and to also release it on the BBC Micro. The Electron version runs in a four colour mode with the player able to change the three main colours (the fourth always remaining black). The standard BBC Micro version is virtually identical but runs in an eight colour mode. An enhanced version was included for the BBC Master which included more circuits, extra in-game graphics (including extra animation and different coloured opponents) and music by Martin Galway.Crazee Rider at Computer and Video Game Music The game was released in 1987 on a wide variety of media. It was available on cassette and 5.25\\" DFS floppy disk as well as ADFS 3.5\\" disk for the Acorn Electron Plus 3 and Master Compact.

Reception Electron User called the game \\"superb\\", giving an overall score of 9/10 (with 10/10 for both playability and value for money) with reviewer Joanne Hutcheson concluding \\"Crazee Rider is an exciting game - it's fast, challenging and there's plenty to keep you entertained\\".\\"On Yer Bike!\\", Electron User #4.12, September 1987 A&B; Computing, who concentrated on the BBC Micro, were less impressed, awarding only 7/10. Reviewer Dave Reeder claimed \\"There is nothing here that marks bold new steps into unknown programming areas - the game is solidly put together but is not up to the usual high standard of Superior releases for the Beeb\\".

The edict is thrice mentioned in the Hebrew Bible, each time with minor textual variations and additions. It is presented as authorizing and encouraging the Jews exiled by Nebuchadnezzar to relocate to the Land of Israel and actively engage in rebuilding the temple destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. The historical background of the narrative is confirmed by archaeology, but the edict as such is not corroborated by any finds; its existence as one single legal act, rather than a general policy of repatriation, is contested. Historicity The Cyrus Cylinder, an ancient clay cylinder inscribed with a declaration in the name of Cyrus referring to restoration of temples and repatriation of exiled peoples, has been taken by many scholars as corroboration of the authenticity of the biblical decrees attributed to Cyrus, but other scholars point out that the cylinder's text is specific to Babylon and Mesopotamia and makes no mention of Judah or Jerusalem. Professor Lester L. Grabbe asserted that the \\"alleged decree of Cyrus\\" regarding Judah \\"cannot be considered authentic\\", but that there was a \\"general policy of allowing deportees to return and to re-establish cult sites\\". He also stated that archaeology suggests that the return was a \\"trickle\\" taking place over decades, rather than a single event. Biblical narrative Initial edict The initial text (based on the view that the book of Ezra is a continuum of the text of Second Chronicles chapter 36) of Cyrus's edict: The second mentioning as found in the book of Ezra chapter 1: Challenged by Cuthim The book of Ezra relays how the people of Cutha, known in Hebrew as \\"Cuthim\\" and quoted as the \\"adversaries\\" of the returning exiles, initiated a request to join in the Second Temple construction, and when rebuffed by Zerubbabel and his companions, they spitefully composed a letter of complaint to Artaxerxes of Persia: The commentary work of Rabbi Meïr Weiser (b. March 7, 1809; d. Kiev September 18, 1879) advances the notion that the party of Mithredath Tabeel took advantage of the translation protocol contained in the document issued by Cyrus the Great's government. Essentially the protocol stated that each country in his kingdom was entitled to speak their unique language and pen texts to the king in their native tongue and have the presiding local officers of Artaxerxes of Persia translate the document. Rabbi Weiser continues that Mithredath Tabeel presented a substantial bribe to Rehum the secretary and Shimshai the scribe to have them compose a letter containing an ambiguity that could be interpreted as saying that the post-exile temple builders have varied the kings edict by actively engaging in the construction and fortification of the walls of Jerusalem in an attempt to rebel against the foreign king's rule. The ploy of Mithredath Tabeel and company was successful in leading to a 14-year cessation of all temple building activity in Jerusalem. Darius reconfirms edict Following a second letter sent by the Persian governor asking the king for a decision, the Edict is found in the archives and the king gives his orders accordingly.

Then each fist punches the other's fist. Players who flinch are out of the game. Whoever lasts the longest before quitting wins the game. The game is played until someone's knuckles are bleeding or they quit due to excessive pain.Ghastly Games , accessed July 27, 2011, Chris Lewis editor Variations include simultaneous or alternate punching, and games in which the strike is the loser's punishment/winner's privilege. In the first two ways of playing the game, violence, though essentially consensual, is inherent, not a risk. Almost all ways of playing are dangerous, carrying the risk of injury, scarring, and damage to one's bones and hand. The point is to make them bleed. \\"Bloody knuckles\\" may refer to any game where the loser is punished: punched, slapped, or struck with an object. For example, in the card game, the winner strikes the loser's hand with the deck of cards.Litwack, Geoffrey (2003). Geoffrey Litwack 2002 Annual, p.53. iUniverse. . \\"Winning means the losing player puts their clenched fist on the table, and the winner holding the deck in a steel grip, brings down the edge of the deck as hard as they want on the loser's knuckles.\\"Salamone, Nancy (2010). Victory Over Violence: Nancy's Story and The Business Of Me, p.15. AuthorHouse. . \\"The person with the lowest score wins and gets to 'bloody' the knuckles of the loser by hitting them with the cards.\\" There are different variations of the game. One variation, quarters, where two players use a coin, such as a quarter, that is spun around a flat surface (usually a table). The players continue to keep it spinning by flicking it with their fingers. The other player must touch it without causing it to stop spinning and fall on the heads or tails side. Then the person who spun the coin first tries to touch it next. This turn-taking continues until the coin falls. Whichever player's touch causes the spinning coin to stop and fall down is considered the loser, and they must put their knuckles on the playing surface. Then, the winner puts their thumb on the coin and forcefully pushes it across the table onto the loser's exposed knuckles. Another version includes spinning a coin on a flat surface, then grabbing it with the pad of the players thumb with the thumbs crossed like an x. If the player grabs the coin between the thumbs they rotate spinning until one does not grab the coin. When the player does not grab the coin, the opponent forcefully slides the coin into the losers knuckles with the knuckles flat on the surface with one arm behind if they miss the knuckles.

[ Allen Stone Biography]. AllMusic. Retrieved February 15, 2013.  Early life  Stone was born on March 13, 1987, in Chewelah, Washington, near Spokane. He began his career singing at his father's church. His father was a preacher and his mother was an OB/GYN nurse. He began singing in church at the age of 3. By 14, Stone was leading worship at his church and playing the guitar. The draw of music for Allen was mainly being able to express himself to a crowd of people. Allen did not discover soul music until he was a teenager, and started collecting classic albums from the 1960s and 1970s. He was 15 when he heard Stevie Wonder's 1973 album Innervisions. When Stacie Orrico, a close friend of Allen's as a teen, became successful in music, Stone decided to become serious about his musical career. Orrico released a record and had become successful. \\"She was traveling, singing everywhere, and recording,\\" Stone related. \\"She was just a year older than me and I was like, 'Man that would be so much fun to do, sing and actually have people listen.'\\" When Stone was 18, he moved to Spokane, where he attended community college for a semester followed by a year at Moody Bible Institute in Spokane. After that year, Stone had an epiphany. He stated in an interview with SF Gate, \\"I learned the history of the church and the conception of the Bible and learned about the religion and really just, like, didn't believe it... I got to the point where it was like, 'I don't believe this is the truth.'\\" Not long after, he moved to Seattle to pursue his musical career.  Influences  Stone has been influenced by Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, The Meters, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, Jamie Lidell and James Morrison. The New York Times compared his socially conscious music to the likes of Donny Hathaway, Bill Withers and two of his musical influences Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye.  Career  He has released four records, Last to Speak (2010, self-released), the self-titled Allen Stone (2011, ATO Records), Radius (2015, Capitol Records), and Building Balance (2019, ATO Records). Radius was also re-released by ATO Records in 2016 as a deluxe edition with seven additional tracks. Stone had been touring cross-country for a few years and sold a self- released album on the Internet. However, it was not until October 2011, when his second album was released, that his career began to truly kick off. On this album, he was backed by Raphael Saadiq's rhythm section and Miles Davis' keyboardist Deron Johnson. A few songs on Allen Stone were co-written with Andy Grammer. Allen Stone peaked at the number 2 spot on the R&B;/Soul charts on iTunes and hit number 9 and number 35 on the Billboard Heatseekers and R&B;/Hip Hop Album charts, respectively.

Allen Stone said of the album title, \\"The radius is that line extending from the center of the circle to its exterior, and in a lot of ways this album is about getting out things deep inside—whether it's love or insecurity or joy or frustration about things going on today.\\" On March 25, 2016, Radius was re-released as a deluxe edition by ATO Records with seven additional tracks. On April 13, 2017, Stone's song \\"Perfect World\\" was featured on the trailer for the upcoming Netflix series Dear White People.

A live music video of \\"Unaware – Allen Stone – Live From His Mother's Living Room\\" on Stone's YouTube account has been viewed over 7,000,000 times. Stone wanted to have a different and weird setting for this video, so they recorded it on a set that looked like a living room.

However, the most popular version of the band was the line-up that existed from 1965 to 1967, and which recorded the songs \\"No Friend of Mine\\" and \\"Hipsville 29 B. C.\\" History The first line- up of the Sparkles consisted of Stanley Smith and Carl Huckaby on guitars, Bob Donnell on bass, Johnny Waller on piano, brothers Jesse and Guy Balew on saxophone and vocals, and Gary Blakey on drums. The band made their first recording in 1958 for legendary record producer Norman Petty (who also worked with Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison), but the recording went unreleased. This line-up broke up shortly thereafter and reformed with Gary Blakey on drums, Charlie Hatchett and Stanley Smith on guitars, and an unknown bassist. The band line-up changed again when drummer Harold \\"Lucky\\" Floyd, bassist Bobby Smith, and guitarist Donnie Roberts joined the group, with Hatchett leaving to form his own group, The Raiders, along with Blakey. This line-up, the third, became quite popular locally and started playing in clubs in west Texas. Due to disagreements among the band members, this line-up also broke up. Harold \\"Lucky\\" Floyd and Bobby Smith then recruited Louie Holt, Gary P. Nunn, and the drummer Jimmy Marriott, resulting in the fourth line-up having two drummers, although Floyd would sometimes sing. Nashville record producer Larry Parks offered to sign the band to Hickory Records. The band agreed and released the 1966 single \\"The Hip\\", which became a major hit in Austin. Soon thereafter, the songs \\"Something That You Said\\" and \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" were recorded. All of these recordings were done in Odessa, Texas, at Tommy Allsup's Westex Studio. The following year, the band recorded \\"No Friend of Mine\\" and \\"Hipsville 29 B. C.\\" in Nashville, Tennessee. When Nunn and Holt decided to quit the band, around 1968, Floyd, Smith, and Marriott relocated to California and changed the band's name to the Pearly Gate, making a handful of appearances in a television series called Judd, for the Defense. They later returned to Austin and reformed the Sparkles and it was during this period that Steve Weisberg, future guitarist of The John Denver Band, joined the band. The Sparkles finally disbanded in 1972, with Floyd returning to California to play with Red Wilder Blue. A number of commentators, including author Jeff Jarema, have noted that during the band's almost fifteen years of existence and various different line-ups, the version of the group that made the name the Sparkles best known was the fourth line-up, which recorded the \\"Hipsville 29 B. C.\\" and \\"No Friend of Mine\\" singles. Over the years, songs by the band have appeared on several various artists compilations: \\"The U.T.\\" appeared on Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 17, \\"I Want to Be Free\\" was included on Turds On A Bum Ride, Vol. 1, and \\"Hipsville 29 B. C.\\" has appeared on Mayhem & Psychosis, Vol. 2 and Garage Beat '66, Vol. 1. In addition, \\"No Friend of Mine\\" has appeared on the 1998 Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965–1968 box set, the CD version of Pebbles, Volume 1, Songs We Taught The Fuzztones, Garage Beat '66, Vol. 1, Uptight Tonight: Ultimate 60's Garage Collection, Acid Dreams: Testament, Trash Box, Best of Pebbles, Vol. 1, and Ear-Piercing Punk.

She was built in 1922 by Harland & Wolff Ltd, in Govan, Glasgow. Her sister ship TSS Veendam was built by Harland & Wolff the following year. She operated on transatlantic routes between Europe and the USA, sailing the Rotterdam – New York and Rotterdam – Halifax (Nova Scotia) service. Her overall length was and her beam was . She had two funnels and two masts. Four steam turbines drove twin screws, giving her a speed of . Passenger accommodation was divided into three classes and initially configured as: 263 in First class, 436 in Second class and 1,200 in Third class. She was purchased by Holland America Line while under construction, and launched on 6 July 1922. Her maiden voyage started on 4 November 1922 sailing from Rotterdam to New York. In May 1926 she was refitted to carry First, Second, Tourist and Third class passengers, and by April 1930 changed yet again to carry First, Tourist and Third class. Her last Rotterdam – New York voyage commenced 5 April 1940. Therefore she managed to escape before the Netherlands was overrun and surrendered to the Germans in the May of 1940. War service She was among many Allied merchant ships who escaped to Britain rather than be interned in occupied countries in World War II. Together with Holland America Line's she served in the Allied cause. She was then chartered to the British Ministry of War Transport and put into service. Under the terms of the charter the flag and crew would remain Dutch. Volendam was assigned to the Children's Overseas Reception Board, a British Government scheme introduced in 1940 to evacuate UK school children overseas. She sailed from Liverpool on Thursday 29 August 1940 as one of 33 ships in Convoy OB 205. Her Master was Captain J.P. Wepster and she had a crew of 273. She carried 879 passengers: 320 children with their escorts and 286 other passengers. She was also the convoy Commodore ship with Admiral G.H. Knowles aboard. On 30 August 1940 whilst several hundred miles off Malin Head, Northern Ireland and heading into the Atlantic, she was attacked about 2300 hrs by the , firing two torpedoes that hit No. 1 hold and damaged and caused flooding in No. 2 hold. Captain Wepster then gave the order to abandon ship, and despite rough seas all 18 lifeboats got away safely. It was night-time and pitch-black. The only person lost was the 51-year-old Dutch purser Rijk Baron, who, as he was climbing down a rope ladder to one of the boats received a blow to the head from a swinging pulley, knocking him unconscious, causing him to fall into the sea and drown. A few weeks later his body washed up on the Scottish islet of Gunna (between the Inner Hebridean islands of Tiree and Coll) and he was buried in a churchyard on Tiree.‘Het Verhaal Van De Purser’ (The Pursers Story), BBC The passengers and children were quickly rescued by other merchantmen in the convoy, including the British oil tankers Bassethound (), and Valldemosa (), the Norwegian cargo ship Olaf Fostenes () (which rescued 231 survivors, including 75 children), and S-class destroyer . They were taken to Greenock and other west coast ports in Scotland on 1 September. All 320 children were rescued.Memories of nighttime U-boat attack on SS Volendam in August 1940, Essex Chronicle, January 20, 2014 The Gourock Times, dated 6 September 1940, reported the event under the headlines British Evacuee Ship Torpedoed, announced how cheerful the children had been and that their Ordeal Was a Great Adventure.Newspaper Article about torpedoing of SS Volendam, BBC While the children had been selected from all over the country, 74 were from Scotland. Some children were later sent overseas again a few weeks later on the ill-fated . A curious fact only emerged long after the war (details revealed in book published in 2014, Oceans Apart: Stories of Overseas Evacuees in World War Two, author Penny Starns). One child on board the Volendam, only referred to as Robert, a nine years old from Glasgow, was asleep throughout the entire ships evacuation, and only appeared to the surprised skeleton crew on board, after the rest of the children and escorts had all been evacuated to life- boats. He was transferred to a destroyer, and on landing, he and his parents were sworn to secrecy. https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish- news/revealed-story-nine-year-old-boy-left-3058981 Volendam was taken in tow by the rescue tug and beached on the Isle of Bute. Later she was re-floated and repaired at a Clyde shipyard. When the damage was surveyed an unexploded second torpedo was found embedded in her bow. The U-boat had fired a spread of two torpedoes with a short interval; the detonation of the first may have blown off the warhead of the second torpedo. The ship was converted to a troop transport and returned to service in July 1941. She was used to ferry troops to North Africa in 1942 and for the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, returning to North Africa with Italian and German prisoners. In 1944 she transported many US soldiers to northern France and continued until 1945. During this time she had carried over 100,000 troops. Post-war Volendam returned to Rotterdam in July 1945, she was partly reconditioned. In August 1945, she carried British troops to Palestine – including the 3rd Battalion of Coldstream Guards. The ship landed at Haifa. In 1946 she carried Dutch troops to what was then the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). In 1947 she was used in the Australia emigrant service and in June 1948 made her first Rotterdam – Quebec sailing for the Netherlands government with capacity for 1,500 single class passengers. On Tuesday October 17 1950 she departed Rotterdam for Sydney, arriving 6-weeks and 1 day later at her destination on Wednesday November 29th, 1950. She brought with her a ship-load of (mainly Dutch) immigrants, all eager to forge new lives in Australia. In September 1948 she started her first Rotterdam – New York sailing and commenced her last voyage on this route in February 1951. In October 1951 she made her last Rotterdam – Quebec – Rotterdam voyage and in 1952 was scrapped at Hendrik Ido Ambacht.

She wrote the autobiography Growing Up Deaf with the help of her friend Judy Jonas, which tells her the story of her life as a Deaf woman. This book was self-published through Xlibris. She is a prominent member of the Deaf Community and has won many awards for her efforts including the Fred Schreiber Golden Hands award. Early life Rose Pizzo was born in Queens, New York, in 1932 during the Great Depression. She has an older sister by 13 months named Frances and a younger brother named Vincent. After her birth, her family moved from Queens to New Dorp, Staten Island because her parents could no longer afford to live in the city. However, her father had a shoemaking business in Queens and because the commute became too difficult, the family moved back to Queens for a short time. They moved to Corona and eventually settled in East Elmhurst. She was born to a hearing family and though she did not become Deaf until age three, she has no recollection of hearing. She was sent to a mainstream kindergarten where she had no means of communication and was held back for two years. Then at age 8, she attended a public school for the deaf in Manhattan called P.S. 47. It was there that Pizzo first learned American Sign Language although the curriculum taught at P.S. 47 focused on writing and lip-reading skills and discouraged sign language, she picked it up from her peers. After P.S. 47, she attended Mabel Deaf Vocational High School, which was a mainstream program. No services were provided for Pizzo in the form of an interpreter or note taker so she was forced to lip-read in all her classes. She was able to pass by studying hard but eventually focused her studies in the vocational part of the school and studied sewing and dress-making. Career Rose's first job out of high school was as a sewing machine operator where she worked for two years although she hated the job. She then worked as a Data Entry Operator for many years. In 1978 she was one of the first students to attend the Adult Basic Education Program for the Deaf in Fair Lawn and received her high school equivalency diploma. After she graduated, she became a teacher's aide at the same school and held the position for over twenty years. She has also taught American Sign Language to hearing adults at the Fair Lawn Community School since the mid 80's. Pizzo has been an active member of the North Jersey Community Center for the Deaf (NJCCD) and served on their Women's Auxiliary Group. She was appointed by the Governor to serve on the NJ Division of the Deaf Advisory Council. Pizzo also became very involved with the Union County College interpreting program and helped many students improve their interpreting skills. As a result, she was present with the Claudia Parson's Award by UCC for involvement in the Deaf community. She is also the recipient of the Fred Schreiber Golden Hands award. Personal life Rose Pizzo first met her husband Vincent Pizzo when she was 7 years old on the bus going to their school for the Deaf P.S. 47. Their first date was not until 1950 when she was 18 and he was 24 and they were married on June 8, 1952. Vincent also was raised by hearing parents but unlike Rose, many of his siblings are also Deaf. They raised 3 children in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Their oldest child Nancy was born in Barnet Hospital in 1956. Their daughter Karen was born in 1958 and their son Paul was born in 1962. They also have three grandchildren named Michelle, Vinnie, and Dominic. Growing Up Deaf (autobiography) Rose Pizzo was encouraged to write a book about her life by her daughter-in-law Linda, who was fascinated with Rose's life as well as Deaf Culture. She originally struggled while writing the book in English because American Sign Language is her native language. To solve this problem, she asked her friend and founder of the Adult Basic Education Program for the Deaf in Fair Lawn, Judy Jonas for help. Rose told her story to Judy who interpreted it onto an audio tape. The tape was them transcribed and Judy edited and translated it into English. The book begins by talking about Rose's life growing up and childhood memory such as the story her Aunt away told about her birth, vacations her family took, and holidays. The book also describes her education growing up and her lack of language until she attended a school for the Deaf. In fact Rose did not even know her own name until she attended this school at age 8. When she was attending a hearing kinder garden, Rose describes how she had no communication and was picked on by other students. She goes into detail about the communication issues she faced throughout her entire life. Such as asking a family member question about what was going on and either getting a summary of the information or told nothing at all; like when one of her favorite cousins died. When she began her education at a Deaf school Rose described the experience as “the beginning of my life as a Deaf Person” (Pizzo). American Sign Language was forbidden at this school and hands were slapped for signing but she learned from other students and from the first time had access to real communication. The book also includes several stories of her friend's family's rejections of ASL. Rose's parents never had a problem with ASL although they were ignorant of the Deaf world and she was forced to wear hearing aids. The book also provides cultural information about Deaf people, such as the importance of name signs and how they are chosen as well as explaining the benefits TTY's and captioning had on the Deaf community.

Testing Center  The AFSF periodically administers language proficiency exams including the TCF, ESIT and DAFLE .  Celebration  The Alliance Française de San Francisco will celebrate its 130th anniversary on October 17, 2019.  History  In the aftermath of the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, France's image began to decline, while that of Germany was enhanced. To counteract this, a number of prominent French citizens met in Paris in 1883 to create an association promoting French language, culture, and history. The new Alliance Francaise soon became an organization embodying the French Republican ideal of meritocracy.  Birth of the French community in San Francisco  After the Gold Rush began, San Francisco grew in population from 800 in 1847 to 23,000 in 1852, while the French population grew to more than 20,000 statewide. Emigration to California was spurred by the government-created Loterie des Lingots d'or, a project to send unwanted individuals to San Francisco as gold seekers. In addition, after the 1851 coup d'état by Napoleon III, many people were exiled to California. In later years, around 120,000 immigrants from Béarn or Basque country arrived in America between 1820 and 1926; many settled in San Francisco Bay Area.  History of the Alliance of San Francisco  The San Francisco chapter was founded in 1889, supported by the Société Française de Bienfaisance Mutuelle. The Ligue Nationale Française made a donation in the 1890s of 12,000 books, some still held by the organization to this day. The first French classes were held at 414 Mason street; by 1904, the association had 800 members and offered 28 types of classes with 600 students. The 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed the building's foundations and many students were killed. In 1910, only 550 students were registered, growing to 700 three years later. The AFSF also developed the Débat Joffre (Joffre Debate) to organize a verbal jousting forum for students from Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley, debates which were made independent of the AFSF in 1949. The 1950s was a relatively prosperous period in which new technologies were available, including long-playing records and weekly French movie screenings. Two satellite chapters in Redwood City and Palo Alto were established, and in 1972 the AFSF's executive director developed a \\"Junior Alliance\\". The AFSF reached a thousand members and students, maintaining strong links with sister chapters in Berkeley, Saratoga and Monterey. In the 1980s the AFSF joined the Ligue Henri IV, an association created in 1895 by the large Béarnais community in San Francisco. In 1982, the AFSF relocated to a building on Bush Street owned by the Ligue and designed in 1910 by prominent Bay Area architect Willis Polk.

The building is famous for its unique style of New Zealand Victorian.Waitomo Caves Hotel  Paranormalknowledge.com December 2011  History   Background  In response to the increasing numbers of tourists that began visiting the Waitomo Caves in the late nineteenth century early cave explorer and tour guide Tane Tinorau Opataia together with his wife constructed a house in 1901 when they converted to provide tourist accommodation in 1904 calling it Waitomo House. In that same year the Government nationalised the caves using the Public Works Act. In 1905 the Tourist and Health Resorts Department purchased Waitomo House and its success under their ownership persuaded them to commission a more modern replacement from the Public Works Department. The building was designed by John Campbell who at the time was the architect-in- charge of the Public Buildings Division of the Public Works Department.  Construction and development  Despite being designed during the Edwardian period Campbell looked back to the previous century for influence designing a two-storeyed shiplap weatherboard asymmetric building with none of the four facades the same. On two facades it had continuous verandas on both the ground and first floor levels. There was a two-storeyed bay window on the rounded corner. The bay is continued beyond the corrugated iron roof to form an impressive octagonal turret which has an eight-sided pavilion roof. Multiple chimneys puncture the roof. Despite its apparent size the hotel only had six guest bedrooms. The other rooms were an office/reception, kitchen, dining room and staff rooms. Tents were however available to accommodate more guests (though these may not have very comfortable on cold winter nights). The timber used in its construction was transported into the area on horse-drawn carts. As it was remote from town water and power supplies water was pumped from the Waitomo Stream and fed back up the slope to the hotel, while electricity was generated by a dynamo powered by a petrol driven motor engine. Completed in 1908 the building which is positioned upon an escarpment overlooking the village was originally called the “Government Hostel at Waitomo” and is today known as the “The Victorian Wing”.  Extension  By the mid 1920’s the hotel was proving to be too small to accommodate the increasing number of visitors to the Waitomo caves. As a result it was enlarged between 1927 and 1928 by adding a two-storeyed plastered reinforced concrete tiled roof extension which is now called the “Art Deco Wing”. This extension was designed by the Government Architect John Mair. In line with the Art Deco style of the period Mair incorporated architectural influences from many sources with the thick concrete walls, decks and patios being in the Spanish Mission style of the Spanish missionary settlements in California while the concrete pillars and facades are in the Cape Dutch style often seen in South Africa. The result was in sharp contrast with the earlier building. As well as a large kitchen and dining room the extension added another 24 bedrooms to the hotel which allowed the hotel to accommodate up to one hundred quests. None of the new rooms had bathrooms and most were very small.  Change of ownership  Ownership passed to the Tanetinorau Opatai Trust in the 1980s as part of a Waitangi Treaty settlement. The trust subsequently leased the hotel to the Taharoa Tourism management group which markets the hotel as part of its Wellesley Hotels and Resorts portfolio. By 2012 the hotel was due for a planned $3.5 million refurbishment with approximately 20 of the hotel's 45 rooms not up to a suitable occupancy standard, which was contributing to tourists staying in Rotorua rather than in Waitomo. However the Tanetinorau Opatai Trust, was not in a position to fund the work as it had not received any income for seven years from its 51% share of the Waitomo Caves tourism operation. This was due to a long-running dispute between the descendants of Tane Tinorau Opataia which put distribution of the revenue to the trust on hold while the dispute was heard in the Maori Land Court, before being referred to the Maori Appellate Court. Despite the case funding of a refurbishment began in June 2014. The case was resolved in favour of the trust in 2015, which freed up eight years of accumulated revenue.  Registration as a historic place  Because the hotel represents the work of two different eras of Government architecture and is a fine example of the respective styles of its two architects it was registered under the Historic Places Act 1980 as a Category 2 Historic Place on 28 June 1990.  Claimed hauntings  According to stuff.co.nz, Waitomo Caves Hotel is the fourth most haunted spot, and the most haunted hotel, in New Zealand. There have been claims of bathtubs dripping blood, orbs bouncing around the driveway and a Māori princess stalking the corridors.

Biography The Solomon Warner House in Tucson, Az.Ruins of the Solomon Warner Mill Warner was born in Warnerville, New York on February 8, 1811. When he was 26, he went to work on river boats plying the Mississippi River. In 1849 he joined the California Gold Rush, moving to Sonora, California. Two years later he journeyed to the Isthmus of Panama before taking work in Nicaragua. In 1853, Warner moved to San Francisco, California and his work as a mason for the Quartermaster Corps took him to Fort Yuma on January 13, 1855. While at Fort Yuma, Warner became involved with two merchants, William F. Hooper and Francis Hinton. This association led him to lead a 13-mule train loaded with merchandise for Tucson. He arrived in the settlement on February 29, 1856, eleven days before Mexican troops permanently withdrew from the area in accordance with the terms of the Gadsden Purchase. Upon his arrival he purchased plots of land within the town limits. Warner then partnered with Mark Aldrich in opening a store, becoming the town's first merchant to sell goods originating from the United States. Warner, known as \\"Don Solomon\\" to the Mexican locals, initially prospered in his role as a shopkeeper. This changed after the beginning of the American Civil War. When Confederate troops arrived in Tucson, Warner refused to take a loyalty oath. This resulted in his property being seized and Warner being forced to flee town. He spent the war in Santa Cruz, Sonora where he met and married a wealthy widow. Following the war, Warner returned to Tucson where his wife's money allowed him to expand his business ventures. During a journey from Santa Cruz to Tucson on January 29, 1870, he was wounded by Apache and permanently crippled. Between 1874 and 1875 he built a flour mill and small dam along the Santa Cruz river. He was also involved in farming and cattle ranching. The flour mill proved to be unprofitable and he shut it down in 1881. He spent his final years attempting to build a perpetual motion machine. His obsession with this effort was such that he neglected to eat and sleep properly in order to spend more time on the venture. Warner died from cancer in Tucson on November 14, 1899. He is buried in Tucson's Holy Hope Cemetery. Tucson's Warner Street, also known as Warner Alley, is named in his honor. In May 2018 a pair of jeans owned by him sold for almost $100,000.

Her areas of expertise and coverage include the Middle East and North Africa, terrorism, national security, the Arab Spring, global Christian persecution, human rights, cyber security, and more. She was invited to show her documentary film about an Iranian underground political movement in Congress. She frequently is called upon to give briefs and expert testimony for government and private entities. Daftari has worked for a number of think tanks in Washington, where she has written exclusive reports for the Pentagon and other government groups. Early life Daftari was born in New Jersey to Sean and Simin Daftari. Her father is a physician and college professor, and her mother has a background in language and accounting. Her parents are Iranian Jews who met in United States and married in Iran. She grew up in Bergen County, the second of four Daftari children. Daftari attended Jewish school and finished high school at a private Jewish school in New Jersey. Lisa graduated from Rutgers University New Brunswick with a B.A. in Spanish, Middle Eastern studies, and vocal performance. She went on to receive her masters degree in broadcast journalism at the Annenberg School of Journalism at the University of Southern California, where she was awarded a Presidential Merit Scholarship.

Sometime thereafter they offered her multiple alternate dates to return, which she refused, as she felt that Rutgers had mischaracterized the issue. It was claimed that she had said, “Islamic terror takes its guidance and teachings from the Quran, which is Sharia law,” whereas she had actually said “Islamic terror CLAIMS to take its teachings from the Quran.” Career In 2006, while in graduate school, Daftari was invited to show her thesis documentary film about an underground Iranian political group, Marze Por Gohar, to Congress. During that time, she worked as an associate producer in the investigative unit at NBC in Los Angeles. While at NBC, she helped break the story about the 2005 Los Angeles bomb plot, in which Jamiyyat Ul-Islam Is-Saheeh, an Islamist prison gang, planned to bomb prominent Los Angeles sites. In 2007, after graduating, Daftari left NBC to work as a researcher for several think tanks focusing on the Middle East and counterterrorism. She attended several hearings on Iran divestment in the California State Assembly. At the end of that year, she delivered a 100-page report about Iranian youth movements to the Pentagon.

It was introduced in the Greater Dublin area in 2011 for Luas, DART, Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Bus, but acceptance has significantly expanded. Initially, Leap Cards offered only a pre-paid electronic wallet system for single-trip fares; since May 2014, it has also been possible to load it with weekly, monthly and annual subscriptions. In September 2017, there were over 2.5 million Leap Card users according to the National Transport Authority. The Leap Card is the result of many years' work by the Railway Procurement Agency and the National Transport Authority as part of the rollout of an integrated ticketing scheme for public transport in Dublin city. Fares are generally discounted compared to cash prices, and limited integrated ticketing is offered via multi-trip discounts and daily fare caps. The minimum top-up for the card is currently €5. History The Railway Procurement Agency, now part of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, was responsible for the development of light railway and metro infrastructure and developing an integrated smart card system. First plans were made at the end of the last century and initially it was planned to introduce an integrated card when the Luas system would start to operate in 2004 or 2005. The development of the new system had many delays and setbacks, including the withdrawal of all three bidders in a 2005 tender; and the costs for the new system were far higher than budgeted.Irish Independent on Integrated smart-card, 4 April 2006, visited 29 January 2012 This led to the development of the Leap card platform from scratch; with the first cards becoming available to the general public in December 2011. Prior to this, both Luas and Iarnród Éireann (in the Greater Dublin Area only) had rolled out their own, non-interoperable smartcard systems with both e-purse and long-term period pass options in 2005 and 2010 respectively.New smart card limited to Luas Additionally, Dublin Bus started providing long-term period passes on smartcards from 2009 but did not offer an e-purse option. Smartcard tickets were generally slightly cheaper than cash fares on these systems, but without any consistency or any multi-operator offerings. The reader infrastructure installed at tram stops, rail stations and buses from this period was all physically compatible with the Leap system when introduced and did not need replacement. Initially, only discounted cash fare equivalents were offered; but the ability to load period passes to the card was added in 2013 with all Taxsaver products converted from paper or the operators' prior smartcards by 2014.https://www.leapcard.ie/_uploads/TaxSaver%20Leap%20Card%20Information.pdf The fully integrated ticketing element of the project has not been fully delivered as of 2019. Greater Dublin Area fare capping was introduced for single operators in 2012https://luas.ie/assets/files/RPA%20Marketing%20Campaign/Leap%20Card%20Luas%20Capping%20FAQs.pdf with a multi-operator cap introduced in 2013.https://www.nationaltransport.ie/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Leap-Card- Multi-Operator-Capping1.pdf A further step towards the planned 90-minute all- mode fare was introduced in 2015, with the Leap90 discount of €1 on each journey within 90 minutes of a prior journey.https://www.nationaltransport.ie/bus-forms/leap-card-now- offering-e1-off-for-second-journeys-within-90-minutes-on-dublin-bus-luas- dartcommuter-rail The Leap platform has also been used for the rollout of the Public Services Cards, allowing the replacement of the paper (rural) or paper + cardboard photocard (Dublin) Free Travel Pass for older people and those with disabilities. This removes the need to get a paper concessionary ticket issued for many rail journeys, reduces fraud opportunities and allows for the cancellation of passes.  Using the Leap Card  Anonymous Leap cards can be purchased at Payzone outlets or from certain Luas or Irish Rail ticketing machines. A new card will cost €10 and that card will have an initial credit of €5. Value from an existing smart-card cannot be transferred onto a Leap Card, but it was possible to get a free Leap Card for holders of the 'old' Luas or Rail smart-cards until 30 September 2014.Leapcard website Home page, visited 29 January 2012 Personalised cards for use with period tickets are provided free-of-charge but without any credit. Customers can only use the card for e-purse transactions when the card is in credit; although a fare can bring the card to a negative balance of up to -€5. Cards can be topped-up via Payzone outlets, or any Luas or Irish Rail ticketing machines, They can also be anonymously topped up, and recent ticket history viewed, using an Android application on a NFC-enabled smartphone.Leap Top-Up App It is also possible to reload a card using the Leap Card website, but it must then be registered online.Top-Up my leapcard on leapcard.ie, and the top-up must be uploaded to the card at a specified collection point or via the Leap Top-Up App. When a Leap Card is registered, the cardholder can check their travel/purchase history online, but the card is no longer anonymous. Transport operators Acceptance has extended beyond the original three operators, and now covers *Ashbourne Connect *Bus Éireann - all non-Expressway services *City Direct *Collins Coaches *Dualway Coaches - certain scheduled services *Dublin Bus *Go-Ahead Ireland *Iarnród Éireann - Greater Dublin and Cork Commuter services, point to point period passes *JJ Kavanagh - Route 139 *Liffey Ferry *Matthews Coaches *Swords Express *Wexford Bus  Current capabilities  The capabilities of the card have been extended to reach almost all groups. The following are currently in operation: :* Transfer rebates: when a journey includes several modes of transport (where one has to pay individually for each) a \\"transfer rebate\\" is credited to the card. This scheme was introduced on 1 November 2014. :* Monthly and yearly passes. All the former Dublin Bus tickets were migrated to the Leap Card as well as the Luas year-passes and monthly Tax-Saver subscriptions. This process was completed in May 2014. :* Special fares for students and schoolchildren. This scheme was completed on 1 August 2014 with the new Personalised Child Leap Card for children 16 to 18 years of age. This card expires on the child's 19th birthday. Children from the age of 4 to the age of 15 use an Anonymous Child Leap Card. In August 2018, University College Dublin Students' Union suspended the sale of student Leap cards due to data privacy concerns.  Technical detail  The Leap Card uses a chip inside the card that can be read from and written to without direct contact: a so-called proximity card or RFID card. The original LuasEoin Bailey website: Mifare classic on Luas smart card, visited 29 January 2012 and Iarnród ÉireannBoards.ie Are the Leap Card and the IR Smartcard the same thing?, visited 30 January 2012 cards used the MIFARE classic card, which became notorious because of the ease with which they can be hacked into.Chaos Computer Club presentation Little Security despite obscurity, visited 30 January 2012 Because of the security concerns of the Mifare classic the company that designed the card, NXP Semiconductors, have developed RFID cards that use a better encryption method. The RPA has not disclosed which card is being used for the Leap Card but scanning the card with a generic RFID reader shows it as a MIFARE DESFire EV1 (in detail: cardtype=ISO/IEC 14443-4 Smart Card, Mifare DESFire EV1 (MF3ICD41)).Triple RFID card-scan, scanned and retrieved: 19 September 2012 The terminals used in Dublin Bus (both the bus- driver terminal as well as the right-hand card reader), are made by Mifare/NXP and the 'pole terminals' are also made by Mifare (as the original Luas smart card is a Mifare classic). While the Leap Card is a MiFare DESFire EV1, the standard (carton/paper) Dublin bus RFID tickets were using MiFare Ultralight (Type A (ISO/IEC 14443 Type A)) while the Rail Smart Card (Dublin short-hop zone) from Iarnród Éireann used the Mifare Classic 1k. The Leap Card system has cost €55 million to date. However, since its launch in December 2011, it has had a turnover of €263 million as of April 2015. Later on, the National Transport Authority sought a partner to operate the Leap Card system on the authority’s behalf. The partner would have to pull together the myriad facets required to operate the ITS, handling the complexities associated with the core financial process management (FPM), Contact Centre and card management functions. The National Transport Authority ended choosing DXC Technology. The IT Services and Solutions company currently outsources NTA’s integrated ticketing back-office operations, IT management, retail network and web portal delivery.

It is encoded by the P87050 2247 bp ORF on the cosmid 57A10. The protein is 775 amino acids in length. Cdr2 is a member of the GIN4 family of kinases, which prevent progression of mitosis if there is a problem with septin. The N-terminus contains a sequence characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinase activity. The C-terminus, while non-catalytic, is necessary for proper localization of Cdr2 during interphase. Cdr2 null constructs behave similarly to wild-type constructs; the only difference being a slight delay into mitosis and consequently, cells are slightly larger than in wild-type constructs. Therefore, Cdr2 is non-essential. Cdr2 regulates mitotic entry through direct inhibition of Wee1, which is then unable to continue to Cdk1 and subsequently start mitosis.  Cell localization  During interphase (G1, S, G2), Cdr2 is localized in a wide medial band that is centered on the nucleus. The C-terminus is required for correct localization; cleavage of any number of residues close to the carboxy terminus results in abnormal distribution. Pom1 phosphorylates Cdr2 on the C-terminus, and prevents it from spreading beyond the medial band. The width of the cortical band increases proportionately with the length of the growing cell; the final limit is at approximately 30% of the total cell length before the cell enters mitosis. When the cell enters mitosis, Cdr2 is distributed diffusely through the cytoplasm; there is no detectable cortical band in metaphase in anaphase. During septation at the end of anaphase, Cdr2 localizes to the contractile ring. After cytokinesis, Cdr2 is again distributed in a broad medial band centered on the nucleus. Regulation of Mitotic Entry Figure 1: Accepted Model for Cdr2's indirect promotion of mitotic entry. Cdr2 is suppressed by Pom1, and is unable to phosphorylate Wee1 to activate CDK1. Pom1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that localizes to the cell tips. It is a partial mechanism for the formation of the medial distribution of Cdr2 in the cell; Pom1 has been demonstrated to prevent Cdr2 from diffusing into the non- growing end of the cell in interphase. As seen in figure 1, Pom1 directly inhibits Cdr2. This is done through phosphorylation of Cdr2 on a residue between 423 and 532 on the non-catalytic C-terminus. Once phosphorylated, Cdr2 is unable to inhibit the kinase Wee1, which is then able to maintain CDK1 in a hyper-phosphorylated state incapable of progression into mitosis. Mutation and deletion of Cdr2 result in a delay into mitotic entry, leading to larger cells. However, the cells still enter mitosis, presumably because Cdr2 is the link in only one pathway that couples cell length to mitotic entry. Thus, Cdr2 is non-essential to the decision to enter mitosis. Interaction with Pom1 Gradient Figure 2: Difference in Pom1 and Cdr2 overlap in small cells and big cells. Pom1 is distributed in a gradient from the cell tips, with the maximum concentration in the cell tips and the lower concentrations in the medial region of the cell, roughly overlapping with the wide medial band occupied by Cdr2. In small cells, there is a higher level of overlap between Pom1 and Cdr2, leading to a greater degree of inhibition of Cdr2; conversely Cdr2 is unable to inhibit Wee1, which is then free to inhibit CDK1. Therefore, Cdr2 functions as part of a cell-size sensor pathway. In larger cells, there is much lower degree of overlap between Pom1 and Cdr2, allowing Cdr2 to inhibit Wee1; CDK1 is then able to promote mitotic entry.

An English-language feature film shot and set in Montreal, it is the debut feature film from Canadian director B. P. Paquette, and also features in supporting roles Micheline Lanctôt, Harry Hill, and Darryl Hunter. Presented at numerous film festivals in countries from around the world, and honoured with prizes and accolades, A Year in the Death of Jack Richards absolutely polarized critics when it was released in commercial theatres. A Year in the Death of Jack Richards is the first panel in Paquette's triptych on the psychology of romantic love, followed by The Woman of Ahhs: A Self- Portrait by Victoria Fleming (2008), and The Anonymous Rudy S. (2016). Production Paquette has discussed two avenues that led to the development of his story. The first was that of an old European legend, circa 15th century, of religious sects scooping up individuals to be cared for by the group for a year before being killed. The second is closer to Paquette's past. \\"I came to film school, Concordia University's Mel Hoppenheim School of Cinema, to do my Bachelor's and while I was there I got to know the director of the program. He was this old Polish guy, single, very kind of gruff,\\" Paquette says. \\"I loved him to death. He was the smartest film guy I ever had and I didn't know a lot of people in Montreal so I took to hanging out with him. He wouldn't really open up to a lot about his past but you'd get little bits of it and you start to piece it together. He'd given up a lot in Poland to come here.\\" Interpretations and allusions Blurring the lines between reality and non-reality, A Year in the Death of Jack Richards is an open-ended film that is vague and evasive but completely up for discussion. In interviews, Paquette has stated that it was his intention to make a film that was wide open to a variety of different interpretations. Even Vlasta Vrána, who played Jack Richards, said, \\"Don't ask me about the film because I don't know anything. I know what got me through making it, doing my part. [...] I had the story, I had the idea of what it is, I know what I took as my motivations—I know that the story is much more complex than what I took for myself.\\" Festival recognition Between 2004 and 2007, A Year in the Death of Jack Richards was presented at numerous film festivals in countries from around the world, including the USA, the UK, Ireland, Sweden, Canada, Chile, Romania, etc., and was honoured with many prizes and accolades, including a nomination for Best First Feature Film from the prestigious International Federation of Film Critics (FIPRESCI), the Best Feature Film award from the Festival of Fantastic Films (UK), and the Grand Jury prize from the DeadCENTER Film Festival. Theatrical release In 2006, A Year in the Death of Jack Richards received a limited commercial release in theatres across Canada. Critical response Reviews were polarizing. Most critics in Toronto derided the film, while most critics outside of Toronto had nothing but high praise for the film, especially those critics in the province of Quebec. Regardless, the negative reviews were as severe as the positive. Regarding the positive reviews, film critic Odile Tremblay concluded in Le Devoir, \\"A work that is radical in its style, disconcerting by its climate, courageous, open to multiple interpretations, sometimes irritating, mostly fascinating, susceptible to confounding general audiences, often too unmethodical, but worth the detour. [...] We salute a true audacity in this uneven film that gropes around in the dark but eventually reveals its brilliance in flashes, all the while refusing all compromise.\\" Martin Gignac of Ici wrote, \\"To discover a mysterious and haunting pearl as this is so very rare. The glaucous music and the audacious camerawork accentuate the subtle performance by the all too unfamiliar Vlasta Vrana.\\" In the Montreal Gazette, John Griffin wrote, \\"A fascinating, challenging psychodrama [...] impressively orchestrated.\\" In Le Soleil, Gilles Carignan wrote, \\"[...] the formal aspects, stunningly mastered, evoke Guy Maddin. Paquette perfectly blends amorous sentiment with terrifying suspense. A welcome surprise.\\" In La Presse, film critic Anabelle Nicoud concluded, \\"A debut film that is tragic, psychological, personal, and intelligent. A must see.\\" In Voir, Kevin Laforest wrote, \\"Aside from the technical brilliance, what gives the film all its power is the engaging performance by Vlasta Vrana.\\" Malcolm Fraser of the Montreal Mirror wrote, \\"The film has a peculiar style, one that's hard to classify [...] There are echoes of Eraserhead and Barton Fink [...] ultimately, though, Paquette seems to be striving towards his own vision. [...] an atmospheric and intriguing little curiosity.\\" Stephen Pedersen of The Chronicle Herald declared, \\"As a story it smudges the conventions of narrative. As a film it questions the conventions of film-making. [...] It's a striking achievement. [...] While what it means and how it was achieved are likely to arouse the biggest differences of opinion, on one thing, all are likely to agree: Vlasta Vrana's extraordinary performance. It is a tour-de-force [...].\\" The sole critic in Toronto with any praise was Adam Nayman of Eye Weekly, who opined, \\"B.P. Paquette is an estimable mood-setter [...] there's a pervasive sense of dread in the micro-budget, super-16mm indie A Year in the Death of Jack Richards that puts most burnished Hollywood horror-shows to shame.\\" Regarding the negative reviews, film critic Liz Braun's headline in the Toronto Sun summarized the opinion of most Toronto critics, \\"Jack Richards is Amateurish at Best.\\" Hannah Guy of Now wrote, \\"Benjamin Paquette's debut feature [...] is an awkward fledgling of a movie with mediocre production values,\\" but concluded that, \\"veteran thesp Vrana delivers an authentic performance.\\" Especially dismissive were Chris Knight at the National Post, and Liam Lacey at The Globe and Mail. The former declared, \\"Film critics see movies [...] with pages of press notes. [...] But the press notes can, however, make all the difference. A Year in the Death of Jack Richards [...] is a labyrinth of a film and I would have been lost without the notes. As it was, I was merely disoriented. [...] The press notes refer to the film's ability to 'trouble and perplex,' which I got right away; its 'warmth and deep understanding,' which I missed and its 'electrifying' nature, which I presume is a reference to the joybuzzer shock cuts, always accompanied by the same '70s-era photo of a greasyhaired guy with a thick moustache [...] The press notes say this 'challenging film experience [...] is sure to be most appreciated by those viewers who are engaged by film as film.\\" If that sounds like you, enjoy some popcorn as popcorn and settle back, prepared to be shocked out of your seat as a seat.\\" The latter stated, \\"... often more ambitious than accomplished. ... With everything up in the air, a viewer might be forgiven for finding this chain of ambiguities more pretentious than intriguing ... The plot's Twilight Zone-like entanglements might be more palatable if the film's execution were more adept. ... the acting ranges from mediocre to amateur. The character who hires Jack ... wears possibly the worst bald wig outside a joke store. In some close-ups, Vrana's untrimmed eyebrows threaten to engulf the screen. There's one particularly static scene in a hotel room where the camera operator seems to have crouched into the corner and fallen asleep. Perhaps he or she dreamed the whole thing.\\" Melora Koepke of the Hour Community concluded, \\"While it's a good thing that there are film students to write papers about classic auteur films, it's a bit weird to watch a movie that feels more like the paper than the film. Which is how A Year in the Death of Jack Richards rings - more like an idea than an actual movie. [...] If puzzles and ambivalence are your bag, then A Year in the Death of Jack Richards is a godsend. Paquette is clearly just as concerned with muddling the edges of reality, blurring tenses in his storylines and inserting numerous homages to his cinema idols (Ingmar Bergman and Roman Polanski, probably) as he is with riveting his audience. Of course, if you have a film studies paper due, you're in luck. For others, A Year in the Death of Jack Richards is definitely a matter of taste.\\" Awards and nominations * 2004, Nomination for Best Canadian Feature Film at Cinéfest Sudbury International Film Festival * 2005, Won the Best Independent Feature Award at the Festival of Fantastic Films (UK) * 2005, Nomination for FIPRESCI Prize for Best First Feature Film at the Transylvania International Film Festival * 2005, Won the Grand Jury Award at The DeadCENTER Film Festival * 2005, Won the Richard Kind Award for Best Actor at the Trenton Film Festival for Vlasta Vrana References External links * Category:2005 films Category:Canadian films Category:2000s psychological drama films Category:Canadian psychological drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by B.

Gordon Edwards and starring Violet Mersereau, Nerio Bernardi, and Guido Trento. It is a film adaptation of a 1904 Broadway play by Wright Lorimer and Arnold Reeves. The film depicts the biblical story of David (Bernardi), a shepherd prophesied to replace Saul (Trento) as king. David is invited into Saul's court, but eventually betrayed. He assembles an army that defeats the Philistines, becomes king after Saul's death in battle, and marries Saul's daughter Michal (Mersereau). Advertising for the film tried to take advantage of the popular interest in Egypt following the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb, despite only an introductory scene in the film taking place in Egypt. The film opened to mixed reviews from contemporary critics. In part due to direct competition from another biblical epic, Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments, The Shepherd King was not considered successful. Like many of Fox Film's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.  Plot  Moses leads the Israelites past the Giza pyramids and the Great Sphinx on their way out of Egypt toward the Promised Land. Generations later, King Saul of Judea defies prophecy by making a burnt offering to prepare for an attack against the Philistines without waiting for the arrival of the prophet Samuel. In response, Samuel tells Saul that he will lose the throne. Samuel searches for someone worthy to be the next king, and selects the young shepherd David, secretly informing the boy that he will become king at some future time. Saul is depressed and has his son Jonathan befriend David and bring him to the palace. David's music improves the king's mood. While at court, the shepherd meets Princess Michal, Saul's daughter, and they begin to fall in love with each other. After he uses a sling to kill a lion that was threatening Michal's life, he is permitted to face the Philistine champion, Goliath, in combat. David kills Goliath with the same sling used to kill the lion. Saul offers David the opportunity to marry the princess if he can defeat the Philistine army and claim one hundred of the enemy banners as proof of their defeat. However, Saul has become convinced that the defeat of Goliath is evidence that David is the man Samuel prophesied would replace him as king. David prepares to face the Philistines with only a small military force, while Doeg, a member of Saul's court, warns them of the impending attack. An escaped prisoner meets with David and informs him that the Philistines are preparing an ambush; David uses this knowledge to defeat the enemy forces. Returning victorious to the court, Saul attempts to kill David, then banishes him. David begins to gather an army of his own. Doeg, assisting the Philistines, attacks Saul's palace. Both Saul and Jonathan die during the battle, but David's forces intercede and destroy the attacking army. David saves Michal from the invaders, is crowned king by popular acclamation, and marries the princess.  Cast  * Violet Mersereau as Michal * Edy Darclea as Herab * Virginia Lucchetti as Adora * Nerio Bernardi as David * Guido Trento as Saul * Ferruccio Biancini as Jonathan * Sandro Salvini as Doeg (credited as Alessandro Salvini) * Mariano Bottino as Adriel * Samuel Balestra as Goliath * Adriano Bocanera as Samuel * Enzo Di Felice as Ozem * Eduardo Balsamo as Abimelech * Americo Di Giorgio as Omah * Ernesto Tranquili as Jesse Edwards's son Jack McEdward, credited here as Gordon McEdward, appears as an Egyptian prisoner.  Production  The Saul's palace set Wright Lorimer and Arnold Reeves wrote a play based on the biblical story of David, titled The Shepherd King ... a Romantic Drama in Four Acts and Five Scenes. It debuted on Broadway on April 5, 1904 at the Knickerbocker Theatre, where it ran for 27 engagements. The play was well- received by critics, especially the performance of Margaret Hayward as the Witch of Endor. Following this initial success, it was revived twice: at the New York Theatre for 48 performances beginning February 20, 1905; and for 32 performances at the Academy of Music beginning December 3, 1906. From 1908 to 1910, Lorimer contracted with theater producer William A. Brady to have the play staged at other venues in the United States and Canada; this relationship broke down and Lorimer sued Brady over the handling of the production and its proceeds. In December 1911, with the suit still pending, Lorimer committed suicide. Brady permitted all rights to The Shepherd King to pass to Lorimer's widow. The first film based on the Lorimer and Reeves play was directed by J. Stuart Blackton for Vitagraph Studios in 1909. This one-reel short film, titled Saul and David, was an unauthorized adaptation that did not credit its source. Following the success of biblical epics Salomé (1918) and The Queen of Sheba (1921), and a history of successful adaptations of theatrical works, Fox obtained the rights to The Shepherd King, in part to ensure that the well- regarded play could be mentioned freely in advertising. As with many historical films produced by Hollywood studios in the 1920s, including Edwards's earlier Nero (1922), an Italian crew was used; actor Henry Armetta accompanied the production as an interpreter. For The Shepherd King, most of the cast were also Italian. Some scenes were filmed in Rome; Saul's palace was a constructed set, built with the assistance of the Capitoline and Vatican Museums. This structure, measuring , was among the largest built for a film's production at that time. Most exterior scenes, however, were filmed on location in Mandatory Palestine and the Emirate of Transjordan, including staging in both Jericho and Jerusalem. Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922 had sparked a wave of Egyptomania. Seeking to capitalize on this trend, Fox had Edwards add an opening sequence to the film based on the Exodus. This introduction was filmed in Egypt, with the Sphinx and pyramids in the background. Because it was produced largely for promotional purposes, it is unrelated to the rest of the film, although Edwards did provide intertitles that attempted to frame it as a background for the story of David. Unlike either the stage production or Saul and David, the battle between David and Goliath was featured on screen. A chariot race was also included in an effort to capitalize on the success of a similar scene in The Queen of Sheba. Some scenes required large numbers of extras. Photoplay reported that Edwards's crew avoided potential religious conflict while filming in Jerusalem by having British troops costumed as Arabs. The largest battle scene used fifteen thousand horsemen, who were members of Transjordan's military provided by Emir Abdullah. Several scenes were hand-colored for release, including images of a red lantern hung above Saul's throne.  Release and reception  The Shepherd King was scheduled for a November 25, 1923 release; modern sources, including the American Film Institute, report that the film was released on that date. Its New York premiere, on December 10 at the Central Theatre, was met with initially positive reviews in the local newspapers; the New York Evening Journal labelled it the best of Edwards's films. Moving Picture World C. S. Sewell also reviewed the film favorably, praising the battle scenes and Bernardi's role as David. Many reviewers held more mixed opinions. The New York Times found the film beautiful, but faulted its slow pacing and the number of close-up shots. Laurence Reid, writing for Motion Picture News, also considered the film too slow and complained that too much of the plotline was conveyed in intertitles rather than action. At the Los Angeles Times, Helen Klumph was scathing, declaring the film \\"simply incredibly bad\\". Agnes Smith of Picture-Play Magazine compared The Shepherd King to a \\"third-rate\\" Italian opera and deemed it inferior to Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments (1923). The Shepherd King performed poorly at the box office, primarily due to competition with The Ten Commandments, however other factors contributed to its commercial failure. Mersereau lacked the appeal of Theda Bara or Betty Blythe, who had starred in Edwards's earlier, more successful works. The rest of the cast were primarily unknown to the American audience. Additionally, Fox's advertising strategies for The Shepherd King were sometimes counterproductive. Promotional material for the film, including the film poster, primarily focused on Egyptian imagery. However, the film itself had very little to do with Egypt or the Exodus story; 1,220 shots were registered for copyright in association with the film, but only eight of those were filmed in Egypt. The Shepherd King was also marketed as \\"the World's greatest romance\\", a tagline recycled from The Queen of Sheba, but the biblical relationship between David and Michal is not overall a romantic one. A 1924 advertising campaign encouraged Odd Fellows to see the film by focusing on the relationship between David and Jonathan, which is an important part of Odd Fellows ritual. The Shepherd King is believed to be lost. The 1937 Fox vault fire destroyed most of Fox's silent films, and the Library of Congress is not aware of any extant copies.

Most of his activities were based in the areas of Tulkarm, Nablus and Jenin (modern-day northern West Bank).Swedenburg, 2008, p. 87. In September 1938, he became the official General Commander of the Revolt, although he shared the post in rotation with Arif Abd al-Raziq. In February 1939, al-Hajj Muhammad was given sole title to the post by the revolt's political leadership, but was killed the following month in a firefight with British forces. Early life Al-Hajj Muhammad was born in the village of Dhinnaba (today a neighborhood of Tulkarm city) in 1892.Nafi, 1998, p. 255. He belonged to the landowning clan of Samara,Nimr, ed. LeVine, 2012, p. 146. itself a part of the larger tribal confederation of al-Barqawi, which had a long history of activity in the area of Tulkarm. During the invasion of Syria by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798–99, al-Hajj Muhammad's great-grandfather fought in the Ottoman defense of the country, but was later sentenced to death. Another of his great-grandfathers participated in the 1834 peasants' revolt against Ibrahim Pasha's rule in Palestine.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 144. Al- Hajj Muhammad was initially educated in Dhinnaba's kuttab, a traditional elementary school. In 1899–1900 he was enrolled in a primary school in Tulkarm. Later, he would work the fields of his lands alongside his father and occasionally traveled with him from place to place, selling their agricultural products.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 145. During World War I (1914–18) he was conscripted into the Ottoman army (a requirement for male Ottoman citizens), posted outside of Palestine in Tripoli and Beirut. He returned following the Ottomans' defeat by British forces and their Hashemite Arab allies. His father had died sometime during the war. In 1920 Britain, which had already been in control of the area, established a mandate over Palestine under the auspices of the League of Nations. Career during British rule Al-Hajj Muhammad and his four sons, Kamal (the eldest), Abd al-Jawad, Abd al-Karim and Jawdat in Damascus, early 1937 Upon his return to Palestine in 1918, al-Hajj Muhammad supervised his family's land possessions. He became one of the prominent local grain traders of Palestine during the early years of the Mandate.Swedenburg 2008, p. 229. Coinciding with this period, al-Hajj Muhammad became an ardent opponent of Zionism and British support for the movement. The 1920 Nebi Musa riots, unrest in 1923 and the 1929 Palestine riots all extended into Tulkarm and al-Hajj Muhammad was angered at the coercive manner in which the British authorities quelled the Palestinian Arab participants. His business eventually went bankrupt after the Mandate adopted new economic policies that saw the import of cheaper, foreign wheat at the expense of local produce. His disaffection with British economic policies partly motivated his participation in the Palestinian Arab revolt in 1936.Swedenburg 2008, p. 100. The local connections al-Hajj Muhammad established as a grain merchant became beneficial in his later recruitment efforts. The web of the al-Barqawi's tribal loyalties proved resourceful, providing him with fighting men and provisions. During the 1930s, al-Hajj Muhammad set up base in the vicinity of Bal'a, near Tulkarm, and began recruiting and training fighters from the area, including former Ottoman soldiers who brought additional expertise in combat and firearms. Under his command, his men launched minor raids against Jewish settlements and British security personnel. One of the main targets were the orange orchards of newly established Jewish settlements in the Wadi al-Hawarith area west of Tulkarm. These places had mostly been built on the lands of absentee landlords and their peasant tenants had been evicted. Al-Hajj Muhammad had a criminal record with the Mandatory authorities. According to Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath, his alleged crime was committing fraud in a land transaction with a Jewish buyer. However, author and anthropologist Ted Swedenburg wrote Porath's claim was never mentioned by other sources that discussed al-Hajj Muhammad. In 1934, his wife Badia'a died and al-Hajj Muhammad was left to care for his four sons. With the killing of Izz al-Din al-Qassam, a Muslim revivalist preacher and anti-colonial militant, by British forces, tensions between the Palestinian Arab population, among whom al-Qassam was popular, and the authorities rose significantly. His sympathizers grew in number and the notion of armed struggle against British rule and British sponsorship of Zionism became increasingly popular as an alternative to the diplomatic negotiations between the Palestinian leadership and the British government. The negotiations were ultimately seen by the local population as a futile effort that bore no tangible results. When al-Hajj Muhammad actively took part in the upcoming revolt, he entrusted his children with his sister Halima, a widow. According to his eldest son Kamal, she too was a grain merchant, who later traded in textiles. She also financially supported the children's education. Al-Hajj Muhammad normally met his sons for one or two days a week in different villages. His children would be escorted to his location by one of al-Hajj Muhammad's soldiers. Commander in the revolt Early stage Al-Hajj Muhammad praying with his fighters behind him, 1936 The revolt started in Nablus with the Palestinian general strike in April 1936. The strike spread to a number of cities throughout Palestine, including Tulkarm where al-Hajj Muhammad helped organize the campaign.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 82. By the summer of that year, several Palestinian Arab rebel bands had sprung up, including the forces of al-Hajj Muhammad.Frisch, 2008, p. 20. The latter used existing social networks and the complex web of local clan politics to build alliances both with the middle classes of the major towns, particularly the well-educated activists, and the rural clan elders to build a solid base of resistance against the British. In order to avoid detection, al-Hajj Muhammad refrained from commanding a large unit of troops. Instead, he raised small, semi-permanent bands of volunteers called fasa'il (sing. fasl) as he moved from one area to another. They normally launched nighttime attacks against specific targets.Thomas 2008, p. 247. In the earliest stage of the revolt, in the early summer, al-Hajj Muhammad's fighters primarily operated in the Wadi al-Sha'ir area between Nablus and the coastal plain. Most of their actions consisted of attacks against British Army and police patrols between Tulkarm and Nablus. On 21 June in the Battle of Anabta, al-Hajj Muhammad and his fasa'il ambushed a British Army force protecting a Jewish convoy passing near the village. Three British bomber planes were dispatched to aid the ambushed convoy. The ensuing battle lasted about seven hours and ended with the deaths of ~10 rebels and 2 British soldiers. A further 21 rebels and two British soldiers were wounded. The authorities consequently issued an arrest warrant for al-Hajj Muhammad.Nimr, ed. LeVine, pp. 146–147. The rebel bands had worked independently of each other until July, when al-Hajj Muhammad, Arif Abd al- Raziq and Fakhri Abd al-Hadi decided to coordinate the actions of their respective militias. Abd al-Raziq was based in the Bani Sa'b area around Tayibe, while Abd al-Hadi operated in Sha'ruwiya, around Arraba. All of their areas of operation were concentrated in the north-central highlands. Another meeting between the leaders was held in August to designate official areas of operation and specific targets to attack. The Jerusalem-area militia of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was absent from both of these meetings, making it increasingly difficult to form a solid military command among rebels across the country.Frisch 2008, pp. 20–21. The arrival of the well-known Arab nationalist volunteer commander Fawzi al-Qawuqji in August, and his assumption of the rebels' leadership, further damaged the revolt's coherence,Frisch 2008, p. 22. despite his attempts to unify rebel ranks. Although al-Qawuqji was an experienced field commander, relations between him and the Palestinian political and military leadership was one of general mistrust.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 147. Local rebels resented the delegation of command positions to non-Palestinians and al-Qawuqji's references to the area as \\"Southern Syria\\" instead of \\"Palestine.\\"Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 148. Nonetheless, al-Hajj Muhammad and al-Qawuqji fought together in a second major confrontation with British forces in Bal'a in September. The battle went on for six hours and according to Mandatory figures, three British military personnel were killed and four wounded. One of the fatalities was a British pilot whose plane was downed by rebels, who suffered ten dead and six wounded. In October 1936, rebel operations temporarily ceased after the Arab Higher Committee (AHC), the revolt's political leadership, accepted calls by the generally pro-British royals of Jordan, Iraq and Saudi Arabia for a cessation of hostilities. In return, the Arab royals would lobby the British Mandatory authorities to address Palestinian Arab concerns about Zionist activity in Palestine. That month, al-Qawuqji left Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad followed suit and headed for Damascus to evade arrest; the British had placed a bounty of 500 pounds on him. While in Damascus, al-Hajj Muhammad raised funds and purchased weapons for the revolt. He also began working with Syrian and Lebanese nationalists to smuggle the arms into Palestine. Al-Hajj Muhammad later left Damascus for the Lebanese mountain village of Qarnayel east of Beirut. From there, he maintained regular communications with his forces. Renewal of rebellion Al-Hajj Muhammad on horseback (beneath the \\"x\\" mark) with his fasa'il outside Kafr Sur. To his left on the brown horse is commander Abd al-Rahman al-Hattab and behind and to al-Hattab's left is Maarouf Saad, a volunteer and future parliamentarian of Sidon, Lebanon While fighting was on hold, the British government announced it would not restrict Jewish immigration to Palestine and instead proposed a partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states as put forward by the Peel Commission (November 1936–January 1937.) These moves antagonized the Palestinian leadership whose principal concern was increased Jewish settlement. Thus, they boycotted the commission from the time it began its work. The AHC under the chairmanship of Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, requested rebel leaders return and resume military activities in Palestine to pressure the authorities. To that end, al-Hajj Muhammad returned to Palestine in April to command his fasa'il in the Tulkarm- Jenin-Nablus region, which was referred to by the authorities as the \\"Triangle of Terror\\" due to the concentration of rebel activity in the area.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 149. With the renewal of the revolt, efforts were made to unify rebel ranks and establish a hierarchical command structure. In late 1937, al-Hajj Muhammad summoned the village elders in Tulkarm's vicinity and requested that they each provide him with one armed man. He was generally successful and recruited a 50-man force.Swedenburg 2008, p. 123. The last quarter of the year saw increased attacks against British military targets, buses carrying Jews, the Iraqi Petroleum Company pipeline in Palestine and telecommunication lines. At this stage, the revolt had developed into an organized effort across Palestine, with each area's fasa'il having a hierarchy of some sort. In the case of al-Hajj Muhammad's forces, there were four brigades, each led by a commander and designated funds. Al-Hajj Muhammad appointed Ahmad Massad as his deputy to whom the other commanders were subordinate. This military order contrasted with the early phase of the revolt where al-Hajj Muhammad had been the sole field commander. During a confrontation between rebels and British forces at the village of an-Nazla ash-Sharqiya in early December 1937, al-Hajj Muhammad was wounded, but managed to evade capture when the mukhtar (village headman) escorted him to safety in a nearby cave. Four of al-Hajj Muhammad's men died in the battle. After the British withdrew from the area, al-Hajj Muhammad was treated by local doctors until January 1938 when he received more advanced care in Damascus. He returned to Palestine later that month. By early 1938, the rebels consolidated control over much of the countryside and the rural roads. These areas became increasingly dangerous for British forces, who were mostly concentrated in the main towns.Nimr, ed. Levine 2012, pp. 149–150. General commander Local rebel commanders were generally suspicious of outside Arab military leaders, such as al-Qawuqji, and of the AHC, particularly after many members of the latter joined the Damascus-based Central Committee of Jihad following the AHC's dissolution by the authorities in October 1937. The Central Committee had been founded in late 1937 by Izzat Darwaza,Frisch 2008, pp. 22–23. and officially served as the revolt's political leadership, fundraising body and arms supplier.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 150. On the ground in Palestine, competition for the role of the rebels' general command became increasingly tense between al-Hajj Muhammad and Abd al-Raziq. They engaged in a serious rivalry, which coincided with acrimonious relations between their families over influence in the Tulkarm area's social and political spheres. To smooth over differences, the revolt's leaders held a summit in Deir Ghassaneh in September 1938 and established the Bureau of the Arab Revolt in Palestine as the armed body of the Central Committee, with al-Hajj Muhammad and Abd al- Raziq rotating as general commander. The other two commanders on the Bureau were Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir of the Upper Galilee and Yusuf Abu Durra of the Haifa-Wadi Ara region.Great Britain and the East, 1939, p. 126. The British Army, backed by bomber planes, assaulted Deir Ghassaneh after gaining knowledge of the meeting, and sought to arrest or kill the commanders. A battle ensued in which a prominent commander, Muhammad al-Salih (known as Abu Khalid) was slain. Despite the Bureau's formation, the rivalry between al-Hajj Muhammad and Abd al-Raziq continued and undermined its purpose. The Central Committee settled the leadership dispute when it conferred the title of general commander solely to al-Hajj Muhammad in February 1939. He was already in Damascus at the time, having moved back in October 1938. Al-Hajj Muhammad was also given an assurance of support after tensions between him and the Central Committee resulted in the latter's withholding of supplies and funding to al-Hajj Muhammad at one point in 1938. The rebellion was also entering a different stage with the establishment of British-sponsored and Zionist- supported anti-rebel forces known as \\"peace bands\\". They were commanded by al- Husayni's political rivals, chief among them the Nashashibi clan, and launched counterattacks against rebel forces and a campaign to harass rebel sympathizers and pressure local leaders to end the revolt. Death and legacy On 23 March 1939, on his return to Palestine after being officially confirmed as the rebellion's general commander, al-Hajj Muhammad was killed by the British Army in the village of Sanur, located between Jenin and Nablus. He had entered the village with two of his subordinate commanders and a few of his fighters.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 154. A peace band set up by Farid Irsheid had been surveilling him. Irsheid had sought revenge for the killing of his brothers Ahmad and Muhammad in May 1938, which were generally attributed to al-Hajj Muhammad. The information Irsheid's band of informants collected on al-Hajj Muhammad's movements were then passed to British intelligence. A large force from the British Army subsequently arrived at and sealed off Sanur. Irsheid's band served alongside the army unit.Cohen 2009, p. 152. The village's residents had reportedly pleaded with al-Hajj Muhammad to escape from Sanur undercover, but he and his fighters entered the adjacent Marj Sanur plain and clashed with British troops. Al-Hajj Muhammad was killed in the firefight along with one of his deputy commanders. According to some residents who witnessed the clash, the British officer who headed the operation, Geoffrey Morton, removed his hat and covered al-Hajj Muhammad's face with a handkerchief in a sign of respect. Morton later wrote \\"Abdul Rahim had a special respect among his people, and among us.\\" Al-Hajj Muhammad was buried in Sanur, but two weeks later members of his fasa'il exhumed his body and transported it to Dhinnaba. There, he was buried in a ceremonial manner \\"befitting his stature in the revolt,\\" according to author Sonia Nimr. As news of his death proliferated, a general strike was held throughout Palestine for a number of days in honor of al-Hajj Muhammad's efforts in the anti-colonial and anti-Zionist struggle. His death made the headlines of various newspapers in Palestine and other parts of the Arab world. The Municipality of Tulkarm commemorates al-Hajj Muhammad's death annually in March and the 70th anniversary of his death was also honored by the city's Khodori Institute in March 2009. A boys' school in Dhinnaba is named after al-Hajj Muhammad as is a major street in Amman, Jordan.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 155. According to historian Hillel Frisch, al-Hajj Muhammad's death was a \\"reflection of how much the rebels were then bereft of an area that could serve as a sanctuary or from which they could renew operations.\\"Frisch 2008, p. 23. The revolt had largely dissipated by the time al-Hajj Muhammad was killed, his demise being a significant blow. He was succeeded by Ahmad al-Hasan, but the latter was unable to maintain the momentum of the revolt, which ended in late 1939. Ideology and relationship with the Central Committee According to Swedenburg, al-Hajj Muhammad was the \\"most respected commander, was renowned for his nationalist convictions, for his opposition to political assassination, and for his tirelessness as a fighter\\".Swedenburg, ed. Burke 1988, p. 197. He operated more or less independently from the political leadership of the rebellion, including those based in Palestine, such as al- Husayni, and the Damascus-based Central Committee. Despite his tacit alliance with al-Husayni, al-Hajj Muhammad had refused to assassinate local leaders who rivaled the al-Husayni family for political power, once remarking \\"I don't work for Husayniya (\\"Husanyni-ism\\"), but for wataniya (patriotism).\\" Political assassinations, attempted or successful, commonly occurred throughout the revolt. Al-Hajj Muhammad's refusal to participate did not seriously damage his relations with al-Husayni or the Central Committee, an organization which he depended on for war material. He frequented Damascus to obtain weapons and supplies as well as to discuss the situation in Palestine.Nimr, ed. LeVine 2012, p. 153. However, an intelligence document from the British Mandatory authorities revealed that al-Hajj Muhammad left Palestine for Syria in October 1938 after being disaffected with the Central Committee's activities. The report states that he refused to send funds to the Committee, remarking \\"The shoe of the most insignificant mujahid (fighter) is nobler than all the members of the Society, who have indulged in pleasure, while their brethren suffer in the mountains.\\" At one point, tensions emanating from al-Hajj Muhammad's refusal to carry out the killings of several men provided to him in a hit list by Da'ud al-Husayni on behalf of the Committee resulted in the cutting off of financial and material support for a certain period of time in 1938. This forced al-Hajj Muhammad to go to Jerusalem's chamber of commerce and the Ramallah municipality for funds. Another reason for his departure was the increased presence of informants within rebel ranks, making it hard for him to continue military activities. His personal assistant Abu Shahir depicted al-Hajj Muhammad as a \\"genuine nationalist,\\" in contrast to the self- proclaimed nationalist leaders whom Abu Shahir accused of adhering to \\"narrow factional interests\\". He claimed that al-Hajj Muhammad saw Palestinian unity as being all-inclusive and incompatible with political assassinations, particularly killings that would fuel divisions within the ranks of the rebellion's leadership. A possible exception to his anti-assassination policy was his alleged responsibility in the killings of Ahmad and Muhammad Irsheid, landowners who supported Nashashibi-led opposition to al-Husayni's leadership. Because of the widely disputed circumstances surrounding the Irsheids' deaths and its general attribution to al-Hajj Muhammad, the killings were rarely mentioned in Palestinian narratives of the revolt.Swedenburg 2008, pp. 102–103.

From 1968 to 1988, Rubin was a curator at The Museum of Modern Art located in New York City and, from 1973 to 1988, he served as director of the Painting and Sculpture Department. He played a key role in building the museum's collection of -- particularly acquiring work from the period of abstract expressionism -- and organized many groundbreaking exhibitions (see below). His younger brother Lawrence Rubin (1933-2018) was an art dealer in NYC and in Europe.NY Times, obituary Biography Background and education William S. Rubin was born in Brooklyn, New York, the eldest of three children. His father was a textile merchant who owned several factories. Rubin was educated in public schools in Brooklyn before the family moved to Riverdale, New York, where he attended the Fieldston School. There he took an art course with Victor D’Amico, who was also director of education at the Museum of Modern Art. At the time, Rubin was not interested in pursuing a career in the visual arts, for he aspired to become an orchestra conductor. Upon graduation from high school, he went to Columbia University, ostensibly to study music. His studies were interrupted by a stint in the army. While stationed in Rome, Italy, he played the clarinet in a marching band. When the war ended, he returned to New York and resumed his studies at Columbia University. There he enrolled in classes taught by the distinguished art historian, Meyer Shapiro, who specialized in both modern and medieval art. Rubin consequently became interested in both fields and wrote his doctoral dissertation on the Church of Assy in the French Alps with an interior that was decorated by modern artists in the years after World War II: Henri Matisse, Pierre Bonnard, Georges Rouault, Marc Chagall, Jean Lurçat, and others.William S. Rubin, Modern Sacred Art and the Church of Assy (New York: Columbia University Press, 1961. Career In 1952, Rubin began teaching art history at Sarah Lawrence College and at Hunter College of the City University of New York. In the mid-1950s, he was introduced to Alfred Barr, founding director of the Museum of Modern Art, who invited him to lecture at the museum and eventually to serve as curator of a show on the surrealist painter Roberto Matta. In the mid-1960s, Rubin began writing a book on Dada and Surrealism; upon hearing of this project, Barr invited him to organize a show on the subject for the museum. While preparing that show, Rubin joined the museum's staff as permanent curator. In 1968, he organized and wrote the catalog for Dada, Surrealism and Their Heritage for the Museum of Modern Art and, in the same year, Rubin's Dada & Surrealist Art, a 525-page survey on the subject, was published by Harry N. Abrams, New York. Throughout his years at the museum, Rubin acquired works with the dedication and passion of a private collector (which he also was). Almost immediately upon being hired by the museum, he persuaded the art dealer Sidney Janis and his wife Harriet to donate their formidable collection of modern art to the museum, one of many collections that he would secure during his twenty-year tenure there. Others include works from the collections of William S. Paley, Nina and Gordon Bunshaft, Wolfgang and Florene May Schoenborn, John Hay Whitney, Peggy and David Rockefeller, Mary Sisler, Richard S. Zeisler, and others. From collectors such as these, or through direct purchases by the museum, Rubin managed to acquire some of the most important works of art in the museum's collection: Marcel Duchamp, The Bicycle Wheel (1913/51), Constantin Brancusi, The Endless Column (1918), Pablo Picasso, Charnel House (1944-45), Henri Matisse, Memory of Oceana (1952-53) and The Swimming Pool (1952), Jackson Pollock, One: Number 31 (1950). He even gave the museum David Smith's Australia (1951) from his own private collection. Through his position at the museum, he was able to meet and befriend Picasso at his home in the south of France. In 1971, the artist gave him for the museum's collection his Cubist Guitar (1914), an iconic metal and wire sculpture and, over the years, Rubin was instrumental in acquiring many other important works by the artist for the museum.William S. Rubin, A Curator's Quest: Building the Collection of Painting and Sculpture of the Museum of Modern Art 1967-1988 (New York: Overlook Duckworth, 2001), introduction. See also his Picasso in the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1971). Exhibitions In addition to Dada, Surrealism and their Heritage (1968), during his tenure at the museum Rubin organized some of the most important and memorable shows held there, several of which could be classified today as blockbusters (although the term was not then in popular usage to describe museum exhibitions). He made it a habit of installing these shows while circulating around the galleries in a wheelchair (a skiing accident left him partially lame in one leg), directing the placement of work like the conductor of a symphony orchestra, the career to which he had earlier aspired. Because he was a known collector, even before he came to the museum, Rubin made a special effort to befriend the contemporary artists whose work he collected. The most fruitful and enduring relationship was with the American abstract painter Frank Stella, for whom he organized two comprehensive exhibitions, one in 1970 and another in 1987. In conjunction with the American art historians John Rewald and Theodore Reff, in 1978 he organized Cézanne: The Late Work, a monumental exhibition featuring work from the last decade of the artist's life, the period which most profoundly influenced the modernist evolution in the early years of the 20th Century. In the late 1970s, the museum was scheduled to close for a major renovation, so Rubin seized the opportunity to present Pablo Picasso: A Retrospective (1980), a show that filled the entire museum with a comprehensive survey of the artist's seventy-five year career. This was followed with Primitivism in Twentieth-Century Art: Affinity of the Tribal and the Modern (1984), which he organized with the art historian Kirk Varnedoe. It was his most controversial exhibition, for critics complained that in the process of comparing examples of African and Oceanic art with modern works influenced by them, the primitive artifacts lost their original meaning and significance. “The notion that you can look at a work of art as pure form strikes me as idiocy,” he explained to the writer Calvin Tomkins. “If the work come at you, it comes with everything it’s got, all at once.”Quoted in Calvin Tomkins, “Sharpening the Eye,” The New Yorker, November 4, 1985, p. 75. Rubin's last two major exhibitions at the museum were devoted to Picasso. The first, Picasso and Braque: Pioneering Cubism (1989), attempted to analyze the intimate and complex interchange between the work of these two artists during the critical period in which Cubism was formed, and the second, Picasso and Portraiture (1996), followed the artist's many attempts to capture the essence of his friends and associates, especially the women and wives who came in and out of his life serving as his models and muses. Personal life and death In the late 1960s, Rubin moved into a large loft on 13th Street and Broadway in New York City, which he filled with examples of art from the Abstract Expressionist period (Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb, Hans Hofmann, Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Clyfford Still, Mark Rothko, Herbert Ferber, David Smith, as well as paintings and sculpture by a select number of contemporary artists (Frank Stella, Jasper Johns, Kenneth Noland, Larry Bell, Jules Olitski, Morris Louis, George Segal, Roy Lichtenstein, etc.). Here Rubin organized gatherings of artists, art historians, dealers and critics, one memorable photograph taken in 1967 records him speaking to Frank Stella, Barbara Rose, Larry Poons, Lucinda Childs, Wilder Green, Annalee and Barnett Newman and Phyllis Hattis (whom he would later marry). In the late 1960s, Rubin purchased land in the south of France not far from where Picasso had lived and began building a home there. It was a palatial estate with an Olympic-sized swimming pool in the village of Le Plan-de-la-Tour that he called L’Oubradou, “workshop” in Provençal, because most of his writings were done there during the summer months. Rubin lived in New York City, but also maintained a residence in Pound Ridge, New York, where he acquired rare and exotic trees; from his living room, oversaw their placement in the surrounding landscape—again—like the conductor of a symphony orchestra. After a number of years in declining health, he died there in his Pound Ridge home in 2006 at the age of 78. Impact Rubin's post at the Museum of Modern Art made him one of the most powerful and influential individuals in the art world of his day, but he eventually realized that it was time for a younger generation to take over, so he retired in 1988, appointing Kirk Varnedoe (with whom he had organized the Primitivism Show in 1984) his chosen successor. Varnedoe died of cancer at the age of fifty-seven in 2003, and the position was eventually filled by three separate curators. Artists Late in his career, Rubin said that he had hoped his exhibitions had a meaningful influence on the artists who saw them. “I’m personally most curious about whatever repercussions shows have on artists, and hence, on art history,” he explained. “To the extent that the public gets caught up in them, so much the better.”“William Rubin,” The London Times, 27 January 2006.

The CH 640 is a four- seat, low-wing touring aircraft with tricycle landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration. It has a standard empty weight of , a gross weight of and an acceptable engine power range of . The recommended engine is the Lycoming O-360 of . The aircraft is made from 6061-T6 aluminum. Its span wing is a cantilever structure and is equipped with flaps. The wide cabin is accessed via two gull-winged doors. The construction time from the factory- supplied standard kit is estimated at 1250 hours to complete and the quick- build kit at 750 hours. In 2011 the kit cost US$28,995, while finishing a completed aircraft was estimated to cost between US$45,000 to $99,000, depending on options, engine and avionics installed. In December 2011 there were 50 completed and flying.

Produced and distributed by First National Pictures, the film is a part-talkie, part-silent hybrid made at the changeover from silent to sound movies. Based on a story by Courtney Riley Cooper, the film is about a gangster who goes to prison and finds salvation through music while serving his time. After he is released and falls back into a life of temptation, he is saved by the love of a woman and the warden who befriended him. The film received a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Director in 1930. Weary River was preserved at the Library of Congress and restored by the LoC, UCLA Film and Television Archive, and Warner Bros. It is available on DVD directly from the Warner Archive Collection.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921-30. The American Film Institute, c. 1971. While Barthelmess's character sings and plays the piano throughout the film, Barthelmess did not sing or play the piano. Frank Churchill played the piano, and Johnny Murray sang into a microphone far away from Barthelmess while he lip-synced and played a piano that had strings deadened with felt. Plot Jerry Larrabee (Richard Barthelmess) is framed by rival gangster Spadoni (Louis Natheaux) and sent to prison, where he is befriended by a kind and understanding warden (William Holden). Through the warden's patient influence, Jerry becomes interested in music and forms a prison band, broadcasting over the radio. Jerry's singing deeply moves his radio listeners, and soon Jerry is given a pardon by the governor. Jerry pursues a singing career in vaudeville, billing himself as the Master of Melody, but constant whispers of \\"Convict!\\" from the audience disturb his concentration. Moving from job to job, Jerry is haunted by his past. With no hope of succeeding in music, Jerry returns to his old gang and takes up with his former sweetheart Alice Gray (Betty Compson). As he prepares for a final confrontation with Spadoni, Alice gets in touch with the warden, who arrives on the scene in time to keep Jerry on the straight and narrow path. Jerry eventually becomes a radio star and marries Alice.

If not specified further, the term is likely to refer to longitudinal effective shunt impedance.  Longitudinal shunt impedance  To produce longitudinal Coulomb forces which add up to the (longitudinal) acceleration voltage \\\\scriptstyle V_\\\\parallel, an eigenmode of the resonator has to be excited, leading to power dissipation \\\\scriptstyle P. The definition of the longitudinal effective shunt impedance, \\\\scriptstyle R, then reads: :R = \\\\frac{V_\\\\parallel^2}{P} with the longitudinal effective acceleration voltage \\\\scriptstyle V_\\\\parallel. The time-independent shunt impedance, \\\\scriptstyle R_0, with the time-independent acceleration voltage \\\\scriptstyle V_0 is defined: :R_0 = \\\\frac{V_0^2}{P}. One can use the quality factor \\\\scriptstyle Q to substitute \\\\scriptstyle P with an equivalent expression: :R = Q \\\\frac{V_\\\\parallel^2}{\\\\omega W}, where W is the maximum energy stored. Since the quality factor is the only quantity in the right equation term that depends on wall properties, the quantity \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac{R}{Q}is often used to design cavities, omitting material properties at first (see also cavity geometry factor).  Transverse shunt impedance  When a particle is deflected in transverse direction, the definition of the shunt impedance can be used with substitution of the (longitudinal) acceleration voltage by the transverse effective acceleration voltage, taking into account transversal Coulomb and Lorentz forces. :R_\\\\perp = \\\\frac{V_\\\\perp^2}{P_0} = Q \\\\frac{V_\\\\perp^2}{\\\\omega W} This does not necessarily imply a change in particle energy since a particle can also be deflected by magnetic fields (see Panofsky-Wenzel theorem).  Polarization angle  Because the transverse deflection can be described with polar coordinates, one may define a deflection or polarization angle using the transverse acceleration voltage components. Polar coordinates are used because it is possible to add up voltage components like vectors, but not shunt impedances.

If not specified further, the term is likely to refer to the longitudinal effective acceleration voltage V_\\\\parallel. The acceleration voltage is an important quantity for the design of microwave cavities for particle accelerators. See also shunt impedance. For the special case of an electrostatic field that is surpassed by a particle, the acceleration voltage is directly given by integrating the electric field along its path. The following considerations are generalized for time-dependent fields.  Longitudinal voltage  The longitudinal effective acceleration voltage is given by the kinetic energy gain experienced by a particle with velocity \\\\beta c along a defined straight path (path integral of the longitudinal Lorentz forces) divided by its charge, V_\\\\parallel(\\\\beta) = \\\\frac 1 q \\\\vec e_s \\\\cdot \\\\int \\\\vec F_L(s,t) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}s = \\\\frac 1 q \\\\vec e_s \\\\cdot \\\\int \\\\vec F_L(s, t = \\\\frac{s}{\\\\beta c}) \\\\,\\\\mathrm d s . For resonant structures, e.g. SRF cavities, this may be expressed as a Fourier integral, because the fields \\\\vec E,\\\\vec B, and the resulting Lorentz force \\\\vec F_L, are proportional to \\\\exp(i \\\\omega t) (eigenmodes) V_\\\\parallel(\\\\beta) = \\\\frac{1}{q} \\\\vec e_s \\\\cdot \\\\int \\\\vec F_L(s) \\\\exp\\\\left(i \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\beta c} s\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm d s = \\\\frac{1}{q} \\\\vec e_s \\\\cdot \\\\int \\\\vec F_L(s) \\\\exp\\\\left(i k_\\\\beta s\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm d s with k_\\\\beta = \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{\\\\beta c} Since the particles kinetic energy can only be changed by electric fields, this reduces to V_\\\\parallel(\\\\beta) = \\\\int E_s(s) \\\\exp\\\\left(i k_\\\\beta s\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm d s  Particle Phase considerations  Note that by the given definition, V_\\\\parallel is a complex quantity. This is advantageous, since the relative phase between particle and the experienced field was fixed in the previous considerations (the particle travelling through s=0 experienced maximum electric force). To account for this degree of freedom, an additional phase factor \\\\phi is included in the eigenmode field definition E_s(s,t) = E_s(s) \\\\; \\\\exp\\\\left(i \\\\omega t + i \\\\phi \\\\right) which leads to a modified expression V_\\\\parallel(\\\\beta) = e^{i \\\\phi} \\\\int E_s(s) \\\\exp\\\\left(i k_\\\\beta s\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm d s for the voltage. In comparison to the former expression, only a phase factor with unit length occurs. Thus, the absolute value of the complex quantity  V_\\\\parallel(\\\\beta)  is independent of the particle-to-eigenmode phase \\\\phi. It represents the maximum achievable voltage that is experienced by a particle with optimal phase to the applied field, and is the relevant physical quantity.  Transit time factor  A quantity named transit time factor T(\\\\beta) = \\\\frac{V_\\\\parallel}{V_0} is often defined which relates the effective acceleration voltage V_\\\\parallel(\\\\beta) to the time-independent acceleration voltage V_0 = \\\\int E(s)\\\\,\\\\mathrm d s. In this notation, the effective acceleration voltage V_\\\\parallel is often expressed as V_0 T.  Transverse voltage  In symbolic analogy to the longitudinal voltage, one can define effective voltages in two orthogonal directions x,y that are transversal to the particle trajectory V_{x,y} = \\\\frac{1}{q} \\\\vec e_{x,y} \\\\cdot \\\\int \\\\vec F_L(s) \\\\exp\\\\left(i k_\\\\beta s\\\\right)\\\\,\\\\mathrm d s which describe the integrated forces that deflect the particle from its design path. Since the modes that deflect particles may have arbitrary polarizations, the transverse effective voltage may be defined using polar notation by V_\\\\perp^2(\\\\beta) = V_x^2 + V_y^2, \\\\quad \\\\alpha = \\\\arctan \\\\frac{\\\\tilde V_y}{\\\\tilde V_x} with the polarization angle \\\\alpha The tilde-marked variables are not absolute values, as one might expect, but can have positive or negative sign, to enable a range [-\\\\pi/2,+\\\\pi/2] for \\\\alpha. For example, if \\\\tilde V_x =  V_x  is defined, then \\\\tilde V_y = V_y \\\\cdot \\\\exp(-i \\\\arg V_x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb R must hold. Note that this transverse voltage does not necessarily relate to a real change in the particles energy, since magnetic fields are also able to deflect particles. Also, this is an approximation for small-angle deflection of the particle, where the particles trajectory through the field can still be approximated by a straight line.

Its naming rights are owned by the PPL Corporation, which is headquartered in Allentown. PPL paid an undisclosed sum over 10 years. Overview The arena is part of a larger redevelopment project of the central business district of Allentown. The project encompasses a 5-acre square block area, in which several new structures are planned to be erected: Part of the arena site was previously developed in the 1980s as an office building called Corporate Plaza. On February 23, 1994, it collapsed into a sinkhole, due to limestone in the ground and the decision to not place the building on a concrete pad, but rather on spread footings; the plaza was imploded on March 19 of that year. Inside the arena is a new ground-floor studio that houses WFMZ-TV's news operation. Competition on building sites Construction of the PPL Center in September 2013. Rebuilding an arena on the site of the Spectrum in Philadelphia was rejected in favor of the more profitable Xfinity Live! project and a new 180-room Renaissance by Marriott hotel. The competition to build a new arena for the Phantoms in 2008 was primarily between Allentown and Camden, New Jersey. While Camden was closer, Allentown had a more elaborate proposal which helped secure Allentown's bid for the team. Plans to build the PPL Center at the corner of 7th and Hamilton Streets in downtown Allentown were announced in late 2009. For much of 2009 and 2010, the focus of the project was on securing funding. The project took a major leap forward in 2011, when several properties were purchased by the city to help clear the way for the project to begin. By the end of January 2012, all of the properties had been purchased with final demolition of all buildings occurring in early February 2012. Sports The arena plays host to one local minor league sports team, the Lehigh Valley Phantoms of the American Hockey League. It had been home to the Lehigh Valley Steelhawks, an indoor football team, who played four seasons in the arena from 2015 to 2018. It also served as the site for the last remaining home games and two home playoff games for the Arena Football League's Philadelphia Soul due to the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia hosting the Democratic National Convention in 2016. The arena has hosted an NHL preseason game \\"Flyers in the Valley\\" every year since 2016. Since 2016 it hosts the Allentown Indoor Race, a midget car racing event of the Indoor Auto Racing Championship Series. Parking On May 31, 2011 a comprehensive parking analysis conducted by Traffic Planning and Design, Inc. (TPD) was submitted to Allentown Economic Development Corporation. The analysis stated the total number of parking spaces within the study area, between the public and private parking garages and surface lots, was of approximately 7,376 parking spaces. As a result of this parking analysis, the existing spaces and proposed construction of an additional 500 parking spaces to be built with this development, will adequately accommodate the highest peak period parking demands of the proposed Allentown arena and mixed-used development. In comparison, Coca-Cola Park on Allentown's east side has 2,500 parking spots available. Traffic Also on May 31, 2011 a comprehensive traffic analysis conducted by Traffic Planning and Design, Inc. (TPD) was submitted to Allentown Economic Development Corporation. The report stated that the existing roadway infrastructure can accommodate the new traffic generated by the proposed development. Conditions will be further improved with the recommended improvements. Controversy Some concern about the PPL Center is centered on the cost of the arena relative to the cost of other dedicated American Hockey League arenas in the country. Nathan Benefield, the director of Public Analysis for The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, a Pennsylvania free-market think tank which opposes public funding of stadiums, believes that the PPL Center benefited from funding a plan with no cap on public money beyond the annual revenue generated by the zone. As of October 2012, $224.3 million in bonds have been sold.

Races vary from mostly obstacles such as Ninja Warrior \\"Ninja Races\\", to track races, to urban and cross country events. In cross country events, mud and trail runs are often combined and the races are designed to result in mental and physical collapse. Obstacles may include climbing over walls, carrying heavy objects, traversing bodies of water, crawling under barbed wire, and jumping through fire. Many obstacles are similar to those used in military training, while others are unique to obstacle racing and are employed throughout the course to test endurance, strength, speed and, dexterity. Races vary in distance and difficulty, often combining trail running, road running, and cross country running. With race venues typically in sports stadiums, ski resorts, cities and parks, organizers encourage athletes of all types to participate. Many military training obstacles were introduced into Cross Country Running at Tough Guy. According to the Los Angeles Times in 2012, the number of events—typically all-day festivals—rose rapidly. Supporting the sports popularity,several on-line magazines including Mud Run Guide and Obstacle Racing Media were launched. A print version Obstacle Race Magazine had a short run starting 2012. Followed by OCRM Network in 2017, an Online Media Outlet dedicated to entertainment, information and Live Coverage of World OCR events that is breaking ground in Live Streaming OCR Events, along with TV shows, TV Series and Documentaries on the Sport.  History  1900 Olympics Obstacle Swim  Ancient history  From the stadion, the oldest event of the Ancient Olympic Games, to the contemporary era steeplechase, obstacles of some sort have been presented to athletes for thousands of years. The Ancient Olympic Pentathlon included five events contested over one day, thought to have started with the stadion (a short foot race) followed by the Javelin throw, Discus throw, Long jump and ending with wrestling. The event was first held at the 18th Ancient Olympiad around 708 BC, and is quite similar to the modern day Spartan Race, which includes running, javelin (spear) throw, jumping and wrestling with various objects and weights.  Early history  The concept of using obstacles for competition has been in use since the 1800s, including the 200m Obstacle Swim at the 1900 Summer Olympic Games in Paris, with the first formal land based races in the Obstacle Run of Military Pentathlon, first held at the Military Physical Training Centre, at Freiburg, in the French occupation zone in Germany, in August 1947. Only Belgian, Dutch, and French teams took part in the competition. Since 1950, annual world championships have been held. The sport has grown in popularity, and now over 138 countries participate in the World Military Games. The sport's governing body, the International Military Sports Council (CISM), now also organise pentathlons aimed at naval and air force personnel.  Modern history  It is widely thought that Tough Guy is the earliest contemporary OCR, with the first race held in 1987. The race has been running continually since its inception and continues to attract contemporary and professional athletes. The Survival Run also emerged in the late 1980s as a competition in the Netherlands. This originated as a way to run across the Dutch rural landscape, crossing streams, canals and other natural terrain. Events like Hang-On Run can trace their origins back to Survival Running. The HiTec Adventure Racing Series (1996 - 2002) was an early version of the contemporary race and included \\"special tests\\" (man made obstacles with walls, nets, etc.), mountain biking and kayaking. The Balance Bar races in the United States expanded on the success of the Hi Tech series, including a televised national series and championships. The Muddy Buddy races in the United States (results here) were a national obstacle race series produced by Competitor Group from 1999 to 2013 and was the first major series to introduce mud elements and remove additional equipment. Muddy Buddy was the event format that transitioned adventure racing to obstacle racing as we know today. Military Obstacle Course  Contemporary races  In 2011, approximately one million people registered to participate in obstacle racing events in the United States (US), 4.5 million in 2015, 5.6 million in 2016 and over 6 million in 2017. Globally the number of participants is thought to be 20 million. There are many variations of obstacle race courses that accommodate a wide variety of athletes. Ninja races such as the Wolfpack Ninja Tour are typically 50 m to 100 m in length with many obstacles and little running. OCR track races are typically held on athletic tracks and vary between 400 m and 5,000 m. Cross country courses range from one mile and up, with most races between 5 km and 10 miles. Longer endurance races vary up to 100 miles, including Spartan Beast, Ultra Beast and Agoge. Fixed time events include World's Toughest Mudder (24 hours), Spartan Ultra World Championships and the 36 hour Agoge. Obstacle Course Races with inflatable obstacles are becoming increasingly popular, including Britain's GUNG-HO race. thumb  Development of the sport  Spartan Race founder Joe Desena set a goal to take the sport to the Olympics and tapped event and television producer Ian Adamson for the task in 2014. He subsequently founded the international sporting federation, now known as World OCR, the Fédération Internationale de Sport d’Obstacles (FISO), based in Lausanne, Switzerland. World OCR is a non- profit, member based sporting organization and the sole world governing body for Obstacle Course Racing. As of 2020, World OCR had national member federations in 106 countries in four continental regions (Africa, Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Europe), the largest number being in Europe. World OCR applied for membership of GAISF in 2017, with a goal of having obstacle course racing and related disciplines recognized as an international sport by the International Olympic Committee. It has been noted that World OCR has no member race organizations. As a not for profit sporting federation the only members of World OCR are national federations (national governing bodies.) The members the national federations are the athletes. Brands and for profit corporations are not members of sporting federations, but can be recognized or aligned under certain circumstances. In the summer of 2017 an application by UIPM (Modern Pentathlon) to add obstacle laser run as a mixed team medal event was rejected for the 2020 Olympics. Full medal events for OCR were included for the first time in an International Multisport Games in the 2019 South East Asia Games. Medal events were approved for 100 m, 400 m and 5 km distances. The SEA Games are under regulation of the Southeast Asian Games Federation (SEAGF) with supervision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA). OCR Asian Championship Podium The sport disciplines of Ninja (American Ninja Warrior), OCR and Adventure Racing became self governing sub-sports of World OCR in 2020, in a model similar to Aquatics. In August 2020 World OCR and the International Parkour Federation (IPF) signed a Memorandum of Understanding to unify Obstacle Sports worldwide under a governance model similar to Aquatics (FINA). IPF had signed an MOU with Gymnastics (FIG) in January 2018, but were unable to come to an agreement and the term expired. The OCR 100m international standard format (used in the SEA Games) was first presented in Europe at OCR Polska's 2020 Polish Championships. This event had over 55 million facebook views within 2 weeks.  Athlete Development  In recent years, obstacle course racing has been emerging onto the college scene in the United States. Universities, like Texas A&M; University, have launched organizations and club teams that feature obstacle course training. The first Youth OCR World Championships is being introduced in November 2018, with the first races in the Manila, Philippines. This race is modeled on the World Schools Championships run by ISF, the International School Sport Federation. The first University OCR World Championships is being held in November 2018 in conjunction with the Youth OCR World Championships and is designed to meet the requirements of FISU, the International University Sports Federation.  Notable events   Muddy Buddy  Muddy Buddy (1999 - 2010) was the first national OCR series in the United States emphasising man made obstacles and mud. Unlike later OCRs it included a bike leg, making it a \\"ride and run\\" OCR. The event series was produced by Competitor Group and sponsored by Columbia in later years. Muddy Buddy ultimately went out of business under pressure from Tough Mudder and Warrior Dash which had simpler run-obstacle formats.  Rugged Maniac  Rugged Maniac 2015. Four men offer a helping hand up the Warped Wall in Rugged Maniac. Rugged Maniac was founded in 2010 by former lawyers Brad Scudder and Rob Dickens. The very first race was held in October 2010, in Southwick, Massachusetts. It has since expanded to 24 cities over the United States and Canada. In 2014, they were featured on ABC's Shark Tank and secured a $1.75 million deal with Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the Dallas Mavericks. On January 16, 2016, Rugged Maniac (Under their company name Rugged Races LLC), appeared again on Shark Tank in an update video. Since first appearing on the show, the Rugged Maniac event has expanded to Canada, increased in sales from $4.2 million to $10.5 million before and after Shark Tank, expanded to 28 cities, and created a second race called \\"The Costume Dash 5K\\", which debuted in Boston in October 2015. Rugged Maniac features 25 obstacles over a 5 kilometer (3.1 mile) course. It is designed to be more family-friendly and catered to people of all fitness levels, due to the shorter distance but larger number of obstacles. The run ends with an all-day festival of beer, food, mechanical bull riding, adult-sized bounce houses, and sponsor exhibition booths.  Spartan Race  Spartan Race (2010) was an outgrowth of the annual Death Race (started in 2005), with courses vary in distance and difficulty from \\"Sprint\\" courses (3+ mile with 20+ obstacles ), to \\"Super\\" (8+ mile with 20+ obstacles), and \\"Beast\\" course (13+ mile with 30-35+ obstacles). For endurance enthusiasts, Spartan also offers the \\"Ultra Beast\\" which is 2 times through the \\"Beast\\" course (later change to \\"Ultra\\" for 30 miles) and the \\"Hurricane Heat\\" which involves tasks that set up the obstacle course the night before. Average finishing times for the events range from 30 minutes to 6 hours, depending on the particular course and fitness level of the racer. Race venues are located around the world and have included ski slopes, state parks, paint ball parks, and more. Any competitor who completes a Sprint, Super, and Beast in one calendar year (Jan. 1 - Dec. 31) is said to have completed the Spartan Trifecta. In the US, the Spartan Race World Championship was held in Killington, Vermont from 2012 until 2015 when it was moved to Squaw Valley near Lake Tahoe. The World Championship has been held in Squaw Valley in Olympic Valley, CA near Lake Tahoe every year since 2015. Prizes for World Championships in 2016 included: Overall Champions (Men' and Women's) 1st place $15,000, 2nd place $10,000, 3rd place $5,000, 4th place $4,000, 5th place $3,000; Elite Beast Championship (Men & Women's – 40+) 1st place $500, 2nd place $200, 3rd place $100; and Elite Ultra Beast Championship (Men & Women's) 1st place $1,000; 2nd place $500; 3rd place $250; 4th place $100; 5th place $100. Spartan Winter Race The first Spartan Race World Championship was held in December 2011 in Glen Rose, Texas as an eight-mile Spartan Race course comprising 36 obstacles and included a US$20,000 prize purse. Beginning in 2012, the Spartan Race World Championships were held annually in Killington, Vermont, and at Squaw Valley, CA since 2015 with a total of $500,000 in cash and prizes. Spartan Races have occurred in more than 30 other countries around the world. According to event organizers, obstacles vary from race to race. Obstacles during a Spartan Race can include climbing under barbed wire, wall climbing, mud crawling, a javelin throw, a rope climb, heavy object carries, slippery walls, a zig-zag log jump, steep mud climbs, tire flips and rope swings. Spartan Races hosted the Kids World Championship which was held on November 17, 2018. Boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 13 from around the world participated in the race.  Tough Mudder  Tough Mudder Funky Monkey In 2010, Tough Mudder's first event was held in May 2010. The Tough Mudder is not technically a race and is instead focused on teamwork and completion of the event rather than finishing under a certain time. Tough Mudder courses are between 10 and 12 miles and contain various military style obstacles. The final event of the Tough Mudder season is the World's Toughest Mudder. This is a 24-hour event in which competitors will run a shorter Tough Mudder course that has much more intense obstacles than a normal Tough Mudder and is designed to be more grueling as well. The goal for a participant in World's Toughest Mudder is to complete as many laps as possible within a 24 hours period. The athletes (solo male, solo female, team) who complete the most laps are declared the World's Toughest Mudder. The top male and female each receive $10,000 and the top team receives $12,000 (total).  Warrior Dash  The Warrior Dash was founded in 2009. Because Warrior Dash does not assign penalties for skipped obstacles, it is often considered an obstacle course event rather than a race. While Warrior Dash does not meet all the requirements to be considered a race, organizers do award their top finishers with non-cash prizes. All finishers receive a \\"warrior helmet\\" – a horned helmet. As a shorter event, winning times for a Warrior Dash may be as short as 15 minutes. While Warrior Dash features many of the same obstacles found at other races such as mud crawls, water features, and cargo net climbs. It was announced on July 31, 2019 that Red Frog Promotions would be shutting down their operations including Warrior Dash. Spartan Race purchased some of their assets, and instead of refunds for future events, Spartan would provide a replacement entry.  Terrain Racing  Terrain Racing has 40 races in the United States each year on 5 km courses with 20+ obstacles.  Chakravyuh Challenge  Founded in 2016 and named after the near-invincible battle formation from Indian mythology (Chakravyuha), the Chakravyuh Challenge is the first obstacle course race to be hosted in the state of Kerala in India. The competition tests the participants' agility, bravery and problem solving capability by pitting them against obstacles involving slush, water, ropes, inclined slopes, team building exercises, fun mazes and more. The race is open to both men and women and held in three variations - Individual Competitive Category, Team Challenge and Fun Run. With separate cash prizes awarded to the male and female winners of the first two categories. The obstacle race is part of a three-day adventure fest, held annually and the circuit itself is designed every year by former Indian Navy commandos.

Notable European events  Icy watermoat at Getting Tough - The Race Rough Runner Launching in the UK in 2015 as a reaction to the hard-core image created by the multitude of tough, military-style obstacle events, Rough Runner introduced an event with multiple distance options to cater to a wider array of fitness levels with a 5 km, 10 km and 15 km course to choose from. To reinforce the message of accessibility, Rough Runner's obstacles are inspired by fun-but-challenging TV game shows such as Gladiators, Total Wipeout and Ninja Warrior, with each event featuring The Travelator as the finish line obstacle. Nuclear Races Operating from their permanent site in Brentwood Essex, Nuclear races are fast becoming the most well received and attended event within the UK. They hold different events in April, September and November. Amongst their many obstacles is their signature \\"Death Slide\\" and the worlds longest permanent monkey bars.

(IRD), renamed Blumont, is an organization that purports to provide relief, stabilization, and development programs worldwide. In 2015, IRD was the subject of a Washington Post investigation that highlighted the organization's performance and management of taxpayer money. Among other irregularities, the organization had charged the US Government $1.1 million for staff parties and retreats at exclusive resorts. In January 2016, IRD announced that it was changing its name to Blumont and relocating to Madison, Wisconsin. According to Blumont, its mission is to deliver \\"innovative, evidence based, locally driven solutions that advance the aspirations of people, communities and donor partners worldwide\\". In 2011, more than 80% of IRD's $500 million annual budget came from USAID.Reviews prompt suspension of Iraqi jobs program, USA Today, July 26, 2009. In recent years, Blumont has completed work in the Middle East, South America, Asia, and Africa for governmental entities in the U.S. and Britain, such as USAID and DFID and for organizations such as the World Bank and the United Nations.  Leadership   Founder  Dr. Arthur B. Keys, Jr. founded IRD in 1998. As of 2012, Keys claimed more than 30 years of experience with domestic and international humanitarian assistance, economic development, and food/agriculture programs and oversaw nearly $525 million annually for global development assistance. According to 2007 tax records, Keys was paid $552,722, more than the salary of his counterparts at similar organizations. Keys' wife, daughter and brother-in-law took home an additional $265,278 in salary and benefits.Review: High salaries for aid group CEOs August 31, 2009. In 2015, it was reported that federal investigators were examining the expenses of Keys and his wife, Jasna Basaric-Keys. Amid investigation, Keys retired from IRD and moved to a farm in Western Pennsylvania's Washington County in 2015. Previously, Keys was the Executive Director of Interfaith Impact for Justice and Peace, the Secretary for Public Ministries of the United Church Board for Homeland Ministries, and the President of the consulting firm Keys and Associates.2005 Yale Divinity School Alumni Award Recipients 2005 Yale Divinity School Alumni Award Recipients, Retrieved December 12, 2011.

He is currently a member of the Board of Trustees at Bethany. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Humane Letters from Bethany. He is also the recipient of the William Sloane Coffin ’56 Award for Justice and Peace given annually by Yale Divinity School and was honored in Atlanta as a 2011 Emory University History Maker and by the Emory University Alumni Board with the 2009 Emory Medal for his years of humanitarian service.  President & CEO  Roger Ervin assumed leadership of IRD in December 2014 , and now serves as the President and CEO of Blumont. Ervin has been working for over 28 years in government, academic and private sector roles. Before Blumont, Ervin worked as Senior Vice President for Global Markets at LMI. He also teaches management courses as an adjunct professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Business and at the UW Department of Political Science  Operations  Much of IRD's work for USAID is performed under cooperative agreements, which are more flexible than contracts, with fewer deadlines and demands. The arrangement makes it difficult to hold IRD accountable because deadlines and deliverables are rarely specified. For years, USAID relied heavily on these agreements, partly because they required less oversight from the agency, according to government auditors. The company's rapid acquisition of USAID contracts has prompted some to label it a Beltway Bandit. Employees who left IRD were asked to sign confidentiality agreements stipulating that they could be sued for making disparaging remarks about the organization, potentially violating whistleblower protection In 2015, USAID suspended IRD from future federal contracting. Among other irregularities, the organization had charged the US Government $1.1 million for staff parties and retreats at exclusive resorts. but IRD filed suit and a district court voided the suspension. The court lead by Judge Royce Lamberth found that USAID had not followed several federal guidelines in its investigation of IRD, and ruled their suspension illegal. USAID nullified and vacated the suspension and retracted any statements asserting that the suspension was valid or appropriate. Employees who left IRD were asked to sign confidentiality agreements. IRD routinely hired individuals who previously worked for USAID, including former acting administrator Alonzo Fulgham. In 2014, it was reported that at least 19 former USAID employees had been hired, some of whom were previously responsible for oversight of the organization. IRD hired the lobbying firm Wexler & Walker to develop its media strategy. Their 2010 guidance said that the most important message for senior IRD officials to remember is “We help the most vulnerable people in some of the most insecure parts of the developing world.” '  Afghanistan  In Afghanistan, IRD administered a three-year, $400 million project to build roads in southern and eastern provinces of the country. Multiple problems were identified in IRD's agricultural work in Afghanistan, which involved spending $300 million to help farmers in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. Many of the goods meant for farmers were sold in Pakistan and distorted the local market. Afghan officials derided features of the programming, such as paying farmers for work they would do anyway. IRD claims to have provided 5.4 million days of labor to unemployed men and generated an estimated $200 million through distributed seed. USAID decided not to award an extension of the program to IRD though it provided interim extensions until another implementer could be found.U.S. military dismayed by delays in 3 key development projects in Afghanistan Washington Post, April 22, 2011. In June 2020, the company was sued for with paying bribes, or protection money, to the Taliban in a lawsuit brought by families of American victims. During its lucrative work in Afghanistan, Blumont (then IRD), may have violated the Anti- Terrorism Act which makes it illegal for any individual or entity to provide material support to the Taliban.  Balkans  In 2001 IRD was one of five NGOs selected by USAID to implement the Community Development through Democratic Action (CRDA) Program in Serbia. The program cost US taxpayers $200 million and ran from 2001 to 2006. The program aimed to increase civic participation in democratic institutions; provide vocational training; increase local economic output through grants, seminars and counseling. Multiple problems were identified. These include an absence of a monitoring and evaluation system, the termination of activities supporting citizen participation too soon and too abruptly, and the absence of sustainability strategies.  Colombia  Blumont, along with the Colombian government's Victims' Unit and the Norwegian Refugee Council, implemented programming/workshops in Puerto Torres, Caquetá Department, in September 2018 to \\"diagnose the damage suffered by the inhabitants of the region\\" as it relates to armed conflict and the displacement and missing persons associated with it. Workshops help survivors of armed conflict reflect on their lives before, what happened during the conflict, and what damages it has caused afterward. Also in Puerto Torres, Blumont contributed resources to build a communal structure, toolkits, and sports equipment for use in public meetings and educational events.  Indonesia  IRD's first major project was food- aid program in Indonesia that one source has called pioneering. Funded by US taxpayers, IRD took USAID donated wheat and distributed it to noodle factories to increase output and lower prices. IRD provided logistical and managerial support and was able to collect part of the profits from the sale of the noodles. These profits subsequently went into further community reinvestments. The program became a template for similar projects in Cambodia, Niger and Sri Lanka. Iraq In Iraq, USAID funded $644 million to IRD to implement the Community Stabilization Program, a jobs and public works program Iraq. At times, IRD spent more than $1 million a day of USAID money. In a March 2008 audit, the USAID inspector general in Baghdad expressed concern that millions of dollars may have been siphoned off by insurgents.U.S. Nonprofit Screws up Iraq Jobs Program, Now Working on Afghanistan Repeat, Wired, November 11, 2009. In July 2009, USAID suspended IRD's work on the Community Stabilization Program, citing evidence of phantom jobs in addition to possible financial support to insurgents. IRD entered Iraq in 2003 as an implementing partner on the Community Action Program (CAP). The goal of the program was to organize local communities and assist them in prioritizing and implementing regional reconstruction projects. It was closely modeled after community stabilization programs in the Balkans, which IRD had been a part of. A comprehensive audit of the program found that while IRD accomplished some of the stated goals, it overstated the number of beneficiaries. IRD’s completed projects often did not target the prioritized needs of the neighborhoods. Better oversight was needed to deal with frequent shifts in implementation strategies due to the volatile situation in the field. The program was extended twice in 2006 and 2008. Like other organizations in Iraq, IRD found itself unprepared to deal with the deteriorating security situation, and several of the local council officials it was working with were assassinated. It significantly increased spending on security personnel and other administrative overhead to provide better oversight. Additionally many projects were revised to yield results faster and concentrated to only a few neighborhoods.  Jordan  In Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, UNHCR and Blumont worked alonngside many international partners Refugee GIS, RefuGIS. RefuGIS is a project that uses hands-on training in mapping to give refugees in Zaatari empowerment and access to enriched livelihoods and education. It is the \\"world's first GIS project for refugees, by refugees.\\" In January 2018, Angelina Jolie made a visit to Zaatari Camp to visit the TIGER (These Inspiring Girls Enjoy Reading) project, which focuses on education and empowerment in displacement. The UNHCR project, in partnership with IRD/Blumont, is designed to fight the epidemic of refugees dropping out of school. In 2017, the TIGER girls project was presented a special award at the Arab Women of the Year 2017 ceremony. In February 2018, the Peace and Sport organization announced new activities focused on peace building in Zaatari Camp, launched in collaboration with IRD/Blumont, as well as UNHCR, the International Table Tennis Federation, the Fédération Internationale de Teqball, and the World Association of Kickboxing Organizations. The activities include sports coaching seminars for refugees, as well as working with the Zaatari Women Commission and the TIGER girls to promote the program and disseminate \\"peace values and gender equity through sport activities.\\"  Mali  In Mali, IRD/Blumont, under DFID's BRACED program, is implementing the \\"Wati Yelema Labenw\\" program that is strengthening resilience to climate disasters of vulnerable populations in Koulikoro, Segou, and Mopti. Through work on social cohesion, livelihoods, natural resource management and governance, the program directly reaches 2,400 people and builds off the results of the previous RIC4REC project (Strengthening Community Initiatives for Climate Resilience).  Pakistan  Blumont and partner organization implement the USAID-funded Sindh Community Mobilization Program (CMP) as part of USAID and the Government of Sindh's Sindh Basic Education Program. The five-year program operates in Khairpur, Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, Kamber Shahdadkot, Jacobabad, and Kashmore and five towns in Karachi. The program utilizes community mobilization to work toward increasing the enrollment of girls in schools and improving kids' health and hygiene.

He is known for defrauding Nelson Sakaguchi, a Director at Brazil's Banco Noroeste based in São Paulo, of $242 million: $191 million in cash and the remainder in the form of outstanding interest, between 1995 and 1998. His accomplices were Emmanuel Ofolue, Nzeribe Okoli, and Obum Osakwe, along with the husband and wife duo, Christian Ikechukwu Anajemba and Amaka Anajemba, with Christian later being assassinated. After Nick Leeson's trading losses at Barings Bank, and the looting of the Iraqi Central Bank by Qusay Hussein, the crime was the third largest in banking history. After a large-scale attack on a town in Nigeria in August 2016, Nwude was alleged to be a ringleader and was arrested on murder charges. He remains in custody. Fraud Nwude impersonated Paul Ogwuma, then Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, and successfully convinced Sakaguchi to \\"invest\\" in a new airport in the nation's capital, Abuja, in exchange for a $10 million commission. In August 1997, the Spanish Banco Santander wanted to take over the Banco Noroeste Brazil. The fraud was uncovered after a December 1997 joint board meeting, in which an official from Santander inquired about why a large sum of money, two-fifths of Noroeste's total value and half of their capital, was sitting in the Cayman Islands unmonitored. This led to criminal investigations in Brazil, Britain, Nigeria, Switzerland, and the United States. To guarantee the sale to Santander, the Simonsen and Cochrane families, the owners of Banco Noroeste, paid the $242 million bill themselves. However, Banco Noroeste collapsed in 2001. Aftermath and trial At the request of former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission was created by the Nigerian Parliament in 2002. In February 2004, Amaka Anajemba, Emmanuel Nwude, Emmanuel Ofolue, Nzeribe Okoli, and Obum Osakwe (Christian Anajemba was deceased at this point), were all arrested and charged in the Abuja High Court with 86 counts of \\"fraudulently seeking advance fees\\" and 15 counts of bribery related to the case. They pleaded not guilty. They were immediately warned off of bribing the court staff by Abuja High Court Judge Lawal Gumi, after he alleged that money was going around. The defense team assured that \\"nothing would be done to bring scandal to the administration of justice.\\" Four Nigerian companies, Fynbaz, Emrus, Ocean Marketing and the African Shelter Bureau also faced charges and pleaded not guilty. In July 2004, Judge Lawal Gumi threw out the case, claiming that since the crime did not take place in Abuja, he had no jurisdiction, and said that the proper place for the case would be the Lagos High Court. The defendants were immediately rearrested after stepping outside the courthouse and the case was moved to Lagos. In 2005, Nwude attempted to bribe Nuhu Ribadu, then head of the commission, with $75,000 cash. He was charged in connection with the attempted bribery in addition to the attempted kidnapping of a prosecution witness. In July 2005, Amaka Anajemba admitted to helping Anajemba and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison and ordered to repay $25.5 million. During Nwude's trial, there was a bomb scare that caused the courthouse to be evacuated. Emmanuel Nwude and Nzeribe Okoli pleaded guilty after testimony from Sakaguchi in hopes of a more lenient sentence, and were sentenced to 29 years in prison collectively, with Nwude receiving five concurrent sentences of five years, totaling 25, and Okoli receiving four. The entirety of Nwude's assets were confiscated to be returned to the victim and a $10 million fine was imposed to be paid to the Nigerian federal government. It was the first major conviction for the EFCC.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&dat;=20051205&id;=dvdRAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=jXIDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=6748,6062960 He was released from prison in 2006. Nwude filed a lawsuit to recover his seized assets after he was released from prison, on the grounds that some of the assets were acquired before the offense was committed. He has already reclaimed at least $52 Million. As of May 8, 2015, the matter is being heard by the Lagos Division of the Court of Appeal. Murder charges On August 19, 2016, the town of Ukpo in the Dunukofia area was attacked by over 200 people, apparently due to a land dispute with the neighboring Abagana community. Four policemen were shot, and Emmanuel Okafor, a security guard at a construction site, was killed. The Anambra State Police Command alleged that Emmanuel Nwude was a ringleader, and arrested him on 27 charges including murder, attempted murder, and terrorist attacks. His case has been adjourned until January 16, 2017. He is currently being held at Awka Prison in Anambra State, where there is fear of a jailbreak due to Nwude's wealth and status.

Currently conducted by Hilary Campbell, it has around 180 auditioned members. The choir stages at least three concerts annually at the Colston Hall in Bristol with professional orchestras and soloists, and another annually at Bristol Cathedral in addition to other performances and broadcasts in Bristol and further afield. Beginnings Bristol Choral Society was founded in 1889 by George Riseley, then organist of Bristol Cathedral. Its first performance was at the Colston Hall on 7 May 1890 – Mendelssohn's St. Paul (oratorio) with a choir exceeding 500 singers – and it has been performing principally at the Colston Hall ever since.Rejoice Greatly Bristol Choral Society 1889-1989, George S. Bowen, White Tree Books, Bristol, 1989. A few weeks later, the Society accepted its first invitation to sing outside Bristol, being asked by Augustus Manns to sing the same work at the Crystal Palace, London joining other choirs to number some 5,500 singers in total. The second Bristol concert was the first Bristol performance of A German Requiem (Brahms) in December 1890. Messiah at the Colston Hall On 21 December 1892, Bristol Choral Society gave its first performance of Handel's Messiah at the Colston Hall. It proved so popular, regularly attracting sell-out audiences, that it has been performed every year since, usually on the Saturday before Christmas at the Colston Hall, with the exception of only ten years: 1896, 1898 and 1899 while Colston Hall was rebuilt following fire, 1914 and 1915 due to World War I, 1931, 1940 due to World War II, 1951 and 2011 (when it was replaced with performances of Bach's Christmas Oratorio) and 2017 when it was replaced with a concert of Christmas music. Between 1972 and 1992 two performances were given annually, on the two Saturdays leading up to Christmas. 2012 marked the 120th anniversary of the choir's Messiah at Colston Hall with Messiah once again performed on the Saturday before Christmas - 120 years and 1 day after the first at that venue. Since 2006, the choir has performed all of Messiah from memory. In 2010, an afternoon 'Mini Messiah' family concert preceding the evening full performance was added in order to introduce children to Messiah with an abridged version. This attracted a large audience and was repeated in November 2011 despite there being no complete Messiah performance that year. With the return of the Christmas Messiah performance in 2012, the Mini Messiah family concert returned to the traditional date of the Saturday before Christmas (preceding the complete evening performance) where it will remain an annual fixture. 1890s–1940s From its foundation until the 1940s, the Society continued to stage several concerts annually (as many as 6, including concert performances of operas in addition to the more usual oratorio repertoire of such a choir) at the Colston Hall, even during times of war. The BBC Music Department, Orchestras and Chorus moved to Bristol during the 1939/40 season, enabling the Society's concerts to be staged as planned, but now in conjunction with the BBC and Bristol Philharmonic Society. Bristol Choral Society's annual report of 1940 reports that those concerts were broadcast on BBC radio, and messages of appreciation received from as far away as Italy. The concert programme for the 6 April 1941 Colston Hall performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion under Sir Adrian Boult was headed with the following note: ::::\\"In the event of an air-raid warning being received a notice will be displayed from the organ loft. The concert will continue, but patrons wishing to leave may do so.\\" The Colston Hall survived the bombs that brought much destruction all around it, but succumbed to a stray cigarette end in 1945. Until the opening of the newly re-built Colston Hall in 1951, the choir principally performed at Central Hall, Old Market (closed in 1985 and now apartments), including the 1945 Messiah performance with soloists Isobel Baillie and Kathleen Ferrier. 1950s–present day With the opening of the newly re-built Colston Hall in 1951, the modern-day pattern of three annual concerts at the Hall (typically November, Messiah at Christmas and March) became established, with a regular fourth summer concert at one of the city's Cathedrals being added in the 1990s, since 2001 at Bristol Cathedral. Since 1990, membership of the choir has been by audition, and periodic re-audition every two or three years. The choir remains one of the biggest in the region with a membership of around 180 auditioned singers and maintains its reputation as one of the premier symphony choruses in the South West of England. It stages concerts of a very high standard, regularly working with top professional orchestras such as the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, CBSO, distinguished baroque ensembles and internationally renowned soloists such as Emma Johnson (clarinetist) and tenor Mark Padmore in the 2011 season. In addition to the established concert season, the choir also undertakes other engagements further afield, foreign tours and community, outreach and education work in and around Bristol. In recent years, the choir has been invited to collaborate with other choirs such as the Philharmonia Chorus, London Symphony Chorus and the BBC National Chorus of Wales on many occasions to tackle some of the choral pieces requiring even greater choral forces such as Mahler's Eighth Symphony, Janáček's Glagolitic Mass, the Dvorak Stabat Mater and La Damnation de Faust by Berlioz. Many of these performances were under the batons of the choir's late Presidents Richard Hickox and Sir Charles Mackerras and included concerts at The Proms and broadcasts on BBC Radio 3. The recording of the live broadcast of Janáček's Glagolitic Mass with Richard Hickox was issued as the cover CD of the February 2009 issue of BBC Music Magazine (Vol.17 No.6) as part of that issue's tribute to Richard Hickox. In late 2011, it was announced that tenor Mark Padmore was to become a joint President of Bristol Choral Society, alongside the Lord Mayor of Bristol (a position held by the Lord Mayor since 1900). The choir is also often engaged to provide the chorus for concerts organised by other organisations, such as Elgar's The Kingdom for the Elgar Festival with the English Symphony Orchestra under conductor Vernon Handley at Worcester cathedral in 2006, Tolga Kashif's Queen Symphony at the Colston Hall and The Anvil, Basingstoke with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by the composer, Carmina Burana (Orff) for the National Children's Orchestra of Great Britain at the Colston Hall in April 2011 and Vaughan Williams' Sinfonia antartica for the BBC National Orchestra of Wales at the Colston Hall on 20 November 2011 which was subsequently broadcast on BBC Radio 3. In April 2014, the choir sang in 2 performances of Janáček's Glagolitic Mass at Colston Hall and Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, London by invitation of the Philharmonia Orchestra, under conductor Jakub Hrůša. In November 2014 the choir joined with the BBC National Chorus of Wales for a performance of Elgar's Dream of Gerontius. In spring 2016 it performed Vaughan Williams' Sea Symphony with the Philharmonia Orchestra under the direction of John Wilson. Choir members have several times in recent years been invited to join with the BBC National Chorus of Wales in Promenade concerts, including Mahler's Eighth Symphony in 2018. Hilary Campbell became the choir's first female conductor in April 2016. In addition to the established concert season, the choir also undertakes other engagements further afield, foreign tours (Germany in 2017 and 2019, Portugal in 2018) and community, outreach and education work in and around Bristol. Because of the continued closure of Colston Hall for the rebuilding of its interior (originally scheduled for 2017-19), the choir has given most of its concerts in Bristol Cathedral since January 2018, apart from Messiah performances in Clifton Cathedral and Redmaids%27 High School. In January 2020 Bristol Choral Society made a recording of music by Bob Chilcott, Cecilia McDowall and Judith Weir for Delphian Records. No further performances were possible in the 2019-20 season because of the COVID-19 pandemic, though the choir continued to have virtual rehearsals each week.

Originating from a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone in late-August, Uleki was identified as a tropical depression well to the southeast of Hawaii on August 28\\\\. Steady organization ensued as it moved west, becoming a tropical storm on August 30 and a hurricane on August 31\\\\. Rapid intensification took place thereafter and the storm reached its peak intensity on September 2 as a Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone found peak winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 957 mbar (hPa; 28.26 inHg). Thereafter, Uleki stalled for two days to the southwest of Hawaii, resulting in heavy surf across the state. The dangerous swells killed two people on Oahu. Unfavorable environmental conditions caused weakening of the hurricane by September 4 as it resumed a west-northwest course away from Hawaii. Conditions later became favorable and Uleki acquired winds of 105 mph (165 mph) on September 7, constituting its secondary peak. The hurricane crossed the International Dateline on September 8 and was reclassified as typhoon. Remaining well away from land, the cyclone steadily weakened to a tropical storm by September 12\\\\. Gradually turning north and later east, the degrading cyclone transitioned into an extratropical cyclone four days later and ultimately dissipated on September 17 near the International Dateline.  Meteorological history  In late-August 1988, increased convective activity was noted along the Intertropical Convergence Zone by forecasters at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). An area of low pressure subsequently developed within this disturbance and was designated as Tropical Depression One-C at 12:00 UTC on August 28\\\\. Upon classification, the depression was situated roughly southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii and moving west-northwest. Steady intensification ensued over the following day with the system attaining gale-force winds by 18:00 UTC on August 29, at which time it was assigned the name Uleki. The storm later attained winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) on August 31 and was dubbed a hurricane as it passed south of Hilo. Thereafter, Uleki underwent a sudden period of rapid intensification and achieved major hurricane status later that day. After reaching this strength, Uleki's forward motion gradually lessened and eventually almost ceased altogether on September 1 as upper-level steering currents collapsed. With the hurricane situated to the southwest of the Hawaiian Islands, Hurricane Hunters conducted several weather reconnaissance missions into the storm. On September 2, they found maximum surface winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 957 mbar (hPa; 28.26 inHg); this corresponded to the peak intensity of Uleki. At the time, Uleki displayed a well-organized, tight circulation. The hurricane meandered in the same general area over the next two days, executing several small loops, with a slight northward drift. During this time, its circulation increased in coverage but became less-organized as weakening ensued. Increased wind shear and restricted outflow took their toll on the hurricane. The cyclone's winds dropped to 80 mph (130 km/h) by 12:00 UTC on September 4 as it resumed its west-northwest track under the influence of a subtropical ridge away from the Hawaiian Islands. Uleki passed roughly halfway between Johnston Atoll and the French Frigate Shoals on September 5\\\\. By September 7, the weakened trend halted and environmental conditions favored reintensification. As Uleki neared the International Dateline, it regained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). At 00:00 UTC on September 8, the CPHC transferred warning responsibility of Uleki to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and the storm was subsequently referred to as a typhoon. Transfer of warnings occurred when the storm was at 178°W rather than at the dateline, where the boundary between the Central and West Pacific basins exists, for unknown reasons. Three hours later Uleki made its closest approach to Midway Atoll, passing to the south. Shortly thereafter the system crossed the International Dateline and the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) also began advising on the system. The JMA estimated Uleki to have had a pressure of 945 mb (hPa; 27.91 inHg) at this time; however, this value was derived from satellite estimates rather than direct measurements. Uleki maintained this strength through September 10 as it continued on its west-northwest course. On that day, the typhoon again entered a region of weak steering currents between two anticyclones within the subtropical ridge. A trough approaching from the west was forecast to prompt Uleki to turn east; however, the typhoon maintained a general northwest motion in a stair-stepped fashion. Increasing wind shear and cooler air soon imparted weakening, and Uleki degraded to a tropical storm by September 12. Typhoon Uleki at its secondary peak strength on September 8 Continued effects from shear stripped the cyclone of all deep convection, and by September 14 only a band of cirrus clouds remained in association with Uleki. The JTWC issued their final warning on the system at 00:00 UTC that day accordingly. The JMA maintained the system as a tropical depression as the former typhoon began turning to the east. Uleki later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 16 as it accelerated to the east. The system dissipated the following day near the International Dateline, far from any major landmasses. Preparations and impact As the hurricane stalled to the southwest of Hawaii on September 3, tropical storm watches were issued for Oahu, Kauai, and Niihau. High surf advisories were raised for all islands as well. Following Uleki's turn to the west on September 5, the tropical storm watches were discontinued. The storm's erratic movement proved to be troublesome for forecasters and they continuously warned residents to be cautious and alert should the storm double-back to the state. On September 4, lifeguards at Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Beach rescued 19 people caught in swells. Further north in Oahu, two people drowned after being caught in rough waters. The storm moved roughly halfway between the French Frigate Shoals and Johnston Island on September 5 with no adverse effects in either region due to its weakened state. On September 7, the 300 residents of Midway Atoll and United States Coast Guard personnel stationed on Kure Atoll prepared for possible hurricane-force winds from the storm. Hurricane Uleki ultimately passed south of Midway Atoll and produced some coastal flooding from increased surf. Some breaking waves spilled onto the runway at Henderson Field.

The book chronicles the author's life in Czechoslovakia and escape from a concentration camp. The book's title refers to the author's mother, Mutti, who while consulting a fortune-teller in Katowice, Poland was told that her child was \\"ein Glückskind\\" – a lucky child – an accurate prophecy in light of future events. Author Buergenthal's father, in response to the prophecy commented that \\"The only thing that fortune-teller knows that we don't know is how to make money in these bad times.\\" (Personal account of the Holocaust)  Background  Thomas Buergenthal was born on May 11, 1934, in Ľubochňa, Czechoslovakia to Jewish parents of German and Polish extraction. Buergenthal was a judge on the International Court of Justice at The Hague and is regarded as a specialist in international and human rights law. A Lucky Child has been translated into more than a dozen languages and features a Foreword by Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel. Ellen Keohane reported that when Thomas Buergenthal first sought an English-language publisher for this book, he was told, \\"Holocaust books don't sell.\\" The book first came out in Germany in 2007 and became a bestseller there. It was finally published in the US in 2009.  The book   Parents  Thomas' father Mundek was born in Galicia (Eastern Europe), a region of Poland that belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the First World War and received his education in German and Polish. He moved to Berlin, where he worked for a private Jewish bank, eventually managing the bank's investment portfolio. However, the rise of Hitler and growing violence against Jews caused Buergenthal senior to leave Germany for Ľubochňa in Czechoslovakia where he owned and managed a resort hotel. There he met Gerda Silbergleit, Thomas' future mother, a 20-year-old German Jewish young woman on vacation from Göttingen. Thomas's parents were engaged within three days of meeting at the German-Czech border and Thomas was born eleven months later.  Early life  In 1938 or early 1939, the Buergenthal's hotel was confiscated by the Hlinka Guard, a Slovak fascist party, and the family eventually moved to Katowice, Poland. At the time, Thomas was five years old. When Germany invaded Poland, the family sought refuge in Kielce, Poland, a city with a large Jewish population (then 25,000). When the ghetto of Kielce was established by order of the Schutzpolizei, the Buergenthals did not have to move since their one-room apartment (they were now nearly destitute) was located in the area which became designated as the ghetto of Kielce. Life in the ghetto was difficult because of both the shortage of food and the increasing paranoia brought on by random German razzias, or raids. There were also informants ready to denounce other ghetto residents to the Germans for any kind of edge for themselves. \\"Yes, the walls have ears\\", Buergenthal senior would often say. Initially in the Kielce Ghetto, Mundek worked as a cook's helper. The irony of his investment banker father working as an assistant cook was lost on the young Thomas. Subsequently, Tommy's father was put in charge of the Werkstatt, or ghetto factory, just outside the ghetto walls. In an early morning in August 1942, when the liquidation of the Kielce ghetto began, Thomas' father bluffed his way out of the ghetto, Werkstatt papers in hand, with his family and a handful of workers in tow, to avoid immediate deportation to the Treblinka extermination camp. This was young Thomas' first brush with death. The surviving residents of the ghetto ended up in the Arbeitslager or work camp, in a small portion of the original ghetto. During the ultimate liquidation of the Arbeitslager, children were torn from their mothers and murdered in gruesome fashion in the Jewish cemetery of Kielce. During the roundup Mundek marched up to the commandant holding little Tommy's hand when young Thomas blurted out \\"Herr Hauptmann, ich kann arbeiten\\" – \\"Captain, I can work\\", and the skeptical commandant replied \\"That we shall soon see\\", and young Thomas was saved from certain death a second time. Thomas' family were now transferred to a large saw mill in Henryków, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, where young Thomas, because of his Polish and German language skills, was hired as an errand boy to the whip wielding city and mill manager, a German named Fuss. In this role nine-year- old Tommy, having advance warning of Fuss' surprise visits, warned mill workers and saved quite a few from severe beatings. Witnessing beatings and hangings of factory workers in Henrykow, Tommy nevertheless witnessed, on the parts of some of the victims acts of bravery and gallantry which gave rise to his growing conviction that, \\"Moral resistance in the face of evil is no less courageous than physical resistance.\\"  Concentration camps  One morning in July 1944, when Thomas was ten years old, his family was deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Incredibly, there was no selection upon arrival at Birkenau because the SS officers in charge assumed that, since this transport came from a work camp, all children, the old and the infirm, that is, those unable to work had been eliminated already. Thus, young Thomas was admitted to Birkenau and eluded immediate death a third time. After arriving in the \\"Gypsy Camp\\" in Auschwitz-Birkenau, Tommy eluded death on numerous occasions with the help of his father. Mundek developed a simple strategy to beat the system by having Tommy stand near the back and very close to the entrance to the barracks at the obligatory \\"Appell\\", or roll call, but melting away and hiding in the barracks when it appeared that Appell would be followed by a Selection, where each Muselmann and child was a target for the gas chambers. Nevertheless, on one occasion, young Tommy was snared in a special selection for the gas chambers. However, this particular group was relatively small and Tommy and the other prisoners selected were transferred to a staging barracks (where inmates with scabies were also quarantined) while a sizeable group was built up over several weeks which could be gassed more efficiently. During this period the young Polish doctor responsible for the quarantine barracks tore up Tommy's card (marked with a red X) and issued a new unmarked card. When the SS came early one morning to drag Tommy's group to the gas chambers, Tommy was not among them. Incredibly, he slept through the entire incident (thinking it was a nightmare) and successfully cheated death once again. In early January 1945, Auschwitz-Birkenau was evacuated in what became known as the Auschwitz Death March. Relatively early in the march the SS guards decided that children were slowing down the process and called the children out from among thousands of marchers \\"to rest in a convent\\". Tommy and his young friends refused to comply and thus eluded death once again. The marchers were now loaded into open freight cars and after more than ten days reached Germany, where Tommy eventually wound up with frozen feet in the infirmary at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where two of his toes were amputated. Sachsenhausen was liberated by the Russian army on April 22, 1945, and Tommy was saved. After liberation Eleven-year-old Tommy saw the fall of Berlin dressed in a custom made uniform as the unofficial ward of a Company of the Polish Army. After the Surrender of Germany he lived in a Polish orphanage until he was reunited with his mother, who also survived, in Göttingen. Tommy immigrated to the US, arriving in New York City on December 4, 1951. He graduated from Bethany College (West Virginia), and New York University School of Law. He earned Master of Law and Doctor of Juridical Science degrees from Harvard University. Thomas Buergenthal dedicated himself to international law, concluding that he had a moral obligation to devote his professional life to the protection of human rights.  Analysis  In his New York Times article \\"The Science of Evil\\", Simon Baron-Cohen cites a scene from A Lucky Child. In the book an inmate was forced to hang his friend who had tried to escape. An SS guard ordered the inmate to put a noose around his friend's neck. Baron- Cohen points out that the guard's behavior was not meant merely to punish or deter. The guard chose this particular form of punishment because he wanted the two friends to suffer. In fact, \\"cruelty for its own sake was a part of ordinary Nazi guards' behavior. Sadly, there is no shortage of horrific examples…\\" In the hanging scene above the man ordered to hang his friend could not comply because his hands were shaking so violently from fear and distress. His friend took the noose, and, in a remarkable act, kissed his friend's hand and then put the noose around his own neck. Young Thomas, then nine years old, witnessed this act of chivalry and similar selfless acts by prisoners of the Kielce ghetto, the Henryków Werkstatt and the Auschwitz and Sachsenhausen concentration camps. Tommy derived strength from such gallant and selfless acts in the face of adversity and these experiences were, in fact, the genesis of his lifelong commitment to human rights. By contrast, empathy or acts of compassion by Nazi concentration camp guards towards prisoners, especially Jews, were rare, but they did occur. For example, an SS guard on a prisoner transport wordlessly handed young Tommy his cup of coffee when he saw Tommy longingly gazing at it. Buergenthal notes that although there were many committed Nazis, there was also the 'Mitlaufer' or 'fellow traveler' who joined the Nazi party for other reasons, such as economic gain. Young Thomas' journey from the ghetto of Kielce to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp is nothing short of amazing. Due to the five decades that elapsed between the incidents detailed and the writing of the book, the author describes the most wrenching scenes with a detachment that makes the account less traumatic for the reader. The author poses questions about human character which are profound and may have no clear answers. Elizabeth McCracken, author of \\"An Exact Replica of a Figment of My Imagination\\" referred to A Lucky Child as \\"an extraordinary story... Heartbreaking and thrilling, it examines what it means to be human, in every good and awful sense.\\"  Quotes from A Lucky Child  \\"Moral resistance in the face of evil is no less courageous than physical resistance.\\" \\"...why, in the midst of all these terrible events, some people find the strength and moral courage to oppose, or at the very least, not commit these monstrous crimes that others perpetrate with ease.\\" \\"Besides testing the morality of those who became neither informers or Kapos, the concentration camps were laboratories for the survival of the brutish.\\" \\"What is in the human character that gives some individuals moral strength not to sacrifice their decency and dignity, regardless of the costs to themselves, whereas others become murderously ruthless in the hope of ensuring their own survival?\\"  References   External links  * ICJ Biography of Thomas Buergenthal  Further reading  * Night (Hill and Wang 1958; 2006) (Personal account of the Holocaust) * * Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:Personal accounts of the Holocaust ","title":"A Lucky Child"},{"id":"34041174","text":"Edward William Mulcahy (June 15, 1921 – March 12, 2006) was an American diplomat and captain in the United States Marine Corps. He was the United States Ambassador to Chad from 1972 to 1974 and to Tunisia from 1976 to 1979. Biography  Early life and military career, 1921–1946  Edward Mulcahy was born in Malden, Massachusetts on June 15, 1921. His parents were John and Mary Alice (Duffy) Mulcahy. He was the eldest of seven children. He graduated from Malden Catholic High School in 1939. Mulcahy graduated from Tufts University with a degree in history in 1943. He later joined the United States Marine Corps in January 1943, where in 1944 he led a company of the 21st Marines of the 3rd Marine Division during the Second Battle of Guam, as a Second Lieutenant. He was promoted to First Lieutenant in February 1945 and fought at the Battle of Iwo Jima. By the end of the war, Mulcahy had received the Silver Star award for his actions in Guam and two Purple Hearts. He was promoted to Captain in 1946 and was in charge of the Marine detachment at the U.S. Navy brig on Governor's Island in New York City, New York. He left the Marine Corps in 1946.  Career in State Department, 1947–1980  In 1946, Mulcahy attended the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Medford, Massachusetts, and received a master's degree from there in 1947. He joined the U.S. Foreign Service upon graduation. In Mulcahy's early years of service, he was a Consular Officer in Munich, Germany (1947 to 1949), U.S. Consul in Mombasa, Kenya (1949), and Political Officer to the U.S. Consulate in Asmara, Eritrea (1950–1953). In 1953 in Globe, Arizona, Mulcahy married Kathleen Lyon, a Foreign Service secretary, whom he had met in 1951 at the U.S. Consulate in Eritrea; her first foreign assignment was in Quito, Ecuador. In 1953, Mulcahy worked on a variety of assignments in the U.S. State Department in Washington, D.C. until he became a Political Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Athens, Greece. In 1959, he was the Deputy Consul General in Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). In 1963 he worked at the Bureau of the Near East and Africa Affairs with responsibility for Southern Africa at the State Department. He was appointed Deputy Chief of Mission at the U.S. Embassy in Tunis, Tunisia, in 1967, and later at the U.S. Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1970. On October 12, 1972, Mulcahy was nominated by President Nixon to be the United States Ambassador to the Republic of Chad. He was confirmed on December 6, 1972, and left that post on June 23, 1974. Later in 1974, Mulcahy became the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs at the State Department. During this time, he worked very closely with then Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, during the Angolan Civil War. On March 4, 1976, Mulcahy was nominated to be the United States Ambassador to Tunisia, this time by President Ford. He was confirmed on May 31, 1976, and served until January 5, 1979. He retired from the Foreign Service in 1980, with 33 years of governmental service, after spending a year as a Diplomat-in-Residence at the Atlanta University (now part of Clark Atlanta University), lecturing about U.S. foreign policy in Africa, and setting up the curriculum for a graduate program in foreign relations.  Retirement and later life, 1980–2006  Upon retiring from the Foreign Service, Mulcahy went to work for Project HOPE, headquartered at Carter Hall in Millwood, Virginia (Clark Co.) as the Director of Operations, under the Executive Director/CEO and Founder of Project HOPE, Dr. William B. Walsh, MD. He stepped down from that position after only two years. Mulcahy lived in Winchester, Virginia, with his wife, for the remainder of his life and remained active in guest lecturing occasionally at the local community college, in his parish, in the Ancient Order of Hibernians, and in Marine Corps activities and reunions, such as the annual \\"Toys for Tots\\" campaign. He was an excellent linguist, and spoke German, French, Italian, Latin, Swahili and Greek as foreign languages. During his retirement years, he also taught himself modern Irish In 1997 Mulcahy was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and in September 2000, he and his wife took up residence at the Westminster-Canterbury in Winchester, Virginia, where they remained until the end of their lives. His wife, Kathleen, died on February 23, 2005. On March 12, 2006, Mulcahy died of natural causes at the age of 84, and his Funeral Mass was held on Friday, March 17, 2006, St Patrick's Day, a fitting date for a man who took great pride in his Irish heritage. His Funeral Mass was celebrated by his youngest child, Fr. Brian M. Mulcahy, O.P. He was buried on April 4, 2006, at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors, provided by the United States Marine Corps. He was survived by three brothers, two sisters, five children, and nine grandchildren. His last surviving sibling, his youngest sister, Elizabeth (Betty) Mulcahy McKeon, was buried on June 24, 2020, in Nashua, NH..
