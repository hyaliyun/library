At the age of 19, in 1901, he went to the oil fields of South Texas and joined a drilling outfit operating at Spindle Top near Beaumont. For foue worked for Bob Allison of Shreveport, Louisiana before setting up on his own account in Monroe, Louisiana in 1917. With no capital, the Stovall Drilling Company was fragile at first, but he developed it into one of the largest drilling contractors in the Southwest USA. He owned and operated the J.M. Supply Company (a machine shop with extensive repair facilities), and the Tiger Factory and Machine Works of Monroe. He also co-founded Commercial Transportation, Inc. to operate a fleet of tugs and barges on the Ouachita River. He was assisted in his businesses by two of his three brothers. On October 21, 1907 he married Fay Wherry (March 10, 1885-June 19, 1966) of Rusk, Texas with whom he had two sons, Earl and J C. Both sons joined their father in his business ventures. In the late 1920s, Stovall built a recreation complex for the Monroe black people because he felt it appropriate to offer free facilities to the people who helped him earn his living. The complex included a basepall park, a swimming pool and a dance pavilion.Peterson, Robert W.

Under the law of England and Wales and other common law jurisdictions, it originally consisted of the intentional and wanton removal of a body part that would handicap a person's ability to defend themselves in combat. Under the strict common law definition, initially this required damage to an eye or a limb, while cutting off an ear or a nose was deemed not sufficiently disabling. Later the meaning of the crime expanded to encompass any mutilation, disfigurement, or crippling act done using any instrument. England=History of definitions= In England and Wales, it has fallen into disuse. In 1992 the Law Commission recommended that it be abolished,The Law Commission, Consultation Paper No.122, Offences Against the Person and General Principles, Appendix A, Draft Criminal Law Bill, clause 31(1)(a)(iii) at page 90 of the report and in 1998 the Home Office proposed to abolish it, in the course of codifying the law relating to offences against the person.The Home Office. 1998. Violence: Reforming the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. Draft Offences Against the Person Bill, clause 23 =Fetter v. Beale= The most significant change in common-law mayhem doctrine came in 1697, when the King's Bench decided Fetter v. Beale, 91 Eng. Rep. 1122. There, the plaintiff recovered in a battery action against a defendant. Shortly thereafter, \\"part of his skull by reason of the said battery came out of his head\\", and the plaintiff brought a subsequent action under mayhem. Though Fetter is also known as an early example of res judicata, it is most significant for expanding the ambit of mayhem to include \\"loss of the skull\\". Modern doctrine In modern times, the offense of mayhem has been superseded in many jurisdictions by statutory offenses such as: *aggravated battery *grevious bodily harm United States Modern statutes in the U.S. define mayhem as disabling or disfiguring, such as rendering useless a member of another person's arms or legs.E.g. Cal. Pen. Code Sec. 203 The injury must be permanent, not just a temporary loss. Some courts will hold even a minor battery as mayhem if the injury is not minor. Mayhem in the U.S. is a felony in all states and jurisdictions, including federal. In the states of California, Vermont and Oklahoma, mayhem is punishable by up to life imprisonment. In other states where laws defining mayhem (or maiming) are in place, the maximum punishment for mayhem is generally around 10 to 20 years, and mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment may also apply, depending on the laws of the state. If mayhem was committed in an aggravated fashion, such as in the case of where it resulted in permanent disability or disfigurement, the punishment is generally much more severe, and may even include life imprisonment. For example, simple mayhem in California is punishable by two to eight years in prison, whereas aggravated mayhem (where permanent injuries result) is punishable by up to life imprisonment. Etymology Both the noun \\"mayhem\\" and the verb \\"maim\\" come from Old French via Anglo-Norman. The word is first attested in various Romance languages in the 13th century, but its ultimate origin is unclear.Oxford English Dictionary, Third edition, June 2000; online version June 2011 For one hypothesis about its origin, see the Wiktionary entry for this word. Etymology of other meaning The term \\"wreaker of mayhem\\" was, accurately, early used for a person going on a rampage (onslaught) in the glorified setting of a just war. After early such sagas the term abounded for centuries in journalese such as reporting \\"rioting and mayhem\\" which readers came to read and repeat as meaning havoc, chaos or pandemonium.

Rachsig (1927) and later adapted by Zawadzki (1948, 1950) to proceed via formation on imide (NH). In this proposal formation of nitroxyl and hydrazine (N2H4) is involved:Sobczyk (2003), p. 6. : NH3 \\\\+ O(a) ‚Üí NH(a) \\\\+ H2O : NH(a) \\\\+ O(a) ‚Üí HNO(a) \\\\+ * : NH(a) \\\\+ NH3 ‚Üí N2H4(a) : HNO(a) \\\\+ NH3 ‚Üí N2H4(a) \\\\+ ¬ΩO2 : N2H4(a) \\\\+ O2 ‚Üí N2 \\\\+ 2H2O + * Later, Y. M. Fogel (1964) disproved the Zawadzki theory that NH is formed via the oxidation of ammonia. In his proposal, NO is an important intermediate of the reaction. The formation of N2O is not detected, therefore the mechanism does not involve its production.

Hence, the games were known as the East-West All-Star Games. Votes were tallied by two of the major African-American weekly newspapers of the day, the Chicago Defender and the Pittsburgh Courier.

The injury is named after Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin (2 April 179013 May 1847), a French surgeon and gynecologist who noticed this fracture pattern amongst cavalry men, in 1815, after the War of the Sixth Coalition. Causes Lisfranc ligaments: C1 = Medial cuneiform M2 = 2nd metatarsal base M3 = 3rd metatarsal base Red = dorsal Lisfranc ligament Blue = interosseous Lisfranc ligament Green = plantar Lisfranc ligament. The midfoot consists of five bones that form the arches of the foot (the cuboid, navicular, and three cuneiform bones) and their articulations with the bases of the five metatarsal bones, and these articulations are damaged in a Lisfranc injury. Such injuries typically involve the ligaments between the medial cuneiform bone and the bases of the second and third metatarsal bones, and each of these ligaments is called Lisfranc ligament. Lisfranc injuries are caused when excessive kinetic energy is applied either directly or indirectly to the midfoot and are often seen in traffic collisions or industrial accidents. Direct Lisfranc injuries are usually caused by a crush injury, such as a heavy object falling onto the midfoot, or the foot being run over by a car or truck, or someone landing on the foot after a fall from a significant height. Indirect Lisfranc injuries are caused by a sudden rotational force on a plantar flexed (downward pointing) forefoot. Examples of this type of trauma include a rider falling from a horse but the foot remaining trapped in the stirrup, or a person falling forward after stepping into a storm drain. In athletic trauma, Lisfranc injuries occur commonly in activities such as windsurfing, kitesurfing, wakeboarding, or snowboarding (where appliance bindings pass directly over the metatarsals). American football players occasionally acquire this injury, and it most often occurs when the athlete's foot is plantar flexed and another player lands on the heel. This can also be seen in pivoting athletic positions such as a baseball catcher or a ballerina spinning. Diagnosis fractures of the distal second (marked by the arrow), third, and fourth metatarsal bones. In a high energy injury to the midfoot, such as a fall from a height or a motor vehicle accident, the diagnosis of a Lisfranc injury should, in theory at least, pose less of a challenge. There will be deformity of the midfoot and X-ray abnormalities should be obvious. Further, the nature of the injury will create heightened clinical suspicion and there may even be disruption of the overlying skin and compromise of the blood supply. Typical X-ray findings would include a gap between the base of the first and second toes. The diagnosis becomes more challenging in the case of low energy incidents, such as might occur with a twisting injury on the racquetball court, or when an American Football lineman is forced back upon a foot that is already in a fully plantar flexed position. Then, there may only be complaint of inability to bear weight and some mild swelling of the forefoot or midfoot. Bruising of the arch has been described as diagnostic in these circumstances but may well be absent. Typically, conventional radiography of the foot is utilized with standard non-weight bearing views, supplemented by weight bearing views which may demonstrate widening of the interval between the first and second toes, if the initial views fail to show abnormality. Unfortunately, radiographs in such circumstances have a sensitivity of 50% when non-weight bearing and 85% when weight bearing, meaning that they will appear normal in 15% of cases where a Lisfranc injury actually exists. In the case of apparently normal x-rays, if clinical suspicion remains, advanced imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or X-ray computed tomography (CT) is a logical next step. =Classification= There are three classifications for the fracture: # Homolateral: All five metatarsals are displaced in the same direction. Lateral displacement may also suggest cuboidal fracture. # Isolated: one or two metatarsals are displaced from the others. # Divergent: metatarsals are displaced in a sagittal or coronal plane and may also involve the intercuneiform area and include a navicular fracture. Treatment Options include operative or non-operative treatment. One study claims that in athletes, and if the dislocation is less than 2 mm, the fracture can be managed with casting for six weeks. The person's injured limb cannot bear weight during this period. In the majority of cases early anatomical reduction and stable fixation is indicated. A 2005 study suggests that closed reduction and Kirschner wire (K-wire) stabilisation or open reduction and stabilisation - generally using screws to avoid the complication of K-wires and maintain a stable reduction - are the treatments of choice. According to a 1997 study, for severe Lisfranc injuries, open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF) and temporary screw or Kirschner wire fixation is the treatment of choice. The foot cannot be allowed to bear weight for a minimum of six weeks. Partial weight-bearing may then begin, with full weight bearing after an additional several weeks, depending on the specific injury. K-wires are typically removed after six weeks, before weight bearing, while screws are often removed after 12 weeks. When a Lisfranc injury is characterized by significant displacement of the tarsometatarsal joint(s), nonoperative treatment often leads to severe loss of function and long-term disability secondary to chronic pain and sometimes to a planovalgus deformity. In cases with severe pain, loss of function, or progressive deformity that has failed to respond to nonoperative treatment, mid-tarsal and tarsometatarsal arthrodesis (operative fusion of the bones) may be indicated. History During the Napoleonic Wars, Jacques Lisfranc de St. Martin encountered a soldier who suffered from vascular compromise and secondary gangrene of the foot after a fall from a horse. Subsequently, Lisfranc performed an amputation at the level of the tarsometatarsal joints, and that area of the foot has since been eponymously referred to as the \\"Lisfranc joint\\". Although Lisfranc did not describe a specific mechanism of injury or classification scheme, a Lisfranc injury has come to mean a dislocation or fracture-dislocation injury at the tarsometatarsal joints.

The Gay Shame movement has grown to embrace radical expression, counter- cultural ideologies, and avant-garde arts and artists. The movement began in 1998 but had begun to fizzle out by 2013. Throughout its history, Gay Shame has been criticized by its opposition to the mainstream, and for the difficulty in ever fully divorcing the movement from mainstream society.  Background  Gay Shame was created as a protest of (and named in opposition to) the overcommercialization of the gay pride events. Members attack \\"queer assimilation\\" into what they perceive as oppressive societal structures. As such, its members disagree with the legalization of same-sex marriage, stating that:  History  Gay Shame began in 1998 as an annual event in Brooklyn, New York. Held for a number of years at DUMBA, an artists' run collective center, bands such as Three Dollar Bill and Kiki and Herb and speakers such as Eileen Myles, Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore and Penny Arcade appeared at the first event, and the evening was documented by Scott Berry and released as the film Gay Shame '98. Swallow Your Pride was a zine published by the people involved in planning Gay Shame in New York. Three issues were released. The movement later spread to San Francisco, Toronto, and Sweden. LAGAI ‚Äì Queer Insurrection (formerly Lesbians and Gays Against Intervention) put such a protest in context. They wrote that the \\"origins of the LGBTQ movement are revolutionary [‚Ä¶] Now, some of the same people who participated in those fabulous outpourings of anti-establishment rage tripped over each other on the way to City Hall to have their love blessed by Gavin Newsom, successor to Dan White and Dianne Feinstein, darling of the developers, persecutor of the homeless, and cause of Gay Shame getting beaten and busted by the cops on more than one occasion.\\" In 2002, AlterNet published a piece by queer activist Tommi Avicolli Mecca who lived in San Francisco about Gay Shame. What he wrote expressed many of the ideas of Gay Shame: In 2009, according to an article on IndyBay, SF Gay Shame had a protest outside San Francisco's LGBT Center. A press release they put out about the event they wrote: That same year there was an event of London's chapter of Gay Shame, which they had a so-called \\"indoor playground of interactive art and alternative ideas...[which was in a] club [that] shares a similar non-commercial, anti-consumerist angle...[and there were] thirty-five sideshows, 100 performance artists and 3,000 revellers.\\" A book titled Gay Shame was reviewed on Lambda Literary in 2010. The reviewers noted that the book looks at the origins of Gay Shame, the question of gay pride and challenges readers to \\"question and explore the possibility that the modern LGBT rights movement's push for acceptance, assimilation, and‚Äîthey would argue‚Äîpride, results in a loss of something importantly queer as it attempts to eradicate shame...[by] exploring the ways in which pride and shame connected with race, gender and sexuality.\\" In 2011, Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore was interviewed by an online publication called We Who Feel Differently. Carlos Motta, the interviewer asked about how to open up spaces, and in a response, Mattilda described her work with Gay Shame: Gay Shame was also mentioned on Mission Local, the Bay Area Reporter, writer Toshio Meronek on the Huffington Post, a radical magazine titled Slingshot, SF Weekly, Sarah Jaffe on Alternet, in a 7-page article in the Quarterly Journal of Speech and many others. = Fizzling out and the aftermath = The San Francisco Gay Shame became a non-hierarchical direct action and radical queer collective that continued until early 2013 when it petered out. It was also \\"primarily responsible for the protests, mobilizations, and guerrilla tactics that shut down the city of San Francisco in response to the declaration of war on Iraq\\". An interview posted on the Mission Local website noted that the group began organizing in 2001, doing radical direct action with ideas like the \\"Goth Cry-In\\" which they described as a \\"space for basking in our sadness around the current state of LGBT politics and the horrors of the larger world.\\" The group also said that \\"the current state of LGBT politics is a scramble for straight privilege\\" and that \\"things like health care ... should be available to us all ... [but that] a queer identity is about challenging institutions of domination, like marriage and the military, not becoming part of them [because] ... we would be working against traditional institutions and building connections with people that make us feel love, joy, freedom and safety‚Äîwhich in many cases, as we know, is the exact opposite of marriage ... [since] Gay Shame supports gender self-determination in all its manifestations.\\" Their website described themselves as committed to \\"a queer extravaganza that brings direct action to astounding levels of theatricality [that rejects a] commercialized gay identity that denies the intrinsic links between queer struggle and challenging power ... counter[ing] the self-serving 'values' of gay consumerism and ... fighting the rabid assimilationist monster with a devastating mobilization of queer brilliance.\\" Despite this, in 2012, according to writer Toshio Meronek, a criticism of the \\"corporatization of Pride events has officially gone viral ... [and] that Pride actually started as a day of political action called Christopher Street Liberation Day.\\" At one point, after Don't Ask Don't Tell was repealed, Gay Shame put out a flier declaring: \\"No Gays in the Military! We need you on the streets. Keeping the status quo in check and on fire.\\" After the end of the last chapter of Gay Shame, there were some reflections on the movement as a whole. One of the main organizers, Mattilda Bernstein Sycamore of this group told the San Francisco Bay Guardian that: This is similar to what she said in a radio show in late October 2012 called Horizontal Power Hour. In June 2013, an article on White Rose Reader added to this, noting that: \\"Starting in 1998, these ‚ÄúGay Shame‚Äù events promoted counter-cultural ideologies and radical expression...some have picked up on this: a blog popped up recently to demand Gay Shame, started by a 48-year old queer male DJ.\\"The Commercialization of \\"Gay Pride\\" = Re- emergence = In September 2013, Gay Shame SF or San Francisco Gay Shame, re- emerged. Gay Shame SF describes themselves as a 'Virus in the System,\\" declaring a \\"new queer activism...to counter the self-serving \\"values\\" of gay consumerism and the increasingly hypocritical left.\\" Organizationally, Gay Shame SF is consensus based, meaning everyone has to agree on decisions before they proceed and that they will make sure everyone is fully informed on the actions that are going to occur. When any member of the group speaks to the press, they will identify as 'Mary' so no one is seen as a leader, incorrectly identified and so that anonymity can be preserved. Most recently, Gay Shame SF has attracted attention for its prison abolition and anti-gentrification organizing. In 2014, six members of Gay Shame were arrested for protesting a \\"prison-themed\\" pride party hosted by Kink.com. In an open letter co-signed by queer abolition leaders Miss Major and Angela Davis, Gay Shame demanded that Kink.com change the party's theme, and \\"not use themes of arrest and incarceration... in promoting your event.\\" In 2015, a series of \\"anti-tech\\" fliers posted by Gay Shame in the Mission District, San Francisco demanded 'Brogrammers' leave the neighborhood and implied violence. Additionally, other chapters have emerged as well. In around May 2013, Gay Shame San Diego emerged, describing itself on a Facebook page as being \\"created as a protest to the overcommercialization of pride events and opposes queer assimilation.\\" This Facebook page has covered topics ranging from same-sex marriage, Lou Reed, and gay pride. Around the same time, a tumblr of the organization popped up as well repeating the same description on their Facebook page and it has been around ever since. Their tumblr currently has reposted material written by Gay Shame SF, criticized capitalism, and discussed topics such as queer and trans liberation.. = Criticism = Due to the opposition to mainstream LGBTQ culture, some have criticized Gay Shame. Another criticism, from a queer perspective, while praising the group in certain ways, commented: \\"...it is difficult for the group to wholly remove themselves from the overarching structure as their ideology demands... By removing individual names, and by extent, individual identities within the group, Gay Shame conforms to the very commercialization it seeks to fight against.\\"  Academic conference  An academic conference at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor occurred in March, 2003. Supposedly, during that weekend, there was friction between the activists and the academics, growing out of different strategies, and the activists' claim that the academics didn't do enough to acknowledge their power and class privilege, and to share more of that with the activists. A professor from the University of Texas adds to this account, reviewing a book called Gay Shame:  Events  There have also been annual themed events titled \\"Gay Shame and Lesbian Weakness\\" in London, England associated with the club night Duckie run by Simon Casson and Amy Lame. Although documentation about when the first event happened is hard to come by, the event was occurring annually by 1998, if not earlier.UK Gay-lesbian-bisexual Google Group The 2004 event was billed as \\"Now in its 9th great year.\\" The event includes performance art and queer-bash make-overs and is also referred to as The Annual Festival of Homosexual Misery. The 2009 event has been announced as the last. But, since Gay Shame SF has re-emerged, new events are likely to happen as well. = Duckie Gay Shame Themes = *2004 Homosexual Misery. It's a nightclub.

Club career Keita was born in Bamako, playing in his country for AS Real Bamako and Stade Malien. With the former, which he represented in two different spells, he was always crowned Premi√®re Division champion. In 1967, 20-year-old Keita left for France to join AS Saint-√âtienne, where he won three consecutive Ligue 1 titles, including the double in 1968 and 1970. In his last two seasons with Les Verts combined, he scored an astonishing 71 league goals ‚Äì 42 alone in the 1970‚Äì71 campaign ‚Äì but the team failed to win any silverware; in 1970, he was voted African Footballer of the Year. Keita joined fellow league side Olympique de Marseille in the 1972 summer. After the club tried to force him to assume French nationality he opposed, leaving in the ensuing off-season for Valencia CF in Spain. Spanish newspapers were accused of racism when one headline read El Valencia va a por alemanes y vuelve con un negro (\\"Valencia goes out to buy Germans and comes back with a black man\\"), but he was always loved during his spell at the club, netting in his debut with the Che, a 2‚Äì1 La Liga home win against Real Oviedo, and being eventually nicknamed La perla negra de Mal√≠ (The black pearl of Mali); he complained, however, that he was constantly played out of position. In 1976, after three years with Valencia, Keita signed for Sporting Clube de Portugal, where he replaced another legendary goalscorer, H√©ctor Yazalde. In two of his three seasons with the Lisbon side he scored in double digits, winning one domestic cup. He retired at the age of 34, after a couple of years with the New England Tea Men in the United States. International career In 1963, at the age of only 16, Keita was selected to play for Mali.

Safe Speed was a United Kingdom-based pressure group that campaigned against speed cameras, claiming that it did so on the grounds of road safety. History The organisation was started in 2001 by Paul Smith, a former computer electronics engineer, which ran from Smith's home in Scotland. Following Smith's death in 2007 the campaign was taken over by his partner Claire Armstrong. Criticism There have been few formal studies evaluating the claims made by Safe Speed: *George Monbiot has argued that Safe Speed is much more about speed than safety, and is part of a \\"culture of speed\\". *The claim that \\"one third of road deaths are due to speed cameras\\" was disputed by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) and by the National Safety Camera Scheme which cite seatbelt and alcohol laws introduced prior to the 1990s, and recent increased road use and mobile phone use as better explanations for the perceived increase in casualties. Safe Speed's method of extrapolating from two years' data is also disputed. *Which? magazine reported that the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) and the National Safety Camera Liaison (NSCL) cite three studies which do allow for long-term trends, and which confirm the correlation between speed cameras and accident reduction. The magazine also reported that the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) disputes Safe Speed's interpretation of TRL 323. In particular they state that the study was dependent on subjective judgements of primary cause, and that many of the other primary causes listed also implied excessive speed. Other TRL studies (e.g. 421 and 511) have examined the relationship between speed and accidents and suggest a strong association. A study of over 300 roads, encompassing several hundred thousand observations, demonstrated that the higher the average speed of traffic on a given type of road, the more accidents there are. The study also demonstrated that injury accidents rise as average speed increases (if all else remains constant). References Further reading  * DfT's \\"four-year\\" report.

The Yo-Yo's recruited Andy Selway (Bladz) (ex- Sugarsnatch) on drums and guitarist Neil Phillips (B-Movie Heroes) to the band. The Yo-Yo's recorded their first single, \\"Out Of My Mind\\", and then joined The Backyard Babies for a UK tour. Another single was then recorded, \\"Rumble(d)\\". The Yo-Yo's continued to tour the UK and were then signed by the US record label, Sub Pop. On the Sub Pop label, the Yo-Yo's released their debut album, Uppers & Downers on CD and LP in 2000. Despite gaining a cult following as well a favourable coverage from the rock and indie press, they split up due to infighting among members. Neil Phillips went on to play for Danny Frye & The Devildolls, and also return his concentration to his own B-Movie Heroes whilst Andy Selway went on to KMFDM. Neil Phillips released his debut solo album in July 2012 under the name Jackrabbit Parole. The album, It's a Long Way Back to the Drawing Board, was available on Front Room Records. In 2005, the group reformed with a new line- up, that included McCormack and Spencer, along with Rich Jones on guitar. The band recorded a new EP, Given Up Giving Up and toured the UK supporting 3 Colours Red. The EP was initially due for release on Mighty Atom Records, but was put out on Undergroove records at the last minute. Ex-Wildhearts drummer Stidi originally took up drumming duties for the band, but was later replaced with a thumb. The band finally walked out on McCormack halfway through a tour with AntiProduct. However, McCormack completed the tour in defiance, with support band Any Given Day providing a backing band. Tom Spencer is currently fronting the London-based The Loyalties, which includes Rich Jones, Lee Jones. Rich Jones also plays with Bassknives. McCormack is working on his first solo album in South Shields. Neil Phillips continues to play with B-Movie Heroes. On 17 February 2012, the Yo-Yo's reformed for \\"one night only\\" for a show at Camden Barfly to celebrate Danny McCormack's 40th birthday. Initially only one show was scheduled but due to demand, a second later show was also booked for later in the evening. At the end of each set the band was joined on stage by Chris McCormack, Andy Cairns, Ritch Battersby (first set) and Stidi (second set). In addition Ray McVeigh and Carl Bar√¢t appeared for a selection of punk rock songs. The band also performed on the third stage at Download Festival on 9 June 2012. The band made a further appearance on 1 June 2013 at Camden Rocks Festival, curated by Chris McCormack at The Barfly. Chris McCormack was originally planned to take Rich Jones's place who was in the United States with the Ginger Wildheart Band, but Nick Hughes ended up taking second guitar duties, while Si Maxwell performed again with the band on drums. The Yoyos were confirmed for two dates in July 2013 at Camden Barfly, warming up to playing the satellite stage at Sonisphere Festival.

It was unveiled on 18 September 2005, the 65th anniversary of the Battle, by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, in the presence of many of the surviving airmen known collectively as \\"The Few\\", following the Royal Air Force Service of Thanksgiving and Rededication on Battle of Britain Sunday. This service is an annual event, the first of which took place in 1943 at St Paul's Cathedral and since has taken place in Westminster Abbey. The monument was conceived by Bill Bond, founder of the Battle of Britain Historical Society, who was later appointed an MBE for his services to heritage. He was solely responsible for negotiating with the City of Westminster to secure the site of the monument, as well as appointing Donald Insall Associates as architects. He also formed the fundraising committee after raising over ¬£250,000 through an appeal. The budget was ¬£1.74 million which was funded in the main by private donations. Bill Bond appointed Lord Tebbit as chairman of the fundraising committee. The monument utilises a panelled granite structure long which was originally designed as a smoke outlet for underground trains when they were powered by steam engines. A walkway was cut obliquely through the middle of the structure, and is lined with panels of high relief sculpture in bronze depicting scenes from the Battle of Britain. The centrepiece is an approximately life sized sculpture of airmen scrambling for their aircraft during the battle. The outside of the monument is lined with bronze plaques listing 2,936 pilots and aircrew from 14 countries who took part in the battle on the Allied side. In July 2020, Ajax historian Martin Sugarman, lost a campaign to list one of the airmen, whose parents were born in Mandatory Palestine, as being ‚ÄúBritish-Israeli\\" or \\"British Palestinian‚Äù. A member of the London monument team advised that, with nearly 3,000 names on the memorial, there was ‚Äúno prospect of post-unveiling correction‚Äù. The sculptor of the monument is Paul Day. The statue was cast by Morris Singer, which is the oldest established fine art foundry in the world and has cast many prominent statues and sculptures in London and around the world, including the lions and fountains in Trafalgar Square.

Getty Square is the civic center, central business district, and transit hub of the City of Yonkers. A dense and growing residential area, it is located in southern Westchester County, New York. The square is named after prominent 19th-century merchant Robert Getty.  History = European colonization= Philipse Manor Hall in Getty Square, built circa 1682 St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church in the heart of Getty Square, built in 1752 The square is named for Robert Parkhill Getty, a prominent merchant and civic leader in the 1800s. The area was the heart of a Dutch patroonship granted to the first lawyer in the New World, Adriaen van der Donck, who built both saw and grist mills on what was then the Saeck Kill,Thirteenth Annual Report, American Scenic and Historic Preservation Society, 1908, pp. 177-178The stream is clearly labeled the Saeck Kill on the original Visscher map of 1653, revised in 1685 later to become the Nepperhan River and today's Saw Mill. Getty Square's two oldest, still-standing buildings, Philipse Manor Hall (circa 1682) and St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church (built 1752 by Frederick Philipse III), were built in close proximity to the river. The Hudson River, bordering the western waterfront of Getty Square, provided a transportation route to markets beginning in the 1600s. The completion of the Erie Canal in 1825 increased water-borne traffic from upstate New York down the Hudson to Manhattan. =Industrialization= In 1853, Elisha Graves Otis, inventor of the safety elevator, established the Otis Elevator Company on the Hudson River and Vark Street, along the new railroad tracks that ran along the Hudson's banks. As the company grew, a larger facility was built just north of the Saw Mill River, what is now Van der Donck Park. Vast Otis factory buildings covering blocks of land extended north to Ashburton Avenue. Later, three separate railroad companies established lines through Getty Square. The New York and Putnam Railroad built the terminal for its Yonkers Branch line in Getty Square, with the original 1880s headhouse and train shed station in the square later upgraded to an office building and railway platform at 20 South Broadway. (The office building remains, but the railway platform has been replaced by a parking garage.) The New York Central Railroad operated out of the still-in-use Yonkers train station. The Third Avenue Railway trolley company ran multiple streetcar lines through Getty Square, and stored its streetcars (also called trams) in the still-standing Yonkers Trolley Barn on Main Street in Getty Square. Like many downtowns in the northeastern United States, Getty Square suffered gradual and severe de-industrialization and non- automobile infrastructure disinvestment beginning after World War II. The Otis Elevator Company factory, with vast buildings covering much of the Getty Square neighborhood north of what is now Van der Donck Park, closed in 1983. Rail-based transportation also diminished. The closing and quick demolition of the Yonkers Branch of the New York and Putnam Railroad, despite an appeal to the United States Supreme Court, occurred in 1944, and the Third Avenue Railway trolley service finally ended in 1952. The Saw Mill River, once the economic engine of Getty Square, was buried in flumes underground in the 1920s; the pavement above was used mostly for car parking lots at Chicken Island, Mill Street Courtyard, and Larkin Plaza. New York State widened Nepperhan Avenue to create an arterial highway along the eastern side of the neighborhood, demolishing a Carnegie library in the process. The farmers' market at St. John's Church is the oldest in Westchester. = 21st century = The reconstituting of the vacant Otis Elevator Factory campus into the iPark corporate business center spurred an influx of advanced industrial initiatives. Capitalizing on the iPark location connected to the existing rail network, Kawasaki Heavy Industries brought its railcar assembly plant to Getty Square. In 2011, iPark installed the largest solar-panel array in Westchester on its roof to provide low-cost electricity to its manufacturing tenants. In 2011, ContraFect, a biotechnology firm, relocated from Manhattan to Getty Square's iPark,http://www.iparkhudsonny.com/pdf/2-25-11_westfair_online.pdf followed in 2013 by Mindspark Interactive Network. Also in 2013, the YONY initiative to spur increased technology company activity began. The Science Barge In 2007, the Science Barge, an solar- and wind-powered demonstration farm, using hydroponics and aquaculture, docked at its permanent home next to the train station at the mouth of the Saw Mill River. The Science Barge draws thousands of researchers and students in the STEM fields, environmental science, and agriculture to Getty Square from around the world, and has been featured by the news media as far as Brazil, Japan and South Korea. In 2013, Sarah Lawrence College established an academic research center at the existing Beczak Environmental Center. The Saw Mill River, the catalyst for Yonkers' initial economic growth in the 17th century, is again being used as an economic engine. Long buried underground in Getty Square, in 2012, the City of Yonkers and Groundwork Yonkers completed the \\"daylighting\\" of the Saw Mill River and construction of Van der Donck Park around it just east of the Yonkers train station. The park, featuring public amenities and wildlife elements, has become an international showpiece. Van der Donck Park was the first phase of daylighting the river in Getty Square. The second phase, the Mill Street Courtyard project to be constructed in 2014, will daylight another portion of the river in a Getty Square block bounded by Warburton Avenue (west), North Broadway (east), Manor House Lane (north), and Main Street (south). The third daylighting phase, near Chicken Island, does not yet have a start date, although New York State awarded a $1.08 million grant for the project at the end of 2013.  Shopping district  Yonkers City Hall with Washington Park Veterans Memorial in foreground 20 South Broadway in Getty Square, in Yonkers, NY, the former Putnam RR station with historic Philipsburgh Building on right Getty Square is a bustling, multi-ethnic shopping district with very high numbers of shoppers compared with other Westchester downtowns (See Intermodal Transit Hub section below.) With significant cohorts of along with many ethnic groups, businesses benefit from an international customer base, including African-American and Latino customers. Farmers' markets and the CSA operate seasonally: St. John's Episcopal Church holds its market on Thursdays at the church; and Groundwork holds its market on Fridays in Van der Donck Park, across the street from the Yonkers train station. The St. John's Church's market is the oldest farmers market in Westchester. The CSA is operated by Groundwork. At all the markets and the CSA, produce can be purchased using government assistance programs. Retail and business banking thrives in Getty Square. Branches of all the major national banks are present, including: Chase with two branches, Wells Fargo, Citibank, HSBC, and Bank of America. Branches of regional banks and credit unions include: Atlantic Bank & Trust, Hudson Valley Bank,http://www.hudsonvalleybank.com/2575/mirror/loc-getty-square.htm KeyBank, and Municipal Credit Union. Kawasaki Heavy Industries Rolling Stock Company is located in the Central Business District.  Intermodal transit hub  Getty Square's heavy pedestrian foot traffic is bolstered by its role as a key transit hub of Yonkers and Westchester. Bee-Line buses, MTA express buses, Metro-North Railroad, and Amtrak converge in Getty Square, and connections are often little more than a few blocks. Getty Square achieves a Walk Score of 95 out of 100, making it a \\"Walker's Paradise\\" where \\"daily errands do not require a car.\\" Getty Square's WalkScore is the highest of any neighborhood in Westchester, making it one of the best places in the County to be car-free. The combination of walkability and a transit hub has spurred transit-oriented development, with zoning changes to promote less car travel and more walking, cycling, and transit use. = Bus = Bee-Line Bus in Getty Square, heading to the Bronx to connect to the Nereid Avenue New York City Subway station. Many of the bus routes provide direct connections to the New York City Subway. Bee- Line Bus and MTA Express Bus serve Getty Square. Ridership on buses dwarfs that of commuter rail. Annual bus ridership on lines in Getty Square numbers in the millions, with Yonkers being the largest origin and destination for bus trips in the Bee-Line Bus service area of Westchester and the northern Bronx.http://transportation.westchestergov.com/images/stories/Planning/onboard_survey_2011.pdf In addition to the thru-running buses, loop route bus lines circulate through Getty Square and adjoining neighborhoods. The MTA Express Bus lines provide direct transportation to midtown Manhattan. Metro Card and exact change are accepted on buses serving Getty Square. Bus routes in Getty Square may be expanded in the future. As part of the transit plan for the Tappan Zee Bridge Replacement, a proposed express bus route from Spring Valley in Rockland County would have Getty Square as its final destination. = Rail = Metro- North Railroad serves Getty Square. Rail riders use Getty Square's Beaux-Arts Yonkers station to board Hudson Line and Amtrak trains. Metro-North provides trips south to stations in the Bronx and to Harlem‚Äì125th Street, and Grand Central Terminal, and to the north to stations along the Hudson Line as far as Poughkeepsie. Many Metro North commuters connect to the New York City Subway at Marble Hill to Marble Hill ‚Äì 225th Street ( train) to reach destinations on the west side of Manhattan, and Harlem‚Äì125th Street to 125th Street () for Manhattan's east side. Amtrak serves Getty Square. The Yonkers train station is the sole southern Westchester station on the Amtrak Hudson River Line, providing an Inter-city rail link to US and Canadian cities like Albany, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Montreal, and Toronto. =Ride share= Taxi stands sit at the heart of Getty Square along New Main Street, and at the Yonkers Train Station. Taxis are often used by shoppers with large packages. Taxi Stand in Getty Square Car sharing Zipcars are available near the Yonkers Train Station since 2012. =Other= Ferry service ended in 2010 between Yonkers and other points in New York City and the Hudson Valley. Boat docking is permitted at the Yonkers Pier. Bicycles are used frequently in Getty Square, mostly for transportation as opposed to recreation. Many businesses use them for fast local deliveries. Children use them to get around. Warburton Avenue and Riverdale Avenue, which meet in Getty Square, are well-used, Westchester bicycling commuting routes. LimeBike dockless bikeshare began operations in Yonkers in May 2018.https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/westchester/yonkers/2018/05/09/yonkers- bike-share-lime/594039002/ Walking and bicycling trails in Getty Square are still on the drawing board. The Old Croton Aqueduct runs along the northern edge of the Getty Square neighborhood, although two blocks of path are on- street at Ashburton Avenue. The Hudson River Valley Greenway, not yet built in Yonkers, may combine portions of the Hudson River waterfront promenade with the Old Croton Aqueduct Trailway. A concept to turn the former Getty Square branch of the New York and Putnam Railroad into a trail has been proposed. It would connect Getty Square and the waterfront promenade at the Science Barge with Van Cortlandt Park. It would be an urban multi-use path with both on- and off-street portions.http://www.groundworkhv.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/01/11-9-13-westchester-county-business-journal.pdf Notable people Restaurateur Peter X.

He is reported to have taught himself how to play guitar. He fronted other bands, including Moxy, before helping form Loverboy. Reno also sang for the Canadian band Hammersmith in 1976. Life and career While still in school in the early 1970s, Reno joined a cover band called Morning Glory, in which he played the drums and eventually found his way to the cover band Synergy. Later, Reno moved on to a band called Spunk with guitarist Jack Stoltz. After graduating from Penticton Secondary School, Reno moved to Calgary, Alberta, after which he briefly joined the band Moxy for a single album, Under the Lights, released in 1978. It was something of a departure from the previous Moxy albums, partially because of changes in band members as well as Reno's different singing style, and did not sell as well as the band's earlier releases.Under the Lights Eventually, Reno was introduced to Paul Dean in 1979 at a nightclub called The Refinery and they immediately got together for a jam session, which led to the formation of Loverboy shortly thereafter. Loverboy released its first album in 1980 and the band went on to tour extensively as well as release three more multi-platinum albums between 1981 and 1985. Loverboy's last full album of original material in the 1980s was Wildside (1987), though they included three new original songs on the compilation album Big Ones (1989). Reno has also contributed to various film soundtracks. In 1984, he performed a duet with Ann Wilson of Heart, \\"Almost Paradise\\", for the movie Footloose. With Loverboy, the band contributed \\"Heaven in Your Eyes\\" for the movie Top Gun (1986). Reno contributed the song \\"Chasing the Angels\\" for the soundtrack to Iron Eagle II (1988) along with the song \\"Whenever There's a Night\\" for the movie Dream a Little Dream (1989). Reno also reportedly recorded a cover of \\"Never Been to Spain\\", a song that was originally written by Hoyt Axton and previously recorded by the band Three Dog Night for their album Harmony (1971). The Three Dog Night version went to #1 on the charts. In 1990 Reno co-wrote and performed the song 'All I Ever Needed' From David Foster Album River of Love. In a 2003 release, artist Tim Feehan released a solo album Tracks I Forgot About containing a song that features Reno on vocals, \\"Call of the Wild\\". Reno's son, Alex, was born on January 23, 1988. In the late 1990s, during a VH1 interview, Reno attributed the decline of Loverboy to the rise of grunge bands such as Pearl Jam and Nirvana. In 2002, Reno released his first solo album titled Renovation. The album is composed of ten tracks closely resembling the sound of his work with Loverboy though some discs contain a bonus track titled \\"Guilty as Charged.\\" The album was reportedly recorded 1992 and was supposed to be released by Sony but they chose instead to indefinitely shelve the project due to changes in the music industry... the changes touched on by Reno in his previously mentioned VH1 interview. Reno eventually proceeded to release the un-mastered recordings from his own archival tapes on his now defunct website but went on to release the album widely on a variety of sources. The main complaint amongst critics and fans is a lack of mastering, overall production and polishing commonly found on finished albums... but hard core fans and critics seem to feel the album is more than worthy of attention in spite of this.http://www.melodicrock.com/reviews/mikereno-renovation.p3 Loverboy had a headlining spot at the 2007 Grey Cup party in Toronto.http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Loverboy/2007/11/21/4672583.html At the 2009 Juno Awards, Reno was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame as a member of Loverboy. Loverboy also played as a part of the 2010 Olympic ceremonies in Vancouver on Sunday February 21, 2010. This night, otherwise known as \\"Nunavut night\\", was co-headlined with the band Trooper. The live medal presentations were in short track speed skating (ladies' 1,500 m and men's 1,000 m), men's 1,500-metre speed skating and men's freestyle skiing ski cross. The band's latest full album of all-new material is Unfinished Business, released on July 15, 2014, through Loverboy Music. As of 2015, Reno continues to tour and play live shows with Loverboy.

Inner vocal sacs are present at the throat and webbings are well developed at the hind feet. The pupils are heart- shaped. The body colour is grey, brown or green with dark spots on the upper side and blackish with larger orange or red and smaller white spots on the underside. The skin produces a poison to protect itself from bacteria and fungi or the animal from vertebrates. This poison is irritating to mucous membranes. The eggs are brown above and lighter below. They are 1.4-1.8 mm large coated with a transparent jelly of 5‚Äì8 mm in diameter. Tadpoles may reach a length of 55 mm and are brownish above with two longitudinal pale bands along the backbone. The mouth field is triangular and the flipper is reticulated. When they shed their skin, they bloat themselves and make a coughing sound, then start to tear the old skin off with their mouth, and eat it for nutrition, to reveal newer, brighter skin. Diet The food of the European fire-bellied toad consists of insects, spiders, millipedes, mollusks and earthworms captured in or nearby the water. The tadpoles mainly feed on algae, bacteria and plankton by grazing the surfaces of stones and plants. If attacked by a vertebrate on land the European fire-bellied toad makes a hollow-back and lifts its four legs so that the ventral warning colour is displayed. The combination of dark and red is a learned signal meaning ‚Äúattention poison‚Äù to the enemy. Reproduction Reproduction takes place from April to July/August and is induced by heavy rainfall. Then, males can be recognized by some darkened, spiny swelling, the nuptial pad, on their forelegs. They help it to grasp the female properly around its hip. Males defend small territories of 2‚Äì3 m in diameter against rivals. Spawn consists of small clutches of 10‚Äì40 eggs which are attached to plants. Several such clutches are produced in a short time and thereby a female may lay a total of 80‚Äì300 eggs. Tadpoles hatch after 2‚Äì5 days and metamorphose after 5‚Äì12 weeks from July to September or after hibernation in spring. Young toads are 11‚Äì15 mm long and remain at the water's edge. Maturity is reached at an age of 1‚Äì2 years. The European fire-bellied toad may live more than 10 years. The rather loud melodic call is repeated about 10‚Äì50 times per minute, correlating with temperature, and is performed in the afternoon at temperatures of 12‚Äì34 ¬∞C while drifting at the water surface. The sound is produced when the air is pressed from the vocal sac back to the lungs which is the opposite to what ‚Äúhigher‚Äù frogs do. It hibernates on land in frost-resisting dens like hollows under stones or dead wood.

Lorentz's initial theory was created between 1892 and 1895 and was based on a completely motionless aether. It explained the failure of the negative aether drift experiments to first order in v/c by introducing an auxiliary variable called \\"local time\\" for connecting systems at rest and in motion in the aether. In addition, the negative result of the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment led to the introduction of the hypothesis of length contraction in 1892. However, other experiments also produced negative results and (guided by Henri Poincar√©'s principle of relativity) Lorentz tried in 1899 and 1904 to expand his theory to all orders in v/c by introducing the Lorentz transformation. In addition, he assumed that also non-electromagnetic forces (if they exist) transform like electric forces. However, Lorentz's expression for charge density and current were incorrect, so his theory did not fully exclude the possibility of detecting the aether. Eventually, it was Henri Poincar√© who in 1905 corrected the errors in Lorentz's paper and actually incorporated non-electromagnetic forces (including gravitation) within the theory, which he called \\"The New Mechanics\\". Many aspects of Lorentz's theory were incorporated into special relativity (SR) with the works of Albert Einstein and Hermann Minkowski. Today LET is often treated as some sort of \\"Lorentzian\\" or \\"neo-Lorentzian\\" interpretation of special relativity. The introduction of length contraction and time dilation for all phenomena in a \\"preferred\\" frame of reference, which plays the role of Lorentz's immobile aether, leads to the complete Lorentz transformation (see the Robertson‚ÄìMansouri‚ÄìSexl test theory as an example). Because the same mathematical formalism occurs in both, it is not possible to distinguish between LET and SR by experiment. However, in LET the existence of an undetectable aether is assumed and the validity of the relativity principle seems to be only coincidental, which is one reason why SR is commonly preferred over LET.  Historical development = Basic concept = Hendrik Antoon Lorentz This theory, which was developed mainly between 1892 and 1906 by Lorentz and Poincar√©, was based on the aether theory of Augustin-Jean Fresnel, Maxwell's equations and the electron theory of Rudolf Clausius.Whittaker (1951), 386ff Lorentz introduced a strict separation between matter (electrons) and aether, whereby in his model the aether is completely motionless, and it won't be set in motion in the neighborhood of ponderable matter. As Max Born later said, it was natural (though not logically necessary) for scientists of that time to identify the rest frame of the Lorentz aether with the absolute space of Isaac Newton.Born (1964), 172ff The condition of this aether can be described by the electric field E and the magnetic field H, where these fields represent the \\"states\\" of the aether (with no further specification), related to the charges of the electrons. Thus an abstract electromagnetic aether replaces the older mechanistic aether models. Contrary to Clausius, who accepted that the electrons operate by actions at a distance, the electromagnetic field of the aether appears as a mediator between the electrons, and changes in this field can propagate not faster than the speed of light. Lorentz theoretically explained the Zeeman effect on the basis of his theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1902. Joseph Larmor found a similar theory simultaneously, but his concept was based on a mechanical aether. A fundamental concept of Lorentz's theory in 1895Lorentz (1895) was the \\"theorem of corresponding states\\" for terms of order v/c. This theorem states that a moving observer with respect to the aether can use the same electrodynamic equations as an observer in the stationary aether system, thus they are making the same observations. = Length contraction = A big challenge for this theory was the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment in 1887. According to the theories of Fresnel and Lorentz a relative motion to an immobile aether had to be determined by this experiment; however, the result was negative. Michelson himself thought that the result confirmed the aether drag hypothesis, in which the aether is fully dragged by matter. However, other experiments like the Fizeau experiment and the effect of aberration disproved that model. A possible solution came in sight, when in 1889 Oliver Heaviside derived from Maxwell's equations that the magnetic vector potential field around a moving body is altered by a factor of \\\\sqrt{1- v^2 / c^2}. Based on that result, and to bring the hypothesis of an immobile aether into accordance with the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, George FitzGerald in 1889 (qualitatively) and, independently of him, Lorentz in 1892Lorentz (1892) (already quantitatively), suggested that not only the electrostatic fields, but also the molecular forces, are affected in such a way that the dimension of a body in the line of motion is less by the value v^2/(2c^2) than the dimension perpendicularly to the line of motion. However, an observer co-moving with the earth would not notice this contraction because all other instruments contract at the same ratio. In 1895 Lorentz proposed three possible explanations for this relative contraction:Brown (2001) * The body contracts in the line of motion and preserves its dimension perpendicularly to it. * The dimension of the body remains the same in the line of motion, but it expands perpendicularly to it. * The body contracts in the line of motion and expands at the same time perpendicularly to it. Although the possible connection between electrostatic and intermolecular forces was used by Lorentz as a plausibility argument, the contraction hypothesis was soon considered as purely ad hoc. It is also important that this contraction would only affect the space between the electrons but not the electrons themselves; therefore the name \\"intermolecular hypothesis\\" was sometimes used for this effect. The so-called Length contraction without expansion perpendicularly to the line of motion and by the precise value l=l_0 \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{1- v^2 / c^2} (where l0 is the length at rest in the aether) was given by Larmor in 1897 and by Lorentz in 1904. In the same year, Lorentz also argued that electrons themselves are also affected by this contraction.Miller (1981), 70‚Äì75, For further development of this concept, see the section #Lorentz transformation.Lorentz (1904b) = Local time = An important part of the theorem of corresponding states in 1892 and 1895 was the local time t'=t - vx / c^2, where t is the time coordinate for an observer resting in the aether, and t' is the time coordinate for an observer moving in the aether. (Woldemar Voigt had previously used the same expression for local time in 1887 in connection with the Doppler effect and an incompressible medium.) With the help of this concept Lorentz could explain the aberration of light, the Doppler effect and the Fizeau experiment (i.e. measurements of the Fresnel drag coefficient) by Hippolyte Fizeau in moving and also resting liquids. While for Lorentz length contraction was a real physical effect, he considered the time transformation only as a heuristic working hypothesis and a mathematical stipulation to simplify the calculation from the resting to a \\"fictitious\\" moving system. Contrary to Lorentz, Poincar√© saw more than a mathematical trick in the definition of local time, which he called Lorentz's \\"most ingenious idea\\".Poincar√© (1904); Poincar√© (1905a), Ch. 8 In The Measure of Time he wrote in 1898:Poincar√© (1898); Poincar√© (1905a), Ch. 2 In 1900 Poincar√© interpreted local time as the result of a synchronization procedure based on light signals. He assumed that two observers, A and B, who are moving in the aether, synchronize their clocks by optical signals. Since they treat themselves as being at rest, they must consider only the transmission time of the signals and then crossing their observations to examine whether their clocks are synchronous. However, from the point of view of an observer at rest in the aether the clocks are not synchronous and indicate the local time t'=t - vx / c^2. But because the moving observers don't know anything about their movement, they don't recognize this.Poincar√© (1900b) In 1904, he illustrated the same procedure in the following way: A sends a signal at time 0 to B, which arrives at time t. B also sends a signal at time 0 to A, which arrives at time t. If in both cases t has the same value, the clocks are synchronous, but only in the system in which the clocks are at rest in the aether. So, according to Darrigol,Darrigol (2005), 10‚Äì11 Poincar√© understood local time as a physical effect just like length contraction ‚Äì in contrast to Lorentz, who used the same interpretation not before 1906. However, contrary to Einstein, who later used a similar synchronization procedure which was called Einstein synchronisation, Darrigol says that Poincar√© had the opinion that clocks resting in the aether are showing the true time. However, at the beginning it was unknown that local time includes what is now known as time dilation. This effect was first noticed by Larmor (1897), who wrote that \\"individual electrons describe corresponding parts of their orbits in times shorter for the [aether] system in the ratio \\\\varepsilon^{-1/2} or (1-(1/2)v^2/c^2)\\". And in 1899Lorentz (1899) also Lorentz noted for the frequency of oscillating electrons \\"that in S the time of vibrations be k\\\\varepsilon times as great as in S0\\", where S0 is the aether frame, S the mathematical-fictitious frame of the moving observer, k is \\\\sqrt{1- v^2 / c^2}, and \\\\varepsilon is an undetermined factor. Janssen (1995), Chap. 3.5.4 = Lorentz transformation = While local time could explain the negative aether drift experiments to first order to v/c, it was necessary ‚Äì due to other unsuccessful aether drift experiments like the Trouton‚ÄìNoble experiment ‚Äì to modify the hypothesis to include second-order effects. The mathematical tool for that is the so-called Lorentz transformation. Voigt in 1887 had already derived a similar set of equations (although with a different scale factor). Afterwards, Larmor in 1897 and Lorentz in 1899 derived equations in a form algebraically equivalent to those which are used up to this day, although Lorentz used an undetermined factor l in his transformation. In his paper Electromagnetic phenomena in a system moving with any velocity smaller than that of light (1904) Lorentz attempted to create such a theory, according to which all forces between the molecules are affected by the Lorentz transformation (in which Lorentz set the factor l to unity) in the same manner as electrostatic forces. In other words, Lorentz attempted to create a theory in which the relative motion of earth and aether is (nearly or fully) undetectable. Therefore, he generalized the contraction hypothesis and argued that not only the forces between the electrons, but also the electrons themselves are contracted in the line of motion. However, Max Abraham (1904) quickly noted a defect of that theory: Within a purely electromagnetic theory the contracted electron-configuration is unstable and one has to introduce non-electromagnetic force to stabilize the electrons ‚Äì Abraham himself questioned the possibility of including such forces within the theory of Lorentz. So it was Poincar√© who, on 5 June 1905,Poincar√© (1905b) who introduced the so-called \\"Poincar√© stresses\\" to solve that problem. Those stresses were interpreted by him as an external, non-electromagnetic pressure, which stabilize the electrons and also served as an explanation for length contraction.Janssen/Mecklenburg (2007) Although he argued that Lorentz succeeded in creating a theory which complies to the postulate of relativity, he showed that Lorentz's equations of electrodynamics were not fully Lorentz covariant. So by pointing out the group characteristics of the transformation, Poincar√© demonstrated the Lorentz covariance of the Maxwell‚ÄìLorentz equations and corrected Lorentz's transformation formulae for charge density and current density. He went on to sketch a model of gravitation (incl. gravitational waves) which might be compatible with the transformations. It was Poincar√© who, for the first time, used the term \\"Lorentz transformation\\", and he gave them a form which is used up to this day. (Where \\\\ell is an arbitrary function of \\\\varepsilon, which must be set to unity to conserve the group characteristics. He also set the speed of light to unity.) :x^\\\\prime = k\\\\ell\\\\left(x + \\\\varepsilon t\\\\right), \\\\qquad y^\\\\prime = \\\\ell y, \\\\qquad z^\\\\prime = \\\\ell z, \\\\qquad t^\\\\prime = k\\\\ell\\\\left(t + \\\\varepsilon x\\\\right) :k = \\\\frac 1 {\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\varepsilon^2}} A substantially extended work (the so-called \\"Palermo paper\\")Poincar√© (1906) was submitted by Poincar√© on 23 July 1905, but was published in January 1906 because the journal appeared only twice a year. He spoke literally of \\"the postulate of relativity\\", he showed that the transformations are a consequence of the principle of least action; he demonstrated in more detail the group characteristics of the transformation, which he called Lorentz group, and he showed that the combination x^2+ y^2+ z^2- c^2t^2 is invariant. While elaborating his gravitational theory, he noticed that the Lorentz transformation is merely a rotation in four-dimensional space about the origin by introducing ct\\\\sqrt{-1} as a fourth, imaginary, coordinate, and he used an early form of four-vectors. However, Poincar√© later said the translation of physics into the language of four-dimensional geometry would entail too much effort for limited profit, and therefore he refused to work out the consequences of this notion. This was later done, however, by Minkowski; see \\"The shift to relativity\\".Walter (2007), Kap. 1 = Electromagnetic mass = J. J. Thomson (1881) and others noticed, that electromagnetic energy contributes to the mass of charged bodies by the amount m=(4/3)E/c^2, which was called electromagnetic or \\"apparent mass\\". Another derivation of some sort of electromagnetic mass was conducted by Poincar√© (1900). By using the momentum of electromagnetic fields, he concluded that these fields contribute a mass of E_{em}/c^2 to all bodies, which is necessary to save the center of mass theorem. As noted by Thomson and others, this mass increases also with velocity. Thus in 1899, Lorentz calculated that the ratio of the electron's mass in the moving frame and that of the aether frame is k^3 \\\\varepsilon parallel to the direction of motion, and k\\\\varepsilon perpendicular to the direction of motion, where k = \\\\sqrt{1- v^2 / c^2} and \\\\varepsilon is an undetermined factor. And in 1904, he set \\\\varepsilon=1, arriving at the expressions for the masses in different directions (longitudinal and transverse): :m_L=\\\\frac{m_0}{\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\\\\right)^3},\\\\quad m_T=\\\\frac{m_0}{\\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}, where :m_0=\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\frac{E_{em}}{c^2} Many scientists now believed that the entire mass and all forms of forces were electromagnetic in nature. This idea had to be given up, however, in the course of the development of relativistic mechanics. Abraham (1904) argued (as described in the preceding section #Lorentz transformation), that non-electrical binding forces were necessary within Lorentz's electrons model. But Abraham also noted that different results occurred, dependent on whether the em-mass is calculated from the energy or from the momentum. To solve those problems, Poincar√© in 1905 and 1906 introduced some sort of pressure of non-electrical nature, which contributes the amount -(1/3)E/c^2 to the energy of the bodies, and therefore explains the 4/3-factor in the expression for the electromagnetic mass-energy relation. However, while Poincar√©'s expression for the energy of the electrons was correct, he erroneously stated that only the em-energy contributes to the mass of the bodies.Janssen/Mecklenburg (2007) The concept of electromagnetic mass is not considered anymore as the cause of mass per se, because the entire mass (not only the electromagnetic part) is proportional to energy, and can be converted into different forms of energy, which is explained by Einstein's mass‚Äìenergy equivalence.Miller (1981), 359‚Äì360 = Gravitation = Lorentz's theories  In 1900Lorentz (1900) Lorentz tried to explain gravity on the basis of the Maxwell equations. He first considered a Le Sage type model and argued that there possibly exists a universal radiation field, consisting of very penetrating em-radiation, and exerting a uniform pressure on every body. Lorentz showed that an attractive force between charged particles would indeed arise, if it is assumed that the incident energy is entirely absorbed. This was the same fundamental problem which had afflicted the other Le Sage models, because the radiation must vanish somehow and any absorption must lead to an enormous heating. Therefore, Lorentz abandoned this model. In the same paper, he assumed like Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti and Johann Karl Friedrich Z√∂llner that the attraction of opposite charged particles is stronger than the repulsion of equal charged particles. The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. This leads to a conflict with the law of gravitation by Isaac Newton, in which it was shown by Pierre Simon Laplace that a finite speed of gravity leads to some sort of aberration and therefore makes the orbits unstable. However, Lorentz showed that the theory is not concerned by Laplace's critique, because due to the structure of the Maxwell equations only effects in the order v2/c2 arise. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low. He wrote: In 1908Poincar√© (1908a); Poincar√© (1908b) Book 3, Ch. 3 Poincar√© examined the gravitational theory of Lorentz and classified it as compatible with the relativity principle, but (like Lorentz) he criticized the inaccurate indication of the perihelion advance of Mercury. Contrary to Poincar√©, Lorentz in 1914 considered his own theory as incompatible with the relativity principle and rejected it.Lorentz (1914) primary sources  Lorentz-invariant gravitational law  Poincar√© argued in 1904 that a propagation speed of gravity which is greater than c is contradicting the concept of local time and the relativity principle. He wrote: However, in 1905 and 1906 Poincar√© pointed out the possibility of a gravitational theory, in which changes propagate with the speed of light and which is Lorentz covariant. He pointed out that in such a theory the gravitational force not only depends on the masses and their mutual distance, but also on their velocities and their position due to the finite propagation time of interaction. On that occasion Poincar√© introduced four-vectors. Following Poincar√©, also Minkowski (1908) and Arnold Sommerfeld (1910) tried to establish a Lorentz-invariant gravitational law.Walter (2007) However, these attempts were superseded because of Einstein's theory of general relativity, see \\"The shift to relativity\\". The non-existence of a generalization of the Lorentz ether to gravity was a major reason for the preference for the spacetime interpretation. A viable generalization to gravity has been proposed only 2012 by SchmelzerSchmelzer, I. (2012). A generalization of the Lorentz ether to gravity with general-relativistic limit, Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras 22(1) 203-242, also arXiv:gr-gc/0205035. The preferred frame is defined by the harmonic coordinate condition. The gravitational field is defined by density, velocity and stress tensor of the Lorentz ether, so that the harmonic conditions become continuity and Euler equations. The Einstein Equivalence Principle is derived. The Strong Equivalence Principle is violated, but is recovered in a limit, which gives the Einstein equations of general relativity in harmonic coordinates.  Principles and conventions  Henri Poincar√© = Constancy of light = Already in his philosophical writing on time measurements (1898), Poincar√© wrote that astronomers like Ole R√∏mer, in determining the speed of light, simply assume that light has a constant speed, and that this speed is the same in all directions. Without this postulate it would not be possible to infer the speed of light from astronomical observations, as R√∏mer did based on observations of the moons of Jupiter. Poincar√© went on to note that R√∏mer also had to assume that Jupiter's moons obey Newton's laws, including the law of gravitation, whereas it would be possible to reconcile a different speed of light with the same observations if we assumed some different (probably more complicated) laws of motion. According to Poincar√©, this illustrates that we adopt for the speed of light a value that makes the laws of mechanics as simple as possible. (This is an example of Poincar√©'s conventionalist philosophy.) Poincar√© also noted that the propagation speed of light can be (and in practice often is) used to define simultaneity between spatially separate events. However, in that paper he did not go on to discuss the consequences of applying these \\"conventions\\" to multiple relatively moving systems of reference. This next step was done by Poincar√© in 1900, when he recognized that synchronization by light signals in earth's reference frame leads to Lorentz's local time.Galison (2002)Miller (1981), 186‚Äì189 (See the section on \\"local time\\" above). And in 1904 Poincar√© wrote: = Principle of relativity = In 1895Poincar√© (1895)Katzir (2005), 275‚Äì288 Poincar√© argued that experiments like that of Michelson‚ÄìMorley show that it seems to be impossible to detect the absolute motion of matter or the relative motion of matter in relation to the aether. And although most physicists had other views, Poincar√© in 1900Poincar√© (1900a); Poincar√© (1902), Ch. 9‚Äì10 stood to his opinion and alternately used the expressions \\"principle of relative motion\\" and \\"relativity of space\\". He criticized Lorentz by saying, that it would be better to create a more fundamental theory, which explains the absence of any aether drift, than to create one hypothesis after the other. In 1902Poincar√© (1902), Ch. 13 he used for the first time the expression \\"principle of relativity\\". In 1904 he appreciated the work of the mathematicians, who saved what he now called the \\"principle of relativity\\" with the help of hypotheses like local time, but he confessed that this venture was possible only by an accumulation of hypotheses. And he defined the principle in this way (according to MillerMiller (1981), 79 based on Lorentz's theorem of corresponding states): \\"The principle of relativity, according to which the laws of physical phenomena must be the same for a stationary observer as for one carried along in a uniform motion of translation, so that we have no means, and can have none, of determining whether or not we are being carried along in such a motion.\\" Referring to the critique of Poincar√© from 1900, Lorentz wrote in his famous paper in 1904, where he extended his theorem of corresponding states: \\"Surely, the course of inventing special hypotheses for each new experimental result is somewhat artificial. It would be more satisfactory, if it were possible to show, by means of certain fundamental assumptions, and without neglecting terms of one order of magnitude or another, that many electromagnetic actions are entirely independent of the motion of the system.\\" One of the first assessments of Lorentz's paper was by Paul Langevin in May 1905. According to him, this extension of the electron theories of Lorentz and Larmor led to \\"the physical impossibility to demonstrate the translational motion of the earth\\". However, Poincar√© noticed in 1905 that Lorentz's theory of 1904 was not perfectly \\"Lorentz invariant\\" in a few equations such as Lorentz's expression for current density (Lorentz admitted in 1921 that these were defects). As this required just minor modifications of Lorentz's work, also Poincar√© asserted that Lorentz had succeeded in harmonizing his theory with the principle of relativity: \\"It appears that this impossibility of demonstrating the absolute motion of the earth is a general law of nature. [...] Lorentz tried to complete and modify his hypothesis in order to harmonize it with the postulate of complete impossibility of determining absolute motion. It is what he has succeeded in doing in his article entitled Electromagnetic phenomena in a system moving with any velocity smaller than that of light [Lorentz, 1904b].\\"French original: Il semble que cette impossibilit√© de d√©montrer le mouvement absolu soit une loi g√©n√©rale de la nature [..] Lorentz a cherch√© √† compl√©ter et √† modifier son hypoth√®se de fa√ßon √† la mettre en concordance avec le postulate de l'impossibilit√© compl√®te de la d√©termination du mouvement absolu. C'est ce qu'il a r√©ussi dans son article intitul√© Electromagnetic phenomena in a system moving with any velocity smaller than that of light. In his Palermo paper (1906), Poincar√© called this \\"the postulate of relativity‚Äú, and although he stated that it was possible this principle might be disproved at some point (and in fact he mentioned at the paper's end that the discovery of magneto-cathode rays by Paul Ulrich Villard (1904) seems to threaten itWalter (2007), Chap. 1), he believed it was interesting to consider the consequences if we were to assume the postulate of relativity was valid without restriction. This would imply that all forces of nature (not just electromagnetism) must be invariant under the Lorentz transformation. In 1921 Lorentz credited Poincar√© for establishing the principle and postulate of relativity and wrote:Lorentz (1921), pp. 247‚Äì261 \\"I have not established the principle of relativity as rigorously and universally true. Poincar√©, on the other hand, has obtained a perfect invariance of the electro-magnetic equations, and he has formulated 'the postulate of relativity', terms which he was the first to employ.\\"French original: je n'ai pas √©tabli le principe de relativit√© comme rigoureusement et universellement vrai. Poincar√©, au contraire, a obtenu une invariance parfaite des √©quations de l‚Äô√©lectrodynamique, et il a formule le ¬´ postulat de relativit√© ¬ª, termes qu‚Äôil a √©t√© le premier a employer. = Aether = Poincar√© wrote in the sense of his conventionalist philosophy in 1889: Poincar√© (1889); Poincar√© (1902), Ch. 12 \\"Whether the aether exists or not matters little ‚Äì let us leave that to the metaphysicians; what is essential for us is, that everything happens as if it existed, and that this hypothesis is found to be suitable for the explanation of phenomena. After all, have we any other reason for believing in the existence of material objects? That, too, is only a convenient hypothesis; only, it will never cease to be so, while some day, no doubt, the aether will be thrown aside as useless.\\" He also denied the existence of absolute space and time by saying in 1901:Poincar√© (1901a); Poincar√© (1902), Ch. 6 \\"1. There is no absolute space, and we only conceive of relative motion ; and yet in most cases mechanical facts are enunciated as if there is an absolute space to which they can be referred. 2. There is no absolute time. When we say that two periods are equal, the statement has no meaning, and can only acquire a meaning by a convention. 3. Not only have we no direct intuition of the equality of two periods, but we have not even direct intuition of the simultaneity of two events occurring in two different places. I have explained this in an article entitled \\"Mesure du Temps\\" [1898]. 4. Finally, is not our Euclidean geometry in itself only a kind of convention of language?\\" However, Poincar√© himself never abandoned the aether hypothesis and stated in 1900: \\"Does our aether actually exist ? We know the origin of our belief in the aether. If light takes several years to reach us from a distant star, it is no longer on the star, nor is it on the earth. It must be somewhere, and supported, so to speak, by some material agency.\\" And referring to the Fizeau experiment, he even wrote: \\"The aether is all but in our grasp.\\" He also said the aether is necessary to harmonize Lorentz's theory with Newton's third law. Even in 1912 in a paper called \\"The Quantum Theory\\", Poincar√© ten times used the word \\"aether\\", and described light as \\"luminous vibrations of the aether\\".Poincar√© 1912; Poincar√© 1913, Ch. 6 And although he admitted the relative and conventional character of space and time, he believed that the classical convention is more \\"convenient\\" and continued to distinguish between \\"true\\" time in the aether and \\"apparent\\" time in moving systems. Addressing the question if a new convention of space and time is needed he wrote in 1912:Poincar√© (1913), Ch. 2 \\"Shall we be obliged to modify our conclusions? Certainly not; we had adopted a convention because it seemed convenient and we had said that nothing could constrain us to abandon it. Today some physicists want to adopt a new convention. It is not that they are constrained to do so; they consider this new convention more convenient; that is all. And those who are not of this opinion can legitimately retain the old one in order not to disturb their old habits, I believe, just between us, that this is what they shall do for a long time to come.\\" Also Lorentz argued during his lifetime that in all frames of reference this one has to be preferred, in which the aether is at rest. Clocks in this frame are showing the \\"real‚Äú time and simultaneity is not relative. However, if the correctness of the relativity principle is accepted, it is impossible to find this system by experiment.Lorentz (1913), p. 75  The shift to relativity  Albert Einstein = Special relativity = In 1905, Albert Einstein published his paper on what is now called special relativity.Einstein (1905a) In this paper, by examining the fundamental meanings of the space and time coordinates used in physical theories, Einstein showed that the \\"effective\\" coordinates given by the Lorentz transformation were in fact the inertial coordinates of relatively moving frames of reference. From this followed all of the physically observable consequences of LET, along with others, all without the need to postulate an unobservable entity (the aether). Einstein identified two fundamental principles, each founded on experience, from which all of Lorentz's electrodynamics follows: 1\\\\. The laws by which physical processes occur are the same with respect to any system of inertial coordinates (the principle of relativity) 2\\\\. In empty space light propagates at an absolute speed c in any system of inertial coordinates (the principle of the constancy of light) Taken together (along with a few other tacit assumptions such as isotropy and homogeneity of space), these two postulates lead uniquely to the mathematics of special relativity. Lorentz and Poincar√© had also adopted these same principles, as necessary to achieve their final results, but didn't recognize that they were also sufficient, and hence that they obviated all the other assumptions underlying Lorentz's initial derivations (many of which later turned out to be incorrect The three best known examples are (1) the assumption of Maxwell's equations, and (2) the assumptions about finite structure of the electron, and (3) the assumption that all mass was of electromagnetic origin. Maxwell's equations were subsequently found to be invalid and were replaced with quantum electrodynamics, although one particular feature of Maxwell's equations, the invariance of a characteristic speed, has remained. The electron's mass is now regarded as a pointlike particle, and Poincar√© already showed in 1905 that it is not possible for all the mass of the electron to be electromagnetic in origin. This is how relativity invalidated the 19th century hopes for basing all of physics on electromagnetism.). Therefore, special relativity very quickly gained wide acceptance among physicists, and the 19th century concept of a luminiferous aether was no longer considered useful.Darrigol (2005), 15‚Äì18Janssen (1995), Kap. 4 Einstein's 1905 presentation of special relativity was soon supplemented, in 1907, by Hermann Minkowski, who showed that the relations had a very natural interpretationSee Whittaker's History of the Aether, in which he writes, \\"The great advances made by Minkowski were connected with his formulation of physics in terms of a four-dimensional manifold... in order to represent natural phenomena without introducing contingent elements, it is necessary to abandon the customary three- dimensional system of coordinates and to operate in four dimensions\\". See also Pais's Subtle is the Lord, in which it says of Minkowski's interpretation \\"Thus began the enormous simplification of special relativity\\". See also Miller's \\"Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity\\" in which it says \\"Minkowski's results led to a deeper understanding of relativity theory\\". in terms of a unified four-dimensional \\"spacetime\\" in which absolute intervals are seen to be given by an extension of the Pythagorean theorem. (Already in 1906 Poincar√© anticipated some of Minkowski's ideas, see the section \\"Lorentz- transformation\\").Walter (1999) The utility and naturalness of the representations by Einstein and Minkowski contributed to the rapid acceptance of special relativity, and to the corresponding loss of interest in Lorentz's aether theory. In 1909Einstein (1909) and 1912Einstein (1912) Einstein explained:Martinez (2009) : In 1907 Einstein criticized the \\"ad hoc\\" character of Lorentz's contraction hypothesis in his theory of electrons, because according to him it was an artificial assumption to make the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment conform to Lorentz's stationary aether and the relativity principle.Einstein (1908a) Einstein argued that Lorentz's \\"local time\\" can simply be called \\"time\\", and he stated that the immobile aether as the theoretical foundation of electrodynamics was unsatisfactory.Einstein (1907) He wrote in 1920: Minkowski argued that Lorentz's introduction of the contraction hypothesis \\"sounds rather fantastical\\", since it is not the product of resistance in the aether but a \\"gift from above\\". He said that this hypothesis is \\"completely equivalent with the new concept of space and time\\", though it becomes much more comprehensible in the framework of the new spacetime geometry.Minkowski (1908) However, Lorentz disagreed that it was \\"ad-hoc\\" and he argued in 1913 that there is little difference between his theory and the negation of a preferred reference frame, as in the theory of Einstein and Minkowski, so that it is a matter of taste which theory one prefers. = Mass‚Äìenergy equivalence = It was derived by Einstein (1905) as a consequence of the relativity principle, that inertia of energy is actually represented by E/c^2, but in contrast to Poincar√©'s 1900-paper, Einstein recognized that matter itself loses or gains mass during the emission or absorption.Einstein (1905b) So the mass of any form of matter is equal to a certain amount of energy, which can be converted into and re-converted from other forms of energy. This is the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence, represented by E=mc^2. So Einstein didn't have to introduce \\"fictitious\\" masses and also avoided the perpetual motion problem, because according to Darrigol,Darrigol (2005), 18‚Äì21 Poincar√©'s radiation paradox can simply be solved by applying Einstein's equivalence. If the light source loses mass during the emission by E/c^2, the contradiction in the momentum law vanishes without the need of any compensating effect in the aether. Similar to Poincar√©, Einstein concluded in 1906 that the inertia of (electromagnetic) energy is a necessary condition for the center of mass theorem to hold in systems, in which electromagnetic fields and matter are acting on each other. Based on the mass‚Äìenergy equivalence, he showed that emission and absorption of em-radiation, and therefore the transport of inertia, solves all problems. On that occasion, Einstein referred to Poincar√©'s 1900-paper and wrote:Einstein (1906) Also Poincar√©'s rejection of the reaction principle due to the violation of the mass conservation law can be avoided through Einstein's E=mc^2, because mass conservation appears as a special case of the energy conservation law. = General relativity = The attempts of Lorentz and Poincar√© (and other attempts like those of Abraham and Gunnar Nordstr√∂m) to formulate a theory of gravitation were superseded by Einstein's theory of general relativity.Walter 2007 This theory is based on principles like the equivalence principle, the general principle of relativity, the principle of general covariance, geodesic motion, local Lorentz covariance (the laws of special relativity apply locally for all inertial observers), and that spacetime curvature is created by stress-energy within the spacetime. In 1920, Einstein compared Lorentz's aether with the \\"gravitational aether\\" of general relativity. He said that immobility is the only mechanical property of which the aether has not been deprived by Lorentz, but, contrary to the luminiferous and Lorentz's aether, the aether of general relativity has no mechanical property, not even immobility:Einstein (1922) = Priority = Some claim that Poincar√© and Lorentz are the true founders of special relativity, not Einstein. For more details see the article on this dispute.  Later activity  Viewed as a theory of elementary particles, Lorentz's electron/ether theory was superseded during the first few decades of the 20th century, first by quantum mechanics and then by quantum field theory. As a general theory of dynamics, Lorentz and Poincare had already (by about 1905) found it necessary to invoke the principle of relativity itself in order to make the theory match all the available empirical data. By this point, most vestiges of a substantial aether had been eliminated from Lorentz's \\"aether\\" theory, and it became both empirically and deductively equivalent to special relativity. The main difference was the metaphysical postulate of a unique absolute rest frame, which was empirically undetectable and played no role in the physical predictions of the theory, as Lorentz wrote in 1909,Lorentz 1909, p. 229: It will be clear by what has been said that the impressions received by the two observers A0 and A would be alike in all respects. It would be impossible to decide which of them moves or stands still with respect to the aether, and there would be no reason for preferring the times and lengths measured by the one to those determined by the other, nor for saying that either of them is in possession of the \\"true\\" times or the \\"true\\" lengths. This is a point which Einstein has laid particular stress on, in a theory in which he starts from what he calls the principle of relativity, i. e. the principle that the equations by means of which physical phenomena may be described are not altered in form when we change the axes of coordinates for others having a uniform motion of translation relatively to the original system. I cannot speak here of the many highly interesting applications which Einstein has made of this principle. His results concerning electromagnetic and optical phenomena (...) agree in the main with those which we have obtained in the preceding pages, the chief difference being that Einstein simply postulates what we have deduced, with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily, from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field. By doing so, he may certainly take credit for making us see in the negative result of experiments like those of Michelson, Rayleigh and Brace, not a fortuitous compensation of opposing effects, but the manifestation of a general and fundamental principle. Yet, I think, something may also be claimed in favour of the form in which I have presented the theory. I cannot but regard the aether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with a certain degree of substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter. In this line of thought, it seems natural not to assume at starting that it can never make any difference whether a body moves through the aether or not, and to measure distances and lengths of time by means of rods and clocks having a fixed position relatively to the aether. It would be unjust not to add that, besides the fascinating boldness of its starting point, Einstein's theory has another marked advantage over mine. Whereas I have not been able to obtain for the equations referred to moving axes exactly the same form as for those which apply to a stationary system, Einstein has accomplished this by means of a system of new variables slightly different from those which I have introduced. 1910 (published 1913),Lorentz 1913, p. 75: Provided that there is an aether, then under all systems x, y, z, t, one is preferred by the fact, that the coordinate axes as well as the clocks are resting in the aether. If one connects with this the idea (which I would abandon only reluctantly) that space and time are completely different things, and that there is a \\"true time\\" (simultaneity thus would be independent of the location, in agreement with the circumstance that we can have the idea of infinitely great velocities), then it can be easily seen that this true time should be indicated by clocks at rest in the aether. However, if the relativity principle had general validity in nature, one wouldn't be in the position to determine, whether the reference system just used is the preferred one. Then one comes to the same results, as if one (following Einstein and Minkowski) deny the existence of the aether and of true time, and to see all reference systems as equally valid. Which of these two ways of thinking one is following, can surely be left to the individual. 1913 (published 1914),Lorentz 1914, p. 23: If the observers want to see the concept of time as something primary, something entirely separated from the concept of space, then they would certainly recognize that there is an absolute simultaneity; though they would leave it undecided, whether simultaneity is indicated by equal values of t, or by equal values of t‚Ä≤, or maybe neither by that or the other. Einstein said in a nutshell, that all of those mentioned questions have no meaning. Then he arrives at the \\"abandonment\\" of the aether. Incidentally, the latter is to a certain extent a quarrel about words: it makes no great difference whether one speaks about the vacuum or the aether. In any case, according to Einstein it has no meaning to speak about motion relative to the aether. He also denies the existence of absolute simultaneity. It is certainly remarkable that these relativity concepts, also with respect to time, have been incorporated so quickly. The evaluation of these concepts belongs largely to epistemology to which we can left the judgment, trusting that it can consider the discussed questions with the necessary thoroughness. But it is sure that for a large part it depends on the way of thinking to which one is accustomed, whether one feels attracted to the one view or the other. Regarding to the lecturer himself, he finds a certain satisfaction in the older views, that the aether has at least some substantiality, that space and time can be strictly separated, that one can speak about simultaneity without further specification. Regarding the latter, one can probably refer to the ability that arbitrary great velocities can at least imagined by us. By that, one comes very near to the concept of absolute simultaneity. or in 1912 (published 1922).Lorentz 1922, p. 125: We thus have the choice between two different plans: we can adhere to the concept of an aether or else we can assume a true simultaneity. If one keeps strictly to the relativistic view that all systems are equivalent, one must give up the substantiality of the aether as well as the concept of a true time. The choice of the standpoint depends thus on very fundamental considerations, especially about the time. Of course, the description of natural phenomena and the testing of what the theory of relativity has to say about them can be carried out independently of what one thinks of the aether and the time. From a physical point of view these questions can be left on one side, and especially the question of the true time can be handed over to the theory of knowledge. The modern physicists, as Einstein and Minkowski, speak no longer about the aether at all. This, however, is a question of taste and of words. For, whether there is an aether or not, electromagnetic fields certainly exist, and so also does the energy of the electrical oscillations. If we do not like the name of \\"aether,\\" we must use another word as a peg to hang all these things upon. It is not certain whether \\"space\\" can be so extended as to take care not only of the geometrical properties but also of the electric ones. One cannot deny to the bearer of these properties a certain substantiality, and if so, then one may, in all modesty, call true time the time measured by clocks which are fixed in this medium, and consider simultaneity as a primary concept. As a result, the term \\"Lorentz aether theory\\" is sometimes used today to refer to a neo-Lorentzian interpretation of special relativity.Balashov / Janssen, 2002 The prefix \\"neo\\" is used in recognition of the fact that the interpretation must now be applied to physical entities and processes (such as the standard model of quantum field theory) that were unknown in Lorentz's day. Subsequent to the advent of special relativity, only a small number of individuals have advocated the Lorentzian approach to physics. Many of these, such as Herbert E. Ives (who, along with G. R. Stilwell, performed the first experimental confirmation of time dilation) have been motivated by the belief that special relativity is logically inconsistent, and so some other conceptual framework is needed to reconcile the relativistic phenomena. For example, Ives wrote \\"The 'principle' of the constancy of the velocity of light is not merely 'ununderstandable', it is not supported by 'objective matters of fact'; it is untenable...\\".Herbert E. Ives, \\"Revisions of the Lorentz Transformations\\", October 27, 1950 However, the logical consistency of special relativity (as well as its empirical success) is well established, so the views of such individuals are considered unfounded within the mainstream scientific community. John Stewart Bell advocated teaching special relativity first from the viewpoint of a single Lorentz inertial frame, then showing that Poincare invariance of the laws of physics such as Maxwell's equations is equivalent to the frame-changing arguments often used in teaching special relativity. Because a single Lorentz inertial frame is one of a preferred class of frames, he called this approach Lorentzian in spirit.J. Bell, How to Teach Special Relativity Also some test theories of special relativity use some sort of Lorentzian framework. For instance, the Robertson‚ÄìMansouri‚ÄìSexl test theory introduces a preferred aether frame and includes parameters indicating different combinations of length and times changes. If time dilation and length contraction of bodies moving in the aether have their exact relativistic values, the complete Lorentz transformation can be derived and the aether is hidden from any observation, which makes it kinematically indistinguishable from the predictions of special relativity. Using this model, the Michelson‚ÄìMorley experiment, Kennedy‚ÄìThorndike experiment, and Ives‚ÄìStilwell experiment put sharp constraints on violations of Lorentz invariance.

Fr√©d√©ric Dumas then participated with Jacques-Yves Cousteau in the discovery of the underwater world and in bringing it to the attention of the general public. His life Fr√©d√©ric Dumas was born on 14 January 1913 in Albi. A pioneer of underwater fishing on the French Riviera, he met Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Philippe Tailliez in 1937 and his exploits served as a subject in the first Cousteau film \\"Par dix-huit m√®tres de fond\\" (\\"Eighteen meters deep\\"), made in 1942.

Dumas was a dive leader aboard the RV Calypso, and co-author or actor in many films and stories from the Cousteau team. In 1953 he co-authored with Cousteau the book The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure. It was their first book. In 1956 he was one of the principal architects of the ground-breaking film The Silent World, in which his ballet with the grouper Ulysses (Jojo in French) is famous.

A noseband is the part of a horse's bridle that encircles the nose and jaw of the horse. In English riding, where the noseband is separately attached to its own headstall or crownpiece, held independently of the bit, it is often called a cavesson or caveson noseband. In other styles of riding, a simple noseband is sometimes attached directly to the same headstall as the bit. Development A noseband may have been one of the first tools used by humans to domesticate and ride horses. The bit developed later. The noseband was originally made of leather or rope. After the invention of the bit, the noseband was, in some cultures, demoted to a halter worn beneath the bridle that allowed the rider to remove the bit from the horse's mouth after work and leave a restraining halter on underneath, or to tie the horse by this halter, instead of by the bit, which could result in damage to the horse's mouth if it panicked. However, its ability to hold a horse's mouth shut over the bit was also recognized, as was its usefulness for attaching equipment such as a martingale, and so in some traditions it was sometimes left as a working part of a bridle. Still other cultures, such as that of Ancient Persia, developed the noseband as a tool for training young horses, called a hakma, and this training noseband evolved into modern equipment such as today's bosal-style hackamore and Longeing cavesson. Today, there are also many styles of bitless bridle that rely on a noseband as the main method of communication and control. Uses Today, the noseband has several uses: *First, to give a balanced and traditionally correct appearance to the horse's turnout at shows. When raised high, it can make a long-nosed horse's face look shorter and more proportional. Various positions up and down the nose may help the face look more handsome, and a wide noseband can make a heavy head appear more delicate. *Second, to keep the horse's mouth closed or at least prevent a horse from evading the bit by opening the mouth too far. It can sometimes prevent the horse from putting its tongue over the bit and avoiding pressure in that manner. *Third, the noseband is also used to help stop a horse from pulling. A correctly-fitted noseband can be used instead of a stronger bit, which makes it a valuable option for riders that want more control, but do not want to back their horse off, that is, to make the horse afraid to go forward, especially when jumping, which is often an undesirable consequence when the horse is placed in a strong or harsh bit. *Fourth, it can be an attachment for other equipment, such as a standing martingale or shadow roll. *It is also valuable for young horses just learning to go \\"on the bit\\", as it supports the jaw and helps the horse to relax its masseter muscle, and flex softly at the poll. *In some riding styles, a noseband is added simply for decoration and is not attached to the bridle or adjusted to serve any useful purpose. *All bitless bridles rely on a noseband instead of using a metal bit. Some are very similar to a cavesson (such as a sidepull or scrawrig style), some more like a drop noseband (crossunder or indian hackamore style) while others support a metal 'hackamore' piece. There is a correlation between the sensitivity of a noseband and the amount of tension needed in the reins to obtain a response from the horse. In a 2011 study of horses being ridden in English riding equipment with the noseband in one of three adjacent adjustments, greater rein tension was needed to get a response from the horses when they had the looser adjustment. However, the study did not go on to examine the effects of no noseband at all or a very tight adjustment. Thus, nosebands may add some pressure to the nose when the reins are applied, depending on adjustment, style and the degree to which the horse resists the bit. With a soft leather noseband on a well-trained horse, the effect is minimal. A bridle does not necessarily need a noseband, and many bridles, such as those used in Western riding, flat racing, or endurance riding, do not have one. Some horses shown in-hand do not use a noseband in order to better show off the animal's head. Many old paintings also depict a hunting horse without a noseband, since it was not always deemed useful by certain riders. However, even in disciplines such as western riding, where it is considered a sign of a polished horse to not require a noseband or cavesson, one is often used on horses in training as a precaution to help prevent the horse from learning bad habits such as opening the mouth and evading the bit. Types of English riding nosebands Classic English-style Cavesson Noseband Flash noseband Figure-eight noseband. In the English riding disciplines, the most common design of cavesson noseband is the Plain or French cavesson, a noseband that encircles the nose 1‚Äì2 inches below the cheekbone. This type of noseband is seen in most English disciplines, especially in dressage, show hunters, saddle seat, equitation and field hunters, but is the basic noseband for all disciplines. This noseband comes in various styles from a plain flat leather suitable for hunting, to raised, double raised, fancy stitched, colored and padded styles. All of them perform the same purpose. Other designs include: * Aachen or Flash noseband: The flash was originally developed for show jumping riders, so they could close the mouth lower down in addition to having an appropriate noseband for a standing martingale. An additional feature of this noseband is that it holds the bit steady in the horse's mouth, which some horses prefer. The noseband is similar to the plain cavesson in that the top part encircles the nose 1-2 inches below the cheekbone, but it also includes a second strap that runs from the cavesson, around the nose in front of the bit and under the chin groove, then coming back around to the cavesson. This second piece is used to help keep the horse's mouth closed and to keep the horse from crossing his jaw. A flash noseband may be used with a standing martingale when the martingale is attached to the cavesson piece. This noseband is usually seen at the lower levels of dressage, or in the dressage phase of eventing. The flash nose band was named for King George III's horse Bold Flash. It was developed by a stable hand to increase King George's control over his mount. *Crank noseband or Swedish Cavesson: used most often on dressage horses at levels where a double bridle is worn, this noseband is similar to the plain cavesson except it has a leveraged buckle design that may be adjusted very tight, so as to keep the horse's mouth closed. Double bridles cannot use flash or drop cavessons, so the crank is usually seen on upper level dressage horses who will not keep the mouth shut. It is also used occasionally on show hunters and hunt seat equitation horses. If adjusted so the horse can't open its jaw at all when the crank is tight, the horse also cannot relax its jaw. Additionally, it can push the cheeks against the horse's teeth when overtightened, which is painful. * Drop noseband: Invented by the Spanish Riding School, this noseband encircles the nose around the chin groove, as opposed to just below the cheekbone, with the strap on the nasal bone, and never below it. It reminds the horse to keep its mouth closed and prevents the horse from crossing the jaw. Due to its position on the lower part of the face, it should not be used with a standing martingale. A drop noseband is also not suitable for galloping work, as it tends to restrict the nostrils if it is fitted incorrectly. Although the drop used to be very popular in dressage, it is very rarely seen today, partly because many riders dislike the look it gives the horse's head. However, many horses prefer the drop noseband to the flash, and it is a very useful piece of equipment. * Figure-eight: Also called a crossed, Grackle or Mexican noseband, this noseband crosses from the top of the ckeekbone on one side, over the nose to the chin groove on the other side, under the horse's chin, and back up to the opposite cheekbone. It is used to remind the horse to keep its mouth closed and prevents him from crossing his jaw, and its design provides more expansion of the nostrils, which is preferable for horses performing work involving galloping (eventing, polo, racing), and has always been popular in show jumping. Many people believe that this type of noseband is more comfortable than a flash. * Hanoverian: Also called a \\"crank with flash\\" this is the same as a flash noseband, but with the addition of a padded jawband like a crank noseband has. It operates to hold the horse's mouth shut and hold the bit steady in the horse's mouth. It is very commonly found on dressage bridles. *Kineton or Puckle: Named for the English town of Kineton, and originating in horse racing for animals uncontrollable at high speeds, this noseband often cited as being rather severe. It transfers bit pressure from the rider's hand to the nose. The Kineton has metal half-rings that pass under the bit, and a leather strap that sits below the bit and over the nose (which it does not encircle) about where a drop noseband would cross. There is no strap to keep the horse's mouth closed. This noseband is only used with a snaffle bit and without a martingale. It is most commonly seen in eventing on the cross- country phase, and in show jumping. This noseband allows the rider to ride lightly with a mild bit and still stop a strong horse. *Lever or combination noseband: this noseband has a half-moon piece of metal that goes on each side of the horse's face. On the \\"top\\" end of the curve (near the horse's cheek bone), a piece of leather is attached that runs under the jaw and attaches to the other side of the face. At the peak of the curve is a piece of leather that runs over the top of nose in a position slightly lower from where a regular cavesson would cross. At the \\"bottom\\" of the curve, a third piece of leather goes under the chin groove of the horse. This noseband is similar in design to the figure-eight, and works similarly by preventing the horse from crossing his jaws (which is especially helped by the metal on either side of the face). Unlike the figure-eight, it does not stabilize the bit and it tends to push the cheeks in against the horse's molars which can be painful. *Worcester noseband: This noseband is based on the cavesson, but has a second narrower strap sewn in an inverted V shape to the front, which attaches directly to the bit on each side. This transfers some of the pressure from the reins to the nose, and is a less severe noseband than the Kineton, while still giving more control on a strong horse than a plain cavesson. Training designs Noseband and cavessons generally used only for training, or ground handling, include: A young horse in a longeing cavesson *Longeing cavesson (UK: \\"Lungeing\\") is a piece of equipment used in longeing a horse, made of leather or nylon web. Though the longeing cavesson looks a bit like a halter, the noseband can be tightened and rings are strategically placed on the sides and at the front of the nose for attachment of a longe line or side reins. It provides much better leverage and more precise control of a horse in ground training, yet it is a relatively gentle piece of equipment. Illustration including three serreta nosebands *Serreta: A type of noseband built into a halter or bridle, made of metal and usually with one or three rings protruding outward. Because it is heavy, it commonly is supported with a frentera. The serreta sometimes is studded inside. It is most commonly seen in the Iberian peninsula and Hungary. *Studded: a studded cavesson has round or sharp studs on the inside. This cavesson is most common in Iberia, especially on young horses, so as not to \\"spoil\\" their mouths, and in Austro-Hungaria. They have also been adopted in other disciplines as a means of controlling a difficult horse, or as a training shortcut, but they are generally illegal in most horse show competition. Blunt studs have a relatively mild effect. Sharp studs, like a serrated knife, are extremely painful and can cut the horse. When used while riding, they act with the normal action of the noseband, which applies pressure to the nose when the horse fails to submit to the bit, and increases the effect of this pressure. Western designs In western riding, nosebands are not generally worn with an ordinary working bridle. Nosebands attached to the cheekpieces of the bridle, used purely for decorative purposes, were popular during the 1950s and in many western movies, but are not common today. When nosebands are used with western equipment, they usually fall into one of three categories: #A relatively strong noseband, often on its own headstall, may be worn for the purpose of supporting a standing martingale or tiedown. It is generally adjusted to lie just below the cheekbones, but is adjusted loosely or may not be adjustable. It does not keep the horse's mouth shut, it only supports the tiedown. #Nosebands are used in training. Some young horses are started in a hackamore that includes a specialized design of rawhide noseband called a bosal, to which reins are attached. As a trained hackamore horse advances into a bit, a lightweight bosal, sometimes called a \\"pencil bosal\\" may be kept on the bridle, with or without a separate set of reins. On young horses started in a snaffle bit, some western trainers use a light rope or pencil bosal as a loose noseband to prevent the horse from gaping its mouth to avoid the bit. It is adjusted loosely, but the material is more stiff and unyielding than leather. On hot or sensitive horses, a standard plain cavesson similar to that used on English bridles may be used instead. #There are various designs of bitless bridles that incorporate nosebands in lieu of a bit for control, including the sidepull and the mechanical hackamore. Fitting Different styles of noseband are fitted according to their purpose. A horse must be able to part its teeth and open its mouth slightly (not visible on the outside) in order to flex correctly at the jaw, relax and come onto the bit. An excessively tight noseband will prevent this. If a horse cannot relax its jaw, it will have problems with proper head carriage, and the rider may then try to force the horse into position by pulling back on the reins or using artificial leverage devices. Standard adjustment of a noseband is to allow one or two fingers between the noseband and the nasal bone of the horse's head, though many riders adjust it tighter. Research is ongoing to determine stress and pain levels related to excessively tight nosebands. Recent studies in equitation science now strongly recommend that traditional and crank nosebands be adjusted so that two fingers can be inserted at the \\"nasal midline\\"‚Äîwhere the noseband crosses the top of the nose. The International Society for Equitation Science has stated that tight nosebands may lead to physiological stress and mask unwanted behavior and they encourage competition rules to be amended to require horse show stewards to check noseband tightness with a standardized gauge and see that competitors adjust their equipment accordingly. *French or plain cavesson: The headstall is adjusted so that the noseband sits roughly equidistant between the prominent cheek bone and the horse's lips. Around the nose and jaw, this cavesson should be fitted so that, depending on the size of the horse and the size of the rider's hand, one or two fingers can be easily inserted between the noseband and the top of the nose. *Drop: This style is fitted with the strap and buckle fastening below the bit in the chin groove. Care should be taken not to allow the top part to rest below the nasal bone ‚Äì if it presses on the soft tissue below this bone it can impede breathing. In general, a drop noseband is fitted so that a finger can be placed between the front and the nasal bone. *Flash: The upper cavesson is adjusted somewhat tighter than a plain cavesson to prevent it from being pulled toward the end of the muzzle by the lower flash strap. The lower flash strap runs below the bit and under the chin groove. It is buckled so the remainder of the strap points downwards. *Crank: Opinions vary on the adjustment of this style. Some believe it should be extremely tight, to prevent the horse from opening or crossing its jaws. Others think tight cavessons mask undesirable behavior, recommending the traditional adjustment of one or two fingers to pass between the noseband and the top of the nose. Recent studies by the International Society for Equitation Science discourage extremely tight adjustment of any noseband and recommend a \\"two fingers\\" adjustment to all nosebands in competition.

Wickham Market Hoard hoard of Iron Age coins In 2009 it was announced that one of the largest Iron Age coin finds had been discovered at a site near Wickham Market. The hoard of 840 Iron Age gold staters was found in March 2008, in a field at Dallinghoo near the village, by car mechanic, Michael Dark using a metal detector. After excavation of the site, a total of 825 coins were found, and by the time the hoard was declared treasure trove, 840 coins had been discovered. The hoard was described as \\"the largest hoard of British Iron Age gold coins to be studied in its entirety\\", and was also significant in providing \\"a lot of new information about the Iron Age, and particularly East Anglia in the late Iron Age\\". It was the largest hoard of staters to be found since the Whaddon Chase Iron Age hoard in 1849.

In 1900. the School offered its first course in architecture, taught by John Begg, later Consulting Architect of Bombay and of the Government of India. A complete 4-year programme was established in 1908 under Begg's assistant George Wittet. In 1917, architect Claude Batley became a visiting professor; he was Principal of the School from 1923 to 1943, and is commemorated in the Claude Batley Architectural Gallery for architectural exhibitions, opened in 1996. In 1896, the Draughtsman's classes, the nucleus of the Department of Architecture, were added. This Department was later organised for a 3 years Diploma Course which was duly recognised by the R.I.B.A. Board. In 1910, the Sir George Clarke Studies and Laboratories were built for the advanced study of crafts, pottery being the first craft taken up for study.

Original run Sky television's acquisition of rights to broadcast live Premier League football from the start of the 1992‚Äì93 season saw them attempt innovations such as digital on-screen graphics (DOG) and Monday Night live games. The first Monday Night Football game broadcast was between Manchester City and Queens Park Rangers on 17 August 1992, which ended in a 1‚Äì1 draw.Manchester City club history To give the broadcasts a different look to Sky's Super Sunday strand, the broadcaster introduced the Sky Strikers, a dance troupe similar to American cheerleaders.Girls who give Sky high kicks the Independent This pre-match and half-time entertainment was dropped after the first season. The show had a number of different formats after its launch. The first change led to the merging of Andy Gray's Boot Room format into the show; analysing the previous weekend's football matches utilising the latest computer technology combined with Gray's individual analysis. As the UEFA Champions League gained in importance for Premier League clubs, the number of games played on Monday night declined. Sky Sports then reverted to a format similar to that of Ford Super Sunday with a presenter (Jeff Stelling) and studio guests. In 2004‚Äì05, the analysis section was then incorporated into an additional programme shown after Ford Super Sunday called Ford Super Sunday: The Last Word. The show ended after the 2006‚Äì07 season when Setanta and subsequently ESPN obtained the rights for Monday night Premier League games. Current run Monday Night Football returned from the 2010‚Äì11 season after Sky regained the rights to Monday night Premier League games. The games broadcast kick off at 8:00 pm on Monday nights. The show also started broadcasting in high-definition. Due to the structure of the broadcasting packages for the 2010‚Äì13 seasons, Sky broadcast a minimum of 12 live Premier League games on Monday nights.¬£1.78bn: Record Premier League TV deal defies economic slump The Independent Before the departures of Richard Keys and Andy Gray, the programme had a different appearance to Super Sunday, presented by Keys and Gray from a purpose-built studio with Andy Gray's analysis also returning from its Sunday evening slot. After the pair's unscheduled departure from Sky in January 2011, the first half-hour of analysis was dropped, and for the remainder of the season the show was presented from the stadium in largely the same format as Sunday or midweek Premier League matches with a rotation of presenters and pundits, although the distinct \\"MNF\\" branding and graphics were retained. Ed Chamberlin was given the presenting role for the 2011‚Äì12 season, with Gary Neville as the new analyst. The show also returned to its previous format in the purpose-built analysis studio, with Chamberlin and Neville carrying out the same roles as Keys and Gray the previous season. In 2013, Jamie Carragher joined the Monday Night Football show, to form a regular three-man line-up alongside Chamberlin and Neville, after having announced his retirement from football at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season. The first Monday Night Football of the 2013-14 season and Jamie Carragher's first appearance aired on 19 August 2013 with the Manchester City against Newcastle United game.

Three accurate measures of resistance are made at precise temperatures, then the coefficients are derived by solving three simultaneous equations.

Steinhart and Stanley R. Hart who first published the relationship in 1968.John S. Steinhart, Stanley R. Hart, Calibration curves for thermistors, Deep-Sea Research and Oceanographic Abstracts, Volume 15, Issue 4, August 1968, Pages 497‚Äì503, ISSN 0011-7471, . Professor Steinhart (1929‚Äì2003), a fellow of the American Geophysical Union and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, was a member of the faculty of University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison from 1969 to 1991. Dr. Hart, a Senior Scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution since 1989 and fellow of the Geological Society of America, the American Geophysical Union, the Geochemical Society and the European Association of Geochemistry, was associated with Professor Steinhart at the Carnegie Institution of Washington when the equation was developed.  Derivation and alternatives  The most general form of the equation can be derived from extending the B parameter equation to an infinite series: : R = R_0 e^{B\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{T} - \\\\frac{1}{T_0}\\\\right)} : \\\\frac{1}{T} = \\\\frac{1}{T_0} + \\\\frac{1}{B} \\\\left(\\\\ln \\\\frac{R}{R_0}\\\\right) = a_0 + a_1 \\\\ln \\\\frac{R}{R_0} : \\\\frac{1}{T} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n \\\\left(\\\\ln \\\\frac{R}{R_0}\\\\right)^n R_0 is a reference (standard) resistance value. The Steinhart‚ÄìHart equation assumes R_0 is 1 ohm. The curve fit is much less accurate when it is assumed a_2=0 and a different value of R_0 such as 1 kŒ© is used. However, using the full set of coefficients avoids this problem as it simply results in shifted parameters. In the original paper, Steinhart and Hart remark that allowing a_2 eq 0 degraded the fit. This is surprising as allowing more freedom would usually improve the fit. It may be because the authors fitted 1/T instead of T, and thus the error in T increased from the extra freedom. Subsequent papers have found great benefit in allowing a_2 eq 0. The equation was developed through trial-and-error testing of numerous equations, and selected due to its simple form and good fit. However, in its original form, the Steinhart‚ÄìHart equation is not sufficiently accurate for modern scientific measurements. For interpolation using a small number of measurements, the series expansion with n=4 has been found to be accurate within 1 mK over the calibrated range. Some authors recommend using n=5. If there are many data points, standard polynomial regression can also generate accurate curve fits. Some manufacturers have begun providing regression coefficients as an alternative to Steinhart‚ÄìHart coefficients.

Early life  Albanov was born in 1881 in Voronezh and was raised by his uncle in the city of Ufa. At the age of seventeen he entered the Naval College at Saint Petersburg, from which he graduated in 1904.  Brusilov expedition  He served on board a number of ships before signing on as navigator aboard the , under Captain Georgy Brusilov, for an intendend expedition to traverse the Northern Sea Route ‚Äì a feat which only once before had been successfully completed, by explorer Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld. The expedition was ill-planned and ill-executed by Brusilov, and the Svyataya Anna became locked in the sea ice of the Kara Sea in October 1912\\\\. Supplies were abundant, so officers and crew prepared themselves for wintering, hoping to be freed in the following year's thaw. However, during 1913, the sea remained completely frozen. By early 1914, the ship had drifted with the ice northwest of Franz Josef Land, and did not seem likely to be freed that year either. = Journey across the ice = Albanov and Alexander Konrad approaching Svyatoy Foka in their kayak, minutes before their rescue Albanov, believing that their position was hopeless, requested permission from Captain Brusilov to be relieved from his duties as second-in-command to leave the ship and attempt to return to civilization on foot. Albanov's aim was to reach Hvidtenland, the northeasternmost island group of Franz Josef Land. He used Fridtjof Nansen's inaccurate map, full of dotted lines where the archipelago was still unexplored. Thirteen other crewmen accompanied Albanov when he travelled south-westwards by ski, sledge, and kayak. The progress was difficult because of the cracks in the ice, the numerous polynias and the abundance of ridges which made progress slow. After a long and gruesome ordeal, only Albanov and one crewman, Alexander Konrad, made it to Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, where they knew that Frederick George Jackson had left provisions and a hut in a previous expedition. Albanov and Konrad were rescued by timely arrival of the Svyatoy Foka under the command of Georgy Sedov, while they were preparing for the winter.  Later life  Albanov was later convinced to write up his memoirs of his adventure, and they were first published in Saint Petersburg in 1917. He returned to the sea, but died only a few years later. Accounts of his death vary, with some having him die of typhoid, and some reporting that he was killed in the explosion of a railway wagon carrying munitions in Achinsk, in the Governorate of Yeniseysk in Siberia.  Legacy  The data about the drift of the Svyataya Anna on the pack ice of the Kara Sea supplied by Albanov were carefully studied in 1924, by Soviet oceanographer Vladimir Wiese. He detected an odd deviation of the path of the ship's drift caused by certain variations of the patterns of sea and ice currents. Wiese deemed that the deviation was caused by the presence of an undiscovered island whose coordinates he was able to calculate with precision thanks to Albanov's data. This island was later discovered and named Wiese Island. In 1975, Arctic expert William Barr wrote, \\"The name of Valerian Ivanovich Albanov must be ranked among those of the immortals of polar exploration.\\" A glacier in October Revolution Island, in the Severnaya Zemlya group has been named after Valerian Albanov. A Russian expedition in September 2010, following the route of the crew members left behind, found some remainders of them: a human skeleton, a watch, snowshoes, a knife, a spoon with a sailor's initials, and sunglasses made from empty rum bottles' glass in the shores of Franz Josef Land.

Completed in 1905, it was Britain's first transporter bridge and the largest of its type ever built in the world. It continued in use until 22 July 1961, when it was replaced by a through arch bridge, now known as the Silver Jubilee Bridge. The transporter bridge was then demolished. History View along the bridge interior At the beginning of the 20th century the only means of crossing the river Mersey at Runcorn Gap were by rail on the Runcorn Railway Bridge (which also had a footpath) or by using the ancient ferry (a rowing boat). In the 1890s the Manchester Ship Canal had been constructed and this meant that the journey by ferry had to be made in two stages, with a climb over the wall of the canal between the stages. A road bridge was clearly needed but it would have to pass high enough over the canal to allow the passage of ocean-going ships. The cost of doing this was felt to be prohibitive. In 1899 the Widnes & Runcorn Bridge Company was established under the chairmanship of Sir John Brunner to investigate the options. Their decision was to build a transporter bridge. This would be cheaper than an orthodox type of bridge and the passage of the transporter car could be timed to allow the passage of the ships. The first transporter bridge in the world had been opened in 1893 in Bilbao, Spain. This had been followed in 1898 by transporter bridges in Rouen (France) and Bizerta (now Tunisia). Parliamentary approval had already been obtained for a transporter bridge over the River Usk at Newport, Monmouthshire. This was then followed by the construction of a transporter bridge in Middlesbrough over the River Tees in 1911. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1900 giving approval for the bridge, and the Act also allowed for the formal ending of the ferry. It was designed by John Webster and John Wood. Construction began in December 1901 and was completed in 1905. The cost was ¬£130,000 (). The transporter bridge was opened (in the absence of King Edward VII who was indisposed) by Sir John Brunner on 29 May 1905. During the following years there were problems both with the functioning of the bridge and with its financing. The Company could not make it pay and in 1911 it was sold to Widnes Corporation. A number of improvements were made to the bridge over the years. In its later years it made 49,000 journeys annually, carrying 280,000 cars, 145,000 commercial vehicles and over 2 million passengers. However, it was inadequate for the growing needs of the region and its physical condition was deteriorating. A fixed high-level bridge was needed and this was eventually opened on 21 July 1961. The transporter bridge closed the following day and was later demolished. Structure Drawing of the bridge showing span and transporter car The two towers were high and the distance between them spanned by a truss was . The weight of the cables suspending the girder was 250 tons. The underside of the girder was above the high water level. The transporter car was long and wide and was designed to carry 4 two-horse farm waggons and 300 passengers. A shelter was provided for the passengers. The bottom of the car was above high water level and it cleared the ship canal wall by . It was suspended from a moving trolley long. In conditions of reasonable weather and load the journey took 2.5 minutes. The driver was sited in a cabin on top of the car from which he had an uninterrupted view in all directions. An endless wire rope, pulled by a winch housed in the power house, provided the power to move the trolley across the River Mersey. The winch on the Widnes side pulled the trolley towards Widnes and Runcorn in turn. Approach roads of on the Widnes side and on the Runcorn side were built. Former power house with the road and rail bridges visible beyond Present day The former approaches to the transporter bridge at the bottom of Waterloo Road, Runcorn, and Mersey Road, Widnes, can still be seen. On the Widnes side the power house remains and it has been designated as a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. Transporter Building, the former office building, also remains nearby in Mersey Road.

Zurayk () (April 18, 1909 ‚Äì August 11, 2000) was a prominent and influential Syrian Arab intellectual who was one of the first to pioneer and express the importance of Arab nationalism. He stressed the urgent need to transform stagnant Arab society by means of rational thought and radical modification of the methods of thinking and acting. He developed some ideas, such as the \\"Arab mission\\" and \\"national philosophy\\", which were to become key concepts for Arab nationalist thinkers, and in more recent years was a strong proponent of an intellectual reformation of Arab society, emphasizing the need for rationalism and an ethical revolution. He is credited with coining the term Nakba to refer to the expulsion of the Palestinians from their lands in 1948.. Life and academic career Constantine Zurayk was born in Damascus, Syria Vilayet on April 18, 1909 during the waning years of the ruling Ottoman Empire, to a Greek Orthodox Christian family. He received his primary and secondary education in the Orthodox school systems and had an obsession with acquiring knowledge. He continued his education at the American University of Beirut, and eventually received his PhD at Princeton University all by the age of twenty-one. He immediately turned to teaching and became a Professor of History at the American University of Beirut.Jafet Library Database, American University of Beirut After receiving his PhD, Zurayk focused his aims in teaching and politics. Alongside his work as a tenured professor, Zurayk experimented as the 1st Counselor to the Syrian Legation of the United States in 1945, and acted as the Delegate to the UN Security Council and to the UN General Assembly in 1946.The International Who's Who of the Arab World. Zurayk later took an offer to become the Vice President of the American University of Beirut in 1952, and completed his education by receiving his Doctorate in Literature at the University of Michigan in 1967.The International Who's Who of the Arab World.

His goal was to discover a means of radically and expeditiously transforming Arab society into a practical, rational, and scientific society. Zurayk focused his attention on contemporary Arab society and the current crisis of Arab civilization. He blamed the change in Arab personality as the reason for the weakened Arab civilization. Zurayk noted that the turning away from the ‚Äúideas of unity, loyalty, and the universal outlook led to the replacement of the spiritual motivations with material ones‚Äù.Arab Civilization: Challenges and Responses: Studies in Honor of Constantine K. Zurayk Although this process of decline was an internal cause, Zurayk attributed the cause of the Nahda, or modern Arab renaissance, to external factors. One of the external contributors, which Zurayk believed played a significant role in demanding change in Arab society, was ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù or modern civilization. Because the West would continue to impose itself on Arab society, it was imperative that the Arabs work to understand and comprehend it in order to confront it. Zurayk urged the Arab society to keep up with modern civilization and accept, rather than disregard, the scientific and technological influences of modern civilization. In order to revitalize the Arab society, Zurayk demanded that there must be a radical change in Arab life. He called ‚Äúfor science and productivity,‚Äù and warned that the advancement of Arab society is dependent on whether that notion became a part of Arab‚Äôs ‚Äúfeelings and thoughts and a source of their will‚Äù.Patai, pg. 259 Although science and technology were of utmost importance, Zurayk considered ideals of citizenship, nationalism, and unity as additional, necessary requirements for the modernization of Arab society. Zurayk insisted that the combination of rational powers and ethical powers would lead to a successful future. Zurayk delved deeper to describe the primary challenge of Arab civilization. He believed rationalism was the ‚Äúprerequisite that encompassed all other prerequisites‚Äù for a future, modern Arab society.Arab Civilization: Challenges and Responses: Studies in Honor of Constantine K. Zurayk The cultural backwardness remained the most dangerous battle in the fight for a modern Arab society, and only through rational thinking would the Arab society look towards the future, realize their human potentials, and build a higher civilization. Zurayk made it clear that Arab society must join the modern world, and to do this, they must change their previous ways. Zurayk even left a list of changes that must be made in order for a revolution to succeed: there must be use of the machine on a wide scale, the state and religion must be separated, the scientific spirit of each individual and the society as a whole must be invigorated, and Arab society must be open toward the rational and spiritual values of other human civilizations.Arab Civilization: Challenges and Responses: Studies in Honor of Constantine K. Zurayk Reflection and evaluation of Arab culture For Zurayk, the human powers that make culture are the civilizational powers of human reason in its critical and creative functions. Zurayk focused on the values of honesty, hard work, perseverance, seriousness, commitment, responsibility, and freedom as the values that allow humans to acquire scientific knowledge and to develop a sense of beauty and justice.Kassab, pg. 65-73 In this regard, Zurayk was inspired by the prominent Egyptian intellectual, Taha Hussein, who sternly believed that the advancement of Arab society was dependent on the education of every individual. Hussein was the Minister of Education at Cairo University in 1950 and was eventually able to provide free education for all Egyptians. Both intellectuals sought to help Arab people uncover their hidden gems that would lead to a more advanced Arab society. Zurayk focused on encouraging the Arab people to access their hidden human powers which would enable them to work toward a just and moral society. He introduced what he called the ‚Äúrevolution of reason,‚Äù where he called for a national Arab unity based on a ‚Äúsecular democracy in which diverse individuals and communities can fulfill themselves in a framework of tolerance and mutual respect‚Äù.Kassab, pp. 65-73 Contribution to Arab nationalism For Zurayk, Arab nationalism was a ‚Äúcivilizational project rather than a defensive obsession with identity boundaries in need of protection‚Äù.Kassab, pp. 65-73 For the project to become successful, the responsibilities of the Arab people were great. Zurayk emphasized that Arab culture must be ‚Äúearned and created by human effort‚Äù.Kassab, pp. 65-73 In his book In the Battle for Culture (1964), Zurayk further stresses the importance of the decisive role of human agency: ‚ÄúThe main factors in civilizational changes are in our view acquired volitional human factors.... Natural or environmental factors, such as race and heredity, geographic situation, economic system, and social, intellectual, and moral conditions, are all possibilities or bonds. And possibilities and bonds do not make life, nor do they give rise to cultures. It is the human being who becomes aware of these bonds and strives to overcome them, and who realizes the possibilities and works to fulfill them, who is the maker. It is with this awareness and this striving that civilizations rise and fall‚Äù.The Arab Consciousness Zurayk essentially rejected the doctrines of determinism and monism that prevailed in theories of culture such as the progressive reason in European Enlightenment thinking, the evolutionary progress in the positivism of Darwin, and the will of God in monotheism. He believed the doctrines to be ‚Äúsuperimposed on human history rather than derived from its concrete givens‚Äù.Kassab, pp. 65-73 Zurayk's first notable publication, based on a lecture that he gave in 1938, was entitled The Arab Consciousness (al- Wa\`i al-\`Arabi). In the book, he introduced the concept of the \\"Arab mission\\" and stated that the aim of each nation was \\"the message it brings to human culture and general civilization\\" and that a nation without a mission was not worthy of the name.Charif, p. 209 The consciousness of having a \\"national mission\\" would bring the Arab struggle for independence new strength and meaning and would regain for the Arabs their world role. As for the Arab mission itself, in the current age it would be ‚Äúto absorb the knowledge of the West and to join it with the views that have arisen in reaction to it, and to combine them in a new unity that will be a sign of the coming life, and that the Arabs will spread to the world as they spread their brilliant civilization in the past ages‚Äù.Quoted by Charif, pp. 209-210. It was also in this work that Zurayk called for a \\"national philosophy\\", which he expressed as the thought absorbed by the youth of the nation combined with their feelings to form a \\"nationalist creed.‚Äù Such a philosophy, he declared, was necessary for national renewal.Charif, p. 210. Debate of nationalism and religion While many enlightened thinkers believed religion was not a determining factor of a nation, Zurayk ‚Äúsought to establish a rapport between Islam and Arab nationalism‚Äù.Hilal KhashanArabs at the Crossroads: political identity and nationalism. Throughout his research and observation, Zurayk indeed made a connection between religion and nationalism. Although he was not Muslim himself, Zurayk believed Islam was the missing link for Arab nationalism. Arab society was spiritually awakened ‚Äúwherever [Islam] was established and spread.‚Äù To Zurayk, it was simple: whenever Islam was flourishing, so was Arab civilization; and whenever Islam ‚Äúreduced itself to beliefs transmitted blindly and religious laws and statutes unwisely imposed, Arab civilization waned‚Äù.Arab Civilization: Challenges and Responses: Studies in Honor of Constantine K. Zurayk Many Arab thinkers insisted the Arab nation existed and prospered prior to Islam, while Islamists define the nation based on the religious community. Zurayk looked at the issue from a different perspective. In essence, he viewed Arab Nationalism as a spiritual movement much like any religion, Islam in particular. He made clear, ‚Äútrue nationalism cannot in any way contradict true religion, for in its essence it is a spiritual movement which aims at resurrecting the inner forces of the nation and at realizing its intellectual and spiritual potentialities‚Äù.Arabs Face the Modern World: religion, cultural, and political responses to the West. Furthermore, Zurayk explained the significance of Muhammad and his connection to Arab nationalism. He reiterated the importance of cultural heritage in that it must not be forgotten to build a modern Arab society. Zurayk explained how Muhammad came to the Arab world in a time of great need and unified the community. He was a man of conviction who put up with persecution and humiliation all for the sake of inspiring and transforming his fellow companions to broaden their horizons and access their potentials to build a new civilization. Zurayk concluded his argument by saying: ‚ÄúWhatever his sect or religious community, therefore, it is the duty of every Arab to interest himself in his past culture. This interest is the first duty enjoined on him by his nationality. He must come forward to study Islam and understand its true nature and thus sanctify the memory of the great Prophet to whom Islam was revealed‚Äù.Arabs Face the Modern World: religion, cultural, and political responses to the West. Engagement in intellectual debate For Zurayk, the role of intellectuals remained crucial in efforts to \\"raise the level of the masses\\" and bring Arab society out of its weakened condition.Charif, pp. 287-288, 300-301 Analyzing the Arab response to their failure to prevent the establishment of the Zionist state of Israel, Zurayk wrote in his book The Meaning of Disaster that: ‚ÄúSeven Arab states declare war on Zionism in Palestine, stop impotent before it, and turn on their heels. The representatives of the Arabs deliver fiery speeches in the highest international forums, warning what the Arab state and peoples will do if this or that decision be enacted. Declarations fall like bombs from the mouths of officials at the meetings of the Arab League, but when action becomes necessary, the fire is still and quiet and steel and iron are rusted and twisted, quick to bend and disintegrate‚Äù. Zurayk later reaffirms his thoughts on stagnant Arab society by stating: ‚ÄúThe reason for the victory of the Zionists was that the roots of Zionism are grounded in modern Western life, while we for the most part are still distant from this life and hostile to it. They live in the present and for the future, while we continue to dream the dreams of the past and to stupefy ourselves with its fading glory‚Äù.Patai, p. 262 Arab liberal thought Zurayk had a strong view on history and rejected all forms of ‚Äúhistorical determinism and all forms of dogmatic ideological reading of history‚Äù.Kassab, pp. 65-73 His most critical belief was that of Arab history in particular. He rejected the thin view of Arab history that limited it to Islamic history. Zurayk felt Arab history needed to be understood in the widest sense possible and needed to be explored in connection with other ancient civilizations of the area.Kassab, pp. 68-70 He firmly expressed that history should be judged with a mind completely free of dogma. Zurayk's ‚Äúrevolution of reason‚Äù proved to be his most influential contribution to modern Arab liberal thought. He called for a national Arab unity based on a ‚Äúsecular democracy in which diverse individuals and communities can fulfill themselves in a framework of tolerance and mutual respect‚Äù.Kassab, pp. 65-68 Since Zurayk grew up in an Orthodox Christian family, tolerance was a key tenet. In order to have a unified and sufficient Arab society, Zurayk asked for openness to interfaith dialogue and conflict resolution with such communities as the Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Unlike other Arab intellectuals, Zurayk did not see reason as the blind imitation of the West.

He was a descendant of the Fugger merchant family located in the Free Imperial City of Augsburg, where he was born and later also elevated through marriage to Grand Burgher of Augsburg (German Gro√üb√ºrger zu Augsburg). Within a few decades he expanded the family firm to a business operating in all of Europe. He began his education at the age of 14 in Venice, which also remained his main residence until 1487. At the same time he was a cleric and held several prebendaries, even though he never lived in a monastery. Fugger is held to be one of the wealthiest individuals in modern history, alongside the early 20th century industrialists John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. The foundation of the family's wealth was created mainly by the textile trade with Italy. The company grew rapidly after the brothers Ulrich, Georg and Jakob began banking transactions with the House of Habsburg as well as the Roman Curia, and at the same time began mining operations in Tyrol, and from 1493 on the extraction of silver and copper in the kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary. As of 1525 they also had the right to mine quicksilver and cinnabar in Almad√©n. After 1487, Jakob Fugger was the de facto head of the Fugger business operations which soon had an almost monopolistic hold on the European copper market.Peter Geffcken: Fugger ‚Äì Geschichte einer Familie: \\"Die Handelsherren mit dem Dreizack\\". In: DAMALS 7/2004 Copper from Hungary was transported through Antwerp to Lisbon, and from there shipped to India. Jakob Fugger also contributed to the first and only trade expedition to India that German merchants cooperated in, a Portuguese fleet to the Indian west coast (1505/06) as well as a failed Spanish trade expedition to the Maluku Islands. With his support of the Habsburg dynasty as a banker he had a decisive influence on European politics at the time. He financed the rise of Maximilian I and made considerable contributions to secure the election of the Spanish king Charles I to become Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. Jakob Fugger also funded the marriages which later resulted in the House of Habsburg gaining the kingdoms of Bohemia and Hungary. Jakob Fugger secured his legacy and lasting fame through his foundations in Augsburg. A chapel funded by him and built from 1509 to 1512 is Germany's first renaissance building and contains the tombs of the brothers Ulrich, Georg and Jakob. The Fuggerei which was founded by Jakob in 1521 is the world's oldest social housing complex still in use. The Damenhof, part of the Fuggerh√§user in Augsburg, is the first secular renaissance building in Germany and was built in 1515. At his death on 30 December 1525, Jakob Fugger bequeathed to his nephew Anton Fugger company assets totaling 2,032,652 guilders. He is among the most well known Germans and arguably the most famous citizen of Augsburg, with his wealth earning him the moniker \\"Fugger the Rich\\". In 1967 a bust of him was placed in the Walhalla, a \\"hall of fame\\" near Regensburg that honors laudable and distinguished Germans.  Life = Background, education and early years in Venice = Coat of arms of the Fugger of the lily family, granted in 1473 Jakob Fugger was born the tenth of eleven children to Jakob Fugger the Elder (1398‚Äì1469) and his wife Barbara B√§singer (1419‚Äì1497), daughter of M√ºnzmeister Franz B√§singe. The Fugger family had already established themselves as successful merchants in the city. Hans Fugger, grandfather of Jacob Fugger the Rich had taken up residence in Augsburg in 1367, became a burgher through marriage and acquired considerable wealth by trading textiles with Italy. A few years before his death his son Jakob Fugger the Elder was already one of the richest citizens of Augsburg.H√§berlein 2006, p. 20-22 Jakob's older brothers Ulrich (1441‚Äì1510) and Georg (1453‚Äì1506) created the basis for the rise of the company in Europe. Around 1470 they founded manufactories in Venice and Nuremberg, then important centers of trade. Jakob Fugger's brothers Andreas and Hans both died young in Venice. His brother Markus was a cleric and from 1470 on a writer in a papal chancery in Rome where he died in 1478. His brother Peter died in an epidemic in Nuremberg in 1473.P√∂lnitz 1999, p. 44-46H√§berlein 2006, p. 34,35 Loans given to Emperor Frederick III and supplies given to his entourage by Ulrich Fugger were the reason for the family being granted the lily coat of arms in 1473.H√§berlein 2006, p. 26 The \\"of the lily\\" () naming after this coat of arms distinguishes this line of the Fugger family from the \\"of the doe\\" () branch. Until 2009 historians assumed that Jakob Fugger, who was a minor order at the age of 12, had lived as a canon in a church located in Herrieden. A document from the Austrian state archive has now shown that Jakob Fugger was already representing his family business in Venice in 1473 at the age of 14.Geffcken 2009, p. 15 Other research showed that Jakob Fugger spent the years between 1473 and 1487 mostly at the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, the house of German merchants in Venice. Venice being one of the most important centers of trade at the time proved to be an ideal environment for Jakob Fugger's education in banking and the metal trade.P√∂lnitz 2009, p. 32,33 His long residence in Italy also helped bring the renaissance style to the German region, with his funding the construction of the first buildings of this style that originated in Italy. Legal and architectural structures of Venice also had a significant influence on the funding of the Fuggerei which was similar to the social housing of Venice. = Beginnings of the mining and metal trade = Rich silver ore (Argentite) from Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica mines. Fugger and Jan Thurzo formed a powerful copper company in the neighbouring town of Bansk√° Bystrica in 1495. Jakob Fugger laid the foundation of his mining business in Salzburg. He provided loans to the independent silver mine owners in the Salzburg Slate Alps which had constant need for new capital. Instead of receiving the usual documents acknowledging debt he demanded \\"Kuxe\\", essentially becoming a shareholder in the mines, and through this forcing more and more mine operators in the area of Gastein and Schladming to sell their silver directly to the Fugger family instead of intermediary traders.Strieder 1931, p. 110-112 Jakob Fugger was responsible for his family's business in Augsburg, Tyrol, Venice and Rome. Around 1485 the family also founded manufactories in Innsbruck (since 1510 in Hall, since 1539 in Schwaz). Through a small loan he there first came into contact with Archduke Sigismund, a member of the Habsburg family. The archduke had as the sole owner of the Tyrol property rights handed out permissions for mining operations to private investors which in return had to pay a share of their profits to Sigismund. Despite this income he was constantly short of money owing to a lavish lifestyle, several illegitimate children and his extensive construction projects. A responsibility to pay the amount of 100,000 guilders of war reparations to Venice was eventually financed by Jakob Fugger. In 1488 the total debt already amounted to more than 150,000 guilders. Notable was the form of payment: Instead of paying the F√ºrst directly the Fugger family paid the money to his creditors as well as providing the wages for the royal court and craftsmen. In 1517 the Fugger family financed more than half of Tyrol's public budget. As a result, they were at times entitled to all the silver and copper out of Tyrol.Eike Eberhard Unger: Die Fugger in Hall i.T., T√ºbingen 1967 = Relationship with Maximilian I = Emperor Maximilian I., Albrecht D√ºrer (1519) The expansion of high-risk, albeit very lucrative business connections to Maximilian I was undoubtedly promoted by Jakob. In his view, the House of Habsburg was bound to be the dominant power and dynasty within the German region, and as such should receive his financial and political support. Jakob Fugger met the young Roman-German king for the first time in 1489 at a Frankfurt fair. At that time, his plans for the independent Duchy of Tyrol had been agreed upon with the king's chancellor, Johann Waldner. On 16 March 1490 Sigismund and the Tyrol Estates came together with King Maximilian also present. The archduke had to resign under the pressure from the estates, who accused him of mismanagement, and his possessions fell to the king. Maximilian then promised to repay all loans of its predecessor to Jakob Fugger.P√∂lnitz 1999, p. 60 Thus the Fugger business became one of the most important financial backers of Maximilian, who since 1486 was co-regent of the Holy Roman Empire. After his father Frederick III died in 1493 he became the reigning emperor. Despite having constant financial difficulties due to an extravagant lifestyle and many failed political projects his reign saw the kingdoms of Spain, Bohemia and Hungary gained for the House of Habsburg, not by waging war but through advantageous marriage arrangements which were funded with the help of Jakob Fugger. On 15 July 1507 Maximilian I sold the County of Kirchberg, located at Ulm, the adjacent lordship Wei√üenhorn with the associated city, as well as the lordships Wullenstetten and Pfaffenhofen(Roth) from the Habsburg possessions in Further Austria to Jakob Fugger.Sarah Hadry: Die Fugger in Kirchberg und Wei√üenhorn. Herrschaftsverfassung und Leibeigenschaft, Konfessionalisierung und Residenzbildung, Augsburg 2007 Maximilian I who crowned himself Holy Roman Emperor in 1508 received a payment of 50,000 guilders for these sales. More sales followed in 1508 where he sold manor Schmiechen and in 1514 where he sold the lordship Biberbach to Fugger. Maximilian I elevated Jakob Fugger into nobility in 1511 and granted him the title of Imperial Count in 1514 so the former burgher could operate his business without interference from local nobility.H√§berlein 2006, p. 188P√∂lnitz 1999, p. 112 In the course of his life Jakob Fugger also became lord of more than 50 smaller villages. Criticism from reformer Martin Luther on the Fugger business methods and novelistic portrayal from early research have led to the notion that Jakob Fugger exercised considerable power over Maximilian I the king and emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, while more recent research shows that this was only partially true.Mark H√§berlein: Die Fugger. Geschichte einer Augsburger Familie (1367‚Äì1650), Stuttgart 2006 However close to the end of his life Maximilian was so heavily indebted to Jakob Fugger that he had no choice but to continue his support for the emperor to still be able reclaim his outstanding debits. When Maximilian's grandson Charles V stood for election to become the next Emperor Jakob Fugger raised a sum of more than 500,000 guilders, a significant portion of his wealth and of the total amount raised in his support, to ensure the seven Prince-electors would choose him. Thereby he helped prevent the election of Francis I of France which would have endangered his claims and investments gravely, although it also made him highly dependent on the House of Habsburg. Much later the Fugger family lost a large portion of their wealth following three Spanish state bankruptcies (1557, 1560, 1575) under the reign of Philip II of Spain.H√§berlein 2006, p. 101P√∂lnitz 1999, p. 255 = Mining and metal trade = 10 Ducats (1621), minted as circulating currency by the Fugger Family. Schedel‚Äôsche Weltchronik (1493) Likely at the insistence of Jakob Fugger the company became one of the first open trading companies () in Europe in 1494. At the same time, it was renamed into \\"Ulrich Fugger of Augsburg and brothers\\" to show the equality of the three brothers involved in business issues, even though Tyrolean sources almost universally speak of the Jakob Fugger company and central contracts of the Hungarian trade were all signed by him. At this development the greatly increased influence of Jakob within the company can be observed. Since the late 1480s Jakob Fugger more and more dominated the company's policies, although the eldest brother Ulrich still formally led the company.Peter Geffcken: Jakob Fugger der Reiche (1459‚Äì1525): \\"K√∂nigsmacher\\", Stratege und Organisator\\". In: DAMALS 7/2004 The enormous growth potential in the mining and ore trade was very profitably harnessed by Jakob Fugger in the following years. As collateral for loans that he had given to the Habsburgs and the King of Hungary, he demanded mine revenues of Tyrol and the transfer of mining rights in Upper Hungary to him. Through this method he eventually established a dominant and almost monopolistic hold on the copper trade in Central Europe. With his business partner Hans Thurz√≥ he founded the Hungarian trade in 1494.P√∂lnitz 1999, p. 76 et seq. Mines funded by Fugger were constructed in Neusohl, at the time part of the Hungarian Kingdom. The expansion continued with the construction of smelting plants in Neusohl, Arnoldstein in Carinthia, Hohenkirchen in Thuringia and Moschnitz.H√§berlein 2006, p. 46 The copper was distributed through manufactories in Breslau, Leipzig, Krak√≥w and Ofen. For transportation to the ports of Gda≈Ñsk, Stettin, and L√ºbeck on the Baltic Sea Fugger funded the construction of a new road across the Jablunkov Pass. From those ports the copper was shipped to the Russian region and additionally through Antwerp to Lisbon where it was an important Portuguese trade good destined for the export to India.P√∂lnitz 1999, p. 291H√§berlein 2006, p. 80 Part of the copper was also transported through Wiener Neustadt and the Adriatic ports Triest and Zengg to the copper market in Venice. At the time mines from both Tyrol and Hungary provided the bulk of the total European production in copper which provided an incredibly advantageous position in the European market, albeit not a total monopoly.H√§berlein 2006, p. 46-48 = The Vatican as a client = Swiss Guard, 2009 The Fugger family were the first German trading house in a direct business relationship with the Roman Curia.Fugger ‚Äì Geschichte einer Familie: \\"Die Handelsherren mit dem Dreizack\\". In: DAMALS 7/2004 In the year 1500, Jakob Fugger loaned the Vatican the money necessary to build the new St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, as well as other buildings within the Vatican. To repay Jakob the massive amount of money owed, Pope Leo X had to heavily tax the German people as well as sell indulgences, which was heavily unpopular with a large group of monks, including Martin Luther. Because of the corruption within the church, Martin Luther was prompted to write his 95 Thesis. Following the death of Pope Alexander VI in August 1503 Jakob Fugger intensified his contacts to the Vatican in Rome. For the new Pope Julius II Fugger financed the recruitment of the Swiss Guard in 1505/1506, which still exists today. Early dealings in Rome are attributed to the cleric Markus Fugger in 1473. In 1477 the Fugger business was responsible for transferring church revenues from Sweden to Rome. Between 1508 and 1524, the company leased the Roman mint, the Zecca, manufacturing 66 types of coins for four different popes. After this the Fugger family was only represented by one manufactory in Rome, mostly due to the \\"Sacco di Roma\\" and the less German-friendly Medici Pope Clement VII.H√§berlein 2006, p. 50 = Overseas trade = The commodity trade played a relatively small role compared to the two main branches of the Fugger business, banking and mining. It is only because of the associated exotic investments that Jakob Fugger's early trading expeditions take a prominent place in the history of the Fugger business. After Vasco da Gama's discovery of the sea route to India and the establishment of the Portuguese spice monopoly, Jakob Fugger took part in the spice trade and in 1503 opened a manufactory in Lisbon. He received permission to trade pepper, other spices, and luxury goods such as pearls and gemstones through Lisbon. Along with other merchant houses of Germany and Italy he contributed to a fleet of 22 Portuguese ships led by Francisco de Almeida that sailed to India in the year 1505 and returned in 1506. Even though one third of the imported wares had to be ceded to the King of Portugal the operation still made significant profit. Soon afterwards the King declared the spice trade a monopoly of the crown in order to secure his income and exclude foreign merchants from participating. However, the Portuguese were still largely dependent on the copper delivered by Fugger which was an essential export good for the trade with India. Unlike the Welser family, Jakob Fugger's participation in the overseas trade was very cautious and conservative, and the only other operation of this kind he invested in was a failed trade expedition to the Maluku Islands led by the Spaniard Garcia de Loaisa.H√§berlein 2006, p. 66 There is some evidence that he financed Magellan's famed voyage. = The great crisis of Jakob Fugger = Especially for mining projects in upper Hungary the Fugger company required enormous capital, which at the time it could not raise. Hence Cardinal Melchior von Meckau was the main sponsor of the Fugger business in 1496. The Prince-Bishop had secretly and unknown to his church chapter invested 150,000 guilders into the Fugger company in return for interest, thereby evading the official church ban on interest.P√∂lnitz 1999, p. 79 et seq. When he died in Rome in 1509 this investment was uncovered. The Pope, the bishopric Brixen and the family of Meckau all claiming the inheritance now demanded the immediate payback of these assets which would have resulted in insolvency for Jakob Fugger. It was this situation that prompted Emperor Maximilian I to step in and assist his banker. On the condition of assisting Pope Julius II in a war against the Republic of Venice the Habsburg monarch was recognized as being the rightful heir of Cardinal Melchior von Meckau. The inheritance could now be settled by amortizing outstanding debts. Fugger also had to deliver jewels as compensation to the Pope. However, in return for his support, Maximilian I demanded the continuous financial support of his ongoing military and political campaigns.H√§berlein 2006, p. 61-63. Since the death of his brothers Georg in 1506 and Ulrich in 1510, Jakob Fugger was now running the Fugger business as the sole policy and decision maker. The company was renamed into \\"Jakob Fugger und Gebr√ºder S√∂hne\\" (Jakob Fugger and Brothers Sons). In the following years up until his death Jakob Fugger managed to raise the family fortune which amounted to about 200,000 guilders in 1511 to more than 2,000,000 guilders, perhaps 2% of Europe's GDP.Richard Ehrenberg: Das Zeitalter der Fugger, Geldkapital und Creditverkehr im 16. Jahrhundert (2 Bde), Jena 1896 = Election of Charles V in 1519 = Portrait of Charles V, Bernard van Orley (1519 to 1520) Emperor Maximilian died in January 1519 and bequeathed to his grandson Carlos I the hereditary lands of House Habsburg with adjoining Burgundian lands as well as a disputed claim to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. To secure his essential investments into House Habsburg Jakob Fugger decided to support the election of the 19-year-old claimant to the throne. In addition to Carlos I, the English King Henry VIII, the French King Francois I and Frederick III, Elector of Saxony announced their candidacy. Francois I had already secured the votes of the Archdiocese of Trier and the Electorate of the Palatinate as well as offering a sum of 300,000 guilders of election money. The Prince-electors consisted of the three archbishops of Mainz, Cologne and Trier in addition to the King of Bohemia, the Elector of the Palatinate, the Margrave of Brandenburg and the Duke of Saxony. This was a difficult situation for Carlos I who now relied on the riches of Jakob Fugger to sway the election in his favor. Fugger transferred the enormous sum of more than 850,000 guilders to the Prince-electors which ultimately resulted in the unanimous election of Carlos I as Holy Roman Emperor on 28 July 1519. Out of this 850,000 guilders Fugger himself funded around 550,000 while another merchant house of Augsburg, the Welser family, contributed about 150,000 and three Italian bankers providing the rest. What today would be seen as bribery was common practice in the election of the Emperor. Exceptional however was the immense sums involved, mainly due to the keen competition among the princely candidates.Strieder 1931, p. 151 A few days later the Pope granted Carlos I, now Charles V, the right to name himself Elected Emperor. It was only in 1530 that Charles V was crowned Emperor by the Pope in Bologna. He was the last Emperor to receive a papal coronation.Maltby, William, The Reign of Charles V, St. Martin's Press, 2002 Charles V, since his election reigning over a realm where the sun never set, was now deeply indebted to Jakob Fugger. In 1521 the debts amounted to more than 600,000 guilders. The Emperor amortized 415,000 of this sum and in return granted the Fugger company the silver and copper mining operations of Tyrol. During the Imperial Diet of 1523 in Nuremberg it was debated whether to restrict trade capital and the number of trade establishments companies were allowed to maintain. Jakob Fugger intervened and reminded the Emperor that \\"It is known that your imperial majesty could not have claimed the Roman crown without my help,...\\" ()Franz Herre: Die Fugger in ihrer Zeit, Augsburg, 2000 The added demand of repayment of all debts eventually led to all discussions of trade restrictions and limits to monopolies being dropped. In addition to this Jakob Fugger was granted a concession to mine quicksilver and cinnabar in Almad√©n. The Fugger company was involved in the Spanish mining business up to the year 1645.P√∂lnitz 1999, p. 320,321  Marriage, heritage and successors  Portrait of Jakob Fugger and Sibylle Artzt, around 1500 Jakob Fugger and Sybille Artzt, Miniature in the Ehrenbuch of the Fugger family, Augsburg, Workshop J√∂rg Breu der J√ºngere, 1545-1549 In 1498 the 40-year-old Jakob Fugger married Sybille Arzt (also: Artzt) Grand Burgheress of Augsburg, the 18-year-old daughter of an eminent Augsburg Grand Burgher. This marriage opened the opportunity for Jakob to elevate to Grand Burgher of Augsburg (German Gro√üb√ºrger zu Augsburg) and later finally giving Jakob Fugger the long-awaited aspiration of a seat on the city council (German Stadtrat) of Augsburg. Four years after the wedding, Jakob Fugger bought for his young wife 40,000 guilders worth of jewels from the treasure of Burgundy, among them the jewel known as the Three Brothers, which the Fuggers later sold to Edward VI of England to become part of the Crown Jewels of England. Jakob wanted to demonstrate that he was after all equal to the Habsburgs, at least financially. However the jewels were left in a chest in the basement of his house for fear of theft and envy. The couple had no children. Seven weeks after her husband died Sybille Arzt married a business partner of Jakob and converted to the Protestant faith.Barbara G√ºnther: Sybille Fugger, die Frau Jakobs des Reichen., 1985 Jakob Fugger died on 30 December 1525. The inventory performed by his heirs revealed assets totaling 3,000,058 guilders and liabilities amounting to 867,797 guilders resulting in a surplus of 2,132,261 guilders.Richard Ehrenberg: Das Zeitalter der Fugger, Geldkapital und Creditverkehr im 16. Jahrhundert (2 Bde), Jena 1896 Because he had no direct descendants, the company and its assets were bequeathed to his nephews Raymund and Anton Fugger, who also led the company. Anton managed to double the family's fortune once more by 1546.H√§berlein 2006, p. 67,68  Religious views Fugger was a lifelong Roman Catholic. According to Stein,Negotiating the French Pox in Early Modern Germany by Claudia Stein Fugger insisted that only Catholic inhabitants should \\"find care and cure\\" in the Fuggerei. As the Reformation progressed, the complex found itself located in an increasingly Protestant city of Augsburg. The Fugger family financed the rise to power of the House of Habsburg, who would play a prominent role in the Counterreformation.  Foundations and buildings of Jakob Fugger = Fugger chapel in the Annakirche = The Fugger chapel in the Annakirche, Augsburg, 2007 Together with his brother Ulrich and on behalf of his deceased brother Georg, Jakob Fugger founded the Fugger chapel in the Carmelite monastery's St. Anna church located in Augsburg. It also became the burial place of the three brothers. Construction began in 1509 and was finished in 1512. The chapel was modeled after Italian burial chapels with clear influences out of Venice and Rome, thereby becoming Germany's first renaissance construction. The interior was designed with the help of many notable German artists of the time, such as Albrecht D√ºrer, Hans Burgkmair, J√∂rg Breu the Elder and Hans Daucher. The church later became Protestant which is why only two other members of the Fugger family are buried there. The building is thought to have been built in preparation for Fugger's elevation into nobility and to distance himself from the local Patricians. Furthermore, it was a medium to preserve the name and memory of Fugger in the style of the Italian \\"Memoria\\" architecture.Benjamin Scheller: Memoria an der Zeitenwende. Die Stiftungen Jakob Fuggers des Reichen vor und w√§hrend der Reformation (ca. 1505‚Äì1555), Berlin 2004 = Fuggerh√§user in Augsburg = Damenhof in the Fuggerh√§user in Augsburg. The Fugger family already owned two houses in Augsburg in prominent locations when Jakob Fugger built the Fuggerh√§user near the wine-market (now Maximilianstra√üe) from 1512 to 1515. Builder of this Residence was most likely Hans Hiebe. Inside the Fuggerh√§user, the Damenhof (Ladies courtyard) was modeled after the florencian style grand courtyards, thus becoming Germany's first secular renaissance building. The complex was expanded once more in 1523 to accommodate the receiving of illustrious guests. The Fuggerh√§user were the private residence and administrative center of Jakob Fugger and his wife Sybille Fugger- Arzt.H√§berlein 2006, p. 143-145 Later members of the Fugger family enlarged the complex several times. The complex was mostly destroyed during air raids on Augsburg in World War II and rebuilt in a simplified way in 1955. The courtyards and several other rooms however are still in their original state. The houses are still owned by the Fugger family, partly being used to house the F√ºrst Fugger Privatbank. = St.-Moritz-Pr√§dikatur-Stiftung = In 1515 Jakob Fugger advocated for an improved sermon in the church of his parish St. Moritz. In 1517 Pope Leo X issued a papal bull granting Fugger and his heirs the Patronage to the church and being able to choose the priest. The foundation still exists and the Fugger family still recommends the priest. = Fuggerei = View into the Herrengasse of the Fuggerei. Beginning in 1516 Jakob Fugger funded the construction of a settlement for craftsmen and day laborers in need. In 1523 52 houses of the estate were built. It was first named Fuggerei in 1531. Originally it was meant to house people who were in a difficult situation through no fault of their own until they could establish stable household on their own. The yearly rent was one symbolic guilder, though additionally requested were three daily prayers in the name of Fugger and his family. The settlement was expanded several times, lastly in 1973. About 150 people live in the Fuggerei today, still paying an annual rent of the equivalent of one guilder (0.88 ‚Ç¨). The Fuggerei is a major tourist attraction of Augsburg and since 2006 also houses a museum. The settlement is still administered by the descendants of the Fugger family and financed through a foundation (originally from 1521). = Other foundations and buildings = Jakob Fugger made several contributions to churches and monasteries in Augsburg some of which still show the Fugger coat of arms. He funded the church San Blas in Almagro, Spain and the reconstruction of the Santa Maria dell‚ÄôAnima in Rome.Norbert Lieb: Die Fugger und die Kunst.

The passengers, who had traveled from Kigali in Rwanda, were robbed of their valuables and then separated according to their ethnicity. Hutus and most Congolese were released unharmed. The Tutsis on board, and one British woman, Charlotte Wilson, who was traveling with her Burundian fianc√©, were forced to lie face down on the ground and then shot. According to news reports, one of the Hutu passengers had been told to \\"tell the army we're going to kill them all and there's nothing you can do.\\" The attack took place in the province of Bujumbura Rural, a stronghold of the Hutu-extremist group Palipehutu-FNL (commonly known as FNL). The group is known for its hostility to the Tutsi ethnic group, and is believed to have carried out dozens of similar attacks in the same area. Although the FNL has denied responsibility for the \\"Titanic Express\\" attack, the Burundian authorities and a number of human rights groups have publicly blamed them for the massacre. In May 2001, the International Crisis Group attributed the Titanic Express attack to \\"troops under the order of... Agathon Rwasa\\". In January 2004, the Sunday Times announced the discovery of a document which appears to be an FNL report, signed by a senior commander, detailing how the Titanic Express massacre was carried out. In June 2006, detailed eyewitness accounts of the attack were published in the book Titanic Express: Finding Answers in the Aftermath of Terror, by Richard Wilson, the brother of Charlotte Wilson.

In a typical colorimetric gas detector tube a known volume of air is pumped through a tube using a pump. The tube typically has a layer which indicates the analyte by changing colour, depending on the amount of the gas which has passed through the tube the length of the zone which has changed colour will be different. Today colorimetric gas detector tubes are used throughout industry as a low-cost and easy-to-use tool for detecting the presence of gases and are available from a wide range of manufacturers. An early limitation of detector tubes is that they were designed to detect a single known gas or vapor. Advancements in the design and capability of detector tubes came with the introduction of such tools as the HazMat kit. The specialty kits are designed for use by hazardous material response teams in determining what gases or vapors are present through using a \\"stack\\" of colorimetric material that change color based upon the presence of an organic or inorganic gas. = Alcohol Screening Kits = Dr√§ger developed their first Alcohol screening kit in 1953 when some employees came into work hungover following a party the night before. It was originally developed using silicon crystals, where a breath sample was passed through these silicon crystals, if there was alcohol in this breath sample, a chemical reaction would occur resulting in the crystals changing colour. This particular method is still used today to create \\"single use breathalyzers.\\" Dr√§ger's first digital display Alcohol Screening Kit was developed in 1980. Later they developed a breathalyzer that uses a fuel sensor. Many of Dr√§gers breathalyzers have home office approval, which means they can be used by the police in a variety of countries, including the UK. Diving equipment Dr√§ger three-bolt bubikopf helmet in use for surface supplied diving Helmeted diver entering the water. He has a back mounted Draeger DM40 rebreather system in addition to the surface supply air hose hand pump (presented on picture without handles) made for divers in standard diving dress by Dr√§gerwerk AG In 1912 Dr√§gerwerk developed standard diving dress which did not need surface supplied breathing gas via a diver's umbilical, as it used a self contained gas supply came from a rebreather. Two versions were available, one for oxygen to 20 metres, and the other for nitrox to 40 metres. The semi-closed circuit used the injected gas to circulate the gas in the helmet through a scrubber, providing a very low work of breathing in comparison with most other rebreathers which used the lungs of the diver to circulate gas in the loop. The bubikopf helmet was designed for use with this system. The rebreather loop hoses connected to the back of the helmet below the overhanging part, and led from there to the back- mounted scrubber. Since 1941 Hans Hass used bag-on-back rebreathers for scuba diving, originally built by Dr√§ger for self-rescue of submarine crews (Tauchretter; like the Davis Escape Set). The first Dr√§ger-Tauchretter had been built in 1907. In 1926 the Bade-Tauchretter was brought into service for rescuing drowning swimmers. Dr√§ger manufactured the popular Atlantis, Ray and Dolphin line of sport diving semi-closed-circuit nitrox rebreathers. It also makes the LAR-5 and LAR-6 military oxygen rebreathers, and the LAV-7 military rebreather which is switchable between closed-circuit and semi-closed- circuit.Images. = Atlantis/Dolphin = Partially assembled Dr√§ger Dolphin The Dr√§ger Dolphin, originally Atlantis is a semi-closed circuit nitrox rebreather for recreational diving using a constant mass flow injection system. = Ray = High altitude breathing equipment  Dr√§ger made the high-altitude oxygen sets used by the 1952 Swiss Mount Everest expedition (the second (autumn) expedition), and John Hunt was able to have adaptors made so that the 1953 British expedition could use oxygen from tanks the Swiss had left behind, particularly for their bottled oxygen \\"sleeping sets\\".

The dynasty was founded by the rebbe Rabbi Chaim Halberstam (1793-1876) who was the rabbi of Nowy SƒÖcz and the author of the work Divrei Chaim by which name he is known as well. Rabbi Chaim was a disciple of Rabbi Naftali Zvi of Ropshitz. He opened his court after the death of Rabbi Asher Yeshaya of Ropshitz, son-in-law of Rabbi Naftali Tzvi. After his demise (25 Nisan 5636, 19 April 1876), his six sons and his seven sons-in-law built courtyards with new names in the cities where they served as rabbis, and their chassidim separated, but most of them went to his eldest son, Rabbi Yechezkel Shraga Halberstam of Shinova. His fourth son, Rabbi Aharon, remained to serve as rabbi and rebbe in Sanz, but he was known as the 'Rav of Kreiz', that is, the rabbi of the province, a title he already had in his father's life.

Her keel was laid down on 28 June 1939 by the Norfolk Navy Yard in Portsmouth, Virginia. She was launched on 24 August 1940 sponsored by Miss Elizabeth Scott Baker, and commissioned on 11 November 1940. Service history=1940-1945 World War II= Following shakedown, Raven was assigned to Mine Division 21 and operated out of Norfolk, Virginia, engaged in training, patrol, and escort of ships to and from port until 14 March 1941. She then escorted a convoy to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and several convoys between Norfolk and Newport, Rhode Island. She resumed local operations out of Norfolk from 23 July 1941 to April 1942. In April 1942, serving as antisubmarine screen, she made runs to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Portland, Maine. She then extended her range to the Panama Canal Zone, and on her return resumed coastal escort runs to Boston, Massachusetts, Portland, Maine, and Sydney, Nova Scotia. Returning to Norfolk 8 July, she made three escort runs to Bermuda, then, in September, operated off the coast of New England and the Maritime Provinces. Back at Norfolk at the end of September, Raven departed Chesapeake Bay on 23 October in company with other U.S. warships and a convoy and proceeded to North Africa. Arriving on 8 November 1942, she participated in sweeping, antisubmarine, antiaircraft, and landing operations in support of the invasion of Morocco, continuing those duties until 21 February 1943. Raven then departed African waters in the escorting screen of a Norfolk-bound convoy. Arriving 14 March she conducted local patrol, coastwise and Caribbean Sea escort operations until April 1944. Raven then departed Norfolk, and proceeded with other U.S. warships and a convoy to England to prepare for the invasion of France. On 5 June Raven proceeded to her assigned area off Normandy and participated in the sweep of the fire control area for Utah Beach. From this time until August she was active in clearing approach channels to the Normandy beachheads. In August 1944 she sailed to Oran, thence to Naples, Italy. From then until June 1945 she performed sweeping and patrol duty in the Straits of Bonifacio, clearing the way for ships en route to the invasion of southern France, and sweeping off the French Riviera and Italian Riviera and off Corsica. During the entire European operation, including D-Day, Raven swept 21 German and Italian naval mines. =1945-1967 Decommissioning, reclassification and disposal= In June 1945, Raven returned to Norfolk, and after overhaul, departed Norfolk 1 October 1945 and proceeded to San Pedro, California, where she remained through November. She arrived at Portland, Oregon, on 1 December, but returned to San Diego, California, by the end of the month. On 31 May 1946 Raven was decommissioned and placed in reserve at San Diego. Reclassified MSF-55, 7 February 1955, she remained berthed at San Diego until struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 May 1967. Later that year she was sunk as a target in deep water off the coast of southern California. Honours Raven earned three battle stars for World War II service.

The US Navy renamed her after the \\"airy and playful spirit\\" Ariel in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. The ship was returned to United Fruit in 1946 and operated for that company until sold to a German company in 1957. Building and pre-war service The Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Newport News, Virginia built the ship as SS Peten for United Fruit Company's United Mail Steamship Co subsidiary. Peten was one of six UFC sister ships with General Electric turbo-electric transmission, the others being and from Newport News Shipbuilding and , and from Bethlehem Shipbuilding's Quincy, Massachusetts, plant, built under the Merchant Marine Act of 1928. The prospective name for the ship had been Segovia, hull #345, but that hull had been burned at the outfitting pier as it neared completion in 1931 and was rebuilt as hull #354 with the new name of Peten. Peten's keel was laid 9 March 1931 with launch on 15 August 1931 and delivery on 24 February 1933. On 2 March 1933 Peten made her maiden voyage from New York to Caribbean ports. In 1937 she was transferred to United Fruit's direct ownership and renamed Jamaica. The ship's peacetime service was in carrying fruit, passengers and mail on regular liner services between Central America and the USA. US Navy service Jamaica was delivered to the War Shipping Administration (WSA) on 24 March 1942 at New Orleans with allocation to the Navy under bareboat charter. Todd Pacific Shipyards of Galveston, Texas converted her for Navy use. She was renamed USS Ariel and commissioned at Galveston on 14 May 1942, commanded by Captain E.P. Hylant. On 25 May Ariel sailed for Norfolk, Virginia. On arrival she assumed duty with Service Squadron 7, Service Force, Atlantic Fleet. In the next 18 months Ariel operated along the east coast and made numerous voyages to ports in the Caribbean. Among her stops were Bermuda; Trinidad; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Havana and Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. This routine was interrupted by a voyage to Iceland in 1943. She left New York City on 15 August and sailed to NS Argentia, Newfoundland before continuing on to Iceland and reaching Reykjav√≠k on 24 August. After unloading her cargo she returned to the east coast, arrived back at New York City on 7 September, and resumed her supply service to the Caribbean. On 4 January 1944 the store ship left Norfolk, with a convoy bound for the Mediterranean Sea. She called at Algiers, Algeria on 24 January and soon sailed for Naples, Italy, where she unloaded supplies. She then sailed east and called at Oran, Algeria, in early February before sailing back to the United States. The ship arrived at New York City on 13 February. Ariel sailed for the Caribbean on 20 February and called at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, to unload. She then returned to New York. In late March, she commenced another voyage to Iceland and arrived back at New York on 10 April. After a few weeks of upkeep, Ariel sailed for the United Kingdom. On arrival she provided food and supplies to ships preparing for the cross-channel Invasion of Normandy. She operated from the ports of Clyde, Scotland; Belfast, Northern Ireland; and Plymouth and Portland Harbour, England. She left England on D-Day, 6 June, and returned to the United States. Ariel reached New York on 16 June. After a fortnight of leave and upkeep she sailed to Norfolk. On 1 July she set out across the Atlantic to resupply Mediterranean ports. She unloaded stores and equipment at Oran and Naples before returning to the United States via a stop in the Azores, reaching New York on 3 August. After a week in New York, Ariel made a round trip to supply Guantanamo Bay and Trinidad. In September she made a round trip from New York to Bermuda. On 20 September she sailed from Norfolk, VA to Oran and Naples. Her return voyage was to New York, where she arrived on 23 October. From there she took supplies to San Juan and Guantanamo Bay. In early November she returned to Norfolk for servicing. She returned to duty on 10 December, sailing laden for Oran and Naples. She returned to Norfolk on 6 February 1945. Later that month she made another round trip to Oran. In March Ariel left New York for San Juan, Puerto Rico. She returned to the east coast and put into Boston, Massachusetts, on 12 April. From there she took a cargo to Argentia and arrived back at Boston in late April. She then took a cargo to Bermuda. She continued her supply runs to Caribbean ports from New York, Norfolk, and Boston until 1946. On 12 May 1946 Ariel left New York for a final voyage via Argentia, Newfoundland to Reykjav√≠k, where she docked on 29 May and unloaded. She left for New York on 1 June, arrived a week later, and entered New York Naval Shipyard for decommissioning. On 21 June 1946 Ariel was decommissioned at New York and transferred to the War Shipping Administration. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 3 July 1946. She was returned to former owner, the United Fruit Company, under charter under her pre-war name Jamaica until redelivered to the owners 9 December 1947. Post-war service Jamaica returned to liner work for United Fruit but later was sold to new owners. In April 1957 the ship was converted to a refrigerator type. Jamaica was sold in December 1957 to Union-Partenreederei T/S of Bremen, Germany, which also acquired her United Fruit sister ship Chiriqui. Union-Partenreederei changed Jamaicas name to D/S Blumenthal. She was scrapped in 1969 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

It was founded in 1952 as the Esperanto League for North America (ELNA) in Sacramento, California. Headquartered in Emeryville, California, Esperanto-USA is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and the U.S. affiliate of the Universal Esperanto Association. Phil Dorcas is President of E-USA, and Ben Speakmon is Vice-President. The organization administers the largest Esperanto-language book service in the Americas. It publishes a bimonthly bulletin Usona Esperantisto. It also publishes reference works about Esperanto. The organization's leadership consists of a president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, and nine directors; it also has many commissioners responsible for Esperanto-USA's activity in various connections (e.g. audio-visual service; cooperation with libraries; relations with local Esperanto clubs; etc.) Membership is about 650. The youth section of E-USA is USEJ (Usona Esperantista Junularo). History During the first half of the 20th century, the chief Esperanto organization for the U.S. was the Esperanto Association of North America (EANA). In the early 1950s, the early days of the Cold War, EANA's president, George Allen Connor, a fierce anti-Communist, had begun his own McCarthyist attacks against leaders of the Esperanto movement in Europe and Asia. The Universal Esperanto Association (UEA) began debating whether to expel Connor, who also held a position in UEA's leadership, and also to break off relations with EANA, which was UEA's US national association. In protest against EANA, American Esperantists founded the Esperanto League for North America. Three years later, UEA recognized ELNA as its American section, and subsequently severed ties with EANA. By then, most EANA members had gone over to ELNA. EANA was quickly rendered insignificant, and had disappeared by the 1970s. In 2007, the members of the organization voted to adopt the name Esperanto-USA as an alias, while retaining the formal, official name Esperanto League for North America (Esperanto-Ligo por Norda Ameriko in Esperanto). Among other reasons, the change was made because the organization's scope is limited to the U.S., despite the North America in its original title. E-USA still uses its original acronym, ELNA, but only occasionally. E-USA has held an annual convention (called a \\"congress\\" in accordance with Esperanto movement usage) every year since 1953, usually in the United States but occasionally in Canada or Mexico (meeting jointly with the Canadian Esperanto Association or the Mexican Esperanto Federation, respectively). The 2010 conference of E-USA took place in Bethesda, Maryland. The 2011 conference was in Emeryville, California, the 2012 conference in Dallas, Texas, the 2015 conference in Detroit, Michigan, the 2016 conference in Miami, Florida, and the 2013 and 2017 conferences in Raleigh, North Carolina. The 2018 conference occurred in Seattle, Washington, with the 2019 conference scheduled to occur in Boston, Massachusetts. Notable speakers have included Humphrey Tonkin, Katalin Kovats, and Duncan Charters.

A lunging cavesson is a piece of equipment used when longeing a horse. A lunging cavesson consists of a heavy, padded noseband, metal rings to attach the lunge line, a throatlatch, and sometimes additional straps such as a jowl strap or a browband for added stability. It is placed on the horse's head in a manner somewhat akin to a halter, but provides significantly more control than a halter, without placing pressure on the horse's mouth as a bridle would. The noseband should be just below the cheekbone, several inches above the nostrils sitting on the nasal bone, and fitted snugly. The jowl strap should be very snug to prevent the cavesson from slipping into the horse's eye. The key feature of a lunging cavesson is the strategic placement of rings for varying places to attach the lunge line: one at the top of the nasal bone and one each side of the noseband. Many other types of headgear may be used for lunging, but the lunging cavesson is most commonly associated with dressage and related training methods and is designed to allow more subtle communication between handler and horse. A lunging cavesson may be used with a snaffle bridle. The cavesson is put on under the bridle, with the noseband of the cavesson under the bridle cheekpieces. On some horses, the bridle cheekpieces may need to be lengthened to allow this. If the bridle also has its own cavesson, it may need to be removed to reduce bulk and avoid interference with other components.

He was well known for his songs about the city of Amsterdam, especially the Jordaan district (the genre dedicated to the neighborhood is known as the Jordaanlied), which he sang in a typical \\"hiccuping Mokum vibrato\\",Hart 73. \\"Mokum\\" being the Hebrew-derived nickname for the Amsterdam inner city area. In the 1950s, Johnny Jordaan rose almost instantly to the level of national celebrity and became the \\"uncrowned king of the Jordaanlied\\", and his hit song \\"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\\" is one of the songs Amsterdammers identify with most. Biography Jordaan was born the son of a roofer, and grew up within sight of the Westertoren, on the corner of the Lijnbaansgracht and the Rozengracht, the edge of the Jordaan‚Äîby then an impoverished working-class neighborhood. He was the oldest of two brothers in a Roman Catholic workers' family. He started singing in the streets at age 8, with his cousin Carel Verbrugge (Willy Alberti), to help provide for his family. He lost an eye during a fight with Verbrugge, at age 9. He started using the name \\"Johnny Jordaan\\" when he was 14, and after vocational school began working various odd jobs and singing in bars. Despite already having discovered his homosexuality, he married in 1943. After the Second World War, he got a steady job as a singer in the Amsterdam caf√© De Kuil.Frijhoff et al. 525. =Breakthrough= In 1955, he won a singing competition, the \\"Jordaan festival\\",Hart 27‚Äì28. organized by the record company Bovema in collaboration with singer and composer Louis Noiret; the aim was to find the best voices from the Jordaan. His lifelong friend Tante Leen, a notable Jordaan singer in her own right, finished second in the same competition. His first single contained two Noiret compositions, \\"De Parel van de Jordaan\\" and \\"Bij ons in de Jordaan\\". After being played on an AVRO radio program the single was an instant hit record, propelling Johnny and his Jordaan to national fame‚Äîthe entire neighborhood, which had been poor and deprived since the 19th century, suddenly became popular due to the success of Johnny Jordaan and others. Cabaret artist and historian Jacques Kl√∂ters referred to 1955 as \\"the year of Johnny Jordaan\\": he sold hundreds of thousands of records within months, got to perform in the Concertgebouw with Tante Leen, and helped popularize the \\"uncivilized\\" Jordaan dialect.Kl√∂ters 654. Johnny's own celebrity was made apparent in 1956, when he and his wife celebrated their wedding anniversary by being driven through the Jordaan in a carriage and singing in front of a crowd of 30,000 people: the Polygoon newsreel includes it among the most important events of the year. In the pillarized world of the Netherlands of the 1950s and 1960s, commercial success (\\"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\\" sold over a million copies) did not mean receiving airplay with all broadcasting organizations‚Äîthe socialist VARA, for instance, boycotted his music since it was too low-brow. =Later career= Financial mismanagement brought him financial ruin; a Jordaan-themed cabaret in Scheveningen was a flop, and a caf√© he opened in Rotterdam in 1962 had to close due to tax debts. He avoided the tax man by leaving for Antwerp to start a caf√© there, but longing for Amsterdam got the better of him and in 1968 he returned, with the help of Tante Leen‚Äîthough he didn't move to Amsterdam immediately but rather to Beverwijk first, where he lived with his partner, Ton Slierendrecht, before moving to Amsterdam's Staatsliedenbuurt. The record company paid off his debt and Harry de Groot wrote a new song for him, \\"'n Pikketanussie\\", a hit song which reinvigorated his career. =Farewell= His health had always been frail, and in the early 1970s he suffered further hemorrhages and a number of heart attacks. His farewell to his audience was a 1972 television show in collaboration with Tante Leen, Willy Alberti, Ramses Shaffy, Zwarte Riek, Harry de Groot, and songwriter Pi V√®riss. He did occasional shows afterwards and died at age 64, on 8 January 1989. His burial service in the Westerkerk, on 15 January, was attended by a thousand people, including many notables; thousands more crowded the surrounding area and paid their respects. National newspapers noted that many of the visitors were not usual churchgoers, and commented that Johnny had remained a singer of the people.Hart 28‚Äì30. He is buried in the family grave at Vredenhof cemetery. Personal life Jordaan had married Jannetje \\"Totty\\" de Graaff in 1943 and the couple had a daughter, but he had spent most of his adult life repressing his homosexual feelings. After an affair with a man, he attempted suicide. His homosexuality, a well-known secret, shocked the nation. Since the late 1950s he had a male partner, Ton Slierendrecht; he finally got a divorce from Totty in 1982 to enter a legal union with Slierendrecht.

Photo by Nils Emmink, Amsterdam. =Iconic songs, discography= Jordaan's best-known songs are \\"Bij ons in de Jordaan\\" (\\"Among us in the Jordaan\\"), which celebrates the lively culture of the neighborhood, and \\"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\\" (\\"I prefer Amsterdam\\"), written by Pi V√®riss, which praises the city as preferable over any other, including Paris: \\"Liever in Mokum zonder poen dan in Parijs met een miljoen\\" (\\"I'd rather be penniless in Mokum than a millionaire in Paris\\"). His songs, especially \\"Geef mij maar Amsterdam\\", stand for the city in an emblematic way, and continue to be played at Amsterdam festivities‚Äîsuch as the 2013 championship of Ajax. For some, Amsterdam means Johnny Jordaan. Tante Leen's homage (and her greatest hit) is a song called \\"Oh, Johnny\\"; a version she recorded with him was included on a Tante Leen collection released in 2007 (15 years after her death). Ironically, this song was written by Jaap Valkhoff, who was a famous singer-songwriter from Amsterdam's rival city of Rotterdam. =Honors and media= The Johnny Jordaanplein (\\"Johnny Jordaan Square\\"), off the Elandsgracht in the Jordaan, is named for him; the square contains statues of Jordaan and Tante Leen, and of Jordaan's regular accordionist Johnny Meijer.Gold 21. Since he had lived the last few years of his life in the Staatsliedenbuurt (to the west of the Jordaan), that neighborhood also vied for a square named for him; the singer had really no connection to the Elandsgracht at all, though was engaged in the Edison theater there for a month in 1957. A 1990 benefit concert in the Carr√© Theatre paid for a bust, which was placed on a parking lot in 1991 off the Elandsgracht. The dispute was fought out in the neighborhoods' newspapers; in the end the Jordaan won out.Hart 31‚Äì32.

The first Johnny Jordaan DVD, released in 2005 and also called Bij ons in de Jordaan, entered the DVD music charts at No. 1.Hart 30. The DVD had been compiled by Peter Pols, a lifelong fan of Johnny and later his chauffeur and friend; Pols (Amsterdam, 1948‚Äì2009) collected everything related to Johnny and after his death donated his collection to the Amsterdam City Archives.

He was highly influential in Syrian politics from the beginning of the 1940s until his departure into exile in 1963. Al-Hourani held various positions including a government ministry and the joint vice- presidency of the United Arab Republic. He is the grandfather of Akram Al- Hourani (1983), a lecturer and researcher in wireless network engineering and signal processing at RMIT University in Australia. Background prophet Muhammad. It is now displayed in the museum of Hama. Al-Hourani's family had its origins in the Arab al-Halqiyyin tribe and moved to Hama in central Syria from the town of Jasim in the southern Hawran region (hence the surname Al- Hourani.)Batatu, 1999, p. 370. Al-Hourani family is claimed to be descendant of the prophet Muhammad as per the family tree displayed in the museum of Hama. Akram Al-Hourani himself was born in Hama and grew up in modest circumstances as the family's wealth had dissipated. He was educated in Hama and Damascus. In 1936, he enrolled in the Damascus Law School, and became a member of the Syrian Social National Party. In 1938 he left the party and returned to Hama to practice law. There he took over the Hizb al-Shabab (Youth Party) founded by a cousin. The province of Hama in the earlier part of the twentieth century was characterised by feudalism, with landlords owning most of the land. The landlords exercised complete control over the peasantry, backed up by what amounted to private armies. Al-Hourani set about attacking this system and called for agrarian reforms, giving him considerable popular support in Hama and its province, and in 1943 he was elected as a deputy to the Syrian Parliament. He retained his seat in the elections of 1947, 1949, 1954, and 1962. While it was in defence of social justice in his home region that Al-Hourani made his name, he also had a strong Arab nationalist outlook.This section is based on the account of Hawrani's origins and early political career given by Batatu, pp. 728-729. A reconstructed digital copy of Al-Hourani family tree, the original document is dated back to 1519 and displayed in Hama museum. =Closer to power= In 1950 Al-Hourani renamed his party the Arab Socialist Party; at that point, Batatu states, \\"it counted no fewer than 10,000 members and was able to attract as many as 40,000 people from the countryside when in the same year it convoked at Aleppo the first peasant congress in Syrian history.\\"Batatu, p. 729. Between 1949 and 1954 Syrian politics was punctuated by four military coups. Based on his strong influence in the army, Al-Hourani was considered to have played a part in these coups, however there is no concrete evidence to support that. He was initially particularly close to the leader of the third and fourth coups, Adib al-Shishakli, who effectively ruled Syria from 1951 until 1954. Al-Shishakli's decision to sign a decree distributing state lands to the peasantry in January 1952 appears to have been under al-Hawrani's influence.Seale, p. 47. However, as the dictator grew more autocratic his influence waned, and when al- Shishakli decided to ban the Arab Socialist Party in April 1952, he went into exile in Lebanon. There, in November that year, he agreed to merge the Arab Socialist Party with the Arab Ba'ath Party led by Michel Aflaq and Salah al- Din al-Bitar. The latter thus gained a substantial base of active supporters for the first time. The unified party adopted the name Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party. It was disbanded, along with all Syrian political parties by president Nasser in 1958. The relation between Al-Hourani and Aflaq ended acrimoniously in 1962. The Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party Al-Hourani was a member of the Ba'ath Party national command, meaning its pan-Arab leadership, from its establishment in 1954 until 1959. Along with the other Ba'athists and members of most of Syria's political forces, he played a prominent role in the agitation and political mobilization that forced al-Shishakli to give up power in early 1954. He was speaker of the Syrian parliament from 1957 to February 1958. In that position, Al-Hourani was able to influence the introduction of social and economical progressive reforms. Akram Al-Hourani (speaker of the Syrian parliament) The United Arab Republic After the treaty of union between Syria and Egypt in 1958 Al-Hourani became Vice-President of the United Arab Republic (UAR) under Gamal Abdel Nasser, a post he held until 1959. After Nasser launched a bitter verbal attack on the Ba'ath Party in December that year, followed by a campaign of repression against its members, he resigned his position and went into exile in Lebanon. He subsequently differed with Aflaq and al-Bitar over the party's position regarding the UAR, due to his support for secession from the UAR. When a 1961 military coup in Syria led to the dissolution of the UAR, Al-Hourani publicly supported it and signed a statement in favor of the secession (as did Bitar, but he later withdrew his signature). The Ba'ath Party split into several competing factions, but as the national command decided in favour of reunification, Al-Hourani left it. He was officially expelled in June 1962, whereafter he and his loyalists re- established the Arab Socialist Party. However, popular support for unity hampered its growth and it was strong only in his original stronghold of Hama. In September 1962 he joined the \\"secessionist\\" (infisali) cabinet formed by Khalid al-Azm, drawing strong criticism from the Ba'athist and Nasserist movements. Exile and death After the Ba'athist/Nasserist-led pro- reunification coup of March 1963, Al-Hourani went into exile in Lebanon. As a radical military-backed Ba'ath faction purged other political groups in Syria, he was decided to remain in opposition outside the country, and would never return. His position against military coups is based on his strong belief in declamatory. The Arab Socialist Party split into competing factions, some of which aligned with the Ba'ath, some of which opposed it, but Hawrani's own influence dwindled. He spent the rest of his life between Lebanon, Iraq, France and Jordan, where he died in 1996. Al-Hourani was an important name in Syrian history but by the time of his death he had little or no influence at all over modern politics. His memoirs were published posthumously in Cairo in 2000.

The Washington Post. 28 June 2000. Born in Jerusalem in 1926, Hanna Batatu emigrated to the United States in 1948, the year of the Nakba - a series of events surrounding the establishment of the state of Israel in most of (what had previously been) British Mandate Palestine, as well as the creation of a large Palestinian refugee population barred by the new state from returning to their homes. From 1951 to 1953, he studied at Georgetown University's Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. He gained his doctorate at political science in Harvard University in 1960, with a dissertation entitled The Shaykh and the Peasant in Iraq, 1917-1958. From 1962 to 1982 he taught at the American University of Beirut, then from 1982 until his retirement in 1994 at Georgetown University in the United States. Batatu started studying Iraqi history in the 1950s, taking a particular interest in the revolutionary movements which were then prominent in that country and especially in the Iraqi Communist Party. From the late 1950s on he travelled to Iraq several times, and succeeded in having access to communist political prisoners and secret police files before the revolution of 1958. He was allowed access to security service archives from various periods of Iraqi history, up until the 1970s, and used this and his considerable range of personal contacts with figures from different political movements to compose his study of political change in Iraq, The Old Social Classes and New Revolutionary Movements of Iraq (published in 1978). This work, although largely focusing on the Iraqi Communist Party, also provides a wealth of information about the other revolutionary movements in the country as well as the ruling classes prior to 1958, and is considered one of the fundamental works on modern Iraqi history. Batatu's methodology is grounded in political sociology and considers in detail the social factors for the developments he covers, and even more so the social composition of the movements in question. Batatu also undertook a similar study of Syria, Syria's Peasantry, the Descendants of Its Lesser Rural Notables, and Their Politics (published in 1999).

Mi≈Çosz Magin (6 July 19294 March 1999) was a Polish composer and pianist. Biography Born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland, Mi≈Çosz Magin showed considerable musical abilities from early childhood. He was a student of piano with Margerita Trombini-Kazuro and composition with both Kazimierz Sikorski and Jan Maklakiewicz; the latter he considered his spiritual father. Magin also studied violin, cello and ballet. In 1957, he completed his piano, compositional and conducting studies, graduating the Warsaw Higher School of Music with distinction. Mi≈Çosz Magin won prizes in several top international competitions: the International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw, the Marguerite Long-Jacques Thibaud Competition in Paris and the Vianna da Motta Competition in Lisbon. He left his native country together with his wife Idalia Magin and stayed in Portugal, Germany, and England until finally settling in Paris in 1960. Magin's career as an international soloist was suddenly interrupted in 1963 after his left wrist was broken in a car accident. However, he eventually regained his playing abilities, and in 1968 started recording the complete works of Chopin for Decca, which is now regarded as a reference recording (a complete reissue on CD was made by Universal in 2000). Other recordings: Chopin, Four Ballades, IPG (Societe francaise du son) 1973 Long Playing Record. During his years of recovery Magin went back to composition, which became one of his main priorities for the rest of his life. A prodigious piano virtuoso, he regularly gave concerts in different countries around the world, mainly performing works by Chopin, his favorite composer, but also works by Mozart and various Polish, French and Russian composers, as well as his own music. In parallel to his career as a pianist and composer, Mi≈Çosz Magin became a popular teacher with students who came to him from all over the world, including such famous performers as Jean- Marc Luisada. According to his students, Magin was an exceptional master, not only sharing his knowledge but having the gift to inspire and tactfully advise while demanding high standards of his students. He left a considerable body of music: piano works, including four sonatas and collections for young pianists, several concertos (four for piano, two for violin, one of each for cello and clarinet ), two symphonies, and a ballet, as well as vocal and orchestral works. Not attached to any particular musical style, Mi≈Çosz Magin's music is notable for its balance between melody, harmony and rhythmic play. He was often inspired by the rhythms of his native Poland. Appreciated by the public, his works are now recorded and published as well as featured in the repertory of great performers. With the help of his wife Idalia, also a pianist, in 1985 Magin founded the Mi≈Çosz Magin International Piano Competition in Paris. Devoted to the discovery of young international talents and to the promotion of Polish music, this competition takes place every two years with increasing popularity. Magin died on 4 March 1999 of a heart attack while touring with concerts in Tahiti. He was buried next to Chopin's tomb at the P√®re-Lachaise cemetery in Paris, France. Mi≈Çosz Magin is considered one of the greatest Polish composers of the 20th century.

Incorporating design elements from the cruiser and the monitor, it was intended to provide small and inexpensive weapon systems for coastal defence and other littoral combat. Overview Like a monitor, torpedo rams operated with very little freeboard, sometimes with only inches of hull rising above the water, exposing only their funnels and turrets to enemy fire. In addition to the guns in their turrets, they also were equipped with torpedoes. Early designs incorporated a spar torpedo that could be extended from the bow and detonated by ramming a target. Later designs used tube-launched self-propelled torpedoes, but retained the concept of ramming, resulting in designs like HMS Polyphemus, which had five torpedo tubes, two each port and starboard and one mounted in the center of her reinforced ram bow. The torpedo ram concept came about at a time when the self-propelled torpedo, pioneered by Robert Whitehead, had only just been invented. The earliest self-propelled torpedoes were obviously very powerful weapons, but were very short-ranged and incapable of reaching speeds greater than 10 knots, making them useless against anything but stationary targets. Another result of this was that for a time there was much confusion in naval circles about how best to employ the torpedo. During the 1870s a large number of proposals emerged for torpedo-carrying warships. The torpedo ram, like most of the early torpedo-carrying warship designs, was intended to attack enemy warships while they were still at anchor in harbor. The torpedo ram's low profile and high speed were to make discovery and interception harder, as was the commonly stated intent for their attacks to take place at night. Once it reached the harbor, the torpedo ram was to smash its way through any seaward harbor defenses and make straight for the ships lying at anchor, firing its torpedoes before they could get underway. Once this was done, the torpedo ram would exit the harbor and make a high-speed escape to waiting friendly forces. Abandonment and legacy It soon became clear that the proposition of attacking enemy ships in harbors was not a practical one. Because of this, torpedo rams were never particularly popular, and the design was largely abandoned by the end of the 19th century as other, more practical, classes of torpedo-carrying warships emerged. Only a handful were built. The best remembered examples of the type were the aforementioned Polyphemus and the United States Navy's USS Intrepid. Neither saw a great deal of active service and they were mostly used for torpedo trials, although Polyphemus did demonstrate the potential damage she could inflict when she was used to demolish a harbor defense boom via ramming. While never popular with the naval services that created them, the torpedo ram can be said to have caught public attention in a manner which far exceeded its utility as a concept for a fighting ship. The heroic HMS Thunder Child in H. G. Wells's science fiction novel classic The War of the Worlds was a torpedo ram, and she destroyed two Martian Tripods before being sunk by a Martian Heat Ray.

It does not include farm workers, private household employees, or non-profit organization employees. It is an influential statistic and economic indicator released monthly by the United States Department of Labor as part of a comprehensive report on the state of the labor market. The financial assets most affected by the nonfarm payroll (NFP) data include the US dollar, equitieshttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-dollar-attempts-build- higher-043200904.htmlhttp://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/09/non-farm- payroll-report.asp and gold.http://www.economies.com/commodities/news/gold-in- tight-range-ahead-of-october-nfp-numbers-8394 The markets react very quickly and most of the time in a very volatile fashion around the time the NFP data is released. The short-term market moves indicate that there is a very strong correlation between the NFP data and the strength of the US dollar. Historical price movement data shows a small negative correlation between the NFP data and the US dollar Index. The Bureau of Labor Statistics releases preliminary data on the third Friday after the conclusion of the reference week, i.e., the week which includes the 12th of the month, at 8:30a.m. Eastern Time; typically this date occurs on the first Friday of the month. Nonfarm payroll is included in the monthly Employment Situation or informally the jobs report and affects the US dollar, the Foreign exchange market, the bond market, and the stock market. The figure released is the change in nonfarm payrolls (NFP), compared to the previous month, and is usually between +10,000 and +250,000 during non- recessional times. That number is meant to represent the number of jobs added or lost in the economy over the last month, not including jobs relating to the farming industry. Interpretation for the economy In general, increases in employment means both that businesses are hiring which means they are growing and that the newly-employed people have money to spend on goods and services, which further fuels growth. The opposite is true for decreases in employment. Interpretation for financial markets US employment data showed sustained weakness throughout 2011. The jobs market has become an area of key focus for investors and market participants since US Federal Reserve ties monetary policies with economic performance, such as the size of quantitative easing programme. For this reason and in this environment the market is particularly sensitive to significant NFP releases. While the overall number of jobs added or lost in the economy is obviously an important current indicator of what the economic situation is, the report also includes several other pieces of data that can move financial markets: 1\\\\. What the unemployment rate is in the economy as a percentage of the overall workforce. This is an important part of the report as the number of people out of work is a good indication of the overall health of the economy, and this is a number that is watched by the Fed as when it becomes low (generally anything below 5%) inflation is expected to start to creep up as businesses have to pay up to hire good workers and increase prices as a result. This initial rise in prices may mean that workers demand higher wages (especially as the economy reaches full employment) causing further inflation. In macroeconomics, this is known as the price/wage spiral. 2\\\\. Which sectors the increase or decrease in jobs came from. This can give traders a heads up on which sectors of the economy may be primed for growth as companies in those sectors such as housing add jobs. 3\\\\. Average hourly earnings. This is an important component because if the same number of people are employed but are earning more or less money for that work, this has basically the same effect as if people had been added or subtracted from the labor force. 4\\\\. Revisions of previous nonfarm payrolls releases. An important component of the report which can move markets as traders re-price growth expectations based on the revision to the previous number.

It is primarily used for concerts, shows and indoor sports like indoor soccer or basketball. It used to be the home arena of the Monterrey Fury indoor soccer team and the Fuerza Regia, a professional basketball team in the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional; the Monterrey La Raza, a team in the NISL; and the Monterrey Steel, an indoor American football team in the National Arena League. The Arena Monterrey is owned by Publimax S.A. de C.V. (TV Azteca Northeast), part of the Avalanz Group, who owns 80% and by TV Azteca who owns 20%. The arena is 45,000 m2 (480,000 square feet) in size. History The project of the arena started in 1989 when the Asociaci√≥n para el Fomento de Deporte y Recreaci√≥n A.C, led by the businessmen Jorge Lankenau and Hernan Garza presented the project to the then president Carlos Salinas. The project gained support from the Government of the State of Nuevo Le√≥n who gave the land for the arena to be constructed within the limits of Fundidora Park. The arena was originally planned to begin construction in May 1992, and finished by 1993, but the construction actually started in January 1994, and was planned to be finished by 1996. However, due to the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, in May 1995 the project suffered a slowdown in the construction industry and finally came to a complete halt by 1996, due to the lack of economic resources. In April 2001, the Government of the State of Nuevo Le√≥n invited 11 groups of investors to discuss the possibilities of restarting the construction of the arena. On June 1, 2001 the government announced that there were only five groups of investors willing to take over the debt and finish up the project and 2 weeks later, Publimax S.A. de C.V. was announced winner of the contest because it was the group with the most money eager to invest in the project (US$50 million). Before the construction was restarted, Hern√°n Garza accused the government of illegally revoking the concession that was given to him to build and finish the project. The government revoked the concession because of the halt of the project in 1995, but Garza alleged that the economic crisis obliged him to stop it for some time. This, among other problems such as the government delay in giving full control of the arena and Publimax rejecting any investment until control was fully given (which happened in July 2002), caused the project to restart by the end of 2002 with an estimated finish date by the first trimester of 2004. However, by the last trimester of 2003 the project was almost completed and the first event in the arena took place on Thursday November 27, 2003, with a concert performed by Mexican singer-songwriter Juan Gabriel.

He worked variously with N-Trance, The Time Frequency, Belinda Carlisle, Ice MC, Scooter, Mary Kiani and DJ Dado. His multi-award-winning dance music show, Steppin' Out, started in 1985 and ran for fourteen years on Radio Forth, Forth RFM and Forth FM. Although the show was only broadcast to East and Central Scotland, tapes of the show were sent all over the world, hence the reason there were requests from listeners in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong. Due to the success of his show and the Scottish dance music boom, Wilson's Bonus Beats programme aired on Forth FM during the mid-1990s. This allowed many local DJs the opportunity to provide one-hour mixes, spawning the growth of Tartan techno. Early days In 1972, Wilson started his broadcasting career in pirate radio on such stations as Radio Caroline Scotland and Radio Telstar. Later in 1984, he began answering phones for the Transistor Boogie show presented by Graham Jackson. From 1985 the first of what turned out to be Wilson's dance music shows on Forth FM came to air across East and Central Scotland. For fifteen years through the mid-1980s and into the 1990s, he presented Steppin' Out, which went on to win several awards. As well as being a radio presenter, he was also a record producer and achieved some considerable chart success with ten singles, one of which \\"Technocat\\" reached the Top 40 in the UK. He was responsible for the Bouncing Beats compilation releases, and also spent time remixing material for N-Trance and Belinda Carlisle. Back to Forth Having spent some time working at other Scottish radio stations, he returned to Radio Forth in 2003 as the station's Head of Music for both FM (Forth 1) and AM (Forth 2) stations, and hosted two shows per week, including Old Skool. In addition, away from music, Wilson was a fan of Heart of Midlothian F.C. Bouncin' Back Wilson was also a nightclub DJ, appearing across the country at numerous clubs and events such as Awesome 101, Fantazia, Rezerection and The Fubar. He also became a record producer, producing \\"Technocat\\" which, billed as Technocat featuring Tom Wilson, became a Top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart. It also charted in several European countries. In addition his track, \\"Let Your Body Go\\", spent one week at #60 in the UK chart in March 1996. Wilson also put together several compilation albums, namely the Bouncin' Back and Bouncin' Beats series. After a brief spell working at several other Scottish radio stations, including Beat 106 and Real Radio, Wilson rejoined Radio Forth in 2003 as head of music for both Forth One and Forth 2, and hosted two weekly shows including the Old Skool show on a Sunday evening. Gigs Wilson was popular on the club circuit, attending many prominent dance music events including 1992's SECC based 'Big Bang' event. The 1990s saw Wilson headlining the biggest dance festivals across Scotland, such as Livingston Forum's Awesome 101 and Ingliston's Rezerection. Death Radio Forth announced the death of Tom Wilson - father of four children; Lynsey, Stephanie, Craig and Allex- on 25 March 2004, at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital following a heart attack, and a short period of illness. His memorial service was held on 31 March 2004. His will requested that every man attending the service should wear a maroon tie, the colour worn by his favourite football team, and that donations should be given to the British Heart Foundation.

In its original formation, these are: Drama, Simulation, and Game. It was the inspiration for subsequent theories, such as the GNS Theory, which retained a 3-way division but altered other aspects of the model. The model In its most formal sense, the threefold model claims that any single gamemaster (GM) decision (about the resolution of in-game events) can be made in order to further the goals of Drama, or Simulation, or Game. By extension, a series of decisions may be described as tending towards one or two of the three goals, to a greater or lesser extent. This can be visualised as an equilateral triangle, with a goal at each vertex, and the points between them representing different weightings of the different goals. As a consequence, a player or GM can characterise their preferred gaming style as a point on this triangle, or (since no real precision is implied) in words such as 'mostly gamist' or 'dramatist with a bit of simulationist' or 'right in the middle'. Another consequence of the model is the claim that by advancing towards one of the goals, one is moving away from the other two. Thus a game that is highly dramatic will be neither a good simulation nor a challenging game, and so on. This assertion has been widely challenged, and led to criticism of the model. =The terms= In the terminology of the threefold, the goals of drama, simulation and game have specific meanings. * Drama is concerned with the narrative qualities of the game, such as story, nuances of meaning, exploration of themes, etc. It does not imply following a preset story, but an eagerness to achieve good or well plotted stories and meaning in the unfolding events. * Game is concerned with the amount and kind of challenge that the players face in the course of the game. Ideas such as 'balance' and 'fairness' and 'victory' belong here. * Simulation is concerned with the internal consistency of events that unfold in the gameworld, and ensuring that they are only caused by in-game factors - that is, eliminating metagame concerns (such as drama and game). Simulation isn't necessarily concerned with simulating reality; it could be a simulation of any fictional world, cosmology or scenario, according to its own rules. History of the threefold model The Threefold Model was widely discussed in the rec.games.frp.advocacy USENET group in the summer of 1997. Mary Kuhner had laid out many of the central ideas there and John H. Kim had later codified and expanded the discussion. The threefold arose following long arguments and flame-wars about whether one style of roleplaying was 'better' than another style. The name was coined by Kuhner, in a July 1997 post which outlined the principles. In October 1998, a \\"Frequently Asked Questions\\" (FAQ) document by Kim on the Threefold Model clearly stated, \\"An important part of the model is recognising that there are valid different goals for gaming.\\" It has since then been circulated in a variety of places. It was also the inspiration for a related model known as \\"GNS Theory\\", which has been articulated by Ron Edwards on the roleplaying discussion site The Forge.

When Noriega took refuge in the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See (diplomatic quarter), deafening music and other psychological warfare tactics were used to convince him to exit and surrender himself. The United States claimed that after ten days of psychological harassment, the Papal Nuncio (ambassador) Monsignor Laboa had threatened to revoke Noriega's sanctuary if he didn't surrender to the United States, although Laboa insisted that he had made no threats of revoking the right of asylum under the Church, but had used his own \\"precisely calibrated psychological campaign\\" to force Noriega's departure.New York Times, \\"The Noriega Case: Panama City; Papal Envoy Asserts Psychology, Not Ultimatum, Swayed Noriega,\\" 6 January 1990 Although the operation was successful, National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft would later point to the psychological harassment of the Papal Nuncio as \\"a low moment in US Army history,\\" noting that their approach had been silly, reproachable and undignified.Bose, Meenekshi. \\"From Cold War to New World Order: The Foreign Policy of George H. W. Bush,\\" Page 181 Military operation Launched in the starting hours of Operation Just Cause, this operation was handled by SEAL Team 4. Consisting of 48 U.S. Navy SEALs (three SEAL Platoons; Golf, Echo, and Delta) under the command of Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Toohey (executive officer of Team 4 and former SEAL Team SIX officer), this team was tasked with destroying Noriega's private jet on the ground at the Punta Paitilla Airport, a coastal airport in Panama City. The main force of SEALs landed just south of the airport at approximately 0030, shortly before the initial combat operations started within Panama City itself. Several reconnaissance teams were hidden on the north side of the airfield to provide real-time data on enemy movements. Once the SEALs landed, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey established a command post near the southern edge of the runway. At this time Cmdr. McGrath, a SEAL officer stationed on a patrol boat offshore coordinating several operations, passed on information implying that the aircraft was to be disabled with \\"minimal damage\\" (defined as shot out tires and cut control wires), rather than destroyed. This later became a point of controversy after the operation, as the message was poorly worded and forced the SEALs to change their tactics at the last minute and approach the aircraft more closely than anticipated. The three platoons then began advancing up the airfield, with Golf platoon taking up final assaulting positions outside the hangar at roughly 0105. At this point, Lt. Cmdr. Toohey received a message stating that PDF V300 Cadillac Gage armored cars were heading towards the airport. To counter the threat, a squad (Squad One of Golf Platoon) was ordered to move into ambush positions on a nearby road. As they stood up to move, the PDF soldiers stationed in the airfield immediately opened fire, killing one SEAL and wounding five others. The other two platoons moved to reinforce Golf, and within several minutes had secured the hangars, with two more SEALs killed and four more wounded. The SEALs then disabled Noriega's private plane by shooting it with an AT4 rocket. Shortly after, a MEDEVAC helicopter arrived and transported the injured SEALs to the Joint Casualty Collection Point at Howard Air Force Base. The SEALs held the area throughout the night, and disabled the runway for use by any PDF transport planes by rolling other aircraft onto it. The next day, the SEALs were replaced by a company from the 75th Ranger Regiment. Due to the high level of casualties sustained and several inconsistencies regarding planning and command and control during the battle, the Battle of Paitilla Airport is considered one of the most controversial operations within Operation JUST CAUSE from the US military perspective. During the Paitilla Airfield operation, another Navy SEAL group from SEAL Team TWO, consisting of four divers and men on Zodiac attack boats, was assigned to conduct a combat swimmer attack and sabotage Noriega's heavily armed gunboat, Presidente Porras, while it was tied to a pier on the canal. The plan called for the divers to plant explosives on the bottom of the boat, using Draeger rebreathers, which do not give off exhalation bubbles, for added secrecy. The divers were transported by several combat rubber raiding craft to an insertion point located in a grove of mangrove trees roughly one hundred fifty yards away from the target. The divers entered the water and approached the boat in separate pairs, attached the explosives, and began exfiltrating. As they were leaving, several PDF guards began dropping grenades and shooting into the water, forcing the SEALs to take cover under the pier. Due to this diversion, the divers were still in the area when the bombs went off, and were able to confirm that the ship was destroyed. As the divers were heading back to the rendezvous point, they heard a large ship approaching overhead, and were forced to descend to forty feet, dangerous due to the increased toxicity of the pure oxygen used in the Draeger at greater pressures. However, no divers experienced any ill effects, and both pairs were picked up by several raiding craft, and were transported back to Rodman Naval Base. Encircling the Apostolic Nunciature of the Holy See On the fifth day of the American invasion, Noriega phoned Monsignor Laboa at the Apostolic Nunciature and explained he would appreciate being able to seek sanctuary within; noting that he would otherwise have to flee to the countryside and wage a guerrilla war. Given only ten minutes to decide, Laboa said he did not confer with the Vatican, but agreed to allow Noriega to enter the Nunciature grounds ‚Äì although from the very start, he confessed that he deceived Noriega, noting that he believed that Panamanian politics necessitated that his own role be to convince Noriega to surrender to the American army, not to grant him asylum within Vatican territory. Laboa later confided he was \\"surprised and dismayed\\" that Noriega would choose to seek refuge with the Church.UPI in Bryan Times, \\"Vatican Envoy won its psychologial battle with Noriega,\\" 5 Jan. 1990 Noriega fled to the Apostolic Nunciature, the de facto embassy of the Holy See, and took refuge there with four others, Lieut. Colonel Nivaldo Madrinan, head of Panama's secret police; Captain Eliecer Gaitan, who led the special force charged with protecting Noriega; Belgica de Castillo, the former head of the immigration department, and her husband Carlos Castillo.TIME, \\"A Guest Who Wore Out His Welcome,\\" 15 Jan. 1990Lonely Planet, Panama, 2007. Page 32 He turned over the majority of his weapons, and requested sanctuary within. He spent his time in a \\"stark\\" room with no air conditioning or television, reading the Bible for the duration of his stay. American soldiers set up a perimeter outside this building, as any direct action against the embassy itself would have violated international diplomatic law. United States Secretary of State James Baker wrote to the Vatican, insisting that \\"this is an exception to diplomatic immunity. We've indicted him as a drug dealer...you must understand that having lost American lives to restore democracy in Panama, we cannot allow Noriega to go to any other country than the United States.\\" Joaquin Navarro-Valls, speaking on behalf of the Vatican, clarified that the strong messages left by American diplomats and military leaders would not be obeyed and Noriega would not be turned over. Navarro-Valls clarified that Pope John Paul II had not spoken on the issue except to lament the deaths caused by \\"absurd imprudence.\\"Buckley, Kevin. \\"Panama,\\" page 247 The U.S. Army turned to psychological warfare, blaring rock music at \\"deafening levels,\\" gunning the engines of armored vehicles against the Nunciature's fence, and setting fire to a neighboring field and bulldozing it to create a \\"helicopter landing zone.\\" Reportedly the version of the song \\"I Fought The Law\\" performed by The Clash was played repeatedly along with \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" by AC/DChttps://muftah.org/thunderstruck-acdc-hits-irans-nuclear- workstations/#.WTLdSmjyhaQ and \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses;Leon Daniel in Bryan Times, \\"Installing the Gringo's Guy,\\" 5 Jan. 1990 another song in the line-up was \\"Too Old To Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die\\" by Jethro Tull.War Child  Music  Style Weekly - Richmond, VA local news, arts and events. On 27 December, the psychological warfare was turned over to the control of the 4th Psychological Operations Group of Special Operations Command. The Holy See complained to President George H. W. Bush about actions of the American soldiers surrounding the embassy, and after three days, the rock music was stopped. On 30 December, the Vatican clarified that it did not believe Noriega had asylum, \\"but [was] a person in refuge.\\" Meanwhile, Monsignor Laboa petitioned both Panama and the Vatican to agree to extend the embassy property to include another building where he had Noriega's four companions moved to prevent them from encouraging Noriega to stay under Vatican sanctuary, allowing him to convince Noriega to leave. A friend of Laboa later told the UPI that Laboa wanted to \\"go to work on Noriega, weave a sort of spell around him until he gives in\\". Surrender After ten days of demoralization, Monsignor Jose Sebastian Laboa told Noriega that he had no choice but to surrender to the American soldiers at the front gate. Time magazine later noted that Monsignor Laboa was not entirely honest with Noriega, falsely telling him that no country in the world was willing to grant him refuge. Monsignor Laboa had also written to the US Army, granting his permission for them to storm the property if they believed his life was in danger. Eventually, Monsignor Laboa said that if Noriega did not surrender to the Americans, the Papal staff would evacuate the building, move into a Catholic high school and declare it the new embassy ‚Äì leaving Noriega alone in the abandoned building to face the Americans without any benefit of Vatican sanctuary.Time magazine, \\"A Guest Who Wore Out His Welcome,\\" 15 Jan. 1990Lonely Planet, Panama. Page 27 Noriega asked permission to phone his wife and three daughters, who had taken refuge in the Cuban embassy; he ensured they would be flown to exile in the Dominican Republic if he surrendered. On 3 January, Noriega attended Holy Mass in the Nuncio's chapel and took communion; where Laboa's homily was about the thief on the cross who in one moment asked God to change his life, and reportedly brought tears to Noriega's eyes. After Mass, Noriega retired to his room where he wrote two letters, one to his wife informing her \\"I go now on an adventure,\\" and the other thanking the Pope and stressing that he believed himself innocent and that he had always acted in the best interests of the Panamanian people and requesting the Pope's prayers. Noriega dressed in his tan uniform, receiving permission to bring the Nuncio's Bible with him, and went outside into the dark night with three priests who walked with him the fifty paces to the front gate; when he reached the front gate, an American paratrooper named Sgt. Scott Geist lunged at Noriega, described as \\"a broken man,\\" and a number of other soldiers also tackled him to the ground and began searching his effects. His wrists were taped behind his back and he was bundled into a waiting American helicopter which took him to Howard Air Force Base. Monsignor Laboa later told the press that he was proud at having \\"outwitted\\" Noriega and convincing him to surrender himself to the Americans, noting \\"I'm better at psychology.\\" References Category:History of Panama Category:Military operations involving the United States Nifty Package Category:Psychological warfare Category:Holy See‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:Holy See‚ÄìPanama relations Category:United States Navy SEALs Category:Panama‚ÄìUnited States relations Category:United States invasion of Panama Category:December 1989 events in North America ","title":"Operation Nifty Package"},{"id":"2299726","text":"The Way I Feel Today is the third album by English indie rock band Six by Seven.

Biography McCulloch was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on 27 April 1926, and was educated at Upper Canada College and the University of Toronto. Ernest McCulloch received his MD in 1948 from the University of Toronto. Upon graduation, he began his education in research at the Lister Institute in London, England. In 1957 he joined the newly formed Ontario Cancer Institute, where the majority of his research focused on normal blood-formation and leukaemia. Together with his colleague, Dr. J.E. Till, McCulloch created the first quantitative, clonal method to identify stem cells and used this technique for pioneering studies on stem cells. His experience in hematology, when combined with Till's experience in biophysics, yielded a novel and productive combination of skills and interests. In the early 1960s, McCulloch, and Till started a series of experiments that involved injecting bone marrow cells into irradiated mice. Visible nodules were observed in the spleens of the mice, in proportion to the number of bone marrow cells injected. Till and McCulloch called the nodules 'spleen colonies', and speculated that each nodule arose from a single marrow cell: perhaps a stem cell. In later work, Till and McCulloch were joined by graduate student Andy Becker, and demonstrated that each nodule did indeed arise from a single cell. They published their results in Nature in 1963. In the same year, in collaboration with Lou Siminovitch, a trailblazing Canadian molecular biologist, they obtained evidence that these cells were capable of self-renewal, a crucial aspect of the functional definition of stem cells that they had formulated. McCulloch's later research was on cellular and molecular mechanisms affecting the growth of malignant blast stem cells obtained from the blood of patients with Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia. In 1974, McCulloch became a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. In 1988, he became an Officer of the Order of Canada and was made a member of the Order of Ontario in 2006. In 1999, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 2004, McCulloch was inducted into the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame. He holds the distinguished title of University Professor Emeritus at the University of Toronto. In 2005, he and James Till were awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research.

Other channels of the group in the Netherlands are SBS6, Veronica, and SBS9. It is aimed at high- educated female viewers. The station broadcasts various series, reality shows, and films.  History  Net5 was launched by the SBS Broadcasting Group as their second commercial channel in the Netherlands next to SBS6. The head of SBS was Fons van Westerloo who left the company to work until 31 January 2008 to head the main competitor RTL Nederland (part of the RTL Group). Van Westerloo announced the new broadcast on 4 December 1998. It was supposed to become a commercial version of the Netherlands Public Broadcasting. Net5 was launched on 1 March 1999 and the first broadcast was the film Braveheart. Since there were not that many commercial channels at the time, the Net5 brand was partly chosen to compete directly with the RTL 5 channel. The goal was for viewers to put Net5 on position 5 of their remote control settings instead of the older channel RTL 5. But research showed that more people would place RTL 5 on five, and Net5 on position nine. From January 2000 to August 2002, Net5 shared its channel with the children's channel Kindernet. Kindernet broadcast from the early morning until 15.00. The German ProSiebenSat.1 Media took over the parent company, SBS Broadcasting Group, on 27 June 2007. In 2011, all of SBS's activities in the Netherlands (through SBS Broadcasting B.V.), including the three TV stations (SBS6, Net5 and Veronica), the two TV guides (Veronica Magazine and Totaal TV), production, design and text activities were sold to a joint venture between Sanoma Media Netherlands (67%) and Talpa Holding (33%).

Geography  The natural harbour that makes up the town is located on the east side of Trinity Bay and it is built along the northeast side and the southeast base of this harbour. It opens out to Trinity Bay in a generally southwestern direction and protected from the harsh northern and eastern winds of the North Atlantic. Heart's Content is also at the crossroads of the main highway for Trinity Bay on the western side of the Bay de Verde peninsula and the highway cutting across the Bay de Verde peninsula between Victoria on the Conception Bay side and Heart's Content. The climate of the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent land areas is influenced by the temperatures of the surface waters and water currents as well as the winds blowing across the waters. Because of the oceans' great capacity for retaining heat, the climate of Heart's Content are moderate and free of extreme seasonal variations. Precipitation falls on the area both as snow in the wintertime and moderate rainfall in summer. The Gulf Stream and Labrador Current converge just off the coast of Newfoundland and provide for very dense fog that can linger in the area for days. History The first references to Heart's Content came from John Guy's journal of his voyage into Trinity Bay in 1612. Through much of the 17th century, Heart's Content was used by migratory fisherman from England. The area was permanently settled by at least 1677. Like many other Newfoundland English settlements, this small village was a victim to the French army of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville in 1697. During King William's War, this village was raided in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. In 1697, the French under d'Iberville entered Heart's Content. The final 30 men plus women and children retired to a fort commanded by Irishmen. The occupants surrendered to the French. A 1700 Census records a population of 35, 5 fishing-stages and 7 boats.During the 18th century, the inshore cod fishery was the main source of income. Agriculture in the summer and logging in the winter also helped the fisherman and their families. In 1783, a docking facility was established to build sailing craft of all types. This was the first attempt to diversify the economy of Heart's Content. At its height, the industry employed 100 men, shipwrights, sail-makers, caulkers, woodsmen, sailors and blacksmiths. Besides the growing importance of the Labrador fishery and the seal hunt, as well as the shipbuilding industry, other economic stimuli made it a growing and prosperous community. Transportation connections between Heart's Content and the rest of the Avalon Peninsula improved and greatly accommodated the movement of people and goods, and the overall production of business improved the town and other areas of Trinity and Conception Bays. Within 10 years of incorporation Heart's Content obtained most of the facilities and the amenities of a small town. These included a town hall, fire station, a municipal park, water and sewage system, a ballpark and a senior citizens club. =19th century= SS Great Eastern at Heart's Content Landing of the Atlantic Cable of 1866, Heart's Content, Newfoundland, by Robert Charles Dudley, 1866. * 1823 ‚Äì Society for the Propagation of the Gospel opens its first school in Heart's Content, with Thomas Parker as teacher. * 1862 ‚Äì Rev.

Rendell Forge  Rendell Forge, Heart's Content, July 2020 The Rendell Forge is a small, one- room, one storey wooden blacksmith shop located in Heart's Content. The Rendell family had a long history of blacksmithing in the community. The first to arrive was blacksmith Charles Rendell, who moved to Heart's Content from Trinity, Trinity Bay, in the early 1800s to craft ironwork for vessels. In 1864‚Äì65, four Rendells were listed as blacksmiths: Charles, G., James, and John. The 1904 directory lists five: Giles, Tolson, Charles Sr, John, and John T. Ted Rowe writes, > Descendants of Charles Rendell produced an unbroken line in the blacksmith > trade in Heart‚Äôs Content for three generations. His four sons Charles, > Giles, James and John all took up the trade. Son Charles was also Heart‚Äôs > Content‚Äôs first constable, appointed in the 1830s, and was prominent in the > Loyal Orange Association.

James Rendell (son of Charles Sr) moved to East Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked as a blacksmith, machinist, and businessman, and where he married Rebecca Rendell (n√©e Pugh) of King's Road, St. John's on December 10, 1892. Some of the Rendell blacksmiths went to Gander to work on the building of the airport and town in the 1940s.

He was responsible for the first major phylogenetic ordering of bird groups based on a large scale study on a combination of skeletal, morphological and anatomical characteristics. Biography Max was the first son of Karl F√ºrbringer, and Hermine. Although he was born in Wittenberg, his father's work in the government involved travel and he was raised by relatives in Gera. Max was taught and influenced by Karl Theodor Liebe, a bird enthusiast who kept many kinds of birds. Max spent his early childhood collecting butterflies, bees, mosses and ferns. He was also interested in coins. Max's brother Paul would later become an eminent physicist. Max studied at the universities of Berlin and Jena, where he was a student of Karl Gegenbaur.F√ºrbringer, M. (1888), Untersuchungen zur Morphologie und Systematik der V√∂gel, Amsterdam: van Halkema (1751 pages). F√ºrbringer would be one of Gegenbaur's most ardent disciples and supporters. One of F√ºrbringer teachers was Ernst Haeckel about whom he wrote glowingly: \\"He stepped into the auditorium, not with the measured step of the professor, but with the triumphant charging-along of an Apollonian youth, hurrying toward the cathedra, a tall, slender, impressive form; ... golden, flying locks, large, blue, flashing eyes‚Äîprobably the most beautiful man that I had ever seen, and it seemed to me as if the room, which had already been bright, became noticeably brighter...\\"Fuerbringer M. 1914. Wie ich Ernst Haeckel kennen lernte und mit ihm verkehrte und wie er mein Fuehrer in den groessten Studen meines Lebens wurde. In: Schmidt, H, editor. Was Wir Ernst Haeckel Verdanken. 2 vol. Leipzig: Unesma. 2:335‚Äì350. He obtained his doctorate with a thesis on the muscles and bones of dinosaurs. He later worked as a prosector under Gegenbaur at the University of Heidelberg, followed by professorships in Amsterdam, Jena (from 1888) and Heidelberg (from 1901).Heidelberg University Library (biography) In 1901 he replaced Gegenbaur at Heidelberg as professor and stayed on until 1912 when his student (and later son-in-law) Hermann Braus took over. He then served as an au√üerordentliche (=extraordinary) professor at the University of Marburg. In 1888 F√ºrbringer published a two volume work on the systematics of birds groups. The first volume was on the forelimbs and shoulder girdle of vertebrates while the second examined the characters and systematics of bird groups. One of the ideas that he used was that the connection of the nerve to a muscle tends to be conserved with evolution. He made use of 51 anatomical and morphological characters and compared every pair of bird group and deduced an evolutionary tree of all the extant and extinct bird groups. His evolutionary tree branched in three dimensions which he represented by means of side and cross-sectional views. This representation was probably influenced by the work of Adolf Engler on plants. This was a seminal work in bird systematics which underwent modifications by Hans Gadow and others to stay as a definitive work on the avian evolutionary tree until the arrival of molecular techniques.

In the nineteenth century, it was the base for Samori Ture, a Dyula warlord who named the city in 1878 as the capital of his Wassoulou Empire (1861-1890). Ture was known for his resistance to French colonial forces and prevailed against them and smaller African states for years. The treaty of Bissandugu was signed there on the 25th of March 1887, by which France would obtain major rights of navigation on the Niger river, an important prelude to its conquests of West Africa, and delimiting the Wassoulou empire's borders with France. Furthermore, the treaty made the Wassoulou empire a French protectorate. On April 9, 1891, the city was attacked and burned by French forces commanded by Colonel Louis Archinard during the Mandingo Wars.

Its English name derives from the small fruit, which have a taste reminiscent of both plums and dates. It is among the oldest plants in cultivation.  Distribution and ecology  The species area extends from East Asia to the west of the Mediterranean, down to Spain. The date-plum is native to southwest Asia and southeast Europe. It was known to the ancient Greeks as \\"God's fruit\\" (, Di√≥s p≈∑r√≥s), hence the scientific name of the genus. Its English name probably derives from Persian Khormaloo ÿÆÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÑŸà literally \\"date-plum\\", referring to the taste of this fruit which is reminiscent of both plums and dates. The fruit is called Amlok ÿßŸÖŸÑŸà⁄© in Pakistan and consumed dried. This species is one candidate for the \\"lotus tree\\" mentioned in The Odyssey: it was so delicious that those who ate it forgot about returning home and wanted to stay and eat lotus with the lotus- eaters. The tree grows in the lower and middle mountain zones in the Caucasus. They usually grow up to 600 m above sea level. In Central Asia, it rises higher‚Äîup to 2000 m. They rarely grow in stands but often grow with hackberry, ash, maple and other deciduous species. It is not demanding on the soil and can grow on rocky slopes but requires a well lit environment. It is cultivated at the limits of its range, as well as in the U.S. and North Africa.  Biological description  This is a tree height of 15‚Äì30 m with sloughing of aging bark. The leaves are shiny, leathery, oval shape with pointed ends, 5‚Äì15 cm long and 3‚Äì6 cm in width. The flowers are small, greenish, appearing in June to July. Fruits are berries with juicy flesh, yellow when ripe, 1‚Äì2 cm in diameter. Seeds with thin skin and a very hard endosperm. File:Diospyros_lotus_02.jpgThe fruit of date-plum.

He played his entire career in Major League Baseball as a shortstop and third baseman for the Washington Senators from 1933 to 1947, losing four seasons to military service during World War II. He led the American League in hits in and his career batting average of .314 is a record for American League shortstops, and ranks third among all shortstops behind Honus Wagner (.327) and Arky Vaughan (.318). Biography Travis was born on a farm in Riverdale, Georgia, the youngest of ten children, and declined a scholarship to Georgia Tech in favor of a scholarship to a baseball training school. A left-handed batter, he broke in with the Senators in , getting five hits in his first game - joining Fred Clarke as the second and last player to do so - and batting .302 in 18 games at age 19. Prior to 2019, it was the last pennant-winning campaign by a Washington team, although Travis did not play in the five-game World Series loss to the New York Giants. The following year he began to take over third base duties from veteran Ossie Bluege, and batted .319 as the team plummeted to seventh place. He followed by hitting .318, .317, .344 and .335, playing full-time at shortstop from 1937‚Äì39, but the 82-71 team - on which he split time between shortstop and right field - would remain the only winning squad for which he would play regularly. He led the AL with 29 double plays at third base in . In he was named to his first All-Star team, and placed ninth in the AL's MVP voting. After slipping to a .292 average in 1939 while suffering two cases of the flu, he returned with All-Star seasons in 1940 and 1941, hitting .322 and .359 (second in the AL as Ted Williams batted .406). In the latter year Travis enjoyed his best overall season with career highs of 101 runs batted in, 106 runs scored, 39 doubles, 19 triples and 7 home runs, along with his league- best 218 hits, and finished sixth in the MVP vote. Travis entered the Army in the winter of 1941-42, and spent most of World War II in the United States, playing on military baseball teams. Sent to Europe in late 1944 while serving in the 76th Infantry Division, he suffered a severe case of frostbite during the Battle of the Bulge, necessitating an operation to prevent amputation of his feet. Travis received a Bronze Star for his military service. Although only 31 years old when he returned to baseball, he was not the same player as he had been before the war, and hit .241 in late 1945 and .252 in 1946. He retired after batting .216 in 74 games in . One month before his final game, he was honored with \\"Cecil Travis Night\\" at Griffith Stadium, with General Dwight D. Eisenhower in attendance. In his career, Travis had 1544 hits, 665 runs, 657 RBI, 265 doubles, 78 triples, 27 home runs, 402 walks and 23 stolen bases in 1328 games. He was a Senators scout until 1956, and then returned to his family farm. He was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1975. He died at his home in December 2006 at age 93.

The station is owned by Dell Loy Hansen, through Broadway Media LS, LLC. KUUU broadcasts R&B;/Hip-Hop music. The station's studios are located in Downtown Salt Lake City and its transmitter site is located southwest of the city on Farnsworth Peak in the Oquirrh Mountains. History The station was launched on September 1, 1979 and adopted its callsign KTLE on September 10. On May 19, 1982, it was modified to KTLE-FM. On May 9, 1997, it was slightly changed to KTKL and again to its current KUUU on March 8, 1999. The station's current Rhythmic Top 40 format began on February 27, 1999 at 92.1 FM and was licensed to Tooele, Utah.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-03-05.pdf In February 2005, the station moved to its current dial position and changed its city-of-license to South Jordan, Utah, allowing them to better cover the Salt Lake Valley. The station was previously broadcasting to most of the valley via a low-power booster in the Oquirrh mountains. Current announcers include Poetik-C, Nikki Rae, DJ Erockalypze and Kev. Past hosts included N8 Smiff, Jay R, Zac Davis, Romeo on the Radio, Pat Clark after Dark, Jagger, Kevin Cruise, Ron T, Booker, JDub, Mark-E, & Tic- Tac. In an article from The Salt Lake Tribune, the station is cited by music trade publications and record labels for being influential in breaking songs from artists like Flo Rida, Plies and T-Pain, especially in a radio market like Salt Lake City. Program Director at the time Brian Michel says it is because the station is not owned by a major broadcaster, who would tell the hosts what they should play instead of what the listeners really want to hear: \\"People in San Antonio aren't telling us what to play,\\" he said. \\"We have no outside consultants. We interact with [our listeners].\\"From Salt Lake Tribune (February 15, 2008) On June 18, 2010, KUUU, along with KUDD and KYLZ were sold the station to Simmons Media Group, who in turn sold the stations to Broadway Media in 2013. In 2016, KUUU initially applied to move from 92.5 to 92.3 and upgrade its signal coverage as part of a deal that Broadway made with Community Wireless, who moved KPCW-FM down from 91.9 to 91.7 and took ownership of KUDD that Broadway donated to them earlier, but then instead later applied to its wattage from 500 watts to 3,700 watts and decrease its HAAT from to , increasing its coverage area by approximately 15 miles in all directions.\\"Broadway Media To Donate 107.9 KUDD Salt Lake City; Upgrade 92.5 KUUU\\" from Radioinsight (December 2, 2015) On February 16, 2019 U92 celebrated 20 years on air.

A large portion at the south end of the airport is located in the town of Nekimi. It is located adjacent to Pioneer Airport, part of the EAA Aviation Museum. The airport was named after pioneer air racer, aircraft designer and builder Steve Wittman in 1972. Originally named Winnebago County Airport, the name Steve Wittman Field was proposed in 1968 and it is also known as Wittman Field. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2019‚Äì2023, in which it is categorized as a regional general aviation facility. History It has serviced aircraft as large as the Boeing 747, Boeing 767, Airbus A380, Concorde and Boeing B-52 Stratofortress. The airport has been served by commercial airlines in the past. Until 1980, Wittman boarded more passengers than nearby Appleton International Airport, and was the commercial air hub of the Fox Cities. =Historical Air Service= Wittman was served at various times by Wisconsin Central Airlines, North Central, Republic, Air Wisconsin, American Central, Midstate Airlines, Northwest Airlink, United Express, Midway Connection, Skyway, and Great Lakes. Service was subsidized by the Essential Air Service program until March 2003, when it was terminated due to federal law not allowing a subsidy over $200 per passenger for communities located within 210 miles of the nearest large or medium hub airport (Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport, a medium hub serving Milwaukee). Facilities and aircraft Wittman Regional Airport covers an area of 1,392 acres (563 ha) at an elevation of 808 feet (246 m) above mean sea level. It has four paved runways: 18/36 is 8,002 by 150 feet (2,439 x 46 m); 9/27 is 6,179 by 150 feet (1,883 x 46 m); 5/23 is 3,697 by 75 feet (1,127 x 23 m); 13/31 is 3,061 by 75 feet (933 x 23 m). In developing their 2020 Master Plan, the airport is currently studying the closure of either runway 5/23, 13/31, or possibly both. During EAA AirVenture Oshkosh, two additional temporary runways are in operation to accommodate the high volume of traffic of numerous aircraft sizes and types: a portion of Taxiway A to the east of runway 18/36 becomes Runway 18L/36R (Runway 18/36 is re- designated 18R/36L and shortened to 6,700 feet) and a small grass runway (1,200 x 100 feet (366 x 30 m)) on the southern end of the airport is used to host ultralight aircraft. Runways 5/23 and 13/31 are closed during AirVenture. For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2018, the airport had 76,216 aircraft operations, an average of 209 per day: 98% general aviation, 2% air taxi and less than 1% military, though the EAA AirVenture airshow accounts for a large number of the annual operations. In June 2020, there were 173 aircraft based at this airport: 130 single-engine, 30 multi-engine, 11 jet and 2 helicopter. As with many larger airports, Wittman Field's expansion over the years has necessitated the closure of nearby roadways and acquisition of nearby parcels of land. In particular, Knapp Street (running parallel to the runways) has been permanently closed near the airport to facilitate the expansion of the grounds in that area (for the annual EAA AirVenture.) The EAA has a hangar on the northwestern side of the field which does most of the maintenance, overhaul, and restoration to their many aircraft including: Bell 47, Ford Trimotor, B-25, Cessna 162s, RV-12s, and it's B-17 (Aluminum Overcast). The airport has 3 flight schools; Aviation Services, Discover Flight, and Fox Valley Technical College. In addition, the EAA offers limited sport pilot camps/classes to its members at the field. =Control Tower= The original tower at Wittman Field opened in 1963. In 2007, a new tower was built that is over twice the height of the old building. The original tower was demolished in April 2009. =Improvements= In 2015-2016 the 50 year old taxiway B was completely rebuilt with concrete pavement; as part of the project LED lighting was added to the taxiway. The airport is currently working on replacing most of taxiway A in a phased plan along runway 18/36; the project also added an entrance to a proposed South GA ramp to serve the airport's Aviation Business Park. Due to the cancelation of AirVenture 2020, the project schedule was able to be revised to allow construction to be completed by the end of 2020. On July 16, 2020, the airport began a project to replace the aging GA terminal as well as the old airline terminal built in 1958 and 1971 respectively with a new modern GA terminal. The high cost to maintain both facilities, as well as there is no chance that airline service will return to Wittman as Appleton International Airport has expanded to now serve Oshkosh leaving no need for an airline terminal as the primary reasons to replace the terminal. The new terminal is planned to open sometime in early-mid July 2021 in time for AirVenture 2021. Cargo operations Freight Runners Express offers scheduled cargo service from the airport. They utilize their Beechcraft Model 99 aircraft type for Oshkosh cargo operations. Airshow The airport is the site of the annual Experimental Aircraft Association's AirVenture Oshkosh, an experimental aircraft and sport aviation airshow. Across Knapp St. to the west lies the campus of the EAA AirVenture Museum. For the week of AirVenture Oshkosh (known locally as \\"The Airshow\\" or \\"The Fly-in\\"), Wittman Regional is the world's busiest airport by traffic movements.

Life From Harrow School he went to New College, Oxford; took first-classes in classical moderations and greats; and won the Newdigate prize for poetry (1864) and the Chancellors English essay (1868). He seemed destined for distinction as a poet, his volume of Ludibria Lunae (1869) being followed in 1870 by the remarkably fine Paradise of Birds. But a certain academic quality of mind seemed to check his output in verse and divert it into the field of criticism. Apart from many contributions to the higher journalism, his literary career is associated mainly with his continuation of the edition of Pope's works, begun by Whitwell Elwin, which appeared in ten volumes from 1871‚Äì1889; his life of Addison (Men of Letters series, 1882); his Liberal Movement in English Literature (1885); and his tenure of the professorship of Poetry at Oxford (1895‚Äì1901), which resulted in his elaborate History of English Poetry (the first volume appearing in 1895), and his Life in Poetry (1901). He published a selection from Martial's Epigrams in 1914, and a volume of verse, The Country Town and other Poems, appeared in 1920. He dealt with the history of English poetry as a whole, and in its unity as a result of the national spirit and thought in succeeding ages, and attempted to bring the great poets into relation with this. In 1887 he was appointed a civil service commissioner, being first commissioner in 1892, and being made a CB. He was made an honorary fellow of his old college at Oxford in 1896, and was given the honorary degrees of D.Litt. by Durham in 1895 and of LL.D. by Edinburgh University in 1898.

The 1938 season saw the Black Yankees trying their fate at New York's Triborough Stadium. Paterson's strong fan support returned the Black Yankees to Paterson's Hinchliffe Stadium.  Founding  The team was founded in Harlem as the Harlem Black Bombers in 1931 by financier James \\"Soldier Boy\\" Semler and dancer Bill \\"Bojangles\\" Robinson. By 1932 the team was named the Harlem Stars and by 1933 became the New York Black Yankees. The team's left fielder Fats Jenkins was chosen by fans to play in the East team for the first East-West All-Star Game in 1933. A succession of other players were sent to the big game in 1937-1942, 1947 and 1948.  Barnstorming years  The team's schedule could be punishing. In the 1930s they played two doubleheaders 350 miles apart on successive days. They left Pittsburgh after the first two games at about 10:00 PM to cross the Allegheny Mountains for South Orange, New Jersey. One of the two cars broke down so nine of the 16 players crowded into the other car to ensure that play would start on time. They arrived just twenty minutes behind the scheduled start time. They were given five minutes to warm up. The other seven players arrived a few minutes later so they were able to lunch and sleep before taking two of their exhausted team mates to play the second game. Despite their fatigue, the team won both games. In September 1933, the New York Black Yankees played the Philadelphia Stars for the Colored Championship of the Nation at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, New Jersey. They lost the championship, but not their momentum, opening the following season with an eight-game winning streak at Hinchliffe Stadium. The streak-ending ninth game with the Pittsburgh Crawfords came on July 28, 1934, a face-off that saw Hall-of-Famers Josh Gibson, Judy Johnson, James \\"Cool Papa\\" Bell, and Oscar Charleston all play in regular- season tilt. Rain ended the game after 7 1/2 innings, but not before Crawfords' star Gibson and Yankee Bob Clark had both hit powerful home runs, Gibson's contributing to his League championship home run record for that year. On July 13, 1935, Elmer McDuffy pitched an 8-0 no-hitter at Hinchliffe Stadium against the House of David. According to the Paterson Evening News, it was \\"the first time such a feat had ever been turned in by the Negro club in this territory.\\"  League play  The team played its last season, 1948, in Rochester, New York using Red Wing Stadium, home of the International League Rochester Red Wings, as their home park. After an opening day doubleheader sweep of the Newark Eagles on May 25, 1948, the team did not fare well and finished the last Negro National League season with a record of 8-32.

He is best known for his stint in World Championship Wrestling under ring name Air Paris. Professional wrestling career=Debut= On April 20, 1996, Parris made his professional wrestling debut under ring name Kid Ego, where he and Mark Pain lost to Dusty Dotson and Nasty Critter in a tag team match for the North Georgia Wrestling Alliance. One week later, Ego made his singles debut in a losing effort to Mike Golden. After losing to Jailhouse Rocker on May 10, he picked up the first win of his career by defeating Kenny D on June 21. =National Wrestling Alliance=NWA Wildside After a three-year hiatus, Parris returned to wrestling and began competing on the independent circuit, most prominently for the National Wrestling Alliance, as Air Paris. He debuted for the NWA on September 25, 1999, at their 51st anniversary show, and was unable to win a battle royal to determine the number one contender for the World Junior Heavyweight Championship. Paris appeared at the following year's anniversary show on October 14, 2000, where he and Cassidy O'Reilly lost to Bad Attitude (David Young and Rick Michaels) in a match for the World Tag Team Championship. After debuting in the NWA territory Wildside in early 1999, he soon won the territory's Junior Heavyweight Championship on May 13. However, he was stripped of the title on October 28 after being unable to defend the title in 30 days due to an injury. Paris regained the title after defeating Andy Anderson on November 4, but was once again stripped of the title in May 2000. Paris would go on to win his first and only Television Championship after defeating Eddie Golden on January 6, 2001, but lost the title to A.J. Styles that same night. Music City Wrestling / NWA Main Event In addition to Wildside, Paris began competing for Music City Wrestling and Main Event, two other NWA territories. While in MCW, he won the North American Championship. Meanwhile, in Main Event, he reformed his tag team with Cassidy O'Reilly and together, they won the North American Tag Team Championship on August 14, 1999. They later lost the title on November 27 to New South (Ashley Hudson and Cory Williams). Chase Stevens later replaced Paris in the tag team due to Paris signing a developmental deal with World Championship Wrestling in 2000. Despite being contracted to WCW, Paris returned to Main Event and won the North American Tag Team Title for the second time, this time with Big Bully Douglas, on April 14, 2000. They held the title until September of that year before it was vacated due to Paris and Douglas splitting. =World Championship Wrestling (2001)= After being signed to a deal with World Championship Wrestling in 2000, Parris, under his Air Paris name, debuted for the promotion alongside former NWA Wildside rival A.J. Styles on the February 14, 2001, episode of Thunder, where they lost to Evan Karagias and Jamie Noble. Paris and Styles gained their first and only win in WCW when they scored an upset against former World Tag Team Champions The Boogie Knights (Alex Wright and Disco Inferno) the following week on Thunder. Paris and Styles made their Nitro debut on the March 5 episode, there they lost to Elix Skipper and Kid Romeo. On the final episode of Thunder on March 21, Styles was renamed to Air Styles and together the team was given the new name Air Raid as they went on to lose to The Jung Dragons. When WCW was bought out by the World Wrestling Federation, neither Paris nor Styles had their contracts picked up by the WWF. =Independent circuit= After the closures of both WCW and NWA Wildside, Paris returned to competing on the Georgia independent circuit, and wrestled his final match in the Rings of Glory promotion on December 16, 2005. On May 1, 2008, he returned to wrestling under his Air Paris name and joined the promotion NAWA Ring Champions as a booker and wrestler. NAWA Ring Champions Upon debuting, Paris was given a match for any NAWA championship of his choosing by Commissioner Ted Guinness, but was subsequently attacked by The Exotic Ones (Simon Sermon and Rick Michaels), the promotion's Tag Team Champions. On May 15, Paris teamed with Cruiserweight Champion Chris Ganz to face The Exotic Ones for the Tag Team Championship, but were unsuccessful in winning the title. After the match, Paris turned on Ganz by utilizing the title match he received from Guinness and defeated Ganz to win the Cruiserweight Championship, resulting in Paris becoming a heel in the process. After vacating the Cruiserweight Title, Paris began feuding with Ganz and faced him on June 5 in a tag team match, but was unsuccessful as he and Jason Valentine lost to Ganz and Tommy Rich. On July 3, their feud culminated when Paris and Bobby Eaton were defeated by Ganz and Ricky Morton. Purks International Championship Wrestling In 2009, Parris left NAWA Ring Champions and joined Purks International Championship Wrestling as a booker and wrestler. He made his in-ring debut for the promotion on December 16 as a heel, where he and Bobby Hayes lost to The Steiner Brothers. After the match, Paris shook hands with the Steiner Brothers, becoming a face in the process, but was attacked by Hayes until being saved by the Steiner Brothers. On February 6, 2010, Paris teamed with David Young and Ron Simmons to face Hayes, Terry Lawler and Alexander the Great, but lost after Young turned on Paris by attacking him. On March 6, Paris wrestled against former tag team partner and then-TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles in a non-title match, which ended in a no-contest due to outside interference. Paris then continued his feud with Hayes and Young and defeated them in a tag team match with Kevin Nash as his partner on April 10. After the match, Hayes piledrove Paris before Young did the same, injuring him in the process. Despite being injured, Paris returned on June 12 during a triple threat match for the Heavyweight Championship between Hayes, Young and Chris Harris and helped Harris defeat Hayes and Young to win the Heavyweight Title. On February 12, 2011, Paris teamed with Terry Lawler to defeat Hayes and Young in a tag team match. Other media In 2013, Parris was announced as being one of the contributors to Phenomenal, the autobiography of former tag team partner A.J. Styles.

This sense of the term \\"reduction\\" does not imply any sort of removal or quantitative decrease but rather implies a restoration: re (\\"back [to initial position]\\") + ducere (\\"lead\\"/\\"bring\\"), i.e., \\"bringing back to normal\\". When a bone fractures, the fragments lose their alignment in the form of displacement or angulation. For the fractured bone to heal without any deformity the bony fragments must be re-aligned to their normal anatomical position. Orthopedic surgery attempts to recreate the normal anatomy of the fractured bone by reduction of the displacement. Reduction could be by \\"closed\\" or \\"open\\" methods: * Open reduction is where the fracture fragments are exposed surgically by dissecting the tissues. * Closed reduction is the manipulation of the bone fragments without surgical exposure of the fragments. Because the process of reduction can briefly be intensely painful, it is commonly done under a short-acting anesthetic, sedative, or nerve block. Once the fragments are reduced, the reduction is maintained by application of casts, traction, or held by plates, screws, or other implants, which may in turn be external or internal. It is very important to verify the accuracy of reduction by clinical tests and X-ray, especially in the case of joint dislocations.

John Williamson Nevin (February 20, 1803June 6, 1886), was an American theologian and educationalist. He was born in the Cumberland Valley, near Shippensburg, Franklin County, Pennsylvania. He was the father of noted sculptor and poet Blanche Nevin. Biography He was a nephew of Hugh Williamson of North Carolina, and was of Scottish blood and Presbyterian training. He graduated at Union College in 1821; studied theology at Princeton Theological Seminary in 1823‚Äì1828, being in 1826‚Äì28 in charge of the classes of Charles Hodge; was licensed to preach by the Carlisle Presbytery in 1828; and in 1830‚Äì1840 was professor of Biblical literature in the newly founded Western Theological Seminary (now Pittsburgh Theological Seminary) of Allegheny, Pennsylvania. But under the influence of Neander, he was gradually breaking away from \\"Puritanic Presbyterianism\\", and, in 1840, having resigned his chair in Allegheny, he was appointed professor of theology in the (German Reformed) Theological Seminary at Mercersburg, and thus passed from the Presbyterian Church into the German Reformed Church. He soon became prominent: first by his contributions to its organ, the Messenger; then by The Anxious Bench‚ÄîA Tract for the Times (1843), attacking the vicious excesses of revivalistic methods; and by his defence of the inauguration address, The Principle of Protestantism, delivered by his colleague Philip Schaff, which aroused a storm of protest by its suggestion that Pauline Protestantism was not the last word in the development of the church but that a Johannine Christianity was to be its out-growth, and by its recognition of Petrine Romanism as a stage in ecclesiastical development. To Dr. Schaff's 122 theses of The Principle of Protestantism Nevin added his own theory of the mystical union between Christ and believers, and both Schaff and Nevin were accused of a \\"Romanizing tendency\\". Nevin characterized his critics as pseudo- Protestants, urged (with Dr. Charles Hodge, and against the Presbyterian General Assembly) the validity of Roman Catholic baptism, and defended the doctrine of the \\"spiritual real presence\\" of Christ in the Lord's Supper, notably in The Mystical Presence: a Vindication of the Reformed or Calvinistic Doctrine of the Holy Eucharist (1846); to this Charles Hodge replied from the point of view of rationalistic puritanism in the Princeton Review of 1848. In 1849, the Mercersburg Review was founded as the organ of Nevin and the \\"Mercersburg Theology\\"; and to it he contributed from 1849 to 1883. In 1851, he resigned from the Mercersburg Seminary in order that its running expenses might be lightened; and from 1841 to 1853 he was president of Marshall College at Mercersburg. With Dr. Schaff and others, he was on the committee which prepared the liturgy of the German Reformed Church, which appeared in provisional form in 1857 and as An Order of Worship in 1866. In 1861‚Äì1866, he was instructor of history at Franklin and Marshall College (into which Marshall College had been merged), of which he was president in 1866‚Äì1876. He died in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on June 6, 1886.

He said, \\"I knew in my bones that these performers and their composers were expressing their sheer joy in life through their music.\\" Benjamin's interest persisted in ragtime, the first popular music conceived and created by Americans in an era where popular songs were brought over from Germany or England.Decator Herald and Review. \\"Strange circumstances lead to Ragtime Orchestra's genesis\\" by David Burke. September 19, 1997. Formation of the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra=Discovery of the Music of Arthur Pryor= Benjamin went to Juilliard with intentions to make his living playing the tuba. When his jaw was wired shut after his teeth were inadvertently shattered during a tooth extraction, he found himself temporarily unable to play that instrument and instead focused on writing a research paper on Arthur Pryor, an 1890s trombonist, conductor and music director.The East Carolinian. \\"Paragon Ragtime comes to ECU\\" by Laura Pekarek. March 11, 2004. Pryor was an influential figure in the early history of the Victrola, as he had served as first conductor for the company that produced them, Victor Talking Machine Co., and had accordingly been able to decide himself what recordings were released for the machine. Benjamin learned that an old theater in Asbury, New Jersey that was scheduled for demolition housed Pryor's personal collection of over 4,000 pieces of music and was given permission to take it. While Benjamin did not immediately understand the value of this collection, which was thought to have been destroyed,New York Times. \\"Review/Ragtime; From a Trove Of Rediscovered Joplin et al.\\" by Allan Kozinn. March 24, 1988. he soon realized that among the collection were many rare musical scores and manuscripts, including unknown compositions by such composers as Scott Joplin, W.C. Handy, Edward MacDowell, Victor Herbert, Jerome Kern and John Philip Sousa. New World Classics. \\"Why a New Version of Treemonish?\\" by Rick Benjamin. In a 1997 interview with the Herald & Review, he explained the presence of these rare pieces: \\"Anybody who was anybody in that era would send their scores to Mr. Pryor in hopes that they would be recorded\\" for Victrola. =Controversy over Initial Concert at Juilliard= In 1986 Benjamin decided to form a 14-piece orchestra of fellow Juilliard students to perform the music as it had been originally arranged during the period.New York Times. \\"Outdoors, Concert Fare That's Serious And Rare\\" by Allan Kozinn. July 20, 1990.San Francisco Chronicle. \\"How Joplin heard America singing\\" by Jesse Hamlin. June 21, 2003. Benjamin made a request to Juilliard to perform a concert of turn-of-the-20th- century American composers but his request was rejected by Juilliard's dean, who felt Juilliard should focus on traditional composers.Stamford Advocate. \\"Orchestra performs soundtrack to Buster Keaton films\\" by Nadia Lerner. January 4, 2007. Benjamin scheduled a Mozart program on solo tuba at a concert hall, but instead led a group in performing ragtime music, leaving open the doors to draw in a wider crowd. Before a full house, Benjamin's group played selections by Irving Berlin and Victor Herbert, the W.C. Handy's \\"Memphis Blues\\" and Joplin's \\"Peacherine Two-Step.\\" One witness to the event, Juilliard professor Vincent Persichetti, approached Benjamin after the concert was over to encourage him to make it his \\"life's work\\" to preserve \\"America's original music.\\" The concert did not go over well with the dean, who put Benjamin on probation for it, but it had a much more positive impact on Grammy award winning Columbia Records executive Thomas Frost, who to Benjamin's surprise was given a recording of the concert and had within a matter of weeks arranged for the first album of the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra to be released. Benjamin quit Juilliard without fanfare and has since devoted himself to his orchestra. =Lincoln Center Debut= Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra made their New York debut at the Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center in March 1988 with a program consisting of a medley of music from the 1890s and 21 songs from the period ranging 1905 to 1920 which Benjamin had found among Pryor's papers. Allan Kozinn for the New York Times remarked particularly on the variety of the \\"abidingly energetic fun\\" performance, which included \\"a concert waltz, a maxixe, one-steps, two-steps, foxtrots and blues, and, of course, numerous rags, some quite picturesque.\\" Musical Activities Rick Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra perform the Mark of Zorro starring Douglas Fairbanks at the Poncan Theatre in Ponca City Oklahoma on October 4, 2008. =Oh, You Kid!= In February 1999, Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra premiered Oh, You Kid! at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, in collaboration with the Paul Taylor Dance Company.New York Times. \\"Footlights\\" by Lawrence Van Gelder. February 17, 1999. The work was commissioned under the Doris Duke Millennium Awards for Modern Dance and Jazz Music of the Kennedy Center and American Dance Festival, which promotes such pairings. Anna Kisselgoff wrote in the New York Times that the show was \\"exuberant romp to ragtime music.\\"New York Times. \\" DANCE REVIEW; Fast and Loose in the Age of Ragtime\\" by Anna Kisselgoff. February 22, 1999. =Treemonisha= In June 2003 Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra premiered their version of Scott Joplin's opera Treemonisha at the Stern Grove Festival, the oldest festival of its kind in the United States, hosted in an amphitheater in San Francisco.Stern Grove Festival Web Site. Treemonisha had originally premiered in 1975 with full professional staging by the Houston Grand Opera, but Benjamin thought that the Houston staging was \\"too heavy, too Verdiesque\\" and spent nearly half of a decade altering it to suit the kind of 12-piece theater pit orchestra prevalent in Joplin's day. In October 2005 Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra premiered his version of Treemonisha on the East Coast at Wake Forest University.Wake Forest University. \\"Rousing ragtime 'Treemonisha' comes to WFU\\" by Pam Barrett. October 12, 2005. Benjamin has expressed his hope that his simpler orchestration will allow the material to be presented in more modest venues, indicating that Joplin never intended for the \\"opera\\" to depend on a large orchestra. Describing the work as \\"unpretentious\\", he notes that the opera \\"is much more an amalgamation of the well-established American traditions of vaudeville, tab-show, melodrama, and minstrelsy, all held together by Joplin's marvelous music.\\" He told the Wake Forest University newspaper that Joplin's \\"real dream was to give everyday people the opportunity, perhaps their only one, to experience opera on their own terms in the music halls and neighborhood theaters.\\" In another interview, for the San Francisco Chronicle, Benjamin indicated that Joplin was probably himself barred from opera during his day because he was black, but expressed his belief that Joplin realized opera's ability to speak to the public. He has recently recorded the opera with new world records. =Silent Movie Performances= Benjamin has an extensive collection of period cinema- orchestra scores which his orchestra performs along with broadcasting of the films they were created to accompany. Silent movies for which they perform the score include Buster Keaton's Cops, Harold Lloyd's Never Weaken, and Charlie Chaplin's The Immigrant. Another movie that Benjamin performs with his orchestra is 'The Mark Of Zorro' starring Douglas Fairbanks. Benjamin has expressed surprise that \\"Generation X\\" has responded so favorably to the music, suggesting in 1997 that younger listeners may resist the more commercially oriented music \\"crammed down their throats.\\" =Other Musical Activities= Benjamin and his orchestra also have performed for diverse radio programs on New York Times' WQXR, National Public Radio, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and the Voice of America networks, and Benjamin has conducted the Aalborg Symphony Orchestra (Denmark), the RT√â National Symphony Orchestra, Olympia Symphony in Washington State, the New Jersey Symphony, the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, the Washington Performing Arts Society, the Brucknerhaus in Linz, Austria. Benjamin is a touring lecturer and a published author and wrote liner notes on New World Records http://www.newworldrecords.org/album.cgi?rm=view&album;_id=80293 In addition to curating the collection of Arthur Prior, Benjamin also curates the collections of Simone Mantia, B.F. Alart, and Frank H. Wells and has worked with archivists and historians including Thornton 'Tony Hagert's Vernacular Music Research =Awards and honors= In the World's Fair held in Seville, Spain, Benjamin and his orchestra were the \\"Ambassador of Goodwill.\\" Composition of Benjamin's Paragon Ragtime Orchestra Leslie Cullen plays flute and piccolo for the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra at a performance at Hesston College in Hesston, Kansas in October, 2008. Because orchestras by their nature and tradition are much more fluid in regards to personnel, there are 36 players on the payroll of the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra and their appearance at a particular performance depends on a wide variety of criteria including the number of players called for by the score(s) to be performed. The score for the silent motion picture Zorro was written for 12 instruments while the orchestra's ragtime program is scored for 10 or 11 players, depending on the publisher and arranger. The main set-up for a theater orchestra of the era was 5 strings, 1 flute, 1/2 clarinets, 1/2 cornets, 1 trombone, Piano/Conductor and percussion. Variations on the instrumentation depended on the publisher of the music, and of the arrangement. Some of the orchestra's programs of historic theater music call for from 25 to 30 musicians and some of the grand silent film scores call for over 70 players, so the orchestra has to hire out when they perform these programs. The Road Manager for the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra is Leslie Cullen who also plays flute and piccolo and has been a member of the orchestra since 1989. Cullen studied at the Juilliard School and is an adjunct at Bucknell University. Bucknell University. \\"Faculty and Staff\\" Cullen has appeared at the Ravinia Festival, The Kennedy Center, Chautauqua, and the Smithsonian Institution. Cullen is a native of Lawton, Oklahoma and was the former artist-in-residence for the State Arts Council of Oklahoma. Cullen has also played with the Royale Trio and the Linden Woodwind Quintet. Lycoming College. \\"Bach and Blues\\" Concert at Lycoming College. October 14, 2004. Personal life In addition to his work with his orchestra, Benjamin lectures at Bucknell University, near his home in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Benjamin was greatly encouraged in his musical career by his grandfather, J. Edward Smith, who played violin, clarinet & piano, among other instruments, throughout his life, and was a musician with the Monmouth Symphony Orchestra, in Monmouth County, NJ, for many years until his death. Benjamin and the Paragon Ragtime Orchestra continue to perform regularly in Monmouth County, NJ venues, where both grandfather and grandson lived.

Frye defines this term using Shakespeare's romantic comedies as the foundation. In Anatomy of Criticism, Frye describes the Green World as \\"the archetypal function of literature in visualizing the world of desire, not as an escape from \\"reality,\\" but as the genuine form of the world that human life tries to imitate.\\" The plots of these comedies often follow the formula of action starting in the normal world and then progressing to an alternate one in which the conflict is resolved before returning to the normal world. The plot of the Shakespearean romantic comedy is built upon the tradition established by the medieval \\"season ritual-play,\\" the plots of which thematically deal with the triumph of love over the wasteland. The concept of the Green World is used to contrast the civilized world of man with the often harsh natural world. Presence in Literature As noted in Frye's Anatomy of Criticism, the \\"drama of the green world\\" is embodied in the works of William Shakespeare. The thematic tones of the plays contain the overarching appearance of humanity eclipsing the natural worlds displayed. =In Shakespearean Works= A Midsummer Night's Dream serves as an exploration of the green world through the fairies' interference in the romantic entanglement of the Athenian lovers. The majority of the play's action takes place in the woods outside of Theseus' Athens, with Shakespeare primarily using Athens to frame the narrative in civilization. The woods of A Midsummer Night's Dream serves as an analogy to a dream-like world created out of our desires that serves to contrast the \\"stumbling and blinded follies of the world of experience.\\" In the more urban setting of Romeo and Juliet, the green world becomes associated with the intimacy of romantic emotion and is notable in its \\"protracted absences.\\" Romeo journeys in solitary walks into the woods surrounding Verona to lament his ill-fated romance with Rosaline and remove him from a world occupied by more human matters. As You Like It, also contains considerable references to the green world. The Forest of Arden is both idealized through the usage of pastoral terms, but is also depicted in a way that shows how humans manipulate and exploit it. While the play makes use of typical pastoral motifs in describing the forest, these are often juxtaposed with images of the wood as a wild place‚Äìshowing a dialectic tension between the new inhabitants and long standing forest. The Two Gentlemen of Verona, also exhibits signs of the literary green world. The comedy's protagonist, Valentine, enters the woods and shortly becomes the leader of a band of outlaws; afterwards, however, the other characters all venture out into the forest and become converted. As Frye notes using this example: \\"...the action of the comedy begins in a world represented by as a normal world, moves into the green world, goes into a metamorphosis there in which the comic resolution is achieved, and returns to the normal world.\\" =In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight= In Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, The Green Knight is completely green, right down to his skin: he is \\"nature anthropomorphized.\\" He challenges King Arthur's court by accusing them of being too indulgent rather than courageous. Sir Gawain must travel through winter's brutal conditions to arrive at Bertilak's court, which is described [by... ] as the \\"antithesis of winter.\\" Despite Sir Gawain being attacked by \\"unnamed giants,\\" it is made clear that the greatest threat to his survival is the harsh winter landscape as made evident in line 726 of the poem: \\"For werre wrathed hym not so much √æat wynter nas wors.\\" Upon entering this alternate world, Sir Gawain is surrounded by abundance and warmth. The Green World is represented both by the frightening challenge made by the Green Knight, as well as by the refuge of Bertilak's court. Nature's cruel forcefulness as well as its power to protect are aspects of the Green World, as it offers an alternate reality in which a problem is resolved. The Green Knight, representing nature, threatens the comfortable lives of the members of King Arthur's court. The Green Chapel is described as a bare wasteland which shows another way in which nature is presented.

The UK edition retailed at twelve shillings and sixpence (12/6) and the US edition at $2.95. A crucial witness is unaware of his role as such until two years after a man is found guilty of a murder. When he realizes the information he holds, he re-opens the pain of loss in a family, and re-opens the question of who was the murderer two years ago. This novel received mixed reviews at the time of publication, as reviewers were not generally comfortable with the psychological aspects of the story. The plot had her \\"customary ingenuity\\" but lacked \\"blitheness\\" and was \\"much too like an attempt at psychological fiction\\". Sympathy is evoked for too many characters, \\"but the unravelling is sound and the story well told.\\" Another said there is ingenuity and a good ending, but the plot \\"lacks a central focus\\" and it appears that the \\"serious socio-psychological approach doesn't suit\\" Christie's writing. A later review considered it one of the better Christie novels of the 1950s, and noted that the author sometimes called it her own favourite. Plot summary Jacko Argyle dies in prison while serving a sentence for killing his adoptive mother Rachel Argyle. His own widow, Maureen, believed him to have been responsible. Jacko's alibi failed when police could not find the man who had given him a ride to the next town as the murder was happening. Two years later, Jacko's alibi suddenly appears and the family must come to terms not only with the fact that Jacko was innocent, but also with suspicion falling upon each of them as the real murderer. Some realize there is a murderer living among them, raising tensions among the family. Suspicions fall on his father, his brother Mickey, his sisters Hester, Mary and Tina, even his father‚Äôs secretary and the long-time housekeeper Kirsten, as the new investigations proceed. The witness, Arthur Calgary, was unaware of the trial as he was out of the country and thus failed to come forward. He believes the Argyle family will be grateful when he clears their son's name but fails to realise that this means another member of the household must have murdered Rachel. However, having provided Jacko's alibi, he is determined to protect the innocent by finding the murderer. Calgary visits retired local doctor, Dr MacMaster, to ask him about Jacko. MacMaster says that he was surprised when Jacko was convicted for killing Rachel, not because murder was outside Jacko's 'moral range', but because he thought Jacko would be too cowardly to kill somebody; that, if he wanted to murder somebody, he would hire an accomplice. Calgary speaks to Maureen, who reveals Jacko's persuasive ways with older women: initiating affairs and then taking money from them. While the police and Calgary gather new information and seek the murderer, Mickey plans to meet with Tina, as he knows she had heard something that night, which seemed irrelevant back then. It is Philip Durrant, husband of Mary Argyle, whose efforts to find the guilty one among them force the killer to strike again. Tina comes to Sunny Point to meet with Philip. As she reaches his room, Kirsten is at the door with a tray, and they see that Philip is dead at his desk. Tina walks until she collapses outdoors where Mickey sees her, thinks she fainted, and carries her inside. Doctor Craig arrives and sees that Tina has been stabbed in the back and must go to hospital. Hester tells Calgary about Philip and Tina. Calgary heads to Superintendent Huish, who repeats the words Tina spoke in hospital, that the cup was empty, Philip's cup, meaning Kirsten was leaving not entering the room. At Sunny Point, Calgary reveals to all, in the library, that the killer is the housekeeper, Kirsten. Jacko had persuaded the plain Kirsten that he was in love with her, and persuaded her to murder Mrs Argyle to steal some much needed money, money his mother would not give him. When Kirsten learned that Jacko was secretly married, meeting his wife the day after the murder, Kirsten realized what a fool she had been and sees the evil in Jacko. Kirsten runs away, and the family expect the police will nab her. While Mary mourns her beloved husband, her sister Hester professes her love for Arthur Calgary. She suspects that Tina and Mickey will get together once Tina recovers. Leo feels free once again to remarry.

Literary significance and reception Philip John Stead concluded his review in the Times Literary Supplement of 12 December 1958, with, \\"The solution of Ordeal By Innocence is certainly not below the level of Mrs Christie's customary ingenuity, but the book lacks other qualities which her readers have come to expect. What has become of the blitheness, the invigorating good spirits with which the game of detection is played in so many of her stories? Ordeal By Innocence slips out of that cheerful arena into something much too like an attempt at psychological fiction. It is too much of a conversation piece and too many people are talking ‚Äì people in whom it is hard to take the necessary amount of interest because there is not enough space to establish them. The kind of workmanship which has been lavished on this tale is not a kind in which the author excels and the reader feels that Miss Marple and Poirot would thoroughly disapprove of the whole business.\\" Sarah Russell of The Guardian gave a short review to the novel in the 9 December 1958 issue when she said, \\"In this solving of a two-year-old family murder sympathy is, unusually with Miss Christie, evoked for too many people to leave enough suspects; but the unravelling is sound and the story well told.\\" Maurice Richardson said of this novel that \\"The veteran Norn has nodded over this one. There is ingenuity, of course, but it lacks a central focus. The characters are stodgy and there is little of that so readable, almost crunchable dialogue, like burnt sugar.\\" He concluded, \\"The serious socio-psychological approach doesn't suit A C somehow. Only at the end with the big surprise do you feel home and dry.\\" Robert Barnard considered this novel as \\"One of the best of 'fifties Christies, and one of her own favourites (though she named different titles at different times). The Five Little Pigs pattern of murder-in-the-past, the convicted murderer having died in prison, innocent. [sic]‚Äù His evaluation was that it was ‚ÄúShort on detection, but fairly dense in social observation. Understanding in treatment of adopted children, but not altogether tactful on the colour question: 'Tina's always the dark horse‚Ä¶Perhaps it's the half of her that isn't white.'\\" Adaptations=Film= ;Ordeal by Innocence (1985) A film adaptation was released in 1985, directed by Desmond Davis. It starred Donald Sutherland as Arthur Calgary, Sarah Miles as Mary Durrant, Christopher Plummer as Leo Argyle, Ian McShane as Philip Durrant, Diana Quick as Gwenda Vaughan, and Faye Dunaway as Rachel Argyle. The film's musical score by Dave Brubeck was criticised as inappropriate for its style of mystery. Brubeck had taken over from Pino Donaggio, who had already composed many pieces for the project, but was too busy to work on the project when various film edits needed re-scoring. His original score had swirling strings, lush melodies and tension-filled passages. =Television= ;Agatha Christie's Marple (2007) The novel was adapted for the third season of the ITV television series Marple featuring Geraldine McEwan as the eponymous Miss Marple in 2007, although the character was not in the original novel. She appears as Gwenda's guest for the forth- coming wedding and knew Gwenda as a child. The episode guest-starred Denis Lawson as Leo, Stephanie Leonidas as Hester, Lisa Stansfield as Mary, and Jane Seymour as Rachel. This version changed considerably from the novel, such as having Jacko (Burn Gorman) executed by hanging, rather than dying in prison of natural causes. Gwenda Vaughan (Juliet Stevenson) takes Philip Durrant's (Richard Armitage) place as the household member who fatefully decides to investigate and comes too close to the truth, and is subsequently murdered by the killer, Kirsten (Alison Steadman). Omitted completely is Kirsten's attempt to silence Tina (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) and Micky (Bryan Dick) by stabbing Tina. There is also the addition of another adopted child, Bobby (Tom Riley), the twin brother of Jacko, who commits suicide after financial ruin. Kirsten is shown being arrested at the end, unlike in the original novel in which her arrest was not explicitly included in the actual text. ;Ordeal by Innocence (2018) BBC One broadcast a three-episode series based on Ordeal by Innocence in 2018. It was filmed in Inverkip, Scotland, and stars Bill Nighy as Leo Argyll (changed from \\"Argyle\\" in the novel), Luke Treadaway as Arthur Calgary, Anna Chancellor as Rachel Argyll, Ella Purnell as Hester Argyll, Eleanor Tomlinson as Mary Durrant, Crystal Clarke as Tina Argyll, Morven Christie as Kirsten Lindstrom, Matthew Goode as Philip Durrant, Alice Eve as Gwenda Vaughan, and Anthony Boyle as Jack Argyll. The script was written by Sarah Phelps, who also adapted the Christie miniseries And Then There Were None and The Witness for the Prosecution for the BBC. First scheduled to air in 2017, the series was delayed due to sexual allegations against actor Ed Westwick, who was originally cast as Mickey Argyll, which led to Westwick's scenes being reshot with Christian Cooke as Mickey. The series features many differences from the original novel, including the ending, where the killer is revealed to be Leo instead of Kirsten. Additionally, Jack is depicted as having no involvement with Rachel's murder and is the biological son of Leo and Kirsten, resulting in Leo having him beaten to death in prison when he threatens to reveal his true parentage. The series also portrays Calgary as a former mental patient, which causes doubts toward his testimony as Jack's alibi. =Stage= The novel was also adapted into a stage play by Mary Jane Hansen performed for the first time by the New York State Theatre Institute in Troy, New York. The original run lasted from 4 to 17 February 2007, and included 14 performances. =Comics= Ordeal by Innocence was released by HarperCollins as a graphic novel adaptation on 1 July 2008, adapted and illustrated by \\"Chandre\\" (). This was translated from the edition first published in France by Emmanuel Proust √©ditions in 2006 under the title of T√©moin ind√©sirable. =Radio= The BBC produced a radio adaptation by Joy Wilkinson, starring Mark Umbers as Arthur Calgary and Jacqueline Defferary as Gwenda. It was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 over three weeks beginning 17 March 2014.

Biography=Assembly and Convention= Born in Saint- Maixent-l'√âcole (Deux-S√®vres), he was elected deputy for his d√©partement to the Legislative Assembly in 1792, where he made himself known for his harsh stances against the moderates. He was elected to the National Convention in the same year, voting in favor the capital punishment for King Louis XVI, with the possibility of appeal to the people. His association with the Girondists nearly involved him in their fall of May‚ÄìJune 1793, despite Lecointe- Puyraveau's extreme Republicanism - he had placed his position in peril after publicly accusing Jean-Paul Marat for having instigated the September Massacres, and even called him \\"demented\\", but had not voted in favor of his prosecution. At the precise moment of the Girondists' proscription, Lecointe- Puyraveau was representative on mission to the Vend√©e, and, back in Paris during the Reign of Terror, remained an inconspicuous presence in the face of the Committee of Public Safety. =Directory, Empire, and proscription= He took part in the Thermidorian Reaction which brought down Maximilien Robespierre, but protested against the establishment of the Directory, and continually pressed for severer measures against the √©migr√©s, and even their relatives who had remained in France. He was secretary and then president of the Council of Five Hundred, and under the French Consulate a member of the Tribunate. Lecointe-Puyraveau took no part in public affairs under the First French Empire, but was Lieutenant General of police for south-east France during the Hundred Days. After the 1815 battle of Waterloo he took ship from Toulon, but the ship was driven back by a storm and he narrowly escaped a disastrous shipwreck at Marseille. After six weeks imprisonment in the Ch√¢teau d'If, he returned to Paris, escaping, after the proscription of the regicides (those who had voted for the death of the previous king), to Brussels, where he died a decade later.

The UK edition retailed at twelve shillings and sixpence (12/6), and the US edition at $2.95. It features Christie's Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, who makes a very late appearance in the final third of the novel. The emphasis on espionage in the early part of the story relates it to Christie's international adventures (such as They Came to Baghdad) and to the Tommy and Tuppence stories. Plot summary A revolution takes place within Ramat, a fictional kingdom in the Middle East. Before their deaths, Prince Ali Yusuf entrusts his pilot, Bob Rawlinson, to smuggle a fortune in jewels out of the country. These are concealed in the luggage of his sister, Joan Sutcliffe, and her daughter Jennifer. Unbeknown to him, a mysterious woman watches him conceal them from the balcony of a neighbouring room. Three months later, Jennifer prepares to attend Meadowbank School, a prestigious girls' prep school in England. Its staff includes Miss Bulstrode, the school's founder and headmistress; Miss Chadwick, a co-founder of the school; Miss Vansittart, a teacher for several years; Miss Rich, a teacher for eighteen months; Miss Johnson, the girl's matron; Ang√®le Blanche, the new French teacher; Grace Springer, the new gym teacher; Ann Shapland, Bulstrode's new secretary; and Adam Goodman, the new gardener. Bulstrode is nearing retirement, so she decides to seek a successor. As Chadwick is considered to be too old, Bulstrode is left to choose between Vansittart, whom many believe she will choose, and Rich, who is young and has many ideas. One night, Springer is found by Johnson and Chadwick, shot dead in the Sports Pavilion. When the police begin to investigate, Goodman reveals to Inspector Kelsey, and later to Bulstrode, that he works for British Intelligence - he is at Meadowbank to track down the gems Rawlinson smuggled out, while monitoring Princess Shaista, Ali Yusuf's cousin, who is attending the school for this term. During the investigation, Jennifer complains that her racquet feels unbalanced since being abroad, and switches it for that of her friend Julia Upjohn, while she awaits a new one. Later, a woman gives Jennifer a new racquet to replace her current one, claiming it is from her Aunt Gina. However, the sharper Julia suspects this is not the case as the two girls had swapped racquets, and Aunt Gina later writes to reveal that she had not sent her niece the new racquet. The following weekend, Shaista is kidnapped by someone posing as her uncle's chauffeur, while on the night of the kidnapping, Vansittart is murdered with a sandbag in the Sports Pavilion. While many of the girls are sent home, Julia investigates Jennifer's racquet, and finds the smuggled jewels within a hollow in the handle. When someone attempts to enter her room during the night, she quickly flees the school to tell her story to Hercule Poirot, a friend of a friend of her mother. Arriving at Meadowbank to investigate the murders, he learns that Blanche had been recently murdered with a sandbag - the police suspect she knew the killer's identity and attempted blackmail. Interviewing Bulstrode, he learns that she believed Julia's mother Mrs Upjohn, who had served in military intelligence, had noticed someone at the school on Parent's Day whom she recalled seeing from fifteen years ago. Poirot eventually reveals to all that the Shaista who attended Meadowbank was an imposter; the real Shaista was kidnapped by a group seeking Ali Yusuf's jewels. When the imposter couldn't find them, the group extracted her before the police presence at the school exposed her. Poirot then explains that the motive for the murders was the missing gems, whereupon he denounces Ann Shapland as the killer - she had been in Ramat three months ago and was the woman who had witnessed Rawlinson concealing the gems in Jennifer's racquet. Poirot reveals that Springer was killed because she caught Shapland searching for the racquet, while Blanche was killed for her attempted blackmail in regards to the Springer murder. Through Mrs Upjohn, Poirot identifies her as a ruthless espionage agent known as \\"Angelica\\". Before Shapland is arrested, she attempts to shoot Mrs Upjohn; Bulstrode tries to shield her, but Chadwick steps in faster to shield both and is fatally wounded. Shapland is disarmed and taken away. Poirot reveals that the second murder was not Shapland's work. Although she had killed the would- be blackmailer Mlle Blanche in the same manner to make a link between the two, she had an airtight alibi for Vansittart's killing. That was done by Chadwick, who was jealous of Vansittart as Bulstrode's chosen successor. Chadwick found her in the Sports Pavilion and struck her down in a fit of madness. Before dying, Chadwick confesses to Bulstrode. In the aftermath of the investigation, Bulstrode appoints Rich as her successor, with both focusing on rebuilding Meadowbank. Meanwhile, Poirot turns over the gems to Mr Robinson to be delivered to an English woman who had secretly married Ali Yusuf when he was a student, with Julia receiving one of them as a reward.

Fontana Books, 1990; References or allusions=References to other works= In Chapter 17, III, of the novel, Julia tells Poirot that she has been told of him by Maureen Summerhayes, at whose rather dilapidated guest house he had been forced to stay during the case related in Mrs. McGinty's Dead. Also, a \\"Miss Bulstrode\\" is mentioned in a later Poirot novel with a strong school-girl plot, Hallowe'en Party. =References to actual history, geography and current science= In Chapter 13, II, of the novel, mention is made of popular British comedy actress Joyce Grenfell. In 1957, Grenfell had appeared in Blue Murder at St Trinian's, a comedy set in a girls' school with a plot that includes a jewel thief and a foreign prince. The location of the fictional Sheikdom of Ramat is not revealed in the novel, but by some hints (proximity to Aden and mountains) it is likely that Ramat was one of numerous principalities of south Yemen which still existed at the time when the book was finished. Sheik Ali Yusuf of Ramat was a graduate of an unnamed English public school. Agatha Christie spent considerable time in Iraq, whose last King, Feisal II, was a graduate of Harrow. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations An adaptation of the novel was made for the series Agatha Christie's Poirot on 28 September 2008, starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. The cast included Dame Harriet Walter as Miss Bulstrode, Natasha Little as Ann Shapland, Claire Skinner as Miss Rich, Susan Wooldridge as Miss Chadwick, Miranda Raison as Mlle Blanche, Elizabeth Berrington as Miss Springer, Katie Leung as Hsui Tai Wan, Raji James as Prince Ali Yusuf, and Adam Croasdell as Adam Goodman. Written by Mark Gatiss, the adaptation featured a change in setting to the 1930s, matching that for the TV series, which meant that many of the novel's scenes set in Egypt and the Middle East, as well as those related to the British secret service had to be rewritten or eliminated. As such, the adaptation features a significant number of plot changes: * The characters of Miss Vansittart, Henry Sutcliffe, Colonel Ephraim Pikeaway, John Edmundson, Derek O'Connor, \\"Mr Robinson\\", Denis Rathbone, and Miss Rowan are omitted from the story. * Poirot is an old friend of Miss Bulstrode and visiting the school as a guest speaker for an award ceremony. After the ceremony, he agrees to remain to help Bulstrode determine who should succeed her when she retires. He is thus present when the murder of Springer occurs, while Julia comes to his room when she finds the smuggled gems. * Both Rawlinson and Ali Yusuf are killed in a shootout during the revolution as opposed to a plane crash triggered by sabotage. The jewels that are smuggled out are all rubies. * Grace Springer's character is more sadistic and bullying, with a habit for blackmail. She is murdered by Shapland with a javelin. Miss Blake is revealed to be one of her victims. * Jennifer Sutcliffe's parents have their house burgled before the school's new term begins. Jennifer herself is more observant and interested, while her racquet is swapped before Springer's murder and the replacement stolen after it. * Miss Rich returns to the school following a leave of absence, in which she gave birth to a child that was stillborn. Chadwick becomes jealous of her when she learns of Bulstrode's search for a successor, and so attacks her in the Sport Pavilion in a psychotic break, when she finds her searching for evidence about Shaista's \\"abduction\\". Rich is concussed but survives. * Goodman is forced to reveal himself to both Poirot and the police when he is brought before the pair for questioning. He becomes attracted to Shapland, and is with her when Rich is attacked. * After the case is finished, Poirot takes charge of the jewels to return them to the Foreign Office and the real Princess Shaista. However, he secretly leaves one for Julia within a bag of gobstoppers before he departs.

Detective Fiction ‚Äì the collector's guide: Second Edition (pp. 82, 87) Scholar Press. 1994. The UK edition retailed at fifteen shillings (15/- = 75p) and the US edition at $3.75. The novel features her novelist detective Ariadne Oliver as a minor character, and reflects in tone the supernatural novels of Dennis Wheatley who was then at the height of his popularity. The Pale Horse is mentioned in Revelation 6:8, where it is ridden by Death. Plot introduction A dying woman, Mrs Davis, gives her last confession to Father Gorman, a Catholic priest, but along with her confession she gives him a list of names and a terrible secret. Before he can take action, however, he is struck dead in the fog. As the police begin to investigate, a young hero begins to piece together evidence that sets him upon a converging path. Plot summary In the following summary, events are not given in strict narrative order. Mark Easterbrook, the hero of the book and its principal narrator, sees a fight between two girls in a Chelsea coffee bar during which one pulls out some of the other's hair at the roots. Soon afterwards he learns that this second girl, Thomasina Tuckerton, has died. At dinner with a friend, a woman named Poppy Stirling mentions something called the Pale Horse that arranges deaths, but is suddenly scared at having mentioned it and will say no more. When Mark encounters the police surgeon, Corrigan, he learns of the list of surnames found in the shoe of a murdered priest named Father Gorman. The list includes the names Corrigan, Tuckerton and Hesketh-Dubois (the same name as Mark's godmother who has recently died of what appear to be natural causes). He begins to fear that the list contains the names of those dead or shortly to die. When Mark goes to Much DeepingJames Zemboy, The Detective Novels of Agatha Christie: A Reader's Guide, Jefferson (NC): McFarland & Company, Inc., 2008. The fictitious village is described as lying about twenty miles north of Bournemouth, Hampshire. with the famous mystery writer, Ariadne Oliver, to a village fete organised by his cousin, he learns of a house converted from an old inn called the Pale Horse, now inhabited by three modern \\"witches\\" led by Thyrza Grey. Visiting houses in the area, he meets a wheelchair-bound man, Mr Venables, who has no apparent explanation for his substantial wealth. He also visits the Pale Horse, where Thyrza discusses with Mark the ability to kill at a distance, which she claims to have developed. In retrospect it seems to Mark that she has been outlining to him a service that she would be willing to provide. In the police investigation, there is a witness, Zachariah Osborne, who describes a man seen following Father Gorman shortly before the murder. Later, he contacts the police to say that he has seen this same man in a wheelchair: it is Venables. When he learns that Venables suffered from polio and is incapable of standing due to atrophy of the legs, Osborne is nonetheless certain of his identification and begins to suggest ways that Venables could have faked his own disability. When Mark's girlfriend Hermia does not take his growing fears seriously, he becomes disaffected with her. He does, however, receive support from Ariadne Oliver, and from a vicar's wife (Mrs Dane Calthrop) who desires him to stop whatever evil may be taking place. He also makes an ally of Ginger Corrigan, a girl whom he has met in the area, and who successfully draws Poppy out about the Pale Horse organisation. She obtains from her an address in Birmingham where he meets Mr Bradley, a disbarred lawyer who outlines to him the means by which the Pale Horse functions without breaking the law, i.e. Bradley bets that someone will die within a certain period of time and the client bets otherwise. If the person in question does die within a certain period of time, then the client must pay or else (one client who refused fell in front of an oncoming train and was killed). With the agreement of Inspector Lejeune and the co-operation of Ginger, Mark agrees to solicit the murder of his first wife, who will be played by Ginger. At a ritual of some kind at the Pale Horse, Mark witnesses Thyrza apparently channel a malignant spirit through an electrical apparatus. Shortly afterwards, Ginger falls ill and begins to decline rapidly. In desperation, Mark turns to Poppy again, who now mentions a friend (Eileen Brandon) who resigned from a research organisation called CRC (Customers' Reactions Classified) that seems to be connected with the Pale Horse. When Mrs Brandon is interviewed, she reveals that both she and Mrs Davis worked for the organisation, which surveyed targeted people about what foods, cosmetics and proprietary medicines they used. Mrs Oliver now contacts Mark with a key connection that she has made: another victim of the Pale Horse (Mary Delafontaine) has lost her hair during her illness. The same thing happened to Lady Hesketh-Dubois, and Thomasina's hair was easily pulled out during the fight. Moreover, Ginger has begun to shed her own hair. Mark recognises that these are symptoms, not of satanic assassination of some sort, but of thallium poisoning. At the end of the novel it is revealed that Osborne has been the brains behind the Pale Horse organisation; the black magic element was entirely a piece of misdirection on his part, while the murders were really committed by replacing products the victims had named in the CRC survey with poisoned ones. Osborne's clumsy attempt to implicate Venables was his final mistake. After Osborne's arrest, Mark and Ginger, who is recovering, become engaged.

Literary significance and reception Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) praised the novel in the 8 December 1961 issue of The Guardian: \\"Mrs Agatha Christie is our nearest approach to perpetual motion. And not only does she never stop, but she drops the ball into the cup nearly every time; and if one is sometimes reminded of those automatic machines where one pulls a handle and out pops the finished product, that is a compliment to the automatic machine and not by any means a reflection on Mrs Christie. For the latest tug on the Christie handle produces a product which is not only up to the standard but even above it. The Pale Horse is in fact the best sample from this particular factory for some time, and that is saying plenty. The black magic theme is handled in a masterly and sinister fashion, and to give away what lay behind it would be unforgivable. This is a book which nobody (repeat, nobody) should miss.\\"The Guardian 8 December 1961 (p. 7) Iles further named the novel as his favourite in the paper's Critic's choice for the end of the year, published one week later, writing that \\"It has not been an outstanding year for crime fiction, but as usual there have been one or two first-class items. The best puzzle has certainly been Agatha Christie's The Pale Horse.\\"The Guardian 15 December 1961 (p. 9) Robert Barnard: \\"Goodish late example ‚Äì loosely plotted, but with intriguing, fantastical central idea. Plot concerns a Murder- Inc.-type organisation, with a strong overlay of black magic. Also makes use of 'The Box,' a piece of pseudo-scientific hocus-pocus fashionable in the West Country in the 'fifties (one of the things which drove Waugh to the verge of lunacy, as narrated in Pinfold).\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive ‚Äì an appreciation of Agatha Christie ‚Äì Revised edition (pp. 201‚Äì02). Fontana Books, 1990. In the \\"Binge!\\" article of Entertainment Weekly Issue #1343-44 (26 December 2014‚Äì3 January 2015), the writers picked The Pale Horse as an \\"EW favorite\\" on the list of the \\"Nine Great Christie Novels\\". References or allusions=References to other works= This novel is notable as several of her earlier characters reappear in this book. In addition to Ariadne Oliver, Major Despard and his wife Rhoda (who met and fell in love in Cards on the Table) also participate in the plot. Mrs Dane Calthrop from The Moving Finger also reappears in approximately the same role as she played in that book: the rational but devoted Christian who wants the evil stopped. Mrs Oliver is apprehensive of attending a fete, for reasons that will be apparent to readers of her previous appearance in a Christie novel: Dead Man's Folly. Mrs Lancaster from By the Pricking of My Thumbs may have been mentioned in a conversation, when one of the characters, David Ardingly, mentions how he met an old lady in a mental home who says exactly the same phrase which chilled Tuppence to the bone, and which had a similar effect on Ardingly. Mrs Lancaster mentioned \\"ten past eleven\\", though, while Ardingly's recollection placed the mentioned time at \\"12.10\\". =References in actual history= This novel is notable among Christie's books as it is credited with having saved at least two lives after readers recognised the symptoms of thallium poisoning from its description in the book. *In 1975, Christie received a letter from a woman in Latin America who recognised the symptoms of thallium poisoning, thus saving a woman from slow poisoning by her husband. *In 1977, a 19-month-old infant from Qatar was suffering from a mysterious illness. After the baby was flown to London, Marsha Maitland, a nurse who had been reading The Pale Horse correctly suggested that the baby was suffering from thallium poisoning. *In another instance, in 1971, a serial killer, Graham Frederick Young, who had poisoned several people, three fatally, was caught thanks to this book. A doctor conferring with Scotland Yard had read The Pale Horse and realised that the mysterious \\"Bovingdon bug\\" (the deaths occurred in a factory in Bovingdon, England) was in fact thallium poisoning.The Agatha Christie Companion, by Dennis Sanders and Len Lovallo (1984), pp. 314‚Äì15. The novel is also cited to have been the \\"inspiration\\" of what was dubbed \\"The Mensa Murder\\". In 1988, George Trepal, a Mensa Club member, poisoned his neighbours, Pye and Peggy Carr and their children, with thallium introduced in a Coca-Cola Classic bottles eight-pack. Peggy Carr succumbed while the others survived the attack. Adaptations= TV = The novel was first adapted for TV by ITV in 1996, in a 100-minute TV film with Colin Buchanan as Mark Easterbrook. This version omitted the character of Ariadne Oliver. It makes Easterbrook the suspect in the killing of Father Gorman. At first it seems that the murders are masterminded by Venables, who it transpires is not disabled, but ultimately Osbourne is still revealed as the murderer. A second adaptation was later made by the same network, done by Russell Lewis for the fifth series of ITV's Agatha Christie's Marple starring Julia McKenzie in 2010.\\"Julia McKenzie back as Marple in The Pale Horse\\", Press Release by ITV, 22 February 2010 As the character of Miss Marple was made the chief sleuth of the plot, several changes were made for the adaptation: * The characters of Ariadne Oliver, Pamela \\"Poppy\\" Stirling, Colonel and Rhoda Despard, Jim Corrigan, and Rev. and Mrs Dane Calthrop, are omitted from the adaptation; the omission of Rhoda and Colonel Despard is probably due to the fact that in the Agatha Christie's Poirot adaptation of Cards on the Table, Rhoda dies in place of Anne Meredith, and Colonel Despard falls in love with Anne instead. * New characters were invented for it: ** Captain Cottam ‚Äì a local in Much Deeping with a firm dislike of Venables. Both men do not see eye to eye, with Cottam claiming Venables was responsible for a fire at his home. ** Kanga Cottam ‚Äì Wife of the Captain, staying with him at The Pale Horse ** Lydia Harsnet ‚Äì Housekeeper of the Cottams, who secretly is having an affair with the husband. * Father Gorman is made a friend of Miss Marple, and sends her the list of names he received from Mrs Davis to her just before his murder. After learning of his death, and coming to London, Miss Marple visits Mrs Davis home, and finds a second list of names in one of her shoes; because Pamela is omitted from the adaptation, Miss Marple is led to the Pale Horse by the second list, written on headed paper taken from the hotel, which also included dates next the names on it. * While The Pale Horse is converted from a house in the novel, the adaptation places it as always being a hotel, and was bought by Thyrza Grey and her associates shortly after the previous owner lost their wife. The fete held at the village still occur, but has no involvement from Mark Easterbrook's cousin. * Bradley's office is relocated from Birmingham, to Charing Cross, London, while his address is given to Miss Marple through Ginger Corrigan, who found a card of his during a party held by Mrs Tuckerton, owing to the omission of Pamela as she revealed that information to Ginger in the novel. * Thomasina Tuckerton is not involved in a fight in the adaptation. * The first name of Osbourne was changed from Zachariah to Paul, while his profession is changed to being a member of a Sales Office, not a pharmacist. Other modifications included an attempt by Osbourne to poison Miss Marple, who tricks him into believing she had been but hadn't and reveals she had discovered his attempt by a mistake he made in not observing her sense of order, and a slight change in the solicitation of murder made by Mark, in which the police involvement is greater, while Ginger does not fall ill as she is not poisoned. * The knowledge of Mrs Davis' involvement with CRC, is found differently due to the omissions of Pamela and Eileen ‚Äì Inspector Lejeune learns about CRC by having Bradley tailed, shortly after meeting Marple outside his offices, to which Marple suspects that Mrs Davis was involved with them owing to her earlier asking Mrs Coppins about her work. * During Osbourne's attempt to cast suspicion on Venables, he takes Miss Marple to spy on Venables' house after dark, where they see him get up from his wheelchair to draw the curtains. (This reinforces Osbourne's false claim to have earlier observed Venables (or an identical double) cosh Fr. Gorman in London.) The final confrontation scene explains that Inspector Lejeune was playing Venables inside the house, hence his ability to walk. The real Venables is indeed paralyzed. In June 2019, it was announced that Sarah Phelps, who had written several Christie adaptations for BBC and Mammoth Screen, would write a new adaptation of The Pale Horse. The two-part series was broadcast on 9 and 16 February 2020 on BBC One. The cast included Rufus Sewell as Mark Easterbrook, Sean Pertwee as Inspector Lejeune, Bertie Carvel as Zachariah Osborne, Kaya Scodelario as Hermia, and Sheila Atim, Rita Tushingham and Kathy Kiera Clarke as the ‚Äúwitches‚Äù of Much Deeping. It deviated from the novel in many ways: the cast list was missing 'Ariadne Oliver' and 'Ginger' while introducing other characters, and Mark Easterbrook is a twice-married antihero. The Independent noted that it had a \\"satisfying conclusion despite traditional whodunnit thrills\\", while The Telegraph asserted that it chucked \\"the rat-filled kitchen sink into this rewrite of Agatha Christie\\". =Radio= The novel has been adapted twice for BBC Radio: * First in 1993 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of BBC Radio 4's Saturday Night Theatre, dramatized by Michael Bakewell and featuring Jeremy Clyde as Mark Easterbrooke, Stephanie Cole as Ariadne Oliver, Terence Alexander as Mr. Venables, Mary Wimbush as Thyrza Grey, Hilda Schroder as Bella, Stephen Hodson as Jim Corrigan, Jonathan Adams as Inspector Lejeune and Federay Holmes as Ginger. * A new BBC Radio 4 adaptation in three parts was first broadcast in September 2014 and has been re-broadcast in January 2018, dramatized by Joy Wikinson and featuring Jason Hughes as Mark Easterbrook, Eleanor Bron as Thyrza, Georgia Groome as Ginger, Michael Bertenshaw as Inspector Lejeune, Phoebe Pryce as Hermia, Ron Cook as Osborne and Nicholas Jones as Venables.

In January 2007, Innes left the show after 12 years with the character of Kerry Weaver moving to Florida. Weaver appeared in the third largest number of episodes after John Carter and Chuny Marquez. Very little of Weaver's background was revealed to the audience early on. The character exhibits a limp in her gait, which is aided by the use of a forearm crutch, later revealed to be caused by congenital hip dysplasia in episode 14 of season 11, and that she had lived for a period in Africa. Weaver arrived at County General as Chief Resident and later became an attending physician. She was promoted to Chief of Emergency Medicine and finally Hospital Chief of Staff. Her administrative position often forced her to make unpleasant decisions that drew hostility from her fellow physicians, as when she fired Jeanie Boulet in Season 4. She is often the villain in many episodes, prioritizing herself and her career over the well-being of other ER workers and even patients. Her behavior is often hypocritical, condescending, and arrogant. Having had some heterosexual relationships, Weaver eventually came out as a lesbian. Her sexual orientation was a key point in some of the episodes, particularly when she fought in court to keep her son, Henry. She was included in AfterEllen.com's Top 50 Lesbian and Bisexual Characters.  Seasons two through six  During Innes' first five seasons on the show, little was revealed about the details of Weaver's background which would later become some of her defining traits: her sexual orientation, political beliefs, and even the precise nature of her disability. These were closely guarded secrets for a woman who wanted to succeed professionally, but feared discrimination. She was also unable to fully deal with her internalized homophobia and regretted that she never knew her birth parents. When she was first hired by Mark Greene as chief resident in 1995, this let down much of the ER staff who didn't care for her detail-oriented approach in the trauma rooms. Early in her position, she would often clash with Doug Ross and resident Susan Lewis over most of the procedures in patient care. In addition, her strong belief in administrative policies would be dragged out into every unnecessary aspect in the workplace (in one episode, Jerry, the desk clerk, brought cake celebrating her day off). In Season 3, Kerry became an ER attending physician alongside Mark Greene, whom she would always manage to compete with or maneuver to catch the eye of her superiors. As a result, it was difficult for anyone ‚Äî the audience or any of the other characters ‚Äî to really know Weaver beyond her tough and bureaucratic professionalism. In an early glimpse into her soul, Weaver defended Jeanie Boulet, played by Gloria Reuben, a physician assistant who contracted HIV from her adulterous husband. Later Boulet contracts Hepatitis C from a needle stick accident involving an infected patient. She fought to keep her job and dignity, while some doctors worried about the liability involved in having an HIV-positive employee in the ER. Weaver was the first person in a position of power to side with Jeanie, and the two remained friends until Jeanie's budget- related firing and her successful pressure campaign to get her job back. They reconciled and were close friends again when Jeanie left the ER to be with her new husband and raise her adopted HIV-positive son, Carlos. Weaver demonstrated a great deal of compassion and a moral commitment to civil rights, and that helped her and Dr. Greene draft an ER policy for HIV-positive employees. This storyline developed Weaver's character beyond that of a stoic, abrasive professional. In future episodes, she agreed to look the other way when Dr. John Carter helped a teenage runaway escape her homophobic parents who sent her away to an ex-gay camp. In 1997, Weaver went through a brief relationship with Ellis West (played by Clancy Brown), an M.D. working for the Synergix Group, which was under consideration by County for a general management contract of the ER. Despite his claims to the contrary, she eventually came to the conclusion that West had begun a relationship with her in order to gain her approval of the contract. West said she was wrong and withdrew the proposal. After Carter was fired from his RA position and had nowhere to live, he followed an ad which led him to Dr. Weaver's house; she had been renting out her basement apartment to college students. For the first time, the audience saw the inside of her city home, and noted that she was single and independent, lived in a nice home, and had a particular taste in music. Weaver also hired a private investigator to locate her birth mother, an effort that initially failed and revealed Weaver's fear that she was raised by adoptive parents because her mother could not accept a disabled daughter. In 1998, during Season 4, Kerry was briefly debilitated when an explosion at chemical plant sent victims flooding in, creating a toxic benzene spill in the ER. Weaver suffered a convulsive (Generalized Tonic Clonic or Grand Mal) seizure from the effects of the toxins. She was treated by Dr. Carter and Dr. Anna Del Amico. With Weaver debilitated and Dr. Greene out of town, Carter was forced to take charge of the ER for the first time. Ever since her arrival at County General, Kerry had been very ambitious in pursuing higher administrative titles, such as Chief of Emergency Medicine. This was after Dr. Morgenstern's long, extensive absence, that a new position needed to be filled. For a short period she was made interim acting chief of emergency medicine until a suitable replacement was found. Yet, after an incident involving the hiring of a doctor who turned out to be a very accomplished if bizarre non-physician, Kerry's chances were luckily left open. However, she discovered that the hospital wasn't really considering her for the position. When she found out, she immediately quit as interim chief of the ER and Dr. Robert Romano jumped at the opportunity to become interim chief of the ER. At the start of Season 6, word spread that Romano might be up to the position as Chief of Staff, an event that both Kerry and Mark Greene resented and tried to prevent. However, in the end Kerry backed Dr. Romano for Chief of Staff and in return she was given the position of Chief of Emergency Medicine. This would be the first and last time Romano and Weaver completely agreed on administrative policy; in later seasons they were always involved in power struggles, despite both of them favoring administrative matters much more than the rest of the staff In 1999, Weaver welcomed the chance to hire Dr. Gabe Lawrence (played by Alan Alda), who had been her mentor. She initially refused to accept Dr. Mark Greene's assertion that Lawrence was suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's Disease, but she ultimately faced facts and said goodbye to her role model.  Season seven  In mid-season, Weaver fell in love with staff psychiatrist Kim Legaspi (played by Elizabeth Mitchell), but was afraid to admit it to Legaspi or herself. While Legaspi was openly lesbian and willing to pursue a romantic relationship with Weaver, she became frustrated that Weaver was not only in the closet, but also suffered from internalized homophobia and thus the relationship got off to a slow start. Once Weaver was able to admit to herself that she was gay, she was still uncomfortable about her coworkers finding out and the discriminatory consequences it might have on her career. This was despite their relationship becoming an \\"open secret\\" among most of the people in the ER. During that story, we also learned that Kerry had been married to a surgical resident before her career at County General started. The first coworker Weaver came out to was Dr. Robert Romano, who planned to fire Legaspi over trumped up allegations that she sexually harassed a female patient. Weaver's act of courage kept Romano from firing Legaspi, but it also emotionally drained Weaver, whose fears of discrimination ruining her career resurfaced. She was therefore unable to provide emotional support to Legaspi, who kept her job, but at the cost of seeing the entrenched homophobia of the hospital administration and her own girlfriend, who remained in the closet. Legaspi broke up with Weaver and decided to take a job offer in San Francisco rather than face the homophobia from Romano or the lack of emotional support she received from Weaver. Kerry also ran afoul of Elizabeth Corday in Season 7 when she had Mark Greene evaluated for professional competency after he showed noticeable personality changes after returning from brain tumor surgery. As a result, Kerry was not invited to Elizabeth and Mark's wedding, and while she and Mark seem to mend fences in Season 8, she and Elizabeth remained mostly unfriendly. Elizabeth sympathized and the two doctors were on better terms until Dr. Corday departed the show in Season 11. They were never close friends though. In fact, Elizabeth's departure came when she deliberately performed an illegal, life-saving transplant from an HIV+ donor into an HIV+ individual and did so in large part because she knew it would anger Kerry, leading Kerry to offer a demotion that Elizabeth declines before quitting.  Season eight  Weaver still had not come out to any of her coworkers except Romano and Luka Kovaƒç. She was still quite anxious about anyone discovering her true status even though her sexual orientation was already known to some of her coworkers. Weaver did, however, begin a new relationship with firefighter Lt. Sandy Lopez (played by Lisa Vidal) whom she met in a rainstorm while trying to rescue a pregnant woman from a crashed ambulance. As the two became close, Lopez told Weaver she refused to date a woman who was in the closet. Lopez forcibly outed Weaver with a passionate kiss in front of her coworkers. What followed was a groundbreaking story for American network television as the development of the romance between the two women was treated with the courtship, passion and arguments often reserved for heterosexual couples. Lopez said, \\"I did you a huge favor,\\" after the kiss in the ER; a few episodes later, Weaver admitted to her that she was right. At the season's end, Weaver accepted herself as a lesbian, and became eager to combat homophobia wherever it appeared. In Season Eight's second episode \\"The Longer You Stay\\", Weaver failed to answer repeated pages from Drs. Malucci & Chen when a patient being tended to by them had complications. Weaver was finally hauled in by Dr. Carter when he ran from the ER to get her personally from Doc Magoo's, sustaining a painful fall in the process. But after the patient died and she flatly said to the three \\"you killed him\\", she was seen back at Doc Magoo's where she found the pager she left in the bathroom stall. Desperate to cover up her irresponsibility when the hospital was sued by the patient's family, Weaver fired Malucci in the third episode \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magic\\" on a charge of misconduct, and by the fourth episode \\"Never Say Never\\", she pinned the malpractice on Malucci and Chen. In \\"Bygones\\", Weaver was stunned when she realized a lonely young woman murdered her roommate because of unrequited love. She then reconciled with Lopez and the two of them made their first social appearance at an impromptu drinking party after Mark Greene died. Weaver was visibly saddened by Greene's death and broke down after hearing the news of his passing. She later told Sandy she knew his demise was coming but never thought it would affect her as deeply as it did. She realized she had lost a friend and regretted the years they spent in competition for various ER posts and promotions.  Season nine  Weaver and Lopez were still together and had on-going arguments about the future of their relationship. Weaver wanted to have a child, but after suffering a miscarriage felt Lopez should carry the child. Lopez, however, did not want to get pregnant, because it would impact her firefighting career. The couple did not get much screen time that season, and Weaver was given another story thread about the consequences she faced when she failed to report a local politician who tested positive for syphilis; Alderman Johnathan Bright provided funding for County and a plum position for Kerry, but forced her to do an off-the-record treatment of his closeted gay lover that ended with the lover's accidental death from an allergic reaction to penicillin. Later, Dr. Anspaugh became fed up with Dr. Romano's attitude and neglect on the job. Anspaugh offered to lighten Romano's work load by sharing his administrative duties with Kerry Weaver. When Romano refused this, he was replaced with a somewhat surprised Weaver, who offered Romano the Chief of Emergency Medicine position.  Season ten  Kerry settled into her chief administrative position but ran into various challenges that arose day by day from hospital staffing to the ER's hectic renovation. These obstacles included her constant run-ins with Dr. Romano, whom at one point she threatens to fire. When he was killed in a helicopter accident, Kerry, like many others, was not saddened, though she acknowledged that his presence was an important contribution to the hospital. Later in early 2004, Weaver dedicated a Center of LGBT healthcare in the memory of Romano, which secretly served as post-mortem payback, since Romano was not a supporter of gay rights. In her personal life, Lopez changed her mind about having a baby and gave birth to baby Henry in the hospital. Later on in the season, however, Lopez died from injuries she suffered while fighting a fire; Kerry was devastated by the loss. Abby Lockhart and (surprisingly) Elizabeth Corday were particularly supportive towards her following this tragedy. Sandy's parents (who had never approved of her sexual orientation) took custody of Henry and for the remainder of the season, Weaver's storyline focused on a child custody battle between herself and Lopez's parents. The custody situation was eventually settled when the Lopezes and Weaver agreed to her having primary custody, with the Lopezes taking care of Henry while Kerry was at work.  Season eleven  In the 2005 episode titled \\"Just As I Am,\\" Weaver finally met her biological mother, Helen Kingsley, who turned out to be a conservative Christian, originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and currently living in Terre Haute, Indiana. Kingsley (Frances Fisher) explained to Weaver that, as an unmarried, teenage mother with limited options for raising a child, she gave Weaver up for adoption when she was 14 days old in hopes of her having a better life. She was in town for a Christ Crusade and decided to meet her daughter since Kerry's biological father, Cody Boone, had recently died. When Kingsley learned her daughter was a lesbian, she and Weaver clashed over faith and sexuality, with Weaver insisting that her mother love and accept her. Kingsley said she could love her daughter, but because she could not accept homosexuality as moral, she could not accept Weaver's lifestyle. This episode not only ended the mystery behind Weaver's mother, it also revealed for the first time the reason for Weaver's crutch: Helen inquired about Weaver's limp, and Weaver explained that she suffered from congenital hip dysplasia, a birth defect. Weaver was surprised to learn that Helen knew nothing about it, and her long-held fear that the birth defect was the reason she was given up for adoption was resolved. Aside from this episode, Kerry Weaver almost exclusively played supporting roles and was frequently absent from entire episodes. A negative contribution was that she played a major role in forcing Elizabeth Corday to leave County, though Corday deliberately provoked her into doing so because she could not work with Lucien Dubenko, a new surgeon that Weaver had hired.  Season twelve  Kerry continued to play the background in most of the episodes this season. Even though she stayed very busy with her administrative meetings and tasks, Kerry occasionally took shifts in the ER to keep her emergency skills sharp. In the episode \\"Out on a Limb\\" Kerry finally underwent surgery to fix her hip dysplasia. In the episode \\"No Place To Hide,\\" Kerry walked for the first time on the series without the aid of her forearm crutch. Kerry asked Abby (who was expecting a child with Luka) to be Henry's legal guardian in the event that something happened to her, but her surgery was entirely successful. (Reportedly, this storyline was done, at least in part, because Laura Innes really was starting to develop hip and back problems after ten years of walking with a fake limp for the sake of her role.) Laura Innes described this arc as the character \\"shedding some of her hardness and moving on in her life.\\" https://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Interviews- Features/Article/default.aspx?posting=%7B9821887D-1FDE-46AE-B412-D6247FF1C1C9%7D At the end of the season, Kerry faced criticism for hiring Dr. Victor Clemente (John Leguizamo) as an attending physician, who compromised patient care leading to possible liability and lawsuits to the hospital. Despite being responsible for hiring him (and for defending him against Luka's protests when Clemente began causing trouble), Kerry tried to divert the fire towards Dr. Luka Kovaƒç (Goran Visnjic), the Chief of Emergency Medicine, risking his job as a result.  Season thirteen  After saving Luka and Abby in the season premiere, Kerry realized that her constant attempts to protect her career had cost her friendships; she owned up to her responsibility for the Clemente incident in order to save Luka from being fired. She was demoted from Chief of Staff as a result and was back to being an attending physician. Though she clearly struggled to adjust to her new position, especially with the current ER chief Luka Kovaƒç now being her boss, Kerry was pleased to practice medicine full-time again; she also developed a more friendly relationship with Greg Pratt. Working back in the ER, Weaver caught the eye of a TV producer filming a news segment with Dr. Morris and literally steals the show. She's offered a job by the executives for news reporting. Shortly afterwards, Kerry and her producer Courtney (Michelle Hurd) developed a close relationship, one Kerry had not felt since her partner Sandy Lopez died. Courtney told Kerry how her great news broadcasting could open a successful career for her. Kerry decided to leave County General when ER chief Luka Kovaƒç had to enact budget cuts and eliminate an attending position. Kerry accepted a television show offer at WTVJ in Miami, despite Kovaƒç's last-minute efforts to convince her to stay. Kerry Weaver's last regular appearance on ER was in the Season 13 episode called \\"A House Divided\\" Episode 280 in which Abby Lockhart expressed to Dr. Weaver that if it had not been for her, she'd never have become a doctor or a mother; she and Kerry shared a tearful farewell moment. As Kerry packed up and walked out of County General's doors for the last time, she only asked Luka to take care of the place for her and advised him not to make her mistake-getting involved in hospital politics, indicating that she forgave him. Luka took her advice and stepped down as Chief towards the end of the season, just before he married Abby. Laura Innes' last appearance as a series regular on the show was on January 11, 2007. Following her departure from the program, NBC received some pressure from GLAAD to introduce more LGBT characters.  Return to the series in the fifteenth season and the end  Weaver appeared in a flashback sequence in the Season 15 episode titled \\"Heal Thyself\\", which was set back in 2002, just months before Greene's death. In her scene, she walked into Trauma 1 and expressed how worried she was about Dr. Mark Greene, because of his treatment for brain cancer. She told him to step down and take a break from treating Catherine Banfield's son. After he refused, Dr. Weaver reluctantly left the room. At the end of the Season 15 episode \\"The Book of Abby,\\" long- serving nurse Haleh Adams showed the departing Abby Lockhart a closet wall where all the past doctors and employees had put their locker name tags. Among them, the tag \\"Weaver\\" was seen. During Season 15 episode 19, former co-worker Dr. Doug Ross asked both Sam Taggart and Neela Rasgotra about Weaver (as he found out that they were from County), curious if she was still working there. In the series finale, she flew from Florida to attend the dedication and opening of the Carter Center. She met up with Elizabeth Corday, Susan Lewis, John Carter, and Peter Benton after Carter's opening. The old colleagues went out to eat at an old tavern and catch up with each other. At the end of the night, she then told the group that she couldn't stay any longer, as she needed to catch a flight back to Florida. Kerry gave everyone a hug and left Chicago.

Cobalt oxide smalt appears as a pigment in Egyptian pottery about five centuries later, and soon after in the Aegean region, and this is the pigment normally known as smalt. In paintings, smalt has a tendency to lose its color over a long period, and is little used today.Smalt (conservation science), Tate Gallery However, when used in ceramics for underglaze decoration, it keeps its colour well, and is the main blue used in blue and white pottery from a wide range of dates and areas, including Chinese blue and white porcelain from the Yuan and Ming dynasties, Renaissance Italian maiolica and Delftware.Encyclopedia Iranica, \\"Cobalt\\" Samples of smalt in the Historical dye collection of the Technical University of Dresden, Germany Chinese porcelain used smalt glazes from the Tang dynasty onwards, though Chinese cobalt glass is found from the Zhou dynasty (1122‚Äì221 BC). Cobalt was used as a pigment in Central Asia from the 13th century. A fragment of a mud painting in the ancient Tangut city of Khara-Khoto has been found to contain smalt, judged to be dated between the 11th and 13th centuries. A large quantity of smalt was purchased for the decoration of the gallery of Francis I of France at Fontainebleau in 1536. Smalt, normally now discoloured, is common in European paintings from the 15th to 17th centuries. For example, it is found in Hans Holbein the Younger's portrait of Sir William Butts (ca. 1540), in Michael Pacher's painting \\"The Early Fathers' Altar\\" (ca. 1483), and in the frescos of Domenico Ghirlandaio (1449‚Äì1494).See: (1) Mauro Bacci and Marcello Picollo, \\"Non-Destructive Spectroscopic Detection of Cobalt(II) in Paintings and Glass,\\" Studies in Conservation, vol. 41, no. 3, pages 136‚Äì144 (1996); especially page 136; and (2) C.

Biography He was born on July 24, 1927 in Irvington, New Jersey. Howard graduated from St. Rose School, Belmar, in 1941, Asbury Park High School in 1947, St. Bonaventure University, in 1952; and earned a Master of Education degree from Rutgers University-New Brunswick in 1958. Prior to being elected to the House, Howard served in the United States Navy in the South Pacific from December 30, 1944, to July 19, 1946; teacher and acting principal in Wall Township school system from 1952 to 1964. Elected as a Democrat to the Eighty-ninth and to the eleven succeeding Congresses and served from January 3, 1965, until his death from a heart attack in Washington, D.C., on March 25, 1988. On May 23, 1967, Howard created a public controversy over the M16, the basic combat rifle in Vietnam, beginning after he read a letter to the House of Representatives in which a Marine in Vietnam claims that almost all Americans killed in the Battle of Hill 881 died as a result of their new M16 rifles jamming. By the end of 1967, the problem had been resolved. In 1974, he introduced the idea of a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit. And Congress soon imposed a nationwide 55 MPH (90 km/h) speed limit by threatening to withhold highway funds from states that did not adopt this limit. It was estimated a speed of used 17% less fuel per mile than a speed of 75 MPH (120 km/h). It was also believed, based on a noticeable drop the first year the limit was imposed, that it cut down on highway deaths, but later studies were more mixed on this point.Claybrook, Joan, and Hurley, Chuck. \\"James Howard And His Fights For Public Safety.\\" Washington Post, April 12, 1988. In addition, Howard authored an innovative coordinated surface transportation policy and program. Howard's other notable, enduring contributions to the fight for enhanced highway safety include sponsorship of a myriad of bills such as: the Howard-Barnes anti-drunk driving legislation (1982); the Child Restraint Law (1984), which increased funding for state child passenger safety programs; legislation establishing a uniform minimum drinking age of 21 (1984); the National Driver's Register (1982); the National Infrastructure Act (1983); and the Motor Carrier Act (1980), which was the first regulatory reform of the trucking industry in half a century that, among other things, increased federal aid for truck safety programs. Howard served as chairman of the Committee on Public Works and Transportation (Ninety- seventh through One Hundredth Congresses). At the time of his death, Howard was fighting an effort by transportation-related businesses move to persuade Congress to \\"complete\\" truck deregulation, a move they said would save billions in distribution costs. Upon his death the committee chairmanship passed to Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-CA). Frank Pallone filled the seat vacated by Howard's death in 1988. Howard was a resident of Spring Lake Heights, New Jersey,Sullivan, Joseph F. \\"POLITICS; Parties Maneuver to Replace 2 Representatives\\", The New York Times, April 3, 1988.

It features the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. The UK edition retailed at sixteen shillings (16/-) and the US edition at $4.50. The novel is notable for the fact that Poirot never visits any of the crime scenes or speaks to any of the witnesses or suspects. He is challenged to prove his claim that a crime can be solved by the exercise of the intellect alone. The novel marks the return of partial first-person narrative, a technique that Christie had largely abandoned earlier in the Poirot sequence but which she had employed in the previous Ariadne Oliver novel, The Pale Horse (1961). There are two interwoven plots: the mystery Poirot works on from his armchair while the police work on the spot, and a Cold War spy story told in the first person narrative. Reviews at the time of publication found the writing up to Christie's par, but found negatives: the murder of a character about to add useful information was considered \\"corny\\" and \\"unworthy\\" of the author, and \\"not as zestful\\". In contrast, Barnard's review in 1990 said it was a \\"lively, well-narrated, highly unlikely late specimen\\" of Christie's writing. He loved the clocks at the start, and was oddly disappointed that they were red herrings. Plot summary Sheila Webb, a typist at Miss Martindale's agency, arrives at her afternoon appointment at Wilbraham Crescent in Crowdean, Sussex. She finds a well-dressed older man, stabbed to death, surrounded by six clocks, four of which are stopped at 4:13, while the cuckoo clock announces it is 3 o'clock. When a blind woman enters the house about to step on the corpse, Sheila runs screaming out of the house and into the arms of a young man passing down the street. This man, Special Branch or MI5 agent Colin \\"Lamb\\", takes Sheila into his care. He is investigating a clue from a note found in a dead agent's pocket; letter M, number 61, and a sketch of a crescent moon written on a bit of hotel stationery (sketched in the book). At 19 Wilbraham Crescent, home of the blind Miss Pebmarsh, a police investigation begins into the murder. The dead man's business card proves false. His clothing reveals nothing else, as all labels have been removed. He was killed with an ordinary kitchen knife. Colin and Inspector Hardcastle interview the neighbours. Their homes adjoin the murder site on the street or from the back gardens in this unusually arranged Victorian housing development. Colin takes a liking to Sheila. Hardcastle questions Mrs Lawton, the aunt who raised Rosemary Sheila Webb. Rosemary is the name on a clock found at the scene of the murder, but it disappeared before police gathered them up. Colin approaches Hercule Poirot, an old friend of his father, to investigate the case. He challenges Poirot to do so from his armchair. He gives Poirot detailed notes. Poirot accepts, then instructs Colin to talk further with the neighbours. At the inquest, the medical examiner explains that chloral hydrate was given to the victim before he was murdered. After the inquest, Edna Brent, one of the secretaries, expresses confusion at something said in evidence. She tries but fails to convey this to Hardcastle. She is soon found dead in a telephone box on Wilbraham Crescent, strangled with her own scarf. The dead man's identity is yet unknown. Mrs Merlina Rival (original name Flossie Gapp) identifies the dead man as her one-time husband, Harry Castleton. Colin leaves Britain on his own case, travelling behind the Iron Curtain to Romania. He returns with the information he needed, but not the person he hoped to find. Following Poirot's advice, Colin talks with the neighbours. He finds a ten-year-old girl, Geraldine Brown, in the apartment block across the street. She has been observing and recording the events at Wilbraham Crescent while confined to her room with a broken leg. She reveals that a new laundry service delivered a heavy basket of laundry on the morning of the murder. Colin tells Hardcastle. Hardcastle tells Mrs Rival that her description of the deceased is not accurate. Upset, she calls the person who involved her in this case. Despite police watching her, she is found dead at Victoria tube station, stabbed in the back. Poirot's initial view of this case is that the appearance of complexity must conceal quite a simple murder. The clocks are a red herring, as is the presence of Sheila, and the removal of the dead man's wallet and tailor marks in the clothing. Colin updates Poirot on subsequent visits. At a room in a Crowdean hotel, Poirot tells Inspector Hardcastle and Colin Lamb what he has deduced. From a careful chronology, he deduces what Edna realised. She returned early from lunch on the day of the murder because her shoe was broken, unnoticed by Miss Martindale, the owner. Miss Martindale took no telephone call at the time she claimed she had, and is the one person with motive to murder Edna. From that fictitious call, the boss sent Sheila to Miss Pebmarsh's house for steno/typing service. Miss Pebmarsh denies requesting this service. Mrs Bland, one of the neighbours, mentioned she had a sister in the initial interview with Hardcastle. Poirot deduced the identity of this sister as Miss Martindale. The present Mrs Bland is the second Mrs Bland. Mr Bland said his wife was the sole living relative for her family inheritance but she cannot both be sole heir and have a sister. Mr Bland's first wife died in the Second World War; he remarried soon after, to another Canadian woman. The family of his first wife had cut off communication with their daughter so thoroughly they did not know she had died. Sixteen years later, the first wife was announced to be the heiress to an overseas fortune as the last-known living relative. When this news reached the Blands, they decided the second Mrs Bland must pose as the first Mrs Bland. They fool a British firm of solicitors that sought the heir. When Quentin Duguesclin, who knew the first wife and her family, looked her up in England, a plan was laid to murder him. The plan was simple, with additions like the clocks taken from an unpublished mystery story that Miss Martindale had read in manuscript. They murdered Mrs Rival before she could tell the police who hired her. Mr Bland and his sister- in-law thought their plan would baffle the police, while Mrs Bland felt she was a pawn in their schemes. Mr Bland disposed of Duguesclin's passport on a trip to Boulogne, which trip he mentioned to Colin in casual conversation. Poirot holds that people reveal much in simple conversation. Poirot had assumed this trip took place, so the man's passport would be found in a country different from where he was murdered, and long after friends and family in Canada had missed him on his holiday in Europe. The missing clock, with Rosemary written on it, was traced. Colin realises that Sheila had taken it and tossed it in the neighbour's dustbin, seeing it was her very own clock, mislaid on the way to a repair shop. But the clock was taken by Miss Martindale, not mislaid by Sheila. Colin turns his note upside down, and it points him to 19 Wilbraham Crescent. Miss Millicent Pebmarsh is the centre of the ring passing information to the other side in the Cold War, using Braille to encode their messages. He has decided to marry Sheila and realises that Miss Pebmarsh is Sheila's mother, and thus his future mother-in-law. He gives her two hours warning of the net closing around her. She chose her cause over her child once, and does so again, clutching a small deadly knife. \\"Lamb\\" disarms her and the two wait for the arrest, both firm in their convictions. The novel closes with two letters from Inspector Hardcastle to Poirot, telling him police have found all the hard evidence to close the case. Mrs Bland, less ruthless than her sister, admitted all under questioning.

Literary significance and reception Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) reviewed the novel in The Guardian's issue of 20 December 1963 when he said, \\"I am not so sure. This begins well, with the discovery of a stranger in a suburban sitting-room, with four strange clocks all showing the same time; but thereafter the story, though as readable as ever, does tend to hang fire. Also there is one very corny item, the vital witness killed when on the point of disclosing crucial information, which is quite unworthy of Miss Christie.\\"The Guardian, 20 December 1963, p. 6 Maurice Richardson of The Observer (10 November 1963) concluded, \\"Not as zestful as usual. Plenty of ingenuity about the timing, though.\\"The Observer, 10 November 1963, p. 25 Robert Barnard: \\"Lively, well-narrated, highly unlikely late specimen ‚Äì you have to accept two spies and three murderers living in one small-town crescent. The business of the clocks, fantastic and intriguing in itself, fizzles out miserably at the end. Contains (chapter 14) Poirot's considered reflections on other fictional detectives, and the various styles and national schools of crime writing.\\" References to other works * In Chapter 14, Poirot refers again to one of his favourite cases, the one related in The Nemean Lion, the first story of The Labours of Hercules. * In Chapter 24 mention is made of Poirot's role in \\"the Girl Guide murder case\\". This had been retold in Dead Man's Folly. * In Chapter 25, Lamb meets a little girl with her broken leg in a cast who spends the day looking out of the window at the neighbours, whom she has given fanciful descriptive names. The inspiration for this plot device is possibly Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film, Rear Window, a nod to a classic. In the same chapter, the little girl refers to a neighbour called Miss Bulstrode, though it seems unlikely that the character is the same Miss Bulstrode from Cat Among the Pigeons. Adaptations An adaptation for the ITV television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, with David Suchet as Poirot, was produced for the show's twelfth series, aired in the UK in 2010. Guest stars include Tom Burke as Lieutenant Colin Race, Jaime Winstone as Sheila Webb, Lesley Sharp as Miss Martindale, and Anna Massey as Miss Pebmarsh; this was Massey's last performance, before her death, and the ITV broadcast of the episode is dedicated to her memory. Charles Palmer (who also directed Hallowe'en Party for the series) directs this instalment, with the screenplay being written by Stewart Harcourt (who also wrote the screenplay for Murder on the Orient Express). The adaptation was filmed on location in Dover, Dover Castle and St Margaret's Bay. For the television adaptation, the setting was shifted from the Cold War era of the 1960s to the 1930s (keeping it in line with ITV's other adaptation of Poirot's cases set around the same decade), with a further change in location from Crowdean, Sussex, to Dover, Kent. Whilst the novel's main plot is retained, a number of significant changes were made by the adaptation, including a modification of the novel's sub-plot due to the change in setting: * The characters of Mr and Mrs McNaughton, and Geraldine Brown are omitted from the adaptation. Three other characters were replaced with new ones ‚Äì Constable Jenkins replaces Sergeant Cray as Hardcastle's assistant in the police investigations; Vice Admiral Hamling replaces Colonel Beck as Colin's superior; Christopher Mabbutt and his daughters, May and Jenny, replace the Ramsays at No. 62 Wilbraham Crescent, and are involved in the story's sub-plot * Some of the characters retained in the adaptation received some changes to them:- Miss Pebmarsh is a mother, who lost two sons in the First World War, and has no relations to Sheila; Sheila has no family and thus she spent her youth in a home; Colin works as an intelligence officer for MI6 and not for Special Branch, while his surname is changed to Race, now making him a relation (specifically the son) of Colonel Race; Brent's first name is changed from Edna to Nora, while her murder happens close to the Cavendish Bureau rather than in Wilbraham Crescent; James and Edith Waterhouse become Matthew and Rachel Waterhouse, and are now Jews who fled from Germany to avoid persecution by the Nazis. * Unlike the novel, Poirot is more involved in the case right from the beginning, when Colin seeks him out for help. He is thus present for the interviews with all the suspects and witnesses of the case, as well as examining Wilbraham Crescent, and both the Cavendish Bureau and its surroundings. * The time of \\"4:13\\" is given more significance in that it hints to a hotel room that Sheila regularly visits under the cover of a work appointment, in order to conduct a secret love affair with a new role for the character of the boring professor ‚Äì Professor Purdy. Miss Martindale knows of the affair and secretly despises it, and so uses this knowledge to help her to incriminate Sheila for the initial murder. * Some clues and events were changed by the adaptation:- The laundry van clue is now provided by Mrs Hemmings; Mr Bland doesn't go abroad to dispose of evidence; Sheila doesn't dispose of the Rosemary clock but rather holds on to it, as the clock came from a mother that she never knew; the murder weapon is planted on Sheila at the inquest, by Mrs Bland; Merlina's murder occurs in Dover, not London, and her body is found by Hardcastle and Jenkins, shortly after losing her when they tail her. * Due to the change in setting, the novel's sub-plot had to be considerably modified to reflect this; while Miss Pebmarsh's involvement and the note clue are the only parts that were still retained, much of the rest was changed to have a connection to espionage prior to World War II: ** Miss Pebmarsh is part of a small outfit seeking to weaken Britain in the event that it goes to war with Germany. Her motive for her actions is to prevent further loss of young life from warfare, after she lost her sons in the First World War. Unlike the novel, her scheme is uncovered prior to Poirot's denouement of the murders. ** Annabel Larkin, Fiona Hanbury, and Christopher Mabbutt are new characters created for the modified sub-plot. While both Annabel and Mabbutt are co-conspirators in Pebmarsh's scheme ‚Äì Annabel helps to smuggle out documents from Dover Castle where she works, so that Pebmarsh can make copies for Mabbut to take over to German agents during his regular trips to France ‚Äì Fiona is the first individual to uncover the scheme after discovering Annabel's involvement in it. Both Annabel and Fiona are killed in a freak accident, caused inadvertently by a confrontation between the two women ‚Äì Annabel learns she is found out and tries to prevent Fiona exposing her. Both women are run over by a car while struggling on the road at night. ** In the adaptation, the note clue that Colin uses was created by Fiona which he took from her body at the local morgue, while his investigations do not take him out of the country unlike in the novel. ** The sub-plot intertwines with the main plot in two places:- Colin's reasons for helping Sheila are fueled by a deep regret for failing to assist Fiona when she discovered Annabel's involvement in the smuggling, and thus not being there when she was killed; the investigation into the initial murder causes an argument to happen between Mabbutt and Pebmarsh that is misheard by Mrs Hemmings, but which Poirot realises was in regards to the documents they had copied that they needed to get past the police before they were discovered. ** Miss Pebmarsh does not resist arrest, unlike in the novel where she does upon being found out. ** The Waterhouses, who are now involved in the sub-plot, are wrongly accused by Colin of being involved in Pebmarsh's scheme. His mistake comes from the fact they were found to be German due to small mistakes in their English * Some of the elements of Poirot's denouement of the case, are changed by the adaptation: ** It occurs at the Cavendish Bureau and not at his hotel. The Blands, Miss Martindale, and Sheila are also present to hear it, unlike in the novel when it is just Hardcastle and Colin. ** Mrs Bland confesses to her involvement in the crime during the denouement, rather than after being brought in for questioning by the police. ** The Gregson story that is used as the basis for the crime is a published one in the adaptation, which Poirot remembers as having been full of clocks, misidentification and misdirection, with an innocent party framed and pushed to act irrationally so the police will become more suspicious. ** Merlina and Mrs Bland are now known to each other; it is revealed that both worked together in the theatre. * Whilst the murdered man is known as Quentin Duguesclin by the end of the novel, he is never named by anyone in the adaptation. Instead, Poirot simply reveals in his denouement that he is either the relative or friend of the first Mrs Bland. The knowledge of this is emphasised as being important to Poirot through a comment he makes to Hardcastle during their investigations ‚Äì \\"I do not think it is important who he is, but who he is.\\" Publication history * 1963, Collins Crime Club (London), 7 November 1963, Hardcover, 256 pp * 1964, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), Hardcover, 276 pp * 1965, Pocket Books (New York), Paperback, 246 pp * 1966, Fontana Books (Imprint of HarperCollins), Paperback, 221 pp * 1969, Ulverscroft Large-print Edition, Hardcover, 417 pp The novel was first serialised in the UK weekly magazine Woman's Own in six abridged instalments from 9 November ‚Äì 14 December 1963 with illustrations by Herb Tauss.

From 1960 through 1976, Brewer played for the Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, and California Angels. He batted and threw left-handed. Following the advice of Warren Spahn, Brewer developed a screwball to become one of the most successful relievers in the National League in the 1960s and 1970s. Career A graduate of Broken Arrow Senior High in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, Brewer compiled a 69‚Äì65 record with 810 strikeouts and a 3.07 ERA in a 17-year career that began with the Cubs and ended with the Angels, and in between spent twelve seasons with the Dodgers. In his career, Brewer recorded 132 saves, 125 with the Dodgers, appearing in 474 games for the club. Only two Dodgers pitchers, Don Sutton and Don Drysdale, have more appearances‚Äî550 and 518, respectively. As a Dodger, Brewer appeared in the 1973 All-Star Game and in three World Series (1965‚Äì66 and 1974). From 1968 to 1973 he averaged 20 saves a season, with a career-high 24 in 1970, and in 1972, he posted a 1.26 ERA, allowing only 4.7 hits per nine innings. Brewer was involved in an on-field altercation with Billy Martin on August 4, 1960. Brewer, then with the Cubs, brushed back Martin, then with the Cincinnati Reds, with a pitch in the second inning of a game at Wrigley Field. Martin threw his bat at Brewer, who picked it up and started to hand it to Martin as Martin approached. Martin punched Brewer in the right eye, breaking his cheekbone. Brewer was twice operated on for his injuries, and Martin served a five-day suspension. The Cubs and Brewer sued Martin for over $1 million for the loss of Brewer's services, but later dropped their case. Brewer, however, pursued his, and in 1969 a judge ordered Martin to pay $10,000 in damages. Immediately after his playing career, Brewer became pitching coach of the Montreal Expos, serving for three seasons (1977‚Äì79) on the staff of Baseball Hall of Fame manager Dick Williams. He died in Tyler, Texas, of injuries suffered in an automobile accident at the age of 50.

He also attended the lectures of Robert Jameson, having gained a keen interest in geology and mineralogy. He further pursued these studies in the universities of Bonn and Berlin. After returning home Nicol worked at local geology and obtained prizes from the Highland Society for essays on the geology of Peeblesshire and Roxburghshire, now areas of the Scottish Borders. He subsequently extended his researches over other parts of Scotland, and in 1844 published Guide to the Geology of Scotland.

The UK edition retailed at sixteen shillings (16/-) and the US edition at $4.50. It features the detective Miss Marple. Two reviewers at the time the novel was published said that Agatha Christie was returning to the top of her form. A critic writing in 1990 judged this plot to be standard fare for any writer who travels to the Caribbean and needs double duty out of a vacation. Two of the major characters reappear in the novel Nemesis, published in 1971. Jason Rafiel reappears posthumously, and his assistant Esther Walters assists Miss Marple in the early chapters of the subsequent story. Plot summary This story takes place at the Golden Palm resort on the Caribbean island of St Honor√©. Miss Marple's nephew has paid for her to holiday there after a bout of ill health. She speaks with Major Palgrave, a well-travelled man with many stories to share. She sits, half listening, until Palgrave tells a story about a man who got away with murder more than once. When Palgrave asks her if she wants to see a picture of a murderer, she listens intently ‚Äì but after he looks in his wallet for the photo, he suddenly changes the subject. Miss Marple looks up to see why and spots several people nearby. The next day, when the maid Victoria finds Major Palgrave dead in his room, Miss Marple is convinced he was murdered. She asks Dr Grahame to find the photo he mentioned, pretending it is of her nephew. Meanwhile, she interviews the others: Tim and Molly Kendal, owners of the hotel; the Prescotts, a clergyman and his sister; Mr Jason Rafiel, a tycoon confined to a wheelchair; Jackson, his nurse/masseur/attendant/valet; Esther Walters, his secretary; the American Lucky Dyson and her husband, Greg; and Edward and Evelyn Hillingdon. On the beach, Miss Marple sees Se√±ora de Caspearo, a woman on holiday who says she remembers Major Palgrave because he had an evil eye. Miss Marple corrects her that he had a glass eye, but she still says that it was evil. Victoria informs the Kendals that she did not remember seeing the high blood pressure medication, Serenite, in Major Palgrave's room before his death, although it was found on his table after his death. That night, Victoria is found stabbed to death. Molly begins having nightmares. Miss Marple finds Jackson looking at Molly's cosmetics who says that if belladonna were added to it, it would cause nightmares. The following night, Tim finds Molly unconscious on the floor, apparently having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. The police are involved, and the cook, Enrico, tells them he saw Molly holding a steak knife before going outside. Miss Marple asks the others if Major Palgrave told people about the photo. Others claim Palgrave said it was not a photo of a wife killer but a husband killer. Major Palgrave is exhumed and the autopsy reveals that he was poisoned. At night, Tim wakes up to find his wife is missing. They find what seems to be her body in a creek, but it turns out to be Lucky; the two women resemble one another. Miss Marple wakes Mr Rafiel and they go to Tim and Molly Kendal's house. There they find Tim offering Molly some wine. Miss Marple tells Jackson to take the wine away. She shows it to Mr Rafiel, saying there is a deadly narcotic in it. She explains that Tim is the wife killer, recognised by Major Palgrave. Miss Marple had thought Palgrave saw the Hillingdons and the Dysons on his right as they were coming up the beach, but later realised that he had a glass eye on the right so he could not have seen them. Tim and Molly were sitting on his left. Tim was planning to kill his wife and so had to kill Major Palgrave when he recognised him. He also killed Victoria, who remembered the Serenite. Tim put belladonna in Molly's cosmetics to make her appear mad to the others. Tim had asked his wife to meet him by the creek, but Molly had been distracted by a vision due to the belladonna and wandered off. Tim saw Lucky and mistook her for Molly. He was about to poison Molly when Miss Marple came in. Esther Walters suddenly insists that Tim is not a killer. Tim shouts at her to keep quiet. He had been planning to marry Esther, after Molly's death, because he had heard that she was going to inherit a large sum of money from Jason Rafiel. Characters Miss Marple: An elderly spinster detective with an eye for detail and unexpected clues, with a \\"mind like a sink\\". She is sent on a Caribbean holiday by her nephew. Major Palgrave: An elderly, garrulous man with a glass eye who tells stories from past, some of which stories have photographs or news clips to illustrate them. Tim Kendal: A man in his thirties married to Molly Kendal, who marries her using false references and starts the hotel with her, using her money. Molly Kendal: Tim's pretty young wife who starts the hotel where the story takes place with him. She eventually believes she has fallen mentally ill and confides it to Evelyn, although her symptoms are the result of being poisoned. Jason Rafiel: A cantankerous old man with a large fortune and an unexpectedly kind spirit, who takes a shine to Miss Marple. Esther Walters: Jason Rafiel's secretary, (the widow of a poor provider) with a child at school in England. Victoria: A St Honor√© native who is the one to discover Major Palgrave's death and the mysterious bottle of Serenite. She has a common-law marriage with two children and is the second victim to be killed. Greg Dyson: A nature lover, who is now married to Lucky, his second wife. Lucky Dyson: An attractive American woman who is married to Greg. She had plotted to kill his first wife, along with Edward Hillingdon, whom she tricked into guilt for his actions, and then seduced. She is the third murder victim. Edward Hillingdon: The husband of Evelyn and an avid nature lover. He has children at a boarding school and has an affair with Lucky. Evelyn Hillingdon: A woman who does not love her husband Edward but stays with him both for their public image and for their children. Se√±ora de Caspearo: A South American woman on holiday who opposes ugliness and, therefore Major Palgrave and Jason Rafiel. She remarks on Major Palgrave's glass eye as an evil eye. Miss Prescott: An elderly woman who enjoys gossiping and has come on holiday with her brother, Canon Prescott. Canon Prescott: Miss Prescott's brother, a member of the clergy, who dislikes his sister's gossiping. Dr Grahame: The St Honor√© doctor, slowly retiring from practice, who treats Miss Marple who pretends to be ill, cares for Molly and confirms the deaths of the murdered people. Jackson: Mr Rafiel's valet/masseur/attendant who (by admission to Miss Marple) worked at a cosmetic company. Literary significance and reception After lukewarm reviews of her two previous novels, Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) felt that the writer was back on form in his review in The Guardian's issue of 11 December 1964: \\"Mrs Agatha Christie has done it again. In A Caribbean Mystery she tells the reader explicitly what is going to happen; and yet when it does, nine out of ten will be taken completely by surprise ‚Äì as I was. How does she do it? For the rest, it is Miss Marple this time who is in charge of the story; and all one can guess is that the setting is a Caribbean island.\\" Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 15 November 1964 began, \\"A most encouraging return to somewhere very near her best unputdownable form. ... Suspicion nicely distributed among guests, many of them raffish adulterers. Not very hard to guess, but quite suspenseful. Good varied characterisation including a particularly excellent octogenarian tycoon.\\"The Observer, 15 November 1964 p. 26 Towards the end of the year, Richardson again commented on the book in a special Books of the Year: A Personal Choice column when he said, \\"Agatha Christie makes one of those gratifying veteran's comebacks.\\" The Daily Mirror of 21 November 1964 wrote: \\"Not quite at the top of her form. A Miss Marples (sic) story which addicts won't find as unsolvable as usual.\\" Robert Barnard said of this novel, that it was \\"In the tradition of all those package-tour mysteries written by indigent crime writers who have to capitalize on their meagre holidays. Nothing much of interest, but useful for illustrating the 'fluffification' of Miss Marple. Reuses a ploy from Appointment with Death.\\" \\"There is no more cunning player of the murder game than Agatha Christie.\\" ‚Äî Sunday Times \\"Throws off the false clues and misleading events as only a master of the art can do.\\" The New York Times Dedication The novel is dedicated to John Cruikshank Rose, \\"with happy memories of my visit to the West Indies\\". Christie and her husband Max Mallowan became friends with John Rose in 1928 at the archaeological site at Ur. He was the architectural draftsman and when Max was in charge of the dig at Arpachiyah, Syria in 1932, he hired Rose to be his draftsman. Rose was Scottish, and as Christie described him, \\"a beautiful draughtsman, with a quiet way of talking, and a gentle humour that I found irresistible.\\" References in other works The millionaire Jason Rafiel appears again, posthumously, in the novel Nemesis where he sends Miss Marple on a case specifically because of her success in solving the events related in A Caribbean Mystery. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations A 1983 US TV movie adaptation starred Helen Hayes as Miss Marple and Barnard Hughes as Mr Rafiel. The New York Times says that Miss Marple has \\"a carload of suspects\\" to figure out why her friend was killed, in this film that first aired 22 October 1983. The screenplay was credited to Sue Grafton, later a mystery writer, and Steve Humphrey. A BBC TV adaptation starring Joan Hickson was shown in 1989 as part of the series Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, with Donald Pleasence co-starring as Mr Rafiel. Few changes were made from the novel: the Prescotts and Se√±ora de Caspearo were omitted, Miss Marple holidayed on Barbados rather than the fictional island of \\"St Honor√©\\" (the name Honor√© reappears as the fictional main town in the BBC series Death in Paradise that began airing in 2011), and the blood pressure medication was renamed Tetrauwolfide. The production was made and aired after the production of Nemesis, leading to some viewer confusion. In the earlier production, the part of Jason Rafiel was portrayed by Frank Gatliff, rather than Donald Pleasence. In 2013, the book was adapted for the sixth series of ITV's Agatha Christie's Marple, starring Julia McKenzie as Miss Marple and co-starring Antony Sher as Jason Rafiel, Oliver Ford Davies as Major Palgrave, and Robert Webb and Charity Wakefield as the Kendalls. The characters are much the same as in the novel, and the location is the same. At the end, Tim tries to shoot Molly rather than poison her, but the gun's bullets have been replaced with blanks. Like other episodes in the previous series, it includes characters based on real persons. One is fledgling novelist Ian Fleming, who needs a name for his spy hero. The other is ornithologist James Bond (Charlie Higson), who begins a lecture to his fellow guests by introducing himself as \\"...Bond, James Bond\\", which solves Fleming's problem. (Fleming, who was an avid bird-watcher, did take the name from the ornithologist, though they had not met.) As with the Joan Hickson versions, Nemesis was filmed prior to A Caribbean Mystery. There are some continuity issues: in the 2009 version of Nemesis, Jason Rafiel is a German writer, but in A Caribbean Mystery, he is an English chemical manufacturer. Miss Marple does not refer to herself as Nemesis at any time in this story, despite herself and Mr Rafiel associating the name with her in Nemesis. Just like in the Joan Hickson versions, Mr Rafiel is portrayed by different actors: Antony Sher portrays him here, but in Nemesis, he makes voice appearances by Herbert Lom (who previously appeared in the 2004 version of The Murder at the Vicarage as Monsieur Dufosse). The 1989 version is the only adaptation as of 2017 to actually be shot in the Caribbean (on location on the island of Barbados); the 1983 TV movie was shot in California, while the 2013 version was filmed in Cape Town.

Marketing Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court decision in the area of trademark law, holding that a functional design could not be trademarked, and that a patented design was presumed to be functional.. Background The plaintiff, Marketing Display, Inc., held patents (, ) on a two-spring design to keep traffic signs standing in strong winds. After the plaintiff's patents expired, the defendant, TrafFix Devices, Inc., began manufacturing their own signs using the design. The plaintiff sued for trade dress infringement based on copying of the recognizable design. The issue the Courts dealt with concerned the legal question of whether trade dress protection could apply to the subject of an expired patent. Opinion of the Court The Court, in a unanimous opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, held that there can be no trademark protection for something that is functional because that would work as a detriment to competitors based on something other than reputation, which is the key consideration in trademark law. The Court noted that the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the characteristic for which protection is sought is not functional--but having a patent for a design raises a very strong presumption that the design was functional. A design is functional if it serves any purpose that makes the product work better, or makes the product less expensive to produce. That an alternative design is available does not undercut the functionality of a given design. > Discussing trademarks, we have said ‚Äú ‚Äò[i]n general terms, a product feature > is functional,‚Äô and cannot serve as a trademark, ‚Äòif it is essential to the > use or purpose of the article or if it affects the cost or quality of the > article.‚Äô ‚Äù. Expanding upon the meaning of this phrase, we have observed > that a functional feature is one the ‚Äúexclusive use of [which] would put > competitors at a significant non-reputation-related disadvantage.‚Äù . . . > Where the design is functional under the Inwood formulation there is no need > to proceed further to consider if there is a competitive necessity for the > feature. Here, Justice Kennedy said, the design was clearly functional, and the plaintiff could not carry the burden of proving otherwise because the very characteristic that is sought to be protected by trademark is the one whose functionality was previously sought to be covered by patent.

The special suffered low ratings and it was cancelled. It featured five pastel-colored, or \\"fluppy\\", talking dogs that came through a fluppy interdimensional doorway and into the lives of Jamie and his teenage neighbor Claire. The dogs were the intended prey of the evil miser Wagstaff. Animation was supplied by TMS Entertainment, who had previously been contracted by Disney on another current running animated series, Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. The Fluppy Dogs made a cameo appearance in the DuckTales (2017) Season 3 episode Let's Get Dangerous. Plot The basic premise for the series, akin to the much later live-action sci-fi series Sliders, was the story of a band of adventurous, cuddly, dog-like creatures called Fluppies who use a crystal key to open inter-dimensional doorways. They are on a mountain of one world in perilous weather, and use the crystal key to escape, ending up in a jungle world the Fluppies are chased by a big purple dinosaur-like creature, they find another portal and escape into a supermarket on Earth. Mistaken for regular dogs, they are captured and placed in a pound. However, prior to their capture, one of the Fluppies was seen shouting to the others which was noticed by J.J. Wagstaff, a ruthless businessman. As their only means of escape, Stanley, the leader of the Fluppies, manages to get a woman to pick him as a pet for her son, Jamie; he plans to eventually return to the pound to free the others. Jamie is disappointed at this new dog, which is smaller than he hoped, but he takes him for a walk. Taking the opportunity, Stanley escapes his leash and makes a break for it, but Jamie pursues him so as to not anger his mother for losing his new pet so soon. Unfortunately, the chase leads to a construction site and Jamie finds himself in danger, forcing Stanley to reveal his intelligence and humanoid nature to save him. Meanwhile, Wagstaff, whose mansion is filled with hunting trophies and live exotic animals, sees in an old book the talking dogs he'd seen earlier; they are identified as Fluppies. Wagstaff vows to add the Fluppies to his menagerie. Now with a secret, Stanley explains the situation and Jamie offers to help. Unfortunately, the boy only has enough money to purchase one of Stanley's compatriots, Tippi, and his mother won't let him keep her. Fortunately, Jamie's neighbor Claire eagerly agrees to take her in. That night, as Jamie and Stanley sleep, the boy reflexively scratches the Fluppy's head, which causes their bed to fly. Once they awaken and learn how to control the flying effect, Stanley resolves to break his compatriots out that night and pick up Tippi to do so, inadvertently revealing their nature to Claire in the process. At the pound, Stanley and Tippi manage to free their friends and barely avoid Wagstaff, who had the pound opened to seize them. The next day, the Fluppies depart to find another dimensional portal, but they need Jamie's help. He leaves school to aid them. This portal turns out to lead to a water world, and the company are flooded out and have to return to Jamie's home to dry out. Hiding in the basement, the Fluppies discover another portal inside that very house, but opening it releases a large rambunctious creature that runs about, throwing Jamie's home into a shambles before they can bring it under control. Although the gang manages to put the house in order before Jamie's mother comes home from work, she gets news that Jamie cut school. Angry at her son for playing hooky, she asks a lot of questions, which Jamie concocts a long story whilst the Fluppies clandestinely keep the alien creature pacified in the basement by feeding it flowers. Hoping to avoid ruining Jamie's life any more, some of the Fluppies continue their search on their own while Stanley and Tippi keep the alien creature hidden in the basement. The venturing Fluppies come to a library and finally locate the portal to their home world. Unfortunately, while they are returning to tell the other Fluppies the great news, Wagstaff captures Ozzie, forcing Stanley and Tippi to ask for Claire's help. Jamie sees them depart in Claire's car as he and the youngest Fluppies ride on the creature in pursuit. Unfortunately, Wagstaff has been expecting this and manages to capture Stanley and Tippi in his home and threatens to call the police on the children for breaking and entering. With a desperate plan, the Fluppies convince Wagstaff to let the children \\"say goodbye\\" and signals them to scratch on all their heads. The combined strength of this magic tears the entire section of Wagstaff's house into the air. As the occupants struggle to keep their footing with the violent jostling, the Fluppies reach the portal at the front of the library and they crash land the building in front of it. As they struggle to open this portal, which enters into the Fluppies' home dimension, Wagstaff and his butler find themselves knocked inside by the creature while Stanley's company bolts to safety. Before Wagstaff and his butler can exit, the door closes permanently, leaving Jamie and Claire alone in their own reality. Months later in winter, Jamie and Claire have grown to be close friends after this extraordinary adventure, but they miss the Fluppies dearly. However, Stanley suddenly appears, saying that adventure is an important part of life. His fellow Fluppies appear saying they missed Claire and Jamie, and Stanley reveals that he has found a way to stabilize the portal between his homeworld and Earth. Hundreds of Fluppies line up to pass through the portal, eager to tour Earth. Cast Some of the characters in the Fluppy Dogs and the voice actors that played them were: *Carl Steven as Jamie Bingham *Jessica Pennington as Claire the Neighbor *Marshall Efron as Stanley the Blue Loyal Fluppy *Susan Blu as Tippi the Pink Lovely Fluppy and Bink the Yellow Shy Fluppy *Lorenzo Music as Ozzie the Green Cool Fluppy *Hal Smith as Dink the Red Playful Fluppy and Mr. Hamish *Cloyce Morrow as Mrs. Bingham *Michael Rye as J.J. Wagstaff Production=Differences from the book= While she may have been intended for the series, Fanci, an additional pink Fluppy Dog, was not featured in the pilot. The Fluppy Dogs merchandise (including dolls, coloring books and puzzles) released in the 1980s featured images based on a children's book which included Fanci, and which were apparently based on preliminary designs for the Fluppies. These were slightly different from the designs that appeared in the actual pilot film. Based on these designs, it would appear that the Fluppy Dogs were originally targeted to young girls, and by the time it reached post-production, the focus was changed dramatically, but it was not enough to form a concrete target audience, which might explain its failure to become a regular series. In the book, the Fluppy Dogs are as follows: Fanci Flup (pink/white with a pink hairbow), Cuddle Flup (purple/white with two purple hairbows), Brave Flup (blue/white with a plaid bandana), Cool Flup (green/white with sunglasses), Shy Flup (peach/white with a flowered hat), and Silly Flup (yellow/white with two yellow hairbows). Reception The Fluppy Dogs special made its debut on the U.S. television network ABC during the Thanksgiving turkey feast, on November 27, 1986, pre- empting We Are One World. It scored a Nielsen rating of 5.3/10; placing 70th among network programming, it was the week's lowest-ranked ABC film.

Biography He occupied various positions in the service of the Florentine republic after the expulsion of the Medici in 1494, and even on their return in 1512 he continued in the public service. In 1527 he joined the movement for the expulsion of the family and was instrumental in defeating the Medicean troops under Cardinal Passerini, who were attacking the Palazzo della Signoria. When the Medici again definitely became masters of Florence in 1530, Nardi was exiled from the city and his property confiscated. He spent the rest of his days in various parts of Italy, chiefly in Venice, and wrote a statement of the claims of the Florentine exiles against the Medici, addressed to the Emperor Charles V. The exact date of his death is unknown. His chief work is his Istorie della Citt√† di Firenze, covering the period from 1498 to 1538, in part based on Biagio Buonaccorsi's Diario. Lelio Arbib's edition of Nardi's history (Florence, 1842) contains a biography of the author, and so does that of Agenore Gelli (Florence, 1888).

He started his service under Sun Quan when he was still a teenager and, throughout his entire life, had been contributing to the foundation and solidification of the state of Eastern Wu, which Sun Quan established in 229. He fought in numerous battles for his lord, including those against Huang Zu, Liu Bei and the Shanyue tribes, but is best known for his performance in the campaigns against Sun Quan's rival Cao Cao, in which he displayed great skill in extremely adverse situations. Ling Tong was more than just a military serviceman ‚Äì he received high praise from the scholar-gentry for his gracious demeanour, bonhomie and generosity.(ÈõñÂú®ËªçÊóÖÔºåË¶™Ë≥¢Êé•Â£´ÔºåËºïË≤°ÈáçÁæ©ÔºåÊúâÂúãÂ£´‰πãÈ¢®„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55.

Early life Ling Tong was from Yuhang County (È§òÊù≠Á∏£), Wu Commandery, which is present-day Yuhang District, Hangzhou, Zhejiang. His father, Ling Cao, was a military officer serving under the warlord Sun Ce. Ling Cao held the rank of Colonel Who Defeats Bandits (Á†¥Ë≥äÊ†°Â∞â) and continued serving Sun Quan after Sun Ce's death in the year 200. In 204, Sun Quan attacked Huang Zu, the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery (Ê±üÂ§èÈÉ°; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei). During the ensuing Battle of Xiakou, Ling Cao sailed alone a distance ahead on a small boat to infiltrate the enemy formation. Huang Zu abandoned his position and fled.

Ling Tong participated in a campaign against bandits in the hilly regions of Wu. Sun Quan's main force captured a bandit stronghold and left behind 10,000 men under the command of Ling Tong and Zhang Yi (ÂºµÁï∞) to lay siege to another stronghold. The day before the battle, Ling Tong and Chen Qin (Èô≥Âã§) attended a banquet together. Chen Qin was in charge of ceremonial duties during the banquet, but he abused his powers and went against the rules. Ling Tong was upset by Chen Qin's insolence so he confronted him. In anger, Chen Qin hurled abuse at Ling Tong and even insulted Ling Tong's deceased father.

The next day, before the battle, Ling Tong exclaimed: \\"Only through death can my transgression be cleansed!\\" He charged ahead of his troops during the battle in the face of enemy arrows and boulders. The side of the garrison which Ling Tong's army attacked fell immediately. The other commanders were roused by his victory and together they inflicted a crushing defeat on the enemy.

Battle of Jiangxia In 208, Sun Quan attacked Huang Zu at Jiangxia Commandery (Ê±üÂ§èÈÉ°; around present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei) again. Ling Tong was assigned as the leader of the vanguard force. He sailed in his boat far ahead of the main army with only tens of his closest men with him, and emerged victorious in the first engagement by slaying Huang Zu's subordinate, Zhang Shuo (ÂºµÁ¢©), and capturing all of Zhang Shuo's mariners with his much smaller force.

Knowing that Zhang Shuo had been slain and that the first line of defence had been broken, Huang Zu scuttled two of his largest mengchongs to block the entrance at the chokepoint of the Mian River, and sent his crossbowmen to station themselves there to fire at any approaching enemy forces. In addition, Huang Zu had strong men and archers ambushed on top of the cliff next to the river to throw down rocks and flaming debris. Sun Quan's forces suffered great casualties and were unable to advance any further. Ling Tong and Dong Xi, along with 100 \\"commandos\\", donned two layers of armour each and charged towards the enemy despite the rain of rocks from the cliff and the fusillade from the vessels. They succeeded in breaking the connections between the two vessels after tough fighting, thus allowing Sun Quan's forces to break through and enter Miankou. Furthermore, the destruction of the mengchongs actuated Sun Quan forces' fighting spirit, and they emerged victorious in the next battle, in which L√º Meng defeated Huang Zu's navy while Ling Tong conquered Jiangxia.

He successfully pressured Liu Cong, who had succeeded Liu Biao as the Governor of Jing Province, into surrendering. A few months later, Cao Cao assembled a force of 800,000 at Jiangling County, where countless warships and weapons were stored, and sent an envoy to intimidate Sun Quan to give up resistance.(ÊõπÊìçÈÅ∫Ê¨äÊõ∏Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËøëËÄÖÂ•âËæ≠‰ºêÁΩ™ÔºåÊóÑÈ∫æÂçóÊåáÔºåÂäâÁêÆÊùüÊâã„ÄÇ‰ªäÊ≤ªÊ∞¥ËªçÂÖ´ÂçÅËê¨ÁúæÔºåÊñπËàáÂ∞áËªçÊúÉÁçµÊñºÂê≥„ÄÇ„Äç) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 65.

Conflict with Gan Ning Ling Tong had never forgiven Gan Ning for killing his father Ling Cao. Gan Ning was always on the defensive against Ling Tong and he tried to avoid meeting Ling whenever possible. Sun Quan also ordered Ling Tong to not seek vengeance on Gan Ning. Despite so, the two of them nearly exchanged blows in an incident during a banquet held in L√º Meng's house. When Ling Tong was performing a sword dance to entertain the guests, Gan Ning stood up and said: \\"I can also perform with my pair of jis.\\" L√º Meng told Gan Ning: \\"You may be good in performing, but you aren't as good as me.\\" He then drew his sword and carried a shield and stood between Ling Tong and Gan Ning to separate them. When Sun Quan heard about the incident, he reassigned Gan Ning to another garrison at Banzhou (ÂçäÂ∑û).(Âê≥Êõ∏Êõ∞ÔºöÂáåÁµ±ÊÄ®ÂØßÊÆ∫ÂÖ∂Áà∂ÊìçÔºåÂØßÂ∏∏ÂÇôÁµ±Ôºå‰∏çËàáÁõ∏Ë¶ã„ÄÇÊ¨ä‰∫¶ÂëΩÁµ±‰∏çÂæóËÆé‰πã„ÄÇÁîûÊñºÂëÇËíôËàçÊúÉÔºåÈÖíÈÖ£ÔºåÁµ±‰πÉ‰ª•ÂàÄËàû„ÄÇÂØßËµ∑Êõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂØßËÉΩÈõôÊàüËàû„ÄÇ„ÄçËíôÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÂØßÈõñËÉΩÔºåÊú™Ëã•Ëíô‰πãÂ∑ß‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂõ†ÊìçÂàÄÊåÅÊ•ØÔºå‰ª•Ë∫´ÂàÜ‰πã„ÄÇÂæåÊ¨äÁü•Áµ±ÊÑèÔºåÂõ†‰ª§ÂØßÂ∞áÂÖµÔºåÈÅÇÂæôÂ±ØÊñºÂçäÂ∑û„ÄÇ) Wu Shu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 55. Battle of Xiaoyao Ford After reaffirming his alliance with Liu Bei, Sun Quan personally led an army to attack Hefei, which was defended by Cao Cao's general Zhang Liao, in order to divert Cao Cao's attention away from Hanzhong Commandery. Ling Tong served as a Commandant of the Right Section (Âè≥ÈÉ®Áù£) during this campaign.(... ÂæûÂæÄÂêàËÇ•ÔºåÁÇ∫Âè≥ÈÉ®Áù£„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 55. Sun Quan's forces suffered heavy losses in the early skirmishes against Zhang Liao and were unable to conquer Hefei. When a plague broke out among his troops, Sun Quan decided to give up on the campaign and retreat. At Xiaoyao Ford (ÈÄçÈÅôÊ¥•), Sun Quan's other divisions retreated first while Sun Quan himself remained behind with about only 1,000 men and a few officers, including L√º Meng, Jiang Qin, Ling Tong and Gan Ning. When Zhang Liao saw that, he immediately led his troops out of Hefei to launch a counterattack and completely took Sun Quan by surprise. Sun Quan wanted to recall the divisions which had retreated first but realised they could not return in time. Ling Tong led 300 men to break into the enemy encirclement to rescue his lord.(ÂáåÁµ±ÁéáË¶™ËøëÊâ∂Ê¨äÂá∫ÂúçÔºåÂæ©ÈÇÑËàáÈÅºÊà∞„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 67. After Sun Quan managed to escape by making his horse jump across the broken bridge and reach the other side of the ford, Ling Tong returned to the battlefield and continued to fight on and slay dozens of enemies. He sustained several wounds all over his body and all his men were killed. He only retreated when he assessed the situation and concluded that Sun Quan was safe.(Âª∫ÂÆâ‰∫åÂçÅÂπ¥ÔºåÂæûÊîªÂêàËÇ•ÔºåÊúÉÁñ´ÁñæÔºåËªçÊóÖÁöÜÂ∑≤ÂºïÂá∫ÔºåÂîØËªä‰∏ãËôéÂ£´ÂçÉÈ§ò‰∫∫ÔºåÂπ∂ÂëÇËíô„ÄÅËî£Ê¨Ω„ÄÅÂáåÁµ±ÂèäÂØßÔºåÂæûÊ¨äÈÄçÈÅôÊ¥•Âåó„ÄÇÂºµÈÅºË¶òÊúõÁü•‰πãÔºåÂç≥Â∞áÊ≠•È®éÂ•ÑËá≥„ÄÇ ...

As the bridge had already been destroyed, Ling Tong had to wade through the water with his armour on. By then, Sun Quan had already boarded a ship and he was surprised and delighted to see Ling Tong still alive. Ling Tong was very saddened as all his close aides had died and he could not contain his sorrow. Sun Quan wiped Ling Tong's tears and said: \\"Gongji, let the dead go. As long as you live, why worry that you will have no men under you?\\" As Ling Tong's injuries were very severe, Sun Quan kept him on board the ship and let him have a change of clothing.

Since the southern part of China was not directly administered by the Han government even though it was Han territory in name, the Shanyue people performed regular raids against Han citizens to gather living essentials.(ÊôÇËßÄÈñìÈöôÔºåÂá∫ÁÇ∫ÂØáÁõúÔºå......Ëá™Ââç‰∏ñ‰ª•‰æÜÔºå‰∏çËÉΩÁæà‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 64. The Shanyue had been a nuisance for the Sun family and their forces since they first set foot in Jiangdong. Sun Quan had launched countless campaigns against them, but to no avail because the Shanyue had been living in the hills for a long time, were familiar with the area, and would go into hiding once they lost a battle. However, Ling Tong attempted a different approach to deal with the Shanyue. He proposed that Sun Quan attempt to win the hearts of the Shanyue and assimilate them instead of purely using military force to hamper them. He reasoned that if they could impress the Shanyue with the dignity of Sun Quan's administration and potential rewards, the Shanyue would succumb to them without bloodshed. After he was granted the staff of authority to request materiel from counties when required, he led a unit with flamboyant weapons and armour to begin his grand tactics. When the Shanyue discovered Sun Quan's forces after the latter had already ventured deep into their territories, they were indeed stunned by Ling Tong's unit; then Ling came out and told them if they would join Sun Quan's army, handsome rewards would be offered. Ling Tong's plan was a great success ‚Äì tens of thousands of Shanyue men came out from their homes and joined him. He then selected 10,000 able-bodied men to form a unit and returned.(Áµ±‰ª•Â±±‰∏≠‰∫∫Â∞öÂ§öÂ£ØÊÇçÔºåÂèØ‰ª•Â®ÅÊÅ©Ë™ò‰πüÔºåÊ¨ä‰ª§Êù±Âç†‰∏îË®é‰πãÔºåÂëΩÂãëÂ±¨ÂüéÔºåÂá°Áµ±ÊâÄÊ±ÇÔºåÁöÜÂÖàÁµ¶ÂæåËÅû„ÄÇÁµ±Á¥†ÊÑõÂ£´ÔºåÂ£´‰∫¶ÊÖïÁÑâ„ÄÇÂæóÁ≤æÂÖµËê¨È§ò‰∫∫Ôºå ...)

Death During his journey to the Shanyue territories, Ling Tong passed by his hometown and stopped there for a visit. He treated the townsfolk with the utmost respect and humility even though he had achieved fame and glory. He died of illness on the return journey at the age of 28. When Sun Quan heard of Ling Tong's death, he was filled with grief for several days. In recognition of Ling Tong's contributions to his regime, Sun Quan ordered Zhang Cheng to write a eulogy for Ling Tong.(...

Sun Quan brought them to his palace and treated them as though they were his sons. When guests came to visit him, he pointed at Ling Tong's sons and said: \\"They are my tiger boys.\\" When Ling Tong's sons reached the age of seven or eight, Sun Quan ordered Ge Guang (ËëõÂÖâ) to teach them to read and write, and train them in horse-riding every ten days. When Ling Lie became older, in recognition of his father's meritorious service, Sun Quan granted him the title of a village marquis (‰∫≠‰æØ) and placed him in charge of the unit which used to be commanded by his father.

Appraisal Ling Tong respected and befriended members of the scholar-gentry. They admired him even though he was a military serviceman. Being receptive, he had a reputation for being accommodating towards men of talent. Even when he was busy with work, he always took time to receive visitors. He viewed righteousness and loyalty as important values and saw wealth as inferior. He was thus praised by Chen Shou as a guoshi. Once, Sun Quan's subjects recommended a famous talent, Sheng Xian, to him. Ling Tong was asleep when he heard that Sheng Xian had arrived to meet his lord.

Ling Tong was reputed to have a strong sense of righteousness. During the battle at Nan Commandery, Zhou Yu ordered Gan Ning to attack Yiling (Â§∑Èôµ; around present-day Yichang, Hubei). Cao Ren sent an army to attack Gan Ning and had him surrounded. Gan Ning hurriedly requested for reinforcements, but the generals did not have enough men to spare to save him and believed it was not sagacious to send reinforcements because that would dilute the main army. L√º Meng spoke up, saying that they should help Gan Ning. He proposed to Zhou Yu that Ling Tong stay behind to keep Cao Ren in check while the rest of the generals go to reinforce Gan Ning. L√º Meng boldly asserted that he had confidence that Ling Tong could hold on for ten days. Ling Tong then took up his duties with responsibility. He countered Cao Ren's attacks alone, and bought time for the other generals to rescue Gan Ning. Ling Tong was also brave in admitting his mistakes and displayed fervent determination in his actions. In his earlier years, he struck down a superior officer called Chen Qin, who earlier insulted him and his late father. The incident caused Chen Qin to die of severe wounds several days later. Ling Tong then fought recklessly in the battle against the bandits after exclaiming that only through death could he cleanse his deep guilt. Thus, his attack turned out to be a huge success, yet he bound himself and surrendered to the discipline officer after the victorious battle to await his punishment. However, Sun Quan pardoned him on account of his achievements and promoted him to a higher military rank. In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Ling Tong is a character in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. Although his role in the novel is generally similar to that of his historical counterpart, his conflict with Gan Ning is highly dramatised. In Chapter 67, during a banquet to celebrate their victory over Cao Cao's forces at Wan County, Ling Tong feels jealous when he sees L√º Meng praising Gan Ning so he offers to perform a sword dance and wants to use the opportunity to kill Gan Ning and avenge his father. Gan Ning senses Ling Tong's intention so he also offers to perform with his pair of jis. When L√º Meng realises that they are about to get into a fight, he draws his sword, carries a shield and stands in the middle to separate them. When Sun Quan hears about the incident, he comes to the banquet hall, orders them to lay down their weapons, and chides them for fighting among themselves. As Ling Tong kneels down and weeps, Sun Quan tries to calm him down and repeatedly urges him to stop provoking Gan Ning.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 67. In Chapter 68, after the Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, when Ling Tong engages Yue Jin in a duel, Cao Xiu fires an arrow which hits Ling Tong's horse and causes Ling Tong to fall off the horse's back. Just as Yue Jin moves in for the kill, he suddenly gets hit by an arrow in the face. Both sides immediately rush forth to rescue their respective generals and withdraw their forces after that. Later, Ling Tong is surprised to learn that it was Gan Ning who saved him. He kneels down, thanks Gan Ning for saving his life, and begs for forgiveness. Gan Ning forgives him. Since then, Ling Tong forgets his past feud with Gan Ning and they become close friends.Sanguo Yanyi ch. 68. In popular culture Ling Tong is featured as a playable character in Koei's Dynasty Warriors and Warriors Orochi video game series. He also appears in all instalments of Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms NotesReferences * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

He graduated at Columbia College, studied under Sir Astley Cooper in London, and also spent a winter in Edinburgh. After acting as demonstrator of anatomy he was appointed professor of surgery in Columbia College in 1809. From 1811 to 1834 he was in very extensive practice as a surgeon, and most successful as a teacher and operator. He tied the innominate artery in 1818; the patient lived twenty-six days. He performed a similar operation on the carotid forty-six times with good results; and in 1827 he was also successful in the case of the common iliac. He is said to have performed one thousand amputations and one hundred and sixty-five lithotomies. After spending seven years in Europe (1834-1841) Mott returned to New York where he was on the founding faculty of the university medical college of New York, now New York University School of Medicine. He translated AALM Velpeau's Operative Surgery, and was foreign associate of the Imperial Academy of Medicine of Paris. A collection of his correspondence is held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. Family Dr. Valentine Mott by Anson Dickinson c. 1820 In 1849, the same year he was elected President of the New York Academy of Medicine, Mott and his wife, the former Louisa Dunmore Munn, moved to a four-story Italianate brownstone mansion at #1 Gramercy Park West with their large family. The couple had 9 children: 6 sons, including Alexander Brown Mott (1826-1889), Valentine Mott, Jr. (1822-1854), and Thaddeus P.

The industry that followed the construction of the canals transformed the ancient manor of Selley. The junction of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal and the Netherton Canal via the Lapal Tunnel created a distribution centre for heavy raw materials from the Black Country.White, Reverend Alan: The Worcester and Birmingham Canal ‚Äì Chronicles of the Cut (Brewin 2005) p53 Major industries developed along both sides of the two canals. Terraced housing, for the better off working people, was constructed on the former Selly Hill, Selly Grove, and Selly Oak estates. The High Street provided retail, entertainment, and public services. The property of Sir Henry Gough Calthorpe of Edgbaston was protected by clauses in the Canal Bill prohibiting the construction of wharves, warehouses, and other buildings along with other restrictive concessions.White, Reverend Alan: The Worcester and Birmingham Canal ‚Äì Chronicles of the Cut (Brewin 2005) p13 The Bournbrook rifle range, on the Warwickshire side of the watercourse, was opened in 1860 as the training ground for the Birmingham Rifle Corps later known as the First Volunteer Battalion of the Royal Warwickshire Regiment.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) - Volunteers of the present day Trams from Birmingham initially stopped at Selly Oak Gate, the county boundary on the turnpike road, or at the Gun Barrels Public House.

In response to this practice, fourteen of Selly Oak‚Äôs community groups have formed a federation ‚ÄòCP4SO‚Äô (Community Partnership for Selly Oak) to address the major issues that the ‚ÄòBuy to Let, to convert‚Äô might be causing. The Local Action Plan, adopted in July 2001, identifies that: an area of restraint was proposed for the area between Bristol Road, Heeley Road, Raddlebarn Road, and Bournbrook Road. Within this area planning permission for further purpose built student accommodation may be refused. Planning permission is required for the conversion of dwellings for more than six people, or where people do not live as a single household. Planning approval may be refused throughout the Plan area, but particularly within the area of restraint.\\"Birmingham City Council: Selly Oak Local Action Plan (July 2001) p39 Toponymy The name 'Bourn' is derived from the Old English burna or bourne for brook or stream when it had gravel beds and was characterised by clear water and submerged water plants. By contrast ‚Äòbroc‚Äô usually denotes muddy streams with sediment laden with water. Normally both words were used for streams of a considerable size.Chinn, Carl: One Thousand years of Brum (Birmingham Evening Mail 1999) Transport and Communications Roads BCTC's Car No. 104 outside the tram shed in Dawlish Road, Bournbrook, in 1891. This vehicle still survives at the Black Country Living Museum. The Bristol Road was turnpiked in the early 18th century. The original line of the road, before 1771, went by way of Edgbaston Park Road which began opposite Bournbrook Road, alongside Edgbaston Park, along Priory Road, Church Road, Arthur Road, Wheeley‚Äôs Road, Bath Row, Holloway Head, and Smallbrook Ringway. A new section of the turnpike was made in 1771 at a cost of ¬£5,000, starting at Bristol Street and joining the old road at the Gun Barrels.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p7 The first horse-drawn tram service from Birmingham began in the 1870s and went as far as the Bournbrook Hotel. Hughes ran an experimental steam powered service between Monmouth Street and Bournbrook on 2 July 1880, the latter distance being covered in twenty-five minutes with a car load of passengers attached to the engine.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) p329 From 1890-1900 accumulator battery trams were in use connecting Birmingham to Bournbrook. A year later electric cables were introduced to replace the batteries. The tram sheds between Dawlish Road and Tiverton Road are now the Douper Hall of Residence. The depot in Dawlish Road was replaced by one opened in 1927 in Chapel Lane. The depot in Harborne Lane was used for buses which replaced the trams. The former Bristol Road tram route and its depots were replaced by buses in 1952. The depot closed in 1986 and is in use as Access storage centre.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) pp48-50 Canals The Lapal Tunnel and the Dudley Canal were completed in 1798 and raw materials, especially coal and lime, for heavy industry were transported into Selly Oak from the Black Country and then to the River Severn, or to Oxford and London via the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal. The Worcester and Birmingham Canal commenced in 1791 and was completed in 1815 with the lifting of the Worcester Bar in Birmingham. Industrial activity developed along its banks from Bournbrook to Lifford. The industry stopped abruptly at the boundary with Edgbaston because of clauses inserted in the Bill that protected the property of Sir Henry Gough-Calthorpe by prohibiting the construction of wharves, warehouses and other buildings without his consent.White, Reverend Alan: The Worcester and Birmingham Canal ‚Äì Chronicles of the Cut (Studley 2005) p13 The embankment near Wheeleys Road, gave way on 26 May 1872 causing considerable damage to the properties nearby. By an agreement of 1873 this canal was sold to the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal Co, otherwise the Sharpness Dock Co.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) p29 A boatyard on the Dudley Canal was established and run by the Monk family for many years. A final roof fall in 1917 resulted in the closure of the Lapal tunnel. The canal continued to be used transporting bricks from the California brickworks.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p44 Planning is underway to reopen the section of the canal through the new Sainsbury‚Äôs site. Eventually it is hoped to re-connect the canal at Halesowen. Railways The Birmingham West Suburban Railway line from Granville Street to King‚Äôs Norton was opened in 1876 with five stations. The single track was doubled and extended from Granville Street to New Street, at an estimated cost of ¬£280,400, so that the Midland Railway had a direct run through the town.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) p265 It was later incorporated into the Midland Railway and the terminus changed to New Street. During the Great War casualties were brought to Selly Oak and transferred to the First Southern and General Military Hospital which was housed in the new University of Birmingham buildings. The railway was carried over the Bristol Road by an embankment and multi-arched viaduct. In the 1920s the central part of the viaduct was replaced with the current steel bridge in order that the new higher trams could pass underneath. The new bridge followed a slightly different alignment. The arches that were used as by Vincent‚Äôs timber depot have recently been cleared. The current car park occupies the area that once housed significant goods sidings that could hold up to 300 wagons. The sidings were mainly used for the conveyance of coal and a coal merchant‚Äôs stood on the site for many years.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p46 Bournbrook is served by Selly Oak railway station on the Cross-City Line, providing services to the Birmingham New Street, Lichfield Trent Valley and Redditch stations. History Prehistoric Along the Bourn Brook evidence has been found of Bronze Age burnt mounds. As these have been interpreted as having domestic use, for beer-making, or saunas the implication is that there may have been a prehistoric settlement nearby.Hodder, Michael: Birmingham ‚Äì The Hidden History; Stroud 2004, pp28-44 Small pieces of prehistoric, Probably Iron Age, pottery and a piece of worked flint were found on the Selly Park Recreation Ground in 1996 which may indicate the site of an Iron Age farmstead in the vicinity. Roman Metchley FortJones, Alex: Roman Birmingham 1 ‚Äì Metchley Roman Forts (Transactions BWAS V105 2001) occupied a site nearby distributing goods such as salt from Droitwich to places further north and west. It is probable that they upgraded existing tracks. At some point they would have needed to ford the brook and Bournbrook seems a likely place with the possibility of local support for periods when the area was flooded. Anglo- Saxon Until 1911 the Bourn Brook was the ancient Anglo-Saxon boundary between Worcestershire and Staffordshire (Harborne), and Warwickshire (Edgbaston). The boundaries of the Midland shires were possibly established during the reign of the Danish Kings from 1016-1042 based on the former tribal kingdoms.Hooke, Della: The Anglo-Saxon Landscape, MUP 1985 Physical features were frequently used to identify the boundary of a region or estate. The Hamlet of Bournbrook developed at a crossing point of the Bourn Brook. Potentially it was a meeting place for the nobility of each of the shires. The Bourn Brook, which flows into River Rea near in Cannon Hill Park, is the Ward boundary.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p10 =Bourn Brook Mills= The Bourn Brook was in continuous use to power mills for several centuries. Harborne Mill was in Staffordshire until 1891. Pebble Mill and Edgbaston Mill were both in Warwickshire.Manzoni, Herbert J: Report on the Survey ‚ÄìWritten Analysis (Birmingham City Council 1952) p7 Another mill was shown in 1787-9 on the most westerly of the streams from Edgbaston Pool where it joined the Bourn Brook near the Bristol Road.VCH Warwickshire Volume VII, OUP 1964, p253 and p266. This may be the old silver rolling mill owned by Mr Spurrier referred to by Leonard, located near the present Eastern Road that was fed by the brook that ran from Edgbaston Pool.Leonard, Francis W: The Story of Selly Oak (St Mary‚Äôs Parochial Church Council 1933) p7 http://www.users.waitrose.com/~stmarysellyoak/History/The%20Story%20of%20Selly%20Oak.pdf A miller was mentioned in the Lechmere Tax Rolls for Weleye and Selleye in 1276-82.Willis Bund, J W and Amphlett, J (editors): Lay Subsidy Roll for the County of Worcester c1280 p17 (WHS 1893)https://archive.org/stream/laysubsidyrollfo00greauoft#page/16/mode/2up An archaeological excavation identified that the straightening of the Bourn Brook and the construction of the mill leat suggests that the site of the Bourn Brook Mill was medieval in origin and that a mill or mills had existed in roughly the same location for 500‚Äì600 years. Deposits from the relict water channels were radiocarbon dated to the 15th and 16th centuries. The fishponds that the leat drained into would also have to be of late medieval date. Further opportunity to discover the location of the medieval mill will be useful to inform the local and regional research cycles.HEAS: Archaeological Excavation at Bourn Brook, Selly Oak, Birmingham, Project 2482, Report 1253, BSMR 20726 (Worcestershire County Council 2004) ps13-14 In the 16th century the King family had a fulling mill on the Bourn Brook. Henry Cambden the elder, a knife cutler, built a blade mill on part of Gower‚Äôs Farm in 1707. In 1727 the mill was assigned to Henry Carver, a brass founder. The Gunsmiths, Heeley and Company, is recorded as occupying the mill in 1816.Chinn, Carl: One Thousand years of Brum (Birmingham Evening Mail 1999) pp22-23 The Tithe Map of 1839 shows the land owned by James Kerby included a forge.Tithe Map and Apportionments of Northfield Parish, Worcestershire 1839 An 1861 advertisement for sale of the Bourn Brook Estate (Worcestershire) describes a rolling mill in the occupation of the Bourne Brook Iron Company within a short distance of the mining district.Birmingham Daily Post 16/8/1861 Sale of Kirby‚Äôs Pools An iron founder and metal roller, Noah Fellows occupied it in 1863. Arthur Holden, a paint manufacturer was the occupant in 1873. From 1880 Frederick Spurrier worked the mill for rolling joined in 1908 by Henry Spurrier. =Farms= The Tithe Map shows that in 1839 there were seven farms in Selly Oak. Selly Farm was on the corner of Warwards Lane and St Stephen‚Äôs Road. It was referred to in 1809.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p13 It was replaced by a petrol filling station in the 1970s and is now St Stephen‚Äôs Court, students‚Äô apartments. Raddlebarn Farm was formerly Raddle Barn Doors Farm in a reference of 1776. It had 50 acres and was mainly used for grazing cattle. The farmhouse survived until 1974 when it was replaced with a row of modern terraced houses. The cowshed remained until the 1990s being used as a fabric shop and Kaplan‚Äôs.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p12 Bournbrook Farm was at the junction of Exeter and Dawlish Roads. It was owned by John Heeley, a gunmaker who owned Bournbrook Forge and Mill. The track became a road extending as far as the Bristol Road just before the development of the estate began in the 1870s. The other farms gradually disappeared under the pressure of increasing industrialisation and the demand for building land. Selly Hill Farm was converted into Selly Hill House a minor country residence and Langleys Farm became ‚ÄòThe Langleys‚Äô.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p8 & pp12-13 =Kerby's Pools= The 1839 Tithe Map and Apportionments for Northfield Parish, Worcestershire, show that in Bournbrook James Kerby owned 43 acres of land that included pools, a forge, and the Bell and Shovel Inn.Tithe Apportionments for Northfield Parish, Worcestershire, 1839 Kerby‚Äôs Pools was a Victorian pleasure resort in Bournbrook. Its three pools were devoted to boating and fishing and there was also a leisure garden. People would travel in great numbers to enjoy the entertainment and facilities the resort offered. Showell describes it as ‚Äúa well-known and favourite resort on the outskirt of the borough, on the Bristol Road, and formerly one of the celebrated taverns and tea gardens of past days‚Äù. There were a variety of attractions and events like fireworks displays. It was one of few spots for fishing within walking distance of Birmingham.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) p76 Sadly there were some accidents: on 17 May 1875 Lawrence Joyce was drowned when the boat upset, and two men were drowned 23 July 1876.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) p4 The pools were filled in during the 1880s as the spread of heavy industry and the construction of terraced housing for the workers diminished the rural attractiveness of the location. In 1878 a cricket match was played at Bournbrook. At least 3,000 spectators were present when the game commenced at noon on Wednesday 25 June 1878. This number had risen to 12,000 by close of play. For the first two days batting, bowling, and fielding were excellent. Sadly, a thunderstorm on the final day resulted in the pitch flooding and the game was abandoned.The Australian Cricketers at Bournbrook versus a Birmingham and District Twenty-Two, Birmingham Daily Gazette 25‚Äì27 June 1878 =Selly Oak Institute= George Cadbury was a teacher with the Adult School Movement. When he moved his chocolate factory to Bournville he created purpose built Institutes in Selly Oak, Stirchley, and Northfield to serve the working community. In 1894 he extended the coffee house he had built for the workers of the Selly Oak and Bournbrook villages to include a meeting place for the Society of Friends, and for use by other groups. When Elliott needed the Workman‚Äôs Hall for his manager of the Elliott‚Äôs Metal Company Ltd the Adult School moved to the Selly Oak Institute located in Bournbrook. The Institute is a listed building. It was described as having a large club room containing three billiard tables, three committee rooms, and a large hall suited for concerts and dramatic performance. Various groups met there including a choir and a band. The Institute was used by others including the Traders and Ratepayers Association, and the police who held a court there twice a month. In 1899 it boasted a temperance tavern ‚ÄòThe Cyclists Arms‚Äô. In 1937 it was the address of the relieving officer and the registrar of births, marriages, and deaths, as well as a Men‚Äôs Social Club, a girls‚Äô gymnastic club, Selly Oak Choral Union and Miss Christine Boyse who taught dancing. The Institute continued to hold Adult Education courses and facilitate community groups that have recently been relocated to the Hubert Road premises.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time, (Stroud 2012) =Selly Oak Water Pumping Station= The tall brick and terracotta building that resembles a French Gothic chapel was the Selly Oak Water Pumping Station. In the middle of the 19th century piped water gradually became available throughout the Birmingham area due to six wells that were built on the outskirts of the city. Although built in the 1870s by Birmingham Corporation Water Department it wasn‚Äôt opened until 1879 by Joseph Chamberlain. Following the successful construction, in 1904, of the Elan Valley pipeline the well was retained in case of emergencies but was finally capped in 1920. The beam engine was built by Messrs.' James Watt and Co. and produced 1¬º million gallons each day. The site is now owned by Western Power.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p38 Community Shops on the Bristol Road (A38 road) in Bournbrook =Public Houses= Bournbrook Tavern, Bristol Road, was a Mitchells & Butlers pub with an unofficial name of ‚ÄòThe Steps‚Äô due to a flight of steps up to the entrance. It may have replaced an earlier pub called the Bowling Green InnPearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p10 It was replaced by The Brook which has since been demolished and a hall of residence for students is now on the site.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p119 In the 1881 census the Bristol Pear, on the corner of Bristol Road and Heeley Road, was the Heeley Arms the 1881 census shows with Thomas Thompson as publican. It changed its name to the Station Inn before adopting its current name.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p36 Goose at the OVT The Inn was reported to have existed in c1700. On the 1839 Tithe Map the owner was James Kerby and it was called the Bell and Shovel Inn. Under the ownership of George North from 1859 the name changed to the Malt Shovel. Showell records that the public house, belonging to Holt‚Äôs brewery, having been extended and partially rebuilt, and the grounds better laid out, the establishment was re-christened, and opened as the Bournbrook Hotel at Whitsuntide in 1877.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) p66 & 118 For a short time it was a Firkin Pub, and it is now the Goose at the OVT. The Gun Barrels was just in Edgbaston. During the late 19th century the pub became popular for prize fights because as the Bourn Brook was the county boundary, the pugilists could escape from the local police by crossing the brook which was beyond their jurisdiction. The pub had been rebuilt by 1987 and has since been demolished. An earlier building called The Grinders appears at this location on an 1819 turnpike map. It may have been named after William Deakin‚Äôs Gun Barrel Manufactory at Bournbrook in 1841.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p73 Like many rural inns the pub had an adjacent bowling green which may also have been used for croquet. The Plough and Harrow was formerly called the New Inn in 1900 (delete) and took the name Plough and Harrow in 1904. The records of the Birmingham District of the Manchester Unity of Oddfellows show a lodge was located at the New Inn, in Selly Oak.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) p82 The squirrel motif of Holt‚Äôs Brewery can be seen on the gable. Holts Brewery was founded in 1887 in Aston, but in 1934 became Ansells Brewery Ltd. It was demolished pre 1987.Marks, John: Birmingham Inns and Pubs (Reflections of a Bygone Age 1992) p29 The Goose at the Old Varsity Tavern (formerly the Bournbrook Hotel), Market Place, Bournbrook =Tiverton Road Public Baths= The Tiverton Pool and Fitness Centre originally opened in Bournbrook on 28 January 1906 as Tiverton Road Public Baths. They were built by King's Norton and Northfield District Council to the design of E Harding Payne and built by a local building firm, T A Cole & Son. There were two swimming baths, one with a gallery for spectators, a children's bath and separate private baths for men and women. The larger men‚Äôs swimming pool would be floored over in the winter months and the floorspace was used for concerts, political meetings, and dances. A smaller, shallower swimming bath, with steps down into it was provided for women and children. In 1911, it was taken over by Birmingham Baths Committee. More recently it has been converted into a health centre and now includes a \\"Pulse Point\\" gym as well as sunbeds and a sauna whilst retaining the swimming pool, the children's pool which is used as a smaller instruction pool and pool spectator seating facilities. =Selly Oak Library= The land on which the free library was built was donated by Thomas Gibbins (junior), a local councillor as well as being an industrialist. The philanthropic organisation, the Carnegie Foundation, financed the building.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p94 Education In Bournbrook there is one surviving primary school: Tiverton Junior and Infant School. St Mary‚Äôs C of E Primary School opened as a National School in 1860 with accommodation for 252 children. It was enlarged in 1872 and ten years later the boys and girls were separated. St Mary‚Äôs National School was opened in Hubert Road Bournbrook in 1885 the girls were transferred there and the National School was used for boys and infants. In 1898 the schools were united for administration and called Selly Oak and Bournbrook Schools. A third department was opened in 1898, in Dawlish Road, to accommodate 545 senior girls and the Infants department. Bournbrook School was used for boys with additional accommodation for 200 boys provided at the Bournbrook Technical Institute from 1901-3. The Selly Oak and Bournbrook Temporary Council School was opened by King‚Äôs Norton and Northfield Urban District Council in 1903 in the room that was previously used as an annexe of Selly Oak and Bournbrook C of E School. The premises were not satisfactory and the school was closed in 1904 when Raddlebarn Lane Temporary Council School was opened. The schools were separated again in 1914 with the 1885 Hubert Road and 1898 Dawlish Road buildings becoming St Wulstan‚Äôs C of E school. In 1946 accommodation was also provided in the People‚Äôs Hall, Oak Tree Lane. St Mary‚Äôs National School Bournbrook was closed in 1939 due to dwindling numbers. The Dawlish Road premises were sold in 1940 as a warehouse but bought by Birmingham Education Committee in 1952 to be an annexe to Tiverton Road County Primary School. Tiverton County Primary School was opened in 1906 by King‚Äôs Norton and Northfield Urban District Council with accommodation for 510 children. Bournbrook Congregational Church provided accommodation for two classes in 1952. The buildings of the former St Wulstan‚Äôs C of E School were bought in 1952 for an extension to the school. In 1954 the name was changed to Tiverton Road School.Stevens, W B (Editor), VCH Warwick Volume VII: The City of Birmingham, (OUP 1964) There was a small Quaker boarding school for twelve boys aged eight to sixteen in a building at the junction of Selly Park Road and Oakfield Road. Although no longer a school, the building was destroyed by a bomb during the Second World War and new houses have now been built on the site.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park (Tempus 2005) p80 Selly Oak Nursery School was founded in Greet in 1904, but in 1921 the school moved to premises in Tiverton Road which had been equipped by Mr. and Mrs. George Cadbury Junior.Butler, Joanne; Baker, Anne; Southworth, Pat: Selly Oak and Selly Park. Stroud 2005 p80 Places of Worship The following is from the (1964) VCH City of Birmingham Stevens, W B (Editor): VCH Warwick Volume VII: The City of Birmingham (OUP 1964) pp354-485 An Un-denominational church in Alton Road was registered for public worship from 1912 to 1945. Bournbrook Chapel, a brick building seating 250 in Elmdon Road, was opened by members of Selly Oak (Bristol Road) Primitive Methodist church in 1901. In 1932 there was a church membership of 54. Bournbrook Church Hall, Dartmouth Road, was built in 1932 with seating for 350. The church was formed in 1894 and in 1902, when services were being held in a corrugated iron building, numbered 30 members. For some years after 1902 Dartmouth Road was a mission of Francis Road. The vacant chapel has been converted into the Jalalabad Mosque and Islamic Centre.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p66 Bournbrook Elim Church, Alton Road, was formerly an un-denominational mission, was acquired in 1944. The congregation, founded from Graham Street, had formerly met in a hired hall. The Church membership in 1957 was 110. Bournbrook Gospel Hall, Tiverton Road was registered for public worship in 1895 and is probably identifiable with the Selly Oak Hall which claimed, in 1892, to have a Sunday evening congregation of 70. It was open in 1957. Tiverton Christian Fellowship began in 1890 before obtaining the land in Tiverton Road. In 1894 George Cadbury opened the Selly Oak Institute which was used as a place of worship until the new meeting-house was built in 1927. In 1899 the institute consisted of a main hall, ancillary rooms, and a temperance tavern, or ‚Äòcyclists Arms‚Äô. In 1954 there was said to be an average Sunday attendance at the meeting-house of 70. St John‚Äôs Methodist Church was opened by the Wesleyans in 1835, and provided sittings for 108. It was replaced in 1877 by a new chapel costing ¬£2,414 which provided sittings for 350. Important extensions were notified to the Wesleyan Chapel Committee in 1909. In 1940 St John‚Äôs was described as a brick building seating 494 with a school hall and seven other ancillary rooms. The church originated in cottage meetings which followed the appointment in 1829 of C Bridgewater as inspector of tolls at the Selly Oak locks. There was a Sunday evening congregation of 35 in 1851, and a Sunday afternoon attendance of 118 in 1892. It was enlarged in 1910 and had a school hall. Church membership in 1932 was 150. It closed in 1957 when the congregation joined with the Primitive Methodists. After being used for less dignified functions it was demolished in the late 1970s. Lookers car salesroom now occupies the site.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p57 St Paul‚Äôs Church was opened by the Primitive Methodists in 1874. The congregation was founded in 1870 and met at first in the open air, then in cottages, and finally in a hired dance-hall, before the first chapel was built. In 1892 there was a Sunday afternoon attendance of 107. In c1908 a new brick chapel seating 500 was built which had, in 1940, five ancillary rooms, one of which was built as a school hall. Church membership in 1932 was 193. It was used after the two Methodist congregations were united until moving to a new Methodist church in Langley's Road in 1966. St Stephen‚Äôs, Selly Hill: As the congregation of St Mary‚Äôs, the parish church grew, a chapel of ease was created in Selly Hill and a Mission in Dawlish Road. Robert Dolphin, who had bought Selly Hall and its farm lands in 1835, donated the land. St Stephen‚Äôs was designed by Martin and Chamberlain in the decorated style. Contributions for the building of the church came from several notable businessmen: William Docker, Charles Winn, Thomas Webley, and Lord Calthorpe. The first stone was laid on 30 March 1870 and the St Stephen‚Äôs Church was consecrated on 18 August 1871. The patrons are the Bishop and trustees; the living is valued at ¬£200; it is a perpetual curacy, and the incumbent is the Rev. R Stokes, M.A. Of the 300 sittings 100 are free.Showell, Walter: Dictionary of Birmingham (Walter Showell and Sons 1885) p237 The parishes of parish of St Stephen and St Wulstan combined in 1980. The Lych-gate was added in 1924 St Wulstan‚Äôs mission church was consecrated as St Wulstans in 1906. The church was exchanged in 1983 with Elim Pentecostal Church. St Wulstan‚Äôs is now a smaller church in Alton Road Three Tin tabernacles or temporary missions are recorded in Bournbrook, Raddlebarn Road, and Dawlish Road Industry Industry in Bournbrook was varied but engineering and gun making were significant. Until the mid-sixties, Bournbrook was the home to Ariel motorcycles owned by first Charles Sangster then his son Jack Sangster, and with their main factory in Dale Road. Ariel was the first motorcycle company to employ noted designer Edward Turner from Peckham to join their established engineer, Val Page. He introduced the Ariel Square Four model and re-vamped their Ariel Red Hunter range. Ariel acquired Triumph motorcycles before the Second World War and, with Triumph, was itself later absorbed into the Birmingham Small Arms group when Jack Sangster joined their board. Although introducing new models, the Ariel Leader and Ariel Arrow, the Bournbrook site gradually lost importance within the BSA group with their final model, the ignominious Ariel 3 being wholly produced at Small Heath. The Binding Site Ltd was founded 1983 to replace BDS Biologicals which made kits for diagnosing and monitoring illnesses. It occupied part of the Boxfoldia factory in Dale Road during the 1990s until it moved to King‚Äôs Heath.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time, Stroud2012 Boxfoldia Ltd was founded in 1921 by Charles Henry Foyle. It began in Ten Acres and moved to Dale Road in 1933 where it took over a large part of the Ariel Works. The company moved to Redditch c1990.Butler, Joanne; Baker, A; Southworth, P: Selly Oak and Selly Park, Stroud 2005 Cycle Components Manufacturing Company was founded in 1895 and Charles Sangster bought the trade name ‚ÄòAriel‚Äô from the Dunlop Cycle Company. It was built on site of Kerby‚Äôs Pools. An Ariel cycle won the World Championships in 1897. First motor tricycle made in 1898 and the first motor cycle in 1905. About 200 people were employed in the 1930s. Charles went bankrupt in 1932 and the company was bought by his son Jack. It became part of BSA and moved to Small Heath.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p20 Engineering company, Decimals Ltd, were making phosphorus grenades and wire-cutters In Grange Road for the Great War. George Morgan Ltd, became incorporated in 1933. At the British Industries Fair in 1937 it was listed as a producer of drop forgings for the motor, motor-cycle, cycle, aircraft, shipbuilding, railway, and general engineering industries. They made parts for the Austin Motor Company at Longbridge. They traded from part of the Ariel factory until the mid-1980s.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p26 Greenwood Paige and Co Ltd was established in 1899 by R W Greenwood as fruit preservers. From 1905 until 1915 they occupied the ‚ÄúSeville Works‚Äù 193-199 Tiverton Road, which had previously been a steam laundry, Loffets Sweet Factory; Swish Curtain Rails; Patrick Motors Spare Parts Division. Another jam making factory was further along Tiverton Road. most of the fruit used was grown in the West Midlands Region: strawberries from Bromsgrove, currants from Stratford, plums from Evesham, and damsons from Shropshire.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p31 H W Ward and Company Ltd moved to Dale Road c1914. They were very significant producers of capstan and turret lathes. The buildings were demolished to make way for the new road and Halls of Residence for students at the University of Birmingham.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p21 Lewis Woolf Grip-tight Ltd owned a rubber plantation in the Far East. At the British Industries Fair its products were listed as patent pneumatic and non-pneumatic baby soothers, rubber teats, bottles, and flycatchers. They had various premises in Bournbrook: rear of 507 Bristol Road; Old School in Hubert Road for rubber processing; Offices 144 Oakfield Road; 508 Bristol Road shop used for storage; 519 Bristol Road as a canteen. They also used the former TASCOS building on the corner of Alton Road until it was destroyed in a massive fire. A dentists surgery now occupies the site.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p39 The Patent Enamel Company Ltd, founded in 1888, moved to a purpose built factory in Heeley Road in the following year. Benjamin Baugh had begun to manufacture tough vitreous enamelled sheet wrought iron in Bradford Street In 1857. He combined with William Walters, and H W Elliott to form the Patent Enamel Co Ltd. The products were used for advertising on railway stations, hotels and public houses. Competition and the improved paper posters and plastics caused the business to decline and the company closed in 1965. The site was occupied by several small firms until it was destroyed by fire. Comet moved onto the site and later moved onto the Battery Retail Park.White, Reverend Alan: The Worcester and Birmingham Canal ‚Äì Chronicles of the Cut: Studley 2005 Albert M Patrick founded Patrick Motors for his son Joseph A M Patrick. Beginning in 1930 it occupied the site of Edgbaston Garage Ltd on the Bristol Road. The company moved to Lakeside in King‚Äôs Norton where they had a museum of cars called the Patrick Collection. The site became Tesco Express.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p9 From the mid-1930s Sandvik Steel Band Conveyor & Engineering Co Ltd occupied the former tram sheds at 20 Dawlish Road. Their products include: cutting tools; equipment, tools, and services for mining and construction; and materials technology including steel belt process systems. In the 1970s they moved to Halesowen. The Douper Hall of Residence now occupies the site.Pearson, Wendy: Selly Oak and Bournbrook through time (Amberley 2012) p47 The now dilapidated building beside the library on the Bristol Road belonged to timber merchants W J Vincent & Co Ltd. They moved to Bournbrook in 1923 and had other premises including a storage area in Heeley Road beside the railway. In 1975 the business returned to Sparkbrook.

The station is licensed to Andover, Kansas, is owned by Entercom and broadcasts at 93.5 MHz with an ERP of 15 kW. The station's studios are located at North Woodlawn and East 21st in Northeast Wichita, while the transmitter is located at 1601 N. Rock Road in Wichita. KDGS was the only rhythmic-formatted station in Kansas until January 2015, when KKGQ debuted a Rhythmic Hot AC presentation (though that station would shift towards a more mainstream Hot AC format in October of that year). Although KDGS leans towards R&B;/Hip-Hop product, (KPRS in Kansas City is based in Missouri, and airs an urban contemporary format), it also counters rival KZCH's rhythmic-leaning Top 40/CHR direction. History The station that is now KDGS was assigned a construction permit for 93.9 FM on July 23, 1993, and issued as KOAS. The station officially signed on the air as KDLE on October 28, 1993, and aired an Adult Contemporary format. On May 4, 1994, KDLE flipped the format to Urban Contemporary, filling the void that was left by the previous incarnations of KBUZ, which resided at 106.5 and 99.1 respectively. On December 8, 1995, they changed calls to KDGS and shifted to a Rhythmic Contemporary Hit direction with Rhythmic Pop/Dance product incorporated into its R&B;/Hip-Hop fare, which they still continue with today. At some point in 1995, the station's moniker changed from \\"K-Dogs\\" to \\"Power 93.9.\\" In 1999, the station was acquired by Entercom Communications. KDGS was one of the first stations for Christopher \\"Kidd Chris\\" Foley, who is now at WEBN in Cincinnati as a weekday morning rock jock. Past Music Director Richard \\"Ricardo Cherry\\" Brugada was awarded Music Director of The Year in 1999 by S.I.N for the work he did with KDGS. Ricardo Cherry was the Music Director for KDGS from 1996-1999. He could also be heard as On-Air Talent from 1995-1999. On May 21, 2014, the station applied to the FCC to change their transmitter location from South Wichita (near to the I-135/I-235 interchange) to East Wichita, downgrade their power to 15,000 watts, and shift frequencies to 93.5 FM. This was due to an FCC order to avoid adjacent channel interference with Bott Radio Network's KCVW (94.3 FM), as they applied to relocate their transmitter from west of Cheney Reservoir in Reno County to the Wichita master antenna farm in western Sedgwick County near Colwich and upgrade their signal to 94,000 watts to effectively cover the entire Wichita market. On October 15, 2014, at Midnight, KDGS went dark on 93.9 FM; after 2 hours off air, the station officially completed its move to 93.5 FM.http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/90366/wichita-area-frequency-shifts- to-take-place-october-15/ KOTE in Eureka, broadcasting on 93.5 FM and owned by Niemeyer Communications, moved to 93.9 FM at the same time to reduce co- channel interference, effectively swapping frequencies between the two stations. In early 2015, the station's studio will move to the Ruffin Building at 9111 East Douglas, formerly the Pizza Hut headquarters.

It is primarily used for baseball, and is the second largest baseball stadium in the world by capacity. Gran Estadio, a spacious pitchers' park with prevailing winds blowing in and boasting a playing surface and lighting system of major-league quality, was built in 1946 as the top baseball park in Latin America. Located in the Cerro neighborhood, it opened with the name Gran Estadio de La Habana and currently holds about 55,000 people. In 1999, it also hosted an exhibition series between the Cuban National Team and the Baltimore Orioles. Overview The Estadio Latinoamericano is popularly known in Cuba as \\"The Colossus of Cerro\\". It was initially named Gran Estadio de La Habana (Great Stadium of Havana), but it was then named Estadio del Cerro (Stadium of Cerro) until 1961, when it was renamed as Estadio Latinoamericano (Latin American Stadium) when Cuban professional baseball was stopped. It opened on October 26, 1946, surpassing La Tropical Stadium as the largest stadium in Havana. History The stadium debuted on October 26, 1946 before a crowd of 31,000 fans for a clash between the Almendares and Cienfuegos baseball teams, the largest crowd that had attended a sports event in Cuba. Almendares won the game 9-1. The Venezuelan Alejandro Carrasquel, who played for the Washington Senators in the Major League, threw the first pitch of the game. In its 70 years, the stadium has been utilised for diverse spectacles including popular dance performances and boxing matches. The stadium was renovated and expanded in the year 1971, with an enlargement of its stands, increasing the stadium to its present capacity of 55,000 spectators, and an extension of its gardens. On March 22, 2016, the Tampa Bay Rays faced the Cuban national baseball team in an exhibition game. This was attended by numerous dignitaries, including President of the United States Barack Obama and Raul Castro. This game represented the thaw between the two countries that had occurred in recent years, and was broadcast live on ESPN. The Rays were selected after a lottery conducted by Major League Baseball. The Rays won 4-1. The stadium has also been used for political purposes. In 1956, it was the location of a student demonstration headed by Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a, against the Government of Fulgencio Batista.

The M67 is a further development of the M33 grenade, itself a replacement for the M26-series grenades used during the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and the older Mk 2 \\"pineapple\\" grenade used since World War I. Overview The M67 grenade has a spheroidal steel body that contains of composition B explosive. It uses the M213 pyrotechnic delay fuze. The M67 grenade weighs in total and has a safety clip to prevent the safety pin on the grenade from being pulled accidentally. The safety pin prevents the safety lever, or \\"spoon\\" on the grenade from moving and releasing the spring-loaded striker which initiates the grenade's fuse assembly.US Army Technical Manual 43-0001-29 Army Ammunition Data Sheets for Grenades The M67 is typically known as a \\"baseball\\" grenade, because it is shaped like a ball that can be easily thrown. The M67 can be thrown by the average male soldier. Its fuze delays detonation between 4 and 5 seconds after the spoon is released. Steel fragments (not to be confused with shrapnel) are provided by the grenade body and produce an injury radius of , with a fatality radius of , though some fragments can disperse as far out as .Army Study Guide: Hand Grenades Use To deploy the M67 grenade, the user first removes the safety clip from the grenade. Next, the grenade's pull ring is grasped with the non-throwing hand while maintaining a firm grasp on the body of the grenade and safety lever (also referred to as the \\"spoon\\") with the throwing hand. The pull ring and safety pin assembly are fitted so that a right-handed thrower can grasp the grenade with the fuse assembly on top and the safety lever held down by the right thumb. A left-handed thrower should grasp the grenade with the fuse assembly on the bottom and the safety lever held down by the left thumb. The user then pulls the grenade and pull ring assembly apart, removing the safety pin from the fuse assembly. At this time, the fuse remains unfired, as the throwing hand's thumb is holding the safety lever down. The user then throws the grenade at the intended target, taking care that the grenade does not strike an obstacle that could deflect the grenade, bounce it back towards the thrower or allow it to roll towards the thrower or an unintended place. When the grenade is thrown, the safety lever will fly free (under pressure from the striker spring) and the striker will hit the cap, igniting the pyrotechnic delay element. When the delay element has burned approximately 4 to 5 seconds it will initiate the grenade's explosive filler, causing a large number of metal fragments to be projected at high velocities. The thrower and friendly personnel in the vicinity should take cover to protect themselves from unintended injury. Variants=M33 Fragmentation Grenade= The M33 was the original successor to the M26 fragmentation grenade. It was essentially identical to the M67, but lacked the safety clip that is fitted to the safety lever of the M67. =M68 Fragmentation Grenade= This is a variant of the M67 fitted with the M217 impact fuze and a safety clip on the safety lever. This fuze has an electrical impact function which arms within 1 to 2 seconds and will detonate the grenade upon impact, and a back-up pyrotechnic delay function which will initiate the grenade after 3 to 7 seconds if the impact function fails. The M68 has the same specifications and markings as the M67 except it has a red-painted fuze and lever to indicate it has an impact fuze. =M33A1 and M59 Fragmentation Grenades= Predecessors to the M68, these impact fuzed grenades used the M33 grenade body fitted with the M217 impact fuze, without a safety clip on the safety lever, and are marked in a similar manner to the M68. =M69 Practice Grenade= The M69 grenade is used for grenade training to safely simulate the M67 grenade. The fuze screws into the body, and is replaceable after use. The simulator produces a report and small puff of white smoke when properly employed. The M69 has a blue-painted lever and a blue body. This is to indicate that it is a safe practice grenade rather than a live fragmentation grenade like the M33 or M67.

History=Beginning= The academy's establishment may be viewed as a result of the incorporation of the Left-Bank Ukraine into Muscovy after the Treaty of Pereyaslav. Under Fyodor Rtishchev's auspices, Epiphanius Slavinetsky and other learned monks moved from Kiev to Moscow and brought a taste for learning there. The Ukrainian and Polish influence was paramount at the court of Tsar Feodor III. In 1682, he signed the academy's charter (priviley), which had been elaborated by Sylvester Medvedev. The academy was organized in 1685-1687 under the guidance of two Greek brothers Joannicus and Sophronius Likhud on the premises of the Zaikonospassky Monastery with over 70 students. The academy was placed under the care of the Patriarch Prikaz. The curriculum was divided into several levels (\\"schools\\"), including Slavonic and Greek writing, seven liberal arts (septem artes liberales), and theology. The academy itself was named the \\"Greek Latin School\\", or \\"Spassky schools\\" (–°–ø–∞—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ —à–∫–æ–ª—ã). After the dismissal of the Likhud brothers in 1694, their students Fedor Polikarpov-Orlov and Nikolay Semyonov (Golovin) became teachers at the academy. By the beginning of the 18th century, there had been more than 200 students at the Slavic Greek Latin Academy. In 1701, Peter the Great turned it into a state academy. A celibate priest Palladius (Rogovsky), president of the academy, invited the graduates of Lvov and Kiev seminaries (so-called \\"brotherhood schools\\"), familiar with educational practices of Western Europe, to teach at the Slavic Greek Latin Academy. After that, the Latin language became the principal teaching language of the establishment. =Organization= Zaikonospassky monastery, where the academy used to be located. The curriculum consisted of two major stages, including elementary stage (grammar, arithmetics, geography, history, languages, dogmatism or theology) and highest stage (theory of poetry, rhetorics, philosophy, theology). The whole educational process lasted for 12 to 15 years. The education itself was similar to that of Western European universities. The Slavic Greek Latin Academy produced not only theologians, but specialists for civil service, as well, such as medical professionals and translators. During the reign of Peter the Great, the academy began to gradually turn into a higher theological educational establishment, as opposed to many new secular professional schools. In 1721, the Slavic Greek Latin Academy was transferred under the care of the Holy Synod. =In the 18th century= Throughout the first half of the 18th century, the Slavic Greek Latin Academy had been considered the center of Russian culture and enlightenment. Its graduates turned out to be the most prepared for continuing education at the Academic University within the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences (founded in 1725), foreign universities, and teaching in general. Among those graduates were the first Russian academicians Mikhail Lomonosov and Vasily Trediakovsky, poet Antioch Kantemir, architect Vasili Bazhenov, geographer Stepan Krasheninnikov, chemist Dmitry Vinogradov. When Platon II was elected Metropolitan of Moscow (1775), new disciplines were introduced into the academic curriculum, such as law, ecclesiastic history, medicine, broadened selection of ancient and new European languages. Publishing activities were also revived, including popular books on Orthodox Christianity for children. In 1775, the Slavic Greek Latin Academy became the official name of the academy. It worked together with the Troitskaya theological seminary of the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra. In 1814, the Slavic Greek Latin Academy was transformed into the Ecclesiastical Academy (Theological Academy) and relocated to the Troitse-Sergieva Lavra. =In the 19th century= In the 19th century the Academy continued as the principal theological school of the Russian Orthodox Church. Among its professors were the famous historian Vasily Klyuchevsky and the Christian philosopher Pavel Florensky. Since 1892 the Academy has been publishing the most authoritative journal on Russian Orthodoxy - Bogoslovsky vestnik (formerly edited by Gorsky- Platonov and Pavel Florensky). In 1888 the Academy trained more than 300 theological students. =Soviet period= The Bolsheviks closed the Academy in Troitse-Sergieva Lavra in 1918. Some professors of the Academy (including its former rector Archbishop Theodore (Pozdeevsky), professors I.V. Popov and Pavel Florensky) moved to the informal Higher Theological School in Moscow, but there were only a few students left. In September 1943, at the peak of the World War II, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin met three metropolitans (Sergius, Alexis and Nicholas) of the Russian Orthodox Church and established the new policy of cooperation with the Orthodox Church. He promised to formally recognize and reopen the Higher Theological School. The promised school was opened as the Theological Institute in the Novodevichy Convent on June 14, 1944. It was the first official theologian school allowed in the Soviet Union. The program was prepared by Gregory (Chukov), Archbishop of Saratov and its first rector was S.V. Savinsky. In 1946 the Theological Institute was transformed into the Moscow Seminary and Moscow Theological Academy. In 1947 the Academy gained the right to award theological degrees of Candidate, Doctor and Professor. In 1949 the Moscow Theological Academy was allowed to reclaim its original buildings at the Troitse-Sergieva Lavra, where they teach theological students to the present time. Most of the present bishops and theologians of Russian Orthodox Church have graduated from the Academy.

American Tribute to Agatha Christie The UK edition retailed at eighteen shillings (18/-) and the US edition at $4.50. It features her Belgian detective Hercule Poirot and the recurring character Ariadne Oliver. The novel is notable for being the first in many years in which Poirot is present from beginning to end. It is uncommon in that the investigation includes discovering the first crime, which happens comparatively late in the novel. Plot summary Norma Restarick seeks help from Poirot, believing she may have committed murder. When she sees him in person, she flees, saying he is too old. He pursues the case finding that Ariadne Oliver sent Norma to him. He believes there is a murder that prompted Norma's fears. Poirot and Mrs Oliver gather information, visiting her parents‚Äô home and her apartment building. Norma does not return home after a weekend visit to her father and stepmother. Mrs Oliver finds her in a caf√© by chance with her boyfriend David. Poirot meets Norma at the caf√©, where she mentions the death again. After describing the odd times where she cannot recall what has happened she leaves in fear again. Mrs Oliver trails David, ending up in the hospital after being coshed on the head upon leaving his art studio. Poirot arranges for Dr Stillingfleet to follow Norma; he pulls her to safety from a close call with speeding traffic and brings her to his place for treatment and for safety. Norma's father Andrew abandoned her and her mother Grace when Norma was about 5 years old. Andrew had run off with a woman in a relationship that ended soon after. He travelled in Africa in financially successful ventures. Norma lived with her mother until Grace's death two and a half years before. Andrew returned to England after his brother Simon died a year earlier, to work in the family firm, arriving with a new young wife. Norma can recognize nothing familiar in this man, but accepts him. Norma is the third girl in her flat in the fashion of young women advertising for a third girl to share the rent. The main tenant is secretary to her newfound father; the other girl, Frances, travels often for the art gallery that employs her. Mrs Oliver learns that a woman in the apartment building had recently died by falling from her window. A week passes before she tells Poirot, who feels this is what bothers Norma. The woman was Louise Charpentier. Norma says that her father ran off with Louise Birell. Later, Mrs Oliver finds a piece of paper linking Louise Charpentier to Andrew. Mary Restarick has been ill from poison in her food. Sir Roderick engages Poirot to find documents missing from his files which encounter brings young Sonia under suspicion. Norma is lured from Dr Stillingfleet by an ad in the newspaper to meet David, and is again drugged. Frances kills David. She sets it up to appear that Norma did it, but the blood on the knife was congealed when Norma found herself holding it. With police and family gathered in the flat, Poirot announces that Andrew did die in Africa. Robert Orwell is posing as her father to gain the wealth of the family. He had David paint portraits of him and his late wife in the style of a painter popular 20 years earlier as part of the ruse. Most cruelly, he and his wife have been giving Norma various drugs that give her hallucinations and an altered sense of time, to set her up as guilty. Further, the wife had poisoned herself hoping to pin that on Norma, too. Louise wrote to Andrew on learning he was back in England, so Frances killed Louise; this is the murder Norma feared she did. The woman posing as her stepmother was also Frances, who used a blonde wig to cover her dark hair when changing roles. Poirot takes the wig from her bag to make that point. Murder of the two who could expose the imposters was just one of her crimes. Sonia is exonerated when she finds the papers Sir Roderick misplaced, and the two will marry. Poirot had chosen Dr Stillingfleet to help him with Norma in hopes the two would marry, and they will.

Literary significance and reception Unusually for this period, The Guardian didn't carry a review of the novel. Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 13 November 1966 concluded, \\"There is the usual double-take surprise solution centring round a perhaps rather artificial identity problem; but the suspense holds up all the way.

She is never given drugs. * Frances Cary is Norma's half-sister, the child of Norma's former teacher, Miss Battersby, and Andrew Restarick. Miss Battersby learned of Robert Orwell's plot, and told her daughter Frances, who became Orwell's accomplice. Frances planned to get Norma hanged, so that Frances would inherit the Restarick fortune. * Louise Charpentier is replaced by Lavinia Seagram, Norma's former nanny. Frances murders her for the same reason Frances murders Louise in the novel: because she could expose Robert Orwell's impersonation of Andrew Restarick. Frances plants a knife in Norma's room before Nanny Seagram's body is discovered, and then removes the knife afterwards, and uses a similar knife for the murder. This makes Norma believe that she has committed the murder. * David Baker is not murdered; he serves as Norma's love interest in the absence of Dr Stillingfleet.

Using MOL, the therapist aims to help the patient shift his or her awareness to higher levels of perception in order to resolve conflicts and allow reorganization to take place. Background Psychotherapy has generally focused on pathology, although there have been exceptions such as Carl Rogers' emphasis on the actualizing tendency. PCT contributes a useful perspective on psychological disorders by providing a model of satisfactory psychological functioning as successful control. Dysfunction then is understood as disruption of successful control, and distress as the experience that results from a person's inability to control important experiences.; No attempt is made to treat the symptoms of distress as though they were in themselves the problem. The PCT perspective is that restoring the ability to control eliminates the source of distress. Internal conflict has the effect of denying control to both systems that are in conflict with each other. Conflict is usually transitory. When conflict becomes chronic, then symptoms of psychological disorder may appear. Method The core process is to redirect attention to the higher level control systems by recognizing \\"background thoughts\\", bringing them into the foreground, and then being alert for more background thoughts while the new foreground thoughts are explored. When the level-climbing process reaches an end state without encountering any conflicts, the need for therapy may have ended. When, however, this \\"up-a- level\\" process bogs down, a conflict has probably surfaced, and the exploration can be turned to finding the systems responsible for generating the conflict‚Äîand away from a preoccupation with the symptoms and efforts immediately associated with the conflict.

Today, their successor apparent Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe consider themselves as being Ojibwe, but many on their main reservation have the ma'iingan (wolf) as their chief doodem (clan), which is an indicator of Dakota origins. Mille Lacs Indians, because of their mixed Chippewa-Sioux heritage, have become the cultural lynch-pin linking the two former warring nations into a single people, providing Ojibwe culture and customs to the Dakota just as providing Dakota culture and customs to the Ojibwe. All of the drums held among the Mille Lacs Indians are of Dakota origins, singing Dakota melodies but translated into Ojibwe. Historical component bands=Mille Lacs Band of Mdewakanton Dakota= The first group forming the Mille Lacs Indians were the Mdew√°·∏≥a≈ãtu≈ãwa≈ã Oyate or the Mille Lacs Band of Mdewakanton Dakota. The Mdewakanton Dakota were the western sub-division of the Isanti Dakota, who formed the Eastern Dakota division. Of the Mdewakanton Dakota who originally lived along all along the shores of Mille Lacs Lake, Rum River and portages connecting them to other areas, with the Battle of Kathio, the majority of the Mdewakanton Dakota were forced south and west. However, despite resource access hardship due to conflicts between the Dakota and Ojibwe peoples, the Mille Lacs Band of Mdewakanton Dakota remained in the area. When the Dakota Council came to meet with the Ojibwe on terms of territorial control shifts, the Mille Lacs Band of Mdewakanton Dakota chose to remain and forgo their Dakota identity to become Ojibwe and remain at mde wa·∏≥a≈ã (Spiritual/Mystic Lake). As Ojibwe, Mille Lacs Band of Mdewakanton Dakota ensured the ceremonies associated with the Mille Lacs Lake were continued. Mille Lacs Band of Mdewakanton Dakota lived primarily on the three ricing chain of lakes (Ogechie, Shakopee and Onamia) at the head-waters of the Rum River and along the southern and southwestern shores of Mille Lacs Lake. =Mille Lacs Band of Border-sitter Chippewa= Second group forming the Mille Lacs Indians were the Mille Lacs Band of Border-sitter Chippewa, Band of the Border-sitter sub-nation of the Lake Superior Chippewa. The Mille Lacs Band of Border-sitter Chippewa were part of the western division of the Border-sitter Chippewa known as the Manoominikeshiinyag or the \\"Ricing Rails\\" or the \\"St. Croix Division\\". Mille Lacs Band of Border-sitter lived primarily along Groundhouse River, Ann River, Knife River (all located south of Mille Lacs Lake, and tributaries of the Snake River), the portage ways connecting these three rivers to Mille Lacs Lake and the Rum River, and along the southeastern shores of Mille Lacs Lake. This group already were a mixed Dakota-Ojibwe entity, identifying themselves equally as Dakota and as Ojibwe. =Mille Lacs Band of Mississippi Chippewa= Third group forming the Mille Lacs Indians were the Mille Lacs Band of Mississippi Chippewa, a band associated with the powerful Mississippi Chippewa. Mille Lacs Band of Mississippi Chippewa lived primarily along Nokasippi River, Cedar River and Ripple River (all located north and northwest of Mille Lacs Lake), the portage ways connecting these three rivers to Mille Lacs Lake, and along the northwestern and northern shores of Mille Lacs Lake. =Pre-treaty period (c. 1750‚Äì1825)= The unification process among the three component historical bands began in ernest after the Battle of Kathio in which the Mille Lacs Band of Mississippi Chippewa gained majority control of the Mille Lacs Lake. In the Battle of Kathio, majority of the Dakota peoples were removed from the Mille Lacs Lake area and generally forced southward and westward from Lake. However, due to the sacredness of mde w√°·∏≥a≈ã (Mille Lacs Lake), a peace council ending the territorial conflicts between the Ojibwe and Dakota was held on Mozomanie Point on the south end of the Lake, according to oral traditions, about 1750. At this peace council, the Ojibwe and the Dakota present were given a choice, where the Dakota peoples remaining would be peacefully incorporated as Ojibwe, but the Ojibwe would have to maintain all the rites associated with the Lake to maintain the sacredness of this body of water. In agreement, the Ojibwe learned all the Dakota ceremonial dances and songs over the course of the entire summer, while the remaining Dakota became \\"Ojibwe\\". As the distinct \\"Ojibwe\\" and \\"Dakota\\" identification no longer was appropriate, the unified entity became the Misi-zaaga'iganiwininiwag or the \\"Mille Lacs Indians\\". The traditional location for the joint council of the many sub-bands of the Mille Lacs Indians was maintained at Zaagawaamikaag- wiidwedong (or Zaagawaaming, for short), just as it was with Mdew√°·∏≥a≈ãtu≈ãwa≈ã Oyate before. Zaagawaaming, recorded as \\"Sagawamick\\" or \\"Sagawahmick\\" in various Bureau of Indian Affairs and Bureau of American Ethnology documents, still exists to this day but evolved into the Village of Lawrence and later as the City of Wahkon. However, with the establishment of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, the center of tribal government shifted to north and west to Vineland. =Treaty period (1825‚Äì1871)= The Mille Lacs Indians entered the treaty period by sending Chief Nayquonabe (from the Ojibwe Negwanebi, \\"'Tallest' [Quill]feather\\") to the 1825 Council for the First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (). Mille Lacs Indians participated in the 1826 Council for the Treaty of Fond du Lac. As part of the Biitan-akiing-enabijig Ojibwe, Mille Lacs Indians ceded great tract of land in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters (), but retained usufruct rights for hunting, fishing and gathering. As part of the Mdewakanton Dakota, Mille Lacs Indians ceded lands in the 1837 Treaty of Washington. Together with the Lake Superior Chippewa, the Mille Lacs Indians ceded lands in northern Wisconsin and western Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the 1842 Treaty of La Pointe, then in central Minnesota in the 1847 Treaty of Fond du Lac. Together with the Pillager Chippewas and other Mississippi Chippewas in the 1855 Treaty of Washington (), Mille Lacs Indians ceded large tract of land in northern Minnesota, excluding the Arrowhead Region (which its claim was rescinded in the 1854 Treaty of La Pointe) and the northwesternmost corner of Minnesota; in exchange, the Mille Lacs Indian reserved for themselves the south shore of Mille Lacs Lake, becoming the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation. However, as this land reserved was previously ceded to the United States in the 1837 Treaty of St. Peters, this caused a dispute between the lumbermen in the area and the Mille Lacs Indians. As the lumbermen had constructed a dam in Ericksonville, [and that location near the outlet of Lake Onamia was called Gibakwa'iganiing (By the Dam) or Gibakwa'igaansing (By the Little Dam) by the Ojibwe] to regulate the water flow of the Rum River for floating logs down the river, but the damming of the water threatened the wild rice in Lake Onamia, the Mille Lacs Indians removed the dam. This became the first court case for the Mille Lacs Indians, in 1856, the US Supreme Court judged in favor of the tribe. Chief Hole in the Day With the Dakota War of 1862, many Chippewa Bands aided the Dakota people. When Mille Lacs Indians Chief M√°za-mani (Iron-Walker) learned of the plans of Gull Lake Band Chief Bagonegiizhig (Hole in the Day) to attack Fort Ripley, Chief M√°za-mani raised a party of 200 men and they set out to aid the fort in advance, thus averting Chief Bagonegiizhigs attack on the fort. In the 1863 Treaty of Washington () and again in 1864 (), while most all other Chippewa Bands were being forced to relocate due to their aid to the Dakota people, Mille Lacs Indians, due to their aid to the United States, were not. As stated in the Treaties, \\"That owing to the heretofore good conduct of the Mille Lac Indians, they shall not be compelled to remove so long as they shall not in any way interfere with or in any manner molest the property of persons of the whites.\\" =Post-treaty period (1872‚Äì1936)= When the White Earth Indian Reservation was established, like the rest of the Mississippi Chippewa, the Mille Lacs Indians were also encouraged to relocate. Many Mille Lacs Indians became homeless so under , homesteading and cemetery lands were secured for the Mille Lacs Indians. After the signing of the \\"An act for the relief and civilization of the Chippewa Indians in the State of Minnesota\\" (51st-1st-Ex.Doc.247) and a removal bill on May 27, 1902, many Mille Lacs Indians did remove themselves to the White Earth Inidan Reserveration, becoming the Removable Mille Lacs Band. Others remained on the Mille Lacs Indian Reservation, becoming the Non-removable Mille Lacs Band. Within few years, many of the Removable Mille Lacs Band left White Earth and returned to Mille Lacs, splitting the group onto two separate Indian Reservations. When the BIA asked for a consultation council to be held in Hayward, Wisconsin, regards to the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act, Mille Lacs Indians sent delegates there without signature authority to gather information. When the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe was established in 1936 under the authority of the Indian Reorganization Act, the Non-removable and Removable Mille Lacs Bands of the Mille Lacs Indians became the core Band of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe, joined together with the Non-removable Sandy Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, Rice Lake Band of Mississippi Chippewa, and the communities of the St. Croix Chippewa Indians of Minnesota.

Arts patron, socialite Wendy Reves dies: Gifts included large donation to Dallas Museum of Art, The Dallas Morning News, March 13, 2007) was an American philanthropist, socialite, and former fashion model. Early life and career She was born Wyn-Nelle Russell in Marshall, Texas, and adopted the name Wendy as an adult. Her modeling career began in 1939, and she appeared in Harper's Bazaar and Vogue. Virginia Pope, the fashion critic of The New York Times, described her as \\"one of New York's most-seen manikins [sic].\\"\\"Little Shop Show Marked By Color\\", The New York Faces, September 26, 1946, page 28. Marriages=Al Schroeder= Wendy's first husband, Al Schroeder, was a West Point graduate she met when he was stationed in Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas. Wendy was barely sixteen when they discussed marriage, but was persuaded by her mother to wait until her seventeenth birthday to marry. One year later they had a son, Arnold Leon Schroeder.The Wendy and Emery Reves Collection at the Dallas Museum of Art =Paul Baron= In 1940, she married Paul Baron (b. 1911), a pianist and conductor who was the leader of the Paul Baron Orchestra, a well-known studio band of the 1930s and 1940s. He was a vocal arranger for Fifi D'Orsay, Nanette Fabray, Jane Froman, Elvira Rios, Mildred Bailey, and Lupe V√©lez and was co-writer of the popular song Rum and Coca-Cola, which was a hit song in 1945 for the Andrews Sisters. Wendy Russell dated Cary Grant, Howard Hughes, and Errol Flynn, and was seen often at the Stork Club and El Morocco.Nancy Smith, \\"Churchill on the Riviera: Winston Churchill, Wendy Reves, and the Villa La Pausa built by Coco Chanel\\", Biblio Press, 2017 =Emery Reves= From 1948, she was the mistress of Emery Reves (n√© R√©v√©sz Imre, 1904‚Äì1981), a Hungarian-born writer, publisher, financier, art collector, founder of the anti-fascist Cooperation Press Service, and advocate of world federalism. The couple married in 1964 in Thonex, Switzerland. A first cousin of the conductor Sir Georg Solti and a literary agent for and close friend of Winston Churchill, Emery Reves described his wife as \\"a woman with a brilliant mind and imagination, tempered by much common sense. She is a woman who never bored me\\". In 1953, the couple bought La Pausa, a villa in Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, France, which had been built for Coco Chanel by the Duke of Westminster. Winston Churchill, by then semi- retired from politics, spent much of the years from 1956 to 1959 as a guest at La Pausa. He was rarely accompanied by his wife Clementine Churchill, who did not care greatly for Emery and is said to have strongly disliked Wendy. This dislike led to a cooling in the friendship between her husband and Reves, of which there is eloquent testimony in an anguished letter from Reves to Churchill early in 1960, refusing to have him at La Pausa again. Reves shows a deep concern for Wendy's mental health in this letter, referring to her emotional fragility and battle with depression, for which he seemed to hold the Churchills at least partly responsible.Roy Jenkins Churchill Macmillan 2001 p.907 Philanthropy Grave of Emery and Wendy Reves on the campus of the College of William and Mary Following her husband's 1981 death, Reves devoted herself to charitable endeavors. Among her philanthropies was the establishment of the Wendy and Emery Reves wing of the Dallas Museum of Art in 1985 (a recreation of six rooms of the Reves' villa), which displays the Reveses' extensive art collection as it was originally displayed at their villa, and the Wendy and Emery Reves Center for International Studies at the College of William & Mary (established with a $3 million grant); the adjacent residence hall is also named for the couple. She also donated $25,000 to begin the Wonderland of Lights, which has become one of the largest light festivals in the United States. She was instrumental in convincing Janine Michelson, the widow of Leo Michelson, to found the Michelson Museum of Art in Marshall, Texas, to house the Michelsons' art collection. Other philanthropic gifts included a $2 million endowment to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation and UT Southwestern Medical Center, establishing an international breast cancer symposium and a diagnostic and treatment center. An additional $2 million went to the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas, which features an entry arch named for Emery Reves.

It was the standard issue anti-personnel grenade used during World War II, and also saw limited service in later conflicts, including the Korean War and Vietnam War. Replacing the failed Mk 1 grenade of 1917, it was standardized in 1920 as the Mk II, and redesignated the Mk 2 on April 2, 1945. The Mk 2 was gradually phased out of service as the M26-series (M26/M61/M57) grenade was introduced during the Korean War. Due to the tremendous quantity manufactured during World War II the Mk 2 was still in limited issue with the US Army and US Marine Corps throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The U.S. Navy was one of the last users of the Mk 2 when it was finally withdrawn from U.S. military service in 1969, replaced with the M33 series (M33/M67). Description The Mk 2 grenade replaced the failed Mk 1 grenade used by the U.S. military during World War I. 44 million were ordered and more than 21 million were completed (it was possible to convert Mk 1 grenade bodies to the Mk 2 configuration) before the war ended, but few reached American troops overseas. It was formally standardized in 1920. The Mk 2, like the Mk 1, was manufactured of cast iron with a grooved surface divided into 40 knobs in 5 rows of 8 columns. This was intended to enhance fragmentation (in practice, it was found that the grooves did not enhance fragmentation as much as desired) and provide a better grip when handling and throwing the grenade. The grooves and knobs gave it the appearance of a pineapple, and are the origin of the nickname. It was also commonly referred to as a \\"frag\\" grenade, in contrast to other types of grenades such as the Mk 3 grenade concussion grenade. Fuses The Mk 2 used the M5, M6, M10, M11, or M204 series fuses. The early M5, and the later M6 and M204 series detonating fuses, were used on high explosive-filled grenades. The M10 and M11 series igniting fuses were used on low explosive-filled ones. The early fuses had many problems. In the M5, moisture could get in under the foil fuse cap, causing the weapon to fail to detonate. The early fuses were not completely silent and made a loud \\"bang\\" and produced sparks when activated. They also made a faint \\"hissing\\" sound while burning, potentially alerting the enemy of their presence. The M10, used during the interwar period, and the M10A1, used early in WWII, sometimes prematurely detonated when the flash from the primer hit the explosive charge rather than the delay fuse. They were replaced by the M10A2 and M10A3. A less common type of igniting fuse was the M11. The M6A4C had a delay of 4 seconds. The M5 and M11, like the M10, M10A1 and M10A2, had a delay of 4 to 5 seconds. The later M10A3 had a delay of 4.5 to 5.3 seconds. In 1944, the M6A4C was replaced by the silent and more reliable 4 to 5 second delay M204 or M204A1 fuse. Due to the large number of grenades already issued, few grenades with the new fuses were used in combat during WWII. Fillings The original Mk 2 grenade had a threaded plug in its base, which covered the opening used to place the explosive filling, either of TNT, of Trojan explosive (a mixture of 40% nitrostarch, ammonium nitrate, and sodium nitrate), of a 50/50 amatol/nitrostarch mixture, or of Grenite (a mixture of 95% nitrostarch and binders). Some early Mk 2 grenades were filled with of smokeless EC powder. The improved \\"Mk 2A1\\" (a designation used informally by armorers, historians, and collectors, but never by the US military) introduced in 1942 was filled through the fuse well instead. The Mk 2A1 was initially filled with of EC powder. In 1944, the EC powder filling was replaced with of TNT. Low explosive-filled Mk 2s had their cast iron bodies painted gray or black to prevent rust. Pre-WWII high explosive-filled Mk 2s were painted bright yellow. During wartime (from about 1943 onwards), grenades were overpainted in olive drab, leaving a narrow yellow ring remaining at the top. Not all were overpainted, however, as D-Day film footage shows. Mk 2 practice grenades were painted red (a practice copied from the French military). M21 practice grenades were painted light blue (a practice copied from the British military) and had blue-painted fuse levers, often with the end painted light brown indicating a \\"low explosive\\" marking charge. Variants Mk 2 grenades came 25 to a wooden crate and were shipped in small fiberboard packing tubes. High explosive-filled Mk 2s were shipped unfused to prevent accidental detonation. Their fuses were shipped separately and came in flat cardboard boxes of 25. EC powder-filled grenades were shipped with their fuses attached. Variants included: * Grenade, hand, fragmentation, Mk 2: EC powder filler, uses M10 series igniting fuse * Grenade, hand, fragmentation, high explosive, Mk 2: TNT, Trojan grenade powder, 50/50 amatol/nitrostarch, or Grenite filler, uses M5 series detonating fuse. In 1930, \\"high explosive\\" was dropped from the designation. * Grenade, hand, fragmentation, Mk 2A1: EC powder or TNT filler, uses M10/M11 series igniting fuse (EC powder) or M6 or M204 series detonating fuse (flaked TNT).

Has a standard body with a wooden or cork baseplug that pops out during detonation, creating a loud report and smoke to indicate ignition. The body could be reused and reloaded as long as it remained intact. * Grenade, hand, practice, M21: Black powder \\"spotting\\" charge, uses M10 series igniting fuse. Has a heavier body and no baseplug. Its body was embossed with the vertical letters R, D and X on the knobs in a column on one side (because it was originally designed to be for an HE grenade with a more powerful RDX filler). When detonated, it makes a loud report and smoke comes out of the fuse vents.

The festival typically screens at seven venues located within downtown Birmingham, featuring the restored Alabama Theatre, a 2,200 seat movie palace built by Paramount in 1927, and multiple screening rooms in the Alabama School of Fine Arts.bwcitypaper.com In 2006, the Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival recognized writer/director John Sayles and producer Maggie Renzi for their more than two decades of collaboration in independent film, which includes such acclaimed indie classics as The Brother From Another Planet, Passion Fish, Lone Star, and the Sidewalk 2004 Opening Night Film, Silver City. In 2005, Sidewalk honored actor John C. Reilly with the inaugural Spirit of Sidewalk award.  History  Alan Hunter at a 2015 Sidewalk Film Festival party held at Sloss Furnaces. From left to right: Erik Jambor, Kelli McCall Franklin, Alan Hunter, Wayne Franklin. Sidewalk incorporated in 1999 as Alabama Moving Image Association with founders Kelli McCall Franklin, Wayne Franklin, and Erik Jambor; the festival debuted as Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival in the Theatre District of Birmingham, Alabama. Taking place during the first weekend in May, the first festival venues included the Alabama Theatre, a repurposed bank building, an outdoor screen, and outdoor tents; about 4,000 people attended the weekend. Sidewalk has had three executive directors since 1999. Erik Jambor, a co-founder of the festival, served as executive director from 1999 to 2006; during the 2007 festival season, Catherine Pfitzer was promoted from operations manager to executive director. Chloe Cook was hired as executive director in 2009. Over time, Sidewalk has accumulated many programs that run throughout the year. Their education and outreach efforts include a youth board, which creates a short film and judges other teen-made movies submitted to the festival; a Screentalks program, which involves the screening of an independent film and a panel discussion; and the monthly Salon, where local filmmakers give panel discussions or lectures on their craft. In 2006, SHOUT LGBTQ Film Festival was founded by Jeremy Erdreich, David R. Garrett, Catherine Pfitzer, and Larry Slater. In 2010, Sidewalk officially changed its name to Sidewalk Film Festival, and Sidewalk and SHOUT merged festival weekends. Sidewalk first garnered critical praise outside of Alabama when TIME Magazine listed the festival in its article \\"Top 10 Film Festivals for the Rest of Us.\\" In 2017, Sidewalk Film Festival Executive Director Chloe Cook announced plans to open a permanent independent cinema in Birmingham, in the basement of the restored Pizitz Building. In August 2019, Sidewalk opened the Sidewalk Film Center + Cinema in the Pizitz Building. The cinema includes two 90-seat theaters and a classroom. Awards Films are given awards both by jury and audience choice. Over the years, some categories have been added or eliminated and sponsors have varied.

It was one of her favourites of her own works and received some of the warmest critical notices of her career upon publication. Etymology The title comes from William Blake's Auguries of Innocence: : Every night and every morn, : Some to misery are born, : Every morn and every night, : Some are born to sweet delight. : Some are born to sweet delight, : Some are born to endless night. Plot summary The story begins with Michael telling us about his time as a chauffeur and how he met the architect Rudolph Santonix. He plans to one day have a house built by Santonix. Michael is walking along a village road near the Gipsy's Acre property one day when he meets Ellie, a wealthy heiress who wants to escape from her world of snobby friends, begging relatives, and restrictive financial advisors. As it turns out Ellie had purchased Gipsy's Acre before they met, they decide to marry and build a house at Gipsy's Acre acre with Santonix. The newlywed couple decide to go around the village meeting its residents but are threatened by an old gypsy woman, Mrs Lee, who warns them and instructs them to leave because of a curse. Ellie sustains an injury and invites her companion, Greta Andersen, over to stay with them. Ellie begins to worry about Mike and Greta, as they get into heated arguments. While at lunch with Major Philpot, Mike begins to worry about the fact that Ellie has not yet joined them after going out horse riding. The next day, they find Ellie dead and having sustained no apparent injuries, the local police determine that Ellie died of shock, likely induced when she encountered Mrs Lee. Ellie also had a heart condition. Michael travels to America to attend Ellie‚Äôs funeral with her family and collect the inheritance. While there he hears that Mrs Lee has been found dead in a quarry, and Claudia Hardcastle (one of Ellie‚Äôs friends from the village) has also died whilst out riding. After Ellie's funeral, Mike goes to visit Santonix on his deathbed. Right before Santonix dies, he screams, ‚ÄúYou should have gone the other way!‚Äù Feeling disturbed by this, Mike returns to the UK on a sea voyage to give him time to reflect. When he returns to the village Mike reveals how he and Greta had met much earlier when in Germany, they had fallen in love and devised a plan to take Ellie‚Äôs money. They killed her with cyanide put inside her allergy pills that took a while to dissolve, and paid Mrs Lee to frighten Ellie and raise suspicion of the shock theory. To eliminate her as a witness, they pushed Mrs Lee into a quarry. Claudia Hardcastle was unintentionally poisoned after finding and taking some of Ellie's pills. It is assumed that Santonix had guessed Michael‚Äôs intents and was trying to warn him of the rage fits he (Mike) had. He and Greta celebrate what they have done, but Michael starts to lapse and sees Ellie everywhere he looks. When they realise Ellie's relatives may have suspicions about them, Mike has another fit and strangles Greta. Shortly afterwards, the police and the local doctor arrive; their suspicions were aroused by Claudia Hardcastle's death. Mike reminisces about all of the bad things he has done, such as drowning his childhood friend to steal his watch. He asks for a pen and paper to write down his story, and the novel ends. Characters The following details of the characters are based on the original novel. Backstories, backgrounds, and names vary with differing international adaptations, based on censorship, cultural norms, etc. *Fenella Rogers (n√©e Guteman): Often called Ellie, she is a sweet heiress with a head for business. *Michael Rogers: A 'rolling stone', who shifts from job to job. Michael hides dark secrets behind his nonchalant facade. *Greta Andersen: Ellie's Scandinavian, blonde companion with a penchant for arranging and micromanagement. *Claudia Hardcastle: A young woman in the village who shares Ellie's passion for horse-riding. *Cora Van Stuyvesant: Ellie's stepmother, several times divorced, and a thoroughly unpleasant woman of roughly forty years of age who married Ellie's father for money. *Andrew Lippincott: Ellie's guardian and trustee, a Bostonian with hardly a trace of an accent, who resents Greta's 'influence' over Ellie. *Esther Lee: The village gypsy, who enjoys frightening people, especially when money is involved. *Stanford Lloyd: Claudia Hardcastle's former husband and one of Ellie's trustees. * Frank Barton: The husband of Ellie's aunt, a man who borrows but doesn't return. *Rudolf Santonix: A perfectionist architect who 'looks through you' and 'sees right through the other side'. A personal friend of Michael's from the latter's time as a cab driver. *Major Phillpot: The village 'god' who becomes a good friend of Michael. *Mrs. Rogers: as his mother, one of the few people who know Michael well. She worked hard to get her son a proper education since her husband was a poor role model and an alcoholic. Literary significance and reception The novel was published in 1967. Christie later said she normally wrote her books in three to four months but wrote Endless Night in six weeks.Crime Story Queen By Muriel Bowen. The Washington Post, Times Herald 15 Sep 1970: B4. The novel ‚Äì which recycles plots and characters Christie had used in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and Death on the Nile ‚Äì is dedicated \\"To Nora Prichard from whom I first heard the legend of Gipsy's Acre.\\" Nora Prichard was the paternal grandmother of Mathew, Christie's only grandson. Gipsy's Acre was a field located on a Welsh moorland. The Times Literary Supplement of 16 November 1967 said, \\"It really is bold of Agatha Christie to write in the persona of a working-class boy who marries a poor little rich girl, but in a pleasantly gothic story of gypsy warnings she brings it all off, together with a nicely melodramatic final twist.\\"The Times Literary Supplement 16 November 1967 (p. 1092) The Guardian carried a laudatory review in its issue of 10 November 1967 by Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) who said, \\"The old maestrina of the crime-novel (or whatever is the female of 'maestro') pulls yet another out of her inexhaustible bag with Endless Night, quite different in tone from her usual work. It is impossible to say much about the story without giving away vital secrets: sufficient to warn the reader that if he should think this is a romance he couldn't be more mistaken, and the crashing, not to say horrific suspense at the end is perhaps the most devastating that this surpriseful author has ever brought off.\\"The Guardian. 10 November 1967 (p. 7). Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 5 November 1967 began, \\"She changes her style again and makes a determined and quite suspenseful attempt to be with it.\\" He finished, \\"I shan't give away who murders whom, but the suspense is kept up all the way and Miss Christie's new demi-tough, streamlined style really does come off. She'll be wearing black leather pants next, if she isn't already.\\"The Observer 5 November 1967 (p. 27) The poet and novelist Stevie Smith chose the novel as one of her Books of the Year in the same newspaper's issue of 10 December 1967 when she said, \\"I mostly read Agatha Christie this year (and every year). I wish I could write more about what she does for one in the way of lifting the weight, and so on.\\"The Observer, 10 December 1967 (p. 9) Robert Barnard: \\"The best of the late Christies, the plot a combination of patterns used in Ackroyd and Nile (note similarities in treatment of heiress/heroine's American lawyers in Nile and here, suggesting she had been rereading). The murder occurs very late, and thus the central section seems desultory, even novelettish (poor little rich girl, gypsy's curse, etc.). But all is justified by the conclusion. A splendid late flowering.\\"Barnard, Robert. A Talent to Deceive ‚Äì an appreciation of Agatha Christie ‚Äì Revised edition (p. 193). Fontana Books, 1990; Adaptations=\\"The Case of the Caretaker\\"= A short story collection by Agatha Christie, titled Miss Marple's Final Cases and Two Other Stories, published in October 1979, features a short story called \\"The Case of the Caretaker\\" whose overall plot is the same as Endless Night, although the character names are different. \\"‚ÄòThe Case of the Caretaker‚Äô was first published in Strand Magazine, January 1942, and then in the USA in Chicago Sunday Tribune, 5 July 1942.\\" from \\"Miss Marple ‚Äì Miss Marple and Mystery: The Complete Short Stories (Miss Marple)\\" by Agatha Christie =Endless Night (1972 Film)= In 1972, Sidney Gilliat directed a film adaption starring Hayley Mills, Britt Ekland, Per Oscarsson, Hywel Bennett and George Sanders (who committed suicide before the film's release). The film received mixed reviews, and following an unsuccessful run in the United Kingdom, was not released theatrically in the United States. Christie was initially pleased by Gilliat's involvement and the casting. However, she was disappointed in the finished product, calling it \\"lacklustre.\\" She also voiced her reservations about the film featuring a brief nude scene with Ekland at the end.Dame Agatha Tells Whodunit‚ÄîShe Did: Grande Dame of Whodunit Los Angeles Times 15 Dec 1974: l1.Haining, Peter, Agatha Christie: Murder in Four Acts.

It aired first on Argentina's Film&Arts; on Wednesday 20 November, Australia's ABC on Sunday 22 December 2013, and aired on ITV on Sunday 29 December 2013. This adaptation by Kevin Elyot remains fairly faithful to the book, although, in addition to adding Miss Marple, it identifies the boyhood friend murdered for his wristwatch by Rogers with the architect's brother, who does not appear in the original novel. The architect (named Robbie Hayman in this TV adaption) ends up burning down the house he has designed for Rogers after discovering his brother's watch in Rogers' desk drawer.

Lindley is known for writing entertaining scientific texts that show not only great knowledge of physics, but also a wit and understanding of what the layman can grasp. Most of his books explain the scientific theories through the use of a scientist's biography or an historical account of disagreement amongst scientists. In The End of Physics, Lindley challenged the assumption that string theorists might achieve a unified theory. He contended that particle physics was in danger of becoming a branch of aesthetics, since these theories could be validated only by subjective criteria, such as elegance and beauty, rather than through experimentation.John Horgan, The End of Science (1996) p. 70  Selected books  * *Where Does the Weirdness Go: Why Quantum Mechanics is Strange, But not as Strange as You Think, Basic Books (1996), ;  *  References External links * American Scientist Interview Category:British physicists Category:British science writers Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Academic journal editors Category:Theoretical physicists ","title":"David Lindley (physicist)"},{"id":"2300173","text":"Ambergate is a village in Derbyshire, England, situated where the River Amber joins the River Derwent, and where the A610 road from Ripley and Nottingham joins the A6 that runs along the Derwent valley between Derby to the south and Matlock to the north. Sawmills and Ridgeway are neighbouring hamlets, and Alderwasley, Heage, Nether Heage and Crich are other significant neighbouring settlements. The village forms part of the Heage and Ambergate ward of Ripley Town Council with a population of 5,013 at the 2011 Census. Ambergate is within the Derwent Valley Mills UNESCO World Heritage site, and has historical connections with George Stephenson; Ambergate is notable for its railway heritage and telephone exchange. Ambergate has an active community life, particularly centred on the school, pubs, churches, sports clubs; and annual village carnival which is relatively large and consistent locally, with popular associated events in carnival week and throughout the year. The carnival is organised by a voluntary committee. Shining Cliff woods, Thacker's woods and Crich Chase border the village. It is about south of Matlock at the junction of the A6 trunk road and the A610 to Ripley. A mile east of Ambergate is Heage with its recently restored 18th-century windmill. Until the early nineteenth century it was known as Toadmoor, from the Derbyshire dialect \\"t'owd moor\\"Farmer. A, (2015) Derwent Valley Mills Through Time, Stroud: Amberley Publishing (the old moor) with no more than a few artisans' cottages. The southerly half of the present village is still shown as such on the Ordnance Survey's maps. The name Amber Gate was originally applied to the tollgate for the Nottingham turnpike, but adopted by the North Midland Railway for Ambergate railway station which is located on the Derby-Matlock Derwent Valley Line. The turnpike to Matlock was opened in 1818. Until then the main road from Belper northwards had been through Wirksworth and such traffic as there was, would have been mainly cotton from Arkwright's Mill at Cromford. However, the Cromford Canal, opened in 1794, also passes the village. In 1818 the turnpike to Nottingham was opened with a toll house at the junction. The canal towpath can be followed from here to Cromford Wharf, passing High Peak Junction, which is the start of the High Peak Trail). This section is listed as a Biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), and also forms part of the Derwent Valley Heritage Way. In 1840 the North Midland Railway opened with a station at 'Amber Gate' which brought trade for 'omnibus and posting conveyance' to Matlock, which was becoming a fashionable spa town. By 1867 there was a through line from London St.Pancras to Manchester, as well as to Leeds. Ambergate became an important interchange and, in 1876, Francis Hurt built the 'Hurt Arms' to replace the former 'Thatched House Tavern and Posting House' which the Midland Railway had converted into three cottages (now Midland Place). The main railway line runs through the elliptical Toadmoor Tunnel designed by George Stephenson. In 1791 Benjamin Outram and Samuel Beresford had built kilns at nearby Bullbridge to process limestone from their quarry at Crich. George Stephenson had discovered deposits of coal at Clay Cross and realised that burning lime would provide a use for the slack which otherwise would go to waste. He leased Cliff Quarry at Crich, and built eight limekilns beside the railway. Within a year they had grown to twenty. They were connected by another wagonway known as \\"The Steep\\", a self-acting incline at a slope of 1 in 5. By 1851 the tiny hamlet had grown to a population of 206. In 1876 Richard Johnson and Nephew opened the wireworks by the river. In 1931 the population had reached 901, rising to 1,794 in 1951. The quarry and the wagonway closed in 1957 but the limeworks carried on until 1965 and the passage of the Clean Air Act. The kilns were demolished the following year to build a storage facility and processing plant for natural gas. In 1966 the first fully operational electronic telephone exchange in Europe opened in Ambergate. This was also the first small to medium electronic exchange in the world and the first of many TXE2 type exchanges. Public houses The Hurt Arms in 1880 Ambergate has two pubs: The Hurt Arms on the A6 and The Excavator on the A610 at Bucklands Hollow.

The beach is over long. In 1875, a rail link was constructed to the beach, leading to its increasing popularity as a summer recreation area, and in 1896, it became the first public beach in the United States. It is still easily accessible by the MBTA Blue Line from Boston, and can accommodate as many as one million visitors in a weekend during its annual sand sculpture competition. History =Colonial to Early Development = Watching the Bathers in 1910 In the 1620's, the area was first traversed by Europeans settlers. Within the decade, the area thrived as a farming community and after being annexed to Chelsea, Massachusetts from Boston, Massachusetts, the area became known as Chelsea Beach. In 1875, the Boston, Revere Beach & Lynn Railroad, known as the \\"Narrow Gauge\\", came to Chelsea Beach, making it easily accessible to visitors from Boston and elsewhere. Various beach-related and recreational buildings sprang up along the beach itself, which was constrained by the nearness of the railroad to the high tide mark. Several years later in 1881, locals voted to change the name of the beach to Crescent Beach. In 1896, the Metropolitan Park Commission (now part of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation) assumed control over the beach. Following the design of landscape architect Charles Eliot, the railroad tracks were moved from the beach itself to the alignment now used by the MBTA Blue Line, and more than 100 structures were removed from the beach. On July 12, 1896, Revere Beach was opened as the first public beach in the nation. An estimated 45,000 people showed up on opening day.. Only a few weeks later, tens of thousands more fled to the beach to escape the heat wave of 1896. Ocean Pier in c. 1910 In the following decades, Revere Beach developed many attractions, including restaurants, dance halls and ballrooms, roller skating rinks, bowling alleys, and roller coasters. Three roller coasters were particularly well-known: the Cyclone, a wooden roller coaster that was the tallest roller coaster ever built at the time of its construction in 1925; the Lightning, another wooden roller coaster; and the Derby Racer, a racing roller coaster. All have since been torn down. Revere Beach riot of 1920 On the night of August 8, 1920, a riot broke out in Revere Beach when a police officer arrested a United States Navy sailor on the charge of drunkenness. Sailors who were on leave for the weekends saw what happened and attempted to wrestle control of their comrade from a police officer, and the riot ensued. United States Marines and a few United States Army soldiers joined the sailors and surrounded the police station in attempt to free their drunken comrade. Numbering to about 400, mobs of servicemen pelted the station with rocks and fired stolen shooting-gallery weapons at it. Request for assistance was summoned to Federal troops from Fort Banks and the Boston Navy Yard, and the Chelsea Police Department.Revere Beach Riot, 1920 A detachment of 200 Army soldiers from Fort Banks arrived with fixed bayonets and assisted police in clearing the beach. The Navy gave orders to its master-at-arms personnel that every sailor in Revere was to be arrested. More than 100 had been placed under arrest and by August 9, military and police authorities finally kept the disorder under control. Many injuries inflicted upon policemen and civilians as well as a mob of five sailors were minor, mostly from flying stones when the mob hurled objects at the police station. The windows were smashed and much of the furniture in the station was broken. =Decline and renewal= The popularity of Revere Beach began to decline in the 1950s as the facilities at the beach deteriorated. In February 1978, a large blizzard destroyed many of the remaining structures, the sidewalks, and the sea wall. After a significant revitalization effort by city of Revere and the state of Massachusetts, the beach reopened in May 1992. On the weekend of July 19, 1996, Revere commemorated the centennial of the first opening of Revere Beach with a three- day celebration, and on May 27, 2003, Revere Beach was designated a National Historic Landmark. In 2007, Revere Beach Boulevard was redesigned with new landscaping and sidewalks, and improved parking. Revere Beach Sand Sculpting Festival 2010  New England Sand Sculpting Festival  The New England Sand Sculpting Festival has taken place at Revere Beach each July since 2004. During the festival, an area of the beach is fenced off, creating a temporary art gallery for visitors. Event organizers have proclaimed that the festival is the largest sand-sculpting contest in New England. A total of $15,000 in prize money was available for the 2010 event. The annual contest draws approximately one million visitors each year.  Water quality  Starting with the passage of the BEACH Act in 2000, a concentrated effort has been made to improve the water quality of Revere Beach and other beaches in Massachusetts. This includes a public website with water quality results and notifications of beach closures due to waterborne pathogens. Revere Beach undergoes routine testing for Enterococcus, a pathogen indicating bacteria responsible for illnesses as slight as sore throat to meningitis, gastroenteritis, and encephalitis. The water is tested on a weekly basis at four different sites throughout the summer, from June to August. These sites are Oak Island, Revere Beach Bathhouse (state police station), Beach Street, and Point of Pines. This data is collected by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority.  Wildlife  Piping plovers, an endangered species of bird, are known to build their nests along Revere Beach in the Spring. During the birds' nesting season, string and fence enclosures are constructed to protect the birds and their eggs, the latter of which are so small as to blend in with the sand.

She was sunk off the coast of Diu, Gujarat, India by the Pakistan Navy submarine on 9 December 1971 during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. This was the first warship sunk in action by a submarine since the Korean War. It remains the post-Independence Indian navy's only warship to be lost in war to date. Sinking After the beginning of hostilities on 3 December 1971, Indian Naval radio detection equipment identified a submarine lurking about south-west of Diu harbour. The 14th Frigate Squadron of the Western Fleet was dispatched to destroy the submarine. It normally consisted five ships Khukri, , Kalveti, Krishna and Kuthar, but at the time of the incident Kuthars boiler room was being repaired in Bombay. One reason that may have prompted the decision to deploy two obsolete Blackwood-class frigates against a modern Daphne-class submarine was that the Indian Navy lacked sufficient numbers of anti-submarine aircraft.Indian-Subcontinent Database In the early hours of 9 December, Hangor picked up two sonar contacts in the area. The sonar and radar transmissions identified them as warships but Hangor failed to intercept them and lost contact when the range increased. The submarine sighted the squadron on the evening of 9 December. Khukri was still not aware of the submarine's presence and continued slowly on a steady course because she was testing an improved version of the 170/174 sonar, which required a low speed to increase detection, despite the fact that moving on low speed was against Indian anti- submarine doctrine. At 19:57 Hangor fired a homing torpedo on a sonar approach at Kirpan. The torpedo failed to explode and was detected by Kirpan which turned away and fired anti-submarine mortars. Khukri increased its speed and turned towards the submarine, which then fired a second torpedo directed at Khukri. The torpedo struck Khukri and exploded under its oil tanks. According to the Pakistani submarine captain, Commander Ahmed Tasnim, the ship sank within two minutes.Interview with Vice Admiral Tasneem, December 2008 Other sources claim that Khukri was struck by three torpedoes before going down.Friedman, Norman (1984). Submarine design and development. Conway Maritime, p. 188 After a few minutes, Kirpan turned back to attack Hangor with depth charges, as her anti-submarine mortars had broken down. Hangor then fired another torpedo at Kirpan before turning away. Hangor patrolled the region for the next four days before returning safely to her berth. Casualties To date, Khukri is the only ship lost in combat in the history of the Indian Navy. 18 officers and 176 sailors were lost in the sinking. The captain, Mahendra Nath Mulla, was among the casualties. He has remained so far the only Indian captain to go down with a vessel. He was posthumously awarded India's second-highest military honour, the Maha Vir Chakra. There is a memorial to the dead sailors in Diu. The memorial consists of a scale model of Khukri encased in a glass house, placed atop a hillock facing the sea. The memorial was inaugurated by Vice Admiral Madhvendra Singh as the flag officer commanding-in-chief.Two-day ceremony at Navy‚Äôs Diu memorial Model of Khukri at the INS Khukri memorial, Diu INS Khukri memorial, Diu Controversy Responsibility for errors by Indian naval officers related to the sinking has caused some controversy. The naval officer who led the inquiry into the sinking, Benoy Bhushan, has claimed that India's official naval history invented fictional accounts to cover up bungling and a surviving sailor from the frigate, Chanchal Singh Gill, has called for an investigation and withdrawal of gallantry awards to negligent officers in the squadron.

It is spoken in parts of southern Ethiopia by the Sidama people, particularly in the densely populated Sidama Zone. Sidaamu Afoo is the ethnic autonym for the language, while Sidaminya is its name in Amharic. Although it is not known to have any specific dialects, it shares over 64% lexical similarity with Alaba-K'abeena, 62% with Kambaata, and 53% with Hadiyya, all of which are other languages spoken in southwestern Ethiopia. The word order is typically SOV. Sidaama has over 100,000 L2 speakers. The literacy rate for L1 speakers is 1%-5%, while for L2 speakers it is 20%. In terms of its writing, Sidaama used an Ethiopic script up until 1993, from which point forward it has used a Latin script.Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed. 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World. 15th edition. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics. The term Sidamo has also been used by some authors to refer to larger groupings of East Cushitic and even Omotic languages.Ring, Trudy, Noelle Watson, and Paul Schellinger. \\"International Dictionary of Historic Places: Middle East and Africa, Volume 4.\\" 1994. The languages within this Sidamo grouping contain similar, alternating phonological features.Leslau, Wolf. \\"Sidamo Features in the South Ethiopic Phonology.\\" \\"Journal of the American Oriental Society,\\" 1959. The results from a research study conducted in 1968-1969 concerning mutual intelligibility between different Sidamo languages suggest that Sidaama is more closely related to the Gedeo language, which it shares a border with to the south, than other Sidamo languages.Bender, Marvin L. and Robert L. Cooper. \\"Mutual Intelligibility Within Sidamo.\\" 1979. According to the Ethnologue, the two languages share a lexical similarity of 60%.Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed. 2005. Ethnologue: Languages of the World. 15th edition. Dallas: Summer Institute of Linguistics. Sidaama vocabulary has been influenced by Oromo vocabulary.  Grammar = Noun Phrases = In Sidaama, not all noun phrases have nouns. This can occur when it is so obvious what kind of thing the referent of the noun phrase is, that it is unnecessary for the speaker to mention it. Sidaama has two types of noun phrases without nouns. One type is made up only of an adjective or a numeral, where the adjective or the numeral agrees in case, number, and gender with the referent of a noun phrase. This is shown in the examples below: :busul-u da-√∏-ino. :smart-NOM.M come-3SG.M-PERF.3 :‚ÄòThe smart one (masculine) came.‚Äô :sas-u da-√∏-ino :three-NOM.M come-3SG.M-PERF.3 :‚ÄòThe three (masculine) came.‚Äô The other type of noun phrase without a noun is formed with a noun-phrase clitic, or NPC. This NPC starts with t (FEM) or h (MASC). This is thought to originate from the Afro-Asiatic demonstrative containing t (FEM) or k (MASC). The Sidaama NPC appears in various forms. Which form is used then depends on the gender of the referent of the noun phrase, and the syntactic role or case of the noun phrase. When a noun phrase without a noun is formed with an NPC, both the speaker and the listener know its referent. In this case, the NPC attaches to the end of a genitive noun phrase or relative clause to form a noun phrase without a noun. This is shown in the examples below: :is√≠=ti ba‚Äô-‚Äô-ino. :3SG.M.GEN=NPC.F.NOM disappear-3SG.F-PERF.3 :‚ÄòHis (FEM) disappeared.‚Äô :ani ku‚Äôu√≠ beett-√≠=ta seekk- o-mm-o. :1SG.NOM that.M.GEN child-GEN.M.MOD=NPC.F.ACC repair-PERF.1-1SG-M :‚ÄòI (MASC) repaired that boy‚Äôs (FEM).‚ÄôKawachi, Kazuhiro. \\"Noun Phrases Without Nouns in Sidaama (Sidamo).\\" 2011.

During the deployment the battle group participated in passage exercises with the navies of the countries visited. The 'passage exercises' focussed on maritime security cooperation, which included humanitarian aid & disaster relief operations and 'visit, board, search and seizure' (VBSS) drills for anti-piracy operations. These exercises aimed to increase naval inter- operability, enabling the two navies to function together smoothly during possible disaster-relief operations. In addition, during the port visits, the fleet commander along with the commanding officers of the ships met high- ranking officials of the navy, state administration, port management, coastal security organization, police, and other stakeholders of maritime security in the countries visited, to share professional experiences and exchange best practices in areas of mutual interest. = JIMEX 2012 = The ship was deployed in the North West Pacific for JIMEX 2012 (Japan-India Maritime Exercise) with the four ship group, and took part in India's first bi-lateral maritime exercise with Japan.

The UK edition retailed at twenty-five shillings. In preparation for decimalisation on 15 February 1971, it was concurrently priced on the dustjacket at ¬£1.25. The US edition retailed at $5.95. It was published to mark Christie's eightieth birthday and, by counting up both UK and US short- story collections to reach the desired total, was also advertised as her eightieth book. It is the last of her spy novels. At the beginning of the book there is a quote by Jan Smuts, \\"Leadership, besides being a great creative force, can be diabolical ...\\" Sir Stafford Nye, a middle-aged diplomat, steps into the world of spies, double agents, and secret groups to effect a change in international power centres. He meets a woman who has selected him to aid her at a crucial point, when a weather delay changes where her and his aeroplane flight lands before proceeding to England. There is much commentary on the changes in the world, especially college age youth in Europe, the United States, and South America, in the late 1960s. The novel received mixed reviews at publication and in 1990. In 2017, it was assessed favourably in an essay about speculative spy thriller novels by women. It is one of only four Christie novels not to have received an adaptation of any kind, the others being Death Comes as the End, Destination Unknown and Postern of Fate. Plot summary Sir Stafford Nye's flight home from Malaya takes an unexpected twist, when a woman approaches him in the Frankfurt Airport. The woman claims that her life is in danger, and that she needs his help. Nye agrees to lend her his travelling cloak, passport, and boarding ticket. A colleague in London, Horsham of Security, tells Nye that his action in Frankfurt saved Mary Ann's life; Sir Stafford heard another name announced for her at the airport, Daphne Theodofanous. Nye has dinner with his friend Eric, worried for his professional reputation. Mary Ann returns his passport, taped into a magazine in his post. Nye advertises in the personals section of the newspaper for his mystery woman, signing himself as Passenger to Frankfurt. She replies with tickets to an opera, given at a discreet meeting on a bridge. His great-aunt Matilda hints to him of a terrible world-wide conspiracy, which uses a phrase of music from Richard Wagner, related to the opera Siegfried (1876). Matilda detects that he has a woman in his life now. The opera is Siegfried, part of The Ring of the Nibelung by Wagner. The mystery woman attends only the second half, leaving Nye the tune for young Siegfried marked on a copy of the program, a motif for what she is doing. He attends an embassy party, given by the American ambassador and his wife, Sam and Mildred Cortman. Mary Ann is there, under her real name, Countess Renata Zerkowski. She offers Nye a ride home, but takes him instead to the home of Mr Robinson the financier, where they meet Colonel Pikeaway, Lord Altamount, James Kleek and Horsham. Nye is not seen for a while, as he has been accepted by the close-knit group of British intelligence to aid in accomplishing the tasks Mary Ann has taken on. They travel extensively. Mary Ann warns Nye that one among their own group is probably a traitor. Some believe that near the end of World War II, Adolf Hitler went to a mental institution, met with a group of people who thought they were Hitler, and exchanged places with one of them, thus surviving the war. He escaped to Argentina, where he married and had a son who was branded with a swastika on his heel. This belief encourages those who want to resurrect the beliefs and ways of the Nazis. The Countess believes she has this boy with his swastika tattoo. The story is told to the Intelligence group by psychiatrist Dr Reichardt, but they know it is false. Hitler had no son. The British Intelligence group explains in several long expository chapters how drugs, promiscuity, and student unrest in the United States and Europe are caused by Nazi agitators. The agitators begin to bring about anarchy, attacking the American ambassador and the French Marshal. The goal is to re- build fascism. Meetings in Paris and London describe the movement of money and arms and their sources, and major players. Nye's aunt, Lady Matilda, goes on her own trip, to visit her school mate, Countess Charlotte von Waldsausen, learning Charlotte's plans to be leader of the fascist world, which she then relates to her nephew. On her return, Matilda tells her friend Admiral Philip Blunt about the scientist Professor Shoreham, who invented something called Project B, or Benvo, which is a drug that makes people altruistic, but may cause a long-term change. Shoreham had a stroke, and he cannot communicate well. He had shelved Project B before his stroke. The Intelligence group meets at Shoreham's home, where he explains the limitations of his benevolent project. Kleek, traitor in the Intelligence group tries to kill Lord Altamount by poison and is blocked, so Miss Ellis the nurse to Shoreham shoots Lord Altamount, who dies of shock. Miss Ellis is recognized as Milly Jean Cortman, who had also killed her husband. The violent incident brings new energy to Shoreham, who resolves to restart work on his project. He will contact his colleague Gottlieb to restart Project Benvo and also arrange a memorial to Lord Altamount, the only politician he had ever trusted. The final chapter is an epilogue, with Nye at Matilda's house preparing for his upcoming marriage to Mary Ann. The supposed son of Hitler has been brought to England for a more normal life and is about to become the organist at their church. Sybil, Nye's 5-year-old niece, will be the flower girl at the wedding. Nye forgot a best man, but asks Sybil to bring the panda, which he bought for her at the Frankfurt airport, in it from the beginning. Characters *Sir Stafford Nye: English diplomat, age 45, with a sense of humour that marks him as unreliable to some in the diplomatic community. *Mary Ann: Countess Renata Zerkowski, who is known as Daphne Theodofanous in various situations. She starts out a woman without a name when Nye first meets her in the Frankfurt airport. She is an active member of the group seeking to prove Countess Charlotte in the wrong, collecting information worldwide. Horsham says her mother was Greek and her father was German, and a grandfather was an Austrian subject (in the days of its Empire). The Intelligence group dubs her Mary Ann, reflecting her varied work for them. *Panda: Nye buys a stuffed panda as a gift for his niece Sybil, when he is in the airport. *Lady Matilda Cleckheaton: Grand aunt of Nye who is well connected and has a mysterious past that left her with so many friends and contacts. She takes action to aid her nephew, with Lord Altamount and by her trip to Bavaria. She was schoolmate to the rich and powerful countess. *Amy Leatheran: Nurse and assistant to Lady Matilda.

He realizes that Shoreham did not burn his records of an important project, but put them in a safe somewhere. The character appeared in three other novels: Cat Among the Pigeons (1959), At Bertram's Hotel (1965), and Postern of Fate (1973). *Lord (Edward) Altamount: Retired from diplomatic service, serving as a consultant, and one of the select intelligence group. He dies of shock when Milly Jean Cortman wounds him with gunshot. *Sir James Kleek: Lord Altamount's right-hand man, who recognizes patterns. He worked for Altamount for seven years, yet he is the traitor in the group, who tries to inject Altamount with strychnine but is stopped by Horsham in the meeting at Professor Shoreham's house. Further he tries to discredit Mary Ann as being Juanita, when Kleek knows the true Juanita. *Countess Charlotte von Waldsausen: Rich and powerful woman, very fat and with health problems that make walking difficult, who lives in Bavaria. She is also called Big Charlotte and she was a schoolmate of Lady Matilda. Matilda considers her to be like the character Brunhild in the opera Siegfried by Richard Wagner.

She shoots Lord Altamount when Kleek's effort to kill him by poison is blocked. *Dr McCulloch: Tends to Professor Shoreham and sees that Shoreham is ready to work again after the incident that afternoon. Literary significance and reception Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) in The Guardian (15 October 1970) said, \\"Of all the idiotic conventions attaching to the thriller the silliest is the idea that a car whizzing round a corner at high speed can be aimed at an intended victim who has, quite unseen, stepped off the pavement into the roadway at exactly the right moment. Agatha Christie uses this twice in Passenger to Frankfurt. For the rest the book is largely a discursus on a favourite old theme of Mrs Christie's, the present state of the world and its future outlook, on both of which she takes a somewhat dim view. In other words, for her eightieth book a rather more serious work than usual from this author.\\" Maurice Richardson in The Observer (13 September 1970) began, \\"Her eightieth book and [al]though not her best very far from her worst.\\" He concluded: \\"At moments one wonders whether the old dear knows the difference between a hippie and a skinhead but she is still marvellously entertaining. I shall expect her to turn permissive for her eighty-firster.\\" Robert Barnard said of this spy novel that it was \\"The last of the thrillers, and one that slides from the unlikely to the inconceivable and finally lands up in incomprehensible muddle. Prizes should be offered to readers who can explain the ending. Concerns the youth uproar of the 'sixties, drugs, a new Aryan superman and so on, subjects of which Christie's grasp was, to say the least, uncertain (she seems to have the oddest idea of what the term 'Third World' means, for example). Collins insisted she subtitle the book 'An Extravaganza.' One can think of other descriptions.\\" Analysis Phyllis Lassner compares Passenger to Frankfurt with the Cold War novels of John le Carr√©, and with the novel The Salzburg Connection (1968) by Helen MacInnes. These novels reassess the victory of the Allies of World War II, and question the stability of post-war peace. The novels dramatise their era's anxieties about the re-emergence of Fascism during the Cold War. Lassner views both Passenger to Frankfurt and The Salzburg Connection as \\"speculative political fantasies\\". Both Christie and MacInnes employed tropes typical for spy fiction: \\"masculine leadership\\", double agents, and thrilling chases and getaways. However, both female writers revised the typical gender roles of the spy fiction genre. The female characters of the two novels play an important role in investigating and intervening in international crises. While spy fiction writers typically reduce the female characters to sidekicks or romantic distractions for their protagonists. Concerning Christie, Lassner notes that this was far from her first spy novel. Early in her career, Christie wrote a series of spy thrillers, such as The Secret Adversary (1922), The Man in the Brown Suit (1924), The Big Four (1927), and The Seven Dials Mystery (1929). However, Passenger to Frankfurt differs from other Christie novels, because it is not another example of detective fiction or crime fiction. It is a combination of thriller and dystopian fiction, exploring a hypothetical future for the entire world. The novel depicts a resurgence of Nazism, which depends on uniting the young people of the world under its creed. The new Nazi movement and its agents seduce the world's youth with promises of glory and heroism. The indoctrinated youth are manipulated into working to overthrow the governments of their respective nations and redeploying the national resources into supporting a new regime. The actual goal of the conspiracy is to establish a global oligarchy, controlled by a self-appointed master race. Lassner also notes Christie's view on Nazism in general. The Fourth Reich of the novel is depicted as relying on a culture of drug users, sadism, lust for power, and hatred. The potential rise of this Reich to power is depicted as a downfall for the ideals of Individuality and democracy, along with the associated social and political order. Aunt Matilda serves as the proverbial \\"fount of wisdom\\" of the novel, observing that the Reich is not based on new ideas, but on an old, and recurring one: that everybody must follow \\"the young hero\\", the \\"golden superman\\", \\"the young Siegfried\\". Nye dismisses his aunt's warnings about Nazism as mere fancies. Matilda notes that people said the same thing in the interwar period about Adolf Hitler and about the Hitler Youth; but at that time, Nazism was planning its rise to power through planting fifth columns in different countries, people passionately believing in the Nazi creed. Matilda argues that the same methods could work again in the Cold War era, if the Nazi message is \\"offered cleverly enough\\". Christie does not limit the dangers of the novel's era to the 1960s \\"brigades of revolutionary youth\\". Christie uses the novel to criticize the apathy of an older generation, while the youth of the era causes riots around the world. The recruitment drive for a new Children's Crusade, is (according to Christie) the result of the failure of the post-war generations (the parents and grandparents of the rioting youth) to create a better or more progressive political order. The older generations of the novel essentially cling to an \\"archaic political order\\", which offers no real progressive ideas. Lassner feels that it is not a coincidence that the novel opens with Stafford Nye dozing off at the Frankfurt Airport, reflecting Nye's casual indifference towards the political changes in the world surrounding him. The late 1960s quest of Countess Renata and Nye to stop the \\"fascist crusade\\", causes them to travel from the United Kingdom to an 18th-century Schloss, which the text places in proximity to Berchtesgaden. Berchtesgaden is described as \\"Hitler's mountain lair\\". The Schloss of the novel serves as the headquarters of Gr√§fin Charlotte von Waldsausen, the place from where she devises strategies for world domination and trying to convert individuals into an obedient mass. The novel notes that Charlotte's original family name was \\"Krapp\\". Christie intended the name as a pun, connecting the villain of the novel with the Krupp family of industrialists, which was essential for Hitler's war machine. The Gr√§fin is depicted as explicitly supporting the Holocaust, when she fondly recalls deaths in gas chambers and torture cells. Her personal wealth, essential for financing her schemes, is described in the novel as deriving from the exploitation of the world's natural resources. She reportedly earned this wealth through exploitation and control over oil, copper, goldmines in South Africa, armaments in Sweden, uranium deposits, nuclear developments, and \\"vast stretches\\" of cobalt.

It is one of only a few university teams to have entered the FA Cup 1st round proper. Caius football club has a long and distinguished history, entering the first Cuppers, the FA Cup 1st round proper in two years of the 19th century. The club has had numerous Blues, as well as an England international and Test cricket captain. Caius play their home games at Barton Road sports ground. The club enters four men's teams and a women's team into the Cambridge University Association Football League. History While no one knows exactly when Gonville & Caius College first had an official football club, it is highly likely that members of the college were playing football on Parker's Piece in the mid-19th century with other members of the university. Caius entered a team in the inaugural Cuppers tournament of 1882-1883, but took their place in history by entering the FA Cup in 1880-1881 and 1881-1882 as the only university team in the competition. The last year that Cambridge and Oxford university teams had entered was 1879-1880, the year in which Oxford finished as runners-up to Clapham Rovers. It was left to Caius to continue the Corinthian values of the amateur teams in the face of the impending dominance of professional clubs such as Blackburn Rovers and Preston North End. The challenge by Caius was not to be successful, with the team giving walkovers to Nottingham Forest in 1880 and Dreadnought in 1881. This was to mirror the end of an era for amateur clubs as the last year a university side competed in the 1st round of the FA Cup was the last year an amateur side would win the competition. The achievement of Caius has only been replicated once, in 2003, by Team Bath. Since 1881, Caius has only competed in intra-University competitions. In 2018 Caius won the Men's 2nd team, Men's 3rd team, and Women's Cuppers competition, which was one of the most successful years in club history. References *Schindler, C. (1998).

Launched two years after the NME, it never attained the circulation of its rival. The first UK album chart was published in Record Mirror in 1956, and during the 1980s it was the only consumer music paper to carry the official UK singles and UK albums charts used by the BBC for Radio 1 and Top of the Pops, as well as the US Billboard charts. The title ceased in April 1991 when United Newspapers closed or sold most of their consumer magazines, including Record Mirror and Sounds, to concentrate on newspapers. In 2010 Giovanni di Stefano bought the name Record Mirror and relaunched it as an online music gossip website in 2011. The website became inactive in 2013 following di Stefano's jailing for fraud. Early years, 1954‚Äì1963 Record Mirror was founded by former Weekly Sporting Review editor Isidore Green, who encouraged the same combative journalism as NME. Staff writers included Dick Tatham, Peter Jones and Ian Dove. Green's background was in show business and he emphasised music hall, a dying tradition. He published articles and interviews connected with theatre and musical personalities. His interest in gossip from TV, radio, stage and screen was not well received. On 22 January 1955 Record Mirror became the second music paper after NME to publish a singles chart. The chart was a Top 10, from postal returns from 24 stores. On 8 October the chart expanded to Top 20, and by 1956 more than 60 stores were being sampled. In April 1961 increased postage costs affected funding of the returns and on 24 March 1962 the paper abandoned its charts and began using those of Record Retailer, which had begun in March 1960. The first album charts in the UK were published in Record Mirror on 28 July 1956. For two months in 1959, Record Mirror failed to appear due to a national printing strike. On its return, Green renamed it Record and Show Mirror, the majority of space devoted to show business. By the end of 1960 circulation had fallen to 18,000 and Decca Records, the main shareholder, became uneasy. In March 1961, Decca replaced Green with Jimmy Watson, a former Decca press officer. Watson changed the title to New Record Mirror and eliminated show business. Circulation rose, aided by an editorial team of Peter Jones, Ian Dove and Norman Jopling. He brought in freelance columnists James Asman, Benny Green and DJ David Gell to implement a chart coverage including jazz, country and pop music. This eventually included the official UK Top 50 singles, Top 30 LPs and Top 10 EPs, as compiled by Record Retailer. The paper also listed the USA Top 50 singles, compiled by Cash Box, and charts such as the Top 20 singles of five years ago and R&B; releases. Features such as Ian Dove's \\"Rhythm & Blues Round Up\\", Peter Jones's \\"New Faces\\" and Norman Jopling's \\"Fallen Idols and Great Unknowns\\", combined with New Record Mirror's music coverage, helped circulation rise to nearly 70,000. New Record Mirror was the first national publication to publish an article on the Beatles, and the first to feature the Rolling Stones, the Searchers, the Who, and the Kinks. Bill Harry, founder and editor of the Liverpool publication Mersey Beat, wrote a column on Liverpool music. Other columnists reported on Birmingham, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle. New Record Mirror took an interest in black American R&B; artists. The paper maintained articles on old-style rock and roll. 1963‚Äì1982 During 1963 Decca Records' chairman Edward Lewis sold a substantial share of Decca's interest to John Junor, editor of the Sunday Express. Junor was looking for a paper to print by four-colour printing developed by Woodrow Wyatt in Banbury, before printing the Sunday Express in colour. Junor moved Sunday Express production to Shaftesbury Avenue and New Record Mirror became more mainstream. In November 1963, the paper returned to the name Record Mirror, and featured a colour picture of the Beatles on the cover, the first music paper in full colour. Although the first run of 120,000 sold out, the following issue fell to 60,000. Junor replaced Jimmy Watson by Peter Jones. Circulation recovered and the paper successfully continued with the same format throughout the 1960s. Following acquisition in 1962 of NME by Odhams, Record Mirror was the only independent popular music newspaper. During 1969 Record Mirror was acquired by Record Retailer and incorporated into Record Retailer offices in Carnaby Street. The acquisition saw the magazine change printers, drop full colour pin-ups and increase its size to a larger tabloid format. Jones continued as editor, supported by Valerie Mabbs, Lon Goddard, Rob Partridge, Bill McAllister (the first music journalist to herald Elton John and Rod Stewart), and broadcast-specialist Rodney Collins, who had moved from Record Retailer. Collins's links with pirate radio gave Record Mirror a continental circulation and a Dutch supplement was frequently included. Terry Chappell resumed as production editor and Bob Houston supervised the change in format. Group editorial manager Mike Hennessey contributed the first interview with John Lennon. The Record Mirror photographic studio became independent, under Dezo Hoffmann. In a studio outtake of a recording of \\"Sally Simpson\\" on the 2003 release of the deluxe edition of the Who's 1969 album Tommy, Pete Townshend said, \\"I've read the Record Mirror\\". When Keith Moon presses him to tell what he read in the Record Mirror, Pete says, to the rest of the band's laughter, that the paper said that he was known by the other members of the Who as \\"Bone\\". In 1975 Disc was incorporated into Record Mirror ‚Äì among the items brought to Record Mirror was J Edward Oliver's cartoon, which had been running in Disc for five years, and which continued for a two years in Record Mirror. By 1977 Record Retailer had become Music Week and Record Mirror was included in a sale by Billboard magazine to the Morgan-Grampian Group. Both offices moved to Covent Garden. Morgan-Grampian moved to Greater London House, north London in 1981. 1982‚Äì1991 In 1982 the paper changed from tabloid to glossy magazine. During the next nine years it had a more pop-orientated slant and containing features and comic articles, such as: *Great Pop Things, a weekly comic strip by Colin B. Morton and Chuck Death which began in 1987 and continued in NME after Record Mirror's closure *Star-spotting gossip pages, written by Johnny Dee, which also featured comedy articles *Lip ‚Äì gossip column written by Nancy Culp, and later Lisa Tilston *\\"Spot The Imposter\\" ‚Äì photoquiz with a misplaced face in the crowd *\\"Phil's World Of Wigs\\" ‚Äì each week a picture of Phil Collins appeared with new novelty haircuts, the artwork being created by art director Ian Middleton in response to readers' suggestions *\\"Pete's Poems\\" ‚Äì a weekly poem by record producer Pete Waterman (as edited by Neil Wilson) *\\"Sonia's Best Buys\\" ‚Äì value for money purchases apparently made by late 80's singer Sonia *\\"The Stone Roses New Line-Up\\" ‚Äì each week a new photo of a gurning celebrity would be added to a photo of the Stone Roses 1989 line-up, for example Harry Enfield as his character \\"Loadsamoney\\" *\\"B's Cheeseboard\\" ‚Äì various types of cheese apparently reviewed by Soul II Soul star Jazzie B *\\"Star Scene\\" ‚Äì pop stars answering questions about items in the news *\\"Tanita and Guy's Psychic Joke Hut\\" ‚Äì pictures of the heads of The House Of Love singer Guy Chadwick and singer-songwriter Tanita Tikaram telling each other jokes: both were famed for their serious natures in real life History of the charts Record Mirror became the second magazine to compile and publish a record chart on 22 January 1955. Unlike the New Musical Express who conducted a phone poll of retailers for a chart, Record Mirror arranged for its pool of retailers to send in a list of best sellers by post. The paper would finance the costs of this survey and by 1957 over 60 shops would be regularly contributing from a rotating pool of over 80. The chart was a top 10 until 8 October 1955. It then became a top 20; which it stayed at until being replaced by the Record Retailer top 50. It also inaugurated the countries first Long Player chart, which commenced as a top five on 28 July 1956. By March 1962, Record Mirror adopted publication of Record Retailers top 50 from 24 March 1962. After 21 April 1966, Record Mirror published a \\"Bubbling Under List\\" right under the main chart (at the time the Singles Top 50, the Albums Top 30 and the EP Top 10). \\"The Breakers\\", as it was called later in the year, were 10 to 15 records (for the singles chart) which had not made the top 50 that week, but were poised to reach the big chart the next week ranked in sales order i.e. as if they occupied positions 51 to 64. \\"The Breakers\\" list was ceased when BMRB took over chart compilation in February 1969 but by September 1970, it was re-instated (singles only) and appeared of and on under the main chart up until May 1978 (when the top 75 was introduced). In the years 1974 and 1975 the list even expanded to 30 titles, of which the first 10 were called \\"Star Breakers\\" and given in order of sales, with the other 20 were listed alphabetically. In January 1983, when Gallup took over chart compilation, the singles chart extended to a Top 100, with positions 76‚Äì100 as 'The Next 25' ‚Äì excluding singles dropping out of the Top 75 or with significantly reduced sales. 'The Next 25' was discontinued by Music Week in November 1990. Record Mirror continued printing it until the magazine's demise in April 1991. Inclusion of music charts In 1984, when British tabloids started bingo competitions, Record Mirror became the first music paper to experiment with something similar. Record Mirror was the only magazine during the 1980s to print the weekly US singles and album charts, with analysis by chart statistician Alan Jones. =Music charts included= *UK Top 100 Singles Chart *UK Top 75 Albums and Compilation Albums Charts *Vintage chart from a bygone year *US Billboard Singles Chart *US Billboard Albums Chart *US Billboard Black Singles Chart *Music Video Chart *12-inch singles Top 20 Chart *Compact Disc Top 20 Chart *Reggae Chart (dropped in 1987) Inclusion of disco column In June 1975, DJ James Hamilton (1942‚Äì1996) started writing a weekly \\"disco\\" column, which in the 1980s expanded into a general dance music section known as BPM. Hamilton had started DJing in London in the early 1960s, and had been writing about US soul and R&B; for Record Mirror since 1964, originally as Dr Soul. After a visit to the Paradise Garage in the 1970s to see Larry Levan play, he came back to the UK a convert to mixing records, unknown at the time. To promote his views, he developed his onomatopoeic style of describing a record, and from 1979 he started timing and including the beats per minute of records he reviewed. DJ directory Hamilton later included the DJ directory. =Article headings included in the DJ directory= *Beats and Pieces ‚Äì news and gossip from the dance music world *Hot Vinyl ‚Äì track listings of new records *\\"Club Chart\\" (previously known as the Disco Chart) *\\"Cool Cuts\\" Chart *Pop Dance Chart *Hi- NRG Chart Take over and closure In 1987 Morgan-Grampian was acquired by United Newspapers (now UBM). On 2 April 1991, Record Mirror closed on the same day as its United Newspapers sister publication Sounds, with the last issue dated 6 April 1991. The final cover featured Transvision Vamp. Eleanor Levy, the final editor, believed the decision to close the magazine was \\"taken by accountants rather than people who understand music. When I explained to one of the management team that our strength was dance music, he thought I meant Jive Bunny.\\" James Hamilton moved to the trade magazine, Jocks, which was changing to a dance magazine as DJ Mag. Record Mirror continued as a four-page supplement in Music Week. In later years the supplement concentrated on dance music: dance charts were later incorporated into Music Week. Hamilton continued to review record for the supplement until two weeks before his death on 17 June 1996.

He was portrayed by Jack Nicholson in the novel's 1980 film adaptation, by Steven Weber in the 1997 miniseries, by Brian Mulligan in the 2016 opera and by Henry Thomas in the 2019 film adaptation of Doctor Sleep. The American Film Institute rated the character (as played by Nicholson) the 25th-greatest film villain of all time. In 2008, Jack Torrance was selected by Empire magazine as one of the 100 greatest movie characters. Premiere magazine also ranked Torrance on their list of their 100 greatest movie characters of all time.  Biography = In novels = He grew up in Berlin, New Hampshire, where his father Mark Torrance worked in the Regional Community Hospital. He also has three older siblings: Brett, Becky and Mike. He is a writer, former teacher, and debate team coach whose alcoholism and volatile temper costs him his teaching position at Stovington Preparatory School, when he assaults George Hatfield, a student and former member of the debate team, whom he catches vandalizing his car. Later, his drinking nearly ends his marriage to his wife, Wendy, after he breaks his son Danny's arm in a blind rage. He finally decides to quit drinking after a drunk driving accident in which he and a friend run over an abandoned bicycle in the road and realize they could've killed a child. He accepts a position maintaining the isolated Overlook Hotel in Colorado for the winter, hoping this will salvage his family, re-establish his career, and give him the time and privacy to finish a promising play. He moves to the hotel with Wendy and Danny, who is telepathic and sensitive to supernatural forces. Danny receives guidance from an imaginary friend he calls \\"Tony.\\" Danny is also comforted by meeting the hotel's kindly cook, Dick Hallorann, who shares Danny's telepathic abilities. It is later revealed that Jack's father, also an alcoholic, was abusive towards his family. A flashback scene in the novel shows his drunk father brutally bashing Jack's mother with a cane. The Hotel is haunted by the ghosts of those who died violently within it and is itself host to a being of unknown origin, who wishes to coerce Jack into killing Danny. Apparently, the Hotel believes if it can harness the boy's \\"shining\\", then it can gather enough power to \\"break free\\" of the building in which it has somehow become trapped. Jack has encounters with ghosts of previous staff of the hotel, who insist he has always been working there and he must kill his family. Jack eventually succumbs to these supernatural forces, starts drinking again, and grows to hate his own wife and child. Jack cuts off all radio communications and sabotages the hotel snowmobile, their only means of transportation. He then tries to kill Wendy, who knocks him out and locks him in a storage room. Jack is later helped out of the food storage room by the ghost of the previous caretaker, who murdered his own family before committing suicide. Jack then brutally attacks Wendy with a roque mallet he found, although she escapes. He is interrupted by the arrival of Hallorann, whom he almost beats to death. Jack finds and confronts Danny, and is about to kill him when his son reaches through the hotel's power and brings out his father's true self. Jack tells Danny to run and remember how much he loves him, before the hotel's power takes over again and forces Jack to bash in his own face with the mallet. Jack had forgotten to dump the boiler, which grows too hot and causes the hotel to explode. Jack is killed, but Danny, Wendy and Hallorann get out just in time. In the sequel novel Doctor Sleep (2013), Danny (now going by Dan) learns that Jack is also the biological father of Lucy Stone, a woman whose daughter Abra has manifested ‚Äúshining‚Äù abilities even stronger than Dan's. Shortly before he was fired from his teaching position, and unbeknownst to Wendy, Jack had a brief sexual encounter with a student teacher Sandy Reynolds at a party that led to Lucy's conception. Dan is thus Lucy's half-brother and Abra's half- uncle. This book gives Jack's middle name as Edward rather than Daniel. In the climax of the novel, Jack's ghost intervenes to help Danny, now going by \\"Dan\\", Dan's friend Billy Freeman, and Lucy and Abra Stone defeat the main antagonists, Rose the Hat and the True Knot, at the site where the Overlook once stood. After the battle, Jack and Dan make peace with each other before he, Billy, and Abra left the location. =In film= Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson) is portrayed in a less sympathetic manner in the 1980 film. In the novel, Jack is a tragic hero whose shortcomings lead to his defeat, while the film implies that he is prone to insanity from the start. The film also leaves out Jack's traumatic childhood. The film's first major deviation from the source material occurs when Jack attacks Hallorann. In the film, instead of merely injuring him with the mallet, Jack kills Hallorann by planting an axe in his chest. In the film, Jack hears Danny scream as he kills Hallorann, and chases his son to a hedge maze outside the hotel, while in the novel, topiary animals come to life and threaten Danny. In the film, Danny walks backwards in his own footprints to mislead Jack, then jumps to a side path and slips out of the maze. In the film, Wendy and Danny escape the hotel in Hallorann's Snowcat, while Jack gets lost trying to pick up Danny's tracks, sits down to rest, and freezes to death. This is in contrast to the book, in which Hallorann, Wendy and Danny all escape minutes before the boiler explodes, killing Jack. The film ends featuring an old photograph of a ball at the hotel from July 4, 1921, that shows Jack at the event. In the film adaptation of Doctor Sleep, Torrance's likeness (Henry Thomas) is taken by The Bartender at the Overlook for an interaction with the adult Danny (Ewan McGregor), which is expanded in the director's cut to include a following scene in the bathroom. Thomas also portrays Torrance in flashback sequences. =In miniseries= Author Stephen King was unhappy with director Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film adaptation of the novel, particularly Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance: King then decided to create a miniseries based on his vision of the novel, with Jack Torrance as a more sympathetic character. Torrance in the miniseries is similar to the character in the novel, but the ending is changed. In the book, Jack redeems himself, and the boiler explodes due to the hotel's negligence. In the miniseries, Jack sacrifices himself by causing the boiler to explode in order to destroy the hotel. The miniseries ends with a scene not in the book: Danny graduates from high school, while his spectral father looks on. = In opera = An opera based on Stephen King's 1977 novel originated with Eric Simonson, who directed the premiere production of the opera, and Minnesota Opera Artistic Director Dale Johnson. Paul Moravec and Mark Campbell planned to design their opera to adhere to King's novel, unlike the 1980 film adaptation. Jack and the other characters were portrayed similarly like in the novel, and it was approved of by King.

The UK edition retailed at ¬£1.50 and the US edition at $6.95. It was the last Miss Marple novel the author wrote, although Sleeping Murder was the last Miss Marple novel to be published. Miss Marple first encounters Jason Rafiel in A Caribbean Mystery, where they solve a mystery. Miss Marple receives communications from him, sent posthumously, setting up the plot of this novel. Plot summary Miss Marple receives a letter from the solicitors of the recently deceased Jason Rafiel, a millionaire whom she had met during a holiday on which she had encountered a murder, which asks her to look into an unspecified crime; if she succeeds in solving the crime, she will inherit ¬£20,000. Rafiel has left her few clues. She begins by joining a tour of famous British houses and gardens with fifteen other people, arranged by Mr Rafiel prior to his death. Elizabeth Temple is the retired school headmistress who relates the story of Verity, who was engaged to Rafiel's ne'er-do-well son, Michael, but the marriage did not happen. Another member of the tour group, Miss Cooke, is a woman she had met briefly in St Mary Mead. Her next clue comes from Lavinia Glynne; Rafiel had written to Mrs Glynne and her two sisters before his death, suggesting Miss Marple spend the most physically challenging few days of the tour with them. Miss Marple accepts Lavinia's invitation. She then meets Lavinia's spinster sisters, Clotilde and Anthea Bradbury-Scott. On talking with the servant, Miss Marple learns Verity joined the family after both her parents died, becoming quite attached to Clotilde. Verity is dead now, brutally murdered. Michael Rafiel is in prison. On the morning of her return to her party, Miss Marple learns Miss Temple had been injured by a rockslide during the previous day's hike, and was lying in a coma in hospital. The group stays over an extra night to wait for news from the tour guide about Miss Temple's health. Professor Wanstead, a pathologist and psychologist interested in criminal brains, had been instructed by Mr Rafiel to go on the tour. He had examined Michael Rafiel at the request of the head of the prison where Michael was incarcerated; he came to the conclusion Michael was not capable of murder. He tells Miss Marple how uninterested Michael's father seemed. He mentions a missing young local woman, Nora Broad, and he fears she will be found murdered. Wanstead takes Miss Marple to see Miss Temple; in a moment of consciousness, Miss Temple had asked for Miss Marple. Miss Temple wakes long enough to tell Miss Marple to \\"search for Verity Hunt\\", and dies that night. The three sisters extend their invitation to Miss Marple when she decides not to return to the tour, and she promptly accepts. That night, Mrs Glynne tells the story of Verity in their household to Miss Marple. After the inquiry into Miss Temple's death, Miss Marple is visited by Archdeacon Brabazon, a friend of Miss Temple. He tells Miss Marple he was going to marry Verity Hunt and Michael Rafiel in a secret ceremony. While he disapproved of the secrecy and worried about their prospects, he agreed to marry them because he could see they were in love. He was most surprised when neither turned up for the wedding, nor sent a note. Miss Marple stays another few nights with the three sisters when the tour moves on. Professor Wanstead travels to London by train on an errand for Miss Marple. Miss Barrow and Miss Cooke decide they will visit a nearby church. Later that evening, Miss Marple talks with the sisters about what she thinks may have happened and, while they are doing so, Miss Barrow and Miss Cooke appear, to talk to Miss Marple. They stay for a time and are then invited back for coffee that evening. As they talk about Miss Temple, Miss Marple suggests, albeit dissembling, Joanna Crawford and Emlyn Price (two of those on the tour) pushed the boulder, and their alibis are mere fabrication. As they get ready to leave, Miss Cooke suggests the coffee would not suit Miss Marple, as it will keep her up all night. Clotilde then offers some warm milk. The two ladies soon depart, although each returns to retrieve a forgotten item. At three o'clock in the morning, Clotilde enters Miss Marple's room, surprised when Miss Marple turns on the light. Miss Marple tells her she did not drink the milk. Clotilde offers to warm it up, but Miss Marple tells her she still would not drink it because she knows Clotilde killed Verity Hunt and buried her body in the wreck of the greenhouse, because she could not bear Verity leaving her for someone else. She also knows Clotilde brutally murdered Nora Broad to (mis)identify her body as Verity's and thus throw suspicion on Michael Rafiel. Clotilde murdered Miss Temple as well. As Clotilde advances toward her, Miss Marple blows on a whistle, which brings Miss Cooke and Miss Barrow to her defence ‚Äî they are bodyguards employed by Mr Rafiel to protect Miss Marple. Clotilde drinks the milk herself, which is poisoned. Miss Marple tells the story to the Home Secretary, including that Verity is buried on the property of the Bradbury-Scotts. Michael Rafiel is set free. Miss Marple collects her inheritance, confident she completed the task given her. Characters *Miss Marple: Single woman who is getting frail with age, a natural detective.

Literary significance and reception Matthew Coady in The Guardian of 4 November 1971 concluded, \\"Not a Christie classic but the old hand is astonishingly fresh and the mixture as relaxing as a hot bath.\\"The Guardian. 4 November 1971 (p. 14). Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 31 October 1971 said of Miss Marple in this story, \\"The showdown when, alone in bed, quite defenceless with not even a knitting-needle, she is confronted by a brawny great fiend of a butch, is devilish fine. Not one of her best, perhaps, but remarkably inventive, quite worthy of the Picasso of the detective story.\\"The Observer, 31 October 1971 (p. 31) The Daily Mirror of 28 October 1971 said, \\"With this first-rate story Dame Agatha triumphantly returns to the traditional detective novel after a spell of psychological suspense.\\"Daily Mirror, 28 October 1971 (p. 25) Robert Weaver in the Toronto Daily Star of 4 December 1971 said, \\"Christie richly deserves the loyalty offered up to her by devotees of the traditional mystery. She is readable and ingenious, and in Nemesis she has going for her the amateur lady sleuth Miss Jane Marple deep in a murder case as she tries to carry out a request that comes in effect from beyond the grave. Beyond 80 Miss Christie remains unflagging.\\"Toronto Daily Star, 4 December 1971 (p. 51) Robert Barnard commented about the plot that \\"Miss Marple is sent on a tour of stately gardens by Mr Rafiel.\\" His generally negative view of the novel was tersely expressed in one sentence: \\"The garden paths we are led up are neither enticing nor profitable. All the usual strictures about late Christie apply.\\". Film, TV or theatrical adaptations=Television= In 1987, Nemesis was broadcast by the BBC in two 50-minute parts on Sunday, 8 February, and Sunday, 15 February 1987. It was the eighth adaptation (of twelve) in the series Miss Marple starring Joan Hickson as Miss Marple. It deviates quite significantly from the novel. Miss Temple is killed by a stone bust pushed off a balcony while she tours a library rather than by a rock slide during a hike, Michael Rafiel is not sent to prison for Verity's death as he was never charged due to lack of proof and instead is seen living on the streets, and Nora Broad's name is changed to Norah Brent. A new fictional nephew/godson of Miss Marple, Lionel Peel, accompanies her; he is staying with her after his wife chucked him out. Also, the characters of Emlyn Price and Joanna Crawford are removed. At the time of the broadcast, the prequel story \\"A Caribbean Mystery\\" had not been produced or broadcast. The part of Jason Rafiel was eventually played by Donald Pleasence and not by Frank Gatliff who portrayed the character in this production.

As with other adaptations made for this series, this version was only very loosely based on the novel, with the plot, motives and identity of most of the characters and scenes altered, and almost everything about the character of the murderer substantially changed. Sister Clotilde still murders Verity for deciding to leave the nunnery (leave her) and marry Michael. She informs the Mother Superior that an unknown and heavily bandaged soldier has died, but covers Verity in bandages so she is buried as 'Ralph Collins'. When she sees a desperate woman's newspaper advert seeking her husband, Martin Waddy, who went missing in Dunkirk, Sister Clotilde tells the soldier (who has lost his memory) that he is Martin Waddy. She then passes him over to the desperate wife, who accepts him. This deception is what leads to the other murders. Sister Clotilde commits suicide melodramatically with a statue saint's spear, and Ralf meets his real wife who has lived as a widow for eleven years.

It is the only regularly scheduled Fox News program carried on the main Fox network. Overview The program began on April 28, 1996, 5¬Ω months prior to the launch of the network's sister cable news network Fox News Channel. When the show originally launched, there was no studio, it aired from historic locations in the Washington DC area. The show was the first network news show to stream live on the Internet. The show was also the first to incorporate live user commentary. Users posted on an Internet BBS and the Internet Producer moderated by choosing and posting the comments in the screen's lower third. The show airs live at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, although many Fox stations can choose to broadcast it at a later time slot. For example, due to voluminous Packers pre-game and E/I requirements in the 2017 NFL season, WITI in Milwaukee has carried it in the past in Sunday late night. The program is also rebroadcast on Fox News Channel the same day at 2:00 and 7:00 p.m. ET. The show was hosted by Tony Snow until 2003, when he left to become White House Press Secretary under President George W. Bush). It has been hosted by Chris Wallace since 2003. An audio-only broadcast of the program is also carried on a number of radio stations. Most of these stations are owned by iHeartMedia (the former Clear Channel Communications), the largest radio station group that runs the division's Fox News Radio newscasts, along with WCSP-FM (C-SPAN Radio) in the Washington area and over the Internet, as part of its weekly audio airings of the major Sunday morning talk shows. In August 2008, Fox News Sunday began to be produced in high definition. Format Chris Wallace interviewing Maryland Governor Larry Hogan in 2015. The first minute or so of the broadcast runs down the day's headlines, since Fox, unlike the Big Three television networks, does not have a conventional national morning news program that leads into Fox News Sunday, though a limited amount of Fox's affiliates have local news programs leading into it. For the rest of the first half of the show, Wallace interviews news makers from the prior week. During the second half of the show, Wallace introduces a panel of four pundits to speak about the political impact of the news. Regular members of the panel include Brit Hume, National Public Radio correspondent Mara Liasson and the Hill columnist Juan Williams; Stephen F. Hayes and Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard, Associated Press White House reporter Julie Pace, columnists Charles Lane and George Will, Fortune Washington bureau chief Nina Easton, Fox News Washington deputy managing editor Bill Sammon, former state department official Liz Cheney, former Clinton chief of staff John Podesta, former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, USA Today columnist Kirsten Powers, radio host Laura Ingraham, Roll Call columnist Mort Kondracke, Washington Examiner reporter Byron York and Washington Post reporter Ceci Connelly also appear on the panel on a limited basis. The program ends with a short segment focusing on a \\"Power Player of the Week\\", usually a short, non-political \\"feel-good\\" story.

The book features her detectives Tommy and Tuppence Beresford and is the detectives' last appearance. It is the last novel Christie wrote, but not the last to be published as it was followed by two previously unpublished novels from the 1940s. It is one of only four Christie novels not to have received an adaptation of any kind, the others being Death Comes as the End, Destination Unknown, and Passenger to Frankfurt. Explanation of the Title The title comes from the poem Gates of Damascus by James Elroy Flecker. The poem is also referenced in the short story The Gate of Baghdad in the 1934 collection Parker Pyne Investigates. Plot summary Now in their seventies (though the author never states their age clearly), Tommy and Tuppence move to a quiet English village, looking forward to a peaceful retirement. But, as they soon discover, their rambling old house holds secrets. Who is Mary Jordan? And why has someone left a coded message in an old book about her \\"unnatural\\" death? Once more, ingenuity and insight are called for as they are drawn into old mysteries and new dangers. Literary significance and reception Most critics remarked how noticeable Christie's advanced age is here. For example, the main characters Tommy and Tuppence, also of advanced age, seem to forget in one chapter what they discussed in the previous chapter. Some conversations seem to be repeated again and again, before any action takes place. Some puzzles which are obvious and easy to solve for the reader take chapters to be tackled by the main characters. Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 11 November 1973 was positive in his review: \\"Now in their seventies, the Beresfords, that amateur detective couple of hers whom some of us found too sprightly for comfort, have acquired a Proustian complexity. A code message in an Edwardian children's book puts them on to the murder of a governess involved in a pre-1914 German spy case. Past and present go on interlocking impressively. Despite political naivety; this is a genuine tour de force with a star part for Hannibal, the Manchester Terrier.\\"The Observer, 11 November 1973 (p. 36) Robert Barnard wrote negatively that Postern of Fate was \\"The last book Christie wrote.

Fontana Books, 1990; According to The Cambridge Guide to Women's Writing in English, this novel is one of the \\"execrable last novels\\" in which Christie purportedly \\"loses her grip altogether\\". A Canadian study which compared the texts of a number of Christie novels indicated that her later works, including Postern of Fate, showed a 30% decrease in vocabulary. This change, along with the use of indeterminate words and repetitiveness, are indicative of Alzheimer's disease, although Christie was never diagnosed with the disorder.

Cmdr. Schaufelberger meets the press in May 1983 just days before his death (Photo: Sacha Rocos) Albert Arthur Schaufelberger (August 8, 1949 ‚Äì May 25, 1983) was a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy who was assassinated in El Salvador. Background Schaufelberger was a graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, class of 1971 and was an avid (150 lb) American football and lacrosse player while in college. His father, Albert Arthur Schaufelberger (Senior), was a decorated fighter and bomber pilot during the Vietnam War. Role in El Salvador Schaufelberger was commissioned as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy on June 9, 1971. ENS Schaufelberger next attended Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) training with Class 65 at NAB Coronado, California, from August 1971 to March 1972, followed by service with Underwater Demolition Team TWELVE from March 1972 to June 1975. LT Schaufelberger's next assignment was as the Swimmer Delivery Vehicle (SDV) Platoon Commander with SEAL Team ONE at NAB Coronado from June 1975 to November 1976, and then as an SDV Instructor with BUD/S training at NAB Coronado from November 1976 to January 1979. He served as an Ordnance Officer, Platoon Commander and Operations Officer with SEAL Team ONE at Coronado from January 1979 to February 1981, and then attended the Spanish Language Course at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, from February 1981 to February 1982. Lieutenant Commander Schaufelberger was the senior U.S. Naval representative at the U.S. Military Group, El Salvador from August 1982 till he was killed in San Salvador on May 25, 1983. He was a United States Navy SEAL, second in command of the U.S. Military Group advising the Salvadoran Military on counter insurgency, special operations and weapons traffic interdiction operations.https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/26/world/deputy-chief-of-us- military-unit-is-shot-and-killed-in-san-salvador.html In addition, he was security chief for the 53 U.S. military advisors in the country at the time. Schaufelberger had responsibility, among other duties, for naval operations in the Gulf of Fonseca which were run out of the La Union naval base. It was at the La Union naval base where Schaufelberger allowed himself to be photographed for the last time several days before his assassination. Schaufelberger's death was the first of a U.S. military member in El Salvador following the October 1980 arrival in country of U.S. military advisors. Assassination At approximately 6:30 pm on May 25, 1983, Schaufelberger was assassinated on the grounds of the Central American University in San Salvador.http://jko.jten.mil/courses/atl1/courseFiles/resources/Albert_Schaufelberger.pdf A group under the umbrella of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), the Central American Revolutionary Workers' Party (PRTC), is thought to have carried out the act. Schaufelberger had been dating the manager of a cooperative store, Consuelo Escalante Aguilera,http://people.com/archive/lt- comdr-albert-schaufelberger-the-first-u-s-military-casualty-in-el-salvador- comes-home-vol-19-no-23/ for several months and developed a routine of picking her up at the same time and place.http://jko.jten.mil/courses/atl1/courseFiles/resources/Albert_Schaufelberger.pdf On May 25 he arrived and sounded the horn of his armored embassy-provided Ford Maverick, his signal to inform his date that he had arrived. Ms. Aguilera exited her office and observed what she believed to be a white Volkswagen microbus pull up and stop near Schaufelberger's car. Reportedly several individuals were involved with the assassination, with at least one firing through the open window of Schaufelberger's car. Schaufelberger's was shot four times in the head.https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/26/world/deputy-chief- of-us-military-unit-is-shot-and-killed-in-san-salvador.html Schaufelberger's car leaped forward, impacting a car directly in front of it. The assassins then jumped into their vehicle and escaped. Unfortunately for him, Schaufelberger had removed the bullet-resistant glass over the driver's-side window after the air conditioner in his vehicle had broken.http://jko.jten.mil/courses/atl1/courseFiles/resources/Albert_Schaufelberger.pdf Schaufelberger saw his role in El Salvador of preventing a communist takeover of the country for all of the people of El Salvador‚Äînot just those of means. He realized, however, that he might be a target of the insurgents, given the success of the weapon interdiction efforts. During his last discussion with journalists covering U.S.-advised Salvadoran military operations, Schaufelberger told those present that the insurgents \\"know who I am, and where I live\\". His house had apparently already received drive-by gunfire on a recent evening prior to the assassination. Press coverage Albert Schaufelberger's assassination was featured on the front cover of the June 6, 1983, edition of Newsweek magazine. The U.S. edition was headlined The First Casualty and the international edition Shooting to Kill. Schaufelberger was photographed in uniform and interviewed by international media representatives (including Newsweek) one week before his death.

Polo wraps are bandage materials, usually made of fleece, for a horse's legs. They can be quite stretchy compared to other bandaging materials, and are used mainly for protection during ridden work, longeing, and turnout. Uses of polo wraps A horse wearing white polo wraps Polo wraps can be used for many tasks and disciplines: they protect against minor scrapes and bruises and help prevent irritation from sand or arena footing. Usually, polos are used without any padding underneath. Some common activities polo wraps are used in include: * Riding. Polos may also be used while riding, most commonly on dressage horses or while schooling show hunters or show jumpers. The jumpers and equitation divisions permit the use of polos in competition, however, most riders opt for boots, as they provide better protection. * Longeing. Polos are also commonly used during longeing. * Turnout. Some people turn their horses out in polos, although they must take care that the horse is not turned out in a wet pasture and that the polos are well secured. * Shipping. Horses are sometimes shipped in polos for protection. However, shipping bandages or shipping boots provide much better protection, and are therefore preferable. Applying polo wraps There are several different ways to apply a polo wrap. The methods differ primarily in the location the wrapping is begun. Some people begin at the top of the leg and wrap down and then back up; others begin at the middle of the leg and wrap first one half and then the other. Wrapping styles also differ in whether the wrap extends, sling-like, beneath the fetlock joint. While the amount of support the sling affords the tendons and ligaments is debatable, it does provide a limited amount of protection to the joint from scrapes, bruises, and accidental overstep with the hind legs (\\"overreaching\\"). No matter how the wrap is applied, the tension in the wrap should be as uniform as possible across the entire leg. Uneven pressure may cause damage to tendons. Additionally, the pressure on one leg should be comparable to the pressure on leg on the other side; otherwise gait abnormalities may result. Conventional wisdom holds that because no two people wrap with exactly the same tension, the same person should wrap the right and left legs. Advantages of polo wraps A horse wearing polo wraps on the front legs while being turned out for exercise. Polos can be used for a horse who cannot wear boots (for example, a horse may be sensitive to neoprene, or have minor cuts on his leg that would be rubbed if a boot were worn). Polo wraps are often chosen for a horse whose legs are blemished with significant scar tissue that would prevent a boot from fitting properly. Unlike boots, polos conform perfectly to any leg, and may also be used on horses and ponies of any size, depending on the length. Many riders prefer polos due to the 'cleaner' look they provide. Lastly, polos usually cover a greater area of the leg than boots, and if the groom is experienced, may be customized to provide slightly more protection in one area of the leg. Disadvantages of polo wraps Perhaps the most notable disadvantage of polo wraps is their close proximity to the horse's tendons and ligaments; incorrect application (uneven distribution of tension, too tight, etc.) can damage the tendons. Polo wraps only stay on the leg as well as they are put on; if wrapped too loosely or the velcro is weak, you may be creating a potentially dangerous situation. Polos are not suitable for use in potentially wet conditions (such as cross-country riding or riding through puddles), as they absorb water and become very heavy and sag. Also, polos are more time-consuming to apply than boots and need to be washed frequently to remove irritants like dried sweat or sand. Polos can also be pulled down and tighten around the tendons if a horse were to step on himself while wearing them. Alternatives to polo wraps Exercise bandages are a good alternative if the horse needs more protection and support. Brushing boots and galloping boots provide protection, and boots with neoprene can also provide support to the tendons and ligaments.

Lashly was also recognised with the Albert Medal for playing a key role in saving the life of a comrade on the second of the two expeditions.  Career = Discovery expedition = The son of a farm worker, Lashly was born in Hambledon, Hampshire, a village near Portsmouth, England. At the time he joined Scott's Discovery expedition in 1901, he was a 33-year-old leading stoker in the Royal Navy, serving on . On this expedition, Lashly proved a success and was a member of Scott's \\"Farthest West\\" party exploring Victoria Land in 1903. A teetotaller and non-smoker, he was quiet and strong, good- natured, dependable and acknowledged by Reginald Skelton as 'the best man far and away in the ship'. Before joining Scott's next Antarctic expedition in 1910, he served as an instructor at the Royal Naval College, Osborne, on the Isle of Wight. = Terra Nova expedition = On Scott's second expedition in 1911‚Äì1913, Lashly was initially in charge of one of the expedition's two motor sledges which were to haul supplies southward in support of the polar party. However, the sledges quickly broke down, and the motor party had to switch to man-hauling the supplies. On 4 January 1912, along with Lieutenant Edward Evans and Tom Crean, he was a member of the last support party to be sent back by Scott on his way to the pole. During the return journey, Evans became seriously ill with scurvy, and on 11 February, collapsed, unable to walk any further. Still from Hut Point camp and safety, he tried to persuade Lashly and Crean to leave him to save themselves, but they refused. Strapping him onto the sledge, they pulled him for days until with only one to two days' food rations left, but still four or five days' sledge pulling to do, they had to stop. Lashly then stayed with Evans in the tent to nurse him while Crean walked the remaining alone in 18 hours to reach Hut Point camp, where he was able to fetch help. Extracts from Lashly's polar journals, chronicling his tribulations with the motor sledges and the return journey with Evans, were included in Apsley Cherry-Garrard's book, The Worst Journey in the World. Both Lashly and Crean received the Albert Medal for saving Evans' life. = Royal Navy = After returning from the Antarctic, Lashly retired from the Royal Navy with a pension, but promptly joined the reserves and served in World War I on and . Later he served as a customs officer in Cardiff. Upon his retirement in 1932, he returned to Hambledon where he lived in a house he called \\"Minna Bluff\\", after one of the landmarks on the road to the South Pole. Lashly died on 12 June 1940.  Antarctic diaries  In 1969, Lashly's diaries were edited and published by A. R. Ellis as Under Scott's Command: Lashly's Antarctic Diaries.

She was portrayed by Linda Blair in both films and by Geena Davis in the television series. Character Regan MacNeil is a 12-year-old girl and the daughter of actress Chris MacNeil. Regan is caught between her mother's grueling working schedule and the fact that her parents are in the process of an acrimonious divorce (her father is in Europe and is not seen in the movie). She is named for the character in Shakespeare‚Äôs ‚ÄúKing Lear‚Äù. She is described as shy, even different, and it is not within her nature to behave aggressively. She is devoted to her mother, making clay animals as gifts for her and leaving a rose at her place at the kitchen table each morning. Chris is determined to be a good mother, spending all her off days with her. Because she is an atheist, she does not teach Regan about religion, but when Regan has questions about God, Chris tries to answer reassuringly. Even though Chris knows Regan very well, it takes her some time to realize that Regan's bizarre changes are not neurological. As soon as she accepts the idea of possession, she consults Fr. Karras and begs him to evaluate Regan for an exorcism. While Karras is initially skeptical, he becomes convinced of her possession and immediately calls for an exorcism. Karras and Father Merrin perform an exorcism and succeed in exorcising the demon, albeit at the cost of their own lives. Regan retains no memory of her possession. Shortly afterwards, Chris and Regan decide to move. On the day of the move, Father Dyer visits their home and, upon seeing his clerical collar, Regan embraces him, implying she has not totally lost her memory. In the sequel Exorcist II: The Heretic, which takes place four years after the events in The Exorcist, Regan is 16 years old, living in New York City and undergoing psychiatric therapy, claiming to remember nothing about her plight in Washington, D.C. while her psychiatrist believes her memories are only buried or repressed. As the story progresses, Regan is revealed to have psychic healing powers (the reason why the demon attacked her previously). For The Exorcist III, Carolco Pictures had the idea of a grown up Regan who gives birth to possessed twins but it was abandoned and the story was switched to Blatty's novel Legion instead. John Carpenter was asked to direct The Exorcist III, but backed out when he realized William Peter Blatty really wanted to direct himself and because of creative differences, however they remained friends. Regan McNeil appears in the television series The Exorcist. As an adult she changed her name to Angela Rance to escape the demons, but they find her again and attack her family, possessing her younger daughter Casey; Angela/Regan makes a deal with Pazuzu to allow herself to become repossessed in order to save Casey's life. While possessing her, Pazuzu seizes the opportunity to murder her mother Chris. Angela/Regan, with the help of the priests Tomas Ortega and Marcus Keane, finds the strength to once again evict the demon from her body and soul, but he retaliates by breaking her back in punishment, rendering her wheelchair- bound but still alive. Casting (film) The Exorcist, Linda Blair was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture. Actress/comedian April Winchell states that she was seriously considered for the role until she developed pyelonephritis, which caused her to be hospitalized and ultimately taken out of consideration.5 things you don't know about April Winchell, Mr. KABC Radio Show audio archive, accessed February 8, 2007 Pamelyn Ferdin was a candidate for the role, but the producers may have felt she was too well- known.\\"Among Ferdin's disappointments was losing the role of Regan MacNeil in the 1973 movie, The Exorcist to Linda Blair.\\" Bob Leszczak, The Odd Couple on Stage and Screen (McFarland, 2014).

It is common in televised wrestling because it is simple and relatively safe, yet looks powerful on camera. The chokeslam is typically used as a finisher by large wrestlers, further enhancing its perception as a powerful maneuver. This maneuver can be more damaging if the victim is slammed into an object, such as a table, steel chair, or garbage can. It is a common move performed by taller and bigger wrestlers. The most common variety of chokeslam is performed with a single-handed choke. The wrestler places their free hand behind the opponent's back or hooks the trunks to help turn them horizontally for the throw. Although a chokeslam begins with a \\"choke\\", it is not usually considered to be an illegal move. The single arm choke that normally precedes a chokeslam is known as a goozle. The chokeslam was innovated by Paul Heyman for use by the wrestler 911, though one of the earliest accounts of the move dates back to a 19th-century recounting that describes Abraham Lincoln (himself a wrestler in his youth) using a technique very similar in description. It is often used by large, powerful wrestlers such as The Undertaker, Kane, Big Show, Abyss, The Great Khali, Vader and Braun Strowman. This is because a larger, taller wrestler will be able to deliver a much higher, more impressive chokeslam than most smaller wrestlers. Their height and/or larger frames can also give them extra time to correct a botch if something goes wrong. However, some smaller wrestlers and even female performers have used the chokeslam, including Lacey Von Erich and The Hurricane, among others.  Variations = Back suplex chokeslam = In this elevated chokeslam, innovated by Akira Taue, the wrestler stands behind the opponent, puts their head under one of the opponent's arms, and lifts them onto their shoulder. The wrestler then pushes the opponent upwards, turns 180¬∞, and grabs hold of the falling enemy's throat, driving them down to the mat back first. = Inverted powerslam chokeslam = Like the vertical suplex chokeslam, but in this variant, the attacking wrestler puts the opponent in a powerbomb position and lifts them up in an inverted powerbomb. The wrestler moves their arm from around the opponent's neck, grabbing hold of their throat. The wrestler then slams the opponent down to the mat back first. = Leg trap chokeslam = Also known as a leg hook chokeslam, or the Sky High Chokeslam, as dubbed by Vader, the attacker starts out by lifting the opponent's left or right leg off the ground and tucks it under or hooks it over their arm while using their free hand to grab the opponent's neck. Then, the attacker lifts the opponent into the air and slams the opponent down to the mat. The move can also be used as a reversal from when the opponent tries some form of kick only to have the attacker catch and hold on to the leg, setting up the move from there. A sitting version and a kneeling version are also possible. = One-handed chokeslam = The Undertaker performing a one-handed chokeslam on Curt Hawkins A very common variation, usually performed by a larger wrestler to a smaller one, this move sees the usual execution of the chokeslam done with just one hand lifted from the throat without the support of the other hand that usually goes on the back. Big Show, Kane, and The Undertaker frequently perform this. Big Show invented the kneeling chokeslam during his time in WCW under the name The Giant from 1995-1999. = Reverse impact chokeslam = In this variation the attacking wrestler grabs the opponent's throat with one hand and grabs the opponent's abdomen with their free hand, then lifts the opponent over their head and slams the opponent similarly to a vertical suplex chokeslam. = Sitout chokeslam = This variation of a chokeslam is similar to an ordinary chokeslam, however, instead of the wrestler remaining standing, the wrestler falls into a seated position while forcing the opponent back-first into the mat. Damian Priest uses this move as his signature move, calling it south of Heaven. = Two-handed chokeslam = This move sees a wrestler first grasp an opponent's neck with both hands, then lift them up and choke them before throwing the opponent back down to the mat, usually after choking out the opponent. A falling version of this move can see the attacking wrestler fall forward to the mat while keeping their arms extended, but will more often see the wrestler fall into a seated position or a kneeling position. = Vertical suplex chokeslam = In this elevated chokeslam, innovated by Akira Taue, the wrestler applies a front facelock to the opponent and wraps their arm over the opponent's neck or body. The wrestler then lifts the opponent upside down, as in a vertical suplex. The wrestler moves their arm from around the opponent's neck, grabbing hold of their throat. The wrestler then slams the opponent down to the mat back first.

The distinction between \\"pinto\\" and \\"solid\\" can be tenuous, as so-called \\"solid\\" horses frequently have areas of white hair. Various cultures throughout history appear to have selectively bred for pinto patterns. Many breeds of horses carry pinto patterns. Pinto coloring, known simply as \\"coloured\\" in nations using British English, is the most popular in the United States. While pinto colored horses are not considered as a \\"breed,\\" several competing color breed registries have formed to encourage the breeding of pinto colored horses. The word \\"paint\\" is sometimes used to describe pinto horses but today, it is specifically used for the American Paint Horse; a pinto colored horse with identifiable American Quarter Horse or Thoroughbred bloodlines. Pinto patterns are visually and genetically distinct from the leopard complex spotting patterns characteristic of horse breeds such as the Appaloosa. Breeders who select for color are often careful not to cross the two patterns, and registries that include spotting color preferences often will refuse registration to horses that exhibit characteristics of the \\"wrong\\" pattern. Origins The word \\"pinto\\" is Spanish for 'painted', and also 'dappled' or 'spotted'. While pinto coloration has yet to be identified as a wildtype by DNA studies or seen in cave art predating horse domestication, images from pottery and other art of ancient antiquity show horses with flashy spotted patterns, indicating that they may have been desirable traits and selectively bred for. Images of spotted horses appear in the art of Ancient Egypt, and archaeologists have found evidence of horses with spotted coat patterns on the Russian steppes before the rise of the Roman Empire. Later, spotted horses were among those brought to the Americas by the Conquistadors. By the 17th century in Europe, spotted horses were quite fashionable, though when the fad ended, large numbers of newly-unsellable horses were shipped to the Americas, some of which were sold while others were simply turned loose to run wild.Bennett, Deb. Conquerors: The Roots of New World Horsemanship. Amigo Publications Inc; 1st edition 1998. . The color became popular, particularly among Native Americans, and was specifically bred for in the United States, which now has the greatest number of pinto horses in the world. Color patterns and genetics of pinto horses There are a number of words which describe the various color and spotting patterns of pinto horses. Essentially, a pinto horse is genetically created when an allele for a spotting pattern is present. The genes that create the underlying base coat color are not related to the genes that create white spotting. The precise mechanisms that create spotting are not all fully understood, but those that are known often have human parallels, such as piebaldism. What horse terminology describes as \\"pinto\\" or \\"coloured\\" has been called leucism or \\"partial albinism\\" by pigment researchers. Common terms for describing different types of pinto horses include: =Colors= *Piebald: (term more commonly used in nations using British English). Any pinto pattern on a black base coat, thus a black-and- white spotted horse. *Skewbald: (term more commonly used in nations using British English). Any pinto pattern on any base coat other than black. As chestnut and bay are the most common base coat colors, skewbalds are most often chestnut and white or bay and white. At one time, the term may have applied more specifically to brown-looking pinto horses, but today it encompasses any color other than black. *Coloured: The term for pinto coloration in nations using British English, including both piebald and skewbald. *Tricolored or Tricoloured: a term for horse with three colors (usually bay and white), in nations using British English. It is usually incorporated into the term skewbald. =Patterns= *Tobiano: The most common type of pinto, tobiano is a spotting pattern characterized by rounded markings with white legs and white across the back between the withers and the dock of the tail, usually arranged in a roughly vertical pattern and more white than dark, though the ideal is a 50-50 distribution, with the head usually dark, having markings also seen on a non-pinto horse. i.e. star, snip, strip, or blaze. Tobiano is a simple dominant trait caused by a single gene and therefore all tobiano horses have at least one tobiano parent. A DNA test exists for tobiano. Tobiano is not associated with any health concerns. *Overo: A collective term used primarily by the American Paint Horse Association (APHA), overo essentially means \\"pinto, but not tobiano.\\" It denotes patterns produced by at least three different genetic mechanisms: frame, splashed white or sabino, described below. These patterns are usually characterized by irregular markings with more jagged edges than tobiano markings. The white rarely crosses the back. While some currently-identified overo patterns appear to be dominant or incomplete dominant traits, overo- patterned foals (called \\"cropouts\\") are occasionally produced from two apparently solid-colored parents. **Frame or frame overo: Frame is a popular and easily recognized type of non-tobiano pinto. This spotting pattern, in the absence of genes for other patterns, is characterized by horizontally-oriented white patches with jagged, crisp edges. White patches typically include the head, face and lateral aspects of the neck and body, and the eyes can be blue. Frame overos may have very modest markings that are not obviously \\"pinto.\\" This quality allows the pattern to seemingly \\"hide\\" for generations, and is thought to be responsible for some cases of \\"cropouts.\\" Frame is an incomplete dominant trait for which there is a DNA test; those without any copies of the \\"frame gene\\" (N/N) will not possess this pattern, while those with a single copy (N/O) usually exhibit frame patterning (though sometimes in a very minimal form). However, foals born with two copies (O/O) have lethal white syndrome and die shortly after birth. N/O frame horses do not have any known health defects, but have a 25% chance of producing lethal white foals if bred to another N/O horse. **Splashed white: A less-common type of non-tobiano pinto pattern, splashed white coats have horizontally-oriented white markings with crisp, smooth edges and make the horse appear to have been dipped, head lowered, into white paint. The face has significant white markings, and the eyes are usually blue. Most splashed white pintos have normal hearing, but the trait is linked to congenital deafness. Some patterns identified as sabino in the USA may be splashed white. **Sabino: Sometimes confused with roan or rabicano, sabino horses possess a slight spotting pattern characterized by high white on legs, belly spots, and white markings on the face extending past the eyes. The edges of markings may be \\"lacy\\" or there can be patches of roaning patterns standing alone or on the edges of white markings. Some forms of the sabino phenotype are thought to be polygenic or a gene complex. However, one form for which there is a DNA test, the sabino-1 (SB1) gene, is a dominant. Horses homozygous for SB-1 sometimes are completely white. Sabino-1 and other sabino patterns are not associated with any health defects. Though genetically unrelated to frame or splash, sabino is classified with the \\"overo\\" family of patterns by the APHA. Sabino is not necessarily classified as an overo pattern by other breed registries, particularly those whose horses do not carry the genes for other pinto patterns. *Tovero: The tovero spotting pattern is a mix of tobiano and any form of overo coloration, usually reflecting that the horse carries more than one set of genes for a spotting pattern. For example, a tovero may have a mostly white tobiano pattern on the body, but also have blue eyes with or without a white head. Horses can carry multiple spotting genes at the same time, producing characteristics of several patterns. *Dominant white: A family of sabino-like white spotting patterns, all dominant white coats are dominantly inherited, analogous to human piebaldism. While some forms are associated with pure white coats and are considered \\"true white,\\" not pinto, most actually show great variance in the amount of white. There are now over 20 different alleles labeled \\"dominant white\\", all of which have occurred spontaneously in the past century from non- white parents. Many forms of white spotting that were called \\"sabino\\" by their owners and fanciers are now classified as dominant white. The distinction between sabino and dominant white is unclear, as they are visually similar and involve closely related genes. =Related terms= A \\"medicine hat\\" marking, dark ears on a white head *Chrome: an informal term of approval for appealing white markings on the horse, can be confusing, as it is also used to describe boldly-patterned Appaloosas *Solid: a horse that does not visibly express a pinto pattern. It may have white markings on the legs or face akin to those of non-pinto horses. Solid horses may carry one of the various pinto pattern genes. Some color breed registries accept solid horses as breeding stock, while others do not. *Breeding stock: a solid horse registered with one of the various registries that registers horses with pinto markings, such as the American Paint Horse Association (APHA), which registers these horses under a special designation of \\"Solid Paint Bred\\" (SPB). *Medicine hat: an uncommon pattern where the poll and ears are dark, surrounded completely by white, a true \\"medicine hat\\" pinto or paint usually has a predominantly white body, sometimes with dark coloration by the flanks, chest, and above the eyes *Shield: a large dark patch covering the chest, surrounded completely by white, usually on a predominantly white horse, sometimes associated with medicine hat patterning *Cropout: a horse with spotting which had two apparently solid-colored parents, typically within a breed whose standard does not allow pinto coloration \\"Paint\\" vs. \\"pinto\\" A pinto differs from a \\"Paint\\" solely by breeding. Horses with pinto coloring and verifiable pedigrees tracing to Quarter Horses or Thoroughbreds have been named the American Paint Horse, and are recorded in a separate registry, the American Paint Horse Association. While a pinto may be of any breed or combination of breeds, and some registries for pintos may have additional restrictions (some do not register draft horses or mules, for example), a horse that is registered as an American Paint Horse must have at least one parent recorded with the APHA and both parents must be only of registered American Quarter Horse, American Paint Horse, or Thoroughbred bloodlines. Therefore, most Paint horses may also be registered as pintos, but not all pintos are qualified to be registered as Paints. Thus, while it is always correct to refer to a horse with a non-leopard spot pattern as a pinto, a spotted horse should only be called a Paint if its ancestry is known or if it displays conformation that is clearly akin to that of an American Quarter Horse. A leopard spotted horse is usually called an Appaloosa, whether it is a registered Appaloosa or not. However, \\"paint\\" or \\"painted\\" was also an archaic word used by 19th century writers for assorted spotted horses bred by various Plains Indian tribes and thus is occasionally used in this context when describing all types of spotted Mustangs. Organizations Pinto (left), leopard-spotted Appaloosa (right) There are a number of color breed registries that encourage the breeding of pinto-colored horses, with varying registration requirements. On one hand, the Pinto Horse Association of America (PtHA) considers pinto horses recorded in their registry as a true breed and accepts solid-colored offspring of registered pinto parents as breeding stock, though with strict requirements for full registration. The less restrictive organizations allow registration of a horse of any breed or combination of breeds with as little as three square inches of white above the knees or hocks, not including facial markings. Some pinto registries do not accept animals with draft horse or mule breeding, though others do. None accept horses with the genetically distinct Appaloosa pattern, produced by genes in the leopard complex, and the Appaloosa registry in turn does not accept animals with pinto patterns. Controversies=Breed registries and white markings= Many breed registries do not, or at some point in the past did not, accept \\"cropout\\" horses with spots or \\"excess\\" white for registration, believing that such animals were likely to be crossbreds, or due to a fear of producing lethal white foals. This exclusion of offspring from pedigreed parents led to the formation not only of the American Paint Horse Association, but also other pinto registries as well. Among the breeds that excluded such horses were the Arabian horse and American Quarter Horse registries. However, modern DNA testing has revealed that some breeds do possess genes for spotting patterns, such as a non-SB-1 sabino pattern in Arabians, and sabino, overo, and tobiano in Quarter Horses. Therefore, these registries have modified their rules, allowing horses with extra white, if parentage is verified through DNA testing, to be registered. On the other hand, the Jockey Club's Thoroughbred registry still does not officially recognize pinto as a registerable color, though they do allow white body spots to be recorded under the category of markings. The Welsh Pony and Cob Society of the UK also does not accept \\"piebald\\" or \\"skewbald\\" horses for registration. =Lethal white syndrome= As noted in the description of patterns, above, the frame gene is associated with a condition called lethal white syndrome or \\"lethal white overo\\". However, of the overo family of patterns, only frame is associated with lethal white. Also, some horses that do not visually appear to be frame patterned still do carry the gene. However, if a foal is born homozygous for the gene, it dies shortly after birth. This gene can be detected by DNA testing, and breeders can now avoid breeding two carrier horses to one another.

Miller, with lights by Jeff Adelberg, costumes by Fabian Aguilar, fights & movement by Meron Langsner, and sound by Walter Eduardo. The cast consisted of Michelle Dowd as Nancy (who won an IRNE Award for Best Actress for the role), Peter Brown as Charlie, Claude Del as Leslie, and Emma Goodman as Sarah. The original second act is set entirely underwater. Overview Like many of Albee's plays, Seascape focuses on communication in interpersonal relationships, in this case between couples. Albee's first successful play, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962), and his first Pulitzer Prize-winning play, A Delicate Balance (1966), are also concerned with this topic. Seascape is different from these dramas on several counts. Seascape is not strictly a drama but, according to various critics, has elements of comedy, fantasy, satire and absurdism. In Seascape, Nancy and Charlie, an American couple on the verge of the major life change of retirement, are having problems in their relationship. They are discussing these matters on the beach when another couple appears, two human- sized lizards named Leslie and Sarah who speak and act like people. The lizards have evolved to such a degree that they no longer feel at home in the sea and are compelled to seek life on the land. What the lizards experience with Nancy and Charlie nearly drives them back to the sea, but with an offer of help from the human couple, they decide to stay. This relatively happy ending is not common in many of Albee's previous plays, and some critics find it refreshing. Before Albee won the Pulitzer Prize for drama for Seascape, however, many critics reacted negatively to the first production. Only a few had generally positive responses. One was Clive Barnes of The New York Times who writes, \\"What Mr. Albee has given us here is a play of great density, with many interesting emotional and intellectual reverberations.\\" The Nation's Harold Clurman places Seascape in a positive context in terms of Albee's development as a playwright. He believes, \\"It is his most relaxed play, a 'philosophical' whimsy.\\" The nod to absurdism is not only found in having half the cast being human/lizards but also in a few staging elements. For example, several times throughout the play a jet flies above, and each time Nancy and Charlie repeat the same dialog for two or three lines.  Summary =Act I= Seascape opens on a beach. An older couple, Nancy and Charlie, has finished a picnic lunch. As Nancy cleans up, the noise of a jet flying low engulfs the stage. Charlie predicts that a jet will someday smash into a dune. Nancy expresses her desire to be near the water forever. She loves everything about it and would like to travel from beach to beach. Charlie responds negatively to her dreams. He does not want to do anything or go anywhere. Charlie's attitude angers Nancy. She points out that life is short. She threatens to have adventures on her own. Charlie's attitude changes after Nancy's outburst, and she retreats from her plan a bit. She is content to enjoy the moment. After another jet passes by, Nancy reminds Charlie about his childhood desire to live under the water. Charlie tells her how he would sink to the bottom of a pool or lake and sit there until he had to breathe. Nancy encourages him to do this again and get in touch with his youth. Charlie refuses, embarrassed by her insistence. Nancy changes the subject to their sex life. She tells him about a time in their marriage when she thought of divorcing him. There was tension, and she suspected that he was having an affair. Charlie denies this, and Nancy accepts his word. Nancy encourages him to sink under the water again and to show her how he did it. Charlie again refuses and turns the conversation to her. He tells her that she was a good wife. Nancy says the same about him, listing the many ways in which he was a good husband. When she is done, she is bitter because the \\"good life\\" they have had seems limited to her. Charlie is hurt by her attitude. They argue. Nancy is still angry that his only interest is to rest, while she wants to experience new things. During a pause at the end of their heated argument, Leslie, a human-sized male lizard, takes a peek at them. Nancy tries to get Charlie to help write postcards, but he declines. Leslie peeks at them again, this time with his female mate, Sarah. Nancy sees the lizards and is intrigued. Charlie is afraid. Charlie demands that Nancy find him something to defend them with. When she can only find a small, thin stick, Charlie is peeved. Nancy remains interested in the lizards, but when Leslie clears his throat, she fears the lizards might hurt them. When Leslie waves his large stick, Nancy and Charlie admit their love for each other, Nancy more reluctantly than Charlie. As Leslie and Sarah move forward, another jet flies by and scares them away. Charlie tries to blame the whole episode on bad liver paste sandwiches. He believes they are dead from food poisoning. Nancy ridicules the idea. Nancy is pleased when Leslie and Sarah return. To protect themselves, Nancy believes they should show submission by lying on their backs with their legs and arms up, as a dog would. Charlie assumes the position, though with great reluctance. = Act II = Act II opens where act I ended. Leslie and Sarah are unsure about Nancy and Charlie's submissive stance. When Leslie and Sarah approach, Charlie threatens to scream. Nancy is much calmer. Leslie pokes Charlie and Nancy in the side, but neither one moves. Leslie and Sarah decide that Nancy and Charlie are relatively harmless. Charlie is unsure about the creatures, while Nancy is fascinated by everything about them. Leslie and Sarah decide to approach them again. Leslie pokes Charlie hard, causing Charlie to speak. Leslie replies several times, but Charlie will not speak to the creature. Nancy finally sits up and greets Sarah. Charlie only says hello after Nancy encourages him. Sarah and Nancy believe that the tension has been defused, but Leslie and Charlie are still uncertain of each other. With Nancy's prodding, Charlie assures Leslie that they are not unfriendly. Though Leslie and Sarah speak English, they do not understand many of the words and ideas that Charlie and Nancy use. Nancy tries to shake Leslie's flipper, but Leslie cannot grasp the concept. Nancy and Charlie explain the concept of the handshake, as well as their differing anatomy. The lizards have only legs and flippers. Nancy finally shakes hands with the lizards. Charlie tries to shake hands with Leslie, but Leslie is still uncertain about him. Leslie and Charlie talk about their differences. Leslie asks about their clothing. Among other things, Nancy tells them that clothes cover their sexual organs. This leads to a discussion of the humans' sex organs, especially Nancy's breasts. The lizards do not have these organs. Nancy shows Sarah, who is fascinated. Leslie also wants to see, but Charlie is uncomfortable with the idea. To change the subject, Charlie asks about their children. Sarah and Leslie have produced seven thousand eggs. Leslie is appalled when he learns that the humans do not lay eggs. Nancy explains human gestation and that they have three children. When Nancy tells them that they keep their children for many years, she also explains the concept of love. This and all other emotions are foreign concepts to the lizards. Charlie asks how Sarah and Leslie became paired. Leslie fought off other lizards when Sarah reached her maturity and started to mate. He wanted her, but emotions did not play a role. Charlie brings up the idea of disloyalty in Leslie and Sarah's relationship. This upsets Nancy. The issue also confuses Sarah and Leslie. Charlie is nearly attacked by Leslie when he angrily compares the male lizard to a fish. The women calm the men down and Leslie explains his disdainful attitude toward fish. They discuss the ideas of prejudice and difference. Sarah looks up and sees birds flying by. Leslie becomes defensive. Nancy explains to Sarah that the birds are seagulls. The females compare them to underwater rays. Nancy tells Sarah that she has seen photographs of rays. Nancy and Charlie cannot explain what photography is to her, so Sarah believes they are insulting her. When Leslie returns, Sarah explains what has happened. Abruptly changing the subject, Nancy declares that Charlie believes that they are dead. She continues to dig into Charlie, sarcastically saying that no wonders are possible. Leslie and Sarah catch on to her meaning, to some degree, but Leslie is confused by the idea that reality is an illusion. When Leslie asks Charlie to explain it, Charlie becomes angry. After Nancy calms him down, another jet flies by. Leslie and Sarah are fearful. Nancy and Charlie explain the idea of the airplane. Charlie talks about other machines including those that go undersea. Nancy tells the lizards about the times in Charlie's youth when he would sink under water and stay there. Angry at Nancy, Charlie changes the subject and asks the lizards why they came out of the sea in the first place. They do not know, other than they have changed somehow and do not belong there anymore. This prompts Charlie to explain the idea of evolution, but Leslie and Sarah do not understand it fully. The lizards can only think in terms of themselves. When Sarah asks if progress is good, Charlie is uncertain. Every term and idea has to be explained to the lizards, leading to more frustration for Charlie, as well as Leslie and Sarah. Charlie asks Sarah what she would do if Leslie went away and did not come back. Nancy becomes angry at him for asking. Sarah is upset by the question and wants to go back to the sea. Leslie hits and chokes Charlie for making Sarah cry. Leslie and Sarah decide to go back. Nancy tells them to stay because eventually they will have to come back. Nancy, and to some degree Charlie, offer their help. Leslie accepts their offer. Character Analysis=Charlie= Charlie is married to Nancy and is part of the human couple at the center of the play. Unlike his wife, Charlie is fearful and passive. While Nancy wants to have an active retirement, Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. He does not understand his wife's need to connect with the past and explore the world they have not seen. Charlie admits to having a more adventurous spirit in his youth. He would release his breath and sink to the bottom of pools or other bodies of water until he had to rise to breathe again. Charlie liked to do this then but has no desire to do it now. He is content with the way things currently are in his life and does not like to be challenged. It is Nancy who first antagonizes him. Nancy's idea about living at different beaches for the rest of their lives is distasteful to him. He will not let her push him into even considering such a lifestyle. Nancy later tells him, much to his surprise, that she considered divorcing him a long time ago because she believed he was having an affair. Charlie tells her he did not have such a liaison, and she believes him. Charlie was happy with the way his life with Nancy was and still is. Their disagreements over this matter are overshadowed by the appearance of the lizards. If Charlie is uncomfortable with Nancy and her desires, he has bigger problems with the lizards. At first, he insists that they are a death hallucination caused by rotten liver paste sandwiches. While the creatures intrigue Nancy, Charlie continually acts with fear and resistance. He follows his wife's lead on posing submissively when the creatures first approach, but he will not respond to them until she orders him to. Even after the ice has been broken, Charlie remains uncertain about the creatures and their intentions. Leslie and Sarah's ignorance on many things (emotions, anatomy, etc.) adds to Charlie's negative attitude. When he has to explain these ideas to them, he is easily frustrated and often condescending. He drives Leslie to beat and choke him. Yet at the end, Charlie agrees with Nancy that the lizards have to stay on land and not go back into the water. Though he helps because Nancy will do it whether or not he agrees, Charlie does offer to take them by the hand. =Nancy= Nancy is the female half of the human couple in the play; she is married to Charlie. Unlike her husband, Nancy is vibrant and curious about the world. When the play opens, she wants to live at the beach forever. Now that her children are grown, Nancy wants to have adventures. Charlie does not share her desires and does his best to discourage them. Despite Charlie's negative attitude, Nancy remains open to what comes her way, including the lizards. Nancy's relationship with Charlie is somewhat strained. Nancy is angry at Charlie's passivity. Her attempts to encourage Charlie to sink underwater as he did as a child meet with a negative response. This frustrates her. Over the course of the first act, it is revealed that she once considered divorcing him because she believed that he was having an affair. Though she readily accepts his word when he says he did not, she does not think the \\"good life\\" they had together has been all that it could be. Still, Nancy remains loyal to Charlie. While she threatens to have adventures on her own, she does nothing about it. When the lizards approach them, Nancy is fascinated but a little afraid. She remains close to Charlie. Though she does not agree with him, she does find him a small stick to use as a defense. It is Nancy who comes up with the idea of lying down in a submissive posture when Leslie and Sarah come near. Charlie follows Nancy's directions in most of the dealings with the lizards. After it becomes clear that the lizards will not harm them, Nancy is excited by their presence. She does everything she can to learn about them and make a connection with them. She wants to shake hands with them first. Charlie is uncomfortable with the lengths to which his wife goes to connect with the lizards. Because Sarah has never seen a mammal's mammaries, Nancy shows Sarah her breasts and explains their function. Nancy would also have shown Leslie except for Charlie's protestations. While Nancy does become a bit frustrated with the lizards' intellectual limitations, she becomes increasingly annoyed with Charlie's condescending attitude toward them. Yet, when the lizards want to go back‚Äîafter Charlie drives Sarah to tears, and Leslie beats him up‚ÄîNancy wants them to stay and offers them help. This experience has given Nancy the excitement she craves, and she ensures that it continues. =Leslie= Leslie is the male lizard who appears at the end of act I. Like Charlie, Leslie is a bit more fearful, defensive, and mistrusting than his mate. It is he who first watches the human couple. Leslie is also the first to approach Nancy and Charlie, poking them in the side. When Charlie does not reply right away, Leslie becomes frustrated. While Leslie's guard remains high, especially around Charlie, for most of the play, he is also curious, much more so than his human male counterpart. Both Leslie and Sarah speak English, though they do not understand many words and concepts of human life. Leslie does not know what emotions are, what cooking or clothing is, or what the names of limbs are. When Nancy tries to shake hands with him, he is completely unfamiliar with and mistrustful of the process. Though Leslie wants to understand for the most part, he becomes impatient when the humans cannot easily explain complex things like love or consciousness. Though Leslie does not possess or understand some human ideas like love, he does have prejudices against others. Charlie tries and fails to explain what bigotry is to the lizard after Leslie speaks badly of fish. Leslie thinks they are dirty and too numerous. He also looks down on humans because they do not lay eggs. Yet Leslie also has some empathy for the humans. Leslie knows that he and Sarah must look odd to Charlie and Nancy. He also understands that Charlie is being difficult when Nancy mentions that her husband thinks they are dead and that this situation is some sort of hallucination. Leslie acts most often on instinct, like an animal. When birds and jets fly overhead, he runs to find an escape route. Leslie is very protective of Sarah. When Charlie hurts Sarah‚Äîasking her what she would do if Leslie left and never came back‚ÄîLeslie attacks him. After hitting him, Leslie nearly chokes him until the females intercede. After the incident, Leslie decides that he and Sarah will go back into the sea, to escape this threat. When Nancy tells him that they will have to come back eventually and offers them help, it is Leslie who accepts this fate. =Sarah= Sarah is the female half of the lizard couple, the mate of Leslie. Like her mate, Sarah is cautious and fearful around the humans. Yet like Nancy, she is curious about them and tries to make a connection. Though Sarah defers to Leslie much more than Nancy does to Charlie, she does play a buffer role between the couples. Leslie often consults Sarah on what he should do and what she thinks about the humans and the situation at hand. At first, Sarah urges wanness, but she also emphasizes the importance of contact. Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, she does assert herself to Leslie when an experience is important. For example, she insists on accompanying Leslie when he approaches the humans in act II after they have taken their submissive pose. Sarah wants to see everything for herself. Most of the new things she encounters intrigue her: the handshakes; Nancy's breasts; human gestation; and the birds flying above them, among other things. But she is also fearful. The jets frighten her, as does Charlie when he asks her what she would do if Leslie went away and never came back. Like Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries. Sarah is also more open to explaining their way of life to the humans than her husband is. Leslie tries to curb her, but Sarah says what she believes she should say. Sarah does not fully share Leslie's prejudices and tries to make the humans understand her. For example, Sarah shares information on their reproduction and how she and Leslie met. It is also Sarah who tells the humans why they decided to come out of the sea. Leslie is reluctant to part with this information. After Charlie asks a question that makes her cry, Sarah wants to go back into the sea. Leslie agrees with her. Later, Sarah intercedes when Leslie tries to beat up Charlie over it. Though Sarah wants to return to their home, Leslie decides, with Nancy's help, to stay. Themes=Communication and Understanding= At the thematic center of Seascape are issues related to communication and understanding. Though all of the characters speak English, when each of the four tries to communicate with the others, only varied success is achieved. The theme of communication takes on several forms in the play. First, there is the communication between each member of a couple with their respective mate. Nancy tries to engage her husband, Charlie, in a mutually beneficial discussion about her needs and their future, but he derides her ideas. Nancy wants to explore and be adventurous in their retirement, while Charlie wants to rest and do nothing. Throughout the play, their inability to communicate and understand each other's wants and needs creates tension and hostility. Leslie and Sarah have fewer problems communicating. Leslie is dominant in their relationship, and Sarah is generally content to play a subservient role. Leslie consults Sarah on most decisions and generally respects her input. Sarah speaks up when she feels Leslie is acting inappropriately, and Leslie usually listens. The other significant form of communication is between the two couples and is different between the genders. Nancy is very curious about and open with the lizards. Though she does become slightly frustrated by their limitations, she tries to help them by explaining aspects of human life they do not understand. Her general kindness toward them and offer of help when the lizards are deciding whether to stay on land or to go back to the sea influences their decision. Charlie is less forthcoming and more suspicious. He has a hard time accepting the lizards and quickly becomes testy when they do not understand his explanations. The lizards' communication is somewhat similar to their human counterparts. Like Nancy, Sarah is more open to the humans and more interested in their world. She is also emotional, and when Charlie asks her a question that is hard for her to understand (what she would do if Leslie disappeared), she becomes distraught, leading to a confrontation. Leslie shares Charlie's attitude; he does not trust the humans and regards most everything they say with skepticism. Despite these problems, at the end of the play, some measure of trust is reached between all of them. Leslie decides that he and Sarah will stay on land when Nancy and Charlie, albeit reluctantly, offer to help them. = Evolution and Progress = Another prominent theme in Seascape is that of evolution and progress. This theme manifests itself in several ways in the play. One is subtle. The relationship of Nancy and Charlie is in the process of evolution. They are on the verge of a major life change, retirement. Charlie would like to use this time to rest and do nothing. Nancy sees this desire as regression rather than evolution. Her family responsibilities fulfilled, Nancy wants to explore the world, perhaps moving from beach to beach, meeting new people and having new experiences. The couple's relationship will change, and Nancy tries to move it forward. Charlie wants things to stay the same. Evolution has a different meaning in terms of the lizards. Leslie and Sarah are literally evolving. They were creatures that lived in the sea but apparently developed beyond their species. They were compelled to move to the land, though they do not really understand why. Though Leslie and Sarah are somewhat fearful of the change, they do accept the help that Nancy, enthusiastically, and Charlie, reluctantly, give them. At the end of the play, rather than go back into the sea where they might feel safer, they remain on land. = Alienation = A more subtle undercurrent in Seascape is the idea of alienation. In terms of this play, to be alienated means to feel withdrawn or exist in an unfriendly environment. Alienation was one of the reasons that Leslie and Sarah left the sea. In act II, Sarah tells the humans, \\"It wasn't ... comfortable anymore. I mean after all, you make your nest, and accept a whole ... array ... of things ... and ... we didn' t feel we belonged there anymore.\\" It could be argued that this alienation was a step in their evolution. Nancy and, to some degree, Charlie also feel alienated in their lives. In act I, Nancy describes several ways in which she feels alienated, mostly in her relationship with Charlie. She does not share his views on what their life was, is, and could be; she wants to do more than retire. Though not as vocal, Charlie, in turn, feels alienated from her because of her curiosity and her desires. The strains caused by alienation affect the direction of the characters and the action of the play. Style=Setting= Seascape is set on a beach in a time contemporary with the writing of the play. Though it is unstated in the text, several critics have assumed that the action takes place somewhere on the east coast of the United States. All of the play is confined to one afternoon. This physical setting emphasizes the transitional state of the characters' lives. It is one of many symbols in the play. =Fantasy= There is critical debate over exactly what genre of play Seascape is. Some believe it is a comedy, while others see it as absurdist, satirical, or allegorical. Most agree that an element of fantasy is involved. While Nancy and Charlie are humans and act accordingly, Leslie and Sarah are fantastic creations. They are human-sized lizards that have left their life in the sea to live on land. They speak perfect English and understand some aspects of human life. Charlie has a hard time accepting that they are real. He wants to believe that he and Nancy see them because they are suffering from food poisoning or are dead. In terms of the play Leslie and Sarah are very real, a fact that Nancy immediately grasps and embraces. The fantasy aspect of the play creates dramatic irony and allows issues such as progress, values, and differences to be discussed. =Symbolism= Many symbols are employed by Albee to underscore the action and themes of Seascape. The most obvious symbols are the lizard characters, Leslie and Sarah. Because these are anthropomorphic creatures (that is, animals with human qualities), they can be used to illustrate Albee's ideas about humans and their relationships. Leslie and Sarah represent many things, including a literal depiction of evolution and progress and an ideal of a relationship that works in stark contrast to Nancy and Charlie's relationship. The setting is symbolic. The beach‚Äîwhere land and sea meet‚Äîrepresents a place of transition. In earth's distant history creatures emerged from the sea to live on land, as Leslie and Sarah do in the course of the play. Changes for all four characters are taking place at the beach. Another symbol is the jet planes that zoom overhead. The jets are a mixed symbol. They are described to Sarah as the mechanical evolution of the seagulls that fascinate her. Yet Charlie worries that a jet will one day crash into the dune‚Äîa temporary if not symbolic end to evolution. The jets also scare both Sarah and Leslie. But the jets continue to fly and never crash, and the lizards decide to embrace their own evolution. Though feared by everyone but Nancy in Seascape, positive change holds as a symbolic theme of the play.

The film, shot on location and in a semi-documentary style, is about diamond smugglers who unknowingly start a smallpox outbreak in the New York City of 1947. It is based on the real threat of a smallpox epidemic in the city, as described in a story taken from a 1948 Cosmopolitan magazine article.\\"The Killer That Stalked New York,\\" Turner Classic Movies Film Article by Jeff Stafford Plot Arriving at New York City's Pennsylvania Station after a trip to Cuba, Sheila Bennet (Evelyn Keyes), who is smuggling $50,000 worth of diamonds into the country, realizes she's being followed by the authorities. She mails the diamonds to her husband, Matt Krane (Charles Korvin), instead of carrying them around, and then tries to shake the Treasury agent following her. Feeling sick, Sheila nearly faints on the street, so a cop takes her to a local clinic. While there, she encounters a little girl and inadvertently infects her. Sheila is misdiagnosed as having a common cold, and she leaves and returns home. After the girl is admitted to the hospital, she is found to have smallpox. Meanwhile, Matt has been cheating on Sheila with her sister, Francie (Lola Albright), and then attempts to take off without either of them when the diamonds finally arrive through the mail. Unfortunately for him, the fence cannot buy the diamonds because they are too hot. Matt will have to wait for ten days for the cash, so he cannot leave New York. Sheila confronts Francie, who kills herself afterward due to Matt's betrayal of them both. This gives Sheila more reason to get revenge on him. Finding a growing number of smallpox victims, city officials decide to vaccinate everyone in New York to prevent an epidemic, but quickly run out of serum. This causes a panic in the city. Tracking the victims, agents realize that the disease carrier and the diamond smuggler are one and the same. However, an increasingly sick Sheila continues to elude capture. Still unaware that she has smallpox, she returns to the doctor at the clinic to get more medicine. The doctor explains her illness and tries to talk her into turning herself in, but she shoots him in the shoulder and escapes. Sheila eventually catches up with Matt, who tries to escape from the police, but falls from a building ledge to his death. Sheila nearly attempts to drop herself from the ledge, until the doctor tells her the little girl she met had died. Remorseful, Sheila turns herself in and, before succumbing to the disease, provides authorities with a badly needed list of those she contacted.

Evelyn Keyes, as the fugitive smallpox carrier, manifests great discomfort and distress, but she is no more than a melodramatic cipher in a loosely organized \\"chase.\\" William Bishop is blankly youthful as the physician and Charles Korvin is conventional as the lady's no-good husband who tries to give her the brush.

Accessed: June 30, 2013. Film critic Dennis Schwartz gave the film a mixed review as well and wrote, \\"There's not much in the way of thrills or surprises in this minor film noir ... The action part of the melodramatic story was weakly told, while the noir characterizations of Sheila did capture the desperate feelings of the subject but it was not enough to overcome the overall inability of the story to have a heart to it. The city officials and Dr. Wood running around the city to stem the epidemic, seemed hard to fathom. The mechanical acting by everyone, except for Keyes, and the unconvincing action scenes made the film appear as the B film it was, despite the great noir camerawork of Joseph Biroc who caught how dark the city could be for someone on-the-run.\\"Schwartz.

He thought, ‚ÄòWell, if I‚Äôm going to take a chance, that‚Äôs enough.'\\"  Personal life  Dawn was married to the adult film star John \\"The Wadd\\" Holmes from January 23, 1987, until his death on March 13, 1988, during which time he was stepfather to her young son. According to Dawn, they first met in December 1982 on the set of a film they were working on together in San Francisco, entitled Marathon. (Mike Sager reports the 19-year-old first met Holmes on the set of Fleshpond, though they didn't work together on that film.) They remained close, and in 1987, five years after Holmes was arrested then released from jail in connection with the Wonderland Murders, they married in Las Vegas, at the Little Chapel of the Flowers, after Holmes had confided to her that he had AIDS. The wedding, at which Laurie wore white, was an ordeal for John who was ill, knew he was dying, and realized he and Laurie would not have much of a life together. \\"John kept the marriage secret,\\" Dawn says, \\"because he was a very private person. Thus, when he died, many acquaintances in the industry and journalists reporting on his death were surprised to learn that we were married.\\" ReferencesExternal links  Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Actresses from Albuquerque, New Mexico Category:American pornographic film actresses Category:Pornographic film actors from New Mexico ","title":"Misty Dawn"},{"id":"2300439","text":"Venice 13, abbreviated as V13 or VX3, is a Mexican American street gang based in the Oakwood (aka \\"Ghost Town\\") neighborhood of Venice, a section of Los Angeles, California. It has a substantial presence in East Venice as well as the Culver City/Los Angeles border, especially around Washington Blvd. The gang dates back to the 1960s, and has long been known as one of the most dangerous street gangs on the Los Angeles Westside. It was amongst the first Mexican gangs to fight gang wars against African-American gangs, especially the local Venice Shoreline Crips which were founded in the mid-1970s. It is affiliated with the Sure√±os and the Mexican Mafia. History After the 405 freeway tore through predominantly Mexican American and immigrant communities in the late 1950s and early 1960s, many migrated west into the Oakwood area of Venice Beach. Originally the Oakwood area was labeled as a \\"servant's zone\\" and was one of the only areas where African Americans could live on the Westside of Los Angeles. During this time Venice had been notoriously known as the \\"ghetto by the sea\\" due to the City of Los Angeles' negligent attitude toward the area, and as a result Oakwood's cheap housing prices which attracted young counterculture artists, poor European immigrants, and maintained an already working-class African American population made it relatively easy for Mexicans to settle in. It was in this extreme poverty that the Venice 13 gang formed, becoming one of the earliest gangs in the city. Throughout the 1960s the gang grew rapidly and Venice gang members began playing an active role in the California prison system through Mexican Mafia membership, while on the streets the gang viciously battled with Culver City 13 creating a rivalry spanning over 50 years and still running. By this time the area was overrun with drugs and times changed, with V13 taking control of the drug trade as unemployment and racial tensions escalated, further fueling gang membership. Gang members found income supplying drugs to the hippies, and eventually high-income residents who came to Oakwood from affluent areas as crack cocaine arrived. In the 1990s Oakwood exploded when a war broke out between Venice 13, the Venice Shoreline Crips (VSLC) and the Culver City gang. As ordered by the Mexican Mafia, Venice 13 was to maintain control of Oakwood's drug trade and eventually a peace treaty formed between Venice 13 and the Crips. The 1980s and 1990s brought on a series of revitalization as white homeowners began purchasing property and renovating old houses, causing the City of Los Angeles to combat the gang problem although V13 still remains active. Cliques Venice 13 is made up of a series of cliques, or subsets within the gang. Dukes (DKS) Mainly active in the '80s and early '90s, the set is composed of older members. Duke members often wear clothes with the Duke University Blue Devil or blue Detroit Tigers caps. Lil Jokers(LJKS L'Js) was a large clique from V13 and are still active. Gangsters (G'S, GEES) are a large clique. Made up of some older members, the set has seen a rapid increase in membership and activity as more and more youngsters have grown and earned membership, replacing many past members who were specifically targeted by injunctions. The GEES look up to the Dukes clique because of their well-known gang activity \\"back in the day\\". Malos (MLS) Mainly active east of Lincoln Blvd., the division between Oakwood and the rest of Venice, and East Venice. Lil Locos (LLS')and the Big Locos(L' S), cliques that function within Oakwood as well as around the outskirts of Venice by displaced members. Mentioned in the original script for the movie American History X. They also have an asesinos[ASNS] clique and the Jokers[JKS]clique Injunctions The Venice gang has also been the target of West Side gang injunctions in the 1990s along with Culver City 13, and the Venice Shoreline Crips. Rivalry Venice 13's main rivals were the Santa Monica 13 and Santa Monica 17th St gangs, however they both settled a truce and formed an alliance. As well as 18th Street gang (particularly the 106th St Inglewood). Historically, the main rivals of the gang have long been Venice Shoreline Crips in nearby Mar Vista and Culver City. Shoreline Crips Venice 13 was involved in an intense battle with the Venice Shoreline Crips during the 1990s. The conflict escalated and in one point in time Venice 13 and the Culver City gang went as far as to set aside their own fight to unite against the Shorelines. In 1994 Venice 13 and the Shorelines bargained for a cease fire, after a war that left 55 people dead and many more wounded. Notoriety Although the gang has been known to be relatively laid back and often members prefer not to exert themselves, they have gained notoriety for violent and often very reckless retaliation attacks. The gang is also involved in large scale narcotics trafficking business along the Oakwood and boardwalk areas, a prime market for selling to high income residents who come from surrounding affluent areas. Venice 13 has also been known to viciously defend their turf from outside drug trafficking and trespassing, with violators being killed or at least shot at. Aside from the war with the Shorelines, V13 has also gained infamy as being the most violent rival of the Culver City gang. The gang has been known to publicly take credit for the murders of rivals by marking the neighborhood with \\"VX3,\\" \\"V13\\" and \\"Venice 13\\" taggings. In one incident \\"V13s invaded the hospital in search of a Culver City enemy they hadn't quite managed to kill. It was necessary to give the patient a fictitious name and change all the labels on the census boards, chart backs, etc,\\" as described by a nurse. On November 7, 2007 members of the Venice 13 gang fired shots, from a vehicle leaving Venice High School, at alleged rival Culver City members who were standing outside the SHOP-4 building at approximately 2:58 pm. The incident began with an argument until it turned to gunfire. The argument is said to have start with gang identification. After the first victim, Carlos, was aware of the situation he was shot at leaving 3 holes on his sleeve with one bullet. He then tried running into other classes were teachers refused to keep him there. The two other victims are unknown. The school was put on lockdown and police were dispatched for extra security for a couple days until threat was minimized. Carlos and the other victims have disappeared only with rumors from friends of moving to Mexico. Gentrification In 1994, due to the stigma of the neighborhood's reputation as \\"Los Angeles at its worst\\" many investors were deterred from the area. With gentrification transforming the formerly more downscale sections of the West Side, many of its rivals are either near- defunct or in severe decline. With housing prices starting in the $500,000 and escalating into the millions from there, Venice 13 struggled to maintain the same presence it used to have in its neighborhood during the 1990s. While Oakwood was at one point a very inexpensive area to buy property, it is being sought after by wealthy artists and businessmen at competitive prices. Famous movie stars such as actresses Julia Roberts and Anjelica Huston, and actor Nicolas Cage have taken residency in or around the Oakwood area. According to a Venice gang member, some Venice 13 members have even been forced into nearby Inglewood due to rent and housing costs. The affiliate, with plenty of animosity for the mostly, non-Hispanic white professional newcomers, stated that new home owners in the area at sometimes fail to even notice Oakwood as a gang neighborhood. This gentrification has been the cause of rising racial tension between the original African American and Latino residents and the more affluent newcomers. The inconsistent pattern of gang violence in Oakwood has also scared many high income residents who are not accustomed to the neighborhood, such as a 2001 string of violent shootings which resulted in 3 murders in a two-week period. Months following the incidents residents reported the streets being empty at sundown despite increased police presence. In the November 2004 issue of Vanity Fair magazine author John Brodie contested that gentrification would fail as \\"...the gunplay of the Shoreline Crips and the V-13 is as much a part of life in Venice as pit bulls playing with blond Labs at the local dog park.\\".

Show control is the use of automation technology to link together and operate multiple entertainment control systems in a coordinated manner. It is distinguished from an entertainment control system, which is specific to a single theatrical department, system or effect, one which coordinates elements within a single entertainment discipline such as lighting, sound, video, rigging or pyrotechnics. A typical entertainment control system would be lighting control. An example of show control would be linking a video segment with a number of lighting cues, or having a sound track trigger animatronic movements -- or all of these combined. Shows with or without live actors can almost invariably incorporate entertainment control technology and usually benefit from show control to operate these subsystems independently, simultaneously, or in rapid succession. Show Control Networks Show control networks have largely supplanted older show control typologies. This is primarily due to the maturation of the larger information technology (IT) computing industry, which, due to its scale and dominance, has produced standards, equipment and software which is less expensive than older show control equipment and methodologies and increasingly more reliable and usable in entertainment applications. Modern systems are increasingly based upon Ethernet networking. Most manufacturers of entertainment control equipment now include Ethernet ports on their equipment. Ethernet was originally disqualified from consideration for show control because it was slow, non-deterministic, and lacked sufficient bandwidth to handle certain show control functions. These early objections have been overcome with the use of full-duplex switched Ethernet running at 1000BASE-T speeds on a dedicated local area network (LAN).  MIDI Show Control  The MIDI Show Control (MSC) standard is an open, industry-wide international communications protocol through which all types of show devices can communicate. MIDI generally is a simplex asynchronous serial data transmission standard with the circuit being an opto-isolated current loop type. MIDI, an acronym for Musical Instrument Digital Interface, was originally designed in the early 1980s as a means of controlling multiple keyboard synthesizers from different manufacturers. Beginning in 1989, a group of interested theatre professionals headed by Charlie Richmond of Richmond Sound Design in Vancouver British Columbia began discussions on the USITT MIDI Forum Callboard Network. This forum included developers and designers from the theatre sound and lighting industry from around the world. They created the MSC standard between January and September, 1990.http://www.richmondsounddesign.com/pdf/MSC.pdf It was ratified by the MIDI Manufacturers Association (MMA) in January, 1991, and the Japan MIDI Standards Committee (JMSC) later that year, as an extension of the standard MIDI specification. It became an accepted standard in August, 1991. The first show to fully utilize the MSC specification was the Magic Kingdom Parade at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom in September, 1991. DMX512 USITT DMX512-A is the current de facto standard for lighting control systems. It is an asynchronous serial data transmission standard commonly found as a control scheme between computerized lighting consoles and connected dimmers, moving light fixtures, color changers including LED fixtures, and certain effects (fog, strobes) which are usually operated by the electrical (lighting) department in theatres. DMX512 was originally launched by USITT in 1986. It was updated in 1990 to USITT DMX512/1990. In 1998, the maintenance of the standard was transferred to the Entertainment Services and Technology Association (ESTA). ESTA revised it, and it was accepted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in November 2004 as \\"Entertainment Technology‚ÄîUSITT DMX512-A‚ÄîAsynchronous Serial Digital Data Transmission Standard for Controlling Lighting Equipment and Accessories\\". In 2011, ESTA merged with the Professional Lighting and Sound Association (PLASA), which now manages the standard.http://www.plasa.org/standards/ The standard is now called \\"E1.11 ‚Äì 2008, USITT DMX512-A\\".http://tsp.esta.org/tsp/documents/docs/E1-27-1_2006R2016.pdf At one time, DMX was put forth as a possible show control standard, mainly by the manufacturers of lighting control consoles, but this idea was never widely adopted, due to the speed and network traffic limitations of DMX for show control applications. Dante, CobraNet and others Audio systems have also benefited from digital networking technology. Dante (Digital Audio Network Through Ethernet) is one of the most technically advanced means of routing high quality audio over an Ethernet network. It is a proprietary audio over Ethernet scheme using layer 3 packets to distribute uncompressed, multi- channel, low-latency digital audio in professional installations. Dante was developed by Audinate of Australia in 2006, and has since been licensed to a number of hardware manufacturers worldwide. It requires a combination of hardware and software to operate.https://web.archive.org/web/20090915233935/http://www.av.net.au/contents/issue_6/audinate_dante.pdf Similar layer 3 products are RAVENNA (an open standard developed by ALC NetworX GmbH., Germany), Livewire by Axia Audio (a division of Telos Systems), Q-LAN by QSC Audio Products and WheatNet-IP by Wheatstone, most of them interoperable by conforming to AES67. CobraNet, although an older proprietary standard dating from 1996, still enjoys a large base of installations.https://dealer- center.ru/docs/C12_DC_IRIS_Training_CobraNet%20vs%20Dante_v01.1_E.pdf It is regarded as the first commercially successful implementation of networked digital audio. It utilizes layer 2 packets to distribute uncompressed multi- channel digital audio in professional installations. Its first theme park use was to distribute background music (BGM) in Disney's Animal Kingdom park. It also requires a combination of hardware and software to operate, and has been licensed to multiple manufacturers. Interest in transferring audio over Ethernet arose about the same time the audio industry was making increasing use of digital signal processing (DSP). Sound engineers had been altering audio through various analog means for many years, but with the advent of fast, low-latency digital chips, audio signal processing moved rapidly into the digital domain. Time code Some types of attractions operated by show control are nearly completely based upon clock-driven timing. These are most commonly found in theme parks in semi-automated attractions which are repetitious and not usually subject to variation. Certain ride systems, once manually started or dispatched, may run entirely on time code nowadays. Certain shows, such as 4-D film presentations, are also good candidates for this type of control. An example of the former is Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts at Universal Studios Florida and of the latter, Pirates 4-D at Thorpe Park. SMPTE time code dates back to 1969, when the film and video tape timing standard proposed by the Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) was accepted by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). SMPTE time code, usually a variant called LTC (linear time code), is an analog recording of a bi-phase modulated square wave, whose internal transitions encode hours, minutes, seconds, and frames.http://www.philrees.co.uk/articles/timecode.htm MIDI time code (MTC) is actually a digital representation of SMPTE time code encapsulated as a series of quarter-frame MIDI messages.https://web.archive.org/web/20110629053759/http://web.media.mit.edu/~meyers/mcgill/multimedia/senior_project/MTC.html MTC was developed in 1986. Closures & Ladder Logic The beginnings of show control technology can probably be traced to the use of relay logic in other industries, most prominently elevators. The electric elevator was invented in 1880, but it was not until about 1930 that the rise of the \\"automatic\\" elevator produced more advanced electrical controls. Entertainment has always borrowed from other industries, and various electrically driven hoists, platforms and stage elevators soon made their way into theatres and amusement parks. Automation soon followed, utilizing switches, mechanical sensors and relays to perform repetitious sequences. Early modern roller coasters used this sort of control.https://priceonomics.com/the-business-of-building-roller- coasters/ When industrial microprocessor devices began to supplant relay installations, more complex sequences could be realized. These devices were called programmable logic controllers (PLCs), with the first being built in 1968 for an automobile plant.https://www.automationmag.com/features/the- father-of-invention-dick-morley-looks-back-on-the-40th-anniversary-of-the- plc.html PLCs were programmed using ladder logic, a language simulating relay logic. Even today, PLCs, mechanical switches, and optical sensors are used in many entertainment control and show control applications. They are found in stage lifts and wagons in theatres, animatronics, special effects, and show action equipment in theme parks, and in ride vehicles such as motion simulators, iron rides and roller coasters in amusement parks. One of their key advantages is safety. Potentially hazardous events can be redundantly checked against multiple safety considerations before being allowed to start or operate. Subsystems The lowest level of subsystem is an embedded system. These are typically found in single-purpose devices, such as a professional fog generator. A small microprocessor might be a part of the equipment and be used to control variables such as volume, temperature and communications with other devices. An example is these specifications for the Antari DMG-200 fog machine. The programmable logic controller, or its cousin the small logic controller, would be the next increase in scale. These are commonly used to control subsystems which vary from moderately-sized to very large pieces of equipment. The unifying factor is that the equipment fulfills a single purpose, whether it be an animatronic figure or an entire ride system. In the earliest days of show control, PLCs were sometimes used as a show controller for an entire attraction. This is no longer done since there are now simpler and more cost-effective solutions for show control. Entertainment control systems are the highest level of subsystem, often consisting of sophisticated, expensive controllers which fulfill a single purpose. The modern lighting control console is probably the best example of this type of equipment. Some of the largest concert and hotel-casino installations might use three lighting consoles, each with a distinct purpose.  Systems  Show control systems are very widely used in theme parks as a means of synchronizing ride systems with lighting, audio, show action equipment and special effects. They are also used extensively in live shows in theme parks, such as parades, stunt shows, character shows, and special events, including large fireworks displays. They have found increasing use in live theatre, although due to their cost and the necessity for specialists to design and program them, they are mainly found in large Broadway-type productions or Las Vegas Hotel-Casino production shows. They are also seen in some of the larger concert tours, especially those featuring moving scenery, flying rigs, and special effects. Shows which are performed once or only a few times are often not considered candidates for show control since considerable preplanning and programming is usually required, but this may change as the technology, ease of operation and programming of show control software and systems matures. It must be remembered that entertainment control does not constitute show control. A computerized lighting console controlling dimmers and lighting effects is not show control. Only when that lighting console is linked to another system, perhaps a computerized audio playback system, does it become show control. Generally, there are several kinds of show control systems, as well as hybrid systems which may include multiple system types. In theme parks, the overall show controller is referred to as the RSS (ride/show supervisor). The operator interface in these installations is the OCC (operator control console). In the early years of usage, the RSS was probably a PLC. This began to change as entertainment manufacturers began writing software for personal computers, and/or building small, dedicated computing devices. An example of the former was the Richmond Command Cue system, which used an Amiga computer connected to a proprietary frame containing audio control and matrixing, as well as closure capability. The computer maintained multiple cue lists, and could send MSC messages to other subsystems, such as lighting consoles. An example of the latter might be the Alcorn-McBride V-16, which was programmed with a PC, but did not require one in operation. The V-16 was capable of sending cues as serial messages, contact closures, MSC, and could sync to or generate SMPTE LTC.

The United Methodist Church defines connection as the principle that \\"all leaders and congregations are connected in a network of loyalties and commitments that support, yet supersede, local concerns.\\" Accordingly, the primary decision-making bodies in Methodism are conferences, which serve to gather together representatives of various levels of church hierarchy. In the United Methodist Church and Free Methodist Church, where bishops provide church leadership, connexionalism is a variety of episcopal polity. Many Methodist churches, such as the British Methodist Church, do not have bishops. In world Methodism, a given connexion (that is, denomination) is usually autonomous. Overview In the history of Christianity in England, a connexion was a circuit of prayer groups who would employ travelling ministers alongside the regular ministers attached to each congregation. This method of organizing emerged in 18th-century English nonconformist religious circles; this is why the otherwise old-fashioned spelling (connexion rather than connection) is retained in the British church. The Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion, for instance, was founded by Selina, Countess of Huntingdon. Over time, as Methodism became a separate church, this structure of connexions came to form a new system of polity, separate from episcopal polity. Connexional polity in Britain has always been characterized by a strong central organization which holds an annual conference. The connexion is divided into districts in the charge of a chairperson. Methodist districts often correspond approximately, in geographical terms, to counties ‚Äì as do Church of England dioceses. The districts are divided into circuits governed by the circuit meeting and led and administrated principally by a superintendent minister. Ministers are appointed to circuits rather than to individual churches. Most notably, there are no bishops in the British connexion. The term full connexion is used in Great Britain and in Ireland to refer to presbyters and deacons being \\"subject to the rules and discipline of the Conference of the Methodist Church\\", and specifically that they are subject to being stationed (i.e. appointed to ministry in a local circuit) at the direction of the conference. Free Methodist churches and United Methodist churches are generally organized on a connexional model, related but not identical to that used in Britain. Pastors are assigned to congregations by bishops, distinguishing it from presbyterian government. Methodist denominations typically give lay members representation at regional and national meetings (conferences) at which the business of the church is conducted, This connexional organizational model differs further from the congregational model, for example of Baptist and Congregationalist churches.

He made important investigations on ganglia, nerve-endings, and the sympathetic nerves. Life Rudolf Wagner was born at Bayreuth, where his father was a professor in the gymnasium. He began the study of medicine at Erlangen in 1822. Wagner completed his curriculum in 1826 at W√ºrzburg, where he mainly studied under Johann Lukas Sch√∂nlein in medicine and to Karl Friedrich Heusinger in comparative anatomy. Aided by a public stipend, he spent a year or more studying in the Jardin des Plantes, under the friendly eye of Cuvier, and making zoological discoveries at Cagliari and other places on the Mediterranean. On his return to Germany he set up a medical practice at Augsburg, where his father had been transferred. A few months later he found an opening for an academic position when he was appointed prosector at Erlangen. In 1832 he became full professor of zoology and comparative anatomy there, and held that office until 1840, when he was called to succeed JF Blumenbach at G√∂ttingen. He remained at the Hanoverian university until his death, being much occupied with administrative work as pro-rector for a number of years, and for nearly the whole of his residence troubled by ill health from tuberculosis. In 1860 he gave over the physiological part of his teaching to a new chair, retaining the zoological, with which his career had begun. While at Frankfurt, on his way to examine the Neanderthal skull at Bonn, he was struck with paralysis. Wagner died at G√∂ttingen a few months later on 13 May 1864. Contributions Wagner's activity as a writer and worker was enormous, and his range extensive, most of his hard work having been done at Erlangen while his health was good. His graduation thesis was on the progress of the working classes. The ambitious title of The historical development of epidemic and contagious diseases all over the world, with the laws of their diffusion showed the influence of Sch√∂nlein. His first treatise was Die Naturgeschichte des Menschen (in 2 vols, Kempten, 1831). Frequent journeys to the Mediterranean, the Adriatic, and the North Sea gave him abundant materials for research on invertebrate anatomy and physiology, which he communicated first to the Munich academy of sciences, and republished in his Beitr√§ge zur vergleichenden Physiologie des Blutes (Leipzig, 1832‚Äì33, with additions in 1838). In 1834‚Äì35, he brought out a textbook on the subject he chaired (Lehrbuch der vergleichenden Anatomie, Leipzig), which recommended itself to students by its clear and concise style. A new edition of it appeared in 1843 under the title of Lehrbuch der Zootomie, of which only the vertebrate section was corrected by himself. The precision of his earlier work is evidenced by his Micrometric Measurements of the Elementary Parts of Man and Animals (Leipzig, 1834). His zoological labours may be said to conclude with the atlas Icones zootomicae (Leipzig, 1841). In 1835, he communicated to the Munich academy of sciences his researches on the physiology of generation and development, including the famous discovery of the germinal vesicle of the human ovum. These were republished under the title Prodromus historiae generationis hominis atque animalium (Leipzig, 1836). As in zoology, his original researches in physiology were followed by a students' textbook, Lehrbuch der speciellen Physiologie (Leipzig, 1838), which soon reached a third edition, and was translated into French and English. This was supplemented by an atlas, Icones physiologicae (Leipzig, 1839). To the same period belongs a very interesting (but now little-known) work on medicine proper, of a historical and synthetic scope: Grundriss der Encyklop√§die und Methodologie der medicinischen Wissenschaften nach geschichtlicher Ansicht (Erlangen, 1838). It was translated into Danish. About the same time he worked at a translation of James Cowles Prichard's Natural History of Man, and edited various writings of Samuel Thomas Sommerring, with a biography of that anatomist (1844), which he himself fancied most of all his writings. In 1843, after his removal to G√∂ttingen, he began his great Handw√∂rterbuch der Physiologie mit R√ºcksicht auf physiologische Pathologie123.13.24, and brought out the fifth (supplementary) volume in 1852. His only original contributions to this work were on the sympathetic nerve, nerve-ganglia and nerve-endings, and he modestly disclaimed all merit except as being the organizer. While resident in Italy for his health from 1845 to 1847, he occupied himself with research on the electrical organ of the torpedo genus of electric eels and on nervous organization generally; these he published in 1853‚Äì1854 (Neurologische Untersuchungen, G√∂ttingen), and therewith his physiological period may be said to end. Philosophy He boldly stood against materialism and avowed himself a Christian believer. This lost him the respect of a number of his old friends and pupils, and was unfeelingly told that he was \\"suffering from an atrophy of the brain.\\" His quarrel with Carl Vogt and other materialists began with his oration at the G√∂ttingen meeting of the Naturforscher-Versammlung in 1854, on \\"Menschensch√∂pfung und Seelensubstanz.\\" This was followed by a series of \\"Physiological Letters\\" in the Allgemeine Zeitung, by an essay on \\"Glauben and Wissen,\\" and by the most important piece of this series, \\"Der Kampf um die Seele vom Standpunkt der Wissenschaft\\" (G√∂ttingen, 1857). Having come to the consideration of these philosophical problems late in life, he was at some disadvantage; but he endeavoured to join as he best could in the current of contemporary German thought. He had an exact knowledge of classical German writings, especially of Goethe's, and of the literature connected with him. Paleoanthropology In what may be called his fourth and last period, Wagner became an anthropologist and archaeologist. He occupied himself with the cabinet of skulls in the G√∂ttingen museum collected by Blumenbach and with the excavation of prehistoric remains, corresponded actively with the anthropological societies of Paris and London, and organized, in co-operation with the veteran Karl Ernst von Baer, a successful congress of anthropologists at G√∂ttinger in 1861. His last writings were memoirs on the convolutions of the human brain, on the weight of brains, and on the brains of idiots (1860‚Äì1862).

Though extensively ruined (the transepts are the main surviving parts), Dundrennan is noted for the purity and restraint of its architecture, reflecting the austere Cistercian ideal. It is also built from very hard-weathering grey sandstone, so the original architectural forms and mouldings are well preserved. Mary, Queen of Scots, after the Battle of Langside, spent her final night in Scotland here, in 1568. From neighbouring Port Mary, she crossed the Solway Firth to Workington, and shortly after was imprisoned by the English. In 1587, following the Scottish Reformation, the land passed to the Crown. The site fell into ruin after it was subsequently used to house livestock. Historic Environment Scotland maintains the site today as a scheduled monument. History Abbot's Monument In the mid 12th century, Fergus of Galloway resurrected the Bishopric of Whithorn, an ancient Galwegian See first established by the expansionary Northumbrians under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of York. The last Bishop of Whithorn, Beadwulf, had been noted in c. 803. Thereafter nothing is heard; and it is likely the Bishopric disappeared with Northumbrian power, a decline marked by the sack and subsequent occupation of York by the Danes in 867. In the following two and a half centuries, Galloway, if and where jurisdiction actually existed, seems to have been under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Man in the west, with Durham and Glasgow in the east. Moves to resurrect the See were initiated on 9 December 1125, when Pope Honorius II wrote to the Bishop-elect of Whithorn, ordering him to appear before the Archbishop of York. Pope Honorius to the Bishop-Elect of Whithorn The would-be Bishop was a cleric called Gille Aldan, and the Archbishop was Thurstan. York had been coming under increasing pressure from the ambitions of Canterbury, and the northern English metropolitan had only two suffragans (Durham and Man). He needed three in fact to hold proper Archiepiscopal elections. It is likely that York and Fergus did a deal. The involvement of King David I can be discounted on the grounds of his anti-York policies, and his total inclination to appoint English or French clerics, and not Gaelic ones like Gille Aldan. The deal ensured the Galwegian church would not undermine Fergus‚Äô independence of both Man or Scotland, and secured an identity for the new kingdom in the framework of northern Britain and the Isles.

Following the reorganization in 1998, they are now awarded under the names Smith-Knight Prize and Rayleigh-Knight Prize. History The Smith Prize fund was founded by bequest of Robert Smith upon his death in 1768, having by his will left ¬£3,500 of South Sea Company stock to the University. Every year two or more junior Bachelor of Arts students who had made the greatest progress in mathematics and natural philosophy were to be awarded a prize from the fund. The prize was awarded every year from 1769 to 1998 except 1917. From 1769 to 1885, the prize was awarded for the best performance in a series of examinations. In 1854 George Stokes included an examination question on a particular theorem that William Thomson had written to him about, which is now known as Stokes' theorem. T. W. K√∂rner notes > Only a small number of students took the Smith's prize examination in the > nineteenth century. When Karl Pearson took the examination in 1879, the > examiners were Stokes, Maxwell, Cayley, and Todhunter and the examinees went > on each occasion to an examiner's dwelling, did a morning paper, had lunch > there and continued their work on the paper in the afternoon. In 1885, the examination was renamed Part III, (now known as the Certificate of Advanced Study in Mathematics) and the prize was awarded for the best submitted essay rather than examination performance. According to Barrow-Green > By fostering an interest in the study of applied mathematics, the > competition contributed towards the success in mathematical physics that was > to become the hallmark of Cambridge mathematics during the second half of > the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century, the competition stimulated postgraduate research in mathematics in Cambridge and the competition has played a significant role by providing a springboard for graduates considering an academic career. The majority of prize-winners have gone on to become professional mathematicians or physicists. The Rayleigh Prize was an additional prize, which was awarded for the first time in 1911. The Smith's and Rayleigh prizes were only available to Cambridge graduate students who had been undergraduates at Cambridge. The J.T. Knight Prize was established in 1974 for Cambridge graduates who had been undergraduates at other universities. The prize commemorates J.T. Knight (1942‚Äì1970), who had been an undergraduate student at Glasgow and a graduate student at Cambridge. He was killed in a motor car accident in Ireland in April 1970. J.T. Knight =Value of the prizes= Originally, in 1769, the prizes were worth ¬£25 each and remained at that level for 100 years. In 1867, they fell to ¬£23 and in 1915 were still reported to be worth that amount. By 1930, the value had risen to about ¬£30, and by 1940, the value had risen by a further one pound to ¬£31. By 1998, a Smith's Prize was worth around ¬£250. In 2007, the value of the three prize funds was roughly ¬£175,000.Cambridge University Trust Funds p.34 =Reorganization of prizes= In 1998 the Smith Prize, Rayleigh Prize and J. T.

History The La Vie Claire team was created in 1984 by Bernard Tapie and directed by Paul K√∂chli. The team included five-time Tour de France winner Bernard Hinault, and three-time winner, Greg LeMond, as well as Andrew Hampsten and the Canadian Steve Bauer. With Hinault winning the Tour in 1985, and LeMond winning in 1986, plus winning the team trophy both years, La Vie Claire cemented their place in cycling team history. The team formed after Bernard Hinault had a dispute with his former directeur sportif Cyrille Guimard of Renault-Elf- Gitane with whom Hinault had won four editions of the Tour de France. After Hinault's teammate Laurent Fignon won the 1983 Tour de France while Hinault was injured, Fignon became the designated leader of the team. Hinault formed the La Vie Claire team with Tapie and K√∂chli and steadily built up his form. During the 1984 Tour de France, Renault-Elf-Gitane dominated the race with 8 stage wins including the Team time trial as well as wearing the yellow jersey from the 5th stage onward with Vincent Barteau and Laurent Fignon. Fignon won the Tour by over ten minutes from Hinault. In addition with World Champion Greg LeMond the Renault team also finished third overall in that Tour and LeMond won the Young rider's jersey. After this dominance by the Renault-Elf- Gitane team, Tapie and Hinault approached Greg LeMond after the 1984 Tour with a one-million dollar contract offer - the first in cycling history - to leave Renault-Elf-Gitane and join Hinault at La Vie Claire. LeMond accepted and forever changed the salary structure in bicycle racing. With Hinault and LeMond the team won the 1985 and the 1986 Tour de France. At the end of 1986, Hinault retired and in the spring of 1987 LeMond was injured in a hunting accident.https://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-21/sports/sp-133_1_stable- condition Hampsten who had finished fourth in the 1986 Tour de France and as best young rider left the team at the end of 1986. Jean-Fran√ßois Bernard was seen by some as a successor to Hinault in stage races and became the leader of the team. Bernard led the general classification during the 1987 Tour de France and finished third overall, and led the general classification during the 1988 Giro d'Italia but then never regained the form to perform in the grand tours for the team. The team itself was undergoing further changes - LeMond and Bauer left the team at the end of 1987 and K√∂chli and Tapie stopped directing the team in 1988 and 1989. During the latter years of the team Laurent Jalabert and Tony Rominger were team leaders and earned success for the team. Jersey The La Vie Claire colors (red, yellow, blue and gray) were based on the artwork of Piet Mondrian, giving them a unique appearance in the peloton during the 80s Tours de France. The La Vie Claire jersey, originally designed by Benetton, went through at least five major revisions between 1984-1988 as the team partnered different sponsors (Radar, Wonder, Toshiba, LOOK (and Red Zinger and Celestial Seasonings when racing on American soil)). The design (sleeves: yellow and grey; chest: pattern of rectangles in different sizes and colors) is considered one of the most memorable jersey designs in cycling. Manufactured by Santini of Italy, it is still very popular with cycling fans, topping a cyclingnews.com poll in 2018. From 1987, Toshiba became the main sponsor of the team and from 1988 onwards La Vie Claire withdrew their sponsorship. The jersey was redesigned in 1990. The Toshiba team continued until the end of the 1991 season. Technology Also strongly associated with La Vie Claire was the French company LOOK, which made the first clipless pedals, and which was owned by Tapie at that time. La Vie Claire was among the first to use carbon fiber frames in the Tour de France. The team switched in 1986 from their previous supplier, Hinault, to carbon fiber frames and forks by TVT. In 1989 the team rode a carbon-fiber frame/fork manufactured by LOOK and fitted with titanium components. In the same year, the team began to use heart rate monitors in training and racing, a technology that the traditional training culture in cycling at first resisted.  Intra- team rivalry  In the 1985 Tour de France, Hinault was considered the leader of the team, which would work for him to win the Tour for a record-tying fifth time. But after dominating the first two-thirds of the race, on stage 14 Hinault crashed in Saint-√âtienne and broke his nose. Though he continued, his injury and subsequent bronchitis caused him to be weakened thereafter. On stage 17 LeMond and a rival rider, Stephen Roche, were far ahead of the pack when the team boss Bernard Tapie and coach Paul K√∂chli asked him to slow down, saying that Hinault was 45 seconds behind. LeMond refrained from attacking and waited at the stage's finish where he realized he'd been misled; Hinault was in fact more than three minutes behind. Hinault went on to win that year's Tour by 1 minute 42 seconds; in return for his assistance, LeMond was assured by Hinault that he would support LeMond the following year. In the following year's Tour, Hinault surprised LeMond by riding an aggressive race, going on individual attacks, which he insisted was to deter and demoralize their mutual rivals. He claimed his tactics were to wear down LeMond's (and his) opponents and that he knew that LeMond would win because of time losses earlier in the race. However, LeMond saw this as a betrayal and accused Hinault of reneging on his promise. In LeMond's words, \\"He totally tried screwing me. But I don't blame him.\\" As the 1986 Tour wore on, loyalties among LeMond and Hinault's teammates split along national lines, with the Americans and British supporting LeMond and the French and Belgians backing Hinault. Andrew Hampsten said of the 1986 Tour: \\"It was rotten being on the team... Steve Bauer and I had to chase down Hinault on the stage into Saint-√âtienne. That really sucked.\\" The competition, abandoned promises, and high stakes in the LeMond- Hinault controversy makes it one of the most public and bitter rivalries between teammates in cycling history. Their story was chronicled in the book Slaying the Badger by Richard Moore.

The Deutsche Bank Building is visible behind an angled red crane. The Deutsche Bank Building (formerly Bankers Trust Plaza) was a 39-story office skyscraper located at 130 Liberty Street in Manhattan, New York City, adjacent to the World Trade Center site. The building opened in 1974 and closed following the September 11 attacks in 2001, due to contamination that spread from the collapse of the South Tower. The structure was designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, which also designed the Empire State Building. The building was purchased by Deutsche Bank when it acquired Bankers Trust in 1998. It was part of the skyline of Lower Manhattan, and was demolished between 2007 and 2011. 5 World Trade Center will eventually replace the building, expanding the ground space on which the World Trade Center stands, as this land was not part of the original World Trade Center. After the September 11 attacks=Plans= Detail of gash in the facade imparted by the collapse of the World Trade Center. A segment of the South Tower facade is visible hanging from the gash. The collapse of the South Tower during the September 11 attacks tore a 24-story gash into the facade of the building. Steel and concrete protruded from the building for months afterward, which was eventually cleaned up. However, due to extensive contamination, Deutsche Bank decided that the 39-story ruin was to be taken down. During the cleanup and recovery period, netting was placed inside gashes and holes to prevent collapse. The owner maintained that the building could not be restored to habitable condition, while its insurers sought to treat the incident as recoverable damage rather than a total loss. Work on the building was deferred for over two years during which the condition of the building deteriorated. In September 2005, human remains were found on the roof, and in March 2006, construction workers found more bone fragments and remains. This prompted calls from victims' family members for another search of the building by forensic experts. Between April 7 and 14, 2006, more than 700 human bone fragments were discovered in the ballast gravel on the roof. The cost of demolition had steadily increased to $75 million by Bovis Lend Lease, as large amounts of asbestos, dioxin, lead, silica, quartz, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chromium, and manganese had been found within the building. =Demolition= In 2004, an agreement was announced to settle the disposition of the building and insurance claims. As part of this agreement, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation acquired the land and commenced demolition work. On December 7, 2006, the Associated Press reported that the building would be dismantled. The report indicated that nearby residents were fearful of possible toxic dust associated with the Twin Towers within the building. On May 17, 2007, work was halted after a 22-foot section of pipe fell 35 stories and landed on the roof of \\"The Ten House\\", home to Engine 10 and Ladder 10 of the New York City Fire Department. Two firefighters were injured by falling debris, although they were not struck by the pipe itself. View of the building during the fire of August 18, 2007 On August 18, 2007, at approximately 3:40 pm, a seven-alarm fire broke out on the 17th floor of the building, caused by workers smoking in violation of the building's safety rules. Around this time, crews were removing one floor per week, and the building had only 26 more. At the time of the fire, crews were removing asbestos. The fire spread in both directions, affecting a total of 10 floors. The floors were also filled with a maze of protective polyethylene sheets, which were designed to prevent the spread of asbestos, and also trapped smoke. The building lacked a standpipe, making it extremely difficult to put out the fire. The building had not been inspected since March, when it should have been inspected every 15 days. The fire burned into the night before being extinguished, and numerous special and support units responded from the New York City Fire Department to combat the fire. The fire killed two FDNY firefighters, Robert Beddia of Engine Company 24, and Joseph Graffagnino of Ladder Company 5, who succumbed on the 14th floor to smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning. The fire also injured 115 other firefighters, 46 of which were seriously enough to require medical leave. Plans to demolish the building continued as quickly as possible. In 2008, the Manhattan District Attorney indicted three construction supervisors and the demolition subcontractor, John Galt Corporation.\\"Deutsche Investigation Finds Many More to Blame\\", Downtown Express, June 26 ‚Äì July 2, 2009, p. 3 A city stop-work order was lifted in April 2008 and decontamination work began again in May of the same year. Dismantling in January 2008. Dismantling was originally scheduled to be completed by the end of 2008, and later by the end of 2010. In October 2009, it was announced that dismantling of the building would finally resume. Demolition was completed on January 20, 2011, with the removal of the crane. Demolition of the first floor and foundation was finished on February 28, 2011. It was the last part of the building to be removed. Future The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took over the site as its developer. The site is occupied by the Vehicular Security Center and Liberty Park, while the 5 World Trade Center is in the planning stages. =5 World Trade Center= Negotiations over the World Trade Center site concluded in April 2006 with private developer Larry Silverstein yielding his right to develop on the site designated for One World Trade Center and Tower Five to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in exchange for assistance in financing Towers Two, Three, and Four. Mayor Michael Bloomberg claimed there wasn't enough demand for office space to fill the five skyscrapers included in the World Trade Center's master plan, and called for a major revision of the plan to include housing or hotels. However, the demand for Manhattan office space, including downtown, has been booming since 2006, and on January 16, 2007, the investment bank JPMorgan Chase was in talks with the Port Authority about developing a 42-story skyscraper, which would prevent Mayor Bloomberg's push to use the site for housing. Several sources familiar with JPMorgan Chase's talks with Port Authority officials said the firm's bid to develop a proposed 42-story tower for major corporate tenants is being taken seriously by the bistate agency. To make the commercial deal work, the Port Authority would have to agree to expand the size of Tower 5's base to accommodate the large, lower-level floors needed for trading rooms, a requirement for most large financial-services firms. The Port Authority hired Kohn Pederson Fox to design a 42-story skyscraper with a cantilevered section starting at the 14th floor to accommodate the large trading floors. On June 14, 2007, Bloomberg and then-Governor Eliot Spitzer announced that JPMorgan Chase had won the bid to buy and build the new tower at 130 Liberty Street to replace the Deutsche Bank Building. However, after the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase in March 2008, the future of 130 Liberty Street has been put into question as JPMorgan Chase has announced that it intends to move into Bear Stearns' old headquarters at 383 Madison Avenue. If JPMorgan Chase does not renew their bid, the site would likely be used for a residential or hotel tower, as per Bloomberg's plan prior to JPMorgan Chase's bid. Recently, community and civic leaders met to discuss the site's future with community leaders favoring a hotel or residential development and outgoing deputy mayor Robert Lieber favoring an office tower.Dunning, Matt Dep. Mayor: 130 Liberty St. Should be Reserved for Office Tower =Church and Vehicular Security Center= On October 14, 2011, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which controls rebuilding at Ground Zero, and St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church announced an agreement that allows the church to build a 4,100-square-foot church and interfaith bereavement center at 130 Liberty Street. The original church, which was located at 155 Cedar Street and founded by Greek immigrants in 1916, was the only religious building to be completely destroyed during the 9/11 attacks. , the church has not been completed. Construction restarted after a several year pause on August 3, 2020, with an aim to be completed by the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in 2021. Delays in taking down the Deutsche Bank at Ground Zero forced the Port Authority to delay the expected completion date of the crucial Vehicular Security Center. Repeated delays had also added roughly $100 million to the cost of rebuilding the World Trade Center. Originally projected to open in 2013, it opened in June 2016 following the completion of Liberty Park, which is on top of the garage.

The main line, centered in Mosul, ruled from 990 to 1096. History=Rise= The 'Uqaylids were descended from the Banu Uqayl and were Shi'a. They first came to power in Diyar Bakr when they were granted land there by the Buwayhids, who hoped that they would serve as a buffer against the Kurd BƒÅdh ibn Dustak. Soon afterwards the 'Uqaylids forged an alliance with the Hamdanids, who had been expelled from Mosul by the Buwayhids in 979. Together the two of them moved against the Buyids and Mosul and the Diyar Rabi'a was occupied in 989. The 'Uqaylid leader, Muhammad b. Musayyib, then fought against BƒÅdh, which eventually resulted in the death of the Kurdish rebel. Following this, Muhammad turned against the Hamdanids and defeating them as well. He also forced the Buwayhid governor of Mosul to grant him half of his dependencies. ='Uqaylids of Mosul= Muhammad b. Musayyib died in 996. He was succeeded by his brother Muqallad, who in that same year marched on Mosul, forcing its Buwayhid governor to flee. From there the 'Uqaylids advanced into Iraq; they succeeded in overrunning much of the country and even raiding Baghdad. Eventually the Buwayhid amir Baha' al-Dawla came to terms with Muqallad, whereby the Uqaylid was invested by the caliph with the rule of Mosul, Kufa and Jami'yan. He was also given the title of \\"Husam al-Dawla\\". The treaty made Muqallad nominally subservient to the Buwayhids but in effect he was independent, refusing to pay the tribute that he owed. Despite the treaty, Muqallad still desired to take Baghdad, and might have done so had he not been assassinated by one of his Turkish slaves in 1001. This marked the beginning of the long reign of Muqallad's son, Qirwash. In 1002 Qirwash raided Buwayhid territory, prompting Baha' al-Dawla's governor of Baghdad to undertake an expedition against the 'Uqaylids. Defeated at first, he eventually managed gain a victory over them near Kufa, but at this point was removed from his post as governor, preventing him from following up on this success. In 1005 Qirwash was confirmed in all of his possessions by the caliph, who gave him the title \\"Mu'tamid al-Dawla\\". Qirwash's major problem during the second half of his reign was finding a way to control the Oghuz Turks who were coming in from Iran. The Oghuz even managed to occupy and sack Mosul in 1044, although Qirwash was able to expel them with the support of the Mazyadids. In 1050 Qirwash was removed from power by his brother Baraka (\\"Za'im al-Dawla\\"), who reigned until 1052 when he died. Baraka's son Quraysh (\\"'Alam al-Din\\") succeeded him and ruled for the next nine years. During his reign he acknowledged the supremacy of the Seljuks, although he later came into conflict with them and was temporarily expelled from Mosul. He accompanied the Turk Basasiri when the latter took Baghdad at the end of 1058, but the Seljuks retook the city in the next year. Quraysh died in 1061 and was followed by his son Muslim (\\"Sharaf al-Dawla\\"). Sharaf al-Dawla was a just ruler; the 'Uqaylid domains were relatively stable for most of his reign. He furthermore gained Aleppo from the Mirdasids in 1080 when its inhabitants offered to hand the city over to him in the hopes that he could protect from Seljuk raids, and he took Harran from the Numayrids in the following year. Soon, however, he ran into trouble with the Seljuks himself. He fought against Sultan Malik Shah's forces and was defeated, but he was pardoned. In 1085 he was killed fighting the Seljuks of S√ºleyman b. Qutulmush. Following Sharaf al-Dawla's death, his brother Ibrahim, who had previously been imprisoned, was released and declared as his successor. S√ºleyman meanwhile had been killed by the Seljuk ruler of Damascus, Tutush, who went on to seize Aleppo from the 'Uqaylids in 1086. In 1089 or 1090 Ibrahim was summoned to the court of Malik Shah. When he arrived he was imprisoned and was kept close to Malik Shah's side. Mosul during this time was managed by the Seljuk vizier Fakhr al-Dawla ibn Jahir. When Malik Shah died in 1092 a fight between Sharaf al-Dawla's sons Ali and Muhammad ensued. Ali was brought by his mother Safiyya to Mosul, but Muhammad attempted to take the city for himself. In a battle at Mosul he was defeated and forced to flee. Ibrahim, meanwhile, had been released by Malik Shah's widow so he returned to Mosul, and eventually convinced Safiyya to give up the city to him. Ibrahim managed to keep his renewed power for only a short time. The emir of Damascus, Tutush, demanded that he recognize him as sultan in the khutba and allow him passage through his territory. Ibrahim refused, prompting Tutush to move his army against him. The two sides met outside Mosul in April 1093, and in the ensuing battle he was defeated and captured by the Seljuk. Tutush had him executed before installing Ali and his mother Safiyya as his representatives in Mosul. Muhammad b. Sharaf al-Daula continued to attempt gain Mosul. He recruited the Turkish commander Kerbogha and his brother Tuntash, but Kerbogha imprisoned him. He then attempted to take Mosul from Ali but failed. Kerbogha then executed Muhammad and tried again to take Mosul. As the siege continued, Ali decided to flee to the Mazyadids. Kerbogha eventually gained control of the city in late 1096 and became its amir, ending 'Uqaylid rule there. Other 'Uqailids Several other 'Uqailid lines were established in various areas, including Jazirat ibn Umar, Takrit, Hƒ´t, and Ukbara (whose ruler, Gharib b. Muhammad once gave refuge to the Buwayhid amir Jalal al-Daula when he found it necessary to leave Baghdad). Some of these lines were still extant after the overthrow of the 'Uqailids in Mosul, with one branch in Raqqa and Qal'at Ja'bar lasting until 1169 when it was ended by the Zengids.

His career falls easily into two rather different halves: he worked in Rome from 1526 or earlier as an engraver in collaboration with leading artists, and then in Venice, before moving to spend the rest of his life as a court goldsmith in Poland, where he died.Jestaz; Pon, 150 for his deathplace, still uncertain in earlier sources. In Italy, he was one of the first reproductive printmakers, rendering versions of specially made drawings (mostly) or paintings rather than creating new works for the print medium, although detailed comparison of surviving drawings with the prints made from them show he had input into the creative process.Landau, 120-121 He was in Rome at the brief period when the small but flourishing printmaking industry created by Raphael working with engravers to diffuse his work had been disrupted by Raphael's sudden death in 1520, cutting off the supply of new designs, and other artists were recruited fill the gap.Landau, 130, 154, 159, 287 A. Hyatt Mayor describes Caraglio as \\"the most individual member of the group\\", who had a particular influence on French printmaking of the First School of Fontainebleau, although unlike Rosso he never went there.Mayor, 341 His skill in engraving was available to artists developing the early style of full-blown Mannerism, and played a significant role in diffusing advanced Mannerist style around Italy and Europe.Shearman, 64, 67, 194-195 Life=Italy= Caraglio was probably trained as a goldsmith before learning advanced engraving techniques from Marcantonio Raimondi, in whose circle in Rome he first appears in records in 1526. Raphael's former associate il Baviera, who probably acted as his \\"publisher\\", introduced him to Rosso Fiorentino, with whom he collaborated on numerous prints, including sets of The Labours of Hercules (Bartsch 44‚Äì49), Pagan Divinities in Niches (Bartsch 24‚Äì43) and Loves of the Gods (Bartsch 9-23). He engraved gems and designed and cast medals as well as producing reproductive engravings after the works of Rosso, Parmigianino, Giulio Romano, Baccio Bandinelli, Raphael, Titian, Michelangelo, and Perino del Vaga. Bartsch records 65 prints, though missing perhaps another five. His style is summarized by Fran√ßoise Jestaz: \\"Numbered with Agostino dei Musi and Marco Dente in the Roman school of engravers in the circle of Raimondi, Caraglio showed a greater freedom of line. With Rosso Fiorentino and Parmigianino, he discovered new modelling effects with subtler lighting and more animated forms, for example in his engraving of Diogenes (b. 61) and in the first state of the Rape of the Sabine Women (b. 63).\\"Jestaz; Mayor, 341; Image of Diogenes after Parmigianino He worked from drawings created by Rosso and others for the purpose, and a proof of a print after Rosso at Chatsworth House has a landscape background in pen added to printed figures, presumably by one of the two, Rosso's initial drawing having only included the figures. He worked closely with Rosso and Parmigianino, and a number of their drawings for his prints survive, usually at the same size and in the reverse sense of the prints.Landau, 130, 154, 159, 287; Bury, 15 on the Chatsworth drawing His Loves of the Gods were, with I Modi, one of the \\"two best-known series of Renaissance erotic prints\\", and altogether one of the most successful Renaissance print series. Unlike I Modi they successfully avoided censorship by avoiding depicting genitals and actual penetration in favour of \\"slung leg\\" positions, and by virtue of their ostensibly mythological subjects. This was despite one showing two males, Apollo and Hyacinthus, together, if not actually making love. Both sets were much copied, with five different copies of Caraglio's set, and in 1550 a dealer bought 250 sets of French copies, a very large number for the time.Landau, 297-298 (quoted first); Bayer, 205-207 (quoted second) They were even used as sources for illustrations in medical textbooks later in the century,Moulton, 534 as well as one of a set of Flemish tapestries of about 1550, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.The Bridal Chamber of Herse, from a set of eight tapestries depicting the Story of Mercury and Herse, MMA The first two designs were by Rosso, but the pair then fell out, and Pierino did most of the rest, probably with an unknown weaker artist contributing some designs.Bayer, 205-206, with illustrations of the full set Caraglio's prints were also often used as sources to be expanded into designs for maiolica. Caraglio fled to Venice on the Sack of Rome in 1527, in which his colleague Marco Dente was killed, and the whole circle dispersed. He seems to have remained there until at least 1537, working with Titian and others. =Poland= In 1539 he is recorded at the Polish court of Sigismund I. He had probably been introduced there through Pietro Aretino, a friend in Venice, and his contacts with the circle of the Italian-born Polish Queen Bona Sforza (1494‚Äì1557), such as Allesandro Pessenti, Bona's organist. In Poland he mostly worked for the court on medals, gems and goldsmithing rather than printmaking.Jestaz; Pon, 149-150; Morka, 82 Vasari presents this as, in Caraglio's view, a step up the hierarchy of genres and as offering a better social position, and indeed the status of printmaking was on the decline as the merely reproductive print, commissioned by publishers, had largely driven out the original print.Landau, 284-287; Bury, throughout, Kris, 3-4 The Renaissance medal was a novelty in the Polish court, but promoted by Bona, and in July 1539 Caraglio wrote to Aretino enclosing two medals, one of Pesenti and the other of Bona, the first evidence of his presence in Poland. Some copies of the former survive, but none of Bona's medal, as of some other recorded ones Caraglio made in Poland.Morka, generally on early Polish medals, 82-83 on Caraglio. Only one copy survives of the medal he made of Sigismund I in 1538 from the gold sent as dowry for the wedding of Elizabeth of Austria (1526‚Äì1545), the first wife of the future Sigismund II, which was handed out to wedding guests.Morka, 82 Medal of Sigismund II Augustus Caraglio was appointed royal goldsmith to Sigismund I in 1545, with a salary (probably more a retainer in modern terms) of 60 zloties, and continued serving under Sigismund II Augustus from 1548, when Sigismund I died. Having taken citizenship in Krakow, he was knighted (as equitatis aureati), with a patent of nobility, in April 1552, after which he made a brief return trip to Italy. It was presumably on this visit that the portrait now in the Wawel Castle in Krakow by Paris Bordone was made to celebrate his knighthood. The royal white eagle has the monogram of Sigismund II on its chest, and the upper background shows the Roman amphitheatre at Verona; on the bench are the tools of a goldsmith rather than a printmaker.Landau, 286; Shultz and Mosca, 114; Jestaz In 1565, he is recorded in a court action over a debt of 80 zloties owed by another Italian emigre artist, the sculptor Giammaria Mosca, known as \\"Padovano\\", which Caraglio claimed from the executors of yet another Italian, a royal doctor, whose tomb Padovano had completed.Shultz and Mosca, 114 (this seems to have been the case; the legal situation is not well explained) Caraglio married a Polish woman and acquired property, and died in Krakow, where he is buried in the Carmelite church. Vasari apparently did not know this, but probably knew that he was buying land near Parma in anticipation of a retirement that never arrived.Shultz and Mosca, 114; Pon, 150 (many later sources are also rather confused on the point) He was also known as Cahalius or Jacobus Veronensis or Parmensis, the latter presumably after his estate near Parma, and these were used to sign some plates.Bryan Caraglio has never been the subject of a monograph.None listed in the bibliography in Jestaz, revised in 2004, nor by Pon Works A small number of identifiable surviving works other than prints include signed intaglios in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris (the Annunciation to the Shepherds in rock crystal) and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (Queen Bona),\\"Bona Sforza (1493-1557), Queen of Poland, Cameo by Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio, MMA and an unsigned attributed piece in the Ambrosiana in Milan (Bona in crystal),Kris, 4-5, all illustrated on p. 3 medals in Padua and elsewhere, and cameos in Munich (illustrated) and elsewhere.Jestaz; see Morka for several medals and illustrations He also produced relief plaquettes in bronze.

Many in Cornwall today continue to assert a distinct identity separate from or in addition to English or British identities. Cornish identity has been adopted by migrants into Cornwall, as well as by emigrant and descendant communities from Cornwall, the latter sometimes referred to as the Cornish diaspora. Although not included as an explicit option in the UK census, the numbers of those claiming Cornish ethnic and national identity are officially recognised and recorded.Ian Saltern, Cornish National Minority Report 2, 2011 Throughout classical antiquity, the ancient Britons formed a series of tribes, cultures and identities in Great Britain; the Dumnonii and Cornovii were the Celtic tribes who inhabited what was to become Cornwall during the Iron Age, Roman and post-Roman periods. The name Cornwall and its demonym Cornish are derived from the Celtic Cornovii tribe. The Anglo-Saxon invasion and settlement of Britain in the 5th to 6th centuries restricted the Romano-British culture and language gradually into the north and west of Great Britain whilst the inhabitants of southern and eastern Britain became English. The Cornish people, who shared the Brythonic language with the Welsh and Bretons across the sea, were referred to in the Old English language as the \\"Westwalas\\" meaning West Welsh. The Battle of Deorham between the Britons and Anglo-Saxons is thought to have resulted in a loss of landlinks with the people of Wales.In this period however land travel was far more difficult than travel by sea. The Cornish people and their Brythonic Cornish language experienced a process of anglicisation and attrition during the Medieval and early Modern Period. By the 18th century, and following the creation of the Kingdom of Great Britain, the Cornish language and identity had faded, largely replaced by the English language (albeit Cornish-influenced West Country dialects and Anglo-Cornish) and/or British identity.. A Celtic revival during the early-20th century enabled a cultural self-consciousness in Cornwall that revitalised the Cornish language and roused the Cornish to express a distinctly Celtic heritage. The Cornish language was granted official recognition under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in 2002, and in 2014 the Cornish people were recognised and afforded protection by the UK Government under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. In the 2011 census, the population of Cornwall, including the Isles of Scilly, was estimated to be 532,300. The Cornish self-government movement has called for greater recognition of Cornish culture, politics and language, and urged that Cornish people be accorded greater status, exemplified by the call for them to be one of the listed ethnic groups in the United Kingdom Census 2011 form.  Classification  Union and Cornish flags.alt=The Union and Cornish flags fluttering in the wind, against a grey, cloudy sky. Both geographic and historical factors distinguish the Cornish as an ethnic group further supported by identifiable genetic variance between the populations of Cornwall, neighbouring Devon and England as published in a 2012 Oxford University study. Throughout medieval and Early Modern Britain, the Cornish were at some points accorded the same status as the English and Welsh and considered a separate race or nation, distinct from their neighbours, with their own language, society and customs. A process of Anglicisation between 1485 and 1700 led to the Cornish adopting English language, culture and civic identity, a view reinforced by Cornish historian A. L. Rowse who said they were gradually \\"absorbed into the mainstream of English life\\". Although \\"decidedly modern\\" and \\"largely retrospective\\" in its identity politics, Cornish and Celtic associations have advanced the notion of a distinct Cornish national and ethnic identity since the late 20th century. In the United Kingdom Census 2001, despite no explicit \\"Cornish\\" option being available, approximately 34,000 people in Cornwall and 3,500 people elsewhere in the UK‚Äîa combined total equal to nearly 7 per cent of the population of Cornwall‚Äîidentified themselves as ethnic Cornish by writing this in under the \\"other\\" ethnicity option. The census figures show a change in identity from West to East, in Penwith 9.2 per cent identified as ethnically Cornish, in Kerrier it was 7.5 per cent, in Carrick 6.6 per cent, Restormel 6.3 per cent, North Cornwall 6 per cent, and Caradon 5.6 per cent. Weighting of the 2001 Census data gives a figure of 154,791 people with Cornish ethnicity living in Cornwall. The Cornish have been described as \\"a special case\\" in England, with an \\"ethnic rather than regional identity\\".. Structural changes to the politics of the United Kingdom, particularly the European Union and devolution, have been cited as the main stimulus to \\"a growing interest in Cornish identity and distinctiveness\\" in late-20th century Britain. The British are the citizens of the United Kingdom, a people who by convention consist of four national groups: the English, Northern Irish, Scots and Welsh. In the 1990s it was said that the notion that the Cornish are to be classified as a nation comparable to the English, Irish, Scots and Welsh, \\"has practically vanished from the popular consciousness\\" outside Cornwall, and that, despite a \\"real and substantive\\" identity, the Cornish \\"struggle for recognition as a national group distinct from the English\\". However, in 2014, after a 15-year campaign, the UK government officially recognised the Cornish as a national minority under the Council of Europe's Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, giving the Cornish the same status as the Welsh, Scots and Irish within the UK. Inhabitants of Cornwall may have multiple political allegiances, adopting mixed, dual or hyphenated identities such as \\"Cornish first and British second\\", \\"Cornish and British and European\\",. or, like Phil Vickery (a rugby union prop for the England national rugby union team and British and Irish Lions), describe themselves as \\"Cornish\\" and \\"English\\". Meanwhile, another international rugby union player, Josh Matavesi, describes himself as Cornish-Fijian and Cornish not English. A survey by Plymouth University in 2000 found that 30% of children in Cornwall felt \\"Cornish, not English\\". A 2004 survey on national identity by the finance firm Morgan Stanley found that 44% of respondents in Cornwall saw themselves as Cornish rather than British or English. A 2008 University of Exeter study conducted in 16 towns across Cornwall found that 59% felt themselves to be Cornish and 41% felt \\"More Cornish than English\\", while for over a third of respondents the Cornish identity formed their primary national identity. Genealogy and family history were considered to be the chief criteria for 'being' Cornish, particularly among those who possessed such ties, while being born in Cornwall was also held to be important. A 2008 study by the University of Edinburgh of 15- and 16-year-old schoolchildren in Cornwall found that 58% of respondents felt themselves to be either 'Fairly' or 'Very much' Cornish. The other 42% may be the result of in-migration to the area during the second half of the twentieth century. A 2010 study by the University of Exeter into the meaning of contemporary Cornish identity across Cornwall found that there was a \\"west- east distance decay in the strength of the Cornish identity.\\" The study was conducted amongst the farming community as they were deemed to be the socio- professional group most objectively representative of Cornishness. All participants categorised themselves as Cornish and identified Cornish as their primary ethnic group orientation. Those in the west primarily thought of themselves as Cornish and British/Celtic, while those in the east tended to think of themselves as Cornish and English. All participants in West Cornwall who identified as Cornish and not English described people in East Cornwall, without hesitation, as equally Cornish as themselves. Those who identified as Cornish and English stressed the primacy of their Cornishness and a capacity to distance themselves from their Englishness. Ancestry was seen as the most important criterion for being categorised as Cornish, above place of birth or growing up in Cornwall. This study supports a 1988 study by Mary McArthur that had found that the meanings of Cornishness varied substantially, from local to national identity. Both studies also observed that the Cornish were less materialistic than the English. The Cornish generally saw the English, or city people, as being \\"less friendly and more aggressively self-promoting and insensitive.\\" The Cornish saw themselves as friendly, welcoming and caring. In November 2010 British Prime Minister, David Cameron, said \\"I think Cornish national identity is very powerful\\" and that his government would \\"devolve a lot of power to Cornwall ‚Äì that will go to the Cornish unitary authority.\\" = 2011 UK Census = A poster in Cornwall telling people how to describe their ethnicity and national identity as Cornish in the 2011 census A campaign for the inclusion of a Cornish tick-box in the nationality section of the 2011 census failed to win the support of parliament in 2009. As a consequence, posters were created by the census organisation and Cornwall Council which advised residents how they could identify themselves as Cornish by writing it in the national identity and ethnicity sections and record Cornish in the main language section. Additionally, people could record Cornwall as their country of birth. Like other identities, Cornish has an allocated census code, (06), the same as for 2001, which applied and was counted throughout Britain. People were first able to record their ethnicity as Cornish in the 2001 UK Census, and some 37,000 people did so by writing it in. A total of 83,499 people in England and Wales were described as having a Cornish national identity. 59,456 of these were described as Cornish only, 6,261 as Cornish and British, and 17,782 as Cornish and at least one other identity, with or without British. Within Cornwall the total was 73,220 (14% of the population) with 52,793 (9.9%) as Cornish only, 5,185 (1%) as Cornish and British, and 15,242 (2.9%) as Cornish and at least one other identity, with or without British. In Scotland 467 people described themselves as having Cornish national identity. 254 with Cornish identity only, 39 as Scottish and Cornish, and 174 having Cornish identity and at least one other UK identity (excluding Scottish). = Schools census (PLASC) = Since 2006 school children in Cornwall have been able to record themselves as ethnically Cornish on the annual Schools Census (PLASC). Since then the number identifying as Cornish has risen from 24% to 46%. The Department for Education recommends that parents and guardians determine the ethnicity of children at primary schools whilst pupils at secondary schools can decide their own ethnicity. *2006: 23.7 percent ‚Äì 17,218 pupils out of 72,571 *2007: 27.3 percent ‚Äì 19,988 pupils out of 72,842Ethnicity breakdown from the schools census, Table: Summary of Pupils Ethnic Background in Cornwall taken at January in 2006 and 2007, Cornwall Council *2008: 30.3 percent ‚Äì 21,610 pupils out of 71,302 *2009: 33.9 percent ‚Äì 23,808 pupils out of 70,275 *2010: 37.2 percent ‚Äì 26,140 pupils out of 69,950Ethnicity breakdown from the schools census, Table: Summary of Pupils Ethnic Background in Cornwall taken at January in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Cornwall Council *2011: 40.9 percent ‚Äì 28,584 pupils out of 69,811 *2012: 43.0 percent ‚Äì 30,181 pupils out of 69,909 *2013: 46.0 percent ‚Äì 32,254 pupils out of 70,097Ethnicity breakdown from the schools census, Table: Summary of Pupils Ethnic Background in Cornwall taken at January in 2011, 2012 and 2013, Cornwall Council  History = Ancestral roots = alt=two weathered stones standing at an angle on a grassy hill, with a third doughnut-shaped stone between them Traditional accounts of Cornish ancestry teach that they are descended from the Celts making them distinct from the English, many (but not all) of whom are descended from the Anglo-Saxons who colonised Great Britain from their homelands in northern Europe and drove the Celts to Britain's western and northern fringes. However, some DNA research investigating the genetic history of the British Isles suggests that three- quarters of contemporary Y-chromosomes of British people‚Äîincluding the Cornish‚Äîoriginate from hunter-gatherers who settled in Atlantic Europe during the Paleolithic era, \\"after the melting of the ice caps but before the land broke away from the mainland and divided into islands\\". Archaeological evidence supports pre-historic human habitation in Cornwall, at least as early as the Lower Paleolithic. Although there was a separation of the British Isles from continental Europe as a consequence of the last ice age, genetic evidence indicates that the people of Great Britain broadly share a common ancestry with the Basque people who live in the Basque Country by the Pyrenees. On this basis, geneticist Stephen Oppenheimer suggests that the first settlers of Great Britain were unlikely to have spoken one of the Celtic languages, but rather an ancient tongue related to the Basque language. The next historical immigration to Great Britain occurred during the Neolithic period, interpreted by Bryan Sykes‚Äîprofessor of human genetics at the University of Oxford‚Äîas the arrival of the Celts from the Iberian Peninsula, and the origin of Britain's and Ireland's Celtic tribes. It is these people who are considered the progenitors of the Cornish. A study by the Wellcome Trust, led by Sir Walter Bodmer and published on Channel 4's Faces of Britain in April 2007, showed that the Cornish people have a particular variant of the Melanocortin 1 receptor gene, identifying them as Celts more closely related to the Welsh than to the English. Within the areas of the UK studied, this gene appeared in 26 per cent of the population of Orkney, 23 per cent of Devon, 21 per cent of Wales, 16 per cent of Cornwall, 13 per cent of Kent, and 11 per cent of North East England. According to a DNA survey carried out for the Royal Society and published in 2012 by Peter Donnelly, professor of statistical science at Oxford University and director of the Wellcome Trust genetics centre, Cornish people, along with the Welsh and people of Devon, were found to be among the most genetically distinct groups in Britain. Others in England and Britain were found to have a greater range of genetic ancestries, with people from Cornwall being distinct from those elsewhere in England and the neighbouring population of Devon, though overall still very closely related to the 'English' possibly due to their stronger genetic links to the tribes that arrived after the last ice age. However, a more recent study by Oxford University geneticist Professor Peter Donnelly suggests that the Cornish have DNA that is more similar to that of other English groups than to the Welsh or the Scots. Both Cornish and Devonians have similar but distinct genetic profiles which show less continental 'German' influence and more northern 'French' material than the English and Scots; all showing a similar portion of \\"Nordic\\" material suggesting the idea of a uniform \\"Celtic\\" genetic race is false. An 18th century map of Great Britain based on accounts from the alt=The British Isles appear on a pale and yellowed map. The isles are divided into political territories. Throughout classical antiquity the Celts spoke Celtic languages, and formed a series of tribes, cultures and identities, notably the Picts and Gaels in the north and the Britons in the south. The Britons were themselves a divided people;. although they shared the Brythonic languages, they were tribal, and divided into regional societies, and within them sub- groups. Examples of these tribal societies were the Brigantes in the north, and the Ordovices, the Demetae, the Silures and the Deceangli in the west.. In the extreme southwest, what was to become Cornwall, were the Dumnonii and Cornovii, who lived in the Kingdom of Dumnonia. The Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century introduced Romans to Britain, who upon their arrival initially recorded the Dumnonii, but later reported on the Cornovii, who were possibly a sub-group of the Dumnonii... Although the Romans colonised much of central and southern Britain, Dumnonia was \\"virtually unaffected\\" by the conquest; Roman rule had little or no impact on the region, meaning it could flourish as a semi- or fully independent kingdom which evidence shows was sometimes under the dominion of the kings of the Britons, and sometimes to have been governed by its own Dumnonian monarchy, either by the title of duke or king. This petty kingdom shared strong linguistic, political and cultural links with Brittany, a peninsula on continental Europe south of Cornwall inhabited by Britons; the Cornish and Breton languages were nearly indistinguishable in this period, and both Cornwall and Brittany remain dotted with dedications to the same Celtic saints. The Sack of Rome in the year 410 prompted a complete Roman departure from Britain, and Cornwall then experienced an influx of Celtic Christian missionaries from Ireland who had a profound effect upon the early Cornish people, their culture, faith and architecture. The ensuing decline of the Roman Empire encouraged the Anglo- Saxon invasion of Britain. The Angles, Jutes, Frisii and Saxons, Germanic peoples from northern Europe, established petty kingdoms and settled in different regions of what was to become England, and parts of southern Scotland, progressively defeating the Britons in battle. The Saxons of the Kingdom of Wessex in particular were expanding their territory westwards towards Cornwall. The Cornish were frequently embattled with the West Saxons, who used their Germanic word walha (modern English: Welsh) meaning \\"stranger\\" or \\"foreigner\\", to describe their opponents, later specifying them as the Westwalas (West Welsh) or Cornwalas (the Cornish). Conflict continued until King Athelstan of England determined that the River Tamar be the formal boundary between the West Saxons and the Cornish in the year 936,. making Cornwall one of the last retreats of the Britons encouraging the development of a distinct Cornish identity; Brittonic culture in Britain became confined to Cornwall, parts of Devon, North West England, South West Scotland and Wales. Although a treaty was agreed, Anglo-Saxon political influence stretched westwards until some time in the late 10th century when \\"Cornwall was definitively incorporated into the Kingdom of England\\". = Anglicisation and rebellion = European nations in AD 998 The Norman conquest of England, which began with an invasion by the troops of William, Duke of Normandy (later, King William I of England) in 1066, resulted in the removal of the Anglo-Saxon derived monarchy, aristocracy, and clerical hierarchy and its replacement by Normans, Scandinavian Vikings from northern France. and their Breton allies, who, in many cases, maintained rule in the Brittonic-speaking parts of the conquered lands. The shires of England were progressively divided amongst the companions of William I of England, who served as England's new nobility. The English would come to absorb the Normans,. but the Cornish \\"vigorously resisted\\" their influence. At the time of the conquest, Cornwall was under the governance of Cadoc of Cornwall, the last Earl of Cornwall to be directly descended from the ancient monarchy of Cornwall.. The Earldom of Cornwall had held devolved semi-sovereignty from England,.. but in 1067 was granted to Robert, Count of Mortain, King William I's half-brother, and ruled thereafter by an Anglo-Norman aristocracy;. in the Domesday Book, the record of the great survey of England completed in 1086, \\"virtually all\\" landowners in Cornwall \\"had English names, making it impossible to be sure who was Cornish and who was English by race\\".. However, there was a persistent and \\"continuing differentiation\\" between the English and Cornish peoples during the Middle Ages, as evidenced by documents such as the 1173 charter of Truro which made explicit mention of both peoples as distinct. The Earldom of Cornwall passed to various English nobles throughout the High Middle Ages,. but in 1337 the earldom was given the status of a duchy, and Edward, the Black Prince, the first son and heir of King Edward III of England, became the first Duke of Cornwall as a means for the prince to raise his own capital. Large parts of Cornwall were owned by Edward, 1st Duke of Cornwall, and successive English Dukes of Cornwall became the largest landowners in Cornwall; The monarchy of England established two special administrative institutions in Cornwall, the first being the Duchy of Cornwall (one of only two in the Kingdom of England)The other being the Duchy of Lancaster from 1354 and the second being the Cornish Stannary Courts and Parliaments (which governed Cornwall's tin industry). These two institutions allowed \\"ordinary Cornish people to believe that they had been granted a unique constitutional status to reflect their unique cultural identity\\". However, the Duchy of Cornwall gradually lost its political autonomy from England, a state which became increasingly centralised in London, and by the early-Tudor period the Cornish had begun to see themselves as \\"a conquered people whose culture, liberties, and prosperity had been downgraded by the English\\". This view was exacerbated in the 1490s by heavy taxation imposed by King Henry VII of England upon the impoverished Cornish to raise funds for his military campaigns against King James IV of Scotland and Perkin Warbeck,. as well as Henry VII's suspension of the privileges of the Cornish Stannaries. Having provided \\"more than their fair share of soldiers and sailors\\" for the conflict in northern England, and feeling aggrieved at \\"Cornwall's status as England's poorest county\\", a popular uprising out of Cornwall ensued‚Äîthe Cornish Rebellion of 1497. The rebellion was initially a political march from St Keverne to London led by Thomas Flamank and Michael An Gof, motivated by a \\"mixture of reasons\\"; to raise money for charity; to celebrate their community; to present their grievances to the Parliament of England, but gathered pace across the West Country as a revolt against the king.. The Cornish language experienced a shift between 1300 and 1750, with the Cornish people gradually adopting English as their common language. Cornish was the most widely spoken language west of the River Tamar until around the mid-1300s, when Middle English began to be adopted as a common language of the Cornish people. As late as 1542 Andrew Boorde, an English traveller, physician and writer, wrote that in Cornwall there were two languages, \\"Cornysshe\\" and \\"Englysshe\\", but that \\"there may be many men and women\\" in Cornwall who could not understand English. While the Norman language was in use by much of the English aristocracy, Cornish was used as a lingua franca, particularly in the remote far west of Cornwall.. Many Cornish landed gentry chose mottos in the Cornish language for their coat of arms, highlighting its socially high status.. However, in 1549 and following the English Reformation, King Edward VI of England commanded that the Book of Common Prayer, an Anglican liturgical text in the English language, should be introduced to all churches in his kingdom, meaning that Latin and Celtic customs and services should be discontinued. The Prayer Book Rebellion was a militant revolt in Cornwall and parts of neighbouring Devon against the Act of Uniformity 1549, which outlawed all languages from church services apart from English,. and is specified as a testament to the affection and loyalty the Cornish people held for the Cornish language. In the rebellion, separate risings occurred simultaneously in Bodmin in Corwall, and Sampford Courtenay in Devon‚Äîwhich would both converge at Exeter, laying siege to the region's largest Protestant city.. However, the rebellion was suppressed, thanks largely to the aid of foreign mercenaries in a series of battles in which \\"hundreds were killed\\", effectively ending Cornish as the common language of the Cornish people. The Anglicanism of the Reformation served as a vehicle for Anglicisation in Cornwall; Protestantism had a lasting cultural effect upon the Cornish by way of linking Cornwall more closely with England, while lessening political and linguistic ties with the Bretons of Brittany.. The English Civil War, a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians and Royalists, polarised the populations of England and Wales. However, Cornwall in the English Civil War was a staunchly Royalist enclave, an \\"important focus of support for the Royalist cause\\".. Cornish soldiers were used as scouts and spies during the war, for their language was not understood by English Parliamentarians. The peace that followed the close of the war led to a further shift to the English language by the Cornish people, which encouraged an influx of English people to Cornwall. By the mid-17th century the use of the Cornish language had retreated far enough west to prompt concern and investigation by antiquarians, such as William Scawen. As the Cornish language diminished the people of Cornwall underwent a process of English enculturation and assimilation, becoming \\"absorbed into the mainstream of English life\\". = Industry, revival and the modern period = The National Tartan of Cornwall. Cornish kilts and tartans are emblematic of a resurgent, pan-Celtic Cornish identity developed during Cornwall's Celtic Revival.. The Industrial Revolution had a major impact upon the Cornish people. Cornwall's economy was fully integrated into England's,. and mining in Cornwall, always an important source of employment and stability of the Cornish, experienced a process of industrialisation resulting in 30 per cent of Cornwall's adult population being employed by its mines. During this period, efforts were made by Cornish engineers to design steam engines with which to power water pumps for Cornish mines thus aiding the extraction of mineral ore.. Industrial scale tin and copper mining operations in Cornwall melded Cornish identity with engines and heavy industry,. and Cornwall's leading mining engineer, Richard Trevithick, became \\"as much a part of Cornwall's heritage as any legendary giant from its Celtic past\\".. Trevithick's most significant success was a high-pressure steam engine used to pump water and refuse from mines, but he was also the builder of the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive. On 21 February 1804, the world's first locomotive-hauled railway journey took place as Trevithick's unnamed steam locomotive hauled a train along the tramway of the Penydarren ironworks, near Merthyr Tydfil in Wales. The construction of the Great Western Railway during the Victorian era allowed for an influx of tourists to Cornwall from across Great Britain. Well into the Edwardian era and interwar period, Cornwall was branded as a rural retreat, a \\"primitive land of magic and romance\\", and as an \\"earlier incarnation of Englishness, a place more English than an England ravaged by modernity\\".. Cornwall, the United Kingdom's only region with a subtropical-like climate, became a centre for English tourism, its coastline dominated by resort towns increasingly composed of bungalows and villas. Tourists visiting Cornwall are called emmets by locals, a Cornish language word for insects, referring to the creatures that the visitors resemble when swarming Cornwall's resorts. John Nichols Thom, or Mad Tom, (1799 ‚Äì 31 May 1838) was a Cornishman self-declared messiah who, in the 19th century led the last battle to be fought on English soil, known as the Battle of Bossenden Wood. While not akin to the Cornish rebellions of the past, he did attract some Cornish support as well as mostly Kentish labourers, although his support was primarily of religious followers. In the latter half of the 19th century Cornwall experienced rapid deindustrialisation, with the closure of mines in particular considered by the Cornish to be both an economic and cultural disaster. This, coupled with the rise of Romantic nationalism in Europe inspired and influenced a Celtic Revival in Cornwall, a social, linguistic and artistic movement interested in Cornish medieval ethnology. This Revivalist upsurge investigated Cornwall's pre-industrial culture, using the Cornish language as the \\"principal badge of [Cornish] nationality and ethnic kinship\\". The first effective revival of Cornish began in 1904 when Henry Jenner, a Celtic language enthusiast, published his book Handbook of the Cornish Language. His orthography, Unified Cornish, was based on Cornish as it was spoken in the 18th century, although his pupil Robert Morton Nance later steered the revival more towards the Middle Cornish that had been used in the 16th century, before the language became influenced by English. The visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 reinvigorated Scottish national identity, melding it with romanticist notions of tartan, kilts and the Scottish Highlands.. As Pan-Celticism gathered pace in the early 20th century, Cornishman L. C. R. Duncombe-Jewell and the Cowethas Kelto-Kernuak (a Cornish language interest group) asserted the use of Cornish kilts and tartans as a \\"national dress ... common to all Celtic countries\\".. In 1924 the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies was formed to facilitate, preserve and maintain Celticity in Cornwall,. followed by the similar Gorseth Kernow in 1928,. and the formation of the Cornish nationalist political party Mebyon Kernow in 1951. Increased interest and communication across the Celtic nations in Celtic languages and culture during the 1960s and 1970s spurred on the popularisation of the Cornish self-government movement. Since devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, enthusiasts for Cornish culture have pressed for the Cornish language to be taught formally in Cornish schools, while Cornish nationalists have demanded greater political autonomy for Cornwall, for example that it be constituted as the United Kingdom's fifth consistuent country with its own Cornish Assembly.  Geographic distribution  Cornish miners in the mid-19th century. A demise in mining in Cornwall prompted an exodus of Cornish miners and families resulting in a displaced Cornish diaspora. The Cornish people are concentrated in Cornwall, but after the Age of Discovery in the early modern period were involved in the British colonisation of the Americas and other transcontinental and transatlantic migrations. Initially, the number of migrants was comparatively small, with those who left Cornwall typically settling in North America or else amongst the ports and plantations of the Caribbean. In the first half of the 19th century, the Cornish people were leaders in tin and copper smelting, while mining in Cornwall was the people's major occupation. Increased competition from Australia, British Malaya and Bolivia, coupled with the depletion of mineral deposits brought about an economic decline for Cornish mining lasting half a century, and prompting mass human migration from Cornwall. In each decade from 1861 to 1901, \\"around 20% of the Cornish male population migrated abroad\\"‚Äîthree times that of the average of England and Wales‚Äîand totalling over a quarter of a million people lost to emigration between 1841 and 1901. There was a displacement of skilled Cornish engineers, farmers, merchants, miners and tradesmen, but their commercial and occupational expertise, particularly in hard rock mining, was highly valued by the communities they met. Within Great Britain, Cornish families were attracted from Cornwall to North East England‚Äîparticularly on Teesside‚Äîto partake in coal mining as a means to earn wealth by using their mining skill. This has resulted in a concentration of Cornish names on and around Teesside that persists into the 21st century. Large numbers of the 19th century Cornish emigrants eventually returned to Cornwall, whilst the rate of emigration from Cornwall declined after World War I.. However, the global connections of the remaining Cornish diaspora, which is concentrated in English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada, South Africa and the United States, are \\"very strong\\". Their outreach has contributed to the international spread of Methodism, a movement within Protestant Christianity that was popular with the Cornish people at the time of their mass migration.. \\"Cousin Jacks\\" is a nickname for the overseas Cornish, thought to derive from the practice of Cornishmen asking if job vacancies could be filled by their cousin named Jack in Cornwall. = Australia = William \\"Harold\\" Oliver was the son of Australian Cornish immigrants who lived in the mining town of Waukaringa. Harold Oliver was a three time national champion with the Port Adelaide Football Club in 1910, 1913 and 1914. From the beginning of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up a large majority of people coming to Australia, meaning that many Australian-born people can trace their origins to Britain. The Cornish people in particular were actively encouraged to emigrate to Australia following the demise of Cornish mining in the 19th century. A \\"vigorous recruiting campaign\\" was launched to encourage the Cornish to aid with mining in Australia because of their experience and expertise.. Free passage to South Australia in particular was granted to hundreds of Cornish miners and their families, so much so, that a large Cornish community gathered in Australia's Copper Coast, and South Australia's Yorke Peninsula became known as \\"Little Cornwall\\". It has been estimated between 1837 and 1840, 15 per cent of all assisted migrants to South Australia were Cornish. Cornish settlement impacted upon social, cultural and religious life throughout the history of South Australia. Cornish identity was embraced strongly in the Yorke Peninsula, but also in the more outlying mining towns of Kapunda and Burra, where Cornish miners constituted a sizeable community.. Methodism, was the main form of religious practice for the Cornish. Methodist sensibilities were held with strong conviction by the migrant Cornish in a direct rivalry with Catholic Irish people in Australia. The Kernewek Lowender is the largest Cornish festival in the world, held in the Kadina, Moonta and Wallaroo towns on the Yorke Peninsula, which attracts tens of thousands of visitors bi-annually.. = Canada = European fishing ventures in and around Newfoundland during the 16th century were the earliest Cornish activity in what was to become Canada. However, permanent settlement by the Cornish across the Atlantic Ocean was rare until at least the 19th century. The British colonisation of the Americas encouraged additional migration of the Cornish to the Canadas, particularly by those who served in Great Britain's Royal Navy. The creation of the colony of British North America spurred more people from Cornwall to settle in North America; they were registered as English migrants. Many Cornish (and other West Country) immigrants who had been agricultural labourers settled in an area of what is now South Central Ontario in what were the counties of Northumberland, Durham and Ontario, ranging from the towns of Port Hope and Cobourg in the east, to Whitby in the west and to the north ends of those counties.Source: *Encyclopedia of Canada's Peoples; Paul Robert Magocsi, editor, University of Toronto Press for Multicultural History Society of Ontario, 1999 = Mexico = A silver mining museum in Mineral del Monte, a remnant of the Cornish migration to Mexico during the early-19th century. In 1825 a band of 60 Cornishmen left Falmouth for Mineral del Monte in central Mexico with of mining machinery with which to apply their mining skill and technologies to resuscitate Mexico's ailing silver mining industry after the neglect caused by the Mexican War of Independence. Following their sea voyage they attempted to dock at Veracruz but were forced away by the Spanish to a beach at Mocambo from where they hauled their machinery through jungle and swamp to Santa Fe. During this haul through the jungle, the Cornishmen and their Mexican helpers fell victim to yellow fever, resulting in 30 Cornish and 100 Mexican fatalities. The fever forced the survivors to abandon their equipment and head inland up into the mountains to Xalapa to try and escape the mosquitos for three months, until the end of the rainy season. Once the rainy season closed the Cornish and Mexican miners continued their \\"Great Trek\\" to Mineral del Monte, transporting their machinery to an altitude of above sea level and arriving at their destination on 1 May 1826. Following their arrival, the Cornish community flourished and stayed in central Mexico until the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Although the Cornish community in Mexico broadly returned to Cornwall, they left a cultural legacy; Cornish pasties, Cornish mining museums and a Cornish Mexican Cultural Society are all part of the local heritage and tradition in and around Mineral del Monte. = South Africa = The Witwatersrand Gold Rush of 1886 encouraged large numbers of Cornish miners to migrate to the South African Republic.. Although an international gold rush, the Cornish overwhelmingly formed the skilled labour force in the Witwatersrand, until the outbreak of the Second Boer War prompted a retreat. = United States = The discovery of lead ore and copper in North America prompted an influx of Cornish miners to the continent, particularly around the Upper Mississippi River. By the early 19th century Cornish people were present in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan‚Äîparticularly the mining town of Ishpeming... Additional waves of Cornish migrants followed the California Gold Rush of the mid-19th century; in the 1890s it was estimated that in California's Grass Valley, over 60 per cent of the population was Cornish. It has a tradition of carols stemming from the Cornish who settled the area as gold miners in the 19th century. The carols have become \\"the identity of the town\\", some of the members of the Grass Valley Cornish Carol Choir are descendants of the original Cornish settlers. Most migratory Cornish to the United States were classified as English or British, meaning that the precise number of Cornish Americans is difficult to estimate. The aggregate number of immigrants from Cornwall to the United States before World War I is suggested to be around 100,000.  Culture  St. Piran's Day is an annual patronal Cornish festival celebrating Cornish culture and history every 5 March. The survival of a distinct Cornish culture has been attributed to Cornwall's geographic isolation. Contemporaneously, the underlying notion of Cornish culture is that it is distinct from the culture of England, despite its anglicisation, and that it is instead part of a Celtic tradition. According to American academic Paul Robert Magocsi, modern-day Cornish activists have claimed several Victorian era inventions including the Cornish engine, Christmas carols, rugby football and brass bands as part of this Cornish tradition. Cornish cultural tradition is most strongly associated with the people's most historical occupation, mining,. an aspect of Cornish history and culture that has influenced its cuisine, symbols and identity. The Cornish writer C. C. Vyvyan wrote in her 1948 book Our Cornwall: \\"A man might live and die among us and never gain throughout his allotted span of life one glimpse of the essential Cornwall or the essential Cornishman.\\"Vyvyan, C. C. (1948) Our Cornwall. London: Westaway Books; p. 29 Cornwall has its own tradition of Christian saints, derived from Celtic extraction, that have given rise to localised dedications. Saint Piran is the 5th century Christian abbot, supposedly of Irish origin, who is patron saint of both tin miners and Cornwall. According to popular mythology, Piran, an Irish scholar who studied Christianity in Ancient Rome was to be drowned in the Irish Sea by the High Kings of Ireland, but instead floated across to Perranporth in Cornwall by the will of God to preach the ministry of Jesus. Saint Piran's Flag, a centred white cross on a black field, was described as the \\"Standard of Cornwall\\" in 1838 and was re-introduced by Celtic Revivalists thereafter as a county flag of Cornwall. It has been seized upon by the Cornish people as a symbol of their identity, displayed on cars and flying from buildings including those of Cornwall Council. St Piran's Day is an annual patronal f√™te, and the pre- eminent Cornish festival celebrating Cornish culture and history on 5 March. = Language = A welcome sign to Penzance, in the English and Cornish languages A Cornish speaker, recorded in the United Kingdom for Wikitongues. The Cornish language is derived from the Brythonic branch of the Insular Celtic languages. It is closely related to the Breton language, and to a lesser extent shares commonalities with the Welsh language,. although they are not mutually intelligible.. The language functioned as a community language in Cornwall until a language shift to the English language was completed during the late 18th century. The demise of the Cornish language is attributed to English cultural influence, particularly the political and religious dominance of the English Reformation and the Act of Uniformity 1549 which outlawed all church services within the Kingdom of England that were not in English. The exact date of the death of using the Cornish language is unclear and disputed, but popularly it is claimed that the last monolingual Cornish speaker was Dolly Pentreath, a Mousehole resident who died in 1777... The revival of Cornish began in 1904 when Henry Jenner, a Celtic language enthusiast, published his book Handbook of the Cornish Language.. He based his work on Cornish as it was spoken in the 18th century, although his pupil Robert Morton Nance, with his orthography, Unified Cornish, later steered the revival more towards the Middle Cornish that had been used in the 16th century, before the language became more heavily influenced by English.. This set the tone for the next few decades; as the revival gained pace, learners of the language disagreed on which style of Cornish to use, and a number of competing orthographies‚ÄîUnified Cornish, Unified Cornish Revised, Modern Cornish, Kernewek Kemmyn‚Äîwere in use by the end of the 20th century. A standard written form was agreed in 2008. Cornish is a restored and living modern language, but most of its speakers are enthusiasts, persons who have learned the language through private study. Cornish speakers are geographically dispersed, meaning there is no part of Cornwall where it is spoken as a community language. As of 2009, it is taught in fifty primary schools, although regular broadcast in Cornish is limited to a weekly bilingual programme on BBC Radio Cornwall.. Daily life in Cornwall therefore is conducted in the English language, albeit with some regional peculiarities. Legends of the Fall, a novella by American author Jim Harrison, detailing the lives of a Cornish American family in the early 20th century, contains several Cornish language terms. These were also included in the Academy Award winning film of the same name starring Anthony Hopkins as Col. William Ludlow and Brad Pitt as Tristan Ludlow. = Literature and folklore = Early medieval Cornwall was associated with the Matter of Britain, a national myth recounting a legendary Celtic history of Brittonic warriors, including King Arthur.. The Matter of Britain was supported by texts such as the Historia Regum Britanniae, a pseudohistorical account of the history of the ancient Britons, written in the mid-12th century by Geoffrey of Monmouth.. The Historia Regum Britanniae chronicled the lives of legendary kings of the Britons in a narrative spanning a time of two thousand years, beginning with the Trojans founding the ancient British nation and continuing until the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain in the 5th century forced the Celtic Britons to the west coast, namely Wales and Cornwall. Although broadly thought of as a work of fiction, Geoffrey of Monmouth's work had a lasting effect upon the identity of the Cornish.. His \\"historical construct\\" characterised the ancient Britons as heroes, which later helped Celtic revivalists to redefine Cornishness as an identity closely related to ancient heroic Celtic folklore. Another strand of Cornish folklore is derived from tales of seafaring pirates and smugglers who thrived in and around Cornwall from the early modern period through to the 19th century. Cornish pirates exploited both their knowledge of the Cornish coastline as well as its sheltered creeks and hidden anchorages. For many fishing villages, loot and contraband provided by pirates supported a strong and secretive underground economy in Cornwall. Legendary creatures that appear in Cornish folklore include buccas, knockers and piskies.. Tales of these creatures are thought to have developed as supernatural explanations for the frequent and deadly cave-ins that occurred during 18th-century Cornish tin mining, or else a creation of the oxygen-starved minds of exhausted miners who returned from the underground. = Performing and visual arts = The 'Obby 'Oss festival is a Cornish May Day festival celebrated in Padstow. Celtic crosses, many dating from between the 7th and 15th centuries, are found in Cornwall and have been used as inspiration in modern and contemporary Cornish visual arts. In the 1780s, John Opie was the first Cornish-born painter to gain widespread attention; his work was exhibited at the Royal Academy and he was described by Joshua Reynolds as \\"like Caravaggio and Vel√°zquez in one\\". Artists who appreciated the quality of Cornwall's natural light, such as J. M. W. Turner, began to visit, with more following after the opening of the Great Western Railway, including Whistler and Sickert. Stanhope Forbes and Frank Bramley settled in Cornwall in the 1880s, establishing the Newlyn School of painting en plein air. By the 1920s, the ceramicist Bernard Leach was established at St Ives, and the St Ives School for abstract artists formed there, influenced by naive painters such as Alfred Wallis, and involving the work of Ben Nicholson, his wife Barbara Hepworth, Naum Gabo and Patrick Heron. = Religion = Anciently, the religion of the Cornish Britons was Celtic polytheism, a pagan, animistic faith, assumed to be led by Druids in full or in part.. Early Christianity is thought to have existed in Cornwall during the 1st century, but limited to individual travellers and visitors, possibly including Priscillian, a Galician theologian who may have been exiled to the Isles of Scilly. Celtic Christianity was introduced to Cornwall in the year 520 by Saint Petroc, a Brython from the kingdom of Glywysing, and other missionaries from Wales, as well as by Gaelic monks and holy women from Ireland; this \\"formative period\\" has left a legacy of granite high cross monuments throughout Cornwall. Dedications to many different Cornish saints can also be traced to this period. In the Middle Ages, Roman Catholicism was dominant in Cornwall, and even in the 17th century the Cornish were \\"fervently Roman Catholic\\", slow to accept the Protestant Reformation, according to some scholars.. The adoption of Anglicanism was, eventually, near-universal in Cornwall and facilitated the anglicisation of the Cornish people. A variety of dissenting congregations such as the Quakers and Baptists were to be found in certain districts. Through a combination of tours of Cornwall by John Wesley, rural isolation and compatibility with Cornish tastes and sensibilities, Methodism, an evangelical revival movement within the Church of England, became the form of Christianity practised by the majority of the population all over Cornwall during the 19th century.. During this time other kinds of Methodist churches appeared such as the Bible Christians and there were also Evangelical and Anglo-Catholic revivals within the Church of England. = Cuisine = Cornish pasty Cornish cuisine is a regional variety of British cuisine, strongly rooted in a tradition of using local produce,. which is used to create relatively simple dishes.. Most prominent in Cornish cuisine is the pasty (sometimes known as the Cornish pasty) made from diced beef, potato, onion and swede (commonly called 'turnip' by the Cornish), enclosed within a pastry crust and then baked.. One idea of its origins suggests that it evolved as a portable lunch for Cornish miners, the crust serving as a disposable handle that could be held by a miner's hand without soiling the filling. Fish was an important element of the Cornish diet, but international commercial fishing was also well established by the 16th century, and tons of pilchards were exported from Cornwall to France, Italy and Spain every year. Stargazy pie is an occasional festive Cornish dish with the heads of fish standing on their tails, originally pilchards, piercing a pastry crust. The saffron bun, also known as the tea treat bun, is a sweet bread with its origins in Cornwall. = Sport = Cornish wrestling is a contact sport, a style of folk martial arts, that has its origins in Cornwall With its comparatively small, rural population, major contribution by the Cornish to national sport in the United Kingdom has been limited.. There are no teams affiliated to the Cornwall County Football Association that play in the Football League of England and Wales, and the Cornwall County Cricket Club plays as one of the minor counties of English cricket. Viewed as an \\"important identifier of ethnic affiliation\\", rugby union has become a sport strongly tied with notions of Cornishness,. and since the 20th century, rugby union in Cornwall has emerged as one of the most popular spectator and team sports in Cornwall, with professional Cornish rugby footballers being described as a \\"formidable force\\", \\"naturally independent, both in thought and deed, yet paradoxically staunch English patriots whose top players have represented England with pride and passion\\". In 1985, sports journalist Alan Gibson made a direct connection between love of rugby in Cornwall and the ancient parish games of hurling and wrestling that existed for centuries before rugby officially began. Cornish wrestling (also known as Wrasslin') is a regional, folk style of grappling or martial arts. The Cornish Wrestling Association was formed in 1923, to standardise the rules of the sport and to promote Cornish wrestling throughout Cornwall and the world. Together with Cornish hurling (a localised form of medieval football), Wrasslin' has been promoted as a distinctly Celtic game, tied closely with Cornish identity. Surfing was popularised in Cornwall during the late 20th century, and has since become readily associated with Cornishness. The waves around the Cornish coastline are created by low pressure systems from the Atlantic Ocean which unleash powerful swells eastwards creating multiple, excellent surfing conditions in some parts of the coast of Cornwall. Newquay, one of Britain's \\"premier surfing towns\\", regularly hosts world championship surfing events.  Institutions and politics  The surviving part of the former Duchy Palace in Lostwithiel, the former administrative seat of the Duke of Cornwall from c.1265 to 1874. The Old County Hall in Truro, the former seat of Cornwall Council. The politics of Cornwall take place within a wider national political framework of a constitutional monarchy, in which the United Kingdom's monarch is head of state and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is the head of government, and the supranational framework of the European Union. Cornish politics are marked by a long tradition of Liberalism. Important historical institutions were the Duchy of Cornwall and the Cornish Stannary Courts and Parliaments. The Stannary court administered equity, through special laws and legal exemptions, for all matters relating to the tin mines and tin trade in Cornwall. Cornish miners were effectively exempt from the jurisdiction of the law courts at Westminster, except \\"in such cases as should affect land, life or limb\\". The ancient privileges of the Stannary Courts and Parliaments were confirmed by successive Royal Charters in the Middle Ages, including those administered by Kings John, Edward I and Edward III of England. As the tin mines of Cornwall lost their economic importance during the 18th and 19th centuries, so the Stannary institutions lost political power. The last Stannary parliament was held at Truro in 1752, and continued, by adjournments, until 11 September 1753. As in the rest of Great Britain, the Liberal Party dominated Cornish politics during the 19th century,. although Socialism gained limited support in western Cornwall,. and the Labour Party won preference after World War I.. Nationalism (or regionalism). in Cornwall traces its roots to the Irish Home Rule bills of the late 19th century, and is represented by the Cornish self-government movement, a political action group that is predominantly organised to promote Cornwall as the national homeland of the Cornish, campaign for devolution, and win it the status as a fifth country within the UK rather than outright separatism. More \\"militant\\" variants of Cornish nationalism however claim that because of historical constitutional peculiarities regarding the status of Cornwall, the law of the European Union does or should not have jurisdiction over Cornwall until Cornish sovereignty is recognised. Popularisation of Cornish nationalism is attributed to a Celtic cultural revival in Cornwall which itself began with a renewed interest in the Cornish language in the 1920s.. The revival of the Cornish language encouraged a parallel revival of Celtic traditions, which by the 1970s had spurred on Cornish nationalism. The United Kingdom's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973 prompted claims that the Cornish should be granted their own devolved national assembly‚Äîthe Cornish Assembly‚Äîcomparable to that of the National Assembly for Wales. Mebyon Kernow is a left-wing political party based in Cornwall, founded in 1951. Its main objective is attaining greater autonomy for Cornwall through the establishment of a legislative Cornish Assembly. As at 2009 Mebyon Kernow has no Members of Parliament elected to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, and in the 2009 United Kingdom local elections received 4 per cent of votes to elect councillors to Cornwall Council, behind the Conservative Party (34 per cent), Liberal Democrats (28 per cent), and Independents (23 per cent) Since the 2009 structural changes to local government in England, Cornwall Council has been a unitary authority, serving as the sole executive, deliberative, and legislative body responsible for local policy, setting council tax, and allocating budgets. Following the Cornwall Council election in May 2013, the council remained as \\"no overall control\\", with the Independent politicians becoming the largest grouping on the council through a modest gain of councillors from the previous election. The Liberal Democrats remained the second largest party after losing 2 councillors and the Conservatives slipped to third after losing over a third of their councillors. The Labour Party (+8), UKIP (+6), and the Green Party (+1) all gained seats, with UKIP and the Greens entering Cornwall Council for the first time. Mebyon Kernow had 6 councilors prior to the election, having added 2 since the 2009 election, their total following the election was reduced to 4. In the 2015 general election all Cornish seats were won by the Conservatives. This was repeated in the 2017 general election. In the UK's 2021 census plans, a \\"tickbox\\" for claiming \\"Cornish\\" as a national minority status has not been implemented and is under debate. Since Cornwall was officially given \\"official national minority status\\" in 2014, the Cornwall Council's Party Leaders have submitted a letter to the cabinet office of Chloe Smith for the Minister of State. In the coming weeks, Parliament is set to debate The Census Order. If enough Members of Parliament side with the Cornish people and stand in solidarity with their cause, a box to select a \\"Cornish\\" identity could be added‚Äîreaffirming the official identity they established 6 years prior.

The pilot film, Salvage, was shown on January 20, 1979, to high ratings. Plot The pilot centers on Harry Broderick (Andy Griffith) who owns the Jettison Scrap and Salvage Co. and is a specialist in reclaiming trash and junk to sell as scrap. His dream is to recover equipment left on the Moon during Apollo Program missions. In the show's opening title narration, Harry states: > \\"I wanna build a spaceship, go to the Moon, salvage all the junk that's up > there, bring it back and sell it.\\" He invites the former astronaut Addison \\"Skip\\" Carmichael (Joel Higgins) and NASA fuel expert Melanie \\"Mel\\" Slozar (Trish Stewart) to assist him in this effort. During Slozar's fuel experiments, the Federal Bureau of Investigation becomes concerned over the purchases of chemicals. Broderick and his ragtag crew complete their mission and go on to further adventures in the subsequent series. A recurring subplot drives numerous attempts to find the appropriate explosive mixture to break an iceberg from the Arctic Shelf, to be transported to the California coast as a source of fresh water. Richard Jaeckel had a recurring role as Jack Klinger, the FBI agent tasked with keeping an eye on Broderick and his associates. Their relationship is generally rocky, but the Salvage crew fly to his rescue when he is captured during a mission to a Latin American dictatorship. =The Vulture= Harry builds a spaceship dubbed Vulture, made completely from reclaimed salvage and powered by a chemical called monohydrazine. The main body of Vulture is composed of a Texaco gasoline semi-trailer tank truck with a cement mixer as the capsule.

She was portrayed by Bette Davis in the 1962 film adaptation and by Lynn Redgrave in the 1991 made- for-television remake. The 1962 production is the better-known, with Bette Davis earning an Academy Award nomination for her performance. The character is portrayed by Susan Sarandon, who plays Bette Davis, in the TV anthology Feud: Bette and Joan aired in 2017. Novel and film At the start of the book, Baby Jane Hudson is a highly successful child star in vaudeville, billed as \\"The Diminutive Dancing Duse from Duluth\\". In the film version, a prologue set in 1917 shows her performing with her father while her mother and sister Blanche watch from backstage. She is favored and spoiled by her father, while her mother attempts to soothe Blanche's envy and resentment by promising that one day she will achieve stardom. The novel reveals that, when both parents die in the late-1910s flu pandemic, the sisters move to Hollywood to live with an aunt who favors Blanche the way their father prefers Jane. (This detail is absent in the film.) By the mid-1930s, Blanche and Jane are Hollywood actresses. Blanche is a successful star, while Jane gets film work only because her sister's contract demands it. Blanche is the leading lady of her era, but Jane is widely seen as a has-been, and her films are critical and commercial failures. One night, an inebriated Jane mocks and humiliates Blanche at a party, provoking Blanche into leaving in tears. That night, Blanche is paralyzed from the waist down in a mysterious car accident that is unofficially blamed on Jane, who is found three days later in a drunken stupor with no memory of the party and its aftermath. The accident ends Blanche and Jane's careers. Jane spends the next three decades living with and caring for Blanche, stoking bitter resentment which consumes her. Over the years, Jane sinks into alcoholism and mental illness. She is now a grotesque caricature of her childhood self, wearing hideously caked-on make-up, her hair in greasy curls, and dressing like a 10-year-old girl. A television retrospective honoring Blanche's old films sends Jane into a jealous rage as she realizes that she is no longer the ingenue she once was. Jane is driven to desperation by the combination of the increased attention towards Blanche and her discovery that Blanche plans to sell the house and have her committed to a mental hospital. Delusional and stuck in the past, she clings to hopes of reviving her childhood act, even though she is approaching old age. She steals Blanche's money to pay for an accompanist and for adult-sized versions of her little-girl costumes. She removes Blanche's telephone, making her a virtual prisoner in her room. Jane gets drunk and pathetically sings her signature song, \\"I've Written a Letter to Daddy\\", a maudlin song from her childhood act. However, upon seeing her reflection and the ravages of age and alcoholism, Jane snaps and destroys the mirror. She kills Blanche's pet parakeet and serves it to her on a dinner platter; she later serves Blanche a dead rat the same way. When Blanche's cleaning woman, Elvira Stitt, threatens to report Jane's abuses, Jane kills her with a hammer and disposes of the dead body. After the police call about Elvira, whose family has reported her missing, Jane worries that she will be caught. When Edwin Flagg, the accompanist she hires to revive her Baby Jane act, discovers Blanche bound and gagged in the bedroom, he calls the police and Jane flees to the seashore with Blanche. On the beach, a near-death Blanche reveals that she is paraplegic by her own fault: she intended to kill Jane by running her down, but her car struck the metal gates outside their mansion instead, snapping Blanche's spine. Blanche blamed the accident on Jane, who was too drunk to remember the incident. This revelation destroys what little remains of Jane's sanity, and she regresses to her childhood and becomes \\"Baby Jane\\" once again, dancing for startled on- lookers at the beach. When two policemen notice the Hudsons' illegally parked car nearby and link it to Elvira's death, they spot Blanche lying on the sand and rush to her aid. Jane is too caught up in her delusions to notice the policemen's presence. Acting In this film, director Robert Aldrich mined the careers of his two stars, Bette Davis and Joan Crawford (who played Blanche), by using their early (circa 1930s) film clips when the story called for examples of their characters' work. The other characters react to clips of Bette Davis's early roles with dismay at her \\"bad acting\\", and when clips of Joan Crawford's old movies are shown the other characters speak with praise for her acting. (Davis's scenes, from the film Ex-Lady, are deliberately presented out of context to make Jane Hudson's performance seem amateurish.)

Burow was also the inventor of some plastic surgery and wound healing techniques which are still in wide use today. Use=Otitis= Burow's solution may be used to treat various forms of ear infections, known as otitis. As a drug it is inexpensive and non-ototoxic. In cases of otomycosis it is less effective than clotrimazole but remains an effective treatment. =Skin irritation= Most versions of Burow's solution can be used as a soak or compress. As an FDA approved astringent it is used for the relief of skin irritations due to poison ivy, oak and sumac, and rashes from allergic reactions to soaps, detergents, cosmetics and jewelry.

The neighborhood is officially part of the Colonia Ju√°rez colonia or official neighborhood, located just west of the historic center of Mexico City. The area's history as a community began when it was developed as a residential district for wealthy foreigners and Mexico City residents looking to move from the city center. The development of the area stalled during and after the Mexican Revolution. From the 1950s to 1980s the neighborhood was revitalized by artists, intellectuals and the city's elite who repopulated the area, gave it a bohemian reputation and attracted exclusive restaurants and clubs for visiting politicians and other notables. It was during this time that the area received the name of Zona Rosa, from Jos√© Luis Cuevas. The era ended in the 1980s, when many of the upscale businesses moved out and tourism, men's clubs, prostitution and other crime moved in. Although the area has declined during the 1980s, it is still a major shopping and entertainment district and has also become a major tourist attraction for the city, one that the city has worked to preserve and rehabilitate since the 2000s, with mixed success. From the 1990s, the area has also become home to Mexico City's gay community, which is prominent around Amberes Street and sponsors an annual pride parade on Paseo de la Reforma. Description Genova Street in Zona Rosa Zona Rosa is a portion of the official neighborhood of Colonia Ju√°rez, comprising 24 of the colonia's 99 city blocks. The borders of the area are formed by Paseo de la Reforma to the north, Varsovia Street to the west, Avenida Insurgentes to the east and Chapultepec Avenue and Metro Insurgentes to the south. Most of the streets in the area are named after European cities. A number of these streets are made of cobblestone, with two pedestrian-only. About 40 sculptures -- 17 created by young artists from the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas of UNAM -- have been installed on various streets, sponsored by the Rotary Club of Zona Rosa. The area is one of Mexico City's primary shopping districts and nightclub areas. Streets are filled with bars and nightclubs, which fill on weekends. Among these clubs, men's clubs with table dances and gay bars stand out. In total, there are 714 businesses in the area, 137 of which are restaurants, which cater to foreign and Mexican visitors as well as businessmen who work on nearby Paseo de la Reforma. From its bohemian and intellectual heritage, there are also art galleries, bookstores and the like. El P√©ndulo is a caf√©/bookstore located on Hamburgo Street, which also serves breakfast with tables available in the indoor dining room and on a terrace. Many of its dishes are named after famous writers. The menu includes international items such as eggs in various styles and French toast as well as Mexican staples such as chilaquiles. Patrons are permitted to read selections from the bookstore as they dine. One echo from the area's past are a number of early 20th-century mansions built when the area was an exclusive residential area for Mexico City's wealthy. These homes were designed to look European, especially French. Some of these still remain, such as the one at 115 Hamburgo Street, but most are abandoned. Statue of Germ√°n Vald√©s, or \\"Tin Tan\\" on Genova Street Leading to the area from the Insurgentes Metro is Genova Street, a pedestrian mall lined with eateries, 13 of which own areas on the street on which to put tables. It is popular with both locals and foreign visitors. Here, dozens of people handing out flyers stop pedestrians and drivers advertising gay bars and men's clubs, some of which operate illegally. It is also the site of the Corridor de Arte Jos√© Luis Cuevas, which occurs on weekends when an average of 40 artists display their works for sale. On this street stand around 40 sculptures created by young artists of the Escuela Nacional de Artes Plasticas of UNAM. Despite the installation of tourist police and other efforts, crime is still a problem in the area. The streets with the most problems are Londres, Hamburgo, Florencia, Liverpool, Niza, Amberes and Genova. Economy and tourism Most of the business conducted in Zona Rosa is through retail establishments. The area is home to 714 businesses, which include 137 restaurants and 37 parking garages. It is still one of the city's primary entertainment and shopping districts. It contains stores (especially clothing stores), cafes, hotels, chain stores, fast-food places, restaurants, major hotels, airline offices, banks, clubs and more. There is an antiques mall on Londres Street, and a large handicrafts and souvenir market called Mercado Insurgentes between Liverpool and Londres street, where a number of shopkeepers speak English and some take U.S. dollars. Approximately 100,000 people pass through the area each day, and an estimated 12,000,000 pesos is spent here each day. Another prominent retail segment includes businesses that cater to Mexico City's gay community. Since they were established in the 1990s, these businesses have grown in size and number and include sex shops, bookstores, movie theaters and exclusive hotels, as well as bars and nightclubs. These total over 200 businesses spread over 16 blocks, which is now considered to be the community business center. Most customers in Zona Rosa's businesses are visitors from other parts of the city, foreign tourists, and businessmen who come from nearby office buildings concentrated on or near Paseo de la Reforma. The area that connects Metro Insurgentes with Zona Rosa tends to become crowded with street peddlers selling tamales, perfumes, handicrafts, unlicensed CDs/DVDs and more to passerby groups. The attractions of the area for tourists, especially foreign ones, are the shopping, the cafes, and the nightclubs. However, these nightclubs, especially the men's clubs, have a reputation for attracting prostitution, underage drinking, illegal gambling, and other crime, which has a detrimental effect on tourism. The general deterioration of the area, both in physical infrastructure, crime, and types of businesses, has been problematic for the area as well. Although the area is still heavily promoted by the city, its secretary of tourism has admitted that it has lost much of its international prestige and can no longer be assured of its status as a tourist attraction. To counter its decline, the city has worked to rehabilitate the area, linking it with the more popular historic center through the Reforma-Centro Historico tourism corridor in 2005. There have been efforts to improve the area through the 2000s, which are projected to continued at least until 2012. This area was designated as a \\"Barrio M√°gico\\" by the city in 2011. Luxury hotels in the area include Maria Isabel Sheraton, Galeria Plaza, Plaza Florencia, Cristal Rosa, Geneve, Marquis, Aristos, Royal and Marco Polo. Despite the area's problems, the 24 hotels in the area report an average occupancy rate of 80%, mostly from foreign tourists, year-round. While there are about 38 bars and 10 men's clubs known to police that report good business, they also create problems for the area. Many are linked to illicit activities such as prostitution, both male and female, which noticeable on the streets after 10 pm seven days a week. Another problem is ‚Äútarjeteros‚Äù, who crowd the area's streets day and night (especially Genova Street), handing out cards and flyers to passersby advertising bars, clubs and other businesses. While this activity is legal, these tarjeteros have been accused of bothering area visitors and being associated with small-scale drug trafficking. Education There are several learning institutions within Zona Rosa. For example, CELE (the Center for the Teaching of Foreign Languages) of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) has a venue at Mil√°n Street, partially sponsored by Fundaci√≥n UNAM.Docencia Externa: Centros y Programas; Centro de Ense√±anza de Lenguas Extranjeras. UNAM. Accessed March 5th, 2013. History Abandoned house from the early 20th century on Hamburgo Street Zona Rosa began to be developed along with the rest of Colonia Ju√°rez in the mid-19th century; however, it has always had an independent identity. Originally the area was called ‚ÄúLa Teja‚Äù, then ‚ÄúLa Zona Americana‚Äù or ‚ÄúColonia Americana‚Äù, as presidents from Benito Ju√°rez to Porfirio D√≠az promoted it for foreign investment and residency up until the early 20th century. The area also attracted Mexico City's elite who were looking to escape the city center. During this time, the area was filled with cafes, pastry shops, and a number of green areas designed to create a European atmosphere. For this reason the streets were named after European cities such as Hamburg (Hamburgo), London (Londres), Copenhagen (Copenhague), Nice (Niza), and Liverpool. The Mexican Revolution put an end to the building here and the initial mansions remained, but many were abandoned. Nevertheless, the area remained one of the more glamorous zones for most of the 20th century. Expensive cafes and restaurants, art galleries, and jewelry stores continued to attract wealthy residents, although on a reduced scale. =Bohemian appeal= In the 1950s, the area was repopulated and reinvigorated by artists and intellectuals attracted to its location between the historic center and Chapultepec Park. This period saw the opening of trendy bars, clubs, restaurants, cafes, bookstores, and art galleries which gave the area a bohemian feel. By the 1960s, politicians such as Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos, Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, and Miguel Alem√°n, as well as painters such as Jos√© Luis Cuevas and writers such as Carlos Fuentes and Carlos Monsivais, lived, worked and visited the clubs here such as Caf√© Kineret. Fine restaurants were established such as Focolare in 1953, La Gondola in 1958 and Passy, also in 1958. These three don't exist anymore. Clubs and restaurants were exclusive, with dress codes. However, there were also several clubs known for chorus girls. One of these was the Can-can, on the corner of Hamburgo and Genova Streets. This mix of bohemian and propriety prompted Cuevas to comment that the area \\"Es demasiado ingenua para ser roja, pero demasiado fr√≠vola para ser blanca, por eso es precisamente rosa (is too naive to be red, but too frivolous to be white, for this reason it is precisely pink)\\". This is the origin of the area's current name. In 1967, Cuevas created a mural on a rooftop in Zona Rosa only to destroy it seconds afterwards. This event was meant to rebel against the social and political content of most of Mexico's post-Revoluction mural movement. In 2003, a reproduction of Cuevas‚Äô ‚Äúephemeral mural‚Äù was placed on the same rooftop on which the artist created and destroyed the original. This era of Zona Rosa's development continued until the 1980s. During this time many galleries, bohemian bars and restaurants opened. The area was considered to be tolerant, intellectual and cosmopolitan. It even had its own literary magazine called Zona Rosa. =Decline= Problems in the area began as early as 1968, when the construction of the Mexico City Metro caused the area to lose its exclusiveness and crime increased. Real deterioration began when the older, finer businesses such as boutiques and galleries moved out, mostly due to the economic crisis of the 1980s and the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, which substantially damaged the area. Many of the more exclusive businesses were replaced by men's clubs, gay bars, and massage parlors, which has made Zona Rosa more ‚Äúred‚Äù than ‚Äúpink‚Äù. As the area was promoted for tourism, fast-food places, nightclubs, and bars sprung up, which have engendered problems with underage drinking and prostitution. La Ronda was an establishment visited by intellectuals such as Guadalupe Amor and Manuel Felgueres, but today it is a men's club named Foxy's. Other establishments, such as a bar named Tirol once located in one of the area's old mansions, have simply shut down and their buildings remain deserted. Many of the stores selling jewelry, arts and other fine merchandise have been converted into stores with more mass-produced items and souvenirs. Another change occurred in the vicinity of Amberes Street, where bars, clubs and other businesses catering to the gay community have appeared. These are distinguished by the use of rainbow colors on their facades. Most of the decline of the area occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, when the city was governed by appointees of the federal government. In the late 1990s, the city government began to be elected by residents and in 1997, the ruling PRI lost power in the city to the PRD. The new city government was more interested in promoting and restoring the neighborhood. Tourist police were implemented, and efforts to better regulate businesses, control prostitutions, repair infrastructure and promote tourism were undertaken at various times during the 2000s. These efforts have had mixed success. The city has conducted some high-profile raids of clubs such as the Bar Continental DJ Club, searching for drugs and minors. This operation eventually led to the expropriation of the property on Florencia Street as well as another club on Berna Street. They mayor stated it was part of ongoing operations and meant to be a warning to other club owners in the area. The expropriated building on Florence Street now houses a contingent of the Mexico City police. There have also been other raids in response to complaints about underage drinking and illegal gambling. In 2007, a public-private venture was started to connect and promote Zona Rosa along with the historic center as the Reforma-Centro Historico corridor. Crime has decreased, but residents and businesses continue to move out, while more ‚Äúred‚Äù businesses move in. In 2004, two theaters were opened exclusively to show erotic movies under the name of Contempo Cinema. According to the owners, the movies shown are not pornography but rather films such as Last Tango in Paris, Basic Instinct and Wild Orchid, which do not have explicit sex scenes meriting an XXX rating. The new venues have about 200 seats each with a bar, restaurants and film store. Work on infrastructure has been completed, mostly on Genova and Hamburgo Streets, but residents complain that the work is too slow, hurting their businesses. There are fears that these interventions, along with those scheduled between 2010 and 2012, will not be enough to save the area. =Gay community= Marchers at the 2009 Gay Pride Parade Amberes street in Mexico City's Zona Rosa is lined with gay bars Another prominent area is Amberes Street, home to Mexico City's gay community. This community was established in the 1990s due to the area's overall tolerance and the fact that police here did not extort members of the gay community. Today, homosexuality on Amberes Streets and the rest of Zona Rosa is fairly open with handholding and kissing among same-sex couples. This has led it to be compared to Barrio de Chueca in Madrid and the Castro District in San Francisco. It is famous for being a gay encounter area, especially for young gay men, with some being minors. The gay community has its own set of looks, body language, phrases and other signals used to identify one another. Another important aspect of the gay culture is clothing, with clothing considered to be in ‚Äúgood taste‚Äù making one more successful in meeting potential partners. A number of gay men make money through prostitution, mostly younger men soliciting older men. In 2010, the city opened a consulting office for homosexuals wishing to take advantage of Mexico City's law allowing them to marry. Zona Rosa is one of three areas in Mexico City where gay bars and other businesses operate, along with Plaza Garibaldi and an area on Avenida Insurgentes South. However, Zona Rosa is the largest of these and considered to be the gay community's business center, with over 200 businesses spread over 16 blocks. The best-known businesses are bars such as Hibrido, Caberetito, El Ansia, Black Out, and B-Gay B-Proud (in English). These bars, clubs, and other entertainment places mostly cater to younger crowds and play reggaeton, psycho-punk, etc., with lasers, strobe lights and other typical decor. However, these businesses are usually marked with rainbow colored flags or other decorations on the facade. Singles and couples dance sensually and sometimes a cloud of generated smoke covers the dance floor. Touching and kissing between couples of the same sex is highly tolerated in many of these clubs. Some also have ‚Äúdark rooms‚Äù where patrons can find privacy for more intimate acts. A number also have unofficial dress codes. Zona Rosa's annual pride parade is officially called the Marcha del Orgullo L√©sbico, Gay, Bisexual, Transg√©nero, Travesti, Transsexual e Intersexual (LGBTTTI) (March of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Transvestite, Transsexual and Intersexual Pride). It was first held in 1978 with about 300 people participating. During this event, the nightclubs, discoth√®ques and bars of Zona Rosa fill with members of the LGBT community starting at midday. Many businesses, whether they cater to gays or not, are decorated with rainbow colored balloons, streamers and other items. Despite the crowds, police presence is not significantly heightened. The parade usually marches along Paseo de la Reforma from Puerta de los Leones to the Glorieta de la Palma, with the entire stretch completely closed to traffic for the event. The city has even participated, offering free AIDS tests to attendees. In 2003, there were more than 20,000 participants. The 2010 march adopted the theme of \\"Marcha del Bicentenario, Marcha de las Libertades\\" (March of the Bicentennial, March of Liberties) and extended from the Angel of Independence to the Alameda Central. The march in Mexico City was paralleled in 25 other Mexican cities. Despite its prominence, the existence of a large, open gay community in Zona Rosa still creates controversy. Some, such as the president of the Agrupacion de Comericantes de la Zona Rosa (Acozoro), Mariano Molina, state that the presence of an open gay community drives away visitors and customers who are not accustomed to seeing gay couples in public. Others state that the government will not work to save the area because of the gay bars and Mexico's ethic of machismo. While male and female prostitution exists in Zona Rosa, there have been complaints of the prostitution of minors in the gay community, despite efforts since the 1990s to eradicate it. Residents and business owners complain that this prostitution is very open and can be very aggressive, centered on the various gay bars that can be found on and around Ambares Street. However, business owners in the gay community state that the prostitution issue, including that of minors, is not the problem that neighbors say it is; rather it is that some have a problem with having an open gay community. These businesses state that gays have a high level of purchasing power and many own their own businesses that employ thousands in the city. They also state that the gay community attracts visitors from other parts of the city and even internationally. This is particularly true on Gay Pride Day, when the city holds a parade on Paseo de la Reforma and at Christmastime. =Korean community= Korean businesses on Florencia Street Most of Mexico City's Korean population of about 9,000 lives in and around Zona Rosa. According to the newspaper Reforma, there are at least 1,000 Koreans living in Zona Rosa proper and about 3,000 total in Colonia Ju√°rez. In Zona Rosa, especially west of Florencia Street, barber shops, restaurants, and Internet cafes with signs in Korean dot the area. Many Korean residents do not speak Spanish and are relatively isolated from their Mexican neighbors. The area around Hamburgo, Praga, Berna and Biarritz streets has been converted into ‚ÄúPeque√±o Se√∫l‚Äù (Little Seoul), with Biarritz Street's residents almost 90% Korean. The number of Korean residents in the colonia continues to increase even as the number of younger people in general decreases. Most immigrated to Mexico in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century, as a result of commercial agreements signed by the Mexican government with Korea and Taiwan, allowing companies such as Daewoo to bring workers over from Asia. However, according to some sources such as Alfredo Romero, professor of the Faculty of Political and Social Sciences at UNAM, a large percentage of Koreans living in Mexico have questionable immigration status. There have been conflicts between Korean-owned businesses and Mexican neighbors over noise and sanitation issues, with some Mexicans complaining that the Koreans do not want to adapt to Mexican society. Another issue has been legal problems, both with the status of merchandise and the status of employees. A store owned by Koreans was shut down by police for selling imported merchandise of questionable origin in 2002, with 33 workers detained.

It opened October 1, 1955 and was used for concerts (maximum capacity 6,800), sporting events, circus performances, political rallies, as well as trade shows with 16,000 square feet (1500 m¬≤) of space. It was demolished in 2013. It shared the same complex as the Bangor Civic Center. For decades, it hosted the Maine Principals' Association basketball tournament each February, as well as the graduation ceremonies for Bangor High School in June. It also served as the home of the Maine Windjammers of the Continental Basketball Association, and the University of Maine men's and women's basketball teams for a few seasons until 1992. The V-shape style of the building gave it the look of giant wings and adds to the atmosphere. A statue of Paul Bunyan towered outside as a symbol of the city's prosperous history as a lumber port in the early-to-mid-19th century. The auditorium and civic center shared its campus with Bass Park, home of the Bangor State Fair as well as Bangor Raceway, one of the oldest harness racing facilities in New England. Bangor Auditorium has hosted many major musical acts and has been a stop for World Wrestling Entertainment house shows for many years. Over the course of a few years, the city discussed significantly renovating or replacing the aging auditorium with a state-of- the-art venue. Poor ventilation and HVAC systems as well as substandard handicap accessibility have been cited as primary reasons for this. On August 22, 2009, the city consulted with Sink Combs Dethlefs Architects and others to discuss the construction of a $51 million, 5,000 seat arena adjacent to the existing structure. The proposal suggested using the new facility as the centerpiece of the complex, while renovating the existing auditorium and the Bangor Civic Center for smaller events at an additional cost of $18 million. After a May 2011 public referendum in which Bangor voters supported building new facilities by a margin of 3 to 1, the plan now moved forward to build an entirely new set of primary buildings at Bass Park to replace the existing Bangor Auditorium and Civic Center with new structures, while leaving the old buildings open almost until the new buildings opened in 2013. The current plan does not rehabilitate the old structures but removes them totally in 2013. The proposed cost of the new buildings is $65 million. Demolition began at the Bangor Auditorium and Civic Center on June 03, 2013, with the new arena completed. The new arena, officially the Cross Insurance Center, has varying maximum seating depending on the configuration that is used. For events that use the main floor for performance there are 5,800 fixed seats. For events using an end stage of 60 feet by 40 feet the new arena will seat as many as 8,050 persons. The new facility is managed by Global Spectrum, a division of Comcast.

Gallagher, M. Laver and P. Mair, Representative Government in Europe, p. 221. It is a more positive and less radical variant of classical liberalism.R.T. Allen, Beyond Liberalism, p. 2. Conservative liberal parties tend to combine liberal policies with more traditional stances and personal beliefs on social and ethical issues. Neoconservatism has also been identified as an ideological relative or twin to conservative liberalism, and some similarities exist also between conservative liberalism and national liberalism.  Overview  According to Robert Kraynak, a professor at Colgate University, rather than \\"following progressive liberalism (i.e. social liberalism), conservative liberals draw upon pre-modern sources, such as classical philosophy (with its ideas of virtue, the common good, and natural rights), Christianity (with its ideas of natural law, the social nature of man, and original sin), and ancient institutions (such as common law, corporate bodies, and social hierarchies). This gives their liberalism a conservative foundation. It means following Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Edmund Burke rather than Locke or Kant; it usually includes a deep sympathy for the politics of the Greek polis, the Roman Republic, and Christian monarchies. But, as realists, conservative liberals acknowledge that classical and medieval politics cannot be restored in the modern world. And, as moralists, they see that the modern experiment in liberty and self-government has the positive effect of enhancing human dignity as well as providing an opening (even in the midst of mass culture) for transcendent longings for eternity. At its practical best, conservative liberalism promotes ordered liberty under God and establishes constitutional safeguards against tyranny. It shows that a regime of liberty based on traditional morality and classical-Christian culture is an achievement we can be proud of, rather than merely defensive about, as trustees of Western civilization\\".Robert Kraynak, Living with liberalism, The New Criterion, 2005 In the European context, conservative liberalism should not be confused with liberal conservatism which is a variant of conservatism combining conservative views with liberal policies in regards to the economy, social and ethical issues. The roots of conservative liberalism are to be found at the beginning of the history of liberalism. Until the two world wars, the political class in most European countries from Germany to Italy was formed by conservative liberals. The events such as World War I occurring after 1917 brought the more radical version of classical liberalism to a more conservative (i.e. more moderate) type of liberalism.R.T. Allen, Beyond Liberalism, p. 13. Conservative liberal parties have tended to develop in those European countries where there was no strong secular conservative party and where the separation of church and state was less of an issue. In those countries, where the conservative parties were Christian democratic, this conservative brand of liberalism developed. In the United States, neoconservatives might be classified as conservative liberals, according to Peter Lawler, a professor at Berry College, who argued: > [I]n America today, responsible liberals‚Äîwho are usually called > neoconservatives‚Äîsee that liberalism depends on human beings who are > somewhat child-centered, patriotic, and religious. These responsible > liberals praise these non-individualistic human propensities in an effort to > shore up liberalism. One of their slogans is 'conservative sociology with > liberal politics.' The neoconservatives recognize that the politics of free > and rational individuals depends upon a pre-political social world that is > far from free and rational as a whole.Peter Lawler, Liberal Conservatism, > Not Conservative Liberalism, The Intercollegiate Review, Fall 2003/Spring > 2004 In the American context, conservative liberalism as well as liberal conservatism should not be confused with libertarian conservatism, influenced by right-libertarianism.

Byrd began his career in 1952 as member of the gospel group the Gospel Starlighters, who later changed their name to the Avons in 1953 and the Five Royals in 1954, before settling with the name the Flames in 1955 prior to Brown's joining the group; their agent later changed it to The Famous Flames. Byrd was the founder of The Flames, is credited with the discovery of James Brown, and also claimed responsibility for writing most of James Brown's hits. As group founder, and one of the longest-serving members of the group, Byrd was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame posthumously in 2012. Byrd was also a 1998 recipient of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation's Pioneer Award. Early life and career Byrd was born in Toccoa, Georgia, to a religiously devout family, where they were respected members of the church congregation and active in their neighborhood there.Cliff White: You Know He Got Soul, Polygram sleevenotes (1995). Byrd started being active in his local church choir with the group, the Zioneers, later making a name for himself as member of the Gospel Starlighters, which included his sister Sarah. At a time when church elders disapproved of secular singing, the band members would leave their home state and perform in South Carolina as the R&B; group the Avons, eventually they left gospel behind and went on as the Avons. The original group consisted of Byrd, who played piano, organ and sang lead vocals; and Nafloyd Scott, Fred Pulliam and Doyle Oglesby. Meeting James Brown and the formation of The Famous Flames In 1952 Bobby Byrd formed and sang with a gospel group called the Gospel Starlighters. During a friendly baseball match at a juvenile prison, he met a young James Brown who was serving time there on robbery charges. Byrd befriended him and arranged for Byrd's family to oversee Brown's parole. This began a personal and professional association that lasted until 1973. Although Byrd would eventually have over twenty years as a solo performer, it is his association with James Brown for which he is chiefly remembered. Contrary to belief, the group had already changed its name to the Flames when Brown asked Byrd for a spot in the group, with Brown first settling as a drummer. Eventually Brown was driven to perform as lead singer, as he felt lead vocalists got more attention from women. Byrd recognized early that Brown was unique and that it would be impossible to control him: \\"I didn't need him in competition, I needed him with me, that's why I worked so hard to get him over to my group.\\"Cliff White: You Know He Got Soul, Polygram sleevenotes (1995) In 1956, Clint Brantley signed on as the group's manager. With Johnny Terry and Nash Knox on board, the group became \\"The Famous Flames\\" and won a deal with Ralph Bass' Federal label, which was a subsidiary of Syd Nathan's King Records, in February 1956. Their first record, \\"Please, Please, Please\\", which Byrd said he wrote with Johnny Terry, featured a lead vocal by James Brown and was issued with the billing, \\"James Brown and the Famous Flames\\", which did not go well with the rest of the group. After three sessions, the original Flames broke up. The Flames without Brown changed their name to Byrd's Drops of Joy. However, they found little success; when Brown approached them to reform the Flames they agreed. At this point, The Famous Flames ceased being a vocal/instrumental group, and became a straight vocal group, since Brown had begun to employ the old J.C. Davis outfit as his road band. Original Flames members Bobby Byrd and Johnny Terry returned, and new Flames members Bobby Bennett and Baby Lloyd Stallworth were added. Along with Brown, these four men comprised the longest-lasting lineup of The Famous Flames. Original Flames guitarist Nafloyd Scott also returned and was added to the band. The rest of the original Flames faded into obscurity. With this lineup the group would have a series of hits between 1959 and 1964 and participated on many of the albums that helped to bring R&B; to a crossover audience, including the landmark million-selling 1963 live album, Live at the Apollo. Byrd and the Famous Flames also performed together on a few episodes of The Ed Sullivan Show, made a brief appearance in the film, Ski Party and upstaged headliners The Rolling Stones on the landmark 1964 rock concert/motion picture, The T.A.M.I. Show. Byrd (and fellow Famous Flame Lloyd Stallworth) were credited as songwriters on the Flames hit, \\"Lost Someone,\\" though Brown was the only member who sang on the recording. Its success led Brown to record more songs on his own but the majority of his early hits were as a member of the Famous Flames including songs such as \\"Try Me\\", \\"I'll Go Crazy\\", \\"Bewildered\\", \\"Think\\", \\"Baby You're Right\\", \\"I Don't Mind\\", \\"This Old Heart\\", \\"Shout and Shimmy\\", and \\"Oh Baby Don't You Weep\\". As was the case with some recordings, the Famous Flames were often not credited on album covers though ironically enough on recordings in which Brown appeared by himself, the group was credited, leaving fans to erroneously believe the Famous Flames were actually Brown's backing band, instead of the singing group that they actually were. The group continued performing together until 1968 when they left over monetary issues. The last Flames-associated recording to be released was the pre-funk soul hit, \\"Licking Stick - Licking Stick\\", to which Byrd contributed vocals without the other members, who had departed before Byrd did that summer. Solo career and continual work with Brown After two years away, Byrd reunited with Brown in 1970. He hired, on the spot and without rehearsal, Bootsy Collins, Bootsy's brother Catfish, and their band to fill in for Brown's former band after they left him before a gig. After that performance, Byrd and Brown brought the band to a studio session where they recorded the famous funk hit, \\"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\\". When The Famous Flames were still together, Byrd and Brown co-formed the production company, Fair Deal, to distribute The Famous Flames' recordings ‚Äì and Brown's own solo recordings ‚Äì to mainstream markets after years solely on the rhythm and blues circuit. This led to both Byrd and Brown's signing solo deals with Smash Records. In 1964, Byrd recorded his first solo hit, \\"Baby, Baby, Baby\\" with Anna King. A year later he had a bigger R&B; hit with \\"We Are in Love\\", which reached #14. Later in the late 1960s, as Byrd and Brown together began working under the yet-to-be-named genre of funk, Byrd had a funky song \\"I Need Help (I Can't Do It Alone)\\"(1970). In 1971, when Brown signed with Polydor Records, he and Byrd formed the label People Records, and issued several records by other artists, including Byrd himself, who recorded the funk hit, \\"I Know You Got Soul\\"(1971). Byrd appeared onstage with Brown from 1970 until leaving his band again in 1973 due to a combination of issues, including uncredited compositions on some Brown hits, Brown's issues with singer Vicki Anderson, whom Byrd eventually married and remained with until his death, and wanting to start a family with Anderson. Though he remained in contact with Brown following this final split, this departure ended Byrd's 21-year professional association with Brown, who now went by the nickname \\"Godfather of Soul\\", after composing the soundtrack to the film, Black Caesar (1973). Without Byrd's help, however, Brown began struggling with production of the music on People and soon began experiencing financial troubles. Byrd recorded funky song \\"Back From The Dead\\" in 1975. Late 1980s, rare groove boom and James Brown boom were coming. In 1993, Byrd recorded a solo album, On the Move, on the German record Label, Soulciety Records. After a few more live performances, Byrd decided to retire in 1996, though he occasionally re- emerged sometimes with the assistance of Brown: following Brown's parole from drug and weapons charges in 1991, he hired Byrd to join him on stage for his pay-per-view 1992 concert. Byrd would occasionally perform with Brown in some venues. They would also collaborate on the song \\"Killing Is Out, School Is In\\" from Brown's final studio album, 2002's The Next Step. At his funeral in December 2006, Byrd sung \\"Sex Machine\\" with Brown's other band mates paying homage to his late estranged friend and former performing partner. In 2003, a few years before his death, Bobby, his wife Vicki, and Famous Flames Bobby Bennett and Lloyd Stallworth, sued lead singer James Brown and Universal Music for non-payment of royalties, stating that monies that rightfully belong to them for numerous Famous Flames hits, and Byrd's hit \\"I Know You Got Soul\\", which was sampled by numerous rappers, including Eric B. & Rakim, were sent by Universal to James Brown instead, who allegedly kept them. The suit was dismissed due to the statute of limitations having run out. However, rapper Jay-Z, who sampled Byrd's song \\"I'm Not to Blame\\" for his recording, \\"U Don't Know\\", on his 2001 multi million-selling The Blueprint, paid Byrd 65% of the royalties for the song, allowing Byrd and his family to secure a mortgage for their home, which was worth about $250,000. Personal life After splitting from Brown in 1973, Byrd and Vicki Anderson, who left Brown's band at the same time as Byrd, got married. Byrd had three children with his first wife Gail, in Toccoa, Georgia. He also had two children from another relationship. Byrd raised Anderson's children including Carleen. The couple remained married throughout Byrd's lifetime. Though he had moved to Cincinnati after the Famous Flames signed with Federal/King, Byrd retained residences in Georgia and after leaving Brown, settled at Loganville for the remainder of his life. =Death= Bobby Byrd died on September 12, 2007, of cancer; he was 73 years old. Legacy Numerous songs in hip hop music have sampled Byrd-associated songs such as \\"I Know You Got Soul\\", \\"Think (About It)\\", \\"Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine\\", \\"Soul Power\\", \\"Make It Funky\\" and \\"I'm Not to Blame\\". Byrd's music has had a lasting influence on numerous soul, R&B;, and hip hop artists. In the Famous Flames' Rock & Roll Hall of Fame page, Byrd is regarded as \\"one of the more important auxiliary figures in the career of a major artist in music history.\\" In October 2004, Byrd's songs \\"I Know You Got Soul\\" and \\"Hot Pants\\" were featured on the Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack, playing on fictional radio station Master Sounds 98.3. In September 2005 his song \\"Try It Again\\" appeared on the soundtrack of Indigo Prophecy. Byrd was portrayed by actor Nelsan Ellis in the 2014 James Brown bio film Get on Up. Induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and initial controversy In 1986 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame officials announced that James Brown would be included in a list of the first nine musicians to be inducted by the organization. However, James Brown did not meet the Hall of Fame's criteria for induction at that time which required an artist to have released their first single as a solo artist at least 25 years prior to induction. Brown's first solo release in 1965 was only 21 years before, although Brown had been active in the industry and released songs as part of The Famous Flames prior to 1965. For Brown to be inducted by the organization in 1986, inclusion of the other members of The Famous Flames was required. It is not known why this oversight occurred, but it has been surmised that the organization felt Brown's solo work warranted his induction at the Hall of Fame's initial ceremonies. Brown's inclusion as a solo artist without the other Flames members was met with criticism but was not amended until years later.John Petkovic, \\"The Famous Flames: James Brown was their leader, but they were R&B; legends, too (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Class of 2012)\\", Cleveland Plain Dealer, April 6, 2012. In late 2011, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame formed a special committee to discuss several pioneering groups they felt deserved to be inducted, but were initially excluded in error, due to the impact of their lead singers, who were incorrectly inducted as solo artists. This committee's decision led to the induction of The Famous Flames and its members. This was an amending gesture which did not require nomination or voting, under the premise that they should have been inducted with Brown back in 1986, since, according to Rock Hall CEO Terry Stewart, Brown's first solo recording missed the 25-year criterion for performing musicians. Brown, Byrd, Stallworth, and Terry had long been deceased by this point, and Bobby Bennett, the Flames' only surviving member, accepted the honor on behalf of the group in Cleveland, on April 14, 2012. Less than one year after the induction, Bennett himself died on January 18, 2013. In 2015, Bobby Byrd was nominated for a second induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of The J.B.'s, a group which he actually discovered in 1970 to replace the Original James Brown Band, who left Brown in 1970 (as the Famous Flames left him in 1968) due to salary disputes.The J.B.'s, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame nominees. In 2020, Bobby Byrd was posthumously inducted with the rest of The Famous Flames' members Baby Lloyd Stallworth, Bobby Bennett, and Johnny Terry into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame, some seven years after the induction of Flames lead singer James Brown into the same organization.https://www.facebook.com/201846143194483/photos/a.201874793191618/3364359496943116/?type=3&theater; ReferencesExternal links *Bobby Byrd, James Brown, and The Famous Flames from Last FM * Bobby Byrd Discography *The Times Obituary for Bobby Byrd * *Bobby Byrd ‚Äì Condolence book (Hungarian) *Bobby Byrd eulogy from Rolling Stone. *Bobby Byrd page on Future Rock Legends *The Famous Flames' page on Future Rock Legends * Bobby Byrd page on the Soul Walking U.K. website *The Famous Flames Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction site *The official Facebook page of The Famous Flames Category:1934 births Category:2007 deaths Category:African-American pianists Category:African-American record producers Category:American record producers Category:American baritones Category:American funk keyboardists Category:American funk singers Category:American organists Category:American male organists Category:American soul keyboardists Category:Deaths from cancer in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:James Brown Orchestra members Category:James Brown vocalists Category:Musicians from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Singers from Georgia (U.S. state) Category:The Famous Flames members Category:The J.B.'s members Category:People from Loganville, Georgia Category:People from Toccoa, Georgia Category:Rhythm and blues pianists Category:Smash Records artists Category:American rhythm and blues singer-songwriters Category:American basses Category:King Records artists Category:American male pianists Category:20th- century American keyboardists ","title":"Bobby Byrd"},{"id":"2300622","text":"Pierre-Joseph Pelletier (, , ; 22 March 1788 - 19 July 1842) was a French chemist and pharmacist who did notable research on vegetable alkaloids, and was the co-discoverer with Joseph Bienaim√© Caventou of quinine, caffeine, and strychnine.

It has elements of both a curb bit and a snaffle bit. In this respect a pelham bit functions similar to a double bridle, and like a double bridle it normally has \\"double\\" reins: a set of curb reins and a set of snaffle reins.Sandin, Theresa. \\"The Pelham Bit\\" Accessed November 15, 2008 Because it has a bit shank and can exert curb-style pressure on the horse, it is considered a curb bit.Colnar, Rebecca. \\"Hot topic, hot solution - Curb Bits.\\" Accessed November 15, 2008 Like all curb bits, a pelham bit has a mouthpiece, shanks with both purchase and lever arms, a ring for rein attachment at the bottom of the shank, and a curb chain. But like a snaffle bit, a pelham bit also has a bit ring on either side of the mouthpiece. Like some curb bits, a pelham bit usually has \\"loose\\" shanks - hinged at the mouthpiece in the same way that the rings of a snaffle bit are hinged. When two sets of reins are used, the snaffle rein generally is wider, to help distinguish it from the curb. A \\"cowboy pelham\\" is a western style of loose- jawed curb bit with additional rings at the mouthpiece allowing a second set of reins to be added. Action Pelham bit, jointed mouthpiece, used here with a bit converter and single rein A solid medium-port mouthpiece with ring for a snaffle rein, allowing it to be used as a \\"cowboy pelham\\", though shown here with only a single curb rein A pelham works on several parts of a horse's head, depending on which rein is applied. The mouthpiece acts when either the snaffle or curb rein is applied and puts pressure on the bars, tongue, and lips of the horse. The curb chain and design of the mouthpiece can alter the degree of pressure placed on the horse's mouth. The roof of the mouth is affected if the bit mouthpiece of the pelham has a high port or if it is jointed. Pressure on the poll occurs when the curb rein is engaged, and pressure is directly related to the length of the upper shank (purchase arm) in relation to the lower shank (lever arm). All pelhams apply some pressure on the poll. Pressure is applied to the chin groove by the curb chain when the curb rein is used. Direct rein pressure from the snaffle rein may put some pressure on the sides of the horse's mouth, depending on the specific bit design. =Shank= A pelham is a leverage bit, meaning that it increases the force but reduces the extent of movement applied by the rider. Unlike a snaffle bit, the curb rein can amplify the rein pressure several times over, depending on the geometry and length of the shank. Shank lengths are (\\"Tom Thumb\\") and longer, although most are less than . The relation of the purchase arm‚Äîthe length from the mouthpiece to the cheekpiece rings‚Äîand the \\"shank\\" or lever arm‚Äîthe length from the mouthpiece to the lowest rein ring, is important in the severity of the bit. A long lower shank in relation to the upper shank increases the leverage, and thus the pressure, on the curb groove and the bars of the mouth. A long upper shank in relation to the lower shank increases the pressure on the poll, but does not apply as much pressure on the bars of the mouth. However, longer-shanked bits must rotate back further before applying pressure on the horse's mouth than shorter-shanked bits. Therefore, the horse has more warning in a long-shanked bit, allowing it to respond before any significant pressure is applied to its mouth, than it would in a shorter- shanked bit. In this way, a longer shank can allow better communication between horse and rider, without increasing severity. This is also directly dependent on the tightness of the curb chain. If the bit has a 1.5\\" cheek and a 4.5\\" lower shank, thus producing a 1:3 ratio of cheek to lower shank, while the ratio of the cheek to (upper + lower) shank is 1:4, and producing 4 pounds-force of pressure on the horse's mouth for every 1 pound-force (4 newtons per newton) placed on the reins. If the bit had 2\\" cheeks and 8\\" shank (ratio of 1:4), the bit will produce of tension for every one applied by the reins (5 N/N). Regardless of the ratio, the longer the shank, the less force is needed on the reins to provide a given amount of pressure on the mouth. So, if one were to apply of pressure on the horse's mouth, a 2\\" shank would need much more rein pressure than an 8\\" shank to provide the same effect. This pelham bit, used without a snaffle rein, is essentially a curb bit =Mouthpiece= As with many other bits, a pelham may have a solid or a jointed mouthpiece. If solid, it may range from a nearly straight \\"Mullen\\" mouthpiece up to a medium port. The pelham's mouthpiece controls the pressure on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and bars. A mullen mouth places even pressure on the bars and tongue. A port places more pressure on the bars, and provide room for the tongue. A high port may act on the roof of the mouth as it touches, and will act as a fulcrum, amplifying the pressure on the bars of the mouth. Jointed mouthpieces increase the pressure on the bars as the mouthpiece breaks over in a \\"nutcracker\\" effect. Unlike a jointed mouthpiece on a snaffle bit, a jointed mouthpiece on a bit with shanks, such as the pelham, can be quite severe in its effect, particularly if the pressure from the shanks causes the joint of the bit to roll forward and press the tip of the joint into the tongue. The mouthpiece is placed lower down in a horse's mouth than snaffle bits, usually just touching the corners of the mouth without creating a wrinkle. The lower the bit is placed, the more severe it is as the bars of the mouth get thinner and so pressure is more concentrated. =Curb chain= The curb chain applies pressure to the groove under a horse's chin. It amplifies the pressure on the bars of the horse's mouth, because when it tightens it acts as a fulcrum. Adjusted correctly, the chain links lie flat and hang loose below the chin groove, coming into action against the jaw only when the shanks have rotated due to rein pressure. The point at which the curb chain engages varies with the individual needs of the horse, but contact at 45 degrees of shank rotation is a common default adjustment. Uses Western- style bit used as a \\"cowboy pelham\\" with double reins The pelham bit has several uses. In the English riding disciplines, it is used in place of a double bridle, when it is desirable to have double reins but not two bits. The pelham bit is also used for polo, when the action of a double bridle is desired, but the rider's ability to make rein adjustments is limited. In training, a pelham bit sometimes is used in both English and western disciplines to transition a horse from a snaffle bit to a curb bit or double bridle. Sometimes, a bit converter, also known as a pelham rounding, is used so a pelham can be used with one pair of reins. This is most often seen with beginners and for riders in the cross-country phase of eventing. However, use of a converter is illegal in most other horse show classes. =Horse shows= In horse shows, a pelham bit may be used in some disciplines but is prohibited in others. In the United States, use of a pelham bit is prevalent in hunt seat equitation, and occasionally in show jumping and eventing. Use of this bit is legal, but not common, in show hunter, and English pleasure. In the United Kingdom, this bit is often used in place of a double bridle in show hunter, show hack, riding horse, show cob and mountain and moorland classes, but it is forbidden in equitation and novice classes. The pelham is not permitted in dressage at any level. The pelham is never legal for use in any western riding discipline, where either a snaffle bit or a curb bit is used. =Driving= A pelham with synthetic mouthpiece, designed for driving Variations of the pelham bit are often seen in driving in situations where a bit more control is required that can be obtained with a snaffle alone or with a combination of snaffle and overcheck. Shank designs and size are governed by the rules for various forms of competition and very considerably across disciplines from combined driving to draft horse showing. =Polo= Pelham bit on a polo pony, with double reins, draw reins on the snaffle rings, and a martingale In polo, a pelham bit is one of the two bits most commonly used (the other being a gag bit). Double reins are held in one hand. Neck reining is used almost exclusively, and riders have little or no need to adjust the reins while riding. Draw reins are commonly used, on the snaffle ring. The rein lengths are adjusted so that the rein used normally is the snaffle rein, with the curb rein only coming into effect when needed. Such techniques are not legal in show disciplines and are exclusive to polo. History An antique curb bit with pelham rein attachment points The angle cheek pelham was formerly used in the Australian Light Horse and other cavalry units as it was designed to suit as many horses' mouths as possible. The Australian design had one side of the mouthpiece smooth and the other serrated. Various rein attachments were also possible with this bit.

Beatrice: From Buildup through Breakup. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. 235 pages. In 1987, its international food operations were sold to Reginald Lewis, a corporate attorney, creating TLC Beatrice International, after which the majority of its domestic (U.S.) brands and assets were acquired by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts (KKR), with the bulk of its holdings sold off. By 1990, the remaining operations were ultimately acquired by Conagra Brands.  History = Early years = The Beatrice Creamery Company was founded in 1894 by George Everett Haskell and William W. Bosworth, by leasing the factory of a bankrupt firm of the same name located in Beatrice, Nebraska. At the time, they purchased butter, milk, and eggs from local farmers and graded them for resale. They promptly began separating the butter themselves at their plant, making their own butter on site and packaging and distributing it under their own label. They devised special protective packages and distributed them to grocery stores and restaurants in their own wagons and through jobbers. To overcome the shortage of cream, the partners established skimming stations to which farmers delivered their milk to have the cream, used to make butter, separated from the milk. This led to the introduction of their unique credit program of providing farmers with cream separators so they could separate the milk on the farm and retain the skim milk for animal food. This enabled farmers to pay for the separators from the proceeds of their sales of cream. The program worked so well, the company sold more than 50,000 separators in Nebraska from 1895 to 1905. On March 1, 1905, the company was incorporated as the Beatrice Creamery Company of Iowa, with capital of $3,000,000. By the early 20th century, they were shipping dairy products across the United States, and by 1910 they operated nine creameries and three ice cream plants across the Great Plains. The company moved to Chicago in 1913, the center of the American food processing industry. By the 1930s, it was a major dairy company, producing some of milk and of ice cream annually. In 1939, Beatrice Creamery Company purchased Blue Valley Creamery Company, the other Chicago-based dairy centralizer. This acquisition added at least 11 creameries from New York to South Dakota. Beatrice's 'Meadow Gold' brand was a household name in much of America by the beginning of World War II. In 1946, it changed its name to Beatrice Foods Co. and doubled its sales between 1945 and 1955 as the post-war baby boom created greater demand for milk products. = 1950s through 1970s = From the late 1950s until the early 1970s, the company expanded into Canada and purchased a number of other food firms, leveraging its distribution network to profit from a more diverse array of food and consumer products. It came to be the owner of brands such as Avis Rent A Car, Playtex, Shedd's, Tropicana, John Sexton & Co, Good & Plenty, and many others. Annual sales in 1984 were roughly $12 billion. During both the Winter and Summer Olympics that year, the corporation flooded the TV airwaves with advertisements letting the public know that many brands with which they were familiar were actually part of Beatrice Foods. These ads used the tagline (with a jingle) \\"We're Beatrice. You've known us all along.\\" After the Olympics, advertisements for its products continued to end with the catchphrase \\"We're Beatrice\\" and an instrumental version of the \\"You've known us all along\\" portion of the jingle, as the red and white \\"Beatrice\\" logo would simultaneously appear in the bottom right hand corner. The campaign was found to alienate consumers, calling attention to the fact that many of their favorite brands were part of a far-reaching multinational corporation, and the campaign was pulled off the air by autumn. Beatrice's Canadian subsidiary, Beatrice Foods Canada Ltd., was founded in 1969 and became legally separate from its parent firm in 1978. In 1968, Sexton Foods was approached by Beatrice with an offer to purchase the John Sexton & Co. Beatrice was attracted to Sexton Quality Foods' distribution network, quality, variety of private-label products, specialized food offerings, sales force and profitability. Mack Sexton's initial response was no, but Beatrice Foods was very interested. Eventually both parties reached an agreement. Beatrice Foods increased the purchase price, pledged capital to expand Sexton Quality Foods' distribution network, pledged capital to introduce a new Sexton frozen product line, and pledged that the Sexton leadership would continue to lead and operate the company as a separate entity. On December 20, 1968, Beatrice acquired the business and assets of John Sexton & Co., exchanging about 375,000 shares of Beatrice's preferred convertible preference stock valued at $37,500,000. John Sexton & Co. became an independent division of Beatrice Foods, still led by Mack Sexton (son of Franklin), William Egan (son of Helen), and William Sexton (son of Sherman). Mack became a vice president of Beatrice and a Beatrice board member. John Sexton & Co. put Beatrice Foods into the wholesale grocery business and Beatrice put John Sexton & Co. into the frozen foods business.Beatrice: From Buildup to Breakup, Gazel, Neil, University of Illinois Press, 1990, , . Beatrice's and the Sexton's leadership were interested in maximizing the investment in John Sexton & Co. by growing the company. = Final decade = Through the 1980s, Beatrice was a co-defendant alongside W. R. Grace and Company in a lawsuit alleging that the Riley Tannery, a division of Beatrice Foods, had dumped toxic waste which contaminated an underground aquifer that supplied drinking water to East Woburn, Massachusetts. The case became the subject of the popular book and film A Civil Action. Federal judge Walter Jay Skinner ruled that Beatrice was not responsible for the contamination, although according to the book and film, based on new evidence brought forward by the EPA later found, Judge Skinner reversed his verdict and found both companies responsible. In the 1980s, the firm operated in South Africa during apartheid. As a private company, the campaign of divestment could not lower its stock price and thus had no impact on its business activities. At the 87th annual meeting of Beatrice stockholders on June 5, 1984, stockholders of record were asked to change the name of the company. \\"Recognizing this clear departure from the past, we are proposing a new name for the company. At our annual meeting in June, stockholders will be asked to change the name to Beatrice Companies, Inc. from Beatrice Foods Co. This change is appropriate given the company's evolution and present composition. It reflects Beatrice's wide range of separate and distinct businesses, many with operations totally unrelated to food processing, yet retains the company's goodwill and reputation for quality products and services.\\" Annual Report, February 29, 1984. In June 1984, Beatrice acquired Esmark. The Esmark acquisition was part of the company's strategy to focus Beatrice's assets in food and consumer products businesses. In addition to several food brands, companies owned by Esmark included Avis Rent a Car, Playtex, Jensen Electronics, and STP. Because of Esmark's national brands, direct sales force, distribution network and research and development capabilities, its acquisition was expected to accelerate the attainment of Beatrice's marketing goals. The company also sought a higher public profile, adding their name to the end of their brands' television commercials, and sponsoring the Newman-Haas IndyCar racing team with driver Mario Andretti. Many analysts believe the Esmark acquisition, which was pushed by then Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President James L. Dutt, put too much of a debt load on Beatrice, which hurt Beatrice's credit rating and therefore deflated the value of Beatrice stock valuation. 1985, Beatrice sold their Beatrice Chemical division to Imperial Chemical Industries. Stahl Finish, Paule Chemical, Polyvinyl Chemical Industries, Converters Ink Company, and Thoro System Products were the business units that formed Beatrice Chemical.] Other divisions sold to pay off the debt from the Esmark purchase included Brillion Iron Works, World Dryer, STP, and Buckingham Wine (distributors of Cutty Sark whisky). In 1986, Beatrice became the target of leveraged buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. They ultimately took over the firm for US$8.7 billion ‚Äî at the time the largest leveraged buyout in history ‚Äî and over the next four years sold it off, division by division. In 1986, investment firm Wesray Capital Corporation, acquired Avis Rent a Car System for $263 million plus the assumption of debt. In 1986, Beatrice's Coca-Cola bottling operations (acquired by Beatrice in 1981) were acquired by The Coca- Cola Company for $1 billion. They were shortly spun off as Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Beatrice Bottled Water Division (acquired with the Coca-Cola operations) with brands such as Arrowhead Drinking Water, Ozarka Drinking Water, and Great Bear Drinking Water were also sold to Perrier in 1987. In December 1986, a group of Company executives, together with Drexel Burnham Lambert bought International Playtex, Inc. in a leveraged buyout and named the newly private organization Playtex Holdings. Playtex included such former Esmark brands as Max Factor, Playtex Living Gloves, Playtex Products, Almay, Jhirmack, and Halston/Orlane. The Beatrice Dairy Products, Inc., subsidiary, which included the brands of Meadow Gold, Hotel Bar Butter, Keller's Butter, Mountain High Yogurt, and Viva Milk Products, to Borden, Inc. in December 1986 for $315,000,000. Other divisions sold in 1986 included Americold and Danskin. Brands like Samsonite, Culligan, Stiffel Lamps, del mar window coverings, Louver Drape window coverings, Aristokraft kitchen cabinets, Day-Timer planner, Waterloo Industries tool boxes, Aunt Nellies and Martha White were merged into a new entity called E-II Holdings, which was later purchased by American Brands for 1.14 billion. E-II was created in June, 1987, as an umbrella company for several non-food and specialty food businesses of Beatrice. Meshulam Riklis bought E-II from American Brands in 1988; American Brands bought back Aristokraft, Day-Timer, Waterloo, Twentieth Century and Vogel Peterson. Tropicana Products, Inc. was sold to Seagram for $1.2 billion in 1988. All of the international operations were folded into a new entity called Beatrice International Holdings in 1987, which was later purchased that year through junk bond financing for $985 million by Reginald Lewis, a corporate attorney, creating TLC Beatrice International. TLC Beatrice International became the largest business in America run by an African American and the first company to reach a billion dollars in sales, with a black man at its head. TLC Beatrice sold the Canadian operations; Beatrice Foods Canada, Ltd., in 1990 to Onyx and then Beatrice Foods, Inc. later ended up in the hands of Parmalat in 1997. In 1987, KKR had formed a new entity, with similar intent as E-II Holdings, called Beatrice Company, which was specifically created to include Beatrice Cheese, Inc., Beatrice-Hunt/Wesson, Inc., and Swift-Eckrich, Inc.. In 1990, KKR sold Beatrice Company to CAGSUB, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ConAgra Foods (now Conagra Brands). Most of Beatrice's brand names still exist, but under various other owners, as trademarks and product lines were sold separately to the highest bidder. = Current era = The original Beatrice Companies, Inc. (Beatrice Foods Co. before 1984, and Beatrice Creamery Company before 1946) went dormant in the late 1980s, but was revived in 2007. The Beatrice of today goes by its 1984 name of Beatrice Companies, Inc., which was approved by the 1984 stockholder meeting.

The Canadian unit of Beatrice Foods was founded in 1969, and was separated from Beatrice Foods in 1978. Consequently, Beatrice's Canadian unit was not affected by the buyout of its founders and remained in business as one of Canada's largest food processing concerns. In 1997 Beatrice Foods Canada was acquired by Parmalat. At first, Parmalat decided to drop the Beatrice name from the company's products, but was reinstated in late 2005 during which the Italian parent company was being investigated.

The action takes place in vast outdoor environments and combat distances reach up to several hundred meters. The game has an emphasis on realism, with human enemies and the player alike being very vulnerable to damage from weapons, and projectiles being subject to wind conditions. Missions consist of a series of objectives while navigation points indicate what to do, the player is free to approach the targets as he sees fit. Objectives typically involve eliminating all hostile presence in a specific location, rescuing hostages, or destroying enemy vehicles and facilities. Many missions feature allied Delta Force teams which follow commands predefined by the mission design, and who can also be issued orders by the player. The player can view the positions of nearby enemies and friendly units through the use of a minimap on their HUD. = Game engine = The game continues to use NovaLogic's proprietary Voxel Space engine from its earlier games, including the original Delta Force and the Comanche series of helicopter combat simulators, known for its ability to render vast landscapes. This updated version of the engine is dubbed Voxel Space 32, as it is optimised for 32-bit graphics cards and does not support 16-bit cards anymore. All terrain is visualised by voxels while any characters, vehicles, structures or other details are polygonal. Unlike its predecessor, Delta Force 2 supports hardware acceleration. A new feature in Delta Force 2s version of the engine are stretched voxels which allow to simulate high grass, capable of masking characters at any distance.A view of the voxel terrain taken while parachuting. = Mission editor = The game includes a mission editor which allows the user to place objects, enemies, and objectives in one of the game's existing landscapes. Reception Delta Force 2 received a \\"Silver\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. Eric Bratcher reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Not quite as tense or pretty as Rainbow Six, this is still a great game for Green Beret wanna-bes.\\" The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator GameRankings. Computer Gaming World's Brett Todd gave Delta Force 2 two out of five stars, criticising the game for \\"abysmal graphics\\", non-existent sound effects and a lack of background information on the missions. He also criticised the need to carefully scan the screen for small enemies in the distance as well as the game's poor performance, forcing the player to play on a small resolution even on high-end hardware and further worsening the trouble with spotting enemies. He praised the mission design and multiplayer mode for up to 50 players, however. GameSpot's Michael E. was more enthusiastic, awarding the game 8.2 points out of 10.http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/delta- force-2-review/1900-2538576/ He particularly praised the mission design, calling it \\"generally excellent\\" and noting that the missions are usually \\"realistic and believable\\", with some exceptions more inspired by action films. He also praised the game's multiplayer mode and the sound design.

In 1943, she was converted to a hospital ship and commissioned as USS Bountiful (AH-9). Named for Marine Colonel Archibald Henderson, she was launched by Philadelphia Navy Yard on 17 June 1916; sponsored by Miss Genevieve W. Taylor, great-granddaughter of General Henderson; and commissioned at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 24 May 1917, Lt. C. W. Steel in command. She was the first ship to be fitted with stabilizing gyroscopes Service history With America's first convoy. The troop ships are the Henderson, Antilles, Momus and Lenape. =World War I, 1917‚Äì1918= Henderson arrived New York on 12 June 1917 and sailed two days later with Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves' Cruiser and Transport Force, which carried units of the American Expeditionary Force to France. In her holds she had space for 1,500 men and 24 mules. Reaching Saint-Nazaire on 27 June she disembarked troops and returned to Philadelphia on 17 July 1917. Subsequently, Henderson made eight more voyages to France with troops and supplies for the allies in the bitter European fighting. She established two large base hospitals in France during 1917. In constant danger from submarines, the transport was steaming near Army transport on 17 October 1917 when the latter was torpedoed. Henderson escaped attack by wrapping herself in an envelope of smoke. But torpedoes were not her only danger. She sailed for her seventh voyage on 30 June 1918 to France. A serious fire broke out in a cargo hold on 2 July 1918. Working throughout the night, and with Henderson listing as much as 15 degrees, and heavily rolling at times, making landing abreast possible on only one side, the destroyers and transferred her 1,600 troop passengers and baggage to the transport without loss of life, completing the transfer by 6:00 am on 3 July. Von Steuben continued on to Brest, France carrying 3,500 troops and their equipment. Determined firefighting crews soon brought the flames under control and Henderson returned to the U.S. with destroyers escorting. On 27 February, one day after departing Saint-Nazaire, troopship Finland 's steering gear jammed, forcing her into the path of Henderson. That ship was able to maneuver such that Finland only dealt her a glancing blow. Finland suffered only superficial damage; Henderson was holed below the waterline, but her crew took advantage of unusually calm February seas to repair the damage, and were soon able to proceed to New York. The transport was carrying a number of wounded soldiers back, to the United States. She sailed again from Philadelphia Tuesday 13 August 1918 and arrived at Brest, France Monday 25 August 1918. The Henderson may have rammed a U-boat that had just sunk tanker Frank W. Kellogg off the New Jersey coast on August 13, 1918. Lookouts sighted a submarine that was attempting to drive for a torpedo attack and Captain William R. Sayles ordered the rudder hard right attempting to run the enemy down. When the ship was next docked, it was found that her starboard bilge keel had been partly bent and broken. As there is no other explanation, it is believed that this damage was caused by striking the conning tower of the submarine as she was in the act of submerging. After the Armistice U-139 was inspected at Brest where it was noted that not only are the periscopes broken but the thin metal weather screen on the forward side of the conning tower was badly bent as the result of the collision. A German crew member, still on board, stated ‚Äúthe U-139 had encountered an American transport off the Atlantic coast, which had attempted to ram her, and had succeeded in breaking off both periscopes, so that for the remainder of the cruise the submarine was unable to attack while submerged.\\" U-139 was commanded by Lothar von Arnauld de la Periere the most successful submariner in the Kaiserliche Marine. Henderson in camouflage, 1918 =Caribbean, 1918‚Äì1923= Warren Harding and Florence Harding disembark from the USS Henderson at Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, July 26, 1923. Following the armistice, Henderson made eight more transatlantic voyages bringing home members of the A.E.F. She carried more than 10,000 veterans before returning to Philadelphia on December 27, 1919. She then took up duty as troop rotation ship for Marine units in the Caribbean, carrying Marines, their dependents, and supplies to bases in Cuba, Haiti, and other islands. She also participated in Marine training maneuvers in Florida before returning to Philadelphia on July 6, 1920. After an extended period of repairs, the transport resumed her duties in the Caribbean. This was interrupted from June 21 until July 21 as Henderson carried military and civilian leaders to observe the historic bombing tests off the Virginia Capes. During the next few years, she also performed ceremonial duties, embarking a congressional party to observe fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean in the spring of 1923, and carrying President Warren G. Harding on an inspection tour of Alaska in July. The President called at Metlakatla, Ketchikan, Wrangell, Juneau, Skagway, Seward, Valdez, Cordova and Sitka in Alaska, as well as Vancouver, Canada. He reviewed the fleet in Washington state's Elliott Bay from the deck of Henderson, before disembarking at Seattle on July 27, only six days before his death. =Pacific, 1924‚Äì1941= During Fleet Problem III in early 1924, Henderson participated in a mock amphibious invasion of the Panama Canal Zone. This major training operation by the fleet helped practice assault techniques and led to improved landing craft as well. The ship also aided in the protection of American interests in the volatile Caribbean states and in the Far East. Henderson arrived in Shanghai on 2 May 1927 with Marines for the garrison there, and remained in China for six months protecting American nationals in the war-torn country. Here members of her crew originated the \\"Domain of the Golden Dragon,\\" having cruised back and forth across the International Date Line. The troop transport was engaged in carrying replacements for the fleet and the Marines in China for the next fourteen years. =World War II, 1941‚Äì1943= Henderson was berthed beside Battleship row and had both troops and women and children on board. On December 6, Marines from the USS Oklahoma volunteered to escort the women and children back to California. When the attack happened, Japanese attack on 7 December 1941, the Henderson was outbound from Pearl Harbor.http://www.ww2pacific.com/selbach.html The Henderson cleared Pearl Harbor at the end of the attack. The captain feared that the Japanese flotilla would continue on to California, having eliminated any opposition from Hawaii. Henderson would be a slow, conspicuous, and solitary target in their path. He set course for Alaska to avoid being overcome, maintaining strict radio silence even in the face of repeated attempts by the Navy to contact the ship and verify its survival. Henderson then hugged the Pacific Northwest coast down to San Francisco Bay, arriving several days after it had been presumed missing in action. During the Pacific War, Henderson continued its service as a transport between California and Hawaii, making over 20 such voyages with fighting men, civilian passengers, and cargo. On her last voyage, she departed Port Hueneme on 18 July 1943 and arrived at Noum√©a with 71 much-needed nurses. The transport then sailed to the Solomon Islands with SeaBees before returning to San Francisco on 24 September 1943. Henderson was decommissioned on 13 October 1943 for conversion to a hospital ship at General Engineering & Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California. =Hospital ship, 1944‚Äì1946= USS Bountiful (AH-9) In a Southwestern Pacific port in 1944‚Äì45. (Official U.S. Navy Photograph #: 80-G-K-2138 (Color)) The ship was recommissioned as USS Bountiful (AH-9) on 23 March 1944, Comdr. G. L. Burns in command. Bountiful departed San Francisco on 1 April 1944 for Honolulu, returned later that month, and sailed once more on 1 May for the western Pacific. After brief service at Honolulu and Eniwetok, the ship arrived on 18 June at the Saipan invasion beaches. She made three passages to the hospitals on Kwajalein with casualties of the Marianas invasions. About this time Bountiful established one of the few blood banks in a Naval ship. The floating hospital remained at Manus until 17 September when she sailed for the Palaus to bring casualties of the Peleliu landing to hospitals in the Solomons. After November Bountiful operated between Leyte and the rear bases carrying veterans of the Philippines campaign. She departed Manus on 24 February 1945 for Ulithi and Saipan to receive casualties of the bitter Iwo Jima assault, and in the next months sailed to rendezvous with the fleet to take on wounded from Iwo Jima, Okinawa, and the fleet units themselves. Returning to Leyte Gulf on 15 June, she remained until 21 July, and then got underway for California. Bountiful arrived after war's end, sailing into San Francisco Bay on 21 August 1945. Bountiful was then assigned as hospital ship at Yokosuka, Japan, departing San Francisco 1 November 1945. She arrived on 24 November to support the occupation forces, and remained until 27 March 1946 when she sailed for San Francisco. After delivering her patients, the ship sailed on 26 May for the atomic tests at Bikini Atoll, and after providing medical services during the series of nuclear blasts during \\"Operation Crossroads\\", she returned to Seattle on 15 August 1946. =Decommissioning and sale= Bountiful was decommissioned on 13 September 1946, and was sold for scrap by the Maritime Commission on 28 January 1948 to Consolidated Builders, Inc., Seattle. Awards Bountiful received four battle stars for World War II service.

He is perhaps the best known figure in the obscure musical subgenre known as song poem music. Life and career He worked for several companies active in the song poem business, a practice also known as song sharking, and generally dismissed as a scam. Keith recorded hundreds of musical compositions based around lyrics sent in to song-poem companies by amateur songwriters, based upon small ads in the backs of mass market magazines promising success in the profitable field of songwriting. After a letter was sent by the company, the amateur songwriters would then be convinced to pay the company a fee to have a recording made and records pressed. Keith sang on many of these recordings as well as playing several different instruments, including saxophone, melodica, and all manner of keyboards. His earliest song-poem work was made for Sandy Stanton's Film City label in which he would build the entire track using a Chamberlin keyboard (a precursor to the mellotron). These early recordings have a woozy, distinctive sound that are like nothing else before or since. During the late 1960s he had his most prolific period working for Clarence Freed's Preview Records label in Los Angeles. Keith masterminded recording sessions for hundreds of 45s and dozens of albums, working with female singers Teri Thornton, Charlotte O'Hara, and Nita Garfield (who used \\"noms de disque\\" Teri Summers/Teri Marsh/Terri North, Bonnie Graham, and Nita Craig respectively). Thornton, a promising jazz vocalist in the late 1950s and early 1960s, had fallen on hard times, while the latter two were ambitious singers and songwriters who had had material recorded in the C&W; and R&B; markets. Keith, who was born into a religious household and was even a musical evangelist for a time, fell in with a hard-living crowd in Los Angeles during the late 1960s and early 1970s, experimenting with different psychedelics. Musically, Rodd Keith seemed at home and completely convincing in a wide variety of musical idioms, becoming almost chameleon-like (an attribute that not all song-poem performers shared). That said, his music is distinctive, with strong melodic hooks, dazzling keyboard playing, highly inventive (and sometimes lush) arrangements, and (depending on the musical style) a wide vocal vibrato. His music has many \\"eras\\", starting with the early Chamberlin recordings for the Film City label, elaborate jazzy arrangements for his early Preview records, and shambolic yet often compelling mellotron-drenched recordings for his later career. His recordings run the gamut of all the various subgenres of jazz, rock & roll, country, funk, soul and religious music. In December 1974, by which time he had moved over to Maury S. Rosen's MSR Records, Keith met his death on the Hollywood Freeway in Los Angeles. According to an article in the Los Angeles Times (which ran on December 16, 1974) Keith was seen \\"leaping or falling from an overcrossing onto the Hollywood Freeway,\\" and he \\"plunged down the Santa Monica Blvd. overpass onto the northbound freeway about 5:15 a.m. and drivers could not avoid him.\\" It has been suggested that this was a suicidal act, but Keith's heavy drug use at this time has led others to claim it was an accident.\\"Mysterious Death on Hollywood Freeway.‚Äô‚Äù Los Angeles Times. 16 Dec. 1975 In the 1990s, record collectors who seek out old vinyl recordings rediscovered these obscure discs. Several compilations of these songs were released on compact disc, including several which featured the work of Keith exclusively. Keith's son, avant-garde saxophonist Ellery Eskelin, provided commentary on these releases. Although Eskelin never actually met his father, he was told by many people that he was some kind of musical genius. Keith once remarked that he spelled \\"Rodd\\" with two d's because \\"God only used one.\\" This American Life, an NPR show, had an interview with Ellery Eskelin, who spoke about his discovery of his father's works. This show originally aired August 15, 1997.

It was built in 1958 and designed by Welton Becket. Architecture The building was made of reinforced concrete and combined elements of a theater, concert hall, and trade show and convention auditorium. Parabolic pylons supported the exterior grand cantilevered canopy fronting a glass curtain wall and brise soleil, a patterned wall that reduced the effects of the sun's glare.Martha Groves (June 29, 2013), Santa Monica Civic Auditorium to close after 55 years as cultural mecca Los Angeles Times.

The main hall of the Civic is adaptable for not only trade shows, but also sporting events, concerts, meetings, awards shows and other events. As a concert venue it can seat 3,000, as a banquet hall 720 in tables, and as a sports arena it can seat up to 2,500. The most widely touted innovation was the auditorium's main floor, which in a matter of seconds could be tilted by a hydraulic mechanism to form raked seating for theatrical productions or a flat surface for dancing or exhibits. The main floor of the auditorium can thus be raised or lowered to create a raked floor for theatre seating or a level floor for exhibits. The parcel includes the auditorium and surrounding land bounded on the north by the county building, on the west by Main Street, on the east by 4th Street and on the south by Pico Boulevard.Jay Goldman (July 10, 1986), 4,500-Seat Civic Could Be Razed or Renovated: Santa Monica Studies 4 Auditorium Plans Los Angeles Times. History The Santa Monica Civic Auditorium opened in summer 1958, then the second-largest auditorium in the Los Angeles area. It was constructed in what was formally known as Belmar, the first African American community in Santa Monica. The land was secured through the use of eminent domain. The $2.9-million city-owned project soon became an acclaimed music venue, for artists as varied as David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Frank Sinatra, Village People, Dave Brubeck, Laura Nyro, The Limeliters, Ella Fitzgerald, Free, Traffic, Prince, Tim Buckley and Bob Dylan. On October 28 and 29, 1964, the auditorium was host to the T.A.M.I. Show, a filmed concert featuring James Brown and The Rolling Stones. A home of the Academy Awards from 1961 to 1967, the auditorium remains home to the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra. Pink Floyd performed there on May 1, 1970. George Carlin's album Class Clown was recorded at the auditorium on May 27, 1972, and was released later that year on September 29. Carlin first performed his infamous monologue \\"Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television\\" at the show's finale. On July 21, 1972, Carlin was arrested and charged with violating obscenity laws after performing the routine at Summerfest. The Eagles performed three consecutive shows during The Long Run Tour on July 27‚Äì29, 1980. The show was recorded and mostly featured on their live album, entitled Eagles Live. Blue √ñyster Cult played in support of its Club Ninja album in March 1986; the show was recorded for radio broadcast, and several songs from the performance were finally made available as part of a box set in 2012, including the never-before released \\"Wings Of Mercury\\". On April 9, 1982, \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic made his first major appearance at the auditorium, when his band opened for Missing Persons. It was not a happy experience; \\"I got pelted for 45 minutes\\", he later said, \\"(with) anything that wasn't nailed down\\". In 1986, the Santa Monica City Council discussed a preliminary report containing four plans calling for various combinations of office buildings, a hotel, a museum, a conference center, a playhouse, parking garages and open space and, in two of the plans, demolition of the auditorium. By the 2000s, the Civic Auditorium was operating at an annual deficit of as much as $2 million, which the city has had to cover. The City of Santa Monica began to plan for a $51.9-million renovation using redevelopment funds and negotiated with the Nederlander Organization to book events. That effort was suspended after Governor Jerry Brown dissolved community redevelopment agencies. Per the Santa Monica Mirror newspaper, the auditorium was expected to close in July 2013 for at least five years. It needs at least $23 million in seismic and accessibly upgrades. A complete renovation would exceed $50 million. From an economic perspective, it would be cheaper to replace it, but many consider it a landmark worth preserving. The city has an annual budget of more than half of a billion dollars and is considering its priorities. Phish made their only appearance at the venue on December 10, 1994, which was the final show of their 1994 fall tour. \\"As of 2016 the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium is currently available for limited filming, photo shoots, private events, and meetings\\". The Civic Auditorium parking lot is also used for shows like the AltCar Expo Conference that took place in September 2016. The AltCar Expo features hi-tech electric vehicles equipped with latest technology.

Crandall as a generalization of the classical concept of what is meant by a 'solution' to a partial differential equation (PDE). It has been found that the viscosity solution is the natural solution concept to use in many applications of PDE's, including for example first order equations arising in dynamic programming (the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìBellman equation), differential games (the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìIsaacs equation) or front evolution problems, as well as second-order equations such as the ones arising in stochastic optimal control or stochastic differential games. The classical concept was that a PDE : F(x,u,Du,D^2 u) = 0 over a domain x\\\\in\\\\Omega has a solution if we can find a function u(x) continuous and differentiable over the entire domain such that x, u, Du, D^2 u satisfy the above equation at every point. If a scalar equation is degenerate elliptic (defined below), one can define a type of weak solution called viscosity solution. Under the viscosity solution concept, u does not need to be everywhere differentiable. There may be points where either Du or D^2 u does not exist and yet u satisfies the equation in an appropriate generalized sense. The definition allows only for certain kind of singularities, so that existence, uniqueness, and stability under uniform limits, hold for a large class of equations.  Definition  There are several equivalent ways to phrase the definition of viscosity solutions. See for example the section II.4 of Fleming and Soner's book Wendell H. Fleming, H. M . Soner., eds., (2006), Controlled Markov Processes and Viscosity Solutions. Springer, . or the definition using semi-jets in the Users Guide. ; Degenerate elliptic : An equation F(x,u,Du,D^2 u) = 0 in a domain \\\\Omega is defined to be degenerate elliptic if for any two symmetric matrices X and Y such that Y-X is positive definite, and any values of x \\\\in \\\\Omega, u \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} and p \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^n, we have the inequality F(x,u,p,X) \\\\geq F(x,u,p,Y) . For example, -\\\\Delta u = 0 is degenerate elliptic since in this case, F(x,u,p,X) = -\\\\text{trace}(X) , and the trace of X is the sum of its eigenvalues. Any real first order equation is degenerate elliptic. ; Subsolution : An upper semicontinuous function u in \\\\Omega is defined to be a subsolution of a degenerate elliptic equation in the viscosity sense if for any point x_0 \\\\in \\\\Omega and any C^2 function \\\\phi such that \\\\phi(x_0) = u(x_0) and \\\\phi \\\\geq u in a neighborhood of x_0, we have F(x_0,\\\\phi(x_0),D\\\\phi(x_0),D^2 \\\\phi(x_0)) \\\\leq 0 . ; Supersolution : A lower semicontinuous function u in \\\\Omega is defined to be a supersolution of a degenerate elliptic equation in the viscosity sense if for any point x_0 \\\\in \\\\Omega and any C^2 function \\\\phi such that \\\\phi(x_0) = u(x_0) and \\\\phi \\\\leq u in a neighborhood of x_0, we have F(x_0,\\\\phi(x_0),D\\\\phi(x_0),D^2 \\\\phi(x_0)) \\\\geq 0 . ; Viscosity solution : A continuous function u is a viscosity solution of the PDE if it is both a supersolution and a subsolution.  Example  Consider the boundary value problem u'(x) = 1, or F(u') = u' -1 = 0, on (-1,1) with boundary conditions u(-1) = u(1) = 0. The function u(x) = 1-x is the unique viscosity solution. To see this, note that the boundary conditions are satisfied, and u'(x) = 1 is well-defined on the interior except at x = 0. Thus, it remains to show that the conditions for subsolution and supersolution hold at x=0. First, suppose that \\\\phi(x) is any function differentiable at x=0 with \\\\phi(0) = u(0) = 1 and \\\\phi(x) \\\\geq u(x) near x=0. From these assumptions, it follows that \\\\phi(x) - \\\\phi(0) \\\\geq -x. For positive x, this inequality implies \\\\lim_{x \\\\to 0^+} \\\\frac{\\\\phi(x) - \\\\phi(0)}{x} \\\\geq -1, using that x / x = sgn(x) = 1 for x > 0. On the other hand, for x < 0, we have that \\\\lim_{x \\\\to 0^-} \\\\frac{\\\\phi(x) - \\\\phi(0)}{x} \\\\leq 1. Because \\\\phi is differentiable, the left and right limits agree and are equal to \\\\phi'(0), and we therefore conclude that \\\\phi'(0) \\\\leq 1, i.e., F(\\\\phi') \\\\leq 0. Thus, u is a subsolution. Moreover, the fact that u is a supersolution holds vacuously, since there is no function \\\\phi(x) differentiable at x=0 with \\\\phi(0) = u(0) = 1 and \\\\phi(x) \\\\leq u(x) near x=0. This implies that u is a viscosity solution. = Discussion = . The previous boundary value problem is an eikonal equation in a single spatial dimension with f = 1, where the solution is known to be the signed distance function to the boundary of the domain. Note also in the previous example, the importance of the sign of F. In particular, the viscosity solution to the PDE -F = 0 with the same boundary conditions is u(x) = x - 1. This can be explained by observing that the solution u(x) = 1-x is the limiting solution of the vanishing viscosity problem F(u') = [u']^2 - 1 = \\\\epsilon u as \\\\epsilon goes to zero, while u(x) = x - 1 is the limit solution of the vanishing viscosity problem -F(u') = 1 - [u']^2 = \\\\epsilon u. One can readily confirm that u_\\\\epsilon(x) = \\\\epsilon [\\\\ln(\\\\cosh(1/\\\\epsilon)) - \\\\ln(\\\\cosh(x/\\\\epsilon)) solves the PDE F(u') = [u']^2 - 1 = \\\\epsilon u for each epsilon. Further, the family of solutions u_\\\\epsilon converge toward the solution u = 1-x as \\\\epsilon vanishes (see Figure).  Basic properties  The three basic properties of viscosity solutions are existence, uniqueness and stability. * The uniqueness of solutions requires some extra structural assumptions on the equation. Yet it can be shown for a very large class of degenerate elliptic equations. It is a direct consequence of the comparison principle. Some simple examples where comparison principle holds are # u+H(x, abla u) = 0 with H uniformly continuous in x. # (Uniformly elliptic case) F(D^2 u, Du, u) = 0 so that F is Lipschitz with respect to all variables and for every r \\\\leq s and X \\\\geq Y, F(Y,p,s) \\\\geq F(X,p,r) + \\\\lambda X-Y for some \\\\lambda>0. * The existence of solutions holds in all cases where the comparison principle holds and the boundary conditions can be enforced in some way (through barrier functions in the case of a Dirichlet boundary condition). For first order equations, it can be obtained using the vanishing viscosity method or for most equations using Perron's method. There is a generalized notion of boundary condition, in the viscosity sense. The solution to a boundary problem with generalized boundary conditions is solvable whenever the comparison principle holds. * The stability of solutions in L^\\\\infty holds as follows: a locally uniform limit of a sequence of solutions (or subsolutions, or supersolutions) is a solution (or subsolution, or supersolution). More generally, the notion of viscosity sub- and supersolution is also conserved by half-relaxed limits.  History  The term viscosity solutions first appear in the work of Michael G. Crandall and Pierre-Louis Lions in 1983 regarding the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation. The name is justified by the fact that the existence of solutions was obtained by the vanishing viscosity method. The definition of solution had actually been given earlier by Lawrence C. Evans in 1980. Subsequently the definition and properties of viscosity solutions for the Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation were refined in a joint work by Crandall, Evans and Lions in 1984. For a few years the work on viscosity solutions concentrated on first order equations because it was not known whether second order elliptic equations would have a unique viscosity solution except in very particular cases. The breakthrough result came with the method introduced by Robert Jensen in 1988 to prove the comparison principle using a regularized approximation of the solution which has a second derivative almost everywhere (in modern versions of the proof this is achieved with sup-convolutions and Alexandrov theorem). In subsequent years the concept of viscosity solution has become increasingly prevalent in analysis of degenerate elliptic PDE. Based on their stability properties, Barles and Souganidis obtained a very simple and general proof of convergence of finite difference schemes. Further regularity properties of viscosity solutions were obtained, especially in the uniformly elliptic case with the work of Luis Caffarelli. Viscosity solutions have become a central concept in the study of elliptic PDE. In particular, Viscosity solutions are essential in the study of the infinity Laplacian. In the modern approach, the existence of solutions is obtained most often through the Perron method. The vanishing viscosity method is not practical for second order equations in general since the addition of artificial viscosity does not guarantee the existence of a classical solution. Moreover, the definition of viscosity solutions does not generally involve physical viscosity. Nevertheless, while the theory of viscosity solutions is sometimes considered unrelated to viscous fluids, irrotational fluids can indeed be described by a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this case, viscosity corresponds to the bulk viscosity of an irrotational, incompressible fluid. Other names that were suggested were Crandall‚ÄìLions solutions, in honor to their pioneers, L^\\\\infty-weak solutions, referring to their stability properties, or comparison solutions, referring to their most characteristic property.

Complications that occur primarily during childbirth are termed obstetric labor complications, and problems that occur primarily after childbirth are termed puerperal disorders. Severe complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium are present in 1.6% of mothers in the US, and in 1.5% of mothers in Canada. In the immediate postpartum period (puerperium), 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem. Long-term health problems (persisting after six months postpartum) are reported by 31% of women. In 2016, complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium resulted globally in 230,600 deaths, down from 377,000 deaths in 1990. The most common causes of maternal mortality are maternal bleeding, postpartum infections including maternal sepsis, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, obstructed labor, and pregnancy with abortive outcome, which includes miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and elective abortion. There is no clear distinction between complications of pregnancy and symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy. However, the latter do not significantly interfere with activities of daily living or pose any significant threat to the health of the mother or baby. Still, in some cases the same basic feature can manifest as either a discomfort or a complication depending on the severity. For example, mild nausea may merely be a discomfort (morning sickness), but if severe and with vomiting causing water-electrolyte imbalance it can be classified as a pregnancy complication (hyperemesis gravidarum). Maternal problems The following problems originate mainly in the mother. = Gestational diabetes = Gestational diabetes is when a woman without diabetes develops high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. = Hyperemesis gravidarum = Hyperemesis gravidarum is the presence of severe and persistent vomiting, causing dehydration and weight loss. It is more severe than the more common morning sickness and is estimated to affect 0.5‚Äì2.0% of pregnant individuals. =Pelvic girdle pain= * Caused by: Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) disorder is pain caused by instability and limitation of mobility and functioning in any of the three pelvic joints. PGP can begin peri or postpartum. For most pregnant individuals, PGP resolves in the weeks after delivery, but for some it can last for years, resulting in a reduced tolerance for weight bearing activities. PGP affects around 45% of individuals during pregnancy: 25% report serious pain and 8% are severely disabled.Pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPP), I: Terminology, clinical presentation, and prevalence European Spine Journal Vol 13, No. 7 / Nov. 2004 W. H. Wu, O. G. Meijer, K. Uegaki, J. M. A. Mens, J. H. van Die√´n, P. I. J. M. Wuisman, H. C. √ñstgaard. * Treatment: The treatment modality is based on the severity. A mild case would require rest, rehabilitation therapy and pain is usually manageable. More severe cases would also include mobility aids, strong analgesics and sometimes surgery. One of the main factors in helping women cope is with education, information and support. Many treatment options are available. =High blood pressure= Potential severe hypertensive states of pregnancy are mainly: * Preeclampsia ‚Äì gestational hypertension, proteinuria (>300 mg), and edema. Severe preeclampsia involves a BP over 160/110 (with additional signs). It affects 5‚Äì8% of pregnancies.Villar J, Say L, Gulmezoglu AM, Meraldi M, Lindheimer MD, Betran AP, Piaggio G; Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia: a health problem for 2000 years. In Pre-eclampsia, Critchly H, MacLean A, Poston L, Walker J, eds. London, RCOG Press, 2003, pp. 189‚Äì207. * Eclampsia ‚Äì seizures in a pre- eclamptic patient, affect around 1.4% of pregnancies. * Gestational hypertension * HELLP syndrome ‚Äì Hemolytic anemia, elevated liver enzymes and a low platelet count. Incidence is reported as 0.5‚Äì0.9% of all pregnancies. * Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is sometimes included in the preeclamptic spectrum. It occurs in approximately one in 7,000 to one in 15,000 pregnancies. =Venous thromboembolism= Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a form of venous thromboembolism (VTE), has an incidence of 0.5 to 7 per 1,000 pregnancies, and is the second most common cause of maternal death in developed countries after bleeding.Ven√∂s tromboembolism (VTE) ‚Äì Guidelines for treatment in C counties. Bengt Wahlstr√∂m, Emergency department, Uppsala Academic Hospital. January 2008 * Caused by: Pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability as a physiological response in preparation for the potential bleeding during childbirth. * Treatment: Prophylactic treatment, e.g. with low molecular weight heparin may be indicated when there are additional risk factors for deep vein thrombosis. =Anemia= Levels of hemoglobin are lower in the third trimesters. According to the United Nations (UN) estimates, approximately half of pregnant individuals suffer from anemia worldwide. Anemia prevalences during pregnancy differed from 18% in developed countries to 75% in South Asia. Treatment varies due to the severity of the anaemia, and can be used by increasing iron containing foods, oral iron tablets or by the use of parenteral iron. =Infection= A pregnant woman is more susceptible to certain infections. This increased risk is caused by an increased immune tolerance in pregnancy to prevent an immune reaction against the fetus, as well as secondary to maternal physiological changes including a decrease in respiratory volumes and urinary stasis due to an enlarging uterus. Pregnant individuals are more severely affected by, for example, influenza, hepatitis E, herpes simplex and malaria. The evidence is more limited for coccidioidomycosis, measles, smallpox, and varicella. Mastitis, or inflammation of the breast occurs in 20% of lactating individuals. Some infections are vertically transmissible, meaning that they can affect the child as well. = Peripartum cardiomyopathy = Peripartum cardiomyopathy is decrease in heart function which occurs in the last month of pregnancy, or up to six months post-pregnancy. It increases the risk of congestive heart failure, heart arrhythmias, thromboembolism, and cardiac arrest. =Hypothyroidism= Hypothyroidism (also called Hashimoto's disease) is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid in pregnant individuals. This condition can have a profound effect during pregnancy and on the child. The infant may be seriously affected and have a variety of birth defects. Many pregnant individuals with Hashimoto's disease develop an underactive thyroid. The clinician will do an exam and order one or more tests. Fetal and placental problems The following problems occur in the fetus or placenta, but may have serious consequences on the mother as well. =Ectopic pregnancy= Ectopic pregnancy is implantation of the embryo outside the uterus * Caused by: Unknown, but risk factors include smoking, advanced maternal age, and prior surgery or trauma to the fallopian tubes. * Treatment: In most cases, keyhole surgery must be carried out to remove the fetus, along with the fallopian tube. If the pregnancy is very early, it may resolve on its own, or it can be treated with methotrexate, an abortifacient. = Miscarriage = Miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy prior to 20 weeks. In the UK, miscarriage is defined as the loss of a pregnancy during the first 23 weeks. =Placental abruption= Placental abruption is the separation of the placenta from the uterus. * Caused by: Various causes; risk factors include maternal hypertension, trauma, and drug use. * Treatment: Immediate delivery if the fetus is mature (36 weeks or older), or if a younger fetus or the mother is in distress. In less severe cases with immature fetuses, the situation may be monitored in hospital, with treatment if necessary. = Placenta praevia = Placenta praevia is when the placenta fully or partially covers the cervix. = Placenta accreta = Placenta accreta is an abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterine wall. =Multiple pregnancies= Multiples may become monochorionic, sharing the same chorion, with resultant risk of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Monochorionic multiples may even become monoamniotic, sharing the same amniotic sac, resulting in risk of umbilical cord compression and entanglement. In very rare cases, there may be conjoined twins, possibly impairing function of internal organs. =Vertically transmitted infection= The embryo and fetus have little or no immune function. They depend on the immune function of their mother. Several pathogens can cross the placenta and cause (perinatal) infection. Often microorganisms that produce minor illness in the mother are very dangerous for the developing embryo or fetus. This can result in spontaneous abortion or major developmental disorders. For many infections, the baby is more at risk at particular stages of pregnancy. Problems related to perinatal infection are not always directly noticeable. The term TORCH complex refers to a set of several different infections that may be caused by transplacental infection. Babies can also become infected by their mother during birth. During birth, babies are exposed to maternal blood and body fluids without the placental barrier intervening and to the maternal genital tract. Because of this, blood- borne microorganisms (hepatitis B, HIV), organisms associated with sexually transmitted disease (e.g., gonorrhoea and chlamydia), and normal fauna of the genito-urinary tract (e.g., Candida) are among those commonly seen in infection of newborns. =Intrauterine bleeding= There have been rare but known cases of intrauterine bleeding caused by injury inflicted by the fetus with its fingernails or toenails.  General risk factors  Factors increasing the risk (to either the pregnant individual, the fetus/es, or both) of pregnancy complications beyond the normal level of risk may be present in the pregnant individual's medical profile either before they become pregnant or during the pregnancy. These pre-existing factors may related to the individual's genetics, physical or mental health, their environment and social issues, or a combination of those. = Biological = Some common biological risk factors include: *Age of either parent **Adolescent parents ***Adolescent mothers are at an increased risk of developing certain complications, including preterm birth and low infant birth weight. **Older parents ***individuals are at an increased risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth as they age. Complications for those 45 or older include increased risk of primary Caesarean delivery (i.e. C-section). * Height: Pregnancy in individuals whose height is less than 1.5 meters (5 feet) correlates with higher incidences of preterm birth and underweight babies. Also, these individuals are more likely to have a small pelvis, which can result in such complications during childbirth as shoulder dystocia. *Weight **Low weight: individuals whose pre-pregnancy weight is less than 45.5 kilograms (100 pounds) are more likely to have underweight babies. **Obese individuals are more likely to have very large babies, potentially increasing difficulties in childbirth. Obesity also increases the chances of developing gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, preeclampsia, experiencing postterm pregnancy and requiring a cesarean delivery. *Pre-existing disease in pregnancy, or an acquired disease: A disease and condition not necessarily directly caused by the pregnancy, such as diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, lupus in pregnancy or thyroid disease in pregnancy. *Risks arising from previous pregnancies **Complications experienced during a previous pregnancy are more likely to recur. **Many previous pregnancies: individuals who have had five previous pregnancies face increased risks of very rapid labor and excessive bleeding after delivery. **Multiple previous fetuses: individuals who have had more than one fetus in a previous pregnancy face increased risk of mislocated placenta. *Multiple pregnancy: Having more than one fetus in a single pregnancy. = Environmental = 810 women die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth, 94% occur in low and lower middle- income countries. Some common environmental risk factors include: *Exposure to environmental toxins in pregnancy *Exposure to recreational drugs in pregnancy **Ethanol during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. **Tobacco smoking and pregnancy, when combined, causes twice the risk of premature rupture of membranes, placental abruption and placenta previa.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2007. Preventing Smoking and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Before, During, and After Pregnancy . Also, it causes 30% higher odds of the baby being born prematurely.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2009. Tobacco Use and Pregnancy: Home. **Prenatal cocaine exposure is associated with, for example, premature birth, birth defects and attention deficit disorder. **Prenatal methamphetamine exposure can cause premature birth and congenital abnormalities. Other investigations have revealed short-term neonatal outcomes to include small deficits in infant neurobehavioral function and growth restriction when compared to control infants. Also, prenatal methamphetamine use is believed to have long-term effects in terms of brain development, which may last for many years. **Cannabis in pregnancy is possibly associated with adverse effects on the child later in life. * Ionizing radiation * Social and socioeconomic factors: Generally speaking, unmarried individuals and those in lower socioeconomic groups experience an increased level of risk in pregnancy, due at least in part to lack of access to appropriate prenatal care. *Unintended pregnancy: Unintended pregnancies preclude preconception care and delays prenatal care. They preclude other preventive care, may disrupt life plans and on average have worse health and psychological outcomes for the mother and, if birth occurs, the child. *Exposure to pharmaceutical drugs in pregnancy: Anti- depressants, for example, may increase risks of such outcomes as preterm delivery. =High-risk pregnancy= Some disorders and conditions can mean that pregnancy is considered high-risk (about 6-8% of pregnancies in the USA) and in extreme cases may be contraindicated. High-risk pregnancies are the main focus of doctors specialising in maternal-fetal medicine. Serious pre- existing disorders which can reduce a woman's physical ability to survive pregnancy include a range of congenital defects (that is, conditions with which the woman herself was born, for example, those of the heart or reproductive organs, some of which are listed above) and diseases acquired at any time during the woman's life.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson. History Salpointe Catholic High School is named for Arizona's first Bishop, Jean-Baptiste Salpointe, who worked as a missionary in the Arizona Territory from 1866 to 1885. In the late 1940s, Tucson's parochial grammar schools had nine grades. The desire to build a Catholic high school for these graduates prompted the Diocese of Tucson to purchase the 40-acre () Florence Addition. Salpointe Catholic High School began in 1950 as a modest school consisting of what is now the Farr Patio and cafeteria. On the first day of school, Salpointe opened its doors to 100 students. At this time, Tucson High School and Amphitheater High School were the only other high schools in Tucson. Salpointe had nine classrooms, a library and administrative offices. The first principal was Rev. Victor Stoner. He was followed by Rev. Edward Carscallen and Rev. George Dyke. In the summer of 1952, Msgr. Francis Green, pastor of Ss. Peter and Paul Parish, visited the Chancery Office in Chicago where he met Rev. Romaeus O'Brien, O. Carm. He mentioned that Bishop Daniel Gercke of Tucson was thinking about asking a religious order to operate Salpointe. In the spring of 1953, Msgr. Green made a formal request that the Carmelites come to Tucson. Rev. Joseph Bonaventure Gilmore, O. Carm., Provincial Counselor, and Rev. Kenneth Moore, O. Carm., Assistant Provincial, met with Msgr. Green, Msgr. Don Hughes, President of the Salpointe School Board, and other pastors. Fr. Gilmore became the first Carmelite Principal in the summer of 1953. In August, he wrote to Rev. Raphael Kieffer, O. Carm., Carmelite Provincial, asking that the two promised Carmelites arrive as soon as possible. The day school opened, Fr. Frank Florian McCarthy, O. Carm., and Fr. Carl Pfister, O. Carm. arrived from Mt. Carmel High School in Chicago. The original faculty consisted of three Carmelites, six Sisters of St. Joseph, three Sisters of Charity of Seton Hill, two Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and one Benedictine. Two laymen and one laywoman were also on the staff. On September 8, 1955, Bishop Gercke transferred ownership of the forty acres and buildings, then known as Salpointe High School, to the Carmelites for \\"$10.00 and other valuable considerations.\\" Much of Salpointe's early development (1954‚Äì1966) was due to the generosity of Helena S. Corcoran (with the support of her husband) who donated $8‚Äì$10 million for expansion of the Salpointe campus. Under her sponsorship, the school grew from 400 to 1,000 pupils, and the physical infrastructure that forms much of today's campus was established. In 1993, the Catalina Foothills Unified School District went before the U.S. Supreme Court to argue that it did not have to provide an American Sign Language interpreter to a deaf student attending Salpointe Catholic High School. The district argued that, while the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act would normally require such services if the student attended public school, providing it for religious instruction at Salpointe would be unconstitutional. In Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, the court found \\"that the Establishment Clause does not bar the school district from providing the requested interpreter.\\" Admissions=Policies and procedures= Admissions decisions are made on the basis of information provided on several application forms, recommendations, transcripts, and a personal interview. The admissions process starts in the fall of each year, before a student intends to enroll at Salpointe. Several important admissions- related events are held at Salpointe including Open House and Step Up Day. Transfer and mid-year applications are accepted for consideration throughout the year. Administrative structure=\\"President/Principal\\" model= The administration of the school consists of nine members headed by the President. Answering to the President are the Principal, Director of Operations, the Director of Athletics, the Director of Campus Ministry, the Assistant Principal for Faculty Development and Supervision, Assistant Principal for Student Services, the Director of Counseling and the Director of Advancement. =Board of Members and Board of Directors= The Board of Members consists of the members of the Provincial Council of the Society of Mount Carmel of Illinois (the Most Pure Heart of Mary Province of the Carmelite Order). Members serve for a term of three years. The purpose, philosophy, and mission of Salpointe Catholic are the responsibility of the Board of Members. They also select and terminate the president of the school and the slate of candidates for principal. Certain financial measures require the approval of the Board of Members as well as any changes to the Articles of Incorporation and changes in the bylaws. The Board of Directors is a committee of up to 18 members serving as the policy making body for the school. Membership consists of up to four representatives of the Carmelite community and at least 10 members of the community at large. As trustees for the Carmelite Order, this Board oversees the administration of the school, makes policies affecting all areas of school operations, oversees its financial well-being and plans extensively for the future. Academics=Overview= Salpointe offers a four-year program with seven classes per year for all students. Salpointe curriculum requirements for the class of 2014-2015 include four credits in English, four credits in Mathematics, four credits in Theology, three credits in Science, three and half credits in Social Studies, two credits in the same World Language, one credit in Exercise Science, one credit in Fine Arts, a half credit in Career and Technology Education, a half credit in Service Learning, and three and a half credits in electives. Twenty-seven credits are required to graduate. The student/teacher ratio is 15:1. The North Central Association of Colleges and Schools named Salpointe the first college preparatory school in Southern Arizona in 1987 because of its college prep curriculum. Salpointe was the third school in the state to receive this classification following Brophy and Xavier in Phoenix. The school is also certified by the Western Catholic Education Association. =College preparatory education= A selection of students from Salpointe's graduating class of 2015 All courses are college-preparatory. Humanities, Advanced Placement and honors courses are offered. Salpointe has a high school to college conversion rate of 95%. 245 students in the Class of 2015 were admitted to 175 colleges, universities and military academies. 80% matriculated to four-year institutions, 15% matriculated to two-year institutions and 5% selected military service or work. 56% of seniors participated in varsity athletics and all 24 athletic teams averaged a 3.5 GPA or higher. =Humanities program= The Humanities program is a challenging two-year program offered to highly motivated students. Established in 1978, the program provides an integrated, interdisciplinary, multi-cultural approach needed by students to actively take part in their communities and a complex global universe. All final placements in Humanities require department approval. This program fulfills English and Fine Arts requirements for graduation. =STEM program= STEM Center In 2015, Salpointe opened their Cracchiolo Family Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Center. The 8,000 square-foot building was part of a $12 million capital campaign that also funded a new athletics complex and student center. The STEM center focuses on engineering, robotics and biotechnology and includes a 3D printer, a biomedical lab, classrooms and outdoor work spaces. Salpointe's STEM program is one of the first integrated STEM high school curricula in Southern Arizona. As of 2016, the courses offered in the STEM program include Engineering 102, Engineering Fundamentals, Intermediate Robotics, Mechanical Engineering and Design, Advanced Robotics, Biotechnology, and Environmental Engineering. Athletics Over 85% of students participate in co-curricular activities each year. Salpointe sponsors 24 varsity athletic teams competing primarily at the Division II level. Lancers have accumulated the largest number of AIA Scholar-Athlete awards in the State of Arizona and have won 259 Region Championships, 46 State Runner-Up and 27 State Championships in various sports, including football State Championship in 2013.

It is a flat linked chain or flat strap that runs under the chin groove of the horse, between the bit shank's purchase arms. It has a buckle or hook attachment and English designs have a \\"fly link\\" in the middle to hold a lip strap. On English bridles the horse is bridled with the curb chain undone on one side, then connected once on the horse. On western bridles, the curb chain is kept buckled to both sides of the bit. Action A curb strap on a Western style curb bit A curb chain on a Pelham bit The main use of the curb chain is to enhance and control the lever action of a curb bit. Additionally, it helps to keep the bit steady and in place within the mouth. On English pelham and double bridles the curb chin is attached by a ring (\\"fly link\\" (UK)) to a lip strap, which helps keep the lip strap in place while the lip strap in turn prevents the curb chain from being lost if it becomes unhooked. The curb chain applies pressure to the curb groove under a horse's chin when the curb rein of the bit is used. When the curb rein is pulled, the shank of the bit rotates back towards the chest of the horse and the cheek (upper shank) of the bit rotates forward (since it is a lever arm). The curb chain is attached to the rings at the end of the cheek, so, as the cheek moves forward, the chain is pulled and tightened in the curb groove. Once it comes in contact with the curb groove of the horse it acts as a fulcrum, causing the cannons of the bit mouthpiece to push down onto the horse's bars, thus amplifying the bit's pressure on the bars of the horse's mouth. Adjustment The tightness of the curb chain has a great effect on the action of the bit. If the bit is used without a curb chain, it loses its leverage action. If used with a loose curb chain, it allows the shanks to rotate more before the curb chain is tight enough to act as a fulcrum and exert pressure. This extra rotation can warn the horse before pressure is exerted on his mouth, so he may respond beforehand. Conversely, a very loose curb chain can be undesirable, allowing the bit to rotate in the mouth too much, causing the port, especially a high port, to become too vertical and press against the palate, which is painful, can damage the mouth in extreme cases, and can cause the horse to gape. Additionally, it can completely nullify the correct action of the curb, making its use pointless. There are two undesirable consequences when using a very tight curb chain. First, the bit immediately exerts curb pressure and increased pressure on the bars as soon as pressure is applied to the reins. Therefore, a tight curb chain is much harsher, and provides less finesse in signaling the horse than a looser curb chain would, as the horse is never given a chance to respond before the curb chain engages. Secondly, an extremely tight curb chain causes the mouthpiece to constantly push down on the sensitive tongue, never allowing the horse relief. A curb chain is generally adjusted so it comes into action when the shank rotates 45 degrees back. However, skilled riders with experience with the curb bit may adjust the chain tighter to accommodate the needs of the individual horse, type of equipment, and training situation. However, keeping the curb chain looser allows more accommodation for rider error. The curb chain should be applied by twisting it clockwise on one hook until it is flat, and then attaching it to the other hook. A twisted curb chain is far harsher in its effect than a flat one. Differences in chains Curb chains vary in width and linkage. Thinner curb chains are more severe, ones that are too thin are banned in competition, and any curb chain could cause sores if the chain is not adjusted properly and used with discretion. For horses that are sensitive or that are rubbed by the chain, a cover made of rubber, neoprene, leather, or gel can be used, or a leather curb strap. However, it is important that the rider check that the curb is being used correctly and is not the cause of the rubs. References Price, Steven D., ed.The Whole Horse Catalogue.

It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Set within the fictional Liberty City, based on New York City, the single-player story follows Eastern European war veteran Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands. The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting. Two expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists. Development of Grand Theft Auto IV began soon after the release of San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game introduced a shift to a more realistic and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV lacked a strong cinematic influence, as the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part of their research for the open world, the development team conducted extensive field research in New York, capturing over 100,000 photographs and several hours of video. The developers considered the world to be the most important elements of the game; though not the largest map in the series, they considered it comparable in scope due to its verticality and level of detail. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles in April 2008, and for Microsoft Windows in December. Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at the narrative and open world design. Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning in its first day and in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It is among the best-selling video games with over 25 million copies sold by 2013. The game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and players' ability to drive under the influence of alcohol. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.  Gameplay  Grand Theft Auto IV is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Players complete missions‚Äîlinear scenarios with set objectives‚Äîto progress through the story. It is possible to have several active missions running at one time, as some require players to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game's open world and complete optional side missions. Composed of the fictional city of Liberty City, the world is larger in area than most earlier Grand Theft Auto series entries. At the beginning of the game, players can only explore the first island‚Äîcomposed of Dukes and Broker‚Äîwith all other islands unlocking as the story progresses. Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies, and may run, jump, swim or use vehicles to navigate the game's world. There is a first-person perspective option when using vehicles. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system can be used as assistance against enemies. Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated by eating, using medical kits, or calling for paramedics. If players commit crimes, the game's law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a \\"wanted\\" meter in the head- up display (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive). Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a cool-down mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers' line of sight. alt=The player character positioned in cover behind a vehicle, preparing to shoot at police officers on the other side of the vehicle. The game's cover system allows players to move between cover, to fire blindly, aim freely, and target a specific enemy. Individual body parts can also be targeted. Melee attacks include additional moves, such as dodging, blocking, disarming an opponent and counter-attacking. Body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops, and players respawn at the nearest hospital. The single-player mode lets players control an Eastern European war veteran, Niko Bellic. During the story, Niko meets and befriends various new characters. They can then perform favours for Niko whenever he asks; for example, his cousin Roman, who owns a taxi service, can send one of his cabs to take Niko to any destination around the city. Cabs are always available during gameplay for quick travel to a destination. Throughout the course of the game, players are also faced with morality choices, which alter the storyline appropriately depending on the player's choice. While free roaming the game world, players may engage in context-specific activities such as bowling or darts. Other available activities include a vigilante mini-game, and in-game television programming. Niko has a smartphone for contacting friends and starting activities. The smartphone is also used to access the game's online multiplayer mode, and to enter cheat codes. To access the in- game Internet, which allows Niko to send and receive emails and set up prospective dates with potential girlfriends, Niko can use Internet caf√©s located around the city. The game also features a subway system, allowing players to quickly traverse through the game's world. The online multiplayer mode for Grand Theft Auto IV allows up to 32 players to freely roam across the map. Players decide which game mode they wish to play, including deathmatches and street races. Both cooperative and competitive game modes are available, split into ranked and unranked matches. For players to level up through ranks, in-game money has to be earned. The game also features a Free Mode, in which players have the entire map open to explore, with no end goal or mission to complete. Hosts of the game can control many variables, such as police presence, traffic, and weapons. The multiplayer mode was discontinued on Windows in 2020.  Synopsis = Setting = Grand Theft Auto IV takes place in 2008, within a redesigned version of Liberty City. The design of the setting focuses on a recreation of four of the boroughs of New York City: Broker (based on Brooklyn), Dukes (Queens), Bohan (The Bronx), and Algonquin (Manhattan). Initially, bridges are locked down due to a terrorist threat, and players are constantly pursued by police if the bridges are crossed, but the blockades are lifted as the story progresses, allowing the player to traverse between islands. Grand Theft Auto IV takes place in a different storyline and timeline from the previous games in the series. However, the game takes place in the same canon as its expansion packs, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, and its successor, Grand Theft Auto V. Most of the setting would be later used for the handheld game Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars (2009), with the exception of Alderney. = Plot = Niko Bellic, an Eastern European, Sam Houser: \\"He's from that gray part of broken-down Eastern Europe, a war- torn area.\\" arrives in Liberty City aboard a cargo ship, the Platypus, to reunite with his cousin Roman, pursue the American Dream, and search for the man who betrayed his unit in a war fifteen years prior. Upon arrival, however, Niko discovers that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loan sharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment in Broker and runs a small taxi company. While carrying out jobs for Roman, Niko makes his first criminal contacts, including Yardies underboss Little Jacob, whom he befriends, and Vlad Glebov, Roman's Russian loan shark, whom he eventually kills upon learning he slept with Roman's girlfriend, Mallorie. In retaliation, Niko and Roman are kidnapped by Russian mobsters on orders of Mikhail Faustin and his deputy Dimitri Rascalov. Not bothered by Vlad's murder, Faustin hires Niko, who quickly discovers Faustin's true nature after being ordered to kill the son of Kenny Petroviƒá, Liberty City's most powerful Russian mob boss. When Petroviƒá threatens retaliation, Dimitri convinces Niko to assassinate Faustin in order to make amends, but later betrays and brings Niko before his former employer Ray Bulgarin, who accuses him of stealing from him a few years earlier. After Niko denies the allegation, a firefight ensues, allowing Dimitri and Bulgarin to escape. Niko and Roman are forced to flee to Bohan after their apartment and taxi company are burned down by Dimitri's men. While working for a few local drug lords in an attempt to secure a better lifestyle and locate the traitor, Niko continues his conflict with Dimitri, saving Roman after he is kidnapped, and discovers that his girlfriend Michelle is a government agent actually named Karen. She entraps Niko into working for her company, known only by its cover: United Liberty Paper, for whom Niko carries out several assassinations in exchange for clearing his criminal record and assistance in finding the traitor of his unit. Niko and Roman's fortunes suddenly improve when the latter receives a large amount of insurance money from his destroyed business, which he uses to rebuild it and buy an apartment in Algonquin. Roman also proposes to Mallorie, who accepts. While working for the Irish Mob, Niko befriends Patrick McReary after helping him carry out a bank robbery, who introduces him to Ray Boccino, a caporegime in the Pegorino Mafia family. Upon assisting on a major diamond deal that goes awry, Boccino helps Niko locate the man he believed to be the traitor, only to realize he was mistaken, and introduces him to Don Jimmy Pegorino for more work. After suspecting Boccino of being a police informant, Pegorino orders Niko to kill him. Meanwhile, Niko also works for the Gambetti family in exchange for assistance in tracking down Darko Brevic, the real traitor, and helps Patrick kidnap the daughter of the Ancelotti family's Don to ransom her for the diamonds, but they are lost due to Bulgarin's unexpected interference. Eventually, the Paper tracks down Darko and brings him into Liberty City for Niko to decide his fate. Having achieved closure on his past, Niko is summoned by Pegorino for one final favour: to help with an extremely lucrative deal on heroin in collusion with Dimitri. Niko must either strike a deal with Dimitri, or exact revenge on him. Should Niko go through with the deal, Dimitri again betrays him and takes the heroin for himself. At Roman's wedding, an assassin sent by Dimitri unintentionally kills Roman with a stray bullet. Aided by Little Jacob, a devastated and vengeful Niko kills Dimitri, who in turn killed Pegorino. Later, Mallorie informs Niko that she is pregnant with Roman's child, whom he vows to protect. Should Niko choose to exact revenge, he storms the Platypus and fights his way through Dimitri's men, ultimately killing him. At Roman's wedding, Pegorino, furious after Niko's betrayal, targets him in a drive-by shooting, but accidentally kills Niko's new girlfriend, Patrick's sister Kate. Aided by Little Jacob and Roman, Niko kills Pegorino, who had been targeted by the Liberty City underworld. Later, Roman informs Niko that Mallorie is pregnant, and that if the baby is a girl, they will name her in Kate's memory.  Development  alt= Preliminary work on Grand Theft Auto IV began in November 2004, a month after the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Rockstar president Sam Houser felt that following up San Andreas was \\"a nightmare\\". Rockstar North, the core 220-person team behind the game, co-opted studios owned by parent company Rockstar Games to facilitate development between a full team of over 1,000, including 50 employees at Rockstar NYC, 40 at Rockstar Lincoln, 10 at Rockstar San Diego, and around 600‚Äì700 working part-time internally and externally. Some key members of the development team worked 12-hour days during production, often without holidays. The team decided to continue the numbering scheme absent from the previous two main games to represent the same leap in production as Grand Theft Auto 2 (1999) to Grand Theft Auto III (2001). Development of Grand Theft Auto IV ceased by 21 April 2008 when the game was submitted for manufacturing. Producer Leslie Benzies estimated that the budget of the development efforts exceeded , making Grand Theft Auto IV one of the most expensive video game ever made. = Research and open world design = The game's setting, Liberty City, is based on New York City. The team did not look at the previous renditions of Liberty City as inspiration, wanting it to retain the \\"general feel\\" but nothing else. The map is roughly three times the size of Grand Theft Auto IIIs. The developers originally considered using the entire state of New York, before restricting it to Manhattan, and then expanding it out again. They considered including more suburbs with woods, and would regularly vote on which areas to include. Art director Aaron Garbut said that the team chose the setting because of the detail and variety it provided, describing New York as \\"an amazing, diverse, vibrant, cinematic city\\". Writer Dan Houser added that the team \\"wanted to be somewhere where we had a foothold\\" due to the amount of research required for the world; Rockstar Games's main headquarters are located in New York. The team consciously avoided a precise recreation of New York City to allow for more enjoyable game design, selecting the areas that they felt \\"characterised it the best\\". Garbut wanted to capture a caricature of the city as he felt that most people were familiar with \\"the highlights\\" from film or literature but did not need to know the areas precisely. The city was not built with specific missions in mind; the area was created first, and missions implemented later. To achieve a realistic environment, 60‚Äì70 employees from Rockstar North travelled to New York for research: first at the beginning of the project in March or April 2005 for a week and a half, and a smaller trip in 2007. Police officers who previously worked the beat drove the team around Washington Heights. A full- time research team based in New York handled further requests for information, such as the ethnic minority of a neighbourhood or videos of traffic patterns. Videos shot in New York were played on televisions at the Rockstar North offices \\"so while they worked they could look up and there was New York\\". Benzies claimed that the team took over 100,000 photographs on location in New York, though Garbut estimates that they took around 250,000. They also studied architectural plans for apartments, used satellite images to determine city block layout, researched sales figures for models' of cars, and read books that detailed the city's infrastructure, including its subways, sewers, and garbage disposal. Hove Beach is based on Brighton Beach, which Sam Houser found \\"pretty incredible\\" and unusual; the name is based on the English city Brighton and Hove, made up of the former neighbouring towns Brighton and Hove. Houser appreciated that Brighton Beach was home to several Eastern Europeans due to the nature of the game's characters. Dan Houser described Liberty City as \\"the biggest character\\" of the game. The Grand Theft Auto IV rendition of Liberty City is more detailed and larger in size than most earlier entries in the series; although smaller than San Andreas, the setting of the previous main game, the developers considered it comparable in scope due to city's verticality, number of buildings, and level of detail. The team wanted less dead spots and irrelevant spaces, such as the wide open deserts in San Andreas. They wanted the game to be \\"a more focused experience\\" than San Andreas, and Dan Houser felt that the limited activities of New York allowed this. The team felt that the addition of Niko's mobile phone added to the immersion of the world and represented society's shifted focus on phones. The in-game brands and products are designed over several years; the billboards were implemented in the game around six months prior to release. = Story and character development = Michael Hollick provided the voice and motion capture for Niko Bellic. The game's script, written by Dan Houser and Rupert Humphries, is about 1,000 pages. Approximately 660 actors provided voices for the game over 80,000 lines of dialogue. After conceiving the character and setting, Dan Houser spoke with his brother Sam Houser and Benzies to bounce story ideas before writing a rough synopsis, a six-paged, detailed document. Once the synopsis was reworked, the designers broke it into missions, represented by a large flow document demonstrating each section. The writers then work on the introductions to the missions; the gameplay dialogue comes much later. Unlike previous Grand Theft Auto games, Grand Theft Auto IV does not have cinematic influences. \\"We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't to try and do a loving tribute or reference other stuff,\\" said Dan Houser. He said that the writers wanted something \\"fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [a] movie\\". Dan Houser felt that the quality of the writing had to improve alongside the advancements in graphics and technology. He noted that the improvements in facial animation allowed for slower-paced cutscenes. The unique dialogue that plays when a mission is retried was to ensure that that the gameplay felt \\"less canned and less like Groundhog Day\\". Dan Houser described Niko Bellic as \\"a more rounded character\\" than those in previous games. He felt that his dual personality‚Äîoften saving innocent people, while also being a \\"cold-hearted killer\\"‚Äîmade him more relatable. He also felt that Niko's unfamiliarity with Liberty City allowed for the player to relate to him more, only driven by his vague past and relationship with Roman. When deciding on Niko's background, the writers felt that being an immigrant could lead to more dangerous situations, and therefore more enjoyable missions; after discussions with criminal experts, Dan Houser found that \\"the real scary characters are not born in America anymore\\". He felt that Niko's outsider view of American culture was \\"fun\\". The team wanted Niko to be \\"more of an anti hero than a hero, capable of making positive actions within his criminal world\\". They wanted his demeanour to reflect the weight of his past and choices. Niko's design underwent a few changes, but was finalised early in development. His outfit underwent several changes based on Eastern Europeans, particularly photographs of men fighting in winter wars in Yugoslavia and Chechnya. The primary motivation for the design was a face to convey the appropriate emotions and a body that could move nicely with the new animations. The in-game purchasable outfits were also designed to fit with the character. The team ensured that the gameplay choices presented to the player were not too extensive, as they still had to make sense to the character, who is driven by the people around him. Dan Houser felt that the missions in San Andreas had become too linear, and wanted to present choices to the player in Grand Theft Auto IV. The writers found that Niko needed a motivation to come to America, so they created his cousin, Roman. Dan Houser felt that the two could not be brothers as there would be a deeper level of familiarity than necessary. He described the two as a double act, with Roman's fantasist charm playing off Niko's tough cynicism. The team gave other non-playable characters (NPCs) more definable behaviours and dialogue to make them feel more alive. The writers initially considered having a smaller group of characters, but found that the story became boring and that players were less likely to explore the world. The stranger characters found in the game world were based on the \\"crazy people\\" that populate New York, according to Dan Houser, which in previous games were only able to be captured through radio stations or mild pedestrian behaviours. The team based the ethnicities, clothing, and behaviours of the NPCs on the photographs and videos that they captured around New York, divided into different areas; they created mood boards for each location. The NPCs also converse in different languages. = Art design = Grand Theft Auto IV sees a shift in the series to a more realistic and detailed style and tone, partly a result of the transition to consoles which offered high-definition graphics and the new and improved capabilities of such consoles. The development team worked to represent the upgrade in quality across all design aspects while maintaining the coherence of the previous games. The team took the game's development as an opportunity to \\"strip things back and start again\\", refining the art style without losing the style of the series; they distanced the game from the \\"cartoon-like style\\" of its predecessors while creating a new style that was consistent across all aspects of the game. Garbut found the increased demand of detail brought on by the advanced technology daunting. A technique used to make the visuals look real was to avoid harsh edges, instead blending surfaces together to make the world look dirty and lived-in. The props department created multiple variations of different objects to make the world more interesting and unique. Grand Theft Auto IV was the first contemporary game in the series since 2001's Grand Theft Auto III; the team felt that enough time had passed to avoid feeling repetitive. The types of in-game vehicles were decided upon early in development, after which the vehicles department begin creating the designs. The vehicles are not based on specific real-life counterparts, but take elements from several, with some original ideas by the developers. = Technical and gameplay design = The process that Grand Theft Auto IVs animation underwent: (top) actors performing on stage, raw motion capture data, (bottom) in-game characters, and the final scene in the game. The proprietary Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) was used for the game. Garbut found Grand Theft Auto IVs technical design similar to Grand Theft Auto IIIs, with both games being the first in the series to be released on their respective platforms. He claimed that an operable game engine was not finalised until late in development, at which point \\"there's still plenty of guesswork\\" until optimisation near release. The character's physical performances were recorded using motion capture. Up to eight actors could perform on the motion capture stage at one time, each dressed in a full suit. The camera used to capture the performance included a teleprompter for the actors to read their scripts. Over a hundred moves would be captured in each day of production. The final product was taken from different performances by different actors to make them appear seamless and appropriate. The voice work by one actor could be composited over a different actor's physical performance for a specific outcome. The in-game animations were crafted similarly, using a combination of different motion capture performances. For the gameplay and animations, the team redid a lot of the work from previous games, wanting Grand Theft Auto IV to \\"feel next-generation\\". The role-playing elements from San Andreas were removed fairly early in development, partly due to the animation work it would have required, and because consistently needing to visit the gym felt antithetical to Niko's motivations. The game's targeting system was one of the first focuses of development due to the advanced technology; the team wanted it to feel realistic without being too technical. The cover system was a \\"natural addition\\" to the targeting. Benzies described the multiplayer as the hardest part of the game's development. The team wanted the multiplayer to feel like an extension of the cinematic single-player experience. Dan Houser described it as \\"a section of a film rather than the whole narrative\\". The developers considered adding co-operative multiplayer to the main story campaign, but decided it worked better as a single-player experience. When Sam Houser first showed interest in using the Euphoria software in the game, he was told that it would be impossible or only limited to cutscenes, but some members of the team were able to make it work. Engineers from NaturalMotion worked on-site at Rockstar North for several months at a time to incorporate Euphoria software into the game. Rockstar also worked with Image Metrics for the game's facial animations. The facial rigs had around 100 joints, with a total of 300 minutes of facial animation. The scale of the project caused some issues for the animators, forcing them to have rigs completed before animation began. They also faced difficulty in the direction of the actor's head‚Äîeither straight on when looking at the teleprompter, or down when looking at a script. Image Metrics head of production David Barton noted that \\"having realistic eyes is 90 percent of the battle\\", as it allows the player to believe the character. A head camera was used when recording to capture facial movements. SpeedTree was used for in- game environment rendering. = Music production = When selecting music for the in-game radio stations, music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich said \\"[we had] to pick the songs that make New York today what it is, but make sure they won't feel dated by the time the game comes out.\\" The developers contacted over 2,000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights; they hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late Skatt Bros. member Sean Delaney to license the band's song, \\"Walk the Night\\". Billboard reported that Rockstar paid as much as $5,000 per composition and another $5,000 per master recording per track. Developers originally considered letting players purchase music in an in-game record shop and for Niko to have an MP3 player, but both ideas were cut. DJ Green Lantern produced tracks exclusively for the game's hip-hop radio station The Beat 102.7. Record label owner and record producer Bobby Konders, who hosts the in-game radio station Massive B Soundsystem 96.9, flew to Jamaica to get dancehall artists to re-record tracks to make references to the boroughs of Liberty City. The Housers's father, jazz musician Walter Houser, provided several classical music tracks for the game.  Release  Midnight launch of Grand Theft Auto IV at GameStop in Las Vegas. At E3 2006, Peter Moore, Corporate Vice President of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business division, formally announced the game by rolling up his sleeve to reveal a Grand Theft Auto IV temporary tattoo. Rockstar Games initially appeared to be committed to the original 16 October 2007 release date. However, Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter suggested that Take-Two may choose to delay the release of the game in order to boost its financial results for 2008 and to avoid competing with the release of other highly anticipated titles, such as Halo 3; Rockstar responded by saying that Grand Theft Auto IV was still on track for release in \\"late October\\". However, Take- Two announced in August 2007 that Grand Theft Auto IV would miss its original release date, and would be delayed to their second fiscal quarter (February‚ÄìApril) of 2008, attributing this to technical challenges. In particular, the delay was caused by technical difficulties with the PlayStation 3 version and storage problems with the Xbox 360 version. IGN predicted that other publishers would benefit from Grand Theft Auto IVs delay, particularly Activision with Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. On 24 January 2008, the company announced the game's release date of 29 April 2008. In August 2008, Rockstar announced that the game would be coming to Microsoft Windows on 18 November 2008 in North America and 21 November in Europe, with additional development work by Rockstar Toronto. Microsoft partnered with Rockstar in a deal to bring two episodic downloadable content packs to the Xbox 360: Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned on 17 February 2009, and Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony on 29 October 2009. Dan Houser wanted the episodes to show \\"a different side of Liberty City\\". In January 2010, Rockstar announced that the DLC would be bundled as Episodes from Liberty City, released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3 on 13 April 2010 in North America and 16 April in Europe. Episodes from Liberty City was also bundled with the main game in The Complete Edition, released on 26 October 2010 in North America and 29 October in Europe. The Xbox 360 version of the game and its DLC were made backwards compatible with the Xbox One on 9 February 2017. = Promotion = Industry analysts found Grand Theft Auto IVs marketing much more subtle than Microsoft's marketing of Halo 3 (2007), identifying Rockstar's interest in controlling the output at all times. The game was marketed through video trailers and press demonstrations. On 29 April 2007, the debut trailer was released. It was narrated by protagonist Niko, and depicts the open world accompanied by the song \\"Pruit-Igoe\\" by Philip Glass, originally composed for Godfrey Reggio's 1982 documentary film Koyaanisqatsi. The second trailer was released on 28 June 2007, showcasing the game's physics engine and featuring the song \\"Arm in Arm (Shy Child Remix)\\" by The Boggs. Dan Houser noted that the game was \\"still rough\\" when the first trailer was released, but that cutscenes were \\"coming on board\\" by the second trailer's release. To unveil the game's cover art, Rockstar contracted artists to paint a mural on a wall at a secluded warehouse location, showcasing the art in a video on 28 November 2007. A third trailer was released on 6 December 2007, introducing some of the game's characters, such as Roman and Michelle. The trailer features the song \\"King Ring\\" by Russian rap artist Seryoga, which Rockstar felt captured the \\"melting pot mentality\\" of Liberty City. Dan Houser wanted the third trailer to capture the \\"visceral qualities\\" of the game, but focus less on the story, as the first two trailers had done. On 8 February 2008, five teaser trailers for the game were released, each showcasing a particular character or service within the game. Similar teaser trailers were later released in pairs on 21 February, 7 March, and 11 April. Another trailer, released on 27 March 2008, showcases some scenes from the game, such as a bank robbery and police chase. A television commercial from GameStop debuted on 1 April, focusing on the activities in Liberty City. Viral marketing strategies were used to promote the game. Wanted posters were placed around New York City promoting the game's characters and website; billboard versions were also posted throughout the city. Murals and posters advertising the game were placed on buildings and public transport. The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) removed advertisements promoting the game from their property in April 2008; Take-Two filed a lawsuit in response, claiming that the CTA had violated a contract. Visitors to the website of WKTT Talk Radio‚Äîa fictional radio station within the game‚Äîwere offered a chance to leave a voice mail message stating their problems. Prior to leaving the message, callers were asked to read the terms and conditions, which revealed that some of the voice mail message would be selected for use in the game. In the month prior to launch, Rockstar and GameStop held a competition offering up to and a trip to New York City for the game's launch event. Microsoft held a similar sweepstakes competition, offering consoles, games, Microsoft Points, a baseball bat, and an invitation to the launch event as rewards. The official Grand Theft Auto IV website was redesigned on 8 February 2008 to show a preview of activities and locales within the game's world. To encourage pre- order sales, Rockstar collaborated with several retail outlets to provide a special edition version of the game. It includes a metal safe deposit box, an art book, and the soundtrack CD. The publisher also collaborated with Sony to release a 40 GB PlayStation 3 console with a copy of the game. GameStop hosted midnight launch events at over 3,500 of its American stores, with contests and giveaways.  Reception = Critical response = Following its announcement in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated and released to critical acclaim. Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating in the 0‚Äì100 range, calculated an average score of 98, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". It is the second-highest rated game on the site, only behind The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and tied with several other games. Reviewers heavily praised the game's narrative, open world design and combat system. Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt that the game \\"sets a new benchmark for open- world games\\", and Andrew Reiner of Game Informer wrote that the game \\"completely changes the landscape of gaming\\". Reviewers lauded the open world design, some further complimenting the freedom that it allows the player. Seth Schiesel of The New York Times named the city the \\"real star\\" of the game. Official Xbox Magazines Hicks was impressed by the city, attributing this to the game's AI. Robinson of Computer and Video Games considered the environment believable, and felt that the world was \\"utterly unmatched\\". Goldstein of IGN felt that, although Liberty City is inspired by New York, it is not beholden to it. He wrote that the city \\"exists in its own universe and rightfully so\\". Crispin Boyer of 1UP.com directed praise at the city's \\"breathtaking vistas, incredibly varied scenery, and lived-in look.\\" Conversely, Jesse Costantino of GameRevolution felt that the game lacked important features common in other open world games. Reviewers praised the game's narrative. IGNs Goldstein accepted that the darker tones to the story, a break from series tradition. Jon Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine felt surprised by the amount of depth to the story. Reiner of Game Informer wrote that the level of freedom in the game contributed to his enjoyment of the story. The morality choices faced by players throughout the narrative were also welcomed. 1UP.coms Boyer felt that they gave the game an element of \\"replayability\\". Eurogamers Tom Bramwell considered the morality choices a fair substitute over \\"bosses with large health bars\\". alt=The player character sitting next to the main antagonist, at a bench on the side of the road. The game's characters‚Äîparticularly Niko‚Äîreceived positive reactions from critics. Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine and Andy Robinson of Computer and Video Games both called Niko \\"charismatic\\" and \\"likeable\\", stating that they prefer him over previous protagonists of the series. George Walter of GamesRadar praised the depth of the character, and IGNs Goldstein felt that the character of Niko feels relatable when faced with difficult decisions. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb felt that Niko was \\"the only thing that mattered to [him]\\" as he progressed through the story, with the character becoming one of his favourite features of the game. Schiesel of The New York Times named Niko one of the most realised video game characters attributing this to the game's script, while 1UP.coms Boyer commended the use of character bonding during the game's missions. Many reviewers found the combat system was more responsive than in previous games, particularly praising the addition of the cover system. Justin Calvert of GameSpot wrote that the cover system makes the game's combat a \\"huge improvement\\" over previous games. Reiner of Game Informer agreed, writing that the targeting system makes players feel responsible for all deaths. IGNs Goldstein praised the fluidity of the cover system, and felt that the auto aim mechanic is a \\"great help in larger battles\\". GamesRadars Walter wrote that the cover system has \\"paved the way to a new style of mission\\". David McComb of Empire called the combat \\"sharp and instinctive\\", and Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine felt that the cover system allows players to execute an attack plan. In addition to the combat system, most reviewers noted the vehicle handling was more realistic than in previous games. Robinson of Computer and Video Games felt that the vehicle handling echoed realism, while Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine called the vehicle selection \\"excellent\\". Costantino of GameRevolution praised the improvement of the game's mechanics, particularly the physics engine's advanced vehicle and character animations. Reviewers praised the sound design. Goldstein of IGN praised the actors' performances and the use of licensed music. GameSpots Calvert and GamesRadars Walter also commended the licensed music, the latter admiring the humour of the radio's talk stations. Michael Pinson of The Pro Audio Files praised the separate features of the game's sound design‚Äîincluding the city's ambiance, licensed music, character dialogue, and vehicle and weapon sound effects‚Äîapplauding the developer's use of uniting the features together. Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar also retroactively praised the game's soundtrack, commending its suitability to the game's setting. The game's online multiplayer mode received positive reactions from critics. Reiner of Game Informer praised the character customisation available in the multiplayer mode, and noted that it runs \\"just as smoothly\\" as the single-player game. 1UP.coms Boyer called the multiplayer modes \\"excellent\\", and IGNs Goldstein named it one of the best. Official Xbox Magazines Hicks dubbed the multiplayer as \\"hugely entertaining\\", while Walter of GamesRadar praised the \\"seamless\\" process of entering a multiplayer match. Giant Bombs Gerstmann and GameRevolutions Costantino felt divided about the multiplayer, the latter naming it a \\"fantastic idea\\", but feeling as though connectivity problems resulted in a \\"broken\\" experience.  Windows version  When Grand Theft Auto IV was released to Microsoft Windows in December 2008, it received generally positive reviews. Metacritic calculated an average score of 90 out of 100, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\", based on 40 reviews. Reviewers liked the enhanced visuals and the additional features, but criticised the port for its inferiority over the console versions. The in-game features added in the port were well received. The addition of the Video Editor was met with positive reactions; GameSpots Calvert called it \\"a great way to get creative\\", while Kieron Gillen of Eurogamer criticised the unpredictability in its timing. Critics also praised the addition of the customisable radio station, which allows players to listen to their own choice of music; Tom Chick of 1UP.com named it the best feature of the port, and Steven Hopper of GameZone called it a \\"great touch\\". The port's upgrade to 32 concurrent players in the online multiplayer mode, as opposed to the console version's 16 players, was also met with positive feedback; Eurogamers Gillen said that the \\"possibility for mayhem... increases\\", while Will Tuttle of GameSpy felt that the player increase \\"changes the action significantly\\". The port's enhanced visuals were commended by many reviewers. GameZone Hopper considered the visuals an improvement over the original versions. Andy Robinson of Computer and Video Games called the visuals \\"impressive\\", while Tom Orry of VideoGamer.com called them \\"superb\\". Conversely, the port's system requirements, considered difficult to run with advanced settings, received criticism. Eurogamers Gillen said that, though the Windows version is \\"the most attractive version\\", it's \\"annoyingly fiddly to get there\\". GameSpys Tuttle was able to overlook the demanding system requirements in exchange for the game's other features. = Awards = Grand Theft Auto IV earned awards from several critics and publications. It received Game of the Year awards from Digital Spy, the Entertainment Merchants Association, GameTrailers, Giant Bomb, IGN Australia, Kotaku, The Los Angeles Times, The New York Times, and Time. At the Spike Video Game Awards, the game won Game of the Year and Best Action Adventure Game, and Michael Hollick won Best Performance by a Human Male for his role as Niko. It was nominated for three awards at the 9th Game Developers Choice Awards, and seven at the 5th British Academy Games Awards, tying for the most nominations at the latter. At IGNs Best of 2008, it won eleven awards, including Best Voice Acting across all three platforms and overall, and Best Story for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.  Sales  Within twenty-four hours of its release, Grand Theft Auto IV sold over 3.6 million copies, equating to approximately $310 million in revenue. Within a week, it generated more than $500 million in worldwide revenue, equating to approximately 6 million copies sold for Take Two. The numbers surpassed analysts' expectations for the title. After one month of availability, the game had sold over 8.5 million copies. It broke three Guinness World Records on 13 May 2008: highest grossing video game in 24 hours, highest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours, and fastest-selling video game in 24 hours. On 11 March 2011, Take-Two announced that the game had sold over 20 million copies, with the Grand Theft Auto series surpassing a collective total of 100 million copies. As of July 2013, the game has sold over 25 million copies, making it one of the best-selling video games, and one of the best-selling games on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. All sales records broken by Grand Theft Auto IV were beaten by its successor, Grand Theft Auto V. In the United Kingdom, the game became the fastest-selling game of all time, selling over 631,000 copies in twenty-four hours. This broke the record set by Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas at 501,000 copies over the same period. During the first five days of availability, the game sold over 927,000 copies in the United Kingdom. In the United States, Grand Theft Auto IV sold 2.85 million units in its first five days. By the end of 2008, the game had sold over 5.18 million copies in the US. In its first four days of availability in Japan, it sold 133,000 copies on the PlayStation 3 and 34,000 on the Xbox 360, according to Media Create. In the first week of availability, the Windows version of Grand Theft Auto IV debuted at seventh place on the weekly charts; by the second week, it had left the top-ten. Based on unique user counts, the game was the most played Games for Windows ‚Äì Live game in 2009 and 2012, and the second-most played in 2011.  Controversies  Prior to and since the release of Grand Theft Auto IV, the game had been subject to a great deal of controversy. The game's depiction of violence received mass commentary from journalists and government officials, occasionally being referred to as a \\"murder simulator\\". The ability to drive under the influence of alcohol in the game also received criticism, resulting in a request for the ESRB to change the game's rating. Similarly, some gameplay features were censored for the Australian and New Zealand versions of the game, though these censors were subsequently removed. Several crimes that were committed following the game's release, such as murder and sexual violence, were attributed to the perpetrators' experience with the game, generating further controversy. Former attorney Jack Thompson, known for his campaigns against the series, heavily criticised Grand Theft Auto IV prior to its release, filing lawsuits against parent company Take-Two Interactive, and threatening to ban distribution of the game if some gameplay features were not removed. The game also generated further controversy and lawsuits from city officials and organisations.

It is a leather strap that attaches from the snaffle ring to the curb ring, onto which the rein is then attached to the loop made between the two rings. A bit converter is very helpful when riding the cross-country phase of eventing, so that a rider using a pelham does not have to keep track of two reins‚Äî especially helpful when riding drop fences, which require the rider to slip the reins and then gather them back up on landing. It is also commonly used by children, who may have not yet become skilled enough to handle two reins with ease. However, the bit converter diminishes the rider's ability to apply the curb and snaffle functions of the pelham independently and discriminately, and thus is usually considered unsuitable for other types of riding; it is illegal in hunt seat equitation, for example.

Gori≈°ka borders on Upper Carniola in the northeast and Inner Carniola in the east. In the south, it is confined by Slovenian Istria and the Trieste city limits. Together with the adjacent Italian provinces of Gorizia, Udine and Pordenone in the west, it may be considered part of the larger Friuli region. History Upon the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps from about 600, Slavic tribes in contact with the neighbouring principality of Carantania moved into the Karst Plateau into the eastern Bassa Friulana, then part of the Lombard Duchy of Friuli. After Charlemagne had defeated the Kingdom of the Lombards at the 774 Siege of Pavia, the territory was incorporated into the Carolingian frontier March of Friuli. Margrave Berengar had himself crowned King of Italy in 888, while the adjacent marches of Carinthia (former Carantania) and Carniola had become part of East Francia upon the 843 Treaty of Verdun. When in 951 the East Frankish king Otto I of Germany invaded Italy, he seized the Friulan lands as part of the larger March of Verona, ruled by the Bavarian, later Carinthian dukes. In 1077 King Henry IV of Germany enfeoffed the Patriarchs of Aquileia with Friuli; the town of Gorizia (G√∂rz) became the power base of their ministeriales from the comital Meinhardiner dynasty. They were able to acquire and consolidate an immediate home territory, the County of G√∂rz, which they retained even after the Friulan territory of Aquileia was conquered by the Republic of Venice in 1420 and incorporated into the Domini di Terraferma. When the House of Gorizia became extinct in 1500, their county fell to the House of Habsburg; with neighbouring Carinthia and Carniola it was administrated within Inner Austria. Gori≈°ka, Inner Carniola and Slovene Istria territories annexed by Italy according to the Treaty of Rapallo From 1754 onwards, the region belonged to the Princely County of Gorizia and Gradisca, a crown land of the Habsburg Monarchy. When in 1809 Napoleon created the short- lived French Illyrian Provinces, he drew the border with the re-established Kingdom of Italy in the west along the Soƒça/Isonzo River. After the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the entire crown land of Gorizia and Gradisca with Trieste and the March of Istria as well as Carinthia and Carniola formed the Austrian Kingdom of Illyria with its capital at Ljubljana (Laibach). Part of the Austrian Littoral from 1849, the Soƒça Valley was the site of the fierce Battles of the Isonzo on the Italian front of Austria-Hungary during World War I. According to the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the whole Littoral region passed to the Kingdom of Italy. Together with the adjacent Inner Carniolan and Istrian lands, it was incorporated into the Julian March administrative region. The border with the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was confirmed in the 1920 Treaty of Rapallo. During the Fascist regime the Slovene minority was submitted to a violent policy of Italianization, against the resistance of the TIGR movement. After World War II, the present borders were established: most of the Slovene-inhabited areas were ceded to the newly established Yugoslav republic of Slovenia, while the town of Gorizia itself with Gradisca and the territory downstream the Isonzo River to the Adriatic coast were left to Italy.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 2, 1997. In the episode, Marge and Homer leave Lisa to babysit Bart and Maggie. Annoyed that his younger sister is his babysitter, Bart does everything he can to annoy her. When Bart is injured, Lisa must find him medical attention without spoiling her reputation as a good babysitter. The episode was written by Dan Greaney and directed by Jim Reardon. The script was written to focus on the relationship between Bart and Lisa and the episode has further been used to discuss the difficulties in letting children babysit themselves. The episode received mostly positive reviews. Plot Inspired by The Baby-Sitters Club series of novels, Lisa decides to become a babysitter, but no one takes her seriously because of her age. When Maude is taken hostage in Lebanon, Ned must leave suddenly to get her released. In his haste, he agrees to let Lisa babysit Rod and Todd. Ned puts out the good word for Lisa, who experiences a business boom. Inspired by the success of Baltimore's revamped wharf, the Springfield Squidport reopens and throws a gala. Homer and Marge attend, leaving Lisa to babysit Bart and Maggie. Bart is upset that his younger sister is his babysitter; Lisa thinks his childish antics warrant it. Bart torments Lisa by having a giant submarine sandwich delivered, hiring Krusty for a bachelor party, claiming that Lisa saw a UFO, dialing for a \\"sisterectomy\\", and feeding Maggie coffee ice cream for dinner. Bart's pranks anger Lisa so much that she lunges at him, causing him to fall down the stairs, dislocating his shoulder and causing a large bump on his head. Bart realizes if Lisa fails to take him to a nearby hospital, her reputation as a babysitter will be ruined. To make his condition worse, Bart locks himself in his room and repeatedly hits his head on the door, eventually knocking himself unconscious. Lisa tries to call for an ambulance, but the operator refuses to assist her due to Bart's earlier prank calls. Lisa considers asking Dr. Hibbert for help, but realizes that would ruin her reputation as a babysitter. Instead she takes Bart to Dr. Nick Riviera's clinic in a wheelbarrow, bringing Maggie along in a pet carrier because the coffee ice cream has overstimulated her. Lisa is unable to see the doctor due to a long queue in the waiting room. Frantic, Lisa tries to wheel Bart and Maggie to the hospital. She loses control of the wheelbarrow and it rolls down a cliff into a muddy river -- in front of aghast onlookers at the Squidport. The crowd assumes Lisa is on drugs, has murdered Bart, and is about to drown the caged Maggie, and accuse her of bad babysitting. Later, Bart, whose injuries have been treated, apologizes to Lisa for causing the ordeal and ruining her babysitting business. She forgives him, but feels bad for being called the \\"World's Worst Babysitter\\". Much to her delight, she receives babysitting requests from Hibbert and Ned because they cannot find any other sitters. Production and themes The Squidport was inspired by waterfront renovations such as Harborplace in Baltimore. The episode was directed by Jim Reardon and written by Dan Greaney. Like numerous preceding episodes, \\"My Sister, My Sitter\\" deals with the relationship between Bart and Lisa. Greaney specializes in writing Bart and Lisa episodes from the perspective of a kid. Elaine E Sutherland, who is a member of the Law Society of Scotland's Family Law Sub-Committee and Professor of Child and Family Law at the Law School, Stirling University, used the episode to describe the potential problems of letting one of your kids babysit the rest. While one child may be mature enough to babysit, it is not certain that the other kids accept the babysitter's authority. According to Alan S. Brown and Chris Logan, the writers of the book The Psychology of the Simpsons: D‚Äôoh!, the episode is an example of how feminine anger rarely solves the problem on The Simpsons. ‚ÄúHere, Lisa‚Äôs rage and ongoing frustration contribute to her difficulty in making good decisions about what to do with her emotion,‚Äù they write. Keeping with the babysitter theme, there are cultural references to The Baby-Sitters Club: Lisa reads book #14 - The Formula Formula, while Janey is on book #20 - The President's Baby Is Missing. The idea of revamping the waterfront came from cities like Baltimore, who were always trying to fix formerly horrible places. Chris Turner, the author of the book Planet Simpson, writes about the scene at the Squidport: \\"The \\"satirical\\" setting seems almost documentary\\". The Squidport is a local revitalization project, which recast a historic industrial area as a pedestrian mall. He calls this an example of how ‚Äúhyper-consumer culture of Springfield moves front and center‚Äù On the waterfront, Rainier Wolfcastle opens a restaurant called \\"Planet Hype\\". This is a parody of the international theme restaurant franchise Planet Hollywood. Wolfcastle is a parody of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who launched Planet Hollywood along with Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg in 1991. According to Matt Groening, the show had written an entire episode around Planet Hollywood, which featured the voices of Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Willis as The Three Stooges type of characters. The episode was never animated, because it turned out that it was only the publicist of Planet Hollywood's idea and the actors did not want to participate. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"My Sister, My Sitter\\" finished 47th in ratings in a tie with Melrose Place for the week of February 24 ‚Äì March 2, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 9.0, equivalent to approximately 8.7 million viewing households. It was the fifth highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"a clever episode, if a little disjointed ‚Äî the two stories don't gel as well as normal.\\" Tim Raynor of DVDTown.com said that the episode \\"is full of the usual, fun antics that you would expect from Bart or any of the other dumb Simpsons.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that \\"the segments in which Lisa babysits the various kids in town are a delight\\" and that the episode \\"mixes wacky moments with reality as it places Lisa in a logical position. Her conflict with Bart creates realism and also brings out the comedy.\\" References ;Bibliography * External links *\\"My Sister, My Sitter\\" at The Simpsons.com  Category:The Simpsons (season 8) episodes Category:1997 American television episodes ","title":"My Sister, My Sitter"},{"id":"2300775","text":"Atlanta College of Art Sign at the Woodruff Arts Center Atlanta College of Art Printmaking Studio Spring of 2006.

On the eve of the revolt led by Muhammad Ali Madali, the Sufi ishan, the poet Toktogul was harshly criticizing local Kyrgyz lords in Ketmen-Tobe valley. Madali ishan, seeking to rid the area of the Russians and restore the formerly independent khanate of Khokand, called for \\"holy war\\", and led 2,000 men against the Tsarist Russia on 17‚Äì18 May 1898 (on 30‚Äì31 May 1898 in the Gregorian calendar).

Among them was a prominent poet-improviser and composer Toktogul Satylganov (1864‚Äì1933), who was jailed by a false accusation by his political foes in the Ketmen-Tobe valley about his alleged participation in the revolt. He returned from Siberia jail (in the village of Kuitun near the town of Irkutsk) in 1905 only. His fame reached a high point in the Soviet era when his works were promoted by the state as a musician of the people and he was known throughout Kyrgyzstan simply as \\"Toktogul\\".Toktogul at Kyrgyz Music This distinction was founded largely on his works in the pre-revolutionary era which were interpreted as reflecting the class struggle. Modern interpretations, however, suggest that they had more to do with clan rivalries. Despite this, he welcomed the revolution, writing \\"What woman gave a birth to such a person like Lenin?\\" in celebration.

Firefighter Assist and Search Team personnel shall have no other operational assignment during any incident. Multiple alarm fires may require multiple FAST/RIC teams. Through the late 1960s and early 1970s the London Fire Brigade introduced RIT procedures using EATL (emergency air transfer lines) and EASE (emergency air supply equipment). This consisted of designated firefighter search and rescue teams (termed \\"emergency crews\\") stationed at self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) control entry points, equipped with emergency SCBA specifically designed to be worn by unconscious, injured or trapped firefighters. The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) and the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) have requirements for some type of FAST/RIT at structure fires. These standards require that a minimum of two fire fighters be standing by in full personal protective equipment (PPE) while other crew members are working in a hazardous atmosphere. The standards are the result of a series of incidents where fire fighters became lost, trapped or disoriented while fighting a structure fire without a FAST present. The FAST concept is not universal, with many fire protection agencies training all personnel in rescue duties. Rescue teams are then designated based on apparatus order in the dispatch to a call in which standard operating procedures (SOPs) require that rescue teams be held at entry points. This is the basic concept of the two-in, two-out rule. Note: While all of these versions of the name for a firefighter rescue crew either have been used or continue to be used in several areas, the National Incident Management System (NIMS) has determined that rapid intervention crew (RIC) will be the standard term. Currently, U.S. federally required training programs, from DHS and FEMA, are in the process of standardizing many terms and procedures under NIMS. FAST equipment FAST members are normally equipped with some or all of the following: *Full turnout gear *Self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) *Personal alert safety system (PASS device) *Portable radio that uses the fireground frequency and is available to the incident commander *Hand tools *Hand light *Search rope or webbing *Rapid air transport (RAT) bag which slips over an SCBA bottle and holds an extra mask to tap into the bottle to provide a downed firefighter with air. This so-called RIT Bag was invented by Darrin Shaw, a firefighter with Central Pierce Fire and Rescue. The term RIT Bag is now widely used, but the trademark stays with RIT BAG from Puyallup, Washington.

It is owned by Real Times. The newspaper is named after the original Pittsburgh Courier (1907-65), which in the 1930s and 1940s was one of the largest and most influential African- American newspapers in the country, with a nationwide circulation of more than 350,000. After circulation declines in the 1950s and 1960s, the original Courier was purchased in 1965 by John H. Sengstacke, publisher of The Chicago Daily Defender, in 1966. He reorganized the paper under a new name ‚Äî the New Pittsburgh Courier ‚Äî to avoid paying several outstanding tax bills and invoices. He later commented: He re-opened it in 1967 under the new name. The New Pittsburgh Courier joined Sengstacke's three other newspapers in a chain of prominent African-American publications, including the Defender. In 1974 Sengstacke appointed Hazel B. Garland as the new editor-in-chief of the New Pittsburgh Courier, making her the first African-American woman in history to be editor of a national newspaper. When asked about his decision, Sengstacke replied: \\"I have supreme confidence in Hazel, and believe that she will continue to do a great job as editor-in-chief as she did as city editor.

In Somalia, the Dhulbahante primarily settle in the three northern regions of Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer, but they also have a significant presences in Jubaland, particularly in the city of Kismayo. In Ethiopia, they settle in the Dollo Zone specifically in the woredas of Boh, Danot and Werder. The clan is known for its armed resistance against the British Empire and the historic role it assumed in support of the Dervish Movement which waged a bloody war against colonial powers from 1899 to 1920. Due to this legacy, the name Darawiish has almost become synonymous with this clan's name. Overview Grassland located in the Nugaal Valley. The extended formal name of the Dhulbahante clan is Said Saleh Abdi Mohamed Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti. The primary homeland of the clan straddles the Haud region and the Nugaal Valley, hence segments of the clan who settle in either plateau are colloquially referred to as the Reer Hawd and Reer Nugaaled. Currently, the clan has 13 active Garaads (clan chiefs). The most senior Garaad of these traditional leaders is Garad Jama Garad Ali who succeeded his uncle Garad Abdiqani Garad Jama. The use of the traditional hereditary title of Garad (which is most widespread among the Dhulbahante), was first inaugurated by the great ancestor Garad Shirshore who previously served as a Ugaas. Politically, all of the clan chiefs are anti- Somaliland except Garad Jama Garad Ismail who is tolerant of the presences of the Somaliland forces in Dhulbahante territory. The clan boasts a heroic history of anti-colonial resistance. In a bloody war against the British Empire the Dhulbahante propelled the Dervish movement to defeat the empire in a series of military expeditions. To honor the Dervish freedom fighters, the name Daraawiish is now given to almost all regional paramilitaries in Somalia. This rebellion which caused the death of one-third of the population of the Somaliland protectorate, effected the Dhulbahante population most severely. During Mohamed Siad Barre's regime, the clan was part of an alliance of Darod clans that was presumed to dominate state authority in Somalia. The acronym MOD was used to refer to the alliance which was composed of the Marehan, Ogaden and Dhulbahante. The vast majority of Dhulbahante today are pro Somali unity and against Somaliland's secessionist endeavour. In 1998, they established the State of Puntland with other Harti clans due to the common kinship. It is based on the ethnic composition and clan ties to Puntland, that voters in Sanaag and especially Sool were decidedly less supportive of Somaliland‚Äôs 2001 referendum on the constitution and independence. Although the Dhulbahante community was split over the 2007 conflict, with some aligning with Somaliland and its troops in the area of Las Anod, in the Bo'ame Declaration of 2007 all Dhulbahante clan chiefs rejected Somaliland's secessionist agenda and demanded the withdrawal of its militia from the clans traditional territory. In aftermath of the occupation of Las Anod in 2007, the clan became disillusioned with Puntland, consequently a new unionist movement which aimed to remove Somaliland from Dhulbahante territories emerged. The movement called the Unity and Salvation Authority of the SSC Regions of Somalia ()) was spearheaded by Saleban Essa Ahmed and founded in 2009. The most important traditional leaders who lent their support to the SSC Movement were Garad Jama Garad Ali, Garad Jama Garad Ismail, and Garad Ali Burale Hassan. In the Kalshale Conflict, Somaliland forces and SSC militia clashed in the Ayn region in 2011, whilst more clashes were reported to have occurred in 2012. In 2012, the SSC movement was replaced by Khatumo State after the Khaatumo II conference held at Taleh. Under the leadership of Ali Khalif Galaydh, Khaatumo state commenced peace talks with Somaliland and subsequently the two entities reached an agreement at the town of Aynabo in October 2017. Distribution In Somalia, the Dhulbahante almost exclusively inhabit the Sool region. Michael Walls on the Dhulbahante and Sool says: > \\"The residents of Sool overwhelmingly hail from a single clan grouping in > the form of the Dhulbahante [...]. Sool boasts a degree of kinship > homogeneity that is rare even in the Somali Horn\\". The clan inhabits Taleh, most of Hudun and most of Las Anod districts. In a survey conducted in 2011 of Las Anod District 92.5% of the respondents identified as Dhulbahante whilst 2.5%, 1.5% and 1.3% identified as Hawiye, Bantu and Isaaq respectively. In the Sanaag region the clan is only present in the Erigavo district along with the Habr Yonis clan, whilst well represented in the regional capital of Erigavo. Similarly in Togdheer, the clan solely lives in the district of Buuhoodle. The district of Buuhoodle was made a region by the state of Puntland and its name was changed to Cayn in 2004. Hence, the popular abbreviation SSC which denotes the traditional Dhulbahante territories within Somalia. In Jubaland there is a long settled Dhulbahante trading community in the port city of Kismayo and its surrounding district. In Ethiopia, the Dhulbahante clan settle in the Somali Regional State. They are present in the Dollo Zone, specifically in the woredas of Boh, Danot and Werder. In Kenya, there is a small but notable Dhulbahante community in the North Eastern Province. The Dhulbahante exclusively settle in the northern Somali cities of Las Anod and Buuhoodle. Moreover, they are well represented in the cities of Erigavo and Garowe. History=19th century= 19th- century explorer C.J Cruttenden on the Dhulbahante and their horse breed: > \\"The Dulbahanta are a nation who fight chiefly on horseback, their arms > being two spears and a shield. Their horses are powerful and courageous; the > breed descended, according to Somali tradition, from the stud of Suleiman, > the son Of David, and consequently is highly valued. The Dulbahanta, as far > as I have seen of them, are a fine martial race of men, second to > none...either in conduct or appearance\\". =Dervish Period= Taleh, the Dervish capital. Dervish forces mostly hailed from the Dhulbahante, similarly the majority of the movements followers belonged to this clan and to a lesser extent the Ogaden clan. The Dhulbahante in Buuhodle were particularly the first and most persistent supporters of the Dervish Movement. The Dervish Movement resisted colonial occupation, especially the British who were aided by certain Somali clans (including segments of the Dhulbahante). The Achilles heel of the British empire in the Somaliland Protectorate was the un-administered east, inhabited by the Dhubahante, Warsangali and a few sections of the Isaaq. In this light Douglas Jardine explains that British priority was to keep the former two clans neutral, as the British administration and its allied clans would not be able to resist them without outside aid. Despite this, the Chief of the Dhulbahante clan, Garad Ali Garad Mohamoud, did not want to be under British occupation nor under Dervish authority, instead he wanted to retain his autonomy as clan chief. The Garad and Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan had a heated altercation which concluded with Garad Ali supposedly saying: > \\"I am the Ruler of Nugaal and its people, their management is mine and i > expect everybody to respect it\\". Subsequently, Hassan ordered the successful assassination of the Garad. As Douglas Jardine reports, Hassan took this action after the Garad reassured the British that their relations remained unchanged, although owing to the influence of Hassan his clan no longer obeyed his orders. Issa-Salwe says news of the assassination stunned the Somali clans, consequently Hassan was only left with his maternal clan, the Ali Geri of the Dhulbahante. According to John William Carnegie Kirk, all Dhulbahante clans sided with Sayyid Mohamed Abdullah Hassan, expect the three small sub-clans of Rer Hagar, Rer Wais Adan and Ba Idris who were considered friendly by the British. In his poem Hanfi iyo Hungri, Hassan acknowledged the Dhulbahante as the true Dervish warriors: > Hawa beena Soomaalidaa, hadafka raacdaa leh. Hadal ruma Daraawiishta iyo, > weli hanoonaa leh. Raggii diinta hooyga u noqdiyo, hanad shirshooraa leh. In 1904 Hassan attacked the Jama Siad clanThe London Gazette, September 2, 1904. and in 1908 the Dhulbahante raided the Dervish and looted their camels. Hassan sent a letter to the British Commissioner Cordeaux, requesting his camels be returned and Blood money be paid. Excerpt from Hassan's letter to Cordeaux : > Your people, the Dolbahanta tribe, have killed fifteen of our men and looted > eighty-four camels. I do not know if Abdulla Shahari reported this to you: > if he did the fault lies with you; if not, I do hereby acquaint you of it. > You are requested to restore to us our camels and the blood shed by your > people The Mad mullah of Somaliland, p.162 Somaliland Camel Corps In 1912 the Dervish army compelled friendly segments of the Dhulbahante clan to retire to the British controlled territory to gain protection, Horace Byatt reported that 800 dhulbahante arrived in Berbera, stating that only 300 native infantry and 200 King's African Rifles were in Berbera and insufficient to hold off a Dervish attack. In 1913 at the battle of Dul Madoba the Dervishes defeated the British. The Dervish forces under the leadership of Dhulbahante military commander Ismail Mire were attacked by the British expeditionary forces under the command of Richard Corfield. It is reported that the Dervishes previously looted herds from the Jama Siad, who subsequently agreed to assist the British in their attack. Thus, 300 Jama Siad warriors along with the Somaliland Camel Corps commanded by Corfield pursued and attacked the Dervishes at Dul Madoba. The British sustained heavy casualties and Corfeild was killed in battle, whilst the 300 Jama Siad warriors fled unscathed. Aerial bombardment of Dervish forts in Taleh After the 1920 Bombing campaign of the Taleh fort and the Dervish retreat into Ethiopia, Tribal Chief Haji Mohammad Bullaleh (Haji the Hyena), commanded a 3000 strong army that consisted of Habar Yunis, Habar Jeclo and Dolbahanta horsemen and pursued the fleeing Dervishes. They attacked Muhammad Abdallah Hassan and the Dervish army in the Ogaden region and defeated them, causing Hassan to retreat to the town of Imi. Haji and his army looted 60,000 livestock and 700 rifles from the dervishes. The Dervishes who fought colonial powers for 20 years in order to attain freedom for the Somali peninsula never recovered. =Dulbahante traditional clan chiefs declaration= An historic summit was convened in Boocame from November 15 ‚Äì November 23 of 2007, by the traditional leaders of the Dulbahante (Dhulbahante) sub-clan of the clan. The Dulbahante traditional chiefs issued an official communiqu√© on October 15, 2007 regarding the secessionist Somaliland region's militias‚Äô aggression and occupation of Laascaanood (LasAnod), the regional capital of Sool, Sanaag and Cayn regions of Somaliland. All 14 major traditional chiefs of the Dulbahante clan attended this summit. In addition to the traditional chiefs, there were many intellectuals (women & men), students and civic organizations from outside and inside of the country attending the summit. All chiefs unanimously signed declaration communiqu√© on November 22, 2007. The communiqu√© states that the Dulbahante clan is not part of (and was never part of) and does not recognize the administration that calls itself \\"Somaliland\\" and that there are no agreements between Dulbahante clan and \\"Somaliland\\", in the past or the present. The communiqu√© also calls for an immediate end of hostility, return of customary peaceful co-existences among clans and an unconditional removal of the Somaliland militia from their territory. Finally, chiefs declared that the Dulbahante clan stands for the Somali unity. In the anniversary of their historic summit in Boocame in November 2007, the Dulbahante Traditional Chiefs (SSC Traditional Leaders Council) reiterated their previous declaration (above) that they are not part of the Somaliland separatist movement. The council sent its pronouncement to the European Union, United Nations Agencies and all NGOs that operate within Somalia. Clan tree There is no clear agreement on the clan and sub-clan structures and many lineages are omitted. Within the Dhulbahante clan, according to the anthropologist I.M. Lewis, the Dhulbahante are divided into 50 groups which pay diyya (or blood money for their members). These are gathered into four lineages of unequal size: the Muuse Si'iid, who made up the majority of the clan circa 1960, and in turn is highly segmented into numerous lineages; the Ahmed Si'id also known as Hayaag, which Lewis estimated to number 1,000 male members at the time, and the Mohamed Si'iid, and the Yuunis Si'iid, which he described as \\"small, insignificant, and incapable of independent political action.\\"Lewis, \\"Force and Fission in Northern Somali Lineage Structure\\", American Anthropologist, New Series, 63 (1961), p. 100 The following summarized clan tree presented below is taken from John Hunt's A general survey of the Somaliland Protectorate (1944-1950): *Abdirahman bin Isma'il al-Jabarti (Darod) ** Mohamed Abdirahman (Kabalalah) *** Abdi Mohamed (Kombe) ****Salah Abdi (Harti) *****Said Abdi (Dhulbahante) ******Ahmed Said (Turyar) ******Yonis Said ******Mohamed Said ******Hussein Said (Hayaag) ******Muse Said *******Barre Muse *******Osman Muse (Ebirrar) *******Mohamed Muse *******Abokor Muse *******Abdale Muse ********Yahye Abdale ********Adan Abdale (Hinjile) ********Habarwa Abdale *********Khalid Habarwa *********Shirshore Habarwa **********Hamud 'Ugaas' Shirshore **********Hussein 'Ugaas' Shirshore **********Mahamoud 'Ugaas' Shirshore **********Hassan 'Ugaas' Shirshore ***********Ali Hassan ***********Farah Hassan ***********Samakab Hassan ***********Khair Hassan ***********Saleh Hassan ***********Samatar Hassan ***********Gedi Hassan ***********Harun Hassan ******Abdi 'Garad' Shirshore (Qayaad) *******Omar Abdi *******Khayr Abdi ********Ibrahim Khayr ********Ali Khayr ********Osman Khayr ********Wa'eys Khayr ******Mohamoud 'Garad' Shirshore *******Wa'eys Mohamoud (Omar Wa'eys) *******Siad Mohamoud ********Jama Siad *********Samakab Jama *********Ahmed Jama *********Mohamoud Jama *********Warfa Jama ********Mohamed Siad (Ugadhyahan) *********Adan Mohamed *********Mohamoud Mohamed *********Samakab Mohamed **********Abdulle Samakab ***********Wa‚Äôeys Abdulle ***********Abokor Abdulle ***********Ahmed Abdulle ************Shirwa Ahmed ************Osman Ahmed ************Nur Ahmed *************Seed Nur *************Samatar Nur *************Yusuf Nur *************Musa Nur *************Samakab Nur (Bihina Ali) *************Ismail Nur (Bihina Ali) *************Hersi Nur *************Mohamed Nur *************Ali Nur ************Naleya Ahmed *************Adan Naleya *************Abdulle Naleya *************Samaad Naleya *************Shirwa Naleya (Bah ina Farah) *************Liban Naleya (Bah ina Farah) *************Yusuf Naleya (Bah ina Farah) *************Elmi Naleya *************Jibril Naleya ************* Ali Naleya **************Farah Ali (Bah Rikhaaye) **************Mohamed Ali (Bah Rikhaaye) **************Samatar Ali (Bah Rikhaaye) **************Igal Ali (Bah ina Araale) **************Abdi Ali (Bah ina Araale) **************Fahiye Ali (Bah ina Araale) **************Ahmed Ali (Bah ina Araale) **************Hussein Ali (Bah Ina Samatar) **************Yaqub Ali (Bah Ina Samatar) **************Yusuf Ali (Bah Abdulle) **************Elmi Ali (Bah Abdulle) **************Omar Ali (Bah Idris) **************Mohamoud Ali (Bah Idris) **************Wa'eys Ali (Bah Idris) ******Farah 'Garaad' Shirshore *******Yasin 'Garad' Farah *******Abdulleh Garad Farah ********Ali 'Garad' Abdulle ********Mohamed 'Garad' Abdulle (Bah'ararsame) *********Mohamoud 'Garad' Mohamed (Jabane) **********Mohamed Mohamoud **********Warsame Mohamoud **********Liban Mohamoud **********Sharmarke Mohamoud ********Guleed 'Garaad' Abdulleh (Barkad) *********Ali Gulled *********Amir Gulled *********Mohamoud Gulled ********Ahmed 'Garaad' Abdulleh *********Samakab Ahmed (Odala) *********Egal Ahmed *********Warfa Ahmed *********Hassan Ahmed *********Naleye Ahmed (Egal Naleya) *********Ali'Geri Ahmed **********Ismail Ali‚ÄôGeri **********Hersi Ali‚ÄôGeri **********Shawe Ali‚ÄôGeri **********Burale Ali‚ÄôGeri **********Gulled Ali‚ÄôGeri **********Subaan Ali‚ÄôGeri *********Adan Ahmed **********Farah Adan **********Mahad Adan **********Wa'eys Adan **********Hagar Adan ***********Gedi Hagar (Bah Ogaden) ***********Addaad Hagar (Bah Ogaden) ***********Warsame Hagar (Bah Ogaden) ***********Elmi Hagar (Bah Ogaden) ***********Amir Hagar (Bah Ogaden) ***********Gulled Hagar (Bah Ogaden) ***********Ayaar Hagar (Bah Warsengali) ***********Fatah Hagar (Bah Warsengali) ***********Adan Hagar (Bah Warsengali) ***********Adan Hagar (Bah Warsengali) ***********Farah Hagar (Bah Warsengali) Notable Dhulbahante people =Rulers= *Ali Khalif Galaydh, Ex-Prime minister of Somalia and Khaatumo President. *Indhosheel, former Khatumo president *Ismail Mire, Darwiish supreme commander, poet *Mohamed Abdi Hashi, President of Puntland, October 2004 -

It was written by Timberlake and Scott Storch with producer Timbaland and was inspired by Timberlake's former relationship with singer Britney Spears. Jive Records released the song to contemporary hit and rhythmic radio in the United States on November 26, 2002, as the album's second single. Accompanied by an electric piano, beatbox, guitars, synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants, \\"Cry Me a River\\" is an R&B; song about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his last girlfriend, who had cheated on him. \\"Cry Me a River\\" received acclaim from music critics, who praised Timbaland's production while calling it a standout track on Justified. The song earned several lists of best of the year and the decade (2000s), while Rolling Stone included it on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time at 484. It won the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 ceremony. The song peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 and Pop Songs charts and charted in the top ten in other countries. It was certified double platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). Filmmaker Francis Lawrence directed the music video for \\"Cry Me a River\\" in Malibu, California. In the controversial video, Timberlake's character invades the home of his ex-lover and films himself having sexual activity with another woman. Spears alleged that the video was a publicity stunt, but Timberlake maintained that she did not inspire the production. The clip won the awards for Best Male Video and Best Pop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. Timberlake performed \\"Cry Me a River\\" on his four major concert tours: The Justified World Tour (2003‚Äì04), Justified and Stripped Tour (2003), FutureSex/LoveShow (2007), and The 20/20 Experience World Tour (2013‚Äì15). The song has been covered by various artists, including Kelly Clarkson and Taylor Swift. Writing and production Timberlake acknowledged in December 2011 that the inspiration behind \\"Cry Me a River\\" was his ended relationship with Britney Spears. Timberlake and Scott Storch wrote \\"Cry Me a River\\" with Timbaland, who produced the song. Storch found working with Timberlake easy because of the song's meaning. Reporters believed its lyrics were inspired by Timberlake's relationship with singer Britney Spears, which ended in 2002. Timberlake told MTV News, \\"I'm not going to specifically say if any song is about anybody. I will say writing a couple of songs on the record helped me deal with a couple of things. To me songs are songs. They can stem from things that completely happened to you personally or they can stem from ideas that you think could happen to you.\\" In December 2011, Timberlake admitted that he had written \\"Cry Me a River\\" after an argument with Spears: \\"I was on a phone call that was not the most enjoyable phone call. I walked into the studio and he [Timbaland] could tell I was visibly angry.\\" Timbaland recalled, \\"I was like, 'Man, don't worry about it' and he was like, 'I can't believe she did that to me' and he was like, 'You were my sun, you were my earth.'\\" \\"Cry Me a River\\" was recorded at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles by Senator Jimmy D, while Carlos \\"Storm\\" Martinez served as the assistant engineer. Jimmy Douglass and Timbaland mixed the song at Manhattan Center Studios in New York City. Timberlake arranged the vocals and was a backup singer alongside Timbaland, Marsha Ambrosius, Tye Tribbett and Greater Anointing. Storch compared Timberlake's vocals on \\"Cry Me a River\\" to R&B; and rock singer Daryl Hall. Larry Gold provided the string arrangement and conducting, while Storch and Bill Pettaway played the clavinet and guitar, respectively. Release and response \\"Cry Me a River\\" was released as the second single from Justified. Jive Records serviced the song to contemporary and rhythmic radio in the United States on November 25, 2002. On December 23, three remixes were released as a 12-inch single in Canada and France. On January 5, 2003, the song was sent to urban contemporary radio stations in the US. It was released as a CD single in Germany on January 23. The single contains the album version of the song and the remixes on its 12-inch single release. A CD single, which included Johnny Fiasco's remix of the song and two additional remixes of \\"Like I Love You\\", was released on February 3 and 6 in the United Kingdom and Canada, respectively. \\"Cry Me a River\\" was released as a CD single in the US on February 18. The single features the album version of the song, its instrumental and four remixes. Following its release, there was media speculation that Spears had written a song as a response to \\"Cry Me a River\\"; she denied the rumors, explaining, \\"You know, it's funny. I read that I wrote this song and I wrote these lyrics and that's not my style. I would never do that.\\" Annet Artani, who co-wrote Spears' 2003 song \\"Everytime\\", stated that the song was written as a response to \\"Cry Me a River\\". When asked during an interview with Diane Sawyer on PrimeTime in 2003, if \\"Everytime\\" was about Timberlake, Spears responded, \\"I'll let the song speak for itself.\\" Composition and lyrical interpretation \\"Cry Me a River\\" is an R&B; song with an instrumentation that features clavinet, guitars, beatboxing, synthesizers, Arabian-inspired riffs and Gregorian chants. The instruments are arranged into what critics described as a graceful and mysterious melody. Jane Stevenson of Jam! said the single combines gospel and opera. Tyler Martin of Stylus Magazine enjoyed the way that the song unconventionally mixed a range of experimental sounds. According to Martin, the wave synth affects the real strings to create an unusual dissonance. The song's chorus devolves into a choral reading in which Timberlake pleads over the group. \\"Cry Me a River\\" finishes with a Timbaland vocal sample. \\"Cry Me a River\\" is written in the key of G minor, in alla breve, with a tempo of 74 beats per minute. Timberlake's vocal range spans from the low note of C3 to the high note of B4. Billboard magazine critics called \\"Cry Me a River\\" a bittersweet song, in which the singer's \\"familiar tenor belting\\" is tempered with a soulful falsetto and a \\"convincingly aggressive rock-spiked baritone\\" rasp. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly labeled the song \\"a haunted, pained farewell\\". Lyrically, the song is about a brokenhearted man who moves on from his past. A Rolling Stone reviewer called the song a \\"breakup aria\\". According to Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian, \\"Cry Me a River\\" stands out for its \\"slow-building sense of drama\\", which highlights Timberlake at his \\"husky best\\". The song begins with the phrase \\"You were my sun, you were my earth\\", which according to Timbaland was Timberlake's inspiration to write the song. Tanya L. Edwards of MTV News observed that Timberlake was wronged and said this is demonstrated by the lyrics: \\"You don't have to say whatcha did / I already know, I found out from him / Now there's just no chance.\\" The chorus contains the lines: \\"Told me you loved me, why did you leave me all alone / Now you tell me you need me when you call me on the phone.\\" Slant Magazines Sal Cinquemani called Timberlake's 2007 single \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\" an ostensible sequel to \\"Cry Me a River\\" both lyrically and musically. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard stated that aside from the presence of Timbaland's \\"fantastically cluttered production\\", the difference between \\"Cry Me a River\\" and Timberlake's 2013 single \\"Mirrors\\" is clear: \\"10 years ago, Timberlake was broken, and now he is whole\\". Reception and accolades \\"Cry Me a River\\" received acclaim from music critics. Jane Stevenson of Jam! and Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it a standout track on Justified. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic selected the song as a highlight in his review of Justified. Peter Robinson of NME described it as a \\"twisted epic\\" and \\"an acidic, filthy little song teeming with spite and retribution, with Timbaland's pounding.\\" Rolling Stones Ben Ratliff viewed his production of \\"Cry Me a River\\" as exceptional. Denise Boyd of BBC Music felt that the song's lyrics play as large a role as Timbaland's production, unlike other songs on Justified. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly concluded that the song is \\"a genuine stunner\\" that should leave Timberlake's fellow 'N Syncers concerned that he truly may not need them any more. John Mitchell of MTV News called \\"Cry Me a River\\" and \\"What Goes Around... Comes Around\\" \\"kiss-off songs\\", with Timberlake's revenge on Spears present throughout the lyrics. Idolator staff opined it is the sound of an artist who is \\"relishing ripping up people's perceptions of him as a sweet-natured teen heartthrob.\\" VH1's Emily Exton wrote, \\"By stretching the boundaries of pop‚Äìand fusing it with notes of R&B;, lots of electric goodness, and haunting choral vocals‚ÄìTimberlake‚Äôs kiss-off song instantly becomes more poignant, a pointed reaction to the hurt he‚Äôs experienced by someone he once loved.\\" According to Complex, the song \\"made people completely forget about 'N Sync and start asking what Timberlake would do next.\\" The single won a Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance at the 2004 award ceremony. It was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards. For Pitchfork Media it was the 3rd best song of 2003. Rolling Stone ranked \\"Cry Me a River\\" at number 20 on their list of the 100 Best Songs of the 2000s; a columnist for the magazine wrote that the real inspiration behind the song was the formation of the Timberlake‚ÄìTimbaland team, \\"a match made in pop heaven\\". In 2012, the magazine placed it at number 484 on their list of \\"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\\". VH1 ranked \\"Cry Me a River\\" at number 59 on their list of the 100 Greatest Songs of the 2000s. The Daily Telegraph listed the song at number 40 on the \\"100 songs that defined the Noughties.\\" In 2015, Spotify re-ranked Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs in two different lists. \\"Cry Me a River\\" ranked at number 14 on \\"by all Spotify users\\" and 10 on \\"streams from millennial users\\". In 2018, Rolling Stone ranked the song 46 on their list \\"The 100 Greatest Songs of the Century ‚Äì So Far\\".

Music video=Development and synopsis= The music video for \\"Cry Me a River\\" was directed by Francis Lawrence, and filmed in Malibu, California, during the week of October 29, 2002. Lawrence created the video's concept and told MTV News, \\"[Justin and I] had a conversation on the phone and all he said was he wanted to have some dancing in it, but to do my thing. He told me what the song was about, but in a [general way] as well. He just said it was a kiss-off song and so I came up with this idea and he went for it\\". Lawrence added that he also included some details in the video, including a reference to Spears's tattoo, which Timberlake enjoyed. He explained that he and Timberlake did not mention names while creating the video, only discussing the song's general beats. Lawrence also revealed that executives of Jive Records were nervous about some aspects of the video, such as Timberlake's representation of a voyeur and the tone of some scenes he was portraying with a girl. \\"That's the thing I liked most about this project, was that he was coming into it with a super clean-cut image with 'N Sync and he's such a nice guy and so handsome and what I was into doing was making him be a bit scary. Lurking around the house in the rain, throwing a rock through her window, being a peeping Tom, getting revenge and doing stuff that's not really what a nice guy does.\\" The music video for \\"Cry Me a River\\" was released onto the iTunes Store on April 28, 2003. Timberlake stalking the blonde woman who portrays Spears inside her house The video begins with a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking out of her house hand-in-hand with an unidentified man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes 500 W220, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice in the back of the car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a bedroom, where she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her bedroom, where the video he made with his new lover plays on the television. =Reception= Peter Robinson of NME wrote that the video shows \\"what Justin looks like after he's had sex. Clue: he looks pretty good.\\" According to Virginia Heffernan of The New York Times, Timberlake channels the character Neo from The Matrix film series, \\"pacing anxiously around wet and metallic interiors\\". At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, the video for \\"Cry Me a River\\" won in the categories of Best Male Video and Best Pop Video. It had also been nominated for Video of the Year, Best Direction in a Video and Viewer's Choice. Following the release of the music video, Us Weekly ran a cover story titled Britney Vs. Justin: The War Is On. Timberlake denied that Spears inspired the video, saying, \\"The video is not about her. The video is about me.\\" However, Spears told Rolling Stone in October 2003 that she received a call from Timberlake saying there would be a look-alike of her in his music video. She states that he reassured her by saying, \\"Don't worry about it. It's not a big deal\\". Spears, who had not seen the video, says she allowed him to do so but became infuriated after watching it. She recalled that when she asked why he had made a video about her, he replied, \\"Well, I got a controversial video.\\" She stated that it was a great publicity stunt, commenting, \\"So he got what he wanted. I think it looks like such a desperate attempt, personally.\\" After the release of Spears' video for \\"Toxic\\" (2003), Jennifer Vineyard of MTV News said her video \\"[made] \\"Cry Me a River\\" look like child's play\\". In 2013, Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz opined the clip was \\"one of the more brilliant musical moments in pop music since the dawn of the century. The visual is JT's most controversial music video to date.\\" He added, \\"The \\"Cry Me a River\\" video served a dual purpose for Timberlake: to court controversy, and to make its star seem more grown-up.\\" In 2018, Billboard critics named it the 24th \\"greatest music video of the 21st century.\\"  Live performances  Timberlake performed \\"Cry Me a River\\" for the first time at the 13th annual Billboard Music Awards, held on December 9, 2002, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. He was accompanied by a string section and a 20-member choir. He also performed the song on the Justified World Tour (2003‚Äì04), his first worldwide tour. The song was eighth on the set list of Justified/Stripped Tour (2003), his joint North American tour with Christina Aguilera. Timberlake performed \\"Cry Me a River\\" on a promotional concert held at House of Blues in West Hollywood, California on June 17, 2003. He performed a rock-inspired version of the song on Saturday Night Live on October 11, 2003; and it was fourteenth on the set list of his second worldwide tour, FutureSex/LoveShow (2007). On October 23, 2010, while performing at the annual charity gig \\"Justin Timberlake and Friends\\" in Las Vegas, Timberlake began the show with a slow and \\"sultry\\" performance of \\"Cry Me a River\\" and segued into a cover of Bill Withers' 1971 single \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\". He later resumed \\"Cry Me a River\\" before segueing into a cover of Drake's 2010 song \\"Over\\". Jillian Mapes of Billboard described the performance as \\"completely lovely in an effortless sort of way.\\" Timberlake performed \\"Cry Me a River\\" at concert he held during the 2013 Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans. Timberlake performed \\"Cry Me a River\\" in a medley with other of his songs at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. After the performance he accepted a Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the ceremony. Timberlake included the single on the set list of his fifth worldwide concert tour, The 20/20 Experience World Tour (2013‚Äì15).  Covers  The song was first covered by Welsh alternative metal band Lostprophets, recorded in a BBC Radio One session. It appears as a b-side of the single Last Train Home, released in 2004. American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift performed a cover of \\"Cry Me a River\\" in Memphis, Tennessee, during the Speak Now World Tour (2011‚Äì12). Justin Bieber recorded a cover of the song together with Kanye West's 2007 single \\"Stronger\\", which he posted on his YouTube account. Canadian rock band The Cliks also covered the song for their 2007 album Snakehouse. British singer Leona Lewis covered \\"Cry Me a River\\" during her debut concert tour The Labyrinth (2010). The Sheffield Star described the version as a \\"beautifully, sitting quietly, almost a capella\\". American indie pop duo Jack and White covered the song on their 2012 extended play Undercover. Recording artist Kelly Clarkson covered the song on September 1, 2012, as a fan request during her 2012 Summer Tour with The Fray. In January 2013, American singer Selena Gomez performed an acoustic version of \\"Cry Me a River\\" at the UNICEF charity concert in New York City. In February 2015, Scottish synthpop band Chvrches performed a cover of \\"Cry Me a River\\" on BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. The New Jersey alternative metal band 40 Below Summer performed a cover of the song in their 2015 album Transmission Infrared. = In other media = In May 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden released a new ad campaign which takes aim at Donald Trump and his statements that he is \\"treated worse\\" than any other president, instead of focusing on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The campaign is soundtracked by \\"Cry Me a River\\". Influence \\"Cry Me a River\\" marked the first collaboration between Timberlake and Timbaland, and its critical and commercial success started \\"one of the most forward-thinking star-producer duos in pop music\\", as described by Varietys author Andrew Barker. Alternative rock band Coldplay revealed that the single was an inspiration for the drumbeat of their song \\"Lost!\\". Rock singer Marilyn Manson cited it as one of the main songs that influenced him. In order to use the song in the 2017 film Lady Bird set in 2003, director Greta Gerwig sent a letter to Timberlake, \\"Your album Justified was that year, and it owned that year.\\" Rosal√≠a samples the chorus from \\"Cry Me a River\\" for her song \\"Bagdad\\" on her album El mal querer (2018), featuring a Barcelona children's choir. Billboard deemed the track \\"a transcultural re-interpretation\\" of \\"Cry Me a River.\\" Halsey's song \\"Without Me\\" contains an interpolation of the pre-chorus of \\"Cry Me a River\\".

Notice it lacks a shank. A classic Dee Ring snaffle bit with single jointed mouthpiece A snaffle bit is the most common type of bit used while riding horses. It consists of a bit mouthpiece with a ring on either side and acts with direct pressure. A bridle utilizing only a snaffle bit is often called a \\"snaffle bridle\\", particularly in the English riding disciplines. A bridle that carries two bits, a curb bit and a snaffle, or \\"bradoon\\", is called a double bridle. A snaffle is not necessarily a bit with a jointed bit mouthpiece, as is often thought. A bit is a snaffle because it creates direct pressure without leverage on the mouth. It is a bit without a shank. Therefore, a single- or double-jointed mouthpiece, though the most common designs for snaffle bits, does not make a bit a snaffle. Even a mullen mouth (a solid, slightly curved bar) or a bar bit is a snaffle. Action left The snaffle bit works on several parts of the horse's mouth; the mouthpiece of the bit acts on the tongue and bars, the lips of the horse also feel pressure from both the mouthpiece and the rings. The rings also serve to act on the side of the mouth, and, depending on design, the sides of the jawbone.Edwards Complete Book of Bits and Biting pp. 52‚Äì54 A snaffle is sometimes mistakenly thought of as \\"any mild bit\\". While direct pressure without leverage is milder than pressure with leverage, nonetheless, certain types of snaffle bits can be extremely harsh when manufactured with wire, twisted metal or other \\"sharp\\" elements. A thin or rough-surfaced snaffle, used harshly, can damage a horse's mouth.Kapitzke Bit and Reins p. 79 Curb chains or straps have no effect on a true snaffle because there is no leverage to act upon. English riders do not add any type of curb strap or curb chain to a snaffle bit. While some riders in western disciplines do add a curb strap to the rings, it is merely a \\"hobble\\" for the rings, has no leverage effect and is there only as a safety feature to prevent the rings from being pulled through the mouth of the horse, should the animal gape open its mouth in an attempt to avoid the bit, an outcome prevented in an English bridle by the presence of a cavesson noseband. Difference from a curb This is a curb bit with a jointed mouthpiece, sometimes called a \\"cowboy snaffle\\". However, such bits are not snaffle bits because they have a shank and work with leverage The snaffle differs from the pelham bit, the curb bit, and the kimberwicke in that it is a non-leverage bit, and so does not amplify the pressure applied by the reins. With a snaffle, one ounce of pressure applied by the reins to a snaffle mouthpiece will apply one ounce of pressure on the mouth. With a curb, one ounce of pressure on the reins will apply more ‚Äì sometimes far more ‚Äì than one ounce of pressure on the horse's mouth. There are many riders (and a remarkable number of tack shops) who do not know the true definition of a snaffle: a bit that is non-leverage. This often results in a rider purchasing a jointed mouthpiece bit with shanks, because it is labeled a \\"snaffle,\\" and believing that it is soft and kind because of the connotation the snaffle name has with being mild. In truth, the rider actually bought a curb bit with a jointed mouthpiece, which actually is a fairly severe bit due to the combination of a nutcracker effect on the jaw and leverage from the shanks. A true snaffle does not have a shank like a pelham or curb bit. Although the kimberwicke appears to have a D-shaped bit ring like a snaffle, the bit mouthpiece is not centered on the ring, and thus applying the reins creates leverage; in the Uxeter kimberwicke, there are slots for the reins placed within the bit ring, which allows the reins to create additional leverage. Both are used with a curb chain, thus the ring acts like a bit shank and creates a slight amount of leverage, making it a type of curb bit. A true snaffle also will not be able to slide up and down the rings of the bit or cheekpieces of the bridle, as this would place it in the gag bit category. The mouthpiece Jointed mouthpiece on loose rings (either side) and eggbutt (middle) A French link mouthpiece on dee rings A Mullen mouth, made of synthetic material The mouthpiece is the more important part of a snaffle, as it controls the severity of the bit. Thinner mouthpieces are more severe, as are those that are rougher. * Jointed mouthpiece: applies pressure to the tongue, lips, and bars with a \\"nutcracker\\" action. This is the most common mouthpiece found on a snaffle.Edwards Complete Book of Bits and Biting p. 55 * Mullen mouth: made of hard rubber or a half-moon of metal, it places even pressure on the mouthpiece, lips, and bars. It is a very mild mouthpiece. * French mouth: a double-jointed mouthpiece with a bone-shaped link in the middle. It reduces the nutcracker action and encourages the horse to relax. Very mild. * Dr. Bristol: a double-jointed mouthpiece with a thin rectangular link in the middle that is set at an angle, creating a pressure point. It is a fairly severe bit. The French link is similar but much gentler because the link in the middle is flat against the tongue, lips, and bar and has no pressure points. Neither the Dr. Bristol nor the French Link nutcracker, but their severity is totally opposite. * Slow twist: a single-jointed mouthpiece with a slight twist in it. Stronger and more severe. * Corkscrew: Many small edges amplifies the pressure on the mouth. Severe. * Single- and double- twisted wire: two of the most severe mouthpieces, as they are not only thin, but they also have a \\"nutcracker\\" action from the single joint and the mouthpiece concentrates pressure due to its severe twisting.Edwards Complete Book of Bits and Biting p. 68 * Roller mouthpieces: tend to make horses relax their mouth and activate the tongue, encouraging salivation and acceptance of the bit. This may also focus tense or nervous horses to the bit. * Hollow mouth: usually single-jointed with a thick, hollow mouthpiece which spreads out the pressure and makes the bit less severe. May not fit comfortably in some horses' mouths if they are a little small. The snaffle rings A western-style snaffle bridle There are several types of rings that affect the action of the bit. * Loose ring: slides through the mouthpiece. Tends to make the horse relax his jaw and chew the bit. May pinch the corners of the horse's mouth if the holes in the mouthpiece are large, in which case a bit guard should be used.Edwards Complete Book of Bits and Biting p. 57 * Egg butt/barrel head: mouthpiece does not rotate, and is so more fixed in the horse's mouth, which some horses prefer. Will not pinch the lips.Edwards Complete Book of Bits and Biting p. 58Kapitzke Bit and Reins p. 95 * Dee-ring/ racing snaffle: ring in the shape of a \\"D\\" which does not allow the bit to rotate and so the bit is more fixed. The sides of the D provide a lateral guiding effect. * Full cheek: has long, extended arms above and below the mouthpiece on either side of the lips of the horse, with a ring attached to it. The cheeks have a lateral guiding effect, and also prevent the bit from sliding through the mouth. The full cheek is often used with bit keepers to prevent the cheeks from getting caught on anything, and to keep the bit in the right position inside the mouth. * Half-cheek: has only an upper or, more commonly, lower cheek, as opposed to both seen in a full cheek snaffle. Often used in racing, as there is less chance of the cheek being caught on the starting gate, or in driving as there is less chance of getting caught on harness straps. * Baucher (hanging cheek): has a ring on the side of the mouthpiece, with a smaller ring above to attach the cheekpiece of the bridle. Tends to concentrate pressure on the bars. It is very fixed in the mouth. * Fulmer: a full cheek bit with a loose ring attached, so that it not only has the lateral guiding effect, but can also move freely as with a loose ring. Fitting The most important thing to remember when fitting a bit is that no two horses are completely alike. What is preferred by one, may cause severe problems in another. It is therefore the rider's duty to find a bit that not only suits the horse (both mouthpiece and ring), but one that fits correctly. The three main criteria in fitting the snaffle are the height the bit is raised in the mouth (adjusted by the cheekpieces), the width of the bit (from where the mouthpiece hits one ring, to where it hits the other), and the thickness of the mouthpiece. =Height= Theories as to fitting the snaffle vary between horse owners, but the most common theory of fitting the snaffle is to adjust it so that it creates one or two wrinkles in the lips at the corner of the horse's mouth. The best way to determine how high a snaffle should be is to begin with the bit just touching the corners of the horse's mouth, forming one wrinkle. If the rider holds the cheekpieces of the bridle and moves them up, there should remain enough give in the bridle to raise the bit in the horses mouth, however, there should not be excessive slack in the cheekpieces when this is done. Full cheek jointed snaffle The horse should keep its mouth closed over a properly-fitted bit (slight chewing is acceptable and a sign of relaxation) and hold its head quietly. A bit may need to be adjusted either higher or lower until the horse shows no signs of discomfort. The height of the bit in the horse's mouth has little significant impact on its severity. Some riders mistakenly think that raising or lowering the bit increases its effect, but this is not correct. The bit is most effective when properly adjusted. Improper adjustment only causes discomfort, not increased control. Factors that affect the fit of the bit include both the length of the mouth overall, the length of the interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests on the bars (gums) of the horse's mouth, the thickness of the horse's tongue and the height of the mouth from tongue to palate. There is less room for error with a horse who has a short mouth, thick tongue and a low palate than with a horse who has a longer mouth, thinner tongue and a higher palate. One of the important criteria when fitting the snaffle is that it does not hit the horse's teeth. The greater concern is that the bit not be so high as to constantly rub on the molars, which can cause considerable discomfort to the horse. A bit adjusted too low usually will not come anywhere near the incisors, even on a short-mouthed horse, until the entire bridle is at risk of falling off. If the bit is adjusted too low (not touching the corner of the mouth), it is primarily a safety concern, though the action of the bit can also be altered and lead to discomfort. A horse can get its tongue over a too-low bit and thus evade its pressure, plus the action of the bit is altered and it will not act on the mouth as it was designed. Horses with a bit too low will often open their mouths to evade pressure and may chew on it excessively. In extreme cases, the bridle could even fall off if the rider pulls hard on the reins, hence raising the bit and loosening the cheekpieces, at the same time the horse rubs, tosses or shakes its head vigorously. Many horses will \\"carry\\" a too-low bit themselves, using their tongue to hold it in the proper place. Some trainers, especially in western riding disciplines, consider this desirable and adjust a bridle a bit low to encourage this behavior. Other trainers, especially in English riding disciplines, prefer to hang the bit a little higher so it is in the correct position without need for the horse to move it there. If the bit is too high (depending on the horse, at three or more wrinkles in the lips), it will irritate the lips, leading to callousing and a loss of sensitivity over time. However, the more immediate consequence is that the horse feels constant bit pressure and cannot get any release, even if the rider loosens the reins. This leads to the horse becoming tense in the jaw and resisting the bit. Most of all, if a too-high bit rubs on the molars, this discomfort will cause the horse to toss its head and otherwise express its displeasure at the situation, leading to a poor performance. If the horse tosses its head or attempts to evade contact with a bit, improper fit is usually the cause, but other factors should be considered. A rider needs to verify with a veterinarian that the horse does not have a dental problem. Then bit fit and the type of bit needs to be considered. But finally, the skills of the rider may be a factor. Even the gentlest bit properly adjusted may still cause discomfort to a horse in the hands of a poor rider. Comparison of a standard eggbutt snaffle to a thin, saddle seat style bradoon. Mouthpieces are the same width. =Width= The snaffle should generally be no more than inch wider than the horse's mouth. A horse's mouth can be measured by placing a wooden dowel or a piece of string into the mouth where the bit will go and marking it at the edges of the horse's lips. A bit that is too narrow can cause pinching (which may be very severe in a loose ring), and the pinching may lead to behavior problems when the horse experiences the discomfort. A pinching bit will also cause callousing on the lips. The lesser sin is a bit that is too wide, which does not pinch the lips, but does not allow for effective communication between horse and rider. The nutcracker effect of a jointed snaffle presents a fit issue as well; the joint of a too-wide mouthpiece will hit the roof of the horse's mouth when the reins are tightened. =Mouthpiece diameter= Competition rules require bits to have a minimum diameter, but have no upper limits on thickness. Many horsepeople believe that a fatter mouthpiece is always a milder mouthpiece, because thin mouthpieces localize the pressure on the bars of the mouth. However, the horse's mouth is filled almost completely by his tongue. Therefore, many horses (especially those with large, fleshy tongues) prefer an average diameter mouthpiece, which provides slightly more space in an already cramped mouth. Additionally, thicker mouthpieces do not give a great deal of extra bearing surface, and so generally do not help as much as many riders believe. To make a bit milder, it can be wrapped with rubber or made of a softer plastic material instead of metal. However, mouthpieces that are extremely thin, such as wire mouthpieces or those that are only ‚Äì\\" in thickness, are never mild. These can be damaging to a horse's mouth.

Its final report, titled \\"Toward A More Accurate Measure Of The Cost Of Living\\" and issued on December 4, 1996, concluded that the CPI overstated inflation by about 1.1 percentage points per year in 1996 and about 1.3 percentage points prior to 1996. The report was important because inflation, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is used to index the annual payment increases in Social Security and other retirement and compensation programs. This implied that the federal budget had increased by more than it should have, and that projections of future budget deficits were too large. The original report calculated that the overstatement of inflation would add $148 billion to the deficit and $691 billion to the national debt by 2006. The report highlighted four sources of possible bias: * Substitution bias occurs because a fixed market basket fails to reflect the fact that consumers substitute relatively less for more expensive goods when relative prices change. * Outlet substitution bias occurs when shifts to lower price outlets are not properly handled. * Quality change bias occurs when improvements in the quality of products, such as greater energy efficiency or less need for repair, are measured inaccurately or not at all. * New product bias occurs when new products are not introduced in the market basket, or included only with a long lag. The members of the Boskin Commission were: * Michael Boskin, Stanford University (Chair) * Ellen R. Dulberger * Robert J. Gordon * Zvi Griliches * Dale Jorgenson The Boskin Commission was the first extensive evaluation of inflation measurement since the Stigler Commission in 1961. Griliches was also on that commission.

As innovation cannot be measured using a biased factor, a commercial solution has had to be found. From this source, biased and unbiased indices are charted from 1952 to 2000, affirming Stigler and Boskin with an average upward bias in the period of ~ 0.9% per year.

These somber works, inspired by Spain and painted in Barcelona and Paris, are now some of his most popular works, although he had difficulty selling them at the time. This period's starting point is uncertain; it may have begun in Spain in the spring of 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the year.Cirlot, 1972, p.127. In choosing austere color and sometimes doleful subject matter‚Äîprostitutes, beggars and drunks‚ÄîPicasso was influenced by a journey through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carles Casagemas, who took his life at the L‚ÄôHippodrome Caf√© in Paris, France by shooting himself in the right temple on February 17, 1901. Although Picasso himself later recalled, \\"I started painting in blue when I learned of Casagemas's death\\",Wattenmaker and Distel, 1993, p. 192. art historian H√©l√®ne Seckel has written: \\"While we might be right to retain this psychologizing justification, we ought not lose sight of the chronology of events: Picasso was not there when Casagemas committed suicide in Paris ... When Picasso returned to Paris in May, he stayed in the studio of his departed friend, where he worked for several more weeks to prepare his exhibition for Vollard\\".Wattenmaker and Distel, 1993, p. 304. The works Picasso painted for his show at Ambroise Vollard's gallery that summer were generally characterized by a \\"dazzling palette and exuberant subject matter\\". Picasso's psychological state worsened as 1901 continued. In the latter part of 1901, Picasso sank into a severe depression and blue tones began to dominate his paintings. Picasso's painting La mort de Casagemas, completed early in the year following his friend's suicide, was done in hot, bright hues. The painting considered the first of his Blue Period, Casagemas in His Coffin, was completed later in 1901 when Picasso was sinking into a major depression. Picasso, normally an outgoing socializer, withdrew from his friends. Picasso's bout of depression was to last several years. Picasso's career had been promising before 1901 and early in that year he was making \\"a splash\\" in Paris. However, as he moved towards subject matter such as society's poor and outcast, and accented this with a cool, anguished mood with blue hues, the critics and the public turned away from his works. Members of the public were uninterested in displaying the Blue Period works in their homes. Picasso continued his output, but his financial situation suffered: From 1901 to 1903, he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas, culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting La Vie, painted in 1903 and now in the Cleveland Museum of Art.Wattenmaker and Distel, 1993, p. 304 The same mood pervades the well-known etching The Frugal Repast (1904) which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness is a recurrent theme in Picasso's works of this period, also represented in The Blindman's Meal (1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and in the portrait of Celestina (1903). Infrared imagery of Picasso's 1901 painting The Blue Room reveals another painting beneath the surface. Other frequent subjects include female nudes and mothers with children. Solitary figures dominate his Blue Period works. Themes of loneliness, poverty and despair pervade the works as well. Possibly his most well known work from this period is The Old Guitarist. Other major works include Portrait of Soler (1903) and Las dos hermanas (1904). Picasso's Blue Period was followed by his Rose Period. Picasso's bout with depression gradually ended, and as his psychological state improved, he moved towards more joyful, vibrant works, and emphasized the use of pinks (\\"rose\\" in French) and other warm hues to express the shift in mood and subject matter. The painting Portrait of Suzanne Bloch (1904), one of the final works from this period, was stolen from the S√£o Paulo Museum of Art (MASP) on December 20, 2007, but retrieved on January 8, 2008.

As a papal diplomat he served in the embassies in Cologne, Lausanne, and Vienna. As Legate of Pius VII in France, he implemented the Concordat of 1801, and negotiated with the Emperor Napoleon over the matter of appointments to the restored hierarchy in France. He crowned Napoleon as King of Italy in Milan in 1805. Early life Caprara was born at Bologna on 29 May 1733 to Count Francesco Raimondo Montecuccoli and Countess Maria Vittoria Caprara. He took his maternal surname since she was the last of her line of the Capraras.Rinieri, p. 355. He was the brother of Count Alberto Caprara, the general and diplomat in the service of Austria. He studied at the Collegio Nazareno in Rome, and earned a doctorate in utroque iure at the Sapienza University of Rome on 23 September 1755. With his doctorate in law, Caprara was appointed in 1755 referendary of the Tribunals of the Apostolic Signature; from 1758 to 1761 he served as vice- legate of the papal state of the Romandiola, with its capital at Ravenna. Caprara was ordained a priest on 22 December 1765. Appointed titular archbishop of Iconium on 1 December 1766, he was consecrated bishop in the Quirinal Palace on 8 December 1766 by Pope Clement XIII.Ritzler-Sefrin, p. 242. Nuncio Following his appointment as titular bishop, Caprara was named Apostolic Nuncio to Cologne on 18 December 1766. He served until 1775.The papal government maintained three permanent legations in German territory, Cologne, Lucerne and Vienna. Caprara held all three, in order of their importance. In Cologne, he made an effort to deal with the difficulties raised by Febronianism. In 1772 he visited the Netherlands and was sent by Pope Clement XIV as his personal agent to the United Kingdom, where he was presented to King George III by the Austrian ambassador. His mission was to explore the possibilities of Catholic Emancipation in the United Kingdom, particularly in Ireland. In one of his meetings with the King, he was requested to procure a certain medicine, which in due course Pope Clement forwarded to George III. When Caprara's mission became a matter of public knowledge, Pope Clement was denounced in various cities as a heretic, and anti-Catholic sentiment in England was aroused to the point that the British government severed its contacts with the Papacy. It was not until six years later that the matter of emancipation could be brought up again, Ethelred Taunton, \\"Clement XIV and England,\\" . Taunton prints a translation of the full text of Caprara's report to Clement XIV, drawn up on 12 July 1772, in which he notes inter alia the restiveness of the American colonies and the danger of their revolt. with the Papists Act 1778. Back in Cologne, when the Jesuits were suppressed in 1773, it fell to Caprara to attempt, over the considerable objections of the three ecclesiastical Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, to carry out the provisions of Pope Clement XIV's bull of suppression of 21 July 1773, Dominus ac Redemptor.Theiner, II, pp. 394-400. Due to health problems (the official reason, but actually at the request of the Empress Maria Theresa), on 6 September 1775 Caprara was appointed nuncio at Lucerne. In 1785 he was transferred to Vienna,Grand Duke Leopold of Tuscany knew of the transfer of Caprara to Vienna on 20 December 1784, and assured his brother Joseph II that he would be contented with the appointment. where he remained until 1793. The papal Secretary of State (prime minister), Cardinal Francesco Saverio de Zelada (1789-1796), was dissatisfied with his conduct in Vienna. Caprara, with his compliant and passive nature, did not oppose the religious reforms undertaken by Joseph II, who was attempting to make the Catholic Church in his empire the tool of the state, and independent of the papacy.Haussonville, I, pp. 143-148. Cf. In order to end his tenure of the nunciature in Vienna in an honorable way, on 18 June 1792 Caprara was promoted Cardinal Priest by Pope Pius VI, with the titular church of Sant'Onofrio in Rome.Ritzler-Sefrin, VI, p. 32, no. 62. In Rome he was appointed a member of the Congregations of Bishops and Regulars, Propaganda, Good Government (economic affairs of the Papal States), and the Consulta (the main council of state of the Papal states and appellate tribunal), in the Roman Curia. He was also Protector of the Order of Carmelites.Notizie per l'anno 1797 (Roma: Cracas 1797), p. 16. From 21 February 1794 to 1 June 1795 Caprara served as Chamberlain of the College of Cardinals. When Napoleon in 1796 conquered North Italy during the War of the First Coalition, Caprara, perhaps to protect his own estates in Bologna, took a stand in favor of the newly created Transpadane Republic even though the Napoleonic republic had in its agenda strong anticlerical measures. In this period he got the reputation of being a \\"Jacobin Cardinal\\".He was considered a Jacobin cardinal in the Conclave of 1799‚Äì1800, along with Cardinals Zelada, the two Dorias, Roverella, Vincenti, Dugnani, and Rinuccini; at least according to Cardinal Maury. Maury, I, p. 247 He supported the Treaty of Tolentino in 1797 which imposed terms of surrender on the Papal States.Pignatelli (1976), \\"Caprara Montecuccoli, Giovanni Battista\\" He fell into complete disgrace in the eyes of Pope Pius VI.Cardinal Jean Siffrein Maury wrote to King Louis XVIII on 20 August 1801, \\"Le nouveau l√©gat √©tait tomb√©, depuis sa promotion au cardinalat, dans la disgr√¢ce la plus compl√®te du feu pape.\\" Conclave of 1799‚Äì1800 Caprara participated to the Papal conclave in Venice from November 1799 to March 1800. He was one of the cardinals absolutely excluded from consideration as pope as far as the Austrian government was concerned.The Austrians also excluded Cardinals Antonelli, the two Dorias (Giuseppe and Antonio), Gerdil, and Maury. He himself was a supporter of Cardinal Carlo Bellisomi, and an opponent of Cardinal Alessandro Mattei, who had signed the Treaty of Tolentino with Napoleon. Caprara was particularly interested in that treaty, since it had surrendered the Three Legations of the Papal States, including Caprara's native Bologna, to the French. During the Conclave, in early January, he approached the Austrian representative, Cardinal Franti≈°ek Hrz√°n z Harras, with the observation that the choice of a person who was not recommended by the Austrian Court (as was Mattei), would make a better impression during negotiations for the return of the Legations. Hrzan replied that the Legations had been detached from the Papal States by a solemn treaty which had been signed by the Pope, and that they had been conquered by Austrian troops from the Cisalpine Republic. Conquest was a more solid claim.Duerm, p. 84. Three months after the conclusion of the Conclave, Napoleon won the Battle of Marengo (14 June 1800), and took from Austria by conquest not only the Three Legations but Lombardy as well. According to Cardinal Hrzan's report to the Austrian Emperor, when Cardinal Gregorio Barnaba Chiaramonti began to be talked about seriously on 11 March, his candidacy was resisted by Cardinals Borgia, Doria, Maury, Pignatelli, and Caprara, even up to the final vote. Hrzan speculated that the new pope would place little confidence in them.Duerm, p. 239. After the Conclave, Caprara requested that Hrzan use his influence with the Austrian government to see to it that his income from his benefice at S. Maria della Grazie in Bologna was paid.Duerm, pp. 84-85, 176. The Emperor Francis wanted the new Pope, Pius VII, to come to Vienna, though the Pope himself was eager to get to Rome, and intended to take the land route through Bologna, Caprara's home.Duerm, pp. 325-330. This was unacceptable to Austria, which was in possession of Bologna and wanted no unrest. Pius was therefore sent by sea to Ancona. The Austrians were agitated, moreover, by the fact that Caprara was intriguing to be made Archbishop of Bologna. Pius himself, however, assured the Austrian diplomat Filippo Ghislieri that he had never thought seriously about naming Caprara to the vacant See of Bologna.Duerm, p. 373, 376, 402-403, 412-413. Caprara had good relations with Pius VII, with whom he traveled back to Rome. During the voyage from Venice to Ancona, Caprara expected to be named Administrator of the diocese of Ancona, expecting to be then named Bishop.Duerm, p. 463, in a report from Ghislieri to Vienna. At the end of June 1800, however, Cardinal Bussi de Pretis, Bishop of Jesi, died, and it immediately became the gossip of the Papal Court en route that Caprara was being considered as his successor. The Pope appeared to be somewhat disposed to favor the prospect, which was certain enough by 24 July that Caprara went to Jesi to take possession of his diocese.Duerm, p. 573, 619. On 11 August 1800 Giovanni Battista Caprara was appointed Bishop of Jesi in the March of Ancona. Legate in France When the Concordat of 1801 between Pope Pius VII and the French First Republic was concluded, Napoleon Bonaparte, then First Consul, asked for the appointment of a papal legate with residence in Paris. Napoleon's choice fell upon Cardinal Caprara; he may have expected in this way little or no opposition to his plans.Rinieri, p. 356, quoting from the Memoirs of Cardinal Ercole Consalvi. Napoleon's second choice was Cardinal Giuseppe Doria, who had been Legate in Paris, and became Pius VI's Secretary of State in December 1798. Doria was completely ineffectual in the occupation of Rome by the French, and the deportation of Pius VI to Siena, then Florence, and finally France. The suggestion may have been inspired by Count Azara.Cardinal Maury wrote to Louis XVIII: \\"le chevalier Azara a insinu√© √† Bonaparte de demander au pape pour cette mission extraordinaire le cardinal Caprara, √©v√™que de Iesi, son ami, l'ami des Fran√ßais par la protection desquels il se flattait de devenir pape, l'ami du feu prince de Kaunitz, homme souple, faible, d√©pourvu de toute connaissance th√©ologique et canonique. Maury, II, p. 160. Caprara was appointed legate a latere for France in the Secret Consistory of 24 August 1801, and in the Public Consistory of 27 August.Rinieri, p. 359, with note 1. His powers as legate are detailed in Boulay de la Meurthe, Tome IV, pp. 19-27. He departed Rome on 5 September, with a tiny suite of ten persons, for his destination, and arrived in Paris on 4 October.Rinieri, p. 360. In Caprara's instructions there were two principal points. The first concerned the position of the Constitutional bishops, many of whom were supporters of the First Consul.In a letter to Bonaparte of 14 October 1802, Cardinal Caprara noted that he had received 61 resignations. 47 of them were according to the formula demanded by the Vatican, but more than two dozen were in self-exculpatory and conditional formulae, which were unsatisfactory. Rinieri, pp. 381-387. A list of the Constitutional Bishops and their resignations is given in Boulay de la Meurthe, V, pp. 639-642. Bonaparte wanted them to be reappointed to their dioceses, or at least to other dioceses. This presented grave spiritual and canonical problems for Pius VII, since the bishops were heretics and schismatics, and it would be impossible to appoint them to diocesan posts without a full confession of guilt, as well as retractation of their oaths to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy and submission to the judgment of the Pope. Caprara was to try to get Bonaparte to refrain from nominating (a right guaranteed in the new Concordat) any of the Constitutional bishops. Napoleon had no intention of complying with the Pope's demands. The second principal point had to do with the restoration of territories of the Papal States which had been seized by the French armies during the wars in Italy. These included the Three Legations, which Napoleon intended to form a major part of his Italian Republic.Haussonville, I, pp. 167-171. The principal negotiator for the French Consulate was Jean-√âtienne- Marie Portalis, Minister of Religious Affairs (cultes).Rinieri, p. 350. During the negotiations which followed concerning the execution of the Concordat of 1801, Caprara displayed a conciliatory spirit in dealing with the ten constitutional bishops who were to be appointed, at least according to Bonaparte's demand, to as many of the newly established dioceses; in fact, Caprara went contrary to specific instructions from Cardinal Consalvi in Rome, under persistent pressure exerted by Napoleon. On 15 March 1802 Bonaparte issued instructions to Portalis concerning the publication of the Concordat, and remarked that 50 bishops had to be named, 18 legitimate bishops living in France and twelve from the Constitutional clergy; of the 20 remaining, half would be Constitutionals. Five days later, realizing the number would be insufficient, he raised the number of 50 to 60 (fifty bishops and ten archbishops). He made his choices from the list supplied by Portalis. Caprara heard of the list of nominees on 30 March, and was horrified to see that it contained the names of 10 Constitutional bishops, despite the apparent agreement of Bonaparte not to name any Constitutional bishops. On 10 April Caprara insisted that these ten reject their errors, and he was supplied by Bonaparte's officials, Portalis and Bernier, with a letter signed by the ten bishops in which they renounced the Civil Constitution of the Clergy. Caprara took this as sufficient evidence of repentance, provided that they publicly confess their errors in the presence of Bernier and Pancemont. They informed Caprara that the conditions had been met, and on 17 April Caprara instituted the ten bishops. Next day Bernier and Pancemont denied the truth of the repentance, but it was Easter Day and the day of reconciliation, and the day on which two episcopal consecrations were to take place. Caprara had been deceived and managed, and the Vatican subsequently strongly criticized his actions.Rinieri, I, p. 443. L. G. Wickham Legg, \\"The Concordats,\\" in: The Concordat was officially approved by votes of the Tribunate and the Legislative Assembly on 8 April 1802. At the same time and in the same bodies, Napoleon had 121 articles, called the Organic Articles, approved as laws of the French State. These articles had not been approved by the Papacy, and had not even been shown in their entirety to the Legate Caprara, before their passage. They were regarded by the French as amplifying the Concordat, though a number of them in fact contradicted it. The Pope had been tricked and circumvented.Aston, pp. 328-330. L. G. Wickham Legg, \\"The Concordats,\\" in: Cardinal Caprara officiated at the Solemn restoration of public worship in the cathedral of Notre-Dame on Easter Day (18 April 1802), at which function the First Consul, the high officers of state, and the new ecclesiastical dignitaries assisted. The new Archbishop of Paris, the 92 year-old Jean- Baptiste de Belloy-Morangle, led the clergy. After the reading of the gospel of the day, twenty-seven bishops who were present knelt at the feet of Bonaparte and took a solemn oath of allegiance to the government and the French Republic.Rinieri, pp. 536-541. On 5 May Cardinal Consalvi, the Papal Secretary of State, wrote to Caprara, demanding explanations about the Constitutional bishops, and about the ceremonies of 18 April, pointing out that the Pope's position had been and was that the Constitutional bishops should have had no part in them. He also pointed out that all the newspapers, particularly those in German territory, were referring to the Organic Articles as though they were part of the Concordat.Haussonville, I, pp. 512-513; and cf. pp. 516-517 about the Pope's reaction. On 27 May 1803 Pius VII wrote Bonaparte a letter, begging him to modify the Organic Articles, Napoleon's own supplement to the Concordat, along lines suggested by the papal government. Napoleon's obstinacy was one of the principal reasons Pius decided to make his visit to Paris for the coronation of the emperor in 1804.Rinieri, pp. 467-468. In a letter written 18 August 1803, Caprara too protested against the Organic Articles added to the Concordat by the French Government, as \\"establishing in France an ecclesiastical code without the cooperation of the Holy See.... The Church has received from God alone the authorization to decide questions of the doctrine of the faith or of the regulation of morals, and to make canons or rules of discipline.\\" The Church, in fact, never accepted the Organic Articles, though it was powerless to prevent their enforcement.Rinieri, I, p. 467. Archbishop of Milan Pope Pius VII (foreground) with Cardinal Caprara (background). Painting by Jacques-Louis David In November 1801 the Archbishop of Milan Filippo Maria Visconti was invited by Tayllerand in Lyon to participate to the founding of the Italian Republic, the work of First Consul Bonaparte; but on 30 December 1801, Visconti died there in Lyon while attending a formal banquet. Napoleon arrived in Lyon on 11 January 1802 and designated Caprara as new Archbishop of Milan. Pope Pius VII concurred, so on 24 May 1802 Caprara was appointed Archbishop of Milan. Caprara however retained his position as papal Legate in France until his death, and continued to reside in Paris. He visited Milan only once, from 2 April 1805 to 26 July 1805, for the ceremonies of the Coronation of the Emperor Napoleon as King of Italy in the Cathedral of Milan, which took place on 26 May 1805. It was the Cardinal's privilege to bless the Iron Crown of Lombardy which Napoleon then placed on his own head. During the absence of Caprara from Milan, the diocese was ruled by the Vicar general, Carlo Bianchi, who had to deal with the anticlerical commands of the Kingdom of Italy, such as the oath to the state Secretary of Cult by the teachers of the seminaries, and the compulsory abolition of most confraternities. Last years In 1806, Cardinal Caprara caused considerable consternation and offense when he authorized the publication of the Catechism of the French Empire. Among other things, Lesson 7 of Part I of the document mentioned Napoleon I by name and urged the faithful to do their duty to him, \\"firstly, because God... plentifully bestowing gifts upon our Emperor, whether for peace or for war, has made him the minister of his power, and his image upon earth.... He has become the anointed of the Lord by the consecration he has received from the Sovereign Pontiff, head of the universal church.\\" Frank McLynn, Napoleon: A Biography (Great Britain: Jonathan Cape 1997; paper ed. New York: Arcade Pub. Co. 2001), pp. 352-353. Haussonville, II, pp. 255-295 Caprara lived in Paris until his death. Relations between Napoleon and the Papal States became more and more difficult, especially with the implementation of the continental blockade against England, which Pius VII refused to sanction or participate in. Caprara's desire to please Napoleon brought increasing dissatisfaction on the part of the Pope and the Secretary of State Cardinal Ercole Consalvi.Rinieri, pp. 387-358. The situation degenerated in 1808 when the Napoleonic army entered in the Papal States on 3 February 1808, and General Miollis occupied Rome. In April 1808, Cardinal Caprara was ordered by Pius VII to demand his passports, that is to say, to quit his position as Legate and leave France. Caprara resigned as legate, but contrary to the papal order he did not leave Paris. On 10 June 1809, in the Bull Quum memoranda, Pius VII excommunicated \\"all those who after the invasion of Rome and the ecclesiastical territory, and the sacrilegious violation of St. Peter's Patrimony by French troops, have committed either at Rome in the States of the Church, against ecclesiastical immunities, and against the simple temporal rights of the Church and Holy See, either all or any of the outrages which have provoked our complaints; all authors, promoters, counsellors, or adherents of similar doings; all those, finally, who have contributed to facilitate the realization of these violent acts or have accompliehed them.\\" The excommunication certainly included Napoleon I, Emperor of the French. On 5 July 1809 Pope Pius was arrested.Allies, pp. 160-164. Still in 1809, when Pope Pius VII was already captive in Savona, Caprara pleaded with the pope to support Napoleon.Pignatelli, Giuseppe (1976), Dizionario biografico degli Italiani. Allies, pp. 179-181, quoting a letter of Pius VII to Caprara. Declining health saved him from the embarrassment connected with the divorce and second marriage of Napoleon (April 1810). Caprara died at Paris on 21 June 1810. In his last will his fortune was left to the hospital of Milan. Caprara had a solemn funeral by order of the Emperor Napoleon, and his body was buried in the Panth√©on of Paris (where it remained until 1861), while his heart was buried in the Cathedral of Milan.

The character is commonly associated with the X-Men. Kevin was the mutant son of Scottish genetic researcher Moira MacTaggert and politician Joseph MacTaggert. Kevin had reality-warping and possession powers and lived most of his life in forced seclusion at his mother's Muir Island research facility. His attempt to break free and find his father made up a classic 1979‚Äì80 Uncanny X-Men storyline that was adapted in the 1990s X-Men animated series. In 2009, Proteus was ranked as IGN's 77th-greatest villain of all time.Proteus is number 77 IGN. Retrieved 10-05-09 Publication history Created by writer Chris Claremont and artist/co-writer John Byrne, Proteus first appeared in Uncanny X-Men #125 (September 1979), though hints to his character appeared in earlier issues. First, he appears off-panel in Uncanny X-Men #104. His voice is then revealed in Uncanny X-Men #119, as he took over the body of his first victim off-panel. Fictional character biography Proteus is written as one of the strongest and deadliest mutants ever to appear in Marvel Comics. Despite this, Proteus was not fortunate enough to have a happy life. Even his conception was under unpleasant circumstances. He was the son of Moira MacTaggert and her sinister husband, Joseph MacTaggert, who forced Moira into an unhappy marriage. Moira conceived Kevin after Joseph severely beat and raped her. After this traumatic experience, Moira left Joseph. She did not notify him that she was pregnant with his child. Moira and Kevin lived at her Mutant Research Centre on Muir Island, off the coast of Scotland. Kevin eventually began manifesting his mutant abilities and became a danger to everyone around him. His abilities gave him an uncontrollable hunger for energy. To protect herself and others, Moira was forced to confine Kevin. To keep the truth about her son secret, she began to describe him to others only as Mutant X.Uncanny X-Men #125‚Äì126. Marvel Comics For years, Kevin remained inside his cell, sustained by esoteric energy fields that kept his body from burning itself out, until one day, after a battle between Magneto and the X-Men, his cell was damaged and Kevin was able to escape when he took over the body of Angus MacWhirter.Uncanny X-Men #119. Marvel Comics Mutant X realized that this stolen body was less effective than his original skin at housing his energy form. Reasoning that a more powerful host might sustain him for longer, Kevin decided to possess another resident of Muir Island, the powerful mutant known as Phoenix. He stalked Jean Grey for several days in Angus MacWhirter's body, looking for the opportunity to grab her while she was alone. Significantly weakened by the time his opportunity came, Mutant X was unable to overcome the Phoenix, and was driven off by her psychic assault. Without the isosteric energy fields of his cell to sustain him, Kevin began to burn his body out. The only solution he could find was to possess human host bodies, one after another. He went after Polaris next, but ultimately ended up taking the body of her protector, one of Madrox's duplicates.Uncanny X-Men #125. Marvel Comics To avoid further conflict, Mutant X cut his losses and fled Muir Island aboard Angus MacWhirter's boat before the X-Men arrived in force to confront him. On the Scottish mainland, he transferred his essence into the body of Fergie Duncan, rejuvenating himself in the process and leaving the X-Men none the wiser about his current identity. He had just jumped bodies again from Fergie into a passing policeman when the X-Men Wolverine and Nightcrawler caught up with him. Wolverine deduced Mutant X's identity and a confrontation began between the mutants. As they squared off, Kevin rejected the Mutant X label and started calling himself Proteus after the changing Greek god of myth and the room Moira used to control him as a child. Proteus tried to possess Wolverine's body, but was forced out by the Adamantium in Logan's skeleton. Nonetheless, he quickly incapacitated Nightcrawler and Wolverine by distorting spatial and substantial reality around them.Uncanny X-Men #126. Marvel Comics Storm arrived and injured Proteus's host with her lightning, but Proteus grounded her and attempted to claim her form as his own. Moira managed to drive him off by firing sniper rounds at her son through a long-range scope, staying out of his field of vision and the range of his powers. Fearing the metal in Moira's bullets, Proteus fled and continued his trek towards Edinburgh and his father.Uncanny X-Men #127. Marvel Comics Proteus eventually went to Edinburgh, to possess his father, Joseph. After possessing his father, Proteus made a last stand against the X-Men. Joseph MacTaggert's body was destroyed in the battle. Before Proteus could take another host, Colossus (in his metallic form) punched Proteus in his energy form. Due to Proteus's intolerance for metal, he was unable to maintain his energy form. His energy was therefore dispersed across the world, and the X-Men and Moira assumed that he had been killed.Uncanny X-Men #128; Classic X-Men #32. Marvel Comics Some time after his death, Moira MacTaggert thought about cloning Kevin, but she was discouraged successfully by Sean Cassidy (Banshee).Classic X-Men #36. Marvel Comics Several years later, A.I.M. attempted to recreate Proteus. The organization used a woman named Harness and her mutant son, Piecemeal, to absorb all of the dispersed energy of Proteus. Piecemeal and Harness encountered the New Mutants, but escaped them.New Mutants Annual #7. Marvel Comics As the boy went about absorbing the energy, his body grew too large for his system to handle.New Warriors Annual #1. Marvel Comics Eventually, what was left of Proteus's consciousness and Piecemeal merged as one being after Piecemeal absorbed all the extant Proteus energy.Uncanny X-Men Annual #15. Marvel Comics The combined efforts of the New Warriors, the New Mutants, the Muir Islanders, and the original X-Factor was not enough against this new creature. When the amalgamated being decided that it would not find happiness, it decided to disperse once more, effectively committing \\"suicide\\".X-Factor Annual #6. Marvel Comics Some time later it is revealed that Moira had recorded Proteus's DNA matrix on a disc which was being searched by Siena Blaze under the Gamesmaster's orders, who in turn was working with a mysterious associate.Excalibur (1st series) #72. Marvel Comics Siena is able to locate the disc but before she can evade being caught she must fight Nightcrawler and Shadowcat. They are able to recover the disc and return it to Moira when Rachel Summers joins the battle. Siena teleports away, vowing revenge.Excalibur (1st series) #73. Marvel Comics The mysterious associate of Gamesmaster is revealed to be Mr. Sinister who is furious with Siena Blaze that she did not manage to steal the DNA of Moira's son; however, his anger is quelled after Siena reveals she had scratched Rachel Summers.Excalibur (1st series) #74. Marvel Comics =House of M and Exiles= When the Scarlet Witch altered history and created the House of M reality, she inadvertently released Mutant X on the world again. Just as before, Moira MacTaggert discovered her son Kevin possessed vast mutant powers that were eating away at his body, and tried to cure him of this affliction. In the House of M, however, any attempt to \\"cure\\" mutation was a capital offense, and Magneto's Sentinels destroyed Moira's lab on Muir Island, making her a wanted fugitive and setting Kevin loose to kill as he pleased. Mutant X soon became an infamous Scottish serial killer known for the desiccated corpses he left in his wake. He encounters the Exiles and actually manages to escape the House of M by stealing data from the Panoptichron. Notably, when he leaves his home reality he inhabits bodies of superhumans from \\"approximation\\" realities or Exiles members only. He has inhabited the bodies of an unnamed mutant, of Blunderbuss, and of Angel Salvadore in House of M; Mimic and Morph in Exiles; Justice from the New Universe; and the Hulk from the Marvel 2099 universe. None of these bodies lasts for long, with the exception of Angel Salvadore. Other reality manipulators, such as Longshot may be immune to Proteus's manipulations.Exiles #74. Marvel Comics Mutant X's current body, Morph from Exiles, also does not seem to deteriorate while Proteus inhabits it.Exiles #80. Marvel Comics Proteus states that he could not stop thinking about Blink.Exiles #76. Marvel Comics Whether it was because he still had some of Mimic's memories or because he actually felt something for her is not yet clear. He states he was tired of fighting and that he just wants to talk, but before he can say anything, Longshot shields Blink, allowing her to teleport to safety. It is revealed by Proteus himself that his mind is able to recall all memories and feelings of his previous hosts. Following the death of Mimic, when Proteus transferred into Morph, Blink tricks Proteus into wearing a portable Behavior Modification System (from the Squadron Supreme's world), which she teleported into the crown he was wearing. The device brainwashes him into believing he is actually Morph and leaves him able to recall only Morph's memories prior to his possession. Unaware of his true identity, he begins behaving exactly like Morph and a member of the Exiles, much to the discomfort of the other Exiles.Exiles #82. Marvel Comics With Proteus trapped and believing he is Morph, he remained an Exile to continue fixing damaged realities. Considering Morph's body does not burn out like other hosts, Morph's consciousness is still active beneath Proteus. Also, Proteus is immune to metal while in Morph's body, since wearing a metal tiara during the \\"Heroes Reborn\\" world did not kill him. However, concerns about some discrepancies in \\"Morph's\\" behavior forced his teammates to plan regular brainwashings with the same device, and, eventually, put him in stasis whenever his behavior again became abnormal. However, that device was destroyed when Psylocke and Sabretooth fought so intensely that they shook the Crystal Palace, causing a bookcase to fall on Morph's head, shattering the device.Exiles #91. Marvel Comics During a confrontation where Proteus reawakened, he found himself lacking in power to defeat the adversary. About to be crushed, Proteus shouted aloud his desire to stay alive. In a vision, he saw a figure, almost identical to his own true energy form, telling him to take its hand, and he would survive. Upon doing so, Proteus found himself full of even greater power, using it to defeat his god-like enemy. Afterwards, it was revealed that this being was the personality and soul of the true Morph, having been in limbo, gaining strength within Proteus and his own body, who had before only been able to speak a few sentences through Proteus's control. Revealing to Proteus that he had the ability to eject him from his body, Morph gave Proteus the chance to work together and share his body and their powers, in order to do more good, something which Morph had discovered Proteus desired deep inside. Proteus accepted, and the two now work in harmony, better than either could be alone.New Exiles Annual #1. Marvel Comics Some time later, though, Proteus and Morph were completely separated by forces beyond their control. The crystalline structure of the Panoptichron reacted to the Exiles' continued presence in its walls by absorbing them into the crystal itself. The Crystal Palace somehow differentiated between Proteus and Morph, absorbing the former into the crystal walls while leaving the latter unscathed.Exiles (2nd series) #6. Marvel Comics =Necrosha= Some of the Exiles that were trapped in the Crystal Palace have since resurfaced in other stories, indicating that those Exiles were eventually released from the crystal wall unharmed. Linearly speaking, Proteus was eventually restored as dispersed energy on Earth-616 and decided he was not happy being dead anymore, and arranged to bring himself back to life. To accomplish this, he planned to roughly recreate the process previously used by Harness and Piecemeal. When Selene began using the Technarch transmode virus to resurrect dead mutants, Proteus took advantage of her work by affixing a small portion of his energy signature, and therefore his consciousness, to the precognitive Destiny as she was resurrected. (This worked because Destiny died on Muir Island, a place with one of the largest concentrations of residual Proteus energy.) Although the quantum of Proteus energy involved was not enough to truly \\"possess\\" Destiny as he had done in the past, Proteus was able to influence Destiny's perceptions so that she saw a future of his design, and acted accordingly.X-Men Legacy (1st series) #231. Marvel Comics When Destiny tried telepathically contacting her foster-daughter Rogue, she instead found Blindfold and passed on her vision (and unwittingly a portion of Proteus energy). Now being influenced by Proteus as well, Blindfold confirmed Destiny's obscured vision that a threat was rising on Muir Island, and the X-Men needed to stop it. Trusting their premonitions, Cyclops dispatched Blindfold with a squad of X-Men for Muir. Once they arrived, Proteus was able to use Blindfold like a \\"psychic magnet\\", soaking up more and more Proteus energy from his familiar surroundings until she reached critical mass, and enough Proteus energy was consolidated in one place to truly resurrect Kevin MacTaggert, letting him fully possess Blindfold. Destiny had recognized her error after passing the energy on the Blindfold, but arrived too late to stop Proteus's ascension.X-Men Legacy (1st series) #232. Marvel Comics Once he was restored, Proteus turned on the X-Men, particularly his murderer Colossus who was among the team, and Magneto whose power over Proteus's weakness, metal, made him the most dangerous. Worse still, Proteus's experience reconstituting himself taught him how to split his energy among multiple bodies, possessing several X-Men simultaneously as he added Nightcrawler, Husk, Trance and Psylocke to his existing hosts Blindfold and Destiny. Rogue struck back at Proteus, stealing Psylocke's psi-knife to disrupt his control of his hosts one by one. As Rogue's stolen power wore off, Magneto magnetically launched himself and \\"Blindfold\\" into low orbit. Although Proteus managed to redirect them back to Earth, the distraction gave Magneto the time he needed to electromagnetically identify Proteus's energy wavelength, and disrupt it. With Proteus back in the same position he was in when he initiated his own resurrection hours earlier, Psylocke questioned how they knew he would not return one day. Magneto ominously replied that, in fact, they should know that he would return.X-Men Legacy (1st series) #233. Marvel Comics =Agent X= Some of Proteus's energy was found drifting in the Astral Plane by the Shadow King, who used it to become his new source of power, in an endless battle between him and Xavier, who had been forced to partake in this following his death at the hands of Cyclops. In the battle's final moments, Shadow King spread Proteus as a psychic infection on London. With the help of his X-Men, Xavier (now inhabiting Fantomex's body and calling himself X), defeated the Shadow King, and unaware of the psychic infection nature, he was eventually able to gather it in the shape of a green sun, reconstituting in the process Proteus.Astonishing X-Men (Vol. 4) #1‚Äì7. Marvel Comics Knowing that Proteus is vulnerable to metal, Old Man Logan wants to face him with Archangel, but X wants to reason with him first and asks for Psylocke's help to enter Proteus's mind together. Proteus feels his mind being forced into and allows X and Psylocke to enter his mental landscape. X and Betsy find themselves near a beautiful castle where they are welcomed by the young Kevin McTaggert. Kevin believes atonement and change are possible and strongly believes he was only ten years old at the time Colossus killed him back at Muir Island (although it was established that Kevin was actually 19 or 20 years old at the time). He came back a few times after that, but the X-Men were always there to kill him just because he dared to see the world after years off imprisonment. When the Shadow King grabbed ahold of his psyche, he spent ten thousand years on the Astral Plane reflecting on what he had done to all the poor people he had possessed back then. Kevin shows Betsy an image of her original body dressed in the pink uniform and asks her if she is still the same person she was when she started her journey. Kevin argues that the X-Men want to kill him again just because he did something bad in the past. Proteus says if they leave him alone, he will leave them alone as well. X does not want to risk, and attacks Kevin instead. In retaliation, Proteus merges the physical bodies of X and Psylocke and sends them back to London.Astonishing X-Men (Vol. 4) #8. Marvel Comics After the merger is undone and X and Psylocke are rescued by their teammates, X reveals that Proteus is planning to bring the Astral Plane into the real world to make it function like the psionic realm.Astonishing X-Men (Vol. 4) #9. Marvel Comics Kevin traveled to the Scottish village of Fetters Hill, in order to carry out his experiment and granted the citizens of the town the ability to make real whatever they wished. As the X-Men confronted Proteus again, the village had already fallen into chaos, and it became a gestalt of the villagers' mindscapes. During the fight Proteus made Fetters Hill erupt, launching seeds into many cities of the world with the objective to transform them as well. The X-Men were eventually able, after a fieriest battle, to disrupt Proteus's energies and dispersed his physical structure while the damage he caused to reality was reversed by Psylocke and X.Astonishing X-Men (Vol. 4) #11. Marvel Comics =House of X= Proteus is shown to be an inhabitant of Krakoa where he is inhabiting a Professor X husk. He is paired up with Elixir, Hope Summer, Goldballs, and Tempus as the Five where they use their talents to revive the dead mutants.House of X #5. Marvel Comics Piecemeal Piecemeal (Gilbert Benson) is a fictional mutant character in the Marvel Universe. His first appearance was in New Mutants Annual #7. Young Gilbert Benson was a mutant with the ability to absorb different energy frequencies and store them within his body. His mother, the armored mutant mercenary known as Harness who had been employed by Advanced Idea Mechanics, cruelly exploited this ability and forced Gilbert, whom she dubbed Piecemeal, to travel across the world with her to absorb the dispersed energy of Proteus, the deceased reality-warping son of geneticist Moira MacTaggert. Absorbing the energy, Piecemeal grew larger and larger until he looked like a 700-pound monstrosity. The mutant team X-Force, alongside the New Warriors and a makeshift group of Muir Island-based X-Men allies, did their best to help siphon off the energy, but they failed. Finally, Gilbert's body exploded, and in that instant his mind combined with that of the reformed Proteus to form a new amalgamated being. The new entity set about warping reality all over Scotland. The amalgamated Proteus/Piecemeal also captured their mothers and held them hostage as the pre-government- sponsored X-Factor team arrived. Finally, X-Factor convinced the boys to disperse their energies, consigning them both to oblivion. Powers and abilities Proteus is a mutant that possesses a vast psionic ability to manipulate and alter reality. He exists in a state of pure psionic energy and can take possession of human bodies; however, the bodies of most beings burn out within hours or a few days, although a few have been known to last longer. Proteus can leave a body before it is destroyed, but he usually does not. No possessed person has been shown able to resist or break free of Proteus's domination. Proteus has access to all the memories of his host while he possesses them and after he has left the body. Proteus has occasionally exhibited some telepathy, perfect recall, and the ability to mentally download computer information. Only living beings with metal in their bodies appear to be immune to the possession, since metal is apparently the only weakness of Proteus. In fact, contact with enough metal in this form can disrupt Proteus's energy and destroy his consciousness, dispersing it, which rendered Wolverine immune to his possession due to his metal skeleton and allowed Colossus to disrupt him in the X-Men's first confrontation with him. His reality manipulation powers allow him to transmute matter and bend the laws of physics according to his imagination within a certain range. Using this power he can easily turn a building into liquid, turn a vehicle into bees that attack at his mental command, transform energy into matter, manipulate weather, or strip a person of their mutant powers. He often reverses local gravity, opens fissures in the earth, and stretches people painfully into liquid shapes (they return to normal when he no longer concentrates on manipulating their bodies). Use of this ability tends to speed up the rate at which his body will burn out. Proteus's reality warping ability is contingent upon line of sight: if he shifts his sight to another object and warps it, the previous object he was warping will return to normal. Because Proteus is a being made of energy, he is virtually immortal since his consciousness can reform after such a disruption, but he has not shown the ability to do so without assistance. Proteus has at times exhibited the ability to transport himself inter- dimensionally, but it is not known whether he always could do this, or his resurrection by the Scarlet Witch enhanced his powers, or if he needed to use a connection to the Panoptichron in order to accomplish this. After his revival through Destiny during the events of Necrosha, Proteus is shown to be able, to his surprise, to possess multiple individuals simultaneously.X-Men Legacy #232. Marvel Comics Other versions=Star Trek/X-Men crossover= In the Star Trek/X-Men crossover, the spirit of Proteus crosses over to the universe of Star Trek because of a rift created by classic Star Trek antagonist Gary Mitchell (who also had reality warping powers). Proteus is able to reanimate and inhabit Mitchell's corpse, which does not deteriorate like other hosts. While chasing Deathbird, the X-Men end up teaming up with the crew of the USS Enterprise to stop Proteus, who forms an alliance with Deathbird to escape the planet.Star Trek/X-Men One-shot (1996). Marvel Comics At one point, Proteus compares Mitchell's fate (as seen in the Star Trek TV series episode \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\") to the kind of anti-mutant prejudice that the X-Men are fighting. =Ultimate Marvel= In the Ultimate Marvel universe, Proteus is named David Xavier and is the son of Moira MacTaggert and her ex-husband Professor X (Charles Xavier). Like in the mainstream version, he escapes his mother's keep on Muir Island, seeking his father in order to kill him. Proteus kills thousands of people all across the world in an attempt to discredit the X-Men, where he also murders Psylocke's partner Dai Thomas, agent of S.T.R.I.K.E.. Before David can finish his deadly vendetta, he is found to be inside Betsy, traveling to Germany where Betsy fought David for control. After Xavier refused to kill David, Colossus kills them both by crushing them inside a car.Ultimate X-Men #15‚Äì19 (2002). Marvel Comics In other media Proteus as seen in X-Men: The Animated Series Proteus appeared in the two-part animated X-Men series episode Proteus, voiced by Stuart Stone. Kevin MacTaggert had his reality warping and possession powers, but he also had the ability to change himself back into his human form as well, a power he did not have in the comics. Also, when he took over people's bodies, it did not kill them like it did in the comics, it only weakened them. Proteus himself was somewhat humanized and much less evil; he was a violent, unstable, 17-year-old adolescent with a childlike mentality and little grasp on reality (Moira kept him practically locked in her center for years), and at a certain moment he even saved a young man from being beaten up by a gang of bullies. Kevin/Proteus took off in search for his father; not knowing the truth and craving for his father's love, he blamed his mother Moira for not giving his father a chance. He then attacked Professor X, Rogue, Moira, Wolverine, and Beast, defeating them and making Wolverine experience death, which causes Logan a great deal of psychological damage. Moira tells Professor X that Proteus's father, Joseph, did not want him because he was a mutant. Professor X and the X-Men confront Joseph himself, but he refuses to listen and is only bothered about people finding out he is Kevin's father because he is a mutant. Rogue is set to protect Joseph, and she hears his speech about loving children, thus triggering her to remember her past of when her father rejected her due to her own status as a mutant. Kevin arrives at the hall and attacks Rogue and Beast as Joseph leaves. Professor X tries to reason with Proteus and he blames the Professor for keeping Joseph away from him. Wolverine arrives in time to save Professor X and Beast. Professor X tries to contact Proteus mentally and tells him he can help him, but Proteus insists on seeing his father. Moira says they've tried to reason with him enough and tells them she needs to do something about it now. Kevin arrives at another speech of Joseph's, saying that he wants Joseph to love him but Joseph says that he's a trick and trying to ruin him. Joseph tells him to leave and Kevin gets so mad that he loses control. Professor X manages to stop him by using his psychic powers, calming Kevin down; he returns to his normal shape and gets a hug from Moira. Joseph arrives, apologizes to Kevin, and the two reconcile.

Making his debut in the original Tekken in 1994, he is one of four characters (the others being Yoshimitsu, Heihachi Mishima, and Nina Williams) to appear in every installment of the main series. Paul is a short-tempered biker and judo practitioner who repeatedly enters the series' King of Iron Fist tournaments in hopes of winning the prize money and to prove he is the world's best fighter, all while developing a rivalry with the anthropomorphized fighting bear Kuma. He has received mixed critical responses for his personality and his signature hi-top fade hairstyle and has been considered a joke character following his later Tekken series appearances. Appearances=In video games= Paul Phoenix is a hotheaded American biker and martial artist who regularly enters the King of Iron Fist fighting tournaments to prove he is \\"the toughest fighter in the universe\\" while hoping to use the prize money to pay off his debts, yet he falls short of victory each time due to various circumstances. In the first Tekken, Paul battled Kazuya Mishima after an hours-long fight it ended in a draw afterwards he pulled out of the tournament while Kazuya continued and eventually won the entire tournament. He battles his way to the final round in Tekken 2, only to end up having to forfeit after getting stuck in traffic and therefore unable to make the match on time. Paul goes undefeated throughout the tournament in Tekken 3, but after defeating Heihachi Mishima and Ogre, he abruptly leaves the competition under the impression that he has won, when he had one last opponent in Ogre's alter ego, True Ogre. As a result, by Tekken 4, Paul's dojo has gone out of business due to lack of students and he ends up a homeless alcoholic. He again enters the tournament in an attempt to get his life back together. During the first two competitions, Paul had fought and defeated Kuma, a large brown bear trained in combat by Heihachi. After the animal dies of old age, Heihachi trains a replacement, also named Kuma, who beats Paul in the fourth tournament. Paul adopts a new training regimen and gets his revenge against Kuma in Tekken 5, but the match leaves Paul too exhausted to continue in the competition and he is forced to drop out. Again departing the tournament penniless and already burdened by his increasing debt, he wastes no time in entering the sixth tournament in Tekken 6 in hopes of finally easing his financial troubles. This time, he believes assembling a team would increase his chances of victory, and so he joins forces with old friend Marshall Law and boxer Steve Fox. Paul is selectable in noncanonical spinoff Tekken games such as Tekken Tag Tournament, Tekken Card Challenge, Tekken Advance, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, and Tekken Revolution, in addition to the crossover fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken. He is an unlockable character in the 2005 beat-'em-up multiplayer game Urban Reign. He also appears in SNK's mobile phone game The King of Fighters All Star. Design and gameplay Tekken producer Katsuhiro Harada revealed that Paul was inspired by Japanese manga, specifically a character from the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series. Paul is canonically 25 years old at the time of his 1994 Tekken debut. His default costume throughout the series is a red sleeveless judogi and black padded gloves, sporting a scorpion tattoo on his right arm. Paul is given a new look for Tekken 7, with his red gi replaced with casual costumes featuring red, white, and blue themes. A downloadable costume for Paul in Street Fighter X Tekken resembles Street Fighter character Rufus. Paul's fighting style is officially classified as \\"judo\\". GameSpy considered Paul \\"one of the most devastating characters\\" in Tekken 6, with \\"one of the best low attacks\\" and a \\"powerful wall game\\". Neidel Crisan of 1UP.com wrote of Paul in Street Fighter X Tekken that he had \\"a fairly straight forward character with solid combos that may not be flashy, but do a ton of damage,\\" but Tristan Damen of VentureBeat claimed that \\"Paul Phoenix, a powerhouse in his native series, is neutered by his inability to fling fireballs.\\" =In other media and merchandise= Paul makes a cameo appearance in Tekken: The Motion Picture as one of the tournament competitors, and is seen carrying an unconscious Michelle Chang out of the exploding Mishima resort near the conclusion, while he has no dialogue. He additionally had main and minor roles in several Tekken comic book series published between 1997 and 2017. In 1998, Epoch Co. released an action figure of Paul in a black leather outfit as part of their Tekken 3 collection, which was packaged with a display stand and an extra set of interchangeable hands. Reception Paul has received mixed critical reviews for his gameplay, characterization, and distinctive hairstyle. Matt Swider of Gaming Target ranked him the tenth-best Tekken character in 2006. In his 2012 preview of Street Fighter X Tekken, Nate Ming of Crunchyroll described Paul and Marshall Law as \\"get-rich-quick schemers\\". Kevin Wong of Complex ranked Paul third among his twenty best Tekken characters in 2013. Wesley Yin-Poole of Eurogamer wrote that Paul was his preferred character to play in the original PlayStation port of Tekken 3 due to his design and hard-hitting punch, while Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek wrote in 2016 that Paul was deserving of being the central character in an eighth Tekken installment. In an official fan poll held by Namco in 2012, Paul was the third-most requested Tekken character for inclusion in Tekken X Street Fighter, receiving 15.83% (13,975) of 88,280 votes. Rich Knight of Complex ranked Paul's \\"ridiculous\\" Tekken 5 ending second in his 2012 list of the series' fifteen \\"craziest\\" moments. 4thletter.net ranked it 127th in their 2013 selection of the top 200 fighting game endings, while comparing him to Street Fighter joke character Dan Hibiki. While Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist actor Joey Ansah called Paul his favorite Tekken character in a 2014 interview, he was critical of Paul's role in later series installments as \\"a fucking joke.\\" Print advertising for Tekken 2 featured the slogan: \\"Paul Phoenix is about to face 23 fighters. Who's the first person he should kill? His barber.\\" In 2010, Michael Grimm of GamesRadar expressed his desire for a matchup between Paul and Street Fighter character Guile for the then-unreleased Street Fighter X Tekken, citing \\"their awful hair.\\" Tom Goulter of GamesRadar described it as \\"Street Fighter's Ken [having] stuck his finger in an electrical socket.\\" Alex Langley of Arcade Sushi rated it among the \\"10 Greatest Video Game Character Hairdos\\" in 2013. Liana Kerzner of 411Mania.com rated it fourth in her selection of the \\"Top 8 Video Game Hairstyles\\" that same year: \\"Paul takes the title of King of the Stupid Hair, even if he can never quite win a fighting tournament.\\" ShortList included Paul in a feature titled \\"The Rules of Video Game Hairstyles\\": \\"How he manages to maintain such a cliff-like structure is beyond our grooming knowledge.

It is part two of the Destiny's Children series. The book was published by Victor Gollancz Ltd in September 2004. Overview Much of the book is written as large sections of prose explaining theoretical exotic-matter physics. Baxter also sketches the evolution of the Xeelee and an imaginary history of the universe in which life is ubiquitous even under the most extreme conditions. Plot summary Exultant is set in Baxter's \\"Xeelee Sequence\\" twenty thousand years into the Third Expansion of Mankind, \\"a titanic project undertaken by a mankind united by the Doctrines forged by Hama Druz after mankind's near extinction.\\" The human-supremacist Interim Coalition of Governance has conquered almost the whole Milky Way ‚Äî all but the alien Xeelee concentrated at the galactic core around a supermassive black hole called Chandra. The mysterious Xeelee are far more advanced but less numerous than the humans, and the war has been at a stalemate for three millennia even though the entire Coalition has been directed toward the war effort and ten billion humans die at the front every year. In a war fought with faster-than-light technology (equivalent to time travel), each side has foreknowledge of the other's actions and can develop counter-measures to plans before they are made. Pirius is a fighter pilot stationed at the front. When a battle turns to disaster for the Coalition forces, he disobeys suicide orders to stand and fight, choosing instead to risk survival. In a desperate gamble to outrun a pursuing Xeelee, Pirius captures a Xeelee fighter for the first time in history. Returning to base via FTL travel, he arrives two years previous to the battle, when his younger self is still a cadet. Rather than being lauded as a hero, both instances of Pirius are court-martialed for disobeying orders. Commissary Nilis of the Office of Technological Archival and Control, part of the Commission for Historical Truth, defends both the older Pirius (whom he calls \\"Pirius Blue\\") and the younger one (\\"Pirius Red\\") but loses the trial. Pirius Blue is sent to a penal unit at the front as a foot soldier, and Pirius Red is remanded to the custody of Commissary Nilis, who has plans for the fruits of Pirius Blue's battlefield victory. Using the Xeelee fighter and the innovative tactics that saved Pirius Blue, he starts to plan an unheard of assault on the Xeelee's primary stronghold at Chandra itself. While Nilis and his new team struggle to confront ossified government and military institutions, they try to understand and to develop new and sometimes alien technologies: FTL computers, a gravastar shield to protect them from FTL foreknowledge, and a black hole gun, capable of disrupting a supermassive black hole's event horizon. Meanwhile, in the course of his new duties to Commissary Nilis, Pirius Red is practically taken on a tour of the Solar system and some of the Coalition's most scandalous secrets, rife with references to events from previous books in the Xeelee sequence. As Nilis's project nears completion, it transpires that the Chandra black hole is home to not only the Xeelee, but a host of other organisms, many of which are based on exotic physics and non- baryonic matter. Regardless, the assault on the black hole continues despite protestations from Nilis. After a brutal fight to reach the surface of the black hole, the team commence their assault, causing the Xeelee to abandon it (and the rest of the Milky Way galaxy) to prevent humanity from harming the black hole's inhabitants. After the assault, the protagonists realise that the Coalition is unlikely to remain intact, now that the war with the Xeelee is no longer present to hold it together. Luru Parz, one of the team, realises that the Xeelee will eventually return, and returns to Earth to ready its defences for when the return happens.

Historically, the term was applied to predominantly Christian groups, and this usage remains common today. The term is currently sometimes employed in a restrictive sense to only refer to speakers of Tigrinya, and sometimes in an expanded sense to include Muslim communities as well as Christians. Recently, some within diasporic communities have adopted the term to refer to all people of Eritrean or Ethiopian origin. Usage Historically, the term \\"Habesha\\" represented northern Ethiopian Highlands Orthodox Christians, while the Oromos and \\"Shanqella\\" ethnic groups, as well as Muslims, were considered outside the periphery. Predominately Muslim ethnic groups in the Eritrean Highlands such as the Tigre have historically opposed the name Habesha; Muslim Tigrinya- speakers are usually referred to as Jeberti people. At the turn of the 20th century, elites of the Solomonic dynasty employed the conversion of various ethnic groups to Orthodox Tewahedo Christianity and the imposition of the Amharic and Tigrinya languages to spread a common Habesha national identity. Within Ethiopian and Eritrean diasporic populations, some second generation immigrants have adopted the term \\"Habesha\\" in a broader sense as a supra- national ethnic identifier inclusive of all Eritreans and Ethiopians. For those who employ the term, it serves as a useful counter to more exclusionary identities. However, this usage is not uncontested: On the one hand, those who grew up in Ethiopia or Eritrea may object to the obscuring of national specificity. On the other hand, groups that were subjugated in Ethiopia or Eritrea sometimes find the term offensive. Etymology The modern term derives from Semitic languages: , first written in unvowelled script as ; ; .Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. p. 948. The earliest known use of the term dates to the second or third century Sabaean inscription recounting the defeat of the n…ôgus (\\"king\\") GDRT of Aksum and ·∏§B≈†T. The early Semitic term appears to refer to a group of peoples, rather than a specific ethnicity. Egyptian inscriptions refer to the people that they traded with in Punt as , \\"the bearded ones.\\" Francis Breyer believes the Egyptian demonym to be the source of the Semitic term. The first attestation of late Latin Abissensis is from the fifth century CE. Modern Western European languages, including English, appear to borrow this term from the post-classical form Abissini in the mid-sixteenth century. (English Abyssin is attested from 1576, and Abissinia and Abyssinia from the 1620s.)  History Abyssinia depicted on map before 1884 Berlin Conference to divide Africa. Abyssinian civilization has its roots in the pre-Aksumite culture. An early kingdom to arise was that of D'mt in the 8th century BC. The Kingdom of Aksum, one of the powerful civilizations of the ancient world, was based there from about 150 BC to the mid of 12th century AD. Spreading far beyond the city of Aksum, it molded one of the earliest cultures of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Architectural remains include finely carved stelae, extensive palaces, and ancient places of worship that are still being used. Around the time that the Aksumite empire began to decline, the burgeoning religion of Islam made its first inroads in the Abyssinian highlands. During the first Hegira, the companions of prophet Muhammad were received in the Aksumite kingdom. The Sultanate of Showa, established around 896, was one of the oldest local Muslim states. It was centered in the former Shewa province in central Ethiopia. The polity was succeeded by the Sultanate of Ifat around 1285. Ifat was governed from its capital at Zeila in northern Somalia and was the easternmost district of the former Shewa Sultanate. =Antiquity= Kingdom of D ømt. Throughout history, populations in the Horn of Africa had been interacting through migration, trade, warfare and intermarriage. Most people in the region spoke Afroasiatic languages, with the family's Cushitic and Semitic branches predominant.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 62 As early as the 3rd millennium BCE, the pre-Aksumites had begun trading along the Red Sea. They mainly traded with Egypt. Earlier trade expeditions were taken by foot along the Nile Valley. The ancient Egyptians' main objective in the Red Sea trade was to acquire myrrh. This was a commodity that the Horn region, which the ancient Egyptians referred to as the Land of Punt, had in abundance. Much of the incense is produced in Somalia to this day. The Kingdom of Aksum may have been founded as early as 300 BCE. Very little is known of the time period between the mid-1st millennium BCE to the beginning of Aksum's rise around the 1st century CE. It is thought to be a successor kingdom of D ømt, a kingdom in the early 1st millennium BC most likely centered at nearby Yeha.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 4 The Kingdom of Aksum was situated in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, with its capital city in Northern Ethiopia. Axum remained its capital until the 7th century. The kingdom was favorably located near the Blue Nile basin and the Afar depression. The former is rich in gold and the latter in salt: both materials having a highly important use to the Aksumites. Aksum was accessible to the port of Adulis, Eritrea on the coast of the Red Sea. The kingdom traded with Egypt, India, Arabia and the Byzantine Empire. Aksum's \\"fertile\\" and \\"well-watered\\" location produced enough food for its population. Wild animals included elephants and rhinoceros.Pankhurst 1998, pp. 22-3 From its capital, Aksum commanded the trade of ivory. It also dominated the trade route in the Red Sea leading to the Gulf of Aden. Its success depended on resourceful techniques, production of coins, steady migrations of Greco-Roman merchants, and ships landing at Adulis. In exchange for Aksum's goods, traders bid many kinds of cloth, jewelry, metals and steel for weapons. At its peak, Aksum controlled territories as far as southern Egypt, east to the Gulf of Aden, south to the Omo River, and west to the Nubian Kingdom of Mero√´. The South Arabian kingdom of the Himyarites and also a portion of western Saudi Arabia was also under the power of Aksum. Their descendants include the present-day ethnic groups known as the Amhara, Tigrayans and Gurage peoples. =Medieval and Early Modern period= After the fall of Aksum due to declining sea trade from fierce competition by Muslims and changing climate, the power base of the kingdom migrated south and shifted its capital to Kubar (near Agew). They moved southwards because, even though the Axumite Kingdom welcomed and protected the companions of Prophet Muhammad to Ethiopia, who came as refugees to escape the persecution of the ruling families of Mecca and earned the friendship and respect of the Prophet. Their friendship deteriorated when South-Arabians invaded the Dahlak islands through the port of Adulis and destroyed it, which was the economic backbone for the prosperous Aksumite Kingdom. Fearing of what recently occurred, Axum shifted its capital near Agew] In the middle of the sixteenth century Adal Sultanate armies led by Harar leader Ahmed Gragn invaded Habesha lands in what is known as the \\"Conquest of Habasha\\". Following Gragn invasions the southern part of the Empire was lost to Ethiopia and scattered Habesha like the Gurage people were cut off from the rest of Abyssinia. In the late sixteenth century the nomadic Oromo people penetrated the Habesha plains occupying large territories during the Oromo migrations. Abyssinian warlords often competed with each other for dominance of the realm. The Amharas seemed to gain the upper hand with the accession of Yekuno Amlak of Ancient Bete Amhara in 1270, after defeating the Agaw lords of Lasta (in those days a non-Semitic-speaking region of Abyssinia) Emperor Yohannes IV with his son and heir, Ras Araya Selassie Yohannes. The Gondarian dynasty, which since the 16th century had become the centre of Royal pomp and ceremony of Abyssinia, finally lost its influence as a result of the emergence of powerful regional lords, following the murder of Iyasu I, also known as Iyasu the Great. The decline in the prestige of the dynasty led to the semi-anarchic era of Zemene Mesafint (\\"Era of the Princes\\"), in which rival warlords fought for power and the Yejju Oromo enderases (\\"regents\\") had effective control. The emperors were considered to be figureheads. Until a young man named Kassa Haile Giorgis also known as Emperor Tewodros brought end to Zemene Mesafint by defeating all his rivals and took the throne in 1855. The Tigrayans made only a brief return to the throne in the person of Yohannes IV in 1872, whose death in 1889 resulted in the power base shifting back to the dominant Amharic-speaking elite. His successor Menelik II an Emperor of Amhara origin seized power. League of Nations in 1935 reported that after the invasion of Menelik's forces into non Abyssinian lands of Somalis, Harari, Oromo, Sidama, Shanqella etc, the inhabitants were enslaved and heavily taxed by the gebbar system leading to depopulation. Fasilides' Castle in Gondar, Amhara Region. Some scholars consider the Amhara to have been Ethiopia's ruling elite for centuries, represented by the Solomonic line of Emperors ending in Haile Selassie I. Marcos Lemma and other scholars dispute the accuracy of such a statement, arguing that other ethnic groups have always been active in the country's politics. This confusion may largely stem from the mislabeling of all Amharic-speakers as \\"Amhara\\", and the fact that many people from other ethnic groups have adopted Amharic names. Another is the claim that most Ethiopians can trace their ancestry to multiple ethnic groups, including the last self-proclaimed emperor Haile Selassie I and his Empress Itege Menen Asfaw of Ambassel.Emperor Haile Selassie I, Part 1 , Official Ethiopian Monarchy Website. Origins=Indigenous theory= Nigist (Queen) Makeda of Sheba The Imperial family of Ethiopia (which is currently in exile) claims its origin directly from descent from Solomon and the Queen of Sheba (), who is named Makeda () in the Ethiopian account. The Ethiopian narrative Kebra Negast (\\"Glory of Kings\\"), written in 1225 AD contains an account of Makeda and her descendants. Solomon is said in this account to have seduced the Queen, and sired a son by her, who would eventually become Menelik I, the first Emperor of Ethiopia. The tradition that the biblical Queen of Sheba was an ingenuous ruler of Ethiopia who visited King Solomon in Jerusalem is repeated in a 1st-century account by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus. He identified Solomon‚Äôs visitor as a queen of Egypt and Ethiopia. There is no primary evidence, archaeological or textual, for the queen in Ethiopia. The impressive ruins at Aksum are a thousand years too late for a queen contemporary with Solomon, based on traditional dates for him of the 10th century BC.\\"The Queen Of Sheba\\" , BBC History In the past, European scholars including Hiob Ludolf and Carlo Conti Rossini postulated that the ancient communities that evolved into the modern Ethiopian state were formed by a migration across the Red Sea of Semitic-speaking South Arabians around 1000 BC, who intermarried with local non-Semitic-speaking peoples. Both the indigenous languages of Southern Arabia and the Amharic and Tigrinya languages of Ethiopia belong to the large branch of South Semitic languages which in turn is part of the Afro-Asiatic Language Family. Even though the Ethiosemitic languages are classified under the South Semitic languages branch with a Cushitic language substratum, Edward Ullendorff and Carlo Conti Rossini's theory that Ethioemitic-language speakers of the northern Ethiopian Highlands were ancient foreigners from Southwestern Arabia has been disputed by most modern indigenous Horn African scholars like Messay Kebede and Daniel E. Alemu. Ethiopian scholars specializing in Ethiopian Studies such as Messay Kebede and Daniel E. Alemu generally disagree with this theory arguing that the migration was one of reciprocal exchange, if it even occurred at all. Kebede states the following: > This is not to say that events associated with conquest, conflict and > resistance did not occur. No doubt, they must have been frequent. But the > crucial difference lies in the propensity to present them, not as the > process by which an alien majority imposed its rule but as part of an > ongoing struggle of native forces competing for supremacy in the region.

African Renaissance. 4 (1): 56‚Äì64 ‚Äì via Ingenta. Scholars have determined that the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia was not derived from an Old South Arabian language such as Sabaean. There is evidence of a Semitic-speaking presence in Ethiopia and Eritrea as early as 2000 BC.Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, \\"Ge'ez\\" (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005), p. 732. There is also evidence of ancient Southern Arabian communities in modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea in certain localities, attested by some archaeological artifacts and ancient Sabaean inscriptions in the old South Arabian alphabet. However, Stuart Munro-Hay points to the existence of an older D'MT kingdom, prior to any Sabaean migration c. 4th or 5th century BC, as well as evidence that Sabaean immigrants had resided in Ethiopia for little more than a few decades at the time of the inscriptions.Munro-Hay, Aksum, p. 57. Archeological evidence has revealed a region called Saba in Northern Ethiopia and Eritrea; it is now referred to as \\"Ethiopian Saba\\" to avoid confusion. Essentially no archaeological evidence supports the story of the Queen of Sheba. \\"In the 21st century, scholars have largely discounted the longstanding presumption that Sabaean migrants had played a direct role in Ethiopian civilization.\\" Munro-May and related scholars believe that Sabaean influence was minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have represented a trading colony (tarding post) or military installations in a symbiotic or military alliance between the Sabaens and D\`MT. In the reign of King Ezana, c. early 4th century AD, the term \\"Ethiopia\\" is listed as one of the nine regions under his domain, translated in the Greek version of his inscription as Aithiop√≠a. This is the first known use of this term to describe specifically the region known today as Ethiopia (and not Kush or the entire African and Indian region outside of Egypt). The 6th-century author Stephanus of Byzantium later used the term \\"ŒëŒ≤Œ±œÉŒ∑Œ≥ŒøŒØ\\" (i.e. Abasƒìnoi) to refer to: > an Arabian people living next to the Sabaeans together with the ·∏§a·∏çramites. > The region of the Abasƒìnoi produce[d] myrrh, incense and cotton and they > cultivate[d] a plant which yields a purple dye (probably wars, i.e. Fleminga > Grahamiana). It lies on a route which leads from Zabƒ´d on the coastal plain > to the ·∏§imyarite capital ·∫íafƒÅr. Abasƒìnoi was located by Hermann von Wissman as a region in the Jabal ·∏§ubaysh () mountain in Ibb Governorate, perhaps related in etymology with the ·∏•b≈° Semitic root). Other place names in Yemen contain the ·∏•b≈° root, such as the Jabal ·∏§aba≈°i, whose residents are still called al-A·∏•bu≈° (pl. of ·∏§aba≈°).Uhlig, Siegbert, ed. Encyclopaedia Aethiopica;: D-Ha. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. pp. 949. The location of the Abasƒìnoi in Yemen may perhaps be explained by remnant Aksumite populations from the 520s conquest by King Kaleb. King Ezana's claims to Sahlen (Saba) and Dhu-Raydan (Himyar) during a time when such control was unlikely may indicate an Aksumite presence or coastal foothold.Munro-Hay. Aksum, p. 72. Traditional scholarship has assumed that the Habashat were a tribe from modern-day Yemen that migrated to Ethiopia and Eritrea. However, the Sabaic inscriptions only use the term ·∏•b≈°t to the refer to the Kingdom of Aksum and its inhabitants, especially during the 3rd century, when the ·∏•b≈°t (Aksumites) were often at war with the Sabaeans and Himyraites. =South Arabian/Sabaean origin theory= Ancient stone slabs with Sabaean inscriptions found at Yeha, Ethiopia.Before the 20th century, the Sabean theory was the most common one explaining the origins of the Habesha. It was first suggested by German orientalist Hiob Ludolf and revived by early 20th-century Italian scholar Conti Rossini. They said that at an early epoch, South Arabian tribes, including one called the \\"Habashat,\\" emigrated across the Red Sea from Yemen to Eritrea. According to this theory, Sabaeans brought with them South Arabian letters and language, which gradually evolved into the Ge'ez language and Ge'ez script. Linguists have revealed, however, that although its script developed from Epigraphic South Arabian (whose oldest inscriptions are found in Yemen, Ethiopia and Eritrea) used to write the Old South Arabian languages, Ge'ez is descended from a different branch of Semitic, Ethiosemitic or Ethiopic sub-branch. The large corpus of South Arabian inscriptions does not mention any migration to the west coast of the Red Sea, nor of a tribe called \\"Habashat.\\" All uses of the term date to the 3rd century AD and later, when they referred to the people of the Kingdom of Aksum. In the 21st century, the Sabean theory has largely been abandoned.Stefan Weninger. \\"·∏§√§b√§shat\\", Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha. Edward Ullendorff has asserted that the Tigrayans and the Amhara comprise \\"Abyssinians proper\\" and a \\"Semitic outpost,\\" while Donald N. Levine has argued that this view \\"neglects the crucial role of non-Semitic elements in Ethiopian culture.\\" Edward Ullendorff and Carlo Conti Rossini's theory that Ethioemitic-language speakers of the northern Ethiopian Highlands were ancient foreigners from Southwestern Arabia that displaced the original peoples of the Horn, has been disputed by most modern indigenous Horn African scholars like Messay Kebede, Daniel E. Alemu, and others. Genetically, culturally, and geographically speaking Habeshas (Abyssinian people) are traditionally Cushitic Peoples.Kebede, Messay (2003). \\"Eurocentrism and Ethiopian Historiography: Deconstructing Semitization\\". University of Dayton-Department of Philosophy. International Journal of Ethiopian Studies. Tsehai Publishers. 1: 1‚Äì19 ‚Äì via JSTOR.Alemu, Daniel E. (2007). \\"Re-imagining the Horn\\". African Renaissance. 4.1: 56‚Äì64 ‚Äì via Ingenta. Ethiopia and Sudan are among the main areas linguists suggest were the Afro-Asiatic Urheimat. Recent linguistic studies as to the origin of the Ethiosemitic languages seem to support the DNA findings of immigration from the Arabian Peninsula, with a recent study using Bayesian computational phylogenetic techniques finding that \\"contemporary Ethiosemitic languages of Africa reflect a single introduction of early Ethiosemitic from southern Arabia approximately 2,800 years ago\\", and that this single introduction of Ethiosemitic subsequently underwent quick diversification within Ethiopia and Eritrea. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of Semitic languages identifies an Early Bronze Age origin of Semitic in the Near East. There are many theories regarding the beginning of the Abyssinian civilization. One theory, which is more widely accepted today, locates its origins in the Horn region.Stuart Munro-Hay, Aksum: An African Civilisation of Late Antiquity. Edinburgh: University Press, 1991, pp. 57f. At a later period, this culture was exposed to Judaic influence, of which the best-known examples are the Qemant and Ethiopian Jews (or Beta Israel) ethnic groups, but Judaic customs, terminology, and beliefs can be found amongst the dominant culture of the Amhara and Tigrinya.For an overview of this influence see Ullendorff, Ethiopia and the Bible, pp. 73ff. Some scholars have claimed that the Indian alphabets had been used to create the vowel system of the Ge'ez abugida, this claim has not yet been effectively proven.  Culture  The Habesha developed an agricultural society, which most continue, including raising of camels, donkeys, and sheep. They plow using oxen. The Orthodox Church is an integral part of the culture. The church buildings are built on hills. Major celebrations during the year are held around the church, where people gather from villages all around to sing, play games, and observe the unique mass of the church. It includes a procession through the church grounds and environs. Coffee is a very important ceremonial drink. The \\"coffee ceremony\\" is common to the Ethiopians and Eritreans. Beans are roasted on the spot, ground, and brewed, served thick and rich in tiny ceramic cups with no handles. This amount of coffee can be finished in one gulp if drunk cold; but, traditionally it is drunk very slowly as conversation takes place. When the beans are roasted to smoking, they are passed around the table, where the smoke becomes a blessing on the diners. The traditional food served at these meals consists of injera, a spongy flat bread, served with wat, a spicy meat sauce. Houses in rural areas are built mostly from rock and dirt, the most available resources, with structure provided by timber poles. The houses blend in easily with the natural surroundings. Many times the nearest water source is more than a kilometer away from the house. In addition, people must search for fuel for their fires throughout the surrounding area. The Habesha people have a rich heritage of music and dance, using drums and stringed instruments tuned to a pentatonic scale. Arts and crafts and secular music are performed mostly by artisans, who are regarded with suspicion. Sacred music is performed and icons are painted only by men trained in monasteries. =Northern Highlander Language and literature= The Ge'ez script on a 15th-century Ethiopian Coptic prayer book. Abyssinians speak languages belonging to the Ethiopian Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic family. Among these tongues is the classical Ge'ez language. The kingdom of D ømt wrote proto-Ge'ez in Epigraphic South Arabian as early as the 9th century BCE. Later, an independent script replaced it as early as the 5th century BCE.2 Ge'ez literature is considered to begin with the adoption of Christianity in Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as the civilization of Axum in the 4th century BCE during the reign of Ezana. While Ge'ez today is extinct and only used for liturgical purposes in the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Ge'ez language is ancestral to Tigre and Tigrinya languages. Some historians in the past have labelled the Ethiopian Semitic languages as the Abyssinian languages. They are mainly spoken by the Amhara, the Tigrayans, the Tigre, the Gurage, the Argobba and the Harari people.Igor π Mikhaƒ≠lovich D πiÔ∏†aÔ∏°konov Semito-Hamitic Languages: An Essay in Classification - Google Books\\": Nauka, Central Department of Oriental Literature, (1965) pp 12 In antiquity Ge'ez-speaking people inhabited Axum empire; the ancient Semitic-speaking Gafat inhabited Eastern Damot (East Welega) and Western Shewa; the Galila clan of Aymallal (Sodo) inhabited Southwest Shewa; the Zay inhabited East Shewa; the Harla who are the ancestors of Harari lived in Somalia; and the other ancient Argobba and Harari inhabited Shewa, Ifat, and Adal.Robert Hetzron Ethiopian Semitic: Studies in Classification - Internet Archive\\": Manchester University Press, 1972 p. 6.Nehemia Levtzion, Randall Pouwels The History of Islam in Africa - Google Books\\" Ohio University Press, 2000. p. 228.George Wynn Brereton Huntingford The Historical Geography of Ethiopia: From the First Century Ad to 1704 - Google Books\\" British Academy, 1989. p. 78. =Customs= Traditional Habesha injera Throughout history, various European travelers such as Jeronimo Lobo, James Bruce and Mansfield Parkyns visited Abyssinia. Their written accounts about their experiences include observations and descriptions of the Abyssinian customs and manners. ;Cuisine Habesha cuisine characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes, usually in the form of wat (also w'et or wot), a thick stew, served atop injera, a large sourdough flatbread,Javins, Marie. \\"Eating and Drinking in Ethiopia.\\" Gonomad.com . Accessed July 2011. which is about in diameter and made out of fermented teff flour. People of Ethiopia and Eritrea eat exclusively with their right hands, using pieces of injera to pick up bites of entr√©es and side dishes. Habesha women in traditional Habesha kemis performing a folklore dance.Fit-fit, or fir-fir, is a common breakfast dish. It is made from shredded injera or kitcha stir-fried with spices or wat. Another popular breakfast food is fatira. The delicacy consists of a large fried pancake made with flour, often with a layer of egg, eaten with honey. Chechebsa (or kita firfir) resembles a pancake covered with berbere and niter kibbeh, or spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. A porridge, genfo is another common breakfast dish. It is usually served in a large bowl with a dug-out made in the middle of the genfo and filled with spiced niter kibbeh. Wat begins with a large amount of chopped red onion, which is simmered or sauteed in a pot. Once the onions have softened, niter kebbeh (or, in the case of vegan dishes, vegetable oil) is added. Following this, berbere is added to make a spicy keiy wat or keyyih tsebhi. Turmeric is used instead of bebere for a milder alicha wat or both are omitted when making vegetable stews, atkilt wat. Meat such as beef (,Selam Soft, \\"·à•·åã\\" , Amharic-English Dictionary', 4/30/13 s…ôga), chicken (,Selam Soft, \\"·ã∂·àÆ\\" , Amharic-English Dictionary', 4/30/13 doro) or ), fish (,Selam Soft, \\"·ãì·à£\\" , Amharic-English Dictionary', 4/30/13 asa), goat or lamb (,Selam Soft, \\"'·â†·åç , Amharic-English Dictionary', 4/30/13 beg or ) is also added. Legumes such as split peas (,Selam Soft, \\"·ä≠·ä≠\\" , Amharic-English Dictionary', 4/30/13 k…ôk or ) or lentils (,Selam Soft, \\"·àù·àµ·à≠\\" , Amharic-English Dictionary', 4/30/13 m…ôs…ôr or birsin); or vegetables such as potatoes (,Selam Soft, \\"·ãµ·äï·âΩ\\" , Amharic-English Dictionary', 4/30/13 D…ôn…ôch), carrots and chard () are also used instead in vegan dishes. Another distinctively Habesha dish is kitfo (frequently spelled ketfo). It consists of raw (or rare) beef mince marinated in mitmita (Ge'ez: ·àö·å•·àö·å£ mƒ´·π≠mƒ´·π≠ƒÅ, a very spicy chili powder similar to the berbere) and niter kibbeh. Gored gored is very similar to kitfo, but uses cubed rather than ground beef. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church prescribes a number of fasting (tsom , ·π£≈çm) periods, including Wednesdays, Fridays, and the entire Lenten season; so Habesha cuisine contains many dishes that are vegan.Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time: a history of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 12 and note ;Dress The habesha kemis is the traditional attire of Habesha women.Travel & Leisure Volume 36 2006 \\"A woman with her hair in tight braids and wearing habesha kemis ‚Äî a white ankle-length dress with intricate embroidery ‚Äî came around to each of us with a silver kettle of warm water and a silver basin for washing our hands.\\"Lisa L. Schoonover, 2012, The Indigo Butterfly, p.114 The ankle length dress is usually worn by Ethiopian and Eritrean women at formal events. It is made of chiffon, and typically comes in white, grey or beige shades. Many women also wrap a shawl called a netela around the formal dress. The netela or netsela is a handmade cloth many Ethiopian women use to cover their head and shoulders when they wear clothing made out of chiffon, especially when attending church. It is made up of two layers of fabric, unlike gabi, which is made out of four. Kuta is the male version. An Ethiopian or Eritrean suit is the traditional formal wear of Habesha men.Janet Jaymes Dirty Laundry: a memoir. 2006, p. 89. It consists of a long sleeve, knee-length shirt, and matching pants. Most shirts are made with a Mandarin, band, or Nehru collar. The suit is made of chiffon, which is a sheer silk or rayon cloth. The netela shawl or a kuta is wrapped around the suit. Religion=Christianity= The Habesha empire centered in Axum and Adowa was part of the world in which Christianity grew. The arrival of Christianity in Northern Ethiopia and Eritrea happened around the 4th century. The Aksumites, in fact, had been converted to Christianity hundreds of years before most of Europe. Many of their churches were cut into cliffs or from single blocks of stone, as they were in Turkey and in parts of Greece, where Christianity had existed from its earliest years. The church is a central feature of communities and of each family's daily life. Each community has a church with a patron saint. Ethiopia has often been mentioned in the Bible. A well-known example of this is the story of the Ethiopian eunuch as written in Acts (8: 27): \\"Then the angel of the Lord said to Philip, Start out and go south to the road that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza. So he set out and was on his way when he caught sight of an Ethiopian. This man was a eunuch, a high official of the Kandake (Candace) Queen of Ethiopia in charge of all her treasure.\\" The passage continues by describing how Philip helped the Ethiopian understand one passage of Isaiah that the Ethiopian was reading. After the Ethiopian received an explanation of the passage, he requested that Philip baptize him, which Philip obliged. Queen Gersamot Hendeke VII (very similar to Kandake) was the Queen of Ethiopia from the year 42 to 52. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was founded in the 4th century by Syrian monks. Historically, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church have had strong ties with the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria appointing the archbishop for the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. They gained independence from the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria in the 1950s, although the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church has recently reforged the link. Eritrean Tigrayans: A traditional wedding. Ethiopian Orthodox priests playing sistra and a drum A number of unique beliefs and practices distinguish Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity from other Christian groups; for example, the Ark of the Covenant is very important. Every Ethiopian church has a replica of the Ark. Also, the Ethiopian Church has a larger biblical canon than other churches. Church services are conducted in Ge¬¥ez, the ancient language of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Ge¬¥ez is no longer a living language, its use now confined to liturgical contexts, occupying a similar place in Eritrean and Ethiopian church life to Latin in the Roman Catholic Church. Other Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox practices include such things as fasting, prescribed prayers, and devotion to saints and angels. A child is never left alone until baptism and cleansing rituals are performed. Boys are baptized forty days after birth, whereas girls are baptized eighty days after birth. Defrocked priests and deacons commonly function as diviners, who are the main healers. Spirit possession is common, affecting primarily women. Women are also the normal spirit mediums. A debtera is an itinerant lay priest figure trained by the Church as a scribe, cantor, and often as a folk healer, who may also function in roles comparable to a deacon or exorcist. Folklore and legends ascribe the role of magician to the debtera as well. A small number of Abyssinian Christians adhere to various forms of Pentecostalism or Anabaptism, collectively known as P'ent'ay. Similarities to Judaism and Islam The Chapel of the Tablet at the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion is believed to house the original Ark of the Covenant. The Ethiopian church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in the Roman Catholic or Protestant churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in Orthodox or Conservative Judaism.http://www.kebranegast.com Kebra Negast Ethiopian Christians, like some other Eastern Christians, traditionally follow dietary rules that are similar to Jewish Kashrut, specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike Kashrut, Ethiopian cuisine does mix dairy products with meat- which in turn makes it even closer to Islamic dietary laws (see Halal). Women are prohibited from entering the church during their menses; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (or shash) while in church in keeping with . As with Orthodox synagogues, men and women are seated separately in the Ethiopian church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar). However, women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in the Church building officially is common to many Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox and Catholic Christians and not unique to Judaism. Ethiopian Orthodox worshippers remove their shoes when entering a church, in accordance with (in which Moses, while viewing the burning bush, is commanded to remove his shoes while standing on holy ground). Furthermore, both the Sabbath (Saturday), and the Lord's Day (Sunday) are observed as holy, although more emphasis, because of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, is laid upon the Holy Sunday. =Islam= The Mosque of the Companions, Massawa, reportedly Africa's oldest mosque, built by Muhammad‚Äôs companions in 615 CE. Islam in Ethiopia and Eritrea dates to 615. During that year, a group of Muslims were counseled by Muhammad to escape persecution in Mecca and migrate to Abyssinia, which was ruled by, in Muhammad's estimation, a pious Christian king (al-najashi). Muhammad's followers crossed the Red Sea and sought refuge in the Kingdom of Aksum, possibly settling at Negash, a place in present-day Tigray Region. Moreover, Islamic tradition states that Bilal, one of the foremost companions of Muhammad, was from Abyssinia, as were many non-Arab Companions of Muhammad; in fact, Abyssinians were the single largest non-Arab ethnic group who were Muhammad's companions. Among these was Umm Ayman who cared for Muhammad during his infancy, a woman that he referred to as \\"mother\\". Abyssinia was thus the earliest home outside of Arabia for the dispersal of the Islamic world faith. One third(34%) of Ethiopia's population are Muslims by last census (2007). Most of Ethiopia and Eritrea's Muslims are Sunni Muslims, much like the majority of the Muslim world, hence the beliefs and practices of the Muslims of Ethiopia and Eritrea are basically the same: embodied in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. There are also Sufi orders present in Ethiopia. According to the 1994 census of Ethiopia (with similar numbers for the 1984 census), about a third of its population is adherent of Islam and members of the Muslim community can be found throughout the country. Islam in Ethiopia is the predominant religion in the regions of Somali, Afar, Berta, and the section of Oromia east of the Great Rift Valley, as well as in Jimma. Islam in Eritrea is the predominant religion of all the ethnic groups except for the Tigrayan people, the Bilen people, and the Kunama people. The most important Islamic religious practices, such as the daily ritual prayers (·π£alƒÅt) and fasting ( ·π£awm, Ethiopic , ·π£om ‚Äì used by local Christians as well) during the holy month of Ramadan, are observed both in urban centers as well as in rural areas, among both settled peoples and nomads. Numerous Ethiopian Muslims perform the pilgrimage to Mecca every year. Ethiopian Gurage: Celebrity singer Mahmoud Ahmed. =Judaism= Judaism in Ethiopia is believed to date from very ancient times. Precisely what its early history was, however, remains obscure. The now dominant Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims it originated from the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon back in the 10th century BCE. This visit is mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures (I Kings 10:1), Sheba was a kingdom that stretched from Ethiopia to the south of the Yemen. Yemen is very close to Ethiopia across the Red Sea, and it has been recorded that modern Ethiopia has been heavily influenced by the ancient Sabean kingdom. Moreover, the details of the queen's visit, including the alleged theft of the Holy Ark as well as Solomon getting her pregnant with a child who established the \\"Solomonic\\" lineage in Ethiopia, as given in Christian Ethiopian tradition, were written in the Kebra Nagast the Ethiopian chronicle of its early history. The oldest known existing copies of the book date from as far back as the 13th century. Jewish Ethiopians are mentioned in both the Torah Old Testament as well as the Christian New Testament. It is clear that the Jewish presence in Ethiopia dates back at least 2,500 years. ethnic Jewish (Beta Israel Ethiopian Jew) Israeli Border Policeman The Jewish Pre-settlement Theory essentially states that starting around the 8th century BCE until about the 5th century BCE, there was an influx of Jewish settlers both from Egypt & Sudan in the north, and southern Arabia in the east. The chief Semitic languages of Ethiopia also suggest an antiquity of Judaism in Ethiopia. \\"There still remains the curious circumstance that a number of Abyssinian words connected with religion‚ÄîHell, idol, Easter, purification, alms‚Äîare of Hebrew origin. These words must have been derived directly from a Jewish source, for the Abyssinian Church knows the scriptures only in a Ge'ez version made from the Septuagint.\\" Beta Israel traditions claim that the Ethiopian Jews are descended from the lineage of Moses himself, some of whose children and relatives are said to have separated from the other Children of Israel after the Exodus and gone southwards, or, alternatively or together with this, that they are descended from the tribe of Dan, which fled southwards down the Arabian coastal lands from Judaea at the time of the breakup of the Kingdom of Israel into two kingdoms in the 10th century BCE. (precipitated by the oppressive demands of Rehoboam, King Solomon's heir), or at the time of the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in the 8th century BCE. Certainly there was trade as early as the time of King Solomon down along the Red Sea to the Yemen and even as far as India, according to the Bible, and there would, therefore, have been Jewish settlements at various points along the trade routes. There is definite archaeological evidence of Jewish settlements and of their cultural influence on both sides of the Red Sea well at least 2,500 years ago, both along the Arabian coast and in the Yemen, on the eastern side, and along the southern Egyptian and Sudanese coastal regions.

She was noted for her humanitarian efforts to save Romanian Jews during World War II, which led to her being awarded by the State of Israel with the honorific of Righteous Among the Nations in 1993. Daughter of King Constantine I of Greece and his wife, Princess Sophia of Prussia, Princess Helen spent her childhood in Greece, Great Britain and Germany. The outbreak of World War I and the overthrow of her father by the Allies in 1917 permanently marked her and also separated her from her favorite brother, the young Alexander I of Greece. Exiled in Switzerland along with most members of the royal family, Helen then spent several months caring for her father, plagued by disease and depression. In 1920, the princess met Carol, Crown Prince of Romania, who quickly asked her hand in marriage. Despite the bad reputation of the prince, Helen accepted and moved to Romania, where she soon gave birth to their only son, Prince Michael, in 1921. The situation of her family, however, continued to worry Helen, who made several trips abroad to visit her parents when they did not simply reside with her in Bucharest. In doing this, she distanced herself from her husband, whose multiple affairs ended when he fell in love with Magda Lupescu in 1924. Finally, in 1925, Prince Carol abandoned his wife and renounced the throne in order to live openly with his mistress. Distraught, Helen tried to persuade her husband to return to her but eventually she accepted the divorce in 1928. In the meanwhile, Helen was proclaimed \\"Queen Mother of Romania\\" in 1927, as her son Michael ascended to the throne under the regency of his uncle Prince Nicholas. However, the political situation in Romania was complicated and Carol took advantage of the increased instability to return to Bucharest in 1930 and be acclaimed as king. Soon, the new ruler forced his ex-wife into exile and only authorized her to see their son two months per year. In these circumstances, Helen moved to Villa Sparta at Fiesole, Tuscany. Always close to her family, she hosted her sisters Irene and Katherine and brother Paul, who stayed with her intermittently until the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935. The outbreak of World War II, the deposition of Carol II and the subsequent dismemberment of Greater Romania in 1940, however, brought Helen back to be with her son in Bucharest. Subject to the dictatorship of General Antonescu and vigilance of Nazi Germany, the king and his mother were cautious in their dealings with the fascist regime. They did not show their opposition to the participation of Romania in the invasion of the Soviet Union and the deportation of Jews. Finally, King Michael organized a coup against Antonescu on 23 August 1944 and Romania turned against the Axis powers; however, the country was, in the end, occupied by the Red Army. For Helen and her son, the post-war period was marked by the interference of the Soviet Union in the Romanian political life. In March 1945, the king was forced to accept a communist government headed by Petru Groza while the following year, the rigged general elections confirmed the hegemony of the PCR in the country. Finally, Michael I was forced to abdicate on 30 December 1947 and the royal family took the path of exile. Helen then returned to the Villa Sparta, where she divided her time among her family, gardening and the study of Italian art. Increasingly concerned about her finances, Helen finally left Italy for Switzerland in 1979 and died three years later with her son at her side. Princess of Greece and Denmark=A Greek childhood= Greek Royal Family in 1914. King Constantine I and Queen Sophia surrounded by their five older children (from left to right): Paul, Alexander, George, Helen and Irene. The third child and eldest daughter of Crown Prince Constantine of Greece and Princess Sophia of Prussia,Gould Lee 1956, p. 15. Helen was born on 2 May 1896 in Athens during the reign of her grandfather, King George I.Gould Lee 1956, p. 17. From birth, she received the nickname \\"Sitta\\" as her brother Alexander failed to correctly pronounce the English word \\"sister\\".Gould Lee 1956, p. 18.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 194 Growing up, Helen developed a special affection for Alexander, only three years her senior.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 19‚Äì20. Helen spent most of her childhood in the Greek capital. Every summer, the princess and her family, travelled to the Hellenic Mediterranean aboard the royal yacht Amphitrite or visited Sophia's mother, the Dowager Empress Victoria in Germany. From the age of 8, Helen began to spend part of the summer in Great Britain, in the regions of Seaford and Eastbourne.Gould Lee 1956, p. 21.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 83Van der Kiste 1994, p. 62. The princess grew up in an strongly anglophile environment, among a cohort of British tutors and governesses, including Miss Nichols, who took special care of her. =From the Goudi coup to the Balkan Wars= Artillery Major Nikolaos Zorbas, figurehead leader of the Goudi coup. Portrait by Spyridon Prosalentis. On 28 August 1909 a group of Greek officers, known as the \\"Military League,\\" organized a coup d'√©tat (called the Goudi coup) against the government of King George I, Helen's grandfather. While declaring to be monarchists, the League members, led by Nikolaos Zorbas, asked the king to dismiss his son from military posts.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 68‚Äì69. Officially, this was to protect the Diadochos from the jealousy that could stem from his friendship with some soldiers. But the reality was quite different: the officers blamed Constantine for the defeat of Greece against the Ottoman Empire during the Thirty Days' War of 1897. The situation was so tense that the sons of George I were finally forced to resign from their military posts to save their father from the shame of their being expelled.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 69‚Äì70. The Diadochos also decided to leave Greece with his wife and children. For several months, the family moved to the Schloss Friedrichshof at Kronberg in Germany. It was the first of many times that the 14-years-old Princess Helen would have to go into exile.Gould Lee 1956, p. 25. After much tension, the political situation eventually subsided in Greece and Constantine and his family were allowed to return to their homeland. In 1911, the Diadochos was restored in his military duties by the Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 70. A year later, the First Balkan War broke out, which allowed Greece to annex large territories in Macedonia, Epirus, Crete and the North Aegean. It was also at the end of this conflict that King George I was assassinated in Thessaloniki on 18 March 1913 and Helen's father succeeded him on the Hellenic throne as King Constantine I.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 72‚Äì75.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 26‚Äì28. After these events, Helen spent long weeks touring Greece, of which she previously only knew the main towns and the island of Corfu. With her father and brother Alexander, she travelled in Greek Macedonia and the various battlefields of the First Balkan War.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 31‚Äì32. However, this period of calm was short-lived as the Second Balkan War broke out in June 1913. Once again, Greece emerged victorious from the conflict, allowing it to significantly expand its territory,Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 78‚Äì79. which grew by 68% after the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest.John Grenville, The major international treaties of the twentieth century, London, Taylor & Francis 2001, 3rd edition, p. 50. =World War I= Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos During World War I, King Constantine I first sought to maintain Greece in a position of neutrality. He considered that his country was not yet ready to participate in a new conflict after the Balkan Wars. But, educated in Germany and linked to Emperor William II (who was his brother-in-law), Constantine I was quickly accused of supporting the Triple Alliance and wishing for the defeat of the Allies. The king quickly fell out with his Prime Minister Venizelos, who was convinced of the need to support the countries of the Triple Entente to fulfill the so-called Megali Idea. In October 1916, Venizelos, protected by the Entente countries, and in particular by the French Republic, formed a parallel government in Thessaloniki. Central Greece was occupied by the allied forces and the country was soon in the middle of a civil war, the so-called National Schism.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 89‚Äì101.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 35‚Äì42. Weakened by all these tensions, Constantine I became seriously ill in 1915. Suffering from pleurisy aggravated by a pneumonia, he remained in bed for several weeks and nearly died. In Greece, public opinion was affected by the rumor, spread by Venizelists, that the king was not sick but that Queen Sophia in fact injured him in the course of an argument where she tried to force him to fight alongside the emperor. The health of the sovereign declined so much, that a ship was sent to the Island of Tinos in order to seek the miraculous Icon of the Virgin and Child, which was supposed to heal the sick. After kissing the holy picture, the king partially recovered his health. But the situation remained worrying and the king was in need of surgery before he could reasume his duties.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 93.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, pp. 87‚Äì88. These events had a special impact on Princess Helen, who was very close to her father: impressed by his recovery, she developed a deep religiosity, a trait that she would retain throughout her life.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 37‚Äì39. Despite these difficulties, Constantine I refused to change his policies and was faced with the increasingly clear opposition of the Triple Entente and Venizelists. Thus, on 1 December 1916 the so-called Greek Vespers took place where the Allied soldiers fought against Greek reservists in Athens and the French fleet bombarded the Royal Palace.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 102‚Äì104. On this occasion, Helen was nearly killed by a gunfire from the Zappeion. After hearing the gunshots and worried for the life of her father, the princess ran to the gardens of the royal palace but was saved by the royal Garde du Corps which took her back inside the palace.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 49‚Äì50. Finally, on 10 June 1917, Charles Jonnart, the Allied High Commissioner in Greece, asked the king for his abdication.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 106. Under the threat of an invasion in Piraeus, the king agreed and went into exile, but without formally abdicating. The Allies did not wish to establish a Republic in Greece, so one of the members of the royal family had to stay and succeed him. Because the Diadochos George was also considered pro- German like his father, they wanted someone considered malleable, as a puppet ruler of Constantine I's enemies. Finally the younger brother of the Diadochos, Prince Alexander, was chosen by Venizelos and the Triple Entente as the new king.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 107.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 183.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 51‚Äì57. From exile to the Romanian wedding=Life in Switzerland= King Alexander I of Greece, c. 1917 On 11 June 1917 the Greek royal family secretly fled from their palace, surrounded by a loyalist mob that refused to see them go. In the days that followed, Constantine I, Queen Sophia and five of their children left Greece from the port of Oropos and took the road to exile.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 108‚Äì110. This was the last time that Helen saw her favorite brother. In fact, on their return to power, the Venizelists prohibited any contact between King Alexander I and the rest of the royal family.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 113 and 117. After crossing the Ionian Sea and Italy, Helen and her family settled in Switzerland, mainly among the cities of St. Moritz, Z√ºrich and Lucerne.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 115.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 90.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 58‚Äì64. In exile, Helen's parents were soon followed by almost all members of the royal family, who left their country with the return of Venizelos as Prime Minister and the entry of Greece to the war alongside the Triple Entente. However, the financial position of the royal family was precarious and Constantine I, haunted by a deep sense of failure, soon fell ill. In 1918, he contracted Spanish flu and again was close to death.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 115‚Äì116. Very concerned about the fate of their father, Helen and her sisters Irene and Katherine spent a long time with him to distract him from his worries. Helen also sought to reconnect with Alexander I. She tried to take advantage of the visit of her brother to Paris in 1919 to call him by phone. However, the officer who escorted the king in the French capital refused to pass along either her communications or those of other members of the royal family.Gould Lee 1956, p. 70.Gelardi 2006, pp. 292‚Äì293.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 117. =Meeting with Crown Prince Carol of Romania= Crown Prince Carol of Romania, c. 1915 In 1920, the Greek exiles were visited in Lucerne by Queen Marie of Romania (Sophia's first cousin) and her daughters Elisabeth, Maria and Ileana. Worried about the future of her eldest and still single son, the Diadochos George, who had already proposed to Princess Elisabeth a few years earlier, Queen Sophia was anxious for him to marry.Marcou 2002, p. 112 and 122. Homeless, penniless and without any real political value since his exclusion from the Greek throne in 1917, Helen's elder brother reiterated his request of marriage to Princess Elizabeth, who, despite her initial reticence, finally decided to accept.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 121‚Äì122.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 183 and 195. Pleased with the union, the Queen of Romania then invited her future son-in-law and his sisters Helen and Irene to go to Bucharest in order to publicly announce the royal engagement. The princesses accepted and the departure was set to 2 October. In the meanwhile, another member of the Romanian royal family arrived to Lucerne. This was Elisabeth's brother, the Crown Prince Carol, who had just completed a trip around the world which he had undertaken in order to forget his morganatic wife Zizi Lambrino and their son Carol.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 122.Marcou 2002, p. 115 and 117. In Romania George, Helen and Irene were received with pomp by the royal family. Housed at Peli»ôor Castle, they were a central part of the celebrations for the return of Crown Prince Carol to his country (10 October) and the announcement of the engagement of Elisabeth with the Diadochos (12 October). The stay of the Greek princes, however, was brief. On 24 October, a telegram arrived which announced the death in Zurich of the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who was the mother of the queen of Romania. The very next day, another message arrived informing the Greek princes that Alexander I had suddenly died in Athens, following a monkey bite.Marcou 2002, pp. 117‚Äì118Gould Lee 1956, pp. 73‚Äì74.Porter 2005, p. 9. Under these circumstances, the three Greek princes and Queen Marie of Romania decided to make an emergency return to Switzerland. Moved by the situation and probably pushed by his mother, Crown Prince Carol at the last moment decided to travel along with them. After being cold and distant to Helen during her stay at Romania, the crown prince suddenly turned very attentive to the princess. During the train journey, the two told their life stories to each other and Carol confided in Helen about his affair with Zizi Lambrino. Helen likewise told him of her life and of family matters, including her great grief for her brother Alexander's death and how she did not want to return to Greece now that her only real friend, her beloved brother, was dead. This opening of the hearts to each other had the result that Helen fell in love with the heir to the Romanian throne.Marcou 2002, pp. 117‚Äì119.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 196. =Restoration and marriage= The Greek royal family in 1921. From left to right: Princess Irene, Queen Sophia, King Constantine I, Crown Princess Princess Helen, Crown Prince Carol of Romania, and Prince Paul. Crown Princess Helen and Crown Prince Carol of Romania, 1921 Soon after their arrival in Switzerland, Crown Prince Carol asked for Helen's hand in marriage, much to the joy of the queen of Romania, but not to the princess' parents. Helen was determined to accept the marriage proposal, therefore King Constantine I assented to the engagement, but only after the marriage of Carol and Zizi Lambrino could be quickly dissolved. For her part, Queen Sophia was much less favorable to her daughter's wedding. Having no confidence in the Romanian crown prince, she tried to convince Helen to reject the proposal. However, Helen insisted, and despite the doubts of her mother, the engagement was announced in Z√ºrich in November 1920.Marcou 2002, p. 119 and 122‚Äì123.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 72‚Äì74.Gelardi 2006, pp. 296‚Äì298.Porter 2005, p. 10. Meanwhile, in Greece, the Venizelists lost the election in favor of Constantine I's supporters on 14 November 1920. Desiring to resolve the dynastic question, on 5 December the new cabinet organized a referendum, the disputed results of which showed that 99% of the population demanded the restoration of the sovereign.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 126‚Äì128. Under these conditions, the royal family returned to Athens and Helen was accompanied by her fianc√© on her return. For two months, the two traveled discovering inner Greece and its ancient ruins. They then went to Bucharest to attend the wedding of Diadochos George with Elisabeth of Romania (27 February 1921) before returning to Athens to celebrate their own wedding in the Metropolitan Cathedral on 10 March 1921.Marcou 2002, p. 125. Being the first Greek princess to marry in Athens,Gould Lee 1956, p. 83. Helen wore the Romanian 'Greek Key' tiara, a gift from her mother-in-law. The newlyweds then spent their honeymoon in Tatoi, where they remained for two months before returning to Romania, on 8 May 1921.Marcou 2002, p. 126.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 198.Gould Lee 1956, p. 84. Crown Princess of Romania=Installation in Bucharest= Helen, Crown Princess of Romania and her son Prince Michael, 1922 Upon her return to Romania, Helen was already pregnant. She spent some time with Carol at the Cotroceni Palace, where the pomp and protocol of the Court both impressed and bored her at the same time. The couple then took up residence at the Foi»ôor, an elegant Swiss-style chalet built in the surroundings of Pele»ô Castle, at Sinaia.Gould Lee 1956, p. 88. It was there that the crown princess gave birth after only seven and a half months after her wedding. Her only child, Prince Michael, named in honor to Michael the Brave, the first unifier of the Danubian Principalities, was born on 25 October 1921; the childbirth was difficult and required surgery. The ordeal significantly weakened Helen, and the doctors forbade her from having a second pregnancy.Gould Lee 1956, p. 91Pakula 1996, pp. 311‚Äì312 Once the crown princess had recovered, in December 1921 the couple moved to Bucharest, in a large villa at the »òoseaua Kiseleff.Gould Lee 1956, p. 92. Despite their significantly different points of interest, Carol and Helen managed, for some time, to lead a bourgeois and happy existence. In the mornings, the heir performed his official duties and in the afternoons, they enjoyed their favorite past times. While the crown prince engaged in reading and his stamp collections, Helen spent her time engaged in horseback riding or on the decoration of their residences.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 199.Pakula 1996, p. 310. The crown princess was very involved in social work and founded a nursing school in the capital. She was also appointed an Honorary Colonel of the 9th Cavalry Regiment, the Ro»ôiori.Gould Lee 1956, p. 99. =Reunion with family= King Alexander I of Yugoslavia Queen Maria of Yugoslavia, born princess of Romania In the meantime, the political situation was deteriorating in Greece. The Hellenic Kingdom endured a period of unrest during the Greco- Turkish War, and by 1919 the health of King Constantine I was deteriorating once again. Worried about the future of her father, Helen asked for her husband's permission to return to Greece. The couple and their child thus left for Athens at the end of January 1922. But while Carol left Greece in February to attend the betrothal of his sister Maria to King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, Helen remained with her parents until April, when she returned to Romania, bringing her sister Irene. By that time, the crown prince had resumed his affair with his former mistress, the actress Mirella Marcovici.Porter 2005, pp. 12‚Äì13. In June 1922, Carol and Helen went to Belgrade with the whole Romanian royal family to attend the wedding of Alexander I and Maria.Marcou 2002, p. 127. Back in Bucharest, the crown princess then resumed her role as wife of the heir to the throne. She participated in official acts and supported the sovereign and her husband during ceremonies that punctuated the life of the monarchy. Like many women of her rank, Helen was also interested in social works. Nevertheless, she continued to be worried for her family, and even visited her sister Irene, her aunt Maria and her Greek cousins in an futile attempt to console herself about the remoteness of her parents. In September 1922, a military coup forced King Constantine I to abdicate in favor of his son George II, and to go into exile. Without any real power and dominated by the revolutionaries, after a failed coup of a pro-royalist group (the so-called Leonardopoulos‚ÄìGargalidis coup d'√©tat) in October 1923, the new sovereign in turn was forced to abdicate after only fifteen months of reign. Devastated by these events, Helen immediately went to Italy to be with her parents in their exile. Shortly after the coronation of King Ferdinand I and Queen Marie of Romania in Alba Iulia on 15 October 1922, Helen left for Palermo, where she remained until the death of her father, on 11 January 1923.Marcou 2002, p. 128.Porter 2005, pp. 13‚Äì14. Bored by the absence of his wife, Carol finally invited his mother-in-law to stay in Bucharest. However, the dowager queen did not arrive alone: with her, and without warning, came no fewer than 15 Greek princes and princesses, to his home. Increasingly irritated by the invasive presence of his wife's family, Carol also was hurt by Helen's attitude because she refused to fulfil her marital duties. Jealous, the crown prince suspected that his wife had begun an affair with the charming Prince Amedeo of Savoy, Duke of Aosta, a regular guest of the Greek royal couple in Sicily. It was due to these circumstances that Helen and Carol began their separation, though the crown princess saved appearances by devoting more time to the education of her son, Prince Michael.Marcou 2002, pp. 129‚Äì130. =Abandonment of Crown Prince Carol= Crown Prince Carol of Romania and Magda Lupescu In the summer of 1924, Carol met Elena Lupescu (better known under the name of \\"Magda\\" Lupescu), with whom he began an affair in or around 14 February 1925.Marcou 2002, p. 134. This was not the first extramarital relationship of the crown prince since his marriage. However, for Carol, this time there was a serious bond, a fact that would soon worry not only Helen (always of a conciliatory and tolerant disposition with her husband's infidelities) but also the rest of the Romanian royal family, which feared that Lupescu could turn into a new Zizi Lambrino.Marcou 2002, pp. 138‚Äì139. In November 1925, Carol was sent to the United Kingdom to represent the royal family at the funeral of the Dowager Queen Alexandra. Despite several promises made to his father, King Ferdinand I, he took advantage of traveling abroad to find his mistress and openly live out their relationship.Marcou 2002, pp. 139‚Äì140.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, pp. 199‚Äì200. Refusing to return to Bucharest, Carol finally officially renounced the throne and prerogatives as crown prince on 28 December 1925.Marcou 2002, p. 141.Porter 2005, pp. 17‚Äì18. In Romania, Helen was distraught by Carol's attitude,Marcou 2002, p. 142.Pakula 1996, p. 335. especially as Queen Marie made her partly responsible for the failure of her marriage.Marcou 2002, p. 138. The crown princess wrote to her husband to convince him to return.Marcou 2002, pp. 142‚Äì143.Porter 2005, p. 19 and 20. She also attempted to convince politicians to delay Carol's exclusion to the royal succession and proposed to her in-laws that she herself take a trip to meet with her husband. However, the Prime Minister Ion BrƒÉtianu, who despised the crown prince because of his sympathy to the National Peasants' Party, categorically opposed. The head of government even accelerated the exclusion procedures by summoning both Houses of the Parliament to register the act of renunciation and appoint little Prince Michael as the new heir to the throne.Marcou 2002, pp. 143‚Äì145.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 112‚Äì113. On 4 January 1926, the Romanian Parliament ratified the acceptance of Carol's renunciation and a royal ordinance was issued giving Helen the title princess of Romania;\\"Prince Charles's Renunciation\\", The Times (5 January 1926): 11. in addition, she was included in the Civil list, a privilege previously reserved to the sovereign and the heir to the throne.Gould Lee 1956, p. 115. After King Ferdinand I was diagnosed with cancer, a Regency Council was also formed during Michael's minority with Prince Nicholas as the Head, assisted by Patriarch Miron and the magistrate Gheorghe Buzdugan, replaced after his death in 1929 by Constantine SƒÉrƒÉ»õeanu.Marcou 2002, pp. 156‚Äì157. Despite this, Helen continued to hope for the return of her husband and obstinately refused requests for a divorce that he sent to her from abroad.Porter 2005, p. 21.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 200. In June 1926, shortly before the death of her father-in-law, Helen went to Italy to attend the funeral of her paternal grandmother, Dowager Queen Olga of Greece, and moved with her mother to the Villa Bobolina in Fiesole. The princess took advantage of her stay in Italy and to try to arrange for an encounter with her husband but, having initially accepted to see her, Carol canceled the meeting at the last minute.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 115‚Äì116. First reign of Michael I and Italian exile=Crown Princess of Romania= In the spring of 1927, Queen Marie made an official visit to the United States. During her absence, Helen and her sister-in-law Elisabeth took of care of King Ferdinand I, whose health declined rapidly. The king died on 20 July 1927 at Pele»ô Castle and his 5-year-old grandson succeeded him under the name of Michael I while the Regency Council took over the direction of the country.Marcou 2002, p. 159.Gould Lee 1956, p. 117. However, in Romania, Carol retained many supporters (soon nicknamed \\"Carlists\\") and the National Liberal Party began to fear the return of the Prince.Marcou 2002, pp. 161‚Äì162. After trying to convince her husband to go to Bucharest, Helen gradually changed her attitude towards him. Anxious to preserve the rights of her son and probably convinced by Prime Minister Barbu »òtirbey, the princess requested a divorce, which she easily obtained. On 21 June 1928, the marriage was dissolved by the Romanian Supreme Court on the grounds of incompatibility.Marcou 2002, pp. 170‚Äì171.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 119‚Äì121.\\"Prince Carol, Divorce Proceedings in Rumania\\", The Times (9 June 1928): 14. Helen also distanced herself from her mother-in-law, who complained of being separated from the young king and criticized more openly the Greek entourage of the Princess.Marcou 2002, pp. 174‚Äì175.Porter 2005, p. 27.Pakula 1996, pp. 367‚Äì368. Under these circumstances, the dowager queen approached her eldest son and built ties with the Carlist movement. After the Regency Council failed to govern the country, Carol appeared increasingly as a providential man who could solve the problems of Romania. Still, his supporters (as Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants' Party) continued to demand his separation from Magda Lupescu and his reconciliation with Helen, which he refused.Marcou 2002, pp. 176‚Äì178 Thanks to his many supporters in the country, the prince finally organized his return to Bucharest on the night of 6‚Äì7 June 1930. Joyfully welcomed by the population and the political class, he then proclaimed himself king under the name of Carol II.Marcou 2002, pp. 184‚Äì185.Porter 2005, pp. 28‚Äì31. =Impossible reconciliation with Carol II= King Carol II of Romania, 1930 When he came to power, Carol II initially refused to see Helen though he expressed his desire to meet his son,Marcou 2002, p. 190. demoted to the rank of heir-apparent to the throne with the title of Grand Voivod of Alba Iulia by the Romanian Parliament (8 June 1930). In order to be reunited with Michael, the king therefore resolved to meet to his former wife. Accompanied by his brother Nicholas and his sister Elizabeth, he visited the princess in her villa in the »òoseaua Kiseleff. At the sight of her former husband, Helen showed coldness but she had no other alternative than to offer him her friendship for the sake of their child.Marcou 2002, p. 185.Porter 2005, pp. 31‚Äì32. In the following weeks, Helen suffered the combined pressures of politicians and the Romanian Orthodox Church, who were trying to persuade her to reasume her conjugal life with Carol II and accept to be crowned along with him at a ceremony in Alba Iulia, scheduled on 21 September 1930. Despite her reluctance, the princess agreed to a reconciliation and reconsidered the annulment of her divorce, but under the condition of having a separate residence. These were the circumstances under which the former spouses lived and while Carol II sometimes went to Helen for lunch with her, the princess would, from time to time, have tea with him in the royal palace. In July, the king, his former wife and son traveled together in Sinaia but while Carol II moved to Foi»ôor, Helen and Michael stayed at Pele»ô Castle. Each day, the family gathered for tea and, on 20 July, Carol II and Helen appeared publicly together on the occasion of a ceremony in memory of King Ferdinand I.Marcou 2002, pp. 191‚Äì192.Gould Lee 1956, p. 139. In August 1930, the government presented a decree to Carol II for his signature officially confirming Helen as Her Majesty, the Queen of Romania. The king, however, crossed this out and declared Helen to be Her Majesty Helen (i.e. with the style Majesty, but not the title Queen). Helen refused to allow anyone to use this style in her presence. Due to these circumstances, the proposed coronation of the two former spouses was postponed.Marcou 2002, p. 192.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 139‚Äì141. The return of Magda Lupescu to Romania finally put an end to the reconciliation efforts of the pair.Gould Lee 1956, p. 147. Soon the king was able to get Michael moved to his side, and Helen was allowed to see her son every day in exchange for her political silence. Increasingly isolated,Gould Lee 1956, p. 149 and 164‚Äì165.Porter 2005, pp. 34‚Äì37. the princess was forced into exile by her former husband, she concented to a separation agreement in October 1931.\\"Princess Helen of Rumania, Settlement Signed\\", The Times (2 November 1932): 11. In exchange for her silence, and through the mediation of her brother, the former King George II of Greece, and her sister-in-law Elisabeth, Helen then obtained a substantial monetary compensation. With the approval of Carol II, she obtained the right to stay four months a year in Romania and to receive her son abroad during two months of the year. She retained her residence in Bucharest and the king agreed to fund his maintenance during his absence. Especially, Helen received a sum of thirty million lei to buy a home abroad and in addition she obtained an annual pension of seven million lei.Marcou 2002, pp. 192‚Äì193.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 166‚Äì167. =Between scandal and exile= Villa Sparta, in Fiesole, where Helen lived more than 30 years In November 1931, Helen left Romania for Germany, where she went to the bedside of her mother, the Dowager Queen Sophia of Greece, seriously ill with cancer. After her death on 13 January 1932, Helen bought her house in Fiesole, Tuscany, which she used as her main residence.Marcou 2002, p. 193.Van der Kiste 1994, pp. 149‚Äì151.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 92. In this large house, that she renamed Villa Sparta, the princess received the visit of her sisters Irene and Katherine and her brother Paul, who remained with Helen on long stays.Gould Lee 1956, p. 169.Van der Kiste 1994, p. 151. Princess Helen and her son Crown Prince Michael during their visit in London, 1932 Despite the distance, the friction between Helen and Carol II continued. In September 1932, a visit from Michael and his mother to the United Kingdom was used by Helen as an opportunity for a new, very public conflict, which soon made the headlines of the international press, just as Helen wanted. The king wanted the crown prince not to wear shorts in public, and that he not be photographed in the company of his mother. Helen was incensed at the second stipulation and, as was her wont, took the trouble to aggravate the situation by defying the first stipulation as well. She made sure her son was dressed in shorts and posed for the cameras with him at her side for an extended photo opportunity. After seeing the spectacle of the crown prince in shorts published in the newspapers, the king demanded that the heir to the throne be brought back to Bucharest. Helen now decided to grant an interview to the Daily Mail \\"in the hope,\\" she said, \\"that public opinion would help to preserve her parental rights\\". This was followed by a violent press campaign, which enraged the king. Despite these events, Helen chose to return to Romania for Michael's birthday and threatened to go to the International Court of Justice if Carol II did not allow her to see their son.Porter 2005, pp. 39‚Äì40.Pakula 1996, p. 391. Back in Bucharest, the princess tried, without much success, to get the government involved in a case against the king. She then turned again to her sister-in-law, the former queen of the Hellenes. However, the latter was deeply shocked by the interview given to the Daily Mail, and the two women had a violent fight during their reunion, where Elisabeth even slapped Helen. Carol II then considered his former wife as a political opponent, and in order to undermine her prestige, the king initiated a campaign in the press against her, claiming that she had tried to commit suicide twice.Gould Lee 1956, pp. 164‚Äì165. After only a month in the country, Carol II imposed a new separation agreement (1 November 1932), under which Helen was denied the right to return to Romania and the next day, finally forced her into permanent exile in Italy.Marcou 2002, pp. 193‚Äì194.Porter 2005, pp. 40‚Äì41. During the following years, she had no contact with her former husband, who only briefly told her by telephone of the death of Queen Marie in 1938.Marcou 2002, p. 252. Despite the tensions, Prince Michael was able to see his mother every year in Florence for two months.Porter 2005, p. 41. In Fiesole, the life of Helen and her sisters was relatively retired, even though they were frequently visited by the Italian House of Savoy, which had always been welcoming to the Greek royal family during its exile.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 205. The Greek princesses also used their connections to find a wife for Diadochos Paul, who remained single. In 1935, they took advantage of the presence in Florence of Princess Frederica of Hanover to arrange an encounter between her and their brother. Their good efforts paid off and Frederica quickly fell in love with the Diadochos. However, the princess' parents were reluctant to approve this relationship and it was not until 1937 that Paul and Frederica were finally allowed to get engaged.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, pp. 99‚Äì102. In the meanwhile, the Greek monarchy was restored and George II once again became King of Greece,Van der Kiste 1994, p. 154. but his wife Elisabeth, who filed for divorce on 6 July 1935, remained in Romania.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 187. Queen Mother of Romania=World War II and the dictatorship of Antonescu= Standard of the queen mother of Romania (1941‚Äì1947) In Tuscany, Helen found real stability, despite the absence of her son most of the year. However, the outbreak of World War II again disrupted her daily routine.Porter 2005, p. 61. In accordance with the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union forced Romania to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to them on 26 June 1940, and a few weeks later, the country was also forced to surrender Northern Transylvania to Hungary (Second Vienna Award, 30 August 1940) and the Southern Dobruja to Bulgaria (Treaty of Craiova, 7 September 1940); these territorial losses ended the Greater Romania, created at the end of World War I. Unable to maintain the territorial integrity of his country and under pressure from the Iron Guard, a fascist party supported by Nazi Germany, Carol II became increasingly unpopular and finally was forced to abdicate on 6 September 1940. His son Michael, aged 18, became king while General Ion Antonescu established a dictatorship with the support of members of the Iron Guard.Marcou 2002, pp. 285‚Äì296.Porter 2005, pp. 54‚Äì59. Eager to obtain the favor of the new sovereign (and some legitimation to his dictatorship), Antonescu granted Helen the title of \\"Queen Mother of Romania\\" (Regina-mamƒÉ Elena) with the style \\"Her Majesty\\" on 8 September 1940 and sent the diplomat Raoul Bossy to Fiesole to persuade her to return to Bucharest (12 September 1940).Marcou 2002, pp. 300‚Äì301.Porter 2005, pp. 61‚Äì62. Back in Romania (14 September 1940), Helen found herself, however, subject to the whim of the dictator, determined to keep the royal family in a purely ceremonial role.Porter 2005, pp. 62‚Äì63.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 201. Indeed, in the years that followed, Antonescu systematically excluded the king and his mother from political responsibilityPorter 2005, pp. 63‚Äì64. and didn't even bother to warn them of his decision to declare war on the Soviet Union in June 1941.Porter 2005, p. 70‚Äì71. In this difficult context, Michael I was at times prone to bouts of depression and Helen then concentrated all of her efforts to make him more active. Aware of his shortcomings, the queen mother appealed to historians of the right to train her son in his role as sovereign. She also guided the king in his talks and pushed him to oppose Antonescu when she deemed that his policies endangered the crown.Porter 2005, pp. 64‚Äì65. Alerted about the anti- Jewish persecutions by the Rabbi Alexandru »òafran, Helen personally appealed to the German ambassador Manfred Freiherr von Killinger and Antonescu to convince them to halt the deportations, being supported in her efforts by Patriarch Nicodim. For his part, the king vigorously protested to the ConducƒÉtor at the time of the Odessa massacre and notably obtained the release of Wilhelm Filderman, president of the Romanian Jewish community.Porter 2005, pp. 74‚Äì75.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, pp. 480‚Äì481. Despite these few attempts of emancipation, Helen and her son spent most of the conflict playing as hosts of the German officers passing through Bucharest.Porter 2005, p. 70 and 74. The queen mother even met Hitler twice: firstly informally, with her sister Irene, to discuss the fate of Greece and Romania within the new Europe (December 1940)Porter 2005, p. 66 and 67. and secondly formally with Michael I during a trip in Italy (winter of 1941).Porter 2005, pp. 75‚Äì76. Above all, Helen and her son had no choice but to officially support the dictatorship of Antonescu. Thus, it was Michael I who gave the ConducƒÉtor the title of Marshal (21 August 1941) after the reconquest of Bessarabia by the Romanian Army.Porter 2005, p. 72. In the fall of 1942, Helen played a major role in stopping Antonescu from his plans to deport all of the Jews of the Regat to the German death camp of Be≈Ç≈ºec in Poland. According to SS Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Gustav Richter, the counselor for Jewish Affairs at the German legation in Bucharest in a report sent to Berlin on 30 October 1942: > \\"The queen mother told the king that what was happening...was a disgrace and > that she could not bear it any longer, all the more so because [their names] > would be permanently associated...with the crimes committed against the > Jews, while she would be known as the mother of \\"Michael the Wicked\\". She is > said to have warned the king that, if the deportations were not immediately > halted, she would leave the country. As a result the King...telephoned Prime > Minister Ion Antonescu and...a meeting of the Council of Ministers took > place.\\"Deletant, Denis, Review of The History of the Holocaust in Romania by > Jean Ancel pp. 502‚Äì506 from Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Vol. 27, Issue > 3, August 2013, p. 505. =Coup of Michael I and end of the war= From 1941, the participation of the Romanian army in the invasion of the Soviet Union further damaged the relations between Antonescu and the royal family, who disapproved of the conquests of Odessa and Ukraine.Porter 2005, p. 73. However, it was the Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 ‚Äì 2 February 1943) and the losses incurred by the Romanian side that finally forced Michael I to organize around him a resistance against the dictatorship of the ConducƒÉtor.Porter 2005, p. 80. During an official speech on 1 January 1943, the sovereign publicly condemned the participation of Romania in the war against the Soviet Union, triggering the wrath of both Antonescu and the Nazi Germany, who accused Helen of being behind the royal initiative.Porter 2005, pp. 81‚Äì82. In retaliation, Antonescu tightened his control over Michael I and his mother, and threatened the royal family with the abolition of the monarchy if any further provocation were to occur.Porter 2005, p. 84. King Michael I of Romania, c. 1940 Over the next few months, the suspicious death of Tsar Boris III of Bulgaria (28 August 1943) and the successive arrests of princesses Mafalda of Savoy (23 September 1943) and Irene of Greece (October 1943) after the overthrow of Mussolini by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy (25 July 1943), proved to Michael I and his mother just how dangerous opposition to the Axis powers was.Porter 2005, p. 86 and 134. The return of the Soviets in BessarabiaPorter 2005, p. 91. and the American bombing over BucharestPorter 2005, p. 93. forced the king, despite everything, to break with the regime of Antonescu. On 23 August 1944 Michael I organized a coup d'√©tat against the ConducƒÉtor, who was imprisoned.Porter 2005, pp. 108‚Äì110.Marcou 2002, p. 334. In the process, the king and his new government declared war on the Axis powers and asked the Romanian forces not to resist the Red Army, which nevertheless continued its invasion into the country.Porter 2005, p. 111 and 118‚Äì120. In retaliation against this betrayal, the Luftflotte bombed Bucharest and Casa NouƒÉ, the main residence of the sovereign and his mother since 1940, which was largely destroyed (24 August 1944).Porter 2005, p. 63 and 120. Nevertheless, the Romanian forces gradually managed to push the Germans out of the country and also attacked Hungary in order to liberate Transylvania (Siege of Budapest, 29 December 1944 ‚Äì 13 February 1945).Porter 2005, pp. 118‚Äì120. However, the Allies did not immediately recognize the reversal of Romania and the Soviets entered the capital on 31 August 31, 1944.Porter 2005, pp. 118‚Äì123. An armistice was finally signed with Moscow on 12 September 1944, which forced the kingdom to accept the Soviet occupation.Porter 2005, pp. 125‚Äì126. A climate of uncertainty swept the country while the Red Army increased their demands.Porter 2005, pp. 126‚Äì127. Visiting Sinaia at the time of the royal coup d'√©tat,Porter 2005, pp. 114‚Äì115. Helen found her son the next day at Craiova.Porter 2005, p. 120. Back in Bucharest on 10 September 1944,Porter 2005, p. 123. the king and his mother moved into the residence of Princess Elizabeth, whose relations with Helen remained tensePorter 2005, p. 126. despite their reconciliation in 1940.Porter 2005, pp. 65‚Äì66. With the increased instability in Romania, the queen mother was extremely concerned about the safety of her son, fearing that he could eventually be killed,Porter 2005, p. 130, 132, 137 and 140. like Prince-Regent Kiril of Bulgaria, shot by the Communists on 1 February 1945.Porter 2005, p. 137. The queen mother also disapproved of the influence of Ioan St√¢rcea over the sovereign and, following information from one of the palace servants, accused him of espionage on behalf of Antonescu.Porter 2005, p. 121 and 126. She was also concerned about the machinations of Carol II, who apparently waited for the end of the war to return to Romania,Porter 2005, p. 130. and observed with anxiety the political crisis that prevented King George II from regaining power in Greece.Porter 2005, p. 128. In this difficult context, Helen had the joy of learning that her sister Irene and her little nephew Amedeo were alive, although still in German hands.Porter 2005, p. 134. Despite these political and personal concerns, the queen mother continued her charitable activities. She provided support to Romanian hospitals, and managed to save some of the equipment of the Red Army requisitions. On 6 November 1944 she inaugurated a soup kitchen in the ballroom of the Royal Palace, which served not less than 11,000 meals to children in the capital over the next three months. Finally, despite Moscow's opposition, the queen mother sent aid to Moldavia, where a terrible epidemic of typhus was raging.Porter 2005, p. 130, 132‚Äì133 and 166. =Imposition of a communist regime= Prime Minister Petru Groza With the Soviet occupation, the staff of the Romanian Communist Party, which counted only a few thousand of members during the coup of Michael I, exploded and demonstrations against the government of Constantin SƒÉnƒÉtescu multiplied. At the same time, acts of sabotage were occurring all over the country, preventing the Romanian economy from recovering.Porter 2005, p. 127. Faced with the combined pressures of the representative of the Soviet Union, Andrey Vyshinsky, and the People's Democratic Front (offshoot of the Communist Party), the king needed to build a new government and named Nicolae RƒÉdescu as the new Prime Minister (7 December 1944).Porter 2005, pp. 129‚Äì134. Nevertheless, the situation remained tense in the country and when the new head of the government called for municipal elections on 15 March 1945,Porter 2005, p. 135. the Soviet Union resumed its destabilizing operations in order to impose a government of their liking.Porter 2005, pp. 135‚Äì141. The refusal of the United States and United Kingdom to intervene on his behalfPorter 2005, p. 132. led the sovereign to consider abdication but he abandoned the idea on the advice of representatives of the two major democratic political forces, Dinu BrƒÉtianu and Iuliu Maniu.Porter 2005, pp. 140‚Äì141. On 6 March 1945 Michael I finally called Petru Groza, leader of the Ploughmen's Front, as the new head of a government which had no association with any representative of either the Peasants and the Liberal parties.Porter 2005, p. 141. Satisfied with this appointment, the Soviet authorities were more conciliatory with Romania. On 13 March 1945 Moscow transferred the administration of Transylvania to Bucharest.Porter 2005, p. 142. A few months later, on 19 July 1945, Michael I was decorated with the Order of Victory, one of the most prestigious Soviet military orders.Porter 2005, pp. 144‚Äì145. Still, the Sovietization of the kingdom was accelerated. The purge of \\"fascist\\" personalities continued while censorship was strengthened. A land reform was also implemented, causing a drop in production which ruined agricultural exports. The king, however, managed to temporarily prevent the establishment of People's Tribunals and the restoration of the death penalty.Porter 2005, pp. 142‚Äì143. After the Potsdam Conference and the reaffirmation by the Allies of the need to establish democratically elected governments in Europe, Michael I demanded the resignation of Petru Groza, who refused.Porter 2005, p. 147. Faced with this insubordination, the sovereign began a \\"royal strike\\" on 23 August 1945 during which he refused to countersign the acts of the government. With his mother, he locked himself in the Elisabeta Palace for six weeks before departing to Sinaia.Porter 2005, p. 148. The resistance of the monarch, however, was not supported by the West, who after the Moscow Conference of 25 December 1945, asked Romania to allow two opposition figures to enter the government.Porter 2005, pp. 153‚Äì154. Disappointed by the lack of courage of London and Washington,Porter 2005, p. 154. the sovereign was shocked by the attitudes of Princesses Elisabeth and Ileana, who openly supported the communist authorities.Porter 2005, p. 152, 155 and 161. Disgusted by all these betrayals, Helen, in turn, encouraged fewer meetings with Soviet officials and worried every day for the life of her son.Porter 2005, pp. 156‚Äì157. The year 1946 was marked by the strengthening of the Communist dictatorship, despite active resistance of the sovereign.Porter 2005, pp. 160‚Äì161. After several months of waiting, the parliamentary elections were held on 19 November 1946 and were officially won by the Ploughmen's Front.Porter 2005, p. 162. After that date, the situation of the king and his mother became more precarious. In their palace, they had no access to running water for three hours a day and the electricity was off most of the day. This did not prevent Helen from maintaining her charitable activities and continuing to send food and clothing to Moldavia. In early 1947, the queen mother also obtained permission to travel abroad to visit her family. She then reunited with her sister Irene, weakened after her deportation to Austria, attended the funeral of her elder brother, King George II, and participated in the marriage of her youngest sister, Princess Katherine, with British Major Richard Brandram.Porter 2005, p. 166. The signing of the Paris Peace Treaties, on 10 February 1947, marked a new stage in the sidelining of the royal family by the Communist regime.Porter 2005, p. 164 and 168. Deprived of any official duties, the king was found even more isolated than during the \\"royal strike\\". Under these conditions, the queen mother considered exile with more determination but she was concerned that they did not possess any foreign resources, because her son refused to save money outside of Romania.Porter 2005, p. 168. As guests to the marriage of Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom with Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark (Helen's first-cousin) on 20 November 1947,Royal Collection: Seating plan for the Ball Supper Room [retrieved 13 July 2016]. Michael I and his mother were provided with an opportunity to travel together abroad. During this stay, the king fell in love with Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma, with whom he became engaged much to Helen's delight.Marcou 2002, pp. 352‚Äì353.Porter 2005, pp. 170‚Äì175 This trip was also an opportunity for the queen mother to place two small paintings of El Greco from the royal collections in a Swiss bank. Abolition of the Romanian monarchy and Michael I's wedding=Deposition of Michael I and the first months of exile= Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej King Michael I at the time of his abdication, 1947 Despite the advice of their relatives, who urged them not to return to Romania in order to escape the communists,Marcou 2002, p. 353.Porter 2005, pp. 172‚Äì173. the king and his mother returned to Bucharest on 21 December 1947. They were coldly greeted by the government, which secretly hoped to see them stay abroad in order to abolish the monarchy.Porter 2005, p. 177. Their plan did not work, so Prime Minister Petru Groza and General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej decided to compel the sovereign to abdicate. On 30 December 1947 they asked for an audience with the king, who received them along with his mother. The two politicians asked Michael I to sign a declaration of abdication. The king refused, stating that, for such a thing, the Romanian population must be consulted. The two men threatened that if he persisted, over 1000 students arrested would be executed in retaliation. Thousands of people, including many students, were arrested in November 1946, after clashes with the Communist forces. The pro-democracy and freedom population defeated the Communist forces which were sent to the protests by the Communist government, but in return, many protesters were arrested by Communist authorities, with the help of the Red Army. The heavy clashes ensued in Bucharest and other big cities in Romania after the Communist Party falsified the votes for the 1946 Parliament elections, which the National Peasant's Party (PN»ö) had won with over 70%. Forced with this blackmail, Michael I renounced the crown. Only hours after the announcement, the Romanian People's Republic was proclaimed.Marcou 2002, p. 354.Porter 2005, pp. 178‚Äì185. Michael I and Helen left Romania with some partisans on 3 January 1948.Porter 2005, pp. 186‚Äì189. Despite their close links with the Communists, Princesses Elisabeth and Ileana were also forced to leave the country a few days later, on 12 January.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, pp. 192‚Äì193 and 202.Besse 2010, pp. 131‚Äì132. In exile, Michael I and Helen settled for some time in Switzerland, where the deposed sovereign bitterly observed the Western acceptance of the establishment of a communist republic in Romania.Porter 2005, p. 192. For her part, Helen was mostly concerned with the state of their finances because the Communists allowed them to part with almost nothing.Porter 2005, p. 195. Despite their promises, the new Romanian authorities nationalized the properties of the former royal family (20 February 1948) and deprived the former monarch and his relatives of their nationality (17 May 1948).Porter 2005, p. 201. At the same time, the king and his mother had to deal with the intrigues of Carol II, who still considered himself the only legitimate sovereign of Romania and accused his ex-wife of keeping him away from their son. To achieve his ends, Carol II did not hesitate to involve Frederick, Prince of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen (Head of the dynasty) and Prince Nicholas of Romania in his intrigues.Porter 2005, p. 193 and 195.Marcou 2002, p. 353‚Äì355 and 366. These concerns did not prevent Michael I and his mother from undertaking several political trips to the United Kingdom, France and the United States to meet with government leaders and representatives of the Romanian diaspora.Porter 2005, pp. 193‚Äì198. =Marriage of Michael I and Anne of Bourbon-Parma= Former king Michael I and Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma at their wedding, 1948 Another source of concern from Michael I and his mother during their first months of exile was his marriage with Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma. To discredit the former monarch, the Romanian authorities promoted rumors that Michael I gave up his dynastic rights in order to marry the woman of his heart, as his father did in 1925. Added to this, the most serious difficulties were related to religion. Being a Roman Catholic, Princess Anne had to obtain a papal dispensation to marry an Orthodox. However, the Vatican had been extremely reluctant to grant consent because, for dynastic reasons, the couple's children would have to be raised in Michael I's religion. After Prince Ren√© of Bourbon-Parma, father of the bride, failed in his negotiations with the Vatican, Helen decided to go to Rome with Princess Margaret of Denmark (Anne's mother) to meet Pope Pius XII. However, the meeting ended badly and the Pope refused to agree to the marriage. Under these circumstances, Princess Anne had no choice but to override the pontifical will and abandon a Catholic marriage.Porter 2005, pp. 198‚Äì199. In doing so, she incurred the wrath of her uncle, Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma, who forbade the members of his family to attend the royal wedding under threat of being excluded from the House of Bourbon-Parma. Once again, the queen mother tried to mediate, this time with Anne's family, but without success.Porter 2005, pp. 199‚Äì200. Helen had better luck with her own family. Her brother, King Paul I of Greece, offered to organize Michael's wedding in Athens, despite official protests from the Romanian government.Porter 2005, p. 199. The wedding was finally celebrated in the Greek capital on 10 June 1948 with Archbishop Damaskinos himself officiating the ceremony. Celebrated in the throne room of the Royal Palace, the wedding brought together most of the members of the Greek dynasty but no representative of the Houses of Bourbon-Parma or Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. In fact, Carol II was not invited to the wedding, despite Helen having written to him about the marriage.Porter 2005, p. 200‚Äì201.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, pp. 122‚Äì123 and 419. Exile and later years=Return to Villa Sparta= After the marriage of Michael I and Anne, Helen returned to Villa Sparta in Fiesole. Through 1951, she hosted her son and his family,Porter 2005, pp. 202‚Äì211. who visited with her at least twice a year.Porter 2005, p. 227. Over the years, the family of the former king grew with the successive births of princesses Margareta (1949), Elena (1950), Irina (1953), Sophie (1957) and Maria (1964).Porter 2005, p. 204, 207, 213, 221 and 223. From 1949 to 1950, Helen also housed her sister Irene and her nephew Amedeo, who later settled in a neighboring residence.Porter 2005, pp. 206‚Äì207. Over the years, the two Greek princesses retained a strong bond, which ended with the death of the duchess of Aosta in 1974.Porter 2005, p. 229.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, pp. 202‚Äì203 and 212. Throughout her life, Helen also remained deeply attached to Amedeo and his first wife, Princess Claude of Orl√©ans. Helen also made many trips abroad to visit her relatives. She traveled regularly to the United Kingdom to see her granddaughters, who were schooling there. Despite her sometimes stormy relationship with her sister-in-law, Queen Frederica, Helen also spent long periods in Greece and participated in the cruise of the Kings (1954), the marriage of Princess Sophia with the future King Juan Carlos I of Spain (1962) and the events organized to mark the centenary of the Greek dynasty (1963).Porter 2005, p. 221, 222 and 223.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 143 and 155. King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, 1962 Head of a Madonna engraved with a dentist's drill by the princess Elena of Greece on an ivory billiard ball. Signed \\"E 1944\\". This is a gift to the painter Leonardo Cominotto from the princess herself. Sinaia, Romania ‚Äì 1945. Despite this, Helen's life was not solely devoted to her family. Passionate about Renaissance architecture and painting, she spent much of her time visiting monuments and museums. She also dedicated herself to creating artistic objects, for example an engraving made with a dentist's drill on an ivory billiard ball. A gardening enthusiast, she devoted long hours to the flowers and shrubs of her residence. A regular guest of the British Consulate, she also frequented the intellectuals who, like Harold Acton, had settled in the region of Florence. From 1968 to 1973, Helen had a romantic relationship with the twice-widower King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, with whom she shared a love of art and plants. At one point, the Scandinavian sovereign asked her to marry him, but she refused.Porter 2005, p. 227 and 229. In 1956 Helen consented for Arthur Gould Lee to publish her biography.Mateos Sainz de Medrano 2004, p. 203. At this point, her life was marked by financial difficulties which continued to worsen over time. Despite still being deprived of income by the Romanian authorities, the queen mother economically supported her son,Porter 2005, p. 212, 222, 223, 225 and 229‚Äì230. and also helped him to find jobs, first as a pilot in Switzerland,Porter 2005, p. 217. then as a broker on Wall Street.Porter 2005, p. 222. Helen also supported the studies of her eldest granddaughter Margareta, and even welcomed her at Villa Sparta for a year before she entered a British university.Porter 2005, p. 225 and 227. To do this, Helen was forced to sell her assets one by one and in the early 1970s, she hardly had anything left. In 1973, she mortgaged her residence and three years later, she sold the two Greco paintings that she had brought with her from Romania in 1947.Porter 2005, pp. 229‚Äì230. =Life in Switzerland and death= Former grave of Helen, Queen Mother of Romania, at Bois-de-Vaux Becoming too old to live alone, Helen finally left Fiesole in 1979. She then moved to a small apartment in Lausanne, located 45 minutes from the residence of Michael I and Anne, before moving in with them at Versoix in 1981. Helen, queen mother of Romania, died one year later on 28 November 1982, aged 86. She was buried without pomp in the Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery Royal Tombs and the funerals were celebrated by Damaskinos Papandreou, the first Greek Orthodox Metropolitan of Switzerland.Porter 2005, p. 230.

Added to the Tekken series as a tribute to Jackie Chan, Lei's role is that of a police officer who investigates the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation's illegal activities like hunting and trading of protected species. Lei has appeared in alternate Tekken media, as a playable character in Street Fighter X Tekken and many noncanonical Tekken games, and critics have received the character positively. Appearances=In video games= Making his debut in Tekken 2 (1995), Lei is a respected police officer who has put countless criminals behind bars, which earns him the nickname of \\"Super Police\\". While investigating the nefarious Mishima Zaibatsu corporation's illegal hunting and trading practices, he ends up fighting former fellow officer Bruce Irvin, who has switched his allegiance to Kazuya Mishima, son of Mishima Zaibatsu CEO Heihachi Mishima. After Lei defeats Bruce, Bruce escapes in a plane that later crashes, which he survives. After the third King of the Iron Fist Tournament during the events of Tekken 3 (1998), Lei's reputation as a crime fighter wanes and his work declines after his girlfriend dumps him for his assistant. When he discovers that a syndicate will send Nina Williams to kill professional boxer Steve Fox, he sets out to stop her and restore his reputation by joining the fourth tournament in Tekken 4 (2001). Lei is successful in thwarting the assassination and captures Nina, but Steve intervenes and frees Nina by assaulting Lei. Lei nonetheless breaks up the syndicate that had dispatched Nina to the tournament. Lei's storyline in Tekken 5 has him shipped off to Japan in pursuit of Feng Wei, who is responsible for the destruction of multiple dojos in Japan and China. At the same time, he joins forces with Steve in attempt to destroy the Mishima Zaibatsu. However, Feng's trail goes cold and Lei has no choice but to return to Hong Kong. In Tekken 6 (2007), Lei enters the sixth tournament in attempt to arrest Jin Kazama, as well as not forgetting his father Kazuya. In the game's \\"Scenario Campaign\\" story mode, Lei assists Lars Alexandersson and Alisa Bosconovitch in defeating the G Corporation's forces at the \\"ICPO Branch Office\\", and informs them that Kazuya has claimed the corporation by force. Lei returned in Tekken 7 as one of the Season 2 DLC characters. Depending on which stance he is in, Lei will utilize different Rage Drives. In his story biography, while once again investigate Kazuya's illegal activities in undercover, but this time on G Corporation, Lei also planned to meet the corporation's hired mascot Lucky Chloe secretly, whom Lei is big fan of. Lei appears as a playable character in the noncanonical Tekken titles Tekken Card Challenge, Tekken Tag Tournament, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 and Tekken 3D: Prime Edition. He appears as a playable downloadable character in Street Fighter X Tekken. Other media Lei appears in the 1998 animated film Tekken: The Motion Picture, in which he is partnered with Jun Kazama to investigate the Mishima Zaibatsu's illegal activities during the tournament. Rather than actually competing in the tournament, Lei infiltrates the island's underground base with Jack-2's help. He was voiced by Akio Nakamura, and by Gray G. Haddock in the English dub. =Design and gameplay= Lei was described by Namco for Tekken 2 as \\"very laid back with a casual attitude. He is one of the comedy relief of the Tekken cast and is constantly cracking jokes.\\" His fighting style and mannerisms are believed to be inspired by martial artist and actor Jackie Chan.Geoff King and Tanya Krzywinska (ed.) (2002), Screenplay: Cinema/videogames/interfaces (p. 200). Wallflower Press, The character is voiced in the games by Hiroya Ishimaru, Chan's Japanese voice actor. Though not mentioning Lei by name, Tekken series producer Katsuhiro Harada expressed regret in a 2015 interview with GamesRadar for having modeled many of the Tekken series characters after real-life personalities: \\"They may have been unique, but they didn‚Äôt really have any meaning.\\" In 2016, Harada explained Lei's absence from Tekken 7 (2015) in that he felt the character had not been chosen enough by players to warrant his inclusion. However, in 2018, Lei was added to the roster as part of the Season 2 DLC Pack. Lei's fighting style is canonically titled \\"Five Form-Based Martial Arts\\", further described as \\"five-animals-style Kung Fu, consisting of Tiger, Crane, Leopard, Snake and Dragon styles.\\" In his 2003 book Kung Fu Cult Masters, author Leon Hunt wrote that Lei \\"is widely taken to be Jackie Chan, even down to his Drunken Master style, but his Shaolin animal styles ‚Ä¶ suggest a broader-based remediation of the kung fu star.\\" According to Complex's Kevin Wong, Lei \\"is strictly for Tekken experts. He has seven stances to master ‚Ä¶ and a command list that is best described as overwhelming. Each new Tekken game [makes] Lei's learning curve incredibly steep.\\" GameSpy considered Lei in Tekken 6 \\"one of the most versatile characters\\", but \\"the complexity of his technique makes him a tad unaccessible to Tekken newcomers.\\" Angelo D'Argenio of Shoryuken said of the character in Tekken Tag Tournament 2: \\"Lei isn‚Äôt exactly a combo character, as he relies more on his mix-ups to deal damage.\\" Reception The character has received mostly positive reception from various gaming media outlets. Dave Cook of VG247 stated that Lei's \\"multi-stance move set\\" in Tekken 2 \\"delivered incredible depth that was foreign to the fighting genre at the time.\\" UGO Networks placed Lei among the 50 \\"greatest fictional detectives of all time\\" in 2008, describing him as \\"the longtime star of the Tekken franchise\\". Kevin Wong of Complex named Lei the eighth-best Tekken character in 2013. Lei's Tekken Tag Tournament 2 ending features him and Marshall Law engaging in a violent sparring session at Law's restaurant; based on the characters' resemblances to Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, respectively, 4thletter.net ranked it 163rd in their 2003 list of \\"The Top 200 Fighting Game Endings\\": \\"Lei is an action cop ‚Ä¶ while Law is a mediocre chef with a taste for get-rich-quick schemes. Still, such a match-up is hard to resist and Tekken Tag 2 gives us just that.\\" In 2015, Laurence Mozaffari of Digital Spy likened the \\"flip- floppy style of walking and fighting\\" of Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks to \\"another traditional martial arts style, called Zui Quan. You might recognise this brand of 'drunken kung fu' from the likes of Tekken's Lei Wulong.\\" Gavin Jasper of Den of Geek ranked Lei 33rd in his 2017 ranking of the Tekken series' 59 characters: \\"Yes, it‚Äôs cool that he‚Äôs an action cop who does drunken boxing. His ability to alter his fighting style is also novel. It‚Äôs just that the writers never seemed to have much more for him to do.\\" Though Lei was added to Street Fighter X Tekken as a downloadable character, in an official fan poll held by Namco in 2012 he was only the 36th-most requested out of 54 Tekken characters for inclusion in the game, receiving 3.5% (3,086) of 88,280 votes.

It is a left tributary of the Kamnik Bistrica. Bridges There are two notable bridges over Nevljica: * The Mammoth Bridge () in Nevlje. * The bridge over the Nevljica in Mekinje, built between 1952 and 1955. Its location was chosen by Jo≈æe Pleƒçnik, and its detailed plans were drawn up by his assistant Anton Bitenc based on Pleƒçnik's plans. 1938 finds In January 1938, due to erosion and frequent flooding, the administration of the Drava Banovina started to regulate the bed of the river. In addition, a bridge was to be built. On 14 March 1938, workers at the site found objects that were later shown to be an almost complete skeleton of a woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius). An Upper Paleolithic archaeological site was established in Nevlje. Remains of other animals as well as a human tool were found, and it was shown that around 22,000 years ago there was a human hunting settlement in the area.

This moduli space is the essence of the Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants, which find application in enumerative geometry and type IIA string theory. The idea of stable map was proposed by Maxim Kontsevich around 1992 and published in . Because the construction is lengthy and difficult, it is carried out here rather than in the Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants article itself. The moduli space of smooth pseudoholomorphic curves Fix a closed symplectic manifold X with symplectic form \\\\omega. Let g and n be natural numbers (including zero) and A a two-dimensional homology class in X. Then one may consider the set of pseudoholomorphic curves :((C, j), f, (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n))\\\\, where (C, j) is a smooth, closed Riemann surface of genus g with n marked points x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, and :f : C \\\\to X\\\\, is a function satisfying, for some choice of \\\\omega- tame almost complex structure J and inhomogeneous term u, the perturbed Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equation :\\\\bar \\\\partial_{j, J} f := \\\\frac{1}{2}(df + J \\\\circ df \\\\circ j) = u. Typically one admits only those g and n that make the punctured Euler characteristic 2 - 2g - n of C negative; then the domain is stable, meaning that there are only finitely many holomorphic automorphisms of C that preserve the marked points. The operator \\\\bar \\\\partial_{j, J} is elliptic and thus Fredholm. After significant analytical argument (completing in a suitable Sobolev norm, applying the implicit function theorem and Sard's theorem for Banach manifolds, and using elliptic regularity to recover smoothness) one can show that, for a generic choice of \\\\omega-tame J and perturbation u, the set of (j, J, u)-holomorphic curves of genus g with n marked points that represent the class A forms a smooth, oriented orbifold :M_{g, n}^{J, u}(X, A) of dimension given by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, :d := \\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{R}} M_{g, n}(X, A) = 2 c_1^X(A) + (\\\\dim_{\\\\mathbb{R}} X - 6)(1 - g) + 2 n. The stable map compactification This moduli space of maps is not compact, because a sequence of curves can degenerate to a singular curve, which is not in the moduli space as we've defined it. This happens, for example, when the energy of f (meaning the L2-norm of the derivative) concentrates at some point on the domain. One can capture the energy by rescaling the map around the concentration point. The effect is to attach a sphere, called a bubble, to the original domain at the concentration point and to extend the map across the sphere. The rescaled map may still have energy concentrating at one or more points, so one must rescale iteratively, eventually attaching an entire bubble tree onto the original domain, with the map well-behaved on each smooth component of the new domain. In order to make this precise, define a stable map to be a pseudoholomorphic map from a Riemann surface with at worst nodal singularities, such that there are only finitely many automorphisms of the map. Concretely, this means the following. A smooth component of a nodal Riemann surface is said to be stable if there are at most finitely many automorphisms preserving its marked and nodal points. Then a stable map is a pseudoholomorphic map with at least one stable domain component, such that for each of the other domain components *the map is nonconstant on that component, or *that component is stable. It is significant that the domain of a stable map need not be a stable curve. However, one can contract its unstable components (iteratively) to produce a stable curve, called the stabilization \\\\mathrm{st}(C) of the domain C. The set of all stable maps from Riemann surfaces of genus g with n marked points forms a moduli space :\\\\overline{M}_{g, n}^{J, u}(X, A). The topology is defined by declaring that a sequence of stable maps converges if and only if *their (stabilized) domains converge in the Deligne‚ÄìMumford moduli space of curves \\\\overline{M}_{g, n}, *they converge uniformly in all derivatives on compact subsets away from the nodes, and *the energy concentrating at any point equals the energy in the bubble tree attached at that point in the limit map. The moduli space of stable maps is compact; that is, any sequence of stable maps converges to a stable map. To show this, one iteratively rescales the sequence of maps. At each iteration there is a new limit domain, possibly singular, with less energy concentration than in the previous iteration. At this step the symplectic form \\\\omega enters in a crucial way. The energy of any smooth map representing the homology class B is bounded below by the symplectic area \\\\omega(B), :\\\\omega(B) \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int df^2, with equality if and only if the map is pseudoholomorphic. This bounds the energy captured in each iteration of the rescaling and thus implies that only finitely many rescalings are needed to capture all of the energy. In the end, the limit map on the new limit domain is stable. The compactified space is again a smooth, oriented orbifold. Maps with nontrivial automorphisms correspond to points with isotropy in the orbifold. The Gromov‚ÄìWitten pseudocycle To construct Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants, one pushes the moduli space of stable maps forward under the evaluation map :M_{g, n}^{J, u}(X, A) \\\\to \\\\overline{M}_{g, n} \\\\times X^n, :((C, j), f, (x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n)) \\\\mapsto (\\\\mathrm{st}(C, j), f(x_1), \\\\ldots, f(x_n)) to obtain, under suitable conditions, a rational homology class :GW_{g, n}^{X, A} \\\\in H_d(\\\\overline{M}_{g, n} \\\\times X^n, \\\\mathbb{Q}). Rational coefficients are necessary because the moduli space is an orbifold. The homology class defined by the evaluation map is independent of the choice of generic \\\\omega-tame J and perturbation u. It is called the Gromov‚ÄìWitten (GW) invariant of X for the given data g, n, and A. A cobordism argument can be used to show that this homology class is independent of the choice of \\\\omega, up to isotopy. Thus Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants are invariants of symplectic isotopy classes of symplectic manifolds. The \\"suitable conditions\\" are rather subtle, primarily because multiply covered maps (maps that factor through a branched covering of the domain) can form moduli spaces of larger dimension than expected. The simplest way to handle this is to assume that the target manifold X is semipositive or Fano in a certain sense. This assumption is chosen exactly so that the moduli space of multiply covered maps has codimension at least two in the space of non-multiply-covered maps. Then the image of the evaluation map forms a pseudocycle, which induces a well-defined homology class of the expected dimension. Defining Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants without assuming some kind of semipositivity requires a difficult, technical construction known as the virtual moduli cycle.

Its west end is at SR 1 in Fort Bragg, from where it heads east past Clear Lake, Colusa, Yuba City, Marysville and Nevada City to I-80 near Emigrant Gap, where eastbound traffic can continue on other routes to Lake Tahoe or Nevada. Portions of SR 20 are built near the routing of what was first a wagon road and later a turnpike in the late 19th century. This road was extended through the state highway system all the way to Ukiah in the early 20th century, and the missing link near Clear Lake was completed in 1932 before the official designation of this highway as SR 20 in 1934. There have been subsequent improvements to the road, such as the conversion of the Grass Valley portion of the route to freeway standards. Route description State Route 20 begins at SR 1 in southern Fort Bragg, less than from the Pacific Ocean. It heads east, quickly climbing into the Mendocino Range along a ridge and crossing through Dunlap Pass. The highway continues to rise alongside the North Fork Big River and tributaries, crossing another summit and then descending to Willits in the Little Lake Valley via Broaddus Creek. An overlap with US 101 begins in Willits and heads southeasterly to Calpella, north of Ukiah in Redwood Valley. There SR 20 turns east again, crossing the Russian River, passing the north shore of Lake Mendocino, and rising to a summit via the East Fork Russian River and Cold Creek. The roadway again descends alongside the Blue Lakes and Scotts Creek to the junction with SR 29 and the settlement of Upper Lake in the Clear Lake Basin. SR 20 closely follows the northeast shore of Clear Lake, staying right above the water line to avoid the adjacent hills. Where the lake ends, SR 20 continues east, intersecting SR 53 and then following the North Fork Cache Creek and tributaries to the Lake-Colusa County line. During its final descent into the Sacramento Valley, SR 20 intersects SR 16 and curves north and back east, entering the valley via Salt Creek.Google Maps street maps and USGS topographic maps, accessed January 2008 via ACME Mapper SR 20 in the Sacramento Valley Once it enters the flat Sacramento Valley, SR 20 takes a generally straight path, crossing I-5 in Williams, overlapping SR 45 near the west bank of the Sacramento River southeast from Colusa, and then turning back east to cross the Sacramento River and Sutter Bypass on its way to Yuba City. The route crosses SR 99 west of central Yuba City, and runs east through northern Yuba City to the Feather River, which it crosses on the 10th Street Bridge into Marysville. Within the central part of that city, SR 20 makes several turns, first turning south from 10th Street onto E Street, then east on 9th Street (overlapping SR 70), north on B Street, and east on 12th Street (splitting from SR 70). The highway leaves Marysville to the northeast, paralleling the Yuba River on its north side as it enters the foothills of the Sierra Nevada. SR 20 rises into the Sierra along the north side of the Yuba River, crossing to the south side near Smartsville and then climbing through several ravines to the Penn Valley. The current alignment, built in the mid-1980s as a mostly two-lane freeway, continues east across rugged terrain to the city of Grass Valley, where it joins SR 49 on the Golden Center Freeway. The two routes travel northeast to Nevada City, where SR 49 turns northwest and SR 20 resumes its eastward course as a two-lane highway. The roadway climbs from Nevada City and follows Harmony Ridge and Washington Ridge before descending into the Bear Valley via a series of hairpin turns, and then climbing, just north of Emigrant Gap, to its end at I-80 at Yuba Pass. The Pioneer Trail, a National Recreation Trail, parallels SR 20 from a point on Harmony Ridge to the Bear Valley, and includes parts of a branch of the California Trail first used in 1850. SR 20 east of US 101 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, although it is mostly a two-lane surface road; east of SR 53, it is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. All of SR 20 is on the Interregional Road System, a highway system that connects major economic centers of the state,California State Legislature, CA Codes (shc:163-164.56) , accessed March 2008 and has been selected by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) as a High Emphasis Route and Focus Route from US 101 to SR 29 and SR 53 to I-80, with the designated corridor following SR 29 and SR 53 around the south side of Clear Lake.California Department of Transportation, High Emphasis Routes, January 2005California Department of Transportation, Focus Routes, January 2005 It is also eligible for the State Scenic Highway System from SR 1 to SR 16 and SR 49 to I-80, and has been designated as such for near the east end; this is part of the federally designated Yuba-Donner Scenic Byway, a National Forest Scenic Byway that uses SR 20 east of SR 49.National Scenic Byways Online, Yuba-Donner Scenic Byway , accessed January 2008 Marker along California State Route 20.

This route generally followed the present SR 20, except around Clear Lake and between Marysville and Rough and Ready (where it used Spenceville Road).

D. Hess, the couple formed the Parepa Rosa English Opera Company in New York and toured in America for three seasons, with Parepa as the star and Rosa as the conductor. It brought grand opera to places in America that had never seen any, performing Italian operas in English, which made them more accessible to American audiences. In 1872, the Rosas returned to England and also visited Europe and Egypt. Rosa changed the spelling of his name after he moved to England, where people took \\"Rose\\" as a monosyllable.

Rosa's policy was to present operas in English, and that remained the company's practice.\\"Mr. Carl Rosa and English Opera\\", The Manchester Guardian, 21 June 1889, p. 7 That year, Rosa invited the dramatist W. S. Gilbert to write a libretto for Rosa to present as part of a planned 1874 season at the Drury Lane Theatre. Gilbert expanded one of the comic Bab Ballads that he had written for Fun magazineGilbert, W. S.

Rosa later endowed a Parepa-Rosa scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in London. He married a second time in 1881. With his second wife, Josephine (d. 1927), he had four children. Alfred Bryanthumbleft The company's first London season opened at the Princess's Theatre in September 1875, playing The Marriage of Figaro, with Charles Santley as Figaro and Rose Hersee as Susanna. In 1876, Rosa staged a second London season, which featured the first performance in English of The Flying Dutchman with Santley in the title role. For the next fifteen years, under Rosa's guidance, the company prospered and earned good notices, with provincial tours and London seasons, frequently in conjunction with Augustus Harris at the Drury Lane Theatre. Such was the success of the company that at one point three Carl Rosa touring troupes were set up. Rosa hired Alberto Randegger as the musical director of the company from 1879 to 1885. In 1880, George Grove wrote: \\"The careful way in which the pieces are put on the stage, the number of rehearsals, the eminence of the performers and the excellence of the performers have begun to bear their legitimate fruit, and the Carl Rosa Opera Company bids fair to become a permanent English institution.\\"\\"A Brief History\\", carlrosaopera.co.uk, 2009 In 1892, Rosa's Grand Opera Company gave a command performance of La fille du r√©giment at Balmoral Castle. Rosa introduced many works of important opera repertoire to England for the first time, performing some 150 different operas over the years. Besides Santley and Hersee, Minnie Hauk, Joseph Maas, Barton McGuckin and Giulia Warwick were some of the famous singers associated with the company during its early years.\\"The Performers\\", carlrosaopera.co.uk, 2009 Rosa also encouraged and supported new works by English composers. Frederic Hymen Cowen's Pauline (1876), Arthur Goring Thomas's Esmeralda (1883), Alexander Mackenzie's Colomba (1883) and The Troubabour, and Charles Villiers Stanford's The Canterbury Pilgrims (1884) were commissioned by the company. Earlier English operas by Wallace, Balfe and Julius Benedict were also included in the company's repertoire. An obituarist noted, \\"He had long looked forward to the time when Sir Arthur Sullivan would have undertaken a grand opera, and to the last had hoped to have been able to produce such a work.\\" Shortly before his death, Rosa launched a light opera company that debuted with Robert Planquette's Paul Jones.

By the time he died, Rosa had demonstrated that English opera could be an artistic and financial success. In a memorial lecture, the critic Herman Klein said of him, \\"From an artistic point of view he achieved triumph after triumph; he lifted English opera out of the slough of despond in which it was found in 1875.\\" Both during his life and after his death, his company had much to do with popularizing opera in England, encouraging native composers and training many singers who went on to international careers. His company survived his death and continued to perform opera in English until 1960. A new opera company, using the name, was revived in 1997 under the artistic direction of Peter Mulloy. This company performs Gilbert and Sullivan and other light operas, as well as grand opera. Notes, references and sources=NotesReferencesSources= * * Further reading *Abraham, G.

It ran for 50 episodes. It is also referred to as \\"God Sigma, Empire of Space\\" and \\"Space Combination God Sigma\\". Concept Space Emperor God Sigma was created by Toei's Television Division, under the name \\"Saburo Yatsude\\" and produced by Academy Production (who subcontracted Greenbox). The series was produced by the main Toei company, and not by Toei Animation; Yoshinobu Nishizaki's Academy Productions provided production assistance. Toei Agency handled the advertising for the show, and its main sponsor was Popy (now Bandai's Boy's Toys Division). This anime was the last that Takashi Ijima would work on; he had been part of Toei's TV division's projects since Ch≈çdenji Robo Combattler V, which aired in 1976. Joined by Katsuhiko Taguchi, the chief director, the two created an anime that lasted for four full seasons, which was rare at the time of its broadcast. Story The story is set in the year 2050 AD, and mankind has been steadily advancing its space technology. However, the planet is suddenly set upon by a mysterious enemy: the forces of Eldar, who came from 250 years in the future. In their time, 2300 AD, their planet Eldar was invaded by Earth, and soundly defeated by Earth's Trinity Energy, a mysterious energy used in their weaponry that possesses power many times that of a hydrogen bomb. The Eldar people's objective is to steal this Trinity Energy before it can be used against them. The Eldar forces begin by taking over Jupiter's moon Io, one of the places humanity has immigrated to by then. After that, they begin to attack Trinity City with their legions of Cosmosauruses in order to steal the Trinity Energy. Toshiya and his friends use God Sigma to protect the planet and the Trinity Energy, and the battle evolves into a long war to retake Io.

Two separate combination scenes exist in the anime - one during the beginning, and one from the middle onwards. Its total height was originally stated to be 265 meters tall, but since this would cause difficulties for the actual animation, it was changed to 66 meters. It weighs 1200 tons, and its power source is Trinity Energy. It possesses the ability to cruise from Earth to Jupiter and back. It can be controlled by the main pilot, Toshiya, but without the other two component robots' generators to supplement his own, it's not as powerful. In the final episode, it and the giant mecha Gargos destroy each other. However, it is repaired after the war and revamped to be a single- pilot machine, and Toshiya sets off with it by himself.

At the time of the show's broadcast, Pluto was actually inside the orbit of Neptune. This was not reflected in the animation, the reason being that the show itself is set in the year 2050. Also, the rings of Jupiter had just been discovered the year before, so in the ending animation, Jupiter is depicted with rings. However, in contrast to the actual rings of Jupiter, which are too thin to see a shadow cast on the planet, the picture of Jupiter in the ending sequence does have the shadow of rings on it. Media The series was telecast in Italy under the title God Sigma, l'imperatore dello spazio (the Italian translation of the full Japanese title). God Sigma toys were released under the premier Godaikin toy label in Japan and Hong Kong in the 1980s. On March 16, 2011, Pony Canyon released a complete DVD box set, which only had a limited production run. This is the first and only digital version of the show. Appearances in other works Space Emperor God Sigma appears in various games by Banpresto (currently Bandai Namco Games). Its first appearance was in a 1992 Famicom game called Shuffle Fight. Its second was in the 2008 PS2 game Super Robot Wars Z. However, by this time, Toshiya's voice actor Tomiyama Kei had died, so the role was given to Tomokazu Seki instead. In the same game, a robot from Gravion called God Œ£ Gravion appears, triggering a conversation between the characters of each series. God Sigma also appears in the game's two-part sequel, 2nd Super Robot Wars Z: Hakai-hen and Saisei-hen.

A power-hungry kickboxer, Bryan was once an Interpol officer until he was killed in a shootout. He was revived by the mad scientist Dr. Abel through the use of cybernetics. Appearances=In video games= Formerly an officer in the International Police Organization, Bryan was killed during a shootout in Hong Kong one day. His corpse was transported to the laboratory of a mad scientist named Dr. Abel. In his attempt to complete his project of forming a cyborg army. Abel thought that a perfect cyborg must have the mechanics built by his rival Bosconovitch, so he reanimated Fury's body and sends him to collect data on similar plans by his rival, Dr. Bosconovitch. Bryan sneaks into the third King of Iron Fist tournament, targeting Yoshimitsu, who has strong ties with Bosconovitch. In Tekken 4, Abel abandons Bryan when Heihachi Mishima and the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation recruits him as its top scientific advisor. This sends Bryan into a rage, and he enters the fourth tournament, feeling victory will force Abel to change his body, thus becoming the most incredible being in existence once again. This does not happen, and Bryan instead uses his last ounce of strength to knock Abel out before losing consciousness, although it is not known what happened to Abel after this. Yoshimitsu brings him to Dr. Bosconovitch, who promises to transfer Bryan's mind into a new body, although it will take a whole year. In Tekken 5, however, Bryan awakens a month later. Bosconovitch tells Bryan that his body was too complex to work with, but as a last resort, he had installed a perpetual power generator in him as an emergency measure. Upon learning this, Bryan attacks Bosconovitch and the Manji clan members assigned to guard the doctor, and leaves the laboratory. Bryan enters the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 to test his performance with the generator installed, unaware that Yoshimitsu is pursuing him for revenge. Yoshimitsu's repeated meddling hinders Bryan's hopes of unlocking the generator's true powers in the King of Iron Fist Tournament 5. Soon afterwards, Bryan's frustration reaches its pinnacle, and he begins to destroy everything in sight after leaving the tournament. Driven by rage, he ventures to various battlefields around the world, indiscriminately leveling everything in his way into rubble. However, he soon grows tired of the same thing repeating itself countless times. Around this time, he catches wind of the King of Iron Fist Tournament 6. Seeing another chance to test the generator's true powers, he signs up. Bryan also appears in Tekken 7, being one of the 18 characters available in the first location tests of the game. Bryan also appears in Tekken Card Challenge, Tekken Tag Tournament, Tekken 3D: Prime Edition, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, and Tekken Revolution. Bryan appears in Capcom-made crossover fighting game Street Fighter X Tekken as a DLC character with Jack-X as his official tag partner. His Swap Costume is modeled after Urien. According to the download blurb, with his powers and abilities being recognized by Urien, the second in command of a mysterious organization, Bryan is brought into their ranks. Additionally, M.

Many scars are apparent around his body, including a vertical one on his face, a large cross-shaped one on his back, and a long vertical one on his torso. Once a police detective before becoming a cyber- zombie, Bryan wears numerous outfits with military or police motifs, plus gray camouflage pants, black combat boots, gloves, and knee pads.

Now more bullet magazines with shotgun shells in them are tied around his waist and left leg, and small grenades are tied around his lower left leg. He also gains brass knuckles with spikes on them. His Player 2 costume usually consists of snake leather pants, a black T-shirt, and black shoes and gloves. Bryan has worn his characteristic snakeskin pants with gloves throughout the Tekken series. In Tekken 7 (starting from Fated Retribution arcade title update), Bryan dons his Tekken 4 green jacket once again, with the trouser color scheme now in gray camouflage, except some body parts' sides are torn and show cyborg body parts underneath the skin on his left arm and right leg. Despite both the left arm and right leg outfit parts torn up, Bryan's glove on the left side, and kneepad and boots on the right side remained intact. Additionally, Bryan wears a black bandanna mask with a half-fanged skeletal mouth and tongue design. Bryan is an unorthodox kickboxer who heavily relies on a ferocious punishment game. He can do heavy amounts of damage with his counter-hits, making sure no move goes unpunished. He also has pressuring capabilities, keeping opponents on tilt. Bryan is well known for his \\"Fisherman Slam\\", a move in which he lifts his opponent by punching his or her chest and slams him or her into the ground, while delivering his evil laugh. He will laugh whenever specific moves (e.g. Jack's \\"Volcano Blaster\\" and Nina's \\"Bad Habit\\") are performed on him. Bryan however is relatively unsafe and has a limited range of moves, so risks must be taken to be rewarded with combos near 30% damage. He is the only character whose ten-hit strings exclude low attacks. In all, he is a consistently powerful character with a toolset for intimidating his opponents. Bryan fights using violent kickboxing techniques as he used to rely on \\"eight science of limbs\\" for most of his movesets such as the combination of punches, kicks, elbows and knees for striking as seen on one of his single win poses. =In other media= Bryan appears in three Tekken comics, Tekken Saga (1997), Tekken: Tatakai no Kanatani (2000) and Tekken Forever (2003). In the 2010 live action movie Tekken, Bryan is portrayed by Gary Daniels. He is depicted as a man who has had cybernetic upgrades. He is blackmailed by Kazuya Mishima into killing Jin Kazama to keep his cybernetic upgrades a secret. After Kazuya changes the rules of the tournament making it so that the competitors are forced to kill each other in order to win, Bryan is pitted against Sergei Dragunov, whom he kills with a spiked chain during their fight. He later fights Jin Kazama and although he has the upper hand through most of the fight, Jin flashes back to Jun Kazama's training and follows her advice by exploiting Bryan's weak spots. Bryan is defeated and killed by Jin. Prior to his death, Bryan held the title as the 'current' King of Iron Fist Tournament. Bryan appears in the prequel, Tekken 2: Kazuya's Revenge, with Daniels reprising his role. A dossier on Bryan is briefly seen in the CGI film Tekken: Blood Vengeance when Anna Williams opens a file containing dossiers on various persons of interest. Reception Upon Bryan Fury's debut in Tekken 3, Next Generation called him \\"easily the scariest looking of the new batch\\". In 2012, Cheat Code Central ranked Bryan as the sixth \\"baddest video game fighter\\", commenting: \\"On paper, Bryan Fury is a kickboxer; in practice, Bryan Fury is insane. He's a cop, he's a zombie, and he's ready to tear your face off if you look at him funny.\\" In 2013, Complex ranked Bryan as the fourteenth-best Tekken character, commenting: \\"It starts with the laugh ‚Äì that insane, cackling laugh that he belts out at the beginning of his matches. For a zombie, Bryan sure is lively, not to mention crazy.\\" 4thletter placed Bryan's Tekken 5 (alongside Tekken Tag Tournament 2) ending at 24th place in their list of top 200 fighting game endings. In GamesRadar article for Street Fighter X Tekken, they stated: \\"Sometimes searching for a way to extend his artificial life ala the villains in Blade Runner, other times simply entering the tournaments to test his powers, Bryan is one of the tougher customers in the Tekken series.\\" PlayStation Universe included Bryan Fury and Yoshimitsu among the top five rival pairs in Tekken Tag Tournament 2, commenting \\"Bryan is your heavy hitter, with his meaty kicks and punches delivering some health- zapping blows, while Yoshimitsu can confuse and abuse his victims with some intricate juggles and mix-up combos.\\"Mike Harradence, Tekken's greatest rivals make the best Tag Teams, PlayStation Universe, September 19th, 2012. Peter Austin from WhatCulture named Bryan the \\"2nd Greatest Tekken Character of All Time\\". Bryan was ranked by Den of Geek as the \\"7th best Tekken character\\", with comments \\"Someone at Namco realized that Roy Batty from Blade Runner would make for a good fighting game character and God bless them because they were right. Bryan Fury is giving us a ridiculous undead cyborg of a man who wants to smash your jaw off as he laughs maniacally.\\" Paste ranked Bryan as the \\"16th Best Tekken Character\\", commenting \\"Fury now wanders the world looking for a fight worthy of his talents, killing anyone brave enough to get in his way with his powerful cybernetic body and kickboxing martial arts style.\\" In an official fan poll by Namco, Bryan ranked as the tenth-most requested Tekken character to be playable in Tekken X Street Fighter, at 9.72% of votes.

In this cyclic compound, the three BH units and three NH units alternate. The compound is isoelectronic and isostructural with benzene. For this reason borazine is sometimes referred to as ‚Äúinorganic benzene‚Äù. Like benzene, borazine is a colourless liquid.  Synthesis  The compound was reported in 1926 by the chemists Alfred Stock and Erich Pohland by a reaction of diborane with ammonia. Borazine is synthesized from diborane and ammonia in a 1:2 ratio at 250‚Äì300 ¬∞C with a conversion of 50%. :3 B2H6 \\\\+ 6 NH3 ‚Üí 2 B3H6N3 \\\\+ 12 H2 An alternative more efficient route begins with lithium borohydride and ammonium chloride: :3 LiBH4 \\\\+ 3 NH4Cl ‚Üí B3H6N3 \\\\+ 3 LiCl + 9 H2 In a two-step process to borazine, boron trichloride is first converted to trichloroborazine: :3 BCl3 \\\\+ 3 NH4Cl ‚Üí Cl3B3H3N3 \\\\+ 9 HCl The B-Cl bonds are subsequently converted to B-H bonds: :2 Cl3B3H3N3 \\\\+ 6 NaBH4 ‚Üí 2 B3H6N3 \\\\+ 3 B2H6 \\\\+ 6 NaCl Properties Borazine is a colourless liquid with an aromatic smell. In water it hydrolyzes to boric acid, ammonia, and hydrogen. Borazine, with a standard enthalpy change of formation ŒîHf of ‚àí531 kJ/mol, is thermally very stable. = Structure = Borazine is isoelectronic with benzene and has similar connectivity, so it is sometimes referred to as \\"inorganic benzene\\". This comparison is not rigorously valid due to the electronegativity difference between boron and nitrogen. X-ray crystallographic structural determinations show that the bond lengths within the borazine ring are all equivalent at 1.429 √Ö, a property shared by benzene. However, the borazine ring does not form a perfect hexagon. The bond angle is 117.1¬∞ at the boron atoms and 122.9¬∞ at the nitrogens, giving the molecule distinct symmetry. The electronegativity of boron (2.04 on the Pauling scale) compared to that of nitrogen (3.04) and also the electron deficiency on the boron atom and the lone pair on nitrogen favor alternative mesomer structures for borazine. 600px Boron behaves as a Lewis acid and nitrogen behaves as a Lewis base. =Aromaticity= Due to its similarities to benzene, there have been a number of computational and experimental analyses of borazine's aromaticity. The number of pi electrons in borazine obeys the 4n + 2 rule, and the B-N bond lengths are equal, which suggests the compound may be aromatic. The electronegativity difference between boron and nitrogen, however, creates an unequal sharing of charge which results in bonds with greater ionic character, and thus it is expected to have poorer delocalization of electrons than the all-carbon analog. Natural Bond Orbitals (NBO) Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis suggests weak aromaticity in borazine. In the NBO model, B-N bonds in the ring are slightly displaced from the nuclear axes, and B and N have large differences in charge. Natural chemical shielding (NCS) analysis provides some further evidence for aromaticity based on a contribution of the B-N œÄ bond to magnetic shielding. Computations based on NBO orbitals show that this œÄ bond allows for weak ring current which somewhat counteracts a magnetic field simulated at the center of the borazine ring. A small ring current does suggest some delocalization. Electron Localization Function (ELF) Topological analysis of bonding in borazine by the Electron Localization Function (ELF) indicates that borazine can be described as a œÄ aromatic compound. However, the bonding in borazine is less delocalized than in benzene based on a difference in bifurcation values of the electron basins. Larger bifurcation values indicate better electron delocalization, and it is argued that when this bifurcation value is greater than 0.70, the delocalization is sufficient to designate a compound aromatic. For benzene, this value is 0.91, but the borazine œÄ system bifurcates at the ELF value 0.682. This is caused by the difference in electronegativity between B and N, which produces a weaker bond interaction than the C-C interaction in benzene, leading to increased localization of electrons on the B-H and N-H units. The bifurcation value is slightly below the limit of 0.70 which suggests moderate aromaticity. =Reactivity= Although often compared with benzene, borazine is far more reactive. With hydrogen chloride it forms an adduct, whereas benzene is unreactive toward HCl. Polyborazylene :B3N3H6 \\\\+ 3 HCl ‚Üí B3N3H9Cl3 :Addition reaction of borazine with hydrogen chloride :B3N3H9Cl3 \\\\+ NaBH4 ‚Üí (BH4N)3 :Reduction with sodium borohydride The addition reaction with bromine does not require a catalyst. Borazines undergo nucleophilic attack at boron and electrophilic attack at nitrogen. Heating borazine at 70 ¬∞C expels hydrogen with formation of a borazinyl polymer or polyborazylene, in which the monomer units are coupled in a para fashion by new boron-nitrogen bonds. Boron nitride can be prepared by heating polyborazylene to 1000 ¬∞C. Borazines are also starting materials for other potential ceramics such as boron carbonitrides. Borazine can also be used as a precursor to grow haxagonal boron nitride (h-BN) thin films and single layers on catalytic surfaces such as copper, platinum, nickel iron and many more, with chemical vapor deposition (CVD). synthetic route to boron carbonitrides, first step a hydroboration reaction to an oligomeric precursor followed by step two: pyrolysis Polyborazylene has been proposed as a recycled hydrogen storage medium for hydrogen fuel cell vehicle applications, using a \\"single pot\\" process for digestion and reduction to recreate ammonia borane.

Parish was born in Manning, South Carolina to a poor family, attended the University of South Carolina, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.Harper Collins: About Peggy Parish She worked as a teacher in Oklahoma, Kentucky, and in New York. She taught at the Dalton School in Manhattan for 15 years and published her first children's book while teaching third grade there. She authored over 30 books, which had sold 7 million copies at the time of her death. Parish's most well-known character, Amelia Bedelia, is extremely literal minded and interprets idioms and other verbal expressions literally, which amusingly causes great havoc in each story. This idea originated in conversations between Parish and Greenwillow Books founder Susan Hirschman about the author's observations of her third grade students. Amelia works as a household cook and occasional servant, jobs that Parish did in her home when she was young. She uses no recipes, but, by intuitively combining a little bit of this and a little bit of that, her cakes and cookies and meals are always delicious. She is such a good cook that her employers cannot fire her, despite the disastrous way she misinterprets their instructions: prune the shrubs, scale and ice the fish, file the letters, run over the tablecloth with an iron, shorten these dresses, serve coffee with porridge, heat a can of soup, and so on. The author's word-play, and Amelia Bedelia's fundamental goodness and childlike simplicity appeal to youngsters who are beginning to see and enjoy more than one meaning in a word or a phrase. Parish's nephew, Herman, honored Peggy's life in his book, Good Driving, Amelia Bedelia, by writing in its dedication: \\"For Peggy Parish, the real Amelia.\\" Recalling Parish's method while working on Too Many Rabbits, Herman described how she wrote out her ideas on index cards, \\"and she‚Äôd deal out those cards like she was playing solitaire, and then pick them up, retype them, and rewrite everything many times. That was how she worked, and it gave me a lot of respect for her method.\\" Selected works *Littlest Raccoon (1961), illustrated by Claude Humbert *Let's Be Indians (1962), illus.

They were part of the German heavy/speed/power metal scene. Their latest album, Santa Muerte, was released on September 13, 2019. History Mat Sinner 2019 Based in Stuttgart, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, Germany, Sinner released their first album, Wild'n'Evil in 1982. This album, along with the next two (Fast Decision and Danger Zone) were raw affairs, having little in common with the melodic metal they would later become known for. After many personnel changes (including drummer Edgar Patrik leaving to join Bonfire), the band saw the addition of Accept's Herman Frank on guitars and the release of Touch of Sin in 1985. Frank would leave before the next album, 1986's Comin' Out Fighting, with future U.D.O. guitarist Mathias Dieth replacing him. 1987 saw the release of Dangerous Charm, a much more melodic album than previous efforts, but shortly after this the band lost their recording contract, took a break and would not be heard of again for five years. In 1990, Mat Sinner released a solo album called Back to the Bullet on BMG with a completely new band. Three members of the Mat Sinner band reformed Sinner and released No More Alibis in 1992, an album far heavier than anything Sinner had released before. This renewed vigour coupled with songwriting that far exceeded the band's previous releases not only carried on but strengthened with Respect in 1994 and Bottom Line in 1995, the latter staying in the Japanese national charts for five weeks. Since the reformation the band's reputation had improved immensely, touring as support for bands such as Mr. Big and Savatage as well as headlining their own German tour and releasing a live album. Sinner were to reach even higher peaks though, releasing two hugely successful albums with Judgement Day in 1997 and The Nature of Evil in 1998 before touring Europe as support for rock giants Deep Purple. The Nature of Evil was the band's most successful album to date, reaching No. 63 in the German album charts. In 1998, Mat Sinner and Tom Naumann, who had been with Sinner since their reformation in 1992 formed Primal Fear with ex-Gamma Ray vocalist Ralf Scheepers. Mat Sinner has been involved as a driving force in both Sinner and Primal Fear to this day. Sinner 2019-2 In 2000, the band saw its first line-up change in five years as several members left, including guitarist Tom Naumann while ex-Helloween and Gamma Ray's Uli Kusch filled in on drums for The End of Sanctuary. However, in 2003 the previous 1995‚Äì1999 line-up renewed itself and on 20.01.2003 released There Will Be Execution before going quiet again for four years. In the past nine years the band had released six albums, each as good, if not better than the last, proving to be the band's most successful period. This success would continue, as after releasing two more albums with Primal Fear, an album with his pre-Sinner band Goddess Shiva and guesting on Tribuzy's debut album, Mat Sinner brought Sinner back to release Mask of Sanity in 2007. This album spawned two popular singles in \\"Diary of Evil\\" and \\"Black\\" and included a faithful rendition of Thin Lizzy's \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\". Album sales Sinner album sales have never been spectacular: it is estimated they sold less than 150,000 copies of their first three releases. The band's six and seven track albums of the 1990s, Respect and Bottom Line, sold less than 200,000 combined and without any real advertising except that of word of mouth. Sinner's fourth full-length album, Judgement Day, received fair reviews but again had little advertising put into it as the band spent most of its money on recording. Sinner's Nature of Evil released in 1998 proved to be the band's most successful original album with over 100,000 copies sold. Nature of Evil was advertised heavily on the internet mostly on German Music web sites. In 1998 and 1999, Sinner released two compilation albums, the first was Emerald Collection containing many tracks from Danger Zone and Comin' Out Fighting. The second compilation album, which contained three songs from Bottom Line, three songs from Nature of Evil, four songs from Judgement Day, two from live recording and three new released songs, was called The Second Decade. The Second Decade became Sinner's best selling album, most of which were bought on eBay. The Second Decade by Sinner until 2005 was the only album available for sale on eBay and proved to be an international success. The Second Decade brought new fans to Europe primarily from Latin America, Japan, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Poland and Greece. The End of Sanctuary and There Will Be Execution are currently Sinner's only 21st century albums selling good and entered the German album charts. After the German Top 50 album \\"Tequila Suicide\\" Sinner toured Europe, Japan & Australia. The new Sinner album \\"Santa Muerte\\" will be released via AFM Records on September 13, 2019 incl. the first single/video \\"Fiesta Y Copas\\" feat. Ronnie Romero of Rainbow. Sinner has released seventeen albums and sold over a million records worldwide.

Pontus De la Gardie's second son, Jacob De la Gardie, was given the title count of L√§ck√∂ in 1615; his grandson Magnus Gabriel De la Gardie became a favourite of Queen Christina and married her cousin, Countess Palatine Maria Eufrosyne of Zweibr√ºcken (a sister of Charles X Gustav of Sweden). The De la Gardie of L√§ck√∂ comital lineage is extinct. The current head of the family, Carl Gustaf De la Gardie (1946- ), lives outside Link√∂ping.

He is an orphan adopted by Heihachi Mishima, head of the Mishima Zaibatsu corporation, and later becoming embroiled in a one- sided rivalry with his adoptive brother, Kazuya Mishima. The defeat of Kazuya is Lee's primary objective in entering the King of Iron Fist fighting tournaments. Since making his debut in the original Tekken, Lee has been a mainstay in the series, appearing in every subsequent game except for Tekken 3, and has at times appeared as an alter ego named Violet, who is additionally playable in several series installments. Outside of the games, Lee has appeared in two animated Tekken films, and he has received a positive critical reception for his flamboyant personality and particularly his Tekken 5 ending. Appearances=In video games= Lee is the Chinese adoptive son of Heihachi Mishima, whose own son Kazuya's defeat is Lee's motivation for entering the numerous King of Iron Fist tournaments held throughout the Tekken series. Lee was adopted by Heihachi to provide a rival for Kazuya, who he felt was too weak to lead his Mishima Zaibatsu company. Lee studies in the United States alongside Paul Phoenix and Marshall Law. After Kazuya wins control of the company, Lee works as Kazuya's secretary, in addition to overseeing Kazuya's team of bodyguards and Dr. Bosconovitch's experiments, all while secretly hoping to take over the Zaibatsu. However, Lee is soon expelled from the Zaibatsu for unknown reasons while Heihachi disowns him, causing him to leave the world of fighting and pursuing a career in robotics. Lee returns in Tekken 4 as a playboy whose robotics operation is a success. Upon learning that the Zaibatsu's rival G Corporation was attacked by the Tekken Force, Lee joins the fourth tournament after changing his appearance and calling himself Violet in order to conceal his identity, while hoping to test his new \\"Combot\\" experiment in the process. However, he is defeated early by Kazuya, whom Lee had believed to be dead, but he then learns someone else had controlled the Zaibatsu in Heihachi's absence. Believing it to be Kazuya, Lee enters the fifth tournament in Tekken 5 to take him out personally and regain control of the Zaibatsu, but upon learning that the culprit is Heihachi's father Jinpachi, he drops out of the tournament and returns to his business. After Kazuya legitimately takes control of the company, Lee enters the next tournament in attempt again to come in contact with Kazuya. In the game's \\"Scenario Campaign\\" story mode, Lee joins forces with Julia Chang, Lars Alexandersson, and Dr. Bosconovitch's android daughter Alisa, due to their shared objective of stopping Kazuya and Jin, but Lee and Lars are not aware at first that Alisa was created to serve Jin, thus acting as a mole for Lars. When Alisa is destroyed at the climax, Lee promises Lars that she will be reconstructed with his company's resources, which he finally succeeded at the same time of Heihachi's return in the seventh tournament. Lee is selectable in the noncanonical games Tekken Tag Tournament, Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Tekken 3D: Prime Edition, and Tekken Revolution. Design and gameplay Lee's alter ego Violet in Tekken 7 The first Tekken features Lee wearing a simple purple vest and black pants, a color palette that would regularly be used for the character. In Tekken 4, Lee has a more formal design with a purple dress shirt, white vest and matching pants. Lee's primary outfit for Tekken 5 and 6 is a retread of his original costume from the first game embellished with a fishnet undershirt and a black collar. An alternate Tekken 5 costume was designed by manga artist and character designer Ry≈çji Minagawa. For Tekken Tag Tournament 2, Lee wears a black leather vest with a unicorn printed on the back. Lee's Tekken 7 design is his most elaborate, with a suit and tie worn beneath a long purple overcoat. A constant for Lee throughout his series appearances has been his silver hair, which, as Violet, changes to dark purple to go with an open-chested purple dress shirt and sunglasses. In response to a fan's tweet requesting Lee's inclusion in Tekken 7, Tekken producer Katsushiro Harada joked that a future installment would need to include \\"130 characters\\" to satisfy the series' fanbase. GameSpy considered non-walled arenas in Tekken 4 and Tekken 5 to be a disadvantage for Lee players, but added that he was among \\"the faster characters in the game\\" with \\"good combo ability\\". The site said of Lee in Tekken 6, \\"Lee has the best use of Okizeme in the game\\", though his \\"attacks only have average reach and damage.\\" 1UP.com wrote in 2013: \\"Playing mind games with your opponent is one of Lee‚Äôs specialties. After a juggle, you have the option to manipulate your opponent in whether to stay on the ground, roll back, or get straight back up.\\" Tekken Tag Tournament 2 includes a \\"Fight Lab\\" tutorial, where players control training robot Combot under Violet's guidance and face a series of bizarre opponents. =In other media= Lee appears in the 1997 OVA Tekken: The Motion Picture as one of the main antagonists. In the film, he is mentioned as being a former underground fighter known as the Silver Devil. Heihachi plans to hand the Mishima Zaibatsu over to Kazuya should he defeat Heihachi in the upcoming tournament, but Lee wants the company for himself and therefore hires assassins Nina and Anna Williams to kill Kazuya, a task they repeatedly fail. During the tournament, Lee tests his new experiments on the fighters: humanoid dinosaurs called Rex (based on Alex). His plan backfires as Anna is devoured by one of the creatures, while Kazuya kills the others before scaring the last surviving one away. Lee then confronts Kazuya at the doors of the Zaibatsu tower, but he is beaten with a single punch and Heihachi discards him for being worthless. Lee subsequently commits suicide by entering the tower, killing all its security personnel before setting the island's self-destruction sequence, and remaining inside when it explodes. The explosion causes a chain reaction that takes out the entire island that had served as the tournament grounds, but both Kazuya and Heihachi escape in time. Lee was voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki in the original Japanese version, and by David Stokey in the English dub. Lee's personality differs in the 2011 CGI film Tekken: Blood Vengeance, in which he has a minor role as a wealthy and eccentric teacher at Kyoto International School. He aids Alisa, Ling Xiaoyu, and Panda during an escape by providing them shelter, but part of his mansion is later destroyed in a fight between Anna and Nina. He was voiced by Ry√¥tar√¥ Okiayu in the original Japanese version, and by Kaiji Tang in the English dub. Lee appears in the YouTube webseries, \\"Tekken Stop Motion Web Series\\" in episode 2 where he battles Kazuya. Reception Elton Jones of Complex described Lee in 2012 as \\"Heihachi's adopted son and the man that invented 'swagged out martial arts.'\\" Tom Goulter of GamesRadar remarked on Lee's adoption into the Mishima family: \\"One suspects that the entire storyline of Tekken would be rendered void if anyone had just given the young Heihachi some decent parenting literature.\\" Gavin Jasper of 4thletter.net ranked Lee's Tag Tournament 2 ending, in which a tuxedo-clad Lee nonchalantly beats up a group of soldiers while walking with his assistant to his robotics laboratory, 125th in his 2013 rating of the 200 greatest fighting game endings: \\"When people describe someone as being 'like a boss,' they‚Äôre really comparing him to Lee Chaolan.\\" Mike Luces of International Business Times considered Lee's inclusion in Tekken 7 to be a \\"highlight\\" of the game. Rich Knight of Complex ranked Lee's appearance in Tekken: Blood Vengeance as the fifth-\\"craziest\\" Tekken series moment in 2012: \\"Lee is probably one of the weirdest characters we‚Äôve ever seen, as he‚Äôs giving random thumbs up and calling young girls his 'kittens.'\\" Charles Webb of MTV.com described Lee's extravagant mansion in the film as \\"the definition of 'swag'\\". In an official fan poll hosted by Namco in 2012, Lee was the eleventh-most requested Tekken character (9.28% of 88,280 votes) for inclusion in the crossover fighter Tekken X Street Fighter, in which he did not appear. Lee's Tekken 5 ending, which depicts him living luxuriously with Heihachi as his personal servant dressed only in swim briefs and a bow tie, has received critical attention for its perceived homoeroticism. In 2009, Michael Harradence of PlayStation Universe ranked it as the seventh-greatest Tekken ending of all time: \\"Lee enjoys the fruits of his labor and humiliates Heihachi by having him serve as his thong-wearing poolside lackey.\\" However, Cracked.com included it in their 2013 feature \\"6 Video Game Endings That Are Clearly F#@%ing With Us,\\" commenting: \\"There is not a doubt in my mind that the makers of that cutscene had to delete 40 minutes of video because the rating system would not allow for a full-length hardcore gay porno.\\" In his 2013 feature \\"10 Video Game Endings with Disturbing Implications You Totally Missed\\", Simon Gallagher of WhatCulture placed Lee's ending third: \\"All of this strange Oedipal mesh plays out as both men are wearing nothing more than speedos ... and we are encouraged to laugh at the misfortune of the fallen villain (as well as marvel at his firm, ancient body) while he is powerless to run or fight back.

He represented the Arkansas Territory as a delegate to the United States House of Representatives. Early life and education James was born in Goochland County, Virginia at his parents' plantation known as Belmont. Part of a political family, Bates was the younger brother of Frederick Bates, second governor of Missouri; and older brother of Edward Bates, who served as US Attorney General to President Abraham Lincoln. He was the ninth child of Thomas and Caroline (Woodson) Bates. He started his advanced education at Yale University but soon transferred to Princeton University, where he graduated in 1807. He read law and then went west. Career In 1807, Bates' older brother Frederick was Secretary of the Missouri Territory, based in St. Louis. James and his younger brother Edward joined Frederick in St. Louis, where James began the practice of law (Edward would follow him in this profession). When the Arkansas Territory was created in 1819, Bates moved to its capital, Arkansas Post, to become one of the first lawyers in the new territory. That fall he was elected to be the non-voting delegate for the territory in the United States House of Representatives. He served two terms, from December 21, 1819 until March 3, 1823, and chose not to stand for re-election in 1822. While serving in Congress, he had moved to the small settlement called Poke Bayou. When the town plat was laid out in 1821, it was renamed Batesville in his honor. When his congressional term ended, he returned to Batesville and resumed practicing law. He became a local judge in 1824, riding the fourth circuit through the western part of the territory. In 1828 President John Quincy Adams appointed him to the superior court of the territory. Bates served until President Jackson named judge Charles S. Bibb to the post. In 1835 he was a delegate to the constitutional convention for the new state of Arkansas. While serving as a circuit judge, Bates met a wealthy widow, Elizabeth Moore. After they married, he moved to her Moore Farm near Van Buren in Crawford County. He later served as a probate court judge and a registrar in the land office. Death Bates died in Van Buren, Arkansas, on December 26, 1846. He is interred at a private family graveyard on the Moore farm near Van Buren.

Although most of their lyrics are in English, vocalist Carmelo Orlando sings in Italian occasionally in many of their songs. They released their first two albums, Wish I Could Dream It Again and Arte Novecento, through Italian label Polyphemus. In the mid-1990s, they signed with Century Media to release their next three albums, Classica, Novembrine Waltz, and Dreams d'Azur.

The teaching pastor was Rob Bell until December, 2011 when Bell transitioned into another ministry and was succeeded by his friend and fellow Mars Hill pastor Shane Hipps. In August 2012, the church announced to its members that Kent Dobson, son of well-known church leader and speaker Ed Dobson, would assume the position of teaching pastor. Dobson was then succeeded in August 2016 by AJ Sherrill, former pastor of Trinity Grace Church: Chelsea in NYC. History Founded in February 1999, the church's services, or \\"gatherings\\", were originally celebrated in a school gym in Wyoming, Michigan. Based on the idea that worship could be stripped down to its simplest form, it quickly grew in popularity. Through word-of- mouth and the launch support of Calvary Church in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the church attracted about 1,000 visitors to their first gathering. Within a year the church had the defunct Grand Village Mall donated to them and purchased the land on which it is now located in Grandville, Michigan. After some remodeling, the 3,500 seat facility opened its doors in July 2000. In the early 2000s, the church attracted around 6,000 churchgoers to its two Sunday services and up to 50,000 downloads per week. As of 2018, this community has worked hard to establish themselves as a local church, while still offering weekly podcasts of their teachings that are listened to by thousands around the world. Their current weekly attendance is around 2500. Leadership The church's founding pastor, Rob Bell, founded the church at 28 years old, and served as Mars Hill's Teaching Pastor until 2011. On August 1, 2005, Zondervan Publishing released his first book, Velvet Elvis: Repainting the Christian Faith. His second book, Sex God, was released in 2007 through the same publishing company, and in 2008, former Lead Pastor Don Golden co-wrote a book with Bell titled \\"Jesus Wants to Save Christians: A Manifesto for the Church in Exile.\\" Upon Golden's departure, Mars Hill shifted to a team leadership structure while retaining an executive pastor, currently Brian Mucci. In 2010 Shane Hipps joined Mars Hill, splitting time with Bell as teaching pastor. Hipps had previously pastored a small Mennonite Church in Arizona, Trinity Mennonite Church. Prior to his pastoral ministry, Hipps had worked in marketing and advertising for Porsche. In March 2011 Bell released a book titled Love Wins: A Book About Heaven, Hell And The Fate Of Every Person Who Ever Lived. The church announced on 9 September 2011 that Bell would be leaving the church in pursuit of new opportunities. On 18 December 2011, Bell delivered his final message as the head pastor of Mars Hill, saying farewell to the community in which he had a critical role in launching nearly 13 years prior. Following Bell's departure, a national search was conducted and in August 2012, it was announced that Kent Dobson would take over the role as sole teaching pastor. Previously, Dobson had served as worship director during the early years of the church. In November 2015, Dobson announced he was leaving Mars Hill telling the congregation \\"being a pastor at a church is not really who I am.\\" Dobson was succeeded in August 2016 by AJ Sherrill, former pastor of Trinity Grace Church: Chelsea in NYC. Church experience The church is somewhat different from other large mega-churches in that it places little emphasis on high-tech production during its weekly gatherings. The church's sanctuary (formerly the anchor store of the mall) reflects this simplistic outlook; the sanctuary walls are a light gray with a black ceiling, the lights are low, and there is a freestanding homemade wooden cross in the sanctuary on communion Sundays. The multimedia projections are white text on a black background with no additional flair or background images. There is a belief that the gatherings should not be a performance as many megachurches are often known for, but should be the gathering of the church in worship and the place where the church is, in turn, motivated to go out and live the life of the gospel, the kingdom of God within the world. Mars Hill receives the financial tithes and offerings of the people through \\"joy boxes\\" that are located in the back of the room (versus a traditional ‚Äúpass the plate‚Äù tithing moment). The initial 25% of the offering is given away to global and local partners in order to \\"join God where He is already at work among some of the most church-forsaken peoples, places and issues of our city and world.\\" This figure is public knowledge and the individual missionaries supported are highlighted on a regular basis through preaching stories, video testimonies, and strategic updates in \\"the Sheet\\", their bi-weekly bulletin. The mission of Mars Hill Bible Church is \\"Living out the way of Jesus in missional communities, announcing the arrival of his kingdom, working for measurable change among the oppressed.\\" Narrative theology Their approach to theology is narrative in nature, seeking to view the Scripture as an unfolding drama in which the church has a unique role. Matt Krick, lead pastor at Bay Marin Community Church, and a former pastor at Mars Hill and former intern for Rob Bell, greatly influenced the theological stance of Mars Hill. He has been influenced by theologians like Brian Walsh, Sylvia Keesmaat, Richard Middleton, and Steven Bouma-Prediger. Their New Exodus Theology, which former lead pastor Don Golden brought to them, is based upon his research and study of the Exodus Narrative and the OT prophetic voices of a forthcoming new exodus, which is fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth. The New Exodus motif, in his view, can be expressed as follows. It begins in Egypt where God \\"hears the cry\\" of the oppressed. It moves to Sinai where God makes a covenant with the descendants of Abraham, giving them a \\"purpose and mission.\\" Third - Jerusalem - where Israel has a choice to be \\"indifferent\\" using forced labor to build their own kingdom or to promote a \\"kingdom of righteousness and justice.\\" Finally, Babylon is the place where there is hope for a New Exodus, that ultimately climaxes in Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. The church, in Golden's view, is called to live out the gospel in missional and communal ways, particularly promoting the care of the poor and oppressed of our world. This approach is considered by the ministry of Mars Hill to be a holistic understanding of the bible. N.T. Wright presents his five-act hermeneutic as follows. Today we find ourselves within the fifth act, called to live out the gospel in imaginative, creative, and improvisational ways. Act 1 - Creation, Act 2 - Fall, Act 3 - Israel, Act 4 - Jesus, Act 5 - Church, (NB: Other theologians, Middleton and Walsh, have add a sixth act, the eschaton or the consummation, but suggest that we still find ourselves in the midst of the fifth act.)J. Richard Middleton and Brian J Walsh, Truth Is Stranger Than It Used to Be: Biblical Faith in a Postmodern Age (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 1995), 182. Grand Village Mall Mars Hill Bible Church occupies a building which was originally a shopping mall called Grand Village Mall. The mall, including a Witmark catalog showroom as an anchor store, closed in the late 1990s and was converted into the current home of Mars Hill.

A mobile phone being charged from a car battery in Uganda. Graph (based on data from the World Bank) showing the proportion of the world's population (blue) and the absolute numbers of people (red) living on <1, <1.25, and <2 US dollars a day (2005 equivalent values) between 1981 and 2008 Poverty reduction, poverty relief, or poverty alleviation, is a set of measures, both economic and humanitarian, that are intended to permanently lift people out of poverty. Measures, like those promoted by Henry George in his economics classic Progress and Poverty, are those that raise, or are intended to raise, ways of enabling the poor to create wealth for themselves as a conduit of ending poverty forever. In modern times, various economists within the Georgism movement propose measures like the land value tax to enhance access to the natural world for all. Poverty occurs in both developing countries and developed countries. While poverty is much more widespread in developing countries, both types of countries undertake poverty reduction measures. Poverty has been historically accepted in some parts of the world as inevitable as non-industrialized economies produced very little, while populations grew almost as fast, making wealth scarce.\\"Under traditional (i.e., non-industrialized) modes of economic production, widespread poverty had been accepted as inevitable. The total output of goods and services, even if equally distributed, would still have been insufficient to give the entire population a right to an adequate standard of living by prevailing standards. With the economic productivity that resulted from industrialization, however, this ceased to be the case\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Poverty\\" Geoffrey Parker wrote that Poverty reduction occurs largely as a result of overall economic growth.\\"Ending Mass Poverty\\" by Ian V√°squez, Cato Institute, 4 September 2001Krugman, Paul, and Robin Wells. Macroeconomics. 2. New York City: Worth Publishers, 2009. Print. Food shortages were common before modern agricultural technology and in places that lack them today, such as nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides and irrigation methods. The dawn of the Industrial Revolution led to high economic growth, eliminating mass poverty in what is now considered the developed world. World GDP per person quintupled during the 20th century.Angus Maddison, see graph In 1820, 75% of humanity lived on less than a dollar a day, while in 2001 only about 20% did. Today, continued economic development is constrained by the lack of economic freedoms. Economic liberalization requires extending property rights to the poor, especially to land. Financial services, notably savings, can be made accessible to the poor through technology, such as mobile banking. Inefficient institutions, corruption, and political instability can also discourage investment. Aid and government support in health, education, and infrastructure helps growth by increasing human and physical capital. Poverty alleviation also involves improving the living conditions of people who are already poor. Aid, particularly in the medical and scientific areas, is essential in providing better lives, such as the Green Revolution and the eradication of smallpox. Problems with today's development aid include the high proportion of tied aid, which mandates receiving nations to buy products, often more expensive, originating only from donor countries. Nevertheless, some believe (Peter Singer in his book The Life You Can Save) that small changes in the ways people in affluent nations live their lives could solve world poverty. Economic Liberalization Some commentators have claimed that, due to economic liberalization, poverty in the world is rising rather than declining,\\"Global inequality may be much worse than we think\\", The Guardian, 8 April 2016 and the data provided by the World Bank, echoing that poverty is decreasing, is flawed. They also argue that extending property rights protection to the poor is one of the most important poverty reduction strategies a nation can implement. Securing property rights to land, the largest asset for most societies, is vital to their economic freedom. The World Bank concludes that increasing land rights is 'the key to reducing poverty' citing that land rights greatly increase poor people's wealth, in some cases doubling it. It is estimated that state recognition of the property of the poor would give them assets worth 40 times all the foreign aid since 1945. Although approaches varied, the World Bank said the key issues were security of tenure and ensuring land transactions were low cost. In China and India, noted reductions in poverty in recent decades have occurred mostly as a result of the abandonment of collective farming in China and the cutting of government red tape in India. New enterprises and foreign investment can be driven away by the results of inefficient institutions, corruption, the weak rule of law and excessive bureaucratic burdens. It takes two days, two bureaucratic procedures, and $280 to open a business in Canada while an entrepreneur in Bolivia must pay $2,696 in fees, wait 82 business days, and go through 20 procedures to do the same. Such costly barriers favor big firms at the expense of small enterprises where most jobs are created. In India before economic reforms, businesses had to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which was in effect a tax on business. However, ending government sponsorship of social programs is sometimes advocated as a free market principle with tragic consequences. For example, the World Bank presses poor nations to eliminate subsidies for fertilizer that many farmers cannot afford at market prices. The reconfiguration of public financing in former Soviet states during their transition to a market economy called for reduced spending on health and education, sharply increasing poverty.Transition: The First Ten Years ‚Äì Analysis and Lessons for Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union, The World Bank, Washington, DC, 2002, p. 4.\\"Study Finds Poverty Deepening in Former Communist Countries\\". New York Times. 12 October 2000.Child poverty soars in eastern Europe\\". BBC News. 11 October 2000. Trade liberalization increases total surplus of trading nations. Remittances sent to poor countries, such as India, are sometimes larger than foreign direct investment and total remittances are more than double aid flows from OECD countries. Foreign investment and export industries helped fuel the economic expansion of fast growing Asian nations.Vogel, Ezra F. 1991. The Four Little Dragons: The Spread of Industrialization in East Asia. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. However, trade rules are often unfair as they block access to richer nations' markets and ban poorer nations from supporting their industries. Processed products from poorer nations, in contrast to raw materials, get vastly higher tariffs at richer nations' ports. A University of Toronto study found the dropping of duty charges on thousands of products from African nations because of the African Growth and Opportunity Act was directly responsible for a \\"surprisingly large\\" increase in imports from Africa. Deals can sometimes be negotiated to favor the developing country such as in China, where laws compel foreign multinationals to train their future Chinese competitors in strategic industries and render themselves redundant in the long term. In Thailand, the 51 percent rule compels multinational corporations starting operations in Thailand give 51 percent control to a Thai company in a joint venture.Muscat, Robert J. 1994. The Fifth Tiger: A Study of Thai Development. Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe. Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 17 advocates respect for countries leadership to implement policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development. Capital, infrastructure and technology World GDP per capita (log scale) World GDP per capita Long run economic growth per person is achieved through increases in capital (factors that increase productivity), both human and physical, and technology. Improving human capital, in the form of health, is needed for economic growth. Nations do not necessarily need wealth to gain health. For example, Sri Lanka had a maternal mortality rate of 2% in the 1930s, higher than any nation today. It reduced it to 0.5‚Äì0.6% in the 1950s and to 0.06% today. However, it was spending less each year on maternal health because it learned what worked and what did not. Knowledge on the cost effectiveness of healthcare interventions can be elusive but educational measures to disseminate what works are available, such as the disease control priorities project. Promoting hand washing is one of the most cost effective health intervention and can cut deaths from the major childhood diseases of diarrhea and pneumonia by half. Human capital, in the form of education, is an even more important determinant of economic growth than physical capital. Deworming children costs about 50 cents per child per year and reduces non- attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition and is only a twenty-fifth as expensive to increase school attendance as by constructing schools. UN economists argue that good infrastructure, such as roads and information networks, helps market reforms to work. China claims it is investing in railways, roads, ports and rural telephones in African countries as part of its formula for economic development. It was the technology of the steam engine that originally began the dramatic decreases in poverty levels. Cell phone technology brings the market to poor or rural sections. With necessary information, remote farmers can produce specific crops to sell to the buyers that brings the best price. Such technology also helps bring economic freedom by making financial services accessible to the poor. Those in poverty place overwhelming importance on having a safe place to save money, much more so than receiving loans. Also, a large part of microfinance loans are spent on products that would usually be paid by a checking or savings account. Mobile banking addresses the problem of the heavy regulation and costly maintenance of saving accounts. Mobile financial services in the developing world, ahead of the developed world in this respect, could be worth $5 billion by 2012. Safaricom's M-Pesa launched one of the first systems where a network of agents of mostly shopkeepers, instead of bank branches, would take deposits in cash and translate these onto a virtual account on customers' phones. Cash transfers can be done between phones and issued back in cash with a small commission, making remittances safer. However, several academic studies have shown that mobile phones have only limited effect on poverty reduction when not accompanied by other basic infrastructure development. Employment and Productivity Shiva Kumar ‚Äì The importance of MDGs in redefining what are the poverty drivers Economic growth has the indirect potential to alleviate poverty, as a result of simultaneous increases in employment opportunities and labour productivity.Claire Melamed, Renate Hartwig and Ursula Grant 2011. Jobs, growth and poverty: what do we know, what don't we know, what should we know? London: Overseas Development Institute A study by researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) of 24 countries that experienced growth found that in 18 cases, poverty was alleviated. However, employment is no guarantee of escaping poverty. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that as many as 40% of workers are poor, not earning enough to keep their families above the $2 a day poverty line. For instance, in India most of the chronically poor are wage earners in formal employment owning to the fact that their jobs are insecure and low paid and offer no chance to accumulate wealth to avoid risks. This appears to be the result of a negative relationship between employment creation and increased productivity, when a simultaneous positive increase is required to reduced poverty. According to the UNRISD, increasing labour productivity appears to have a negative impact on job creation: in the 1960s, a 1% increase in output per worker was associated with a reduction in employment growth of 0.07%, by the first decade of this century the same productivity increase implies reduced employment growth by 0.54%. Increases in employment without increases in productivity leads to a rise in the number of \\"working poor\\", which is why some experts are now promoting the creation of \\"quality\\" and not \\"quantity\\" in labour market policies. This approach does highlight how higher productivity has helped reduce poverty in East Asia, but the negative impact is beginning to show. In Vietnam, for example, employment growth has slowed while productivity growth has continued. Furthermore, productivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the US, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s. The ODI study showed that other sectors were just as important in reducing unemployment, as manufacturing. The services sector is most effective at translating productivity growth into employment growth. Agriculture provides a safety net for jobs and economic buffer when other sectors are struggling. This study suggests a more nuanced understanding of economic growth and quality of life and poverty alleviation. =Helping farmers= Helping Insure Farmers in Argentina and Chile Raising farm incomes is described as the core of the antipoverty effort as three- quarters of the poor today are farmers. Estimates show that growth in the agricultural productivity of small farmers is, on average, at least twice as effective in benefiting the poorest half of a country's population as growth generated in non-agricultural sectors. For example, a 2012 study suggested that new varieties of chickpea could benefit Ethiopian farmers in future. The study assessed the potential economic and poverty impact of 11 improved chickpea varieties, released by the national agricultural research organization of Ethiopia in collaboration with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, (ICRISAT). The researchers estimated that using the varieties would bring about a total benefit of US$111 million for 30 years with consumers receiving 39% of the benefit and producers 61%. They expected the generated benefit would lift more than 0.7 million people (both producers and consumers) out of poverty. The authors concluded that further investments in the chickpea and other legume research in Ethiopia were therefore justified as a means of poverty alleviation.Macharia I, Orr A, Simtowe F and Asfaw, S., Potential economic and poverty impact of improved chickpea technologies in Ethiopia http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/chickpea/685/107. ICRISAT. Downloaded 26 January 2014. Improving water management is an effective way to help reduce poverty among farmers. With better water management, they can improve productivity and potentially move beyond subsistence-level farming. During the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, for example, irrigation was a key factor in unlocking Asia's agricultural potential and reducing poverty. Between 1961 and 2002, the irrigated area almost doubled, as governments sought to achieve food security, improve public welfare and generate economic growth. In South Asia, cereal production rose by 137% from 1970 to 2007. This was achieved with only 3% more land.Mukherji, A. Revitalising Asia's Irrigation: To sustainably meet tomorrow's food needs 2009, IWMI and FAO The International Water Management Institute in Colombo, Sri Lanka aims to improve the management of land and water resources for food, livelihoods and the environment. One project its scientists worked on demonstrates the impact that improving water management in agriculture can have. The study, funded by the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, initially upgraded and irrigated the irrigation system on the Walawe Left Bank, Sri Lanka, in 1997. In 2005, irrigation was extended to a further area. An analysis of the whole area was carried out in 2007 and 2008. This study found that access to irrigation provided families with opportunities to diversify their livelihood activities and potentially increase their incomes. For example, people with land could reliably grow rice or vegetables instead of working as labourers or relying on rainfall to water their crops. Those without land could benefit by working within new inland fisheries. Within the project's control area, 57% of households were below the poverty line in 2002 compared with 43% in 2007.Water, poverty and equity. Water Issue Brief, Issue 8, 2010. Building opportunities for self-sufficiency Making employment opportunities available is just as important as increasing income and access to basic needs. Poverty activist Paul Polak has based his career around doing both at once, creating companies that employ the poor while creating \\"radically\\" affordable goods. In his book Out of Poverty he argues that traditional poverty eradication strategies have been misguided and fail to address underlying problems. He lists \\"Three Great Poverty Eradication Myths\\": that we can donate people out of poverty, that national economic growth will end poverty, and that Big Business, operating as it does now, will end poverty. Economic models which lead to national growth and more big business will not necessarily lead to more opportunities for self-sufficiency. However, businesses designed with a social goal in mind, such as micro finance banks, may be able to make a difference. Growth vs. state intervention: comparative perspective in China, India, Brazil A 2012 World Bank research article, \\"A Comparative Perspective on Poverty Reduction in Brazil, China, and India,\\" looked at the three nations' strategies and their relative challenges and successes. During their reform periods, all three have reduced their poverty rates, but through a different mix of approaches. The report used a common poverty line of $1.25 per person, per day, at purchasing parity power for consumption in 2008. Using that metric and evaluating the period between 1981 and 2005, the poverty rate in China dropped from 84% to 16%; India from 60% to 42%; and Brazil from 17% to 8%. The report sketches an overall scorecard of the countries on the two basic dimensions of pro-poor growth and pro-poor policy intervention: \\"China clearly scores well on the pro-poor growth side of the card, but neither Brazil nor India do; in Brazil's case for lack of growth and in India's case for lack of poverty-reducing growth. Brazil scores well on the social policies side, but China and India do not; in China's case progress has been slow in implementing new social policies more relevant to the new market economy (despite historical advantages in this area, inherited from the past regime) and in India's case the bigger problems are the extent of capture of the many existing policies by non-poor groups and the weak capabilities of the state for delivering better basic public services.\\" Aid=Welfare= Aid in its simplest form is a basic income grant, a form of social security periodically providing citizens with money. In pilot projects in Namibia, where such a program pays just $13 a month, people were able to pay tuition fees, raising the proportion of children going to school by 92%, child malnutrition rates fell from 42% to 10% and economic activity grew 10%. Aid could also be rewarded based on doing certain requirements. Conditional Cash Transfers, widely credited as a successful anti-poverty program, is based on actions such as enrolling children in school or receiving vaccinations. In Mexico, for example, the country with the largest such program, dropout rates of 16- to 19-year-olds in rural area dropped by 20% and children gained half an inch in height. Initial fears that the program would encourage families to stay at home rather than work to collect benefits have proven to be unfounded. Instead, there is less excuse for neglectful behavior as, for example, children are prevented from begging on the streets instead of going to school because it could result in suspension from the program. Welfare states have an effect on poverty reduction. Currently modern, expansive welfare states that ensure economic opportunity, independence and security in a near universal manner are still the exclusive domain of the developed nations.Esping- Andersen, G. (1990). The three worlds of welfare capitalism. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. commonly constituting at least 20% of GDP, with the largest Scandinavian welfare states constituting over 40% of GDP.Barr, N. (2004). The economics of the welfare state. New York: Oxford University Press (USA). These modern welfare states, which largely arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, seeing their greatest expansion in the mid 20th century, and have proven themselves highly effective in reducing relative as well as absolute poverty in all analyzed high-income OECD countries. Philosopher Thomas Pogge is a supporter of gathering funds for the poor by using a sort of Global Resources Dividend. =Development aid= Aid for Trade Global Review 2017 Frank Matsaert, Vanessa Erogbogbo and Amelia Kyambadde A major proportion of aid from donor nations is 'tied', mandating that a receiving nation buy products originating only from the donor country. This can be harmful economically. For example, Eritrea is forced to spend aid money on foreign goods and services to build a network of railways even though it is cheaper to use local expertise and resources. Money from the United States to fight AIDS requires it be spent on U.S brand name drugs that can cost up to $15,000 a year compared to $350 a year for generics from other countries. Only Norway, Denmark, Netherlands and Britain have stopped tying their aid. Some people disagree with aid when looking at where the development aid money from NGOs and other funding is going. Funding tends to be used in a selective manner where the highest ranked health problem is the only thing treated, rather than funding basic health care development. This can occur due to a foundation's underlying political aspects to their development plan, where the politics outweigh the science of disease. The diseases then treated are ranked by their prevalence, morbidity, risk of mortality, and the feasibility of control. Through this ranking system, the disease that cause the most mortality and are most easily treated are given the funding. The argument occurs because once these people are treated, they are sent back to the conditions that led to the disease in the first place. By doing this, money and resources from aid can be wasted when people are re-infected. This was seen in the Rockefeller Foundation's Hookworm campaign in Mexico in the 1920s, where people were treated for hookworm and then contracted the disease again once back in the conditions from which they came. To prevent this, money could be spent on teaching citizens of the developing countries health education, basic sanitation, and providing adequate access to prevention methods and medical infrastructure. Not only would NGO money be better spent, but it would be more sustainable. These arguments suggest that the NGO development aid should be used for prevention and determining root causes rather acting upon political endeavours and treating for the sake of saying they helped. Some think tanks and NGOs have argued that Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality, either because it is conditioned with the implementation of harmful economic policies in the recipient countries,Haiti's rice farmers and poultry growers have suffered greatly since trade barriers were lowered in 1994. By Jane Regan or because it is tied to the importing of products from the donor country over cheaper alternatives. Sometimes foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,US and Foreign Aid, GlobalIssues.org and critics also argue that some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials, and that higher aid levels erode the quality of governance. Policy becomes much more oriented toward what will get more aid money than it does towards meeting the needs of the people. Problems with the aid system and not aid itself are that the aid is excessively directed towards the salaries of consultants from donor countries, the aid is not spread properly, neglecting vital, less publicized area such as agriculture, and the aid is not properly coordinated among donors, leading to a plethora of disconnected projects rather than unified strategies. Supporters of aid argue that these problems may be solved with better auditing of how the aid is used. Immunization campaigns for children, such as against polio, diphtheria and measles have saved millions of lives. Aid from non-governmental organizations may be more effective than governmental aid; this may be because it is better at reaching the poor and better controlled at the grassroots level. As a point of comparison, the annual world military spending is over $1 trillion. =Debt relief= One of the proposed ways to help poor countries that emerged during the 1980s has been debt relief. Given that many less developed nations have gotten themselves into extensive debt to banks and governments from the rich nations, and given that the interest payments on these debts are often more than a country can generate per year in profits from exports, cancelling part or all of these debts may allow poor nations \\"to get out of the hole\\". If poor countries do not have to spend so much on debt payments, they can use the money instead for priorities which help reduce poverty such as basic health- care and education. Many nations began offering services, such as free health care even while overwhelming the health care infrastructure, because of savings that resulted from the rounds of debt relief in 2005.  The role of education and skill-building as precursors to economic development  \\"Working together to end poverty one nail at a time,\\" T-shirt, 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom Universal public education has some role in preparing youth for basic academic skills and perhaps many trade skills, as well. Apprenticeships clearly build needed trade skills. If modest amounts of cash and land can be combined with a modicum of agricultural skills in a temperate climate, subsistence can give way toward modest societal wealth. As has been mentioned, education for women will allow for reduced family size‚Äîan important poverty reduction event in its own right. While all components mentioned above are necessary, the portion of education pertaining to the variety of skills needed to build and maintain the infrastructure of a developing (moving out of poverty) society: building trades; plumbing; electrician; well-drilling; farm and transport mechanical skills (and others) are clearly needed in large numbers of individuals, if the society is to move out of poverty or subsistence. Yet, many well-developed western economies are moving strongly away from the essential apprenticeships and skill training which affords a clear vocational path out of modern urban poverty. =Microloans= One of the most popular of the new technical tools for economic development and poverty reduction are microloans made famous in 1976 by the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh. The idea is to loan small amounts of money to farmers or villages so these people can obtain the things they need to increase their economic rewards. A small pump costing only $50 could make a very big difference in a village without the means of irrigation. A specific example is the Thai government's People's Bank which is making loans of $100 to $300 to help farmers buy equipment or seeds, help street vendors acquire an inventory to sell, or help others set up small shops. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Vietnam country programme supports operations in 11 poor provinces. Between 2002 and 2010 around 1,000 saving and credit groups (SCGs) were formed, with over 17,000 members; these SCGs increased their access to microcredit for taking up small-scale farm activities.RIDP, PCR and Validation, 2010. Empowering women Empowering Women - Panel Discussion on the occasion of the International Women‚Äôs Day The empowerment of women has relatively recently become a significant area of discussion with respect to development and economics; however it is often regarded as a topic that only addresses and primarily deals with gender inequality. Because women and men experience poverty differently, they hold dissimilar poverty reduction priorities and are affected differently by development interventions and poverty reduction strategies.Zuckerman, Elaine. 2002 \\"Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Gender\\". Berlin, Germany: Conference on Sustainable Poverty Reduction and PRSPs. In response to the socialized phenomenon known as the feminization of poverty, policies aimed to reduce poverty have begun to address poor women separately from poor men. In addition to engendering poverty and poverty interventions, a correlation between greater gender equality and greater poverty reduction and economic growth has been illustrated by research through the World Bank, suggesting that promoting gender equality through empowerment of women is a qualitatively significant poverty reduction strategy.World Bank. 2001a \\"Engendering Development: Through Gender Equality in Rights, Resources, and Voice\\". Policy Research Report. Oxford University Press. =Gender equality= Addressing gender equality and empowering women are necessary steps in overcoming poverty and furthering development as supported by the human development and capabilities approach and the Millennium Development Goals.U.N. General Assembly, 55th Session. \\"United Nations Millennium Declaration.\\" (A/55/L.2). 8 September 2000. Disparities in the areas of education, mortality rates, health and other social and economic indicators impose large costs on well-being and health of the poor, which diminishes productivity and the potential to reduce poverty. The limited opportunities of women in most societies restrict their aptitude to improve economic conditions and access services to enhance their well-being. Mainstreaming gender Gender mainstreaming, the concept of placing gender issues into the mainstream of society, was established by the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women as a global strategy for promoting gender equality; the UN conference emphasized the necessity to ensure that gender equality is a primary goal in all areas of social and economic development, which includes the discussion of poverty and its reduction. Correspondingly, the World Bank also created objectives to address poverty with respect to the different effects on women.Muwanigwa, Virginia. 2002. \\"Gender Considerations in Poverty Alleviation\\". Harere, Zimbabwe. One important goal was the revision of laws and administrative practices to ensure women's equal rights and access to economic resources. Mainstreaming strengthens women's active involvement in poverty alleviation by linking women's capabilities and contributions with macro-economic issues. The underlying purpose of both the UN and World Bank policies speaks to the use of discussion of gender issues in the promotion of gender equality and reduction of poverty. =Strategies to empower women= Several platforms have been adopted and reiterated across many organizations in support of the empowerment of women with the specific aim of reducing poverty. Encouraging more economic and political participation by women increases financial independence from and social investment in the government, both of which are critical to pulling society out of poverty.Narayan, Deepa and Nicholas Stern. 2002. \\"Empowerment and Poverty Reduction: A Sourcebook\\", pp. 1‚Äì272. Washington DC: World Bank. Economic participation Women's economic empowerment, or ensuring that women and men have equal opportunities to generate and manage income, is an important step to enhancing their development within the household and in society.UNICEF. 2007. \\"Equality in Employment,\\" in The State of the World's Children, pp. 36‚Äì49. New York: UNICEF. Additionally, women play an important economic role in addressing poverty experienced by children. By increasing female participation in the labor force, women are able to contribute more effectively to economic growth and income distribution since having a source of income elevates their financial and social status. However, women's entry into the paid labor force does not necessarily equate to reduction of poverty; the creation of decent employment opportunities and movement of women from the informal work sector to the formal labor market are key to poverty reduction.Chen, Martha, Joann Vanek, Francie Lund, James Heintz with Renana Jhabvala, and Christine Bonner. 2005. \\"Employment, Gender, and Poverty,\\" in Progress of the World's Women, pp. 36‚Äì57. New York: United Nations Development Fund for Women. Other ways to encourage female participation in the workforce to promote decline of poverty include providing childcare services, increasing educational quality and opportunities, and furthering entrepreneurship for women. Protection of property rights is a key element in economically empowering women and fostering economic growth overall for both genders. With legitimate claims to land, women gain bargaining power, which can be applied to their lives outside of and within the household.Agarwal, Bina. 1994. \\"Land Rights for Women: Making the Case,\\" in A Field of One's Own: Gender and Land Rights in South Asia, pp. 1‚Äì50. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press. The ability and opportunity for women to lawfully own land also decreases the asset gap that exists between women and men, which promotes gender equality. Political participation Political participation is supported by organizations such as IFAD as one pillar of gender equality and women's empowerment. Sustainable economic growth requires poor people to have influence on the decisions that affect their lives; specifically strengthening women's voices in the political process builds social independence and greater consideration of gender issues in policy.IFAD. 2007. \\"Strategy and Approach: Gender equality and women's empowerment\\". 21 Mar. 2011. . In order to promote women's political empowerment, the United Nations Development Programme advocated for several efforts: increase women in public office; strengthen advocacy of women's organizations; ensure fair legal protection; and provide equivalent health and education. Fair political representation and participation enable women to lobby for more female-specific poverty reduction policies and programs. Good institutions Efficient institutions that are not corrupt and obey the rule of law make and enforce good laws that provide security to property and businesses. Efficient and fair governments would work to invest in the long-term interests of the nation rather than plunder resources through corruption. Researchers at UC Berkeley developed what they called a \\"Weberianness scale\\" which measures aspects of bureaucracies and governments which Max Weber described as most important for rational-legal and efficient government over 100 years ago. Comparative research has found that the scale is correlated with higher rates of economic development. With their related concept of good governance World Bank researchers have found much the same: Data from 150 nations have shown several measures of good governance (such as accountability, effectiveness, rule of law, low corruption) to be related to higher rates of economic development. Funds from aid and natural resources are often diverted into private hands and then sent to banks overseas as a result of graft. If Western banks rejected stolen money, says a report by Global Witness, ordinary people would benefit \\"in a way that aid flows will never achieve\\". The report asked for more regulation of banks as they have proved capable of stanching the flow of funds linked to terrorism, money-laundering or tax evasion. Some, like Thomas Pogge, call for a global organization that can manage some form of Global Resources Dividend, which could evolve in complexity with time. Examples of good governance leading to economic development and poverty reduction include Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, and Vietnam, which tend to have a strong government, called a hard state or development state. These \\"hard states\\" have the will and authority to create and maintain policies that lead to long-term development that helps all their citizens, not just the wealthy. Multinational corporations are regulated so that they follow reasonable standards for pay and labor conditions, pay reasonable taxes to help develop the country, and keep some of the profits in the country, reinvesting them to provide further development. The United Nations Development Program published a report in April 2000 which focused on good governance in poor countries as a key to economic development and overcoming the selfish interests of wealthy elites often behind state actions in developing nations. The report concludes that \\"Without good governance, reliance on trickle-down economic development and a host of other strategies will not work.\\"United Nations Development Report. 2000. Overcoming Human Poverty: UNDP Poverty Report 2000. New York: United Nations Publications. Despite the promise of such research several questions remain, such as where good governance comes from and how it can be achieved. The comparative analysis of one sociologist suggests that broad historical forces have shaped the likelihood of good governance. Ancient civilizations with more developed government organization before colonialism, as well as elite responsibility, have helped create strong states with the means and efficiency to carry out development policies today. On the other hand, strong states are not always the form of political organization most conducive to economic development. Other historical factors, especially the experiences of colonialism for each country, have intervened to make a strong state and/or good governance less likely for some countries, especially in Africa. Another important factor that has been found to affect the quality of institutions and governance was the pattern of colonization (how it took place) and even the identity of colonizing power. International agencies may be able to promote good governance through various policies of intervention in developing nations as indicated in a few African countries, but comparative analysis suggests it may be much more difficult to achieve in most poor nations around the world. Other approaches Another approach that has been proposed for alleviating poverty is Fair Trade which advocates the payment of an above market price as well as social and environmental standards in areas related to the production of goods. The efficacy of this approach to poverty reduction is controversial. Community and monetary economist Thomas H. Greco, Jr. has argued that the mainstream global economy with its debt-based currency has built-in structural incentives that create poverty through keeping money scarce. Greco points to the success of modern barter clubs and historical local currencies such as the W√∂rgl Experiment at revitalizing stagnant local economies, and calls for the creation of community currency as a means to reduce or eliminate poverty.Thomas Greco, Jr., Money Understanding and Creating Alternatives to Legal Tender, Chelsea Green Publishing, 2001. . The Toronto Dollar is an example of a local currency oriented towards reducing poverty. Toronto Dollars are sold and redeemed in such a way that raise funds which are then given as grants to local charities, primarily ones oriented towards reducing poverty.Barbara Turnbull, \\"Milestone for the \`Toronto Dollar'\\", Toronto Star, 22 Mar. 2008. Toronto Dollars also provide a means to create an incentive for welfare recipients to work: Toronto dollars can be given as gifts to welfare recipients who perform volunteer work for charitable and non-profit organizations, and these gifts do not affect welfare benefits.Mark Herpel, \\"The Toronto Dollar: Community Alternative Dollar\\", California Chronicle, 18 Apr. 2008. Some have argued for radical economic change in the system. There are several fundamental proposals for restructuring existing economic relations, and many of their supporters argue that their ideas would reduce or even eliminate poverty entirely if they were implemented. Such proposals have been put forward by both left-wing and right-wing groups: socialism, communism, anarchism, libertarianism, binary economics and participatory economics, among others. Inequality can be reduced by progressive tax. In law, there has been a move to establish the absence of poverty as a human right. The IMF and member countries have produced Poverty Reduction Strategy papers or PRSPs.Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSP) In his book The End of Poverty,The End of Poverty by JEFFREY D. SACHS for time.com prominent economist Jeffrey Sachs laid out a plan to eradicate global poverty by 2025. Following his recommendations, international organizations such as the Global Solidarity Network are working to help eradicate poverty worldwide with intervention in the areas of housing, food, education, basic health, agricultural inputs, safe drinking water, transportation and communications. The Poor People's Economic Human Rights Campaign is an organization in the United States working to secure freedom from poverty for all by organizing the poor themselves. The Campaign believes that a human rights framework, based on the value of inherent dignity and worth of all persons, offers the best means by which to organize for a political solution to poverty. =Climate change adaptation= The increase in extreme weather events, linked to climate change, and resulting disasters is expected to continue. Disasters are a major cause of impoverishment and can reverse progress towards poverty reduction.Andrew Shepherd, Tom Mitchell, Kirsty Lewis, Amanda Lenhardt, Lindsey Jones, Lucy Scott and Robert Muir-Wood (2013) \\"The geography of poverty, disasters and climate extremes in 2030\\" London: Overseas Development Institute A report by the world bank shows that poor persons are most prone to climate disasters. It is predicted that by 2030, 325 million (plus) extremely poor people will be living in the 49 most hazard prone countries. Most of these are located in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. A researcher at a leading global think-tank, the Overseas Development Institute, suggests that far more effort should be done to better coordinate and integrate poverty reduction strategies with climate change adaptation.Martin Prowse, Natasha Grist and Cheikh Sourang (2009) \\"Closing the gap between climate adaptation and poverty reduction frameworks\\" London: Overseas Development Institute The two issues are argued to be currently only dealt with in parallel as most poverty reduction strategy papers ignore climate change adaptation altogether, while National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) likewise do not deal directly with poverty reduction. Adaptation-poverty linkages were found to be strongest in NAPAs from sub-Saharan Africa LDCs. =Bicycles= Man on bike with chickens, Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3‚Äì10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. The bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate poverty in poor nations. =Millennium Development Goals = Eradication of extreme poverty and hunger by 2015 is one of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). In addition to broader approaches, the Sachs Report (for the UN Millennium Project) proposes a series of \\"quick wins\\", approaches identified by development experts which would cost relatively little but could have a major constructive effect on world poverty. The quick wins are: * Access to information on sexual and reproductive health. * Action against domestic violence. * Appointing government scientific advisors in every country. * Deworming school children in affected areas. * Drugs for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. * Eliminating school fees. * Ending user fees for basic health care in developing countries. * Free school meals for schoolchildren. * Legislation for women's rights, including rights to property. * Planting trees. * Providing soil nutrients to farmers in sub- Saharan Africa. * Providing mosquito nets. * Access to electricity, water and sanitation. * Supporting breast-feeding. * Training programs for community health in rural areas. * Upgrading slums, and providing land for public housing. = Sustainable Development Goals = Sustainable Development Goals The first of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) calls for an end to poverty by 2030 and seeks to ensure social protection for the poor and supporting people affected by climate-related extreme events. As the decade that began in 2002, the percentage of the world's population living under the poverty line reduced by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. If the growth rate during those 10 years had prevailed over the next 15 years, it would be possible to decrease the rate of extreme poverty in the world to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming the growth will benefit all income groups of the population on an equal footing. However, if the growth rate was over a longer period of 20 years, the rate of prevalent global poverty is likely to be about 6 per cent. In other words, the eradication of extreme poverty will require a significant change from its historical growth rates. =Poverty targeting= Sustainable Development Goal 1 Poverty reduction requires governments to identify and reach out to extremely poor and help them out of poverty through sustainable measures. One such approach supported by many international donors is of targeted poverty reduction programmes. There are several poverty targeting methods through which poor communities are identified and tracked for poverty reduction programmes. For instance, one common method of poverty targeting is 'means testing' that uses a certain income or expenditure threshold for an individual or the a household to be considered as poor and eligible for support. =Global initiatives to end hunger and undernutrition= An important part of the fight against poverty are efforts to end hunger and achieve food security. In April 2012, the Food Assistance Convention was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 Copenhagen Consensus recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against malaria and AIDS. The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved Sustainable Development Goals. In particular Goal 2: Zero Hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. In 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the impact of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the right to food. The partnership Compact2025, led by IFPRI with the involvement of UN organisations, NGOs and private foundations develops and disseminates evidence-based advice to politicians and other decision-makers aimed at ending hunger and undernutrition in the coming 10 years, by 2025. The EndingHunger campaign is an online communication campaign aimed at raising awareness of the hunger problem. It has many worked through viral videos depicting celebrities voicing their anger about the large number of hungry people in the world. Another initiative focused on improving the hunger situation by improving nutrition is the Scaling up Nutrition movement (SUN). Started in 2010, this movement of people from governments, civil society, the United Nations, donors, businesses and researchers publishes a yearly progress report on the changes in their 57 partner countries. = Poverty reduction in Taiwan = In spite of the intensive reduction strategies deployed in the previous two decades, poverty levels in several countries of the world has not been reduced. Recent research has demonstrated that the low wage levels of the needy families have risen gradually, although in some scenarios they have declined. While wage level is the main median pointer of welfare, such results suggest that past poverty reduction procedures have not been precise. Unless suitable reduction procedures are formulated and implemented in the near future, rustic poverty will probably be a real issue for quite some long time. Families are determined to be low-pay if their monthly income does not surpass the evaluated monthly minimum set by every city or region. To meet the family's essential needs (shelter, food, clothing, and education) in Taipei, one would need to have $337 every month. This sum changes relying upon the city's way of life; for instance, one would just need to have $171 every month to live in Kinmen County. Sustained economic growth is noted as the main propelling agent for Poverty Reduction in Taiwan. While internal FDI has no noteworthy effect on the mean wage of poor people, outward FDI from Taiwan in the previous two decades appears to have adversely affected the poorest 20% of the populace. Poverty in Taiwan has nearly been eliminated, with under 1 percent of the populace considered as poor or earning the low-level pay. This implies more than 99 percent of the populace appreciates the advantages of Taiwan's economic flourishing and extraordinarily enhanced personal satisfaction. Beside lowly-paid families, the government offers support to other individuals, for example, the elderly and the incapacitated, who cannot work. During 1980 to 1999 Taiwanese government developed a program called National Health Insurance program. NHI mainly provides economically disadvantaged people with quality healthcare at an affordable price. July 1993, the government of Taiwan started giving a monthly sponsorship to elderly people. People beyond 65 years old whose normal family salary is not exactly, or equivalent to, 1.5 times the base monthly costs are fit to get a monthly sponsorship of $174. Private transfers also play an important role in Taiwan for antipoverty according to the date Taiwan provided to the Luxembourg Income Studies, the results indicates the private transfer has greater impact than public transfers in terms of proving welfare state. In 1999, the government of Taiwan spent US$5.08 billion on social welfare projects and offered numerous sorts of assistance to people and families from low-pay sets. Notwithstanding money, assistance to get employment is given to the breadwinners in families, alongside educational guide for school-age children and well-being programs for women and children. In addition, there are additionally community associations, scholastic organizations, and private establishments arranged by government offices to help needy people. In principle, Taiwan is currently a liberal and elections based society. Hence social versatility ought to be the standard. Notably, as per an investigation of extra cash in Taiwan by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, families with the most astounding dispensable salaries number 2.6 people, while families with the least discretionary cash flow number 4.7 people. With rising costs of simple commodities and privatization of the training market, economically distraught families will end up in an undeniably hard position to educate their own children. However, this type of social welfare will significantly lower the Taiwan's revenue. Due to the slow economic development in the past years, this method will no longer close the income inequality or reduce the unemployment rate effectively in the future. =Business solutions to poverty= A poor child walks with one sandal The concept of business serving the world's poorest four billion or so people has been popular since CK Prahalad introduced the idea through his book Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits in 2004, among many business corporations and business schools.C.K. Prahalad (2004). Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty Through Profits Published by Prentice Hall, NJ Kash Rangan, John Quelch, and other faculty members at the Global Poverty Project at Harvard Business School \\"believe that in pursuing its own self-interest in opening and expanding the BoP market, business can make a profit while serving the poorest of consumers and contributing to development.\\" According to Rangan \\"For business, the bulk of emerging markets worldwide is at the bottom of the pyramid so it makes good business sense ‚Äì not a sense of do-gooding ‚Äì to go after it.\\". In their 2013 book, \\"The Business Solution to Poverty,\\" Paul Polak and Mal Warwick directly addressed the criticism leveled against Prahalad's concept.Paul Polak and Mal Malwick (2013). \\"The Business Solution to Poverty: Designing Products and Services for Three Billion New Customers\\" Published by Berrett-Koehler Publishers They noted that big business often failed to create products that actually met the needs and desires of the customers who lived at the bottom-of-the-pyramid. Their answer was that a business that wanted to succeed in that market had to spend time talking to and understanding those customers. Polak had previously promoted this approach in his previous book, \\"Out of Poverty,\\" that described the work of International Development Enterprises (iDE), which he had formed in 1982.Paul Polak (2009), \\"Out of Poverty: What Works When Traditional Approaches Fail\\" Published by Berrett-Koehler Publishers Polak and Warwick provided practical advice: a product needed to affect at least a billion people (i.e., have universal appeal), it had to be able to be delivered to customers living where there was not a FedEx office or even a road, and it had to be \\"radically affordable\\" to attract someone who earned less than $2 a day. GDP (nominal) per capita.Based on the IMF data. If no data was available for a country from IMF, data from the World Bank is used. Rather than encouraging multinational businesses to meet the needs of the poor, some organizations such as iDE, the World Resources Institute, and the United Nations Development Programme began to focus on working directly with helping bottom-of-the- pyramid populations become local, small-scale entrepreneurs.Dalglish C. and M. Tonelli 2016. Entrepreneurship at the Bottom of the Pyramid. New York: Routledge. Since so much of this population is engaged in agriculture, these NGOs have addressed market gaps that enable small-scale (i.e., plots less than 2 hectares) farmers to increase their production and find markets for their harvests. This is done by increasing the availability of farming equipment (e.g., pumps, tillers, seeders) and better quality seed and fertilizer, as well as expanding access for training in farming best practices (e.g., crop rotation). Creating entrepreneurs through microfinance can produce unintended outcomes: Some entrepreneurial borrowers become informal intermediaries between microfinance initiatives and poorer micro-entrepreneurs. Those who more easily qualify for microfinance split loans into smaller credit to even poorer borrowers. Informal intermediation ranges from casual intermediaries at the good or benign end of the spectrum to 'loan sharks' at the professional and sometimes criminal end of the spectrum. Milton Friedman argues that the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits only, thus, it needs to be examined whether business in BoP markets is capable of achieving the dual objective of making a profit while serving the poorest of consumers and contributing to development? Erik Simanis has reported that the model has a fatal flaw. According to Erik \\"Despite achieving healthy penetration rates of 5% to 10% in four test markets, for instance, Procter & Gamble couldn't generate a competitive return on its Pur water-purification powder after launching the product on a large scale in 2001...DuPont ran into similar problems with a venture piloted from 2006 to 2008 in Andhra Pradesh, India, by its subsidiary Solae, a global manufacturer of soy protein ... Because the high costs of doing business among the very poor demand a high contribution per transaction, companies must embrace the reality that high margins and price points aren't just a top-of-the-pyramid phenomenon; they're also a necessity for ensuring sustainable businesses at the bottom of the pyramid.\\" Marc Gunther states that \\"The bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market leader, arguably, is Unilever ... Its signature BOP product is Pureit, a countertop water-purification system sold in India, Africa and Latin America. It's saving lives, but it's not making money for shareholders.\\" This leaves the ideal of eradicating poverty through profits or with a good business sense ‚Äì not a sense of do-gooding rather questionable. Others have noted that relying on BoP consumers to choose to purchase items that increase their incomes is naive. Poor consumers may spend their income disproportionately on events or goods and services that offer short-term benefits rather than invest in things that could change their lives in the long-term.

These compounds have properties intermediate between covalent hydrides and saline hydrides. Hydrides are chemical compounds that contain a metal and hydrogen acting as a negative ion. Properties Borderline hydrides exhibit bonding characteristics between ionic and covalent bond types. A specific examples of a borderline hydride CuH, copper hydride, that appears as a spongy reddish-brown substance is a moderate reducing agent. It will catalytically oxidize hypophosphorous acid to phosphorous acid at room temperature, and it gives off hydrogen gas when subjected to heat. ZnH2 is also a solid at room temperature that breaks down at 90 ¬∞C, but even left alone decomposes over several days to zinc metal and hydrogen gas. Hydrogen telluride (H2Te) and hydrogen selenide (H2Se) are both borderline hydrides of high volatility that produce strong, unpleasant odors.  Examples  * (CuH)n copper hydride * (ZnH2)n zinc(II) hydride * HgH2 mercury(II) hydride * TlH3 thallium hydride Synthesis Borderline hydrides are most commonly formed via the acidification or reduction of metal salts. For instance, copper hydride is formed by reacting copper sulphate and hypophosphorous acid at about 70 ¬∞C, forming a yellow precipitate that soon turns red-brown. Zinc hydride, ZnH2, can be formed by the reduction of either a zinc halide or dimethylzinc. ZnH2 synthesis via reduction of zinc iodide Alternative definition An example of the classical dihydride M(H)2 (left) compared to the non-classical M(H2) dihydrogen bonding (right). A more recent definition of borderline hydrides refers to hydrides that exist between classic and non- classic dihydrides. The classic form is the dihydride M(H)2 configuration, where the metal is bound to two free hydrogen atoms. The non-classic form contains two hydrogen atoms bound to a central metal atom with an Œ∑2-H2 hapticity, indicating that a single coordination point on the metal atom bonds to two contiguous atoms from another molecule, in this case H2. A well-known example of this is from the first such molecule to be synthesized with a coordinated hydrogen ligand (dihydrogen complex): W(CO)3(PPri3)2(Œ∑2-H2). Classic dihydrides containing the dihydride M-(H)2 ligands are typically found as a tautomer with the non-classical dihydrogen complexes containing a M-(Œ∑2-H2) group. Borderline hydrides exist with a bond character somewhere between the classical and non-classical hydrides. Those that are thermally unstable exhibit stretching frequencies ŒΩHH greater than 2150 cm1 as a result of poor electron donation from the metal center. An electron dense metal center will yield hydride with a ŒΩHH less than 2060 cm1, while anything between is considered to be in the borderline region. Kubas, et al. state that a stretching frequency of 2090 cm1 is within the bounds of stable H2 complexes while 2060 cm1 is right on the borderline between dihydrogen and dihydrides.

It is an adaptation of the 1935 fantasy novel The Circus of Dr. Lao by Charles G. Finney. It details the visit of a magical circus to a small town in the southwest United States, and the effects that visit has on the people of the town. The novel was adapted by Charles Beaumont.  Plot  Dr. Lao (Randall) rides a golden donkey into the small town of Abalone, Arizona and visits Edward Cunningham's newspaper to place a large ad for his traveling circus, which will play for two nights only. Though quiet, Abalone is not peaceful. Wealthy rancher Clinton Stark (Arthur O'Connell) has inside information that a railroad is coming to town and plans to buy the entire township while the land is cheap. Stark arrives at the newspaper offices to smugly confront Cunningham over a recent editorial in opposition to Stark's plan. Lao, patiently waiting to place his ad, silently listens to the meeting. Another of Stark's opponents is Angela Benedict (Eden), a local widow who serves as librarian and schoolteacher. Cunningham is open about his affection for her, embarrassing her in a visit to the library to research Lao's background; she suppresses her reciprocal feelings. That night, a town hall meeting is held in the library. Before the meeting, Stark quietly complains to the mayor that \\"every time I bet on weakness, corruption and fallibility, I want to lose . . .but I always win.\\" As the meeting progresses, Stark announces that its 16-mile long water supply pipe is decaying and would be too expensive to replace. He then offers to buy the entire town. Arguing against the offer, Cunningham introduces everyone to George G. George, a Navajo Indian who lives in \\"another city, close to our own\\", and points out that the lives of its residents depend on Abalone's continued existence. Stark reluctantly allows the townspeople to ponder their choice \\"until Friday night\\" and the meeting is adjourned. The next day, Cunningham visits the circus site, encountering the Abominable Snowman and Merlin, the fabled magician. Cunningham confronts Lao with the fact that Lao's alleged hometown vanished centuries before. Lao deflects Cunningham's questions, about himself and the large circus, which arrived without wagons and announces that he is \\"a major mystery!\\" The newspaperman \\"leaves in a cloud of befuddlement,\\" but accepting that Lao is \\"a nice guy.\\" Later, as Lao puts up posters advertising his circus, Angela's young son Mike learns that the mysterious wanderer is 7,321 years old. Mike takes this statement, as well as Lao's displays of extra-human capabilities, without doubt. The circus opens and is attended by the entire town. Lao uses his many faces to offer his wisdom to the visitors, only some of whom heed the advice. Angela Benedict is fascinated by a sensuous and seductive dance of Pan, the God of Joy, who wears the face of Cunningham. Stark visits The Great Serpent, who points out that Stark is himself in a form of \\"cage.\\" Medusa turns the disbelieving Kate Lindquist to stone; her long-suffering husband excuses this by claiming it to be an \\"arthritis attack . . .she's had them before.\\" Lao calls an end to the proceedings as the guests flee, then Merlin appears, restoring the woman to life, her experience causing a much-needed reformation in her character. Later that night, Mike visits Lao and tries to get a job, displaying his novice juggling and conjuring skills. Lao instead offers some advice and observations about the world, which Mike doesn't understand, and Lao claims to not understand either. During the evening's presentation, Stark's henchmen had destroyed the newspaper office; this is discovered by Cunningham and his assistant, who go off to become drunk, as Lao stands in the nearby shadows. Angela is kept awake that night, plagued by the music that Pan had played, while nobody else can hear it. At dawn, intoxicated, the newspapermen are astonished to discover that their office has been fully restored and the press is operating. Attributing it to Lao, they rush to produce a short edition of the paper, which Cunningham personally delivers to Stark in the morning. When he visits the circus site, Lao offers encouragement and calls on Cunningham to keep faith. That evening, Lao stages his grand finale, a magic lantern show in which the mythical city of \\"Woldercan,\\" populated by doubles of the townfolk, is destroyed when it succumbs to temptation. The show ends in explosions and darkness and the townsfolk find themselves again in the library and in a town meeting. The vote is called on Stark's proposal, and to the surprise of Cunningham, Benedict and Stark it is rejected unanimously. A redeemed Stark tells them about the coming railroad. Angela confesses her love to Cunningham, to the delight of her mother-in-law. Stark's henchmen are confused by their boss' apparent change of character and decide to trash Lao's circus in a drunken spree, during which they break Lao's fishbowl. The inhabitant is revealed to be the Loch Ness Monster, which balloons to enormous size when exposed to the open air. After it chases the two thugs away (and temporarily grows seven heads to resemble the seven faces of the inhabitants of the circus), Mike alerts Dr. Lao and then helps conjure up a cloudburst to wet and shrink the beast back to its original size. Morning comes and the circus is gone, leaving a red-colored circle on the desert floor where the tent had been. Mike's reports of the night before are initially disbelieved, until Stark finds the hat belonging to one of the henchmen. As Stark, Cunningham and Benedict wonder about the events, Mike chases after a dust plume, which he thinks is made by Lao. He only finds three wooden balls, which he expertly juggles, while calling on the absent Lao to see. The closing scene shows the disappearing Dr. Lao riding his donkey over a nearby rise as his voice-over repeats his advice to Mike from two nights earlier, reminding Mike that the Circus of Dr. Lao is life itself, and everything in it is a wonder.

Randall also has a cameo appearance, wearing his own face, as a silent audience member.  Production  The trailer shows date of the picture, in Roman numerals, as 1963 rather than 1964. According to notes on the Leigh Harline soundtrack CD released by Film Score Monthly, Pal's first choice for the role was Peter Sellers who was strongly interested in the role. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer decided that they wished an American in the lead role. William Tuttle received an honorary Oscar for his makeup work on this film. It was the first of only two honorary Oscars awarded for makeup; the other went to John Chambers in 1968 for Planet of the Apes. As part of Tuttle's work, Randall had his head shaved, not only to play the bald Dr. Lao, but also to make it convenient for the \\"appliances\\" he had to wear. Randall later said, \\"It gave me an unborn look.\\" The studio publicity department arrived at the barber too late to photograph the process, so they had a make-up artist glue hair back on Randall's head and the barber once again removed it, this time for the cameras. Randall makes a cameo appearance in the film, sans makeup, during the parade of cast members before the Woldercan sequence, sitting in the audience. Since his head was already shaved, makeup artist Tuttle applied a hairpiece to him. Randall later said in an interview, \\"Gene Kelly's old toupee came in handy.\\" Jim Danforth's model animation of the Loch Ness Monster, the Giant Serpent, Medusa's snake hair were nominated for an Academy Award. The \\"Woldercan spectacular\\" that Dr. Lao presents as the grand finale of his circus contains much footage from an earlier George Pal production, 1961's Atlantis, the Lost Continent as well as some footage of flowing lava from The Time Machine and stock footage of destruction from MGM's 1951 production of Quo Vadis. The crystal ball and large hourglass used by the Wicked Witch of the West in 1939's The Wizard of Oz can both be spotted in the film. Also, in the scene where Mike visits Lao at night, a two-headed tortoise can be seen; this made a few later appearances in the television series The Addams Family.  Home media  7 Faces of Dr. Lao was released on a region- free DVD as part of the Warner Bros. Archive Collection in November 2011.  Reception  7 Faces of Dr. Lao garnered positive reception from multiple movie critics. Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 100% of six surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7/10. Howard Thompson of The New York Times called the film \\"heavy, thick, pint- sized fantasy, laid on with an anvil\\".

He was a legal counsel for the Ottoman Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when he saw the birth of his first son, Nesuhi, on 26 November 1917, in Constantinople (now Istanbul), during the First World War. Taking part in an Ottoman delegation with a mission to search reconciliation with the Nationalists in Ankara, by the end of 1920, changed his destiny. While the two Ottoman Ministers heading the delegation returned to Istanbul after not achieving an understanding with the revolutionaries led by Mustafa Kemal Pasha he chose to join the National Struggle and remained in Ankara, leaving behind his young wife and three-year-old son, Nesuhi. He became an aide to Mustafa Kemal during the Turkish War of Independence and the chief legal counsel of the Turkish delegation to the resulting Treaty of Lausanne in 1923. After the Western powers recognized the newly founded Republic of Turkey in 1923, he was sent to Geneva to the League of Nations as an observer for the Turkish Republic. During this assignment, he frequently went to Paris for the Ottoman public debt negotiations. Following this posting to the League of Nations, he was appointed ambassador to Switzerland (1925‚Äì1930), France (1930‚Äì1932), the United Kingdom (1932‚Äì1934) and the United States (1934‚Äì1944).

Biography  Tang was a native of Linchuan, Jiangxi and his career as an official consisted principally of low-level positions. He successfully participated in the Provincial examinations (juren) at the age of 21 and at the imperial examinations (jinshi) at the age of 34. He held official positions in Nanjing, Zhejiang province, Guangdong province etc. He retired in 1598 and returned to his hometown where he focused on writing. Tang died in 1616, the same year as famed English playwright William Shakespeare. His major plays are collectively called the Four Dreams, because of the decisive role dreams play in the plot of each one. All of them are still performed (in scenes, or in adapted full versions) on the Chinese Kun opera (kunqu) stage. Generally considered his masterpiece, the Mudan Ting (The Peony Pavilion) has been translated into English several times. A translation of his complete dramatic works in English was published in China in 2014 and in London in 2018.  Legacy  A few Ming and Qing playwrights followed Tang's writing style and called themselves the Yumintang or Linchuan school.

Life He was descended from an old Calabrian family, his father, Baron Giuseppe Poerio, being a distinguished lawyer of Naples. In 1815, he and his brother Carlo accompanied their father, who had been identified with Murat's cause, into exile, and settled at Florence. In 1818, they were allowed to return to Naples, and on the proclamation of the constitution in 1820, the Poerios were among the stoutest defenders of the newly-won freedom. Alessandro fought as a volunteer under General Guglielmo Pepe against the Austrians in 1821, but when the latter reoccupied Naples and the king abolished the constitution, the family was again exiled and settled at Graz. Alessandro devoted himself to study in various German universities, and at Weimar, he became the friend of Goethe. In 1835, the Poerios returned to Naples, and Alessandro, while practising law with his father, published a number of lyrics. In 1848, he accompanied Pepe as a volunteer to fight the Austrians in northern Italy, and on the recall of the Neapolitan contingent Alessancho followed Pepe to Venice and displayed great bravery during the siege. Severely wounded in the fighting round Mestre, he died of his injuries. His poetry reveals the idealism of a tender and delicate mind which was diligent in storing up sensations and images that for others would have been at most the transient impressions of a moment. But he could also sound the clarion note of patriotism, as in his stirring poem Il Risorgimento. See also * Carlo Poerio Sources *Erasmo G.

The NC formats were originally designed by CNC drill and route machine vendors as proprietary input formats for their equipment, and are known under their company name: Excellon, Hitachi, Sieb & Meyer, Posalux, etc. These formats are similar as they are based on RS-274-C and related to G-code. In 1985 IPC published a generic standard NC format, IPC-NC-349. Later XNC was designed, a simple strict subset of IPC-NC-349, designed not for driving machines but for exchanging drill information between CAD and CAM. They are collectively referred to as (PCB) NC files. The NC files are primarily used to drive CNC machines, and they are adequate for that task. They are also used to exchange design information between CAD and CAM, for which they are not adequate: essential information such as plating and drill span is missing. Furthermore, the NC output in CAD systems is often poorly implemented, resulting in poor registration between drill holes and copper layers and other problems. To exchange date between CAD and CAM it is more preferred to use the Gerber format. The quality of the Gerber file output software is typically good, and Gerber supports attributes to transfer meta-information such as plating and span.  IPC-NC-349 format  The IPC-NC-349 format is the only IPC standard governing drill and routing formats.IPC-NC-349 Computer Numerical Control Formatting for Drillers and Routers, published in 1985 XNC is a strict subset of IPC-NC-349, Excellon a big superset. Many indefinite NC files pick some elements of the IPC standard. A digital rights managed copy of the specification is available from the IPC website, for a fee. It is targeted at input for drill/rout machines, not CAD to CAM data exchange.  XNC format  The XNC format is strict subset of the IPC-NC-349 specification targeted at data exchange between CAD and CAM. The name XNC format stands for Exchange NC format. As a strict subset, it is highly compatible with existing software. Its purpose is to address the current chaos of different subsets and incomplete NC files, and define a simple common standard. The XNC subset was defined by a consortium formed by Graphicode, Ucamco, KiCad and Pentalogix. The specification is freely available among others at the Ucamco download page. The specification is brief, detailed, easy to understand and unambiguous. It is targeted at CAD to CAM data exchange, not at input for drill/rout machines. An example: M48 Start of header METRIC Metric units (mm) T01C0.6 Tool 1 has diameter 0.6mm T02C1.0 Tool 2 has diameter 1.0mm % End of header G05 Set drill mode T01 Select tool 1 X8.5Y4.8 Drill a hole of 0.6 mm at coordinates 8.5mm,4.8mm X8.55Y2.85 Drill X6.54Y2.85 Drill X6.45Y4.8 Drill T02 Select tool 2 G00X10.25Y3.825 Move to coordinates 10.25mm,3.825mm M15 Plunge rout tool down G01X6.50Y3.25 Rout to coordinates 6.5mm,3.25mm M16 Lift rout tool up M30 End of file  Excellon format  The name Excellon format is derived from the company Excellon Automation (not to be confused with Excellon Software), which was the market leader in PCB drilling and routing machines during the 1980s, and whose proprietary format became widely used. There are actually two Excellon formats, the older Excellon 1 and Excellon 2. Excellon 2 is a superset of IPC-NC-349. Commands from both are sometimes confusingly mixed in the same file. Excellon Automation stopped publishing the specification of its format, without statement on the IP and usage rights of the format. An archived copy exists. The specification is ambiguous, leading to different interpretations, especially in the area of coordinates and units. It is targeted at input for drill/rout machines, not CAD to CAM data exchange.  Indefinite NC files  For CAD/CAM data exchange often NC files are used that do not conform to any specification. These files contain a few IPC-NC-349 commands, but follow neither the Excellon nor the IPC-NC-349 specification. Commands are not used properly, or are used in a syntactically incorrect way, and binary data objects may be included. Sometimes the historic EIA or EBCDIC character encoding is used. Usually the header is incomplete: the scale or the tool diameters is missing. Sometimes there is no header at all, and the file only contains tool numbers, with an unspecified diameter, and X,Y coordinates, in an unspecified unit. They are often called Excellon files although they are undefinite NC files. No specification exists. An example: % T01 X006272Y001092 X006354Y001093 X006653Y001092 ... T02 X008091Y001754 X-002028 M30 The tool diameters and how to interpret the coordinates is not specified. This file is meaningless without additional information, typically put in a free format human readable tool file. This information must be re-entered manually by the CAD/CAM operator, with unnecessary manual labor and risk of delays or errors. Astonishingly, such enigmatic files are still used.

Carrying U.S. Route 1 (Federal Highway; unsigned State Road 5), it was built to supersede the old Roosevelt Bridge, which had twin parallel drawbridges, one for northbound traffic (opened in 1934, ) and the other for southbound (opened in 1964, ). The new bridge, completed in 1996, is raised and much longer than the older twin drawbridges. The southbound span of the old bridge is still functional for road and boat traffic and now carries two-way road traffic for what is now known as Dixie Highway, County Road 707. The new high-level Roosevelt Bridge is approximately one mile long and is made of two three-lane sections running parallel to each other. The northbound bridge was completed first, and housed two lanes of both north and south-bound traffic until the second bridge was finished. Because of high traffic volume and visibility, the Roosevelt Bridge is a frequent location for many protests and political campaigning in the area. Structural damage On June 17, 2020, chunks of concrete fell off the bridge, causing a large crack along the southbound bridge, which put the bridge at risk of an imminent collapse. The entire bridge in both directions was closed later that day. Dixie Highway was also closed. Tolls are being temporarily waived on the Florida's Turnpike from Stuart to Port St. Lucie to help ease traffic congestion during this closure. After severe corrosion & ruptured steel tendons were found on the bridge, Mayor Mike Meier issued a local state of emergency for the city of Stuart \\"based upon hazardous conditions currently existing with the Roosevelt Bridge. The declaration provides for the performance of public works and taking necessary actions to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the community.\\" As of July 5th, the northbound bridge, which can carry four lanes of car traffic (two in each direction) with a 5 ton restriction, and Dixie Highway are open. The southbound bridge remains closed. Vehicles over 5 tons are required to use alternate routes.

The town is reachable from Castell√≥n de la Plana through the CV-18 or the N-340 routes. In literature, Burriana is briefly described by James A. Michener in the book, Iberia. As a young man, Michener landed there as a part of a ship crew. The merchant vessel was there to collect oranges for the Scottish marmalade industry. Oranges, after being loaded into metal barrels, were dragged out to sea by bulls. The town exposes many memorial spots dedicated to James A.

It community is located approximately southeast of Cardston, which is home to Cardston County's municipal office.  Government  The community itself has no government such as a mayor or councillors. It is administered by the Cardston County.  History  One of Jefferson's two services at this point in time is an unmanned postal box outlet (Rural Route 2 Site 10). It shares the same postal code as Cardston (T0K 0K0), and in fact, mail going to the Jefferson area is addressed to Cardston - as Jefferson-bound mail is sorted at Cardston - then delivered to Jefferson by Canada Post on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. There is a new Canada Post box installment after the old, green one was covered by debris when the neighboring abandoned Jefferson Garage collapsed in a windstorm in 2003. The garage had been abandoned for generations and the wooden structure had seemed to be on the verge of collapse for years. The now-flattened garage had been beside an old General Store, but that store was converted into a family home generations ago. The other service for the community is the Jefferson Waste Transfer Site, constructed in the 1980s to replace an old open-air dump that was located in a small gully two miles west of Jefferson. The newer Waste Transfer Site is located only about a quarter-mile east of Jefferson, and is manned only one day a week. The newer waste site is much stricter than the old one, where anything up to old cars were left behind. The new site requires certain treatment of the waste before dumping it in the building, where it is later pushed off into a dump truck waiting in a passageway below. Many items are not allowed to be dumped at all anymore. This modernization of waste treatment in rural communities seems to have occurred in many regions of Alberta, as identical facilities can be seen elsewhere. There was a community hall (which used to be the Jefferson School in the mid 1900s), but it fell into disuse and disrepair in the 1990s. The main problem was roof leaks that ruined the hardwood gym floor. Prior to this, it had been used for community dances and 4-H functions such as public speaking competitions. By 2007, sadly, it was broken into and vandalized by unknown culprits and internal destruction was of such a scale that it was condemned. After being scheduled to be demolished, it was burned to the ground on April 24, 2007. The Jefferson 4-H Beef Club seems to have disappeared, also during the 1990s, and been absorbed by the Chinook 4-H Club in Cardston. This is probably due to many of the 4-H aged youth growing up and moving on, with not enough younger club members to replace them. Jefferson used to have its own Alberta Wheat Pool elevator and had a railroad going through it. However, as a result of Alberta removing its lesser-used rail lines, the railway going through Jefferson (from east of Cardston south to Jefferson, then east to Whiskey Gap, Alberta) was torn up in the early 1980s. The grain elevator was torn down when the province began consolidating its grain processing in larger centers.

Jacobs aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt, December 2005 Jack Howard Jacobs (born August 2, 1945) is a retired colonel in the United States Army and a Medal of Honor recipient for his actions during the Vietnam War. He serves as a military analyst for NBC News and MSNBC and previously worked as an investment manager. Early life Born on August 2, 1945, in Brooklyn, New York, Jacobs lived in Queens near LaGuardia Airport. He was born into a Jewish family, with origins in Greece, Poland, and Romania. As a child, he moved with his family to Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, in the mid-1950s and in 1962 graduated from Woodbridge High School. Jacobs then attended Rutgers University, where he earned both Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees. A member of the school's Army Reserve Officer Training Corps program, he entered military service as a first lieutenant in 1966. Military service In the course of his military career, Jacobs served as a platoon leader in the 82nd Airborne Division, a battalion executive officer in the 7th Infantry Division, and a battalion commander with the 10th Infantry Regiment in Panama. He spent two tours of duty in Vietnam, both times as an advisor to infantry units in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). In his first deployment to Vietnam, Jacobs served as a first lieutenant with Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, in Kien Phong Province, part of the Mekong Delta region. By March 9, 1968, he was working as the assistant battalion advisor for the ARVN's 2nd Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division. During a mission on that day, the 2nd Battalion came under intense fire from an entrenched Viet Cong force. As Jacobs called in air support from his position with the leading company, the company commander was disabled and the unit became disorganized due to heavy casualties. Although wounded himself by mortar fragments to the head and arms, Jacobs took command of the company and ordered a withdrawal and the establishment of a defense line at a more secure position. Despite impaired vision caused by his injuries, he repeatedly ran across open rice paddies through heavy fire to evacuate the wounded, personally saving a fellow advisor, the wounded company commander, and twelve other allied soldiers. Three times during these trips he encountered Viet Cong squads, which he single-handedly dispersed. He was subsequently promoted to captain and awarded the Medal of Honor. The medal was formally presented to him by President Richard Nixon. In addition to the Medal of Honor, Jacobs received two Silver Stars, three Bronze Star Medals, and two Purple Hearts in Vietnam. In his memoir, Jacobs recounts that he had to use subterfuge to return to a combat role in Vietnam after being awarded the Medal of Honor, as the military was unwilling to assign Medal of Honor recipients to combat roles. Jacobs was a faculty member at the United States Military Academy in West Point, teaching international relations and comparative politics for three years, from 1973 to 1976, and at the National War College in Washington, D.C. He retired from the army in 1987 as a colonel. Business career and later life After his military retirement, Jacobs began a career in investment banking. He founded and was chief operating officer of AutoFinance Group, Inc., which dealt in the securitization of debt instruments. The company was later sold to KeyBank. He next worked as a managing director of Bankers Trust, overseeing the firm's foreign exchange options and being involved in the institutional hedge fund business until leaving the company in 1996. Jacobs is a principal in The Fitzroy Group, an investment and residential real estate development organization which operates in London. He is also on the board of directors for several smaller corporations. Jacobs maintains involvement in several military-related organizations. He is vice chairman of the Medal of Honor Foundation, a member of the board of trustees for the National World War II Museum, and holds the McDermott Chair of Politics at the U.S. Military Academy. In October 2008, the Penguin Group published Jacobs' memoir, If Not Now, When?: Duty and Sacrifice In America's Time of Need, coauthored with New York Times best-selling author, Douglas Century, with a foreword by NBC Nightly News anchor and managing editor Brian Williams. The book won the 2010 Colby Award, recognizing a \\"first work of fiction or nonfiction that has made a significant contribution to the public's understanding of intelligence operations, military history, or international affairs.\\" In May 2012, Thomas Dunne Books published Jacobs' Basic: Surviving Boot Camp and Basic Training, co-written with David Fisher. The book is a history of the American military's basic training told mainly through oral histories of those who have gone through Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force initial training. Jacobs is also a military analyst for NBC/MSNBC. In 2009, he appeared on The Colbert Report as part of the Doom Bunker segment. He currently serves on the board of advisors of the Code of Support Foundation, a nonprofit military service organization. Jacobs is married to Sue Jacobs, has a grown daughter and two sons, and lives in Far Hills, New Jersey. He has also been a resident of the Millington section of Long Hill Township, New Jersey. In 2016, Jacobs was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In 2018, Jacobs delivered the Waldo Family Lecture on International Relations at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia.

Originally based in Jacksonville, North Carolina, the station is now headquartered in New Bern. Having been broadcasting for over 40 years, \\"Rock 105\\" is the \\"original rock station\\" for the Carolina Coast. For a brief time, it also simulcasted on WQZL/101.1, giving it coverage in inland areas, but this was discontinued in January 2012. History WXQR-FM is one of the oldest Rock stations in America. It was known as \\"The Rock and Roll Animal\\" from the 1970s until the mid-1990s. The station was once owned by Sidney Popkin, a member of one of the most prominent families in Jacksonville. The station was headquartered for many years (in the 1980s and 1990s) on New Bridge Street near Downtown Jacksonville, in what was once the Iwo Jima Theater. Because of its location, it was a favorite among Marines stationed at Camp Lejeune for decades. The station operated with 3,000 watts of power, which put them at a competitive disadvantage against its Newport-based rival Z-103, but WXQR had a solid following of loyal listeners. When Z-103 finally switched to Adult Contemporary (WMGV), WXQR's main competition became New Bern's WSFL-FM. WXQR-FM was never competitive with WSFL until its power was increased in the mid-1990s. HVS Partners, its longtime owners, sold WXQR-FM to Cumulus in the mid-1990s who then sold it to NextMedia Group a few years later. From October 2010 to January 2012, it simulcast to inland areas on WQZL/101.1. NextMedia sold WXQR-FM and their 32 other radio stations to Digity, LLC for $85 million; the transaction was consummated on February 10, 2014. Effective February 25, 2016, Digity, LLC and its 124 radio stations were acquired by Alpha Media for $264 million. In September 2017, Dick Broadcasting announced the purchase of Alpha Media stations in three markets ‚Äî 18 stations and two translators in total, at a purchase price of $19.5 million.

A Kimblewick, Kimberwicke or Kimberwick is a type of bit used on a horse, and named after the English town of Kimblewick where it was first made. The bit has bit shanks, D-shaped rings, and a curb chain. Due to its shanks, it is regarded as a type of curb bit. The curb action is minimal to mild, however, because the shanks have short purchase arms and no lever arms (see Lever). Some variations increase the curb action. A Kimblewick is used with one set of reins. Design This bit was originally called the Kimblewick after the English town where it first appeared. First invented by show jumper, horse man and family farmer, Felix Oliver (Aka Phil) Mr Oliver & his family lived at Meadacre Farm, Kimblewick, and started a partnership with Harry Payne, from Bushey, that was to make his reputation with such great horses as Red Admiral, Red Star, Sheila, Galway Bay and Planet. Mr. Oliver rode the horses himself at that time, including many winners of point-to-pointing. His eldest son, Alan, began show jumping as a schoolboy and, schooled by his father, became one of the greatest names in top show jumping. With his second son, Paul, Mr. Oliver produced many successful ponies. His daughter Vivien was also a very successful rider. In 1967, after the death of Mr. Payne, he formed a partnership with Mr. Leonard Crawthraw. After his retirement from the farm in 1974 he lived in Longwick where he took immense pleasure in schooling and advising young riders. Spooner, Glenda, Instructions in Ponymastership, p.86, Museum Press, London, 1954 However, in its early years of use, it was also known as the \\"Spanish jumping bit\\". The \\"D\\" ring is offset, so the bit mouthpiece is on the upper part of the flat side of the D, creating a small amount of leverage, supported by a curb chain. This allows the Kimblewick to have a mild curb bit effect. Like the pelham and curb bits in general, the Kimblewick has bit shanks with purchase arms. However, unlike these other bits, its shanks have no lever arm. Due to the purchase arm and geometry of the rings, the rings may function as very short lever arms and create a small amount of leverage, which puts this type of bit into the pelham or curb bit \\"family\\". The curb function varies with the style of bit: slotted Kimblewicks provide the option of more curb action, whereas unslotted Kimblewicks are very close in function to the Baucher bit, which most users regard as a snaffle bit, and to the pelham bit when the snaffle rein is used. Depending on the position of the rider's hands, the standard Kimblewick has different effects when the rein is allowed to slide freely along the curved portion of the D-ring. If the rider's hands are held high, there is no leverage effect. If the rider's hands are low, the slight leverage effect can be used. However, one popular design, the Uxeter Kimblewick, has slots in the curved portion of the ring, so that the rein may be fixed into one position. This increases the curb effect, especially when the rein is placed on the lower of the two slots. Kimblewick bits have a variety of bit mouthpieces. The original design has a ported mouthpiece, but it now is also manufactured with others, including a solid, unjointed \\"mullen\\" mouth, and a single-jointed mouthpiece. Use Kimblewicks are not as widely used as snaffles and pelhams, and are illegal in some horse show competition classes, notably dressage and show hunter. Kimblewicks are regarded by some people as unconventional or non-\\"classic\\", and the compromise design that combines snaffle and curb features may lead some horses to either overflex in the bit or learn to lean on it. However, they do offer the rider a slight curb effect without the risk of a shank getting caught on something, which is useful for contact sports, such as polocrosse, and provide a bit more control than a snaffle, which can be helpful for smaller riders on strong horses. They are seen commonly on ponies.

Early life and 1848 In 1815 he and his brother accompanied their father, who had been a supporter of the French-imposed King of Naples Joachim Murat, into exile, and settled at Florence. He returned to Naples and practised as a lawyer, and from 1837 to 1848 was frequently arrested and imprisoned, helping among others to prepare the insurrection of 1847; but, when Ferdinand II, moved by the demonstration on 27 January of the latter year, promulgated a constitution, he was made minister of education. Discovering that the monarch maintained a will to collaborate with the Austrian Empire, he resigned office in April 1849, and returned to Naples to take his seat in parliament, where he led the constitutional opposition. Imprisonment, refuge, and return After the battle of Novara, the king was free to dissolve parliament and renounce the constitution; in the month of July 1849 Poerio was arrested, tried, and sentenced to nineteen years in prison. Chained in pairs, he and other political prisoners were confined in one small room in the labor camp on Nisida (the Phlegraean Islands). William Ewart Gladstone's report on the inhumane conditions in Neapolitan detention facilities (1851), emphasizing the case of Poerio, provoked an international uproar; nonetheless, Poerio was set free only in 1858. He and other exiles were then placed on board a ship bound for the Argentina, but the son of Luigi Settembrini (both of them on board the ship) compelled the crew to land them at Cork, in the United Kingdom, after which Poerio made his way to London. In the following year he returned to Italy, and, in 1860 he was elected deputy to the parliament of Piedmont-Sardinia in Turin (the original seat of the House of Savoy government), and was chosen the body's vice-president in 1861, when the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed.

It includes the pelham bit and the Weymouth curb along with the traditional \\"curb bit\\" used mainly by Western riders. Kimblewicks or \\"Kimberwickes\\" are modified curb bits, and a curb bit is used in a double bridle along with a bradoon. A curb bit is, in general, more severe than a basic snaffle bit, although there are several factors that are involved in determining a bit's severity. Liverpool bits are a type of curb bit commonly used for horses in harness. The curb bit Parts of a curb bit The curb bit consists of a mouthpiece, curb chain, and a shank, with one ring on each side of the purchase arm of the shank, and one ring on the bottom of the lever arm of the shank. Pelham bits add a ring for a snaffle rein, next to the mouthpiece. =Action= A curb bit works on several parts of a horse's head and mouth. The bit mouthpiece acts on the bars, tongue and roof of the mouth. The shanks add leverage and place pressure on the poll via the crownpiece of the bridle, to the chin groove via the curb chain, and, especially with a \\"loose jaw\\" shank, may act on the sides of the mouth and jaw. The shank A decorative fixed shank on a western Salinas-style curb bit A curb bit is a leverage bit, meaning that it multiplies the pressure applied by the rider. Unlike a snaffle bit, which applies direct rein pressure from the rider's hand to the horse's mouth, the curb can amplify rein pressure several times over, depending on the length of the curb's bit shank. Shank sizes vary from the Tom Thumb (2 inches long) to more than 5 inches. The longer the bit shank, the more powerful its potential effect on the horse. For this reason, overall shank or cheek length, from the top of the cheek ring to the bottom of the rein ring, usually cannot exceed inches for most horse show disciplines. =Leverage principles= Bit shanks, such as those on this spade bit, work as a lever The relation of the upper shank (purchase)--the shank length from the mouthpiece to the cheekpiece rings‚Äîand the lower shank or lever arm‚Äîthe shank length from the mouthpiece to the lowest rein ring, is important in the severity of the bit. The standard curb bit has a \\" purchase and a \\" lower shank, thus producing a 1:3 ratio of purchase to lower shank, a 1:4 ratio of purchase to full shank, thus producing 3 lbs of pressure on the chin groove and 4 lbs of pressure on the horse's mouth for every 1 lb placed on the reins (3 and 4 newtons respectively for every newton). Regardless of the ratio, the longer the shank, the less force is needed on the reins to provide a given amount of pressure on the mouth. So, if one were to apply 1 lb of pressure on the horse's mouth, a 2\\" shank would need more rein pressure than an 8\\" shank to provide the same effect. A long lower shank in relation to the upper shank (or purchase) increases the leverage, and thus the pressure, on the curb groove and the bars of the mouth. A long purchase in relation to the lower shank increases the pressure on the poll and chin, but does not apply as much pressure on the bars of the mouth. A longer purchase will also lift the cannons up and cause significant lip stretch, with an increased danger of dragging the cannons of the bit into the premolars. A horse has more warning or pre-signal, in a long-shanked bit, allowing it to respond before any significant pressure is applied to its mouth, than it would in a shorter- shanked bit, but ultimately it is the straightness or curve or the shank which translates to the abruptness of response. A straight shank, following the line of leverage, will produce a faster response in the mouth and curb than a shorter curved shank. In this way, a longer shank can allow better communication between horse and rider, without increasing severity. This is also directly dependent on the tightness of the curb chain. Pre-signal is everything that happens before the curbstrap engages, so a properly adjusted curbstrap is paramount in determining the amount of rotation and the timeframe a horse has to prepare for the bit to engage. Too tight and the action is abrupt and severe, too loose and the action is slower, but the bit rotates further, causing it to lift in the mouth and hit the premolars. =Types= A western curb bit with a loose-jawed shank Shanks come in a variety of types, which may affect the action of the bit. Some shanks are loose-jawed, meaning they swivel where the mouthpiece attaches to the shank. Others have a loose, rotating ring at the bottom of the shank for rein attachment. Both of these functions allow slight rotation before the bit engages, again providing a \\"warning\\" to the horse before the bit engages fully and allowing him to respond to the slightest pressure, thus increasing communication between horse and rider. The cheek-shank angle also varies, with some straight up and down, others with the shanks curving backward, and some with an S-curve in the shank. The straighter the cheek-shank line is, the less signal is provided to the horse before the bit engages. Those that curve backward provide more of a signal to the horse. Therefore, the type of shank needs to be considered according to the use of the horse. Horses that maintain a more vertical head position, such as dressage horses, generally use a curb bit with straight shanks. Those that have a nose-out head position when working, such as cutting and roping horses, more commonly use a curved shank. Mouthpiece A medium port curb offers considerable tongue relief. The addition of loose-jaw short shanks make this a relatively mild bit. The curb bit's mouthpiece controls the pressure on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and bars. A mullen mouth places even pressure on the bars and tongue. A port places more pressure on the bars, but provides room for the tongue. A high port may act on the roof of the mouth as it touches. Some Western style curbs, particularly the spade bit, have both a straight bar mouthpiece and a high welded port, thus acting on the bars, tongue and palate. In the wrong hands, such bits can be extremely severe, but on an exquisitely trained animal, they allow the rider to communicate with the horse with a simple touch of the fingertips to the reins. Curb bits can also be purchased with a variety of jointed mouthpieces that are sometimes mistakenly called \\"snaffles\\", some of which (like the twisted wire) can further increase severity. Jointed mouthpieces increase the pressure on the bars due to the nutcracker action of the mouthpiece. In addition, the joint angle is altered by the shank leverage to tip the bit downward and into the tongue. These bits, sometimes called \\"cowboy snaffles\\" due to their popularity among western riders, are actually more harsh than a curb with a simple, solid, ported mouthpiece. Accessories English curb set up with curb chain and lip strap The curb chain or strap applies pressure to the curb groove under a horse's chin. When the shank of the bit rotates back (due to rein pressure), the cheek of the bit rotates forward since it is a lever arm. The curb chain is attached to the rings at the end of the cheek. So as the cheek moves forward, it pulls the curb chain, tightening in the curb groove. Once it comes in contact with the curb groove of the horse it acts as a fulcrum, causing the cannons of the bit mouthpiece to push down onto the horse's bars, thus amplifying the bit's pressure on the bars of the horse's mouth. The action of the bit is therefore also dependent on the tightness of the curb chain. If the bit is used without a curb chain (very uncommon‚Äîand dangerous), it loses its leverage action. If used with a loose curb chain, it allows the shanks to rotate more before the curb chain is tight enough to act as a fulcrum and exert pressure. This extra rotation can warn the horse before pressure is exerted on the mouth, so the well-trained horse may respond faster. If used with a very tight curb chain, the bit immediately exerts leverage and increased pressure on the bars as soon as pressure is applied to the reins. Therefore, a tight curb chain is harsher, and provides less finesse in signaling the horse than a looser curb chain would. Less often seen is the lip strap, a thin strap or light chain that helps keep the curb chain in place and also prevents the horse from grabbing, or \\"lipping\\" the bit shanks with its mouth. Styles A carriage team's wheeler, in a Liverpool bit set up with minimum leverage. The leaders' two pairs of reins can also be seen being joined into one balanced pair. Curb bits have tremendous variation, from the relatively simple English Weymouth curb or the simple western medium-port curb to very elaborate designs with complex mouthpieces and shank designs. Some of the more common include: *Weymouth or Weymouth curb: commonly used in a double bridle. It is an English style with a straight shank. The mouthpiece can be one of numerous styles, but usually it is solid, with a low port. *Grazing bit: A western curb with shanks turned back nearly 90 degrees, allegedly to allow the horse to graze while wearing a curb bit. Modern western bits with moderately curved or angled shanks are sometimes called grazing bits, even if the angle is less extreme than the original design. *Spade bit: A historic vaquero design with straight, highly decorated shanks and a mouthpiece that includes a straight bar, a narrow port with a cricket, and a \\"spoon,\\" a flat, partly rounded plate affixed above the port, supported by braces on either side. Considered a highly technical piece of equipment to be used only on a finished horse. *Liverpool bit: A curb bit with several rein-attachment slots on the curb arms, giving a choice of leverage - the reins may alternatively be attached directly to the bit to use it as a simple snaffle. Used for horses in harness, especially when working in teams, when different horses may require different treatment - their bits can be adjusted so the same tension on the reins of each horse gives a similar result. This allows the reins of the different horses in a team to be joined together, minimising the number of reins the driver has to manage. Fitting Curbs are generally placed lower down in a horse's mouth than snaffle bits, touching the corners of the mouth, or creating a single slight wrinkle in the lips. The lower the bit is placed, the more severe it is as the bars of the mouth get thinner and pressure is more concentrated. The curb chain should be adjusted correctly, lying flat against the chin groove and only coming into action against the jaw when the shank is rotated, but not so loose that the shank exceeds 45 degrees of rotation.

Paris, 15 August 1717 ‚Äì d. Paris, 26 December 1806) was a French dramatist, painter, architect, set designer and author, and designer of one of the earliest examples of the French landscape garden, Parc Monceau in Paris. He also invented the transparent, an early ancestor of the magic lantern and motion picture, for viewing moving bands of landscape paintings.  Biography  Carmontelle came from a modest background; his father was a bootmaker. He studied drawing and geometry, and at the age of twenty three qualified for the title of engineer, and entered the service of the Duc de Chevreuse and the Duc de Luynes at the Ch√¢teau de Dampierre, where he taught drawing and mathematics to the children.Article on Louis Carmontelle by Monique Mosser in Cr√©ateurs de jardins et de paysages en France de la Renaissance au d√©but du XIXe si√®cle Actes Sud, √âcole Nationale Superieure du Paysage, 2001. In 1758, he entered the service of the Comte Pons de Saint-Maurice, governor of the Duc de Chartres and commander of regiment of Orl√©ans-dragons as a topographical engineer. In addition to his drawing duties, he wrote farces and tales. After 1763 entered into the service of Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans as a lecteur, responsible for providing theatrical performances for the family. He wrote and directed plays, decorated the scenery and made the costumes. In this way he invented a new genre of play, the proverbe dramatique, a scene of light comedy designed to be a point of departure for a theatrical improvisation. He also wrote plays for the famous ballerina, Marie-Madeleine Guimard for performance at the private theater of her residence, Pantin. In addition to his work in the theater, he was a talented artist, who made portraits in pen and watercolor in less than two hours of notable people that he met. The most famous of his drawings is that of the infant Mozart playing the clavier.The Carnavalet Museum in Paris and the Museum of Chantilly possess more than six hundred of his drawings, including the Mozart drawing.  Parc Monceau  In 1773, he was asked by the Duc de Chartres, the son of Louis-Philippe d'Orl√©ans and the future Philippe Egalit√©, to design a garden around a small house that he was building to the northwest of Paris. Between 1773 and 1778, he created the folie de Chartres, (now Parc Monceau), one of the most famous French landscape gardens of the time. It departed from the more natural English landscape gardens of the time by presenting a series of fantastic scenes designed \\"to unite in one garden all places and all times.\\".Monique Mosser, pg. 151. It included a series of fabriques, or architectural structures, while illustrated all the styles known at the time; antiquity, exoticism, Chinese, Turkish, ruins, tombs, and rustic landscapes, all created to surprise and divert the visitor. After the death of the duc d'Orleans in 1785, Carmonetelle entered into the service of the Duc de Chartres, and taught drawing to his son Louis-Philippe of France, the future and last King of France, and his sister Adeleide .  Introduction of Animation into Painting  In the last years of his life, he pioneered a new invention for showing paintings in motion, which was a distant ancestor of the motion picture. In 1783 he began working on what he termed \\"d√©cors transparents anim√©s.\\" These were paintings of landscapes on long bands of paper, fifty centimeters high and as many as forty two meters long. These were mounted on two wooden rollers in a box, with the light of day coming into the box from behind and passing through the paper. The landscapes were slowly rolled from one roll to the other, giving the illusion of a walk in the garden. The first moving landscapes he titled \\"Landscapes of France,\\" \\"English Gardens,\\" \\"The Seasons,\\" and \\"The Banks of the Seine.\\" One of the moving landscapes is preserved at the Museum of Sceaux.Monique Mosser, pg 152.

It arose as a replacement for the outdated Diversi-Dial system (DDial). Like DDial, it was a multi-line modem system that originally could handle eight simultaneous connections (later updated to handle sixteen), and using custom-produced RS-232 serial boards had a theoretical connection limit of thirty-two on an IBM PC-AT - type computer (80286 processor). While DDial was limited to 300 baud, STS was initially capable of 2400 baud speeds (later editions upped this to 14.4, 19.2, and 28.8). Using internal software, one or more of these lines could be used to establish links to other STS stations, effectively making the number of simultaneous users dependent on how many STSes were involved. The interface and design was similar to DDial in that users logged into the system with a three digit number that served as a username. Once logged in, the user could change his or her name to whatever he or she wished, while his or her user number served as a unique identifier. Each user was assigned a user level. 0 was for non-members. Callers without a user number could log in for only a limited time (usually 10 minutes, but this could be decreased to 5 when call volume was high.) The numbered levels were for registered users, usually paying members. The upper levels, 50-99 were for various levels of moderators. The sysop could assign a moderator level to any user, effectively giving them power to do various tasks such as creating specialty channels, making links to other STS stations, moderating lower-level users, and kicking out people who were being a nuisance, (one early feature added was used to ban \\"nuisance\\" guests from returning after they were kicked, using the then-recently emerging technology of caller ID). Features Synergy Teleconferencing System also incorporated other interesting features that predated similar ones offered by larger ISPs (internet service providers); One of which (introduced early on) was the ability to inform a user that had call waiting on their phone line that they had an incoming call and allow them the opportunity to answer the call and then return to their online session. This feature was built into the system long before other corporate service providers offered this feature. Versions STS was originally written in Pascal with assembly language \\"hooks\\" for driving the hardware. The earliest versions were functional on IBM PC-XT-type computers, while later versions required the more robust IBM PC-AT platform with the 80286 processor. Connection speed evolved over the life of the software; Version 2.0 of the software supported up to 28.8k directly. V1.5 and later also had a far superior network linking mode to that of Diversi-Dial that supported encrypted data communications and would use IRC as a \\"hub\\" to link multiple systems without tying up more than one phone line per station. The software was produced by the Florida company \\"Lightspeed Electronics LLC.\\", which began producing early hard disk drive systems for PCs in the early 1980s. The primany (\\"flagship\\") station, STS-01, was called Fantasia, the successor to a D-Dial of the same name. The system was run by Falkor and the software and hardware was designed and produced by him as well as his CoSysOps Sloth, Creidiki, Troubadour and Trillian. Current Operational Nodes STS 07 Information Overload is back up and running currently 8 lines until we find a 486 without a riser card to support 16 lines if anyone would like to donate one they have that would be greatly appreciated!

Hongdao's life spanned nearly the whole of the Wanli period (1573-1620) in Chinese history. A native of Gong'an in Hukuang, his family had been military officials for generations. Hongdao showed an interest in literature from youth and formed his own literary club at age fifteen. At the age of twenty-four in 1592 he took the jinshi examination and subsequently received an official position in 1595. However he quit out of boredom after a year. He traveled and consulted with the radical philosopher Li Zhi. On another trip his brothers joined him. Hu's elder brother was a Buddhist-Confucianist synchronist. His travels resulted in his publishing a poetry compilation Jietuo ji [Collection of One Released]. His and his two brothers' poetry, which focused on clarity and sincerity, produced a following eventually known as the Gong'an school, the central belief of which was that good writing was a result of genuine emotions and personal experience. When his elder brother Zongdao died in 1600, Hongdao retired to a small island in a lake to meditate and write poetry. The resulting work is Xiaobi tangji [Jade-Green Bamboo Hall Collection].  Poems  THE CAPITAL Bright are the city walls of the capital; Red-robed officials shout on broad streets. There is a white-headed destitute scholar; Hanging from his mule's saddle, sheaves of poems. Clasping his calling card, he knocks on doors for work; The gate keepers smirk at one another. Ten try and ten fail; Walk the streets, his face is haggard. Always fear in serving the rich; Sorry your flattery isn't quick enough. Over an eye a black eyepatch; Half blind, the fellow is old! A STRANGE PRIEST Bought his mantle to escape draft and taxes; Now he's the head priest amid his splendor. Recites incantations, but sounds like a bird; Writes Sanscrit that looks like twisted weeds. With his begging bowl he distributes food of the spirit; On his seat he faces the lamp of Buddha; If you don't devote you whole body and soul, How can there be anywhere Buddhism at all?

They then went on to tour extensively playing with such bands as Bloc Party, The Libertines, Hard-Fi, The Cribs, Kaiser Chiefs and The Futureheads. Their d√©but single, \\"Attack! Attack! Attack!\\", was awarded NME 'single of the week' tag, followed by positive reviews of subsequent releases. The start of 2006 saw a European tour taking in Italy, France and Germany, and also an American tour, which included San Francisco, Chicago, Los Angeles and New York. The band toured Europe once again in June 2007, with the London-based band Art Brut. The title of Kaiser Chiefs hit song \\"I Predict A Riot\\" was based on a show by Black Wire in 2004, when the band once again played the Leeds nightclub, Pigs. Their intense performance caused a stage invasion, at which point security guards began ejecting members of both the audience and band, causing Kaiser Chiefs' drummer Nick Hodgson to exclaim \\"I predict a riot\\". Dan Wilson, having attended Art school, designed and drew the artwork for the first three singles. Their eponymous d√©but album was released in early 2005 on 48 Crash, a record label which they left in 2006, due to inconsistencies in the label's input and work ethic. They were working on new material set for release in 2007, but then disbanded in August of that year. McCabe and Prescott performed under the name Lord Auch, while Wilson and Greatorex formed Televised Crimewave both disbanded in 2010.

This is a common problem that can affect the joints and bones of the metatarsals. Metatarsalgia is most often localized to the first metatarsal head - the ball of the foot just behind the big toe. There are two small sesamoid bones under the first metatarsal head. The next most frequent site of metatarsal head pain is under the second metatarsal. This can be due to either too short a first metatarsal bone or to \\"hypermobility of the first ray\\" - metatarsal bone and medial cuneiform bone behind it - both of which result in excess pressure being transmitted into the second metatarsal head. Signs and Symptoms Metatarsalgia is characterized by a sharp pain in the ball of the foot. Causes A common cause is poorly fitted shoes. Diagnosis Diagnosis is often done by patient self report.

XRC as a z/OS copy services solution can be compared to Global Mirror for ESS, which is a controller-based solution for either the open systems or z/Series environments. Both Global Mirror for ESS (Asynchronous PPRC) and XRC (Global Mirror for z/Series) are asynchronous replication technologies, although their implementations are somewhat different. Extended Remote Copy or XRC is now known as Global Mirror for z/Series (XRC). XRC is a z/Series asynchronous disk mirroring technique which is effective over any distance. It keeps the data time consistent across multiple ESS (Enterprise Storage Server) or HDS (Hitachi Data Systems) disk subsystems at the recovery site. XRC functions as a combination of disk (IBM ESS or HDS licensed) Microcode and application code running on a z/Series host and provides a recovery point that is time consistent across multiple disk subsystems. The host component of the software is called the System Data Mover or SDM.

Most of the books in the series are illustrated by illustrator and author Philip Reeve, with the exception of \\"The Secret Life of Codes\\", which is illustrated by Ian Baker, \\"The Essential Arithmetricks: How to plus, minus, times and divide.\\" illustrated by Daniel Postgate and Rob Davis, and \\"The Murderous Maths of Everything\\", also illustrated by Rob Davis. The Murderous Maths books have been published in over 25 countries. The books, which are aimed at children aged 8 and above, teach maths, spanning from basic arithmetic to relatively complex concepts such as the quadratic formula and trigonometry. The books are written in an informal similar style to the Horrible Histories, Horrible Science and Horrible Geography series, involving evil geniuses, gangsters, and a generally comedic tone. Development The first two books of the series were originally part of \\"The Knowledge\\" (now \\"Totally\\") series (), itself a spin-off of Horrible Histories. However, these books were eventually redesigned and they, as well as the rest of the titles in the series, now use the Murderous Maths banner. According to Poskitt, \\"these books have even found their way into schools and proved to be a boost to GCSE studies\\". The books are also available in foreign editions, including: German, Spanish, Polish, Czech, Greek, Dutch, Norwegian, Turkish, Croatian, Italian, Lithuanian, Korean, Danish, Portuguese, Hungarian, Finnish, Thai and Portuguese (Latin America) . In 2009, the books were redesigned again, changing the cover art style and the titles of most of the books in the series. Poskitt's goal, according to the Murderous Maths website, is to write books that are \\"something funny to read\\", have \\"good amusing illustrations\\", include \\"tricks\\", and \\"explaining the maths involved as clearly as possible\\". He adds that although he doesn't \\"work to any government imposed curriculum or any stage achievement levels\\", he has \\"been delighted to receive many messages of support and thanks from parents and teachers in the UK, the United States and elsewhere\\".

Kjartan has also written a book entitled Everyday Maths for Grown-Ups (2011). Reviews A recommendation of the series by Scientific American includes a quote from a Stanford engineer named Stacy F. Bennet, who described the series as \\"very humorous and engaging introductions to such topics as algebra, geometry and probability\\". On 22 November 1997, that same publication said of the series, \\"Have a look at Murderous Maths by Kjartan Poskitt. It is a truly addictive reading book, and was leapt on and devoured by my children. The book is full of awful jokes, fascinating facts, real murders and yes, the maths is good too.

The GW invariants may be packaged as a homology or cohomology class in an appropriate space, or as the deformed cup product of quantum cohomology. These invariants have been used to distinguish symplectic manifolds that were previously indistinguishable. They also play a crucial role in closed type IIA string theory. They are named after Mikhail Gromov and Edward Witten. The rigorous mathematical definition of Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants is lengthy and difficult, so it is treated separately in the stable map article. This article attempts a more intuitive explanation of what the invariants mean, how they are computed, and why they are important. Definition Consider the following: *X: a closed symplectic manifold of dimension 2k, *A: a 2-dimensional homology class in X, *g: a non-negative integer, *n: a non-negative integer. Now we define the Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants associated to the 4-tuple: (X, A, g, n). Let \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g, n} be the Deligne‚ÄìMumford moduli space of curves of genus g with n marked points and \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, A) denote the moduli space of stable maps into X of class A, for some chosen almost complex structure J on X compatible with its symplectic form. The elements of \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, A) are of the form: :::(C, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, f), where C is a (not necessarily stable) curve with n marked points x1, ..., xn and f : C ‚Üí X is pseudoholomorphic. The moduli space has real dimension :::d := 2 c_1^X (A) + (2k - 6) (1 - g) + 2 n. Let :::\\\\mathrm{st}(C, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n) \\\\in \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g, n} denote the stabilization of the curve. Let :::Y := \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g, n} \\\\times X^n, which has real dimension 6g- 6 + 2(k + 1)n. There is an evaluation map ::: \\\\begin{cases} \\\\mathrm{ev}: \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, A) \\\\to Y \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathrm{ev}(C, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n, f) = \\\\left(\\\\operatorname{st}(C, x_1, \\\\ldots, x_n), f(x_1), \\\\ldots, f(x_n) \\\\right). \\\\end{cases} The evaluation map sends the fundamental class of \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g, n}(X, A) to a d-dimensional rational homology class in Y, denoted :::GW_{g, n}^{X, A} \\\\in H_d(Y, \\\\Q). In a sense, this homology class is the Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariant of X for the data g, n, and A. It is an invariant of the symplectic isotopy class of the symplectic manifold X. To interpret the Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariant geometrically, let Œ≤ be a homology class in \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{M}}_{g, n} and \\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n homology classes in X, such that the sum of the codimensions of \\\\beta, \\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n equals d. These induce homology classes in Y by the K√ºnneth formula. Let :GW_{g, n}^{X, A}(\\\\beta, \\\\alpha_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\alpha_n) := GW_{g, n}^{X, A} \\\\cdot \\\\beta \\\\cdot \\\\alpha_1 \\\\cdots \\\\alpha_n \\\\in H_0(Y, \\\\Q), where \\\\cdot denotes the intersection product in the rational homology of Y. This is a rational number, the Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariant for the given classes. This number gives a \\"virtual\\" count of the number of pseudoholomorphic curves (in the class A, of genus g, with domain in the Œ≤-part of the Deligne‚ÄìMumford space) whose n marked points are mapped to cycles representing the \\\\alpha_i. Put simply, a GW invariant counts how many curves there are that intersect n chosen submanifolds of X. However, due to the \\"virtual\\" nature of the count, it need not be a natural number, as one might expect a count to be. For the space of stable maps is an orbifold, whose points of isotropy can contribute noninteger values to the invariant. There are numerous variations on this construction, in which cohomology is used instead of homology, integration replaces intersection, Chern classes pulled back from the Deligne‚ÄìMumford space are also integrated, etc. Computational techniques Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants are generally difficult to compute. While they are defined for any generic almost complex structure J, for which the linearization D of the \\\\bar \\\\partial_{j, J}operator is surjective, they must actually be computed with respect to a specific, chosen J. It is most convenient to choose J with special properties, such as nongeneric symmetries or integrability. Indeed, computations are often carried out on K√§hler manifolds using the techniques of algebraic geometry. However, a special J may induce a nonsurjective D and thus a moduli space of pseudoholomorphic curves that is larger than expected. Loosely speaking, one corrects for this effect by forming from the cokernel of D a vector bundle, called the obstruction bundle, and then realizing the GW invariant as the integral of the Euler class of the obstruction bundle. Making this idea precise requires significant technical argument using Kuranishi structures. The main computational technique is localization. This applies when X is toric, meaning that it is acted upon by a complex torus, or at least locally toric. Then one can use the Atiyah‚ÄìBott fixed-point theorem, of Michael Atiyah and Raoul Bott, to reduce, or localize, the computation of a GW invariant to an integration over the fixed-point locus of the action. Another approach is to employ symplectic surgeries to relate X to one or more other spaces whose GW invariants are more easily computed. Of course, one must first understand how the invariants behave under the surgeries. For such applications one often uses the more elaborate relative GW invariants, which count curves with prescribed tangency conditions along a symplectic submanifold of X of real codimension two. Related invariants and other constructions The GW invariants are closely related to a number of other concepts in geometry, including the Donaldson invariants and Seiberg‚ÄìWitten invariants in the symplectic category, and Donaldson‚ÄìThomas theory in the algebraic category. For compact symplectic four-manifolds, Clifford Taubes showed that a variant of the GW invariants (see Taubes's Gromov invariant) are equivalent to the Seiberg‚ÄìWitten invariants. For algebraic threefolds, they are conjectured to contain the same information as integer valued Donaldson‚ÄìThomas invariants. Physical considerations also give rise to Gopakumar‚ÄìVafa invariants, which are meant to give an underlying integer count to the typically rational Gromov-Witten theory. The Gopakumar-Vafa invariants do not presently have a rigorous mathematical definition, and this is one of the major problems in the subject. The Gromov-Witten invariants of smooth projective varieties can be defined entirely within algebraic geometry. The classical enumerative geometry of plane curves and of rational curves in homogeneous spaces are both captured by GW invariants. However, the major advantage that GW invariants have over the classical enumerative counts is that they are invariant under deformations of the complex structure of the target. The GW invariants also furnish deformations of the product structure in the cohomology ring of a symplectic or projective manifold; they can be organized to construct the quantum cohomology ring of the manifold X, which is a deformation of the ordinary cohomology. The associativity of the deformed product is essentially a consequence of the self-similar nature of the moduli space of stable maps that are used to define the invariants. The quantum cohomology ring is known to be isomorphic to the symplectic Floer homology with its pair-of-pants product. Application in physics GW invariants are of interest in string theory, a branch of physics that attempts to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics. In this theory, everything in the universe, beginning with the elementary particles, is made of tiny strings. As a string travels through spacetime it traces out a surface, called the worldsheet of the string. Unfortunately, the moduli space of such parametrized surfaces, at least a priori, is infinite-dimensional; no appropriate measure on this space is known, and thus the path integrals of the theory lack a rigorous definition. The situation improves in the variation known as closed A-model. Here there are six spacetime dimensions, which constitute a symplectic manifold, and it turns out that the worldsheets are necessarily parametrized by pseudoholomorphic curves, whose moduli spaces are only finite- dimensional. GW invariants, as integrals over these moduli spaces, are then path integrals of the theory. In particular, the free energy of the A-model at genus g is the generating function of the genus g GW invariants.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 27, 1997.. It was written by Donick Cary and directed by Steven Dean Moore. The episode guest stars Sab Shimono as Mr. Sparkle, Gedde Watanabe as the factory worker, Denice Kumagai and Karen Maruyama as dancers, and Frank Welker as the baboons. In the episode, Marge replaces Reverend Lovejoy as the town's moral adviser while Homer explores the mystery of why his face appears on a Japanese-language detergent box. Plot After Reverend Lovejoy's sermon bores his congregation, Marge voices her concern over his lack of enthusiasm about helping people. Lovejoy explains that his passion faded as he dealt with Ned Flanders' constant trivial problems. Marge begins working for the Church as the \\"Listen Lady\\", listening to people's problems and helping solve them. Lovejoy realizes his inadequacy and feels depressed; visions of the saints chastise him for doing little to inspire his congregation. Homer takes Bart and Lisa to the Springfield dump to dispose of their Christmas tree, where they find a box of Japanese dishwasher detergent, Mr. Sparkle, whose mascot clearly resembles Homer. Disturbed, Homer contacts the manufacturer in Hokkaid≈ç, Japan. Homer is sent a promotional video that reveals that the mascot is a result of a joint venture between two conglomerates, whose mascots, a fish and a lightbulb, merge to form Mr. Sparkle; the similarity to Homer is a mere coincidence. Ned calls Marge for help: the delinquents Jimbo, Dolph and Kearney, are loitering outside his store, the Leftorium. At her suggestion, he tries to shoo them away, but they harass him. Ned calls Marge again, but when the bullies cut the phone cord, Marge assumes that Ned has hung up and that everything is fine. The next morning, Maude informs Marge that Ned is missing. Marge goes to Lovejoy for help, and they track Ned to the zoo, where Japanese tourists think Homer is Mr. Sparkle. Lovejoy rescues Ned from the baboon enclosure and rediscovers his passion for his career, regaling his congregation with the tale of Ned's rescue. Production By season 8, the show had begun to explore episodes revolving around secondary characters. Reverend Lovejoy was selected for this episode because, aside from being noted as \\"the priest who didn't care\\", he had not had much character development. This was the first episode that Donick Cary wrote for The Simpsons. He was disappointed that his first story was about \\"Marge's crisis with faith.\\" The trip to the dump was inspired by Donick Cary's youth, in which he would often go \\"dump picking\\". This led to the writers deciding to have Homer's face on a discarded box, which became the Mr. Sparkle subplot. To help create the advertisement, the writers watched videos of many Japanese commercials. An original scene from Lovejoy's flashback showed that Jasper Beardley preceded him as minister of the First Church of Springfield. The solution for how Mr. Sparkle resembles Homer was written by George Meyer, after hours of time had been spent trying to come up with a realistic ending. Matsumura Fishworks was named after Ichiro Matsumura, a friend of David X. Cohen. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"In Marge We Trust\\" finished 25th in ratings for the week of April 21‚Äì27, 1997, with a Nielsen rating of 10.1, equivalent to approximately 9.8 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files and King of the Hill. The episode received critical acclaim. Authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: \\"A rare case of both storylines being worthy of full episodes in their own right, this is a cracking episode which highlights the unduly neglected Rev. Lovejoy and makes you realize Homer isn't the only one ready to kill Ned Flanders! Great stuff.\\" In a 2000 Entertainment Weekly article, Matt Groening ranked it as his fifth favorite in the history of the show. Josh Weinstein described it as one of the best of the season, as well as being one of the most underrated episodes of all time. He also described the Mr. Sparkle commercial as his all-time favorite sequence. The fake Fruity Oaty Bar commercial from the film Serenity was partially inspired by the Mr. Sparkle advertisement. Since 2009, the show's new opening sequence includes Mr. Sparkle detergent with Marge's supermarket purchases. On June 15, 2020, Comedian Eric Andre was a guest on The Last Laugh podcast and cited the episode as his favorite and ‚Äúthe hardest [he] had ever laughed‚Äù at anything on television.

A double bridle, also called a full bridle or Weymouth bridle,Gurney, Hilda. \\"Double Bridle Pros and Cons.\\" Practical Horseman Sept. 2007. is a bridle that has two bits and four reins (sometimes called \\"double reins\\"). One bit is the bradoon (or bridoon), is a modified snaffle bit that is smaller in diameter and has smaller bit rings than a traditional snaffle, and it is adjusted so that it sits above and behind the other bit, a curb bit. Another term for this combination of curb and snaffle bit is a \\"bit and bradoon\\", where the word \\"bit\\" in this particular context refers to the curb. Uses A double bridle used in the show ring. Double bridles are most commonly associated with dressage and certain horse show classes where formal tack, attire and turnout is standard. They are required for upper level FEI dressage tests (Prix St. Georges (PSG), Intermediare, and Grand Prix), and are optional at the USDF third and fourth level. They are also permitted in the dressage phase of eventing at the Intermediate or Advanced levels, although not required. (In eventing, even at the advanced level, snaffle bridles are still the norm.) Double bridles are fairly common for horse show purposes in Australia, and in the United Kingdom for show hunters and show hacks,Spencer, Chloe. \\"The Double Bridle: Its Use and Evolution.\\" Chloe Spencer Home. 2005. Archived from the original on June 18, 2006. Accessed July 20, 2008. but are less common at shows in the United States, except for Saddle seat, show hack and upper level Dressage competition. Additionally, ladies riding side saddle traditionally use a double bridle. Double bridles used to be seen on show hunters in the United States, but have been replaced by the snaffle. Double bridles are rarely used by show jumping riders and eventers in the stadium and cross-country phases. The double bridle is still sometimes used by cavalry and police horses. While the snaffle bridle is more common, the double bridle, in the hands of an experienced rider, is able to transmit more nuanced commands and obtain more sophisticated responses from the horse. Thus, for advanced forms of riding, it is preferred. History Riding on the curb only. Double bridles, originally called \\"full bridles\\", were much more common several hundred years ago. They were considered the \\"proper\\" equipment for a trained rider and horse, while a simple snaffle bridle was only for green horses and riders, young children, grooms, and poor riders. The double bridle is commonly seen in old paintings of hunt scenes, used by the well-trained gentry as they rode cross-country. Although the modern ideal is for balance between the snaffle and the curb, and most riders today tend to employ the bradoon for the majority of commands, historically, the accomplished rider would \\"ride on the curb.\\" Riding on the curb indicated lightness in the mouth, was a demonstration that both horse and rider had been highly trained, and that the rider had very good control of his or her hands, and was able to ride the horse mainly from the seat. The rider would keep a modest contact with the curb bit to regulate collection and only engage the bradoon bit to raise the head or reinforce leg and seat aids for impulsion and direction if those aids failed to achieve their effect. With a supremely trained horse and rider, not only would the horse be ridden on the curb only, but with placing both sets reins in one hand and carrying the whip upright in the other. Today, the tradition of riding only on the curb is preserved by classical and advanced military riders, and it is possible to see such performances at the Spanish Riding School. It is also used on finished horses in western riding. The tradition of riding with double reins in one hand is preserved by polo players, where double reins remain the norm but the double bridle has been largely replaced by the pelham bit or the gag bit. The double bridle was once used frequently by fox hunters, as they could employ the bradoon at the beginning of the hunt, and then use the curb if the horse became excessively excited and forward as the hunt continued. Additionally, it allowed women, confined to riding sidesaddle at the time, to ride hotter horses, with the option of using the curb rein if the horse began to pull too much.Nimrod. The Horse and the Hound. Edinburgh: Adam and Charles Black. 1943. Many eventers also used to ride with the double bridle when going cross- country on exceptionally high-strung horses. However, this practice has fallen out of favor, with most riders preferring the pelham instead, which is less harsh should the rider accidentally make a mistake. Additionally, the pelham could be used with bit converters, which allowed for one rein and made the bit much easier to handle. Adjustment and parts A \\"bit and bradoon\\" (curb and snaffle), the two bits of the double bridle Detail of a \\"bit and bradoon\\", long-shanked curb and thin bradoon traditional in Saddle seat style riding The double bridle differs from the usual snaffle bridle in that it consists of four reins attached to two separate bits: the bradoon-style snaffle and a curb. The curb bit hangs down from the main headstall, and the bradoon has a separate, simpler headstall made from a narrow piece of leather known as a \\"bradoon hanger\\" or a \\"slip head.\\" The bradoon headstall lies under the curb headstall, with the browband of the bridle holding both pieces, as well as the cavesson all together as a single unit. A bradoon is a snaffle bit designed specifically for use in the double bridle. The bit mouthpiece is usually single-jointed, and the bit ring is usually a loose-ring, less often an eggbutt, or baucher. The rings are smaller in diameter (maximum 8 centimeters) than a regular snaffle bit, and for USDF competition, the mouthpiece must be at least 3/8\\" in diameter when used on a horse, with smaller diameters allowed for ponies. It is especially important to choose a bradoon that is the correct width. A bradoon that is too wide may get caught on top of the port of the curb bit and push the bridoon's joint upward into the upper palate, while one that is too narrow will pinch the horse's skin against his molars.Politz, Gerhard. \\"Use of the Double Bridle.\\" Dressage Today August 2008: 47-58 Both cases are painful and should be avoided. In general, the bradoon should be about 1/2\\" wider than the Weymouth. The curb bit, or Weymouth, consists of a mouthpiece with shanks and a curb chain. In USDF competition, the lower shank may be no longer than 10 cm (about 4\\") in length. With a sliding mouthpiece, this measurement is taken when the mouthpiece is at its highest point. The width of the curb bit is also important: a curb that is too narrow will cause the shanks to pinch the lips, one that is too wide will cause the lips to be pinched between the curb and the curb chain and may also cause it to lie unevenly in the mouth. The upper shank should bend slightly outward, to prevent it from pinching when the reins are pulled. The severity of the curb is determined by several factors: longer shanks are considered more severe, as are tighter or thinner curb chains and higher ports. The bradoon always lies higher in the horse's mouth than the curb bit, and is placed above the curb chain. It is common to place the bradoon a bit higher in the mouth than a snaffle used alone, because it is less likely to get caught on the curb. However, it is important that the bits do not lie too far apart from each other within the mouth, as the tongue may be caught between the two. In general, both bits are chosen to be slightly thinner. Although this increases their severity, most horses prefer thinner bits because it allows for more room for the tongue, which can be uncomfortably cramped with two thick bits sharing the space. The bradoon rein should be wider than the rein used on the curb bit and in sport horse disciplines is often a bit more grippy (laced or, less often, rubber reins are popular), while the curb rein is thinner and smooth. This makes it easy for the rider to distinguish the two by feel. The extra grip provided by the snaffle rein also helps prevent the horse from pulling it through the rider's hands, which would make the curb rein shorter in comparison and encourage the rider to over-use the curb rein. When using a double bridle, a cavesson is always used. It should not be adjusted too low, as it may cause the skin and lip to pinch between it and the bradoon. Some riders use a padded crownpiece because the curb places pressure on the poll. Use=Action= The bradoon bit works like any other snaffle, placing pressure on the lips, tongue, and to some extent the bars of the mouth. In the classical dressage tradition, the bradoon is used to regulate horizontal flexion (bending the horse left and right) and impulsion (faster and slower). Any action that is meant to place pressure on one side of the mouth must be performed with the bradoon, because the curb is designed in such a way that a pull on one rein will produce equal pressure across the tongue and bars, unless it is extremely harsh. Additionally, use of only one rein of the curb causes the bit to twist in the mouth and the chain to pinch. The curb bit places pressure on the bars, the palate (especially if the port of the curb bit is fairly large), and via the curb chain, the poll and chin groove. It is used to regulate vertical flexion (cresting the neck and collecting the body through an arched spine), and the poll pressure asks the horse to lower the poll and telescope the neck to raise the base of the neck. If the horse tries to push his nose outward without permission from the rider, the curb reins will automatically come into play and tighten, asking the horse to flex. If the horse stiffens, adding slight poll and tongue pressure with the curb can ask him to relax at the poll. Overuse of the curb causes the horse to draw back his tongue and gape A rider may increase pressure on the curb alone by lifting their hands forward and upward. The hands remain the same distance from the bradoon because they move around a circle that is a radius equal to that of the bradoon rein. Therefore, the action of the bradoon does not come into play. However, because the curb rein is several inches below the bradoon, raising the hands pull upward on the bit and engages the shank. When used in Saddle seat tradition, particularly in the United States, the bradoon is used both to raise the head and turn, while the curb is used to lower the head, soften the jaw, and to slow the horse. In saddle seat riding, contact is to be maintained equally on all four reins. In modern dressage, most riders employing the double bridle \\"ride on the bradoon.\\" In other words, they keep a steady contact with the bradoon bit and only engage the curb bit to when necessary to encourage the horse to collect. As a result, the bradoon rein keeps slightly more pressure, and the curb rein, although in contact, is much softer. In competition, total loss of rein contact of the curb (which will result in the rein being bowed) will cause a severe deduction from the rider's score. To ride mainly from the bradoon while still keeping a soft contact on the curb, the rider must have steady, soft hands and a correct hand position. To activate the bradoon separately from the curb, if the rider is using the most common rein holds (described below), the rider simply rotates the lower fingers into the hand and slightly upward, which will tighten pressure on the bradoon. The upper part of the hand, where the curb is held, remains in the same point in space and acts as a pivot, so that the pressure on the curb does not change. =Dangers of misuse= Riders must be skilled before attempting to use the double bridle, and the horse should be far enough along in his training that the double bridle would be accepted and understood. It is a refined piece of equipment that can greatly enhance the riding in good hands, or destroy the animal's training and mouth. Because it uses two bits, it has a much greater chance of damaging the horse's mouth if used incorrectly. The rider must have an independent seat and soft hands. Additionally, they should be able to keep their horse moving uphill with elevated shoulders, or else activating the curb will cause him to hollow, fall onto the forehand, and flex incorrectly at the 3rd vertebra rather than the poll. The rider must also take care to determine if a double bridle is proper for the individual horse's training and temperament. Certain sensitive horses will do better if kept in a snaffle for a longer period of time. Horses that tend to be lazy or behind their rider's leg will also become more so if ridden in double bridle before they are consistently forward. Overuse of the curb will cause the horse to go behind the bit, open his mouth, draw his tongue back in his mouth to escape the pressure, or damage the tongue. Additionally, it can cause unpure gaits, including a \\"pacey\\" walk, a stiff trot, and a 4-beat canter. Overuse of the somewhat thin bradoon can lead to a hard mouth, and in severe cases, cause sores or bleeding at the corners of the mouth. =Martingales= If a running martingale is used with a double bridle, only the snaffle reins should run through the rings. Running curb reins through the martingale creates excessive amounts of leverage and can cause pain to the horse if misused. While fox hunters once were known to ride with a running martingale attached to the curb rein, today this practice is relatively non-existent, partly because the double bridle is only common in equestrian disciplines that usually do not use a running martingale. However, if a running martingale is used on the curb, however ill-advised, it is extremely important to use rein stops, as the martingale ring is sometimes larger than the ring on the curb bit shank, and can get caught on the bit with potentially disastrous consequences. Holding the reins Military rein hold When first learning to use the double bridle, it can be helpful to gain experience holding and manipulating two reins without actually using the more severe curb. To do so, the rider may place two reins on the snaffle. A rider may also ride on contact with the snaffle rein, keeping the curb rein loose until the hold becomes comfortable and familiar. There are several types of rein holds which offer various degrees of action between both bits. =Military rein hold (4 reins in one hand)= The traditional cavalry hold has the rider place all four reins in the left hand; in this way, the right hand is left free to hold a sword, lance, or other weapon. The precise order of reins has varied from era to era, from country to country, and to suit specific circumstances of battle or pageantry. In every case, a great deal of precise control is needed to selectively engage the bradoon or curb independently. Less schooled troopers may ride while engaging only a single pair of reins for one bit, and allowing the reins for the second bit to bow and thereby apply only the passive effect of gravity on that bit. This rein hold is also seen in competitive dressage, during FEI freestyle tests. It demonstrates the horse's throughness, self-carriage, and obedience due to the fact that the rider has little control with the reins except to create flexion. When used, it can increase the difficulty of the movement, thereby helping the rider attain a higher score if executed well. 2 to 2 hold with the curb rein higher. Click to enlarge =\\"2 to 2\\" rein holds, with more pressure on the bradoon= \\"2 to 2 holds\\" involve the rider holding two reins in each hand. The two most commonly used in the United States allow for softer use of the curb rein. In one such hold, the rider holds the bradoon rein under the fourth finger (pinkie or little finger), and the curb between the third and fourth fingers. In the second method, the bradoon is held between the third (ring) and fourth finger, and the curb between the second and third fingers. The latter is in some ways preferable, because the rider continues to hold the snaffle rein between the ring finger and pinkie, in the same manner as when riding with a snaffle alone, and so will already have the feel developed for that use. Additionally, pressure from the bradoon rein pushing on the underside of the little finger can encourage riders to raise their hands, because it will feel as if there is not longer a perfectly straight line from elbow to bit. In either case, the reins cross one another, the rider should be sure that the curb rein crosses under the bradoon when the horse is viewed from the side, so that it is closer to the neck. Both these holds allow for the rider to flex his or her hand and apply slightly more contact to the bradoon than to the curb, allowing it to be softer. In both cases, the ends of the reins usually leave the fist between the thumb and index finger, as seen when riding with just a snaffle rein. However, another variation allows the end of the snaffle rein to leave between the first and second fingers, and the end of the curb to leave between the thumb and first finger. This allows the rider to easily identify each rein and adjust the tension on each. It also helps to avoid too much tension on the curb rein. 2 to 2 hold with the curb rein lower. Click to enlarge =\\"2 to 2\\" rein holds, with more pressure on the curb= There are several rein holds which increase the ratio of curb to bradoon pressure. In all these cases, the curb rein is held lower down in the hand than the bradoon, so that the two reins do not cross when the horse is viewed from the side. As the distance increases between where the two reins insert into the hand, the curb reins becomes more and more prominent when rein pressure is applied. This is because the curb has greater action when the lower part of the hand is flexed back. This hold is usually used if the horse is especially hard-mouthed, easily distractible, or needs a bit more curb action because he tries to raise his head. It should only be applied by riders with exceptionally soft hands who have a good foundation in using the double bridle. Two of the mild forms of this type of hold involve the curb rein either under the fourth finger, or between the fourth and third finger, while holding the bradoon between the second and third fingers. The most extreme form of this is called the \\"Fillis Hold\\", named after James Fillis. It involves the curb rein being held under the pinkie, and the bradoon rein held like a driving rein, between the thumb and first finger. The two reins therefore insert into the hand as far away as they possibly could and allow each set to be used with considerable leverage. Therefore, either rein can be used without the influence of the other, simply by rotating the lower or upper part of the hand back. This hold is commonly seen used (correctly) by the dressage rider Philipe Karl. However, when used incorrectly, which can be extremely easy to do even by excellent riders, it causes the horse to flex at the third vertebra instead of the poll, a major fault. The 3-to-1 hold, with the right bradoon rein in the right hand, and the rest in the left. =\\"3 to 1\\" rein hold= In the 3 to 1 rein hold, one hand (historically, the left hand) holds three reins and the other only one rein. The three-rein hand controls both curb reins and the bradoon rein which belongs to that side, and the other hand simply holds the other bradoon rein and the whip. It is a hold that was common to the classical dressage tradition. Today the 3 to 1 rein hold is used while training, rather than competition, although it is still seen used by the Spanish Riding School. The left hand holds the left bradoon rein below the fourth finger (pinkie), the left hand curb rein between the third and fourth fingers, and the right hand curb between the second and third fingers. It is held right over the pommel of the saddle. The right hand holds the bradoon as it would normally hold a snaffle (between the third and fourth fingers), and the hand is held very close to the left hand. This hold has several important consequences: it decreases the action of the curb, it prevents the rider from riding with their hands too wide or performing an overzealous opening rein with their left hand, and it shows when the horse is not properly straight, because the rider can no longer make the rein pressure on one side of the mouth any stronger than the other, since reins from both sides are held in the left hand. The rider must ride off the seat and legs to bend the horse, and the horse must therefore be properly \\"through\\". Riding on the curb. =Riding on the curb only (auf blanker Kandare reiten)= The bridoon reins are dropped on the neck near the withers, and contact is kept only with the curb, both reins being held in the left hand. This means that the rider must have good hands, a well-developed seat, and the horse must accept the bit, or else the horse will end up overbent. The rider can only create bend in the horse with the seat and legs, not the hands. The whip is held upright in the right hand, going back to the tradition where the sword would be held in such a way as a salute. This method is rarely practiced today, although still seen used by the Spanish Riding School, the Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre, and the mounted troops of the household cavalry in London, England. The method is also mandatory at the higher levels of the equestrian discipline of Working Equitation. Western riding A distantly related variation on the English double bridle is the \\"two rein\\" setup used in the western riding classic vaquero tradition (also known as the \\"buckaroo\\" or \\"California\\" tradition) of developing a \\"spade bit\\" horse. Rather than use of a bit and bradoon, the trainer uses a thin bosal style hackamore over a complex type of curb bit known as a spade. This tradition originated with the same haute ecole and military uses of horses in the Middle Ages, but developed differently from classical dressage since approximately the 16th century, when Spanish horse trainers arrived in the Americas. In this tradition, the ultimate goal is use of one hand on the spade alone. A young horse is started in a bosal, then is transitioned into the spade by wearing both the spade bit with progressively smaller diameter bosals, with the rider usually carrying the reins in the 3 in 1 hold. The reins of the spade bit are romal style, with light chains or small lead weights added between the bit and the rein so that it balances perfectly in the mouth of the horse. Over time the trainer uses the bosal less and less until the horse travels with lightness and collection on the spade alone. The process of moving from a bosal alone to a \\"straight up\\" spade bit horse using the spade alone can take many years, as long as it takes to bring a Dressage horse to Grand Prix level. For practical working purposes, the modern cowboy of the vaquero or \\"buckaroo\\" tradition usually keeps a light bosal on the finished horse as a type of noseband.Elvaquero.comLesliedesmond.com See also *Bridle *English riding *Horse tack ReferencesExternal links *How to fit a double bridle Category:Headgear (horse) ","title":"Double bridle"},{"id":"2301322","text":"Superfecundation is the fertilization of two or more ova from the same cycle by sperm from separate acts of sexual intercourse, which can lead to twin babies from two separate biological fathers. The term superfecundation is derived from fecund, meaning the ability to produce offspring. Homopaternal superfecundation refers to the fertilization of two separate ova from the same father, leading to fraternal twins; while heteropaternal superfecundation is referred to as a form of atypical twinning where, genetically, the twins are half siblings. Superfecundation, while rare, can occur through either a complex single occurrence of sexual intercourse, separate occurrences of sexual intercourse, or through artificial insemination.  Conception  Superfecundation most commonly happens within hours or days of the first instance of fertilization with ova released during the same cycle. The time window when eggs are able to be fertilized is small. Sperm cells can live inside a female's body for three days. Once ovulation occurs, the egg remains viable for 12‚Äì48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. Thus, the fertile period can span five to seven days. Ovulation is usually suspended during pregnancy to prevent further ova becoming fertilized and to help increase the chances of a full-term pregnancy. However, if an ovum is released after the female was already impregnated when previously ovulating, a chance of a second pregnancy occurs, albeit at a different stage of development. This is known as superfetation. Heteropaternal superfecundation in mammals Heteropaternal superfecundation is common in animals such as cats and dogs. Stray dogs can produce litters in which every puppy has a different sire. Though rare in humans, cases have been documented. In one study on humans, the frequency was 2.4% among dizygotic twins whose parents had been involved in paternity suits. Cases in Hellenism Hellenism holds many cases of superfecundation: * Leda lies with both her husband Tyndareus and with the god Zeus, the latter in the guise of a swan. Nine months later, she bears two daughters: Clytemnestra by Tyndareus and Helen by Zeus. This happens again; this time Leda bears two sons: Castor by Tyndareus and Pollux by Zeus. * Alcmene lies with Zeus, who is disguised as her husband Amphitryon; Alcmene later lies with the real Amphitryon and gives birth to two sons: Iphicles by Amphitryon and Heracles by Zeus. Selected cases involving superfecundation In 1982, twins who were born with two different skin colors were discovered to be conceived as a result of heteropaternal superfecundation.https://www.scopus.com/record/display.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0020008620&origin;=inward&txGid;=F6227767DB3CDB724EA92EFC60A5A985.wsnAw8kcdt7IPYLO0V48gA%3a2 In 1995, a young woman gave birth to diamniotic monochorionic twins, who were originally assumed to be monozygotic twins until a paternity suit led to a DNA test. This led to the discovery that the twins had different fathers. In 2001, a case of spontaneous monopaternal superfecundation was reported after a woman undergoing IVF treatments gave birth to quintuplets after only two embryos were implanted. Genetic testing supported that the twinning was not a result of the embryos splitting, and that all five boys shared the same father. In 2016, an IVF-implanted surrogate mother gave birth to two children: one genetically unrelated child from an implanted embryo, and a biological child from her own egg and her husband's sperm. In 2019, a Chinese woman was reported to have two babies from different fathers, one of whom was her husband and the other was a man having a secret affair with her during the same time.

Used for disaster recovery, Parallel Sysplex combines data sharing and parallel computing to allow a cluster of up to 32 systems to share a workload for high performance and high availability. Sysplex In 1990, IBM mainframe computers introduced the concept of a Systems Complex, commonly called a Sysplex, with MVS/ESA SPV4.1. This allows authorized components in up to eight logical partitions (LPARs) to communicate and cooperate with each other using the XCF protocol. Components of a Sysplex include: * A common time source to synchronize all member systems' clocks. This can involve either a Sysplex timer (Model 9037), or the Server Time Protocol (STP) * Global Resource Serialization (GRS), which allows multiple systems to access the same resources concurrently, serializing where necessary to ensure exclusive access * Cross System Coupling Facility (XCF), which allows systems to communicate peer-to-peer * Couple Data Sets (CDS) Users of a (base) Sysplex include: * Console services ‚Äì allowing one to merge multiple MCS consoles from the different members of the Sysplex, providing a single system image for Operations * Automatic Restart Manager (ARM) ‚Äì Policy to direct automatic restart of failed jobs or started tasks on the same system if it is available or on another LPAR in the Sysplex * Sysplex Failure Manager (SFM) ‚Äì Policy that specifies automated actions to take when certain failures occur such as loss of a member of a Sysplex or when reconfiguring systems * Workload Manager (WLM) ‚Äì Policy based performance management of heterogeneous workloads across one or more z/OS images or even on AIX * Global Resource Serialization (GRS) - Communication ‚Äì allows use of XCF links instead of dedicated channels for GRS, and Dynamic RNLs * Tivoli OPC ‚Äì Hot standby support for the controller * RACF (IBM's mainframe security software product) ‚Äì Sysplex-wide RVARY and SETROPTS commands * PDSE file sharing * Multisystem VLFNOTE, SDUMP, SLIP, DAE * Resource Measurement Facility (RMF) ‚Äì Sysplex-wide reporting * CICS ‚Äì uses XCF to provide better performance and response time than using VTAM for transaction routing and function shipping. * zFS ‚Äì Using XCF communication to access data across multiple LPARs Parallel Sysplex Schematic representation of a Parallel Sysplex The Parallel Sysplex was introduced with the addition of the Coupling Facility (CF) with coupling links for high speed communication, with MVS/ESA V5.1 operating system support, together with the mainframe models in April 1994. The Coupling Facility (CF) may reside on a dedicated stand-alone server configured with processors that can run Coupling Facility control code (CFCC), as integral processors on the mainframes themselves configured as ICFs (Internal Coupling Facilities), or less common, as normal LPARs. The CF contains Lock, List, and Cache structures to help with serialization, message passing, and buffer consistency between multiple LPARs. The primary goal of a Parallel Sysplex is to provide data sharing capabilities, allowing multiple databases for direct reads and writes to shared data. This can provide benefits of * Help remove single points of failure within the server, LPAR, or subsystems * Application Availability * Single System Image * Dynamic Session Balancing * Dynamic Transaction Routing * Scalable capacity Databases running on the System z server that can take advantage of this include: * DB2 * IBM Information Management System (IMS). * VSAM (VSARM/RLS) * IDMS * Adabas * DataCom * Oracle Other components can use the Coupling Facility to help with system management, performance, or reduced hardware requirements. Called ‚ÄúResource Sharing‚Äù, uses include: * Catalog ‚Äì shared catalogs to improve performance by reducing I/O to a catalog data set on disk * CICS ‚Äì Using the CF to provide sharing and recovery capabilities for named counters, data tables, or transient data * DFSMShsm ‚Äì Workload balancing for data migration workload * GRS Star ‚Äì Reduced CPU and response time performance for data set allocation.

Functions include LPAR CPU management, IRD. Multi-system enclave management for improved performance * XCF Star ‚Äì Reduced hardware requirements and simplified management of XCF communication paths Major components of a Parallel Sysplex include: * Coupling Facility (CF or ICF) hardware, allowing multiple processors to share, cache, update, and balance data access; * Sysplex Timers or Server Time Protocol to synchronize the clocks of all member systems; * High speed, high quality, redundant cabling; * Software (operating system services and, usually, middleware such as DB2). The Coupling Facility may be either a dedicated external system (a small mainframe, such as a System z9 BC, specially configured with only coupling facility processors) or integral processors on the mainframes themselves configured as ICFs (Internal Coupling Facilities). It is recommended that at least one external CF be used in a parallel sysplex. It is recommended that a Parallel Sysplex has at least two CFs and/or ICFs for redundancy, especially in a production data sharing environment. Server Time Protocol (STP) replaced the Sysplex Timers beginning in 2005 for System z mainframe models z990 and newer. A Sysplex Timer is a physically separate piece of hardware from the mainframe, whereas STP is an integral facility within the mainframe's microcode. With STP and ICFs it is possible to construct a complete Parallel Sysplex installation with two connected mainframes. Moreover, a single mainframe can contain the internal equivalent of a complete physical Parallel Sysplex, useful for application testing and development purposes. The IBM Systems Journal dedicated a full issue to all the technology components. Server Time Protocol Maintaining accurate time is important in computer systems. For example, in a transaction- processing system the recovery process reconstructs the transaction data from log files. If time stamps are used for transaction-data logging, and the time stamps of two related transactions are transposed from the actual sequence, then the reconstruction of the transaction database may not match the state before the recovery process. Server Time Protocol (STP) can be used to provide a single time source between multiple servers. Based on Network Time Protocol concepts, one of the System z servers is designated by the HMC as the primary time source (Stratum 1). It then sends timing signals to the Stratum 2 servers through use of coupling links. The Stratum 2 servers in turn send timing signals to the Stratum 3 servers. To provide availability, one of the servers can be designated as a backup time source, and a third server can be designated as an Arbiter to assist the Backup Time Server in determining if it should take the role of the Primary during exception conditions. STP has been available on System z servers since 2005. More information on STP is available in ‚ÄúServer Time Protocol Planning Guide‚Äù. Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex Geographically Dispersed Parallel Sysplex (GDPS) is an extension of Parallel Sysplex of mainframes located, potentially, in different cities. GDPS includes configurations for single site or multiple site configurations: * GDPS HyperSwap Manager: This is based on synchronous Peer to Peer Remote Copy (PPRC) technology for use within a single data center. Data is copied from the primary storage device to a secondary storage device. In the event of a failure on the primary storage device, the system automatically makes the secondary storage device the primary, usually without disrupting running applications. * GDPS Metro: This is based on synchronous data mirroring technology (PPRC) that can be used on mainframes apart. In a two-system model, both sites can be administered as if they were one system. In the event of a failure of a system or storage device, recovery can occur automatically, with limited or no data loss. * GDPS Global - XRC: This is based on asynchronous Extended Remote Copy (XRC) technology with no restrictions on distance. XRC copies data on storage devices between two sites such that only a few seconds of data may be lost in the event of a failure. If a failure does occur, a user must initiate the recovery process. Once initiated, the process is automatic in recovering from secondary storage devices and reconfiguring systems. * GDPS Global - GM: This is based on asynchronous IBM Global Mirror technology with no restrictions on distance. It is designed for recovery from a total failure at one site. It will activate secondary storage devices and backup systems. * GDPS Metro Global - GM: This is a configuration for systems with more than two systems/sites, for purposes of disaster recovery. It is based on GDPS Metro together with GDPS Global - GM. * GDPS Metro Global - XRC: This is a configuration for systems with more than two systems/sites for purposes of disaster recovery. It is based on GDPS Metro together with GDPS Global - XRC. * GDPS Continuous Availability: This is a disaster recovery / continuous availability solution, based on two or more sites, separated by unlimited distances, running the same applications and having the same data to provide cross-site workload balancing. IBM Multi-site Workload Lifeline, through its monitoring and workload routing, plays an integral role in the GDPS Continuous Availability solution.

Early life  Konstantin Tih was a wealthy Bulgarian boyar (or nobleman) whose estates were located in the region of Sofia or Skopje. Konstantin stated in his charter to the Saint George Monastery near Skopje that Stefan Nemanja of Serbia was his grandfather. The Byzantine historian, George Pachymeres, described him as a \\"half-Serbian\\". He could have been related to the Serbian royal house through either his mother or father. If he was a patrilinear relative of Nemanja, his father, Tih, may have been the son of Nemanja's brother, Tihomir, according to historian Srdjan Pirivatriƒá. Pirivatriƒá and other scholars also say, Konstantin may have been a son or a nephew of the Bulgarian boyar John Tihomir, who controlled Skopje in the late 12th century. If Konstantin was related to the Serbian royal house through his mother, a daughter or a niece of Nemanja must have been his mother.  Reign = Ascension = Konstantin Tih mounted the Bulgarian throne after the death of Michael II Asen, but the circumstances of his ascension are obscure. Michael Asen was murdered by his cousin, Kaliman in late 1256 or early 1257. Before long, Kaliman was also killed, and the male line of the Asen dynasty died out. Rostislav Mikhailovich, Duke of Macs√≥ (who was Michael and Kaliman's father-in-law), and the boyar Mitso (who was Michael's brother-in-law), laid claim to Bulgaria. Rostislav captured Vidin, Mitso held sway over southeastern Bulgaria, but none of them could secure the support of the boyars who controlled Tarnovo. The latter offered the throne Konstantin who accepted the election. Konstantin divorced his first wife (whose name is unknown), and married Irene Doukaina Laskarina in 1258. Irene was the daughter of Theodore II Laskaris, Emperor of Nicaea, and Elena of Bulgaria, a daughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. The marriage with a descendant of the Bulgarian royal family strengthened his position. He was thereafter called Konstantin Asen. The marriage also forged an alliance between Bulgaria and Nicaea, which was confirmed one or two years later, when the Byzantine historian and official George Akropolites came to Tarnovo. = Conflict with Hungary = Rostislav Mikhailovich invaded Bulgaria with Hungarian assistance in 1259. In the following year, Rostislav left his duchy to join the campaign of his father-in-law, B√©la IV of Hungary, against Bohemia. Taking advantage of Rostislav's absence, Konstantin broke into his realm and reoccupied Vidin. He also sent an army to attack the Banate of Severin, but the Hungarian commander, Lawrence, fought the invaders off. The Bulgarian invasion of Severin outraged B√©la IV. Soon after he concluded a peace treaty with Ottokar II of Bohemia in March 1261, Hungarian troops stormed into Bulgaria under the command of B√©la IV's son and heir, Stephen. They captured Vidin and besieged Lom on the Lower Danube, but they were unable to bring Konstantin to a pitched battle, because he withdrew to Tarnovo. The Hungarian army left Bulgaria before the end of the year, but the campaign restored northwestern Bulgaria to Rostislav. = War with the Byzantine Empire = Bulgaria c.1260 Konstantin's minor brother-in-law, John IV Laskaris, was dethroned and blinded by his former guardian and co-ruler, Michael VIII Palaiologos, before the end of 1261. Michael VIII's army had occupied Constantinople already in July, thus the coup made him the sole ruler of the restored Byzantine Empire. The rebirth of the empire changed the traditional relations between the powers of the Balkan Peninsula. Furthermore, Konstantine's wife decided to take vengeance of her brother's mutilation and persuaded Konstantine to turn against Michael. Mitso, who still held southeastern Bulgaria, made an alliance with the Byzantines, but another powerful nobleman, Jacob Svetoslav, who had taken control of the southwestern region, was loyal to Konstantine. Benefiting from a war between the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice, Achaea and Epirus, Konstantine invaded Thrace and captured Stanimaka and Philippopolis (now Asenovgrad and Plovdiv in Bulgaria) in the autumn of 1262. Mitso was also forced to flee to Mesembria (now Nesebar in Bulgaria). After Konstantine laid siege to the town, Mitso sought assistance from the Byzantines, offering to surrender Mesembria to them in exchange for landed property in the Byzantine Empire. Michael VIII accepted the offer and sent Michael Glabas Tarchaneiotes to help Mitso in 1263. A second Byzantine army stormed into Thrace and recaptured Stanimaka and Philippopolis. After seizing Mesembria from Mitso, Glabas Tarchaneiotes continued his campaign along the Black Sea and occupied Agathopolis, Sozopolis and Anchialos (now Ahtopol, Sozopol and Pomorie in Bulgaria). Meanwhile, the Byzantine fleet took control of Vicina and other ports at the Danube Delta. Glabas Tarchaneiotes attacked Jacob Svetoslav who could only resist with Hungarian assistance, thus he accepted B√©la IV's suzerainty. As a consequence of the war with the Byzantines, by the end of 1263, Bulgaria lost significant territories to his two principal enemies, the Byzantine Empire and Hungary. Konstantin could only seek assistance from the Tatars of the Golden Horde to put an end to his isolation. The Tatar khans had been the overlords of the Bulgarian monarchs for almost two decades, although their rule was only formal. A former Sultan of Rum, Kaykaus II, who had been imprisoned at Michael VIII's order, also wanted to regain his throne with the Tatars' help. One of his uncles was a prominent leader of the Golden Horde and he sent messages to him to persuade the Tatars to invade the Byzantine Empire with Bulgarian assistance. According to the Byzantine historian, Nicephorus Gregoras, Kaykaus also approached Konstantin, offering much money to him if he came to release him. Thousands of Tatars crossed the frozen Lower Danube to invade the Byzantine Empire in late 1264. Konstantin soon joined them, although he had fallen from a horse and broken his leg. The united Tatar and Bulgarian armies launched a sudden attack against Michael VIII who was returning from Thessaly to Constantinople, but they could not capture the emperor. Konstantin laid siege the Byzantine fortress of Ainos (now Enez in Turkey), forcing the defenders to surrender. The Byzantines also agreed to release Kaykaus (who soon left for the Golden Horde), but his family was kept imprisoned even thereafter. = Disintegration = Konstantine's alliance with the Tatars strengthened his position. Jacob Svetoslav again accepted his suzerainty. Taking advantage of a civil war in Hungary, Jacob Svetoslav also invaded the Banate of Severin. The Hungarian civil war ended with the division of the country between B√©la IV and Stephen in March 1266. Stephen launched a military campaign against Bulgaria and captured Vidin in June. Konstantin tried to resist, but the Hungarians defeated his army and plundered the region of Tarnovo. The Hungarians captured Pleven and other fortresses on the Danube and forced Jacob Svetoslav to again do homage to Stephen. Thereafter Jacob Svetoslav was styled as \\"emperor of Bulgaria\\" in the Hungarian royal charters. Golden seal of Konstantin Asen. Inscription in Bulgarian: \\"+Konstantin, in Christ the God, a faithful tsar and autocrat of the Bulgarians, Asen.\\" Charles I of Sicily and Baldwin II, the dispossessed Latin Emperor of Constantinople, made an alliance against the Byzantine Empire in 1267. To prevent Bulgaria from joining the anti-Byzantine coalition, Michael VIII offered his niece, Maria Palaiologina Kantakouzene, to the widowed Konstantin in 1268. The emperor also pledged that he would return Mesembria and Anchialos to Bulgaria as her dowry if she gave birth to a son. Konstantin married Maria, but Michael VIII broke his promise and did not renounce the two towns after the birth of Konstantin and Maria's son, Michael. Outraged by the emperor's betrayal, Konstantin sent envoys to Charles to Naples in September 1271. The negotiations continued during the following years, showing that Konstantin was willing to support Charles against the Byzantines. Konstantin broke into Thrace in 1271 or 1272, but Michael VIII persuaded Nogai, the dominant figure in the westernmost territory of the Golden Horde, to invade Bulgaria. The Tatars plundered the country, forcing Konstantin to return and abandon his claim to the two towns. Nogai set up his capital in Isaccea near the Danube Delta, thus he could easily attack Bulgaria. Konstantin had been seriously injured after a riding accident and could not move without assistance, because he was paralyzed from the waist down. His ambitious wife took control of the government. After Michael VIII's envoys accepted Pope Gregory X's proposal to a church union at the Second Council of Lyon in summer 1274, she became one of the leading opponents of the union. She even tried to persuade Baibars, the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, to attack the Byzantine Empire. Maria was also determined to secure the throne to her son. Jacob Svetoslav, however, had a strong claim to succeed Konstantin, because his wife was a granddaughter of Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria. Maria first adopted Jacob Svetoslav to persuade him to acknowledge her son's right to the throne, but later she had him poisoned. He also had other noblemen captured or executed, which made Konstantin's rule unpopular. The paralyzed Konstantin could not prevent Nogai's Tatars from making regular plundering raids against Bulgaria. The local inhabitants of the regions which were most exposed to the Tatar raids had to organize the defense without the monarch's support. Due to the expensive and unsuccessful wars, repeated Mongol raids, and economic instability (Constantine was the first Bulgarian ruler to mint his own coins on a vast scale), the government was faced with a revolt in 1277. The social and economic aspects of this movement have been stressed by Marxist historians, but its true character is elusive. What is clear is that a swineherd or swine-owner named Ivaylo became a leader of the discontented and attracted many (presumably mostly lower-class)\\"History of Bulgaria.

It was released by Red Light District Video in 2004. While Waltman and Laurer were engaged at the time they made the film, they broke up before it was released. Laurer, who died in April 2016, subsequently made several pornographic films, beginning with Another Night in China in 2009, which is considered to be a sequel to 1 Night in China. Plot The film features scenes of Laurer and Waltman taking a guided tour of China, intercut with footage of the pair participating in explicit anal, vaginal, and oral sex acts, with special emphasis on an anal sex scene, which serves as the climax of the film. Waltman admits to being under the influence of methamphetamine and marijuana during much of the film. Etymology The title of the film is a play on words, as Laurer wrestled in the World Wrestling Federation under the ring name Chyna (pronounced China). A similarly named sex tape featuring Paris Hilton, also distributed by Red Light District, was titled 1 Night in Paris. Distribution Laurer and Waltman approached Red Light District Video in late 2004 to distribute the tape. The film sold over 100,000 copies. According to the company, both Laurer and Waltman shared in the profits. Because of the film, Laurer received a career boost, soon appearing as a cast member on The Surreal Life on VH1.

It was directed by Richard Whorf and written by Fred Brady and Hans Jacoby. The movie stars Ronald Colman, Celeste Holm, Vincent Price, Barbara Britton and Art Linkletter. The film was produced by Harry M. Popkin for his Cardinal Pictures and released by United Artists. Plot Beauregard Bottomley is a polymath who lives in Los Angeles with his piano-instructor sister Gwenn and an alcohol-guzzling parrot they found named Caesar. Beauregard is knowledgeable on any subject‚Äîexcept how to hold a job. In front of a store window, Beauregard and Gwenn watch a quiz show, Masquerade for Money, hosted by Happy Hogan, and sponsored by Milady Soap. Each contestant dresses up in a particular costume in which their costume determines the type of questions asked, with the prize money doubling with each correct answer, starting at $5 and reaching up to a maximum of $160. A contestant can quit anytime, but an incorrect response results in no money won, only in a reward of the consolation prize of Milady Soap. Beauregard is contemptuous of the show. A representative of the State of California Department of Employment encourages Beauregard to interview for a job at the Milady Soap Company, which he does. Beauregard meets the company's eccentric owner, Burnbridge Waters, who disapproves of Beauregard's humor and rejects him. To get even, Beauregard enters \\"Masquerade for Money\\" as a contestant, dressed as an encyclopedia, and because he does, and consistent with the rules of the show, the host can ask him about anything. Before the questions begin, Happy starts to praise the qualities of Milady Soap, but Beauregard says that it works just like any other soap, outraging Waters. Beauregard easily answers correctly the maximum six questions, then requests one more, which he also answers correctly, earning $320. Beauregard turns down the money and asks to return next week. Waters decides to invite Beauregard back for one question per show for six weeks and heavily publicizes it. During that time, \\"Masquerade for Money\\" tops the ratings, and sales of Milady Soap skyrocket. At the end of that time, Waters approves of giving Beauregard an impossibly hard question, but when Beauregard answers it correctly, Waters becomes uneasy. Happy offers to take piano lessons from Gwenn to try to find a weakness in Beauregard. Beauregard sees through the scheme, but Gwenn sneaks out on a date with Happy anyway. When Gwenn tells Happy that she and her brother think that he is just trying to get information from her, he admits that he is but also says that he is glad to have met her. Gwenn tells Happy that Beauregard intends to win $40 million, to take everything that Waters has. Happy tells Waters, who cancels the show and sends Beauregard a check for his current winnings ($40,000), which Beauregard refuses to accept. Following the series' cancellation, sales for Milady Soap plummet, forcing Waters to reinstate the show. Beauregard reaches $10 million. Waters calls in a scheming \\"Flame\\" O'Neill to distract Beauregard. Beauregard catches a cold from being in a driving rainstorm, so Flame pretends to be a nurse to him. Beauregard is aware of, but nevertheless quickly succumbs to, Flame's charms (as does Waters). Flame breaks her dinner date with Beauregard to undermine his self-confidence and peace of mind. The night of the show, Beauregard reveals that he (supposedly) never mastered Albert Einstein's \\"space-time theories\\". The next question is, of course, about Einstein's views of space-time. Realizing Flame has betrayed him, Beauregard initially struggles but eventually comes up with an answer. Happy says that Beauregard's answer is incorrect and intends to reward him the consolation prize of Milady Soap. However, Einstein himself calls on the telephone before the end of the show to say that Beauregard's answer is correct, whereupon Happy acknowledges on-air that Beauregard's answer is correct after all. Afterward, Beauregard confronts Flame, who has fallen for him. Unaware of Flame's supposed newly found fondness for him, Beauregard spanks her with her hairbrush and informs her that he deliberately misled her, that he actually \\"spent an entire season with Einstein\\", but also admits that he fell madly in love with her. Waters books the Hollywood Bowl for the last show. Happy and Gwenn, and Beauregard and Flame, each plan to marry. Beauregard and Gwenn caution each other that their would-be spouses could be just after the money. Each calls and suggests marrying before the show, but Happy and Flame each come up with excuses. For the final question, Happy asks Beauregard what his Social Security number is. Beauregard answers incorrectly. After the show, to the joy of Beauregard and Gwenn, Flame and Happy still want to marry them. Waters shows up at Beauregard's home, bearing gifts, including champagne. (Caesar used to be Waters' pet.) As Beauregard and Flame drive to Las Vegas to get married, Beauregard reveals that he and Waters had made a deal in which Beauregard would lose in exchange for getting his own radio show, some stock, and other considerations. Beauregard was motivated to make such a deal because two T men had signaled their intent to tax a significant amount of his winnings. Beauregard then admits that he actually did not know the answer. Reception In his 1950 review of the film in The New York Times, Bosley Crowther panned the film, sparing only Holm: > \\"Some of his [Vincent Price's] broad aberrations offer faintly satirical > thrusts at advertising genius, but most of them are duds. Mr. Coleman's > exquisite urbanity wears awfully thin as time goes on. ... With Celeste Holm > playing the charmer, there is some evident reason, at least, for the hero's > infatuation. But with a chap named Art Linkletter cast as the quiz-master, > we cannot fathom the basis for the sister's romance.\\" Contemporary criticism of the story indicated that the film violated Beauregard's criticism of the nature of quiz shows in its final plot twist, with Beauregard being given his own quiz showReview of Champagne for Caesar. Life, 10 April 1950, pp 119-122. \\\\- unless Beauregard were to use the opportunity to reform quiz shows by having one that is truly intellectually stimulating. Nicholas Laham has analysed the treatment of Beauregard as a highly educated, yet unemployable, character in the context of how scholars were regarded in the 1950s, and in anticipation of the unemployment of information-based, highly educated people in later decades in the information age/\\"new economy\\".

In effect, a physical machine can be partitioned into multiple logical partitions, each hosting a separate instance of an operating system. History IBM developed the concept of hypervisors (virtual machines in CP-40 and CP-67) and in 1972 provided it for the S/370 as Virtual Machine Facility/370. IBM introduced the Start Interpretive Execution (SIE) instruction (designed specifically for the execution of virtual machines) as part of 370-XA architecture on the 3081, as well as VM/XA versions of VM to exploit it. PR/SM is a type-1 Hypervisor based on the CP component of VM/XA that runs directly on the machine level and allocates system resources across LPARs to share physical resources. It is a standard feature on IBM System z only. An IBM POWER system uses PHYP (the POWER Hypervisor) to enable its LPAR functionalities for System p and System i since approximately 2000 in POWER4 systems. The terms PR/SM and LPAR are often used interchangeably in IBM Z, including in IBM documentation. Formally, LPAR designates the logical partitioning function and mode of operation, whereas PR/SM is the commercial designation of the feature. Amdahl Corporation's Multiple Domain Facility (MDF) was introduced in 1982. IBM began marketing its functionally similar PR/SM in 1988, implemented on its ESA/390 architecture released that year. MDF-based LPAR technology continued to be developed separately by Amdahl, and Hitachi Data Systems in part for their implementations of the new architecture, which featured the introduction of access registers that allowed use of multiple data spaces addressable by a single address space. IBM subsequently continued its LPAR development with its 64-bit System z and System i architectures. LPAR and PR/SM reconfigurations can be made without rebooting the computer, i.e., while some LPARs remain active. Reconfigurations can include changing channel path definitions and device definitions. z/VM supports the z/Architecture HiperSockets function for high-speed TCP/IP communication among virtual machines and logical partitions (LPARs) within the same IBM zSeries server. This function uses an adaptation of the Queued-Direct Input/Output (QDIO) high-speed I/O protocol. IBM later introduced LPARs to their iSeries and pSeries servers in 1999 and 2001, respectively, albeit with varying technical specifications. Multiple operating systems are compatible with LPARs, including z/OS, z/VM, z/VSE, z/TPF, AIX, Linux, and i/OS. In storage systems, such as the IBM TotalStorage DS8000, LPARs allow for multiple virtual instances of a storage array to exist within a single physical array. In first part of 2010 year, Fujitsu announced availability of its x86 64 PRIMEQUEST line of servers,Fujitsu Upgrades Lineup of PRIMEQUEST Mission-Critical Servers which support LPARs. In second part of 2011 year, Hitachi has announced availability of CB2000 and CB320 blade systems, which support LPAR on x86 64 hardware. Hardware partitioning Logical partitioning divides hardware resources. Two LPARs may access memory from a common memory chip, provided that the ranges of addresses directly accessible to each do not overlap. It is possible for one partition to control memory managed by a second partition indirectly by communicating with a process on the partition with direct access, which acts as an intermediary. CPUs may be dedicated to a single LPAR or shared. While on Amdahl's MDF (Multiple Domain Facility) it was possible to configure an LPAR with both shared and dedicated CPUs, this is no longer possible with any mainframes currently in the market. On IBM mainframes, LPARs are managed by the PR/SM facility or a related, optional, simplified facility called Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM). All 64-bit IBM mainframes, except for the first generation 64-bit models (z900 and z800), operate exclusively in LPAR mode, even when there is only one partition on a machine. Multiple LPARs running z/OS can form a Sysplex or Parallel Sysplex, whether on one machine or spread across multiple machines. On IBM System p POWER hardware, LPARs are managed by PHYP (the POWER Hypervisor).https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/POWER6/iphb2/iphb2hypervisor.htm PHYP acts as a virtual switch between the LPARs and also handles the virtual SCSI traffic between LPARs. Micro-Partitioning supports 10 times as many LPARs as processors with fractional allocations. It was introduced with the POWER5 processor. All IBM POWER5, POWER6, and successor systems may be partitioned. Note that a full system partition may be defined where all resources are consumed by a single partition. System P servers with PowerVM enabled allow LPARs with shared CPUs to delegate their unused cycles into the shared pool. Dedicated processors are not available for sharing. Unused cycles become available for other partitions and are governed by the parameters specified when the LPAR is defined. Changes to a running partition can be made dynamically up to the maximum value set, and down to the minimum value set in the active profile. The changing of resource allocations without restart of the logical partition is called dynamic logical partitioning. IBM PowerVM is the licensed/purchased feature that enables the virtualization features on p4, 5, 6, 7, and subsequent series servers. Exploiting Intel vPro (i.e. Non- uniform memory access), there are also implementations of Logical Partitioning based on Intel Xeon e.g. by Hitachi Data Systems. LPARs (with sufficient certification) safely allow combining multiple test, development, quality assurance, and production work on the same server, offering advantages such as lower costs, faster deployment, and more convenience. IBM mainframe LPARs are Common Criteria EAL 5+ certifiable, equivalent to physically unconnected servers, so they support the highest security requirements, including military use. Nearly all IBM mainframes run with multiple LPARs with the IBM System z9 and IBM System z10 supporting up to 60 LPARs and later models up to 85.

In 1626, he narrowly avoided punishment after being implicated as an associate of Zhou Shunchang (), who was framed and purged by the corrupt eunuch Wei Zhongxian. Appalled by the injustice, he resolved to complete his trilogy of vernacular Chinese short story collections: Stories to Instruct the World, Stories to Caution the World, and Stories to Awaken the World (Âñª‰∏ñÊòéË®Ä, Ë≠¶‰∏ñÈÄöË®Ä, and ÈÜí‰∏ñÊÅÜË®Ä), the first two volumes of which had already appeared. In recognition of his reputation as a writer, Feng was finally awarded the gongsheng degree in 1630 at the age of fifty-seven. In the subsequent year, he received his first government post as instructor of Dantu County (‰∏πÂæíÁ∏£, today Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). In 1634, he was appointed magistrate of Shouning County () in Fujian. During his tenure, he became regarded as a morally upright and diligent administrator. He retired in 1638. In 1644, the Ming state was thrown into turmoil by the sacking of Beijing by Li Zicheng's rebel army and invasion by the Manchu Qing forces. At the age of seventy-one, he published the Grand Proposals for National Rejuvenation () to inspire his countrymen to repel the invaders. He died in despair in 1646 as the Ming dynasty continued to collapse. Some works indicate or imply that he was killed by Qing soldiers. Feng's literary output consisted of the compilation of histories and local gazettes, the retelling of folktales and stories from antiquity in the form of short stories and plays, and the authorship of vernacular Chinese novels. Two of his noteworthy works are the Qing Shi (History of Love, ÊÉÖÂè≤), an anthology of classical love stories, and the shenmo novel Pingyao Zhuan. In 1620 he published the Illustrious Words to Instruct the World (Âñª‰∏ñÊòéË®Ä Yushi Mingyan), or Stories Old and New, the first part of his well-known trilogy.Stories old and new: a Ming dynasty collection. University of Washington Press Feng was a proponent of the school of Li Zhi, which supported the importance of human feelings and behavior in literature. He is frequently associated with Ling Mengchu, author of Slapping the Table in Amazement,http://www.washington.edu/uwpress/search/books/LINSLA.html a two- part collection of entertaining vernacular tales. Writing style Feng Menglong was in love with a famous prostitute when he was young. Unfortunately, Feng Menglong was not able to afford to redeem his lover out. At the end, his lover was redeemed by a merchant, and they had to leave each other. Feng Menglong suffered from pain and desperation due to the separation, and he expressed his sorrow through poems. This experience influenced the way he portrayed female characters in his stories. In fact, Feng Menglong was one of the few authors who portrayed female as being strong and intelligent; and this is different from other authors, where they tended to ignore the importance of female‚Äôs position. The female characters in Feng Menglong‚Äôs stories were portrayed as brave and bright when dealing with different situations. For instance, in his story Wan Xiuniang Takes Revenge Through Toy Pavilions from Jing Shi Tong Yan, Wan Xiuniang showed her braveness during her tough times, and she was able to escape using her intelligence. Other female characters, such as Du Shi-niang and Qu Xiuxiu, are example to show Feng Menglong‚Äôs respectful and sympathetic portrayal of female characters. Feng Menglong also expressed his attitudes towards society through his works, which were heavily influenced by his interactions with officialdom and the Chinese literati. Feng Menglong became the magistrate of Shouning near the end of his life, in his sixties. During his appointment, he sought to correct injustices and hoped to build up a reputation as an humble and upright official. Unfortunately, his efforts were frustrated by the widespread corruption of the late Ming dynasty (a theme also treated extensively in other contemporaneous works, such as Zhang Yingyu's The Book of Swindles (ca. 1617)Zhang Yingyu, The Book of Swindles: Selections from a Late Ming Collection (New York: Columbia University Press, 2017).); bribery and extortion were common bureaucratic behaviors, and themes of official malfeasance figure in many of Feng's stories. Realizing that atmosphere of corruption could not be easily changed, Feng Menglong conveyed his discontent and patriotism through words. Each character of his stories has strong and direct characteristics: there is a clear morality line drawn between ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù. Moreover, the meaning behind the stories explores the social issues during Ming Dynasty. For instance, the stories of \\"The White Maiden Locked for Eternity in Leifeng Pagoda\\" and \\"The Young Lady Gives the Young Man a Gift of Money\\" from Stories to Caution the World express the idea of how women pursued their freedom and happiness under a patriarchal society. During his tenure as magistrate of Shouning, Feng learned of the local practice of drowning female infants in the river. He authored the Public Notice on the Prohibition of the Drowning of Daughters () to appeal to parents not to carry out what he viewed as an abhorrent custom and provide for punishments for infanticidal parents and rewards for those taking in abandoned children.An excerpt: ‚Äú¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑‰∏ÄËà¨ÂçÅÊúàÊá∑ËÉéÔºåÂêÉÁõ°ËæõËã¶Ôºå‰∏çË´ñÁî∑Â•≥ÔºåÁ∏ΩÊòØÈ™®Ë°ÄÔºå‰ΩïÂøçÊ∑πÊ£Ñ„ÄÇ ÁÇ∫Áà∂ËÄÖ‰Ω†Ëá™ÊÉ≥ÔºåËã•‰∏çÊî∂Â•≥Ôºå‰Ω†Â¶ªÂæû‰ΩïËÄå‰æÜÔºüÁÇ∫ÊØçËÄÖ‰Ω†Ëá™ÊÉ≥ÔºåËã•‰∏çÊî∂Â•≥Ôºå‰Ω†Ë∫´Âæû‰ΩïËÄåÊ¥ªÔºüÊ≥Å‰∏îÁîüÁî∑Êú™ÂøÖÂ≠ùÈ†ÜÔºåÁîüÂ•≥Êú™ÂøÖÂø§ÈÄÜ„ÄÇ¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑¬∑‚Äù ...

Under UK labour law, the police are prohibited from joining ordinary trade unions to defend pay and working conditions, by the Police Act 1996, because of the view that a police strike would pose an exceptional public safety risk. The PFEW was originally established by the Police Act 1919 as an alternative system, which would serve to represent staff, and where disputes could be resolved through arbitration so long as the government (as employer) continued to bargain in good faith. There were approximately 124,000 members in 2014. Members can elect not to pay subscriptions and thereby not receive the legal representation and other benefits that paying members receive, but they still continue officially to be members of the Federation. In reality only a very few officers have ever decided not to pay their full subscription dues. Superintendents and Chief superintendents are represented by a separate staff association, the Police Superintendents' Association of England and Wales (PSA), while the most senior officers are members of the Chief Police Officers Staff Association (CPOSA). History The Police Federation of England and Wales was set up by the Police Act 1919 after two British police strikes in 1918 and 1919. The government of the day were frightened by the prospect of the police going on strike and created the Police Federation of England and Wales and withdrew the right of officers in the UK to strike. Police officers hold office and are not employees. Each officer is an independent legal official and not an \\"agent of the police force, police authority or government\\". This allows the police their unique status and notionally provides the citizens of the UK a protection from any government that might wish unlawfully to use the police as an instrument against them. Many observers mistakenly equate the Police Federation with a trade union. This is technically an incorrect assumption, as it was set up specifically by the government of the day not to be a trade union; however in reality the Federation does function in a similar manner. It negotiates with the Official Side on all matters concerning its membership's pay, allowances, hour of duty, annual leave, pensions and other conditions of service. However, unlike a union, the Federation is controlled entirely by serving police officers, has no political affiliations, and has no powers to call a strike. That is not to say that the Federation remains aloof from applying political pressure, as the successful 1976 ballot regarding the right to strike and the 2012/13 \\"Plebgate\\" affair. Organisation Each of the 43 police forces in England and Wales has its own federation branch board and council. The 43 forces are grouped into eight regions. Due to its size, the Metropolitan Police federation branch board is structured differently. At the end of December 2012, the PFEW announced it would be independently reviewed. The review was conducted by Sir David Normington and the Police Federation accepted all 36 recommendations of the review in May 2014 and is currently working through making these organisational changes. As such, an Interim National Board (INB) was set up (formerly the Joint Central Committee) which had responsibility for national pay negotiations on behalf of its members. This has now been superseded by the National Board. It also performs many other functions, such as training, administering legal representation and liaising with government and other national bodies on policy and legislative matters. The present National Board Chair is John Apter. The PFEW's HQ is at Leatherhead, Surrey, in a complex which also incorporates the federation's national training centre and a hotel facility for federation members. Past turbulence Chair and general secretary of Police Federation of England and Wales both retired after \\"turbulent period\\" on 7 April 2014. Steve Williams and Ian Rennie announced their plans to retire from the police service at the end of May. Steve White was elected as Chair and Andy Fittes elected as General Secretary at the Police Federation's Annual Conference in May 2014. At the same conference (on 21 May 2014), the Home Secretary Theresa May announced that public funding of the Police Federation would end in August 2014.

Ross, Paul Postal, and later James McCawley. George Lakoff and Pieter Seuren were also instrumental in developing and advocating the theory. The approach developed out of transformational generative grammar in the mid-1960s, but stood largely apart from, and in opposition to, work by Noam Chomsky and his later students. This move led to a more abstract framework and lately to the abandonment of the notion of the CFG formal grammar induced deep structure. A number of ideas from later work in generative semantics have been incorporated into cognitive linguistics, head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG), construction grammar, and into mainstream Chomskyan linguistics. See p. 138. \\"Interpretive\\" vs. \\"generative\\" semantics The controversy surrounding generative semantics stemmed in part from the competition between two fundamentally different approaches to semantics within transformational generative syntax. The first semantic theories designed to be compatible with transformational syntax were interpretive. Syntactic rules enumerated a set of well-formed sentences paired with syntactic structures, each of which was assigned an interpretation by the rules of a separate semantic theory. This left syntax relatively (though by no means entirely) \\"autonomous\\" with respect to semantics, and was the approach preferred by Chomsky. In contrast, generative semanticists argued that interpretations were generated directly by the grammar as deep structures, and were subsequently transformed into recognizable sentences by transformations. This approach necessitated more complex underlying structures than those proposed by Chomsky, and more complex transformations as a consequence. Despite this additional complexity, the approach was appealing in several respects. First, it offered a powerful mechanism for explaining synonymity. In his initial work in generative syntax, Chomsky motivated transformations using active/passive pairs such as \\"I hit John\\" and \\"John was hit by me\\", which despite their identical meanings have quite different surface forms. Generative semanticists wanted to account for all cases of synonymity in a similar fashion‚Äîan impressively ambitious goal before the advent of more sophisticated interpretive theories in the 1970s. Second, the theory had a pleasingly intuitive structure: the form of a sentence was quite literally derived from its meaning via transformations. To some, interpretive semantics seemed rather \\"clunky\\" and ad hoc in comparison. This was especially so before the development of trace theory. Notes There is little agreement concerning the question of whose idea generative semantics was. All of the people mentioned here have been credited with its invention (often by each other). Strictly speaking, it was not the fact that active/passive pairs are synonymous that motivated the passive transformation, but the fact that active and passive verb forms have the same selectional requirements. For example, the agent of the verb kick (i.e. the thing that's doing the kicking) must be animate whether it is the subject of the active verb (as in \\"John kicked the ball\\") or appears in a by phrase after the passive verb (\\"The ball was kicked by John\\").

It was founded in 1990 in Kansas City, Missouri, in the historic 18th & Vine District, the hub of African-American cultural activity in Kansas City during the first half of the 20th century. The NLBM shares its building with the American Jazz Museum. History The Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was founded in 1990 by a group of former Negro league baseball players, including Kansas City Monarchs outfielder, Alfred Surratt, Buck O'Neil, Larry Lester, and Horace Peterson. It moved from its original small, single-room office inside the Lincoln Building at historic 18th & Vine Streets in Kansas City to a space in 1994. Three years later, in 1997, the museum relocated again, to a , purpose-built structure five times the previous size. An advance screening of the movie 42, a biographical film about the life of Jackie Robinson, who played for the Kansas City Monarchs prior to breaking baseball's color barrier, was held in Kansas City on April 11, 2013, a day before its nationwide release, as a benefit for the NLBM. Actor Harrison Ford, one of the stars of the film, participated in the fundraiser. The museum was on the verge of financial collapse in 2008 before rebounding with stronger leadership and greater engagement with the community. Bob Kendrick took over as President in 2011. By 2012, the museum experienced a profit of $300,000, its most successful year since 2007. In June 2019, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was awarded the Gold American Award for Nonprofit Organization of the Year from the American Business Awards. Exhibits The museum chronologically charts the progress of the Negro leagues with informative placards and interactive exhibits. Its walls are lined with pictures of players, owners, and officials of Negro league baseball from the Negro National League of 1920 through the Negro American League which lasted until 1962. As visitors progress through the exhibit, they move forward in time through the history of Black baseball. In one area of the museum, there are lockers set up for some of the legends of the Negro leagues. One can see game-worn uniforms, cleats, gloves, and other artifacts from stars such as Josh Gibson, the \\"Black Babe Ruth.\\" An impressive aspect of the museum is the Field of Legends. Separated from the visitor at the entrance by chicken wire, it is accessible only at the end of the tour. One can walk onto a field adorned by nearly life-sized bronze statues of twelve figures from Negro league history. Crouching behind the plate is Gibson, one of the most prolific hitters in baseball history, a man who allegedly hit over 80 home runs in one season. At first base is another Baseball Hall of Famer, Buck Leonard, a teammate of Gibson's with the Homestead Grays. At second base is Pop Lloyd, Judy Johnson monitors shortstop, while Ray Dandridge holds down third base. In the outfield are Cool Papa Bell, Oscar Charleston, and Leon Day. On the mound is perhaps the most famous Negro leaguer of all time, Satchel Paige, who became a rookie in the major leagues at age 42 in 1948. At the plate is Mart√≠n Dihigo, the only man to be inducted into the Halls of Fame in three countries: Mexico, Cuba, and the United States. Other statues commemorate Rube Foster, the founder of the first Negro National League, and Buck O'Neil, a former Kansas City Monarch and a member of the board of the museum until his October 6, 2006, death. On November 13, 2012, the family of Buck O'Neil donated two items to the museum in honor of what would have been his 101st birthday. O'Neil's Presidential Medal of Freedom‚Äîawarded posthumously by President George W. Bush‚Äîwas donated. Also given to the museum was a miniature replica of the Buck O' Neil statue which is displayed at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. The items are showcased in a special area of the NLBM dedicated to O'Neil. =The Geddy Lee Collection= On June 5, 2008, Geddy Lee (of the Canadian band Rush), himself an avid baseball fan, donated nearly 200 autographed baseballs to the NLBM. The signatures on these baseballs include names such as Hank Aaron, Cool Papa Bell, and Lionel Hampton. At the time, Geddy Lee's gift was one of the largest single donations the NLBM had ever received.Rush's Geddy Lee gives NLBM a donation (video); The Kansas City Star; June 6, 2008.

The lockout was a subject of dispute as the players sought collective bargaining and owners sought to help franchises that had a weaker market as well as make sure they could cap the rising salaries of players. The lockout caused the 1994‚Äì95 season to be delayed and shortened to 48 games instead of 84, the shortest season in 53 years. Background Much like the later 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, the big issue was the implementation of a salary cap. The NHL owners were strongly in favor of the cap while the players were opposed to it. The NHL wanted to levy a luxury tax, a financial penalty that is assigned by the league, on salaries that were higher than the average. However, the NHL's Player Association viewed that as a variation on a salary cap and refused to accept it. This came right off the heels of the 1992 walkout by players, which interrupted the race for the Stanley Cup. This 3 month, 1 week, and 3 day lockout stretched from October 1, 1994, to January 11, 1995. A total of 468 games were lost due to the lockout, along with the All-Star Game. Unlike the league's future lockouts, the players went to training camp as if to start the season. However, as these camps came to a close it was obvious that there was to be labor talks in the near future. =The issues at hand= As previously noted, the NHL wanted to levy a luxury tax on salaries that were higher than the average and the NHLPA viewed that as a variation on a salary cap and refused to accept it. Unlike in the 1992 strike, it was the owners who wanted to make sure that they got the right deal and this was under a new commissioner Gary Bettman. There were a few issues that the owners wanted to work out, most of which revolved around salary caps, free agency and hoping to limit escalating salaries. Bettman's \\"NHL mandate was: aggressive expansion, a new American TV deal, a focus on growth (especially in the southern U.S.), and lasting labor peace ‚Ä¶ under the owners' terms, of course.\\". It was widely assumed that to reach this peace a salary cap would have to be in place. Bettman's insisted the owners' plan was merely a tax plan, but would result the same as a salary cap. Under the leadership of Bob Goodenow, the players decided that they would be open to a small tax, however the bulk of the financial goals could be achieved through revenue sharing. Going into the negotiations both the players and the owners agreed on one big issue, the small market franchises. The league wanted to tie salaries to revenue in order to subsidize the operation of weaker teams while the NHL Players' Association (NHLPA) sought revenue sharing to help the smaller market teams. The lockout attracted the attention of worldwide negotiation experts. An op-ed article in The New York Times by James K. Sebenius and his colleague Prof. Michael A. Wheeler brought to prominence a suggestion from fellow professors Howard Raiffa and David Lax: Revenue should flow into a separate escrow account touched by neither players nor owners until the dispute was resolved. This suggestion was not adopted. After the lockout had dragged on, the talk of salary cap faded and new items entered the debate. Talk of rookie salary cap, changes to the arbitration system, and loosened free agency. However, large market teams such as Toronto, Detroit, the New York Rangers, Dallas, and Philadelphia eventually broke with the league, as they feared that an extended lockout would outweigh the benefits from getting a salary cap and didn't want to be the first league in North America to forfeit an entire season just to help out their small-market colleagues. The 4-on-4 Challenge While some NHL players decided to play in various European leagues, others decided to remain in North America. Around that time, the \\"4-on-4 Challenge\\" (i.e. four players and a goalie on the ice) was initiated. This NHLPA organized tournament was played over the course of three days (10‚Äì12 November 1994) during the owners' lockout of 1994-95; all the games were played in Hamilton, Ontario's Copps Coliseum. In the end, Team Ontario defeated Team USA, Team Western Canada and Team Quebec to win the tournament, which raised more than half a million dollars to support the Ronald McDonald Children's Charities of Canada and minor hockey associations throughout North America. Many NHL superstars, notably Patrick Roy, Luc Robitaille, Brett Hull, Joe Sakic, Doug Gilmour, Rob Blake and Mike Richter, took part in this competition. Also in the meantime, Wayne Gretzky and some friends formed the Ninety Nine All Stars Tour and played some exhibition games in various countries. The end of the lockout The lockout ended on January 11, 1995. As a result, the league shortened the season length from 84 games, the length of the previous two seasons, to 48. Furthermore, the season would last from January 20 to May 3; this was the first time in NHL history that the regular season extended into May. Regular-season games would be limited to intra- conference play (Eastern Conference teams did not play Western Conference teams). During the lockout, the NHL and NHLPA agreed to shorten future seasons to 82 games. San Jose, which was to host the All-Star game that year, was awarded the 1997 game instead. The lockout would eventually contribute in part to two Canadian teams moving to the United States‚Äîthe Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver in the summer of 1995 and became the Colorado Avalanche, and the original Winnipeg Jets moved to Phoenix and became the Phoenix Coyotes in the summer of 1996. The Hartford Whalers became the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The Avalanche and Hurricanes would win the Stanley Cup within the next decade. Eventually there was another lockout in 2004‚Äì05, which resulted in that season being canceled altogether. On September 16, 2012 another lockout started, but it ended on January 6, 2013. The 1994‚Äì95 lockout had created resentment between the players and owners. When the next lockout happened in 2004 the owners attempted to come down hard on the players. In the end a salary cap for rookies was instituted, and all players signing a rookie contract needed to sign two-way contracts which allowed teams to send them down to minor league teams at minor league-level pay rather than the pay rate they received while playing for the parent NHL club. The league had expanded by four teams and began to participate in the Olympics. The league was to extend the CBA twice to ensure labor peace during that time. However salaries continued to rise, eventually hitting an average of $1.8 million and this was key in setting up the issues in the 2004‚Äì05 lockout.

He contended twice unsuccessfully for the NBA World Bantamweight Title, and was a class of 2000 World Boxing Hall of Fame inductee. Lew Burston, Raoul Godbout, George Blake, and Bobby Diamond were his managers. His trainers were Jake Kravitz and Manny Seeman. Early life and amateur career Peder Olai Sanst√∏l was the youngest of five children born to Jonas Jonasen Sanst√∏l (1864‚Äì1942) and Elen Dortea Nilsdatter Lindland (1860‚Äì1946) in Moi, Lunde municipality, in Rogaland county in Norway. He moved to Stavanger with his parents as a child. Sanstol learned to box in the club Kristiana AK, after his family moved to Oslo. Boxing as an amateur, he came in fourth in the flyweight class championship in 1923 and won gold in the bantam class championship in 1925.The Ring magazine, December 1953 issuePete Sanstol (Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia)Norwegian Hall of Fame (Great Norwegians Homepage) Early professional boxing career Pete Sanstol embarked on a professional career in 1926. After winning his professional debut against the British boxing veteran Bert Gallard in Oslo, Sanstol was invited by Max Schmeling's manager to train in Berlin. After Sanstol left Norway in the mid-1920s, he only occasionally returned. On July 13, 1926 Sanstol defeated Harry Stein, than the Flyweight Champion of Germany, in Berlin at Luna Park in a four-round newspaper decision. The source, BOX-SPORT reported that Sanstol won the decision decisively. =Bout with Andre Dedieu in Paris, January 1927= Winning all his bouts in Germany, Sanstol moved on to Paris where he fought at least through February 1927. On January 24, 1927, he met the well known Andre Dedieu at the Central Sporting Club in Paris, winning in a third- round technical knockout. Some observers in Paris compared him to French boxing champion, Georges Carpentier. Discovered in Paris by American manager Lew Burston (1896‚Äì1969), Sanstol was brought to New York around mid-1927, where he graduated from the club preliminaries to become the most sought after bantam in the eastern United States and Canada.Everlast Boxing Record (Everlast Sports Publishing Company, John J. Romano, editor. 1931) Bouts with Joey Scalfano, August, October 1930 On October 22, 1930, Sanstol fought a tough ten-round draw against Joey Scalfano at Madison Square Garden that was \\"nip and tuck for the entire ten rounds\\", and a great crowd pleaser. Sanstol later described it as one of his toughest fights. There were no knockdowns in the bout and the fighting was fast-paced and frenzied. Scalfaro's left eye was completed closed for the last two rounds and his blows often missed their mark.\\"Rosenbloom Slaps Down Bain\\", The Reading Times, Reading, Pennsylvania, pg. 14, 23 October 1930Scalfaro's left eye was closed in Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, pg. 26, 23 October 1930 Sanstol had previously lost to Scalfaro on August 6, 1930 at Madison Square Garden in a ten-round points decision. Scalfaro was known as the only boxer to score a knock down of the Black Cuban champion Kid Chocolate in North America. Taking the Canadian version of the World Bantamweight Championship By late 1930, Sanstol had moved his headquarters from the Norwegian-American community of Bay Ridge, in Brooklyn, NY, to Montreal, Canada where he came under the management of Raoul Godbout (1894‚Äì1975). On May 20, 1931, in his most important bout, Sanstol won the World Bantamweight Title in a ten-round unanimous decision against the great New York Jewish contender Archie Bell in Montreal. The title was recognized by the Montreal Athletic Commission and the Canadian Boxing Federation, so it had some limits in its scope. The fast bout had no knockdowns. For a championship bout, it received very limited coverage in American newspapers. Sanstol weighted 115 1/2, giving up only two pounds to Bell. Bell would later contend for but not take the British version of the World Bantamweight Title and contend twice for the California version of the World Featherweight Title.\\"Pete Sanstol Beats Bell in Ten Rounds\\", The Des Moines Register, Des Moines, Iowa, pg. 18, 21 May 1931 =First defense of the Canadian World Bantamweight Title, June 1931= Sanstol twice successfully defended his bantamweight title. On June 17, 1931, Sanstol defeated Art Giroux, also of Montreal, in the Canadian version of a World Bantamweight Title. Leading in the betting odds by 7 to 5, Sanstol won the fifteen round bout at the Forum in Montreal in a fifteen-round Unanimous Decision. Giroux was the Canadian Bantamweight Champion at the time.\\"Pete Sanstol to Meet Art Giroux\\", \\"Oakland Tribune, Oakland, California, pg. 16, 17 June 1931 After the win, Sanstol was rated second in the world in the bantamweight division, behind only Panama Al Brown, according to the quarterly standings of the National Boxing Association (NBA).\\"Rates Sharkey Most Prominent of Challengers\\", Fitchburg Sentinel, Fitchburg, Massachusetts, pg. 8, 22 August 1931 =Second defense of the Canadian World Bantamweight Title, July 1931= On July 29, 1931, again at the Forum in Montreal, Sanstol defeated Eug√®ne Huat in a ten-round Unanimous Decision in his second defense of the Canadian version of the World Bantamweight Title. Huat was the French Bantamweight Champion at the time. In a fairly close bout, Huat knocked Sanstol off his feet in the eighth round. In the eighth round, Huat scored often with lightning fast jabs that went through Sanstol's defense, though Huat appeared to have lost the first few rounds, with Sanstol not clearly taking the lead til the seventh. In the ninth the boxing seemed close, but in the tenth, perhaps with greater stamina, Sanstol took the offensive and battered Huat with telling blows. Sanstol's performance in the final round may have strongly influenced the judge's decisions. The final decision for Sanstol was not entirely popular with the crowd.\\"Norwegian Scores a Close Victory in Thrilling Bout\\", The Ottawa Journal, Ottawa, Canada, pg. 17, 30 July 1931 Attempt at the NBA World Bantamweight Championship, Al Brown, August 1931 Panama Al Brown On August 25, 1931, Sanstol met Panama Al Brown for the widely recognized NBA and NYSAC World Bantamweight Title before a crowd of 23,000 at the Forum in Montreal. The bout was considered the largest gross take on a bout in the history of boxing in Montreal according to the New York Times, and was easily one of the largest audiences for any of Sanstol's fights. Sanstol lost the bout in a close fifteen round split decision. In the close bout, the Canadian Press gave Brown seven rounds, Stanstol five, with three rounds even. Sanstol fought much of the bout in a crouch, to compensate for a six-inch disadvantage in height and reach. Aiming down on Sanstol, Brown scored frequently with blows to the head, opening a cut over one of Sanstol's eyes, which eventually reduced his vision. Sanstol fought on doggedly despite his. Fighting during the depression, Sanstol took about $3,427 for his loss, not a great amount for a world championship bout, considering Jack Dempsey had received over $150,000 for some of his World Heavyweight Championship wins.\\"Outpoints Steve Sanstol After Rugged Battle\\", The Winnipeg Tribune, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, pg. 15, 26 August 1931 Draw with NBA Flyweight Champion Spider Pladner, July 1932 On July 20, 1932 Sanstol fought a ten- round draw with 1929 NBA World Flyweight Champion Emille \\"Spider\\" Pladner, a French born boxer, at the Forum in Montreal, Canada. An important bout between contenders, the January 1932 ratings, listed Sanstol as the third best bantamweight in the world, with Pladner listed as fourth. Pladner had also held the 1931 Canadian World Bantamweight Title.\\"NBA Reveals Champions and Near Champs\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, Salt Lake City, Utah, pg. 15, 10 January 1932 =Short retirement and bout with Midget Wolgast, August 1933= After losing the bout with Brown, Sanstol took a year off between August 1931 and June 1932, before resuming another campaign for the championship. On August 15, 1933, Sanstol fought an important bout against Midget Wolgast, NYSAC World Flyweight Champion at the time, losing in a ten-round non-title points decision in a bout where the brows of his face and his eyes were battered. According to one source, Wolgast won every round.Wolgast took every round in \\"Wolgast Trims Pete Sanstol\\", The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California, pg. 25, 16 August 1933 Victory over Young Perez, former World Flyweight Champion, September 1934 Flyweight Champion Young Perez On September 1, 1934, Sanstol defeated World Champion Victor \\"Young\\" Perez at Bislet Stadium in Oslo in a ten-round points decision. In October 1931, Perez had taken the NBA World Flyweight Championship in a second-round knockout at the Palais de Sports in Paris, France, making him one of the youngest world boxing champions in history. In 1929, Perez had also taken the French Flyweight Title. A Tunisian Jew, Perez would die tragically in 1945 on a march from Auschwitz, where he had been interned, after being denounced to the Nazis in Paris in 1943. Wins in Sweden and Germany March‚ÄìMay 1935 He retired from boxing in late 1933, fighting only one bout in 1934, and then resumed his boxing in Sweden in 1935. He won a ten-round points decision in Berlin against Hans Schiller, former German Featherweight Champion, on May 10, 1935. In Sweden he met Werner Reithdorf on April 26, 1935, winning in an eighth-round TKO in Gothenburg, and Joey Carr on March 1, 1935, also in Gothenburg, where he won in a first-round knockout. Last NBA World Bantamweight Title bout, Sixto Escobar, August 1935 With both boxers very near 118, Sanstol had his last NBA World Bantamweight Championship match with Sixto Escobar, on August 7, 1935 at the Forum in Montreal. Sanstol lost the bout in a twelve-round unanimous decision, that was not particularly close, though quite satisfying to the crowd. In the seventh, Escobar closed Sanstol's left eye, in effect winning the bout, or reducing his need to show the same level of aggression. Ringside observers gave Escobar eight rounds, with four rounds even.\\"Escobar Trims Sanstol\\", Ottawa Journal, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, pg. 16, 8 August 1935 Win over Panama Al Brown, September 1935 Sanstol had one more career bout of consequence, on September 13, 1935, defeating Al Brown in Oslo in a ten- round non-title decision a month after the Escobar fight, not long before his retirement.Montreal Athletic Commission (Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia) Joining the US Army Air Corp in April 1942, and gaining US Citizenship, 1943 Sanstol joined the US Army Air Corp on April 3, 1942. He served a total of three years and two months. During his service, he fought two army benefit fights on May 1, and July 16, 1942 in Miami, Florida, winning both in a four- round and then ten-round decision. While in the Air Corp, he also refereed a bout on May 8, 1943 in Montreal. He completed his service on June 12, 1945. He became a U.S. citizen, a privilege he had long awaited, in 1943 during his service with the Army.Pete Sanstol (Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia) Fighting style Sanstol was known for his aggression, energy, speed, amazing stamina and uncanny defense. He was also known for his ability to give the crowd a thrilling show. About the only attribute he lacked was the so-called \\"power punch\\", although a quarter of his 98 victories were by way of knockout. Throughout his early career, Sanstol used these skills to build an impressive record. In time, his fighting style gradually evolved from that of a careless youth, to that of a wizened veteran. After his first bout with Panama Al Brown, Sanstol learned to pace himself better and to use every punch sparingly, not wasting a single drop of energy. Part of this evolution may have resulted from a chronically bad foot or ankle he first sustained during one of these title bouts. It would haunt and hobble him for the remainder of his professional career. Long-time Montreal Herald Sports Editor Elmer W. Ferguson (1885‚Äì1972) once described Sanstol's evolved fighting style as follows: Career highlights and honors *Amateur Flyweight class championship of Norway in 1923 *Amateur recipient of Gold in the Norwegian and Scandinavian Bantam class championship in 1925 *Canadian World Bantamweight Champion (1931) *Ranked by long-time Madison Square Garden Matchmaker Tom McArdle with legendary bantams Terry McGovern, Kid Williams, and Pete Herman (1931 Everlast Boxing Record) *Featured solo on the cover of the August 1931 The Ring magazine and in its accompanying article *Described in the article \\"The Golden Bantams\\" (The Ring, December 1953 issue, page 13) as \\"one of the hottest local favorites the big town New York ever had.

In 1957, he completed his autobiography entitled Gjennom Ringen.Gjennom Ringen (Boxrec Boxing Encyclopaedia) He married Bessie Andrews Marshal in Seattle on August 24, 1956. Shortly after the wedding, Sanstol and his wife moved to live in Norway, where he was still remembered for his boxing. He was in demand, often telling stories of his boxing days, and speaking to groups. In 1960, Pete moved back to the West Coast of the United States with his wife, taking a job in Long Beach, California, as a translator for a shipping company. In 1962, Sanstol and his wife moved to nearby San Pedro. By October 15, 1981, Sanstol was living in a Convalescent Home in Torrance, California suffering from a diagnosed form of dementia. He died in 1982 in Whittier, California after a series of strokes.

He was born Ponce d'Escouperie in Caunes-Minervois (Aude), Languedoc, a son of Jacques Escoperier and X Armengaud. As a youngster, he wanted to become a priest and was educated in a monastery. He changed his mind, however, and left Languedoc to become a mercenary in the service of Denmark. De la Gardie was promoted to officer and was in charge of a regiment of mercenaries. In 1565, during the Northern Seven Years' War, he was captured by Swedish troops at Varberg and changed allegiance to Sweden. De la Gardie quickly became a favourite of John III of Sweden and in 1569, after only four years in the Swedish service, he received nobility status. In 1571, he was created a baron and was given Ekholmen Castle. He was suspected to have taken part in the Mornay plot to assassinate John III. The plot was led by Charles de Mornay, who was in contact with Christina of Denmark and the French ambassador in Copenhagen Charles Dancay.Karin Tegenborg Falkdalen (2010). Vasad√∂ttrarna ['The Vasa Daughters']. Falun: Historiska Media. (In Swedish) John III was to be killed during a sword dance performed by Scottish mercenaries at the party which was to be given in October that year before the Scottish mercenaries departure to the Baltic. After the assassination, the king's brother Duke Charles was to be placed upon the throne. The plot did not materialize as de Mornay lost his nerve and never gave the sign to the mercenaries to take action. In September 1574, the plot was revealed and Charles de Mornay was arrested, interrogated and executed. It was never made clear who participated in the plot. However, it is noted that the suspected conspirators Hogenskild Bielke, Gustaf Ban√©r and Pontus De la Gardie often gathered at meetings in the apartment of Princess Elizabeth of Sweden, meetings where Princess Cecilia of Sweden had also frequently been seen, and the two sisters and their brother Charles were somewhat compromised though they were never accused. Pontus De la Gardie was himself never put on trial for his suspected involvement in the affair. After Clas √Ökesson Tott's resignation as the supreme commander of the Swedish forces in Finland and Estonia as a consequence of the Siege of Wesenberg (1574) during the Livonian War, de la Gardie took over Tott's office. De la Gardie's skills, combined with the fact that Sweden's enemy Russia had to transfer troops to defend against Polish attacks further south, led to considerable military success for Sweden during the following years. In the fall of 1580, Karelia was conquered. De la Gardie led his troops over the frozen Gulf of Finland to capture the fortresses of Wesenberg (now Rakvere) and Tolsburg (now Toolse). In September 1581, Narva was taken after a storming that had been preceded by a massive bombardment. 4,000 soldiers and civilians were killed, pointing out the fact that De la Gardie was not only a skillful warrior, but a cruel and hard commander as well. De la Gardie and his Swedish troops went on to capture the fortress of Ivangorod and several other fortresses that autumn. In 1582, the war with Russia ended and Sweden got to keep the conquests made in Karelia and Ingria, but had to withdraw from Livonia. De la Gardie was the most renowned military commander in Sweden during the 16th century and has been credited with much of the country's military success in the 1580s. An example of his ingenuity was the strategy of using zigzag shaped saps during the siege of Narva, a new technique at the time. De la Gardie drowned in the Narva River and is buried in St Mary's Cathedral of Tallinn. His tomb chest is made by well-known artist and architect Arent Passer.The stonemasons Family On 4 February 1580 De la Gardie married Sofia Johansdotter Gyllenhielm (ca.1556-1583), the illegitimate daughter of John III of Sweden and a Finnish lady, Karin Hansdotter.Gadd, Pia: Frillor, fruar och herrar - en ok√§nd kvinnohistoria Falun 2009 During the wedding, a gallery in the church collapsed and one person was killed.

Cmdr. A. D. Denny in command. Homeported at San Diego, California throughout her service La Vallette participated in the intensive training schedule through which the peacetime Navy maintained its readiness. West coast operations were highlighted by annual Pacific Fleet battle practice in Hawaiian or Panamanian waters. In 1924 and 1927, La Vallette transited the Panama Canal for Caribbean maneuvers, participating in a presidential review by Calvin Coolidge 4 June 1927. As early as 1922 La Vallette participated in antiaircraft training, and witnessed the growing importance of naval aviation while serving as plane guard for during the destroyer's final months of service. Also in 1922, La Valette was the first duty station of Ensign (later Vice-Admiral, permanent rank) Hyman G. Rickover, ' Father of the Nuclear Navy'. She decommissioned at San Diego 19 April 1930, and on 10 June 1931 was scrapped in accordance with the London Naval Treaty.

It is native to Europe but is rarely found there, it is known across the globe as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. The species name calcitrapa comes from the word caltrop, a type of weapon covered in sharp spikes. In western Crete, Greece a local variety called gourounaki (Œ≥ŒøœÖœÅŒøœÖŒΩŒ¨Œ∫Œπ - little pig) has its leaves eaten boiled by the locals. A south Italian variety of the species is also traditionally consumed by ethnic Albanians (Arb√´resh√´ people) in the Vulture area (southern Italy). In the Arb√´resh√´ communities in Lucania the young whorls of Centaurea calcitrapa are boiled and fried in mixtures with other weedy non cultivated greens. According to a research by A. Pieroni, V.

Their sound was an array of mixed influences, including progressive rock, AOR and pop reminiscent of both the Beatles and the Beach Boys. Through the end of 1988 and beginning of 1989 Patrick Leonard approached bassist Guy Pratt about forming a band and helping him audition and recruit members, as the two had became friends through working on Madonna's Papa Don't Preach album, and other material previously. Pratt agreed and they chose singer/lyricist/multi-instrumentalist Kevin Gilbert, drummer Brian MacLeod, guitarist Tim Pierce to complete the ensemble. Pratt recalls that for various legal reasons he never signed up as a full member of the band despite being in at the start of the project and co-writing half of the songs on the band's eponymous and only album, which featured guest appearances from several other musicians including Julian Lennon, and which was released on Reprise Records in 1990. The album was engineered and produced by Bill Bottrell. Thematically, it covered a rather broad ground. The lead single and album opener \\"Last Plane Out\\" came from a long standing fascination Pratt had about the idea of the last flight out of a war zone. Two tracks, Turn It On Salvador and Remember My Name, were dedicated to Czech poet and political figure V√°clav Havel and painter Salvador Dal√≠, while \\"Queen of Misery\\" is about Madonna.Rolling Stone, August 1991, \\"True Confessions: The Rolling Stone Interview With Madonna, Part One \\" by Carrie Fisher, in which Madonna says \\"Pat Leonard, this guy that I write music with, wrote a song about me called 'Queen Of Misery.'\\" Leonard was the singer's longtime songwriting and producing partner, and in addition to him most members of Toy Matinee worked on Madonna's I'm Breathless album‚Äî Pratt on bass, Gilbert as an engineer, Bottrell as producer and engineer and Pierce on guitar.Discogs entry for \\"I'm Breathless\\" After the album was released Pratt had to go and tour with Pink Floyd, which was a commitment he had made prior to the project beginning, (and being engaged at the time to Gala Wright, daughter of Richard Wright, Pink Floyd's keyboard player was one he loathe to break) promoting the Division Bell album. MacLeod and Pierce moved on to other session work, and Leonard wasn't interested in a tour that involved replacing all of them.Wayne Perez Interviews Brian MacLeod Gilbert took on that role himself instead, assembling a promotional band for the album which featured Gilbert's then girlfriend, Sheryl Crow, on keyboards, Marc Bonilla on guitar, Spencer Campbell on bass and Toss Panos on drums. There were a number of short tours. A 1991 live recording of Gilbert and this touring band performing songs from the album was released in 2010 as Kevin Gilbert Performs Toy Matinee Live at the RoxyKevin Gilbert Performs Toy Matinee Live The group engaged in heavy radio promotion wherever possible, most notably frequent appearances on the Mark & Brian show on Los Angeles-area station KLOS.

Gilbert went on to do additional work with Bottrell including Sheryl Crow's debut album and solo projects. In 1994, Leonard and former Mr. Mister frontman Richard Page released the album Meanwhile as Third Matinee. Gilbert's untimely death in 1996 ended any possibility of a second Toy Matinee album.

He first appeared in The Uncanny X-Men #148 (August 1981), by writer Chris Claremont and artist Dave Cockrum. A Mutant with the ability to sense other mutants, he was originally a member of the Morlocks. He was also a member of the X-Factor, X-Men, X-Force and The 198. He was chosen twice by Apocalypse as one of the Horsemen of Apocalypse, first as Death and the second time as Pestilence, and Apocalypse also enhanced his superpowers through genetic manipulation. The character was portrayed in film by T√≥mas Lemarquis in X-Men: Apocalypse (2016) and his older version by Stephen Merchant in Logan (2017). Publication history Caliban's first appearance was in The Uncanny X-Men #148 (August 1981), written by Chris Claremont and illustrated by Dave Cockrum. Fictional character biography Caliban, in his original form, with Kitty Pryde. From Uncanny X-Men #169 (May 1983); art by Paul Smith and Bob Wiacek. He is born an albino mutant with a pale complexion and large yellow eyes. At some point in his life, he is banished from his home by his father, who called him Caliban, after a character from the play The Tempest by William Shakespeare. Growing up, a still young Caliban, who speaks in the third person, is discovered by the mutant Callisto and taken under her wing. Learning of his mutant tracking ability, Callisto uses Caliban to locate other disenfranchised mutants and organizes them into the Morlocks, a band of homeless, rejected mutants. The founding Morlocks consist of Caliban, Callisto, Masque, Plague, and Sunder. The Morlocks live in the sewers and abandoned subway tunnels running underneath New York City, and, like Caliban, most of them had grotesque appearances. Caliban senses the presence of nearby mutants and enters a New York City nightclub seeking their friendship. He finds Storm, Dazzler, Kitty Pryde, and the original Spider-Woman in the club, and has a misunderstood confrontation with them. Though the battle ends peacefully, Caliban returns to his home underground.Uncanny X-Men #148 Shortly thereafter, Morlock leader Callisto desires a consort and has the Morlocks abduct Warren Worthington, the Angel and a member of the X-Men, to be her husband. The X-Men arrive in the sewers to rescue their ally, and Kitty is infected with a virus by Plague. Caliban takes her to his quarters to care for her. Kitty pleads with Caliban to allow her to assist her teammates. Caliban agrees, but only if she will return after the fight and stay with him. Though Kitty promised to stay with him forever, she left and returned home.Uncanny X-Men #169-170 Weeks later, Callisto, vengeful after losing a one-on-one battle with X-Men leader Storm, orders the Morlocks to kidnap Kitty to force her to marry Caliban, knowing Storm would return. Caliban, however, realized Kitty did not truly love him and released her from her promise. Kitty then became Caliban's friend.Uncanny X-Men #179 Caliban was later temporarily magically merged with Professor X by Kulan Gath during a confrontation with the sorcerer.Uncanny X-Men #190-191 =X-Factor= During the Morlock massacre, X-Factor rescued Caliban from the Marauders, and Caliban swore vengeance upon the Marauders.X-Factor #11 With nowhere else to stay, he took up residence at X-Factor headquarters with several other surviving Morlocks.X-Factor #12 Soon, he forced Masque to undo damage to the Beast's face, and then returned to the Alley.X-Factor #15 However, shortly thereafter, Rictor went missing and Caliban volunteered to help X-Factor find him, officially joining the group at that point.X-Factor #17 Alongside X-Factor, he next battled the Horsemen of Apocalypse.X-Factor #19 Caliban voiced his wish for increased power, so Iceman began teaching Caliban unarmed combat.X-Factor #21 He next fought the Right's soldiers and was nearly killed by them;X-Factor #22 then he aided X-Factor in rescuing the Right's mutant captives.X-Factor #23 =Horseman of Apocalypse= Not long after that, X-Factor's immortal enemy Apocalypse kidnaps the entire team after changing Angel into Death. Caliban, intrigued by Apocalypse's transformation of the fallen Angel, betrays X-Factor and asks Apocalypse to do the same to him. Agreeing, Apocalypse promises to give Caliban enough power to gain revenge against the Marauders who killed his Morlock family.X-Factor #24 Caliban agrees to become Apocalypse's servant and locator of mutants. Apocalypse renames him Hellhound.X-Factor #25 Caliban senses the telepathic cry of Val-Or.X-Factor Annual #3 Through genetic manipulation, Caliban becomes the second Horseman of Apocalypse known as Death.X-Factor #50 When Apocalypse had re-located to the moon in a confrontation with the original X-Factor and the Inhumans, Caliban returns to the Morlock tunnels. There, he locates Sabretooth, a ferocious mutant and member of the Marauders, who is stalking the sewers to find and kill more Morlocks. In combat, Caliban breaks Sabretooth's back and leaves him for dead, not realizing that he has a healing factor.X-Factor #51 Caliban then attacks and defeats Archangel.X-Factor #53 He later finds and defeats Sabretooth again.New Mutants #90-91 As Death, Caliban performs various tasks for his new master, serving as his warrior servant. During the X-Cutioner's Song, Caliban attacks former X-Factor members (and current X-Men) Jean Grey and Cyclops, under Apocalypse's (actually Mister Sinister posing as Apocalypse) orders.Uncanny X-Men #294 Alongside War and Famine, Caliban kidnaps Cyclops and Jean Grey so Apocalypse can give the pair to the mad telepath Stryfe, who believes the couple to be his parents.X-Factor #84 Famine, War, and Death then battle the X-Men and are defeated by them.X-Force #16 =X-Force= Eventually, the loner Caliban defeats Apocalypse's control at the cost of his mental faculties. At one point, when Sabretooth is a reluctant X-Men member, the mutant detector kidnaps X-Man Jubilee in exchange for the savage mutant, but he flees when Sabretooth mauls his face.Uncanny X-Men Annual #18 Though mentally unwell, he retains enormous physical power and is befriended by the mutant Cable. Oddly, Caliban's color shifts from white and monstrous to a semi-friendly Ogre-like form that is purple in coloration. Cable invites Caliban to join his team X-Force. Caliban has many adventures with the team, such as confronting Mojo and his forces, and when Apocalypse's enemy Mister Sinister infiltrates the X-Mansion, Apocalypse's mental leash causes him to savagely maul Sinister. He also has several confrontations with Sabretooth during this time. =Return to Apocalypse= After some time, Apocalypse returns and takes Caliban away from X-Force. This time, Apocalypse makes him his new Horseman Pestilence (coincidentally, the former Pestilence was Caliban's Morlock ally Plague). This time, Apocalypse augments Caliban's physical power even more and gives him the ability to spread telepathic disease as well. This time, Apocalypse's horsemen include Ahab, Deathbird, and Wolverine. After Apocalypse is merged with Cyclops, Caliban tracks down the merged being, and is freed from his service shortly before Cable destroys Apocalypse's spirit. Released from his servitude to Apocalypse, Caliban once more reverts to his childlike state although he retains the monstrous physique he attained through Apocalypse's machinations. Subsequently, Caliban is captured by an anti-mutant medical research facility called the Watchtower. The Watchtower wishes to use Caliban for their own purposes but he is freed by X-Force. Caliban has devolved into a feral mental state where he only grunts and snarls but he manages to help X-Force against a menace called the Skornn. =Post M-Day= After M-Day, Caliban turned up at the Xavier institute as a member of the 198. He is seen carrying the 198 banner, created by Erg, during the confrontation with O*N*E* over the \\"tracking chips\\" and again during Mr. M's exodus from the institute. He later helps the 198 escape with Domino and Shatterstar to one of Nick Fury's secret bases in the Nevada desert. Caliban was able to sense the stockpile of weapons in the base, but they were activated and locked down by Johnny Dee, a mutant who had puppet-like control over a fraction of the team. The original X-Men team went to collect the 198 but Bishop's pro-registration team stopped them. After a short battle, the two sides teamed up and, thanks to a joint effort by Cyclops and Bishop, were able to free the 198. =Seeking The X-Men= Caliban later aids the Uncanny X-Men team after he is seriously injured by Masque,Uncanny X-Men #487 and crawls his way back to the Xavier Institute. Caliban enters the Morlock Tunnels with Warpath, Storm, and Hepzibah and find what Masque was talking about.Uncanny X-Men #488 =Messiah Complex and Death= Caliban becomes part of a strike-force, who are in search of the first newborn mutant since Decimation, along with Wolverine, Wolfsbane, X-23, Warpath, and Hepzibah (all of whom, except Hepzibah, form the new incarnation of X-Force). During a battle with Lady Deathstrike and the Reavers, Caliban sacrifices himself to save Warpath by jumping into the path of a line of bullets meant for him. His death distracts Warpath making Wolverine the only X-Force member to chase down Cable.New X-Men vol. 2 #45 =Necrosha= During the Necrosha storyline, Caliban is revived through the Technarch transmode virus by Eli Bard and presented to Selene for the purpose of finding other dead mutants and resurrecting them by the same means, so Bard can sacrifice them and their powers to her.X-Force #11 Caliban is later seen next to the grave of long time deceased New Mutants member Cypher and began reviving him.Necrosha X one-shot Through him Selene resurrected many deceased mutants, and as she faced X-Force, she digested their powerful life-force energies that would help extend her life. =Dawn of X= Caliban was one amongst many of the fallen mutants revived by The Five on the homeland of Homo Superior called Krakoa, he was shortly gunned down by assailants whom invaded Krakoa.X-Force vol. 6 #1 Powers and abilities Caliban is a mutant with the ability to psionically sense other mutants out to several miles away and track their movements. He also has the uncontrolled ability to psionically sense, absorb, and turn the psionic energy of fear radiated by humans against them, inducing more intense fear within their minds. He could also utilize fear from others to boost his strength to a level sufficient to easily overpower the original Spider Woman (Jessica Drew). He is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, having been trained by Iceman and later Apocalypse. As Death, he attained superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, endurance, claws and fangs as well as imperviousness to physical injury through Apocalypse's genetic manipulation.X-Factor vol. 1 #52-53 He also has great skill at climbing and possesses superhuman leaping ability. He was also mentally conditioned to attack Apocalypse's former ally Mister Sinister on sight.X-Force #57 (Aug, 1996) His fear siphoning abilities had also been augmented and he can now control them as well as cast his power over a much wider net; not only gaining in strength from siphoning the anxiety of others but could harness strengthen and redistribute it in much stronger quantities by force of will.X-Factor vol. 1 #50 This facet of his bolstered power was dubbed the Shadow of Fear by Caliban himself.X-Factor vol. 1 #51-53 As Pestilence, Apocalypse gave him the ability to generate a mental plague, a virus that attacks from within on the highest planes of the psyche and breaks down the mental functions of the target. Being reverted to his original form by Masque, Caliban still appears to retain some superhuman strength affected by his adrenaline, as he was shown lifting rubble off of Skids that proved difficult for even Warpath to hoist. After being reanimated through the Technarch transmode virus, his ability changed to psionically sense not living mutants but dead mutants. Once resurrected after the rise of the new mutant homeland, he resumed his muscular physical appearance he had when he was a horsemen of Apocalypse and before Masque warped his excess flesh away.X-Force vol. 6 #1 Other versions=Age of Apocalypse= In the Age of Apocalypse reality, Caliban was a henchman of the bounty hunter Domino, using his powers to track down Nate Grey. In this incarnation he is an egotistical coward who is nonetheless well-learned in literature and a skilled swordsman. He is killed by Toad, a member of the Outcasts.X-Man #3 =House of M= In the House of M reality, Caliban is seen as a member of the Genoshan Black Ops version of the Marauders. =Ultimate Marvel= Caliban was introduced to the Ultimate Marvel Universe in Ultimate X-Men #82 as a member of the Ultimate Morlocks. His look is somewhat different, as he is now portrayed with a darker grey color instead of chalk white. He is also a stronger physical combatant and has the ability to change into a hulking monster.Ultimate X-Men #82 =X-Factor Forever= Caliban appeared as a henchman and Horseman of Apocalypse.X-Factor Forever #3 (2010) In other media=Television= * Caliban made a number of cameo appearances in the 1990s X-Men: The Animated Series, including the episode \\"Slave Island\\". He also appeared in the final season episode \\"The Fifth Horseman\\" in which Caliban had been transformed by Fabian Cortez into one of Apocalypse's Hounds (used in a similar role to the Horsemen), until Jubilee made Caliban turn against Cortez and the rest of the Hounds who sought out a mutant to use as a new host body for Apocalypse's reincarnation. In this episode, Caliban was retconned into a member of the Morlocks, though he had never appeared in the episodes featuring the underground mutant community. * Caliban appeared in X-Men: Evolution, voiced by Michael Dobson.

He is recruited by Logan and helps care for Professor X, who is suffering from mental decline. While trying to dump Donald Pierce outside of their shelter, Caliban is held at gunpoint by Pierce and kidnapped by the Reavers. After Logan, Xavier, and Laura escape, Caliban is tortured by Pierce by exposing him to sunlight and severely burning him, forcing him to track the three mutants with his power. Caliban complies but gives them minimal amount of information about where the trio are. When visited by Dr. Zander Rice after the Reavers fail to capture the three, Caliban is manipulated into giving Rice their location by a promise that Logan and Xavier would not be harmed. When Caliban leads them to the Munson farm, he is shocked to see a clone of Logan killing Xavier. Deciding to rebel against his captors and give Logan and Laura a chance to escape, Caliban steals two grenades and sets them off, killing himself and destroying the van he was in. While the Reaver in the van with him was also killed, Pierce survived the explosion. Caliban's charred body is later seen in the Transigen facility, where Rice orders his scientists to extract some of his tissue for future experiments due to his tracking ability and high intellect. =Video games= * Caliban appears in the X-Men: Destiny video game voiced by Bob Glouberman. =Toys= * Caliban received one action figure in the Toy Biz X-Force toy line.

La Vallette distinguished himself during the battle, winning promotion and a medal. He received his commission as lieutenant on December 9, 1814. La Vallette's first command came in June 1817, taking the schooner on a survey of Virginia's coast and harbors. He then served on a number of larger ships, and in 1824 was assigned to . While on duty in the Mediterranean, he was acting captain for several months, and served on the ship until 1828. After leaving Constitution, La Vallette held a series of routine assignments, before being ordered to take the sloop-of-war to Guayaquil, Ecuador, to protect the United States interests during a revolution. He sailed from the United States in May 1833, rounding Cape Horn, and finally reaching Guayaquil in February 1834. After receiving assurances that American lives and property would be protected, he returned home, making the voyage from Valpara√≠so to Hampton Roads in a little more than two months. He formally anglicized his name to Lavallette in 1830. Lavallette was promoted to master commandant on March 3, 1831, and to captain on February 23, 1840. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War (1846‚Äì1848) Lavallette commanded the frigates and the , directing operations against Guaymas in the Gulf of California on 19‚Äì20 November 1847. For a time in 1848, he served as Military Governor of Mazatl√°n, and the crew of the Congress comprised the occupying garrison. In the 1850s he commanded the Africa and Mediterranean Squadrons. On 30 July 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Lavallette a rear admiral on the retired list. Four months later, on 18 November, Rear Admiral Lavallette died at the Philadelphia Naval Yard Hospital. He is buried in Laurel Hill Cemetery.Ships' Data Two destroyers of the United States Navy have been named for him. The Borough of Lavallette, New Jersey was named in his honor and was co-founded by his son Albert T. Lavallette.

The firm opened a New York branch in 1885. Allard's Paris origin reinforced the firm's credibility in composing \\"high style\\" French interiors for the American elite, at times employing authentic boiseries, mirrors and chimneypieces, skillfully extended and adapted for results that were comprehensive, acceptably correct from an academic point of view and socially conservative. Architectural fittings and sculpture were provided from the firm's ateliers, as well as furniture and upholstery, carpets, curtains and hangings. Allard, who employed, retained and collaborated with architects, had an arrangement with the designer Eug√®ne Prignot, with whom he formed a partnership for the New York branch of his business.James T. Maher, The Twilight of Splendor, 1975:57. Prignot also provided designs for the London furniture makers Jackson and Graham; his prize-winning designs for elaborate draperies and curtains were exhibited at World's Fairs and published in engravings.See Simon Jervis, Victorian Furniture, plate 2. Allard's Paris showrooms were in rue de Ch√¢teaudun. According to the 1895 London street directory the company, 'Jules Allard & Sons, Decorators' also had a branch in the heart of London's architectural quarter at No.9 Buckingham Street, Adelphi, just off the Strand. The French salon supplied by Allard at the William K. Vanderbilt House at 660 Fifth Avenue helped launch the taste for French dix-huiti√®me interiors in New York City. This room and what was called a \\"lady's room\\" in the house of William Henry Vanderbilt at 640 Fifth Avenue ensured the American reputation of Jules Allard's firm (founded in 1878), which traded in New York as Allard and Sons from 1885, becoming the pre-eminent source for French architectural interiors until the death of Jules Allard in 1907. The firm was subsequently absorbed by Lucien Alavoine and Company. In the leading northeastern resort of Newport, Rhode Island alone, Allard and Sons worked on the interiors of Richard Morris Hunt's The Breakers. There they cooperated with the decorator Ogden Codman, Jr. who permitted AF to be incorporated into the painted designs of the Music Room ceiling; that room and the state dining room, were entirely constructed in Allard's Paris workshops, disassembled, and shipped across the Atlantic.Wayne Craven, Stanford White: decorator in opulence and dealer in antiquities (2009:29).

He is best known for his vernacular short fiction collections Slapping the Table in Amazement (ÊãçÊ°àÈ©öÂ•á), I and II.Yenna Wu, \\"Ling Meng-ch'u and the 'Two Slappings,\\" in Victor Mair, (ed.), The Columbia History of Chinese Literature (NY: Columbia University Press, 2001). pp. 605- 610.Cihai: Page 369.  Biography  Ling Mengchu was born into the Ling clan of Wucheng in northern Zhejiang province (modern day Wuxing District). His courtesy name was 'Xuanfang' (ÁéÑÊàø) and his pseudonym was 'Chucheng' (ÂàùÊàê). His ancestors were government officials. His grandfather was named Ling Yueyan (ÂáåÁ∫¶Ë®Ä). He was a successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations of Ming Dynasty and in Nanjing served as an adjutant, managing legal affairs and prisons. Ling Mengchu's father was Ling Dizhi (ÂáåËø™Áü•), styled Zhizhe (Á®öÂì≤). He was a successful candidate in the highest imperial examinations in 1556. He first worked in the Labor ministry as a leader, managing projects, water conservation, farmlands and so on. This was an unimportant position, but Ling Dizhi was studious and serious. Soon he was appreciated by the emperor of Ming Dynasty, and became tongpan (ÈÄöÂà§) of Ding Zhou government and Tong Zhou government.Master and Masterpiece (published by Jinan Press, first published in 1997) page 1 At the time of Ling's birth, his family fortunes were declining. He had four brothers, and he was the fourth son in this family. He went to school when he was 12 and became Xiucai at age eighteen. (published by Jinan Press, first published in 1997) By 1605 his mother died and he failed the next level of exams. Afterwards, he wrote Break with Ju Zi (Áªù‰∫§‰∏æÂ≠ê‰π¶). In 1623, he was 44 years old. He met with minister of the Ministry of Rites Zhu Guozhen (Êú±ÂõΩÊ°¢). After that meeting, Ling Mengchu decided to take up writing. In 1634 he worked as a country magistrate in Shanghai. In 1637 he wrote Wu Sao He Bian (Âê¥È™öÂêàÁºñ) with Zhang Xudong. 1643 he was promoted to tongpan of Xuzhou government. In addition family members were actively engaged in the printing business with a local specialty of books in polychrome. The Wucheng area was adjacent to the commercial and cultural areas of Hangzhou and Suzhou where reading materials were in increasing demand. Ling Mengchu was certainly a merchant businessman and also certainly a traditional scholar with civil service ambitions. The business motive of the Ling family was originally discussed by Ling Mengchu‚Äôs contemporary Xie Zhaozhe (Ë∞¢ËÇáÊµô 1567-1624) in his Wu zazu (‰∫îÈõú‰øé - Five Assorted Offerings). Such were the times. Ling repeatedly failed at the examinations and did not take a government post until he was fifty-four. Ling would finally perish in fighting against the Li Zicheng led rebels in 1644. He is frequently associated with Feng Menglong. Works Slaps Second Series, Chapter 10 Ling‚Äôs Two Slaps collections of short stories (Slapping the Table in Amazement and Slapping the Table in Amazement, vol. 2) comprise a detailed composite portrait of his 17th century moral world, offering tales of virtue, vice, and adventure. Sometimes racy, often outrageous, and wildly imaginative, they have remained popular reading for centuries. While focusing on extraordinary events, the narratorial attitude alternates openness toward the unorthodox with reflexive Confucian conservatism, a mix also found in contemporaneous works such as Feng Menglong's Three Words trio of story collections and Zhang Yingyu's The Book of Swindles. Ling was most strongly influenced by Feng Menglong, whose success he acknowledged as having emboldened him to publish commercially. In the prefatory material to his first short story collection he insisted it was infinitely more difficult to paint a likeness of a dog or horse one had actually seen than to render a ghost or goblin one had never observed (a quotation from Han Feizi). = Notes = References  * Ci hai bian ji wei yuan hui (ËæûÊµ∑ÁºñËæëÂßîÂëò‰ºöÔºâ.

A bivouac shelter is any of a variety of improvised camp site, or shelter that is usually of a temporary nature, used especially by soldiers, or persons engaged in backpacking, scouting, or mountain climbing. It may often refer to sleeping in the open with a bivouac sack, but it may also refer to a shelter constructed of natural materials like a structure of branches to form a frame, which is then covered with leaves, ferns, and similar material for waterproofing and duff (leaf litter) for insulation. Modern bivouacs often involve the use of one or two man tents, but may also be without tents or full cover. In modern mountaineering the nature of the bivouac shelter will depend on the level of preparedness; in particular whether existing camping and outdoor gear may be incorporated into the shelter. A bivouac shelter is colloquially known as a bivvy (also spelled bivy or bivvi or bivi). Etymology The word bivouac is French and ultimately derives from an 18th-century Swiss German usage of Beiwacht (bei by, Wacht watch or patrol). It referred to an additional watch that would be maintained by a military or civilian force to increase vigilance at an encampment. Following use by the troops of the British Empire the term became also known as bivvy for short. Construction Bivouac shelter with Aneto Peak () in the background, Pyrenees range Single-sided designs allow easy access and allow the heat of a fire into the shelters, while full roofed designs have much better heat retention. As a general rule the roof should be at least a foot thick and opaque to block sunlight. Artificial bivouacs can be constructed using a variety of available materials from corrugated iron sheeting or plywood, to groundsheets or a purpose-made basha. Although these have the advantage of being speedy to erect and resource efficient they have relatively poor insulation properties. There are many different ways to put up a bivouac shelter. The most common method is to use one bivouac sheet as the roof of the shelter and a second as the groundsheet. The 'roof' flysheet is suspended along in its ridge line by a cord tied between two trees which are a suitable distance apart. The four corners of the flysheet are then either pegged out or tied down to other trees. Care must be taken to leave a gap between the ground and the sheet to ensure that there is enough air flow to stop condensation. A basha is a simple tent, made from one or two sheets of waterproof fabric and some strong cord. Generally a basha is made of reinforced nylon with eyelets and loops or tabs located along all four sides of the sheet and sometimes across the two central lines of symmetry. The basha is an extremely versatile shelter that can be erected in many different ways to suit the particular conditions of the location. (The word also sometimes refers to a special type of bivouac sack (see below). Bivouac sack A bivouac sack (in red) covering a man within a sleeping bag in Benediktenwand, Germany A bivouac sack is a smaller type of bivouac shelter. Generally it is a portable, lightweight, waterproof shelter, and an alternative to larger bivouac shelters. The main benefit of a bivouac sack shelter is speed of setup and ability to use in a tiny space as compared to tent-like shelters. A bivouac sack is therefore a common choice for hikers or climbers who have to camp in tight areas, or in unknown areas. A bivouac sack will usually have a thin waterproof fabric shell that is designed to slip over a sleeping bag, providing an additional 5 to 10 ¬∞C of insulation and forming an effective barrier against wind chill and rain. A drawback of a simple bivouac sack is the humidity that condenses on the inner side, leaving the occupant or the sleeping bag moist. Moisture severely decreases the insulating effect of sleeping bags.Camenzind, M., M. Weder, and E. Den Hartog. Influence of Body Moisture on the thermal insulation of sleeping bags, Symposium on ‚ÄúBlowing Hot and Cold: Protecting Against Climatic Extremes‚Äù. Dresden, NATO RTO-MP-076 2001; KN4-1-KN4-15 This problem has been alleviated somewhat in recent years with the advent of more waterproof/breathable fabrics, such as Gore-Tex, which allow some humidity to pass through the fabric while blocking most external water. A traditional bivouac bag typically cinches all the way down to the user's face, leaving only a small hole to breathe or look through. Some modern fabrics are sufficiently gas-permeable that they can be safely zipped up around the user's head in order to shut out the elements completely. Other bivouac sack have a mesh screen at the face area to allow for outside visibility and airflow, while still protecting from insects.  Boofen  In the German region of Saxon Switzerland in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains climbers refer to overnighting in the open air as Boofen (pronounced \\"bo- fen\\"). The spot selected for overnight stays usually comprises an overhang in the sandstone rock or a cave, the so-called Boofe (\\"bo-fe\\"). This has often been adapted with a sleeping area and fireplace. In the national park itself, Boofen is only permitted at designated sites and only in connection with climbing, although in this case lighting fires is absolutely forbidden. The colloquial Saxon word boofen was derived from pofen (= sleep soundly and for a long time). Examples An example of a bivouac being made in a time of urgency was shown when the climber Hermann Buhl made his ascent of Nanga Parbat in 1953 and was forced to bivouac alone on a rock ledge at 8000 m altitude, in order to survive until the following morning.

Cedar Creek Lake was a joint venture of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife (KDFW), Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC), and the leaders of Lincoln County‚Äîmost importantly ex-Judge-Executive John Sims who envisioned the project. On February 16, 2003, due to excessive amounts of rain, the lake was filled sooner than predicted. This impounded of the Cedar Creek watershed, making Cedar Creek Lake the second largest state- controlled lake in Kentucky (with Lake Malone being the largest). Cedar Creek Lake fish habitat improvement structures During the preparations for Cedar Creek Lake, it was decided to leave all trees and brush to provide a habitat for the future lake's many species of fish. In areas without trees and brush, cement-filled buckets with arrays of wooden sticks protruding out, packaging tarps, anchored downed trees, and other various fish habitat improvement structures were placed to fill in these bald areas. Any developments such as houses and certain sections of old US 150 were removed (except for the old US 150 bridge crossing Cedar Creek). The Hebron Methodist Church, the Vardeman/Holmes/Daws/Stephenson Family Cemetery, and a small section of Kentucky Route 1770 were relocated before the lake's impoundment. Cedar Creek Lake was included as part of the planning for the reconstruction of the section of U.S. Highway 150 (designated the John Sims Highway) between Stanford and Crab Orchard by the KYTC. The construction of the earth-fill dam was at a cost of $4 million USD. Of the $4 million, the KYTC paid $3.5 million and Lincoln County paid $0.5 million. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife paid for the purchase of the of land needed for the lake at the cost of $4.1 million and paid $300,000 for the lake's three boat ramps, parking facilities, and courtesy docks. Total cost of the project was nearly $8.5 million. Future developments around Cedar Creek Lake will include a marina and a public beach (no completion date is known at this time).

During what is called the migratory phase, the ants set up bivouacs at new sites each night. As many as 150,000 to 700,000 worker bodies cover and protect the queen, linking legs and bodies in a mass that measures a meter across. Thousands of larvae are located near the centre with the queen, and workers are responsible for feeding them. Larger workers also serve as porters, carrying larvae to new bivouacs. In the morning, the bivouac dissolves into raiding columns that form a fan-shaped front. These raiding columns can travel up to 20 metres per hour with lead workers laying a chemical trail for other workers to follow. Smaller workers lead the column, while larger, formidable soldiers protect the flanks.

The present church was consecrated by the Bishop of Down, Connor and Dromore, Robert Bent Knox, on 28 October 1856. Its foundation stone was laid on 17 May 1855, which in that year was Ascension Day. The current rector is the Reverend Gary Galway, previous curate of St. Marks Parish in Portadown. The Church of Ireland parish of Drumcree has borders identical to the Roman Catholic parish of Drumcree. In the 1990s the church briefly achieved a level of notoriety for the Orange Order service held annually on the Sunday before 12 July. The Orangemen's parade both to and from the service, and the reaction of the community on Garvaghy Road, was a catalyst for civil unrest between the Protestant paraders and the Catholic residents of the area as had occurred occasionally over the previous several centuries. History of the site Drumcree (Irish language: Droim Cr√≠) is the name of the townland in which the church and the surrounding area are located. Its name means \\"ridge of the boundary\\", most likely referring to the River Bann.http://www.ulsterplacenames.org/landscape_in_irish-language_names.htm The site has been used for Christian worship since the time of the Celts. The parish of Drumcree was formed in 1110 comprising sixty-six townlands lying to the west of the Bann. Historical records list the first vicar as David Macralagen. He died in 1414. The parish remained a Catholic entity until the Reformation in the mid 16th century. It is unclear what happened to the church during the time of the Reformation, but a map of 1609 shows the church in ruins within the churchyard. Following the Ulster Plantation in 1610 a new church was built. This was described as \\"a plain stone building rough cast and whitewashed\\". In 1812 a tower was built and in 1814 a church bell was installed. In 1826 the rector, Charles Alexander, had a new rectory built. Almost thirty years later, in 1854, it was decided to build a new church. The church so built is the one that stands today and is now the oldest church in Portadown. It occupies a position roughly the same as the former church. History of the present church The Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871 and as a result Drumcree lost most of its land, known as the glebe. In 1901 a new burial ground was established on the north side of the church. In the following year the Parochial Hall was built. A pipe organ was installed in the church in 1907 and a memorial to the Great War was built in 1921. A further burial ground known as the Terrace Burial Ground was created on the east side of the church in 1922. In 1989 a war memorial to commemorate those lost in World War II was erected. Then in 1992 major renovation work was carried out to repair the fabric of the building. Drumcree and the Orange Order The Orange Order was founded in and around the Co. Armagh town of Portadown in 1795. The first Orange service and 'church parade' from Drumcree was on 1 July 1795.Garvaghy: A Community Under Siege (1999). p. 117 That parade was instigated by Protestant ministers in the Portadown area. One of them, a Reverend George Maunsell gave a sermon in June 1795. Maunsell called on his congregation: \\" to celebrate the anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne in the true spirit of the institution\\" by attending a sermon to be given by a Rev. Devine of the Established Church at Drumcree on Sunday 1 July. And that 1st first Sunday church parade, like so many since, was celebrated with 'wrecking' and bloodletting in the parish of Drumcree. On page 17 of his History of Ireland (Vol. I), published in 1809, the historian Francis Plowden described the events that followed the Rev Devine's sermon: > This evangelical labourer in the vineyard of the Lord of peace so worked up > the minds of his audience, that upon retiring from service, on the different > roads leading to their respective homes, they gave full scope to the > antipapistical zeal, with which he had inspired them, falling upon every > Catholic they met, beating and bruising them without provocation or > distinction, breaking the doors and windows of their houses, and actually > murdering two unoffending Catholics in a bog. This unprovoked atrocity of > the Protestants revived and redoubled religious rancour. The flame spread > and threatened a contest of extermination...Plowden, F. (1809) History of > Ireland: Vol. 1, p. 17. Plowden tells of a similar assault on Catholics in Lurgan where influential Catholics and Protestants living east of the river Bann convened a meeting and succeeded in maintaining the peace in that area. But in Portadown the Catholic Defenders: \\"remained under arms for three days successively, challenging their opponents to fight it out fairly in the field rather that harass them with murderous nocturnal visits\\". Seven weeks later, on 21 September a party of Defenders was routed by a smaller but better armed coalition of 'wreckers' at the Diamond, 4 miles from Drumcree. The 'wreckers' were under the command of a Captain Giffard from Dublin. William Blacker, a member of the landed gentry and commander of the Seagoe Yeomanry, was later attributed a role in the affray. He is said to have stripped lead from the roof of his house to make ammunition in preparation for the ambush of Catholic Defenders at the Diamond. However, we could find nothing to support this and it may be no more than a piece of Orange legend that helped establish an affinity with the aristocracy in the minds of the Protestant peasantry. It was after the Diamond skirmish that the name 'Orange Boys' was adopted. This was changed to 'the Orange Order' as the ‚Äòwreckers‚Äô became more organised under the leadership of Blacker and James Verner, an attorney and agent for the Armagh estates of absentee landlord, Lord Charlemont. Traditionally the Orangemen parade from the centre of Portadown, returning after the church service. The service and accompanying parades are now often represented by Orangemen as being held to commemorate the men of the 36th (Ulster) Division who died during the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Portadown is a predominantly Protestant town. The small area surrounding the Garvaghy Road is a small Catholic community within Portadown. That community has long been subjected to sectarian discrimination, marginalisation, and abuse.Mulholland, P. (1999) ‚ÄòDrumcree: A Struggle For Recognition‚Äô Irish Journal of Sociology. Vol. 9 The Orange Order insist it is their right as citizens to march down the Garvaghy Road, a route they claim to hold traditional and communal value. The residents of Garvaghy Road insist it is their right not to be subjected to marches perceived by many as sectarian and intimidating. The stand-off between the Orangemen and the RUC Royal Ulster Constabulary, which previously colluded in facilitating the Orange demonstrations of strength, has become symbolic of the intractable sectarian divide that poisons relations between the two communities in Northern Ireland. And a local anthropologist, Peter Mulholland, has argued that Orange parades effectively deny the human rights and dignity of the minority community through annually reviving and fanning the flames of sectarian hatred. The aforementioned Plowden report and many other instances of Orange parade- related violence during the two centuries since 1795 were documented by a small group of Portadown Nationalists in the early 1980s and circulated to journalists in 1996-7 under the title 'Two Hundred Years in the Orange Citadel'. Their research was also included in Nationalist submissions to the British government's 'North' commission of inquiry into sectarian parades.A modified version of the Nationalist pamphlet entitled 'Two Hundred Years in the Citadel' can be viewed online at https://www.scribd.com/doc/26105917/Two- Hundred-Years-in-the-Citadel In 1998 the Northern Ireland Parades Commission banned the Orangeman's parade. Every year since then the parade has been prevented from parading down the Garvaghy Road. In an attempt to defuse the situation the General Synod of the Church of Ireland has requested the Reverend John Pickering, Rector of Drumcree Church, to refrain from holding the Orangemen's service. The Primate of the Church of Ireland, Dr. Robin Eames, stated that \\"It is a form of blasphemy if, following a religious service, those who have attended it engage in behaviour which makes a mockery of such a service.\\" Pickering has, however, refused the request, maintaining that \\"the doors of my church are open to anyone, including Orangemen\\". In 2007, following the Northern Ireland power-sharing agreement, the Orange Order parade passed peacefully. The Order is still blocked from marching down the Garvaghy Road.

A Parallel Sysplex relies on one or more Coupling Facilities (CFs). A coupling facility is a mainframe processor (runs in an own LPAR, with dedicated physical CP, defined thru HMC), with memory and special channels (CF Links), and a specialized operating system called Coupling Facility Control Code (CFCC). It has no I/O devices, other than the CF links. The information in the CF resides entirely in memory as CFCC is not a virtual memory operating system. A CF typically has a large memory ‚Äì of the order of several gigabytes. The CF runs no application software. When originally introduced, the CFCC executed in a separate 9674 mainframe unit that was essentially a processor without I/O facilities other than the CF links. Later IBM enabled the use of an Internal Coupling Facility where the CFCC runs in a logical partition (LPAR) defined in standard processor complex and communicates over internal links within that processor complex hardware. Links to another processor unit are over copper cables. More than one CF is typically configured in a Sysplex cluster for reliability and availability. Recovery support in the z/OS operating system allows structures to be rebuilt in the alternate CF in the event of a failure. Supported by CFs, a Sysplex cluster scales very well up to several hundreds of CPUs (in up to 32 members, each with up to 64 CPUs) running transaction and data base applications. Using the CF links, data can be directly exchanged between the CF memory and the memory of the attached systems, using a direct memory access like mechanism, without interrupting a running program. Systems in a Sysplex cluster store CF information in local memory in an area called a bit vector. This enables them to locally query critical state information of other systems in the Sysplex without the need for issuing requests to the CF. The System z Architecture includes 18 special machine instructions and additional hardware features supporting CF operation. Coupling Facility structures A CF is used for three purposes: *Locking information that is shared among all attached systems *Cache information (such as for a data base) that is shared among all attached systems (or maintaining coherency between local buffer pools in each system). *Data list information that is shared among all attached systems These three purposes are catered for by three types of structure: *Lock *Cache *List (and the variant Serialised List) A structure is a dedicated portion of CF memory. It is said to be connected to by specific CF-exploiting applications on the coupled z/OS systems. A typical Parallel Sysplex contains several structures of each type. Each software exploiter may use several structures of each type. For example, each DB2 Data Sharing Group uses one Lock structure, one List structure and several cache structures (one for each Group Buffer Pool (GBP)). Structure duplexing Structures may be duplexed across different CFs, allowing two copies of the same structure to be kept synchronized. Duplexing is often used as part of an installation's drive to remove single points of failure, with the aim of reducing the incidence and duration of application outages. In the event of the failure of one CF, the other copy of the structure is used to satisfy all requests. Coupling Facility requests A request to a CF structure is of one of two kinds: *Synchronous (sync) requests. When a z/OS system issues a request it waits for the request to complete, actively spinning on one of its own processors. Sync requests are quick but the response time is the same as the coupled system's spinning CPU loss. So Sync requests are relatively expensive in CPU terms ‚Äì from the coupled system's perspective. *Asynchronous (async) requests. When a z/OS system issues a request it doesn't wait for the request to complete. Async requests are slower than sync requests (as they have a lower priority in the CF) but don't lead to the coupled system's processor spinning. Exploiting z/OS applications explicitly issue CF requests as synch or asynch. =Dynamic Request Conversion= In z/OS Release 2, the Dynamic Request Conversion heuristic algorithm was introduced. This uses sampled response times to decide whether to convert Sync requests to Async or not. These decisions are based on such criteria as coupled processor speed. The greater the distance between the coupled z/OS system and the CF the greater the likelihood requests will be converted to Async from Sync. Async requests are never converted to Sync. This heuristic algorithm complements a previously-existing algorithm that automatically (but not heuristically) converted requests, based on conditions such as path busy and on request data size. The difference is the new algorithm samples response times dynamically. CFs are unique to S/390, zSeries and System z mainframes. They are key to Parallel Sysplex technology. Coupling Facility Levels and Exploiting Software Levels The CFCC code is released as Levels, usually denoted by their CFLEVEL. For example, CFLEVEL 15 was announced in April 2007. Each level brings new function and sometimes improved performance. In most cases the new function or performance improvement requires a corequisite release of z/OS and perhaps new function in some subsystem (such as DB2). One such example is Coupling Facility Structure Duplexing. (Sometimes support from the operating system and subsystems is available via PTFs rather than a full release.)

It is probably best known to Western audiences for its inclusion in a Palisades Tartan DVD release of the Ring trilogy, which included it as a fourth Nakata feature unrelated to the Ring series. It was released on January 29, 2000. Plot On March 13, 1954, a passenger plane crashes in Japan, killing all but one passenger: a woman who is nine months pregnant. Ultimately she dies in a hospital, but her unborn daughter is saved. However, for a reason inexplicable by the science of the day, the daughter (named Yumi) does not wake up and is essentially in a comatose state. Her wealthy father has her placed in a hospital where she will be cared for indefinitely (and also offers a reward to anyone who can wake her) while he vanishes in search of a cure to her condition. Seven years later (March 25, 1961) Yuichi (a boy who is roughly seven himself) is admitted to the same hospital (with asthma) and discovers Yumi. After being told of her condition and then reading the story of Sleeping Beauty, he resolves to awaken Yumi by kissing her. Saying, \\"Wake up, I'm the prince,\\" he kisses her on the lips. This has no effect, but Yuichi is undeterred, and makes a routine of this, even after he leaves the hospital, repeating the same line and kissing her. Although a nurse finds this \\"cute\\" and lets him continue, when Doctor Hikawa discovers his actions, he ejects Yuichi from the hospital, infuriated that Yuichi believes that he can awaken the girl, whom he himself could not awaken with all the powers of medical science. For the next ten years Yuichi does not visit the hospital at all, until February 14, 1972 when he sees a new report on Yumi who, after 17 years, has still never awoken. Overcome by the memories of his childhood, Yuichi returns to the hospital, and although initially thwarted by a new (apparently American) nurse, he eventually resumes his ten-year-old routine, with similarly little results, although more genuine emotion. Doctor Hikawa - now a Director of the Hospital - gradually becomes aware of his actions. After Yuichi accidentally kisses a girl at school as part of an elaborate setup on the part of his friends, he rushes to the hospital (it would appear he considered it an act of infidelity) despite the rain and late hour, and passionately kisses Yumi. He does not use the \\"Wake up, I'm the prince\\" line, but instead begs her (apparently in his thoughts), stating, \\"I'm no prince, I'm Yuichi Nasagawa, but please wake up, I want to talk to you.\\" Though it would appear to have no effect at first, as Yuichi is leaving he notices some movement, and then he realises that Yumi has indeed awoken. Promptly, the silent Yumi is besieged by a team of doctors and nurses who start to run series of tests, essentially ignoring and shutting out Yuichi. Yuichi, seeing that Yumi has been revived only to become some sort of human guinea pig, abducts her. Although Yumi has the mentality of a baby (even lacking the ability to walk or talk) they have a mutually enjoyable time together, until Yumi is reminded* of the crash-site in which her mother died, and is returned to the hospital by orderlies. Yumi is seen in bed, at night, with her eyes open; Yumi does not sleep at all any more. The next day (the \\"second day\\" that Yumi is awake), Yumi has advanced to the mentality of a young child, able to speak and read, and also an amazing talent for photo-realistic art, as she draws the image of her father. Yuichi returns after school and is immediately recognised by Yumi. They (this time by mutual consent, and accompanied by orderlies) walk outside in the grounds of the hospital. Upon sighting a bus (which Yumi seems to want to ride) Yuichi decides to give the orderlies (who have the air of cartoon comic-relief thugs to them) the slip, and does so successfully. They have an enjoyable \\"date\\" together (although Yumi is still only capable of conversing in simple terms). By the third day Yumi has been discovered by the media and is being paraded all over for the press. Yuichi, Yuichi's nurse (who retired), and Yumi's father all witness the report on TV. Yuichi, once more, decides of his own accord that this is not \\"right\\" (although unlike when she was being tested, Yumi can clearly be seen to be distressed by many of the questions about her own genesis) and abducts Yumi once more. By this time Yumi has acquired the vocal and cognitive abilities approximately the same as other girls her age. Yumi and Yuichi have their first conversation as intellectual equals. Yumi asks several philosophical questions about life and death. She declares that she only has two more days left before she falls asleep again (she gives no explanation as to how she acquired this knowledge, but she simply has it). Overall, she only has five days to be awake. She goes on to inquire about a strange emotion she has when she thinks of someone. After hearing the description, Yuichi explains the emotion is probably love. Yumi declares that, therefore, she is in love with Doctor Hikawa, shattering Yuichi. Yuichi comes to the conclusion that someone told Yumi that she could only be awake for five days while she was asleep, and as such she believes it, but it is not true. He urges Hikawa to marry Yumi, as Yumi apparently loves him, and Yuichi's primary concern is Yumi's happiness. Hikawa does not believe in the five-day limit either, or that Yumi really loves him. Yumi hears their conversation through the door and is herself, heart-broken. She attempts to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but she is stopped by Yuichi. On the fourth day, Yuichi's old nurse returns to the hospital to see Yumi, who is now in a state of depression. After hearing the story from Yuichi, she reveals that Hikawa had been doing something sexual to her at night, and that she left the hospital upon discovering this. Yuichi is infuriated, he confronts Hikawa and punches him, knocking him to the floor. Hikawa does not get up, but simply talks, his head lying down, not facing anything, of how Yumi was abandoned by her parents, and God. She was left only with him, but he was unable to help her. He explains that it was because he was unwilling to admit his impotency that he did what he did. Yuichi returns to Yumi. Yumi explains that she heard someone, for a long time, praying for her to wake up, and then felt something that made her feel very warm. She thought this was Doctor Hikawa, and as such, that she loved him. Yuichi kisses her, and she realises the kiss was what made her warm, and by extension, it was Yuichi who prayed to her, and he whom she loved all along. They continue to kiss, and presumably make love. The same night they announce to Yuichi's mother that they are getting married. On the fifth and final day of the film, Yuichi and Yumi are wed. Although Yumi's father watches and is happy to see that his daughter has found happiness, he does not reveal himself, but simply leaves once more, content. Hikawa arrives after the wedding and speaks alone to Yuichi about the fifth day limit. While he maintains that it is simply autosuggestion, he reminds Yuichi that it is real for Yumi. When Yuichi asks what to do, all Hikawa can suggest is prayer. That night as Yumi and Yuichi depart on their honeymoon on a train, Yumi states, \\"I will be with Yuichi forever,\\" and that she remembers everything about him, even in sleep, going on to list all the things they did together. Yumi's speech is rather bittersweet. Despite the fact she appears genuinely happy at moments, she is also on the verge of tears. Yuichi has a similar mix of anxiety and sorrow. Yumi inquires if Yuichi believes in God. Yuichi replies, that if God is the one who only allows her to be awake for five days, then he does not believe in him. Yumi says she will tell God that the world is \\"very big,\\" paraphrasing something Yuichi told her before. Finally, she states she will thank God for meeting Yuichi as well, and then she drifts off to sleep. Yuichi tries to wake her, eventually even resorting to the sleeping-beauty kiss. Yumi opens her eyes briefly and says, \\"I‚Ä¶ am‚Ä¶ happy,\\" before falling asleep once more, forever. Twenty seven years later (August 7, 1999), an aged Yuichi, now a scientist, returns home from work and talks to his wife. Yumi, herself aged, but not dramatically (her hair has greyed, but presumably her face has not wrinkled since she has not been moving) and still sleeps. As he is showing her a picture of a friend's son, he notices she has stopped breathing ‚Äì Yumi is dead. As Yuichi watches the video of Yumi talking to the press (before he, in his youth, liberates her ‚Äì i.e. the third day) he explains by monologue that after her death he had an autopsy performed on Yumi. When her brain was removed, it was completely transparent, and beautiful. He believes that although she was only awake for five days, she was happier than anyone else. The film ends, replaying the earlier footage of Yumi and Yuichi running from the press. Yumi happily calls, \\"Yuichi!\\" and he retorts, \\"The world is very big, Yumi.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Live-action films based on manga Category:Films based on works by Osamu Tezuka Category:Films directed by Hideo Nakata Category:Japanese films Category:Japanese romantic drama films Category:2000 romantic drama films Category:Romantic fantasy films Category:Romantic period films Category:2000 films Category:Fiction about curses Category:Films scored by Kenji Kawai Category:2000 drama films ","title":"Sleeping Bride"},{"id":"2301550","text":"The University of Coimbra General Library main building The University of Coimbra General Library (Biblioteca Geral da Universidade de Coimbra) is the central library of the University of Coimbra, in Coimbra, Portugal.

Thyra, also known as Thorvi or Thyre,Sawyer, Birgit. The Viking-age Rune-stones: Custom and Commemoration in Early Medieval Scandinavia, p. 158 (Oxford University Press, 2000). was a Danish queen, spouse of King Gorm the Old of Denmark, the first historically recognized King of Denmark, who reigned from to his death .Konger√¶kken at The Danish Monarchy Historical facts and uncertainties She is believed to have led an army against the Germans. Gorm and Thyra were the parents of King Harald Bluetooth. While Gorm the Old had disparaging nicknames, his wife Thyra was referred to as a woman of great prudence. Saxo Grammaticus wrote that Thyra was mainly responsible for building the Danevirke on the southern border, but archeology has proven it to be much older, and Thyra's role was to extend it.National Museum of Denmark (Nationalmuseet). The Danish collection: prehistoric period: Guide for visitors, para. 367 (Thiele 1908, translated by G. Auden). Thyra died before Gorm, who raised a memorial stone to Thyra at Jelling, which refers to her as the \\"Pride of Denmark\\" or the \\"Ornament of Denmark\\" (Old Danish: tanmarka but, Modern Danish: Dannebod). Gorm and Thyra were buried under one of the two great mounds at Jelling, and later moved to the first Christian church there. This was confirmed when a tomb containing their remains was excavated in 1978 under the east end of the present church.Runic stone for Thyra, back side Accounts of Thyra's parentage are late, contradictory and chronologically dubious. Saxo names her father as Ethelred, King of England (usually identified with √Üthelred of Wessex), but his description of her brother as √Üthelstan suggests he intended Edward the Elder, though no such daughter appears in the detailed lists of Edward's children that survive. J√≥msv√≠kinga saga and Snorri's Heimskringla say her father was a king or jarl of Jutland or Holstein called Harald Klak. Tradition also has it that before Thyra consented to marry Gorm, she insisted he build a new house and sleep in it for the first three nights of winter and give her an account of his dreams those nights. The dreams were told at the wedding banquet and as recorded, imitate the dreams Pharaoh had that were interpreted by Joseph in Genesis. In the first dream, three white boars came out of the sea, fed on the grass, and went back to the sea. In the second, three red boars came out of the sea, and did the same. In the third dream, three black boars with great tusks did the same, but when they returned to the sea, there was such a loud rush of the waves returning to the land that the noise could be heard throughout Denmark. Runic stone for Thyra, front side Thyra's interpretation was that the three white boars represented three very cold, snowy winters which would kill \\"all the fruits of the ground.\\" The red boars meant there would next be three mild winters, while the black boars with tusks indicated there would be wars in the land. The fact that they all went back into the sea showed that their effect would not be long-lasting. The loud noise as the waves of the sea rolled back on the Danish shores meant that \\"mighty men would come on the land with great wars, and many of his relations would take part.\\" She said that had he dreamed of the black boars and the rushing waves the first night, she would not have married him, but now, since she would be available to provide advice, there would be little injury from the wars.

Built in the 18th century during the reign of the Portuguese King John V, it is part of the University of Coimbra General Library. It is a National Monument and has a priceless historical value being one of the main tourist attractions among the older monuments belonging to the university. History The Casa da Livraria (House of the Library), the name that it was known, received its first books in 1750, its construction completed between 1717 and 1728.University of Coimbra (2009), p.1 Architecture 310x310px Over the entrance door, the library exhibits the national coat of arms. Inside, there are three great rooms divided by decorated arches, bearing the same style as the portal and entirely executed by Portuguese artists. The walls are covered by two storied shelves, in gilded or painted exotic woods; the painted ceilings, by the Lisbon artists Sim√µes Ribeiro and Vicente Nunes, blend harmoniously with the rest of the decoration. The building has three floors and shelters about 200000 volumes, of which 40000 are located on the first floor. These bibliographic collections can be consulted, by request, with justification and motives for the need to consultation. Upon approval, the referenced work is taken to the Biblioteca Geral by functionary, where the document can be examined. The care taken in this respect is a direct consequence of the rarity and age of the documents in the library; the collection date from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, whose majority represent the best works from Europe at the time. The library contains about 250 thousand volumes, namely works of medicine, geography, history, humanistic studies, science, civil and canon law, philosophy and theology. All the bibliographic works are in the best condition since the building is a perfect vault, with a stable environment, throughout the year, from summer to winter. The building was conceived as a library house constructed with exterior walls around thick. The door of the \\"vault\\" is constructed of teak, that permits the space maintain a constant temperature of . To maintain this stable environment the humidity hovers around 60%, thereby conditioning the wood interior. In addition to issues of humidity and temperature, the stacks are affected by another \\"enemy\\": papir√≥fagos, insects that survive on paper. But, the structure is protected by being constructed of oak woods, that, in addition to its dense nature (which makes it difficult for wood penetration, elicits an odor that is repellent to these insects. Bats The library is noted as being one of two in the world (the Mafra palace library being the other) whose books are protected from insects by the presence of a colony of bats within the library. During the night, the bats consume the insects that appear, eliminating the pest and assisting the maintenance of the stacks. Each night, workers cover the \\"bufets\\" (credenzas) with sheets of leather. In the morning the library is cleaned of bat guano.

Nick Brimble, Rosanna Arquette, Lynn Whitfield, and Willie Nelson co-star. It is the second collaboration between Glover and Pesci outside of the Lethal Weapon series. Christopher Cain directs J. J. Abrams and Jill Mazursky wrote the script. The film was released on May 30, 1997. It was panned by critics and was a box-office bomb, grossing just $19 million against its $53 million budget. Plot Joe Waters (Joe Pesci) and Gus Green (Danny Glover) are bumbling yet happy best friends who live modestly in Newark, New Jersey and have known each other since childhood. They share the hobby of fishing and win a stay in the Florida Everglades to go angling, but promise to return home in time for Thanksgiving. On the way, however, while stopping at a restaurant, they meet an Englishman, Martin (Nick Brimble), who discreetly steals Joe's car keys and leaves. Joe and Gus are forced to push their boat down the road until they are met by two women, Rita (Rosanna Arquette) and Angie (Lynn Whitfield), who are after Martin and offer them a lift. During the ride, a bump causes the boat to disconnect from the car, leaving Joe and Gus stranded yet again, and the boat is accidentally hooked to a train and pulled away along with their beer and supplies. Joe and Gus hitch a ride with two men, but on the way, they see their car at a gas station and investigate. Joe goes to confront Martin inside the bathroom, but backs down when he catches Martin loading a gun. Joe and Gus flee the petrol station in their car, and discover a blood-stained knife in the dashboard. Joe and Gus stay at a trailer park for the night, and while watching a documentary on television, they learn that Martin is actually Dekker Massey, a wanted criminal who has conned several women out of their riches and is implied to have stabbed his last victim to death and hidden her money and jewelry somewhere. The presenters offer a bounty for Dekker's capture, and Joe and Gus decide to turn in the knife after their fishing trip. Meanwhile, Dekker begins hunting Joe and Gus down. Following a recommendation by the trailer park owner, Joe and Gus visit Phil Beasly's boatyard and rent a speedboat, but end up breaking almost every gadget on the boat, losing the knife and wrecking the boatyard by accident. Distraught, they decide to return home early, but end up with a flat tire. While getting the spare tire from the trunk, Joe discovers a map that leads to Dekker's fortune. They book a room in a nearby hotel, and while having dinner, they are found by Rita and Angie, who question them about Dekker and reveal that they are after him because Rita's mother was one of Dekker's victims. Joe and Gus promise to bring Dekker to justice, but that night, Gus sleepwalks and starts a fire in the hotel, destroying their suite and the map. They only barely manage to escape undetected, though their car breaks down on the road and Joe is struck by lightning while they try to fix it. Instead of killing him, the lightning boosts Joe's memory and he is able to lead the way to the cave where Dekker hid his fortune. Despite an altercation with an alligator, they retrieve the treasure and escape, but are accosted by Dekker. At gunpoint, Dekker forces them to push Joe's car into the swamp and ties them up inside a sheriff's office, intending to flee the country with the treasure. After Dekker leaves, however, Joe and Gus are found and freed by their idol, Billy \\"Catch\\" Pool (Willie Nelson), and they set out to stop Dekker. After a long chase across the swamp, Joe and Gus find and capture Dekker moments before his escape via plane and hand him over to the police. Though they claim the reward money, Joe and Gus are forced to spend it mostly on the damages they caused during their trip.

Both turned it down as they were busy with other projects. Once the film was given the greenlight in 1995, Joe Pesci and Danny Glover were eventually cast as the leads. John G. Avildsen was set to direct the filmed and had already filmed it for the first two weeks, but he was fired from Disney and paid his $2 million salary to the studio; Christopher Cain immediately signed on to replace him. The production went over-schedule and over-budget, eventually coming in at a final cost of $53 million. Most of the movie was filmed around The Everglades and the Big Cypress Swamp in Florida. =Filming accident= During production of the film, stuntwoman Janet Wilder was killed when a boat that was made to jump a ramp in one of the scenes landed on top of her. Wilder's husband and father- in-law were also injured.Janet Wilder - Biography Reception=Box office= In its opening weekend, the film opened at #3 at the U.S. box office behind The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Addicted to Love, earning $5.8 million.

Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a \\"BOMB\\" rating, his lowest rating. He called it \\"an annoyingly unfunny gambit\\" and declared that it was a waste of Pesci and Glover's talent, and \\"this film really smells\\". Film critic Chris Hicks of the Salt Lake Tribune said after Gone Fishin and 8 Heads in a Duffel Bag that \\"the Academy should have asked Pesci to return the Oscar he had won for Goodfellas.\\" In Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon, Joe Queenan said that he was \\"so embarrassed about Joe Pesci that he has been known to wait outside cinemas showing a film called Gone Fishin and give those few customers who sat through it their money back, on behalf of the \\"American Celluloid Retribution Society\\".David Dale, \\"The stars and gripes\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 10 Oct 1998, Spectrum, p. 10s The film also received two nominations at the 1997 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards: Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy and Worst Actor for Pesci.

He plays the guitar, bass, and piano which he integrates into his music. The New York Times referred to him as a \\"socially minded R&B; singer\\". Biography Lyfe Jennings was born on June 3, 1978 in Toledo, Ohio to a working-class family and was the middle of five kids. As stated in \\"Ghetto Superman\\" and \\"More Than A Girl\\" from The Phoenix, Lyfe lost his father at a young age. When he was a teenager, Lyfe Jennings started to perform with the group called \\"The Dotsons\\". \\"The Dotsons\\" consisted of himself, his brother, and two cousins. In the beginning of the 90s, however, the band disbanded. During this time, Lyfe began to get into legal trouble and his musical career came to a halt when he was sent to prison at the age of 14. Career=2002-2005= In 2002, after serving 10 years in prison, Lyfe returned to his musical aspirations. Two days after his December 2002 release from prison, he recorded a four-song demo CD.After a month post release, he performed at the Apollo. He was booed as he walked onto the stage, but when the Apollo audience heard his gritty falsetto and lyrical songwriting, they were swayed to the tune of five amateur-night victories in a row. Lyfe sold about 1,000 copies of his four-song demo CD during his Apollo \\"residency.\\" His growing success, influenced Lyfe to move to New York City and pursue a major-label deal. Columbia Records provided him with a contract and released his debut, Lyfe 268-192 in August 2004. A year after its original release, the album was reissued with a new version of \\"Hypothetically\\" added as bonus track featuring American Idol winner, Fantasia. =2005-2013= Lyfe released a more hip-hop-oriented follow-up The Phoenix arrived in August 2006, with Three 6 Mafia and Young Buck making guest appearances. Lyfe Change released in April 2008, featuring a handful of new production associates as well as a verse from T.I. Jennings. Subsequently, Lyfe accepted a new deal with Warner Bros. and began working on another album, tentatively titled Sooner or Later, which he stated would be his last. The album was finally released in August 2010 and featured guest spots from Bryan- Michael Cox, Warryn Campbell, Fabolous, Bobby Valentino, Ludacris, Anthony Hamilton, and Jazmine Sullivan. Lyfe completed another prison stint for his actions stemming from a 2008 domestic dispute. =2013-Present= He returned to music in October 2013 with Lucid, released on the Mass Appeal label. Like all of his previous studio releases, it peaked in the Top 10 of Billboard's R&B; chart. Tree of Lyfe, recorded primarily in his home studio, followed in June 2015. On his new album, Tree of Lyfe, Lyfe Jennings describes it as his most personal work to date and produced the majority of the album at his home studio in Greenwood, Mississippi . When asked about his current musical mindset, Lyfe Jennings response is one of reflection and experience, \\"Everybody feels like they have to reinvent themselves. I don‚Äôt think you can reinvent the truth. It is what it is. I‚Äôm not focused on reinvention. I want to go deeper. This album reaffirms the reasons why people started loving this music in the first place.\\" Personal life The numbers \\"268-192\\" attached to the end of his debut album represent the identification number he was given while incarcerated. Then Lyfe appeared on Showtime at the Apollo. Sons Phoenix (born 2005) and Elijah (born 2006) with Joy Bounds, son Lyfe (born 2011) with a woman named Marquita, son Knoah (born 2016) with India Mendoza, and two other children, who were born in April 2018, several days apart, whose names and the names of their mothers have not been made public. Jennings was previously engaged to Bounds, the mother of his two oldest children. According to the Marietta Daily Journal, in October 2008 after arguing with Joy Bounds, he followed her to her family's house in Smyrna, Georgia. At the residence, he destroyed the door, fired shots in the street, and then led police on a 90 mph chase that ended when he crashed his 2005 Corvette. In September 2010 he was sentenced to three and a half years after he pleaded guilty to multiple charges arising from the incident.

She was named for the Battles of Saratoga. Service history Saratoga was laid down on 7 March 1814, launched on 11 April 1814 and she was christened April 6, the day that Napoleon abdicated. She was a Corvette weighing 734 tons, 143' long with a beam of 36'6\\" and a depth of hold 12'6\\". She had a complement of 212 with an armament of eight long 24-pounders, six 42-pounder carronades and twelve 32-pounder carronades. The Saratoga began her service on Lake Champlain as England was turning her attention and resources from the European continent to North America. British strategy envisaged a series of amphibious raids along the American coast as a diversion to cover a lethal thrust south from Canada down the strategic and already historic Lake Champlain-Hudson River corridor. However, the completion of Saratoga put the United States ahead in the naval construction race on Lake Champlain; and Sir George Pr√©vost, the Governor General of Canada and top British military commander in America, felt that supremacy afloat was a prerequisite to a successful invasion of the United States through the state of New York. He, therefore, delayed the start of his campaign until new naval construction had tipped the balance back in his favor. Meanwhile, Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough, commander of American naval forces on the lake, took advantage of the edge which Saratoga had given him and sailed to the mouth of the Richelieu River. He proceeded to blockade the Richelieu for most of the following summer. Up the river at Ile aux Noix, the little British fleet, protected by shore batteries and by the river's narrow and tricky channel, waited while English shipwrights worked feverishly to complete . The British launched the Confiance on 25 August 1814. She was a 36-gun frigate hastily fitted out for battle and the largest warship ever to sail on Lake Champlain. =Battle of Plattsburgh= Battle of Plattsburg, an engraving by B. Tanner in 1816, after a painting by Hugh Reinagle Master Commandant Macdonough, commanding officer of Saratoga as well as of the other American forces on the lake, had sailed back south. He had proceeded around Cumberland Head, New York; and entered Plattsburgh Bay. There, he deployed his ships across the mouth of the harbor in a strong defensive position where when the British fleet would attack them, they would be at a disadvantage of having to slowly and laboriously approach the line of American broadsides, against the wind and unable to bring most of their guns to bear. As Master Commandant MacDonough awaited the arrival of the enemy, he dropped kedge anchors and arranged spring lines, which afforded his ships maximum maneuverability. He then had the crews practice turning their ships so that alternately starboard and port guns would face south. During the construction race, crack British troops ‚Äî veterans hardened in Wellington's bloody Peninsular Campaign ‚Äî had been rushed from Spain to the St. Lawrence for the impending offensive. Before the end of August, the British Army had begun to march south along the western shore of Lake Champlain. Badly outnumbered, American ground forces withdrew before the English advance, crossed the Saranac River, and took prepared positions on the bluffs which overlook Plattsburgh Bay. On the morning of 11 September, when Commodore George Downie led the British squadron around Cumberland Head, Macdonough was ready. As British brig, Linnet, approached firing range, she opened the action with a salvo toward Saratoga. All but one of the projectiles fell short; and that solid shot was all but spent as it landed on the American corvette, bounced across her deck, and smashed a wooden poultry cage freeing a gamecock. The indignant rooster took to his wings and landed in the rigging. Facing the British warships, the cock defiantly called out challenge to battle. Macdonough, himself, aimed a long 24-pounder at the bow of Confiance, pulled the lanyard firing Saratogas first round, and gave the signal, \\"close action.\\" The shot cut the British flagship's anchor cable, ripped up her deck, and smashed her helm. Then, all the American ships opened fire. Confiances first broadside struck Saratoga from point blank range, and the American flagship reeled from the blow. Half of her men were felled by the shock; but most of the sailors picked themselves up, carried their dead and wounded comrades below, and returned to the fray. Since Confiances green gunners failed to reset the elevation of their barrels, each of her subsequent volleys tended to be higher than its predecessor and, while shredding Saratogas rigging, did little structural damage to the ship. After almost two hours' fighting, Saratogas last serviceable starboard gun, a carronade, broke loose from its carriage and hurtled down the main hatch. Macdonough then dropped a stern anchor; cut his bow cable; and, with the help of tars hauling on lines to kedge anchors, swung the ship around bringing her fresh, port, broadside guns to bear on the enemy. The badly battered British flagship, with Downie and her first lieutenant dead, also attempted to wind ship but was unable to do so. Helpless to do further harm to her adversary, Confiance struck her colors. Then, by pulling on her starboard kedge line, Saratogas sailors turned the corvette's guns toward Linnet and opened fire. The British brig, although severely damaged and unable to move, gallantly kept up the fight for about an hour before surrendering. At that time, Finch and Chub, the other two relatively large warships in the British squadron, were already in American hands; so the surviving English gunboats fled toward Canada. Macdonough's victory in Plattsburgh Bay left the United States unchallenged on Lake Champlain and forced Prevost to retreat to Canada. This weakened the British position in negotiations at Ghent and enabled American commissioners to secure a favorable rather than a humiliating peace. It also helped to restore American morale after the recent burning of Washington, D.C. After the war, Saratoga was laid up until sold at Whitehall, New York, in 1825. Saratoga Passage, a body of water in Puget Sound, was named after the ship.

He was the first man in the world to swim the 100-yard backstroke in under one minute. Kiefer was also an inventor and innovator of new products related to aquatics competition.  Early life and education  Kiefer was born as a son of German immigrants in Chicago, Illinois, and there attended Roosevelt High School (1936). He then attended the University of Texas at Austin (1939), and Columbia College, Columbia University (1940).TexasSports.com, Men's Hall of Honor, Adolph Kiefer. Retrieved October 6, 2012.  Early record breaking  Kiefer became the first man to break the one-minute mark in the 100-yard backstroke while competing as a 16-year-old in the Illinois High School Championships of 1935, swimming 59.8 seconds. His 1936 Illinois state championship backstroke time of 58.5 seconds was the Illinois state high-school record until 1960. On April 6, 1940, Kiefer set another world record, swimming the 100-yard backstroke in 57.9 seconds. He broke twenty-three records after breaking the one-minute backstroke mark. Kiefer set a world record for the 100-meter backstroke of 1:04.8 on January 18, 1936, at Brennan Pools in Detroit, Michigan. Summer Olympics in Berlin Eighteen-year-old Kiefer represented the United States at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany.Sports-Reference.com, Olympic Sports, Athletes, Adolph Kiefer. Retrieved October 6, 2012. On August 14, Kiefer won the gold medal in the men's 100-meter backstroke. He set new Olympic records in the first-round heats (1:06.9), the second-round heats (1:06.8), and the event final (1:05.9). His Olympic Record would stand for over 20 years, finally broken by David Theile in the 1956 Summer Olympics.  Later swimming career  Kiefer returned home a national hero, and began traveling with other U.S. Olympic medalists on a tour of Europe, China, Japan, and South America, during which he challenged other great swimmers in those locations to individual races. In over 2,000 races, Kiefer lost only twice. At the National AAU swimming championship in April 1943, University of Michigan All-American swimmer Harry Holiday, Jr. finally went head-to-head with world- record holder Kiefer. Holiday beat him in the 150-yard backstroke at the AAU meet. The defeat was the first for Kiefer in eight years. In his first two months of varsity competition, Holiday broke two of Kiefer's world records, lowering the 100-yard backstroke mark to 57 seconds and the 200-meter standard to 2:22.9. In August 1943, the NCAA also recognized Holiday as the holder of the new world record in the 150-yard backstroke with a mark of 1:31.5. Shortly thereafter, Kiefer was asked to audition for the role of \\"Tarzan\\", but answered the call of arms instead, joining the U.S. Navy.  In the navy  Kiefer joined the U.S. Navy as a Chief Petty Officer in late 1943 and was initially assigned to the physical fitness and swimming division of the United States Navy's Bureau of Naval Personnel (BUPERS) as a Chief Athletics Specialist. When the Navy realized that it was losing more lives to drowning than to enemy bullets, Kiefer was appointed to a committee to set new guidelines for safety and training. He quickly moved through the ranks, becoming Officer in Charge of Swimming for the entire U.S. Navy, training over 13,000 navy swim instructors to do the \\"Victory backstroke\\", a term Kiefer coined himself. Victory backstroke was a simplified version of the modern backstroke that allowed novice swimmers to breathe easily (on their backs) while leveraging what Adolph considered to be a more buoyant stroke style for novice swimmers. Victory backstroke was performed with both arms underwater, sweeping down simultaneously (instead of using alternating arms), while using a freestyle kick. The American Red Cross would later add Victory Backstroke to their swim training protocols. By the war's end, he had reached the rank of Lieutenant, Senior Grade.  Business career  In 1947, he established Adolph Kiefer & Associates, Inc. in Chicago, which has provided swimmers with training, safety, and competition equipment.Kiefer & Associates, Our Founder ‚Äì Adolph Kiefer .

Kiefer subsequently devoted himself to community service, combining swimming and philanthropy in innovative ways. In the 1960s he worked with Mayor Richard J. Daley to build swimming-pools across the inner city of Chicago, providing the facilities needed for thousands of children to learn to swim.

Tad is portrayed by Michael E. Knight, and Dixie is portrayed by Cady McClain. On Internet message boards, the couple is often referred to as \\"T&D;\\" or \\"TnD\\" (for Tad and Dixie). The pairing became one of the most prominent soap opera couples in American daytime history. Their union was studied and featured within books, held up as an ideal paradigm for other fictional pairings, and praised as one of the greatest love stories ever told. In early 2007, controversy abounded when former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish made the decision to kill off one half of the pair -- Dixie. Viewers protested against the writers and the ABC television network, demanding that they find a way to undo Dixie's death. However, the character's demise was deemed permanent. The incident was elevated as one of the most prominent controversies in American daytime television history. To appease fans and make an effort to amend the situation, ABC Daytime executives and McClain confirmed in March 2008 that Dixie would be returning to the series but in the form of a ghost and for a brief time period. McClain's first airdate was May 2, 2008. In April 2011, it was announced that she would be returning to the serial before its September 23, 2011 network ending. Dixie is seen returning on the May 17, 2011 episode, where she is shown to be alive and held captive in an undisclosed location by David Hayward, later managing to escape. Storyline Soon after her arrival in Pine Valley, Dixie falls under the influence of Adam Chandler, the archenemy of her Uncle Palmer. Although Adam and Brooke English are happily married at the time, Adam realizes that Brooke cannot give him the one thing that he wants most in the world -- a son. Adam has a brief affair with Dixie, and she becomes pregnant. He suggests to Brooke that they adopt Dixie's baby and she agrees, but she has one small problem -- she wonders who the father is. Brooke hires Tad Martin to find out who fathered Dixie's baby, and Tad and Dixie become friends. They talk, laugh, eat chicken fingers and become very close. However, their bond is shattered when Dixie realizes that Tad is only interested in her to find out information for Brooke. She decides to try to make it work with Adam, but deep down she knows that Tad has found his way into her heart. Dixie marries Adam, not knowing that he is only interested in gaining full custody of their child. Tad persists in warning Dixie about Adam's true intentions, but she simply will not listen. \\"I'm his wife, Tad, of course he loves me!\\" is what Dixie often replies whenever Tad suggests that Adam is only after the baby. Despite Dixie's stubbornness and refusal to face the truth, Tad persists in warning his beloved, and his insistence gets him beaten up by Adam's thugs. Dixie nurses her best friend back to health, and the two once again feel the closeness they shared at the beginning of their friendship. On the day Adam Jr. (later known as JR) is born, Tad reveals to Dixie that he wants more than friendship from her. He has fallen in love with the girl from Pigeon Hollow and finally admits his true feelings. Although it is obvious (to the audience) that Dixie loves Tad as well, she decides to stay with Adam and tells Tad that they cannot be friends or see each other anymore. Staying away from each other proves to be very painful and difficult for Tad and Dixie, especially considering that Pine Valley is a small town. Try as she may, Dixie is unable to stay away from Tad and when JR is kidnapped, Dixie immediately calls Tad. While everyone thinks that Skye Chandler is the kidnapper, Tad manages to prove that the baby snatcher was really a woman named Karen. Determined to get sole custody of JR, Adam comes up with a very elaborate and sadistic plot to make Dixie think that she is losing her mind. In time, Adam's plan works and he sends Dixie to a sanitarium. Adam looks forward to raising his son and winning back Brooke, but has not counted on the fact that Tad will stop at nothing to get Dixie out of the mental institution. With characters Cecily and Nico's help, Tad manages to free his beloved from the clutches of Adam and his accomplice, Dr. Snow. While on the run from Adam, Dixie finally admits her true feelings to Tad; she does not love Adam, it is him she loves. Even though they manage to prove that Dixie is sane, she still loses custody of JR, and Adam offers her generous visiting privileges if she agrees to a quick divorce, which she does. Finally freed from Adam, Dixie falls into Tad's arms and he proposes to her wearing a bright yellow chicken suit. Dixie happily accepts, and the two make plans to wed. Their happiness is further cemented when Dixie regains custody of her son, and Palmer gets the best of Adam in a business deal. Tad and Dixie finally marry in late December 1989. The couple divorces, however, just months later in May 1990 after Tad's mother, Opal, and Palmer interfere. They soon grow close again, but their plans to remarry are spoiled after Tad is presumed dead following an explosion. Nearly three years later, in late 1992, it is revealed that Tad had survived the explosion and has been living in California under a different name. He and Dixie reconcile, and in 1994, they remarry. With Tad's help, she finally regains custody of Adam Jr. Their second marriage, lasts about 2 years until JR (then 8 years old) catches Tad having an affair. Dixie divorces Tad, takes JR and moves to Pigeon Hollow, West Virginia. But she returns to Pine Valley in 1998 when Adam Chandler demands to see his son. She and Tad began dating again, and in 1999, they marry a third time. By late 2001, their marriage has collapsed. In January 2002, Dixie leaves Tad and JR, off to the Caribbean, where she gets a divorce from Tad. Dixie regrets this decision, however, and returns to Pine Valley to try and reconcile with Tad. She and Tad make up, but Dixie learns that she is pregnant with a baby girl and flees to Switzerland to give birth to the child in secret. When Dixie is in her third trimester, she writes Tad a letter, telling him that she is pregnant and wants to come back to him. However, on May 10, 2002, while driving back from Geneva to Bern, she is in involved in a horrible car crash and is presumed dead. Tad and JR mourn, but eventually move on with their lives. Dixie is still mentioned, and there is a time where a woman named Di Kirby claims to be the \\"back from the dead\\" Dixie. It is later revealed that she is rather Dixie's half-sister. On December 23, 2005, it is shown (to the audience) that Dixie did indeed survive the automobile accident that was thought to have claimed her life while she was in Europe. Di, the only one who knows that Dixie is alive, goes to visit her, and urges her to return to Pine Valley and let her family know that she is alive. Dixie seems adamant on not taking Di's advice at first, but soon returns to Pine Valley in February 2006. She attends the Mardi Gras ball thrown by Erica Kane. Because her face is hidden by a mask, no one from her family recognizes her. She does, however, witness a tender moment between Tad and Di, as well as JR and Babe. Janet Dillon rigs the hot water heater at the mansion where the ball is being held so that it will explode. When it does, many people die and are injured and Dixie is trapped by some rubble. She manages to escape without being discovered by anyone. She goes to Wildwind, where Di is staying. In the middle of confronting her sister, Tad arrives and Dixie runs off before he can see her. Later, she runs into Zach Slater, and he promises not to reveal the fact that she is still alive. Later, she secretly watches in horror as her son holds a gun to Krystal Carey at a cabin, demanding to know where his ex-wife, Babe, has taken their son. Dixie hides as Tad arrives and tries to wrestle the gun away from JR, but the gun goes off and hits Dixie (who is outside) in the arm. It is soon revealed that Tad and Dixie's baby, Kate, is in fact alive, but was taken by Dr. Greg Madden, a famous surgeon who is hated by virtually everyone in Pine Valley. A few months earlier, Tad had informed Erica that Greg stole her baby, the one she aborted twenty-something years ago, and Erica's son is also alive, going by the name Josh Madden. On April 14, 2006, Tad and Dixie finally come face to face since her presumed death. Tad looks at Dixie with an astonished expression and leaves with her, resulting in him punching Dr. David Hayward, who was and is determined to keep Tad from Dixie. Tad first thinks that David's obsession with Dixie has led him to have plastic surgery performed on someone, but once Dixie says the words \\"Ozzie and Harriet\\", he knows that this woman is his true love. Tad is furious, however, that Dixie let him and JR think that she was dead for four years without a word. He grows even angrier when he learns that she gave away Kate after letting Greg Madden convince her that Tad could not love a daughter, who, Madden claimed, would remind him of Dixie's death too much for him to love the child properly. Tad vents his anger while testifying at Dixie's trial when she stands accused of Greg Madden's murder. Afterwards, though, the two begin to reconcile. Tad invites her for a date one morning, and Dixie accepts. However, in 2007, she dies that day after eating poisoned pancakes that were meant for her daughter-in-law (Babe). Babe's attempted murderer is known as the Satin Slayer, a serial killer killing off the women of Fusion Cosmetics. Dixie's ghost/spirit later sees Tad playing with a little 4-year-old named Kathy and instinctively knows that the little girl is actually their lost daughter -- Kate. At first, no one else in Pine Valley knows this but Dixie. Adam, however, later discovers the child alive and keeps the knowledge to himself. He is conflicted on a number of occasions on whether to tell Tad, but ultimately decides against it when he finds out that Tad has married the woman he loves, Krystal Carey. In May 2008, Dixie's spirit returns to Pine Valley. On a mission to reunite Tad with his daughter, she haunts Adam, telling him that she will only stop if he tells Tad where Kate is. Adam constantly refuses, but finally relents once Tad is shot by a deranged Rob Gardner at Jesse Hubbard and Angie Baxter's wedding, where celebration has just ended. As Tad experiences the life he could have had with Dixie while lying in Pine Valley hospital hanging between life and death, Adam calls out to him. At Tad's bedside, he tries to reach Tad through the unconscious. Dixie hears Adam calling Tad and smiles, still in Tad's embrace. Tad and Dixie say once last goodbye, after one last kiss, and part hands. Tad goes back to the land of the living to be a father to Kate. On May 17, 2011, despite her ghostly appearances, Dixie is revealed to be alive and being held under observation in a locked cell by David. It later turns out she is one of the patients in David's medical experiment called Project Orpheus. Dixie manages to escape, still disoriented and weak from the drugs David has given her. She comes to Pine Valley, where her daughter Kathy and son JR see her, but think that they're hallucinating. Eventually, officer Brot Monroe finds her and takes her to Oak Haven. At Oak Haven, she runs into Erica, who has recently been admitted. Erica helps Dixie get out, along with Annie Lavery, Marian Colby, and Janet Dillon. Marian, Erica, and Dixie make their way to Erica's daughter, Kendall's house. When Kendall brings up David's name, Dixie runs away in fright. She still hasn't gained back her senses yet. Dixie makes her way to the park and finds Tad, who is talking to her through the stars. On August 8, 2011, Tad asks for a sign from Dixie, and she calls out his name. At first, Tad thinks he's imagining it. Then, Dixie calls out again. Tad turns around and sees Dixie, and they finally reunite. As they spend time under the stars that night, Dixie slowly regains her senses and strength again in Tad's presence. Tad takes Dixie home the next morning, where she meets their daughter, Kathy, face-to-face for the first time. Reception and impact=General= Tad and Dixie's romance has been featured, alluded to and studied in several books, and is considered a timeless, classic romance. Reasons for the couple's success were analyzed by soap opera magazine Soap Opera Digest: \\"The thing that made Tad and Dixie so magical was their sparkling humor, and Michael E. Knight's and Cady McClain's ability to express it brilliantly.\\" Entertainment Weekly stated, \\"Soulmates Tad (Michael E. Knight) and Dixie (Cady McClain) set the soap world on fire with their straightforward, often hilarious interactions as they fought ex-husbands, ex- wives, and countless others to be with each other.\\" =Scholarly and further analysis= In 2004, writers Robert Parkin and Linda Stone published the book Kinship and Family: An Anthropological Reader, a representative collection tracing the history of the anthropological study of kinship from the early 1900s to the present day. In their study, one of the topics Parkin and Stone analyzed was how in today's soap opera medium, a family consisting of a husband and wife living with their biological children is now \\"exceedingly rare\\" and it is not something that is expected anymore on daytime dramas to create the \\"ideal\\" family. In their chapter Kinship In The American Soap Opera, Parkin and Stone presented the Tad and Dixie marriage as the prime example. Studied was how JR (biological son of Adam and Dixie) and Jamie (Tad's biological son with ex-wife Brooke English) lived with Tad and Dixie. Tad shared custody with Brooke, which pleased everyone. He was and an ideal stepfather to JR, despite the fact that JR's other father, Adam, is Tad's archenemy. Likewise, Dixie was an ideal stepmother to Jamie. Parkin and Stone reasoned that \\"in this family, there are biological connections with children, but these are not shared between husband and wife. On today's soaps, this is as good as it gets. Tad and Dixie are happy to have created a family and they do not long to create biogenetic children together\\". Steven Pinker, often called the world's leading expert on language and the mind lucidly, is another writer to document Tad and Dixie's romance for one of his examples analyzing the power of words. His book, The Language Instinct, which is said to explain everything a person wanted to know about languages (how it works, how children learn it, how it changes, how the brain computes it, and how it evolved) received the William James Book Award from the American Psychological Association and the Public Interest Award from the Linguistic Society of America. Pinker wrote: \\"Simply by making noises with our mouths, we can reliably cause precise new combinations of ideas to arise in each other's minds. The ability comes so naturally that we are apt to forget what a miracle it is.\\" As a demonstration, Pinker asks the reader to surrender only his or her imagination to his words for a few moments. He says that he can cause the reader to think some \\"very specific thoughts\\". Pinker gives a few immediate examples; he notes how the \\"normally grayish body\\" of a male octopus suddenly becomes striped when selecting a female to mate with, cherries jubilee on a white suit, wine on an altar cloth, and how immediately applying club soda to the white suit or altar cloth works well to remove the stains from the fabrics. In his next mention, Pinker notes a Tad and Dixie scene: \\"When Dixie opens the door to Tad, she is stunned, because she thought he was dead,\\" says Pinker. \\"She slams it in his face and then tries to escape. However, when Tad says, 'I love you,' she lets him in. Tad comforts her, and they become passionate, When Brian interrupts, Dixie tells a stunned Tad that she and Brian were married earlier that day. With much difficulty, Dixie informs Brian that things are nowhere near finished between her and Tad. Then she spills the news that Jamie is Tad's son. 'My what?' says a shocked Tad.\\" Pinker asks the reader to think about the words of his Tad and Dixie example and how they resonate. \\"I did not simply remind you of octopuses; in the unlikely event that you ever see one develop stripes, you now know what will happen next,\\" he said. \\"Perhaps the next time you are in a supermarket you will look for club soda, one out of the tens of thousands of items available, and then not touch it until months later when a particular substance and a particular object accidentally come together. You now share with millions of other people the secrets of protagonists in a world that is the product of some stranger's imagination, the daytime drama All My Children.\\" Dr. Nancy Kalish's Lost Love Project, titled Lost And Found Lovers: Facts And Fantasies of Rekindled Romances, is an experiment which documented people who seek out lost love and how often they achieve \\"happy endings\\". Kalish studied the accounts of 1,001 people who participated in the project. Her focus was not only on real-life couples but on fictional couples as well. She cited that Lost Love is also central to soap operas and film. The romance of Tad and Dixie is one that she took note of. In addition, Tad and Dixie's romance has been referred to by fictional characters within books of fiction. In the book Along Came Mary: A Bad Girl Creek Novel (by writer Jo-Ann Mapson of the original bestseller Bad Girl Creek), character Mary Madigan details the extent of the impact that the Tad and Dixie love story has had on the people in her life: \\"One thing I knew for sure, unless Mama had gotten a job, she was home, because it was time for All My Children. Both MayAnn and Mama had a king-size investment in Tad and Dixie's marriage, the one union on earth they considered unbreakable. It was the source of most of their bickering.\\" Another analysis regarding Tad and Dixie's romance includes the aftermath of Dixie's first \\"death\\". Her sister, Di, pretends to be her during one of the show's storylines. Parts of the couple's romance were parodied in the book Teleparody: Predicting/Preventing the TV Discourse of Tomorrow. In addition, All My Children - Daytime's Greatest Weddings have documented Tad and Dixie as one of the greatest romances ever told. =Controversy= In early 2007, All My Children made the controversial decision to kill off Dixie. Dixie had been killed off before, but this time her death was permanent. The decision is considered \\"one of the biggest upsets\\" in daytime history. Former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish created the tale, tentatively titled the Satin Slayer storyline, which centered around a vicious serial killer murdering the women of a cosmetics company called Fusion. In what was poisoned food (peanut butter and banana pancakes) meant for Dixie's daughter-in-law, Babe Carey Chandler, Dixie ate instead. The poison almost immediately took effect and (after being rushed to the hospital) eventually killed the character within an hour. ABC executive producer Julie Hanan Carruthers later explained in an interview what the writers were going for with the storyline. Carruthers said, \\"When Megan [McTavish, head writer] came up with this whole concept, it was about, 'How do we emotionally impact [upon] all the people we care about?' And obviously high stakes, and life-or-death stakes, really raise the bar of emotion. When you can tap into the personal relationships and the love and the caring and also the hopes and fears of all these people we've invested so much time and support in, you have compelling storytelling.\\" The writers felt that by killing Dixie, it was unexpected and went beyond \\"just being about the women of Fusion\\". Killing Dixie was to send a message that anyone could be the next to die. \\"In order for a story like this to have real impact, it's not just about the reaction of our environment to the people who are lost,\\" Carruthers said. \\"You have to understand that it can affect anybody, you know? It's not just the girls in Fusion who you only see once a week. It's people who are pivotal to the environment, as well. I'm trying to say this in a way that doesn't undercut what the Fusion girls have meant to the canvas, particularly those three characters who've been attacked [ Simone, Erin and Danielle], but a character with as much history as Dixie.... It shows that nothing is sacred and nothing is safe. By jumping off that diving board, not knowing what's at the bottom of the pool, you've now taken the story to a whole new level.\\" Viewers feeling that Dixie was \\"too safe\\" to kill is what \\"ironically\\" led to the writers to issue her demise. \\"In order to keep the audience, who is as savvy as they are -- which we love, by the way -- on the edge of their seat,\\" said Carruthers, \\"they have to be able not to anticipate what the outcome is going to be. And to me, part of what we do is the element of surprise. Surprise that's validated by the play-out of the story, obviously; it's not just surprise for surprise's sake.\\" The audience disagreed with Carruthers. They expressed that the show made a \\"ludicrous decision\\" to keep Babe over Dixie. On February 18, 2007, it was reported that Cady McClain, Dixie's portrayer, had spoken out about what happened via her blog -- to set the record straight and to ease the nerves of fans. Viewers had often voiced that Dixie was killed off because McClain was very out-spoken about matters she disagreed with in regards to the soap opera and executives. In December 2006, McClain learned that Dixie would be one of the Satin Slayer's victims. It was not until several weeks later, however, that the news of McClain's exit leaked to the media. Viewers speculated that her dismissal was due to her outspokenness about the exit of Emmy-winning actress Julia Barr (ex-Brooke English). Seemingly adding credibility to the rumor was a report from Fox News Channel stating that McClain's outspokenness led to ABC executives firing McClain. McClain responded on her blog: \\"Who is this guy from Fox news and what does he know?\\" She stated that her blog entries were always approved by ABC executives before they were posted to the Internet. \\"I was talking about the character of Brooke when I said 'life is not fair,' [..] not Julia getting let go.\\" Giving insight into what actually happened behind the scenes, McClain stated that \\"the show's triumvirate of top executives decided that killing Dixie was the best way to move forward for a character that no one quite knew what to do with [anymore]\\". She said, \\"This [was] a mutual decision of Brian [Frons, president of Daytime for Disney-ABC Television Group], Julie [Hanan Carruthers, AMC's executive producer] and Megan [McTavish, AMC's head writer].\\" McClain noted, \\"I was told they all agreed on this decision.\\" Further frustrating fans, it seemed as though ABC had seemingly removed all references to McClain and Dixie from their official All My Children website earlier that month, which further outraged fans. To this, McClain responded, \\"I really am only the actor. I don't think they will ever bring me back, especially if they have removed the Dixie CHARACTER bio from the website,\\" McClain relayed. \\"It's over. It's all done. AMC is going to become something totally different than it once was. It will be all new, all different. Why? I can only conjecture.\\" Thinking of her fellow actors, she later urged viewers not to give up on the show: \\"Do not stop watching All My Children,\\" McClain stated. \\"There are some good actors on that show, the producers are trying new and innovative things, and the writers are trying out lots of concepts and ideas that you may ultimately find very entertaining.\\" Fans of the Tad and Dixie romance, in particular, respected McClain's words, but still sought ways to get Dixie back on canvas before the episode of Dixie's death even aired. Viewers sent \\"thousands of angry letters\\" threatening to stop watching the show to get ABC executives to take notice of their request. Their request, however, was not granted. In March 2008, it was confirmed by ABC Daytime executives and McClain that Dixie would return to Pine Valley in the form of a ghost to lead Tad to Kate. McClain's first airdate was May 2, 2008. At that time, her last airdate as the character was on June 12, 2008. McClain additionally returned as Dixie's spirit in 2010 when her son, JR, is battling cancer. She greets \\"Uncle Palmer\\" Cortlandt into the great beyond upon the actor's (James Mitchell) passing. On April 29, 2011, it was confirmed [on McClain's Facebook page] that she would again reprise her role of Dixie Cooney Martin one final time. On May 17, 2011, Dixie was revealed to be alive, it was later revealed she was revived by David Hayward's Project Orpheus, and kept in the basements of Oak Haven.

Jews and Christians usually consider the biblical prophets to have received revelations from God. Prophetic passagesinspirations, interpretations, admonitions or predictions \\"b. An instance of divinely inspired speech or writing; a revelation from God or a god; a prophetic text. Also as a mass noun: such writings considered collectively.\\"appear widely distributed throughout Biblical narratives. Some future-looking prophecies in the Bible are conditional, with the conditions either implicitly assumed or explicitly stated. In general, believers in biblical prophecy engage in exegesis and hermeneutics of scriptures which they believe contain descriptions of global politics, natural disasters, the future of the nation of Israel, the coming of a Messiah and of a Messianic Kingdom‚Äîas well as the ultimate destiny of humankind. Overview Prophets in the Hebrew Bible often warn the Israelites to repent of their sins and idolatries, with the threat of punishment or reward. They attribute both blessings and catastrophes to the deity. According to believers in Bible prophecy, later biblical passages - especially those contained in the New Testament - contain accounts of the fulfillment of many of these prophecies. Judaism and Christianity have taken a number of biblical passages as prophecies or foreshadowings of a coming Messiah. Christians believe that Christ Jesus fulfills these messianic prophecies, while followers of Rabbinic Judaism still await the arrival of the Jewish Messiah and other signs of Jewish eschatology. Most Christians believe that the Second Coming of Christ will fulfill many messianic prophecies, though some Christians (Full Preterists) believe that all Messianic prophecies have already been fulfilled. Rabbinic Judaism does not separate the original coming of the Messiah and the advent of a Messianic Age. (For details of differences, see Christianity and Judaism.) A much-discussed issue within Christianity concerns the \\"end times\\", or \\"last days\\", particularly as depicted in the Book of Revelation. Hebrew Bible=Genesis= promises Abraham and his descendants the land of Canaan from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates, and Genesis 17:8 states: F. F. Bruce argues that the fulfilment of this prophecy occurred during David's reign. He writes: Christian apologists point to corporate personality here to connect Abraham with the Jewish nation. H. Wheeler Robinson writes: =Exodus, Deuteronomy, Joshua, and Judges= God is represented as guaranteeing that the Israelites would drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites from their lands, which the Israelites wanted to appropriate (). The same applies to the Girgashites (). In , this is referred to as a covenant, commandments being given. In Judges, the Israelites are described as disobeying the commandment to worship no other gods () and, as a result, not being able to drive out the Jebusites (). The Israelites did not drive all of the Canaanite tribes out in the lifetime of Joshua. The books of Joshua and Judges (Chapters 1) mention towns that could not be defeated. According to 2 Samuel, the Israelites occupied Canaan but the complete seizure took place only when David defeated the Jebusites in Jerusalem and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Israel. ()Siegfried Herrmann, A History of Israel in Old Testament Times, London, 1981, SCM Press Ltd, page 155. =Davidic dynasty= God states that the house, throne and kingdom of David and his offspring (called \\"the one who will build a house for my Name\\" in the verse) will last forever (2 Samuel 7:12‚Äì16; 2 Chronicles 13:5; Psalm 89:20‚Äì37). 1 Kings 9:4‚Äì7 as well as 1 Chronicles 28:5 and 2 Chronicle 7:17 state that Solomon's establishment is conditional on Solomon obeying God's commandments. Solomon built the temple in Jerusalem (2 Chronicles 2:1; 6:7‚Äì10) and did not obey God's commandments (1 Kings 11:1‚Äì14). The destruction of the Kingdom of Judah by Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC brought an end to the rule of the royal house of David. Some scholars including Saul of Cyrene state that God has promised an eternal dynasty to David unconditionally (1 Kings 11:36; 15:4; 2 Kings 8:19). They feel the conditional promise of 1 Kings 9:4‚Äì7 seems to undercut this unconditional covenant. Most interpreters have taken the expression \\"throne of Israel\\" as a reference to the throne of the United Monarchy. They see this as a conditionalization of the unconditional dynastic promise to David's house expressed in 1 Kings 11:36, 15:4 and 2 Kings 8:19. They argue the presence of both unconditional and conditional promises to the house of David would create intense theological dissonance in the Book of Kings. Christians believe that the promise is of surviving descendants that could fulfill the role of king rather than a permanent earthly kingship.Richards, L. O.

You will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and > handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and > he will speak with you face to face. And you will go to Babylon... You will > not die by the sword; you will die peacefully. (Jeremiah 34:2‚Äì5) The Books of Kings and Jeremiah relate that Zedekiah's eyes were put out after he was taken to the King of Babylon and that he remained a prisoner in Babylon until his death (2 Kings 25:6‚Äì7 and Jeremiah 52:10‚Äì11). There is no other historical record of what happened with Zedekiah in Babylon.Siegfried Herrmann, A history of Israel in Old Testament times, London, 1981, SCM Press Ltd, page 284. *God is also represented as promising Josiah that because he humbled himself before God, he would be \\"buried in peace\\" and the book goes on to say he shall not see the disaster to come on Judah (2 Kings 22:19‚Äì20). Josiah fought against the Egyptians although the pharaoh, Necho II, prophesied that God would destroy him if he did (2 Chronicles 35:21‚Äì22)‚Äîpossibly Josiah was \\"opposing the faithful prophetic party\\".F.F. Bruce, Israel and the Nations, Michigan, 1981, page 84. Josiah was killed in battle against the Egyptians (2 Kings 23:29‚Äì30). However, Judah was in a time of peace when Josiah died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. =Isaiah= *When the Jews heard that \\"Aram has allied itself with Ephraim\\" God is said to have told them: > It will not take place, it will not happen... Within sixty-five years > Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people. () According to \\"God delivered the King of the Jews, Ahaz, into the hands of the King of Syria, who carried away a great multitude of them captives to Damascus. And he was also delivered into the hand of the King of Israel, who smote him with a great slaughter\\". In the prophet says clearly that a prerequisite for the fulfillment of the prophecy is that Ahaz stands firm in his faith. This means that he should trust God and not seek military help in the Assyrians which Ahaz nevertheless did.F.F. Bruce, Israel and the Nations, Michigan, 1981, pages 62‚Äì67. The Book of Isaiah also foretold; *Babylon would be overthrown by the Medes () and its palaces taken over by wild animals. () Christian apologists state that the prophecy in Isaiah chapters 13 and 21 could possibly have been directed originally against Assyria whose capital Nineveh was defeated in 612 BC by a combined onslaught of the Medes and Babylonians. According to this explanation the prophecy was later updated and referred to BabylonNew Jerusalem Bible, Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem ‚Äì revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Isaiah 21:1. not recognizing the rising power of Persia. On the other hand, it can be mentioned that the Persian King Cyrus after overthrowing Media in 550 BC did not treat the Medes as a subject nation. > Instead of treating the Medes as a beaten foe and a subject nation, he had > himself installed as king of Media and governed Media and Persia as a dual > monarchy, each part of which enjoyed equal rights.F.F. Bruce, Israel and the > nations, Michigan, 1981, page 96. *Damascus will become a \\"heap of ruins. The cities of Aroer will be deserted and left to flocks\\". () The prophecy may date from 735 BC when Damascus and Israel were allied against Judah.New Jerusalem Bible, Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem ‚Äì revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Isaiah 17:1. Tiglath-Pileser took Damascus in 732 BC, which some apologists point to as a fulfillment of this prophecy, but this campaign never reduced the city to rubble. The depiction of Damascus as a \\"heap of ruins\\" has been understood as figurative language to describe the despoiling of the city, the leading of its people as captives to Kir (an unidentified city), and the way that the city lost much of its wealth and political influence in the years following Tiglath-Pileser's attack. The prophecy is also believed by some to have a future fulfilment relating to end-time developments concerning Israel. The passage is consistent with , which states that Assyria defeated the city and exiled the civilians to Kir. *The river of Ancient Egypt (identified as the Nile in RSV) shall dry up. (19:5). *\\"The land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt.\\" () *\\"There shall be five cities in Ancient Egypt that speak the Canaanite language.\\" () *\\"In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria. The Assyrians will go to Egypt and the Egyptians to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship together. 24 In that day Israel will be the third, along with Egypt and Assyria, a blessing on the earth. 25 The LORD Almighty will bless them, saying, 'Blessed be Egypt my people, Assyria my handiwork, and Israel my inheritance.'\\" () Some theologians argue the statement that the \\"land of Judah\\" will terrify the Egyptians is not a reference to a large army from Judah attacking Egypt but a circumlocution for the place where God lives. They argue it is God and his plans that will cause Egypt to be terrified. They go on to argue the second \\"in that day\\" message from verse 18 announces the beginning of a deeper relationship between God and Egypt which leads to Egypt's conversion and worshiping God (verses 19‚Äì21). They say the last \\"in that day\\" prophecy (verses 23‚Äì25) speaks about Israel, Assyria and Egypt as God's special people, thus, describing eschatological events.Gary V. Smith, Isaiah 1‚Äì39, B&H; Publishing Group, 2007, pages 360‚Äì363John N. Oswalt, The Book of Isaiah, Chapters 1‚Äì39, Wm. B.

The unknown second prophet (See Deutero-Isaiah) predicts the coming of Cyrus, (, Isaiah 45:1) who will liberate the Jews from their Babylonian exile and bring them to the promised land. The second Isaiah, 40‚Äì55, comes from the late exilic period, about 540 BC.

ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials. EBSCO. 22 Feb. 2009 There are many scholars, however, who point out that the prophet himself spoke of Cyrus arguing that Deutero-Isaiah interpreted Cyrus' victorious entry into Babylon in 539 BC as evidence of divine commission to benefit Israel. The main argument against the idols in these chapters is that they cannot declare the future, whereas God does tell future events like the Cyrus predictions.Paul D.

It lasted 60 years (597‚Äì537 BC) from the deportation of the 10,000 elite () including Jehoiachin and Ezekiel though there is a discrepancy with Jeremiah's numbers of exiles (). It lasted 49 years (586‚Äì537 BC) from the exile of the majority of Judah () including Jeremiah who was taken to Egypt and leaving behind a poor remnant (). However, some Christian scholars try to explain the figure in a different way stating that Jeremiah gave a round number.New Jerusalem Bible, Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem ‚Äì revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Jeremiah 25:11. *The \\"kings of the Medes\\" would \\"take vengeance\\" on Babylon. () Christian commentaries have considered the conquering Persian force an alliance between the Persians and the Medes.The Wycliffe Bible Commentary: Old TestamentThe Bible Reader's Companion One suggests the use of the term \\"Medes\\" is due to earlier recognition among the Jews and because the generals of Cyrus were apparently Medes.Jeremiah 51:11 in The Pulpit Commentary: Jeremiah (Vol. II) Babylon as it stood in 2003 *Jeremiah prophesied that Babylon would be destroyed at the end of the seventy years. (25:12) (Babylon fell to the Persians under Cyrus in 539 BC (66, 58 or 47 years after the beginning of the Babylonian exile depending on how you count). According to Daniel 5:31, it was the currently unidentified \\"Darius the Mede\\" who captured Babylon.) *Babylon would never again be inhabited.(50:39) (Saddam Hussein began to reconstruct it in 1985,Monuments to Self  Metropolis Magazine  June 1999 but was abruptly halted by the invasion of Iraq. Iraqi leaders and UN officials now plan to restore Babylon.) *\\"The Levitical priests shall never lack a man in my presence to offer burnt offerings, to burn cereal offerings, and to make sacrifices for ever\\". The destruction of temple by the Romans in 70 brought an end to the Jewish sacrificial system.(33:18) (See Korban) Christians have stated this refers to the millennium in which Christ reigns for a thousand years, since Jeremiah 33:18 goes along with the eternal reign of the line of David in verses 21‚Äì22.J. Barton Payne, Encyclopaedia of Biblical Prophecy, 1996, p. 344 *God will make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals; and will lay waste the towns of Judah so no one can live there.(9:11) *God will have compassion on Israel and cause them to return to the land after scattering them among the nations (12:14, 15; 31:8‚Äì10; 33:7). =DanielEzekiel= *Ezekiel prophesied the permanent destruction of Tyre. (Ezekiel 26:3‚Äì14) Tyre was an island fortress-city with mainland villages along the shore. These mainland settlements were destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar II, but after a 13-year siege from 585‚Äì573 BC, the King of Tyre made peace with Nebuchadnezzar, going into exile and leaving the island city itself intact.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 43/xxii 452 Alexander the Great used debris from the mainland to build a causeway to the island, entered the city, and plundered the city, sacking it without mercy. Most of the residents were either killed in the battle or sold into slavery. It was quickly repopulated by colonists and escaped citizens,Wallace B. Fleming. The History of Tyre. New York: Columbia University Press; 1915. p. 64. \\"The city did not lie in ruins long. Colonists were imported and citizens who had escaped returned. The energy of these with the advantage of the site, in a few years raised the city to wealth and leadership again.\\" and later regained its independence.126 B.C. ‚Äì events and references \\"Tyre gains independence from the Seleucids; beginning of the Tyrian era.\\" Retrieved October 12, 2011. Tyre did eventually enter a period of decline, being reduced to a small remnant. Echoing Ezekiel's words, historian Philip Myers writes in 1889: > The city never recovered from this blow. The site of the once brilliant > maritime capital is now \\"bare as the top of a rock,\\" a place where the few > fishermen that still frequent the spot spread their nets to dry. Older sources often refer to the locations as a \\"fishing village\\". However, the nearby area grew rapidly in the 20th century. The ruins of a part of ancient Tyre (a protected site) can still be seen on the southern half of the island whereas modern Tyre occupies the northern half and also sprawls across Alexander's causeway and onto the mainland.Katzenstein, H.J., The History of Tyre, 1973, p.9 It is now the fourth largest city in Lebanon with a population of 14,000 peopleLebanon ‚Äì City Population. * Ezekiel then prophesies the conquest of Egypt, the scattering of its entire population (it was to be uninhabited for 40 years), and Nebuchadnezzar plundering Egypt (Ezekiel 29:3 ‚Äì Ezekiel 30:26). This includes the claim that God will make Egypt so weak that it will never again rule over other nations.Ezekiel 29:15 Pharaoh Amasis II (who drove off Nebuchadnezzar) also conquered Cyprus, ruling it until 545 BC. Despite being a powerful nation in ancient times, Egypt has since been ruled by the Persians, Greeks, Romans, Byzantine Empire, Ottomans, British and the French, and has also enjoyed periods of independence from external rule. During the Hellenistic period, the break-up of the empire of Alexander the Great left the Ptolemaic Dynasty (of Macedonian/Greek origin) as rulers of Egypt: the Ptolemies then conquered and ruled Cyrenaica (now northeastern Libya), Palestine, and Cyprus at various times. (see also History of Ptolemaic Egypt and Ptolemaic kingdom). There is some uncertainty among modern scholars regarding when (and by whom) various portions of the Book of Ezekiel were written,Gustav Hoelscher, \\"Hesekiel: Der Dicter und das Buch,\\"BZAW 39 (1924). making the timing of prophecies difficult to unravel (see Book of Ezekiel). Nebuchadnezzar invaded Egypt around 568 BC. However, the armies of Pharaoh Amasis II defeated the Babylonians (though the author did not elaborate and there are no known detailed accounts of this invasion).Alan B.

Bruce, J. Barton Payne, etc. hold this opinion ‚Äì > What is the meaning of Matthew 10:23? The Wycliffe Bible Commentary disagrees with this view: > In the similar context of Mt 24:8‚Äì31 the great tribulation and the second > advent are in view.

Preterists respond that Jesus did not mean His second coming but a demonstration of His might when He says \\"coming in his kingdom\\". In this view, this was accomplished by the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD when some of the Apostles were still living and thus fulfilling the word of Jesus that only some will not have died.Dr. Knox Chamblin, Professor of New Testament Emeritus, Columbia Theological Seminary: Commentary on Matthew 16:21‚Äì28 ‚Äì see last 4 paragraphs Others argue it refers to the Transfiguration.Blomberg, C.

The word \\"you will see\\" is in Greek \\"·ΩÑœàŒµœÉŒ∏Œµ\\" [opheste, from the infinitive optomai]Online Interlinear New Testament in Greek ‚Äì Matthew 26 which is plural. Jesus meant that the Jews, and not just the high priest, will see his coming. *Jesus declared in Gospel accounts of Matthew, Luke and John that Peter would deny him three times before cock-crow. Mark states that the cock crowed after the first denial as well as after the third denial. (First crow is not found in the NIV version) Christians argue that the first cock-crow is simply missing from Matthew, Luke, and John. In Matthew (), Luke (), and John (), Jesus foretells three denials of Peter before cock-crow. , , report the fulfillment of this prophecy. In , Jesus speaks of two cock-crows, which is mentioned in as having taken place. Christians argue that Matthew, Luke, and John removed the first cock-crow and diminished (Luke even eliminated) the partial exit by Peter after the first denial (which Mark reports).New Jerusalem Bible, Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem ‚Äì revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Mark 14:68 If Mark was the \\"interpreter of Peter\\",Papias, quoted in Eusebius, History of the Church, trans.

Others claim that the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70Jos Wars vii. 1. fulfilled this despite the existence of the wailing wall.Pfeiffer, C. F., & Harrison, E. F. (1962).

The parts of the wall Jesus refers to in the verse may not have included the wailing wall. Recent archaeological evidence suggest that the wailing wall part of the temple complex was not completed until an uncertain date in or after 16 A.D. *Matthew 24:7‚Äì8 is part of Jesus response to the disciples in verse 5 asking, \\"when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?\\" It states: > Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be > famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of > birth pains. The famines part of this verse has often been associated with the third seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:5‚Äì6), and the pestilences and earthquakes aspect has often been associated with the fourth seal of Revelation (Rev. 6:7‚Äì8). The presence of the term birthpains could be representative of better times ahead.Pfeiffer, C. F., & Harrison, E. F. (1962). The Wycliffe Bible commentary: New Testament (Mt 24:7‚Äì8). Chicago: Moody Press. Scholars point out that these events have always been on earth, so the verse must refer to a significant increase in the intensity of them.Wiersbe, W. W. (1997, c1992). Wiersbe's Expository Outlines on the New Testament (88). Wheaton, Ill.: Victor Books. There are also instances of erroneous, or untraceable, quotations from the prophets cited by the early Christians: *Matthew 27:9 paraphrases Zechariah 11:12 and 13 in relation to buying a field for 30 pieces of silver, but attributes it as a saying of Jeremiah. Jeremiah is described as buying a field (Jeremiah 32:6‚Äì9) but for seventeen shekels of silver rather than 30. Christian writers have given several responses. First is that the use of Jeremiah is meant to refer to all the books of prophecy. Second is that although Jeremiah said this, any record has not survived. Third is this was the result of a scribal error because of the single letter difference in the abridged versions of the names. *Matthew 2:23 refers to a prophecy being fulfilled by Jesus living in Nazareth which is not found in the Old Testament. Christians have given several responses. First is that this prophecy has not survived to the present day. Second is the Greek word nazaret does not mean Nazarene but is related to the Hebrew word netzer which can be translated as 'branch'. Third is that the verse is not a prophetic saying but simply reflects an Old Testament requirement for the Messiah to be held in contempt, (Psalm 22:6‚Äì8; 69:9‚Äì11, 19‚Äì21; Isaiah 53:2‚Äì4, 7‚Äì9) which they argue Nazarenes were (John 1:46; John 7:52). * quotes from both and but attributes to Isaiah only. Some scholars respond that this is because the Malachi reference was just an introduction,Steve Moyise, M.J.J.Menken, Isaiah in the New Testament, Continuum International Publishing Group, 2005, page 37 which made it significantly less important than Isaiah 40:3, leading to the whole being attributed to the prophet Isaiah. Other reasons given are Isaiah's authority was considered higher than Malachi and the Isaiah text was better known.James R. Edwards, The Gospel according to Mark, Wm.B.Eerdmans Publishing, 2002, page 27R.T.France, The Gospel of Mark: A Commentary on the Greek Text, Wm.B.Eerdmans Publishing, 2002, page 63 =Letters of Paul= *Paul the apostle prophesied about the Second Coming: > ...we tell you that we who are still alive, who are left till the coming of > the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the > Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice > of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ > will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be > caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And > so we will be with the Lord forever. (1 Thessalonians 4:15‚Äì17) Christians argue that Paul speaks about his own presence at the last day only hypothetically.New Jerusalem Bible, Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem ‚Äì revised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to 1 Thessalonians 4:15: \\"Paul includes himself among those who will be present at the parousia: more by aspiration, however, than by conviction.\\" They point out Paul later states the Day of the Lord comes like a thief () which is a word Jesus uses himself () expressing the impossibility of predicting His second coming ().Witherington, III, The Paul Quest, InterVarsity Press, 2001, pages 141‚Äì142 *Paul prophesied in 1 Thessalonians 5:2‚Äì11: \\"For you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. While people are saying, Peace and safety, destruction will come on them suddenly, as labor pains on a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.\\" *In , Paul prophesied that the Man of sin would sit in the temple of God declaring himself as God. The Temple in Jerusalem was destroyed in 70 AD. There are different attempts to explain the term \\"to take his seat in the temple of God\\". Some understand it as a divine attribute which the man of lawlessness arrogates to himself and hence no conclusion can be drawn for time and place.Herman N. Ridderbos, Paul: An Outline of his Theology, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1997, pages 520‚Äì521 Many in the early Church, such as Irenaeus, Hippolytus of Rome, Origen and Cyril of Jerusalem, believed a literal Temple would be rebuilt by the Antichrist before the Lord's Second Coming whereas Jerome and John Chrysostom referred the Temple to the Church.T. L. Frazier, A Second Look at the Second Coming, Conciliar Press Ministries, Inc., 2005, pages 141‚Äì142 Also some today's scholars refer the phrase \\"God's temple\\" to the Church pointing out that Paul used this term five other times outside 2 Thessalonians and does not refer it to a literal temple.Gregory K. Beale, 1‚Äì2 Thessalonians, InterVarsity Press, 2003, pages 207‚Äì211 *1 Timothy 4:1‚Äì3 says \\"in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron; Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth\\". The Church fathers such as John Chrysostom who lived at the time of Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Encratites, the Manicheans‚Äîwho rejected Christian marriage and the eating of because they believed that all flesh was from an evil principle‚Äîasserted this text referred to such sects and that they were therefore \\"in the latter times\\". The Protestant theologian John GillExposition of the Entire Bible believed that this refers to the Canon Law of the Catholic Church, particularly priestly celibacy and Lent as promulgated by the medieval church. (see Great Apostasy) *Paul wrote in Romans 13:11,12: \\"...our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here.\\" Some Christian scholars believe the verses 11‚Äì14 refer to the era of salvation beginning with Christ's resurrectionJ. R. Daniel Kirk, Unlocking Romans, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2008, page 198 and its coming fulfillment on the last day.New Jerusalem Bible, Standard Edition published 1985, introductions and notes are a translation of those which appear in La Bible de Jerusalem‚Äîrevised edition 1973, Bombay 2002; footnote to Romans 13:11. Thus, they think that the claim Paul makes here about salvation is a claim every Christian and not only Paul in his time can affirm.David Lyon Bartlett, Romans, Westminster John Knox Press, 1995, page 120 Some see this verse as indicating that there are no prophesied or salvation events before the Lord comes. Those holding the belief that Paul has a longer time span in view point to its context after Romans 11, which describes the repentance of all of Israel in future. They also point to Paul's plan to visit Rome and more western places in Romans 15 as indicating that he did not believe Christ's return would be soon enough to simply wait for it.Ben Witherington, III, The Paul Quest, InterVarsity Press, 2001, page 140 =Other New Testament books= * The Epistle of Jude quotes a prophecy from the pseudepigraphical Book of Enoch. () Christians have argued that a canonical book quoting from a noncanonical source does not elevate the source to the same level; doing so simply addresses a point made by the other author. They point out the Old Testament quotes books never used in the canon, such as and quoting from the Book of Jashar, and in the New Testament, Paul quotes pagan writers Aratus (), Menander (), and Epimenides (). It is also suggested that the author of Jude might have been aware that the text of 1 Enoch 1:9 which he was quoting is in fact a form of midrash of Deuteronomy 33:2,cf. comparison of texts in Charles, R.H. Book of Enoch with the Greek Fragments, London 1904 so the prophecy is originally that of Moses, not \\"Enoch the Seventh from Adam\\" (itself a section heading from 1En.60:8)Nickelsburg, George W.E., 1 Enoch, Hermeneia =Revelation= *In this first-century text, Jesus is spoken of as telling the Seven churches of Asia Minor (, ) that he will come \\"soon\\". (, ) (see also Seven seals, Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, two witnesses, Woman of the Apocalypse, The Beast, Whore of Babylon, Millennialism) The word \\"soon\\" (other translations use \\"shortly\\" or \\"quickly\\") does not have to be understood in the sense of close future. The Norwegian scholar Thorleif Boman explained that the Israelites, unlike Europeans or people in the West, did not understand time as something measurable or calculable according to Hebrew thinking but as something qualitative: > We have examined the ideas underlying the expression of calculable time and > more than once have found that the Israelites understood time as something > qualitative, because for them time is determined by its content. Thorleif > Boman, Hebrew Thought compared with Greek, W.W.Norton & Company, New York ‚Äì > London, 1970, page 137 > ...the Semitic concept of time is closely coincident with that of its > content without which time would be quite impossible.

Jewish sources insist that the Messiah will fulfill the prophecies outright. Some Christians maintain that some of these prophecies are associated with a putative second coming while Jewish scholars state there is no concept of a second coming in the Hebrew Bible. * The Sanhedrin will be re-established. (Isaiah 1:26) * Once he is King, leaders of other nations will look to him for guidance. (Isaiah 2:4) * The whole world will worship the One God of Israel. (Isaiah 2:17) * Jews will return to full Torah observance and practice it. * He will be descended from King David. (Isaiah 11:1) via Solomon (1 Chron. 22:8‚Äì10) * The Messiah will be a man of this world, an observant Jew with \\"fear of God\\".

(Isaiah 11:9) * He will include and attract people from all cultures and nations. (Isaiah 11:10) * All Israelites will be returned to the Land of Israel. (Isaiah 11:12) * Death will be swallowed up forever. There will be no more hunger or illness, and death will cease. (Isaiah 25:8) * All of the dead will rise again. According to the Zohar this will happen forty years after the arrival of the Messiah. (Isaiah 26:19) * The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness. (Isaiah 51:11) * He will be a messenger of peace. (Isaiah 52:7) * Nations will end up recognizing the wrongs they did to Israel. (Isaiah 52:13 ‚Äì 53:5) * The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance. (Zechariah 8:23) * The ruined cities of Israel will be restored.

(Isaiah 11:12, 27:12,13) * He will bring world peace. (Isaiah 2:4, Isaiah 11:6, Micah 4:3) * He will influence the entire world to acknowledge and serve one God. (Isaiah 11:9, Isaiah 40:5, Zephaniah 3:9) * He will then perfect the entire world to serve God together. (Zephaniah 3:9) * He will give you all the worthy desires of your heart. (Psalms 37:4) * He will take the barren land and make it abundant and fruitful. (Isaiah 51:3, Amos 9:13‚Äì15, Ezekiel 36:29,30, Isaiah 11:6‚Äì9) =Jesus= While Christian biblical scholars have cited the following as prophecies referencing the life, status, and legacy of Jesus, Jewish scholars maintain that these passages are not messianic prophecies and are based on mistranslations/misunderstanding of the Hebrew texts. *Deuteronomy 18:18 *Isaiah 7:14 ‚Äì Matthew 1:22,23 states \\"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel\\" ‚Äî which means, \\"God with us\\". However the Jewish translation of that passage reads \\"Behold, the young woman is with child and will bear a son and she will call his name Immanuel.\\" Isaiah chapter 7 speaks of a prophecy made to the Jewish King Ahaz to allay his fears of two invading kings (those of Damascus and of Samaria) who were preparing to invade Jerusalem, about 600 years before Jesus‚Äô birth. Isaiah 7:16: \\"For before the boy will know enough to refuse evil and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread will be forsaken.\\" *Isaiah 53 ‚Äì According to many Christians, the suffering servant mentioned in this chapter is actually a reference to the crucifixion and suffering of Jesus on the cross to atone for the sins of mankind. However, according to the classical Jewish comentators, the suffering servant described in Isaiah chapter 53 is actually the Jewish people; sometimes Isaiah mentions groups of people as if they were one person. *Isaiah 9:1,2 ‚Äì In Isaiah, the passage describes how Assyrian invaders are increasingly aggressive as they progress toward the sea, while Matthew 4:13‚Äì15 has re-interpreted the description as a prophecy stating that Jesus would progress (without any hint of becoming more aggressive) toward Galilee. While Matthew uses the Septuagint rendering of Isaiah, in the Masoretic text it refers to the region of the gentiles rather than Galilee of the nations. *Daniel 9:24‚Äì27 ‚Äì King James Version puts a definite article before \\"Messiah the Prince\\". (Daniel 9:25) The original Hebrew text does not read \\"the Messiah the Prince\\", but, having no article, it is to be rendered \\"a mashiach, a prince\\". The word mashiach[\\"anointed one\\", \\"messiah\\"] is nowhere used in the Jewish Scriptures as a proper name, but as a title of authority of a king or a high priest. Therefore, a correct rendering of the original Hebrew should be: \\"an anointed one, a prince.\\" *Hosea 11:1 ‚Äì Matthew 2:14 states, \\"So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'Out of Egypt I called my son.'\\" However, that passage reads, \\"When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.\\" *Psalm 22:16 ‚Äì The NIV renders this verse as \\"they have pierced my hands and my feet\\", based on the Septuagint. However, there is some controversy over this translation, since the Hebrew Masoretic Text reads ◊õ◊ê◊®◊ô ◊ô◊ì◊ô ◊ï◊®◊í◊ú◊ô (\\"like a lion my hands and my feet\\"). If the NIV translation is correct, however, then it would also be a prophecy of crucifixion since the original text was written before the Persians had invented the first early stages of crucifixition. *Psalm 16:10 *Psalm 34:20 - States that none of the messiah's bones will be broken. In John 19:31-33, during the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, the Jews asked the Roman governor Pontius Pilate to break the legs of those who were being crucified because it was the Sabbath day. When breaking the legs of the two who were crucified with Jesus, they had come to Jesus and they had found that he was already dead and did not break his legs. Thus many Christians believe that this event is the fulfillment of this prophecy. *Psalm 69:21 *Isaiah 9:6 ‚Äì The verse reads: \\"For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.\\" *Psalm 110:1 ‚Äì Matthew 22:44 states \\"The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies under your feet.\\" Although Hebrew has no capital letters, the Hebrew translation of that passage reads \\"The Lord said to my lord\\" indicating that it is not speaking of God. *Micah 5:2 ‚Äì Matthew 2:6 quotes this prophecy as fulfillment of the prophecy: \\"But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people Israel.\\" The verse in the Old Testament reads \\"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are small among the clans of Judah, out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over Israel, whose origins are from of old, from ancient times.\\" It describes the clan of Bethlehem, who was the son of Caleb's second wife, Ephrathah. (1 Chr. 2:18, 2:50‚Äì52, 4:4) *Zechariah 12:10 ‚Äì According to many Christians this passage predicts the people looking on the Messiah whom they have pierced, while God's grace is being poured out on the House of David (Israel) and the city of Jerusalem. *Zechariah 9:9 ‚Äì The Gospel of Matthew describes Jesus' triumphant entry on Palm Sunday as a fulfillment of this verse in Zechariah. Matthew describes the prophecy in terms of a colt and a separate donkey, whereas the original only mentions the colt. Matthew 21:1‚Äì5 reads: . The Hebrew translation of the prophecy reads: The gospels of Mark, Luke, and John state Jesus sent his disciples after only one animal. (Mark 11:1‚Äì7, Luke 19:30‚Äì35, John 12: 14,15) Critics claim this is a contradiction with some mocking the idea of Jesus riding two animals at the same time. A response is that the text allows for Jesus to have ridden on a colt that was accompanied by a donkey, perhaps its mother. * Matthew 2:17,18 gives the killing of innocents by Herod as the fulfillment of a prophecy in Jeremiah 31:15‚Äì23: \\"A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more. (The phrase \\"because her children are no more\\" refers to the captivity of Rachel's children. The subsequent verses describe their return to Israel.) * II Samuel 7:14 ‚Äì Hebrews 1:5 quotes this verse as, \\"I will be his Father, and he will be my Son.\\". Rashi Rashi, a 10th-century French rabbi, gave the following commentaries regarding Bible prophecies:Chabad.Org Tanakh With Rashi's Commentary * Genesis 15:18 \\" To your seed I have given The word of the Holy One, blessed be He, is like an accomplished fact.\\" * Genesis 17:8 \\" for an everlasting possession And there I will be to you for a God (Gen. Rabbah 46:9), but if one dwells outside the Holy Land, it is as though he has no God (Keth. 110b).\\" * Exodus 34:11 \\" the Amorites... Six nations are [enumerated] here [not the proverbial seven], because the Girgashites [i.e., the seventh nation] got up and emigrated because of them [the Israelites]. -[from Lev.

Similarly is (Deut. 19:5),‚Äúand the iron [axe blade] will cause to fly [from the tree].‚Äù * Joshua 15:63 \\" the children of Judah could not drive them out We learned in Sifrei : Rabbi Joshua the son of Korha says: They really could, but they were not permitted, because of the oath which Abraham had sworn to Abimelech. Now these Jebusites were not of the Jebusite nation, but the Tower of David which was in Jerusalem, was called Jebus, and the inhabitants of that section were of the Philistines. And when the children of Judah conquered Jerusalem, they did not drive out the inhabitants of that section.\\" * Judges 1:19 \\" but they could not drive out Targum Jonathan paraphrases: But after they had sinned, they were unable to drive out the inhabitants of the plain.\\" * Judges 1:21 \\" the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem There was a section in Jerusalem called Jebuse, which was populated by the descendants of Abimelech who were not driven out because of the oath [which Abraham had sworn], until the coming of David. This was because his grandson was still alive and Abraham had sworn [Gen. 21:23] to him, his son, and grandson.\\" * 2 Samuel 5:6 \\" to the Jebusites Mezudath Zion is called Jebus. Now they (the inhabitants of the area) were of the seed of Abimelech, and they were in possession of two statues, one blind and the other lame, symbolizing Isaac (who was blind in his latter years. See Gen. 22:1) and Jacob (who turned lame as a result of his bout with the angel. See Gen. 32:26), and in their mouths was the oath that Abraham had sworn to Abimelech (Gen. 22:23). For this reason they (the Israelites who had conquered the land) did not drive them out, for when they took Jerusalem they failed to take the stronghold, as it is stated: ‚ÄúAnd the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the people of Judah were unable, etc.‚Äù (Josh. 15:63) - it was learned: R.

And in the days of these kings in the days of these kings, when the kingdom of Rome is still in existence. the God of heaven will set up a kingdom The kingdom of the Holy One, blessed be He, which will never be destroyed, is the kingdom of the Messiah. * Daniel 7:4-8 \\" The first one was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle It was like a lion, and it had the wings of an eagle; that is the kingdom of Babylon, which was ruling at that time, and so did Jeremiah see it (4:7): ‚ÄúA lion has come up from its thicket,‚Äù and he says also (48:40): ‚Äúlike an eagle he shall soar.‚Äù until its wings were plucked Its wings were plucked, which is an allusion to its downfall. resembling a bear This represents the kingdom of Persia, which will reign after Babylon, who eats and drinks like a bear and is enwrapped in flesh like a bear. and it stood to one side and it stood to one side, indicating that when the kingdom of Babylon terminates, Persia will wait one year, when Media will reign. and there were three ribs in its mouth Aram. ◊ï÷º◊™÷∞◊ú÷∏◊™ ◊¢÷¥◊ú÷∏◊¢÷¥◊ô◊ü ◊ë÷∞÷º◊§÷ª◊û÷∑÷º◊î÷º, three ribs. Our Sages explained that three provinces were constantly rebelling against it [i.e., Persia] and making peace with it; sometimes it would swallow them and sometimes spit them out. That is the meaning of ‚Äúin its mouth between its teeth,‚Äù sometimes outside its teeth, sometimes inside (Kid. 72a), but I say that the three ◊¢÷¥◊ú÷∏◊¢÷¥◊ô◊ü are three kings who will rise from Persia: Cyrus, Ahasuerus, and Darius who built the Temple. four wings... four heads They are the four rulers to whom Alexander of Macedon allotted his kingdom at his death, as is written in the book of Joseph ben Gurion (Book 3, ch. 14), for this third beast is the kingdom of Antiochus, and it is called ◊†÷∏◊û÷µ◊® because it issued decrees upon Israel [which were] spotted (◊û÷∞◊†÷ª◊û÷∏÷º◊®◊ï÷π◊™) and varied one from the other. and... ten horns Aram. ◊ï÷∞◊ß÷∑◊®÷∞◊†÷∑◊ô÷¥◊ü ◊¢÷≤◊©÷∑◊Ç◊®.

That is Titus, about whom the Rabbis, of blessed memory, said (Gittin 56b) that he blasphemed and berated and entered the Heichal with brazenness.\\" * Daniel 7:25 \\" until a time, two times, and half a time This is an obscure end, as was said to Daniel (12:4): ‚ÄúAnd you, Daniel, close up the words and seal,‚Äù and the early commentators expounded on it, each one according to his view, and the ends have passed. We can still interpret it as I saw written in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon, that they are the 1,335 years stated at the end of the Book (12:12): ‚ÄúFortunate is he who waits [and reaches the days one thousand three hundred and thirty- five],‚Äù and he explains the appointed time as until the time of two times and a half time, and he [Rav Saadia Gaon] said that the times are 480 [years], which is the time from the Exodus from Egypt until the Temple was built, and 410 [years], [which are] the days of the First Temple, totaling 890, and another half of this time, 445, totaling 1,335. Figure these from the time the daily sacrifice was discontinued until the daily sacrifice will be restored to its place; it was discontinued six years prior to the destruction, and there is somewhat of a proof in this Book. [See Rashi to 8:14.] Others bring further proof to this computation, namely that (Deut. 31: 18): ‚ÄúAnd I, will hide My face‚Äù [the words] ◊î÷∑◊°÷∞◊™÷µ÷º◊® ◊ê÷∑◊°÷∞◊™÷¥÷º◊ô◊® add up in gematria to 1,335.\\" * Daniel 8:14 \\" Until evening and morning, two thousand and three hundred I saw an interpretation in the name of Rav Saadia Gaon for this matter, but it has already passed, and he interpreted further ‚Äúuntil evening and morning,‚Äù that evening about which it says (Zech. 14:7): ‚Äúand it shall come to pass that at eventide it shall be light,‚Äù and we are confident that our God's word will stand forever; it will not be nullified. I say, however, that the ◊¢÷∂◊®÷∂◊ë and ◊ë÷π÷º◊ß÷∂◊® stated here are a gematria, and there is support for this matter from two reasons: 1) that this computation should coincide with the other computation at the end of the Book, and 2) that Gabriel said to Daniel later on in this chapter (verse 26): ‚ÄúAnd the vision of the evening and the morning is true.‚Äù Now, if he had not hinted that the computation was doubtful, why did he repeat it to say that it was true? And the seer was commanded to close up and to seal the matter, and to him, too, the matter was revealed in a closed and sealed expression, but we will hope for the promise of our king for end after end, and when the end passes, it will be known that the expounder has erred in his interpretation, and the one who comes after him will search and expound in another manner. This can be interpreted [as follows]: namely, that ◊¢÷∂◊®÷∂◊ë ◊ë÷π÷º◊ß÷∂◊® has the numerical value of 574, ◊¢ = 70; ◊® = 200; ◊ë = 2; ◊ë = 2; ◊ß = 100; ◊® = 200. Added together, this equals 574; plus 2,300, we have 2,874. and the holy ones shall be exonerated The iniquity of Israel shall be expiated to bring an end to the decrees of their being trodden upon and crumbled since they were exiled in their first exile to Egypt, until they will be redeemed and saved with a perpetual salvation by our king Messiah, and this computation terminates at the end of 1, 290 years from the day the daily sacrifice was removed, and that is what is stated at the end of the Book (12:11): ‚ÄúAnd from the time the daily sacrifice is removed, and the silent abomination placed, will be 1,290 years,‚Äù and no more, for our king Messiah will come and remove the silent abomination. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction of the Second Temple, and an image was set up in the Heichal. Now that was the seventeenth day of Tammuz, when Apostomos burned the Torah, put an end to the daily sacrifice, and set up an image in the Heichal, as we learned in Tractate Ta‚Äôanith (26b), but for the six years that I mentioned, I have no explicit proof, but there is proof that the daily sacrifice was abolished less than a complete shemittah cycle before the destruction, for so did Daniel prophesy about Titus (9:27): ‚Äú‚Ä¶ and half the week of years [shemittah cycle] he will curtail sacrifice and meal-offering,‚Äù meaning that a part of the week of years before the destruction, sacrifices will be abolished. So it is explained below in this section. Let us return to the earlier matters, how the computation of ‚Äúevening and morning, two thousand and three hundred,‚Äù fits exactly with the time commencing from the descent to Egypt to terminate at the end of 1,290 years until the day that the daily sacrifice was abolished: 210 years they were in Egypt. 480 years transpired from the Exodus until the building of the Temple. 410 years the Temple existed. 70 years was the Babylonian exile. 420 years the Second Temple stood. 1,290 should be added until the end of days, totaling: 2,880. Subtract six years that the daily sacrifice was removed before the destruction, for Scripture counted 1,290 years only from the time that the daily sacrifice was removed. Here you have the computation of ‚Äúevening and morning, and 2,300‚Äù added to the computation. Fortunate is he who waits and reaches the end of days 45 years over 1,290 [years]. We may say that the king Messiah will come according to the first computation, and he will subsequently be concealed from them for forty-five years. Rabbi Elazar HaKalir established (in the concluding poem of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): in the foundation of his song: six weeks of years, totaling 42. We may say that the three years that did not total a week of years he did not count. And I found it so in Midrash Ruth that the king Messiah is destined to be concealed for forty-five years after he reveals himself, and proof is brought from these verses.\\" * Daniel 12:11-12 \\" And from the time the daily sacrifice was removed in order to place a silent abomination in its stead, are days of one thousand two hundred and ninety years since the daily sacrifice was removed until it will be restored in the days of our King Messiah, and this calculation coincides with the calculation of (8:14): ‚Äúevening and morning, two thousand and three hundred‚Äù from the day of their exile to Egypt until the final redemption: Egyptian exile 210; From their Exodus until the First Temple 480; First Temple 410; Babylonian exile 70; Second Temple 420; Totaling 1590. The daily sacrifice was removed six years before the destruction, which equals 1584. Add 1290, and the total sum is 2874; like the numerical value of ◊ë÷π÷º◊ß÷∂◊® ◊¢÷∂◊®÷∂◊ë [574] plus 2300 [2874].\\" Fortunate is he who waits etc. Forty five years are added to the above number, for our King Messiah is destined to be hidden after he is revealed and to be revealed again. So we find in Midrash Ruth, and so did Rabbi Eleazar HaKalir establish (in the concluding poem of the morning service of the portion dealing with the month of Nissan): ‚Äúand he will be concealed from them six weeks of years.‚Äù * Ezekiel 29:11 \\" neither shall it be inhabited for forty years Forty-two years of famine were decreed in Pharaoh‚Äôs dream, corresponding to the three times the dream is written. He saw seven bad cows and seven bad ears of grain (Gen. 41) and he told it to Joseph; hence we have [it mentioned] twice, and Joseph said to him, ‚ÄúThe seven thin and bad cows and the seven empty ears,‚Äù totaling forty-two for the famine. But they had only two, as it is stated (ibid. 45:6): ‚ÄúFor it is two years now that the famine has been on earth,‚Äù and when Jacob came down to Egypt, the famine ceased, for behold in the third year they sowed, as it is stated (ibid. 47:19): ‚Äúand then you give us seed that we may live etc.,‚Äù and the forty years were paid to them now: ‚Äúneither shall it be inhabited for forty years.‚Äù ◊™÷µ÷º◊©÷µ÷º◊Å◊ë means sera asijiee in Old French. will be settled, peopled.\\" * Ezekiel 29:21 \\" On that day will I cause the horn of the House of Israel to blossom out I have neither heard nor found the explanation of this verse. What is the blossoming of the horn of Israel in the downfall of Egypt? Was not Israel exiled eight years before the downfall of Egypt? [Therefore,] I say that ‚ÄúOn that day‚Äù refers back to the above section, (verse 13): ‚ÄúAt the end of forty years, I will gather the Egyptians.‚Äù That count ends in the year that Belshazzar assumed the throne, and we find in Daniel that in that year the kings of Persia began to gain strength, and downfall was decreed upon Babylon, as it is said (Dan. 7:1): ‚ÄúIn the first year of Belshazzar,‚Ä¶ Daniel saw a dream, etc.‚Äù; (verse 4) ‚ÄúThe first one was like a lion‚Äù - that is Babylon. And it is written (ad loc.): ‚ÄúI saw until its wings were plucked off, etc. (verse 5) And behold another, second beast, resembling a bear‚Äù that is Persia. And it is written (ad loc.) ‚ÄúAnd thus it was said to it, ‚ÄòDevour much flesh.‚Äô‚Äù i.e., seize the kingdom. And the kingdom of Persia was the blossoming of the horn of Israel, as it is said regarding Cyrus (Isa. 45:13): ‚ÄúHe shall build My city and free My exiles.‚Äù Now, how do we know that the forty years of Egypt ended at that time? [The proof is that] Egypt was given into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the twenty-seventh [year] of Nebuchadnezzar, in the year that this prophecy was said to Ezekiel. Add forty years, and you have sixty- seven. Deduct from them forty-five for Nebuchadnezzar and twenty-three for Evil-Merodach, as we say in Megillah (11b), one of these years counting for both [kings], as we say there: ‚Äúthey were incomplete years.‚Äù * Ezekiel 30:4 \\" and there will be quaking in Cush [Heb. ◊ó÷∑◊ú÷∞◊ó÷∏◊ú÷∏◊î,] expression of trembling. When they hear of Egypt‚Äôs downfall, they will fear for their lives: perhaps the king of Babylon will rise up against them.\\" * Ezekiel 30:18 \\" a cloud will cover her Trouble will come upon her and cover her, and it will become dark [for her] like a day covered with clouds.\\" * Ezekiel 30:21 \\" I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt already another time, for I placed his army in the hands of Nebuchadnezzar in the fourth year of Jehoiakim, as it is said in the Book of Jeremiah (46:2): ‚ÄúConcerning Egypt, concerning the army of Pharaoh-neco, the king of Egypt, which was on the Euphrates in Carcemish, whom Nebuchadnezzar king smote, etc.‚Äù and behold, it was not bound from that day on, as it is said at the end of the Book of Kings (II 24:7): ‚ÄúAnd the king of Egypt no longer went out of his land, for the king of Babylonia had taken from the river of Egypt,‚Äù and with this expression Jeremiah, too, prophesied concerning that blow, using the language ‚Äúit has no cure,‚Äù as it is said (Jer. 46:11): ‚ÄúGo up to Gilead and take balm, O virgin daughter of Egypt; in vain you have increased medicines, you have no cure.‚Äù ◊ó÷ª◊ë÷∏÷º◊©÷∏÷º◊Å◊î is an expression of binding, for they bind the broken bone.\\" * Jeremiah 12:14-15 \\" My wicked neighbors Egypt, Ammon and Moab, Tyre and Sidon, who were neighbors of Eretz Israel and were inflicting harm upon them. I will return and have pity on them They all suffered close to the destruction of the Temple, and concerning each one it is stated in this Book, ‚ÄúI will return the exile of‚Ä¶‚Äù * Jeremiah 33:18 \\" for all time There shall not be cut off from them seed fit to offer up a burnt-offering or to burn a meal-offering.\\" * Jeremiah 34:5 \\" You shall die in peace Our Sages stated that Nebuchadnezzar died during his lifetime (Moed Katan 28b), for all the days of Nebuchadnezzar his prisoners were not freed from their imprisonment, and when Nebuchadnezzar died, Zedekiah emerged from the prison. He died the next day and was buried with pomp.\\" * Isaiah 7:9 \\" if you do not believe My prophecy, you, Ahaz, and his people, for I know that you are wicked. * Isaiah 7:14 \\" the young woman My wife will conceive this year. This was the fourth year of Ahaz. Immanuel [lit. God is with us. That is] to say that our Rock shall be with us, and this is the sign, for she is a young girl, and she never prophesied, yet in this instance, Divine inspiration shall rest upon her. This is what is stated below (8:3): ‚ÄúAnd I was intimate with the prophetess, etc.,‚Äù and we do not find a prophet's wife called a prophetess unless she prophesied. Some interpret this as being said about Hezekiah, but it is impossible, because, when you count his years, you find that Hezekiah was born nine years before his father's reign. And some interpret that this is the sign, that she was a young girl and incapable of giving birth.\\" * Isaiah 13:17 \\" Behold I stir up Media against them Darius the Mede assassinated Belshazzar. So Scripture states (Dan. 5:30): ‚ÄúOn that very night, Belshazzar‚Ä¶ was slain‚Äù; (ibid. 6:1) ‚ÄúAnd Darius the Mede acquired the kingdom.‚Äù * Isaiah 13:22 \\" and her days The days of her flourishing shall not be extended, for Israel was promised (Jer. 29: 10): ‚ÄúWhen seventy years of Babylon are over, I will remember you.‚Äù And that remembering will be through Cyrus king of Persia, who will take the kingdom from Babylon after Darius the Mede, for they both, Media and Persia, joined over it, [i.e., over Babylon,] and stipulated between themselves, if the kings are from us, the governors are from you.\\" * Isaiah 17:2 \\" The cities of Aroer are abandoned Jonathan renders this as an expression of destruction. Comp. (Jer. 51:58) ‚Äúshall be destroyed (◊¢÷∑◊®÷∞◊¢÷µ◊® ◊™÷¥÷º◊™÷∞◊¢÷∑◊®÷∞◊¢÷∑◊®), and he explained it in reference to the cities of Aram, i.e., Jonathan renders it: Their cities are abandoned, they are destroyed. The Midrash Aggadah (introduction to Lam. Rabbah 10 [with variations], Yalkut Machin) asks in amazement, since Aroer was [part] of Eretz Israel, as it is said (Num. 32:34): ‚Äù and Aroer.‚Äú He is dealing with Damascus and he announces matters concerning Aroer? But, since in Damascus there were streets as numerous as the days of the solar year, and in each one was a pagan deity, which they would worship one day in the year, and the Israelites made them all into one group and worshipped all of them every day, he, therefore, mentioned the downfall of Aroer juxtaposed to Damascus. I explain it, however, according to the simple meaning of the verse, as follows: Since Rezin and Pekah son of Remaliah joined together, and the prophet prophesying about the downfall of Damascus, and saying, ‚Äù Behold, Damascus shall be removed from [being] a city,\\" and the cities of Aroer which belonged to Pekah were already abandoned, for the Reubenites and the Gadites had already been exiled, and they were always given to the flocks of sheep, and the sheep of Moab would lie there undisturbed, he continues to say that the kingdom of Pekah shall continue to be gradually terminated, and that Samaria, too, shall be captured in the days of Hoshea, and then (v. 3) And a fortress shall cease from Ephraim and a kingdom from Damascusfor Rezin shall be killed.\\" * Isaiah 19:5 \\" And water from the sea shall dry up And the sea shall not return the Nile to its source, but the Nile will descend into it and will not ascend to water Egypt.\\" * Isaiah 19:17 \\" And the land of Judah shall be to Egypt for a dread When those remaining in Egypt from the captivity of Sennacherib hear of his downfall, that he will fall in the land of Judah without any physical warfare, they will know that the Divine Presence is manifest in Israel and that their Savior is mighty, and they will fear and be frightened of the land of Judah.\\" * Isaiah 19:18 \\" On that day there shall be five cities, etc. We learned in Seder Olam (ch. 23): Following Sennacherib‚Äôs defeat, Hezekiah stood up and released the armies he had brought with him from Egypt and from Cush in chains before Jerusalem, and they imposed upon themselves the kingdom of heaven, and returned to their place, and it is said: ‚ÄúOn that day there shall be five cities, etc.‚Äù They went and built an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt and they would sacrifice on it to heaven, to fulfill what was said: On that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt. Some of our Sages expounded it in the tractate Menahoth (109b) as referring to the altar of the temple of Onias the son of Simon the Just, who fled to Egypt and built an altar there.\\" * Isaiah 19:23-25 \\" there shall be a highway And there shall be a paved road by which they will always go from Egypt to Assyria. and Assyria shall come upon Egypt Jonathan renders: And the Assyrians shall wage war with the Egyptians. Israel shall be a third to Egypt and to Assyria for a blessing, since there was no prominent nation in the world at that time like Egypt and like Assyria, and the Jews were humble in the days of Ahaz and in the days of Hoshea the son of Elah. And the prophet states that, through the miracle that will be performed for Hezekiah, Israel's name will be greatly magnified, and they will be as prominent as one of these kingdoms in regards to blessing and greatness. Which...blessed them [lit. him,] i.e., Israel. Blessed is My people Israel, whom I chose for Myself as a people when they were in Egypt. and the work of My hands I showed them with the mighty deeds I performed wondrously against Assyria, and through those miracles they will repent and be as though I just made them anew, and they will be My heritage, Israel. Jonathan paraphrased this in a similar manner.\\" * Zechariah 10:11 \\" the waves of the sea to sink Tyre.\\" * Obadiah 1:18 \\" for the Lord has spoken Now where did He speak? (Num. 24:19) ‚ÄúOut of Jacob shall come a ruler, and he shall destroy him that remains in the city.‚Äù [from Mechilta Bo 12:16, Pirkei d‚ÄôRabbi Eliezer ch.37]\\" * Haggai 2:6 \\" and I will shake up with the miracles performed for the Hasmoneans. the heaven, etc. And they will understand that My Shechinah rests in this House, and they will bring gifts of silver and gold, as is written in the book of Joseph ben Gurion.\\" Muhammad These passages have been interpreted by some Muslim scholars as prophetic references to Muhammad. This claim has always been unacceptable to most Bible scholars. All the following are Muslim scholars' interpretations of various Biblical passages. *Genesis 21:13,18 ‚Äì God promises to make Ishmael a great nation. Ishmael is the half brother of Isaac, the father of the Jews. *Deuteronomy 18:18 and 33:1,2 ‚Äì God promises to raise a prophet who would be among the brethren of the Jews and like unto Moses. Muslim scholars interpret \\"brethren\\" as a reference to Ishmaelites, the ancestors of Muhammad. Muslims believe that Muhammad resembled Moses as a married father; warrior; law-giver; who was forced to immigrate; and raised by non-parents. *Habakkuk 3:3 ‚Äì Muhammad's migration from Mecca to Medina. Since according to Genesis 21:21 the wilderness of Paran was the place where Ishmael settled (i.e. Arabia, specifically Mecca). *Isaiah 21:13‚Äì17 ‚Äì Arabia is the land of the promised one.Muhammad, in the Bible *John 1:19‚Äì25 has John the Baptist being asked if he was \\"the Prophet\\" after denying he was the Messiah or Elijah. Islamic preacher Ahmed Deedat said this was a prophecy of Muhammad. *John 14:16, 15:26, 16:7 and John 18:36 ‚Äì These verses describe a Paraclete or comforter. John 14:26, identifies it as the Holy Ghost, while Muslim scholars doubt the underlying meaning of the term. *John 16:12‚Äì14 ‚Äì Comforter was to bring complete teachings. Christians actually believe this prophecy was the outpouring of the holy spirit on the day of Pentecost.Walvoord, John F. \\"Ever Prophecy of The Bible\\" pg. 430‚Äì431. *Matthew 21:42‚Äì44 ‚Äì The rejected stone according to Islamic understanding of these passages is the nation of Ishmael's descendants which was victorious against all super-powers of its time. \\"The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.\\" *Acts 3:20‚Äì22 ‚Äì Muhammad to come before the second advent of Jesus The B√°b and Bah√°'u'll√°h Followers of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith believe that Bah√°'u'll√°h is the return of Christ \\"in the glory of the Father\\" and that the passages below were fulfilled by the coming of the B√°b and Bah√°'u'll√°h, the two most recent Manifestations of God, in 1844 AD and 1863 AD, respectively. *Daniel 8:14 ‚Äì According to the day-year principle, this period of 2300 days is interpreted as 2300 years. Beginning in the year of an edict by Artaxerxes to rebuild Jerusalem (457 B.C.), this period ends in the year 1844 AD. *Micah 7:12‚Äì15 ‚Äì Prophesies the place of the second appearance of Christ. Bah√°'u'll√°h proclaimed He was the Promised One in Baghdad, one of the main centers of the Assyrian Empire. *Revelation 11 ‚Äì Refers to a period of 1260 years, \\"the cycle of the Qur‚Äô√°n,\\" which ends in the year 1844 AD (the year 1260 of the Islamic calendar). *Revelation 12:1‚Äì6 ‚Äì Refers again to a period of 1260 years according to the day-year principle (see above). Book of Mormon Latter-Day Saints believe that the following biblical passages prophesy or otherwise support the provenance of the Book of Mormon: *(Gold plates to come out of the earth) ‚Äì Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven. (Psalm 85:11) *(Book of Mormon = Stick of Joseph; the Bible = Stick of Judah) ‚Äì The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying, Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions: then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel his companions: And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall become one in thine hand. And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these? Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they shall be one in mine hand. And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes.(Ezekiel 37: 15‚Äì20) *(Moroni thought to be the angel bringing the gospel in the form of the Book of Mormon) ‚Äì \\"And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.\\" (Revelations 14:6,7) Use by conservative Christians Biblical prophecy is believed to be literally true by a number of conservative Christians, such as Norman Geisler and Young Earth Creationists. Interpreters uphold this principle by providing details of prophecies that have been fulfilled. Interpreters also dispute the legitimacy of non-biblical prophets and psychics. Professor Peter Stoner and Dr. Hawley O. Taylor, for example, believed the Bible prophecies were too remarkable and detailed to occur by chance. Arthur C. Custance maintained that the Ezekiel Tyre prophecy (Ezek. 26: 1‚Äì11; 29:17‚Äì20) was remarkable. These interpretive issues are related to the more general idea of how passages should be read or interpreted‚Äîa concept known as Biblical hermeneutics. Bible prophecy is an area which is often discussed in regard to Christian apologetics. Traditional Jewish readings of the Bible do not generally reflect the same attention to the details of prophecies. Maimonides stated that Moses was the greatest of the prophets and only he experienced direct revelation.\\"Moses was superior to all prophets, whether they preceded him or arose afterwards. Moses attained the highest possible human level. He perceived God to a degree surpassing every human that ever existed....God spoke to all other prophets through an intermediary. Moses alone did not need this; this is what the Torah means when God says \\"Mouth to mouth, I will speak to him.\\" \\"Maimonides' Principles: The Fundamentals of Jewish Faith\\", in The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology, Volume I, Mesorah Publications 1994 Concern with Moses' revelation involves law and ethical teaching more than predictive prophecy. According to Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed the prophets used metaphors and analogies and, except for Moses, their words are not to be taken literally. According to the Talmud, prophecy ceased in Israel following the rebuilding of the second temple. Nonetheless Maimonides held that a prophet can be identified if his or her predictions come true. Multiple fulfillments Many scholarly and popular interpreters have argued that a prophecy may have a dual fulfillment; others have argued for the possibility of multiple fulfillments. In some senses this has been occasionally referred to as an apotelesmatic interpretation of specific prophecies. In Christian eschatology, the idea of at least a dual fulfillment is usually applied to passages in the apocalyptic books of Daniel or Revelation, and to the apocalyptic discourse of Jesus in the synoptic gospels (Matthew 24, Mark 13, Luke 21), especially in interpretations that predict a future tribulation and a future Antichrist figure. Futurists and Historicists usually hold to variations of this view, while Preterists see the same passages as applying only to events and persecutions from the time of Daniel through the first century CE. Some who believe in multiple fulfillment tend to restrict the idea to a view of history where ancient events reflecting Israel and first-century Judaism and Christianity are predictors of larger future events to happen on a global scale at a point in time, while others tend to include symbolic applications of prophecies to multiple entities and events throughout history.e.g., \\"...the seven heads would mean all the oppressive, tyrannical civil governments during all human history from the days of Nimrod to the very end of time. This would be the larger view of the subject, what theologians call the apotelesmatic meaning of the prophecy, sub specie aeternitatis‚Äîthe way the heavenly intelligences see it.\\" PDF copy retrieved from Henry Kett suggested multiple fulfillments in his 1799 book History the Interpreter of Prophecy, in which he outlined numerous fulfillments for Antichrist prophecies, with chapters on the \\"Papal power\\", \\"Mahometanism\\" and \\"Infidelity\\" as parts of a long series of fulfillments of the prophecies. Samuel Horsley (1733-1806) stated \\"The application of the prophecy to any one of these events bears all the characteristics of a true interpretation\\".As quoted by J. W. Burgon, in Appendix A of Inspiration and Interpretation(1861, reproduced online at Project Gutenberg). Moses Stuart (1780‚Äì1852) differentiated the idea that a prophetic passage has an inherent dual sense or double meaning from the idea of a later application of the prophecy in subsequent events, separate from the original prophecy: \\"In these principles there is no double sense; no ·ΩëœÄœåŒΩŒøŒπŒ± [huponoia or \\"suspicion\\"], in the sense in which that word is usually employed and understood. But there may be an apotelesmatic view or sense of a passage in the ancient Scriptures; and this is the case whenever a proceeding or a principle is reillustrated or reconfirmed. This makes out no double sense, but a fuller and more complete exhibition of the one and simple meaning of the original. Well may it be named a œÄŒªŒÆœÅœâœÉŒπœÇ [plerosis or \\"fulfillment / fulfilling\\"].\\" Stuart noted prior usage of the term \\"apotelesmatic\\" by European interpreters. Other interpreters have referred to an apotelesmatic meaning of prophecy as a collapsing of perspective of \\"near\\" and \\"far\\" or \\"inaugurated\\" and \\"consummated\\" fulfillments, where from the viewpoint of the ancient Israelite prophet local events affecting Israel are merged with end-time cosmic events relating to the kingdom of God. C. F. Keil (1807‚Äì1888) suggested in an influential commentary \\"this uniting together of the two events is not to be explained only from the perspective and apotelesmatic character of the prophecy, but has its foundation in the very nature of the thing itself. The prophetic perspective, by virtue of which the inward eye of the seer beholds only the elevated summits of historical events as they unfold themselves, and not the valleys of the common incidents of history which lie between these heights, is indeed peculiar to prophecy in general, and accounts for the circumstance that the prophecies as a rule give no fixed dates, and apotelesmatically bind together the points of history which open the way to the end, with the end itself.\\" Seventh-day Adventist theologian Desmond Ford (Historicist) termed this belief the apotelesmatic principle and stated \\"The ultimate fulfillment is the most comprehensive in scope, though details of the original forecast may be limited to the first fulfillment.\\" Ford's application of this principle to the Adventist understanding of the prophecy of Daniel 8:14 created a controversy that caused his termination of employment with that denomination. On the other hand, Dispensational Futurist theologian Randall Price applies the term \\"apotelesmatic\\" primarily to the sense of \\"prophetic postponement\\" or \\"an interruption in fulfillment\\" that dispensationalists hold occurs between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks of the seventy weeks prophecy of Daniel 9:24‚Äì27: \\"The technical expression for this delay in the fulfillment of the messianic program for Israel is derived from the Greek verb apotelo meaning, 'to bring to completion, finish.' The usual sense of telos as 'end' or 'goal' may here have the more technical idea of 'the consummation that comes to prophecies when they are fulfilled' (Luke 22:37). With the prefix apo, which basically has the connotation of 'separation from something,' the idea is of a delay or interruption in the completion of the prophetic program. Therefore, apotelesmatic interpretation recognizes that in Old Testament texts that present the messianic program as a single event, a near and far historical fulfillment is intended, separated by an indeterminate period of time. Dispensational writers have referred to this as an 'intercalation' or a 'gap.' However, prophetic postponement better expresses this concept.\\" Halley's Bible Handbook, the Scofield Reference Bible and many other Bible commentaries hold that the \\"little horn\\" of Daniel 8 is fulfilled both with Antiochus Epiphanes (reigned 175-164 BC) and with a future Antichrist. Henry Kett, taking the writings of Sir Isaac Newton, advanced to identifying three fulfillments: Antiochus Epiphanes, the Romans, and a future Antichrist. Several Historicist interpreters (Faber, Bickersteth, Keith, Elliott, etc.) proposed the same, but noted that the Roman Empire is classified in two forms, the Pagan and the Papal, and that the Roman Empire was also split (East and West), and that in the East Mohammed or his religion were also meant, and more particularly the Turks, and that the final form (particularly according to authors writing after the Crimean War of 1853-1856) was Russia.Daniel by F.W.C. Neser Methodist theologian Adam Clarke (ca 1761-1832) concurred with Anglican bishop Thomas Newton (1704-1782) that the abomination of desolation as a proverbial phrase could include multiple events ‚Äúsubstituted in the place of, or set up in opposition to, the ordinances of God, his worship, his truth, etc.‚Äù This allows for viewing some, or all of the following events as partial fulfillments of this prophecy simultaneously: * the re-dedication of the Second Temple in Jerusalem to Zeus by Antiochus IV Epiphanes in 167 BC * the worship of the Roman standards on the Temple Mount under Titus in 70 AD * the building of the Dome of the Rock by the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in circa 690 AD The British Israelist Howard Rand (1963) wrote, ‚Äúbecause men have been able to see one‚Äîand only one‚Äîfulfillment, they have missed the greater scope of this prophecy and their understanding of the full message has been thwarted. ... Too, because of the double, triple and quadruple applications of this prophecy to world events, an enormous amount of history is involved in the cryptogrammic language of the vision.‚ÄùRand, H. B. (1963) Study in Daniel, (Merrimac: Destiny Publishers) pp. 282‚Äì283. Future=End times= Among most Christian denominations, the prophecy that Jesus will return to Earth is a major doctrine, which can be seen by its inclusion in the Nicene Creed. Many specific timeframes for this prediction have been declared by individuals and groups, although many of these dates have expired without the occurrences predicted.see Timeline of unfulfilled Christian Prophecy An official statement of the Vatican, issued in 1993, asserted, \\"we are already in the last hour\\". Biblical references claimed to prophesy the end times include: * The Old Testament prophet Isaiah prophesied that in the end times the Kingdom of God would be established in Jerusalem, as chief among the nations. This prophecy was also asserted by Micah of Moreseth. * The Old Testament prophet Hosea indicated that in the end times Israel would return to their land and seek the Lord their God. * This prophecy predicts that the gospel will be preached globally before the end occurs. * The Apostle Peter said that in the end times, God would pour out His spirit on all people and show signs in the heaven and on the earth before the coming great and dreadful Day of the Lord. * The Apostle Paul wrote that there would be terrible times in the end times. People would have a form of godliness but denying its power and moral decay will increase. * The author of Hebrews wrote that the world was already in the end times. * James wrote that people would hoard wealth in the end times to their destruction. * The Apostle Peter indicated that in the end times even religious people would dismiss the idea of Christ's return.

These stoves are designed primarily for backpackers, with a focus on light weight, durability and simple design. The company began in 1925, selling cookware. The Trangia stove was developed by 1951 . Trangia stoves were initially preferred to kerosene (paraffin) pressure stoves because they required only one type of fuel (alcohol, usually in the form of cheaper but deliberately poisonous methylated spirit). Trangia's selling point is that the entire packaged stove, including pots, is not significantly larger than a standard camp cooking pot. For this reason the Trangia has retained much of its popularity despite the development of alternative stove fuels and designs. Components A one-two person Trangia 27, aluminium The standard stove set includes a base, which lifts the burner off the ground and has vents to provide airflow, and a windscreen, which protects the pot and flame (the latter leading to its Swedish nickname, the \\"stormk√∂k\\", or \\"storm kitchen\\"). The standard stove also includes two billycans (pots), a pot lid/frying pan, an optional kettle and a handle, commonly referred to as a billy grip, used to grip onto the lip of the pots and pans. The entire set is designed to fit together in a single, portable package. The burner is a small brass cup that looks and functions similar to a beverage-can stove, though it predates aluminium beverage can packaging. A bit of fuel is poured into the burner and ignited. The heat from the flame causes the fuel to vaporize, forcing it out of 23 or 24 jets around the top of the burner, where it ignites and produces a steady cooking flame. The burner includes a removable \\"simmer ring\\", which partially blocks the flame in order to reduce heat output and threaded lid. Alternative burners are available allowing gas cartridges or white gasoline to fuel the Trangia. Types Air-flow diagram of a Trangia stove The standard stove sets come in several variants, with varying sizes of pots, some with non-stick finishes. A similar burner produced by Trangia is also a component in the Swedish military mess kit. The Finnish Defence Forces use the Trangia, given to soldiers when needed and does not form part of the basic equipment. There is also a Mini Trangia. It was specially produced for the multi-sport competition KIMM (Karrimor International Mountain Marathon). This consists of a standard burner (with simmer ring), small wind shield, 800 ml (28 fl oz) pot, 15 cm (6\\") frying pan and pot/pan grip (handle). The entire package weighs just 330 grams (12 oz), according to Trangia's website. The Mini Trangia is much more portable than the standard-sized Trangia and is even lighter than most liquid- fuelled, pressure stoves (which don't include pots or pans in the weight). However, it is not as windproof as the full-size Trangias. Originally, Trangia stoves were made entirely from aluminium (except for the burner, which has always been brass), in order to keep them lightweight. However, aluminum makes for a poor cooking surface, as food sticks to it, and it can add odd tastes to certain foods. Later, Trangia introduced Teflon-coated pots and pans. These are better for cooking, though the Teflon is susceptible to flaking off over time. More recently introduced is cookware made from titanium, ultra-light aluminum, anodized ultra-light aluminum, and \\"Duossal\\" (a portmanteau of \\"duo\\", \\"stainless steel\\", and \\"aluminum\\"), which is aluminum with a stainless steel cooking surface.

The main campus is named after Zeferino, who strived to bring together some of Brazil's best scientists to form a recognised research institution. Zeferino was born and lived his childhood in S√£o Paulo. He attended the Medicine school of the University of S√£o Paulo and got his M.D. degree in 1932, with specializations in Parasitology, Parasitic Diseases, Biology, Genetics and Zoology. Shortly after his graduation, Zeferino became professor of Zoology and Parasitology in the Veterinary Medicine School of the University of S√£o Paulo. He was the director of the Veterinary Medicine School from 1936 to 1947. From 1951 to 1964 he was the director-founder of the Medical School of Ribeir√£o Preto, and during this period, in 1963, he was state secretary of public health. From 1964 to 1965 he was the first president of the S√£o Paulo State Council of Education and rector of the University of Bras√≠lia. In 1965 Zeferino was designated president of the organizing commission for the Universidade Estadual de Campinas. Zeferino became rector in 1966 and stayed in the office until 1978\\\\. Zeferino led the construction of the university campus, now named after him, which had its first building inaugurated in 1968. Zeferino was responsible for bringing scientists from other universities, and this helped Unicamp become one of the most productive and respected research institutions of Latin America. By the end of Zeferino's administration, the university had evolved from the Medicine College to a university with 7 institutes, 6 colleges, 2 technical schools and 10 service units. Zeferino retired in 1978, but remained president of the Unicamp development foundation (Funcamp) until 1981, when he died of coronary problems.

It is the potassium salt of peroxymonosulfuric acid. The triple salt 2KHSO5¬∑KHSO4¬∑K2SO4 (known by the tradename Oxone) is a form with higher stability. The standard electrode potential for this compound is +1.81 V with a half reaction generating the hydrogen sulfate (pH=0). ::HSO5‚àí \\\\+ 2 H+ \\\\+ 2 e‚àí ‚Üí HSO4‚àí \\\\+ H2O  Reactions  MPS is a versatile oxidant. It oxidizes aldehydes to carboxylic acids; in the presence of alcoholic solvents, the esters may be obtained. Internal alkenes may be cleaved to two carboxylic acids (see below), while terminal alkenes may be epoxidized. Sulfides give sulfones, tertiary amines give amine oxides, and phosphines give phosphine oxides. Illustrative of the oxidative power of this salt is the conversion of an acridine derivative to the corresponding acridine-N-oxide. 350px MPS will also oxidize a sulfide to a sulfone with 2 equivalents. With one equivalent the reaction converting sulfide to sulfoxide is much faster than that of sulfoxide to sulfone, so the reaction can conveniently be stopped at that stage if so desired. 270px MPS can also react with ketones to form dioxiranes, with the synthesis of dimethyldioxirane (DMDO) being representative. These are versatile oxidising agents and may be used for the epoxidation of olefins. In particular, if the starting ketone is chiral then the epoxide may be generated enantioselectively, which forms the basis of the Shi epoxidation. The Shi epoxidation  Uses = Swimming Pools = Potassium peroxymonosulfate can be used in swimming pools to keep the water clear, thus allowing chlorine in pools to work to sanitize the water rather than clarify the water, resulting in less chlorine needed to keep pools clean.\\"Benefits of Using a Non-Chlorine Shock Oxidizer Powered by DuPont Oxone\\" Dupont.com .

Biography Silva was born a British subject to an Azorean/Portuguese mother, Irene da Silva, and a black Bermudian father known only as \\"Ruby\\". He emigrated to the United States at the age of five with his mother, eventually acquiring U.S. citizenship by the age of 18 or 19. He adopted the stage name of Alan Silva in his twenties. Silva was quoted in a Bermudan newspaper in 1988 as saying that although he left the island at a young age, he always considered himself Bermudian. He was raised in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, where he first began studying the trumpet, and moved on to study the upright bass. Silva is known as one of the most inventive bass players in jazz and has performed with many in the world of avant-garde jazz, including Cecil Taylor, Sun Ra, Albert Ayler, Sunny Murray, and Archie Shepp. Silva performed in 1964's October Revolution as a pioneer in the free jazz movement, and for Ayler's Live in Greenwich Village album. He has lived mainly in Paris since the early 1970s, where he formed the Celestrial Communication Orchestra, a group dedicated to the performance of free jazz with various instrumental combinations. In the 1990s he picked up the electronic keyboard, declaring that his bass playing no longer surprised him. He has also used the electric violin and electric sarangi on his recordings. In the 1980s Silva opened a music school I.A.C.P. (Institute for Art, Culture and Perception) in Central Paris, introducing the concept of a Jazz Conservatory patterned after France's traditional conservatories devoted to European classical music epochs. Since around 2000 he has performed more frequently as a bassist and bandleader, notably at New York City's annual Vision Festivals.

It was developed after 1965 to replace the AMX-VCI in service with the mechanized regiments of the French Army; the first prototypes were completed in 1968. Production commenced between 1972 and 1973. The AMX-10P is fully amphibious, being propelled through water at speeds of up to 7 km/h by twin waterjets. It is also fitted as standard with a trim vane and bilge pumps to assist with the flotation process. AMX-10Ps were popular with a number of Arab armies and have been operated by Iraq, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Special marine variants were also developed for Singapore and Indonesia, including a fire support model known as the AMX-10 PAC 90, which mated the AMX-10P chassis to the complete turret and 90 mm gun assembly of the Panhard ERC-90 Sagaie. AMX-10Ps share a number of common transmission and chassis components with their armoured car counterpart, the AMX-10RC. Development history The AMX-10P was developed by the Atelier de Construction d'Issy-les- Moulineaux (AMX) in response to a French army requirement for a new tracked armoured fighting vehicle to supplement or replace the ageing AMX-VCI. The first prototypes were completed around 1968 and showcased to potential domestic and international customers at Satory the following year. Production did not commence on the vehicle until the French Army placed its first order in late 1972. The first AMX-10Ps were delivered in mid to late 1973 to the 7th Mechanised Brigade stationed at Reims. French Army AMX-10Ps were fitted with a 20 mm autocannon in a Toucan II two-man turret with seating for a gunner and commander; however, a number of other one-man turrets could be fitted, as well as an observation cupola for training vehicles. Export variants of the AMX-10P also abounded, including models equipped with battlefield surveillance radars, the ATILA artillery fire control system, a bank of HOT anti-tank missiles, 60 mm or 81 mm gun-mortars, and a large 90 mm gun. Greece was the first foreign power to purchase the AMX-10P; between 1974 and 1977 the Hellenic Army ordered over a hundred individual vehicles from France, in three separate variants. Qatar followed up with an order for thirty AMX-10Ps in 1975, while Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia also accounted for large export orders during the early 1980s. GIAT Industries accepted a final order from Singapore for AMX-10P PAC-90s in 1994; following their delivery production lines for the AMX-10P were finally closed. At this point 1,750 AMX-10Ps had been manufactured. Approximately 108 AMX-10Ps remaining in service with the French Army underwent extensive overhauls to improve their armour and mobility between 2006 and 2008, including new gearboxes and suspension systems. They are gradually being retired and replaced by the wheeled V√©hicule Blind√© de Combat d'Infanterie.Pr√©sentation de la formation \\"VBCI\\" au 35e r√©giment d'infanterie. Description AMX-10P hulls are fabricated from a welded steel or aluminum alloy and notable for their parallel incorporation of the driving and engine compartments. The driver is seated at the front of the vehicle and to the left. An AMX-10P's driving compartment is provided with a single hatch cover opening to the rear and three periscopes intended for observation purposes when the hatch is closed. Night vision equipment was not fitted as standard to the base production model; however, one of the three driving periscopes could be replaced with combined day/night intensification sights as needed. The troop compartment is at the rear of the hull and provided with two roof hatches. Passengers embark and debark from a ramp, which is accessed through two doors at the rear. Transmission consists of a hydraulic torque converter coupled to a gearbox with one reverse and four forward driving gears. The AMX-10P utilises a torsion bar suspension, which supports five road wheels with the drive sprocket at the front and idler near the rear. These can be accessed from inside the hull through maintenance panels. Standard AMX-10P turrets are equipped with a GIAT M693 automatic cannon firing two different types of both high explosive ammunition and armour-piercing ammunition. More than one ammunition type may be loaded at once and fired alternatively. The high explosive rounds have a muzzle velocity of 1,050 m/s, while the latest armour-piercing round has a muzzle velocity of 1,300 m/s and is capable of penetrating 20 mm of rolled homogeneous armour at an incidence of 60¬∞. The autocannon has a cyclic rate of fire of 740 rounds per minute, with the gunner being able to switch between semiautomatic, limited burst, or fully automatic fire as necessary. =External= AMX-10Ps have a very distinctive, pointed hull and a sloping glacis plate, with the driver's position plainly visible to the left. The hull roof is horizontal as well as sloped slightly inwards, accommodating a turret ring near the centre of the chassis. Both hull sides are vertical and lack firing ports. There is a circular exhaust outlet on the right side of the hull above the second and third road wheels. Variants A Singapore Army AMX-10P PAC-90 with 90 mm gun * AMX-10P: Standard production model.

The jouhikko is a traditional, two- or three-stringed bowed lyre, from Finland and Karelia, Russia. Its strings are traditionally of horsehair. The playing of this instrument died out in the early 20th century but has been revived and there are now a number of musicians playing it. Name The Jouhikko is also called jouhikannel or jouhikantele, meaning a bowed kantele.Nieminen 2007, p. 19 In English, the usual modern designation is bowed lyre, although the earlier preferred term bowed harpAndersson 1970, p. 11 is also met with. There are different names for the instrument in different languages. History Perhaps the earliest definite depiction of this kind of instrument is the stone carving from Trondheim Cathedral, Norway, dating from the second quarter of the 14th century.Andersson 1970, p. 4 and plate 1a 18th- century writers in Latin mention instruments that seem to be a jouhikko,Andersson 1930, p. 46 but the first illustration comes from c. 1830 CE.Andersson 1930, p. 53 Folk music collectors in the late 19th and early 20th century visited players in Finland and Karelia, and collected instruments, noted tunes, made field recordings and took photographs. Repertory The jouhikko repertory was mostly collected in the field by A. O. V√§is√§nen from 1913 to 1931.Nieminen 2007, p. 27 The jouhikko was used for playing dance music, and the collected tunes are very short, and were largely improvised.Nieminen 2007, p. 25 The scale of the jouhikko is only 6 notes, with a constantly sounding drone. Tuning In a three-string jouhikko, the middle string, or in a two-string instrument, the lower or left hand string, is the drone string. Absolute pitch is not fixed, but in Nieminen's chartsNieminen 2007, p. 40 this is given the note d. The upper or right hand string, passing over the finger-hole, is fingered to give a scale, and this scale typically runs upwards from the note a 4th above the drone, or in Nieminen's charts, g a b c d e. The third or left hand string can be tuned down to a lower drone, or up to provide one of the melody notes.Nieminen 2007, p. 28 Playing technique The strings are stopped by touching them with the back of the fingers (the knuckles or nails), as there is no fingerboard to press the strings against. This fingering method is rather similar to the igil or the sarangi which also lack fingerboards. To touch the melody string the hand is inserted through a hole in the flat wooden board that makes up the top third of the instrument. On a 3-string instrument tuned g-d-a, the first note of the scale is played on the g string, which cannot be fingered as it lies on the far side of the drone and out of reach of the hand hole. The second note is the a string played open. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth notes of the scale are played with the backs of the four fingers, stopping the a string. Whilst it is possible to play higher notes by moving the hand further up the string all the traditional melodies are within a compass of six notes, the first six notes of either a major or minor scale. Modern revival Acoustic Electric Jouhikko by Charlie Bynum, Silver Spoon Music, NL. 2014 Modern instruments are made with horsehair, nylon, gut or even metal viola strings . Following Estonian talharpa technique, the hand hole is often made larger so that the hand can be inserted between the first and second strings, stopping the first with the insides of the fingers and the second with the outsideNieminen 2007, p. 155‚Äì156 The most prominent recent use of the jouhikko is the Finnish folk band Jouhiorkesteri, whose member Rauno Nieminen is considered to be the modern master of the instrument. Other bands using jouhikko include Finnish folk metal band Korpiklaani, and Estonian folk metal bands Raud-Ants and Metsat√∂ll. Kvitrafn (Einar Selvik) of the Norwegian traditional/folk band Wardruna uses his own made Jouhikko on their 2009 album Runaljod ‚Äì Gap Var Ginnunga. The Jouhikko sound has been recently popularized in performances by the traditional siberian/norse folk music of 'Nyttland' and also in the dark age trance music from celtic duo 'Primordia'. Related instruments The jouhikko is a member of a family of bowed lyre type instruments that stretches from Russia in the east, through Scandinavia, to Britain and Ireland. Most of these regions have only very sketchy evidence about their extinct bowed lyre traditions. The four-stringed Estonian talharpa and hiiu kannel have a wider hand hole and can play a wider range and shifting drones.Nieminen 2007, p. 29‚Äì35 The Welsh crwth is the most developed of this family to survive, with six strings, a fingerboard, and a complex playing style. Extinct or obscure variants include the Shetland gue and the English crowd. Other instruments are perhaps less closely related, including the bowed zithers such as the Finnish harppu, Icelandic fi√∞la, and the North American Inuit tautirut.

It was launched initially in 2008 and is no longer available to new orders.  Overview  Photoshop layout (Mac, prototype rendering) Quake III Arena layout. The production model uses the same 48x48 display for all keys including the space bar, unlike this rendering. The design featured on the studio's website received attention on the web when it was featured on Slashdot on July 14, 2005, and afterwards for a few weeks on other technology websites. The original release date was \\"end of 2006\\", however production issues caused the Optimus mini three to be developed first, with the full keyboard delayed until the end of 2007. The keyboard was number 10 in the Wired Magazine 2006 Vaporware Awards and number 4 on the list in 2007 due to its numerous delays and feature reductions. The Optimus allows for greater user interaction, by dynamically displaying the current function of the keys. For example, when the user presses the shift key, the pictures would change to upper-case versions. It would also make switching between different keyboard layouts (such as English and Cyrillic) rapid, and could make the switch to alternative layouts such as Dvorak easier for people who only have a QWERTY keyboard with no possibility of rearranging the keys. To demonstrate this concept, there are computer renderings showing example layouts for Quake III Arena and Adobe Photoshop.

The Square forms an integral component of the city's urban public transit system and constitutes a 'prestige address' for the international face of the city. It is bordered by Viger Street to the north, Saint Jacques Street to the south, Beaver Hall Hill to the west and Square Victoria Street (an extension of McGill Street) along the eastern side. As with other city squares, Square Victoria is open 24 hours per day to all citizens of Montreal and provides the role of an urban breathing space, with dense foliage to the south that tapers as the square rises up Beaver Hall Hill. History Victoria Square, 1943 The square has existed since 1813. Formerly known as Place du March√©-√†-Foin and Place des Commissaires, it was renamed for Queen Victoria for the visit of the then-Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1860. Victoria Square has undergone many aesthetic changes over its history, functioning at times more as a parking lot, other times as a simple open space, while at others being far more refined and cultivated. The Square was restored to its current configuration in 2002 and 2003. It features Hector Guimard's Art Nouveau outdoor entrance to the Square-Victoria-OACI Metro station, a statue of Queen Victoria, the Tai Chi Single Whip sculpture by Ju Ming, and trees lining its bounding avenues.

He specialised in cockney related humour based on life as a costermonger in London during the Victorian era. Owing to this and his ability to write songs, he became known to his audiences as the \\"costers' laureate\\". Born in London, Chevalier showed an interest in entertainment from an early age through his private performances to family and friends. He made his debut on the amateur stage when he was eight, performing in Julius Caesar, at the local Cornwall Hall. Soon after he joined a local amateur dramatics group before changing his stage name to \\"Albert Knight\\". Chevalier joined the music hall circuit in the 1880s and over the decade became very successful. His success meant that from the early 1890s he was able to choose which theatres to perform in and often performing at three or four halls each night. Together with his brother Charles Ingle he wrote a number of highly successful coster songs to support his act including \\"Wot cher!, or, Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\\", \\"The Future Mrs. 'Awkins\\", \\"Appy 'Ampstead\\", and the melodrama \\"My Old Dutch\\". As well as in London, Chevalier became popular with audiences in the English provinces which he toured over the length of his career. During the 1910s Chevalier moved from comedy into music composition for straight plays. With a deteriorating health his final appearance was in My Old Dutch at the Lyceum Theatre in 1920. The play was based on Chevalier's own song of the same name and had some success. The play ran for over a year and Chevalier completed his last performance in November 1922. He died aged 62 and was buried in Abney Park cemetery in the same plot as his son and father-in-law George Leybourne. Biography=Early life= Chevalier (left) and his brother, Auguste in the 1870s Chevalier was born Albert Onesime Britannicus Gwathveoyd Louis Chevalier, at 21 St Anne's Villas, Royal Crescent, London. The son of Jean On√©sime Chevalier, a French master at Kensington School, and his Welsh wife, Ellen Louisa Mathews; he had five siblings, two of whom died in infancy. His surviving brothers were Bertram, who in later life became a freelance photographer, and Auguste, who was better known as Charles Ingle, a composer of music hall songs.Daley, p. 19. Chevalier was educated at Clanricarde College, Bayswater, and later, St Mary's College, Richmond. From a young age he showed an interest in acting and privately performed scenes from The September Gale for his family when he was eight years old.Daley, p. 14. In 1869 Chevalier made his amateur debut on the stage performing as Mark Anthony in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, at Cornwall Hall in Notting Hill.\\"Part 1 ‚Äì Celebrities who performed at the Kenton\\" , Henley Amateur Operatic and Dramatic Society. Retrieved 21 September 2014. A year later, on 17 August, and at the same venue, he performed some minor scenes from The September Gale, this time to a paying audience. When he was 14 he joined a local amateur dramatics group called the Roscius Dramatic Club,Daley, p. 24. where he adopted the stage name, Albert Knight.Daley, pp. 26‚Äì27. When he left education, and to pay his drama fees, Chevalier took up a position as a clerk in a newspaper office, and then as a pupil teacher. It was in that job that his father introduced him to the playwright Dion Boucicault who arranged for a friend to mentor Chevalier's start in the theatre.\\"Albert Chevalier\\", Felbridge and District History Group. Retrieved 21 September 2014. =Theatrical beginnings= Madge Kendal and her husband William In 1876 Chevalier organised two amateur performances of The Quack Doctor and Handy Andy both of which he produced and starred in.Daley, p. 23. In 1877 Chevalier was engaged as an actor under the Bancrofts in London, and for some years played \\"legitimate\\" parts at the Court theatre and elsewhere. Chevalier's first professional appearance was alongside Madge Kendal and her husband William in An Unequal Match at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, London, on 29 September 1877; Chevalier appeared in the piece under his chosen stage name, Albert Knight.Daley, p. 27. The following year the Kendals engaged him to play the part of \\"Sam Winkle\\" in the drama The Omadhaun Witness and then in a small role in the comic farce Checkmate. The following January, and owing to Arthur Cecil's introduction of him to the Kendals, the show's producers, Chevalier toured for the first time in the highly successful melodrama Diplomacy in which he took the small role of \\"Antoine\\";Daley, p. 30. midway through the tour, Chevalier decided to change his stage name to his real moniker.Daley, pp. 35‚Äì36. The provincial press were complimentary of the show and singled out Chevalier in particular for his role. A critic for the Edinburgh Daily Review noted that although his part was small, \\"Mr. Chevalier's Antoine should be praised\\",Edinburgh Daily Review, 24 September 1878; taken from Daley, p. 36. while a theatre reviewer from the Liverpool Daily Post commented \\"The Parisian quaintness of Antoine, the \\"major domo of the Parisian m√©nage is exactly hit off by Mr. Chevalier.\\"Liverpool Daily Post, 22 October 1878; taken from Daley, p. 36. Chevalier remained until the end of the tour, after which he was engaged to appear at the Court Theatre, London in the comedy A Scrap of Paper in which he played the role of \\"Jones\\". The show opened on 6 January 1879 and was, according to Chavalier's biographer Brian Daley, \\"met with unquestioned success\\".Daley, p. 38. The following month he took a minor part in The Ladies Battle in which he took the role of \\"Montrichard\\", a characterisation which Daley describes as being \\"inimitable\\".Daley, p. 39. Through the summer of 1879 he undertook a series of small roles for the Kendals in Liverpool.Daley, p. 41. Towards the end of that year he was chosen by the Kendals to understudy for the main actors in the short plays M. le Duc, The Queen's Shilling and A Regular Fix.Daley, pp. 45‚Äì46. =1880s= In February 1881 Chevalier was chosen to form part of a touring company headed by the cellist and composer Auguste van Biene on a provincial tour of England. The classical plays, La Somnambula and The Grand Duchess were unsuccessful and the company were forced to raise funds by staging small concerts in rundown theatres in nearby towns. It was Chevalier's job to sing comic-songs, accompanied by a backdrop of classical music. They were booed and hissed from the audience who were leaving the hall rapidly. At the last minute Chevalier stepped in and performed a short ditty as \\"Sammy Stammers\\" which, as the title suggests, was a character with a stutter who sang comic songs. The audience believed his affliction and ridiculed him as they left. Unperturbed, van Biene staged Don Giovanni the following night, but the lead singer failed to show. Chevalier offered his services to van Biene and assumed the role with the added promise that he could make the show his own. During a break, Chevalier borrowed a box of props from the storeroom and went back on to impersonate the music hall star George H. Chirgwin. The show went well and he stayed with the company for the remainder of the tour.Daley, pp. 49‚Äì51. A few months later Chevalier was recruited for a short tour of Scotland. Among the places he visited were Glasgow, Coatbridge and Greenock the latter in which he enjoyed much success in the burlesques False Glitter and the show's after piece, Peebles.Daley, pp. 50‚Äì51. Chevalier was engaged to appear in Arthur Pinero's The Magistrate in 1885 and The Schoolmistress the following year. In 1889 he became the principal comedian at the Avenue Theatre, predominantly in burlesques. Throughout the 1880s he was a prolific writer of songs, including \\"Our 'armonic Club\\", which was written for the burlesque Aladdin, or, The Wonderful Scamp in around 1888. =Introduction to music hall= coster\\" costume, c. 1890 On 5 February 1891 Chevalier appeared for the first time on the music hall stage at the New London Pavilion, Piccadilly Circus. For his costume, Chevalier opted for a peaked cap, a check jacket, a necktie, and a pair of bell-bottomed trousers. In preparation, he sought advice from Marie Lloyd, an already established music hall singer in her own right and who formed part of the audience on his opening night. Also in the auditorium was a curious Lewis Carroll, a staunch opposer of music hall entertainment, who had come to hear about Chevalier's debut through friends. Carroll had earlier been impressed by Chevalier's performances in the straight theatre.Baker, p. 86. Writing in his memoirs, Carroll thought was \\"decidedly good as an actor; but as a comic singer (with considerable powers of pathos as well), he [was] quite first rate.\\"Collingwood, p. 316. He appeared in character as a costermonger, and sang \\"The Coster's Serenade\\", \\"The Nasty Way 'e Sez It\\", and \\"Funny Without Being Vulgar\\". Chevalier based his act upon the performances of Alfred Vance, a cockney comedian from the beginnings of the English music hall tradition. Chevalier also drew inspiration from the London characters of Charles Dickens, including Sam Weller, whom Chevalier had played unsuccessfully in a touring show. For the tour, he updated the character by modernising the dialogue and mixing it with the performance style used by mid-century cockney performers, including Vance. The changes resulted in Chevalier inventing a new, sentimental variation of Vance's \\"criminal coster\\", which was loosely based on a working-class Londoner. Chevalier's failure in the theatre was instrumental in his decision to start performing in music hall. The move into music hall was considered by some critics to be unusual for an actor in legitimate theatre, but it was welcomed by music hall syndicates who were eager to appeal to as many different audiences as they could. Chevalier justified his move by arguing that audiences were ready for something different and benefitted from support by George Bernard Shaw and the poet Arthur Symons. My Old Dutch\\" from 1892 From the early 1890s Chevalier agreed to only work in the major London music-halls, which he did for over a seven-year period, often performing at three or four halls each night. Together with his brother Charles he wrote a number of highly successful coster songs including \\"Wot cher!, or, Knocked 'em in the Old Kent Road\\", \\"The Future Mrs. 'Awkins\\", \\"Appy 'Ampstead\\", and the melodrama \\"My Old Dutch\\". As well as in London, Chevalier appeared in various concert halls throughout the English provinces, as he refused to appear in music halls outside of the capital. During the 1890s, Chevalier became a highly popular performer on the music hall stage, rivalled only by Dan Leno, whose comedy act was based much more on gritty working-class realism than Chevalier's aspirational romanticism. In 1893 Chevalier undertook managerial responsibilities at the Trocadero Music Hall; the venture proved disastrous, and left him with a ¬£10,000 debt. On 8 October 1894 he married Florence Isabel Leybourne (b. 1868/9) who was the daughter of the music hall performer George Leybourne; they had no children. Chevalier travelled to New York in 1896 where he repeated his success at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Despite suffering stage fright, the appearance was a success for the comedian, and he was hailed as one of the city's idols. Upon his return from America and Canada in 1896, Chevalier decided to reduce his music hall appearances owing to the unpredictability and inattentiveness of the genre's audiences, which he came to dislike. From the paying public's point of view, his style of humour had become common place within the music hall. His biggest rival was Gus Elen who had developed a more complex and comical alternative to Chevalier's. Instead, Chevalier decided to concentrate his time on creating comic characters which he used in one-man sketches which he called his \\"recitals\\". To keep within the audiences gaze, he still performed occasional coster songs and performed them alongside his characterisations. The characters included a country vicar in \\"Our Bazaar\\", a struggling actor in \\"A Fallen Star\\", and a west-country peasant in \\"E Can't Take a Roise out of oi\\". While none of these pieces earned the kind of success that his coster songs had achieved, Chevalier maintained a successful solo career performing them. His annual engagement at the Queen's Hall in London of twice-daily performances began in 1899 and ran in excess of 1000 performances. Chevalier returned to America in 1906 for a six-week tour with the French singer Yvette Guilbert who described her co-star as being \\"more skilful than actually talented\\".Guilbert, p. 198. During the 1900s he became one of the highest paid music hall stars in London, earning up to ¬£450 per week. He played the title role in J. M. Barrie's Pantaloon (1906) and in the same year appeared with the French chanteuse Yvette Guilbert. =Final years and death= Grave of George Leybourne, Albert Chevalier, and other family members in Abney Park Cemetery Chevalier continued to compose songs and perform in straight plays. His final appearance was at the Lyceum Theatre in 1920 in My Old Dutch, which Chevalier co-wrote with Arthur Shirley. The play was based on Chevalier's own song of the same name and had some success despite, according to the biographer Simon Featherstone, its by then \\"dated sentimentality\\". The play ran for over a year and Chevalier completed his last performance in November 1922. Chevalier died on 10 July 1923 at his home, Lake House, at 38 Woodberry Down, Stoke Newington. He was buried in Abney Park Cemetery on 13 July in the same plot as his son and father-in-law George Leybourne. He was survived by his wife. Legacy Albert Chevalier was in some ways an innovative popular performer who established the coster style of performance, wrote his own material, and exploited the commercial opportunities of the developing music-halls in the 1890s. He made commercial recordings of his songs, and appeared in several early films, including the 1915 British silent My Old Dutch. The English theatre critic Clement Scott noted Chevalier for his ability to interact with his audiences on a working class level and to modernise the music hall: \\"Albert Chevalier has had much ‚Äì very much ‚Äì to do with the wholesome reform of the modern music hall. An artist by instinct, he left the stage and, with laudable courage, he gave his talent to the common people. He understood that there was a warm heart under a corduroy jacket, a vein of sentiment even in the lowly costermonger and he gave us the ballads which are now household words.\\"Clement Scott, quoted in Daley, p. 152. The writer Richard Anthony Baker highlighted the \\"snobbery\\" of some theatre critics who thought that music hall entertainment was \\"innately inferior to the legitimate theatre\\". However, Baker opined that although Chevalier was an \\"entertainer and lyricist of considerable talent\\", the sentimentality of his act would, when compared to modern entertainment, be thought of as outdated.\\"Baker, p. 85.

Millhone, a former police officer turned private investigator, also appears in a number of short stories written by Grafton. Grafton's mystery novels featuring Millhone are set in 1980s Santa Teresa, a fictionalized town based on Santa Barbara, California. Biography The fictional character Kinsey Millhone was born on May 5, 1950. Her unusual first name was the maiden name of her mother, wealthy debutante Rita Cynthia Kinsey, who married Kinsey's father, Randy Millhone, against the wishes of Kinsey's grandmother, Cornelia LaGrand Kinsey (Grand), causing a family rift. Kinsey's parents were killed in a car wreck when she was five; Kinsey was trapped in the car with her dead parents for several hours before she was rescued, retaining only the memory of her mother weeping softly before her death. She then moved in with her mother‚Äôs sister Virginia (Aunt Gin), the only relative to side with Rita in the family rift, although Kinsey later finds out her parents were en route to a bridge-building family visit when the accident occurred. From her Aunt Gin, Kinsey acquired various eccentricities, including a liking for peanut-butter and pickle sandwiches. In high school, Kinsey was a self-described pot-smoking delinquent. After three semesters at the local community college she realized that academic life was not for her and she joined the Santa Teresa police force. After two years, Kinsey decided life in uniform wasn't for her, either, and quit the police force to become an investigator for California Fidelity, an insurance company, where Aunt Gin had worked. Eventually, she became a self-employed private investigator, initially mentored by local PI Benjamin Byrd, who had been a partner of another local PI, Morley Shine, before striking out on her own, solving various disappearances and murders, clearing names and dodging hitmen. For some years she maintained a loose relationship with CFI, then rented premises in the offices of her lawyer, Lonnie Kingman, before renting independent office space in later years. She has an antagonistic relationship with local policeman Con Dolan, although this mellowed into a reasonably amicable truce after Dolan's retirement and they have co-operated on more than one recent case. Kinsey is 5'6\\" tall, and weighs about 118 pounds. She has short, dark, thick hair that she trims with nail scissors, being generally uninterested in her physical appearance. She is, however, very particular about her teeth, and even mentions other people's good teeth (especially men to whom she might be attracted). Her wardrobe consists mostly of jeans and turtleneck sweaters, though she also owns an extremely wrinkle-resistant \\"little black dress\\" for those occasions when dressing up is unavoidable. She does, however, place a great premium on physical fitness and jogs three miles every weekday.\\"Sometimes I end up running for my life, so it will never do to get out of shape.\\" Kinsey in \\"falling off the roof\\", a short story in Kinsey and Me (2013) At the same time, she has a \\"penchant for junk food.\\" She also suffers from tinnitus, caused when she shot an attacker from inside a trash can. Kinsey has been divorced twice. Her first husband, Mickey, an ex-cop, appears in O is for Outlaw. Her second husband, Daniel, a struggling musician, appears in E is for Evidence, where he is revealed to be attracted to men. In most ways, Kinsey is a loner. She has no children and lives in an extremely compact studio apartment converted from a single-car garage. Her landlord is a young-at-heart octogenarian, Henry Pitts, a retired commercial baker who enjoys creating crossword puzzles; Kinsey admits to having a crush on Henry, but also says he is the closest thing she will have to a father. Henry's family is long-lived, his siblings all being well into their 90s. When not dining on fast food, Kinsey eats regularly at a local tavern, run by flamboyant Hungarian Rosie, who, in the course of the stories, marries Henry's hypochondriac brother, William. Kinsey has had several relationships in the series, beginning with Charlie Scorsoni, then Jonah Robb, a police officer, and Robert Dietz, another private eye, until the later novels in which she began an affair with longtime friend Cheney Phillips, a police detective. Kinsey remains friends with Cheney after their split, as she did for a while with Jonah, though Jonah slowly drops out of her life after patching up his on-off marriage. Dietz on the other hand loses touch with her completely, returning briefly in M is for Malice, although Kinsey still thinks of him occasionally. Having lived for most of her life with very few family members (for most of the series, her \\"family\\" consisted of Henry and his siblings, Rosie, and the generous-natured employees in nearby offices), Kinsey received a shock when she found out about the Kinsey clan. When she met cousins Tasha and Lisa, she realized the three are very similar in appearance. Kinsey and Tasha formed a business relationship in M Is for Malice and Kinsey was instinctively attached to Tasha's mother, her aunt Susanna, when they met. However, she has remained reluctant to become involved with her new-found family, feeling that they abandoned her when she was orphaned. However, in U is for Undertow she discovers that her grandmother made strenuous efforts to foster her after the accident, which Aunt Gin concealed from Kinsey. Kinsey finally agreed to meet Grand at a family event where her grandmother, now very frail, mistook her for her mother.

A young woman of Chinese and Native American descent, Michelle possesses a mysterious pendant allegedly capable of controlling evil and powerful spirits. The pendant has caused many problems in Michelle's life, including her father's killing by Heihachi Mishima's men when he failed to retrieve the treasure, as well as her mother and even her own kidnappings in later years. She later becomes the adoptive mother of Julia Chang, who masters her mother's discipline. Michelle is dropped from the canonical games after Tekken 2, but continues to appear in the series' spin-offs. She has also appeared in other media related to the series, including animated films and comics. Design and gameplay Michelle debuted in the Tekken series at the age of 18, which, alongside Anna Williams, made her the youngest human character to debut in the series until Ling Xiaoyu, who debuted in Tekken 3 at the age of 16. She is 20 years old in Tekken 2 and chronologically would be 41 as of Tekken 6; however, due to her never making a canonical appearance since Tekken 2 (aside from a cameo in her daughter Julia's ending in Tekken 3), she appeared in Tekken Tag Tournament and Tekken Tag Tournament 2 in her Tekken 2 appearance, making her physically comparable to her daughter, Julia, who too appeared in both games and is around 20 years of age as of Tekken 7. During an early development of Tekken Tag Tournament 2, some of Michelle's motion capture was done by the series producer Katsuhiro Harada. On Twitter, Harada complained about the \\"spam\\" from fans demanding to bring back Michelle and Jun Kazama, even after they were both confirmed to return in this game.Kirk Hamilton, Tekken Head Unleashes Twitter Tirade, Kotaku, June 26, 2012. Michelle utilized a variation of Kenpo called \\"Chang kenpo\\" mixed with xingyiquan. She shared many moves with Wang Jinrei, who too practiced xingyiquan. Her style and moveset were later adopted by her adopted daughter and substitute in the series, Julia. She still used the same fighting style in Tekken Tag Tournament 2, but she gained several unique moves to differentiate herself from both Wang and Julia. According to Prima Games' guide to the original Tekken, \\"though she does not have the awesome power of the heavy hitters, Michelle can tear through her enemies with fast counters and spectacular juggles. Michelle is next to unbeatable once you have mastered her ability to evade attacks and counter with lingering juggles.\\"Tri Pham, Tekken Tag Tournament: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. Similarly, a Hyper guide to Tekken 2 states that Michelle was often underestimated due to her lack of flashy moves, but for those who learned using her properly she could become one the most deadly character in the game. In Tekken Tag Tournament, Michelle is extremely fast; she is supposed to be played very aggressively as her combos hit all levels, causing problems for the opponents to block them all. She is also able to perform devastating counters and has a large number of moves that can start juggle combos. However, she can be a very difficult character to play. Appearances=In video games= Michelle Chang is a Chinese-Native American woman (her father was from Hong Kong and her mother is a Native American from Arizona) and the foster mother of Julia Chang. Michelle's father had been ordered by Heihachi to search for an ancient treasure of the Native Americans; a pendant allegedly capable of controlling powerful spirits, which is owned by Michelle. When he failed to retrieve it for Heihachi, the latter ordered his men to murder him. This fact is presented by Michelle's mother when she turns eighteen; she thus sets out to enter The King of Iron Fist Tournament in order to take revenge against Heihachi. Michelle encounters and defeats Kunimitsu, a female ninja treasure hunter that was seeking the pendant, and secures the amulet. She promptly withdraws from the tournament; as she has achieved what she then realises should have been her main goal, and although she does not win the tournament, Michelle is still satisfied that another fighter (Kazuya Mishima) defeated Heihachi. In Tekken 2, Michelle's mother has been kidnapped by Ganryu, who is working for Kazuya, who desires the pendant. She has entered the tournament to rescue her mother. Michelle meets Ganryu and battles him. After defeating Ganryu, she rescues her mother and returns home. However, unknown to her, Ganryu has fallen in love with her. A couple of years later, Michelle discovers an abandoned baby girl nearby her village. She adopts the infant, names her Julia, and loves her as if she were her own daughter. When Julia grows into a teenager, Michelle teaches her Chinese martial arts such as xingyiquan. Michelle's tribe grow worried when various martial artists around the world disappeared, allegedly because of the awakening of Ogre, whose legends have been passed on within the tribe. They fear that Michelle's pendant is the suspect. Michelle departs for Japan to ask Heihachi why he sought her pendant before, but she fails to return. Julia has entered the tournament to rescue her mother.Simon Hill, Tekken 3: Prima's Official Strategy Guide. She appears in Julia's ending, being reunited with her adopted daughter.

Michelle encounters and defeats Ganryu, but is beaten by Kazuya to the point that she begs him to let her face Heihachi and take revenge for Heihachi burning down her village and inadvertently killing both her parents. Kazuya, knowing that Michelle will be killed, refuses. Michelle continues to attack Kazuya relentlessly until he beats her into submission and nearly mercy-kills her, but is stopped by Jun's intervention.

She is left nameless in Chr√©tien's unfinished romance, but Wolfram von Eschenbach, who reworked the tale for the German epic Parzival, calls her Orgeluse (taken from rguilleuse, the Old French word for \\"proud\\"Orguillus in the Anglo-Norman Dictionary, 2013-7, published by the Anglo-Norman On-Line Hub.). In Chr√©tien's work, Gawain meets the Haughty Maiden while travelling; she treats him with contempt and scorn. Despite her humiliating treatment, Gawain acts with unfailing courtesy towards her, accepting her insults with grace. Following her instructions to search for a nearby castle by a ford, Gawain encounters a knight who tells him that he is either very brave or foolish, for everyone who has tried to cross the perilous ford between them had drowned. Gawain realises the damsel had tried to do away with him. The knight offers to lead Gawain to a bridge, but the hero chooses to jump the ford on his horse Gringolet. He fails once, but succeeds the second time, and when he returns to the Haughty Maiden, she finally gives in and asks for forgiveness for treating him so poorly. She explains that her attitude was the result of tragic circumstances; the knight Guiromelant tried to win her love by killing her first suitor in single combat. Gawain sets off to avenge the fallen knight, but matters are complicated when Guiromelant reveals his love for Gawain's sister. The poem breaks off before the matter is resolved, though a later author tied up some of the loose threads in the First Continuation of Perceval. Wolfram expands the story and brings it to completion. He explains that the Wounded King Anfortas had been injured fighting for Orgeluse, and was now waiting for Parzival (Percival) to heal him. Gawain and Orgeluse express their love for each other, and eventually peace is made between the lady and Guiromelant. Orgeluse marries Gawain while Guiromelant marries the champion's sister.

It is also the name of the fictional world where the setting takes place. The setting was launched in 2001 and is known for its odd twists on the fantasy genre, as well as its wide member approval and community-based design and construction. Unlike many other fantasy roleplaying games, which focus primarily on tactical combat, the Arcanis campaigns focus on moral ambiguity and politics. While originally launched as a d20srd title, Arcanis was relaunched in 2011 with a unique rules set as detailed in Paradigm Concepts. This system uses a similar initiative system to Feng Shui; a progressive clock system of initiative, with each action taking a specific number of 'ticks' of a clock rather than simply having everyone go in a predetermined order. Arcanis is set on the continent of Onara, where a crumbling Coryani Empire (reminiscent of the Western Roman Empire) struggles with newly created nations such as Milandir (reminiscent of the Holy Roman Empire) or Canceri (reminiscent of Russia during the Middle Ages and the Balkans). Races The playable Races in Arcanis differ from the traditional races in other Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings. There are seven primary races: Dark-kin (infernally tainted), Dwarves (cursed Giants), Elorii (basically Elves, but with some significant differences), Gnomes (offspring of a human and a dwarf), Humans (including the elementally attuned Kio and Undir), Ss'ressen (Lizard-folk), and Val (touched by the gods with different bloodlines depending on which God was their progenitor). While in the days of the d20srd rules other playable races were allowed‚Äîsuch as Half- Orcs‚Äîthe most recent Arcanis RPG rules have streamlined the system somewhat to remove these hold-overs from Dungeons & Dragons. = Dark-Kin = Dark-kin are those born with demonic traits. They are usually born from human parents who carry recessive demonic traits. Because of their bloodlines, Dark-kin tend to be marginalized in society. Dark-kin are the results of a period of Onara's history called the Time of Terror, when Demons, Devils, and other Infernals were released from the Hells by the powerful magics of the Myrantian Empire. = Dwarves = Giants were assigned the task of protecting mankind. When they began to lord over man, the king of the gods, Illiir cursed the giants, diminishing them into dwarves. Later, Sarish, the grandson of Illiir and the God of Contracts came to the Dwarves and told them that should they craft the perfect item, their curse would be lifted. The Dwarves are divided into different groups, called Enclaves. Unlike other humanoids on Onara, dwarves are barred from the afterlife due to their curse. To preserve their souls, each Dwarf carries with him a gem, known as Soul Stone to which their soul is trapped following their death, to be released when the Curse has been lifted. = Elorii = Elves in Arcanis are called Elorii. Made of the traditional Greek elements: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth, the Elorii are immortal. Elorii are divided into different subraces based on their elemental ancestry, adding another subrace known as the Life Elorii, or Ardekenes. The Elorii were created by four very powerful elementals in conjunction with a \\"life spirit\\" called Belisarda, who imbued elemental energies and life force into bioconstructed orc-like creature known as a Gar. Because of this, Elorii do not look like traditional Elves, having distinct fangs as well as other minor differences. These elemental spirits were worshipped by the Elorii as gods; they despise humanity because four of the human gods \\"absorbed\\" the four Elemental Lords, leaving only Belisarda. They eventually rebelled against their creators. = Gnomes = Gnomes in Arcanis are ugly, short half-breeds. These Gnomes are not an independent race, but are considered an 'aberration' race, resulting from the unholy breeding between Dwarves and Humans. Gnomes in Arcanis are disgustingly deformed, as the curse applied to dwarves applies equally to the stature of their offspring. However, unlike their Dwarven parents, Gnomes are not barred from the afterlife. = Humans = Humans mirror the traditional Dungeons & Dragons human. Most of humanity are latecomers to the continent of Onara (where most of the current story takes place), but at least one group, the Pengik, predate the Ss'regorean Empire, who have the oldest recorded history. Presently, there are two notable variations of Humanity: The Kio and the Undir. These subraces of Human have been attuned to the elements of air and water, respectively, and display several differences including longer life (Kio) and more elven traits (Undir). = Ss'ressen = Ss'ressen are lizard-men and a major component of the Ssethregoran Empire. This empire consists of many races, many of them serpentine such as Naga and Ssanu snake-men (who replaced the Yuan-ti after the latter were removed from the Open Gaming License content). The Ssethregorans are the oldest civilized group on the continent of Onara and at one point had conquered most of it. They are well known for their strange magics and were responsible for the creation of the Elorii. Originally, they worshiped the gods Kassegore and Yig, but with the rise of the Naga to a ruling position, they now worship vile gods known as the Varn. (Originally, they worshiped slaadi, but with the removal of these beings from the Open Gaming License content, Paradigm Concepts was forced to change this.) The Black Talon ss'ressen rebelled against the Ssethregoran Empire and fled. They had come to worship a god known as The Fire Dragon. They live in a swampy area of the nation of Milandir. The Ghost Scale are descendants of a splinter group of Black Talons who came upon an artifact in the sewers of Grand Coryan that radiates a magical aura (which so happens to also radiate heat enough to support a ss'eressen clutch) and took to worshiping it as a god by the name of Herka. The Ashen Hide ss'ressen broke off from the Black Talons, deciding that the Fire Dragon was actually the human god of fire and war, Nier. The Ashen Hide Clutch now resides in the nation of Canceri. = Val = Val were created during the God War as the elite warriors of the Gods and thereafter, as the caretakers of Mankind. In their stead, every god sent his servants, the Valinor, to mingle with the populace, and create a semi-divine family capable of aiding mankind. Every Val has a bloodline, which is tied to a specific god; they have divine powers which they may improve; these are related to their bloodline. For example, val'Ossan are tied to Yarris, god of the sea, and can gain Bloodline Powers such as walking on water and controlling sea creatures. Val are also the only psionic humans in Arcanis. Val always have steel grey eyes, unless they are psionically active; in psions, the iris turns clear, leaving the eye almost entirely white. Nations The nations of Arcanis are mostly human affairs, all related to the First Imperium that fell thousands of years ago; most of these are ruled by the Val. The primary human lands are: *The Republic of Altheria *The Theocracy of Canceri *The Coryani Empire *The Hinterlands *The Khitani Empire *The League of Princes *The Kingdom of Milandir *Ymandragore The three Elorii Nations are: *Elonb√© *Entaris *Malfea (a.k.a. Malfelen) The major Dwarven Enclaves are: *Solanos Mor *Nol Dappa *Tulipet *Tir Betoq *Encali There are three major clutches of Ss'ressen (outside of the Ssethregoran Empire), the second two being offshoots of the first: *Black Talons *Ashen Hide *Ghost Scale The other races are mostly outcasts and wanderers, though occasionally small racial enclaves arise in larger cities, rather than maintaining organized civilizations. Religion The Deities of Arcanis are sectioned off into different pantheons. The main pantheon is the Pantheon of Man, housing the human gods. Other pantheons such as the Pantheon of the Elves, are broken, or destroyed leaving only one or no gods behind. In Arcanis, \\"true\\" gods are unconcerned with petty mortal morality, so have no alignment as gods in other settings do; only churches have alignment, depending on what aspects of a god they worship. The Pantheon of Man, for example, does not have alignment, but the Sethregoran Varn Gods do. The foundation of the pantheon are three brother gods: Illiir, the Patron God of Emperors and Order, Sun God and Head of the Pantheon; Yarris, God of the Sea; and Neroth, God of Death. Further, three Goddesses are their sisters and in some cases consorts: Saluw√©, Goddess of the Earth, consort of Illiir; Beltine, Goddess of the Soul, wife of Neroth; and Anshar, Goddess of Pain and Suffering. The children of Illiir and Saluw√© are Hurrian, God of Storms and Honorable Combat, the Reluctant Warrior, Nier, God of Fire, War and Slaughter, and Larissa, Oracle of the Gods and (more recently) Goddess of Pleasure. The child of Neroth and Beltine is Cadic, the God of Shadows, Murder, and Music. Larissa and Cadic have a son named Sarish, God of Oaths and Binding of Demons. There is reference to Althares, God of Knowledge, Invention, and Artifice, as being the \\"Grand Uncle of Sarish,\\" but exactly where he fits into the divine family tree is unclear. =Schisms= The Mother Church of the Pantheon of Man once held all the gods in equal worship, until a schism occurred which drove followers of Neroth, Sarish and Nier to form an independent church, the Dark Triumvirate in Canceri. The Mother Church and the Dark Triumvirate differ in several ways, primarily in that the Dark Triumvirate approves of activities the Mother Church fears: the creation of Undead and the summoning of demons and devils for the most part. = The Ss'ressen and Ssethregoran Gods = The Fire Dragon is the god worshiped by the Black Talon ss'ressen. The Ashen Hide split off from this group, believing that Fire Dragon was actually the human god, Nier. The Ssethregoran Empire once worshiped the gods Kassegore and Yig. With the ascension of the Naga to a ruling position in the Empire, they have begun to worship a pantheon of beings from another plane known as the Varn. = The Elorii Pantheon = The Elorii follow the Elemental Lords that created them, despite the destruction of four of them. The remaining Elemental Lord, the life spirit Belisarda, was believed to have been destroyed by The Other (or Umor, as the Elorii knew him), until the arrival of a Prophet who claimed this was not true. * Belisarda ‚Äì Goddess of Life and Healing * Keleos ‚Äì God of Fire * M√¢rok ‚Äì God of Earth * Osal√≠an ‚Äì God of Air * Ber√∂e ‚Äì Goddess of Water =Elorii heresy= A somewhat common movement among Elorii has been the practice of identifying elemental lords with one of the human gods that supposedly absorbed those elemental lords powers. For instance, some Elorii followers of the Lord of Air consider Hurrian, the Storm Lord in the Pantheon of Man, to be their God. To other Elorii this seems to be heresy and is considered to be so, although the Mother Church (and the Dark Triumvirate in the case of Nier) has little or no issues for Elorii who choose this path. = Myrantian gods = The ancient Myrantian Hegemony had its own pantheon of gods, although much information about them has been lost to the ages. The Mother Church of Coryan considers worship of the Myrantian deities heresy, but allows the worship of traditional Pantheon of Man deities under the names of Myrantian gods. The Myrantian Pantheon seems primarily based on the Ancient Egyptian pantheon, though not entirely. Tzizhet is considered a combination of Sarish and Neroth. Shu is a god of storms, sky, and magic, considered an amalgam of Hurrian and Sarish. Factions and secret societies The setting also has secret societies, which are factions who have beliefs and goals that occasionally aid or impede the mission of players. Each faction varies in its goals as well as how secret each faction is. Many secret societies exist in the world, though a good number of them are restricted to non-player characters in the living campaigns. The following secret societies have been open to player characters in the living campaigns: *The Orthodoxy seeks to maintain orthodox human religion and eradicate heretical worship of the Pantheon of Man. *The Hawk and Shield seek to eradicate the minions of the Sorcerer King or protect those with arcane gifts from his depredations, respectively. *The Emerald Society are archaeologists who seek to discover anything and everything about the history of Onara, especially from the First Imperium of Man. *The Followers of the Azure Way wish to restore mankind to new glory by establishing a united Second Imperium of Man. *The Mourners in Silence believe that the gods of Arcanis have died or never existed. *The Swords of Nier are Nierites who follow Leonydas val'Virdan, Sword of the Heavens. *The Order of the Twilight Bough are Elorii *The Laerestri are Elorii from Elonb√© in the Vastwood. Though their existence is not secret, they sometimes receive secret orders from Elonb√©. In addition, sometimes secret orders are issued to specific nationalities, sides in war, or other subgroups. Living Arcanis Living Arcanis was the name of the first Living Campaign set in the Arcanis setting. It was run by Paradigm Concepts who hosts major events at large gaming conventions, such as Gen Con and Origins Game Fair. Also, Living Arcanis was played at smaller regional conventions throughout the world, many of which host special events, as well as by players at home.http://www.livingarcanis.com The core plot of the campaign was closely controlled by Henry Lopez. There are also several groups of quasi-independent writers whose adventures are sub-plots to the main story and are centered around a specific city, region, or secret society. These domains are known as Invisible Kingdoms, and their stewards are known as Invisible Kings and Queens. The first Living Arcanis campaign ended in 2009 with a climactic battle that ended the Coryani Civil War. A second interactive, \\"living\\" campaign, started a year later with Paradigm's new Arcanis game rules. This new campaign, originally called the Chronicles of the Shattered Empires and renamed Legends of Arcanis,http://paradigmconcepts.com/legends-of-arcanis-2/ is set about 50 years after the first one.

The township is within the Jakarta metropolitan area. Previously a swamp area, it opened in 1993 and is today a benchmark for Indonesia's other urban developments. This integrated development supports the \\"one-stop\\" living concept and combines residential condominiums, office space, education and healthcare facilities as well as commercial and entertainment areas in a strategic location and a green environment. Lippo Village has 120 km of internal roads and 250 km of drainage system networks. Population of the township is about 70,000 with over 200,000 visitors daily. History PT. Lippo Karawaci Tbk. was first established as PT. Tunggal Reksakencana in 1990, as a subsidiary of Lippo Group, to build the Lippo Village (then Lippo Karawaci) township in Tangerang. Lippo Village has a CBD area of about 132 hectares and Millennium Village is part of that development. Development of Millennium Village, which is termed as a global smart city is going on in a 70 hectares land area at the CBD of Lippo Village. The project is being developed at an estimated cost of $15 billion. Infrastructure Known for its clean environment and excellent infrastructure, Lippo Karawaci consists of three main residential areas and a commercial district. Supermal Karawaci (previously Lippo Supermal), located at the heart of the commercial district, was the largest shopping centre in west of Jakarta when it opened in 1996. Next to Supermal Karawaci, is the area of . This area of sidewalk restaurants, coffee shops, small boutiques and tree-lined streets has a feel reminiscent of a European Village. Across from Benton Junction is a large, two-storey Books & Beyond (previously Times Bookstore), one of Indonesia's largest English- language bookstores. Sekolah Pelita Harapan (SPH), Sekolah Dian Harapan (SDH) and University of Pelita Harapan (UPH), all part of Yayasan Pelita Harapan were founded (and are located) in Lippo Karawaci. The township also hosts Siloam Hospital (previously Siloam Gleneagles Hospital), a four star Imperial Aryaduta Hotel and a championship Imperial Golf Club. The apartment complex Amartapura, which is located in the township, consists of a 50 story and 40 story tower. Most Lippo companies are headquartered in Lippo Karawaci including AIG Life, Matahari Department Store and Supermarket, Multipolar Corporation, Lippo Bank, Kabelvision and Lippo General Insurance. Lippo Village has 3 business park, known as Lippo Cyber Park (Ruko Gajah Mada), Karawaci Office Park (Ruko Pinangsia) and The Excellis. There are 3 clusters of shop houses in the township, Lippo Village Central, West and North. The area is also home to many businesses run by Korean expatriates in Indonesia. The temporary Jakarta Street Circuit in Karawaci was confirmed to host the fifth round of the 2008-09 A1 Grand Prix season, set for the weekend of 8 February 2009 to showcase the village and the surrounding businesses. The track is designed by Hermann Tilke. However, the race failed to materialise, and since then parts of the race track and pit stop has been converted into University of Pelita Harapan‚Äôs parking lot and faculty building. Transportation The township itself has a direct highway exit to Jakarta- Tangerang Toll Road. Within the Lippo Village area, there are shuttle bus services. The township authority also provide external shuttle bus and helicopter services to many areas in Jakarta and surrounding areas. TransJakarta has feeder services to the township from Jakarta.

The court, however, in its discretion, may allow limited use of argumentative questions on cross exam.\\" Minnesota State Bar, \\"Mock Trial Objections\\", accessed 22 March 2018 One common misconception is that argumentative questions are meant only to cause a witness to argue with the examiner. This error rests on misunderstanding the word \\"argument\\". Argument can mean \\"a series of persuasive statements\\" (the legal sense discussed in this article) as well as \\"a verbal fight or disagreement\\". Thus, an argumentative objection may be raised only when the lawyer himself is making a legal argument under the guise of asking a question. \\"Badgering the witness\\" is the proper objection for a lawyer who is antagonizing or mocking a witness by asking insulting or derisive questions, perhaps in an attempt to provoke an emotional response.\\"Badgering the Witness: An attorney may not harass or continue to annoy/aggravate a witness.\\" Minnesota State Bar, \\"Mock Trial Objections\\", accessed 22 March 2018 Example A lawyer on direct examination asks his witness, a layperson with no legal training, \\"So John Doe was driving negligently?\\" Opposing counsel could raise an argumentative objection. In this context, \\"negligently\\" is a legal term of art with a precise and narrow meaning, and the witness cannot reasonably answer the question without understanding the relevant law. Since the lawyer is \\"arguing\\" his case that John Doe was driving negligently through the witness, the objection would be sustained and the improper statements stricken from the record. In this example, however, the lawyer conducting the direct examination may have an opportunity to rephrase his question. If the judge sustains the argumentative objection, the lawyer may instead ask questions such as \\"was John Doe exceeding the posted speed limit?\\", \\"was John Doe making lane changes without proper signals?\\", \\"how did Mr. Doe respond to your comments about his driving,\\" or \\"Did you feel unsafe when you were a passenger in the car driven by John Doe?\\" Such questions may be permitted and require no legal expertise for a layperson to answer, thus allowing the lawyer to introduce testimony about John Doe's driving habits without specifically using the legal term negligence.
